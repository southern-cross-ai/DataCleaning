<h2><a name="ch1" id="ch1"></a>One</h2>

<p>Three years is a long time to leave a letter unanswered, and
your letter has been lying without an answer even longer than that.
I had hoped that it would answer itself, or that other people would
answer it for me. But there it is with its question&mdash;How in
your opinion are we to prevent war?&mdash;still unanswered.</p>

<p>It is true that many answers have suggested themselves, but none
that would not need explanation, and explanations take time. In
this case, too, there are reasons why it is particularly difficult
to avoid misunderstanding. A whole page could be filled with
excuses and apologies; declarations of unfitness, incompetence,
lack of knowledge, and experience: and they would be true. But even
when they were said there would still remain some difficulties so
fundamental that it may well prove impossible for you to understand
or for us to explain. But one does not like to leave so remarkable
a letter as yours&mdash;a letter perhaps unique in the history of
human correspondence, since when before has an educated man asked a
woman how in her opinion war can be prevented?&mdash;unanswered.
Therefore let us make the attempt; even if it is doomed to
failure.</p>

<p>In the first place let us draw what all letter-writers
instinctively draw, a sketch of the person to whom the letter is
addressed. Without someone warm and breathing on the other side of
the page, letters are worthless. You, then, who ask the question,
are a little grey on the temples; the hair is no longer thick on
the top of your head. You have reached the middle years of life not
without effort, at the Bar; but on the whole your journey has been
prosperous. There is nothing parched, mean or dissatisfied in your
expression. And without wishing to flatter you, your
prosperity&mdash;wife, children, house&mdash;has been deserved. You
have never sunk into the contented apathy of middle life, for, as
your letter from an office in the heart of London shows, instead of
turning on your pillow and prodding your pigs, pruning your pear
trees&mdash;you have a few acres in Norfolk&mdash;you are writing
letters, attending meetings, presiding over this and that, asking
questions, with the sound of the guns in your ears. For the rest,
you began your education at one of the great public schools and
finished it at the university.</p>

<p>It is now that the first difficulty of communication between us
appears. Let us rapidly indicate the reason. We both come of what,
in this hybrid age when, though birth is mixed, classes still
remain fixed, it is convenient to call the educated class. When we
meet in the flesh we speak with the same accent; use knives and
forks in the same way; expect maids to cook dinner and wash up
after dinner; and can talk during dinner without much difficulty
about politics and people; war and peace; barbarism and
civilization&mdash;all the questions indeed suggested by your
letter. Moreover, we both earn our livings. But . . . those three
dots mark a precipice, a gulf so deeply cut between us that for
three years and more I have been sitting on my side of it wondering
whether it is any use to try to speak across it. Let us then ask
someone else&mdash;it is Mary Kingsley&mdash;to speak for us. 'I
don't know if I ever revealed to you the fact that being allowed to
learn German was <i>all</i> the paid-for education I ever had. Two
thousand pounds was spent on my brother's, I still hope not in
vain.'<sup><a href="#101">1</a></sup> Mary Kingsley is not speaking
for herself alone; she is speaking, still, for many of the
daughters of educated men. And she is not merely speaking for them;
she is also pointing to a very important fact about them, a fact
that must profoundly influence all that follows: the fact of
Arthur's Education Fund. You, who have read <i>Pendennis,</i> will
remember how the mysterious letters A.E.F. figured in the household
ledgers. Ever since the thirteenth century English families have
been paying money into that account. From the Pastons to the
Pendennises, all educated families from the thirteenth century to
the present moment have paid money into that account. It is a
voracious receptacle. Where there were many sons to educate it
required a great effort on the part of the family to keep it full.
For your education was not merely in book-learning; games educated
your body; friends taught you more than books or games. Talk with
them broadened your outlook and enriched your mind. In the holidays
you travelled; acquired a taste for art; a knowledge of foreign
politics; and then, before you could earn your own living, your
father made you an allowance upon which it was possible for you to
live while you learnt the profession which now entitles you to add
the letters K.C. to your name. All this came out of Arthur's
Education Fund. And to this your sisters, as Mary Kingsley
indicates, made their contribution. Not only did their own
education, save for such small sums as paid the German teacher, go
into it; but many of those luxuries and trimmings which are, after
all, an essential part of education&mdash;travel, society,
solitude, a lodging apart from the family house&mdash;they were
paid into it too. It was a voracious receptacle, a solid
fact&mdash;Arthur's Education Fund&mdash;a fact so solid indeed
that it cast a shadow over the entire landscape. And the result is
that though we look at the same things, we see them differently.
What is that congregation of buildings there, with a semi-monastic
look, with chapels and halls and green playing-fields? To you it is
your old school; Eton or Harrow; your old university, Oxford or
Cambridge; the source of memories and of traditions innumerable.
But to us, who see it through the shadow of Arthur's Education
Fund, it is a schoolroom table; an omnibus going to a class; a
little woman with a red nose who is not well educated herself but
has an invalid mother to support; an allowance of &pound;50 a year
with which to buy clothes, give presents and take journeys on
coming to maturity. Such is the effect that Arthur's Education Fund
has had upon us. So magically does it change the landscape that the
noble courts and quadrangles of Oxford and Cambridge often appear
to educated men's daughters<sup><a href="#102">2</a></sup> like
petticoats with holes in them, cold legs of mutton, and the boat
train starting for abroad while the guard slams the door in their
faces.</p>

<p>The fact that Arthur's Education Fund changes the
landscape&mdash;the halls, the playing grounds, the sacred
edifices&mdash;is an important one; but that aspect must be left
for future discussion. Here we are only concerned with the obvious
fact, when it comes to considering this important
question&mdash;how we are to help you prevent war&mdash;that
education makes a difference. Some knowledge of politics, of
international relations of economics, is obviously necessary in
order to understand the causes which lead to war. Philosophy,
theology even, might come in usefully. Now you the uneducated, you
with an untrained mind, could not possibly deal with such questions
satisfactorily. War, as the result of impersonal forces, is you
will agree beyond the grasp of the untrained mind. But war as the
result of human nature is another thing. Had you not believed that
human nature, the reasons, the emotions of the ordinary man and
woman, lead to war, you would not have written asking for our help.
You must have argued, men and women, here and now, are able to
exert their wills; they are not pawns and puppets dancing on a
string held by invisible hands. They can act, and think for
themselves. Perhaps even they can influence other people's thoughts
and actions. Some such reasoning must have led you to apply to us;
and with justification. For happily there is one branch of
education which comes under the heading 'unpaid-for
education'&mdash;that understanding of human beings and their
motives which, if the word is rid of its scientific associations,
might be called psychology. Marriage, the one great profession open
to our class since the dawn of time until the year 1919; marriage,
the art of choosing the human being with whom to live life
successfully, should have taught us some skill in that. But here
again another difficulty confronts us. For though many instincts
are held more or less in common by both sexes, to fight has always
been the man's habit, not the woman's. Law and practice have
developed that difference, whether innate or accidental. Scarcely a
human being in the course of history has fallen to a woman's rifle;
the vast majority of birds and beasts have been killed by you, not
by us; and it is difficult to judge what we do not
share.<sup><a href="#103">3</a></sup></p>

<p>How then are we to understand your problem, and if we cannot,
how can we answer your question, how to prevent war? The answer
based upon our experience and our psychology&mdash;Why
fight?&mdash;is not an answer of any value. Obviously there is for
you some glory, some necessity, some satisfaction in fighting which
we have never felt or enjoyed. Complete understanding could only be
achieved by blood transfusion and memory transfusion&mdash;a
miracle still beyond the reach of science. But we who live now have
a substitute for blood transfusion and memory transfusion which
must serve at a pinch. There is that marvellous, perpetually
renewed, and as yet largely untapped aid to the understanding of
human motives which is provided in our age by biography and
autobiography. Also there is the daily paper, history in the raw.
There is thus no longer any reason to be confined to the minute
span of actual experience which is still, for us, so narrow, so
circumscribed. We can supplement it by looking at the picture of
the lives of others. It is of course only a picture at present, but
as such it must serve. It is to biography then that we will turn
first, quickly and briefly, in order to attempt to understand what
war means to you. Let us extract a few sentences from a biography.
First, this from a soldier's life:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I have had the happiest possible life, and have always been
working for war, and have now got into the biggest in the prime of
life for a soldier . . . Thank God, we are off in an hour. Such a
magnificent regiment! Such men, such horses! Within ten days I hope
Francis and I will be riding side by side straight at the
Germans.<sup><a href="#104">4</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>To which the biographer adds:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>From the first hour he had been supremely happy, for he had
found his true calling.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>To that let us add this from an airman's life:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We talked of the League of Nations and the prospects of peace
and disarmament. On this subject he was not so much militarist as
martial. The difficulty to which he could find no answer was that
if permanent peace were ever achieved, and armies and navies ceased
to exist, there would be no outlet for the manly qualities which
fighting developed, and that human physique and human character
would deteriorate.<sup><a href="#105">5</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Here, immediately, are three reasons which lead your sex to
fight; war is a profession; a source of happiness and excitement;
and it is also an outlet for manly qualities, without which men
would deteriorate. But that these feelings and opinions are by no
means universally held by your sex is proved by the following
extract from another biography, the life of a poet who was killed
in the European war: Wilfred Owen.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Already I have comprehended a light which never will filter into
the dogma of any national church: namely, that one of Christ's
essential commands was: Passivity at any price! Suffer dishonour
and disgrace, but never resort to arms. Be bullied, be outraged, be
killed; but do not kill . . . Thus you see how pure Christianity
will not fit in with pure patriotism.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>And among some notes for poems that he did not live to write are
these:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The unnaturalness of weapons . . . Inhumanity of war . . . The
insupportability of war . . . Horrible beastliness of war . . .
Foolishness of war.<sup><a href="#106">6</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>From these quotations it is obvious that the same sex holds very
different opinions about the same thing. But also it is obvious,
from today's newspaper, that however many dissentients there are,
the great majority of your sex are today in favour of war. The
Scarborough Conference of educated men, the Bournemouth Conference
of working men are both agreed that to spend &pound;300,000,000
annually upon arms is a necessity. They are of opinion that Wilfred
Owen was wrong; that it is better to kill than to be killed. Yet
since biography shows that differences of opinion are many, it is
plain that there must be some one reason which prevails in order to
bring about this overpowering unanimity. Shall we call it, for the
sake of brevity, 'patriotism'? What then, we must ask next, is this
'patriotism' which leads you to go to war? Let the Lord Chief
Justice of England interpret it for us:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Englishmen are proud of England. For those who have been trained
in English schools and universities, and who have done the work of
their lives in England, there are few loves stronger than the love
we have for our country. When we consider other nations, when we
judge the merits of the policy of this country or of that, it is
the standard of our own country that we apply . . . Liberty has
made her abode in England. England is the home of democratic
institutions . . . It is true that in our midst there are many
enemies of liberty&mdash;some of them, perhaps, in rather
unexpected quarters. But we are standing firm. It has been said
that an Englishman's Home is his Castle. The home of Liberty is in
England. And it is a castle indeed&mdash;a castle that will be
defended to the last. . . Yes, we are greatly blessed, we
Englishmen.<sup><a href="#107">7</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>That is a fair general statement of what patriotism means to an
educated man and what duties it imposes upon him. But the educated
man's sister&mdash;what does 'patriotism' mean to her? Has she the
same reasons for being proud of England, for loving England, for
defending England? Has she been 'greatly blessed' in England?
History and biography when questioned would seem to show that her
position in the home of freedom has been different from her
brother's; and psychology would seem to hint that history is not
without its effect upon mind and body. Therefore her interpretation
of the word 'patriotism' may well differ from his. And that
difference may make it extremely difficult for her to understand
his definition of patriotism and the duties it imposes. If then our
answer to your question, 'How in your opinion are we to prevent
war?' depends upon understanding the reasons, the emotions, the
loyalties which lead men to go to war, this letter had better be
torn across and thrown into the waste-paper basket. For it seems
plain that we cannot understand each other because of these
differences. It seems plain that we think differently according as
we are born differently; there is a Grenfell point of view; a
Knebworth point of view; a Wilfred Owen point of view; a Lord Chief
Justice's point of view and the point of view of an educated man's
daughter. All differ. But is there no absolute point of view? Can
we not find somewhere written up in letters of fire or gold, 'This
is right. This wrong'?&mdash;a moral judgement which we must all,
whatever our differences, accept? Let us then refer the question of
the rightness or wrongness of war to those who make morality their
profession&mdash;the clergy. Surely if we ask the clergy the simple
question: 'Is war right or is war wrong?' they will give us a plain
answer which we cannot deny. But no&mdash;the Church of England,
which might be supposed able to abstract the question from its
worldly confusions, is of two minds also. The bishops themselves
are at loggerheads. The Bishop of London maintained that 'the real
danger to the peace of the world today were the pacifists. Bad as
war was dishonour was far worse.'<sup><a href="#108">8</a></sup> On
the other hand, the Bishop of Birmingham<sup><a href=
"#108">9</a></sup> described himself as an 'extreme pacifist . . .
I cannot see myself that war can be regarded as consonant with the
spirit of Christ.' So the Church itself gives us divided
counsel&mdash;in some circumstances it is right to fight; in no
circumstances is it right to fight. It is distressing, baffling,
confusing, but the fact must be faced; there is no certainty in
heaven above or on earth below. Indeed the more lives we read, the
more speeches we listen to, the more opinions we consult, the
greater the confusion becomes and the less possible it seems, since
we cannot understand the impulses, the motives, or the morality
which lead you to go to war, to make any suggestion that will help
you to prevent war.</p>

<p>But besides these pictures of other people's lives and
minds&mdash;these biographies and histories&mdash;there are also
other pictures&mdash;pictures of actual facts; photographs.
Photographs, of course, are not arguments addressed to the reason;
they are simply statements of fact addressed to the eye. But in
that very simplicity there may be some help. Let us see then
whether when we look at the same photographs we feel the same
things. Here then on the table before us are photographs. The
Spanish Government sends them with patient pertinacity about twice
a week.* They are not pleasant photographs to look upon. They are
photographs of dead bodies for the most part. This morning's
collection contains the photograph of what might be a man's body,
or a woman's; it is so mutilated that it might, on the other hand,
be the body of a pig. But those certainly are dead children, and
that undoubtedly is the section of a house. A bomb has torn open
the side; there is still a birdcage hanging in what was presumably
the sitting-room, but the rest of the house looks like nothing so
much as a bunch of spillikins suspended in mid air.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>* Written in the winter of 1936-7.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Those photographs are not an argument; they are simply a crude
statement of fact addressed to the eye. But the eye is connected
with the brain; the brain with the nervous system. That system
sends its messages in a flash through every past memory and present
feeling. When we look at those photographs some fusion takes place
within us; however different the education, the traditions behind
us, our sensations are the same; and they are violent. You, Sir,
call them 'horror and disgust'. We also call them horror and
disgust. And the same words rise to our lips. War, you say, is an
abomination; a barbarity; war must be stopped at whatever cost. And
we echo your words. War is an abomination; a barbarity; war must be
stopped. For now at last we are looking at the same picture; we are
seeing with you the same dead bodies, the same ruined houses.</p>

<p>Let us then give up, for the moment, the effort to answer your
question, how we can help you to prevent war, by discussing the
political, the patriotic or the psychological reasons which lead
you to go to war. The emotion is too positive to suffer patient
analysis. Let us concentrate upon the practical suggestions which
you bring forward for our consideration. There are three of them.
The first is to sign a letter to the newspapers; the second is to
join a certain society; the third is to subscribe to its funds.
Nothing on the face of it could sound simpler. To scribble a name
on a sheet of paper is easy; to attend a meeting where pacific
opinions are more or less rhetorically reiterated to people who
already believe in them is also easy; and to write a cheque in
support of those vaguely acceptable opinions, though not so easy,
is a cheap way of quieting what may conveniently be called one's
conscience. Yet there are reasons which make us hesitate; reasons
into which we must enter, less superficially, later on. Here it is
enough to say that though the three measures you suggest seem
plausible, yet it also seems that, if we did what you ask, the
emotion caused by the photographs would still remain unappeased.
That emotion, that very positive emotion, demands something more
positive than a name written on a sheet of paper; an hour spent
listening to speeches; a cheque written for whatever sum we can
afford&mdash;say one guinea. Some more energetic, some more active
method of expressing our belief that war is barbarous, that war is
inhuman, that war, as Wilfred Owen put it, is insupportable,
horrible and beastly seems to be required. But, rhetoric apart,
what active method is open to us? Let us consider and compare. You,
of course, could once more take up arms&mdash;in Spain, as before
in France&mdash;in defence of peace. But that presumably is a
method that having tried you have rejected. At any rate that method
is not open to us; both the Army and the Navy are closed to our
sex. We are not allowed to fight. Nor again are we allowed to be
members of the Stock Exchange. Thus we can use neither the pressure
of force nor the pressure of money. The less direct but still
effective weapons which our brothers, as educated men, possess in
the diplomatic service, in the Church, are also denied to us. We
cannot preach sermons or negotiate treaties. Then again although it
is true that we can write articles or send letters to the Press,
the control of the Press&mdash;the decision what to print, what not
to print&mdash;is entirely in the hands of your sex. It is true
that for the past twenty years we have been admitted to the Civil
Service and to the Bar; but our position there is still very
precarious and our authority of the slightest. Thus all the weapons
with which an educated man can enforce his opinion are either
beyond our grasp or so nearly beyond it that even if we used them
we could scarcely inflict one scratch. If the men in your
profession were to unite in any demand and were to say: 'If it is
not granted we will stop work', the laws of England would cease to
be administered. If the women in your profession said the same
thing it would make no difference to the laws of England whatever.
Not only are we incomparably weaker than the men of our own class;
we are weaker than the women of the working class. If the working
women of the country were to say: 'If you go to war, we will refuse
to make munitions or to help in the production of goods,' the
difficulty of war-making would be seriously increased. But if all
the daughters of educated men were to down tools tomorrow, nothing
essential either to the life or to the war-making of the community
would be embarrassed. Our class is the weakest of all the classes
in the state. We have no weapon with which to enforce our
will.<sup><a href="#110">10</a></sup></p>

<p>The answer to that is so familiar that we can easily anticipate
it. The daughters of educated men have no direct influence, it is
true; but they possess the greatest power of all; that is, the
influence that they can exert upon educated men. If this is true,
if, that is, influence is still the strongest of our weapons and
the only one that can be effective in helping you to prevent war,
let us, before we sign your manifesto or join your society,
consider what that influence amounts to. Clearly it is of such
immense importance that it deserves profound and prolonged
scrutiny. Ours cannot be profound; nor can it be prolonged; it must
be rapid and imperfect&mdash;still, let us attempt it.</p>

<p>What influence then have we had in the past upon the profession
that is most closely connected with war&mdash;upon politics? There
again are the innumerable, the invaluable biographies, but it would
puzzle an alchemist to extract from the massed lives of politicians
that particular strain which is the influence upon them of women.
Our analysis can only be slight and superficial; still if we narrow
our inquiry to manageable limits, and run over the memoirs of a
century and a half we can hardly deny that there have been women
who have influenced politics. The famous Duchess of Devonshire,
Lady Palmerston, Lady Melbourne, Madame de Lieven, Lady Holland,
Lady Ashburton&mdash;to skip from one famous name to
another&mdash;were all undoubtedly possessed of great political
influence. Their famous houses and the parties that met in them
play so large a part in the political memoirs of the time that we
can hardly deny that English politics, even perhaps English wars,
would have been different had those houses and those parties never
existed. But there is one characteristic that all those memoirs
possess in common; the names of the great political
leaders&mdash;Pitt, Fox, Burke, Sheridan, Peel, Canning,
Palmerston, Disraeli, Gladstone&mdash;are sprinkled on every page;
but you will not find either at the head of the stairs receiving
the guests, or in the more private apartments of the house, any
daughter of an educated man. It may be that they were deficient in
charm, in wit, in rank, or in clothing. Whatever the reason, you
may turn page after page, volume after volume, and though you will
find their brothers and husbands&mdash;Sheridan at Devonshire
House, Macaulay at Holland House, Matthew Arnold at Lansdowne
House, Carlyle even at Bath House, the names of Jane Austen,
Charlotte Bront&euml;, and George Eliot do not occur; and though
Mrs Carlyle went, Mrs Carlyle seems on her own showing to have
found herself ill at ease.</p>

<p>But, as you will point out, the daughters of educated men may
have possessed another kind of influence&mdash;one that was
independent of wealth and rank, of wine, food, dress and all the
other amenities that make the great houses of the great ladies so
seductive. Here indeed we are on firmer ground, for there was of
course one political cause which the daughters of educated men had
much at heart during the past 150 years: the franchise. But when we
consider how long it took them to win that cause, and what labour,
we can only conclude that influence has to be combined with wealth
in order to be effective as a political weapon, and that influence
of the kind that can be exerted by the daughters of educated men is
very low in power, very slow in action, and very painful in
use.<sup><a href="#111">11</a></sup> Certainly the one great
political achievement of the educated man's daughter cost her over
a century of the most exhausting and menial labour; kept her
trudging in processions, working in offices, speaking at street
corners; finally, because she used force, sent her to prison, and
would very likely still keep her there, had it not been,
paradoxically enough, that the help she gave her brothers when they
used force at last gave her the right to call herself, if not a
full daughter, still a stepdaughter of England.<sup><a href=
"#112">12</a></sup></p>

<p>Influence then when put to the test would seem to be only fully
effective when combined with rank, wealth and great houses. The
influential are the daughters of noblemen, not the daughters of
educated men. And that influence is of the kind described by a
distinguished member of your own profession, the late Sir Ernest
Wild.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>He claimed that the great influence which women exerted over men
always had been, and always ought to be, an indirect influence. Man
liked to think he was doing his job himself when, in fact, he was
doing just what the woman wanted, but the wise woman always let him
think he was running the show when he was not. Any woman who chose
to take an interest in politics had an immensely greater power
without the vote than with it, because she could influence many
voters. His feeling was that it was not right to bring women down
to the level of men. He looked up to women, and wanted to continue
to do so. He desired that the age of chivalry should not pass,
because every man who had a woman to care about him liked to shine
in her eyes.<sup><a href="#113">13</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>And so on.</p>

<p>If such is the real nature of our influence, and we all
recognize the description and have noted the effects, it is either
beyond our reach, for many of us are plain, poor and old; or
beneath our contempt, for many of us would prefer to call ourselves
prostitutes simply and to take our stand openly under the lamps of
Piccadilly Circus rather than use it. If such is the real nature,
the indirect nature, of this celebrated weapon, we must do without
it; add our pigmy impetus to your more substantial forces, and have
recourse, as you suggest, to letter signing, society joining and
the drawing of an occasional exiguous cheque. Such would seem to be
the inevitable, though depressing, conclusion of our inquiry into
the nature of influence, were it not that for some reason, never
satisfactorily explained, the right to vote,<sup><a href=
"#114">14</a></sup> in itself by no means negligible, was
mysteriously connected with another right of such immense value to
the daughters of educated men that almost every word in the
dictionary has been changed by it, including the word 'influence'.
You will not think these words exaggerated if we explain that they
refer to the right to earn one's living.</p>

<p>That, Sir, was the right that was conferred upon us less than
twenty years ago, in the year 1919, by an Act which unbarred the
professions. The door of the private house was thrown open. In
every purse there was, or might be, one bright new sixpence in
whose light every thought, every sight, every action looked
different. Twenty years is not, as time goes, a long time; nor is a
sixpenny bit a very important coin; nor can we yet draw upon
biography to supply us with a picture of the lives and minds of the
new-sixpenny owners. But in imagination perhaps we can see the
educated man's daughter, as she issues from the shadow of the
private house, and stands on the bridge which lies between the old
world and the new, and asks, as she twirls the sacred coin in her
hand, 'What shall I do with it? What do I see with it?' Through
that light we may guess everything she saw looked
different&mdash;men and women, cars and churches. The moon even,
scarred as it is in fact with forgotten craters, seemed to her a
white sixpence, a chaste sixpence, an altar upon which she vowed
never to side with the servile, the signers-on, since it was hers
to do what she liked with&mdash;the sacred sixpence that she had
earned with her own hands herself. And if checking imagination with
prosaic good sense, you object that to depend upon a profession is
only another form of slavery, you will admit from your own
experience that to depend upon a profession is a less odious form
of slavery than to depend upon a father. Recall the joy with which
you received your first guinea for your first brief, and the deep
breath of freedom that you drew when you realized that your days of
dependence upon Arthur's Education Fund were over. From that
guinea, as from one of the magic pellets to which children set fire
and a tree rises, all that you most value&mdash;wife, children,
home&mdash;and above all that influence which now enables you to
influence other men, have sprung. What would that influence be if
you were still drawing &pound;40 a year from the family purse, and
for any addition to that income were dependent even upon the most
benevolent of fathers? But it is needless to expatiate. Whatever
the reason, whether pride, or love of freedom, or hatred of
hypocrisy, you will understand the excitement with which in 1919
your sisters began to earn not a guinea but a sixpenny bit, and
will not scorn that pride, or deny that it was justly based, since
it meant that they need no longer use the influence described by
Sir Ernest Wild.</p>

<p>The word 'influence' then has changed. The educated man's
daughter has now at her disposal an influence which is different
from any influence that she has possessed before. It is not the
influence which the great lady, the Siren, possesses; nor is it the
influence which the educated man's daughter possessed when she had
no vote; nor is it the influence which she possessed when she had a
vote but was debarred from the right to earn her living. It
differs, because it is an influence from which the charm element
has been removed; it is an influence from which the money element
has been removed. She need no longer use her charm to procure money
from her father or brother. Since it is beyond the power of her
family to punish her financially she can express her own opinions.
In place of the admirations and antipathies which were often
unconsciously dictated by the need of money she can declare her
genuine likes and dislikes. In short, she need not acquiesce; she
can criticize. At last she is in possession of an influence that is
disinterested.</p>

<p>Such in rough and rapid outlines is the nature of our new
weapon, the influence which the educated man's daughter can exert
now that she is able to earn her own living. The question that has
next to be discussed, therefore, is how can she use this new weapon
to help you to prevent war? And it is immediately plain that if
there is no difference between men who earn their livings in the
professions and women who earn their livings, then this letter can
end; for if our point of view is the same as yours then we must add
our sixpence to your guinea; follow your methods and repeat your
words. But, whether fortunately or unfortunately, that is not true.
The two classes still differ enormously. And to prove this, we need
not have recourse to the dangerous and uncertain theories of
psychologists and biologists; we can appeal to facts. Take the fact
of education. Your class has been educated at public schools and
universities for five or six hundred years, ours for sixty. Take
the fact of property.<sup><a href="#115">15</a></sup> Your class
possesses in its own right and not through marriage practically all
the capital, all the land, all the valuables, and all the patronage
in England. Our class possesses in its own right and not through
marriage practically none of the capital, none of the land, none of
the valuables, and none of the patronage in England. That such
differences make for very considerable differences in mind and
body, no psychologist or biologist would deny. It would seem to
follow then as an indisputable fact that 'we'&mdash;meaning by 'we'
a whole made trained and are so differently influenced by memory
and tradition&mdash;must still differ in some essential respects
from 'you', whose body, brain and spirit have been so differently
trained and are so differently influenced by memory and tradition.
Though we see the same world, we see it through different eyes. Any
help we can give you must be different from that you can give
yourselves, and perhaps the value of that help may lie in the fact
of that difference. Therefore before we agree to sign your
manifesto or join your society, it might be well to discover where
the difference lies, because then we may discover where the help
lies also. Let us then by way of a very elementary beginning lay
before you a photograph&mdash;a crudely coloured
photograph&mdash;of your world as it appears to us who see it from
the threshold of the private house; through the shadow of the veil
that St Paul still lays upon our eyes; from the bridge which
connects the private house with the world of public life.</p>

<p>Your world, then, the world of professional, of public life,
seen from this angle undoubtedly looks queer. At first sight it is
enormously impressive. Within quite a small space are crowded
together St Paul's, the Bank of England, the Mansion House, the
massive if funereal battlements of the Law Courts; and on the other
side, Westminster Abbey and the Houses of Parliament. There, we say
to ourselves, pausing, in this moment of transition on the bridge,
our fathers and brothers have spent their lives. All these hundreds
of years they have been mounting those steps, passing in and out of
those doors, ascending those pulpits, preaching, money-making,
administering justice. It is from this world that the private house
(somewhere, roughly speaking, in the West End) has derived its
creeds, its laws, its clothes and carpets, its beef and mutton. And
then, as is now permissible, cautiously pushing aside the swing
doors of one of these temples, we enter on tiptoe and survey the
scene in greater detail. The first sensation of colossal size, of
majestic masonry is broken up into a myriad points of amazement
mixed with interrogation. Your clothes in the first place make us
gape with astonishment.<sup><a href="#116">16</a></sup> How many,
how splendid, how extremely ornate they are&mdash;the clothes worn
by the educated man in his public capacity! Now you dress in
violet; a jewelled crucifix swings on your breast; now your
shoulders are covered with lace; now furred with ermine; now slung
with many linked chains set with precious stones. Now you wear wigs
on your heads; rows of graduated curls descend to your necks. Now
your hats are boat-shaped, or cocked; now they mount in cones of
black fur; now they are made of brass and scuttle shaped; now
plumes of red, now of blue hair surmount them. Sometimes gowns
cover your legs; sometimes gaiters. Tabards embroidered with lions
and unicorns swing from your shoulders; metal objects cut in star
shapes or in circles glitter and twinkle upon your breasts. Ribbons
of all colours&mdash;blue, purple, crimson&mdash;cross from
shoulder to shoulder. After the comparative simplicity of your
dress at home, the splendour of your public attire is dazzling.</p>

<p>But far stranger are two other facts that gradually reveal
themselves when our eyes have recovered from their first amazement.
Not only are whole bodies of men dressed alike summer and
winter&mdash;a strange characteristic to a sex which changes its
clothes according to the season, and for reasons of private taste
and comfort&mdash;but every button, rosette and stripe seems to
have some symbolical meaning. Some have the right to wear plain
buttons only; others rosettes; some may wear a single stripe;
others three, four, five or six. And each curl or stripe is sewn on
at precisely the right distance apart; it may be one inch for one
man, one inch and a quarter for another. Rules again regulate the
gold wire on the shoulders, the braid on the trousers, the cockades
on the hats&mdash;but no single pair of eyes can observe all these
distinctions, let alone account for them accurately.</p>

<p>Even stranger, however, than the symbolic splendour of your
clothes are the ceremonies that take place when you wear them. Here
you kneel; there you bow; here you advance in procession behind a
man carrying a silver poker; here you mount a carved chair; here
you appear to do homage to a piece of painted wood; here you abase
yourselves before tables covered with richly worked tapestry. And
whatever these ceremonies may mean you perform them always
together, always in step, always in the uniform proper to the man
and the occasion.</p>

<p>Apart from the ceremonies such decorative apparel appears to us
at first sight strange in the extreme. For dress, as we use it, is
comparatively simple. Besides the prime function of covering the
body, it has two other offices&mdash;that it creates beauty for the
eye, and that it attracts the admiration of your sex. Since
marriage until the year 1919&mdash;less than twenty years
ago&mdash;was the only profession open to us, the enormous
importance of dress to a woman can hardly be exaggerated. It was to
her what clients are to you&mdash;dress was her chief, perhaps her
only, method of becoming Lord Chancellor. But your dress in its
immense elaboration has obviously another function. It not only
covers nakedness, gratifies vanity, and creates pleasure for the
eye, but it serves to advertise the social, professional, or
intellectual standing of the wearer. If you will excuse the humble
illustration, your dress fulfils the same function as the tickets
in a grocer's shop. But, here, instead of saying 'This is
margarine; this pure butter; this is the finest butter in the
market,' it says, 'This man is a clever man&mdash;he is Master of
Arts; this man is a very clever man&mdash;he is Doctor of Letters;
this man is a most clever man&mdash;he is a Member of the Order of
Merit.' It is this function&mdash;the advertisement
function&mdash;of your dress that seems to us most singular. In the
opinion of St Paul, such advertisement, at any rate for our sex,
was unbecoming and immodest; until a very few years ago we were
denied the use of it. And still the tradition, or belief, lingers
among us that to express worth of any kind, whether intellectual or
moral, by wearing pieces of metal, or ribbon, coloured hoods or
gowns, is a barbarity which deserves the ridicule which we bestow
upon the rites of savages. A woman who advertised her motherhood by
a tuft of horsehair on the left shoulder would scarcely, you will
agree, be a venerable object.</p>

<p>But what light does our difference here throw upon the problem
before us? What connection is there between the sartorial
splendours of the educated man and the photograph of ruined houses
and dead bodies? Obviously the connection between dress and war is
not far to seek; your finest clothes are those that you wear as
soldiers. Since the red and the gold, the brass and the feathers
are discarded upon active service, it is plain that their expensive
and not, one might suppose, hygienic splendour is invented partly
in order to impress the beholder with the majesty of the military
office, partly in order through their vanity to induce young men to
become soldiers. Here, then, our influence and our difference might
have some effect; we, who are forbidden to wear such clothes
ourselves, can express the opinion that the wearer is not to us a
pleasing or an impressive spectacle. He is on the contrary a
ridiculous, a barbarous, a displeasing spectacle. But as the
daughters of educated men we can use our influence more effectively
in another direction, upon our own class&mdash;the class of
educated men. For there, in courts and universities, we find the
same love of dress. There, too, are velvet and silk, fur and
ermine. We can say that for educated men to emphasize their
superiority over other people, either in birth or intellect, by
dressing differently, or by adding titles before, or letters after
their names are acts that rouse competition and
jealousy&mdash;emotions which, as we need scarcely draw upon
biography to prove, nor ask psychology to show, have their share in
encouraging a disposition towards war. If then we express the
opinion that such distinctions make those who possess them
ridiculous and learning contemptible we should do something,
indirectly, to discourage the feelings that lead to war. Happily we
can now do more than express an opinion; we can refuse all such
distinctions and all such uniforms for ourselves. This would be a
slight but definite contribution to the problem before us&mdash;how
to prevent war; and one that a different training and a different
tradition puts more easily within our reach than within
yours.<sup><a href="#117">17</a></sup></p>

<p>But our bird's-eye view of the outside of things is not
altogether encouraging. The coloured photograph that we have been
looking at presents some remarkable features, it is true; but it
serves to remind us that there are many inner and secret chambers
that we cannot enter. What real influence can we bring to bear upon
law or business, religion or politics&mdash;we to whom many doors
are still locked, or at best ajar, we who have neither capital nor
force behind us? It seems as if our influence must stop short at
the surface. When we have expressed an opinion upon the surface we
have done all that we can do. It is true that the surface may have
some connection with the depths, but if we are to help you to
prevent war we must try to penetrate deeper beneath the skin. Let
us then look in another direction&mdash;in a direction natural to
educated men's daughters, in the direction of education itself.</p>

<p>Here, fortunately, the year, the sacred year 1919, comes to our
help. Since that year put it into the power of educated men's
daughters to earn their livings they have at last some real
influence upon education. They have money. They have money to
subscribe to causes. Honorary treasurers invoke their help. To
prove it, here, opportunely, cheek by jowl with your letter, is a
letter from one such treasurer asking for money with which to
rebuild a women's college. And when honorary treasurers invoke
help, it stands to reason that they can be bargained with. We have
the right to say to her, 'You shall only have our guinea with which
to help you rebuild your college if you will help this gentleman
whose letter also lies before us to prevent war.' We can say to
her, 'You must educate the young to hate war. You must teach them
to feel the inhumanity, the beastliness, the insupportability of
war.' But what kind of education shall we bargain for? What sort of
education will teach the young to hate war?</p>

<p>That is a question that is difficult enough in itself; and may
well seem unanswerable by those who are of Mary Kingsley's
persuasion&mdash;those who have had no direct experience of
university education themselves. Yet the part that education plays
in human life is so important, and the part that it might play in
answering your question is so considerable that to shirk any
attempt to see how we can influence the young through education
against war would be craven. Let us therefore turn from our station
on the bridge across the Thames to another bridge over another
river, this time in one of the great universities; for both have
rivers, and both have bridges, too, for us to stand upon. Once
more, how strange it looks, this world of domes and spires, of
lecture rooms and laboratories, from our vantage point! How
different it looks to us from what it must look to you! To those
who behold it from Mary Kingsley's angle&mdash;'being allowed to
learn German was <i>all</i> the paid education I ever had'&mdash;it
may well appear a world so remote, so formidable, so intricate in
its ceremonies and traditions that any criticism or comment may
well seem futile. Here, too, we marvel at the brilliance of your
clothes; here, too, we watch maces erect themselves and processions
form, and note with eyes too dazzled to record the differences, let
alone to explain them, the subtle distinctions of hats and hoods,
of purples and crimsons, of velvet and cloth, of cap and gown. It
is a solemn spectacle. The words of Arthur's song in
<i>Pendennis</i> rise to our lips:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Although I enter not,<br>
Yet round about the spot<br>
Sometimes I hover,<br>
And at the sacred gate,<br>
With longing eyes I wait,<br>
Expectant . . .</p>
</blockquote>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>and again,</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I will not enter there,<br>
To sully your pure prayer<br>
With thoughts unruly.<br>
But suffer me to pace<br>
Round the forbidden place,<br>
Lingering a minute,<br>
Like outcast spirits, who wait<br>
And see through Heaven's gate<br>
Angels within it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>But, since both you, Sir, and the honorary treasurer of the
college rebuilding fund are waiting for answers to your letters we
must cease to hang over old bridges humming old songs; we must
attempt to deal with the question of education, however
imperfectly.</p>

<p>What, then, is this 'university education' of which Mary
Kingsley's sisterhood have heard so much and to which they have
contributed so painfully? What is this mysterious process that
takes about three years to accomplish, costs a round sum in hard
cash, and turns the crude and raw human being into the finished
product&mdash;an educated man or woman? There can be no doubt in
the first place of its supreme value. The witness of
biography&mdash;that witness which any one who can read English can
consult on the shelves of any public library&mdash;is unanimous
upon this point; the value of education is among the greatest of
all human values. Biography proves this in two ways. First, there
is the fact that the great majority of the men who have ruled
England for the past 500 years, who are now ruling England in
Parliament and the Civil Service, have received a university
education. Second, there is the fact which is even more impressive
if you consider what toil, what privation it implies&mdash;and of
this, too, there is ample proof in biography&mdash;the fact of the
immense sum of money that has been spent upon education in the past
500 years. The income of Oxford University is &pound;435,656
(1933-4), the income of Cambridge University is &pound;212,000
(1930). In addition to the university income each college has its
own separate income, which, judging only from the gifts and
bequests announced from time to time in the newspapers, must in
some cases be of fabulous proportions.<sup><a href=
"#118">18</a></sup> If we add further the incomes enjoyed by the
great public schools&mdash;Eton, Harrow, Winchester, Rugby, to name
the largest only&mdash;so huge a sum of money is reached that there
can be no doubt of the enormous value that human beings place upon
education. And the study of biography&mdash;the lives of the poor,
of the obscure, of the uneducated&mdash;proves that they will make
any effort, any sacrifice to procure an education at one of the
great universities.<sup><a href="#119">19</a></sup></p>

<p>But perhaps the greatest testimony to the value of education
with which biography provides us is the fact that the sisters of
educated men not only made the sacrifices of comfort and pleasure,
which were needed in order to educate their brothers, but actually
desired to be educated themselves. When we consider the ruling of
the Church on this subject, a ruling which we learn from biography
was in force only a few years ago&mdash;'. . . I was told that
desire for learning in women was against the will of God, . .
.'<sup><a href="#120">20</a></sup>&mdash;we must allow that their
desire must have been strong. And if we reflect that all the
professions for which a university education fitted her brothers
were closed to her, her belief in the value of education must
appear still stronger, since she must have believed in education
for itself. And if we reflect further that the one profession that
was open to her&mdash;marriage&mdash;was held to need no education,
and indeed was of such a nature that education unfitted women to
practise it, then it would have been no surprise to find that she
had renounced any wish or attempt to be educated herself, but had
contented herself with providing education for her
brothers&mdash;the vast majority of women, the nameless, the poor,
by cutting down household expenses; the minute minority, the
titled, the rich, by founding or endowing colleges for men. This
indeed they did. But so innate in human nature is the desire for
education that you will find, if you consult biography, that the
same desire, in spite of all the impediments that tradition,
poverty and ridicule could put in its way, existed too among women.
To prove this let us examine one life only&mdash;the life of Mary
Astell.<sup><a href="#121">21</a></sup> Little is known about her,
but enough to show that almost 250 years ago this obstinate and
perhaps irreligious desire was alive in her; she actually proposed
to found a college for women. What is almost as remarkable, the
Princess Anne was ready to give her &pound;10,000&mdash;a very
considerable sum then, and, indeed, now, for any woman to have at
her disposal&mdash;towards the expenses. And then&mdash;then we
meet with a fact which is of extreme interest, both historically
and psychologically: the Church intervened. Bishop Burnet was of
opinion that to educate the sisters of educated men would be to
encourage the wrong branch, that is to say, the Roman Catholic
branch, of the Christian faith. The money went elsewhere; the
college was never founded.</p>

<p>But these facts, as facts so often do, prove double-faced; for
though they establish the value of education, they also prove that
education is by no means a positive value; it is not good in all
circumstances, and good for all people; it is only good for some
people and for some purposes. It is good if it produces a belief in
the Church of England; bad if it produces a belief in the Church of
Rome; it is good for one sex and for some professions, but bad for
another sex and for another profession.</p>

<p>Such at least would seem to be the answer of biography&mdash;the
oracle is not dumb, but it is dubious. As, however, it is of great
importance that we should use our influence through education to
affect the young against war we must not be baffled by the evasions
of biography or seduced by its charm. We must try to see what kind
of education an educated man's sister receives at present, in order
that we may do our utmost to use our influence in the universities
where it properly belongs, and where it will have most chance of
penetrating beneath the skin. Now happily we need no longer depend
upon biography, which inevitably, since it is concerned with the
private life, bristles with innumerable conflicts of private
opinion. We have now to help us that record of the public life
which is history. Even outsiders can consult the annals of those
public bodies which record not the day-to-day opinions of private
people, but use a larger accent and convey through the mouths of
Parliaments and Senates the considered opinions of bodies of
educated men.</p>

<p>History at once informs us that there are now, and have been
since about 1870, colleges for the sisters of educated men both at
Oxford and at Cambridge. But history also informs us of facts of
such a nature about those colleges that all attempt to influence
the young against war through the education they receive there must
be abandoned. In face of them it is mere waste of time and breath
to talk of 'influencing the young'; useless to lay down terms,
before allowing the honorary treasurer to have her guinea; better
to take the first train to London than to haunt the sacred gates.
But, you will interpose, what are these facts? these historical but
deplorable facts? Therefore let us place them before you, warning
you that they are taken only from such records as are available to
an outsider and from the annals of the university which is not your
own&mdash;Cambridge. Your judgement, therefore, will be undistorted
by loyalty to old ties, or gratitude for benefits received, but it
will be impartial and disinterested.</p>

<p>To begin then where we left off: Queen Anne died and Bishop
Burnet died and Mary Astell died; but the desire to found a college
for her own sex did not die. Indeed, it became stronger and
stronger. By the middle of the nineteenth century it became so
strong that a house was taken at Cambridge to lodge the students.
It was not a nice house; it was a house without a garden in the
middle of a noisy street. Then a second house was taken, a better
house this time, though it is true that the water rushed through
the dining-room in stormy weather and there was no playground. But
that house was not sufficient; the desire for education was so
urgent that more rooms were needed, a garden to walk in, a
playground to play in. Therefore another house was needed. Now
history tells us that in order to build this house, money was
needed. You will not question that fact but you may well question
the next&mdash;that the money was borrowed. It will seem to you
more probable that the money was given. The other colleges, you
will say, were rich; all derived their incomes indirectly, some
directly, from their sisters. There is Gray's <i>Ode</i> to prove
it. And you will quote the song with which he hails the
benefactors: the Countess of Pembroke who founded Pembroke; the
Countess of Clare who founded Clare; Margaret of Anjou who founded
Queens'; the Countess of Richmond and Derby who founded St John's
and Christ's.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What is grandeur, what is power?<br>
Heavier toil, superior pain.<br>
What the bright reward we gain?<br>
The grateful memory of the good.<br>
Sweet is the breath of vernal shower,<br>
The bee's collected treasures sweet,<br>
Sweet music's melting fall, but sweeter yet<br>
The still small voice of gratitude.<sup><a href=
"#122">22</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Here, you will say in sober prose, was an opportunity to repay
the debt. For what sum was needed? A beggarly
&pound;10,000&mdash;the very sum that the bishop intercepted about
two centuries previously. That &pound;10,000 surely was disgorged
by the Church that had swallowed it? But churches do not easily
disgorge what they have swallowed. Then the colleges, you will say,
which had benefited, they must have given it gladly in memory of
their noble benefactresses? What could &pound;10,000 mean to St
John's or Clare or Christ's? And the land belonged to St John's.
But the land, history says, was leased; and the &pound;10,000 was
not given; it was collected laboriously from private purses. Among
them one lady must be for ever remembered because she gave
&pound;1,000; and Anon. must receive whatever thanks Anon. will
consent to receive, because she gave sums ranging from &pound;20 to
&pound;100. And another lady was able, owing to a legacy from her
mother, to give her services as mistress without salary. And the
students themselves subscribed&mdash;so far as students
can&mdash;by making beds and washing dishes, by forgoing amenities
and living on simple fare. Ten thousand pounds is not at all a
beggarly sum when it has to be collected from the purses of the
poor, from the bodies of the young. It takes time, energy, brains,
to collect it, sacrifice to give it. Of course, several educated
men were very kind; they lectured to their sisters; others were not
so kind; they refused to lecture to their sisters. Some educated
men were very kind and encouraged their sisters; others were not so
kind, they discouraged their sisters.<sup><a href=
"#123">23</a></sup> Nevertheless, by hook or by crook, the day came
at last, history tells us, when somebody passed an examination. And
then the mistresses, principals or whatever they called
themselves&mdash;for the title that should be worn by a woman who
will not take a salary must be a matter of doubt&mdash;asked the
Chancellors and the Masters about whose titles there need be no
doubt, at any rate upon that score, whether the girls who had
passed examinations might advertise the fact as those gentlemen
themselves did by putting letters after their names. This was
advisable, because, as the present Master of Trinity, Sir J. J.
Thomson, O.M., F.R.S., after poking a little justifiable fun at the
'pardonable vanity' of those who put letters after their names,
informs us, 'the general public who have not taken a degree
themselves attach much more importance to B.A. after a person's
name than those who have. Head mistresses of schools therefore
prefer a belettered staff, so that students of Newnham and Girton,
since they could not put B.A. after their names, were at a
disadvantage in obtaining appointments.' And in Heaven's name, we
may both ask, what conceivable reason could there be for preventing
them from putting the letters B.A. after their names if it helped
them to obtain appointments? To that question history supplies no
answer; we must look for it in psychology, in biography; but
history supplies us with the fact. 'The proposal, however,' the
Master of Trinity continues&mdash;the proposal, that is, that those
who had passed examinations might call themselves B.A.&mdash;'met
with the most determined opposition . . . On the day of the voting
there was a great influx of non-residents and the proposal was
thrown out by the crushing majority of 1707 to 661. I believe the
number of voters has never been equalled . . . The behaviour of
some of the undergraduates after the poll was declared in the
Senate House was exceptionally deplorable and disgraceful. A large
band of them left the Senate House, proceeded to Newnham and
damaged the bronze gates which had been put up as a memorial to
Miss Clough, the first Principal.'<sup><a href=
"#124">24</a></sup></p>

<p>Is that not enough? Need we collect more facts from history and
biography to prove our statement that all attempt to influence the
young against war through the education they receive at the
universities must be abandoned? For do they not prove that
education, the finest education in the world, does not teach people
to hate force, but to use it? Do they not prove that education, far
from teaching the educated generosity and magnanimity, makes them
on the contrary so anxious to keep their possessions, that
'grandeur and power' of which the poet speaks, in their own hands,
that they will use not force but much subtler methods than force
when they are asked to share them? And are not force and
possessiveness very closely connected with war? Of what use then is
a university education in influencing people to prevent war? But
history goes on of course; year succeeds to year. The years change
things; slightly but imperceptibly they change them. And history
tells us that at last, after spending time and strength whose value
is immeasurable in repeatedly soliciting the authorities with the
humility expected of our sex and proper to suppliants the right to
impress head mistresses by putting the letters B.A. after the name
was granted. But that right, history tells us, was only a titular
right. At Cambridge, in the year 1937, the women's
colleges&mdash;you will scarcely believe it, Sir, but once more it
is the voice of fact that is speaking, not of fiction&mdash;the
women's colleges are not allowed to be members of the
university;<sup><a href="#125">25</a></sup> and the number of
educated men's daughters who are allowed to receive a university
education is still strictly limited; though both sexes contribute
to the university funds.<sup><a href="#126">26</a></sup> As for
poverty, <i>The Times</i> newspaper supplies us with figures; any
ironmonger will provide us with a foot-rule; if we measure the
money available for scholarships at the men's colleges with the
money available for their sisters at the women's colleges, we shall
save ourselves the trouble of adding up; and come to the conclusion
that the colleges for the sisters of educated men are, compared
with their brothers' colleges, unbelievably and shamefully
poor.<sup><a href="#127">27</a></sup></p>

<p>Proof of that last fact comes pat to hand in the honorary
treasurer's letter, asking for money with which to rebuild her
college. She has been asking for some time; she is still asking, it
seems. But there is nothing, after what has been said above, that
need puzzle us, either in the fact that she is poor, or in the fact
that her college needs rebuilding. What is puzzling, and has become
still more puzzling, in view of the facts given above, is this:
What answer ought we to make her when she asks us to help her to
rebuild her college? History, biography, and the daily paper
between them make it difficult either to answer her letter or to
dictate terms. For between them they have raised many questions. In
the first place, what reason is there to think that a university
education makes the educated against war? Again, if we help an
educated man's daughter to go to Cambridge are we not forcing her
to think not about education but about war?&mdash;not how she can
learn, but how she can fight in order that she may win the same
advantages as her brothers? Further, since the daughters of
educated men are not members of Cambridge University they have no
say in that education, therefore how can they alter that education
even if we ask them to? And then, of course, other questions
arise&mdash;questions of a practical nature, which will easily be
understood by a busy man, an honorary treasurer, like yourself,
Sir. You will be the first to agree that to ask people who are so
largely occupied in raising funds with which to rebuild a college
to consider the nature of education and what effect it can have
upon war is to heap another straw upon an already overburdened
back. From an outsider, moreover, who has no right to speak, such a
request may well deserve, and perhaps receive, a reply too forcible
to be quoted. But we have sworn that we will do all we can to help
you to prevent war by using our influence&mdash;our earned money
influence. And education is the obvious way. Since she is poor,
since she is asking for money, and since the giver of money is
entitled to dictate terms, let us risk it and draft a letter to
her, laying down the terms upon which she shall have our money to
help rebuild her college. Here, then, is an attempt:</p>

<p>'Your letter. Madam, has been waiting some time without an
answer. But certain doubts and questions have arisen. May we put
them to you, ignorantly as an outsider must, but frankly as an
outsider should when asked to contribute money? You say, then, that
you are asking for &pound;100,000 with which to rebuild your
college. But how can you be so foolish? Or are you so secluded
among the nightingales and the willows, or so busy with profound
questions of caps and gowns, and which is to walk first into the
Provost's drawing-room&mdash;the Master's pug or the Mistress's
pom&mdash;that you have no time to read the daily papers? Or are
you so harassed with the problem of drawing &pound;100,000
gracefully from an indifferent public that you can only think of
appeals and committees, bazaars and ices, strawberries and
cream?</p>

<p>'Let us then inform you: we are spending three hundred millions
annually upon the army and navy; for, according to a letter that
lies cheek by jowl with your own, there is grave danger of war. How
then can you seriously ask us to provide you with money with which
to rebuild your college? If you reply that the college was built on
the cheap, and that the college needs rebuilding, that may be true.
But when you go on to say that the public is generous, and that the
public is still capable of providing large sums for rebuilding
colleges, let us draw your attention to a significant passage in
the Master of Trinity's memoirs. It is this: "Fortunately, however,
soon after the beginning of this century the University began to
receive a succession of very handsome bequests and donations, and
these, aided by a liberal grant from the Government, have put the
finances of the University in such a good position that it has been
quite unnecessary to ask for any increase in the contribution from
the Colleges. The income of the University from all sources has
increased from about &pound;60,000 in 1900 to &pound;212,000 in
1930. It is not a very wild hypothesis to suppose that this has
been to a large extent due to the important and very interesting
discoveries which have been made in the University, and Cambridge
may be quoted as an example of the practical results which come
from Research for its own sake."</p>

<p>'Consider only that last sentence. ". . . Cambridge may be
quoted as an example of the practical results which come from
Research for its own sake." What has your college done to stimulate
great manufacturers to endow it? Have you taken a leading part in
the invention of the implements of war? How far have your students
succeeded in business as capitalists? How then can you expect "very
handsome bequests and donations" to come your way? Again, are you a
member of Cambridge University? You are not. How then can you
fairly ask for any say in their distribution? You can not.
Therefore, Madam, it is plain that you must stand at the door, cap
in hand, giving parties, spending your strength and your time in
soliciting subscriptions. That is plain. But it is also plain that
outsiders who find you thus occupied must ask themselves, when they
receive a request for a contribution towards rebuilding your
college, Shall I send it or shan't I? If I send it, what shall I
ask them to do with it? Shall I ask them to rebuild the college on
the old lines? Or shall I ask them to rebuild it, but differently?
Or shall I ask them to buy rags and petrol and Bryant &amp; May's
matches and burn the college to the ground?</p>

<p>'These are the questions, Madam, that have kept your letter so
long unanswered. They are questions of great difficulty and perhaps
they are useless questions. But can we leave them unasked in view
of this gentleman's questions? He is asking how can we help him to
prevent war? He is asking us how we can help him to defend liberty;
to defend culture? Also consider these photographs: they are
pictures of dead bodies and ruined houses. Surely in view of these
questions and pictures you must consider very carefully before you
begin to rebuild your college what is the aim of education, what
kind of society, what kind of human being it should seek to
produce. At any rate I will only send you a guinea with which to
rebuild your college if you can satisfy me that you will use it to
produce the kind of society, the kind of people that will help to
prevent war.</p>

<p>'Let us then discuss as quickly as we can the sort of education
that is needed. Now since history and biography&mdash;the only
evidence available to an outsider&mdash;seem to prove that the old
education of the old colleges breeds neither a particular respect
for liberty nor a particular hatred of war it is clear that you
must rebuild your college differently. It is young and poor; let it
therefore take advantage of those qualities and be founded on
poverty and youth. Obviously, then, it must be an experimental
college, an adventurous college. Let it be built on lines of its
own. It must be built not of carved stone and stained glass, but of
some cheap, easily combustible material which does not hoard dust
and perpetrate traditions. Do not have chapels.<sup><a href=
"#128">28</a></sup> Do not have museums and libraries with chained
books and first editions under glass cases. Let the pictures and
the books be new and always changing. Let it be decorated afresh by
each generation with their own hands cheaply. The work of the
living is cheap; often they will give it for the sake of being
allowed to do it. Next, what should be taught in the new college,
the poor college? Not the arts of dominating other people; not the
arts of ruling, of killing, of acquiring land and capital. They
require too many overhead expenses; salaries and uniforms and
ceremonies. The poor college must teach only the arts that can be
taught cheaply and practised by poor people; such as medicine,
mathematics, music, painting and literature. It should teach the
arts of human intercourse; the art of understanding other people's
lives and minds, and the little arts of talk, of dress, of cookery
that are allied with them. The aim of the new college, the cheap
college, should be not to segregate and specialize, but to combine.
It should explore the ways in which mind and body can be made to
cooperate; discover what new combinations make good wholes in human
life. The teachers should be drawn from the good livers as well as
from the good thinkers. There should be no difficulty in attracting
them. For there would be none of the barriers of wealth and
ceremony, of advertisement and competition which now make the old
and rich universities such uneasy dwelling-places&mdash;cities of
strife, cities where this is locked up and that is chained down;
where nobody can walk freely or talk freely for fear of
transgressing some chalk mark, of displeasing some dignitary. But
if the college were poor it would have nothing to offer;
competition would be abolished. Life would be open and easy. People
who love learning for itself would gladly come there. Musicians,
painters, writers, would teach there, because they would learn.
What could be of greater help to a writer than to discuss the art
of writing with people who were thinking not of examinations or
degrees or of what honour or profit they could make literature give
them but of the art itself?</p>

<p>'And so with the other arts and artists. They would come to the
poor college and practise their arts there because it would be a
place where society was free; not parcelled out into the miserable
distinctions of rich and poor, of clever and stupid; but where all
the different degrees and kinds of mind, body and soul merit
cooperated. Let us then found this new college; this poor college;
in which learning is sought for itself; where advertisement is
abolished; and there are no degrees; and lectures are not given,
and sermons are not preached, and the old poisoned vanities and
parades which breed competition and jealousy . . .'</p>

<p>The letter broke off there. It was not from lack of things to
say; the peroration indeed was only just beginning. It was because
the face on the other side of the page&mdash;the face that a
letter-writer always sees&mdash;appeared to be fixed with a certain
melancholy, upon a passage in the book from which quotation has
already been made. 'Head mistresses of schools therefore prefer a
belettered staff, so that students of Newnham and Girton, since
they could not put B.A. after their name, were at a disadvantage in
obtaining appointments.' The honorary treasurer of the Rebuilding
Fund had her eyes fixed on that. 'What is the use of thinking how a
college can be different,' she seemed to say, 'when it must be a
place where students are taught to obtain appointments?' 'Dream
your dreams,' she seemed to add, turning, rather wearily, to the
table which she was arranging for some festival, a bazaar
presumably, 'but we have to face realities.'</p>

<p>That then was the 'reality' on which her eyes were fixed;
students must be taught to earn their livings. And since that
reality meant that she must rebuild her college on the same lines
as the others, it followed that the college for the daughters of
educated men must also make Research produce practical results
which will induce bequests and donations from rich men; it must
encourage competition; it must accept degrees and coloured hoods;
it must accumulate great wealth; it must exclude other people from
a share of its wealth; and, therefore, in 500 years or so, that
college, too, must ask the same question that you, Sir, are asking
now: 'How in your opinion are we to prevent war?'</p>

<p>An undesirable result that seemed; why then subscribe a guinea
to procure it? That question at any rate was answered. No guinea of
earned money should go to rebuilding the college on the old plan;
just as certainly none could be spent upon building a college upon
a new plan; therefore the guinea should be earmarked 'Rags. Petrol.
Matches'. And this note should be attached to it. 'Take this guinea
and with it burn the college to the ground. Set fire to the old
hypocrisies. Let the light of the burning building scare the
nightingales and incarnadine the willows. And let the daughters of
educated men dance round the fire and heap armful upon armful of
dead leaves upon the flames. And let their mothers lean from the
upper windows and cry "Let it blaze! Let it blaze! For we have done
with this 'education'!"'</p>

<p>That passage, Sir, is not empty rhetoric, for it is based upon
the respectable opinion of the late headmaster of Eton, the present
Dean of Durham.<sup><a href="#129">29</a></sup> Nevertheless, there
is something hollow about it, as is shown by a moment's conflict
with fact. We have said that the only influence which the daughters
of educated men can at present exert against war is the
disinterested influence that they possess through earning their
livings. If there were no means of training them to earn their
livings, there would be an end of that influence. They could not
obtain appointments. If they could not obtain appointments they
would again be dependent upon their fathers and brothers; and if
they were again dependent upon their fathers and brothers they
would again be consciously and unconsciously in favour of war.
History would seem to put that beyond doubt. Therefore we must send
a guinea to the honorary treasurer of the college rebuilding fund,
and let her do what she can with it. It is useless as things are to
attach conditions as to the way in which that guinea is to be
spent.</p>

<p>Such then is the rather lame and depressing answer to our
question whether we can ask the authorities of the colleges for the
daughters of educated men to use their influence through education
to prevent war. It appears that we can ask them to do nothing; they
must follow the old road to the old end; our own influence as
outsiders can only be of the most indirect sort. If we are asked to
teach, we can examine very carefully into the aim of such teaching,
and refuse to teach any art or science that encourages war.
Further, we can pour mild scorn upon chapels, upon degrees, and
upon the value of examinations. We can intimate that a prize poem
can still have merit in spite of the fact that it has won a prize;
and maintain that a book may still be worth reading in spite of the
fact that its author took a first class with honours in the English
tripos. If we are asked to lecture we can refuse to bolster up the
vain and vicious system of lecturing by refusing to
lecture.<sup><a href="#130">30</a></sup> And, of course, if we are
offered offices and honours for ourselves we can refuse
them&mdash;how, indeed, in view of the facts, could we possibly do
otherwise? But there is no blinking the fact that in the present
state of things the most effective way in which we can help you
through education to prevent war is to subscribe as generously as
possible to the colleges for the daughters of educated men. For, to
repeat, if those daughters are not going to be educated they are
not going to earn their livings, if they are not going to earn
their livings, they are going once more to be restricted to the
education of the private house; and if they are going to be
restricted to the education of the private house they are going,
once more, to exert all their influence both consciously and
unconsciously in favour of war. Of that there can be little doubt.
Should you doubt it, should you ask proof, let us once more consult
biography. Its testimony upon this point is so conclusive, but so
voluminous, that we must try to condense many volumes into one
story. Here, then, is the narrative of the life of an educated
man's daughter who was dependent upon father and brother in the
private house of the nineteenth century.</p>

<p>The day was hot, but she could not go out. 'How many a long dull
summer's day have I passed immured indoors because there was no
room for me in the family carriage and no lady's maid who had time
to walk out with me.' The sun set; and out she went at last,
dressed as well as could be managed upon an allowance of from
&pound;40 to &pound;100 a year.<sup><a href="#131">31</a></sup> But
'to any sort of entertainment she must be accompanied by father or
mother or by some married woman.' Whom did she meet at those
entertainments thus dressed, thus accompanied? Educated
men&mdash;'cabinet ministers, ambassadors, famous soldiers and the
like, all splendidly dressed, wearing decorations.' What did they
talk about? Whatever refreshed the minds of busy men who wanted to
forget their own work&mdash;'the gossip of the dancing world' did
very well. The days passed. Saturday came. On Saturday 'M.P.s and
other busy men had leisure to enjoy society'; they came to tea and
they came to dinner. Next day was Sunday. On Sundays 'the great
majority of us went as a matter of course to morning church.' The
seasons changed. It was summer. In the summer they entertained
visitors, 'mostly relatives' in the country. Now it was winter. In
the winter 'they studied history and literature and music, and
tried to draw and paint. If they did not produce anything
remarkable they learnt much in the process.' And so with some
visiting the sick and teaching the poor, the years passed. And what
was the great end and aim of these years, of that education?
Marriage, of course. '. . . it was not a question of <i>whether</i>
we should marry, but simply of whom we should marry,' says one of
them. It was with a view to marriage that her mind was taught. It
was with a view to marriage that she tinkled on the piano, but was
not allowed to join an orchestra; sketched innocent domestic
scenes, but was not allowed to study from the nude; read this book,
but was not allowed to read that, charmed, and talked. It was with
a view to marriage that her body was educated; a maid was provided
for her; that the streets were shut to her; that the fields were
shut to her; that solitude was denied her&mdash;all this was
enforced upon her in order that she might preserve her body intact
for her husband. In short, the thought of marriage influenced what
she said, what she thought, what she did. How could it be
otherwise? Marriage was the only profession open to
her.<sup><a href="#132">32</a></sup></p>

<p>The sight is so curious for what it shows of the educated man as
well as of his daughter that it is tempting to linger. The
influence of the pheasant upon love alone deserves a chapter to
itself.<sup><a href="#133">33</a></sup> But we are not asking now
the interesting question, what was the effect of that education
upon the race? We are asking why did such an education make the
person so educated consciously and unconsciously in favour of war?
Because consciously, it is obvious, she was forced to use whatever
influence she possessed to bolster up the system which provided her
with maids; with carriages; with fine clothes; with fine
parties&mdash;it was by these means that she achieved marriage.
Consciously she must use whatever charm or beauty she possessed to
flatter and cajole the busy men, the soldiers, the lawyers, the
ambassadors, the cabinet ministers who wanted recreation after
their day's work. Consciously she must accept their views, and fall
in with their decrees because it was only so that she could wheedle
them into giving her the means to marry or marriage
itself.<sup><a href="#134">34</a></sup> In short, all her conscious
effort must be in favour of what Lady Lovelace called 'our splendid
Empire' . . . 'the price of which,' she added, 'is mainly paid by
women.' And who can doubt her, or that the price was heavy?</p>

<p>But her unconscious influence was even more strongly perhaps in
favour of war. How else can we explain that amazing outburst in
August 1914, when the daughters of educated men who had been
educated thus rushed into hospitals, some still attended by their
maids, drove lorries, worked in fields and munition factories, and
used all their immense stores of charm, of sympathy, to persuade
young men that to fight was heroic, and that the wounded in battle
deserved all her care and all her praise? The reason lies in that
same education. So profound was her unconscious loathing for the
education of the private house with its cruelty, its poverty, its
hypocrisy, its immorality, its inanity that she would undertake any
task however menial, exercise any fascination however fatal that
enabled her to escape. Thus consciously she desired 'our splendid
Empire'; unconsciously she desired our splendid war.</p>

<p>So, Sir, if you want us to help you to prevent war the
conclusion seems to be inevitable; we must help to rebuild the
college which, imperfect as it may be, is the only alternative to
the education of the private house. We must hope that in time that
education may be altered. That guinea must be given before we give
you the guinea that you ask for your own society. But it is
contributing to the same cause&mdash;the prevention of war. Guineas
are rare; guineas are valuable, but let us send one without any
condition attached to the honorary treasurer of the building fund,
because by so doing we are making a positive contribution to the
prevention of war.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch2" id="ch2"></a>Two</h2>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Now that we have given one guinea towards rebuilding a college
we must consider whether there is not more that we can do to help
you to prevent war. And it is at once obvious, if what we have said
about influence is true, that we must turn to the professions,
because if we could persuade those who can earn their livings, and
thus actually hold in their hands this new weapon, our only weapon,
the weapon of independent opinion based upon independent income, to
use that weapon against war, we should do more to help you than by
appealing to those who must teach the young to earn their livings;
or by lingering, however long, round the forbidden places and
sacred gates of the universities where they are thus taught. This,
therefore, is a more important question than the other.</p>

<p>Let us then lay your letter asking for help to prevent war,
before the independent, the mature, those who are earning their
livings in the professions. There is no need of rhetoric; hardly,
one would suppose, of argument. 'Here is a man,' one has only to
say, 'whom we all have reason to respect; he tells us that war is
possible; perhaps probable; he asks us, who can earn our livings,
to help him in any way we can to prevent war.' That surely will be
enough without pointing to the photographs that are all this time
piling up on the table&mdash;photographs of more dead bodies, of
more ruined houses, to call forth an answer, and an answer that
will give you, Sir, the very help that you require. But . . . it
seems that there is some hesitation, some doubt&mdash;not certainly
that war is horrible, that war is beastly, that war is
insupportable and that war is inhuman, as Wilfred Owen said, or
that we wish to do all we can to help you to prevent war.
Nevertheless, doubts and hesitations there are; and the quickest
way to understand them is to place before you another letter, a
letter as genuine as your own, a letter that happens to lie beside
it on the table.<sup><a href="#201">1</a></sup></p>

<p>It is a letter from another honorary treasurer, and it is again
asking for money. 'Will you,' she writes, 'send a subscription to'
[a society to help the daughters of educated men to obtain
employment in the professions] 'in order to help us to earn our
livings? Failing money,' she goes on, 'any gift will be
acceptable&mdash;books, fruit or cast-off clothing that can be sold
in a bazaar.' Now that letter has so much bearing upon the doubts
and hesitations referred to above, and upon the help we can give
you, that it seems impossible either to send her a guinea or to
send you a guinea until we have considered the questions which it
raises.</p>

<p>The first question is obviously, Why is she asking for money?
Why is she so poor, this representative of professional women, that
she must beg for cast-off clothing for a bazaar? That is the first
point to clear up, because if she is as poor as this letter
indicates, then the weapon of independent opinion upon which we
have been counting to help you to prevent war is not, to put it
mildly, a very powerful weapon. On the other hand, poverty has its
advantages; for if she is poor, as poor as she pretends to be, then
we can bargain with her, as we bargained with her sister at
Cambridge, and exercise the right of potential givers to impose
terms. Let us then question her about her financial position and
certain other facts before we give her a guinea, or lay down the
terms upon which she is to have it. Here is the draft of such a
letter:</p>

<p>'Accept a thousand apologies, Madam, for keeping you waiting so
long for an answer to your letter. The fact is, certain questions
have arisen, to which we must ask you to reply before we send you a
subscription. In the first place you are asking for
money&mdash;money with which to pay your rent. But how can it be,
how can it possibly be, my dear Madam, that you are so terribly
poor? The professions have been open to the daughters of educated
men for almost 20 years. Therefore, how can it be, that you, whom
we take to be their representative, are standing, like your sister
at Cambridge, hat in hand, pleading for money, or failing money,
for fruit, books, or cast-off clothing to sell at a bazaar? How can
it be, we repeat? Surely there must be some very grave defect, of
common humanity, of common justice, or of common sense. Or can it
simply be that you are pulling a long face and telling a tall story
like the beggar at the street corner who has a stocking full of
guineas safely hoarded under her bed at home? In any case, this
perpetual asking for money and pleading of poverty is laying you
open to very grave rebukes, not only from indolent outsiders who
dislike thinking about practical affairs almost as much as they
dislike signing cheques, but from educated men. You are drawing
upon yourselves the censure and contempt of men of established
reputation as philosophers and novelists&mdash;of men like Mr Joad
and Mr Wells. Not only do they deny your poverty, but they accuse
you of apathy and indifference. Let me draw your attention to the
charges that they bring against you. Listen, in the first place, to
what Mr C. E. M. Joad has to say of you. He says: "I doubt whether
at any time during the last fifty years young women have been more
politically apathetic, more socially indifferent than at the
present time." That is how he begins. And he goes on to say, very
rightly, that it is not his business to tell you what you ought to
do; but he adds, very kindly, that he will give you an example of
what you might do. You might imitate your sisters in America. You
might found "a society for the advertisement of peace". He gives an
example. This society explained, "I know not with what truth, that
the number of pounds spent by the world on armaments in the current
year was exactly equal to the number of minutes (or was it
seconds?) which had elapsed since the death of Christ, who taught
that war is unchristian . . ." Now why should not you, too, follow
their example and create such a society in England? It would need
money, of course; but&mdash;and this is the point that I wish
particularly to emphasize&mdash;there can be no doubt that you have
the money. Mr Joad provides the proof. "Before the war money poured
into the coffers of the W.S.P.U. in order that women might win the
vote which, it was hoped, would enable them to make war a thing of
the past. The vote is won," Mr Joad continues, "but war is very far
from being a thing of the past." That I can corroborate
myself&mdash;witness this letter from a gentleman asking for help
to prevent war, and there are certain photographs of dead bodies
and ruined houses&mdash;but let Mr Joad continue. "Is it
unreasonable," he goes on, "to ask that contemporary women should
be prepared to give as much energy and money, to suffer as much
obloquy and insult in the cause of peace, as their mothers gave and
suffered in the cause of equality?" And again, I cannot help but
echo, is it unreasonable to ask women to go on, from generation to
generation, suffering obloquy and insult first from their brothers
and then for their brothers? Is it not both perfectly reasonable
and on the whole for their physical, moral and spiritual welfare?
But let us not interrupt Mr Joad. "If it is, then the sooner they
give up the pretence of playing with public affairs and return to
private life the better. If they cannot make a job of the House of
Commons, let them at least make something of their own houses. If
they cannot learn to save men from the destruction which incurable
male mischievousness bids fair to bring upon them, let women at
least learn to feed them, before they destroy
themselves."<sup><a href="#202">2</a></sup> Let us not pause to ask
how even with a vote they can cure what Mr Joad himself admits to
be incurable, for the point is how, in the face of that statement,
you have the effrontery to ask me for a guinea towards your rent?
According to Mr Joad you are not only extremely rich; you are also
extremely idle; and so given over to the eating of peanuts and ice
cream that you have not learnt how to cook him a dinner before he
destroys himself, let alone how to prevent that fatal act. But more
serious charges are to follow. Your lethargy is such that you will
not fight even to protect the freedom which your mothers won for
you. That charge is made against you by the most famous of living
English novelists&mdash;Mr H. G. Wells. Mr H. G. Wells says, "There
has been no perceptible woman's movement to resist the practical
obliteration of their freedom by Fascists or Nazis."<sup><a href=
"#203">3</a></sup> Rich, idle, greedy and lethargic as you are, how
have you the effrontery to ask me to subscribe to a society which
helps the daughters of educated men to make their livings in the
professions? For as these gentlemen prove in spite of the vote and
the wealth which that vote must have brought with it, you have not
ended war; in spite of the vote and the power which that vote must
have brought with it, you have not resisted the practical
obliteration of your freedom by Fascists or Nazis. What other
conclusion then can one come to but that the whole of what was
called "the woman's movement" has proved itself a failure; and the
guinea which I am sending you herewith is to be devoted not to
paying your rent but to burning your building. And when that is
burnt, retire once more to the kitchen, Madam, and learn, if you
can, to cook the dinner which you may not share . . .'<sup><a href=
"#204">4</a></sup></p>

<p>There, Sir, the letter stopped; for on the face at the other
side of the letter&mdash;the face that a letter-writer always
sees&mdash;was an expression, of boredom was it, or was it of
fatigue? The honorary treasurer's glance seemed to rest upon a
little scrap of paper upon which were written two dull little facts
which, since they have some bearing upon the question we are
discussing, how the daughters of educated men who are earning their
livings in the professions can help you to prevent war, may be
copied here. The first fact was that the income of the W.S.P.U.
upon which Mr Joad has based his estimate of their wealth was (in
the year 1912 at the height of their activity)
&pound;42,000.<sup><a href="#205">5</a></sup> The second fact was
that: 'To earn &pound;250 a year is quite an achievement even for a
highly qualified woman with years of experience.'<sup><a href=
"#206">6</a></sup> The date of that statement is 1934.</p>

<p>Both facts are interesting; and since both have a direct bearing
upon the question before us, let us examine them. To take the first
fact first&mdash;that is interesting because it shows that one of
the greatest political changes of our times was accomplished upon
the incredibly minute income of &pound;42,000 a year. 'Incredibly
minute' is, of course, a comparative term; it is incredibly minute,
that is to say, compared with the income which the Conservative
party, or the Liberal party&mdash;the parties to which the educated
woman's brother belonged&mdash;had at their disposal for their
political causes. It is considerably less than the income which the
Labour party&mdash;the party to which the working woman's brother
belongs&mdash;has at their disposal.<sup><a href="#207">7</a></sup>
It is incredibly minute compared with the sums that a society like
the Society for the Abolition of Slavery for example had at its
disposal for the abolition of that slavery. It is incredibly minute
compared with the sums which the educated man spends annually, not
upon political causes, but upon sports and pleasure. But our
amazement, whether at the poverty of educated men's daughters or at
their economy, is a decidedly unpleasant emotion in this case, for
it forces us to suspect that the honorary treasurer is telling the
sober truth; she is poor; and it forces us to ask once more how, if
&pound;42,000 was all that the daughters of educated men could
collect after many years of indefatigable labour for their own
cause, they can help you to win yours? How much peace will
&pound;42,000 a year buy at the present moment when we are spending
&pound;300,000,000 annually upon arms?</p>

<p>But the second fact is the more startling and the more
depressing of the two&mdash;the fact that now, almost 20 years,
that is, after they have been admitted to the money-making
professions 'to earn &pound;250 a year is quite an achievement even
for a highly qualified woman with years of experience.' Indeed,
that fact, if it is a fact, is so startling and has so much bearing
upon the question before us that we must pause for a moment to
examine it. It is so important that it must be examined, moreover,
by the white light of facts, not by the coloured light of
biography. Let us have recourse then to some impersonal and
impartial authority who has no more axe to grind or dinner to cook
than Cleopatra's Needle&mdash;Whitaker's Almanack, for example.</p>

<p>Whitaker, needless to say, is not only one of the most
dispassionate of authors, but one of the most methodical. There, in
his Almanack he has collected all the facts about all, or almost
all, of the professions that have been opened to the daughters of
educated men. In a section called 'Government and Public Offices'
he provides us with a plain statement of whom the Government
employs professionally, and of what the Government pays those whom
it employs. Since Whitaker adopts the alphabetical system, let us
follow his lead and examine the first six letters of the alphabet.
Under A there are the Admiralty, the Air Ministry, and Ministry of
Agriculture. Under B there is the British Broadcasting Corporation;
under C the Colonial Office and the Charity Commissioners; under D
the Dominions Office and Development Commission; under E there are
the Ecclesiastical Commissioners and the Board of Education; and so
we come to the sixth letter F under which we find the Ministry of
Fisheries, the Foreign Office, the Friendly Societies and the Fine
Arts. These then are some of the professions which are now, as we
are frequently reminded, open to both men and women equally. And
the salaries paid to those employed in them come out of public
money which is supplied by both sexes equally. And the income tax
which supplies those salaries (among other things) now stands at
about five shillings in the pound. We have all, therefore, an
interest in asking how that money is spent, and upon whom. Let us
look at the salary list of the Board of Education, since that is
the class to which we both, Sir, though in very different degrees,
have the honour to belong. The President, Whitaker says, of the
Board of Education, gets &pound;2,000; his principal Private
Secretary gets from &pound;847 to &pound;1,058; his Assistant
Private Secretary gets from &pound;277 to &pound;634. Then there is
the Permanent Secretary of the Board of Education. He gets
&pound;3,000; his Private Secretary gets from &pound;277 to
&pound;634. The Parliamentary Secretary gets &pound;1,200; his
Private Secretary gets from &pound;277 to &pound;634. The Deputy
Secretary gets &pound;2,200. The Permanent Secretary of the Welsh
Department gets &pound;1,650. And then there are Principal
Assistant Secretaries and Assistant Secretaries, there are
Directors of Establishments, Accountants-General, principal Finance
Officers, Finance Officers, Legal Advisers, Assistant Legal
Advisers&mdash;all these ladies and gentlemen, the impeccable and
impartial Whitaker informs us, get incomes which run into four
figures or over. Now an income which is over or about a thousand a
year is a nice round sum when it is paid yearly and paid
punctually; but when we consider that the work is a whole-time job
and a skilled job we shall not grudge these ladies and gentlemen
their salaries, even though our income tax does stand at five
shillings in the pound, and our incomes are by no means paid
punctually or paid annually. Men and women who spend every day and
all day in an office from the age of about 23 to the age of 60 or
so deserve every penny they get. Only, the reflection will intrude
itself, if these ladies are drawing &pound;1,000, &pound;2,000 and
&pound;3,000 a year, not only in the Board of Education, but in all
the other boards and offices which are now open to them, from the
Admiralty at the beginning of the alphabet to the Board of Works at
the end, the statement that '&pound;250 is quite an achievement,
even for a highly qualified woman with years of experience' must
be, to put it plainly, an unmitigated lie. Why, we have only to
walk down Whitehall; consider how many boards and offices are
housed there; reflect that each is staffed and officered by a flock
of secretaries and under-secretaries so many and so nicely graded
that their very names make our heads spin; and remember that each
has his or her own sufficient salary, to exclaim that the statement
is impossible, inexplicable. How can we explain it? Only by putting
on a stronger pair of glasses. Let us read down the list, further
and further and further down. At last we come to a name to which
the prefix 'Miss' is attached. Can it be that all the names on top
of hers, all the names to which the big salaries are attached, are
the names of gentlemen? It seems so. So then it is not the salaries
that are lacking; it is the daughters of educated men.</p>

<p>Now three good reasons for this curious deficiency or disparity
lie upon the surface. Dr Robson supplies us with the
first&mdash;'The Administrative Class, which occupies all the
controlling positions in the Home Civil Service, consists to an
overwhelming extent of the fortunate few who can manage to get to
Oxford and Cambridge; and the entrance examination has always been
expressly designed for that purpose.'<sup><a href=
"#208">8</a></sup> The fortunate few in our class, the daughters of
educated men class, are very, very few. Oxford and Cambridge, as we
have seen, strictly limit the number of educated men's daughters
who are allowed to receive a university education. Secondly, many
more daughters stay at home to look after old mothers than sons
stay at home to look after old fathers. The private house, we must
remember, is still a going concern. Hence fewer daughters than sons
enter for the Civil Service Examination. In the third place, we may
fairly assume that 60 years of examination passing are not so
effective as 500. The Civil Service Examination is a stiff one; we
may reasonably expect more sons to pass it than daughters. We have
nevertheless to explain the curious fact that though a certain
number of daughters enter for the examination and pass the
examination those to whose names the word 'Miss' is attached do not
seem to enter the four-figure zone. The sex distinction seems,
according to Whitaker, possessed of a curious leaden quality,
liable to keep any name to which it is fastened circling in the
lower spheres. Plainly the reason for this may lie not upon the
surface, but within. It may be, to speak bluntly, that the
daughters are in themselves deficient; that they have proved
themselves untrustworthy; unsatisfactory; so lacking in the
necessary ability that it is to the public interest to keep them to
the lower grades where, if they are paid less, they have less
chance of impeding the transaction of public business. This
solution would be easy but, unfortunately, it is denied to us. It
is denied to us by the Prime Minister himself. Women in the Civil
Services are not untrustworthy, Mr Baldwin* informed us the other
day. 'Many of them,' he said, 'are in positions in the course of
their daily work to amass secret information. Secret information
has a way of leaking very often, as we politicians know to our
cost. I have never known a case of such a leakage being due to a
woman, and I have known cases of leakage coming from men who should
have known a great deal better.' So they are not so loose-lipped
and fond of gossip as the tradition would have it? A useful
contribution in its way to psychology and a hint to novelists; but
still there may be other objections to women's employment as Civil
Servants.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>* Since these words were written Mr Baldwin has ceased to be
Prime Minister and become an Earl.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Intellectually, they may not be so able as their brothers. But
here again the Prime Minister will not help us out. 'He was not
prepared to say that any conclusion had been formed&mdash;or was
even necessary&mdash;whether women were as good as, or better than,
men, but he believed that women had worked in the Civil Service to
their own content, and certainly to the complete satisfaction of
everybody who had anything to do with them.' Finally, as if to cap
what must necessarily be an inconclusive statement by expressing a
personal opinion which might rightly be more positive he said, 'I
should like to pay my personal tribute to the industry, capacity,
ability and loyalty of the women I have come across in Civil
Service positions.' And he went on to express the hope that
business men would make more use of those very valuable
qualities.<sup><a href="#209">9</a></sup></p>

<p>Now if anyone is in a position to know the facts it is the Prime
Minister; and if anyone is able to speak the truth about them it is
the same gentleman. Yet Mr Baldwin says one thing; Mr Whitaker says
another. If Mr Baldwin is well informed, so is Mr Whitaker.
Nevertheless, they contradict each other. The issue is joined; Mr
Baldwin says that women are first-class civil servants; Mr Whitaker
says that they are third-class civil servants. It is, in short, a
case of <i>Baldwin</i> v. <i>Whitaker,</i> and since it is a very
important case, for upon it depends the answer to many questions
which puzzle us, not only about the poverty of educated men's
daughters but about the psychology of educated men's sons, let us
try the case of the <i>Prime Minister</i> v. <i>the
Almanack.</i></p>

<p>For such a trial you, Sir, have definite qualifications; as a
barrister you have first-hand knowledge of one profession, and as
an educated man second-hand knowledge of many more. And if it is
true that the daughters of educated men who are of Mary Kingsley's
persuasion have no direct knowledge, still through fathers and
uncles, cousins and brothers they may claim some indirect knowledge
of professional life&mdash;it is a photograph that they have often
looked upon&mdash;and this indirect knowledge they can improve, if
they have a mind, by peeping through doors, taking notes, and
asking questions discreetly. If, then, we pool our first-hand,
secondhand, direct and indirect knowledge of the professions with a
view to trying the important case of <i>Baldwin</i> v.
<i>Whitaker</i> we shall agree at the outset that professions are
very queer things. It by no means follows that a clever man gets to
the top or that a stupid man stays at the bottom. This rising and
falling is by no means a cut-and-dried clear-cut rational process,
we shall both agree. After all, as we both have reason to know,
Judges are fathers; and Permanent Secretaries have sons. Judges
require marshals; Permanent Secretaries, private secretaries. What
is more natural than that a nephew should be a marshal or the son
of an old school friend a private secretary? To have such
perquisites in their gift is as much the due of the public servant
as a cigar now and then or a cast-off dress here and there are
perquisites of the private servant. But the giving of such
perquisites, the exercise of such influence, queers the
professions. Success is easier for some, harder for others, however
equal the brain power may be so that some rise unexpectedly; some
fall unexpectedly; some remain strangely stationary; with the
result that the professions are queered. Often indeed it is the
public advantage that they should be queered. Since nobody, from
the Master of Trinity downwards (bating, presumably, a few Head
Mistresses), believes in the infallibility of examiners, a certain
degree of elasticity is to the public advantage; since the
impersonal is fallible, it is well that it should be supplemented
by the personal. Happily for us all, therefore, we may conclude, a
board is not made literally of oak, nor a division of iron. Both
boards and divisions transmit human sympathies, and reflect human
antipathies with the result that the imperfections of the
examination system are rectified; the public interest is served;
and the ties of blood and friendship are recognized. Thus it is
quite possible that the name 'Miss' transmits through the board or
division some vibration which is not registered in the examination
room. 'Miss' transmits sex; and sex may carry with it an aroma.
'Miss' may carry with it the swish of petticoats, the savour of
scent or other odour perceptible to the nose on the further side of
the partition and obnoxious to it. What charms and consoles in the
private house may distract and exacerbate in the public office. The
Archbishops' Commission assures us that this is so in the
pulpit.<sup><a href="#210">10</a></sup> Whitehall may be equally
susceptible. At any rate since Miss is a woman, Miss was not
educated at Eton or Christ Church. Since Miss is a woman, Miss is
not a son or a nephew. We are hazarding our way among
imponderables. We can scarcely proceed too much on tiptoe. We are
trying, remember, to discover what flavour attaches itself to sex
in a public office; we are sniffing most delicately not facts but
savours. And therefore it would be well not to depend on our own
private noses, but to call in evidence from outside. Let us turn to
the public press and see if we can discover from the opinions aired
there any hint that will guide us in our attempt to decide the
delicate and difficult question as to the aroma, the atmosphere
that surrounds the word 'Miss' in Whitehall. We will consult the
newspapers.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>First:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I think your correspondent . . . correctly sums up this
discussion in the observation that woman has too much liberty. It
is probable that this so-called liberty came with the war, when
women assumed responsibilities so far unknown to them. They did
splendid service during those days. Unfortunately, they were
praised and petted out of all proportion to the value of their
performances.<sup><a href="#211">11</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>That does very well for a beginning. But let us proceed:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I am of the opinion that a considerable amount of the distress
which is prevalent in this section of the community [the clerical]
could be relieved by the policy of employing men instead of women,
wherever possible. There are today in Government offices, post
offices, insurance companies, banks and other offices, thousands of
women doing work which men could do. At the same time there are
thousands of qualified men, young and middle-aged, who cannot get a
job of any sort. There is a large demand for woman labour in the
domestic arts, and in the process of regrading a large number of
women who have drifted into clerical service would become available
for domestic service.<sup><a href="#212">12</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The odour thickens, you will agree.</p>

<p>Then once more:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I am certain I voice the opinion of thousands of young men when
I say that if men were doing the work that thousands of young women
are now doing the men would be able to keep those same women in
decent homes. Homes are the real places of the women who are now
compelling men to be idle. It is time the Government insisted upon
employers giving work to more men, thus enabling them to marry the
women they cannot now approach.<sup><a href="#213">13</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>There! There can be no doubt of the odour now. The cat is out of
the bag; and it is a Tom.</p>

<p>After considering the evidence contained in those three
quotations, you will agree that there is good reason to think that
the word 'Miss', however delicious its scent in the private house,
has a certain odour attached to it in Whitehall which is
disagreeable to the noses on the other side of the partition; and
that it is likely that a name to which 'Miss' is attached will,
because of this odour, circle in the lower spheres where the
salaries are small rather than mount to the higher spheres where
the salaries are substantial. As for 'Mrs', it is a contaminated
word; an obscene word. The less said about that word the better.
Such is the smell of it, so rank does it stink in the nostrils of
Whitehall, that Whitehall excludes it entirely. In Whitehall as in
heaven, there is neither marrying nor giving in
marriage.<sup><a href="#214">14</a></sup></p>

<p>Odour then&mdash;or shall we call it 'atmosphere'?&mdash;is a
very important element in professional life; in spite of the fact
that like other important elements it is impalpable. It can escape
the noses of examiners in examination rooms, yet penetrate boards
and divisions and affect the senses of those within. Its bearing
upon the case before us is undeniable. For it allows us to decide
in the case of <i>Baldwin</i> v. <i>Whitaker</i> that both the
Prime Minister and the Almanack are telling the truth. It is true
that women civil servants deserve to be paid as much as men; but it
is also true that they are not paid as much as men. The discrepancy
is due to atmosphere.</p>

<p>Atmosphere plainly is a very mighty power. Atmosphere not only
changes the sizes and shapes of things; it affects solid bodies,
like salaries, which might have been thought impervious to
atmosphere. An epic poem might be written about atmosphere, or a
novel in ten or fifteen volumes. But since this is only a letter,
and you are pressed for time, let us confine ourselves to the plain
statement that atmosphere is one of the most powerful, partly
because it is one of the most impalpable, of the enemies with which
the daughters of educated men have to fight. If you think that
statement exaggerated, look once more at the samples of atmosphere
contained in those three quotations. We shall find there not only
the reason why the pay of the professional woman is still so small,
but something more dangerous, something which, if it spreads, may
poison both sexes equally. There, in those quotations, is the egg
of the very same worm that we know under other names in other
countries. There we have in embryo the creature, Dictator as we
call him when he is Italian or German, who believes that he has the
right whether given by God, Nature, sex or race is immaterial, to
dictate to other human beings how they shall live; what they shall
do. Let us quote again: 'Homes are the real places of the women who
are now compelling men to be idle. It is time the Government
insisted upon employers giving work to more men, thus enabling them
to marry the women they cannot now approach.' Place beside it
another quotation: 'There are two worlds in the life of the nation,
the world of men and the world of women. Nature has done well to
entrust the man with the care of his family and the nation. The
woman's world is her family, her husband, her children, and her
home.' One is written in English, the other in German. But where is
the difference? Are they not both saying the same thing? Are they
not both the voices of Dictators, whether they speak English or
German, and are we not all agreed that the dictator when we meet
him abroad is a very dangerous as well as a very ugly animal? And
he is here among us, raising his ugly head, spitting his poison,
small still, curled up like a caterpillar on a leaf, but in the
heart of England. Is it not from this egg, to quote Mr Wells again,
that 'the practical obliteration of [our] freedom by Fascists or
Nazis' will spring? And is not the woman who has to breathe that
poison and to fight that insect, secretly and without arms, in her
office, fighting the Fascist or the Nazi as surely as those who
fight him with arms in the limelight of publicity? And must not
that fight wear down her strength and exhaust her spirit? Should we
not help her to crush him in our own country before we ask her to
help us to crush him abroad? And what right have we, Sir, to
trumpet our ideals of freedom and justice to other countries when
we can shake out from our most respectable newspapers any day of
the week eggs like these?</p>

<p>Here, rightly, you will check what has all the symptoms of
becoming a peroration by pointing out that though the opinions
expressed in these letters are not altogether agreeable to our
national self-esteem they are the natural expression of fear and a
jealousy which we must understand before we condemn them. It is
true, you will say, that these gentlemen seem a little unduly
concerned with their own salaries and their own security, but that
is comprehensible, given the traditions of their sex, and even
compatible with a genuine love of freedom and a genuine hatred of
dictatorship. For these gentlemen are, or wish to become, husbands
and fathers, and in that case the support of the family will depend
upon them. In other words, sir, I take you to mean that the world
as it is at present is divided into two services; one the public
and the other the private. In one world the sons of educated men
work as civil servants, judges, soldiers and are paid for that
work; in the other world, the daughters of educated men work as
wives, mothers, daughters&mdash;but are they not paid for that
work? Is the work of a mother, of a wife, of a daughter, worth
nothing to the nation in solid cash? That fact, if it be a fact, is
so astonishing that we must confirm it by appealing once more to
the impeccable Whitaker. Let us turn to his pages again. We may
turn them, and turn them again. It seems incredible, yet it seems
undeniable. Among all those offices there is no such office as a
mother's; among all those salaries there is no such salary as a
mother's. The work of an archbishop is worth &pound;15,000 a year
to the State; the work of a judge is worth &pound;5,000 a year; the
work of a permanent secretary is worth &pound;3,000 a year; the
work of an army captain, of a sea captain, of a sergeant of
dragoons, of a policeman, of a postman&mdash;all these works are
worth paying out of the taxes, but wives and mothers and daughters
who work all day and every day, without whose work the State would
collapse and fall to pieces, without whose work your sons, sir,
would cease to exist, are paid nothing whatever. Can it be
possible? Or have we convicted Whitaker, the impeccable, of
errata?</p>

<p>Ah, you will interpose, here is another misunderstanding.
Husband and wife are not only one flesh; they are also one purse.
The wife's salary is half the husband's income. The man is paid
more than the woman for that very reason&mdash;because he has a
wife to support. The bachelor then is paid at the same rate as the
unmarried woman? It appears not&mdash;another queer effect of
atmosphere, no doubt; but let it pass. Your statement that the
wife's salary is half the husband's income seems to be an equitable
arrangement, and no doubt, since it is equitable, it is confirmed
by law. Your reply that the law leaves these private matters to be
decided privately is less satisfactory, for it means that the
wife's half-share of the common income is not paid legally into her
hands, but into her husband's. But still a spiritual right may be
as binding as a legal right; and if the wife of an educated man has
a spiritual right to half her husband's income, then we may assume
that the wife of an educated man has as much money to spend, once
the common household bills are met, upon any cause that appeals to
her as her husband. Now her husband, witness Whitaker, witness the
wills in the daily paper, is often not merely well paid by his
profession, but is master of a very considerable capital sum.
Therefore this lady who asserts that &pound;250 a year is all that
a woman can earn today in the professions is evading the question;
for the profession of marriage in the educated class is a highly
paid one, since she has a right, a spiritual right, to half her
husband's salary. The puzzle deepens; the mystery thickens. For if
the wives of rich men are themselves rich women, how does it come
about that the income of the W.S.P.U. was only &pound;42,000 a
year; how does it come about that the honorary treasurer of the
college rebuilding fund is still asking for &pound;100,000; how
does it come about that the treasurer of a society for helping
professional women to obtain employment is asking not merely for
money to pay her rent but will be grateful for books, fruit or
cast-off clothing? It stands to reason that if the wife has a
spiritual right to half her husband's income because her own work
as his wife is unpaid, then she must have as much money to spend
upon such causes as appeal to her as he has. And since those causes
are standing hat in hand a-begging we are forced to conclude that
they are causes that do not take the fancy of the educated man's
wife. The charge against her is a very serious one. For
consider&mdash;there is the money&mdash;that surplus fund that can
be devoted to education, to pleasure, to philanthropy when the
household dues are met; she can spend her share as freely as her
husband can spend his. She can spend it upon whatever causes she
likes; and yet she will not spend it upon the causes that are dear
to her own sex. There they are, hat in hand a-begging. That is a
terrible charge to bring against her.</p>

<p>But let us pause for a moment before we decide that charge
against her. Let us ask what are the causes, the pleasures, the
philanthropies upon which the educated man's wife does in fact
spend her share of the common surplus fund. And here we are
confronted with facts which, whether we like them or not, we must
face. The fact is that the tastes of the married woman in our class
are markedly virile. She spends vast sums annually upon party
funds; upon sport; upon grouse moors; upon cricket and football.
She lavishes money upon clubs&mdash;Brooks', White's, the
Travellers', the Reform, the Athenaeum&mdash;to mention only the
most prominent. Her expenditure upon these causes, pleasures and
philanthropies must run into many millions every year. And yet by
far the greater part of this sum is spent upon pleasures which she
does not share. She lays out thousands and thousands of pounds upon
clubs to which her own sex is not admitted;<sup><a href=
"#215">15</a></sup> upon racecourses where she may not ride; upon
colleges from which her own sex is excluded. She pays a huge bill
annually for wine which she does not drink and for cigars which she
does not smoke. In short, there are only two conclusions to which
we can come about the educated man's wife&mdash;the first is that
she is the most altruistic of beings who prefers to spend her share
of the common fund upon his pleasures and causes; the second, and
more probable, if less creditable, is not that she is the most
altruistic of beings, but that her spiritual right to a share of
half her husband's income peters out in practice to an actual right
to board, lodging and a small annual allowance for pocket money and
dress. Either of these conclusions is possible; the evidence of
public institutions and subscription lists puts any other out of
the question. For consider how nobly the educated man supports his
old school, his old college; how splendidly he subscribes to party
funds; how munificently he contributes to all those institutions
and sports by which he and his sons educate their minds and develop
their bodies&mdash;the daily papers bear daily witness to those
indisputable facts. But the absence of her name from subscription
lists, and the poverty of the institutions which educate her mind
and her body seem to prove that there is something in the
atmosphere of the private house which deflects the wife's spiritual
share of the common income impalpably but irresistibly towards
those causes which her husband approves and those pleasures which
he enjoys. Whether creditable or discreditable, that is the fact.
And that is the reason why those other causes stand a-begging.</p>

<p>With Whitaker's facts and the facts of the subscription lists
before us, we seem to have arrived at three facts which are
indisputable and must have great influence upon our inquiry how we
can help you to prevent war. The first is that the daughters of
educated men are paid very little from the public funds for their
public services; the second is that they are paid nothing at all
from the public funds for their private services; and the third is
that their share of the husband's income is not a flesh-and-blood
share but a spiritual or nominal share, which means that when both
are clothed and fed the surplus fund that can be devoted to causes,
pleasures or philanthropies gravitates mysteriously but
indisputably towards those causes, pleasures and philanthropies
which the husband enjoys, and of which the husband approves. It
seems that the person to whom the salary is actually paid is the
person who has the actual right to decide how that salary shall be
spent.</p>

<p>These facts then bring us back in a chastened mood and with
rather altered views to our starting point. For we were going, you
may remember, to lay your appeal for help in the prevention of war
before the women who earn their livings in the professions. It is
to them, we said, to whom we must appeal, because it is they who
have our new weapon, the influence of an independent opinion based
upon an independent income, in their possession. But the facts once
more are depressing. They make it clear in the first place that we
must rule out, as possible helpers, that large group to whom
marriage is a profession, because it is an unpaid profession, and
because the spiritual share of half the husband's salary is not,
facts seem to show, an actual share. Therefore, her disinterested
influence founded upon an independent income is nil. If he is in
favour of force, she too will be in favour of force. In the second
place, facts seem to prove that the statement 'To earn &pound;250 a
year is quite an achievement even for a highly qualified woman with
years of experience' is not an unmitigated lie but a highly
probable truth. Therefore, the influence which the daughters of
educated men have at present from their money-earning power cannot
be rated very highly. Yet since it has become more than ever
obvious that it is to them that we must look for help, for they
alone can help us, it is to them that we must appeal. This
conclusion then brings us back to the letter from which we quoted
above&mdash;the honorary treasurer's letter, the letter asking for
a subscription to the society for helping the daughters of educated
men to obtain employment in the professions. You will agree, sir,
that we have strong selfish motives for helping her&mdash;there can
be no doubt about that. For to help women to earn their livings in
the professions is to help them to possess that weapon of
independent opinion which is still their most powerful weapon. It
is to help them to have a mind of their own and a will of their own
with which to help you to prevent war. But . . .&mdash;here again,
in those dots, doubts and hesitations assert themselves&mdash;can
we, considering the facts given above, send her our guinea without
laying down very stringent terms as to how that guinea shall be
spent?</p>

<p>For the facts which we have discovered in checking her statement
as to her financial position have raised questions which make us
wonder whether we are wise to encourage people to enter the
professions if we wish to prevent war. You will remember that we
are using our psychological insight (for that is our only
qualification) to decide what kind of qualities in human nature are
likely to lead to war. And the facts disclosed above are of a kind
to make us ask, before we write our cheque, whether if we encourage
the daughters of educated men to enter the professions we shall not
be encouraging the very qualities that we wish to prevent? Shall we
not be doing our guinea's worth to ensure that in two or three
centuries not only the educated men in the professions but the
educated women in the professions will be asking&mdash;oh, of whom?
as the poet says&mdash;the very question that you are asking us
now: How can we prevent war? If we encourage the daughters to enter
the professions without making any conditions as to the way in
which the professions are to be practised shall we not be doing our
best to stereotype the old tune which human nature, like a
gramophone whose needle has stuck, is now grinding out with such
disastrous unanimity? 'Here we go round the mulberry tree, the
mulberry tree, the mulberry tree. Give it all to me, give it all to
me, all to me. Three hundred millions spent upon war.' With that
song, or something like it, ringing in our ears we cannot send our
guinea to the honorary treasurer without warning her that she shall
only have it on condition that she shall swear that the professions
in future shall be practised so that they shall lead to a different
song and a different conclusion. She shall only have it if she can
satisfy us that our guinea shall be spent in the cause of peace. It
is difficult to formulate such conditions; in our present
psychological ignorance perhaps impossible. But the matter is so
serious, war is so insupportable, so horrible, so inhuman, that an
attempt must be made. Here then is another letter to the same
lady.</p>

<p>'Your letter, Madam, has waited a long time for an answer, but
we have been examining into certain charges made against you and
making certain inquiries. We have acquitted you, Madam, you will be
relieved to learn, of telling lies. It would seem to be true that
you are poor. We have acquitted you further, of idleness, apathy
and greed. The number of causes that you are championing, however
secretly and ineffectively, is in your favour. If you prefer ice
creams and peanuts to roast beef and beer the reason would seem to
be economic rather than gustatory. It would seem probable that you
have not much money to spend upon food or much leisure to spend
upon eating it in view of the circulars and leaflets you issue, the
meetings you arrange, the bazaars you organize. Indeed, you would
appear to be working, without a salary too, rather longer hours
than the Home Office would approve. But though we are willing to
deplore your poverty and to commend your industry we are not going
to send you a guinea to help you to help women to enter the
professions unless you can assure us that they will practise those
professions in such a way as to prevent war. That, you will say, is
a vague statement, an impossible condition. Still, since guineas
are rare and guineas are valuable you will listen to the terms we
wish to impose if, you intimate, they can be stated briefly. Well
then, Madam, since you are pressed for time, what with the Pensions
Bill, what with shepherding the Peers into the House of Lords so
that they may vote on it as instructed by you, what with reading
Hansard and the newspapers&mdash;though that should not take much
time; you will find no mention of your activities
there;<sup><a href="#216">16</a></sup> a conspiracy of silence
seems to be the rule; what with plotting still for equal pay for
equal work in the Civil Service, while at the same time you are
arranging hares and old coffee-pots so as to seduce people into
paying more for them than they are strictly worth at a
bazaar&mdash;since, in one word, it is obvious that you are busy,
let us be quick; make a rapid survey; discuss a few passages in the
books in your library; in the papers on your table, and then see if
we can make the statement less vague, the conditions more
clear.</p>

<p>'Let us then begin by looking at the outside of things, at the
general aspect. Things have outsides let us remember as well as
insides. Close at hand is a bridge over the Thames, an admirable
vantage ground for such a survey. The river flows beneath; barges
pass, laden with timber, bursting with corn; there on one side are
the domes and spires of the city; on the other, Westminster and the
Houses of Parliament. It is a place to stand on by the hour,
dreaming. But not now. Now we are pressed for time. Now we are here
to consider facts; now we must fix our eyes upon the
procession&mdash;the procession of the sons of educated men.</p>

<p>'There they go, our brothers who have been educated at public
schools and universities, mounting those steps, passing in and out
of those doors, ascending those pulpits, preaching, teaching,
administering justice, practising medicine, transacting business,
making money. It is a solemn sight always&mdash;a procession, like
a caravanserai crossing a desert. Great-grandfathers, grandfathers,
fathers, uncles&mdash;they all went that way, wearing their gowns,
wearing their wigs, some with ribbons across their breasts, others
without. One was a bishop. Another a judge. One was an admiral.
Another a general. One was a professor. Another a doctor. And some
left the procession and were last heard of doing nothing in
Tasmania; were seen, rather shabbily dressed, selling newspapers at
Charing Cross. But most of them kept in step, walked according to
rule, and by hook or by crook made enough to keep the family house,
somewhere, roughly speaking, in the West End, supplied with beef
and mutton for all, and with education for Arthur. It is a solemn
sight, this procession, a sight that has often caused us, you may
remember, looking at it sidelong from an upper window, to ask
ourselves certain questions. But now, for the past twenty years or
so, it is no longer a sight merely, a photograph, or fresco
scrawled upon the walls of time, at which we can look with merely
an aesthetic appreciation. For there, trapesing along at the tail
end of the procession, we go ourselves. And that makes a
difference. We who have looked so long at the pageant in books, or
from a curtained window watched educated men leaving the house at
about nine-thirty to go to an office, returning to the house at
about six-thirty from an office, need look passively no longer. We
too can leave the house, can mount those steps, pass in and out of
those doors, wear wigs and gowns, make money, administer justice.
Think&mdash;one of these days, you may wear a judge's wig on your
head, an ermine cape on your shoulders; sit under the lion and the
unicorn; draw a salary of five thousand a year with a pension on
retiring. We who now agitate these humble pens may in another
century or two speak from a pulpit. Nobody will dare contradict us
then; we shall be the mouthpieces of the divine spirit&mdash;a
solemn thought, is it not? Who can say whether, as time goes on, we
may not dress in military uniform, with gold lace on our breasts,
swords at our sides, and something like the old family coal-scuttle
on our heads, save that that venerable object was never decorated
with plumes of white horsehair. You laugh&mdash;indeed the shadow
of the private house still makes those dresses look a little queer.
We have worn private clothes so long&mdash;the veil that St Paul
recommended. But we have not come here to laugh, or to talk of
fashions&mdash;men's and women's. We are here, on the bridge, to
ask ourselves certain questions. And they are very important
questions; and we have very little time in which to answer them.
The questions that we have to ask and to answer about that
procession during this moment of transition are so important that
they may well change the lives of all men and women for ever. For
we have to ask ourselves, here and now, do we wish to join that
procession, or don't we? On what terms shall we join that
procession? Above all, where is it leading us, the procession of
educated men? The moment is short; it may last five years; ten
years, or perhaps only a matter of a few months longer. But the
questions must be answered; and they are so important that if all
the daughters of educated men did nothing, from morning to night,
but consider that procession from every angle, if they did nothing
but ponder it and analyse it, and think about it and read about it
and pool their thinking and reading, and what they see and what
they guess, their time would be better spent than in any other
activity now open to them. But, you will object, you have no time
to think; you have your battles to fight, your rent to pay, your
bazaars to organize. That excuse shall not serve you, Madam. As you
know from your own experience, and there are facts that prove it,
the daughters of educated men have always done their thinking from
hand to mouth; not under green lamps at study tables in the
cloisters of secluded colleges. They have thought while they
stirred the pot, while they rocked the cradle. It was thus that
they won us the right to our brand-new sixpence. It falls to us now
to go on thinking; how are we to spend that sixpence? Think we
must. Let us think in offices; in omnibuses; while we are standing
in the crowd watching Coronations and Lord Mayor's Shows; let us
think as we pass the Cenotaph; and in Whitehall; in the gallery of
the House of Commons; in the Law Courts; let us think at baptisms
and marriages and funerals. Let us never cease from
thinking&mdash;what is this "civilization" in which we find
ourselves? What are these ceremonies and why should we take part in
them? What are these professions and why should we make money out
of them? Where in short is it leading us, the procession of the
sons of educated men?</p>

<p>'But you are busy; let us return to facts. Come indoors then,
and open the books on your library shelves. For you have a library,
and a good one. A working library, a living library; a library
where nothing is chained down and nothing is locked up; a library
where the songs of the singers rise naturally from the lives of the
livers. There are the poems, here the biographies. And what light
do they throw upon the professions, these biographies? How far do
they encourage us to think that if we help the daughters to become
professional women we shall discourage war? The answer to that
question is scattered all about these volumes; and is legible to
anyone who can read plain English. And the answer, one must admit,
is extremely queer. For almost every biography we read of
professional men in the nineteenth century, to limit ourselves to
that not distant and fully documented age, is largely concerned
with war. They were great fighters, it seems, the professional men
in the age of Queen Victoria. There was the battle of Westminster.
There was the battle of the universities. There was the battle of
Whitehall. There was the battle of Harley Street. There was the
battle of the Royal Academy. Some of these battles, as you can
testify, are still in progress. In fact the only profession which
does not seem to have fought a fierce battle during the nineteenth
century is the profession of literature. All the other professions,
according to the testimony of biography, seem to be as bloodthirsty
as the profession of arms itself. It is true that the combatants
did not inflict flesh wounds;<sup><a href="#217">17</a></sup>
chivalry forbade; but you will agree that a battle that wastes time
is as deadly as a battle that wastes blood. You will agree that a
battle that costs money is as deadly as a battle that costs a leg
or an arm. You will agree that a battle that forces youth to spend
its strength haggling in committee rooms, soliciting favours,
assuming a mask of reverence to cloak its ridicule, inflicts wounds
upon the human spirit which no surgery can heal. Even the battle of
equal pay for equal work is not without its timeshed, its
spiritshed, as you yourself, were you not unaccountably reticent on
certain matters, might agree. Now the books in your library record
so many of these battles that it is impossible to go into them all;
but as they all seem to have been fought on much the same plan, and
by the same combatants, that is by professional men v. their
sisters and daughters, let us, since time presses, glance at one of
these campaigns only and examine the battle of Harley Street, in
order that we may understand what effect the professions have upon
those who practise them.</p>

<p>'The campaign was opened in the year 1869 under the leadership
of Sophia Jex-Blake. Her case is so typical an instance of the
great Victorian fight between the victims of the patriarchal system
and the patriarchs, of the daughters against the fathers, that it
deserves a moment's examination. Sophia's father was an admirable
specimen of the Victorian educated man, kindly, cultivated and
well-to-do. He was a proctor of Doctors' Commons. He could afford
to keep six servants, horses and carriages, and could provide his
daughter not only with food and lodging but with "handsome
furniture" and "a cosy fire" in her bedroom. For salary, "for dress
and private money", he gave her &pound;40 a year. For some reason
she found this sum insufficient. In 1859, in view of the fact that
she had only nine shillings and ninepence left to last her till
next quarter, she wished to earn money herself. And she was offered
a tutorship with the pay of five shillings an hour. She told her
father of the offer. He replied, "Dearest, I have only this moment
heard that you contemplate being <i>paid</i> for the tutorship. It
would be quite beneath you, darling, and <i>I</i> <i>cannot</i>
<i>consent to it,"</i> She argued: "Why should I not take it? You
as a man did your work and received your payment, and no one
thought it any degradation, but a fair exchange . . . Tom is doing
on a large scale what I am doing on a small one." He replied: "The
cases you cite, darling, are not to the point. . . T. W. . . .
feels bound as a <i>man</i> . . . to support his wife and family,
and his position is a high one, which can only be filled by a
first-class man of character, and yielding him nearer two than one
thousand a year . . . How entirely different is my darling's case!
You want for nothing, and know that (humanly speaking) you will
want for nothing. If you married tomorrow&mdash;to my
liking&mdash;and I don't believe you would ever marry
otherwise&mdash;I should give you a good fortune." Upon which her
comment, in a private diary, was: "Like a fool I have consented to
give up the fees for this term only&mdash;though I am miserably
poor. It was foolish. It only defers the struggle."<sup><a href=
"#218">18</a></sup></p>

<p>'There she was right. The struggle with her own father was over.
But the struggle with fathers in general, with the patriarchy
itself, was deferred to another place and another time. The second
fight was at Edinburgh in 1869. She had applied for admission to
the Royal College of Surgeons. Here is a newspaper account of the
first skirmish. "A disturbance of a very unbecoming nature took
place yesterday afternoon in front of the Royal College of Surgeons
. . . Shortly before four o'clock . . . nearly 200 students
assembled in front of the gate leading to the building . . ." the
medical students howled and sang songs. "The gate was closed in
their [the women's] faces . . . Dr Handyside found it utterly
impossible to begin his demonstration . . . a pet sheep was
introduced into the room" and so on. The methods were much the same
as those that were employed at Cambridge during the battle of the
Degree. And again, as on that occasion, the authorities deplored
those downright methods and employed others, more astute and more
effective, of their own. Nothing would induce the authorities
encamped within the sacred gates to allow the women to enter. They
said that God was on their side, Nature was on their side, Law was
on their side, and Property was on their side. The college was
founded for the benefit of men only; men only were entitled by law
to benefit from its endowments. The usual committees were formed.
The usual petitions were signed. The humble appeals were made. The
usual bazaars were held. The usual questions of tactics were
debated. As usual it was asked, ought we to attack now, or is it
wiser to wait? Who are our friends and who are our enemies? There
were the usual differences of opinion, the usual divisions among
the counsellors. But why particularize? The whole proceeding is so
familiar that the battle of Harley Street in the year 1869 might
well be the battle of Cambridge University at the present moment.
On both occasions there is the same waste of strength, waste of
temper, waste of time, and waste of money. Almost the same
daughters ask almost the same brothers for almost the same
privileges. Almost the same gentlemen intone the same refusals for
almost the same reasons. It seems as if there were no progress in
the human race, but only repetition. We can almost hear them if we
listen singing the same old song, "Here we go round the mulberry
tree, the mulberry tree, the mulberry tree" and if we add, "of
property, of property, of property," we shall fill in the rhyme
without doing violence to the facts.</p>

<p>'But we are not here to sing old songs or to fill in missing
rhymes. We are here to consider facts. And the facts which we have
just extracted from biography seem to prove that the professions
have a certain undeniable effect upon the professors. They make the
people who practise them possessive, jealous of any infringement of
their rights, and highly combative if anyone dares dispute them.
Are we not right then in thinking that if we enter the same
professions we shall acquire the same qualities? And do not such
qualities lead to war? In another century or so if we practise the
professions in the same way, shall we not be just as possessive,
just as jealous, just as pugnacious, just as positive as to the
verdict of God, Nature, Law and Property as these gentlemen are
now? Therefore this guinea, which is to help you to help women to
enter the professions, has this condition as a first condition
attached to it. You shall swear that you will do all in your power
to insist that any woman who enters any profession shall in no way
hinder any other human being, whether man or woman, white or black,
provided that he or she is qualified to enter that profession, from
entering it; but shall do all in her power to help them.</p>

<p>'You are ready to put your hand to that, here and now, you say,
and at the same time stretch out that hand for the guinea. But
wait. Other conditions are attached to it before it is yours. For
consider once more the procession of the sons of educated men; ask
yourself once more, where is it leading us? One answer suggests
itself instantly. To incomes, it is obvious, that seem, to us at
least, extremely handsome. Whitaker puts that beyond a doubt. And
besides the evidence of Whitaker, there is the evidence of the
daily paper&mdash;the evidence of the wills, of the subscription
lists that we have considered already. In one issue of one paper,
for example, it is stated that three educated men died; and one
left &pound;1,193,251; another &pound;1,010,288; another
&pound;1,404,132. These are large sums for private people to amass,
you will admit. And why should we not amass them too in course of
time? Now that the Civil Service is open to us we may well earn
from one thousand to three thousand a year; now that the Bar is
open to us we may well earn &pound;5,000 a year as judges, and any
sum up to forty or fifty thousand a year as barristers. When the
Church is open to us we may draw salaries of fifteen thousand, five
thousand, three thousand yearly, with palaces and deaneries
attached. When the Stock Exchange is open to us we may die worth as
many millions as Pierpont Morgan, or as Rockefeller himself. As
doctors we may make anything from two thousand to fifty thousand a
year. As editors even we may earn salaries that are by no means
despicable. One has a thousand a year; another two thousand; it is
rumoured that the editor of a great daily paper has a salary of
five thousand yearly. All this wealth may in the course of time
come our way if we follow the professions. In short, we may change
our position from being the victims of the patriarchal system, paid
on the truck system, with &pound;30 or &pound;40 a year in cash and
board and lodging thrown in, to being the champions of the
capitalist system, with a yearly income in our own possession of
many thousands which, by judicious investment, may leave us when we
die possessed of a capital sum of more millions than we can
count.</p>

<p>'It is a thought not without its glamour. Consider what it would
mean if among us there were now a woman motorcar manufacturer who,
with a stroke of the pen, could endow the women's colleges with two
or three hundred thousand pounds apiece. The honorary treasurer of
the rebuilding fund, your sister at Cambridge, would have her
labours considerably lightened then. There would be no need of
appeals and committees, of strawberries and cream and bazaars. And
suppose that there were not merely one rich woman, but that rich
women were as common as rich men. What could you not do? You could
shut up your office at once. You could finance a woman's party in
the House of Commons. You could run a daily newspaper committed to
a conspiracy, not of silence, but of speech. You could get pensions
for spinsters; those victims of the patriarchal system, whose
allowance is insufficient and whose board and lodging are no longer
thrown in. You could get equal pay for equal work. You could
provide every mother with chloroform when her child is
born;<sup><a href="#219">19</a></sup> bring down the maternal
death-rate from four in every thousand to none at all, perhaps. In
one session you could pass Bills that will now take you perhaps a
hundred years of hard and continuous labour to get through the
House of Commons. There seems at first sight nothing that you could
not do, if you had the same capital at your disposal that your
brothers have at theirs. Why not, then, you exclaim, help us to
take the first step towards possessing it? The professions are the
only way in which we can earn money. Money is the only means by
which we can achieve objects that are immensely desirable. Yet here
you are, you seem to protest, haggling and bargaining over
conditions. But consider this letter from a professional man asking
us to help him to prevent war. Look also at the photographs of dead
bodies and ruined houses that the Spanish Government sends almost
weekly. That is why it is necessary to haggle and to bargain over
conditions.</p>

<p>'For the evidence of the letter and of the photographs when
combined with the facts with which history and biography provide us
about the professions seem together to throw a certain light, a red
light, shall we say, upon those same professions. You make money in
them; that is true; but how far is money in view of those facts in
itself a desirable possession? A great authority upon human life,
you will remember, held over two thousand years ago that great
possessions were undesirable. To which you reply, and with some
heat as if you suspected another excuse for keeping the
purse-string tied, that Christ's words about the rich and the
Kingdom of Heaven are no longer helpful to those who have to face
different facts in a different world. You argue that as things are
now in England extreme poverty is less desirable than extreme
wealth. The poverty of the Christian who should give away all his
possessions produces, as we have daily and abundant proof, the
crippled in body, the feeble in mind. The unemployed, to take the
obvious example, are not a source of spiritual or intellectual
wealth to their country. These are weighty arguments; but consider
for a moment the life of Pierpont Morgan. Do you not agree with
that evidence before us that extreme wealth is equally undesirable,
and for the same reasons? If extreme wealth is undesirable and
extreme poverty is undesirable, it is arguable that there is some
mean between the two which is desirable. What then is that
mean&mdash;how much money is needed to live upon in England today?
How should that money be spent? What is the kind of life, the kind
of human being, you propose to aim at if you succeed in extracting
this guinea? Those, Madam, are the questions that I am asking you
to consider and you cannot deny that those are questions of the
utmost importance. But alas, they are questions that would lead us
far beyond the solid world of actual fact to which we are here
confined. So let us shut the New Testament; Shakespeare, Shelley,
Tolstoy and the rest, and face the fact that stares us in the face
at this moment of transition&mdash;the fact of the procession; the
fact that we are trapesing along somewhere in the rear and must
consider that fact before we can fix our eyes upon the vision on
the horizon.</p>

<p>'There it is then, before our eyes, the procession of the sons
of educated men, ascending those pulpits, mounting those steps,
passing in and out of those doors, preaching, teaching,
administering justice, practising medicine, making money. And it is
obvious that if you are going to make the same incomes from the
same professions that those men make you will have to accept the
same conditions that they accept. Even from an upper window and
from books we know or can guess what those conditions are. You will
have to leave the house at nine and come back to it at six. That
leaves very little time for fathers to know their children. You
will have to do this daily from the age of twenty-one or so to the
age of about sixty-five. That leaves very little time for
friendship, travel or art. You will have to perform some duties
that are very arduous, others that are very barbarous. You will
have to wear certain uniforms and profess certain loyalties. If you
succeed in your profession the words "For God and Empire" will very
likely be written, like the address on a dog-collar, round your
neck.<sup><a href="#220">20</a></sup> And if words have meaning, as
words perhaps should have meaning, you will have to accept that
meaning and do what you can to enforce it. In short, you will have
to lead the same lives and profess the same loyalties that
professional men have professed for many centuries. There can be no
doubt of that.</p>

<p>'If you retaliate, what harm is there in that? Why should we
hesitate to do what our fathers and grandfathers have done before
us? Let us go into greater detail and consult the facts which are
nowadays open to the inspection of all who can read their mother
tongue in biography. There they are, those innumerable and
invaluable works upon the shelves of your own library. Let us
glance again rapidly at the lives of professional men who have
succeeded in their professions. Here is an extract from the life of
a great lawyer. "He went to his chambers about half-past nine . . .
He took briefs home with him . . . so that he was lucky if he got
to bed about one or two o'clock in the morning."<sup><a href=
"#221">21</a></sup> That explains why most successful barristers
are hardly worth sitting next at dinner&mdash;they yawn so. Next,
here is a quotation from a famous politician's speech. ". . . since
1914 I have never seen the pageant of the blossom from the first
damson to the last apple&mdash;never once have I seen that in
Worcestershire since 1914, and if that is not a sacrifice I do not
know what is."<sup><a href="#222">22</a></sup> A sacrifice indeed,
and one that explains the perennial indifference of the Government
to art&mdash;why, these unfortunate gentlemen must be as blind as
bats. Take the religious profession next. Here is a quotation from
the life of a great bishop. "This is an awful
mind-and-soul-destroying life. I really do not know how to live it.
The arrears of important work accumulate and crush."<sup><a href=
"#223">23</a></sup> That bears out what so many people are saying
now about the Church and the nation. Our bishops and deans seem to
have no soul with which to preach and no mind with which to write.
Listen to any sermon in any church; read the journalism of Dean
Alington or Dean Inge in any newspaper. Take the doctor's
profession next. "I have taken a good deal over &pound;13,000
during the year, but this cannot possibly be maintained, and while
it lasts it is slavery. What I feel most is being away from Eliza
and the children so frequently on Sundays, and again at
Christmas."<sup><a href="#224">24</a></sup> That is the complaint
of a great doctor; and his patient might well echo it, for what
Harley Street specialist has time to understand the body, let alone
the mind or both in combination, when he is a slave to thirteen
thousand a year? But is the life of a professional writer any
better? Here is a sample taken from the life of a highly successful
journalist. "On another day at this time he wrote a 1,600 words
article on Nietzsche, a leader of equal length on the railway
strike for the <i>Standard,</i> 600 words for the <i>Tribune</i>
and in the evening was at Shoe Lane."<sup><a href=
"#225">25</a></sup> That explains among other things why the public
reads its politics with cynicism, and authors read their reviews
with foot-rules&mdash;it is the advertisement that counts; praise
or blame have ceased to have any meaning. And with one more glance
at the politician's life, for his profession after all is the most
important practically, let us have done. "Lord Hugh <i>loitered in
the lobby . . .</i> The Bill [the Deceased Wife's Sister Bill] was
in consequence dead, and the further chances of the cause were
relegated to the chances and mischances of another
year."<sup><a href="#226">26</a></sup> That not only serves to
explain a certain prevalent distrust of politicians, but also
reminds us that since you have the Pensions Bill to steer through
the lobbies of so just and humane an institution as the House of
Commons, we must not loiter too long ourselves among these
delightful biographies, but must try to sum up the information
which we have gained from them.</p>

<p>'What then do these quotations from the lives of successful
professional men prove, you ask? They prove, as Whitaker proves
things, nothing whatever. If Whitaker, that is, says that a bishop
is paid five thousand a year, that is a fact; it can be checked and
verified. But if Bishop Gore says that the life of a bishop is "an
awful mind- and soul-destroying life" he is merely giving us his
opinion; the next bishop on the bench may flatly contradict him.
These quotations then prove nothing that can be checked and
verified; they merely cause us to hold opinions. And those opinions
cause us to doubt and criticize and question the value of
professional life&mdash;not its cash value; that is great; but its
spiritual, its moral, its intellectual value. They make us of the
opinion that if people are highly successful in their professions
they lose their senses. Sight goes. They have no time to look at
pictures. Sound goes. They have no time to listen to music. Speech
goes. They have no time for conversation. They lose their sense of
proportion&mdash;the relations between one thing and another.
Humanity goes. Money making becomes so important that they must
work by night as well as by day. Health goes. And so competitive do
they become that they will not share their work with others though
they have more than they can do themselves. What then remains of a
human being who has lost sight, and sound, and sense of proportion?
Only a cripple in a cave.</p>

<p>'That of course is a figure, and fanciful; but that it has some
connection with figures that are statistical and not
fanciful&mdash;with the three hundred millions spent upon
arms&mdash;seems possible. Such at any rate would seem to be the
opinion of disinterested observers whose position gives them every
opportunity for judging widely, and for judging fairly. Let us
examine two such opinions only. The Marquess of Londonderry
said:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We seem to hear a babel of voices among which direction and
guidance are lacking, and the world appears to be marking time . .
. During the last century gigantic forces of scientific discovery
had been unloosed, while at the same time we could discern no
corresponding advance in literary or scientific achievement . . .
The question we are asking ourselves is whether man is capable of
enjoying these new fruits of scientific knowledge and discovery, or
whether by their misuse he will bring about the destruction of
himself and the edifice of civilization.<sup><a href=
"#227">27</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>'Mr Churchill said:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Certain it is that while men are gathering knowledge and power
with ever-increasing and measureless speed, their virtues and their
wisdom have not shown any notable improvement as the centuries have
rolled. The brain of a modern man does not differ in essentials
from that of the human beings who fought and loved here millions of
years ago. The nature of man has remained hitherto practically
unchanged. Under sufficient stress&mdash;starvation, terror,
warlike passion, or even cold intellectual frenzy, the modern man
we know so well will do the most terrible deeds, and his modern
woman will back him up.<sup><a href="#228">28</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>'Those are two quotations only from a great number to the same
effect. And to them let us add another, from a less impressive
source but worth your reading since it too bears upon our problem,
from Mr Cyril Chaventry of North Wembley.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A woman's sense of values [he writes], is indisputably different
from that of a man. Obviously therefore a woman is at a
disadvantage and under suspicion when in competition in a
man-created sphere of activity. More than ever today women have the
opportunity to build a new and better world, but in this slavish
imitation of men they are wasting their chance.<sup><a href=
"#229">29</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>'That opinion, too, is a representative opinion, one from a
great number to the same effect provided by the daily papers. And
the three quotations taken together are highly instructive. The two
first seem to prove that the enormous professional competence of
the educated man has not brought about an altogether desirable
state of things in the civilized world; and the last, which calls
upon professional women to use "their different sense of values" to
"build a new and better world" not only implies that those who have
built that world are dissatisfied with the results, but, by calling
upon the other sex to remedy the evil imposes a great
responsibility and implies a great compliment. For if Mr Chaventry
and the gentlemen who agree with him believe that "at a
disadvantage and under suspicion" as she is, with little or no
political or professional training and upon a salary of about
&pound;250 a year, the professional woman can yet "build a new and
better world", they must credit her with powers that might almost
be called divine. They must agree with Goethe:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The things that must pass<br>
Are only symbols;<br>
Here shall all failure<br>
Grow to achievement,<br>
Here, the Untellable<br>
Work all fulfilment,<br>
The woman in woman<br>
Lead forward for ever<sup><a href="#230">30</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&mdash;another very great compliment, and from a very great poet
you will agree.</p>

<p>'But you do not want compliments; you are pondering quotations.
And since your expression is decidedly downcast, it seems as if
these quotations about the nature of professional life have brought
you to some melancholy conclusion. What can it be? Simply, you
reply, that we, daughters of educated men, are between the devil
and the deep sea. Behind us lies the patriarchal system; the
private house, with its nullity, its immorality, its hypocrisy, its
servility. Before us lies the public world, the professional
system, with its possessiveness, its jealousy, its pugnacity, its
greed. The one shuts us up like slaves in a harem; the other forces
us to circle, like caterpillars head to tail, round and round the
mulberry tree, the sacred tree, of property. It is a choice of
evils. Each is bad. Had we not better plunge off the bridge into
the river; give up the game; declare that the whole of human life
is a mistake and so end it?</p>

<p>'But before you take that step, Madam, a decisive one, unless
you share the opinion of the professors of the Church of England
that death is the gate of life&mdash;<i>Mors Janua Vitae</i> is
written upon an arch in St Paul's&mdash;in which case there is, of
course, much to recommend it, let us see if another answer is not
possible.</p>

<p>'Another answer may be staring us in the face on the shelves of
your own library, once more in the biographies. Is it not possible
that by considering the experiments that the dead have made with
their lives in the past we may find some help in answering the very
difficult question that is now forced upon us? At any rate, let us
try. The question that we will now put to biography is this: For
reasons given above we are agreed that we must earn money in the
professions. For reasons given above those professions seem to us
highly undesirable. The questions we put to you, lives of the dead,
is how can we enter the professions and yet remain civilized human
beings; human beings, that is, who wish to prevent war?</p>

<p>'This time let us turn to the lives not of men but of women in
the nineteenth century&mdash;to the lives of professional women.
But there would seem to be a gap in your library, Madam. There are
no lives of professional women in the nineteenth century. A Mrs
Tomlinson, the wife of a Mr Tomlinson, F.R.S., F.C.S., explains the
reason. This lady, who wrote a book "advocating the employment of
young ladies as nurses for children", says: ". . . it seemed as if
there were no way in which an unmarried lady could earn a living
but by taking a situation as governess, for which post she was
often unfit by nature and education, or want of
education."<sup><a href="#231">31</a></sup> That was written in
1859&mdash;less than 100 years ago. That explains the gap on your
shelves. There were no professional women, except governesses, to
have lives written of them. And the lives of governesses, that is
the written lives, can be counted on the fingers of one hand. What
then can we learn about the lives of professional women from
studying the lives of governesses? Happily old boxes are beginning
to give up their old secrets. Out the other day crept one such
document written about the year 1811. There was, it appears, an
obscure Miss Weeton, who used to scribble down her thoughts upon
professional life among other things when her pupils were in bed.
Here is one such thought. "Oh! how I have burned to learn Latin,
French, the Arts, the Sciences, anything rather than the dog trot
way of sewing, teaching, writing copies, and washing dishes every
day . . . Why are not females permitted to study physics, divinity,
astronomy, etc., etc., with their attendants, chemistry, botany,
logic, mathematics, &amp;c.?"<sup><a href="#232">32</a></sup> That
comment upon the lives of governesses, that question from the lips
of governesses, reaches us from the darkness. It is illuminating,
too. But let us go on groping; let us pick up a hint here and a
hint there as to the professions as they were practised by women in
the nineteenth century. Next we find Anne Clough, the sister of
Arthur Clough, pupil of Dr Arnold, Fellow of Oriel, who, though she
served without a salary, was the first principal of Newnham, and
thus may be called a professional woman in embryo&mdash;we find her
training for her profession by "doing much of the housework" . . .
"earning money to pay off what had been lent by their friends",
"pressing for leave to keep a small school", reading books her
brother lent her, and exclaiming, "If I were a man, I would not
work for riches, to make myself a name or to leave a wealthy family
behind me. No, I think I would work for my country, and make its
people my heirs."<sup><a href="#233">33</a></sup> The
nineteenth-century women were not without ambition it seems. Next
we find Josephine Butler, who, though not strictly speaking a
professional woman, led the campaign against the Contagious
Diseases Act to victory, and then the campaign against the sale and
purchase of children "for infamous purposes"&mdash;we find
Josephine Butler refusing to have a life of herself written, and
saying of the women who helped her in those campaigns: "The utter
absence in them of any desire for recognition, of any vestige of
egotism in any form, is worthy of remark. In the purity of their
motives they shine out 'clear as crystal'."<sup><a href=
"#234">34</a></sup> That, then, was one of the qualities that the
Victorian woman praised and practised&mdash;a negative one, it is
true; not to be recognized; not to be egotistical; to do the work
for the sake of doing the work.<sup><a href="#235">35</a></sup> An
interesting contribution to psychology in its way. And then we come
closer to our own time; we find Gertrude Bell, who, though the
diplomatic service was and is shut to women, occupied a post in the
East which almost entitled her to be called a
pseudo-diplomat&mdash;we find rather to our surprise that "Gertrude
could never go out in London without a female friend or, failing
that, a maid.<sup><a href="#236">36</a></sup> . . . when it seemed
unavoidable for Gertrude to drive in a hansom with a young man from
one tea party to another, she feels obliged to write and confess it
to my mother."<sup><a href="#237">37</a></sup> So they were chaste,
the women pseudo-diplomats of the Victorian Age?<sup><a href=
"#238">38</a></sup> And not merely in body; in mind also. "Gertrude
was not allowed to read Bourget's <i>The Disciple"</i> for fear of
contracting whatever disease that book may disseminate.
Dissatisfied but ambitious, ambitious but austere, chaste yet
adventurous&mdash;such are some of the qualities that we have
discovered. But let us go on looking&mdash;if not at the lines,
then between the lines of biography. And we find, between the lines
of their husbands' biographies, so many women practising&mdash;but
what are we to call the profession that consists in bringing nine
or ten children into the world, the profession which consists in
running a house, nursing an invalid, visiting the poor and the
sick, tending here an old father, there an old mother?&mdash;there
is no name and there is no pay for that profession; but we find so
many mothers, sisters and daughters of educated men practising it
in the nineteenth century that we must lump them and their lives
together behind their husbands' and brothers', and leave them to
deliver their message to those who have the time to extract it and
the imagination with which to decipher it. Let us ourselves, who as
you hint are pressed for time, sum up these random hints and
reflections upon the professional life of women in the nineteenth
century by quoting once more the highly significant words of a
woman who was not a professional woman in the strict sense of the
word, but had some nondescript reputation as a traveller
nevertheless&mdash;Mary Kingsley:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I don't know if I ever revealed the fact to you that being
allowed to learn German was <i>all</i> the paid-for education I
ever had. &pound;2,000 was spent on my brother's. I still hope not
in vain.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>'That statement is so suggestive that it may save us the bother
of groping and searching between the lines of professional men's
lives for the lives of their sisters. If we develop the suggestions
we find in that statement, and connect it with the other hints and
fragments that we have uncovered, we may arrive at some theory or
point of view that may help us to answer the very difficult
question, which now confronts us. For when Mary Kingsley says, ". .
. being allowed to learn German was <i>all</i> the paid-for
education I ever had", she suggests that she had an unpaid-for
education. The other lives that we have been examining corroborate
that suggestion. What then was the nature of that "unpaid-for
education" which, whether for good or for evil, has been ours for
so many centuries? If we mass the lives of the obscure behind four
lives that were not obscure, but were so successful and
distinguished that they were actually written, the lives of
Florence Nightingale, Miss Clough, Mary Kingsley and Gertrude Bell,
it seems undeniable that they were all educated by the same
teachers. And those teachers, biography indicates, obliquely, and
indirectly, but emphatically and indisputably none the less, were
poverty, chastity, derision, and&mdash;but what word covers "lack
of rights and privileges"? Shall we press the old word "freedom"
once more into service? "Freedom from unreal loyalties", then, was
the fourth of their teachers; that freedom from loyalty to old
schools, old colleges, old churches, old ceremonies, old countries
which all those women enjoyed, and which, to a great extent, we
still enjoy by the law and custom of England. We have no time to
coin new words, greatly though the language is in need of them. Let
"freedom from unreal loyalties" then stand as the fourth great
teacher of the daughters of educated men.</p>

<p>'Biography thus provides us with the fact that the daughters of
educated men received an unpaid-for education at the hands of
poverty, chastity, derision and freedom from unreal loyalties. It
was this unpaid for education, biography informs us, that fitted
them, aptly enough, for the unpaid-for professions. And biography
also informs us that those unpaid-for professions had their laws,
traditions, and labours no less certainly than the paid-for
professions. Further, the student of biography cannot possibly
doubt from the evidence of biography that this education and these
professions were in many ways bad in the extreme, both for the
unpaid themselves and for their descendants. The intensive
childbirth of the unpaid wife, the intensive money-making of the
paid husband in the Victorian age had terrible results, we cannot
doubt, upon the mind and body of the present age. To prove it we
need not quote once more the famous passage in which Florence
Nightingale denounced that education and its results; nor stress
the natural delight with which she greeted the Crimean war; nor
illustrate from other sources&mdash;they are, alas,
innumerable&mdash;the inanity, the pettiness, the spite, the
tyranny, the hypocrisy, the immorality which it engendered as the
lives of both sexes so abundantly testify. Final proof of its
harshness upon one sex at any rate can be found in the annals of
our "great war", when hospitals, harvest fields and munition works
were largely staffed by refugees flying from its horrors to their
comparative amenity.</p>

<p>'But biography is many-sided; biography never returns a single
and simple answer to any question that is asked of it. Thus the
biographies of those who had biographies&mdash;say Florence
Nightingale, Anne Clough, Emily Bront&euml;, Christina Rossetti,
Mary Kingsley&mdash;prove beyond a doubt that this same education,
the unpaid for, must have had great virtues as well as great
defects, for we cannot deny that these, if not educated, still were
civilized women. We cannot, when we consider the lives of our
uneducated mothers and grandmothers, judge education simply by its
power to "obtain appointments", to win honour, to make money. We
must if we are honest, admit that some who had no paid-for
education, no salaries and no appointments were civilized human
beings&mdash;whether or not they can rightly be called "English"
women is matter for dispute; and thus admit that we should be
extremely foolish if we threw away the results of that education or
gave up the knowledge that we have obtained from it for any bribe
or decoration whatsoever. Thus biography, when asked the question
we have put to it&mdash;how can we enter the professions and yet
remain civilized human beings, human beings who discourage war,
would seem to reply: If you refuse to be separated from the four
great teachers of the daughters of educated men&mdash;poverty,
chastity, derision and freedom from unreal loyalties&mdash;but
combine them with some wealth, some knowledge, and some service to
real loyalties then you can enter the professions and escape the
risks that make them undesirable.</p>

<p>'Such being the answer of the oracle, such are the conditions
attached to this guinea. You shall have it, to recapitulate, on
condition that you help all properly qualified people, of whatever
sex, class or colour, to enter your profession; and further on
condition that in the practice of your profession you refuse to be
separated from poverty, chastity, derision and freedom from unreal
loyalties. Is the statement now more positive, have the conditions
been made more clear and do you agree to the terms? You hesitate.
Some of the conditions, you seem to suggest, need further
discussion. Let us take them, then, in order. By poverty is meant
enough money to live upon. That is, you must earn enough to be
independent of any other human being and to buy that modicum of
health, leisure, knowledge and so on that is needed for the full
development of body and mind. But no more. Not a penny more.</p>

<p>'By chastity is meant that when you have made enough to live on
by your profession you must refuse to sell your brain for the sake
of money. That is you must cease to practise your profession, or
practise it for the sake of research and experiment; or, if you are
an artist, for the sake of the art; or give the knowledge acquired
professionally to those who need it for nothing. But directly the
mulberry tree begins to make you circle, break off. Pelt the tree
with laughter.</p>

<p>'By derision&mdash;a bad word, but once again the English
language is much in need of new words&mdash;is meant that you must
refuse all methods of advertising merit, and hold that ridicule,
obscurity and censure are preferable, for psychological reasons, to
fame and praise. Directly badges, orders, or degrees are offered
you, fling them back in the giver's face.</p>

<p>'By freedom from unreal loyalties is meant that you must rid
yourself of pride and nationality in the first place; also of
religious pride, college pride, school pride, family pride, sex
pride and those unreal loyalties that spring from them. Directly
the seducers come with their seductions to bribe you into
captivity, tear up the parchments; refuse to fill up the forms.</p>

<p>'And if you still object that these definitions are both too
arbitrary and too general, and ask how anybody can tell how much
money and how much knowledge are needed for the full development of
body and mind, and which are the real loyalties which we must serve
and which the unreal which we must despise, I can only refer
you&mdash;time presses&mdash;to two authorities. One is familiar
enough. It is the psychometer that you carry on your wrist, the
little instrument upon which you depend in all personal
relationships. If it were visible it would look something like a
thermometer. It has a vein of quicksilver in it which is affected
by any body or soul, house or society in whose presence it is
exposed. If you want to find out how much wealth is desirable,
expose it in a rich man's presence; how much learning is desirable
expose it in a learned man's presence. So with patriotism, religion
and the rest. The conversation need not be interrupted while you
consult it; nor its amenity disturbed. But if you object that this
is too personal and fallible a method to employ without risk of
mistake, witness the fact that the private psychometer has led to
many unfortunate marriages and broken friendships, then there is
the other authority now easily within the reach even of the poorest
of the daughters of educated men. Go to the public galleries and
look at pictures; turn on the wireless and rake down music from the
air; enter any of the public libraries which are now free to all.
There you will be able to consult the findings of the public
psychometer for yourself. To take one example, since we are pressed
for time. The <i>Antigone</i> of Sophocles has been done into
English prose or verse by a man whose name is
immaterial.<sup><a href="#239">39</a></sup> Consider the character
of Creon. There you have a most profound analysis by a poet, who is
a psychologist in action, of the effect of power and wealth upon
the soul. Consider Creon's claim to absolute rule over his
subjects. That is a far more instructive analysis of tyranny than
any our politicians can offer us. You want to know which are the
unreal loyalties which we must despise, which are the real
loyalties which we must honour? Consider Antigone's distinction
between the laws and the Law. That is a far more profound statement
of the duties of the individual to society than any our
sociologists can offer us. Lame as the English rendering is,
Antigone's five words are worth all the sermons of all the
archbishops.<sup><a href="#240">40</a></sup> But to enlarge would
be impertinent. Private judgement is still free in private and that
freedom is the essence of freedom.</p>

<p>'For the rest, though the conditions may seem many and the
guinea, alas, is single, they are not for the most part as things
are at present very difficult of fulfilment. With the exception of
the first&mdash;that we must earn enough money to live
upon&mdash;they are largely ensured us by the laws of England. The
law of England sees to it that we do not inherit great possessions;
the law of England denies us, and let us hope will long continue to
deny us, the full stigma of nationality. Then we can scarcely doubt
that our brothers will provide us for many centuries to come, as
they have done for many centuries past, with what is so essential
for sanity, and so invaluable in preventing the great modern sins
of vanity, egotism, megalomania&mdash;that is to say ridicule,
censure and contempt.<sup><a href="#241">41</a></sup> And so long
as the Church of England refuses our services&mdash;long may she
exclude us!&mdash;and the ancient schools and colleges refuse to
admit us to a share of their endowments and privileges we shall be
immune without any trouble on our part from the particular
loyalties and fealties which such endowments and privileges
engender. Further, Madam, the traditions of the private house, that
ancestral memory which lies behind the present moment, are there to
help you. We have seen in the quotations given above how great a
part chastity, bodily chastity, has played in the unpaid education
of our sex. It should not be difficult to transmute the old ideal
of bodily chastity into the new ideal of mental chastity&mdash;to
hold that if it was wrong to sell the body for money it is much
more wrong to sell the mind for money, since the mind, people say,
is nobler than the body. Then again, are we not greatly fortified
in resisting the seductions of the most powerful of all
seducers&mdash;money&mdash;by those same traditions? For how many
centuries have we not enjoyed the right of working all day and
every day for &pound;40 a year with board and lodging thrown in?
And does not Whitaker prove that half the work of educated men's
daughters is still unpaid-for work? Finally, honour, fame,
consequence&mdash;is it not easy for us to resist that seduction,
we who have worked for centuries without other honour than that
which is reflected from the coronets and badges on our father's or
husband's brows and breasts?</p>

<p>'Thus, with law on our side, and property on our side, and
ancestral memory to guide us, there is no need of further argument;
you will agree that the conditions upon which this guinea is yours
are, with the exception of the first, comparatively easy to fulfil.
They merely require that you should develop, modify and direct by
the findings of the two psychometers the traditions and the
education of the private house which have been in existence these
2,000 years. And if you will agree to do that, there can be an end
of bargaining between us. Then the guinea with which to pay the
rent of your house is yours&mdash;would that it were a thousand!
For if you agree to these terms then you can join the professions
and yet remain uncontaminated by them; you can rid them of their
possessiveness, their jealousy, their pugnacity, their greed. You
can use them to have a mind of your own and a will of your own. And
you can use that mind and will to abolish the inhumanity, the
beastliness, the horror, the folly of war. Take this guinea then
and use it, not to burn the house down, but to make its windows
blaze. And let the daughters of uneducated women dance round the
new house, the poor house, the house that stands in a narrow street
where omnibuses pass and the street hawkers cry their wares, and
let them sing, "We have done with war! We have done with tyranny!"
And their mothers will laugh from their graves, "It was for this
that we suffered obloquy and contempt! Light up the windows of the
new house, daughters! Let them blaze!"</p>

<p>'Those then are the terms upon which I give you this guinea with
which to help the daughters of uneducated women to enter the
professions. And by cutting short the peroration let us hope that
you will be able to give the finishing touches to your bazaar,
arrange the hare and the coffee-pot, and receive the Right
Honourable Sir Sampson Legend, O.M., K.C.B., LL.D., D.C.L., P.C.,
etc., with that air of smiling deference which befits the daughter
of an educated man in the presence of her brother.'</p>

<p>Such then, Sir, was the letter finally sent to the honorary
treasurer of the society for helping the daughters of educated men
to enter the professions. Those are the conditions upon which she
is to have her guinea. They have been framed, so far as possible,
to ensure that she shall do all that a guinea can make her do to
help you to prevent war. Whether the conditions have been rightly
laid down, who shall say? But as you will see, it was necessary to
answer her letter and the letter from the honorary treasurer of the
college rebuilding fund, and to send them both guineas before
answering your letter, because unless they are helped, first to
educate the daughters of educated men, and then to earn their
living in the professions, those daughters cannot possess an
independent and disinterested influence with which to help you to
prevent war. The causes it seems are connected. But having shown
this to the best of our ability, let us return to your own letter
and to your request for a subscription to your own society.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch3" id="ch3"></a>Three</h2>

<p>Here then is your own letter. In that, as we have seen, after
asking for an opinion as to how to prevent war, you go on to
suggest certain practical measures by which we can help you to
prevent it. These are it appears that we should sign a manifesto,
pledging ourselves 'to protect culture and intellectual
liberty';<sup><a href="#301">1</a></sup> that we should join a
certain society, devoted to certain measures whose aim is to
preserve peace; and, finally, that we should subscribe to that
society which like the others is in need of funds.</p>

<p>First, then, let us consider how we can help you to prevent war
by protecting culture and intellectual liberty, since you assure us
that there is a connection between those rather abstract words and
these very positive photographs&mdash;the photographs of dead
bodies and ruined houses.</p>

<p>But if it was surprising to be asked for an opinion how to
prevent war, it is still more surprising to be asked to help you in
the rather abstract terms of your manifesto to protect culture and
intellectual liberty. Consider, Sir, in the light of the facts
given above, what this request of yours means. It means that in the
year 1938 the sons of educated men are asking the daughters to help
them to protect culture and intellectual liberty. And why, you may
ask, is that so surprising? Suppose that the Duke of Devonshire, in
his star and garter, stepped down into the kitchen and said to the
maid who was peeling potatoes with a smudge on her cheek: 'Stop
your potato peeling, Mary, and help me to construe this rather
difficult passage in Pindar,' would not Mary be surprised and run
screaming to Louisa the cook, 'Lawks, Louie, Master must be mad!'
That, or something like it, is the cry that rises to our lips when
the sons of educated men ask us, their sisters, to protect
intellectual liberty and culture. But let us try to translate the
kitchen-maid's cry into the language of educated people.</p>

<p>Once more we must beg you, Sir, to look from our angle, from our
point of view, at Arthur's Education Fund. Try once more, difficult
though it is to twist your head in that direction, to understand
what it has meant to us to keep that receptacle filled all these
centuries so that some 10,000 of our brothers may be educated every
year at Oxford and Cambridge. It has meant that we have already
contributed to the cause of culture and intellectual liberty more
than any other class in the community. For have not the daughters
of educated men paid into Arthur's Education Fund from the year
1262 to the year 1870 all the money that was needed to educate
themselves, bating such miserable sums as went to pay the
governess, the German teacher, and the dancing master? Have they
not paid with their own education for Eton and Harrow, Oxford and
Cambridge, and all the great schools and universities on the
continent&mdash;the Sorbonne and Heidelberg, Salamanca and Padua
and Rome? Have they not paid so generously and lavishly if so
indirectly, that when at last, in the nineteenth century, they won
the right to some paid-for education for themselves, there was not
a single woman who had received enough paid-for education to be
able to teach them?<sup><a href="#302">2</a></sup> And now, out of
the blue, just as they were hoping that they might filch not only a
little of that same university education for themselves but some of
the trimmings&mdash;travel, pleasure, liberty&mdash;for themselves,
here is your letter informing them that the whole of that vast,
that fabulous sum&mdash;for whether counted directly in cash, or
indirectly in things done without, the sum that filled Arthur's
Education Fund is vast&mdash;has been wasted or wrongly applied.
With what other purpose were the universities of Oxford and
Cambridge founded, save to protect culture and intellectual
liberty? For what other object did your sisters go without teaching
or travel or luxuries themselves except that with the money so
saved their brothers should go to schools and universities and
there learn to protect culture and intellectual liberty? But now
since you proclaim them in danger and ask us to add our voice to
yours, and our sixpence to your guinea, we must assume that the
money so spent was wasted and that those societies have failed.
Yet, the reflection must intrude, if the public schools and
universities with their elaborate machinery for mind-training and
body-training have failed, what reason is there to think that your
society, sponsored though it is by distinguished names, is going to
succeed, or that your manifesto, signed though it is by still more
distinguished names, is going to convert? Ought you not, before you
lease an office, hire a secretary, elect a committee and appeal for
funds, to consider why those schools and universities have
failed?</p>

<p>That, however, is a question for you to answer. The question
which concerns us is what possible help we can give you in
protecting culture and intellectual liberty&mdash;we, who have been
shut out from the universities so repeatedly, and are only now
admitted so restrictedly; we who have received no paid-for
education whatsoever, or so little that we can only read our own
tongue and write our own language, we who are, in fact, members not
of the intelligentsia but of the ignorantsia? To confirm us in our
modest estimate of our own culture and to prove that you in fact
share it there is Whitaker with his facts. Not a single educated
man's daughter, Whitaker says, is thought capable of teaching the
literature of her own language at either university. Nor is her
opinion worth asking, Whitaker informs us, when it comes to buying
a picture for the National Gallery, a portrait for the Portrait
Gallery, or a mummy for the British Museum. How then can it be
worth your while to ask us to protect culture and intellectual
liberty when, as Whitaker proves with his cold facts, you have no
belief that our advice is worth having when it comes to spending
the money, to which we have contributed, in buying culture and
intellectual liberty for the State? Do you wonder that the
unexpected compliment takes us by surprise? Still, there is your
letter. There are facts in that letter, too. In it you say that war
is imminent; and you go on to say, in more languages than
one&mdash;here is the French version:<sup><a href=
"#303">3</a></sup> <i>Seule la culture
d&eacute;sint&eacute;ress&eacute;e peut garder le monde de sa
ruine&mdash;</i>you go on to say that by protecting intellectual
liberty and our inheritance of culture we can help you to prevent
war. And since the first statement at least is indisputable and any
kitchenmaid even if her French is defective can read and understand
the meaning of 'Air Raid Precautions' when written in large letters
upon a blank wall, we cannot ignore your request on the plea of
ignorance or remain silent on the plea of modesty. Just as any
kitchen-maid would attempt to construe a passage in Pindar if told
that her life depended on it, so the daughters of educated men,
however little their training qualifies them, must consider what
they can do to protect culture and intellectual liberty if by so
doing they can help you to prevent war. So let us by all means in
our power examine this further method of helping you, and see,
before we consider your request that we should join your society,
whether we can sign this manifesto in favour of culture and
intellectual liberty with some intention of keeping our word.</p>

<p>What, then, is the meaning of those rather abstract words? If we
are to help you to protect them it would be well to define them in
the first place. But like all honorary treasurers you are pressed
for time, and to ramble through English literature in search of a
definition, though a delightful pastime in its way, might well lead
us far. Let us agree, then, for the present, that we know what they
are, and concentrate upon the practical question how we can help
you to protect them. Now the daily paper with its provision of
facts lies on the table; and a single quotation from it may save
time and limit our inquiry. 'It was decided yesterday at a
conference of head masters that women were not fit teachers for
boys over the age of fourteen.' That fact is of instant help to us
here, for it proves that certain kinds of help are beyond our
reach. For us to attempt to reform the education of our brothers at
public schools and universities would be to invite a shower of dead
cats, rotten eggs and broken gates from which only street
scavengers and locksmiths would benefit, while the gentlemen in
authority, history assures us, would survey the tumult from their
study windows without taking the cigars from their lips or ceasing
to sip, slowly as its bouquet deserves, their admirable
claret.<sup><a href="#304">4</a></sup> The teaching of history,
then, reinforced by the teaching of the daily paper, drives us to a
more restricted position. We can only help you to defend culture
and intellectual liberty by defending our own culture and our own
intellectual liberty. That is to say, we can hint, if the treasurer
of one of the women's colleges asks us for a subscription, that
some change might be made in that satellite body when it ceases to
be satellite; or again, if the treasurer of some society for
obtaining professional employment for women asks us for a
subscription, suggest that some change might be desirable, in the
interests of culture and intellectual liberty, in the practice of
the professions. But as paid-for education is still raw and young,
and as the number of those allowed to enjoy it at Oxford and
Cambridge is still strictly limited, culture for the great majority
of educated men's daughters must still be that which is acquired
outside the sacred gates, in public libraries or in private
libraries, whose doors by some unaccountable oversight have been
left unlocked. It must still, in the year 1938, largely consist in
reading and writing our own tongue. The question thus becomes more
manageable. Shorn of its glory it is easier to deal with. What we
have to do now, then, Sir, is to lay your request before the
daughters of educated men and to ask them to help you to prevent
war, not by advising their brothers how they shall protect culture
and intellectual liberty, but simply by reading and writing their
own tongue in such a way as to protect those rather abstract
goddesses themselves.</p>

<p>This would seem, on the face of it, a simple matter, and one
that needs neither argument nor rhetoric. But we are met at the
outset by a new difficulty. We have already noted the fact that the
profession of literature, to give it a simple name, is the only
profession which did not fight a series of battles in the
nineteenth century. There has been no battle of Grub Street. That
profession has never been shut to the daughters of educated men.
This was due of course to the extreme cheapness of its professional
requirements. Books, pens and paper are so cheap, reading and
writing have been, since the eighteenth century at least, so
universally taught in our class, that it was impossible for any
body of men to corner the necessary knowledge or to refuse
admittance, except on their own terms, to those who wished to read
books or to write them. But it follows, since the profession of
literature is open to the daughters of educated men, that there is
no honorary treasurer of the profession in such need of a guinea
with which to prosecute her battle that she will listen to our
terms, and promise to do what she can to observe them. This places
us, you will agree, in an awkward predicament. For how then can we
bring pressure upon them&mdash;what can we do to persuade them to
help us? The profession of literature differs, it would seem, from
all the other professions. There is no head of the profession; no
Lord Chancellor as in your own case: no official body with the
power to lay down rules and enforce them.<sup><a href=
"#305">5</a></sup> We cannot debar women from the use of
libraries;<sup><a href="#306">6</a></sup> or forbid them to buy ink
and paper; or rule that metaphors shall only be used by one sex, as
the male only in art schools was allowed to study from the nude; or
rule that rhyme shall be used by one sex only as the male only in
Academies of music was allowed to play in orchestras. Such is the
inconceivable licence of the profession of letters that any
daughter of an educated man may use a man's name&mdash;say George
Eliot or George Sand&mdash;with the result that an editor or a
publisher, unlike the authorities in Whitehall, can detect no
difference in the scent or savour of a manuscript, or even know for
certain whether the writer is married or not.</p>

<p>Thus, since we have very little power over those who earn their
livings by reading and writing, we must go to them humbly without
bribes or penalties. We must go to them cap in hand, like beggars,
and ask them of their goodness to spare time to listen to our
request that they shall practise the profession of reading and
writing in the interests of culture and intellectual liberty.</p>

<p>And now, clearly, some further definition of 'culture and
intellectual liberty' would be useful. Fortunately, it need not be,
for our purposes, exhaustive or elaborate. We need not consult
Milton, Goethe, or Matthew Arnold; for their definition would apply
to paid-for culture&mdash;the culture which, in Miss Weeton's
definition, includes physics, divinity, astronomy, chemistry,
botany, logic and mathematics, as well as Latin, Greek and French.
We are appealing in the main to those whose culture is the
unpaid-for culture, that which consists in being able to read and
write their own tongue. Happily your manifesto is at hand to help
us to define the terms further; 'disinterested' is the word you
use. Therefore let us define culture for our purposes as the
disinterested pursuit of reading and writing the English language.
And intellectual liberty may be defined for our purposes as the
right to say or write what you think in your own words, and in your
own way. These are very crude definitions, but they must serve. Our
appeal then might begin: 'Oh, daughters of educated men, this
gentleman, whom we all respect, says that war is imminent; by
protecting culture and intellectual liberty he says that we can
help him to prevent war. We entreat you, therefore, who earn your
livings by reading and writing . . .' But here the words falter on
our lips, and the prayer peters out into three separate dots
because of facts again&mdash;because of facts in books, facts in
biographies, facts which make it difficult, perhaps impossible, to
go on.</p>

<p>What are those facts then? Once more we must interrupt our
appeal in order to examine them. And there is no difficulty in
finding them. Here, for example, is an illuminating document before
us, a most genuine and indeed moving piece of work, the
autobiography of Mrs Oliphant, which is full of facts. She was an
educated man's daughter who earned her living by reading and
writing. She wrote books of all kinds. Novels, biographies,
histories, handbooks of Florence and Rome, reviews, newspaper
articles innumerable came from her pen. With the proceeds she
earned her living and educated her children. But how far did she
protect culture and intellectual liberty? That you can judge for
yourself by reading first a few of her novels; <i>The Duke's
Daughter, Diana Trelawny, Harry Joscelyn,</i> say; continue with
the lives of Sheridan and Cervantes; go on to the <i>Makers of</i>
<i>Florence and Rome;</i> conclude by sousing yourself in the
innumerable faded articles, reviews, sketches of one kind and
another which she contributed to literary papers. When you have
done, examine the state of your own mind, and ask yourself whether
that reading has led you to respect disinterested culture and
intellectual liberty. Has it not on the contrary smeared your mind
and dejected your imagination, and led you to deplore the fact that
Mrs Oliphant sold her brain, her very admirable brain, prostituted
her culture and enslaved her intellectual liberty in order that she
might earn her living and educate her children?<sup><a href=
"#307">7</a></sup> Inevitably, considering the damage that poverty
inflicts upon mind and body, the necessity that is laid upon those
who have children to see that they are fed and clothed, nursed and
educated, we have to applaud her choice and to admire her courage.
But if we applaud the choice and admire the courage of those who do
what she did, we can spare ourselves the trouble of addressing our
appeal to them, for they will no more be able to protect
disinterested culture and intellectual liberty than she was. To ask
them to sign your manifesto would be to ask a publican to sign a
manifesto in favour of temperance. He may himself be a total
abstainer; but since his wife and children depend upon the sale of
beer, he must continue to sell beer, and his signature to the
manifesto would be of no value to the cause of temperance because
directly he had signed it he must be at the counter inducing his
customers to drink more beer. So to ask the daughters of educated
men who have to earn their livings by reading and writing to sign
your manifesto would be of no value to the cause of disinterested
culture and intellectual liberty, because directly they had signed
it they must be at the desk writing those books, lectures and
articles by which culture is prostituted and intellectual liberty
is sold into slavery. As an expression of opinion it may have
value; but if what you need is not merely an expression of opinion
but positive help, you must frame your request rather differently.
Then you will have to ask them to pledge themselves not to write
anything that denies culture, or to sign any contract that
infringes intellectual liberty. And to that the answer given us by
biography would be short but sufficient: Have I not to earn my
living? Thus, Sir, it becomes clear that we must make our appeal
only to those daughters of educated men who have enough to live
upon. To them we might address ourselves in this wise: 'Daughters
of educated men who have enough to live upon . . .' But again the
voice falters: again the prayer peters out into separate dots. For
how many of them are there? Dare we assume in the face of Whitaker,
of the laws of property, of the wills in the newspapers, of facts
in short, that 1,000, 500, or even 250 will answer when thus
addressed? However that may be, let the plural stand and continue:
'Daughters of educated men who have enough to live upon, and read
and write your own language for your own pleasure, may we very
humbly entreat you to sign this gentleman's manifesto with some
intention of putting your promise into practice?'</p>

<p>Here, if indeed they consent to listen, they might very
reasonably ask us to be more explicit&mdash;not indeed to define
culture and intellectual liberty, for they have books and leisure
and can define the words for themselves. But what, they may well
ask, is meant by this gentleman's 'disinterested' culture, and how
are we to protect that and intellectual liberty in practice? Now as
they are daughters, not sons, we may begin by reminding them of a
compliment once paid them by a great historian. 'Mary's conduct,'
says Macaulay, 'was really a signal instance of that perfect
disinterestedness and self-devotion of which man seems to be
incapable, but which is sometimes found in women.'<sup><a href=
"#308">8</a></sup> Compliments, when you are asking a favour, never
come amiss. Next let us refer them to the tradition which has long
been honoured in the private house&mdash;the tradition of chastity.
'Just as for many centuries, Madam,' we might plead, 'it was
thought vile for a woman to sell her body without love, but right
to give it to the husband whom she loved, so it is wrong, you will
agree, to sell your mind without love, but right to give it to the
art which you love.' 'But what,' she may ask, 'is meant by "selling
your mind without love"?' 'Briefly,' we might reply, 'to write at
the command of another person what you do not want to write for the
sake of money. But to sell a brain is worse than to sell a body,
for when the body seller has sold her momentary pleasure she takes
good care that the matter shall end there. But when a brain seller
has sold her brain, its anaemic, vicious and diseased progeny are
let loose upon the world to infect and corrupt and sow the seeds of
disease in others. Thus we are asking you, Madam, to pledge
yourself not to commit adultery of the brain because it is a much
more serious offence than the other.' 'Adultery of the brain,' she
may reply, 'means writing what I do not want to write for the sake
of money. Therefore you ask me to refuse all publishers, editors,
lecture agents and so on who bribe me to write or to speak what I
do not want to write or to speak for the sake of money?' 'That is
so, Madam; and we further ask that if you should receive proposals
for such sales you will resent them and expose them as you would
resent and expose such proposals for selling your body, both for
your own sake and for the sake of others. But we would have you
observe that the verb "to adulterate" means, according to the
dictionary, "to falsify by admixture of baser ingredients." Money
is not the only baser ingredient. Advertisement and publicity are
also adulterers. Thus, culture mixed with personal charm, or
culture mixed with advertisement and publicity, are also
adulterated forms of culture. We must ask you to abjure them; not
to appear on public platforms; not to lecture; not to allow your
private face to be published, or details of your private life; not
to avail yourself, in short, of any of the forms of brain
prostitution which are so insidiously suggested by the pimps and
panders of the brain-selling trade; or to accept any of those
baubles and labels by which brain merit is advertised and
certified&mdash;medals, honours, degrees&mdash;we must ask you to
refuse them absolutely, since they are all tokens that culture has
been prostituted and intellectual liberty sold into captivity.'</p>

<p>Upon hearing this definition, mild and imperfect as it is, of
what it means, not merely to sign your manifesto in favour of
culture and intellectual liberty, but to put that opinion into
practice, even those daughters of educated men who have enough to
live upon may object that the terms are too hard for them to keep.
For they would mean loss of money, which is desirable, loss of fame
which is universally held to be agreeable, and censure and ridicule
which are by no means negligible. Each would be the butt of all who
have an interest to serve or money to make from the sale of brains.
And for what reward? Only, in the rather abstract terms of your
manifesto, that they would thus 'protect culture and intellectual
liberty', not by their opinion but by their practice.</p>

<p>Since the terms are so hard, and there is no body in existence
whose ruling they need respect or obey, let us consider what other
method of persuasion is left to us. Only, it would seem, to point
to the photographs&mdash;the photographs of dead bodies and ruined
houses. Can we bring out the connection between them and
prostituted culture and intellectual slavery and make it so clear
that the one implies the other, that the daughters of educated men
will prefer to refuse money and fame, and to be the objects of
scorn and ridicule rather than suffer themselves, or allow others
to suffer, the penalties there made visible? It is difficult in the
short time at our disposal, and with the weak weapons in our
possession, to make that connection clear, but if what you, Sir,
say is true, and there is a connection and a very real one between
them, we must try to prove it.</p>

<p>Let us then begin by summoning, if only from the world of
imagination, some daughter of an educated man who has enough to
live upon and can read and write for her own pleasure and, taking
her to be the representative of what may in fact be no class at
all, let us ask her to examine the products of that reading and
writing which lie upon her own table. 'Look, Madam,' we might
begin, 'at the newspapers on your table. Why, may we ask, do you
take in three dailies, and three weeklies?' 'Because,' she replies,
'I am interested in politics, and wish to know the facts.' 'An
admirable desire, Madam. But why three? Do they differ then about
facts, and if so, why?' To which she replies, with some irony, 'You
call yourself an educated man's daughter, and yet pretend not to
know the facts&mdash;roughly that each paper is financed by a
board; that each board has a policy; that each board employs
writers to expound that policy, and if the writers do not agree
with that policy, the writers, as you may remember after a moment's
reflection, find themselves unemployed in the street. Therefore if
you want to know any fact about politics you must read at least
three different papers, compare at least three different versions
of the same fact, and come in the end to your own conclusion. Hence
the three daily papers on my table.' Now that we have discussed,
very briefly, what may be called the literature of fact, let us
turn to what may be called the literature of fiction. 'There are
such things, Madam,' we may remind her, 'as pictures, plays, music
and books. Do you pursue the same rather extravagant policy
there&mdash;glance at three daily papers and three weekly papers if
you want to know the facts about pictures, plays, music and books,
because those who write about art are in the pay of an editor, who
is in the pay of a board, which has a policy to pursue, so that
each paper takes a different view, so that it is only by comparing
three different views that you can come to your own
conclusion&mdash;what pictures to see, what play or concert to go
to, which book to order from the library?' And to that she replies,
'Since I am an educated man's daughter, with a smattering of
culture picked up from reading, I should no more dream, given the
conditions of journalism at present, of taking my opinions of
pictures, plays, music or books from the newspapers than I would
take my opinion of politics from the newspapers. Compare the views,
make allowance for the distortions, and then judge for yourself.
That is the only way. Hence the many newspapers on my
table.'<sup><a href="#309">9</a></sup></p>

<p>So then the literature of fact and the literature of opinion, to
make a crude distinction, are not pure fact, or pure opinion, but
adulterated fact and adulterated opinion, that is fact and opinion
'adulterated by the admixture of baser ingredients' as the
dictionary has it. In other words you have to strip each statement
of its money motive, of its power motive, of its advertisement
motive, of its publicity motive, of its vanity motive, let alone of
all the other motives which, as an educated man's daughter, are
familiar to you, before you make up your mind which fact about
politics to believe, or even which opinion about art? 'That is so,'
she agrees. But if you were told by somebody who had none of those
motives for wrapping up truth that the fact was in his or her
opinion this or that, you would believe him or her, always allowing
of course for the fallibility of human judgement which, in judging
works of art, must be considerable? 'Naturally,' she agrees. If
such a person said that war was bad, you would believe him; or if
such a person said that some picture, symphony, play or poem were
good you would believe him? 'Allowing for human fallibility, yes.'
Now suppose, Madam, that there were 250 or 50, or 25 such people in
existence, people pledged not to commit adultery of the brain, so
that it was unnecessary to strip what they said of its money
motive, power motive, advertisement motive, publicity motive,
vanity motive and so on, before we unwrapped the grain of truth,
might not two very remarkable consequences follow? Is it not
possible that if we knew the truth about war, the glory of war
would be scotched and crushed where it lies curled up in the rotten
cabbage leaves of our prostituted fact-purveyors; and if we knew
the truth about art instead of shuffling and shambling through the
smeared and dejected pages of those who must live by prostituting
culture, the enjoyment and practice of art would become so
desirable that by comparison the pursuit of war would be a tedious
game for elderly dilettantes in search of a mildly sanitary
amusement&mdash;the tossing of bombs instead of balls over
frontiers instead of nets? In short, if newspapers were written by
people whose sole object in writing was to tell the truth about
politics and the truth about art we should not believe in war, and
we should believe in art.</p>

<p>Hence there is a very clear connection between culture and
intellectual liberty and those photographs of dead bodies and
ruined houses. And to ask the daughters of educated men who have
enough to live upon to commit adultery of the brain is to ask them
to help in the most positive way now open to them&mdash;since the
profession of literature is still that which stands widest open to
them&mdash;to prevent war.</p>

<p>Thus, Sir, we might address this lady, crudely, briefly it is
true; but time passes and we cannot define further. And to this
appeal she might well reply, if indeed she exists: 'What you say is
obvious; so obvious that every educated man's daughter already
knows it for herself, or if she does not, has only to read the
newspapers to be sure of it. But suppose she were well enough off
not merely to sign this manifesto in favour of disinterested
culture and intellectual liberty but to put her opinion into
practice, how could she set about it? And do not,' she may
reasonably add, 'dream dreams about ideal worlds behind the stars;
consider actual facts in the actual world.' Indeed, the actual
world is much more difficult to deal with than the dream world.
Still, Madam, the private printing press is an actual fact, and not
beyond the reach of a moderate income. Typewriters and duplicators
are actual facts and even cheaper. By using these cheap and so far
unforbidden instruments you can at once rid yourself of the
pressure of boards, policies and editors. They will speak your own
mind, in your own words, at your own time, at your own length, at
your own bidding. And that, we are agreed, is our definition of
'intellectual liberty.' 'But,' she may say, '"the public"? How can
that be reached without putting my own mind through the mincing
machine and turning it into sausage?' '"The public," Madam,' we may
assure her, 'is very like ourselves; it lives in rooms; it walks in
streets, and is said moreover to be tired of sausage. Fling
leaflets down basements; expose them on stalls; trundle them along
streets on barrows to be sold for a penny or given away. Find out
new ways of approaching "the public"; single it into separate
people instead of massing it into one monster, gross in body,
feeble in mind. And then reflect&mdash;since you have enough to
live on, you have a room, not necessarily "cosy" or "handsome" but
still silent, private; a room where safe from publicity and its
poison you could, even asking a reasonable fee for the service,
speak the truth to artists, about pictures, music, books, without
fear of affecting their sales, which are exiguous, or wounding
their vanity, which is prodigious.<sup><a href="#310">10</a></sup>
Such at least was the criticism that Ben Jonson gave Shakespeare at
the Mermaid and there is no reason to suppose, with <i>Hamlet</i>
as evidence, that literature suffered in consequence. Are not the
best critics private people, and is not the only criticism worth
having spoken criticism? Those then are some of the active ways in
which you, as a writer of your own tongue, can put your opinion
into practice. But if you are passive, a reader, not a writer, then
you must adopt not active but passive methods of protecting culture
and intellectual liberty.' 'And what may they be?' she will ask.
'To abstain, obviously. Not to subscribe to papers that encourage
intellectual slavery; not to attend lectures that prostitute
culture; for we are agreed that to write at the command of another
what you do not want to write is to be enslaved, and to mix culture
with personal charm or advertisement is to prostitute culture. By
these active and passive measures you would do all in your power to
break the ring, the vicious circle, the dance round and round the
mulberry tree, the poison tree of intellectual harlotry. The ring
once broken, the captives would be freed. For who can doubt that
once writers had the chance of writing what they enjoy writing they
would find it so much more pleasurable that they would refuse to
write on any other terms; or that readers once they had the chance
of reading what writers enjoy writing, would find it so much more
nourishing than what is written for money that they would refuse to
be palmed off with the stale substitute any longer? Thus the slaves
who are now kept hard at work piling words into books, piling words
into articles, as the old slaves piled stones into pyramids, would
shake the manacles from their wrists and give up their loathsome
labour. And "culture", that amorphous bundle, swaddled up as she
now is in insincerity, emitting half truths from her timid lips,
sweetening and diluting her message with whatever sugar or water
serves to swell the writer's fame or his master's purse, would
regain her shape and become, as Milton, Keats and other great
writers assure us that she is in reality, muscular, adventurous,
free. Whereas now, Madam, at the very mention of culture the head
aches, the eyes close, the doors shut, the air thickens; we are in
a lecture room, rank with the fumes of stale print, listening to a
gentleman who is forced to lecture or to write every Wednesday,
every Sunday, about Milton or about Keats, while the lilac shakes
its branches in the garden free, and the gulls, swirling and
swooping, suggest with wild laughter that such stale fish might
with advantage be tossed to them. That is our plea to you, Madam;
those are our reasons for urging it. Do not merely sign this
manifesto in favour of culture and intellectual liberty; attempt at
least to put your promise into practice.'</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Whether the daughters of educated men who have enough to live
upon and read and write their own tongue for their own pleasure
will listen to this request or not, we cannot say, Sir. But if
culture and intellectual liberty are to be protected, not by
opinions merely but by practice, this would seem to be the way. It
is not an easy way, it is true. Nevertheless, such as it is, there
are reasons for thinking that the way is easier for them than for
their brothers. They are immune, through no merit of their own,
from certain compulsions. To protect culture and intellectual
liberty in practice would mean, as we have said, ridicule and
chastity, loss of publicity and poverty. But those, as we have
seen, are their familiar teachers. Further, Whitaker with his facts
is at hand to help them; for since he proves that all the fruits of
professional culture&mdash;such as directorships of art galleries
and museums, professorships and lectureships and
editorships&mdash;are still beyond their reach, they should be able
to take a more purely disinterested view of culture than their
brothers, without for a moment claiming, as Macaulay asserts, that
they are by nature more disinterested. Thus helped by tradition and
by facts as they are, we have not only some right to ask them to
help us to break the circle, the vicious circle of prostituted
culture, but some hope that if such people exist they will help us.
To return then to your manifesto: we will sign it if we can keep
these terms; if we cannot keep them, we will not sign it.</p>

<p>Now that we have tried to see how we can help you to prevent war
by attempting to define what is meant by protecting culture and
intellectual liberty let us consider your next and inevitable
request: that we should subscribe to the funds of your society. For
you, too, are an honorary treasurer, and like the other honorary
treasurers in need of money. Since you, too, are asking for money
it might be possible to ask you, also, to define your aims, and to
bargain and to impose terms as with the other honorary treasurers.
What then are the aims of your society? To prevent war, of course.
And by what means? Broadly speaking, by protecting the rights of
the individual; by opposing dictatorship; by ensuring the
democratic ideals of equal opportunity for all. Those are the chief
means by which as you say, 'the lasting peace of the world can be
assured.' Then, Sir, there is no need to bargain or to haggle. If
those are your aims, and if, as it is impossible to doubt, you mean
to do all in your power to achieve them, the guinea is
yours&mdash;would that it were a million! The guinea is yours; and
the guinea is a free gift, given freely.</p>

<p>But the word 'free' is used so often, and has come, like used
words, to mean so little, that it may be well to explain exactly,
even pedantically, what the word 'free' means in this context. It
means here that no right or privilege is asked in return. The giver
is not asking you to admit her to the priesthood of the Church of
England; or to the Stock Exchange; or to the Diplomatic Service.
The giver has no wish to be 'English' on the same terms that you
yourself are 'English'. The giver does not claim in return for the
gift admission to any profession; any honour, title, or medal; any
professorship or lectureship; any seat upon any society, committee
or board. The gift is free from all such conditions because the one
right of paramount importance to all human beings is already won.
You cannot take away her right to earn a living. Now then for the
first time in English history an educated man's daughter can give
her brother one guinea of her own making at his request for the
purpose specified above without asking for anything in return. It
is a free gift, given without fear, without flattery, and without
conditions. That, Sir, is so momentous an occasion in the history
of civilization that some celebration seems called for. But let us
have done with the old ceremonies&mdash;the Lord Mayor, with
turtles and sheriffs in attendance, tapping nine times with his
mace upon a stone while the Archbishop of Canterbury in full
canonicals invokes a blessing. Let us invent a new ceremony for
this new occasion. What more fitting than to destroy an old word, a
vicious and corrupt word that has done much harm in its day and is
now obsolete? The word 'feminist' is the word indicated. That word,
according to the dictionary, means 'one who champions the rights of
women'. Since the only right, the right to earn a living, has been
won, the word no longer has a meaning. And a word without a meaning
is a dead word, a corrupt word. Let us therefore celebrate this
occasion by cremating the corpse. Let us write that word in large
black letters on a sheet of foolscap; then solemnly apply a match
to the paper. Look, how it burns! What a light dances over the
world! Now let us bray the ashes in a mortar with a goose-feather
pen, and declare in unison singing together that anyone who uses
that word in future is a
ring-the-bell-and-run-away-man,<sup><a href="#311">11</a></sup> a
mischief maker, a groper among old bones, the proof of whose
defilement is written in a smudge of dirty water upon his face. The
smoke has died down; the word is destroyed. Observe, Sir, what has
happened as the result of our celebration. The word 'feminist' is
destroyed; the air is cleared; and in that clearer air what do we
see? Men and women working together for the same cause. The cloud
has lifted from the past too. What were they working for in the
nineteenth century&mdash;those queer dead women in their poke
bonnets and shawls? The very same cause for which we are working
now. 'Our claim was no claim of women's rights only;'&mdash;it is
Josephine Butler who speaks&mdash;'it was larger and deeper; it was
a claim for the rights of all&mdash;all men and women&mdash;to the
respect in their persons of the great principles of Justice and
Equality and Liberty.' The words are the same as yours; the claim
is the same as yours. The daughters of educated men who were
called, to their resentment, 'feminists' were in fact the advance
guard of your own movement. They were fighting the same enemy that
you are fighting and for the same reasons. They were fighting the
tyranny of the patriarchal state as you are fighting the tyranny of
the Fascist state. Thus we are merely carrying on the same fight
that our mothers and grandmothers fought; their words prove it;
your words prove it. But now with your letter before us we have
your assurance that you are fighting with us, not against us. That
fact is so inspiring that another celebration seems called for.
What could be more fitting than to write more dead words, more
corrupt words, upon more sheets of paper and burn them&mdash;the
words, Tyrant, Dictator, for example? But, alas, those words are
not yet obsolete. We can still shake out eggs from newspapers;
still smell a peculiar and unmistakable odour in the region of
Whitehall and Westminster. And abroad the monster has come more
openly to the surface. There is no mistaking him there. He has
widened his scope. He is interfering now with your liberty; he is
dictating how you shall live; he is making distinctions not merely
between the sexes, but between the races. You are feeling in your
own persons what your mothers felt when they were shut out, when
they were shut up, because they were women. Now you are being shut
out, you are being shut up, because you are Jews, because you are
democrats, because of race, because of religion. It is not a
photograph that you look upon any longer; there you go, trapesing
along in the procession yourselves. And that makes a difference.
The whole iniquity of dictatorship, whether in Oxford or Cambridge,
in Whitehall or Downing Street, against Jews or against women, in
England, or in Germany, in Italy or in Spain is now apparent to
you. But now we are fighting together. The daughters and sons of
educated men are fighting side by side. That fact is so inspiring,
even if no celebration is possible, that if this one guinea could
be multiplied a million times all those guineas should be at your
service without any other conditions than those that you have
imposed upon yourself. Take this one guinea then and use it to
assert 'the rights of all&mdash;all men and women&mdash;to the
respect in their persons of the great principles of Justice and
Equality and Liberty.' Put this penny candle in the window of your
new society, and may we live to see the day when in the blaze of
our common freedom the words tyrant and dictator shall be burnt to
ashes, because the words tyrant and dictator shall be obsolete.</p>

<p>That request then for a guinea answered, and the cheque signed,
only one further request of yours remains to be considered&mdash;it
is that we should fill up a form and become members of your
society. On the face of it that seems a simple request, easily
granted. For what can be simpler than to join the society to which
this guinea has just been contributed? On the face of it, how easy,
how simple; but in the depths, how difficult, how complicated . . .
What possible doubts, what possible hesitations can those dots
stand for? What reason or what emotion can make us hesitate to
become members of a society whose aims we approve, to whose funds
we have contributed? It may be neither reason nor emotion, but
something more profound and fundamental than either. It may be
difference. Different we are, as facts have proved, both in sex and
in education. And it is from that difference, as we have already
said, that our help can come, if help we can, to protect liberty,
to prevent war. But if we sign this form which implies a promise to
become active members of your society, it would seem that we must
lose that difference and therefore sacrifice that help. To explain
why this is so is not easy, even though the gift of a guinea has
made it possible (so we have boasted), to speak freely without fear
or flattery. Let us then keep the form unsigned on the table before
us while we discuss, so far as we are able, the reasons and the
emotions which make us hesitate to sign it. For those reasons and
emotions have their origin deep in the darkness of ancestral
memory; they have grown together in some confusion; it is very
difficult to untwist them in the light.</p>

<p>To begin with an elementary distinction: a society is a
conglomeration of people joined together for certain aims; while
you, who write in your own person with your own hand are single.
You the individual are a man whom we have reason to respect; a man
of the brotherhood, to which, as biography proves, many brothers
have belonged. Thus Anne Clough, describing her brother, says:
'Arthur is my best friend and adviser . . . Arthur is the comfort
and joy of my life; it is for him, and from him, that I am incited
to seek after all that is lovely and of good report.' To which
William Wordsworth, speaking of his sister but answering the other
as if one nightingale called to another in the forests of the past,
replies:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Blessing of my later years<br>
Was with me when a Boy:<br>
She gave me eyes, she gave me ears;<br>
And humble cares, and delicate fears;<br>
A heart, the fountain of sweet tears;<br>
And love, and thought, and joy.<sup><a href="#312">12</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Such was, such perhaps still is, the relationship of many
brothers and sisters in private, as individuals. They respect each
other and help each other and have aims in common. Why then, if
such can be their private relationship, as biography and poetry
prove, should their public relationship, as law and history prove,
be so very different? And here, since you are a lawyer, with a
lawyer's memory, it is not necessary to remind you of certain
decrees of English law from its first records to the year 1919 by
way of proving that the public, the society relationship of brother
and sister has been very different from the private. The very word
'society' sets tolling in memory the dismal bells of a harsh music:
shall not, shall not, shall not. You shall not learn; you shall not
earn; you shall not own; you shall not&mdash;such was the society
relationship of brother to sister for many centuries. And though it
is possible, and to the optimistic credible, that in time a new
society may ring a carillon of splendid harmony, and your letter
heralds it, that day is far distant. Inevitably we ask ourselves,
is there not something in the conglomeration of people into
societies that releases what is most selfish and violent, least
rational and humane in the individuals themselves? Inevitably we
look upon society, so kind to you, so harsh to us, as an
ill-fitting form that distorts the truth; deforms the mind; fetters
the will. Inevitably we look upon societies as conspiracies that
sink the private brother, whom many of us have reason to respect,
and inflate in his stead a monstrous male, loud of voice, hard of
fist, childishly intent upon scoring the floor of the earth with
chalk marks, within whose mystic boundaries human beings are
penned, rigidly, separately, artificially; where, daubed red and
gold, decorated like a savage with feathers he goes through mystic
rites and enjoys the dubious pleasures of power and dominion while
we, 'his' women, are locked in the private house without share in
the many societies of which his society is composed. For such
reasons compact as they are of many memories and emotions&mdash;for
who shall analyse the complexity of a mind that holds so deep a
reservoir of time past within it?&mdash;it seems both wrong for us
rationally and impossible for us emotionally to fill up your form
and join your society. For by so doing we should merge our identity
in yours; follow and repeat and score still deeper the old worn
ruts in which society, like a gramophone whose needle has stuck, is
grinding out with intolerable unanimity 'Three hundred millions
spent upon arms.' We should not give effect to a view which our own
experience of 'society' should have helped us to envisage. Thus,
Sir, while we respect you as a private person and prove it by
giving you a guinea to spend as you choose, we believe that we can
help you most effectively by refusing to join your society; by
working for our common ends&mdash;justice and equality and liberty
for all men and women&mdash;outside your society, not within.</p>

<p>But this, you will say, if it means anything, can only mean that
you, the daughters of educated men, who have promised us your
positive help, refuse to join our society in order that you may
make another of your own. And what sort of society do you propose
to found outside ours, but in cooperation with it, so that we may
both work together for our common ends? That is a question which
you have every right to ask, and which we must try to answer in
order to justify our refusal to sign the form you send. Let us then
draw rapidly in outline the kind of society which the daughters of
educated men might found and join outside your society but in
cooperation with its ends. In the first place, this new society,
you will be relieved to learn, would have no honorary treasurer,
for it would need no funds. It would have no office, no committee,
no secretary; it would call no meetings; it would hold no
conferences. If name it must have, it could be called the Outsiders
Society. That is not a resonant name, but it has the advantage that
it squares with facts&mdash;the facts of history, of law, of
biography; even, it may be, with the still hidden facts of our
still unknown psychology. It would consist of educated men's
daughters working in their own class&mdash;how indeed can they work
in any other?<sup><a href="#313">13</a></sup>&mdash;and by their
own methods for liberty, equality and peace. Their first duty, to
which they would bind themselves not by oath, for oaths and
ceremonies have no part in a society which must be anonymous and
elastic before everything would be not to fight with arms. This is
easy for them to observe, for in fact, as the papers inform us,
'the Army Council have no intention of opening recruiting for any
women's corps.'<sup><a href="#314">14</a></sup> The country ensures
it. Next they would refuse in the event of war to make munitions or
nurse the wounded. Since in the last war both these activities were
mainly discharged by the daughters of working men, the pressure
upon them here too would be slight, though probably disagreeable.
On the other hand the next duty to which they would pledge
themselves is one of considerable difficulty, and calls not only
for courage and initiative, but for the special knowledge of the
educated man's daughter. It is, briefly, not to incite their
brothers to fight, or to dissuade them, but to maintain an attitude
of complete indifference. But the attitude expressed by the word
'indifference' is so complex and of such importance that it needs
even here further definition. Indifference in the first place must
be given a firm footing upon fact. As it is a fact that she cannot
understand what instinct compels him, what glory, what interest,
what manly satisfaction fighting provides for him&mdash;'without
war there would be no outlet for the manly qualities which fighting
develops'&mdash;as fighting thus is a sex characteristic which she
cannot share, the counterpart some claim of the maternal instinct
which he cannot share, so is it an instinct which she cannot judge.
The outsider therefore must leave him free to deal with this
instinct by himself, because liberty of opinion must be respected,
especially when it is based upon an instinct which is as foreign to
her as centuries of tradition and education can make
it.<sup><a href="#315">15</a></sup> This is a fundamental and
instinctive distinction upon which indifference may be based. But
the outsider will make it her duty not merely to base her
indifference upon instinct, but upon reason. When he says, as
history proves that he has said, and may say again, 'I am fighting
to protect our country' and thus seeks to rouse her patriotic
emotion, she will ask herself, 'What does "our country" mean to me
an outsider?' To decide this she will analyse the meaning of
patriotism in her own case. She will inform herself of the position
of her sex and her class in the past. She will inform herself of
the amount of land, wealth and property in the possession of her
own sex and class in the present&mdash;how much of 'England' in
fact belongs to her. From the same sources she will inform herself
of the legal protection which the law has given her in the past and
now gives her. And if he adds that he is fighting to protect her
body, she will reflect upon the degree of physical protection that
she now enjoys when the words 'Air Raid Precaution' are written on
blank walls. And if he says that he is fighting to protect England
from foreign rule, she will reflect that for her there are no
'foreigners', since by law she becomes a foreigner if she marries a
foreigner. And she will do her best to make this a fact, not by
forced fraternity, but by human sympathy. All these facts will
convince her reason (to put it in a nutshell) that her sex and
class has very little to thank England for in the past; not much to
thank England for in the present; while the security of her person
in the future is highly dubious. But probably she will have
imbibed, even from the governess, some romantic notion that
Englishmen, those fathers and grandfathers whom she sees marching
in the picture of history, are 'superior' to the men of other
countries. This she will consider it her duty to check by comparing
French historians with English; German with French; the testimony
of the ruled&mdash;the Indians or the Irish, say&mdash;with the
claims made by their rulers. Still some 'patriotic' emotion, some
ingrained belief in the intellectual superiority of her own country
over other countries may remain. Then she will compare English
painting with French painting; English music with German music;
English literature with Greek literature, for translations abound.
When all these comparisons have been faithfully made by the use of
reason, the outsider will find herself in possession of very good
reasons for her indifference. She will find that she has no good
reason to ask her brother to fight on her behalf to protect 'our'
country. '"Our country,"' she will say, 'throughout the greater
part of its history has treated me as a slave; it has denied me
education or any share in its possessions. "Our" country still
ceases to be mine if I marry a foreigner. "Our" country denies me
the means of protecting myself, forces me to pay others a very
large sum annually to protect me, and is so little able, even so,
to protect me that Air Raid precautions are written on the wall.
Therefore if you insist upon fighting to protect me, or "our"
country, let it be understood, soberly and rationally between us,
that you are fighting to gratify a sex instinct which I cannot
share; to procure benefits which I have not shared and probably
will not share; but not to gratify my instincts, or to protect
either myself or my country. For,' the outsider will say, 'in fact,
as a woman, I have no country. As a woman I want no country. As a
woman my country is the whole world.' And if, when reason has said
its say, still some obstinate emotion remains, some love of England
dropped into a child's ears by the cawing of rooks in an elm tree,
by the splash of waves on a beach, or by English voices murmuring
nursery rhymes, this drop of pure, if irrational, emotion she will
make serve her to give to England first what she desires of peace
and freedom for the whole world.</p>

<p>Such then will be the nature of her 'indifference' and from this
indifference certain actions must follow. She will bind herself to
take no share in patriotic demonstrations; to assent to no form of
national self-praise; to make no part of any claque or audience
that encourages war; to absent herself from military displays,
tournaments, tattoos, prize-givings and all such ceremonies as
encourage the desire to impose 'our' civilization or 'our' dominion
upon other people. The psychology of private life, moreover,
warrants the belief that this use of indifference by the daughters
of educated men would help materially to prevent war. For
psychology would seem to show that it is far harder for human
beings to take action when other people are indifferent and allow
them complete freedom of action, than when their actions are made
the centre of excited emotion. The small boy struts and trumpets
outside the window: implore him to stop; he goes on; say nothing;
he stops. That the daughters of educated men then should give their
brothers neither the white feather of cowardice nor the red feather
of courage, but no feather at all; that they should shut the bright
eyes that rain influence, or let those eyes look elsewhere when war
is discussed&mdash;that is the duty to which outsiders will train
themselves in peace before the threat of death inevitably makes
reason powerless.</p>

<p>Such then are some of the methods by which the society, the
anonymous and secret Society of Outsiders would help you, Sir, to
prevent war and to ensure freedom. Whatever value you may attach to
them you will agree that they are duties which your own sex would
find it more difficult to carry out than ours; and duties moreover
which are specially appropriate to the daughters of educated men.
For they would need some acquaintance with the psychology of
educated men, and the minds of educated men are more highly trained
and their words subtler than those of working men.<sup><a href=
"#316">16</a></sup> There are other duties, of course&mdash;many
have already been outlined in the letters to the other honorary
treasurers. But at the risk of some repetition let us roughly and
rapidly repeat them, so that they may form a basis for a society of
outsiders to take its stand upon. First, they would bind themselves
to earn their own livings. The importance of this as a method of
ending war is obvious; sufficient stress has already been laid upon
the superior cogency of an opinion based upon economic independence
over an opinion based upon no income at all or upon a spiritual
right to an income to make further proof unnecessary. It follows
that an outsider must make it her business to press for a living
wage in all the professions now open to her sex; further that she
must create new professions in which she can earn the right to an
independent opinion. Therefore she must bind herself to press for a
money wage for the unpaid worker in her own class&mdash;the
daughters and sisters of educated men who, as biographies have
shown us, are now paid on the truck system, with food, lodging and
a pittance of &pound;40 a year. But above all she must press for a
wage to be paid by the State legally to the mothers of educated
men. The importance of this to our common fight is immeasurable;
for it is the most effective way in which we can ensure that the
large and very honourable class of married women shall have a mind
and a will of their own, with which, if his mind and will are good
in her eyes, to support her husband, if bad to resist him, in any
case to cease to be 'his woman' and to be her self. You will agree,
Sir, without any aspersion upon the lady who bears your name, that
to depend upon her for your income would effect a most subtle and
undesirable change in your psychology. Apart from that, this
measure is of such importance directly to yourselves, in your own
fight for liberty and equality and peace, that if any condition
were to be attached to the guinea it would be this: that you should
provide a wage to be paid by the State to those whose profession is
marriage and motherhood. Consider, even at the risk of a
digression, what effect this would have upon the birth-rate, in the
very class where the birth-rate is falling, in the very class where
births are desirable&mdash;the educated class. Just as the increase
in the pay of soldiers has resulted, the papers say, in additional
recruits to the force of arm-bearers, so the same inducement would
serve to recruit the child-bearing force, which we can hardly deny
to be as necessary and as honourable, but which, because of its
poverty, and its hardships, is now failing to attract recruits.
That method might succeed where the one in use at
present&mdash;abuse and ridicule&mdash;has failed. But the point
which, at the risk of further digression, the outsiders would press
upon you is one that vitally concerns your own lives as educated
men and the honour and vigour of your professions. For if your wife
were paid for her work, the work of bearing and bringing up
children, a real wage, a money wage, so that it became an
attractive profession instead of being as it is now an unpaid
profession, an unpensioned profession, and therefore a precarious
and dishonoured profession, your own slavery would be
lightened.<sup><a href="#317">17</a></sup> No longer need you go to
the office at nine-thirty and stay there till six. Work could be
equally distributed. Patients could be sent to the patientless.
Briefs to the briefless. Articles could be left unwritten. Culture
would thus be stimulated. You could see the fruit trees flower in
spring. You could share the prime of life with your children. And
after that prime was over no longer need you be thrown from the
machine on to the scrap heap without any life left or interests
surviving to parade the environs of Bath or Cheltenham in the care
of some unfortunate slave. No longer would you be the Saturday
caller, the albatross on the neck of society, the sympathy addict,
the deflated work slave calling for replenishment; or, as Herr
Hitler puts it, the hero requiring recreation, or, as Signor
Mussolini puts it, the wounded warrior requiring female dependants
to bandage his wounds.<sup><a href="#318">18</a></sup> If the State
paid your wife a living wage for her work which, sacred though it
is, can scarcely be called more sacred than that of the clergyman,
yet as his work is paid without derogation so may hers be&mdash;if
this step which is even more essential to your freedom than to hers
were taken the old mill in which the professional man now grinds
out his round, often so wearily, with so little pleasure to himself
or profit to his profession, would be broken; the opportunity of
freedom would be yours; the most degrading of all servitudes, the
intellectual servitude, would be ended; the half-man might become
whole. But since three hundred millions or so have to be spent upon
the arm-bearers, such expenditure is obviously, to use a convenient
word supplied by the politicians, 'impracticable' and it is time to
return to more feasible projects.</p>

<p>The outsiders then would bind themselves not only to earn their
own livings, but to earn them so expertly that their refusal to
earn them would be a matter of concern to the work master. They
would bind themselves to obtain full knowledge of professional
practices, and to reveal any instance of tyranny or abuse in their
professions. And they would bind themselves not to continue to make
money in any profession, but to cease all competition and to
practise their profession experimentally, in the interests of
research and for love of the work itself, when they had earned
enough to live upon. Also they would bind themselves to remain
outside any profession hostile to freedom, such as the making or
the improvement of the weapons of war. And they would bind
themselves to refuse to take office or honour from any society
which, while professing to respect liberty, restricts it, like the
universities of Oxford and Cambridge. And they would consider it
their duty to investigate the claims of all public societies to
which, like the Church and the universities, they are forced to
contribute as taxpayers as carefully and fearlessly as they would
investigate the claims of private societies to which they
contribute voluntarily. They would make it their business to
scrutinize the endowments of the schools and universities and the
objects upon which that money is spent. As with the educational, so
with the religious profession. By reading the New Testament in the
first place and next those divines and historians whose works are
all easily accessible to the daughters of educated men, they would
make it their business to have some knowledge of the Christian
religion and its history. Further they would inform themselves of
the practice of that religion by attending Church services, by
analysing the spiritual and intellectual value of sermons; by
criticizing the opinions of men whose profession is religion as
freely as they would criticize the opinions of any other body of
men. Thus they would be creative in their activities, not merely
critical. By criticizing education they would help to create a
civilized society which protects culture and intellectual liberty.
By criticizing religion they would attempt to free the religious
spirit from its present servitude and would help, if need be, to
create a new religion based it might well be upon the New
Testament, but, it might well be, very different from the religion
now erected upon that basis. And in all this, and in much more than
we have time to particularize, they would be helped, you will
agree, by their position as outsiders, that freedom from unreal
loyalties, that freedom from interested motives which are at
present assured them by the State.</p>

<p>It would be easy to define in greater number and more exactly
the duties of those who belong to the Society of Outsiders, but not
profitable. Elasticity is essential: and some degree of secrecy, as
will be shown later, is at present even more essential. But the
description thus loosely and imperfectly given is enough to show
you, Sir, that the Society of Outsiders has the same ends as your
society&mdash;freedom, equality, peace; but that it seeks to
achieve them by the means that a different sex, a different
tradition, a different education, and the different values which
result from those differences have placed within our reach. Broadly
speaking, the main distinction between us who are outside society
and you who are inside society must be that whereas you will make
use of the means provided by your position&mdash;leagues,
conferences, campaigns, great names, and all such public measures
as your wealth and political influence place within your
reach&mdash;we, remaining outside, will experiment not with public
means in public but with private means in private. Those
experiments will not be merely critical but creative. To take two
obvious instances:&mdash;the outsiders will dispense with pageantry
not from any puritanical dislike of beauty. On the contrary, it
will be one of their aims to increase private beauty; the beauty of
spring, summer, autumn; the beauty of flowers, silks, clothes; the
beauty which brims not only every field and wood but every barrow
in Oxford Street; the scattered beauty which needs only to be
combined by artists in order to become visible to all. But they
will dispense with the dictated, regimented, official pageantry, in
which only one sex takes an active part&mdash;those ceremonies, for
example, which depend upon the deaths of kings, or their
coronations to inspire them. Again, they will dispense with
personal distinctions&mdash;medals, ribbons, badges, hoods,
gowns&mdash;not from any dislike of personal adornment, but because
of the obvious effect of such distinctions to constrict, to
stereotype and to destroy. Here, as so often, the example of the
Fascist States is at hand to instruct us&mdash;for if we have no
example of what we wish to be, we have, what is perhaps equally
valuable, a daily and illuminating example of what we do not wish
to be. With the example then, that they give us of the power of
medals, symbols, orders and even, it would seem, of decorated
ink-pots<sup><a href="#319">19</a></sup> to hypnotize the human
mind it must be our aim not to submit ourselves to such hypnotism.
We must extinguish the coarse glare of advertisement and publicity,
not merely because the limelight is apt to be held in incompetent
hands, but because of the psychological effect of such illumination
upon those who receive it. Consider next time you drive along a
country road the attitude of a rabbit caught in the glare of a
head-lamp&mdash;its glazed eyes, its rigid paws. Is there not good
reason to think without going outside our own country, that the
'attitudes', the false and unreal positions taken by the human form
in England as well as in Germany, are due to the limelight which
paralyses the free action of the human faculties and inhibits the
human power to change and create new wholes much as a strong
head-lamp paralyses the little creatures who run out of the
darkness into its beams? It is a guess; guessing is dangerous; yet
we have some reason to guide us in the guess that ease and freedom,
the power to change and the power to grow, can only be preserved by
obscurity; and that if we wish to help the human mind to create,
and to prevent it from scoring the same rut repeatedly, we must do
what we can to shroud it in darkness.</p>

<p>But enough of guessing. To return to facts&mdash;what chance is
there, you may ask, that such a Society of Outsiders without
office, meetings, leaders or any hierarchy, without so much as a
form to be filled up, or a secretary to be paid, can be brought
into existence, let alone work to any purpose? Indeed it would have
been waste of time to write even so rough a definition of the
Outsiders' Society were it merely a bubble of words, a covert form
of sex or class glorification, serving, as so many such expressions
do, to relieve the writer's emotion, lay the blame elsewhere, and
then burst. Happily there is a model in being, a model from which
the above sketch has been taken, furtively it is true, for the
model, far from sitting still to be painted, dodges and disappears.
That model then, the evidence that such a body, whether named or
unnamed, exists and works is provided not yet by history or
biography, for the outsiders have only had a positive existence for
twenty years&mdash;that is since the professions were opened to the
daughters of educated men. But evidence of their existence is
provided by history and biography in the raw&mdash;by the
newspapers that is, sometimes openly in the lines, sometimes
covertly between them. There, anyone who wishes to verify the
existence of such a body, can find innumerable proofs. Many, it is
obvious, are of dubious value. For example, the fact that an
immense amount of work is done by the daughters of educated men
without pay or for very little pay need not be taken as a proof
that they are experimenting of their own free will in the
psychological value of poverty. Nor need the fact that many
daughters of educated men do not 'eat properly'<sup><a href=
"#320">20</a></sup> serve as a proof that they are experimenting in
the physical value of undernourishment. Nor need the fact that a
very small proportion of women compared with men accept honours be
held to prove that they are experimenting in the virtues of
obscurity. Many such experiments are forced experiments and
therefore of no positive value. But others of a much more positive
kind are coming daily to the surface of the Press. Let us examine
three only, in order that we may prove our statement that the
Society of Outsiders is in being. The first is straightforward
enough.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Speaking at a bazaar last week at the Plumstead Common Baptist
Church the Mayoress (of Woolwich) said: '. . . I myself would not
even do as much as darn a sock to help in a war.' These remarks are
resented by the majority of the Woolwich public, who hold that the
Mayoress was, to say the least, rather tactless. Some 12,000
Woolwich electors are employed in Woolwich Arsenal on armament
making.<sup><a href="#321">21</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>There is no need to comment upon the tactlessness of such a
statement made publicly, in such circumstances; but the courage can
scarcely fail to command our admiration, and the value of the
experiment, from a practical point of view, should other mayoresses
in other towns and other countries where the electors are employed
in armament-making follow suit may well be immeasurable. At any
rate, we shall agree that the Mayoress of Woolwich, Mrs Kathleen
Rance, has made a courageous and effective experiment in the
prevention of war by not knitting socks. For a second proof that
the outsiders are at work let us choose another example from the
daily paper, one that is less obvious, but still you will agree an
outsider's experiment, a very original experiment, and one that may
be of great value to the cause of peace.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Speaking of the work of the great voluntary associations for the
playing of certain games, Miss Clarke [Miss E. R. Clarke of the
Board of Education] referred to the women's organizations for
hockey, lacrosse, netball, and cricket, and pointed out that under
the rules there could be no cup or award of any kind to a
successful team. The 'gates' for their matches might be a little
smaller than for the men's games, but their players played the game
for the love of it, and they seemed to be proving that cups and
awards are not necessary to stimulate interest for each year the
numbers of players steadily continued to increase.<sup><a href=
"322">22</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>That, you will agree, is an extraordinarily interesting
experiment, one that may well bring about a psychological change of
great value in human nature, and a change that may be of real help
in preventing war. It is further of interest because it is an
experiment that outsiders, owing to their comparative freedom from
certain inhibitions and persuasions, can carry out much more easily
than those who are necessarily exposed to such influences inside.
That statement is corroborated in a very interesting way by the
following quotation:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Official football circles here [Wellingborough, Northants]
regard with anxiety the growing popularity of girl's football. A
secret meeting of the Northants Football Association's consultative
committee was held here last night to discuss the playing of a
girl's match on the Peterborough ground. Members of the Committee
are reticent . . . One member, however, said today: 'The Northants
Football Association is to forbid women's football. This popularity
of girls' football comes when many men's clubs in the country are
in a parlous state through lack of support. Another serious aspect
is the possibility of grave injury to women players.'<sup><a href=
"#323">23</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>There we have proof positive of those inhibitions and
persuasions which make it harder for your sex to experiment freely
in altering current values than for ours; and without spending time
upon the delicacies of psychological analysis even a hasty glance
at the reasons given by this Association for its decision will
throw a valuable light upon the reasons which lead other and even
more important associations to come to their decisions. But to
return to the outsiders' experiments. For our third example let us
choose what we may call an experiment in passivity.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A remarkable change in the attitude of young women to the Church
was discussed by Canon F. A. Barry, vicar of St Mary the Virgin
(the University Church), at Oxford last night . . . The task before
the Church, he said, was nothing less than to make civilization
moral, and this was a great cooperative task which demanded all
that Christians could bring to it. It simply could not be carried
through by men alone. For a century, or a couple of centuries,
women had predominated in the congregations in roughly the ratio of
75 per cent to 25 per cent. The whole situation was now changing,
and what the keen observer would notice in almost any church in
England was the paucity of young women . . . Among the student
population the young women were, on the whole, farther away from
the Church of England and the Christian faith than the young
men.<sup><a href="#324">24</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>That again is an experiment of very great interest. It is, as we
have said, a passive experiment. For while the first example was an
outspoken refusal to knit socks in order to discourage war, and the
second was an attempt to prove whether cups and awards are
necessary to stimulate interest in games, the third is an attempt
to discover what happens if the daughters of educated men absent
themselves from church. Without being in itself more valuable than
the others, it is of more practical interest because it is
obviously the kind of experiment that great numbers of outsiders
can practise with very little difficulty or danger. To absent
yourself&mdash;that is easier than to speak aloud at a bazaar, or
to draw up rules of an original kind for playing games. Therefore
it is worth watching very carefully to see what effect the
experiment of absenting oneself has had&mdash;if any. The results
are positive and they are encouraging. There can be no doubt that
the Church is becoming concerned about the attitude to the Church
of educated men's daughters at the universities. The report of the
Archbishops' Commission on the Ministry of Women is there to prove
it. This document, which costs only one shilling and should be in
the hands of all educated men's daughters, points out that 'one
outstanding difference between men's colleges and women's colleges
is the absence in the latter of a chaplain.' It reflects that 'It
is natural that in this period of their lives they [the students]
exercise to the full their critical faculties.' It deplores the
fact that 'Very few women coming to the universities can now afford
to offer continuous voluntary service either in social or in
directly religious work.' And it concludes that 'There are many
special spheres in which such services are particularly needed, and
the time has clearly come when the functions and position of women
within the Church require further determination.'<sup><a href=
"#325">25</a></sup> Whether this concern is due to the empty
churches at Oxford, or whether the voices of the 'older
schoolgirls' at Isleworth expressing 'very grave dissatisfaction at
the way in which organized religion was carried on'<sup><a href=
"#326">26</a></sup> have somehow penetrated to those august spheres
where their sex is not supposed to speak, or whether our
incorrigibly idealistic sex is at last beginning to take to heart
Bishop Gore's warning, 'Men do not value ministrations which are
gratuitous,'<sup><a href="#327">27</a></sup> and to express the
opinion that a salary of &pound;150 a year&mdash;the highest that
the Church allows her daughters as deaconesses&mdash;is not
enough&mdash;whatever the reason, considerable uneasiness at the
attitude of educated men's daughters is apparent; and this
experiment in passivity, whatever our belief in the value of the
Church of England as a spiritual agency, is highly encouraging to
us as outsiders. For it seems to show that to be passive is to be
active; those also serve who remain outside. By making their
absence felt their presence becomes desirable. What light this
throws upon the power of outsiders to abolish or modify other
institutions of which they disapprove, whether public dinners,
public speeches, Lord Mayors' banquets and other obsolete
ceremonies are pervious to indifference and will yield to its
pressure, are questions, frivolous questions, that may well amuse
our leisure and stimulate our curiosity. But that is not now the
object before us. We have tried to prove to you, Sir, by giving
three different examples of three different kinds of experiment
that the Society of Outsiders is in being and at work. When you
consider that these examples have all come to the surface of the
newspaper you will agree that they represent a far greater number
of private and submerged experiments of which there is no public
proof. Also you will agree that they substantiate the model of the
society given above, and prove that it was no visionary sketch
drawn at random but based upon a real body working by different
means for the same ends that you have set before us in your own
society. Keen observers, like Canon Barry, could, if they liked,
discover many more proofs that experiments are being made not only
in the empty churches of Oxford. Mr Wells even might be led to
believe if he put his ear to the ground that a movement is going
forward, not altogether imperceptibly, among educated men's
daughters against the Nazi and the Fascist. But it is essential
that the movement should escape the notice even of keen observers
and of famous novelists.</p>

<p>Secrecy is essential. We must still hide what we are doing and
thinking even though what we are doing and thinking is for our
common cause. The necessity for this, in certain circumstances, is
not hard to discover. When salaries are low, as Whitaker proves
that they are, and jobs are hard to get and keep, as everybody
knows them to be, it is, 'to say the least, rather tactless,' as
the newspaper puts it, to criticize your master. Still, in country
districts, as you yourself may be aware, farm labourers will not
vote Labour. Economically, the educated man's daughter is much on a
level with the farm labourer. But it is scarcely necessary for us
to waste time in searching out what reason it is that inspires both
his and her secrecy. Fear is a powerful reason; those who are
economically dependent have strong reasons for fear. We need
explore no further. But here you may remind us of a certain guinea,
and draw our attention to the proud boast that our gift, small
though it was, had made it possible not merely to burn a certain
corrupt word, but to speak freely without fear or flattery. The
boast it seems had an element of brag in it. Some fear, some
ancestral memory prophesying war, still remains, it seems. There
are still subjects that educated people, when they are of different
sexes, even though financially independent, veil, or hint at in
guarded terms and then pass on. You may have observed it in real
life; you may have detected it in biography. Even when they meet
privately and talk, as we have boasted, about 'politics and people,
war and peace, barbarism and civilization', yet they evade and
conceal. But it is so important to accustom ourselves to the duties
of free speech, for without private there can be no public freedom,
that we must try to uncover this fear and to face it. What then can
be the nature of the fear that still makes concealment necessary
between educated people and reduces our boasted freedom to a farce?
. . . Again there are three dots; again they represent a
gulf&mdash;of silence this time, of silence inspired by fear. And
since we lack both the courage to explain it and the skill, let us
lower the veil of St Paul between us, in other words take shelter
behind an interpreter. Happily we have one at hand whose
credentials are above suspicion. It is none other than the pamphlet
from which quotation has already been made, the report of the
Archbishops' Commission on the Ministry of Women&mdash;a document
of the highest interest for many reasons. For not only does it
throw light of a searching and scientific nature upon this fear,
but it gives us an opportunity to consider that profession which,
since it is the highest of all may be taken as the type of all, the
profession of religion, about which, purposely, very little has yet
been said. And since it is the type of all it may throw light upon
the other professions about which something has been said. You will
pardon us therefore if we pause here to examine this report in some
detail.</p>

<p>The Commission was appointed by the Archbishops of Canterbury
and York 'in order to examine any theological or other relevant
principles which have governed or ought to govern the Church in the
development of the Ministry of Women.'<sup><a href=
"#328">28</a></sup> Now the profession of religion, for our
purposes the Church of England, though it seems on the surface to
resemble the others in certain respects&mdash;it enjoys, Whitaker
says, a large income, owns much property, and has a hierarchy of
officials drawing salaries and taking precedence one of the
other&mdash;yet ranks above all the professions. The Archbishop of
Canterbury precedes the Lord High Chancellor; the Archbishop of
York precedes the Prime Minister. And it is the highest of all the
professions because it is the profession of religion. But what, we
may ask, is 'religion'? What the Christian religion is has been
laid down once and for all by the founder of that religion in words
that can be read by all in a translation of singular beauty; and
whether or not we accept the interpretation that has been put on
them we cannot deny them to be words of the most profound meaning.
It can thus safely be said that whereas few people know what
medicine is, or what law is, everyone who owns a copy of the New
Testament knows what religion meant in the mind of its founder.
Therefore, when in the year 1935 the daughters of educated men said
that they wished to have the profession of religion opened to them,
the priests of that profession, who correspond roughly to the
doctors and barristers in the other professions, were forced not
merely to consult some statute or charter which reserves the right
to practise that profession professionally to the male sex; they
were forced to consult the New Testament. They did so; and the
result, as the Commissioners point out, was that they found that
'the Gospels show us that our Lord regarded men and women alike as
members of the same spiritual kingdom, as children of God's family,
and as possessors of the same spiritual capacities . . .' In proof
of this they quote: 'There is neither male nor female: for ye are
all one in Christ Jesus' (Gal. iii, 28). It would seem then that
the founder of Christianity believed that neither training nor sex
was needed for this profession. He chose his disciples from the
working class from which he sprang himself. The prime qualification
was some rare gift which in those early days was bestowed
capriciously upon carpenters and fishermen, and upon women also. As
the Commission points out there can be no doubt that in those early
days there were prophetesses&mdash;women upon whom the divine gift
had descended. Also they were allowed to preach. St Paul, for
example, lays it down that women, when praying in public, should be
veiled. 'The implication is that if veiled a woman might prophesy
[i.e. preach] and lead in prayer.' How then can they be excluded
from the priesthood since they were thought fit by the founder of
the religion and by one of his apostles to preach? That was the
question, and the Commission solved it by appealing not to the mind
of the founder, but to the mind of the Church. That, of course,
involved a distinction. For the mind of the Church had to be
interpreted by another mind, and that mind was St Paul's mind; and
St Paul, in interpreting that mind, changed his mind. For after
summoning from the depths of the past certain venerable if obscure
figures&mdash;Lydia and Chloe, Euodia and Syntyche, Tryphoena and
Tryphosa and Persis, debating their status, and deciding what was
the difference between a prophetess and presbyteress, what the
standing of a deaconess in the pre-Nicene Church and what in the
post-Nicene Church, the Commissioners once more have recourse to St
Paul, and say: 'In any case it is clear that the author of the
Pastoral Epistles, be he St Paul or another, regarded woman as
being debarred on the ground of her sex from the position of an
official "teacher" in the Church, or from any office involving the
exercise of a governmental authority over a man' (1 Tim. ii, 12).
That, it may frankly be said, is not so satisfactory as it might
be; for we cannot altogether reconcile the ruling of St Paul, or
another, with the ruling of Christ himself who 'regarded men and
women alike as members of the same spiritual kingdom . . . and as
possessors of the same spiritual capacities.' But it is futile to
quibble over the meaning of the words, when we are so soon in the
presence of facts. Whatever Christ meant, or St Paul meant, the
fact was that in the fourth or fifth century the profession of
religion had become so highly organized that 'the deacon (unlike
the deaconess) may, "after serving unto well-pleasing the ministry
committed unto him", aspire to be appointed eventually to higher
offices in the Church; whereas for the deaconess the Church prays
simply that God "would grant unto her the Holy Spirit . . . that
she may worthily accomplish the work committed to her."' In three
or four centuries, it appears, the prophet or prophetess whose
message was voluntary and untaught became extinct; and their places
were taken by the three orders of bishops, priests and deacons, who
are invariably men, and invariably, as Whitaker points out, paid
men, for when the Church became a profession its professors were
paid. Thus the profession of religion seems to have been originally
much what the profession of literature is now.<sup><a href=
"#329">29</a></sup> It was originally open to anyone who had
received the gift of prophecy. No training was needed; the
professional requirements were simple in the extreme&mdash;a voice
and a market-place, a pen and paper. Emily Bront&euml;, for
instance, who wrote</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>No coward soul is mine,<br>
No trembler in the world's storm-troubled sphere;<br>
I see Heaven's glories shine.<br>
And faith shines equal, arming me from fear.<br>
O God within my breast,<br>
Almighty, ever-present Deity!<br>
Life&mdash;that in me has rest,<br>
As I&mdash;undying Life&mdash;have power in Thee!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>though not worthy to be a priest in the Church of England, is
the spiritual descendant of some ancient prophetess, who prophesied
when prophecy was a voluntary and unpaid occupation. But when the
Church became a profession, required special knowledge of its
prophets and paid them for imparting it, one sex remained inside;
the other was excluded. 'The deacons rose in dignity&mdash;partly
no doubt from their close association with the bishops&mdash;and
become subordinate ministers of worship and of the sacraments; but
the deaconess shared only in the preliminary stages of this
evolution.' How elementary that evolution has been is proved by the
fact that in England in 1938 the salary of an archbishop is
&pound;15,000; the salary of a bishop is &pound;10,000 and the
salary of a dean is &pound;3,000. But the salary of a deaconess is
&pound;150; and as for the 'parish worker', who 'is called upon to
assist in almost every department of parish life', whose 'work is
exacting and often solitary . . .' she is paid from &pound;120 to
&pound;150 a year; nor is there anything to surprise us in the
statement that 'prayer needs to be the very centre of her
activities'. Thus we might even go further than the Commissioners
and say that the evolution of the deaconess is not merely
'elementary', it is positively stunted; for though she is ordained,
and 'ordination . . . conveys an indelible character, and involves
the obligation of lifelong service', she must remain outside the
Church; and rank beneath the humblest curate. Such is the decision
of the Church. For the Commission, having consulted the mind and
tradition of the Church, reported finally; 'While the Commission as
a whole would not give their positive assent to the view that a
woman is inherently incapable of receiving the grace of Order, and
consequently to admission to any of the three Orders, we believe
that the general mind of the Church is still in accord with the
continuous tradition of a male priesthood.'</p>

<p>By thus showing that the highest of all the professions has many
points of similarity with the other professions our interpreter,
you will admit, has thrown further light upon the soul or essence
of those professions. We must now ask him to help us, if he will,
to analyse the nature of that fear which still, as we have
admitted, makes it impossible for us to speak freely as free people
should. Here again he is of service. Though identical in many
respects, one very profound difference between the religious
profession and other professions has been noted above: the Church
being a spiritual profession has to give spiritual and not merely
historical reasons for its actions; it has to consult the mind, not
the law. Therefore when the daughters of educated men wished to be
admitted to the profession of the Church it seemed advisable to the
Commissioners to give psychological and not merely historical
reasons for their refusal to admit them. They therefore called in
Professor Grensted, D. D., the Nolloth Professor of the Philosophy
of the Christian Religion in the University of Oxford, and asked
him 'to summarize the relevant psychological and physiological
material', and to indicate 'the grounds for the opinions and
recommendations put forward by the Commission'. Now psychology is
not theology; and the psychology of the sexes, as the Professor
insisted, and 'its bearing upon human conduct, is still a matter
for specialists . . . and . . . its interpretation remains
controversial, in many respects obscure.' But he gave his evidence
for what it was worth, and it is evidence that throws so much light
upon the origin of the fear which we have admitted and deplored
that we can do no better than follow his words exactly.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It was represented [he said] in evidence before the Commission
that man has a natural precedence of woman. This view, in the sense
intended, cannot be supported psychologically. Psychologists fully
recognize the fact of male dominance, but this must not be confused
with male superiority, still less with any type of precedence which
could have a bearing upon questions as to the admissibility of one
sex rather than the other to Holy Orders.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The psychologist, therefore, can only throw light upon certain
facts. And this was the first fact that he investigated.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It is clearly a fact of the very greatest practical importance
that strong feeling is aroused by any suggestion that women should
be admitted to the status and functions of the threefold Order of
the Ministry. The evidence before the Commission went to show that
this feeling is predominantly hostile to such proposals . . . This
strength of feeling, conjoined with a wide variety of rational
explanations, is clear evidence of the presence of powerful and
widespread subconscious motive. In the absence of detailed
analytical material, of which there seems to be no record in this
particular connection, it nevertheless remains clear that infantile
fixation plays a predominant part in determining the strong emotion
with which this whole subject is commonly approached.</p>

<p>The exact nature of this fixation must necessarily differ with
different individuals, and suggestions which can be made as to its
origin can only be general in character. But whatever be the exact
value and interpretation of the material upon which theories of the
'Oedipus complex' and the 'castration complex' have been founded,
it is clear that the general acceptance of male dominance, and
still more of feminine inferiority, resting upon subconscious ideas
of woman as 'man manqu&eacute;', has its background in infantile
conceptions of this type. These commonly, and even usually, survive
in the adult, despite their irrationality, and betray their
presence, below the level of conscious thought, by the strength of
the emotions to which they give rise. It is strongly in support of
this view that the admission of women to Holy Orders, and
especially to the ministry of the sanctuary, is so commonly
regarded as something shameful. This sense of shame cannot be
regarded in any other light than as a non-rational sex-taboo.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Here we can take the Professor's word for it that he has sought,
and found, 'ample evidence of these unconscious forces', both in
Pagan religions and in the Old Testament, and so follow him to his
conclusion:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>At the same time it must not be forgotten that the Christian
conception of the priesthood rests not upon these subconscious
emotional factors, but upon the institution of Christ. It thus not
only fulfils but supersedes the priesthoods of paganism and the Old
Testament. So far as psychology is concerned there is no
theoretical reason why this Christian priesthood should not be
exercised by women as well as by men and in exactly the same sense.
The difficulties which the psychologist foresees are emotional and
practical only.<sup><a href="#330">30</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>With that conclusion we may leave him.</p>

<p>The Commissioners, you will agree, have performed the delicate
and difficult task that we asked them to undertake. They have acted
as interpreters between us. They have given us an admirable example
of a profession in its purest state; and shown us how a profession
bases itself upon mind and tradition. They have further explained
why it is that educated people when they are of different sexes do
not speak openly upon certain subjects. They have shown why the
outsiders, even when there is no question of financial dependence,
may still be afraid to speak freely or to experiment openly. And,
finally, in words of scientific precision, they have revealed to us
the nature of that fear. For as Professor Grensted gave his
evidence, we, the daughters of educated men, seemed to be watching
a surgeon at work&mdash;an impartial and scientific operator, who,
as he dissected the human mind by human means laid bare for all to
see what cause, what root lies at the bottom of our fear. It is an
egg. Its scientific name is 'infantile fixation'. We, being
unscientific, have named it wrongly. An egg we called it; a germ.
We smelt it in the atmosphere; we detected its presence in
Whitehall, in the universities, in the Church. Now undoubtedly the
Professor has defined it and described it so accurately that no
daughter of an educated man, however uneducated she may be, can
miscall it or misinterpret it in future. Listen to the description.
'Strong feeling is aroused by any suggestion that women be
admitted'&mdash;it matters not to which priesthood; the priesthood
of medicine or the priesthood of science or the priesthood of the
Church. Strong feeling, she can corroborate the Professor, is
undoubtedly shown should she ask to be admitted. 'This strength of
feeling is clear evidence of the presence of powerful and
subconscious motive.' She will take the Professor's word for that,
and even supply him with some motives that have escaped him. Let us
draw attention to two only. There is the money motive for excluding
her, to put it plainly. Are not salaries motives now, whatever they
may have been in the time of Christ? The archbishop has
&pound;15,000, the deaconess &pound;150; and the Church, so the
Commissioners say, is poor. To pay women more would be to pay men
less. Secondly, is there not a motive, a psychological motive, for
excluding her, hidden beneath what the Commissioners call a
'practical consideration'? 'At present a married priest', they tell
us, 'is able to fulfil the requirements of the ordination service
"to forsake and set aside all worldly cares and studies" largely
because his wife can undertake the care of the household and the
family, . . .'<sup><a href="#331">31</a></sup> To be able to set
aside all worldly cares and studies and lay them upon another
person is a motive, to some of great attractive force; for some
undoubtedly wish to withdraw and study, as theology with its
refinements, and scholarship with its subtleties, prove; to others,
it is true, the motive is a bad motive, a vicious motive, the cause
of that separation between the Church and the people; between
literature and the people; between the husband and the wife which
has had its part in putting the whole of our Commonwealth out of
gear. But whatever the powerful and subconscious motives may be
that lie behind the exclusion of women from the priesthoods, and
plainly we cannot count them, let alone dig to the roots of them
here, the educated man's daughter can testify from her own
experience that they 'commonly, and even usually, survive in the
adult and betray their presence, below the level of conscious
thought, by the strength of the emotions to which they give rise.'
And you will agree that to oppose strong emotion needs courage; and
that when courage fails, silence and evasion are likely to manifest
themselves.</p>

<p>But now that the interpreters have performed their task, it is
time for us to raise the veil of St Paul and to attempt, face to
face, a rough and clumsy analysis of that fear and of the anger
which causes that fear; for they may have some bearing upon the
question you put us, how we can help you to prevent war. Let us
suppose, then, that in the course of that bi-sexual private
conversation about politics and people, war and peace, barbarism
and civilization, some question has cropped up, about admitting,
shall we say, the daughters of educated men to the Church or the
Stock Exchange or the diplomatic service. The question is
adumbrated merely; but we on our side of the table become aware at
once of some 'strong emotion' on your side 'arising from some
motive below the level of conscious thought' by the ringing of an
alarm bell within us; a confused but tumultuous clamour: You shall
not, shall not, shall not . . . The physical symptoms are
unmistakable. Nerves erect themselves; fingers automatically
tighten upon spoon or cigarette; a glance at the private
psychometer shows that the emotional temperature has risen from ten
to twenty degrees above normal. Intellectually, there is a strong
desire either to be silent; or to change the conversation; to drag
in, for example, some old family servant, called Crosby, perhaps,
whose dog Rover has died . . . and so evade the issue and lower the
temperature.</p>

<p>But what analysis can we attempt of the emotions on the other
side of the table&mdash;your side? Often, to be candid, while we
are talking about Crosby, we are asking questions&mdash;hence a
certain flatness in the dialogue&mdash;about you. What are the
powerful and subconscious motives that are raising the hackles on
your side of the table? Is the old savage who has killed a bison
asking the other old savage to admire his prowess? Is the tired
professional man demanding sympathy and resenting competition? Is
the patriach calling for the siren? Is dominance craving for
submission? And, most persistent and difficult of all the questions
that our silence covers, what possible satisfaction can dominance
give to the dominator?<sup><a href="#332">32</a></sup> Now, since
Professor Grensted has said that the psychology of the sexes is
'still a matter for specialists', while 'its interpretation remains
controversial and in many respects obscure', it would be politic
perhaps to leave these questions to be answered by specialists. But
since, on the other hand, if common men and women are to be free
they must learn to speak freely, we cannot leave the psychology of
the sexes to the charge of specialists. There are two good reasons
why we must try to analyse both our fear and your anger; first,
because such fear and anger prevent real freedom in the private
house; second, because such fear and anger may prevent real freedom
in the public world: they may have a positive share in causing war.
Let us then grope our way amateurishly enough among these very
ancient and obscure emotions which we have known ever since the
time of Antigone and Ismene and Creon at least; which St Paul
himself seems to have felt; but which the Professors have only
lately brought to the surface and named 'infantile fixation',
'Oedipus complex', and the rest. We must try, however feebly, to
analyse those emotions since you have asked us to help you in any
way we can to protect liberty and to prevent war.</p>

<p>Let us then examine this 'infantile fixation', for such it seems
is the proper name, in order that we may connect it with the
question you have put to us. Once more, since we are generalists
not specialists, we must rely upon such evidence as we can collect
from history, biography, and from the daily paper&mdash;the only
evidence that is available to the daughters of educated men. We
will take our first example of infantile fixation from biography,
and once more we will have recourse to Victorian biography because
it is only in the Victorian age that biography becomes rich and
representative. Now there are so many cases of infantile fixation
as defined by Professor Grensted in Victorian biography that we
scarcely know which to choose. The case of Mr Barrett of Wimpole
Street is, perhaps, the most famous and the best authenticated.
Indeed, it is so famous that the facts scarcely bear repetition. We
all know the story of the father who would allow neither sons nor
daughters to marry; we all know in greatest detail how his daughter
Elizabeth was forced to conceal her lover from her father; how she
fled with her lover from the house in Wimpole Street; and how her
father never forgave her for that act of disobedience. We shall
agree that Mr Barrett's emotions were strong in the extreme; and
their strength makes it obvious that they had their origin in some
dark place below the level of conscious thought. That is a typical,
a classical case of infantile fixation which we can all bear in
mind. But there are others less famous which a little investigation
will bring to the surface and show to be of the same nature. There
is the case of the Rev. Patrick Bront&euml;. The Rev. Arthur
Nicholls was in love with his daughter, Charlotte; 'What his words
were,' she wrote, when Mr Nicholls proposed to her, 'you can
imagine; his manner you can hardly realize nor can I forget it . .
. I asked if he had spoken to Papa. He said he dared not.' Why did
he dare not? He was strong and young and passionately in love; the
father was old. The reason is immediately apparent. 'He [the Rev.
Patrick Bront&euml;] always disapproved of marriages, and
constantly talked against them. But he more than disapproved this
time; he could not bear the idea of this attachment of Mr Nicholls
to his daughter. Fearing the consequences . . . she made haste to
give her father a promise that, on the morrow, Mr Nicholls should
have a distinct refusal.'<sup><a href="#333">33</a></sup> Mr
Nicholls left Haworth; Charlotte remained with her father. Her
married life&mdash;it was to be a short one&mdash;was shortened
still further by her father's wish.</p>

<p>For a third example of infantile fixation let us choose one that
is less simple, but for that reason more illuminating. There is the
case of Mr Jex-Blake. Here we have the case of a father who is not
confronted with his daughter's marriage but with his daughter's
wish to earn her living. That wish also would seem to have aroused
in the father a very strong emotion and an emotion which also seems
to have its origin in the levels below conscious thought. Again
with your leave we will call it a case of infantile fixation. The
daughter, Sophia, was offered a small sum for teaching mathematics;
and she asked her father's permission to take it. That permission
was instantly and heatedly refused. 'Dearest, I have only this
moment heard that you contemplate being paid for the tutorship. It
would be quite beneath you, darling, and I <i>cannot consent</i> to
it.' [The italics are the father's.] 'Take the post as one of
honour and usefulness, and I shall be glad . . . But to be
<i>paid</i> for the work would be to alter the thing
<i>completely,</i> and would lower you sadly in the eyes of almost
everybody.' That is a very interesting statement. Sophia, indeed,
was led to argue the matter. Why was it beneath her, she asked, why
should it lower her? Taking money for work did not lower Tom in
anybody's eyes. That, Mr Jex-Blake explained, was quite a different
matter; Tom was a man; Tom 'feels bound as a man . . . to support
his wife and family'; Tom had therefore taken 'the <i>plain
path</i> of duty'. Still Sophia was not satisfied. She
argued&mdash;not only was she poor and wanted the money; but also
she felt strongly 'the honest, and I believe perfectly justifiable
pride of earning'. Thus pressed Mr Jex-Blake at last gave, under a
semi-transparent cover, the real reason why he objected to her
taking money. He offered to give her the money himself if she would
refuse to take it from the College. It was plain, therefore, that
he did not object to her taking money: what he objected to was her
taking money from another man. The curious nature of his proposal
did not escape Sophia's scrutiny. 'In that case,' she said, 'I must
say to the Dean, not, "I am willing to work without payment," but
"My Father prefers that I should receive payment from <i>him,</i>
not from the College," and I think the Dean would think us both
ridiculous, or at least foolish.' Whatever interpretation the Dean
might have put upon Mr Jex-Blake's behaviour, we can have no doubt
what emotion was at the root of it. He wished to keep his daughter
in his own power. If she took money from him she remained in his
power; if she took it from another man not only was she becoming
independent of Mr Jex-Blake, she was becoming dependent upon
another man. That he wished her to depend upon him, and felt
obscurely that this desirable dependence could only be secured by
financial dependence is proved indirectly by another of his veiled
statements. 'If you married tomorrow to my liking&mdash;and I don't
believe you would ever marry otherwise&mdash;I should give you a
good fortune.'<sup><a href="#334">34</a></sup> If she became a
wage-earner, she could dispense with the fortune and marry whom she
liked. The case of Mr Jex-Blake is very easily diagnosed, but it is
a very important case because it is a normal case, a typical case.
Mr Jex-Blake was no monster of Wimpole Street; he was an ordinary
father; he was doing what thousands of other Victorian fathers
whose cases remain unpublished were doing daily. It is a case,
therefore, that explains much that lies at the root of Victorian
psychology&mdash;that psychology of the sexes which is still,
Professor Grensted tells us, so obscure. The case of Mr Jex-Blake
shows that the daughter must not on any account be allowed to make
money because if she makes money she will be independent of her
father and free to marry any man she chooses. Therefore the
daughter's desire to earn her living rouses two different forms of
jealousy. Each is strong separately; together they are very strong.
It is further significant that in order to justify this very strong
emotion which has its origin below the levels of conscious thought
Mr Jex-Blake had recourse to one of the commonest of all evasions;
the argument which is not an argument but an appeal to the
emotions. He appealed to the very deep, ancient and complex emotion
which we may, as amateurs, call the womanhood emotion. To take
money was beneath her he said; if she took money she would lower
herself in the eyes of almost everybody. Tom being a man would not
be lowered; it was her sex that made the difference. He appealed to
her womanhood.</p>

<p>Whenever a man makes that appeal to a woman he rouses in her, it
is safe to say, a conflict of emotions of a very deep and primitive
kind which it is extremely difficult for her to analyse or to
reconcile. It may serve to transmit the feeling if we compare it
with the confused conflict of manhood emotions that is roused in
you, Sir, should a woman hand you a white feather.<sup><a href=
"#335">35</a></sup> It is interesting to see how Sophia, in the
year 1859, tried to deal with this emotion. Her first instinct was
to attack the most obvious form of womanhood, that which lay
uppermost in her consciousness and seemed to be responsible for her
father's attitude&mdash;her ladyhood. Like other educated men's
daughters Sophia Jex-Blake was what is called 'a lady'. It was the
lady who could not earn money; therefore the lady must be killed.
'Do you honestly, father, think,' she asked, 'any lady lowered by
the mere act of receiving money? Did you think the less of Mrs Teed
because you paid her?' Then, as if aware that Mrs Teed, being a
governess, was not on a par with herself who came of an upper
middle-class family, 'whose lineage will be found in <i>Burke's
Landed Gentry</i>', she quickly called in to help her to kill the
lady 'Mary Jane Evans . . . one of the proudest families of our
relations', and then Miss Wodehouse, 'whose family is better and
older than mine'&mdash;they both thought her right in wishing to
earn money. And not only did Miss Wodehouse think her right in
wishing to earn money; Miss Wodehouse 'showed she agreed with my
opinions by her actions. She sees no meanness in earning, but in
those that think it mean. When accepting Maurice's school, she said
to him, most nobly, I think, "If you think it better that I should
work as a paid mistress, I will take any salary you please; if not,
I am willing to do the work freely and for nothing".' The lady,
sometimes, was a noble lady; and that lady it was hard to kill; but
killed she must be, as Sophia realized, if Sophia were to enter
that Paradise where 'lots of girls walk about London when and where
they please,' that 'Elysium upon earth', which is (or was), Queen's
College, Harley Street, where the daughters of educated men enjoy
the happiness not of ladies 'but of Queens&mdash;Work and
independence!'<sup><a href="#336">36</a></sup> Thus Sophia's first
instinct was to kill the lady;<sup><a href="#337">37</a></sup> but
when the lady was killed the woman still remained. We can see her,
concealing and excusing the disease of infantile fixation, more
clearly in the other two cases. It was the woman, the human being
whose sex made it her sacred duty to sacrifice herself to the
father, whom Charlotte Bront&euml; and Elizabeth Barrett had to
kill. If it was difficult to kill the lady, it was even more
difficult to kill the woman. Charlotte found it at first almost
impossible. She refused her lover. '. . . thus thoughtfully for her
father, and unselfishly for herself [she] put aside all
consideration of how she should reply, excepting as he wished.' She
loved Arthur Nicholls; but she refused him. '. . . she held herself
simply passive, as far as words and actions went, while she
suffered acute pain from the strong expressions which her father
used in speaking of Mr Nicholls.' She waited; she suffered; until
'the great conqueror Time', as Mrs Gaskell puts it, 'achieved his
victory over strong prejudice and human resolve.' Her father
consented. The great conqueror, however, had met his match in Mr
Barrett; Elizabeth Barrett waited; Elizabeth suffered; at last
Elizabeth fled.</p>

<p>The extreme force of the emotions to which the infantile
fixation gives rise is proved by these three cases. It is
remarkable, we may agree. It was a force that could quell not only
Charlotte Bront&euml; but Arthur Nicholls; not only Elizabeth
Barrett but Robert Browning. It was a force thus that could do
battle with the strongest of human passions&mdash;the love of men
and women; and could compel the most brilliant and the boldest of
Victorian sons and daughters to quail before it; to cheat the
father, to deceive the father, and then to fly from the father. But
to what did it owe this amazing force? Partly as these cases make
clear, to the fact that the infantile fixation was protected by
society. Nature, law and property were all ready to excuse and
conceal it. It was easy for Mr Barrett, Mr Jex-Blake and the Rev.
Patrick Bront&euml; to hide the real nature of their emotions from
themselves. If they wished that their daughter should stay at home,
society agreed that they were right. If the daughter protested,
then nature came to their help. A daughter who left her father was
an unnatural daughter; her womanhood was suspect. Should she
persist further, then law came to his help. A daughter who left her
father had no means of supporting herself. The lawful professions
were shut to her. Finally, if she earned money in the one
profession that was open to her, the oldest profession of all, she
unsexed herself. There can be no question&mdash;the infantile
fixation is powerful, even when a mother is infected. But when the
father is infected it has a threefold power; he has nature to
protect him, law to protect him; and property to protect him. Thus
protected it was perfectly possible for the Rev. Patrick
Bront&euml; to cause 'acute pain' to his daughter Charlotte for
several months, and to steal several months of her short married
happiness without incurring any censure from the society in which
he practised the profession of a priest of the Church of England;
though had he tortured a dog, or stolen a watch, that same society
would have unfrocked him and cast him forth. Society it seems was a
father, and afflicted with the infantile fixation too.</p>

<p>Since society protected and indeed excused the victims of the
infantile fixation in the nineteenth century, it is not surprising
that the disease, though unnamed, was rampant. Whatever biography
we open we find almost always the familiar symptoms&mdash;the
father is opposed to his daughter's marriage; the father is opposed
to his daughter's earning her living. Her wish either to marry, or
to earn her living, rouses strong emotion in him; and he gives the
same excuses for that strong emotion; the lady will debase her
ladyhood; the daughter will outrage her womanhood. But now and
again, very rarely, we find a father who was completely immune from
the disease. The results are then extremely interesting. There is
the case of Mr Leigh Smith.<sup><a href="#338">38</a></sup> This
gentleman was contemporary with Mr Jex-Blake, and came of the same
social caste. He, too, had property in Sussex; he, too, had horses
and carriages; and he, too, had children. But there the resemblance
ends. Mr Leigh Smith was devoted to his children; he objected to
schools; he kept his children at home. It would be interesting to
discuss Mr Leigh Smith's educational methods; how he had masters to
teach them; how, in a large carriage built like an omnibus, he took
them with him on long journeys yearly all over England. But like so
many experimentalists, Mr Leigh Smith remains obscure; and we must
content ourselves with the fact that he 'held the unusual opinion
that daughters should have an equal provision with sons.' So
completely immune was he from the infantile fixation that 'he did
not adopt the ordinary plan of paying his daughter's bills and
giving them an occasional present, but when Barbara came of age in
1848 he gave her an allowance of &pound;300 a year.' The results of
that immunity from the infantile fixation were remarkable. For
'treating her money as a power to do good, one of the first uses to
which Barbara put it was educational.' She founded a school; a
school that was open not only to different sexes and different
classes, but to different creeds; Roman Catholics, Jews and 'pupils
from families of advanced free thought' were received in it. 'It
was a most unusual school,' an outsiders' school. But that was not
all that she attempted upon three hundred a year. One thing led to
another. A friend, with her help, started a cooperative evening
class for ladies 'for drawing from an undraped model'. In 1858 only
one life class in London was open to ladies. And then a petition
was got up to the Royal Academy; its schools were actually, though
as so often happens only nominally, opened to women in
1861;<sup><a href="#339">39</a></sup> next Barbara went into the
question of the laws concerning women; so that actually in 1871
married women were allowed to own their property; and finally she
helped Miss Davies to found Girton. When we reflect what one father
who was immune from infantile fixation could do by allowing one
daughter &pound;300 a year we need not wonder that most fathers
firmly refused to allow their daughters more than &pound;40 a year
with bed and board thrown in.</p>

<p>The infantile fixation in the fathers then was, it is clear, a
strong force, and all the stronger because it was a concealed
force. But the fathers were met, as the nineteenth century drew on,
by a force which had become so strong in its turn that it is much
to be hoped that the psychologists will find some name for it. The
old names as we have seen are futile and false. 'Feminism', we have
had to destroy. 'The emancipation of women' is equally inexpressive
and corrupt. To say that the daughters were inspired prematurely by
the principles of anti-Fascism is merely to repeat the fashionable
and hideous jargon of the moment. To call them champions of
intellectual liberty and culture is to cloud the air with the dust
of lecture halls and the damp dowdiness of public meetings.
Moreover, none of these tags and labels express the real emotions
that inspired the daughters' opposition to the infantile fixation
of the fathers, because, as biography shows, that force had behind
it many different emotions, and many that were contradictory. Tears
were behind it, of course&mdash;tears, bitter tears: the tears of
those whose desire for knowledge was frustrated. One daughter
longed to learn chemistry; the books at home only taught her
alchemy. She 'cried bitterly at not being taught things'. Also the
desire for an open and rational love was behind it. Again there
were tears&mdash;angry tears. 'She flung herself on the bed in
tears . . . "Oh," she said, "Harry is on the roof." "Who's Harry?"
said I; "which roof? Why?" "Oh, don't be silly," she said; "he had
to go."'<sup><a href="#340">40</a></sup> But again the desire not
to love, to lead a rational existence without love, was behind it.
'I make the confession humbly . . . I know nothing myself of
love,'<sup><a href="#340">41</a></sup> wrote one of them. An odd
confession from one of the class whose only profession for so many
centuries had been marriage; but significant. Others wanted to
travel; to explore Africa; to dig in Greece and Palestine. Some
wanted to learn music, not to tinkle domestic airs, but to
compose&mdash;operas, symphonies, quartets. Others wanted to paint,
not ivy-clad cottages, but naked bodies. They all wanted&mdash;but
what one word can sum up the variety of the things that they
wanted, and had wanted, consciously or subconsciously, for so long?
Josephine Butler's label&mdash;Justice, Equality, Liberty&mdash;is
a fine one; but it is only a label, and in our age of innumerable
labels, of multi-coloured labels, we have become suspicious of
labels; they kill and constrict. Nor does the old word 'freedom'
serve, for it was not freedom in the sense of licence that they
wanted; they wanted, like Antigone, not to break the laws, but to
find the law.<sup><a href="#342">42</a></sup> Ignorant as we are of
human motives and ill supplied with words, let us then admit that
no one word expresses the force which in the nineteenth century
opposed itself to the force of the fathers. All we can safely say
about that force was that it was a force of tremendous power. It
forced open the doors of the private house. It opened Bond Street
and Piccadilly; it opened cricket grounds and football grounds; it
shrivelled flounces and stays; it made the oldest profession in the
world (but Whitaker supplies no figures) unprofitable. In fifty
years, in short, that force made the life lived by Lady Lovelace
and Gertrude Bell unlivable, and almost incredible. The fathers,
who had triumphed over the strongest emotions of strong men, had to
yield.</p>

<p>If that full stop were the end of the story, the final slam of
the door, we could turn at once to your letter, Sir, and to the
form which you have asked us to fill up. But it was not the end; it
was the beginning. Indeed though we have used the past, we shall
soon find ourselves using the present tense. The fathers in
private, it is true, yielded; but the fathers in public, massed
together in societies, in professions, were even more subject to
the fatal disease than the fathers in private. The disease had
acquired a motive, had connected itself with a right, a conception,
which made it still more virulent outside the house than within.
The desire to support wife and children&mdash;what motive could be
more powerful, or deeply rooted? For it was connected with manhood
itself&mdash;a man who could not support his family failed in his
own conception of manliness. And was not that conception as deep in
him as the conception of womanhood in his daughter? It was those
motives, those rights and conceptions that were now challenged. To
protect them, and from women, gave, and gives, rise it can scarcely
be doubted to an emotion perhaps below the level of conscious
thought but certainly of the utmost violence. The infantile
fixation develops, directly the priest's right to practise his
profession is challenged, to an aggravated and exacerbated emotion
to which the name sex taboo is scientifically applied. Take two
instances; one private, the other public. A scholar has 'to mark
his disapproval of the admission of women to his university by
refusing to enter his beloved college or city.'<sup><a href=
"#343">43</a></sup> A hospital has to decline an offer to endow a
scholarship because it is made by a woman on behalf of
women.<sup><a href="#344">44</a></sup> Can we doubt that both
actions are inspired by that sense of shame which, as Professor
Grensted says 'cannot be regarded in any other light than as a
non-rational sex taboo?' But since the emotion itself had increased
in strength it became necessary to invoke the help of stronger
allies to excuse and conceal it. Nature was called in; Nature it
was claimed who is not only omniscient but unchanging, had made the
brain of woman of the wrong shape or size. 'Anyone', writes
Bertrand Russell, 'who desires amusement may be advised to look up
the tergiversations of eminent craniologists in their attempts to
prove from brain measurements that women are stupider than
men.'<sup><a href="#345">45</a></sup> Science, it would seem, is
not sexless; she is a man, a father, and infected too. Science,
thus infected, produced measurements to order: the brain was too
small to be examined. Many years were spent waiting before the
sacred gates of the universities and hospitals for permission to
have the brains that the professors said that Nature had made
incapable of passing examinations examined. When at last permission
was granted the examinations were passed. A long and dreary list of
those barren if necessary triumphs lies presumably along with other
broken records<sup><a href="#346">46</a></sup> in college archives,
and harassed head mistresses still consult them, it is said, when
desiring official proof of impeccable mediocrity. Still Nature held
out. The brain that could pass examinations was not the creative
brain; the brain that can bear responibility and earn the higher
salaries. It was a practical brain, a pettifogging brain, a brain
fitted for routine work under the command of a superior. And since
the professions were shut, it was undeniable&mdash;the daughters
had not ruled Empires, commanded fleets, or led armies to victory;
only a few trivial books testified to their professional ability,
for literature was the only profession that had been open to them.
And, moreover, whatever the brain might do when the professions
were opened to it, the body remained. Nature, the priests said, in
her infinite wisdom, had laid down the unalterable law that man is
the creator. He enjoys; she only passively endures. Pain was more
beneficial than pleasure to the body that endures. 'The views of
medical men on pregnancy, childbirth, and lactation were until
fairly recently', Bertrand Russell writes, 'impregnated with
sadism. It required, for example, more evidence to persuade them
that anaesthetics may be used in childbirth than it would have
required to persuade them of the opposite.' So science argued, so
the professors agreed. And when at last the daughters interposed,
But are not brain and body affected by training? Does not the wild
rabbit differ from the rabbit in the hutch? And must we not, and do
we not change this unalterable nature? By setting a match to a fire
frost is defied; Nature's decree of death is postponed. And the
breakfast egg, they persisted, is it all the work of the cock?
Without yolk, without white, how far would your breakfasts, oh
priests and professors, be fertile? Then the priests and professors
in solemn unison intoned: But childbirth itself, that burden you
cannot deny, is laid upon woman alone. Nor could they deny it, nor
wish to renounce it. Still they declared, consulting the statistics
in books, the time occupied by woman in childbirth is under modern
conditions&mdash;remember we are in the twentieth century
now&mdash;only a fraction.<sup><a href="#347">47</a></sup> Did that
fraction incapacitate us from working in Whitehall, in fields and
factories, when our country was in danger? To which the fathers
replied: The war is over; we are in England now.</p>

<p>And if, Sir, pausing in England now, we turn on the wireless of
the daily press we shall hear what answer the fathers who are
infected with infantile fixation now are making to those questions
now. 'Homes are the real places of the women . . . Let them go back
to their homes . . . The Government should give work to men. . . .
A strong protest is to be made by the Ministry of Labour. . . .
Women must not rule over men . . . There are two worlds, one for
women, the other for men . . . Let them learn to cook our dinners .
. . Women have failed . . . They have failed . . . They have failed
. . .'</p>

<p>Even now the clamour, the uproar that infantile fixation is
making even here is such that we can hardly hear ourselves speak;
it takes the words out of our mouths; it makes us say what we have
not said. As we listen to the voices we seem to hear an infant
crying in the night, the black night that now covers Europe, and
with no language but a cry, Ay, ay, ay, ay . . . But it is not a
new cry, it is a very old cry. Let us shut off the wireless and
listen to the past. We are in Greece now; Christ has not been born
yet, nor St Paul either. But listen:</p>

<p>'Whomsoever the city may appoint, that man must be obeyed, in
little things and great, in just things and unjust . . .
disobedience is the worst of evils . . . We must support the cause
of order, and in no wise suffer a woman to worst us . . . They must
be women, and not range at large. Servants, take them within.' That
is the voice of Creon, the dictator. To whom Antigone, who was to
have been his daughter, answered, 'Not such are the laws set among
men by the justice who dwells with the gods below.' But she had
neither capital nor force behind her. And Creon said: 'I will take
her where the path is loneliest, and hide her, living, in a rocky
vault.' And he shut her not in Holloway or in a concentration camp,
but in a tomb. And Creon we read brought ruin on his house, and
scattered the land with the bodies of the dead. It seems, Sir, as
we listen to the voices of the past, as if we were looking at the
photograph again, at the picture of dead bodies and ruined houses
that the Spanish Government sends us almost weekly. Things repeat
themselves it seems. Pictures and voices are the same today as they
were 2,000 years ago.</p>

<p>Such then is the conclusion to which our inquiry into the nature
of fear has brought us&mdash;the fear which forbids freedom in the
private house. That fear, small, insignificant and private as it
is, is connected with the other fear, the public fear, which is
neither small nor insignificant, the fear which has led you to ask
us to help you to prevent war. Otherwise we should not be looking
at the picture again. But it is not the same picture that caused us
at the beginning of this letter to feel the same emotions&mdash;you
called them 'horror and disgust'; we called them horror and
disgust. For as this letter has gone on, adding fact to fact,
another picture has imposed itself upon the foreground. It is the
figure of a man; some say, others deny, that he is Man
himself,<sup><a href="#348">48</a></sup> the quintessence of
virility, the perfect type of which all the others are imperfect
adumbrations. He is a man certainly. His eyes are glazed; his eyes
glare. His body, which is braced in an unnatural position, is
tightly cased in a uniform. Upon the breast of that uniform are
sewn several medals and other mystic symbols. His hand is upon a
sword. He is called in German and Italian F&uuml;hrer or Duce; in
our own language Tyrant or Dictator. And behind him lie ruined
houses and dead bodies&mdash;men, women and children. But we have
not laid that picture before you in order to excite once more the
sterile emotion of hate. On the contrary it is in order to release
other emotions such as the human figure, even thus crudely in a
coloured photograph, arouses in us who are human beings. For it
suggests a connection and for us a very important connection. It
suggests that the public and the private worlds are inseparably
connected; that the tyrannies and servilities of the one are the
tyrannies and servilities of the other. But the human figure even
in a photograph suggests other and more complex emotions. It
suggests that we cannot dissociate ourselves from that figure but
are ourselves that figure. It suggests that we are not passive
spectators doomed to unresisting obedience but by our thoughts and
actions can ourselves change that figure. A common interest unites
us; it is one world, one life. How essential it is that we should
realize that unity the dead bodies, the ruined houses prove. For
such will be our ruin if you, in the immensity of your public
abstractions forget the private figure, or if we in the intensity
of our private emotions forget the public world. Both houses will
be ruined, the public and the private, the material and the
spiritual, for they are inseparably connected. But with your letter
before us we have reason to hope. For by asking our help you
recognize that connection; and by reading your words we are
reminded of other connections that lie far deeper than the facts on
the surface. Even here, even now your letter tempts us to shut our
ears to these little facts, these trivial details, to listen not to
the bark of the guns and the bray of the gramophones but to the
voices of the poets, answering each other, assuring us of a unity
that rubs out divisions as if they were chalk marks only; to
discuss with you the capacity of the human spirit to overflow
boundaries and make unity out of multiplicity. But that would be to
dream&mdash;to dream the recurring dream that has haunted the human
mind since the beginning of time; the dream of peace, the dream of
freedom. But, with the sound of the guns in your ears you have not
asked us to dream. You have not asked us what peace is; you have
asked us how to prevent war. Let us then leave it to the poets to
tell us what the dream is; and fix our eyes upon the photograph
again: the fact. Whatever the verdict of others may be upon the man
in uniform&mdash;and opinions differ&mdash;there is your letter to
prove that to you the picture is the picture of evil. And though we
look upon that picture from different angles our conclusion is the
same as yours&mdash;it is evil. We are both determined to do what
we can to destroy the evil which that picture represents, you by
your methods, we by ours. And since we are different, our help must
be different. What ours can be we have tried to show&mdash;how
imperfectly, how superficially there is no need to
say.<sup><a href="#349">49</a></sup> But as a result the answer to
your question must be that we can best help you to prevent war not
by repeating your words and following your methods but by finding
new words and creating new methods. We can best help you to prevent
war not by joining your society but by remaining outside your
society but in cooperation with its aim. That aim is the same for
us both. It is to assert 'the rights of all&mdash;all men and
women&mdash;to the respect in their persons of the great principles
of Justice and Equality and Liberty.' To elaborate further is
unnecessary, for we have every confidence that you interpret those
words as we do. And excuses are unnecessary, for we can trust you
to make allowances for those deficiencies which we foretold and
which this letter has abundantly displayed.</p>

<p>To return then to the form that you have sent and ask us to fill
up: for the reasons given we will leave it unsigned. But in order
to prove as substantially as possible that our aims are the same as
yours, here is the guinea, a free gift, given freely, without any
other conditions than you choose to impose upon yourself. It is the
third of three guineas; but the three guineas, you will observe,
though given to three different treasurers are all given to the
same cause, for the causes are the same and inseparable.</p>

<p>Now, since you are pressed for time, let me make an end;
apologizing three times over to the three of you, first for the
length of this letter, second for the smallness of the
contribution, and thirdly for writing at all. The blame for that
however rests upon you, for this letter would never have been
written had you not asked for an answer to your own.</p>

<p><a name="101" id="101">1.</a> <i>The Life of Mary Kingsley,</i>
by Stephen Gwynn, p. 15. It is difficult to get exact figures of
the sums spent on the education of educated men's daughters. About
&pound;20 or &pound;30 presumably covered the entire cost of Mary
Kingsley's education <i>(b.</i> 1862; <i>d.</i> 1900). A sum of
&pound;100 may be taken as about the average in the nineteenth
century and even later. The women thus educated often felt the lack
of education very keenly. 'I always feel the defects of my
education most painfully when I go out,' wrote Anne J. Clough, the
first Principal of Newnham. <i>(Life of Anne J. Clough,</i> by B.
A. Clough, p. 60.) Elizabeth Haldane, who came, like Miss Clough,
of a highly literate family, but was educated in much the same way,
says that when she grew up, 'My first conviction was that I was not
educated, and I thought of how this could be put right. I should
have loved going to college, but college in those days was unusual
for girls, and the idea was not encouraged. It was also expensive.
For an only daughter to leave a widowed mother was indeed
considered to be out of the question, and no one made the plan seem
feasible. There was in those days a new movement for carrying on
correspondence classes . . .' (<i>From One Century to Another,</i>
by Elizabeth Haldane, p. 73.) The efforts of such uneducated women
to conceal their ignorance were often valiant, but not always
successful. 'They talked agreeably on current topics, carefully
avoiding controversial subjects. What impressed me was their
ignorance and indifference concerning anything outside their own
circle . . . no less a personage than the mother of the Speaker of
the House of Commons believed that California belonged to us, part
of our Empire!' (<i>Distant Fields,</i> by H. A. Vachell, p. 109.)
That ignorance was often simulated in the nineteenth century owing
to the current belief that educated men enjoyed it is shown by the
energy with which Thomas Gisborne, in his instructive work <i>On
the Duties of Women</i> (p. 278), rebuked those who recommend women
'studiously to refrain from discovering to their partners in
marriage the full extent of their abilities and attainments.' 'This
is not discretion but art. It is dissimulation, it is deliberate
imposition . . . It could scarcely be practised long without
detection.'</p>

<p>But the educated man's daughter in the nineteenth century was
even more ignorant of life than of books. One reason for that
ignorance is suggested by the following quotation: 'It was supposed
that most men were not "virtuous", that is, that nearly all would
be capable of accosting and annoying&mdash;or worse&mdash;any
unaccompanied young woman whom they met.' ('Society and the
Season', by Mary, Countess of Lovelace, in <i>Fifty</i>
<i>Years,</i> 1882-1932, p. 37.) She was therefore confined to a
very narrow circle; and her 'ignorance and indifference' to
anything outside it was excusable. The connection between that
ignorance and the nineteenth-century conception of manhood,
which&mdash;witness the Victorian hero&mdash;made 'virtue' and
virility incompatible is obvious. In a well-known passage Thackeray
complains of the limitations which virtue and virility between them
imposed upon his art.</p>

<p><a name="102" id="102">2.</a> Our ideology is still so
inveterately anthropocentric that it has been necessary to coin
this clumsy term&mdash;educated man's daughter&mdash;to describe
the class whose fathers have been educated at public schools and
universities. Obviously, if the term 'bourgeois' fits her brother,
it is grossly incorrect to use it of one who differs so profoundly
in the two prime characteristics of the bourgeoisie&mdash;capital
and environment.</p>

<p><a name="103" id="103">3.</a> The number of animals killed in
England for sport during the past century must be beyond
computation. 1,212 head of game is given as the average for a day's
shooting at Chatsworth in 1909. <i>(Men, Women and Things,</i> by
the Duke of Portland, p. 251.) Little mention is made in sporting
memoirs of women guns; and their appearance in the hunting field
was the cause of much caustic comment. 'Skittles', the famous
nineteenth-century horsewoman, was a lady of easy morals. It is
highly probable that there was held to be some connection between
sport and unchastity in women in the nineteenth century.</p>

<p><a name="110" id="110">10.</a> There is of course one essential
that the educated woman can supply: children. And one method by
which she can help to prevent war is to refuse to bear children.
Thus Mrs Helena Normanton is of opinion that 'The only thing that
women in any country can do to prevent war is to stop the supply of
"cannon fodder".' (Report of the Annual Council for Equal
Citizenship, <i>Daily Telegraph,</i> 5 March 1937.) Letters in the
newspapers frequently support this view. 'I can tell Mr Harry
Campbell why women refuse to have children in these times. When men
have learnt how to run the lands they govern so that wars shall hit
only those who make the quarrels, instead of mowing down those who
do not, then women may again feel like having large families. Why
should women bring children into such a world as this one is
today?' (Edith Maturin-Porch, in the <i>Daily Telegraph,</i> 6
September 1937.) The fact that the birth rate in the educated class
is falling would seem to show that educated women are taking Mrs
Normanton's advice. It was offered them in very similar
circumstances over two thousand years ago by Lysistrata.</p>

<p><a name="111" id="111">11.</a> There are of course innumerable
kinds of influence besides those specified in the text. It varies
from the simple kind described in the following passage: 'Three
years later . . . we find her writing to him as Cabinet Minister to
solicit his interest on behalf of a favourite parson for a Crown
living . . ." (<i>Henry Chaplin, a Memoir,</i> by Lady Londonderry,
p. 57) to the very subtle kind exerted by Lady Macbeth upon her
husband. Somewhere between the two lies the influence described by
D. H. Lawrence: 'It is hopeless for me to try to do anything
without I have a woman at the back of me . . . I daren't sit in the
world without I have a woman behind me . . . But a woman that I
love sort of keeps me in direct communication with the unknown, in
which otherwise I am a bit lost' <i>(Letters</i> of D. H. Lawrence,
pp. 93-4), with which we may compare, though the collocation is
strange, the famous and very similar definition given by the
ex-King Edward VIII upon his abdication. Present political
conditions abroad seem to favour a return to the use of interested
influence. For example: 'A story serves to illustrate the present
degree of women's influence in Vienna. During the past autumn a
measure was planned to further diminish women's professional
opportunities. Protests, pleas, letters, all were of no avail.
Finally, in desperation, a group of well-known ladies of the city .
. . got together and planned. For the next fortnight, for a certain
number of hours per day, several of these ladies got on to the
telephone to the Ministers they knew personally, ostensibly to ask
them to dinner at their homes. With all the charm of which the
Viennese are capable, they kept the Ministers talking, asking about
this and that, and finally mentioning the matter that distressed
them so much. When the Ministers had been rung up by several
ladies, all of whom they did not wish to offend, and kept from
urgent State affairs by this manoeuvre, they decided on
compromise&mdash;and so the measure was postponed.' <i>(Women Must
Choose,</i> by Hilary Newitt, p. 129.) Similar use of influence was
often deliberately made during the battle for the franchise. But
women's influence is said to be impaired by the possession of a
vote. Thus Marshal von Bieberstein was of opinion that 'Women led
men always . . . but he did not wish them to vote.' (<i>From One
Century to Another,</i> by Elizabeth Haldane, p. 258.)</p>

<p><a name="112" id="112">12.</a> English women were much
criticized for using force in the battle for the franchise. When in
1910 Mr Birrell had his hat 'reduced to pulp' and his shins kicked
by suffragettes. Sir Almeric Fitzroy commented, 'an attack of this
character upon a defenceless old man by an organized band of
"janissaries" will, it is hoped, convince many people of the insane
and anarchical spirit actuating the movement.' (<i>Memoirs of Sir
Almeric Fitzroy,</i> vol. II, p. 425.) These remarks did not apply
apparently to the force in the European war. The vote indeed was
given to English women largely because of the help they gave to
Englishmen in using force in that war. 'On 14 August [1916], Mr
Asquith himself gave up his opposition [to the franchise]. "It is
true," he said, "[that women] cannot fight in the sense of going
out with rifles and so forth, but . . . they have aided in the most
effective way in the prosecution of the war."' (<i>The Cause,</i>
by Ray Strachey, p. 354.) This raises the difficult question
whether those who did not aid in the prosecution of the war, but
did what they could to hinder the prosecution of the war, ought to
use the vote to which they are entitled chiefly because others
'aided in the prosecution of the war'? That they are stepdaughters,
not full daughters, of England is shown by the fact that they
change nationality on marriage. A woman, whether or not she helped
to beat the Germans, becomes a German if she marries a German. Her
political views must then be entirely reversed, and her filial
piety transferred.</p>

<p><a name="113" id="113">13.</a> <i>Sir Ernest Wild, K.C.,</i> by
Robert J. Blackburn, pp. 174-5.</p>

<p><a name="114" id="114">14.</a> That the right to vote has not
proved negligible is shown by the facts published from time to time
by the National Union of Societies for Equal Citizenship. 'This
publication (<i>What</i> <i>the Vote Has Done</i>) was originally a
single-page leaflet; it has now (1927) grown to a six-page
pamphlet, and has to be constantly enlarged.' (<i>Josephine
Butler,</i> by M. G. Fawcett and E. M. Turner, note, p. 101.)</p>

<p><a name="115" id="115">15.</a> There are no figures available
with which to check facts that must have a very important bearing
upon the biology and psychology of the sexes. A beginning might be
made in this essential but strangely neglected preliminary by
chalking on a large-scale map of England property owned by men,
red; by women, blue. Then the number of sheep and cattle consumed
by each sex must be compared; the hogsheads of wine and beer; the
barrels of tobacco; after which we must examine carefully their
physical exercises; domestic employments; facilities for sexual
intercourse, etc. Historians are of course mainly concerned with
war and politics; but sometimes throw light upon human nature. Thus
Macaulay dealing with the English country gentleman in the
seventeenth century, says: 'His wife and daughter were in tastes
and acquirements below a housekeeper or still-room maid of the
present day. They stitched and spun, brewed gooseberry wine, cured
marigolds, and made the crust for the venison pasty.'</p>

<p>Again, 'The ladies of the house, whose business it had commonly
been to cook the repast, retired as soon as the dishes had been
devoured, and left the gentlemen to their ale and tobacco.'
(<i>Macaulay, History of England,</i> Chapter Three.) But the
gentlemen were still drinking and the ladies were still withdrawing
a great deal later. 'In my mother's young days before her marriage,
the old hard-drinking habits of the Regency and of the eighteenth
century still persisted. At Woburn Abbey it was the custom for the
trusted old family butler to make his nightly report to my
grandmother in the drawing-room. 'The gentlemen have had a good
deal tonight; it might be as well for the young ladies to retire,'
or, 'The gentlemen have had very little tonight,' was announced
according to circumstances by this faithful family retainer. Should
the young girls be packed off upstairs, they liked standing on an
upper gallery of the staircase 'to watch the shouting, riotous
crowd issuing from the dining-room.' (<i>The Days Before
Yesterday,</i> by Lord F. Hamilton, p. 322.) It must be left to the
scientist of the future to tell us what effect drink and property
have had upon chromosomes.</p>

<p><a name="116" id="116">16.</a> The fact that both sexes have a
very marked though dissimilar love of dress seems to have escaped
the notice of the dominant sex owing largely it must be supposed to
the hypnotic power of dominance. Thus the late Mr Justice
MacCardie, in summing up the case of Mrs Frankau, remarked: 'Women
cannot be expected to renounce an essential feature of femininity
or to abandon one of nature's solaces for a constant and
insuperable physical handicap . . . Dress, after all, is one of the
chief methods of women's self-expression . . . In matters of dress
women often remain children to the end. The psychology of the
matter must not be overlooked. But whilst bearing the above matters
in mind the law has rightly laid it down that the rule of prudence
and proportion must be observed.' The Judge who thus dictated was
wearing a scarlet robe, an ermine cape, and a vast wig of
artificial curls. Whether he was enjoying 'one of nature's solaces
for a constant and insuperable physical handicap', whether again he
was himself observing 'the rule of prudence and proportion' must be
doubtful. But 'the psychology of the matter must not be
overlooked'; and the fact that the singularity of his own
appearance together with that of Admirals, Generals, Heralds, Life
Guards, Peers, Beefeaters, etc., was completely invisible to him so
that he was able to lecture the lady without any consciousness of
sharing her weakness, raises two questions: how often must an act
be performed before it becomes tradition, and therefore venerable;
and what degree of social prestige causes blindness to the
remarkable nature of one's own clothes? Singularity of dress, when
not associated with office, seldom escapes ridicule.</p>

<p><a name="117" id="117">17.</a> In the New Year's Honours List
for 1937, 147 men accepted honours as against seven women. For
obvious reasons this cannot be taken as a measure of their
comparative desire for such advertisement. But that it should be
easier, psychologically, for a woman to reject honours than for a
man seems to be indisputable. For the fact that intellect (roughly
speaking) is man's chief professional asset, and that stars and
ribbons are his chief means of advertising intellect, suggests that
stars and ribbons are identical with powder and paint, a woman's
chief method of advertising her chief professional asset: beauty.
It would therefore be as unreasonable to ask him to refuse a
Knighthood as to ask her to refuse a dress. The sum paid for a
Knighthood in 1901 would seem to provide a very tolerable dress
allowance; '21 April (Sunday)&mdash;To see Meynell, who was as
usual full of gossip. It appears that the King's debts have been
paid off privately by his friends, one of whom is said to have lent
&pound;100,000, and satisfies himself with &pound;25,000 in
repayment plus a Knighthood.' (<i>My Diaries,</i> Wilfrid Scawen
Blunt, Part II, p. 8.)</p>

<p><a name="118" id="118">18.</a> What the precise figures are it
is difficult for an outsider to know. But that the incomes are
substantial can be conjectured from a delightful review some years
ago by Mr J. M. Keynes in the <i>Nation</i> of a history of Clare
College, Cambridge. The book 'it is rumoured cost six thousand
pounds to produce.' Rumour has it also that a band of students
returning at dawn from some festivity about that time saw a cloud
in the sky; which as they gazed assumed the shape of a woman; who,
being supplicated for a sign, let fall in a shower of radiant hail
the one word 'Rats'. This was interpreted to signify what from
another page of the same number of the <i>Nation</i> would seem to
be the truth; that the students of one of the women's colleges
suffered greatly from 'cold gloomy ground floor bedrooms overrun
with mice'. The apparition, it was supposed, took this means of
suggesting that if the gentlemen of Clare wished to do her honour a
cheque for &pound;6,000 payable to the Principal of &mdash;&mdash;
would celebrate her better than a book even though 'clothed in the
finest dress of paper and black buckram . . .' There is nothing
mythical, however, about the fact recorded in the same number of
the <i>Nation</i> that 'Somerville received with pathetic gratitude
the &pound;7,000 which went to it last year from the Jubilee gift
and a private bequest.'</p>

<p><a name="119" id="119">19.</a> A great historian has thus
described the origin and character of the universities, in one of
which he was educated: 'The schools of Oxford and Cambridge were
founded in a dark age of false and barbarous science; and they are
still tainted by the vices of their origin . . . The legal
incorporation of these societies by the charters of popes and kings
had given them a monopoly of public instruction; and the spirit of
monopolists is narrow, lazy, and oppressive: their work is more
costly and less productive than that of independent artists; and
the new improvements so eagerly grasped by the competition of
freedom, are admitted with slow and sullen reluctance in those
proud corporations, above the fear of a rival, and below the
confession of an error. We may scarcely hope that any reformation
will be a voluntary act; and so deeply are they rooted in law and
prejudice, that even the omnipotence of parliament would shrink
from an inquiry into the state and abuses of the two universities.'
(Edward Gibbon, <i>Memoirs of My</i> <i>Life and Writings</i>.)
'The omnipotence of Parliament' did however institute an inquiry in
the middle of the nineteenth century 'into the state of the
University [of Oxford], its discipline, studies, and revenues. But
there was so much passive resistance from the Colleges that the
last item had to go by the board. It was ascertained however that
out of 542 Fellowships in all the Colleges of Oxford only
twenty-two were really open to competition without restrictive
conditions of patronage, place or kin . . . The Commissioners . . .
found that Gibbon's indictment had been reasonable . . .'
(<i>Herbert Warren of Magdalen,</i> by Laurie Magnus, pp. 47-9.)
Nevertheless the prestige of a university education remained high;
and Fellowships were considered highly desirable. When Pusey became
a Fellow of Oriel, 'The bells of the parish church at Pusey
expressed the satisfaction of his father and family.' Again, when
Newman was elected a Fellow, 'all the bells of the three towers
[were] set pealing&mdash;at Newman's expense.' (<i>Oxford
Apostles,</i> by Geoffrey Faber, pp. 131, 69.) Yet both Pusey and
Newman were men of a distinctly spiritual nature.</p>

<p><a name="120" id="120">20.</a> <i>The Crystal Cabinet,</i> by
Mary Butts, p. 138. The sentence in full runs: 'For just as I was
told that desire for learning in woman was against the will of God,
so were many innocent freedoms, innocent delights, denied in the
same Name'&mdash;a remark which makes it desirable that we should
have a biography from the pen of an educated man's daughter of the
Deity in whose Name such atrocities have been committed. The
influence of religion upon women's education, one way or another,
can scarcely be overestimated. 'If, for example,' says Thomas
Gisborne, 'the uses of music are explained, let not its effect in
heightening devotion be overlooked. If drawing is the subject of
remark, let the student be taught habitually to contemplate in the
works of creation the power, the wisdom and the goodness of their
Author.' (<i>The Duties of the Female Sex,</i> by Thomas Gisborne,
p. 85.) The fact that Mr Gisborne and his like&mdash;a numerous
band&mdash;base their educational theories upon the teaching of St
Paul would seem to hint that the female sex was to be 'taught
habitually to contemplate in the works of creation, the power and
wisdom and the goodness,' not so much of the Deity, but of Mr
Gisborne. And from that we were led to conclude that a biography of
the Deity would resolve itself into a Dictionary of Clerical
Biography.</p>

<p><a name="121" id="121">21.</a> <i>Mary Astell,</i> by Florence
M. Smith. 'Unfortunately, the opposition to so new an idea (a
college for women) was greater than the interest in it, and came
not only from the satirists of the day, who, like the wits of all
ages, found the progressive woman a source of laughter and made
Mary Astell the subject of stock jokes in comedies of the <i>Femmes
Savantes</i> type, but from churchmen, who saw in the plan an
attempt to bring back popery. The strongest opponent of the idea
was a celebrated bishop, who, as Ballard asserts, prevented a
prominent lady from subscribing &pound;10,000 to the plan.
Elizabeth Elstob gave to Ballard the name of this celebrated bishop
in reply to an inquiry from him. "According to Elizabeth Elstob . .
. it was Bishop Burnet that prevented that good design by
dissuading that lady from encouraging it".' (op. cit., pp. 21-2.)
'That lady' may have been Princess Ann, or Lady Elizabeth Hastings;
but there seems reason to think that it was the Princess. That the
Church swallowed the money is an assumption, but one perhaps
justified by the history of the Church.</p>

'the lines', in the first place, must be cheaper. But it would be
interesting to know what meaning we are to attach to the word
'weaker' in the context. For since Dr Alington is a former Head
Master of Eton he must be aware that his sex has not only acquired
but retained the vast revenues of that ancient foundation&mdash;a
proof, one would have thought, not of sexual weakness but of sexual
strength. That Eton is not 'weak', at least from the material point
of view, is shown by the following quotation from Dr Alington:
'Following out the suggestion of one of the Prime Minister's
Committees on Education, the Provost and Fellows in my time decided
that all scholarships at Eton should be of a fixed value, capable
of being liberally augmented in case of need. So liberal has been
this augmentation that there are several boys in College whose
parents pay nothing towards either their board or education.' One
of the benefactors was the late Lord Rosebery. 'He was a generous
benefactor to the school,' Dr Alington informs us, 'and endowed a
history scholarship, in connection with which a characteristic
episode occurred. He asked me whether the endowment was adequate
and I suggested that a further &pound;200 would provide for the
payment to the examiner. He sent a cheque for &pound;2,000: his
attention was called to the discrepancy, and I have in my scrap
book the reply in which he said that he thought a good round sum
would be better than a fraction.' (op. cit., pp. 163, 186.) The
entire sum spent at Cheltenham College for Girls in 1854 upon
salaries and visiting teachers was &pound;1,300; 'and the accounts
in December showed a deficit of &pound;400.' (<i>Dorothea Beale of
Cheltenham,</i> by Elizabeth Raikes, p. 91.)</p>

<p><a name="130" id="130">30.</a> The words 'vain and vicious'
require qualification. No one would maintain that all lecturers and
all lectures are 'vain and vicious'; many subjects can only be
taught with diagrams and personal demonstration. The words in the
text refer only to the sons and daughters of educated men who
lecture their brothers and sisters upon English literature; and for
the reasons that it is an obsolete practice dating from the Middle
Ages when books were scarce; that it owes its survival to pecuniary
motives; or to curiosity; that the publication in book form is
sufficient proof of the evil effect of an audience upon the
lecturer intellectually; and that psychologically eminence upon a
platform encourages vanity and the desire to impose authority.
Further, the reduction of English literature to an examination
subject must be viewed with suspicion by all who have firsthand
knowledge of the difficulty of the art, and therefore of the very
superficial value of an examiner's approval or disapproval; and
with profound regret by all who wish to keep one art at least out
of the hands of middlemen and free, as long as may be, from all
association with competition and money making. Again, the violence
with which one school of literature is now opposed to another, the
rapidity with which one school of taste succeeds another, may not
unreasonably be traced to the power which a mature mind lecturing
immature minds has to infect them with strong, if passing,
opinions, and to tinge those opinions with personal bias. Nor can
it be maintained that the standard of critical or of creative
writing has been raised. A lamentable proof of the mental docility
to which the young are reduced by lecturers is that the demand for
lectures upon English literature steadily increases (as every
writer can bear witness) and from the very class which should have
learnt to read at home&mdash;the educated. If, as is sometimes
urged in excuse, what is desired by college literary societies is
not knowledge of literature but acquaintance with writers, there
are cocktails, and there is sherry; both better unmixed with
Proust. None of this applies of course to those whose homes are
deficient in books. If the working class finds it easier to
assimilate English literature by word of mouth they have a perfect
right to ask the educated class to help them thus. But for the sons
and daughters of that class after the age of eighteen to continue
to sip English literature through a straw, is a habit that seems to
deserve the terms vain and vicious; which terms can justly be
applied with greater force to those who pander to them.</p>

<p><a name="131" id="131">31.</a> It is difficult to procure exact
figures of the sums allowed the daughters of educated men before
marriage. Sophia Jex-Blake had an allowance of from &pound;30 to
&pound;40 annually; her father was an upper-middle-class man. Lady
Lascelles, whose father was an Earl, had, it seems, an allowance of
about &pound;100 in 1860; Mr Barrett, a rich merchant, allowed his
daughter Elizabeth 'from forty to forty-five pounds . . . every
three months, the income tax being first deducted'. But this seems
to have been the interest upon &pound;8,000, 'or more or less . . .
it is difficult to ask about it,' which she had 'in the funds',
'the money being in two different per cents', and apparently,
though belonging to Elizabeth, under Mr Barrett's control. But
these were unmarried women. Married women were not allowed to own
property until the passing of the Married Woman's Property Act in
1870. Lady St Helier records that since her marriage settlements
had been drawn up in conformity with the old law, 'What money I had
was settled on my husband, and no part of it was reserved for my
private use . . . I did not even possess a cheque book, nor was I
able to get any money except by asking my husband. He was kind and
generous but he acquiesced in the position then existing that a
woman's property belonged to her husband . . . he paid all my
bills, he kept my bank book, and gave me a small allowance for my
personal expenses.' (<i>Memories of Fifty Years,</i> by Lady St
Helier, p. 341.) But she does not say what the exact sum was. The
sums allowed to the sons of educated men were considerably larger.
An allowance of &pound;200 was considered to be only just
sufficient for an undergraduate at Balliol, 'which still had
traditions of frugality', about 1880. On that allowance 'they could
not hunt and they could not gamble . . . But with care, and with a
home to fall back on in the vacations, they could make this do.'
(<i>Anthony Hope and His Books,</i> by Sir C. Mallet, p. 38.) The
sum that is now needed is considerably more. Gino Watkins 'never
spent more than the &pound;400 yearly allowance with which he paid
all his college and vacation bills'. (<i>Gino Watkins,</i> by J. M.
Scott, p. 59.) This was at Cambridge, a few years ago.</p>

<p><a name="132" id="132">32.</a> How incessantly women were
ridiculed throughout the nineteenth century for attempting to enter
their solitary profession, novel readers know, for those efforts
provide half the stock-in-trade of fiction. But biography shows how
natural it was, even in the present century, for the most
enlightened of men to conceive of all women as spinsters, all
desiring marriage. Thus: '"Oh dear, what is to happen to them?" he
[G. L. Dickinson] once murmured sadly as a stream of aspiring but
uninspiring spinsters flowed round the front court of King's; "I
don't know and they don't know." And then in still lower tones as
if his bookshelves might overhear him, "Oh dear! What they want is
a husband!'" (<i>Goldsworthy Lowes Dickinson,</i> by E. M. Forster,
p. 106.) 'What they wanted' might have been the Bar, the Stock
Exchange or rooms in Gibbs's Buildings, had the choice been open to
them. But it was not; and therefore Mr Dickinson's remark was a
very natural one.</p>

<p><a name="133" id="133">33.</a> 'Now and then, at least in the
larger houses, there would be a set party, selected and invited
long beforehand, and over these always one idol dominated&mdash;the
pheasant. Shooting had to be used as a lure. At such times the
father of the family was apt to assert himself. If his house was to
be filled to bursting, his wines drunk in quantities, and his best
shooting provided, then for that shooting he would have the best
guns possible. What despair for the mother of daughters to be told
that the one guest whom of all others she secretly desired to
invite was a bad shot and totally inadmissible!' ('Society and the
Season,' by Mary, Countess of Lovelace, in <i>Fifty Years,
1882-1932</i>, p. 29.)</p>

<p><a name="134" id="134">34.</a> Some idea of what men hoped that
their wives might say and do, at least in the nineteenth century,
may be gathered from the following hints in a letter 'addressed to
a young lady for whom he had a great regard a short time before her
marriage' by John Bowdler. 'Above all, avoid everything which has
the <i>least tendency</i> to indelicacy or indecorum. Few women
have any <i>idea</i> how much men are disgusted at the slightest
approach to these in any female, and especially in one to whom they
are attached. By attending the nursery, or the sick bed, women are
too apt to acquire a habit of conversing on such subjects in
language which men of delicacy are shocked at.' (<i>Life of John
Bowdler,</i> p. 123.) But though delicacy was essential, it could,
after marriage, be disguised. 'In the 'seventies of last century,
Miss Jex-Blake and her associates were vigorously fighting the
battle for admission of women to the medical profession, and the
doctors were still more vigorously resisting their entry, alleging
that it must be improper and demoralizing for a woman to have to
study and deal with delicate and intimate medical questions. At
that time Ernest Hart, the Editor of the <i>British Medical
Journal,</i> told me that the majority of the contributions sent to
him for publication in the <i>Journal</i> dealing with delicate and
intimate medical questions were in the handwriting of the doctors'
wives, to whom they had obviously been dictated. There were no
typewriters or stenographers available in those days.' (<i>The
Doctor's Second Thoughts,</i> by Sir J. Crichton-Browne, pp. 73,
74.)</p>

<p>The duplicity of delicacy was observed long before this,
however. Thus Mandeville in <i>The Fable of the Bees</i> (1714)
says: '. . . I would have it first consider'd that the Modesty of
Woman is the result of Custom and Education, by which all
unfashionable Denudations and filthy Expressions are render'd
frightful and abominable to them, and that notwithstanding this,
the most Virtuous Young Woman alive will often, in spite of her
Teeth, have Thoughts and confus'd Ideas of Things arise in her
Imagination, which she would not reveal to some People for a
Thousand Worlds.'</p>

admirably outspoken opinion, and if all who share Mr Joad's
sentiments were to express them as openly, the hostess's
dilemma&mdash;whom to ask, whom not to ask&mdash;would be lightened
and her labour saved. If those who prefer the society of their own
sex at table would signify the fact, the men, say, by wearing a
red, the women by wearing a white rosette, while those who prefer
the sexes mixed wore parti-coloured buttonholes of red and white
blended, not only would much inconvenience and misunderstanding be
prevented, but it is possible that the honesty of the buttonhole
would kill a certain form of social hypocrisy now all too
prevalent. Meanwhile, Mr Joad's candour deserves the highest
praise, and his wishes the most implicit observance.</p>

<p><a name="205" id="205">5.</a> According to Mrs H. M. Swanwick,
the W.S.P.U. had 'an income from gifts, in the year 1912, of
&pound;42,000.' (<i>I Have Been Young,</i> by H. M. Swanwick, p.
189.) The total spent in 1912 by the Women's Freedom League was
&pound;26,772 12s. 9d. (<i>The Cause,</i> by Ray Strachey, p. 311.)
Thus the joint income of the two societies was &pound;68,772 12s.
9d. But the two societies were, of course, opposed.</p>

<p><a name="206" id="206">6.</a> 'But, exceptions apart, the

Strachey, p. 70.) Nevertheless 'The numbers of women doing
professional work have increased very fast in the last twenty
years, and were about 400,000 in 1931, in addition to those doing
secretarial work or employed in the Civil Service.' (op. cit, p.

<p>Professor Ernest Barker suggests that there should be an
alternative Civil Service Examination for 'men and women of an
older growth' who have spent some years in social work and social
service. 'Women candidates in particular might benefit. It is only
a very small proportion of women students who succeed in the
present open competition: indeed very few compete. On the
alternative system here suggested it is possible, and indeed
probable, that a much larger proportion of women would be
candidates. Women have a genius and a capacity for social work and
service. The alternative form of competition would give them a
chance of showing that genius and that capacity. It might give them
a new incentive to compete for entry into the administrative
service of the state, in which their gifts and their presence are
needed.' (<i>The British Civil Servant.</i> 'The Home Civil
Service,' by Professor Ernest Barker, p. 41.) But while the home
service remains as exacting as it is at present, it is difficult to
see how an incentive can make women free to give 'their gifts and
their presence' to the service of the state, unless the state will
undertake the care of elderly parents; or make it a penal offence
for elderly people of either sex to require the services of
daughters at home.</p>

<p><a name="210" id="210">10.</a> The effect of a woman in the
pulpit is thus defined in <i>Women and the Ministry, Some
Considerations on the Report of the Archbishops' Commission on the
Ministry of Women</i> (1936), p. 24. 'But we maintain that the
ministration of women . . . will tend to produce a lowering of the
spiritual tone of Christian worship, such as is not produced by the
ministrations of men before congregations largely or exclusively
female. It is a tribute to the quality of Christian womanhood that
it is possible to make this statement; but it would appear to be a
simple matter of fact that in the thoughts and desires of that sex
the natural is more easily made subordinate to the supernatural,
the carnal to the spiritual than is the case with men; and that the
ministrations of a male priesthood do not normally arouse that side
of female human nature which should be quiescent during the times
of the adoration of almighty God. We believe, on the other hand,
that it would be impossible for the male members of the average
Anglican congregation to be present at a service at which a woman
ministered without becoming unduly conscious of her sex.'</p>

<p>In the opinion of the Commissioners, therefore, Christian women
are more spiritually minded than Christian men&mdash;a remarkable,
but no doubt adequate, reason for excluding them from the
priesthood.</p>

<p><a name="214" id="214">14.</a> 'There are, so far as I know, no
universal rules on this subject [i.e. sexual relations between
civil servants]; but civil servants and municipal officers of both
sexes are certainly expected to observe the conventional
proprieties and to avoid conduct which might find its way into the
newspapers and there be described as "scandalous". Until recently
sexual relations between men and women officers of the Post Office
were punishable with immediate dismissal of both parties . . . The
problem of avoiding newspaper publicity is a fairly easy one to
solve so far as court proceedings are concerned: but official
restriction extends further so as to prevent women civil servants
(who usually have to resign on marriage) from cohabiting openly
with men if they desire to do so. The matter, therefore, takes on a
different complexion.' (<i>The British Civil Servant. The Public
Service,</i> by William A. Robson, pp. 14, 15.)</p>

<p><a name="215" id="215">15.</a> Most men's clubs confine women to
a special room, or annexe, and exclude them from other apartments,
whether on the principle observed at St Sofia that they are impure,
or whether on the principle observed at Pompeii that they are too
pure, is matter for speculation.</p>

<p><a name="216" id="216">16.</a> The power of the Press to burke
discussion of any undesirable subject was, and still is, very
formidable. It was one of the 'extraordinary obstacles' against
which Josephine Butler had to fight in her campaign against the
Contagious Diseases Act. 'Early in 1870 the London Press began to
adopt that policy of silence with regard to the question, which
lasted for many years, and called forth from the Ladies'
Association the famous "Remonstrance against the Conspiracy of
Silence", signed by Harriet Martineau and Josephine E. Butler,
which concluded with the following words: "Surely, while such a
conspiracy of silence is possible and practised among leading
journalists, we English greatly exaggerate our privileges as a free
people when we profess to encourage a free press, and to possess
the right to hear both sides in a momentous question of morality
and legislation."' (<i>Personal Reminiscences of a Great
Crusade,</i> by Josephine E. Butler, p. 49.) Again, during the
battle for the vote the Press used the boycott with great effect.
And so recently as July 1937 Miss Philippa Strachey in a letter
headed 'A Conspiracy of Silence', printed (to its honour) by the
<i>Spectator</i> almost repeats Mrs Butler's words: 'Many hundreds
and thousands of men and women have been participating in an
endeavour to induce the Government to abandon the provision in the
new Contributory Pensions Bill for the black-coated workers which
for the first time introduces a differential income limit for men
and women entrants . . . In the course of the last month the Bill
has been before the House of Lords, where this particular provision
has met with strong and determined opposition from all sides of the
Chamber . . . These are events one would have supposed to be of
sufficient interest to be recorded in the daily Press. But they
have been passed over in complete silence by the newspapers from
<i>The Times</i> to the <i>Daily Herald . . .</i> The differential
treatment of women under this Bill has aroused a feeling of
resentment among them such as has not been witnessed since the
granting of the franchise . . . How is one to account for this
being completely concealed by the Press?'</p>

<p><a name="217" id="217">17.</a> Flesh wounds were of course
inflicted during the battle of Westminster. Indeed the fight for
the vote seems to have been more severe than is now recognized.
Thus Flora Drummond says: 'Whether we won the vote by our
agitation, as I believe, or whether we got it for other reasons, as
some people say, I think many of the younger generation will find
it hard to believe the fury and brutality aroused by our claim for
votes for women less than thirty years ago.' (Flora Drummond in the
<i>Listener,</i> 25 August 1937.) The younger generation is
presumably so used to the fury and brutality that claims for
liberty arouse that they have no emotion available for this
particular instance. Moreover, that particular fight has not yet
taken its place among the fights which have made England the home,
and Englishmen the champions of, liberty. The fight for the vote is
still generally referred to in terms of sour deprecation: '. . .
and the women . . . had not begun that campaign of burning,
whipping, and picture-slashing which was finally to prove to both
Front Benches their eligibility for the Franchise.' (<i>Reflections
and Memories,</i> by Sir John Squire, p. 10.) The younger
generation therefore can be excused if they believe that there was
nothing heroic about a campaign in which only a few windows were
smashed, shins broken, and Sargent's portrait of Henry James
damaged, but not irreparably, with a knife. Burning, whipping and
picture-slashing only it would seem become heroic when carried out
on a large scale by men with machine-guns.</p>

written of the achievements and accomplishments of Sir Stanley
Baldwin during his Premierships and too much would be impossible.
Might I be permitted to call attention to what Lady Baldwin has
done? When I first joined the committee of this hospital in 1929,
analgesics (pain deadeners) for normal maternity cases in the wards
were almost unknown, now their use is ordinary routine and they are
availed of in practically 100 per cent of cases, and what is true
of this hospital is true virtually for all similar hospitals. This
remarkable change in so short a time is due to the inspiration and
the tireless efforts and encouragement of Mrs Stanley Baldwin, as
she then was . . .' (Letter to <i>The Times</i> from C. S.
Wentworth Stanley, Chairman House Committee, the City of London
Maternity Hospital, 1937.) Since chloroform was first administered
to Queen Victoria on the birth of Prince Leopold in April 1853
'normal maternity cases in the wards' have had to wait for
seventy-six years and the advocacy of a Prime Minister's wife to
obtain this relief.</p>

<p><a name="220" id="220">20.</a> According to <i>Debrett</i> the
Knights and Dames of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire
wear a badge consisting of 'a cross patonce, enamelled pearl,
fimbriated or, surmounted by a gold medallion with a representation
of Britannia seated within a circle gules inscribed with the motto
"For God and the Empire". This is one of the few orders open to
women, but their subordination is properly marked by the fact that
the ribbon in their case is only two inches and one quarter in
breadth; whereas the ribbon of the Knights is three inches and
three quarters in breadth. The stars also differ in size. The
motto, however, is the same for both sexes, and must be held to
imply that those who thus ticket themselves see some connection
between the Deity and the Empire, and hold themselves prepared to
defend them. What happens if Britannia seated within a circle gules
is opposed (as is conceivable) to the other authority whose seat is
not specified on the medallion, <i>Debrett</i> does not say, and
the Knights and Dames must themselves decide.</p>

<p><a name="236" id="236">36.</a> The maid played so important a
part in English upper-class life from the earliest times until the
year 1914, when the Hon. Monica Grenfell went to nurse wounded
soldiers accompanied by a maid [<i>Bright Armour</i>, by Monica
Salmond, p. 20], that some recognition of her services seems to be
called for. Her duties were peculiar. Thus she had to escort her
mistress down Piccadilly 'where a few club men might have looked at
her out of a window,' but was unnecessary in Whitechapel, 'where
malefactors were possibly lurking round every corner.' But her
office was undoubtedly arduous. Wilson's part in Elizabeth
Barrett's private life is well known to readers of the famous
letters. Later in the century (about 1889-92) Gertrude Bell 'went
with Lizzie, her maid, to picture exhibitions; she was fetched by
Lizzie from dinner parties; she went with Lizzie to see the
Settlement in Whitechapel where Mary Talbot was working . . .'
(<i>Early Letters of Gertrude Bell,</i> edited by Lady Richmond.)
We have only to consider the hours she waited in cloak rooms, the
acres she toiled in picture galleries, the miles she trudged along
West End pavements to conclude that if Lizzie's day is now almost
over, it was in its day a long one. Let us hope that the thought
that she was putting into practice the commands laid down by St
Paul in his Letters to Titus and the Corinthians, was a support;
and the knowledge that she was doing her utmost to deliver her
mistress's body intact to her master a solace. Even so in the
weakness of the flesh and in the darkness of the beetle-haunted
basement she must sometimes have bitterly reproached St Paul on the
one hand for his chastity, and the gentlemen of Piccadilly on the
other for their lust. It is much to be regretted that no lives of
maids, from which a more fully documented account could be
constructed, are to be found in the <i>Dictionary of</i>

<p><a name="238" id="238">38.</a> The question of chastity, both of
mind and body, is of the greatest interest and complexity. The
Victorian, Edwardian and much of the Fifth Georgian conception of
chastity was based, to go no further back, upon the words of St
Paul. To understand their meaning we should have to understand his
psychology and environment&mdash;no light task in view of his
frequent obscurity and the lack of biographical material. From
internal evidence, it seems clear that he was a poet and a prophet,
but lacked logical power, and was without that psychological
training which forces even the least poetic or prophetic nowadays
to subject their personal emotions to scrutiny. Thus his famous
pronouncement on the matter of veils, upon which the theory of
women's chastity seems to be based, is susceptible to criticism
from several angles. In the Letter to the Corinthians his argument
that a woman must be veiled when she prays or prophesies is based
upon the assumption that to be unveiled 'is one and the same thing
as if she were shaven.' That assumption granted, we must ask next:
What shame is there in being shaven? Instead of replying, St Paul
proceeds to assert, 'For a man indeed ought not to have his head
veiled, forasmuch as he is the image and glory of God': from which
it appears that it is not being shaven in itself that is wrong; but
to be a woman and to be shaven. It is wrong, it appears, for the
woman because 'the woman is the glory of the man.' If St Paul had
said openly that he liked the look of women's long hair many of us
would have agreed with him, and thought the better of him for
saying so. But other reasons appeared to him preferable, as appears
from his next remark: 'For the man is not of the woman; but the
woman of the man; for neither was the man created for the woman;
but the woman for the man: for this cause ought the woman to have a
sign of authority on her head, because of the angels.' What view
the angels took of long hair we have no means of knowing; and St
Paul himself seems to have been doubtful of their support or he
would not think it necessary to drag in the familiar accomplice
nature. 'Doth not even nature itself teach you, that, if a man have
long hair, it is a dishonour to him? But if a woman have long hair,
it is a glory to her: for her hair is given her for a covering. But
if any man seemeth to be contentious, we have no such custom,
neither the churches of God.' The argument from nature may seem to
us susceptible of amendment; nature, when allied with financial
advantage, is seldom of divine origin; but if the basis of the
argument is shifty, the conclusion is firm. 'Let the women keep
silence in the churches: for it is not permitted unto them to
speak; but let them be in subjection, as also saith the law.'
Having thus invoked the familiar but always suspect trinity of
accomplices, Angels, nature and law, to support his personal
opinion, St Paul reaches the conclusion which has been looming
unmistakably ahead of us: 'And if they would learn anything, let
them ask their own husbands at home: for it is shameful for a woman
to speak in the church.' The nature of that 'shame', which is
closely connected with chastity has, as the letter proceeds, been
considerably alloyed. For it is obviously compounded of certain
sexual and personal prejudices. St Paul, it is obvious, was not
only a bachelor (for his relations with Lydia see Renan,
<i>Saint</i> <i>Paul,</i> p. 149. 'Est-il cependant absolument
impossible que Paul ait contract&eacute; avec cette soeur une union
plus intime? On ne saurait l'affirmer'); and, like many bachelors,
suspicious of the other sex; but a poet and like many poets
preferred to prophesy himself rather than to listen to the
prophecies of others. Also he was of the virile or dominant type,
so familiar at present in Germany, for whose gratification a
subject race or sex is essential. Chastity then as defined by St
Paul is seen to be a complex conception, based upon the love of
long hair; the love of subjection; the love of an audience; the
love of laying down the law, and, subconsciously, upon a very
strong and natural desire that the woman's mind and body shall be
reserved for the use of one man and one only. Such a conception
when supported by the Angels, nature, law, custom and the Church,
and enforced by a sex with a strong personal interest to enforce
it, and the economic means, was of undoubted power. The grip of its
white if skeleton fingers can be found upon whatever page of
history we open from St Paul to Gertrude Bell. Chastity was invoked
to prevent her from studying medicine; from painting from the nude;
from reading Shakespeare; from playing in orchestras; from walking
down Bond Street alone. In 1848 it was 'an unpardonable solecism'
for the daughters of a gardener to drive down Regent Street in a
hansom cab (<i>Paxton and the Bachelor Duke,</i> by Violet Markham,
p. 288); that solecism became a crime, of what magnitude
theologians must decide, if the flaps were left open. In the
beginning of the present century the daughter of an ironmaster (for
let us not flout distinctions said today to be of prime
importance), Sir Hugh Bell, had 'reached the age of 27 and married
without ever having walked alone down Piccadilly . . . Gertrude, of
course, would never have dreamt of doing that . . .' The West End
was the contaminated area. 'It was one's own class that was taboo;
. . .' (<i>The Earlier Letters of Gertrude Bell,</i> collected and
edited by Elsa Richmond, pp. 217-18.) But the complexities and
inconsistencies of chastity were such that the same girl who had to
be veiled, i.e. accompanied by a male or a maid, in Piccadilly,
could visit Whitechapel, or Seven Dials, then haunts of vice and
disease, alone and with her parents' approval. This anomaly did not
altogether escape comment. Thus Charles Kingsley as a boy
exclaimed: '. . . and the girls have their heads crammed full of
schools, and district visiting, and baby linen, and penny clubs.
Confound!!! and going about among the most abominable scenes of
filth and wretchedness, and indecency to visit the poor and read
the Bible to them. My own mother says that the places they go into
are fit for no girl to see, and that they should not know such
things exist.' (<i>Charles Kingsley,</i> by Margaret Farrand Thorp,
p. 12.) Mrs Kingsley, however, was exceptional. Most of the
daughters of educated men saw such 'abominable scenes', and knew
that such things existed. That they concealed their knowledge, is
probable; what effect that concealment had psychologically it is
impossible here to inquire. But that chastity, whether real or
imposed, was an immense power, whether good or bad, it is
impossible to doubt. Even today it is probable that a woman has to
fight a psychological battle of some severity with the ghost of St
Paul, before she can have intercourse with a man other than her
husband. Not only was the social stigma strongly exerted on behalf
of chastity, but the Bastardy Act did its utmost to impose chastity
by financial pressure. Until women had the vote in 1918, 'the
Bastardy Act of 1872 fixed the sum of 5s. a week as the maximum
which a father, whatever his wealth, could be made to pay towards
the maintenance of his child.' (<i>Josephine Butler,</i> by M. G.
Fawcett and E. M. Turner, note, p. 101.) Now that St Paul and many
of his apostles have been unveiled themselves by modern science
chastity has undergone considerable revision. Yet there is said to
be a reaction in favour of some degree of chastity for both sexes.
This is partly due to economic causes; the protection of chastity
by maids is an expensive item in the bourgeois budget. The
psychological argument in favour of chastity is well expressed by
Mr Upton Sinclair: 'Nowadays we hear a great deal about mental
troubles caused by sex repression; it is the mood of the moment. We
do not hear anything about the complexes which may be caused by sex
indulgence. But my observation has been that those who permit
themselves to follow every sexual impulse are quite as miserable as
those who repress every sexual impulse. I remember a class-mate in
College; I said to him: "Did it ever occur to you to stop and look
at your own mind? Everything that comes to you is turned into sex."
He looked surprised, and I saw that it was a new idea to him; he
thought it over, and said: "I guess you are right."' (<i>Candid
Reminiscences,</i> by Upton Sinclair, p. 63.) Further illustration
is supplied by the following anecdote: 'In the splendid library of
Columbia University were treasures of beauty, costly volumes of
engravings, and in my usual greedy fashion I went at these,
intending to learn all there was to know about Renaissance art in a
week or two. But I found myself overwhelmed by this mass of
nakedness; my senses reeled, and I had to quit.' (op. cit., pp.
62-3.)</p>

<p><a name="239" id="239">39.</a> The translation here used is by
Sir Richard Jebb <i>(Sophocles, the Plays and Fragments,</i> with
critical notes, commentary and translation, in English prose). It
is impossible to judge any book from a translation, yet even when
thus read <i>The Antigone</i> is clearly one of the great
masterpieces of dramatic literature. Nevertheless, it could
undoubtedly be made, if necessary, into anti-Fascist propaganda.
Antigone herself could be transformed either into Mrs Pankhurst,
who broke a window and was imprisoned in Holloway; or into Frau
Pommer, the wife of a Prussian mines official at Essen, who said:
'"The thorn of hatred has been driven deep enough into the people
by the religious conflicts, and it is high time that the men of
today disappeared." . . . She has been arrested and is to be tried
on a charge of insulting and slandering the State and the Nazi
movement.' (<i>The Times,</i> 12 August 1935.) Antigone's crime was
of much the same nature and was punished in much the same way. Her
words, 'See what I suffer, and from whom, because I feared to cast
away the fear of heaven! . . . And what law of heaven have I
transgressed? Why, hapless one, should I look to the gods any
more&mdash;what ally should I invoke&mdash;when by piety I have
earned the name of impious?' could be spoken either by Mrs
Pankhurst, or by Frau Pommer; and are certainly topical. Creon,
again, who 'thrust the children of the sunlight to the shades, and
ruthlessly lodged a living soul in the grave'; who held that
'disobedience is the worst of evils', and that 'whomsoever the city
may appoint, that man must be obeyed, in little things and great,
in just things and unjust' is typical of certain politicians in the
past, and of Herr Hitler and Signor Mussolini in the present. But
though it is easy to squeeze these characters into up-to-date
dress, it is impossible to keep them there. They suggest too much;
when the curtain falls we sympathize, it may be noted, even with
Creon himself. This result, to the propagandist undesirable, would
seem to be due to the fact that Sophocles (even in a translation)
uses freely all the faculties that can be possessed by a writer;
and suggests, therefore, that if we use art to propagate political
opinions, we must force the artist to clip and cabin his gift to do
us a cheap and passing service. Literature will suffer the same
mutilation that the mule has suffered; and there will be no more
horses.</p>

<p><a name="240" id="240">40.</a> The five words of Antigone are:

height="27" width="343"> 'Tis not my nature to join in hating, but
in loving. <i>(Antigone,</i> line 523, Jebb.) To which Creon
replied: 'Pass, then, to the world of the dead, and, if thou must
needs love, love them. While I live, no woman shall rule me.'</p>

<p><a name="241" id="241">41.</a> Even at a time of great political
stress like the present it is remarkable how much criticism is
still bestowed upon women. The announcement, 'A shrewd, witty and
provocative study of modern woman', appears on an average three
times yearly in publishers' lists. The author, often a doctor of
letters, is invariably of the male sex; and 'to mere man', as the
blurb puts it (see <i>Times Lit. Sup., 12</i> March 1938), 'this
book will be an eye-opener.'</p>

<h2><a name="ch6" id="ch6"></a>Notes and references: Three</h2>

<p><a name="301" id="301">1.</a> It is to be hoped that some
methodical person has made a collection of the various manifestos
and questionnaires issued broadcast during the years 1936-7.
Private people of no political training were invited to sign
appeals asking their own and foreign governments to change their
policy; artists were asked to fill up forms stating the proper
relations of the artist to the State, to religion, to morality;
pledges were required that the writer should use English
grammatically and avoid vulgar expressions; and dreamers were
invited to analyse their dreams. By way of inducement it was
generally proposed to publish the results in the daily or weekly
Press. What effect this inquisition has had upon governments it is
for the politician to say. Upon literature, since the output of
books is unstaunched, and grammar would seem to be neither better
nor worse, the effect is problematical. But the inquisition is of
great psychological and social interest. Presumably it originated
in the state of mind suggested by Dean Inge (The Rickman Godlee
Lecture, reported in <i>The Times,</i> 23 November 1937), 'whether
in our own interests we were moving in the right direction. If we
went on as we were doing now, would the man of the future be
superior to us or not? . . . Thoughtful people were beginning to
realize that before congratulating ourselves on moving fast we
ought to have some idea where we were moving to': a general
self-dissatisfaction and desire 'to live differently'. It also
points, indirectly, to the death of the Siren, that much ridiculed
and often upper-class lady who by keeping open house for the
aristocracy, plutocracy, intelligentsia, ignorantsia, etc., tried
to provide all classes with a talking-ground or scratching-post
where they could rub up minds, manners, and morals more privately,
and perhaps as usefully. The part that the Siren played in
promoting culture and intellectual liberty in the eighteenth
century is held by historians to be of some importance. Even in our
own day she had her uses. Witness W. B. Yeats&mdash;'How often I
have wished that he [Synge] might live long enough to enjoy that
communion with idle, charming, cultivated women which Balzac in one
of his dedications calls "the chief consolation of genius"!'
(<i>Dramatis Personae,</i> W. B. Yeats, p. 127.) Lady St Helier
who, as Lady Jeune, preserved the eighteenth-century tradition,
informs us, however, that 'Plovers' eggs at 2s. 6d. apiece, forced
strawberries, early asparagus, <i>petits poussins . . .</i> are now
considered almost a necessity by anyone aspiring to give a good
dinner' (1909); and her remark that the reception day was 'very
fatiguing . . . how exhausted I felt when half-past seven came, and
how gladly at eight o'clock I sat down to a peaceful
<i>t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te</i> dinner with my husband!'
(<i>Memories of Fifty Years,</i> by Lady St Helier, pp. 3, 5, 182)
may explain why such houses are shut, why such hostesses are dead,
and why therefore the intelligentsia, the ignorantsia, the
aristocracy, the bureaucracy, the bourgeoisie, etc., are driven
(unless somebody will revive that society on an economic basis) to
do their talking in public. But in view of the multitude of
manifestos and questionnaires now in circulation it would be
foolish to suggest another into the minds and motives of the
Inquisitors.</p>

<p><a name="302" id="302">2.</a> 'He did begin however on 13 May
(1844) to lecture weekly at Queen's College which Maurice and other
professors at King's had established a year before, primarily for
the examination and training of governesses. Kingsley was ready to
share in this unpopular task because he believed in the higher
education of women.' (<i>Charles Kingsley,</i> by Margaret Farrand
Thorp, p. 65.)</p>

<p><a name="303" id="303">3.</a> The French, as the above quotation
shows, are as active as the English in issuing manifestos. That the
French, who refuse to allow the women of France to vote, and still
inflict upon them laws whose almost medieval severity can be
studied in <i>The Position of Women in Contemporary France,</i> by
Frances Clark, should appeal to English women to help them to
protect liberty and culture must cause surprise.</p>

<p><a name="304" id="304">4.</a> Strict accuracy, here slightly in
conflict with rhythm and euphony, requires the word 'port'. A
photograph in the daily Press of 'Dons in a Senior Common Room
after dinner' (1937) showed 'a railed trolley in which the port
decanter travels across a gap between diners at the fireplace, and
thus continues its round without passing against the sun'. Another
picture shows the 'sconce' cup in use. 'This old Oxford custom
ordains that mention of certain subjects in Hall shall be punished
by the offender drinking three pints of beer at one draught . . .'
Such examples are by themselves enough to prove how impossible it
is for a woman's pen to describe life at a man's college without
committing some unpardonable solecism. But the gentlemen whose
customs are often, it is to be feared, travestied, will extend
their indulgence when they reflect that the female novelist,
however reverent in intention, works under grave physical
drawbacks. Should she wish, for example, to describe a Feast at
Trinity, Cambridge, she has to 'listen through the peephole in the
room of Mrs Butler (the Master's wife) to the speeches taking place
at the Feast which was held in Trinity College'. Miss Haldane's
observation was made in 1907, when she reflected that 'The whole
surroundings seemed medieval.' (<i>From</i> <i>One Century to
Another,</i> by E. Haldane, p. 235.)</p>

<p><a name="305" id="305">5.</a> According to Whitaker there is a
Royal Society of Literature and also the British Academy, both
presumably, since they have offices and officers, official bodies,
but what their powers are it is impossible to say, since if
Whitaker had not vouched for their existence it would scarcely have
been suspected.</p>

<p><a name="306" id="306">6.</a> Women were apparently excluded
from the British Museum Reading-Room in the eighteenth century.
Thus: <i>'Miss</i> <i>Chudleigh</i> solicits permission to be
received into the reading-room. The only female student who as yet
has honoured us was <i>Mrs</i> <i>Macaulay;</i> and your Lordship
may recollect what an untoward event offended her delicacy.'
(Daniel Wray to Lord Harwicke, 22 October 1768. Nichols,
<i>Literary Anecdotes of the Eighteenth Century,</i> vol. I, p.
137.) The editor adds in a footnote: 'This alludes to the
indelicacy of a gentleman there, in <i>Mrs Macaulay's</i> presence;
of which the particulars will not bear to be repeated.'</p>

<p><a name="309" id="309">9.</a> Mr Littlewood, until recently
dramatic critic of the Morning Post, described the condition of
Journalism at Present at a dinner given in his honour, 6 December
1937. Mr Littlewood said: 'that he had in season and out of season
fought for more space for the theatre in the columns of the London
daily papers. It was Fleet Street where, between eleven and
half-past twelve, not to mention before and after, thousands of
beautiful words and thoughts were systematically massacred. It had
been his lot for at least two out of his four decades to return to
that shambles every night with the sure and certain prospect of
being told that the paper was already full with important news, and
that there was no room for any sanguinary stuff about the theatre.
It had been his luck to wake up the next morning to find himself
answerable for the mangled remains of what was once a good notice .
. . It was not the fault of the men in the office. Some of them put
the blue pencil through with tears in their eyes. The real culprit
was that huge public who knew nothing about the theatre and could
not be expected to care.' <i>The Times,</i> 6 December 1937.</p>

<p>Mr Douglas Jerrold describes the treatment of politics in the
Press. 'In those few brief years [between 1928-33] truth had fled
from Fleet Street. You could never tell all the truth all the time.
You never will be able to do so. But you used at least to be able
to tell the truth about other countries. By 1933, you did it at
your peril. In 1928 there was no direct political pressure from
advertisers. Today it is not only direct but effective.'</p>

<p>Literary criticism would seem to be in much the same case and
for the same reason: 'There are no critics in whom the public have
any more confidence. They trust, if at all, to the different Book
Societies, and the selections of individual newspapers, and on the
whole they are wise . . . The Book Society are frankly book
sellers, and the great national newspapers cannot afford to puzzle
their readers. They must all choose books which have, at the
prevailing level of public taste, a potentially large sale.'
(<i>Georgian Adventure,</i> by Douglas Jerrold, pp. 282, 283,
298.)</p>

<p><a name="310" id="310">10.</a> While it is obvious that under
the conditions of journalism at present the criticism of literature
must be unsatisfactory, it is also obvious that no change can be
made, without changing the economic structure of society and the
psychological structure of the artist. Economically, it is
necessary that the reviewer should herald the publication of a new
book with his town-crier's shout 'O yez, O yez, O yez, such and
such a book has been published; its subject is this, that or the
other.' Psychologically, vanity and the desire for 'recognition'
are still so strong among artists that to starve them of
advertisement and to deny them frequent if contrasted shocks of
praise and blame would be as rash as the introduction of rabbits
into Australia: the balance of nature would be upset and the
consequences might well be disastrous. The suggestion in the text
is not to abolish public criticism; but to supplement it by a new
service based on the example of the medical profession. A panel of
critics recruited from reviewers (many of whom are potential
critics of genuine taste and learning) would practise like doctors
and in strictest privacy. Publicity removed, it follows that most
of the distractions and corruptions which inevitably make
contemporary criticism worthless to the writer would be abolished;
all inducement to praise or blame for personal reasons would be
destroyed; neither sales nor vanity would be affected; the author
could attend to criticism without considering the effect upon
public or friends; the critic could criticize without considering
the editor's blue pencil or the public taste. Since criticism is
much desired by the living, as the constant demand for it proves,
and since fresh books are as essential for the critic's mind as
fresh meat for his body, each would gain; literature even might
benefit. The advantages of the present system of public criticism
are mainly economic; the evil effects psychologically are shown by
the two famous <i>Quarterly</i> reviews of Keats and Tennyson.
Keats was deeply wounded; and 'the effect . . . upon Tennyson
himself was penetrating and prolonged. His first act was at once to
withdraw from the press <i>The Lover's Tale . . .</i> We find him
thinking of leaving England altogether, of living abroad.'
(Tennyson, by Harold Nicolson, p. 118.) The effect of Mr Churton
Collins upon Sir Edmund Gosse was much the same: 'His
self-confidence was undermined, his personality reduced . . . was
not everyone watching his struggles regarding him as doomed? . . .
His own account of his sensations was that he went about feeling
that he had been flayed alive.' (<i>The Life and Letters of Sir</i>
<i>Edmund Gosse,</i> by Evan Charteris, p. 196.)</p>

'A-ring-the-bell-and-run-away-man.' This word has been coined in
order to define those who make use of words with the desire to hurt
but at the same time to escape detection. In a transitional age
when many qualities are changing their value, new words to express
new values are much to be desired. Vanity, for example, which would
seem to lead to severe complications of cruelty and tyranny,
judging from evidence supplied abroad, is still masked by a name
with trivial associations. A supplement to the <i>Oxford English
Dictionary</i> is indicated.</p>

<p><a name="313" id="313">13.</a> In the nineteenth century much
valuable work was done for the working class by educated men's
daughters in the only way that was then open to them. But now that
some of them at least have received an expensive education, it is
arguable that they can work much more effectively by remaining in
their own class and using the methods of that class to improve a
class which stands much in need of improvement. If on the other
hand the educated (as so often happens) renounce the very qualities
which education should have bought&mdash;reason, tolerance,
knowledge&mdash;and play at belonging to the working class and
adopting its cause, they merely expose that cause to the ridicule
of the educated class, and do nothing to improve their own. But the
number of books written by the educated about the working class
would seem to show that the glamour of the working class and the
emotional relief afforded by adopting its cause, are today as
irresistible to the middle class as the glamour of the aristocracy
was twenty years ago (see <i>A</i> <i>La Recherche du Temps
Perdu</i>.) Meanwhile it would be interesting to know what the
true-born working man or woman thinks of the playboys and playgirls
of the educated class who adopt the working-class cause without
sacrificing middle-class capital, or sharing working-class
experience. 'The average housewife', according to Mrs Murphy, Home
Service Director of the British Commercial Gas Association, 'washed
an acre of dirty dishes, a mile of glass and three miles of clothes
and scrubbed five miles of floor yearly.' (<i>Daily Telegraph,</i>
29 September 1937.) For a more detailed account of working-class
life, see <i>Life as We Have Known It,</i> by Cooperative working
women, edited by Margaret Llewelyn Davies. The <i>Life of Joseph
Wright</i> also gives a remarkable account of working-class life at
first hand and not through pro-proletarian spectacles.</p>

<p><a name="314" id="314">14.</a> 'It was stated yesterday at the
War Office that the Army Council have no intention of opening
recruiting for any women's corps.' (<i>The Times,</i> 22 October

is enforced upon women. Men are still allowed liberty of
choice.</p>

<p><a name="315" id="315">15.</a> The following quotation shows,
however, that if sanctioned the fighting instinct easily develops.
'The eyes deeply sunk into the sockets, the features acute, the
amazon keeps herself very straight on the stirrups at the head of
her squadron . . . Five English parlementaries look at this woman
with the respectful and a bit restless admiration one feels for a
"fauve" of an unknown species . . .</p>

<p>&mdash;Come nearer Amalia&mdash;orders the commandant. She
pushes her horse towards us and salutes her chief with the

you born?&mdash;In Granada&mdash;Why have you joined the
army?&mdash;My two daughters were militiawomen. The younger has
been killed in the Alto de Leon. I thought I had to supersede her
and avenge her.&mdash;And how many enemies have you killed to
avenge her?&mdash;You know it, commandant, five. The sixth is not
sure.&mdash;No, but you have taken his horse. The amazon Amalia
rides in fact a magnificent dapple-grey horse, with glossy hair,
which flatters like a parade horse . . . This woman who has killed
five men&mdash;but who feels not sure about the sixth&mdash;was for
the envoys of the House of Commons an excellent introducer to the
Spanish war.' (<i>The Martyrdom of</i> <i>Madrid,</i> Inedited
Witnesses, by Louis Delapr&eacute;e, pp. 34, 5, 6. Madrid,

<p><a name="316" id="316">16.</a> By way of proof, an attempt may
be made to elucidate the reasons given by various Cabinet Ministers
in various Parliaments from about 1870 to 1918 for opposing the
Suffrage Bill. An able effort has been made by Mrs Oliver Strachey
(see chapter 'The Deceitfulness of Polities' in her <i>The
Cause).</i></p>

<p><a name="317" id="317">17.</a> 'We have had women's civil and
political status before the League only since 1935.' From reports
sent in as to the position of the woman as wife, mother and home
maker, 'the sorry fact was discovered that her economic position in
many countries (including Great Britain) was unstable. She is
entitled neither to salary nor wages and has definite duties to
perform. In England, though she may have devoted her whole life to
husband and children, her husband, no matter how wealthy, can leave
her destitute at his death and she has no legal redress. We must
alter this&mdash;by legislation (Linda P. Littlejohn, reported in
the <i>Listener,</i> 10 November 1937.)</p>

<p><a name="318" id="318">18.</a> This particular definition of
woman's task comes not from an Italian but from a German source.
There are so many versions and all are so much alike that it seems
unnecessary to verify each separately. But it is curious to find
how easy it is to cap them from English sources. Mr Gerhardi for
example writes: 'Never yet have I committed the error of looking on
women writers as serious fellow artists. I enjoy them rather as
spiritual helpers who, endowed with a sensitive capacity for
appreciation, may help the few of us afflicted with genius to bear
our cross with good grace. Their true role, therefore, is rather to
hold out the sponge to us, cool our brow, while we bleed. If their
sympathetic understanding may indeed be put to a more romantic use,
how we cherish them for it!' (<i>Memoirs</i> <i>of</i> <i>a
Polyglot,</i> by William Gerhardi, pp. 320, 321.) This conception
of woman's role tallies almost exactly with that quoted above.</p>

living by increased salaries.' (<i>The Times,</i> 28 March

<p><a name="329" id="329">29.</a> Whether or not the gift of
prophecy and the gift of poetry were originally the same, a
distinction has been made between those gifts and professions for
many centuries. But the fact that the Song of Songs, the work of a
poet, is included among the sacred books, and that propagandist
poems and novels, the works of prophets, are included among the
secular, points to some confusion. Lovers of English literature can
scarcely be too thankful that Shakespeare lived too late to be
canonized by the Church. Had the plays been ranked among the sacred
books they must have received the same treatment as the Old and New
Testaments; we should have had them doled out on Sundays from the
mouths of priests in snatches; now a soliloquy from <i>Hamlet;</i>
now a corrupt passage from the pen of some drowsy reporter; now a
bawdy song; now half a page from <i>Antony and Cleopatra,</i> as
the Old and New Testaments have been sliced up and interspersed
with hymns in the Church of England service; and Shakespeare would
have been as unreadable as the Bible. Yet those who have not been
forced from childhood to hear it thus dismembered weekly assert
that the Bible is a work of the greatest interest, much beauty, and
deep meaning.</p>

<p><a name="331" id="331">31.</a> 'At present a married priest is
able to fulfil the requirements of the ordination service, "to
forsake and set aside all worldly cares and studies", largely
because his wife can undertake the care of the household and the
family . . .' (<i>The Ministry of Women,</i> p. 32.)</p>

<p>The Commissioners are here stating and approving a principle
which is frequently stated and approved by the dictators. Herr
Hitler and Signor Mussolini have both often in very similar words
expressed the opinion that 'There are two worlds in the life of the
nation, the world of men and the world of women'; and proceeded to
much the same definition of the duties. The effect which this
division has had upon the woman; the petty and personal nature of
her interests; her absorption in the practical; her apparent
incapacity for the poetical and adventurous&mdash;all this has been
made the staple of so many novels, the target for so much satire,
has confirmed so many theorists in the theory that by the law of
nature the woman is less spiritual than the man, that nothing more
need be said to prove that she has carried out, willingly or
unwillingly, her share of the contract. But very little attention
has yet been paid to the intellectual and spiritual effect of this
division of duties upon those who are enabled by it 'to forsake all
worldly cares and studies'. Yet there can be no doubt that we owe
to this segregation the immense elaboration of modern instruments
and methods of war; the astonishing complexities of theology; the
vast deposit of notes at the bottom of Greek, Latin and even
English texts; the innumerable carvings, chasings and unnecessary
ornamentations of our common furniture and crockery; the myriad
distinctions of <i>Debrett</i> and <i>Burke;</i> and all those
meaningless but highly ingenious turnings and twistings into which
the intellect ties itself when rid of 'the cares of the household
and the family'. The emphasis which both priests and dictators
place upon the necessity for two worlds is enough to prove that it
is essential to the domination.</p>

<p><a name="332" id="332">32.</a> Evidence of the complex nature of
satisfaction of dominance is provided by the following quotation:
'My husband insists that I call him "Sir",' said a woman at the
Bristol Police Court yesterday, when she applied for a maintenance
order. 'To keep the peace I have complied with his request,' she
added. 'I also have to clean his boots, fetch his razor when he
shaves, and speak up promptly when he asks me questions.' In the
same issue of the same paper Sir E. F. Fletcher is reported to have
'urged the House of Commons to stand up to dictators.' (<i>Daily
Herald,</i> 1 August 1926.) This would seem to show that the common
consciousness which includes husband, wife and House of Commons is
feeling at one and the same moment the desire to dominate, the need
to comply in order to keep the peace, and the necessity of
dominating the desire for dominance&mdash;a psychological conflict
which serves to explain much that appears inconsistent and
turbulent in contemporary opinion. The pleasure of dominance is of
course further complicated by the fact that it is still, in the
educated class, closely allied with the pleasures of wealth, social
and professional prestige. Its distinction from the comparatively
simple pleasures&mdash;e.g. the pleasure of a country walk&mdash;is
proved by the fear of ridicule which great psychologists, like
Sophocles, detect in the dominator; who is also peculiarly
susceptible according to the same authority either to ridicule or
defiance on the part of the female sex. An essential element in
this pleasure therefore would seem to be derived not from the
feeling itself but from the reflection of other people's feelings,
and it would follow that it can be influenced by a change in those
feelings. Laughter as an antidote to dominance is perhaps
indicated.</p>

<p><a name="335" id="335">35.</a> External observation would
suggest that a man still feels it a peculiar insult to be taunted
with cowardice by a woman in much the same way that a woman feels
it a peculiar insult to be taunted with unchastity by a man. The
following quotation supports this view. Mr Bernard Shaw writes: 'I
am not forgetting the gratification that war gives to the instinct
of pugnacity and admiration of courage that are so strong in women
. . . In England on the outbreak of war civilized young women rush
about handing white feathers to all young men who are not in
uniform. This,' he continues, 'like other survivals from savagery
is quite natural,' and he points out that 'in old days a woman's
life and that of her children depended on the courage and killing
capacity of her mate.' Since vast numbers of young men did their
work all through the war in offices without any such adornment, and
the number of 'civilized young women' who stuck feathers in coats
must have been infinitesimal compared with those who did nothing of
the kind, Mr Shaw's exaggeration is sufficient proof of the immense
psychological impression that fifty or sixty feathers (no actual
statistics are available) can still make. This would seem to show
that the male still preserves an abnormal susceptibility to such
taunts; therefore that courage and pugnacity are still among the
prime attributes of manliness; therefore that he still wishes to be
admired for possessing them; therefore that any derision of such
qualities would have a proportionate effect. That 'the manhood
emotion' is also connected with economic independence seems
probable. 'We have never known a man who was not, openly or
secretly, proud of being able to support women; whether they were
his sisters or his mistresses. We have never known a woman who did
not regard the change from economic independence on an employer to
economic dependence on a man, as an honourable promotion. What is
the good of men and women lying to each other about these things?
It is not we that have made them'&mdash;<i>(A. H. Orage,</i> by
Philip Mairet, vii)&mdash;an interesting statement, attributed by
G. K. Chesterton to A. H. Orage.</p>

<p><a name="336" id="336">36.</a> Until the beginning of the
eighties, according to Miss Haldane, the sister of R. B. Haldane,
no lady could work. 'I should, of course, have liked to study for a
profession, but that was an impossible idea unless one were in the
sad position of "having to work for one's bread" and that would
have been a terrible state of affairs. Even a brother wrote of the
melancholy fact after he had been to see Mrs Langtry act. "She was
a lady and acted like a lady, but what a sad thing it was that she
should have to do so!'" (<i>From</i> <i>One Century to Another,</i>
by Elizabeth Haldane, pp. 73-4.) Harriet Martineau earlier in the
century was delighted when her family lost its money, for thus she
lost her 'gentility' and was allowed to work.</p>

<p><a name="339" id="339">39.</a> How nominal that opening was is
shown by the following account of the actual conditions under which
women worked in the R.A. Schools about 1900. 'Why the female of the
species should never be given the same advantages as the male it is
difficult to understand. At the R.A. Schools we women had to
compete against men for all the prizes and medals that were given
each year, and we were only allowed half the amount of tuition and
less than half their opportunities for study . . . No nude model
was allowed to be posed in the women's painting room at the R.A.
Schools . . . The male students not only worked from nude models,
both male and female, during the day, but they were given an
evening class as well, at which they could make studies from the
figure, the visiting R.A. instructing.' This seemed to the women
students 'very unfair indeed'; Miss Collyer had the courage and the
social standing necessary to beard first Mr Franklin Dicksee, who
argued that since girls marry, money spent on their teaching is
money wasted; next Lord Leighton; and at length the thin edge of
the wedge, that is the undraped figure, was allowed. But 'the
advantages of the night class we never did succeed in obtaining . .
." The women students therefore clubbed together and hired a
photographer's studio in Baker Street. 'The money that we, as the
committee, had to find, reduced our meals to near starvation diet.'
(<i>Life of an Artist,</i> by Margaret Collyer, pp. 19-81, 82.) The
same rule was in force at the Nottingham Art School in the
twentieth century. 'Women were not allowed to draw from the nude.
If the men worked from the living figure I had to go into the
Antique Room . . . the hatred of those plaster figures stays with
me till this day. I never got any benefit out of their study.'
(<i>Oil Paint</i> <i>and Grease Paint,</i> by Dame Laura Knight, p.
47.) But the profession of art is not the only profession that is
thus nominally open. The profession of medicine is 'open', but '. .
. nearly all the Schools attached to London Hospitals are barred to
women students, whose training in London is mainly carried on at
the London School of Medicine.' (<i>Memorandum on the Position of
English Women in Relation to that of English Men,</i> by Philippa
Strachey, 1935, p. 26.) 'Some of the girl "medicals" at Cambridge
University have formed themselves into a group to ventilate the
grievance.' (<i>Evening News,</i> 25 March 1937.) In 1922 women
students were admitted to the Royal Veterinary College, Camden
Town. ". . . since then the profession has attracted so many women
that the number has recently been restricted to 50.' (<i>Daily
Telegraph,</i> 1 October 1937.)</p>

<p><a name="340" id="340">40 and 41.</a> <i>The Life of Mary
Kingsley,</i> by Stephen Gwyn, pp. 18, 26. In a fragment of a
letter Mary Kingsley writes: 'I am useful occasionally, but that is
all&mdash;very useful a few months ago when on calling on a friend
she asked me to go up to her bedroom and see her new hat&mdash;a
suggestion that staggered me, I knowing her opinion of mine in such
matters.' 'The letter,' says Mr Gwyn, 'did not complete this
adventure of an unauthorised <i>fianc&eacute;,</i> but I am sure
she got him off the roof and enjoyed the experience riotously.'</p>

<p><a name="342" id="342">42.</a> According to Antigone there are
two kinds of law, the written and the unwritten, and Mrs Drummond
maintains that it may sometimes be necessary to improve the written
law by breaking it. But the many and varied activities of the
educated man's daughter in the nineteenth century were clearly not
simply or even mainly directed towards breaking the laws. They
were, on the contrary, endeavours of an experimental kind to
discover what are the unwritten laws; that is the private laws that
should regulate certain instincts, passions, mental and physical
desires. That such laws exist and are observed by civilized people,
is fairly generally allowed; but it is beginning to be agreed that
they were not laid down by 'God', who is now very generally held to
be a conception, of patriarchial origin, valid only for certain
races, at certain stages and times; nor by nature, who is now known
to vary greatly in her commands and to be largely under control;
but have to be discovered afresh by successive generations, largely
by their own efforts of reason and imagination. Since, however,
reason and imagination are to some extent the product of our
bodies, and there are two kinds of body, male and female, and since
these two bodies have been proved within the past few years to
differ fundamentally, it is clear that the laws that they perceive
and respect must be differently interpreted. Thus Professor Julian
Huxley says: '. . . from the moment of fertilization onwards, man
and woman differ in every cell of their body in regard to the
number of their chromosomes&mdash;those bodies which, for all the
world's unfamiliarity, have been shown by the last decade's work to
be the bearers of heredity, the determiners of our characters and
qualities.' In spite of the fact, therefore, that 'the
superstructure of intellectual and practical life is potentially
the same in both sexes,' and that 'The recent Board of Education
Report of the Committee on the Differentiation of the Curriculum
for Boys and Girls in Secondary Schools (London, 1923), has
established that the intellectual differences between the sexes are
very much slighter than popular belief allows,' (<i>Essays in
Popular Science,</i> by Julian Huxley, pp. 62-3), it is clear that
the sexes now differ and will always differ. If it were possible
not only for each sex to ascertain what laws hold good in its own
case, and to respect each other's laws; but also to share the
results of those discoveries, it might be possible for each sex to
develop fully and improve in quality without surrendering its
special characteristics. The old conception that one sex must
'dominate' another would then become not only obsolete, but so
odious that if it were necessary for practical purposes that a
dominant power should decide certain matters, the repulsive task of
coercion and dominion would be relegated to an inferior and secret
society, much as the flogging and execution of criminals is now
carried out by masked beings in profound obscurity. But this is to
anticipate.</p>

<p><a name="343" id="343">43.</a> From <i>The Times</i> obituary
notice of H. W. Greene, fellow of Magdalen College, Oxford,
familiarly called 'Grugger', 6 February 1933.</p>

<p><a name="344" id="344">44.</a> 'In 1747 the quarterly court (of
the Middlesex Hospital) decided to set apart some of the beds for
lying-in cases under rules which precluded any woman from acting as
midwife. The exclusion of women has remained the traditional
attitude. In 1861 Miss Garrett, afterwards Dr Garrett Anderson,
obtained permission to attend classes . . . and was permitted to
visit the wards with the resident officers, but the students
protested and the medical officers gave way. The Board declined an
offer from her to endow a scholarship for women students.' (<i>The
Times,</i> 17 May 1935.)</p>

<p><a name="345" id="345">45.</a> 'There is, in the modern world, a
great body of well-attested knowledge . . . but as soon as any
strong passion intervenes to warp the expert's judgment he becomes
unreliable, whatever scientific equipment he may possess.' (<i>The
Scientific Outlook,</i> by Bertrand Russell, p. 17.)</p>

<p><a name="346" id="346">46.</a> One of the record-breakers,
however, gave a reason for record-breaking which must compel
respect: 'Then, too, there was my belief that now and then women
should do for themselves what men have already done&mdash;and
occasionally what men have not done&mdash;thereby establishing
themselves as persons, and perhaps encouraging other women towards
greater independence of thought and action . . . When they fail,
their failure must be a challenge to others.' (<i>The Last
Flight,</i> by Amelia Earhart, pp. 21, 65.)</p>

<p><a name="347" id="347">47.</a> 'In point of fact this process
[childbirth] actually disables women only for a very small fraction
in most of their lives&mdash;even a woman who has six children is
only necessarily laid up for twelve months out of her whole
lifetime.' (<i>Careers and Openings for</i> <i>Women,</i> by Ray
Strachey, pp. 47-8.) At present, however, she is necessarily
occupied for much longer. The bold suggestion has been made that
the occupation is not exclusively maternal, but could be shared by
both parents to the common good.</p>

<p><a name="348" id="348">48.</a> The nature of manhood and the
nature of womanhood are frequently defined both by Italian and
German dictators. Both repeatedly insist that it is the nature of
man and indeed the essence of manhood to fight. Hitler, for
example, draws a distinction between 'a nation of pacifists and a
nation of men'. Both repeatedly insist that it is the nature of
womanhood to heal the wounds of the fighter. Nevertheless a very
strong movement is on foot towards emancipating man from the old
'natural and eternal law' that man is essentially a fighter;
witness the growth of pacifism among the male sex today. Compare
further Lord Knebworth's statement 'that if permanent peace were
ever achieved, and armies and navies ceased to exist, there would
be no outlet for the manly qualities which fighting developed,'
with the following statement by another young man of the same
social caste a few months ago: '. . . it is not true to say that
every boy at heart longs for war. It is only other people who teach
it us by giving us swords and guns, soldiers and uniforms to play
with.' (<i>Conquest of the Past,</i> by Prince Hubertus
Loewenstein, p. 215.) It is possible that the Fascist States by
revealing to the younger generation at least the need for
emancipation from the old conception of virility are doing for the
male sex what the Crimean and the European wars did for their
sisters. Professor Huxley, however, warns us that 'any considerable
alteration of the hereditary constitution is an affair of
millennia, not of decades.' On the other hand, as science also
assures us that our life on earth is 'an affair of millennia, not
of decades', some alteration in the hereditary constitution may be
worth attempting.</p>

<p><a name="349" id="349">49.</a> Coleridge however expresses the
views and aims of the outsiders with some accuracy in the following
passage: 'Man must be <i>free</i> or to what purpose was he made a
Spirit of Reason, and not a Machine of Instinct? Man must
<i>obey;</i> or wherefore has he a conscience? The powers, which
create this difficulty, contain its solution likewise; for
<i>their</i> service is perfect freedom. And whatever law or system
of law compels any other service, disennobles our nature, leagues
itself with the animal against the godlike, kills in us the very
principle of joyous well-doing, and fights against humanity . . .
If therefore society is to be under a <i>rightful</i> constitution
of government, and one that can impose on rational Beings a true
and moral obligation to obey it, it must be framed on such
principles that every individual follows his own Reason, while he
obeys the laws of the constitution, and performs the will of the
State while he follows the dictates of his own Reason. This is
expressly asserted by Rousseau, who states the problem of a perfect
constitution of government in the following words: Trouver une
forme d'Association&mdash;par laquelle chacun s'unisant &agrave;
tous, n'obeisse pourtant qu'&agrave; lui m&ecirc;me, et reste aussi
libre qu'auparavant, i.e. To find a form of society according to
which each one uniting with the whole shall yet obey himself only
and remain as free as before.' (<i>The Friend,</i> by S. T.
Coleridge, vol. I, pp. 333, 334, 335, 1818 edition.) To which may
be added a quotation from Walt Whitman:</p>

<p>'Of Equality&mdash;as if it harm'd me, giving others the same
chances and rights as myself&mdash;as if it were not indispensable
to my own rights that others possess the same.'</p>

<p>And finally the words of a half-forgotten novelist, George Sand,
are worth considering:</p>

<p>'Toutes les existences sont solidaires les unes des autres, et
tout &ecirc;tre humain qui pr&eacute;senterait la sienne
isol&eacute;ment, sans la rattacher &agrave; celle de ses
semblables, n'offrirait qu'une &eacute;nigme &agrave;
d&eacute;brouiller . . . Cette individualit&eacute; n'a par elle
seule ni signification ni importance aucune. Elle ne prend un sens
quelconque qu'en devenant une parcelle de la vie
g&eacute;n&eacute;rale, en se fondant avec l'individualit&eacute;
de chacun de mes semblables, et c'est par l&agrave; qu'elle devient
de l'histoire.' (<i>Histoire de ma Vie,</i> by George Sand, pp.
240-41.)</p>
