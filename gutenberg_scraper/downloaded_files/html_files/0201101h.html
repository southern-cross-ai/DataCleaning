  <h3 align="center"><b>1</b></h3>
  <p>I cannot pretend to say how it all happened: I can but relate what occurred,
  leaving those of my friends who are versed in psychic matters to find a plausible
  explanation for the fact that on that horrible foggy afternoon I chanced
  to walk into that blameless tea-shop at that particular hour. Now I had not
  been inside a tea-shop for years and I had practically ceased to think of
  the Man in the Corner&#8213; the weird, spook-like creature with the baggy
  trousers, the huge horn-rimmed spectacles, and the thin claw-like hands that
  went on fidgeting, fidgeting, fidgeting, with a piece of string, tying it
  with nervy deliberation into innumerable and complicated knots.</p>
  <p>And yet when I walked into that tea-shop and saw him sitting in the corner
  by the fire, I was hardly conscious of surprise; but I did not think that
  he would recognise me. So I sat down at the next table to him, and when I
  thought that he was most intent on fidgeting with his piece of string, I
  stole surreptitious glances at him. The last twenty years seemed to have
  passed him by; he was just the same; his hair was of the same colourless,
  lank texture and still lay plastered across his bald, pointed cranium, his
  pale eyes were no paler, his face no more wrinkled, his fingers were just
  as agile and restless as they had been when I last saw him twenty years ago.</p>
  <p>Then all at once he spoke, just as he used to do, in the same cracked voice,
  with the dry, ironic chuckle.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;One of the most interesting cases it has ever been my good fortune
  to investigate,&rdquo; he said.</p>
  <p>I had not realised that he had seen me, and I gave such a startled jump
  that I spilt half a cup of tea on my frock. With a long, bony finger he was
  pointing to a copy of the <i>Express Post</i> which lay beside his plate,
  and, almost against my will, my eyes wandered to the flaming headline: &ldquo;The
  Mystery of the Khaki Tunic.&rdquo; Then I looked up enquiringly at my pixy-like
  interlocutor. His watery blue eyes contemplated me through his horn-rimmed
  spectacles and his thin, colourless lips smiled on me with placid benevolence.
  It never occurred to me to make a conventional little speech about the lapse
  of time since last we met; for the moment</p>
  <p>I had the feeling as if I had seen him the day before yesterday. &ldquo;You
  are still interested in criminology then?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;More than ever,&rdquo; he replied with a bland smile, &ldquo;and
  this case has given me some of the most delightful moments I have ever experienced
  in connection with my studies. I have watched the police committing one blunder
  after another, and today when they are completely baffled, and the public
  has started to write letters to the papers about another undetected crime
  and another criminal at large. I am having the time of my life.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of course you have made up your mind,&rdquo; I retorted with what
  I felt was withering sarcasm.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I have arrived at the only possible solution of the mystery,&rdquo; he
  replied unperturbed, &ldquo;and you will do the same when I have put the
  facts clearly and logically before you. As for the police, let &rsquo;em
  flounder,&rdquo; he went on complacently. &ldquo;For me it has been an exciting
  drama, to watch from beginning to end. Every one of the characters in it
  stands out before me like a clear-cut cameo. There was Miss Mary Clarke,
  a quiet middle-aged woman who rented &lsquo;Hardacres,&rsquo; from Lord Foremeere.
  She had taken the place soon after the Armistice and ran a poultry farm there
  on a small scale with the occasional assistance of her brother Arthur, an
  ex-officer in the East Glebeshires, a young man who had an excellent war
  record, but who seemed, like so many other young men of his kind, to have
  fallen into somewhat shiftless and lazy ways since the glorious peace.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No doubt you know the geography of the place. The halfpenny papers
  have been full of maps and plans of &lsquo;Hardacres.&rsquo; It is rather
  a lonely house on the road between Langford and Barchester, about three quarters
  of a mile from Meere village. Meere Court is another half-mile or so further
  on, the house hidden by clumps of stately trees, above which can be perceived
  the towers of Barchester Cathedral.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Very little seems to have been known about Miss Clarke in the neighbourhood;
  she seemed to be fairly well-to-do and undoubtedly a cut above the village
  folk; but, equally obviously, she did not belong to the county set. Nor did
  she encourage visitors, not even the vicar; she seldom went to church, and
  neither went to parties nor ever asked anyone to tea; she did most of her
  shopping herself, in Meere, and sold her poultry and eggs to Mr. Brook, the
  local dealer, who served all the best houses for miles around. Every morning
  at seven o&rsquo;clock a girl from the village named Emily Baker came in
  to do the housework at &lsquo;Hardacres,&rsquo; and left again after the
  midday dinner. Once a week regularly Miss Clarke called at Meere Court. Always
  on a Friday. She walked over in the afternoon, whatever the weather, brought
  a large basket of eggs with her, and was shown without ever being kept waiting,
  straight into Lady Foremeere&rsquo;s sitting-room. The interview lasted about
  ten minutes, sometimes more, and then she would be shown out again.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mind you,&rdquo; the funny creature went on glibly, and raising a,
  long, pointed finger to emphasise his words, &ldquo;no one seems to have
  thought that there was anything mysterious about Miss Clarke. The fact that &lsquo;she
  kept &rsquo;erself to &rsquo;erself&rsquo; was not in itself a sign of anything
  odd about her. People, especially women, in outlying country districts, often
  lead very self-centred lonely lives; they arouse a certain amount of curiosity
  when they first arrive in the neighbourhood, but after a while gossip dies
  out, if it is not fed, and the hermit&rsquo;s estrangements from village
  life is tacitly accepted.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;On the other hand Miss Clarke&rsquo;s brother Arthur was exceedingly
  gregarious. He was a crack tennis player and an excellent dancer, and these
  two accomplishments procured him the entree into the best houses in the county&#8213; houses
  which, before the war, when people were more fastidious in the choice of
  their guests, would no doubt have not been quite so freely opened to him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It was common gossip that Arthur was deeply in love with April St.
  Jude, Lord Foremeere&rsquo;s beautiful daughter by a previous marriage, but
  public opinion was unanimous in the assertion that there never could be any
  question of marriage between an extemporary gentleman without money or property
  of any kind and the society beauty who had been courted by some of the smartest
  and richest men in London.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nor did Arthur Clarke enjoy the best of reputations in the neighbourhood:
  he was over fond of betting and loafing about the public-houses of Barchester.
  People said that he might help his sister in the farm more than he did, seeing
  that he did not appear to have a sixpence of his own, and that she gave him
  bed and board; but as he was very good looking and could make himself very
  agreeable if he chose, the women at any rate smiled at his misdeeds and were
  content to call Arthur &lsquo;rather wild, but not really a bad boy.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then came the tragedy.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;On the twenty-eighth of December last, when Emily Baker came to work
  as usual, she was rather surprised not to see or hear Miss Clarke moving
  about the place. As a rule she was out in the yard by the time Emily arrived;
  the chickens would have had their hot mash and the empty pans would have
  been left for Emily to wash up. But this morning nothing. In the girl&rsquo;s
  own words, there was a creepy kind of lonely feeling about the house. She
  knew that Mr. Clarke was not at home. The day before the servants at Meere
  Court had their annual Christmas party, and Mr. Clarke had been asked to
  help with the tree and to entertain the children. He had announced his intention
  of putting up afterwards at the Deanery Hotel for the night, a thing he was
  rather fond of doing whenever he was asked out to parties, and did not know
  what time he might be able to get away.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Emily when she arrived had found the front door on the latch as usual,
  therefore&#8213; she reflected&#8213; Miss Clarke must have been downstairs
  and drawn the bolts; but where could she be now? Never, never would she have
  gone out before feeding her chickens, on such a cold morning too!</p>
  <p>&ldquo;At this point Emily gave up reflecting and proceeded to action. She
  went up to her mistress&rsquo;s room. It was empty and the bed had not been
  slept in. Genuinely alarmed now, she ran down again, her next objective being
  the parlour. The door was, as usual, locked on the outside, but, contrary
  to precedent, the key was not in the lock; thinking it had dropped out, the
  girl searched for it, but in vain, and at one moment when she moved the small
  mat which stood before the door of the locked room she at once became aware
  of an overpowering smell of gas.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;This proved the death-blow to Emily&rsquo;s fortitude; she took to
  her heels and ran out of the house and down the road toward the village,
  nor did she halt until she came to the local police station, where she gave
  as coherent an account as she could of the terrible state of things at &lsquo;Hardacres.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You will remember that when the police broke open the door of the
  parlour the first thing they saw was the body of Miss Clarke lying full length
  on the floor. The poor woman was quite dead, suffocated by the poisonous
  fumes of gas which was fully turned on in the old-fashioned chandelier above
  her head. The one window had been carefully latched, and the thick curtains
  closely drawn together; the chimney had been stuffed up with newspaper and
  paper had been thrust into every aperture so as to exclude the slightest
  possible breath of air. There was a wad of it in the keyhole, and the mat
  on the landing outside had been carefully arranged against the door with
  the same sinister object.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It was clearly a deliberate case of murder; the news spread like
  wildfire and soon the entire neighbourhood was gloating over a sensation
  the like of which had not come its way for generations past.&rdquo;</p>
  <h3 align="center"><b>2</b></h3>
  <p>&ldquo;The London evening papers got hold of the story for their noonday
  edition,&rdquo; the Man in the Corner went on after a slight pause, &ldquo;and
  I, with my passion for the enigmatical and the perplexing, made up my mind
  then and there to probe the mystery on my own account, because I knew well
  enough that this was just the sort of case which would send the county police
  blundering all over the wrong track.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I arrived at Barchester on the Tuesday in time for the inquest, but
  nothing of much importance transpired that day. Medical evidence went to
  prove that the deceased had first been struck on the back of the head by
  some heavy instrument, a weighted stick or something of the sort, which had
  no doubt stunned her; but she actually died of poisoning by gas which she
  had inhaled in large quantities while she was half-conscious. The medical
  officer went on to say that Miss Clarke must have been dead twelve hours
  or more when he was called in by the police at about eight o&rsquo;clock
  in the morning. After this a couple of neighbours testified to having seen
  Miss Clarke at her front door at about half-past five the previous evening.
  It was a very dark night, if you remember, and a thick Scotch mist was falling.
  When the neighbours went by, Miss Clarke had apparently just introduced a
  visitor into her house, the gas was alight in the small hall and they had
  vaguely perceived the outline of a man or woman, they could not swear which,
  in a huge coat, standing for a moment immediately behind Miss Clarke; the
  neighbours also heard Miss Clarke&rsquo;s voice speaking to her visitor,
  but what she said they could not distinguish. The weather was so atrocious
  that everyone who was abroad that night hurried along without taking much
  notice of what went on around.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Evidence of a more or less formal character followed and the inquest
  was then adjourned until the Friday, everyone going away with the feeling
  that sensational developments were already in the air.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And the developments came tumbling in thick and fast, To begin with,
  it appears that Arthur Clarke, when first questioned by the police, had made
  a somewhat lame statement.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;I was asked,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;to help with the servants&rsquo; Christmas
  party at Meere Court. I walked over to Barchester at about three o&rsquo;clock
  in the afternoon, with my suitcase, as I was going to spend the night at
  the Deanery Hotel. I went on to Meere Court soon after half-past three, and
  stayed until past seven, after which I walked back to the Deanery, had some
  dinner and went early to bed. I never knew that anything had happened to
  my sister until the police telephoned to me soon after eight o&rsquo;clock
  the next morning. And,&rsquo; he added, &lsquo;that&rsquo;s all about it.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But it certainly was not &lsquo;all about it&rsquo;, because several
  of the servants at Meere Court who were asked at what time Mr. Clarke went
  away that night, said that he must have gone very soon after five o&rsquo;clock.
  They all finished their tea about that time, and then the gramophone was
  set going for dancing; they were quite sure that they had not seen Mr. Clarke
  after that. On the other hand Miss St. Jude said that the servants were mistaken:
  they were far too deeply engrossed in their own amusements to be at all reliable
  in their statements. As a matter of fact Mr. Clarke went away, as he said,
  at about seven o&rsquo;clock; she herself had danced with him most of the
  time, and said good night to him in the hall at a few minutes after seven.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Here was a neat little complication, do you see? A direct conflict
  of evidence at the very outset of this mysterious case. Can you wonder that
  amateur detectives already shrugged their shoulders and raised their eyebrows,
  declaring that the Honourable April St. Jude was obviously in love with Arthur
  Clarke and was trying to shield him, well knowing that he had something to
  hide.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of course the police themselves were very reticent, but even they
  could not stop people from gossiping. And gossip, I can assure you, had enough
  and to spare to feed on. At first, of course, the crime had seemed entirely
  motiveless. The deceased had not an enemy or, as far as that goes, many acquaintances
  in the world. In the drawer of the desk, in the parlour, the sum of twenty
  pounds odd in notes and cash was found, and in a little box by the side of
  the money poor Mary Clarke&rsquo;s little bits of jewellery. But twenty-four
  hours later no one could remain in doubt as to the assassin&rsquo;s purpose.
  You will remember that on the day following the adjourned inquest there had
  arrived from the depths of Yorkshire an old sister of the deceased, a respectable
  spinster, to whom Arthur himself, it seems, had communicated the terrible
  news. She had come to Barchester for the funeral. This elder Miss Clarke,
  Euphemia by name, though she could not say much that was informative, did
  at any rate throw light upon one dark passage in her sister&rsquo;s history.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;For the past four years,&rsquo; she told the police, &lsquo;my
  sister had an allowance of &pound;4 a week from a member of the aristocracy.
  I did not know much about her affairs, but I do know that she had a packet
  of letters on which she set great store. What these letters were I have not
  the slightest idea, nor do I know what Mary ultimately did with them. On
  one occasion, before she was actually settled at &ldquo;Hardacres,&rdquo; she
  met me in London and asked me to take care of this packet for her, and she
  told me then that they were very valuable. I also know that she and my brother
  Arthur had most heated arguments together on the subject of these letters.
  Arthur was always wanting her to give them up to him and she always refused.
  On one occasion she told me that she could, if she wanted, sell that packet
  of letters for five thousand pounds. &ldquo;Why on earth don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; I
  asked her. But she replied: &ldquo;Oh, Arthur would only get the money out
  of me. It&rsquo;s better as it is.&rdquo;&lsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;This story, as you may well imagine, gave food enough for gossip;
  at once a romance was woven of blackmail and drama of love and passion, whilst
  the name of a certain great lady in the neighbourhood, to whom Miss Clarke
  had been in the habit of paying mysterious weekly visits, was already on
  everybody&rsquo;s lips.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And then the climax came. By evening it had transpired that in Arthur
  Clarke&rsquo;s room at &lsquo;Hardacres&rsquo; the police had found an old
  khaki tunic stuffed away at the bottom of a drawer, and in the pocket of
  the tunic the key of the locked parlour door. It was an officer&rsquo;s tunic,
  which had at some time had its buttons and badges taken off; its right sleeve
  was so torn that it was nearly out of its arm hole; the cuff was all crumpled
  as if it had been crushed in a damp, hot hand, and there was a small piece
  of the cloth torn clean out of it. And&#8213; I will leave you to guess the
  importance of this fact&#8213; in the tightly-clenched hand of the murdered
  woman was found the small piece of khaki cloth which corresponded to a hair&rsquo;s
  breadth with the missing bit in the sleeve of the tunic.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;After that the man in the street shook his head and declared that
  Arthur Clarke was as good as hung already.&rdquo;</p>
  <h3 align="center"><b>3</b></h3>
  <p>The Man in the Corner had drawn out of his capacious pocket a fresh piece
  of string. And now his claw-like fingers started to work on it with feverish
  intentness. I watched him, fascinated, well knowing that his keen mind was
  just as busy with the problem of the &ldquo;Hardacres&rdquo; mystery as were
  his hands in the fashioning of some intricate and complicated knot.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I am not,&rdquo; he said after a while, &ldquo;going to give you
  an elaborate description of the inquest and of the crowds that collected
  both inside and out of the court room, hoping to get a glimpse of the principal
  actors in the exciting drama. By now, of course, all those who had talked
  of the crime being without apparent motive had effectually been silenced.
  To every amateur detective, as well as to the professional, the murderer
  and his nefarious object appeared absolutely revealed to the light of day.
  Every indication, every scrap of evidence collected up to this hour, both
  direct and circumstantial, pointed to Arthur Clarke as the murderer of his
  sister. There were the letters, which were alleged to be worth five thousand
  pounds to the mysterious member of the aristocracy who was paying Miss Clarke
  a weekly pittance, obviously in order to silence her; there was the strong
  love motive&#8213; the young man in love with the girl far above him in
  station and wanting to get hold of a large sum of money in order, no doubt,
  to embark on some profitable business which might help him in his wooing;
  and there, above all, was the damning bit of khaki cloth in the murdered
  woman&rsquo;s hand, and the tunic with the key of the locked door in its
  pocket found in a drawer in Clarke&rsquo;s own room. No, indeed, the inquest
  was not likely to be a dull affair, more especially as no one doubted what
  the verdict would be, whilst a good many people anticipated that Clarke would
  at once be arrested on the coroner&rsquo;s warrant and committed for trial
  at the next assizes on the capital charge.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But though we all knew that the inquest would not be dull, yet we
  were not prepared for the surprises which were in store for us, and which
  will render that inquest a memorable one in the annals of criminal investigation.
  To begin with we already knew that Arthur Clarke had now the assistance of
  Mr. Markham, one of the leading solicitors of Barchester, in his difficult
  position. Acting on that gentleman&rsquo;s advice Clarke had amplified the
  statement which he had originally made as to his movements on the fatal afternoon.
  This amplified statement he now reiterated on oath, and though frankly no
  one believed him, we were bound to admit that if he could substantiate it,
  an extraordinary complication would arise, which though it might not eventually
  clear him altogether, in the minds of thinking people, would at any rate
  give him the benefit of the doubt. What he now stated was in substance this:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;The servants at Meere Court,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;are quite
  right when they say that I left the party soon after five o&rsquo;clock.
  I was rather tired, and after a last dance with Miss St. Jude I went upstairs
  to pay my respects to Lady Foremeere. Her ladyship, however, kept me talking
  for some considerable time on one subject and then another, until, to my
  astonishment, I saw that it was close on seven o&rsquo;clock, when I hastily
  took my leave. While I was looking for my coat in the hall I remember that
  Lord Foremeere came out of the smoking-room and asked me if I knew whether
  the party downstairs had broken up. &ldquo;These things are such a bore,&rdquo; he
  said, &ldquo;but I will see if I can get one of them to come up and show
  you out.&rdquo; I told his lordship not to trouble; however, he rang the
  bell, and presently the butler, Spinks, came through from the servants&rsquo; quarters,
  and his lordship then went upstairs I think. A minute or two later Miss St.
  Jude came, also from the servants&rsquo; quarters; she sent Spinks away telling
  him that she would look after me; we then talked together for a few moments
  and then I said good night and went straight back to the hotel.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now we had already learned from both the hall-porter and the head-waiter
  at the Deanery that Mr. Clarke was back at the hotel soon after seven o&rsquo;clock,
  that he had his dinner in the restaurant at half-past, and that after spending
  an hour or so in the lounge after dinner he went up to his room and did not
  go out again until the following morning. Therefore all that was needed now
  was a confirmatory statement from Lady Foremeere to prove Arthur Clarke&rsquo;s
  innocence, because in that case every hour of his time would be accounted
  for, from half-past three onwards, whilst Miss Clarke was actually seen alive
  by two neighbours when she introduced a visitor into her house at half-past
  five.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The question would then resolve itself into, who was that visitor?
  leaving the more important one of the khaki tunic a baffling mystery, rather
  than a damning evidence.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The entire court room was on the tiptoe of expectation when Lady
  Foremeere was formally called. I can assure you that the ubiquitous pin could
  have been heard to drop during the brief moment&rsquo;s silence when the
  elegant society woman stood up and disposed her exquisite sable cape about
  her shoulders and then swore to tell the whole truth and nothing but the
  truth.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She answered the coroner&rsquo;s questions in a dear, audible voice,
  and never wavered in her assertions. She said that her step-daughter had
  come up to her boudoir and asked her if she would see Mr. Arthur Clarke for
  a few moments; he had something very important to say to her.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I was rather surprised at the strange request,&rsquo; Lady
  Foremeere continued with utmost composure, &lsquo;and suggested that Mr.
  Clarke should make his important communication to Lord Foremeere, but my
  step-daughter insisted and to please her I agreed. I thought that I would
  get my husband to be present at this mysterious interview, but his lordship
  was having a short rest in the smoking-room, so on second consideration I
  decided not to disturb him. A minute or two later Mr.&#8213; er&#8213; Clarke
  presented himself and at once I realised that he had had too much to drink.
  He talked wildly about his desire to marry Miss St. Jude and very excitedly
  about some compromising letters which he alleged were in his possession and
  which he threatened to show to Lord Foremeere, if I did not at once give
  him so many thousand pounds. Naturally I ordered him out of the place, but
  he wouldn&rsquo;t go for a long time; he got more and more incoherent and
  excited and it was not until I threatened to fetch Lord Foremeere immediately
  that he sobered down and finally I went away. He had been in my room about
  half an hour.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;About half an hour?&rsquo;&rdquo; was the coroner&rsquo;s
  earnest comment on this amazing piece of evidence, &lsquo;but Mr. Clarke
  said that when he left your ladyship it was close on seven.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Mr.&#8213; er&#8213; Clarke is in error,&rsquo; her ladyship
  asserted firmly. &lsquo;The clock had just struck half-past five when I succeeded
  in ridding myself of him.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You can easily imagine how great was the excitement at this moment
  and how intensified it became when Lord Foremeere gave evidence in his turn
  and further confused the issues. He began by corroborating Arthur Clarke&rsquo;s
  statement about his having spoken to him in the hall at seven o&rsquo;clock.
  It was almost unbelievable! Everybody gasped and the coroner almost gave
  a jump:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;But her ladyship has just told us,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;that
  Clarke left her at half-past five!&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;That, no doubt, is accurate,&rsquo; Lord Foremeere rejoined
  in his stiff, prim manner, &lsquo;since her ladyship said so. All I know
  is that I was asleep in front of the fire in the smoking-room when I heard
  a loud bang issuing from the hall. I went to see what it was and there I
  certainly saw Clarke. He was just coming through the glass door which divides
  the outside vestibule from the hall, and he appeared to me to have come straight
  out of the wet and to have left his hat and coat in the outer vestibule.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;But,&rsquo; the coroner insisted, &lsquo;what made your lordship
  think that he had come from outside?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Well, for one thing his face and hands were quite wet and
  he was wiping them with his handkerchief when I first caught sight of him.
  His boots too were wet and so were the edges of his trousers, and then, as
  I said, he was coming into the hall from the outer vestibule, and it was
  the banging of the front door which had roused me.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;And the hour then was?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;The clock had not long since struck seven. But my butler will
  be able to confirm this.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And Spinks the butler did confirm this portion of his lordship&rsquo;s
  statement, though he could say nothing about Mr. Clarke&rsquo;s boots being
  wet; nor did he help Mr. Clarke on with his coat and hat, or open the door
  for him. Miss St. Jude had practically followed Spinks into the hall, and
  had at once dismissed him, saying she would look after Mr. Clarke. His lordship
  in the meanwhile had gone upstairs and Spinks went back into the servants&rsquo; hall.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of course Miss St. Jude was called. You remember that she had previously
  stated that Clarke had only left the party at about seven o&rsquo;clock,
  that she herself had danced with him most of the time until then, and finally
  said goodbye to him in the hall. But as this statement was not even corroborated
  by Clarke&rsquo;s own assertions and entirely contradicted by both Lord and
  Lady Foremeere&rsquo;s evidence, she was fortunately advised not to repeat
  it on oath. But she hotly denied the suggestion that Clarke had come in from
  outside when she said goodbye to him in the hall. She saw him put on his
  hat and coat and they were quite dry. But nobody felt that her evidence was
  of any value because she would naturally do her utmost to help her sweetheart.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Finally, one of the most interesting moments in that memorable enquiry
  was reached when Lady Foremeere was recalled and asked to state what she
  knew of Miss Clarke&rsquo;s antecedents.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Very little,&rsquo; she replied. &lsquo;I only knew her in
  France when she worked under me in a hospital. I was very ill at one time
  and she nursed me devotedly; ever since that I helped her financially as
  much as I could.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;You made her a weekly allowance?&rsquo; her ladyship was asked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Not exactly,&rsquo; she replied. &lsquo;I just bought her
  eggs and poultry at a higher figure than she would get from any one else.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Do you know anything about some letters that she thought were
  so valuable?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Oh, yes!&rsquo; the lady replied with a kindly smile. &lsquo;Mary
  had a collection of autograph letters which she had collected whilst she
  was nursing in France. Among them were some by august, and others by very
  distinguished personages. She had the idea that these were extraordinarily
  valuable.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Do you know what became of those letters?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;No,&rsquo; her ladyship replied,&rsquo; I do not know.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;But there were other letters, were there not?&rsquo; the
  coroner insisted, &lsquo;in which you yourself were interested? The ones
  Mr. Clarke spoke to you about?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;They existed only in Mr. Clarke&rsquo;s imagination, I fancy,&rsquo; Lady
  Foremeere replied; &lsquo;but he was in such a highly excited state that
  afternoon that I really could not quite make out what it was that he desired
  to sell to me.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Lady Foremeere spoke very quietly and very simply, without a single
  note of spite or acerbity in her soft, musical voice. One felt that she was
  stating quite simple facts that rather bored her, but to which she did not
  attach any importance. And later on when Miss Euphemia Clarke retold the
  story of the packet of letters and of the quarrels which the deceased and
  her brother had about them, and when the damning evidence of the khaki tunic
  stood out like an avenging Nemesis pointing at the unfortunate young man,
  those in court who had imagination saw&#8213; positively saw&#8213; the hangman&rsquo;s
  rope tightening around his neck.</p>
  <h3 align="center"><b>4</b></h3>
  <p>&ldquo;And yet the verdict was one of wilful murder against some person
  or persons unknown,&rdquo; I said, after a slight pause, waiting for the
  funny creature to take up his narrative again.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;Arthur Clarke has been cleared of
  every suspicion. He left the court a free man. His innocence was proved beyond
  question through what everyone thought was the most damnatory piece of evidence
  against him&#8213; the evidence of the khaki tunic. The khaki tunic exonerated
  Arthur Clarke as completely as the most skilful defender could do. Because
  if did not fit him. Arthur Clarke was a rather heavy, full grown, broad-shouldered
  man, the khaki tunic would only fit a slim lad of eighteen. Clarke had admitted
  the tunic was his, but he had never thought of examining it, and certainly
  not of trying it on. It was Miss St. Jude who thought of that. Trust a woman
  in love for getting an inspiration.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;When she was called at the end of the day to affirm the statements
  which she had previously made to the police and realised that these statements
  of hers were actually in contradiction with Clarke&rsquo;s own assertions,
  she worked herself up into at state bordering on hysteria, in the midst of
  which she caught sight of the khaki tunic on the coroner&rsquo;s table. Of
  course she, like every one else in the neighbourhood, knew all about the
  tunic, but when April St. Jude actually saw it with her own eyes and realised
  what its existence meant to her sweetheart she gave a wild shriek.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I&rsquo;ll not believe it,&rsquo; she cried, &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll
  not believe it. It can&rsquo;t be. It is not Arthur&rsquo;s tunic at all.&rsquo; Then
  her eyes dilated, her voice sank to a hoarse whisper, and with a trembling
  hand she pointed at the tunic: &lsquo;Why,&rsquo; she murmured, &lsquo;it
  is so small, so small! Arthur! Where is Arthur! Why does he not show them
  all that he never could have worn that tunic?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Proverbially there is but a narrow dividing line between tragedy
  and farce: while some people shuddered and gasped and men literally held
  their breath, marvelling what would happen next, quite a number of women
  fell into hysterical giggling. Of course you remember what happened. The
  papers have told you all about it. Arthur Clarke was made to try on the khaki
  tunic and he could not even get his arms into the sleeves. Under no circumstances
  could he ever have worn that particular tunic. It was several sizes too small
  for him. Then he examined it closely and recognised it as one he wore in
  his school O.T.C when he was a lad. When he was originally confronted with
  it, he explained he was so upset, so genuinely terrified at the consequences
  of certain follies which he undoubtedly had committed, that he could hardly
  see out of his eyes. The tunic was shown to him and he had admitted that
  it was his, for he had quite a collection of old tunics which he had always
  kept. But for the moment he had quite forgotten about the one which he had
  worn more than eight years ago at school.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And so the khaki tunic, instead of condemning Clarke had entirely
  cleared him, for it now became quite evident that the miscreant who had committed
  the dastardly murder had added this hideous act to his greater crime, and
  deliberately set to work to fasten the guilt on an innocent man. He had gone
  up to Clarke&rsquo;s room, opened the wardrobe, picked up a likely garment,
  no doubt tearing a piece of cloth out of it whilst so doing, and thus getting
  the fiendish idea of inserting that piece of khaki between the fingers of
  the murdered woman. Finally, after locking the parlour door, he put the key
  in the pocket of the tunic and stuffed the latter in the bottom of a drawer.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It was a clever and cruel trick which well nigh succeeded in hanging
  an innocent man. As it is, it has enveloped the affair in an almost impenetrable
  mystery. I say &lsquo;almost&rsquo; because I know who killed Miss Clarke,
  even though the public has thrown out an erroneous conjecture. &lsquo;It
  was Lady Foremeere,&rsquo; they say, &lsquo;who killed Miss Clarke.&rsquo; But
  at once comes the question:</p>
  <p>&lsquo;How could she?&rsquo; And the query: &lsquo;When?&rsquo; Arthur Clarke
  says he was with her until seven, and after that hour there were several
  members of her household who waited upon her, notably her maid who it seems
  came up to dress her at about that time, and she and Lord Foremeere sat down
  to dinner as usual at eight o&rsquo;clock.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That there had been one or two dark passages in Lady Foremeere&rsquo;s
  life, prior to her marriage four years ago, and that Miss Clarke was murdered
  for the sake of letters which were in some way connected with her ladyship
  were the only actual undisputable facts in that mysterious case. That it
  was not Arthur Clarke who killed his sister has been indubitably proved;
  that a great deal of the evidence was contradictory every one has admitted.
  And if the police does not act on certain suggestions which I have made to
  them, the &lsquo;Hardacres&rsquo; murder will remain a mystery to the public
  to the end of time.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;And what are these suggestions?&rsquo; I asked, without the
  slightest vestige of irony, for, much against my will, the man&rsquo;s personality
  exercised a curious fascination over me.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;To keep an eye on Lord Foremeere,&rdquo; the funny creature replied
  with his dry chuckle, &ldquo;and see when and how he finally disposes of
  a wet coat, a dripping hat and soaked boots which he has succeeded in keeping
  concealed somewhere in the smoking-room, away from the prying eyes even of
  his own valet.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;You mean&#8213;?&rsquo; I asked, with an involuntary gasp.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;I mean that it was Lord Foremeere
  who murdered Miss Clarke for the sake of those letters which apparently contained
  matter that was highly compromising to his wife. Everything to my mind points
  to him as the murderer. Whether he knew all along of the existence of the
  compromising letters, or whether he first knew of this through the conversation
  between her ladyship and Clarke the day of the servants&rsquo; party, it
  is impossible to say; certain it is that he did overhear that conversation
  and that he made up his mind to end the impossible situation then and there,
  and to put a stop once and for all to any further attempt at blackmail. It
  was easy enough for him on that day to pass in and out of the house unperceived.
  No doubt his primary object in going to &lsquo;Hardacres&rsquo; was to purchase
  the letters from Miss Clarke, money down; perhaps she proved obstinate, perhaps
  he merely thought that dead men tell no tales. This we shall never know.
  After the hideous deed, which must have revolted his otherwise fastidious
  senses, he must have become conscious of an overwhelming hatred for the man
  who had, as it were, pushed him into crime, and my belief is that the elaborate <i>mise
  en scene</i> of the khaki tunic, and the circumstantial lie that when he
  came out of the smoking-room Arthur Clarke had obviously just come in from
  outside was invented not so much with the object of averting any suspicion
  from himself as with the passionate desire to be revenged on Clarke.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Think it over,&rdquo; the Man in the Corner concluded, as he stuffed
  his beloved bit of string into his capacious pocket; &ldquo;time, opportunity,
  motive, all are in favour of my theory, so do not be surprised if the early
  editions of tomorrow&rsquo;s evening papers contain the final sensation in
  this interesting case.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He was gone before I could say another word, and all that I saw of him was
  his spook-like figure disappearing through the swing door. There was no one
  now in the place, so a moment or two later I too paid my bill and went away.</p>
  <h3 align="center"><b>5</b></h3>
  <p>The Man in the Corner proved to be right in the end. At eleven o&rsquo;clock
  the next morning the street corners were full of newspaper placards with
  the flaring headlines: &ldquo;Sudden death of Lord Foremeere.&rdquo; It was
  reported that on the previous evening his lordship was examining a new automatic
  which he had just bought and explaining the mechanism to his valet. At one
  moment he actually made the remark: &ldquo;It is all right, it isn&rsquo;t
  loaded,&rdquo; but apparently there was one cartridge left in one of the
  chambers. His lordship, it seems, was looking straight down the barrel and
  his finger must accidentally have touched the trigger; anyway, according
  to the valet&rsquo;s story, there was a sudden explosion, and Lord Foremeere
  fell, shot right between the eyes.</p>
  <p>The verdict at the inquest was of course one of accidental death, the coroner
  and jury expressing the greatest possible sympathy with Lady Foremeere and
  Miss St. Jude. It was only subsequently that one or two facts came to light
  which appeared obscure and unimportant to the man in the street, but which
  for me, in the light of my conversation with the Man in the Corner, bore
  earnest significance.</p>
  <p>It seems that an hour or two before the accident, the chief superintendent
  of police had called with two constables at Meere Court and was closeted
  for a considerable time with Lord Foremeere in the smoking-room. And Spinks,
  the butler, who subsequently let the three men out, noticed that one of the
  constables was carrying a coat and a hat, which Spinks knew were old ones
  belonging to his lordship.</p>
  <p>Then I knew that the funny creature in the loud check tweeds and baggy trousers
  had found the true solution of the &lsquo;Hardacres&rsquo; mystery.</p>
  <p>Oh, and you wish to know what was the sequel to the pretty love story between
  April St. Jude and Arthur Clarke. Well, you know, she married Amos Rottenberg,
  the New York banker last year, and Clarke runs a successful garage now somewhere
  in the North. A kind friend must have lent him the capital wherewith to make
  a start. I can make a shrewd guess who that kind friend was.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="TheMysteryOfTheIngresMasterpiece"></a>The Mystery Of The Ingres Masterpiece</b> </h2>
  <h3 align="center"><b>1</b></h3>
  <p>I did not see the Man in the Corner for several weeks after that strange
  meeting in the blameless tea-shop. The exigencies of my work kept me busy,
  and somehow the sensational suicide of Lord Foremeere which had appeared
  like the logical sequence of the spook-like creature&rsquo;s deductions,
  had left a painful impression on my mind. Entirely illogically, I admit,
  I felt that the Man in the Corner had had something to do with the tragedy.</p>
  <p>But when in March of that year we were all thrilled by the mystery of the
  valuable Ingres picture, and wherever one went one heard conjectures and
  explanations of that extraordinary case, my thoughts very naturally reverted
  to the funny creature and his bit of string, and I found myself often wondering
  what his explanation of what seemed a truly impenetrable mystery could possibly
  be.</p>
  <p>The facts certainly were very puzzling in themselves. When first I was deputed
  by the <i>Express Post</i> to put them clearly and succinctly before its
  readers, I found the task strangely difficult; this, for the simple reason
  that I myself could not see daylight through it all, and often did I stand
  in front of the admirable reproduction which I possess of the Ingres &ldquo;La
  Fiancee&rdquo; wondering if those smiling lips would not presently speak
  and tell me how an original and exquisite picture could possibly have been
  in two different places at one and the same time.</p>
  <p>For that, in truth, was the depth of the puzzle. We will, if you please,
  call the original owners of the picture the Duke and Duchess Paul de Rochechouart.
  That, of course, is not their name, but, as you all know what they really
  are, it matters not what I call them for the purpose of recording their singular
  adventure.</p>
  <p>His Grace had early in life married a Swedish lady of great talent and singular
  beauty. She was an artist of no mean order, having exhibited pictures of
  merit both at the Paris Salon and at the Royal Academy in London; she was
  also an accomplished musician, and had published one or two very charming
  volumes of poetry.</p>
  <p>The Duke and his wife were devoted to one another; they lived for the greater
  part of the year at their beautiful chateau on the Oise, not far from Chantilly,
  and here they entertained a great deal, more after the homely and hospitable
  manner of English country houses than in the more formal foreign fashion.
  Here, too, they had collected some rare furniture, tapestries, and objects
  of art and vertu, amongst which certain highly-prized pictures of the French
  School of the Nineteenth Century.</p>
  <p>The war, we may imagine, left the Duc de Rochechouart and his charming wife
  a good deal poorer, as it left most other people in France, and soon it became
  known amongst the art dealers of London, Paris and New York that they had
  decided to sell one or two of their most valuable pictures; foremost amongst
  these was the celebrated &ldquo;La Fiancee&rdquo; by Ingres.</p>
  <p>Immediately there was what is technically known as a ramp after the picture.
  Dealers travelled backwards and forwards from all the great continental cities
  to the chateau on the Oise to view the picture. Offers were made for it by
  cable, telegram and telephone, and the whole art world was kept in a flutter
  over what certainly promised to be a sensational deal.</p>
  <p>Alas! as with most of the beautiful possessions of this impoverished old
  world, the coveted prize was destined to go to the country that had the longest
  purse. A certain Mr. Aaron Jacobson, the Chicago multi-millionaire, presently
  cabled an offer of half a million dollars for the picture, an offer which,
  rumour had it, the Duc de Rochechouart had since accepted. Mr. Jacobs was
  said to be a charming, highly-cultured man, a great art connoisseur and a
  great art lover, and presently one heard that he had already set sail for
  Europe with the intention of fetching away his newly-acquired treasure himself.</p>
  <p>On the very day following Mr. Jacob&rsquo;s arrival as the guest of the
  Duc and Duchesse de Rochechouart at the latter&rsquo;s chateau, the world-famous
  picture was stolen in broad daylight by a thief or thieves who contrived
  to make away with their booty without leaving the slightest clue, so it was
  said, that might put the police on their track. The picture was cut clean
  out of the frame, an operation which must have taken at least two or three
  minutes. It always used to hang above the tall chimneypiece in the Duchesse&rsquo;s
  studio, but that self-same morning it had been lifted down and placed on
  an easel in the dining hall, no doubt for closer inspection by the purchaser.
  This easel stood in a corner of the hall, close to one of the great windows
  that overlooked the gardens of the chateau.</p>
  <p>The amazing point in this daring theft was that a garden fete and tennis
  tournament were in progress at the time. A crowd of guests was spread all
  over the lawns and grounds in full view of the windows of the hall, and,
  as far as the preliminary investigations were able to establish, there were
  not more than twenty or twenty-five minutes at most during which some servant
  or other inmate of the chateau had not either actually been through the hall
  or had occasion to observe the windows.</p>
  <p>The dining hall itself has monumental doors which open on the great central
  vestibule, and immediately facing it similar doors give on the library. The
  marble vestibule runs right through the centre of the main building, it has
  both a front and a garden entrance, and all the reception rooms open out
  of it, right and left. Close to the front door entrance is one of the main
  ways into the kitchens and offices.</p>
  <p>Now right away until half-past four on that fateful afternoon the servants
  were up and down the vestibule, busy with arrangements for tea which they
  were serving outside on the lawns. The tennis tournament was then drawing
  to a close, the Duchess was on the lawn with her guests, dispensing tea,
  and at half-past four precisely the Duc de Rochechouart came into the chateau
  by way of the garden entrance, went across the vestibule and into the library
  to fetch the prizes which were to be distributed to the victors in the tournament,
  and which were locked up in his desk. The doors of the dining hall were wide
  open and the Duc walking past them peeped into the room. The picture was
  in its place then, and he gave a glance at it as he passed, conscious of
  a pang of regret at thought that he must needs part with this precious treasure.
  It took the Duke some little time to sort the prizes, and as in the meanwhile
  the afternoon post had come in and a few letters had been laid on his desk,
  he could not resist the desire to glance through his correspondence. On the
  whole he thought that he might have been in the library about a quarter of
  an hour or perhaps more. He had closed the door when he entered the room,
  and when he came out again he certainly noticed that the doors of the dining-hall
  were shut. But there was nothing in this to arouse his suspicions, and with
  the neatly tied parcels containing the prizes under his arm, he recrossed
  the vestibule and went out once more into the garden.</p>
  <p>At five o&rsquo;clock M. Amede, the chief butler, had occasion to go into
  the dining hall to fetch a particular silver tray which he required. He owned
  to being astonished at finding the doors closed, because he had been past
  them a quarter of an hour before that and they were wide open then. However,
  he entered the room without any serious misgivings, but the next moment he
  nearly fainted with horror at sight of the empty frame upon the easel. The
  very first glance had indeed revealed the nefarious deed. The picture had
  not been moved out of its frame, it was the canvas that had been cut. M.
  Amede, however, knowing what was due to his own dignity did not disturb the
  entire household then and there; he made his way quietly back into the garden
  where the distribution of prizes after the tournament was taking place and,
  seizing a favourable opportunity, he caught M le Duc&rsquo;s eye and imparted
  to him the awful news.</p>
  <p>Even so nothing was said until after the guests had departed. By the Duke&rsquo;s
  orders the doors leading into the dining hall were locked, and to various
  enquiries after the masterpiece made by inquisitive ladies, the evasive answer
  was given that the picture was in the hands of the packers.</p>
  <p>There remained the house party, which, of course, included Mr. Aaron Jacobs.
  There were also several ladies and gentlemen staying at the chateau, and
  before they all went up to their rooms to dress for dinner, they were told
  what had happened. In the meanwhile the police had already been sent for,
  and M le Commissaire was conducting his preliminary investigations. The rooms
  and belongings of all the servants were searched, and, with the consent of
  the guests themselves, this search was extended to their rooms. A work of
  art worth half a million dollars could not thus be allowed to disappear and
  the thief to remain undetected for the sake of social conventions, and as
  the law stands in France any man may be guilty of a crime until he be proved
  innocent.</p>
  <h3 align="center"><b>2</b></h3>
  <p>The theft of the Ingres masterpiece was one of those cases which interest
  the public in every civilised country, and here in England where most people
  are bitten with the craze for criminal investigation it created quite a sensation
  in its way.</p>
  <p>I remember that when we all realised for the first time that the picture
  had in very truth disappeared, and that the French police, despite its much
  vaunted acumen, had entirely failed to find the slightest trace of the thief,
  we at once began to look about for a romantic solution of the mystery. M
  le Duc de Rochechouart and his pretty Duchess had above all our deepest sympathies,
  for it had very soon transpired that neither the Ingres masterpiece, nor
  indeed any of the Duke&rsquo;s valuable collection of art works, was insured.
  This fact seems almost incredible to English minds, with whom every kind
  of insurance is part and parcel of the ordinary household routine. But abroad
  the system is not nearly so far-reaching or so extended, and there are numberless
  households in every degree of the social scale who never dream of spending
  money on insurances save, perhaps, against fire.</p>
  <p>Be that as it may, the fact remained that &ldquo;La Fiancee&rdquo; was not
  insured against theft, and that through the action of an unknown miscreant
  the Duc and Duchesse de Rochechouart would, unless the police did ultimately
  succeed in tracing the stolen masterpiece, find themselves the poorer by
  half a million dollars. With their usual lack of logic, readers of the half-penny
  Press promptly turned their attention to Mr. Aaron Jacobs, the intending
  purchaser. Being a Chicago multi-millionaire does not, it appears, render
  a man immune from the temptation of acquiring by dishonest means the things
  which he covets. Anyway, the public decided that Mr. Jacobs was not so rich
  as he was reputed to be, but that, on the other hand, being as greedy for
  the possession of European works of art as any ogre for human flesh, he had
  stolen the picture which he could not afford to buy; and ten, or mayhap fifteen
  years hence, when the story of the mysterious theft will have been consigned
  to oblivion, Mr. Jacobs would display the masterpiece in his gallery. How
  this was to be accomplished without the subsequent intervention of the police
  those wiseacres did not attempt to explain.</p>
  <p>The mystery remained impenetrable for close on two years. Many other sensations,
  criminal or otherwise, had, during that time, driven the affair of the Ingres
  masterpiece out of the public mind. Then suddenly the whole story was revived
  and in a manner which proved far more exciting than anyone had surmised.
  It was linked&#8213; though the European public did not know this&#8213; with
  the death in July, 1919, of Charles B. Tupper, the head of one of the greatest
  cinematograph organizations in the States&#8213; a man who for the past few
  years had controlled over two thousand theatres, and had made millions in
  his day. Some time during the war he had married the well-known cinema star,
  Anita Hodgkins, a beautiful entirely uneducated girl who hailed from Upper
  Tooting. The will of Mr. Charles B. Tupper was proved for a fabulous sum,
  and, as soon as his affairs were settled, Mrs. Tupper, who presumably had
  remained Cockney at heart as well as in speech, set sail for England with
  the intention of settling down once more in the country of her birth. She
  bought Holt Manor, a magnificent house in Buckinghamshire, sent for all her
  splendid furniture and belongings from America, and, early in 1920, when
  her palatial residence was ready for occupation, she married Lord Polchester,
  a decadent young nincompoop, who was said to have fallen in love with her
  when he first saw her face on the screen.</p>
  <p>Presumably Mrs. Anita Tupper nee Hodgkins hugged herself with the belief
  that once she was styled my lady she would automatically become a social
  star as she had been a cinema one in the past. But in this harmless ambition
  she was at first disappointed. Though she had furnished her new house lavishly,
  though paragraphs appeared in all the halfpenny and weekly Press giving details
  of the sumptuous establishment of which the new Lady Polchester was queen,
  though she appeared during the London season of 1920 at several official
  functions and went to an evening Court that year, wearing pearls that might
  have been envied by an empress, she found that in Buckinghamshire the best
  people were shy of calling on her, and the bits of pasteboard that were from
  time to time left at her door came chiefly from the neighbouring doctors,
  parsons, or retired London tradespeople, or from mothers with marriageable
  daughters who looked forward to parties at the big house and consequent possible
  matrimonial prizes.</p>
  <p>This went on for a time and then Lady Polchester, wishing no doubt to test
  the intentions of the county towards her, launched out invitations for a
  garden party! The invitations included the London friends she had recently
  made, and a special train from Paddington was to bring those friends to the
  party. Among these was Mr. Aaron Jacobs. He had known the late Charles B.
  Tupper over in the States, and had met Lady Polchester more recently at one
  of the great functions at the United States Embassy in London. She had interested
  him with a glowing account of her splendid collection of works of art, of
  pictures and antique furniture which she had inherited from her first husband
  and which now adorned her house in Buckinghamshire, and when she asked him
  down to her party he readily accepted, more I imagine out of curiosity to
  see the objects in which he was as keenly interested as ever, than from a
  desire to establish closer acquaintanceship with the lady.</p>
  <p>The garden party at Holt Manor, as the place was called, does not appear
  to have been a great social success. For one thing it rained the whole afternoon,
  and the military band engaged for the occasion proved too noisy for indoor
  entertainment. But some of the guests were greatly interested in the really
  magnificent collection of furniture, tapestries, pictures and works of art
  which adorned the mansion, and after tea Lady Polchester graciously conducted
  them all over the house, pointing out herself the most notable pieces in
  the collection and never failing to mention the price at which the late Mr.
  Charles B. Tupper purchased the work of art in question.</p>
  <p>And that is when the sensation occurred. Following their hostess, the guests
  had already seen and duly admired two really magnificent Van Dycks that hung
  in the hall, when she turned to them and said, with a flourish of her plentifully
  be-gemmed hands;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You must come into the library and see the picture for which Mr.
  Tupper gave over half a million dollars. I never knew I had it, as he never
  had it taken out of its case, and I never saw it until this year when it
  came over with all my other things from our house in New York. Lord Polchester
  had it unpacked and hung in the library. I don&rsquo;t care much about it
  myself, and the late Mr. Tupper hadn&rsquo;t the time to enjoy his purchase,
  because he died two days after the picture arrived in New York, and, as I
  say, he never had it unpacked. He bought it for use in a commercial undertaking
  which he had in mind at one time, then the scheme fell through, and I am
  sure I never thought any more about the old picture.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>With that she led the way into the library, a nobly-proportioned room lined
  with books in choice bindings, and with a beautiful Adams chimneypiece, above
  which hung a picture.</p>
  <p>Of course there were some people present who had never heard of the stolen
  Ingres, but there must have been a few who, as they entered the room, must
  literally have gasped with astonishment, for there it certainly was. &ldquo;La
  Fiancee&rdquo; with her marvellously painted Eastern draperies, her exquisitely
  drawn limbs and enigmatic smile, was smiling down from the canvas, just as
  if she had every right to be in the house of the ex-cinema star, and as if
  there had not been a gigantic fuss about her throughout the whole art world
  of Europe.</p>
  <p>We may take it that the person by far the most astonished at that moment
  was Mr. Aaron Jacobs. But he was too thoroughly a gentleman and too much
  a man of the world to betray his feelings then, and I suppose that those
  who, like himself, had thought they recognised the stolen masterpiece, did
  not like to say anything either until they were more sure: English people
  in all grades of society being proverbially averse to being what they would
  call &ldquo;mixed up&rdquo; in any kind of a fuss. Certain it is that nothing
  was said at the moment to disturb Lady Polchester&rsquo;s complacent equanimity,
  and after a while the party broke up and the guests departed.</p>
  <p>Of course people thought that Mr. Aaron Jacobs should have informed Lord
  Polchester of his intentions before he went to the police. But Lord Polchester
  was such a nonentity in his own household, such a frivolous fool, and, moreover,
  addicted to drink and violent fits of temper, that those who knew him easily
  realised how a sensible business man like Mr. Aaron Jacobs would avoid any
  personal explanations with him.</p>
  <p>Mr. Jacobs went straight to the police that self-same evening, and the next
  day Lady Polchester had a visit from Detective Purley, one of the ablest
  as he was one of the most tactful men on the staff. But indeed he had need
  of all his tact in face of the infuriated cinema star when that lady realised
  the object of his visit.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How dared they come and ask her such impertinent questions?&rdquo; she
  stormed. &ldquo;Did they imagine she had stolen the beastly picture which
  she would as soon throw on the dust heap as look at again? She, who could
  buy up all the pictures in any gallery and not feel the pinch ...&rdquo; and
  so on; and so on. The unfortunate Purley had a very unpleasant quarter of
  an hour, but after a while he succeeded in pacifying the irate lady and got
  her to listen calmly to what he had to say.</p>
  <p>He managed to make her understand that without casting the slightest aspersion
  upon her honorability or that of the late Charles B. Tupper, there was no
  getting away from the fact that the picture now hanging in the library of
  Holt Manor was the property of the Duc de Rochechouart from whose house in
  France it was stolen over two years before&#8213; to be quite accurate it
  was stolen on July 25th, 1919.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then,&rdquo; retorted the lady, by no means convinced or mollified, &ldquo;I
  can prove you all to be liars, for the late Mr. Charles B. Tupper bought
  the old thing long before that. He had been on the continent in the spring
  of 1919 and landed in New York again on May 18th. He told me then that he
  had made some interesting purchases in Europe, amongst them there was a picture
  for which he had paid half a million dollars. I scolded him about it, us
  I thought he was throwing his money away on such stuff, but he said that
  he wanted to make use of the picture for some wonderful advertising scheme
  he had in his mind, so I said no more about it. But that is the picture you
  say was stolen from from some duke or other in July, when I tell you that
  it had been shipped for New York a month at least before that.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Perhaps at this point Detective Purley failed to conceal altogether a slight
  look of incredulity, for Lady Polchester turned on him once more like a fury.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So you still think I stole the dirty old picture, do you?&rdquo; she
  cried, using further language that is quite unprintable, &ldquo;and you think
  that I am such a ninny and that I will give it up simply because you are
  trying to bully me. But I won&rsquo;t, so there! I can prove the truth of
  every word I say, and I don&rsquo;t care if I have to spend another million
  dollars to put your old duke in prison for talking such rot about me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Once again Purley&rsquo;s tact had to come into play, and after a while
  he succeeded in soothing the lady&rsquo;s outraged feelings. With infinite
  patience he gradually got her to view the matter more calmly and above all
  not to look upon him as an enemy, but as a friend whose one desire was to
  throw light upon what certainly seemed an extraordinary mystery.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Very well, then,&rdquo; she said, after a while, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
  tell you all I can. I don&rsquo;t know when the picture was shipped from
  Europe but I do know that a case addressed to Mr. Charles B. Tupper and marked &lsquo;valuable
  picture with great care&rsquo; was delivered at our house in New York on
  July 18th. I can&rsquo;t mistake the date because Mr. Tupper was already
  very ill when the case arrived and he died two days later, that is on July
  20th, 1919. That you can ascertain easily enough, can&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; Lady
  Polchester added tartly. Then as Purley offered no comment she went on more
  quietly:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right, then. Now let me tell you that the case containing
  this picture was in my house two days before Mr. Tupper died, and that I
  never had it undone until a couple of months ago, here in this house. I had
  it shipped from New York, not along with all my things, but by itself; and
  there is the lawyer over there, Mr. George F. Topham, who can tell you all
  about the case. I was too upset what with Mr. Tupper&rsquo;s illness and
  then his death, and the will and the whole bag of tricks to trouble much
  about it myself, but I told the lawyer that it contained a picture for which
  Mr. Tupper had paid half a million dollars, and it was put down for probate
  for that amount; the lawyer took charge of the old thing, and he can swear,
  and lots of people over in the States can swear that the case was never undone.
  And the shipping company can swear that it never was touched whilst it was
  in their charge. They delivered it here and their men opened the case for
  us and helped us to hang the picture.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And now,&rdquo; concluded Lady Polchester, not because she had nothing
  more to say but presumably because she was out of breath, &ldquo;now perhaps
  you&rsquo;ll tell me how a picture which was over in New York on the 18th
  of July can have been stolen from France on the 25th; and if you can&rsquo;t
  tell me that, then I&rsquo;ll trouble you to clear out of my house, for I&rsquo;ve
  no use for Nosey Parkers about the place.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The unfortunate Purley had certainly, by all accounts, rather a rough time
  of it with the lady. Nor could he arrive at any satisfactory arrangement
  with her. Needless to say that she absolutely refused to give up the picture
  unless she were forced to do so by law, and even then, she dared say, she
  could make it very unpleasant for some people.</p>
  <h3 align="center"><b>3</b></h3>
  <p>The next event of any importance in this extraordinary case was the action
  brought by the Duc and Duchesse de Rochechouart here in England against Lady
  Polchester for illegal detention of their property.</p>
  <p>It very soon transpired that several witnesses had come over from the States
  in order to corroborate the lady&rsquo;s assertions with regard to her rightful
  ownership of the picture, and the public was once more on the tiptoe of expectation.</p>
  <p>The case came on for hearing in March and only lasted two days. The picture
  was in court and was identified first by the Duc and the Duchesse de Rochechouart
  and then by two or three experts as the genuine work of Ingres: &ldquo;La
  Fiancee&rdquo; known throughout the entire art world as having been purchased
  by the Duc&rsquo;s grandfather from the artist himself in 1850, and having
  been in the possession of the family uninterruptedly ever since. The Duc
  himself had last seen it in his own chateau at half past four on the afternoon
  of July 25, 1919.</p>
  <p>A well-known peculiarity about the masterpiece was that it had originally
  been painted on a somewhat larger canvas, and that the artist himself, at
  the request of the original purchaser, had it cut smaller and re-strained
  on a smaller stretcher; this alteration was, of course, distinctly visible
  on the picture. The frame was new; it was admittedly purchased by Lady Polchester
  recently. When the picture came into her possession it was unframed.</p>
  <p>On that lady&rsquo;s behalf on the other hand there was a formidable array
  of witnesses, foremost amongst these being Mr. Anthony Kleeberger, who was
  the late Charles B. Tupper&rsquo;s secretary and manager. He was the first
  to throw some fight on the original transaction whereby &ldquo;La Fiancee&rdquo; first
  came into his employer&rsquo;s possession.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mr. Tupper,&rdquo; he explained, &ldquo;was the inventor of a new
  process of colour photography which he desired to test and then to advertise
  all over the world by means of reproduction from some world-famous masterpiece,
  and when during the spring of 1919 I accompanied him to Europe, one of the
  objects which he had in mind was the purchase of a picture suitable for his
  purpose. It pretty soon was known all over the art world of the continent
  what we were after and that Mr. Tupper was prepared to pay a big price for
  his choice. You would be surprised if I were to tell you of some of the offers
  we had in Vienna, in London, even in Rome.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;At last, when we were staying in Paris, Mr. Tupper came to me one
  day and told me he had at last found the very picture he wanted. He had gone
  to the studio of a picture restorer who had written to him and offered him
  a genuine Ingres. He had seen the picture and liked it, and had agreed to
  give the owner half a million dollars for it. I thought this a terrific price
  and frankly I was a little doubtful whether my employer had a sufficient
  knowledge of art to enter into a transaction of this sort. I feared that
  he might be badly had, and buying some spurious imitation rather than a masterpiece.
  But Mr. Tupper was always a queer man in business. Once he had made up his
  mind there was no arguing with him. &lsquo;I like the picture,&rsquo; was
  all that he ever said to me in response to some timid suggestion on my part
  that he should seek expert advice, &lsquo;and I have agreed to buy it for
  half a million dollars, simply because the fellow would not part with it
  for less. I believe it to be genuine. But if it is not I don&rsquo;t care.
  It will answer my purpose and there it is.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He then gave me instructions to see about the packing and forwarding
  of the picture and this I did. I must say that I had terrible misgivings
  about the whole affair. I certainly thought the picture magnificent, but
  of course I am no judge. It had a worthless frame round it which I discarded
  in order to facilitate the packing. The picture restorer&rsquo;s studio was
  up a back street in the Montmartre quarter. He and his wife saw to the packing
  themselves; I never saw anybody else in the place. I arranged for the forwarding
  of the case, for the insurance and so on, and I myself handed over to the
  vendor, whose name was given to me as Matthieu Vignard, five hundred thousand
  dollar bills in the name and on account of my employer, Mr. Charles B. Tupper.
  Of course I presumed that the snuffy old man and his blousey wife were acting
  for some personage who desired to remain unknown, and as time went on and
  there was no talk in the art world or in the newspapers then about any great
  masterpiece being stolen, I soon forgot my misgivings, and a couple of months
  later I set out on Mr. Tupper&rsquo;s business for Central America where
  I remained for close on two years.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Half the time during those years I was up country in Costa Rica,
  Venezuela and so on where newspapers are scarce, and when the hue and cry
  was after a picture stolen from the house of the Duc de Rochechouart, I knew
  nothing about it. But this picture now in court is certainly the one which
  Mr. Tupper bought in Paris at the end of June 1919, and which I myself saw
  packed and nailed down in its case and forwarded to New York where it arrived
  two days before Mr. Tupper&rsquo;s death.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>That was the substance of Mr. Kleeberger&rsquo;s evidence, by far the most
  important heard on the first day of the action. After that the testimony
  of other witnesses went to confirm the whole story. There was the well-known
  New York solicitor, Mr. George F. Topham, who took charge of the picture
  after the death of his client, Mr. Tupper, and the managing director of the
  Nebraska Safe Deposit Company where it was stored until Lady Polchester sent
  for it. There were the managers of the shipping companies who forwarded the
  picture from Paris to New York in June&#8213;July 1919, and from New York
  to Holt Manor in the following year, and there were the removal men and servants
  who saw the picture unpacked and hung in the library at the Manor.</p>
  <p>It took two days to go through all that evidence, but it was never either
  conflicting or doubtful. Yet the one supreme, mysterious contradiction remained,
  namely, that the picture now in court, the wonderful Ingres masterpiece,
  was bought by Mr. Tupper in Paris in June 1919, and then and there shipped
  over by him to New York, and that, nevertheless, it was stated never to have
  left the Duc de Rochechouart&rsquo;s possession from the day when his grandfather
  bought it more than seventy years ago until that memorable twenty-fifth of
  July, 1919, when it was stolen on the very day it was about to pass into
  the possession of Mr. Aaron Jacobs. One felt one&rsquo;s head reeling when
  one thought out this amazing puzzle, and the decision of the learned judge
  was awaited with palpitating curiosity.</p>
  <p>But after the second day of the action, just before it was adjourned, counsel
  on both sides were able to announce that their respective clients had come
  to an exceedingly satisfactory arrangement. All aspersions as to the honorability
  of the late Charles B. Tupper or of Lady Polchester would be publicly withdrawn
  and a notice to that effect would appear in all the leading newspapers of
  London, Paris and New York; and Lady Polchester would now remain in undisputed
  possession of the Ingres masterpiece, having paid its rightful owner the
  Duc de Rochechouart the sum of one hundred and twenty thousand pounds for
  it.</p>
  <p>So both parties we may take it were completely satisfied; at one time it
  had looked as if the unfortunate duke would be done both out of his picture
  and out of the money, and another as if Lady Polchester would be so defrauded.
  But now all was well and the learned judge declared himself pleased with
  the agreement. Not so the public who were left to face a mystery which every
  one felt would never now be cleared up.</p>
  <p>I for one felt completely at sea, so much so indeed that my thoughts instinctively
  flew to the curious creature in the blameless tea-shop who I felt sure would
  have a theory of his own which would account for what was puzzling us all.</p>
  <p>And a day or two later I saw him, weaving a fantastic design of knots in
  a piece of string: He knew that I wished to hear his explanation of the mystery
  of the Ingres masterpiece, but he kept me on tenterhooks for some time, wearing
  out my patience with his sharp, sarcastic comments.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do you admit,&rdquo; he asked me at one time, with his exasperating
  chuckle, &ldquo;that the Ingres masterpiece could have been in two places
  at one and the same time?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, of course,&rdquo; I replied, &ldquo;I do not admit such nonsense.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Very well then,&rdquo; he resumed, &ldquo;what is the logical conclusion?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That there were two pictures,&rdquo; I said coldly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of course there were two pictures. And as the great Mr. Ingres did
  not presumably paint his masterpiece in duplicate, we must take it that one
  picture was the original and the other the copy.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Now it was my turn to grow sarcastic and I retorted drily:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Having done that, we are no nearer a solution of the mystery than
  we were before.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Are we not?&rdquo; he rejoined with a cackle like an old hen. &ldquo;Now
  it seems to me that when we have admitted that one of the pictures was a
  copy of the other, and when we know that the picture which Mr. Charles B.
  Tupper bought was the original, because that was the one that was produced
  in court, we must come to the conclusion that the one which was stolen from
  the chateau in France could only have been the copy.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why yes,&rdquo; I admitted, &ldquo;but then again we have been told
  that the grandfather of the present Duc de Rochechouart bought the picture
  from the artist himself, and that it has been in the uninterrupted possession
  of his family ever since.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And I am willing to admit that the picture was in the uninterrupted
  possession of the Duc de Rochechouart until the present holder of the title
  or someone who had access to it in the same way as himself sold it to Mr.
  Charles B. Tupper in June 1919.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But you don&rsquo;t mean&#8213;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Surely,&rdquo; the funny creature went on with his dry cackle, &ldquo;it
  was not such a very difficult little bit of dishonesty to perpetrate, seeing
  that Mme la Duchesse was such an accomplished artist. Can you not imagine
  the lady being like many of us, very short of money, and then hearing of
  Mr. Charles B. Tupper, the American business man who was searching Europe
  through for a world famous masterpiece; can you not see her during one of
  her husband&rsquo;s pleasure trips to Paris or elsewhere setting to work
  to make an exact replica of &ldquo;La Fiancee.&rdquo; We know that it always
  hung in her studio until the day when it was moved to the dining hall. Think
  how easy it was for her to substitute her own copy for the original. The
  only difficulty would be the conveying of the picture to Paris, but an artist
  knows how to take a canvas off its stretcher, to roll it up and re-strain
  it.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Here I think that she must have had a confederate, probably some
  down-at-heel friend of her past artistic days, a man whom she paid lavishly
  both for his help and his silence. Who that man was I suppose we shall never
  know. The so-called Matthew Vignard and his &lsquo;blousey wife,&rsquo; as
  Mr. Kleeberger picturesquely described her, have completely disappeared;
  no trace of them was ever found. They hired a studio at Montmartre for one
  month, paid the concierge the rent in advance, and at the end of that time
  they decamped and have never been heard of since, but unless I am much mistaken,
  they must at the present moment be carrying on a very lucrative little blackmailing
  business, because it must have been Vignard who conveyed the picture to Paris
  in the same way as we know it was he who first approached Charles B. Tupper
  and ultimately sold him the picture.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But surely,&rdquo; I objected, for the funny creature had paused
  a moment, and I could not deny that his arguments were sound, &ldquo;surely
  it would have been more practical to have sold the copy&#8213; which we suppose
  must have been perfect&#8213; to Mr. Tupper who was a layman and an outsider,
  and to have kept the original in the chateau, as the Duke was even then negotiating
  for its sale, and most of the art dealers were coming to have a look at it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He did not reply immediately but remained for a while deeply absorbed in
  the contemplation of his beloved bit of string.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That,&rdquo; he admitted with complacent condescension, &ldquo;would
  be a sound argument if we admit at once that the Duchesse knew for a certainty
  that her husband intended to sell &lsquo;La Fiancee.&rsquo; But my contention
  is that at the time that she sold the picture to Mr. Tupper she had no idea
  that the Duc had any such intentions. No doubt when she knew this for a fact,
  she must have been beside herself with horror; no doubt also that she had
  a hard fight with her own terror before she made a clean breast of her misdeed
  to her husband. Apparently she did not do this until the very last moment,
  until the day when the picture was actually taken out of her studio and placed
  upon an easel in the dining-hall for closer inspection. Then discovery was
  imminent and we must suppose that she made full confession.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The Duc, like a gallant gentleman, at once set his wits thinking
  how best to save his wife&rsquo;s reputation without endangering his own.
  To have admitted to Mr Aaron Jacobs and to the other experts and art dealers
  who had come to see the masterpiece that a Duc de Rochechouart was trying
  to sell a spurious imitation whilst having already disposed of the original
  was, of course, unthinkable; and thus the idea presented itself to their
  Graces that the copy must be made to disappear effectually. A favourable
  circumstance for the success of this scheme was the garden fete which was
  to take place that afternoon, when the house would be full of guests, of
  strangers and of servants, when surveillance would be slack and the comings
  and goings of the master of the house would easily pass unperceived.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The Duke, in my opinion, chose that one quarter of an hour when he
  was alone in the house to cut the picture out of its frame. He then hid the
  canvas sufficiently skilfully that it was never found. Probably he thought
  at the time that there the matter would end, but equally probably he never
  gave the future another thought. His own position was unassailable seeing
  he was not insured against loss, and it was the present alone that mattered:
  the fact that a Duc de Rochechouart was trying to sell a spurious picture
  for half a million dollars. To many French men and women ever since the war,
  America is a far country, and no doubt the Duc and Duchesse both hoped that
  the whole transaction, including the Ingres masterpiece, would soon lie buried
  somewhere at the bottom of the sea.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Fate and Lady Polchester proved too strong for them; they ordained
  that &lsquo;La Fiancee&rsquo; should be brought back to Europe, and that
  the whole of its exciting history be revived. But fate proved kind in the
  end, and I think that you will agree with me that two such daring and resourceful
  adventurers as their Graces deserve the extra half million dollars which,
  thanks to Lady Polchester&rsquo;s generosity or ostentation, they got unexpectedly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Soon afterwards you will remember that the Duc a Duchesse de Rochechouart
  sold their chateau on the Oise together with the bulk of their collection
  of pictures and furniture.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;They now live in Sweden, I understand, where the Duchesse has many
  friends and relations and where the law of libel will not trouble you much
  if you publish my deductions in your valuable magazine.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Think it all out,&rdquo; the Man in the Corner concluded glibly &ldquo;and
  from every point of view, and you will see that there is not a single flaw
  in my argument. I have given you the only possible solution of the mystery</p>
  <p>of the Ingres masterpiece.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You may be right&#8213;&rdquo; I murmured thoughtfully.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I know I am,&rdquo; he answered drily.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="TheMysteryOfThePearlNecklace"></a>The Mystery Of The Pearl Necklace</b> </h2>
  <h3 align="center"><b>1</b></h3>
  <p>The Man in the Corner had a very curious theory about that mysterious affair
  of the pearl necklace, and though it all occurred a few years ago, I am tempted
  to put his deductions down on record, because, as far as I know, neither
  the police of this or any other country, nor the public, have ever found
  a satisfactory solution for what was undoubtedly a strange and mystifying
  adventure.</p>
  <p>I remembered the case quite well when first he spoke to me about it one
  afternoon in what had become my favourite tea-haunt in Fleet Street; the
  only thing I was not quite certain of was the identity of the august personage
  to whom the pearl necklace was to be presented. I do know, of course, that
  she belonged to one of the reigning families of Europe, and that she had
  been an active and somewhat hot-headed and bitter opponent of the communist
  movement in her own country, in consequence of which both she and her exalted
  husband had been the object of more than one murderous attack by the other
  side. It was on the occasion of the august lady&rsquo;s almost miraculous
  escape from a peculiarly well-planned and brutal assault that a number of
  ladies in England subscribed the sum of &pound;15,000 for the purchase of
  an exquisite pearl necklace to be presented to her as a congratulatory gift.</p>
  <p>Rightly or wrongly, the donors of this princely gift feared that a certain
  well-known political organisation on the Continent would strive by every
  means in its power, fair or foul, to prevent this token of English goodwill
  from reaching the recipient, and also, as it chanced to happen, there had
  been during the past few months a large number of thefts of valuables on
  continental railways, and it became a question who should be entrusted by
  the committee of subscribers with the perilous task of taking the necklace
  over for presentation; the trouble being further enhanced by the fact that
  in those days the insurance companies barred one or two European countries
  from their comprehensive policies against theft and petty larceny, and that
  it was to one of those countries thus barred that the bearer of the &pound;15,000
  necklace would have to journey.</p>
  <p>Imagine the excitement, the anxiety, which reigned in the hearts of the
  thousands of middle-class English women who had subscribed their mite towards
  the gift! Their committee sat behind closed doors discussing the claims of
  various volunteers who were ready to undertake the journey: these worthy
  folk were quite convinced that certain well-known leaders of anarchical organisations
  would be on the lookout for the booty and would have special facilities for
  the theft of it at the frontier during the course of those endless customs
  and passport formalities for which that particular country was ever famous.</p>
  <p>Finally the committee&rsquo;s choice fell upon a certain Captain Arthur
  Saunders, nephew of Sir Montague Bowden, who was chairman of the ladies&rsquo; committee.
  Captain Saunders had, it seems, travelled abroad a great deal, and his wife
  was foreign&#8213; Swedish, so it was understood; it was thought that if
  he went abroad now in the company of his wife, the object of their journey
  might be thought to be a visit to Mrs. Saunders&rsquo;s relations, and the
  conveying of the pearl necklace to its destination might thus remain more
  or less a secret.</p>
  <p>The choice was approved of by all the subscribers, and it was decided that
  Captain and Mrs. Saunders should start by the 10 am train for Paris on the
  16th of March. Captain Saunders was to call the previous afternoon at a certain
  bank in Charing Cross where the necklace was deposited, and there receive
  it as an almost sacred trust from the hands of the manager. Further, it was
  arranged that Mrs. Saunders should, immediately on arrival in Paris, send
  a wire to Mrs. Berners, a great friend of hers who was the secretary of the
  committee, and in fact that she should keep the committee informed of Captain
  Saunders&rsquo;s wellbeing at all the more important points of their journey.</p>
  <p>And thus they started.</p>
  <p>But no news came from Paris on the 16th. At first no anxiety was felt on
  that score, everyone being ready to surmise that the Calais-Paris train had
  been late in, and that the Saunders&rsquo;s had perhaps only barely time
  to clear their luggage at the Customs and catch the train de luxe which would
  take them on, via Cologne, without a chance of sending the promised telegram.
  But soon after midday of the 17th, Sir Montague Bowden had a wire from Mrs.
  Saunders from Paris saying: &ldquo;Arthur disappeared since last night. Desperately
  anxious. Please come at once. Save booked room for you here. Mary. Hotel
  Majestic.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The news was terrifying; however Sir Montague Bowden, with commendable
  zeal, at once wired to Mary announcing his immediate departure for Paris,
  and as it was then too late for him to catch the afternoon continental train,
  he started by the evening one, travelling all night and arriving at the Hotel
  Majestic in the early morning. He had thought it more prudent to say nothing
  about the matter before he left England. The news, he thought, would travel
  fast enough when it became necessary for the members of the committee to
  know what had occurred, and for the present, at any rate. Sir Montague was
  still hoping that as soon as he arrived in Paris he would find that the whole
  thing was only an ugly nightmare.</p>
  <p>As soon as he had had a bath and some breakfast he went in search of information.
  He found that the French police had already the &ldquo;affaire&rdquo; in
  hand, but that they had not so far the slightest clue to the mysterious disappearance
  of the Capitaine Saunders. He found the management of the Majestic in a state
  of offended dignity, and Mrs. Saunders in one that verged on hysteria, but
  fortunately he also found at the hotel a Mr. Haasberg, brother of Mrs. Saunders,
  a Swedish business man of remarkable coolness and clearness of judgment,
  who promptly put him au fait of what had occurred.</p>
  <p>It seems that Mr. Haasberg was settled in business in Paris, and that he
  had hoped to catch a glimpse of his sister and brother-in-law on the evening
  of the 16th at the Gare du Nord, on their way through to the East, but that
  on that very morning he had received a telegram from Mary asking him to book
  a couple of rooms&#8213; a bedroom and a sitting-room&#8213; for one night
  for them at the Hotel Majestic. This Mr. Haasberg did, glad enough that he
  would see something more of his sister than he had been led to hope.</p>
  <p>On the afternoon of the 16th he was kept late at business and was unable
  to meet the Saunders&rsquo;s at the station, but towards nine o&rsquo;clock
  he walked to the Majestic hoping to find them in. Their room was on
  the third floor. Mr. Haasberg went up in the lift, and as soon as he reached
  No. 301 he became aware of a buzz of conversation coming from within, which,
  however, ceased as soon as he had pushed open the door. On entering the room
  he saw that Captain Saunders had a visitor, a tall, thick-set man who wore
  an old fashioned heavy moustache, and large, gold-rimmed spectacles. At sight
  of Mr. Haasberg the man clapped his hat&#8213; a bowler&#8213; on his head,
  pulled his coat collar over his ears, and with a hasty: &ldquo;Well&#8213; s&rsquo;long,
  old man. I&rsquo;ll wait till tomorrow!&rdquo; spoken with a strong foreign
  accent, he walked rapidly out of the room and down the corridor. Haasberg
  stood for a moment in the doorway to watch the disappearing personage but
  he did this without any ulterior motive or thought of suspicion; then he
  turned back into the room and greeted his brother-in-law.</p>
  <p>Saunders seemed to Haasberg to be nervous and ill-at-ease; in response to
  the latter&rsquo;s inquiry after Mary, he explained that she had remained
  in her room as he had a man to see on business. Haasberg made some casual
  remark about this visitor, and then Mary Saunders came in&#8213; she too
  appeared troubled and agitated and as soon as she had greeted her brother,
  she turned to her husband and asked very eagerly:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, has he gone?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Saunders, giving a significant glance in Haasberg s direction, replied with
  an obvious effort at indifference: &ldquo;Yes, yes, he&rsquo;s gone. But
  he said he would be back tomorrow.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>At which Mary seemed to give a sigh of relief.</p>
  <p>Scenting some uncomfortable mystery Haasberg questioned her and also Saunders
  about their visitor, but could not elicit any satisfactory explanation.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, there is nothing mysterious about old Pasquier,&rdquo; was all
  that either of them would say.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He is an old pal of Arthur&rsquo;s,&rdquo; Mary added lightly, &ldquo;but
  he is such an awful bore that I got Arthur to say that I was out, so that
  he might get rid of him more quickly.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But somehow Haasberg felt that these explanations were very lame. He could
  not get it out of his head that there was something mysterious about the
  visitor, and knowing the purpose of the Saunders&rsquo;s journey, he thought
  it as well to give them a very serious word of warning about continental
  hotels generally and to suggest that they should, after this stay in Paris,
  go straight through in the train de luxe and never halt again until the &pound;15,000
  necklace was safely in the hands of the august lady for whom it was intended.
  But both Arthur and Mary laughed at these words of warning.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My dear fellow,&rdquo; Arthur said, seemingly rather in a huff, &ldquo;we
  are not such mugs as you think us. Mary and I have travelled on the continent
  at least as much as you have, and are fully alive to the dangers attendant
  upon our mission. As a matter of fact, the moment we arrived, I gave the
  necklace in its own padlocked tin box, just as I brought it over from England
  in charge of the hotel management, who immediately locked it up in their
  strong room, so even if good old Pasquier had designs on it&#8213; which
  I can assure you he has not&#8213; he would stand no chance of getting hold
  of it. And now do sit down, there&rsquo;s a good chap, and talk of something
  else.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Only half reassured, Haasberg sat down and had a chat. But he did not stay
  long. Mary was obviously tired and soon said good night. Arthur offered to
  accompany his brother-in-law to the latter&rsquo;s lodgings in the Rue de
  Moncigny.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I would like a walk,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;before going to bed.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>So the two men walked out together and Haasberg finally said good night
  to Arthur just outside his own lodgings. It was then close upon ten o&rsquo;clock.
  The little party had agreed to spend the next day together, as the train
  de luxe did not go until the evening and Haasberg had promised to take a
  holiday from business. Before going to bed he attended to some urgent correspondence,
  and had just finished a letter when his telephone bell rang. To his horror
  he heard his sister&rsquo;s voice speaking in the greatest possible distress
  and anxiety;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t keep Arthur up so late, Herman,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I
  am dog tired and can&rsquo;t go to sleep until he returns.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Arthur?&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;but Arthur left me at my door two
  hours ago.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He has not returned,&rdquo; she insisted, &ldquo;and I am getting
  anxious.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of course you are, but he can&rsquo;t be long now. He must have turned
  into a cafe and forgot the time. Do ring me up as soon as he comes in.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Unable to rest, however, and once more vaguely anxious, Haasberg went hastily
  back to the Majestic. He found Mary nearly distracted with anxiety, and as
  he himself felt anything but reassured, he did not know how to comfort her.
  At one time he went down into the hall to ascertain whether anything was
  known in the hotel about Saunders&rsquo;s movements earlier in the evening,
  but at this hour of the night there was only the night porter and the watchmen
  about, and they knew nothing of what had occurred before they came on duty.</p>
  <p>There was nothing for it but to await the morning as calmly as possible.
  This was difficult enough as Mary Saunders was evidently in a terrible state
  of agitation. She was quite certain that something tragic had happened to
  her husband, but Haasberg tried in vain to get her to speak of the mysterious
  visitor who had from the first aroused his own suspicions. Mary persisted
  in asserting that the visitor was just an old pal of Arthur&rsquo;s and that
  no possible suspicion of any kind could possibly rest upon him.</p>
  <p>In the early morning Haasberg went off to the nearest commissariat of police.
  They took the matter in hand without delay and within the hour had obtained
  some valuable information from the personnel of the hotel. To begin with
  it was established that at about ten minutes past ten the previous evening,
  that is to say a quarter of an hour or so after Haasberg had parted from
  Arthur Saunders outside his own lodgings, the latter had returned to the
  Majestic and at once asked for the tin box which he had deposited in the
  bureau. There was some difficulty in acceding to his request, because the
  clerk who was in charge of the keys of the strong room could not at once
  be found. However, M le Capitaine was so insistent that search was made for
  the clerk who presently appeared with the keys, and after the usual formalities
  handed over the tin box to Saunders who signed a receipt for it in the book.
  Haasberg had since then identified the signature which was quite clear and
  incontestable.</p>
  <p>Saunders then went upstairs, refusing to take the lift, and five minutes
  later he had come down again, nodded to the hall porter and went out of the
  hotel. No one had seen him since, but during the course of the morning the
  valet on the fourth floor had found an empty tin box in the gentlemen&rsquo;s
  cloak-room. This box was produced, and to her unutterable horror Mary Saunders
  recognised it as the one which had held the pearl necklace.</p>
  <p>The whole of this evidence as it gradually came to light was a staggering
  blow both to Mary and to Haasberg himself, because until this moment neither
  of them had thought that the necklace was in jeopardy: they both believed
  that it was safely locked up in the strong room ofthe hotel.</p>
  <p>Haasberg now feared the worst. He blamed himself terribly for not having
  made more certain of the mysterious visitor&rsquo;s identity. He had not
  yet come to the point of accusing his brother-in-law, in his mind, of a conspiracy
  to steal the necklace, but frankly, at this stage, he did not know what to
  think. Saunders&rsquo;s conduct had&#8213; to say the least&#8213; been throughout
  extremely puzzling. Why had he elected to spend the night in Paris, when
  all arrangements had been made for him and his wife to travel straight through?
  Who was the mysterious visitor with the walrus moustache, vaguely referred
  to by both Arthur and Mary as &ldquo;old Pasquier&rdquo;? And above all why
  had Arthur withdrawn the necklace from the hotel strong room where it was
  quite safe and, with it in his pocket, walked about the streets of Paris
  at that hour of the night?</p>
  <p>Haasberg was quite convinced that &ldquo;old Pasquier&rdquo; knew something
  about the whole affair, but, strangely enough, Mary persisted in asserting
  that he was quite harmless, and an old friend of Arthur&rsquo;s who was beyond
  suspicion. When further pressed with questions she declared that she had
  no idea where the man lodged, and that, in fact, she believed that he had
  left Paris the self-same evening en route for Brussels where he was settled
  in business.</p>
  <p>Enquiry amongst the personnel of the hotel revealed the fact that Captain
  Saunders&rsquo;s visitor had been seen by the hall porter when he came soon
  after half-past eight, and asked whether le Capitaine Saunders had finished
  dinner; his question being answered in the affirmative, he went upstairs,
  refusing to take the lift. Half an hour or so later he was seen by one of
  the waiters in the lounge hurriedly crossing the hall, and finally by the
  two boys in attendance at the swing doors when he went out of the hotel.
  All agreed that the man was very tall and thick-set, that he wore a heavy
  moustache and a pair of gold-rimmed spectacles. He had on a bowler hat and
  an overcoat with the collar pulled right up to his ears. The hall porter
  who himself spoke English fairly well, was under the impression that the
  man was not English, although he made his enquiries in that language.</p>
  <p>In addition to all these investigations, the commissaire de police, on his
  second visit to the hotel, was able to assure Haasberg that all the commissariats
  in and around Paris had been communicated with by telephone so as to ascertain
  whether any man answering Saunders&rsquo;s description had been injured during
  the night in a street accident and taken in somewhere for shelter; also that
  a description of the necklace had already been sent round to all the <i>Monts
  de Pieds</i> throughout the country. The police were also sharply on the
  lookout for the man with the walrus moustache, but so far without success.
  Whether he had left for Brussels by the last train on the previous night
  could not be definitely established, nor when or by what route he had arrived
  in Paris. There are always such crowds at the Gare du Nord for the arrival
  and departure of important trains that any man can easily&#8213; if he wishes&#8213; pass
  unperceived. And Mary Saunders obstinately persisted in her denial of any
  knowledge about him. &ldquo;Arthur,&rdquo; she said &ldquo;sometimes saw
  old Pasquier in London&rdquo;; but she did not know anything about him, neither
  what his nationality was, nor where he lodged. She did not know when he had
  left London, nor where he could be found in Paris. All that she knew, so
  she said, was that his name was Pasquier, and that he was in business in
  Brussels; she therefore concluded that he was Belgian. Even to her own brother
  she would not say more, although he succeeded in making her understand how
  strange her attitude must appear both to the police and to her friends, and
  what harm she was doing to her husband, but at this she burst into floods
  of tears, and swore that she knew nothing about Pasquier&rsquo;s whereabouts,
  and that she believed him to be innocent of any attempt to steal the necklace
  or to injure Arthur.</p>
  <p>There was nothing more to be said for the present and Haasberg sent the
  telegram in his sister&rsquo;s name to Sir Montague Bowden because he felt
  that someone less busy than himself should look after the affair and be a
  comfort to Mary, whose mental condition appeared pitiable in the extreme.
  In this first interview he was able to assure Sir Montague that everything
  had been done to trace the whereabouts of Arthur Saunders, and also of the
  necklace of which the unfortunate man had been the custodian; and it was
  actually while the two men were talking the whole case over that Haasberg
  received an intimation from the police that they believed the missing man
  had been found: at any rate would Monsieur give himself the trouble to come
  round to the commissariat at once.</p>
  <p>This, of course, Haasberg did, accompanied by Sir Montague, and at the commissariat,
  to their horror they found the unfortunate Saunders in a terrible condition.
  Briefly the commisssaire explained to them that about a quarter past ten
  last night an agent de police, making his rounds, saw a man crouching in
  the angle of a narrow blind alley that leads out of the Rue de Moncigny.
  On being shaken up by the agent the man struggled to his feet, but he appeared
  quite dazed and unable to reply to any questions that were put to him. He
  was then conveyed to the nearest commissariat where he spent the night. He
  was obviously suffering from loss of memory; and could give no account of
  himself, nor were any papers of identification found upon him, not even a
  visiting card, but close beside him, on the pavement where he was crouching,
  the agent had picked up a handkerchief which was saturated with chloroform.
  The handkerchief bore the initials A. S. The man, of course, was Arthur Saunders.
  What had happened to him it was impossible to ascertain. He certainly did
  not appear to be physically hurt, although from time to time when Mr. Haasberg
  or Sir Montague tried to question him he passed his hand across the back
  of his head, and an expression of pathetic puzzlement came into his eyes.</p>
  <p>His two friends, after the usual formalities of identification, were allowed
  to take him back to the Hotel Majestic where he was restored to the arms
  of his anxious wife; the English doctor, hastily summoned, could not find
  any trace of injury about the body, only the head appeared rather tender
  when touched. The doctor&rsquo;s theory was that Saunders had probably been
  sandbagged first and then rendered more completely insensible by means of
  the chloroformed handkerchief, and that excitement, anxiety and the blow
  on the head had caused temporary loss of memory which quietude and good nursing
  would soon put right. In the meanwhile of the &pound;15,000 necklace there
  was not the slightest trace.</p>
  <h3 align="center"><b>2</b></h3>
  <p>Unfortunately the disappearance of so valuable a piece of jewellery was
  one of those cases that could not be kept out of public knowledge. The matter
  was of course in the hands of the French police, and they had put themselves
  in communication with their English confreres, and the consternation&#8213; not
  to say the indignation&#8213; amongst the good ladies who had subscribed
  the money for the gift to the august lady was unbounded. Everybody was blaming
  everybody else; the choice of Captain Saunders as the accredited messenger
  was now severely criticised; pointed questions were asked as to his antecedents,
  as to his wife&rsquo;s foreign relations, and it was soon found that very
  little was known about either. Of course everybody knew that he was Sir Montague
  Bowden&rsquo;s nephew, and that, thanks to his uncle&rsquo;s influence, he
  had obtained a remunerative and rather important post in the office of one
  of the big Insurance Companies. But what his career had been before that
  no one knew. Some people said that he had fought in South Africa and later
  on had been correspondent for one of the great dailies during the Russo-Japanese
  war; altogether there seemed no doubt that he had been something of a rolling
  stone.</p>
  <p>Rather tardily the committee was taken severely to task for having entrusted
  so important a mission to a man who was either a coward or a thief, or both,
  for at first no one doubted that Saunders had met a confederate in Paris
  and had handed over the necklace to him, whilst he himself enacted a farce
  of being waylaid, chloroformed and robbed, and subsequently of losing his
  memory.</p>
  <p>But presently another version of the mystery was started by some amateur
  detective, and it found credence with quite a good many people. This was
  that Sir Montague Bowden had connived at the theft with Mrs. Saunders&rsquo;s
  relations; that the man with the walrus moustache either did not exist at
  all or was in very truth a harmless old friend of Captain Saunders, and that
  it was Haasberg who had induced his brother-in-law to withdraw the necklace
  from the hotel strong room and to bring it to the Rue de Moncigny; that in
  fact it was that same perfidious Swede who had waylaid the credulous Englishman,
  chloroformed and robbed him of the precious necklace.</p>
  <p>In the meanwhile the police in England had, of course, been communicated
  with by their French confreres, but before they could move in the matter
  or enjoin discretion on all concerned, an enterprising young man on the staff
  of the Express Post had interviewed Miss Elizabeth Spicer who was the parlourmaid
  at the Saunders&rsquo;s flat in Sloane Street.</p>
  <p>That young lady it seems had something to say about a gentleman named Pasquier
  who was not an infrequent visitor at the flat. She described him as a fine,
  tall gentleman who wore large gold-rimmed spectacles and a full military
  moustache. It seems that the last time Miss Elizabeth saw him was two days
  before her master and mistress&rsquo;s departure for abroad. Mr. Pasquier
  called late that evening and stayed till past ten o&rsquo;clock. When Elizabeth
  was rung for in order to show him out, he was saying goodbye to the Captain
  in the hall, and she heard him say &ldquo;in his funny foreign way,&rdquo; as
  she put it:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, I shall be in Paris as soon as you. Tink it over, my friend.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And on the top of that came the story told by Henry Tidy, Sir Montague Bowden&rsquo;s
  butler. According to him Captain Saunders called at Sir Montague Bowden&rsquo;s
  house in Lowndes Street on the afternoon of the 15th. The two gentlemen remained
  closeted together in the library for nearly an hour when Tidy was summoned
  to show the visitor out. Sir Montague, it seems, went to the front door with
  his nephew, and as the latter finally wished him goodbye Sir Montague said
  to him:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My dear boy, you can take it from me that there&rsquo;s nothing to
  worry about, and in any case I am afraid that it is too late to make any
  fresh arrangements.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s because of Mary,&rdquo; the Captain rejoined; &ldquo;she
  has made herself quite ill over it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The journey will do her good,&rdquo; Sir Montague went on pleasantly, &ldquo;but
  if I were you I would have a good talk with your brother-in-law. He must
  know his Paris well. Take my advice and spend the night at the Majestic;
  you can always get rooms there.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>This conversation Tidy heard quite distinctly, and he related the whole
  incident both to the journalist and to the police. After that the amateur
  investigators of crime were divided into two camps: there were those who
  persisted in thinking that Pasquier and Saunders, and probably Mrs. Saunders
  also, had conspired together to steal the necklace, and that Saunders had
  acted the farce of being waylaid and robbed and losing his memory; they based
  their deductions on Elizabeth Spicer&rsquo;s evidence and on Mary Saunders&rsquo;s
  extraordinary persistence in trying to shield the mysterious Pasquier. But
  other people, getting hold of Henry Tidy&rsquo;s story, deduced from it that
  it was indeed Sir Montague Bowden who had planned the whole thing in conjunction
  with Haasberg, since it was he who had persuaded Saunders to spend the night
  in Paris, thus giving his accomplice the opportunity of assaulting Saunders
  and stealing the necklace. To these wiseacres &ldquo;old Pasquier&rdquo; was
  indeed a harmless old pal of Arthur&rsquo;s, whose presence that evening
  at the Majestic was either a fable invented by Haasberg, or one quite innocent
  in purpose. In vain did Sir Montague try to explain away Tidy&rsquo;s evidence.
  Arthur, he said, had certainly called on him that last afternoon, but what
  he seemed worried about was his wife&rsquo;s health; he feared that she would
  not be strong enough to undertake the long journey without a break, so Sir
  Montague advised him to spend the night in Paris and in any case to talk
  the matter over with Mary&rsquo;s brother.</p>
  <p>The conversation overheard by Tidy could certainly admit of this explanation,
  but it did not satisfy the many amateur detectives who preferred to see a
  criminal in the chairman of the committee rather than a harmless old gentleman,
  as eager as themselves to find a solution of the mystery. And while people
  argued and wrangled there was no news of the necklace, and none of the man
  with the walrus moustache. No doubt that worthy had by now shaved off his
  hirsute adornment and grown a beard. He had certainly succeeded in evading
  the police; whether he had gone to Brussels or succeeded in crossing the
  German frontier no one could say, but his disappearance certainly bore out
  the theory of his being the guilty party with the connivance of Saunders,
  as against the Bowden-Haasberg theory.</p>
  <p>As for the necklace it had probably been already taken to pieces and the
  pearls would presently be disposed of one by one to unscrupulous continental
  dealers, when the first hue and cry after them had died away.</p>
  <p>Captain Saunders was said to be slowly recovering from his loss of memory
  and subsequent breakdown. Every one at home was waiting to hear what explanation
  he would give of his amazing conduct in taking the necklace out of the hotel
  strong room late that night and sallying forth with it into the streets of
  Paris at that hour. The explanation came after about a fortnight of suspense
  in a letter from Mary to her friend Mrs. Berners.</p>
  <p>Arthur, she said, had told her that on the fateful evening, after he parted
  from Mr. Haasberg in the Rue de Moncigny, he had felt restless and anxious
  about what the latter had told him on the subject of foreign hotels, and
  he was suddenly seized with the idea that the necklace was not safe in the
  care of the management of the Majestic, because there would come a moment
  when he would have to claim the tin box and this would probably be handed
  over to him when the hall of the hotel was crowded, and the eyes of expert
  thieves would then follow his every movement. Therefore he went back to the
  hotel, claimed the tin box, and as the latter was large and cumbersome, he
  got rid of it in one of the cloak-rooms of the hotel, slipped the necklace
  in its velvet case in the pocket of his overcoat and went out with the intention
  of asking Haasberg to take care of it for him, and only to hand it back to
  him when on the following evening the train de luxe was on the point of starting.
  He had been in sight of Haasberg&rsquo;s lodgings when, without the slightest
  warning, a dull blow on the back of his head coming he knew not whence, robbed
  him of consciousness.</p>
  <p>This explanation, however, was voted almost unanimously to be very false,
  and it was, on the whole, as well that the Saunders&rsquo;s had decided to
  remain abroad for a time. The ladies especially&#8213; and above all those
  who had put their money together for the necklace&#8213; were very bitter
  against him. At best, they averred, he had proved himself a despicable coward
  as well as a fool, and in any case he had failed in his trust. On the other
  hand Sir Montague Bowden was having a very rough time of it; he had already
  had one or two very unpleasant word-tussles with some outspoken friends of
  his, and there was talk of a slander action that would certainly be a cause
  celebre when it came on. Thus the arguments went on in endless succession
  until one day&#8213; well do I remember the excitement that spread throughout
  the town as soon as the incident became known&#8213; there was a terrible
  row in one of the big clubs in Piccadilly. Sir Montague Bowden was insulted
  by one of his fellow members: he was called a thief, and asked what share
  he was getting out of the sale of the necklace. Of course the man who spoke
  in this unwarrantable fashion was drunk at the time, but nevertheless it
  was a terrible position for Sir Montague, because as his opponent grew more
  and more abusive and he himself more and more indignant, he realised that
  he had practically no friends who would stand by him in the dispute. Some
  of the members tried to stop the row and others appeared indifferent, but
  no one sided with him, or returned abuse for abuse on his behalf.</p>
  <p>It was in the very midst of this most unedifying scene&#8213; one perhaps
  unparalleled in the annals of London club life&#8213; that a club servant
  entered the room, and handed a telegram to Sir Montague Bowden.</p>
  <p>Even the most sceptical there, and those whose brains were almost fuddled
  with the wrangling and the noise, declared afterwards that a mysterious Providence
  had ordained that the telegram should arrive at that precise moment. It had
  been sent to Sir Montague&rsquo;s private house in Lowndes Street; his secretary
  had opened it and sent it on to the club. As soon as Sir Montague had mastered
  its contents he communicated them to the member of the club, and it seems
  that there never had been such excitement displayed in any assembly of sober
  Englishmen as was shown in that club room on this momentous occasion.</p>
  <p>The telegram had come all the way from the other end of Europe, and had
  been sent by the august lady in whose hands the priceless necklace, about
  which there was so much pother in England and France, had just been safely
  placed. It ran thus:</p>
  <p class="note">&ldquo;Deeply touched by exquisite present just received through kind offices
  of Captain Saunders, from English ladies! Kind thoughts and beautiful necklace
  equally precious. Kindly convey my grateful thanks to all subscribers.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Having read out the telegram Sir Montague Bowden demanded an apology from
  those who had impugned his honour, and I understand that he got an unqualified
  one. After that, male tongues were let loose; the wildest conjectures flew
  about as to the probable solution of what appeared a more curious mystery
  than ever. By evening the papers had got hold of the incident, and all those
  who were interested in the affair shook their heads and looked portentously
  wise. But the hero of the hour was certainly Captain Saunders. From having
  been voted either a knave or a fool or both, he was declared all at once
  to be possessed of all the qualities which had made England great: prudence,
  astuteness and tenacity. However, as a matter of fact, nobody knew what had
  actually happened; the august lady had the necklace and Captain Saunders
  was returning to England without a stain on his character, but as to how
  these two eminently satisfactory results had come about, not even the wiseacres
  could say.</p>
  <p>Captain and Mrs. Saunders arrived in England a few days later; every one
  was agog with curiosity, and the poor things had hardly stepped out of the
  train before they were besieged by newspaper men and pressed with questions.
  The next morning the <i>Express Post</i> and the Daily Thunderer came out
  with exclusive interviews with Captain Saunders who had made no secret of
  the extraordinary adventure which had once more placed him in possession
  of the necklace. It seems that he and his wife on coming out of the Madeleine
  Church on Easter Sunday were hustled at the top of the steps by a man whose
  face they did not see, and who pushed past them very hastily and roughly.
  Arthur Saunders at once thought of his pockets and looked to see if his note-case
  had not disappeared. To his boundless astonishment his hand came in contact
  with a long, hard parcel in the outside pocket of his overcoat, and this
  parcel proved to be the velvet case containing the missing necklace. Both
  he and his wife were flabbergasted at this discovery, and, scarcely believing
  in this amazing piece of good luck, they managed with the help of Mr. Haasberg,
  despite its being Easter Sunday, to obtain an interview with one of the great
  jewellers in the Rue de la Paix, who, well knowing the history of the missing
  necklace, was able to assure them that they had indeed been lucky enough
  to regain possession of their treasure. That same evening they left by the
  train de luxe, having been fortunate enough to secure seats; needless to
  say that the necklace was safely stowed away inside Captain Saunders&rsquo;s
  breast pocket.</p>
  <p>All was indeed well that ended so well. But the history of the disappearance
  and re-appearance of the pearl necklace has remained a baffling mystery to
  this day. Neither the Saunders&rsquo;s nor Mr. Haasberg ever departed one
  iota from the circumstantial story which they had originally told and no
  one ever heard another word about the man with the walrus moustache and the
  gold-rimmed spectacles: the French police are still after him in connection
  with the assault on le Capitaine Saunders, but no trace of him was ever found.</p>
  <p>To some people this was a conclusive proof of guilt, but then, having stolen
  the necklace, why should he have restored it? Though the pearls were very
  beautiful and there were a great number of them beautifully matched, there
  was nothing abnormal about them either in size or colour; there never could
  be any difficulty for an expert thief to dispose of them to continental dealers.
  The same argument would of course apply to Mr. Haasberg whom some wiseacres
  still persisted in accusing. If he stole the necklace why should he have
  restored it? Nothing could be easier than for a business man who travelled
  a great deal on the continent to sell a parcel of pearls.</p>
  <p>And there always remained the unanswered question: Why did Saunders take
  the pearls out of the strong room, and where was he taking them to when he
  was assaulted and robbed? Did the man with the walrus moustache really call
  at the Majestic that night? And if he was innocent why did he disappear.
  Why? Why? Why?</p>
  <h3 align="center"><b>3</b></h3>
  <p>The case had very much interested me at the time, but the mystery was a
  nine days&rsquo; wonder as far as I was concerned, and soon far more important
  matters than the temporary disappearance of a few rows of pearls occupied
  public attention.</p>
  <p>It was really only last year when I had renewed my acquaintance with the
  Man in the Corner that I bethought myself once more of the mystery of the
  pearl necklace, and I felt the desire to hear what the spook-like creature&rsquo;s
  theory was upon the subject.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The pearl necklace?&rdquo; he said with a cackle. &ldquo;Ah, yes,
  it caused a good bit of stir in its day. But people talked such a lot of
  irresponsible nonsense that thinking minds had not a chance of arriving at
  a sensible conclusion.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; I rejoined amiably. &ldquo;But you did.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, you are right there,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;I knew well enough
  where the puzzle lay but it was not my business to put the police on the
  right track. And if I had I should have been the cause of making two innocent
  and clever people suffer more severely than the guilty party.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Will you condescend to explain?&rdquo; I asked, with an indulgent
  smile.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why should I not?&rdquo; he retorted, and once again his thin fingers
  started to work on the inevitable piece of string. &ldquo;It all lies in
  a nutshell, and is easily understandable if we realise that &lsquo;old Pasquier,&rsquo; the
  man with the walrus moustache, was not the friend of the Saunders&rsquo;s,
  but their enemy.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I frowned. &ldquo;Their enemy?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;An old pal shall we say?&rdquo; he retorted, &ldquo;who knew something
  in the past history of one or the other of them that they did not wish their
  newest friends to know: really a blackmailer who, under the guise of comradeship,
  sat not infrequently at their fireside, watching an opportunity for extorting
  a heavy price for his silence and his goodwill. Thus he could worm himself
  into their confidence; he knew their private life; he heard about the necklace,
  and decided that here was the long sought for opportunity at last. Think
  it all over and you will see how well the pieces of that jigsaw puzzle fit
  together and make a perfect picture. Pasquier calls on the Saunders&rsquo;s
  a day or two before their departure and springs his infamous proposal upon
  them then. For the time being Arthur succeeds in giving him the slip; his
  journey is not yet... the necklace is not yet in his possession... but he
  knows the true quality of the blackmailer now and he is on the alert. He
  begins by going to Sir Montague Bowden and begging him to entrust the mission
  to somebody else. Judging by the butler&rsquo;s evidence, he even makes a
  clean breast of his troubles to Sir Montague who, however, makes light of
  them and advises consultation with Mr. Haasberg, who perhaps would undertake
  the journey. In any case it is too late to make fresh arrangements at this
  hour. Very reluctantly now, and hoping for the best, the Saunders&rsquo;s
  make a start. But the blackmailer, too, is on the alert, he has succeeded
  in spying upon them and in tracing them to the Majestic in Paris., The situation
  now has become terribly serious, for the blackmailer has thrown off the mask
  and demands the necklace under threats which apparently the Saunders&rsquo;s
  did not dare defy.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But they are both clever and resourceful, and as soon as Haasberg&rsquo;s
  arrival rids them temporarily of their tormentor they put their heads together
  and invent a plot which was destined to free them for ever from the threats
  of Pasquier and at the same time would enable them to honour the trust which
  had been placed in them by the committee. In any case they had until the
  morrow to make up their minds. Remember the words which Mr. Haasberg overheard
  on the part of Pasquier: &ldquo;S&rsquo;long old man. I&rsquo;ll wait till
  tomorrow.&rdquo; Anyway, Pasquier must have gone off that evening confident
  that he had Captain Saunders entirely in his power and that the wretched
  man would on the morrow hand over the necklace without demur.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Whether Arthur Saunders confided in Haasberg or no is doubtful. Personally
  I think not. I believe that he and Mary did the whole thing between them.
  Arthur having parted from his brother-in-law went back to the hotel, took
  the necklace out of the strong room and then left it in Mary&rsquo;s charge.
  He threw the tin box away, there where it would surely be found again. Then
  he went as far as the Rue de Moncigny and crouched, seemingly unconscious,
  in the blind alley, having previously taken the precaution of saturating
  his handkerchief with chloroform.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Thus the two clever conspirators cut the ground from under the blackmailer&rsquo;s
  feet, for the latter now had the police after him for an assault, which he
  might find very difficult to disprove, even if he cleared himself of the
  charge of having stolen the necklace. Anyway he would remain a discredited
  man, and his threats would in the future be defied, because if he dared come
  out in the open after that, public feeling would be so bitter against him
  for a crime which he had not committed that he would never be listened to
  if he tried to do Captain Saunders an injury. And it was with a view to keeping
  public indignation at boiling pitch against the supposed thief that the Saunders&rsquo;s
  kept up the comedy for so long. To my mind that was a very clever move. Then
  they came out with the story of the restoration of the necklace and became
  the heroes of the hour.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Think it over,&rdquo; the funny creature went on as he finally stuffed
  his bit of string back into his pocket and rose from the table, &ldquo;think
  it over and you will realise at once that everything happened just as I have
  related and that it is the only theory that fits in with the facts that are
  known; you&rsquo;ll also agree with me, I think, that Captain and Mrs. Saunders
  chose the one way of ridding themselves effectually of a dangerous blackmailer.
  The police were after him for a long time, as they still believed that he
  had something to do with the theft of the necklace and with the assault on
  M le Capitaine Saunders. But presently 1914 came along and what became of
  the man with the walrus moustache no one ever knew. What his nationality
  was was never stated at the time, but whatever it was, it would, I imagine,
  be a bar against his obtaining a visa on his passport for the purpose of
  visiting England and blackmailing Arthur Saunders.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But it was a curious case.&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="TheMysteryOfTheRussianPrince"></a>The Mystery Of The Russian Prince</b> </h2>
  <h3 align="center"><b>1</b></h3>
  <p>There had been a great deal of talk about that time, in newspapers and amongst
  the public, of the difficulty an inexperienced criminal finds in disposing
  of the evidences of his crime&#8213; notably of course of the body of his
  victim. In no case perhaps was this difficulty so completely overcome&#8213; at
  any rate as far as was publicly known&#8213; as in that of the murder of
  the individual known as Prince Orsoff. I am thus qualifying his title because
  as a matter of fact the larger public never believed that he was a genuine
  Prince&#8213; Russian or otherwise&#8213; and that even if he had not come
  by such a violent and tragic death the Smithsons would never have seen either
  their &pound;10,000 again, or poor Louisa&rsquo;s aristocratic bridegroom.</p>
  <p>I had been thinking a great deal about this mysterious affair, indeed it
  had been discussed at most of the literary and journalistic clubs as a possible
  subject for a romance or drama, and it was with deliberate intent that I
  walked over to Fleet Street that afternoon in order to catch the Man in the
  Corner in his accustomed tea-shop and get him to give me his views on the
  subject of the mystery that to this very day surrounds the murder of the
  Russian Prince.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Let me just put the whole case before you,&rdquo; the funny creature
  began as soon as I had led him to talk upon the subject, &ldquo;as far as
  it was known to the general public. It all occurred in Folkestone, you remember,
  where the wedding of Louisa Smithson, the daughter of a late retired grocer,
  to a Russian Prince whom she had met abroad, was the talk of the town.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It was on a lovely day in May, and the wedding ceremony was to take
  place at Holy Trinity Church. The Smithsons&#8213; mother and daughter&#8213; especially
  since they had come into a fortune, were very well known in Folkestone, and
  there was a large crowd of relatives and friends inside the church and another
  out in the street to watch the arrival of guests and to see the bride. There
  were camera men and newspaper men, and hundreds of idlers and visitors, and
  the police had much ado to keep the crowd in order.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mrs. Smithson had already arrived looking gorgeous in what I understand
  is known as amethyst crepe-de-chine, and there was a marvellous array of
  Bond Street gowns and gorgeous headgears, all of which kept the lookers-on
  fully occupied during the traditional quarter of an hour&rsquo;s grace usually
  accorded to the bride. But presently those fifteen minutes became twenty,
  the clergy had long since arrived, the guests had all assembled, the bridesmaids
  were waiting in the porch: but there was no bridegroom. Neither he nor his
  best man had arrived; and now it was half an hour after the time appointed
  for the ceremony, and, oh, horror!&#8213; the bride&rsquo;s car was in sight.
  The bride in church waiting for the bridegroom!&#8213; such an outrage had
  not been witnessed in Folkestone within the memory of the oldest inhabitant.
  One of the guests went at once to break the news to the elderly relative
  who had arranged to give the bride away, and who was with her in the car,
  whilst another, a Mr. Sutherland Ford, jumped into the first available taxi,
  having volunteered to go to the station in order to ascertain whether there
  had been any breakdown on the line, as the bridegroom was coming down by
  train from London with his best man.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The bride, hastily apprised of the extraordinary contretemps, remained
  in the car, with the blinds pulled down, well concealed from the prying eyes
  of the crowd, whilst the fashionable guests, relatives, and friends had perforce
  to possess their souls in patience.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And presently the news fell like a bombshell in the midst of this
  lively throng. A taxi drove up and from it alighted first Mr. Sutherland
  Ford, who had volunteered to go to the station for information, and then
  John and Henry Carter, the two latter beautifully got up, in frock coats,
  striped trousers, top hats, and flowers in their buttonholes, looking obviously
  like belated wedding guests. But still no bridegroom, and no best man. The
  three gentlemen, paying no heed to the shower of questions that assailed
  them, as soon as they had jumped out of the taxi ran straight into the church,
  leaving everyone&rsquo;s curiosity unsatisfied and public excitement at fever
  pitch. &lsquo;It was John and Henry Carter&rsquo; the ladies whispered agitatedly; &lsquo;fancy
  their being asked to the wedding!&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And those who were in the know whispered to those who were less favoured
  that young Henry had at one time been engaged to Louisa Smithson, before
  she met her Russian Prince, and that when she threw him over he was in such
  dire despair that his friends thought he would commit suicide.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A moment or two later Mrs. Smithson was seen hurriedly coming out
  of church, her face pale and drawn, and her beautiful hat all awry. She made
  straight for the bride&rsquo;s car, stepped into it, and the car immediately
  drove off, whilst the wedding guests trooped out of the church and the terrible
  news spread like wildfire through the crowd and was presently all over the
  town. It seems that when the midday train, London to Folkestone, stopped
  at Swanley Junction, two passengers who were about to enter a first-class
  compartment in one of the corridor carriages were horrified to find it in
  a terrible state of disorder. They hastily called the guard, and on examination
  the carriage looked indeed as if it had been the scene of a violent struggle:
  the door on the off side was unlatched, two of the window straps were wrenched
  off, the antimacassars were torn off the cushions, one of the luggage racks
  was broken and the net hung down in strips, and over some of the cushions
  were marks unmistakably made by a bloodstained hand.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The guard immediately locked the compartment and sent for the local
  police. No one was allowed in or out of the station until every passenger
  on the train had satisfied the police as to his or her identity. Thus the
  train was held up for over two hours whilst preliminary investigations were
  going on. There appeared no doubt that a terrible murder had been committed,
  and telephonic communication all along the line presently established the
  fact that it must have been done somewhere in the neighbourhood of Sydenham
  Hill, because a group of men who were at work on the up side of the line
  at Penge when the down train came out of the tunnel noticed that the door
  of one of the first-class carriages was open. It swung to again just before
  the train steamed through the station. A preliminary search was at once made
  in and about the tunnel; it revealed on the platform of Sydenham Hill station
  a first-class single ticket of that day&rsquo;s issue, London to Folkestone,
  crushed and stained with blood, and on the permanent way, close to the entrance
  of the tunnel on the Penge side, a soft black hat, and a broken pair of pince-nez.
  But as to the identity of the victim there was for the moment no clue.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;After a couple of wearisome and anxious hours the passengers were
  allowed to proceed on their journey. Among these passengers, it appears,
  were John and Henry Carter, who were on their way to the Smithson wedding.
  Until they arrived in Folkestone they had no more idea than the police who
  the victim of the mysterious train murder was: but in the station they caught
  sight of Mr. Sutherland Ford, whom they knew slightly. Mr. Ford was making
  agitated enquiries as to any possible accident on the line. The Carters put
  him au fait of what had occurred, and as there was no sign of the Russian
  Prince amongst the passengers who had just arrived, all three men came to
  the horrifying conclusion that it was indeed the bridegroom elect who had
  been murdered. They communicated at once with the police, and there were
  more investigations and telephonic messages up and down the line before the
  Carters and Mr. Ford were at last allowed to proceed to the church and break
  the awful news to those most directly concerned.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And in this tragic fashion did Louisa Smithson&rsquo;s wedding day
  draw to its end; nor, as far as the public was concerned, was the mystery
  of that terrible murder ever satisfactorily cleared up. The local police
  worked very hard and very systematically, but, though presently they also
  had the help of one of the ablest detectives from Scotland Yard, nothing
  was seen or found that gave the slightest clue either as to the means which
  the murderer or murderers adopted for removing the body of their victim,
  or in what manner they made good their escape.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>The body of the Russian Prince was never found, and, as far as the public
  knows, the murderer is still at large; and although, as time went on, many
  strange facts came to light, they only helped to plunge that extraordinary
  crime into darker mystery.</p>
  <h3 align="center"><b>2</b></h3>
  <p>&ldquo;The facts in themselves were curious enough, you will admit,&rdquo; the
  Man in the Corner went on after awhile; &ldquo;many of these were never known
  to the public, whilst others found their way into the columns of the halfpenny
  Press, who battened on the &lsquo;Mystery of the Russian Prince&rsquo; for
  weeks on end, and, as far as the unfortunate Smithsons were concerned, there
  was not a reader of the Express Post and kindred newspapers who did not know
  the whole of their family history.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It seems that Louisa Smithson is the daughter of a grocer in Folkestone
  who had retired from business just before the War, and with his wife and
  his only child led a meagre and obscure existence in a tiny house in Warren
  Avenue somewhere near the tram road. They were always supposed to be very
  poor, but suddenly old Smithson died and it turned out that he had been a
  miser, for he left the handsome little fortune of &pound;15,000 to be equally
  divided between his daughter and his widow.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;At once Mrs. Smithson and Louisa found themselves the centre of an
  admiring throng of friends and relatives, all eager to help them spend their
  money for their especial benefit; but Mrs. Smithson was shrewd enough not
  to allow herself to be exploited by those who in the past had never condescended
  to more than a bowing acquaintance with her. She turned her back on most
  of those sycophants, but at the same time she was, determined to do the best
  for herself and Louisa, and to this end she admitted into her councils her
  sister, Margaret Penny, who was saleswoman at a fashionable shop in London,
  and who immediately advised a journey up to town so that the question of
  clothes might at once be satisfactorily settled.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In addition to valuable advice on that score, this Miss Penny seems
  to have succeeded in completely turning her sister&rsquo;s head. Certain
  it is that Mrs. Smithson left Folkestone a quiet, sensible, motherly woman,
  and that she returned, six weeks later, an arrogant, ill-mannered parvenue,
  who seemed to think that the possession of a few thousand pounds entitled
  her to ride roughshod over the feelings and sentiments of those who had less
  money than herself.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She began by taking a suite of rooms at the Splendid Hotel for herself,
  her daughter, and her maid, then she sold her house in Warren Avenue, bought
  a car, and, though she and Louisa were of course in deep mourning, they were
  to be seen everywhere in wonderful Bond Street dresses and marvellous feathered
  hats. Finally they announced their intention of spending the coming winter
  on the Riviera, probably Monte Carlo.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;All this extravagant behaviour made some people smile, others shrugged
  their shoulders and predicted disaster: but there was one who suffered acutely
  through this change in the fortune of the Smithsons. This was Henry Carter,
  a young clerk employed in an insurance office in London. He and his brother
  were Folkestone men, sons of a local tailor in a very small way of business,
  who had been one of old Smithson&rsquo;s rare friends. The elder Carter boy
  had long since cut his stick and was said to be earning a living in London
  by freelance journalism. The younger one, Henry, remained to help his father
  with the tailoring. He was a constant visitor in the little house in Warren
  Avenue, and presently became engaged to Louisa. There could be no question
  of an immediate marriage, of course, as Henry had neither money nor prospects;
  however, presently old Carter died, the tailoring business was sold for a
  couple of hundred pounds, and Henry went up to London to join his brother
  and to seek his fortune. Presently he obtained a post in an insurance office,
  but his engagement to Louisa subsisted: the young people were known to be
  deeply in love with one another and Henry spent most weekends and all his
  holidays in Folkestone in order to be near his girl.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then came the change in the fortune of the Smithsons and an immediate
  coolness in Louisa&rsquo;s manner toward young Henry. It was all very well
  in the past to be engaged to the son of a jobbing tailor, while one was poor
  oneself, and one had neither wit nor good looks, but now...!</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In fact already when they were in London Mrs. Smithson had intimated
  to Henry Carter that his visits were none too welcome, and when he appealed
  to Louisa she put him off with a few curt words. The young man was in despair,
  and, indeed, his brother actually feared at one time that he would commit
  suicide.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It was soon after Christmas of that same year that the curtain was
  rung up on the first act of the mysterious tragedy which was destined to
  throw a blight for ever after upon the life of Louisa Smithson. It began
  with the departure of herself and her mother for the Continent, where they
  intended to remain until the end of March. For the first few weeks their
  friends had no news of them, but presently Miss Margaret Penny, who had kept
  up a desultory correspondence with a pal of hers in Folkestone, started to
  give glowing accounts of the Smithsons&rsquo; doings in Monte Carlo. They
  were staying at the Hotel de Paris, paying two hundred francs a day for their
  rooms alone, they were lunching and dining out every day of the week they
  had been introduced to one or two of the august personages who usually graced
  the Riviera with their presence at this time of the year, and they had met
  a number of interesting people. According to Miss Penny&rsquo;s account,
  Louisa Smithson was being greatly admired, and in fact several titled gentlemen
  of various nationalities had professed themselves deeply enamoured of her.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;All this Miss Penny recounted in her letters to her friends, with
  a wealth of detail and a marvellous profusion of adjectives, and finally
  in one of her letters there was mention of a certain Russian grandee&#8213; Prince
  Orsoff by name&#8213; who was paying Louisa marked attention. He also was
  staying at the &lsquo;Paris,&rsquo; appeared very wealthy, and was obviously
  of very high rank for he never mixed with the crowd which was more than usually
  brilliant this year in Monte Carlo. This exclusiveness on his part was all
  the more flattering to the Smithsons, and, when he apprised them of his intention
  to spend the season in London, they had asked him to come and visit them
  in Folkestone, where Mrs. Smithson intended to take a house presently and
  there to entertain lavishly during the summer.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;After this preliminary announcement from Miss Penny, Louisa herself
  wrote a letter to Henry Carter. It was quite a pleasant chatty letter, telling
  him of their marvellous doings abroad, and of her own social successes. It
  did not do more, however, than vaguely hint at the Russian Prince, his distinguished
  appearance and obvious wealth. Nevertheless it plunged the unfortunate young
  man into the utmost depths of despair, and according to his brother John&rsquo;s
  subsequent account the latter had a terrible time with young Henry that winter.
  John himself was very busy with journalistic work which kept him away sometimes
  for days and weeks on end from the little home in London which the two brothers
  had set up for themselves with the money derived from the sale of the tailoring
  business. And Henry&rsquo;s state of mind did at times seriously alarm his
  brother, for he would either threaten to do away with himself, or vow that
  he would be even with that accursed foreigner.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;At the end of March, the Smithsons returned to England. During the
  interval Mrs. Smithson had made all arrangements for taking &lsquo;The Towers,&rsquo; a
  magnificently furnished house facing the Leas at Folkestone, and here she
  and Louisa installed themselves preparatory to launching their invitations
  for the various tea-and tennis-parties, dinners and dances which they proposed
  to give during the summer.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;One might really quite truthfully say that the eyes of all Folkestone
  were fixed upon the two ladies. Their Paris dresses, their hats, their jewellery
  was the chief subject of conversation at tea-tables, and of course everyone
  was talking about the Russlan Prince, who&#8213; Mrs. Smithson had confided
  this to a bosom friend&#8213; was coming over to England for the express
  purpose of proposing to Louisa.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There was quite a flutter of excitement on a memorable Friday afternoon
  when it was rumoured that Henry Carter had come down for a weekend, and had
  put up at a small hotel down by the harbour. Of course, he had come to see
  Louisa Smithson; everyone knew that, and no doubt he wished to make a final
  appeal to her love for him, which could not be entirely dead yet. Within
  twenty-four hours, however, it was common gossip that young Henry had presented
  himself at The Towers and been refused admittance. The ladies were out, the
  butler said, and he did not know when they would be home. This was on the
  Saturday. On the Sunday Henry walked about on the Leas all morning in the
  hope of seeing Louisa or her mother, and as he failed to do so he called
  again in the early part of the afternoon: he was told the ladies were resting.
  Later he came again and the ladies had gone out, and on the Monday, as presumably
  business called him back to town, he left by the early-morning train, without
  having seen his former fiancee. Indeed people from that moment took it for
  granted that young Henry had formally been given his conge.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Toward the middle of April Prince Orsoff arrived in London. Within
  two days he telephoned to Mrs. Smithson to ask her when he might come to
  pay his respects. A day was fixed and he came to &lsquo;The Towers&rsquo; to
  lunch. He came again, and at his third visit he formally proposed to Miss
  Louisa Smithson and was accepted. The wedding was to take place almost immediately,
  and the very next day the exciting announcement had gone the round of the
  Smithsons&rsquo; large circle of friends, not only in Folkestone but also
  in London.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The effect of the news appears to have been staggering as far as
  the unfortunate Henry Carter was concerned. In the picturesque language of
  Mrs. Hicks, the middle-aged charlady who &lsquo;did&rsquo; for the two brothers
  in their little home in Chelsea, &lsquo;&rsquo;e carried on something awful.&rsquo; She
  even went so far as to say that she feared he might put &rsquo;is &rsquo;ead
  in the gas oven,&rsquo; and that, as Mr. John was away at the time, she took
  the precaution every day when she left to turn the gas off at the meter.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The following weekend Henry came down to Folkestone and again took
  up his quarters in the small hotel by the harbour. On the Saturday afternoon
  he called at &lsquo;The Towers&rsquo; and refused to take &lsquo;No&rsquo; for
  an answer when he asked to see Miss Smithson. Indeed he seems literally to
  have pushed his way into the drawing-room where the ladies were having tea.
  According to statements made subsequently by the butler, there ensued a terrible
  scene between Henry and his former fiancee, at the very height of which,
  as luck would have it, who should walk in but Prince Orsoff.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That elegant gentleman, however, seems to have behaved on that trying
  occasion with perfect dignity and tact, making it his chief business to reassure
  the ladies and paying no heed to Henry&rsquo;s recriminations, which presently
  degenerated into vulgar abuse and ended in violent threats. At last, with
  the aid of the majestic butler, the young man was thrust out of the house,
  but even on the doorstep he turned and raised a menacing fist in the direction
  of Prince Orsoff and said loudly enough for more than one person to hear:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Wait! I&rsquo;ll be even with that &#8213;&#8213; foreigner
  yet.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It must indeed have been a terrifying scene for two sensitive and
  refined ladies like Mrs and Miss Smithson to witness. Later on, after the
  Prince himself had taken his leave, the butler was rung for by Mrs. Smithson
  who told him that under no circumstances was Mr. Henry Carter ever to be
  admitted inside &lsquo;The Towers.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;However, a Sunday or two afterwards, Mr. John Carter called and Mrs.
  Smithson saw him. He said that he had come down expressly from London in
  order to apologise for his brother&rsquo;s conduct. Harry, he said, was deeply
  contrite that he should thus have lost control over himself, his broken heart
  was his only excuse. After all, he had been and still was deeply in love
  with Louisa, and no man, worth his salt, could see the girl he loved turning
  her back on him without losing some of that equanimity which should of course
  be the characteristic of every gentleman.</p>
  <br clear="all">
 <p>&nbsp;&ldquo;In fact Mr. John Carter spoke so well and so persuasively that
  Mrs. Smithson and Louisa, who were at bottom a quite worthy pair of women,
  agreed to let bygones be bygones, and said that, if Henry would only behave
  himself in the future, there was no reason why he should not remain their
  friend.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;This appeared a quite satisfactory state of things, and over in me
  little house in Chelsea Mrs. Hicks gladly noted that &lsquo;Mr. &rsquo;Enry
  seemed more like &rsquo;isself afterwards.&rsquo; The very next weekend the
  two brothers went down to Folkestone together, and they called at &lsquo;The
  Towers&rsquo; so that Henry might offer his apologies in person. The two
  gentlemen on that occasion were actually asked to stay to tea.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Indeed it seems as if Henry had entirely turned over a new leaf,
  and when presently the gracious invitation came for both brothers to come
  to the wedding they equally graciously accepted.</p>
  <h3 align="center"><b>3</b></h3>
  <p>&ldquo;The day fixed for the happy event was now approaching. The large
  circle of acquaintances, friends, and hangers-on which the Smithsons had
  gathered around them were all agog with excitement, wedding-presents were
  pouring in by every post. A kind of network of romance had been woven around
  the personalities of the future bride, her mother, and the Russian Prince.
  The wealth of the Smithsons had been magnified an hundredfold, and Prince
  Orsoff was reputed to be a brother of the late Czar, who had made good his
  escape out of Russia bringing away with him most of the Crown jewels, which
  he would presently bestow upon his wife.</p>
  <p>And so on, ad infinitum.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And upon the top of all that excitement and that gossip, and marvellous
  tales akin to the Arabian Nights, came the wedding day with its awful culminating
  tragedy.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The Russian Prince had been murdered and his body so cleverly disposed
  of that in spite of the most strenuous efforts on the part of the police
  not a trace of it could be found.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That robbery had been the main motive of the crime was quickly enough
  established. The Smithsons&#8213; mother and daughter&#8213; had at once
  supplied the detective in charge of the case with proofs as to that. It seems
  that as soon as the unfortunate Prince had become engaged to Louisa he asked
  that the marriage should take place without delay. He explained that his
  dearest friend, Mr. Schumann, the great international financier, had offered
  him shares in one of the greatest post-war undertakings which had ever been
  floated in Europe, and which would bring in to the fortunate shareholders
  a net income of not less than &pound;10,000 yearly for every &pound;10,000
  invested; Mr. Schumann himself owned one half of all the shares and had,
  by a most wonderful act of disinterested generosity, allowed his bosom friend,
  Prince Orsoff, to have a few&#8213; a concession, by the way, which he had
  only granted to two other favoured personages, one being the Prince of Wales
  and the other the President of the French Republic. Of course to receive &pound;10,000
  yearly for every &pound;10,000 invested was too wonderful for words; the
  President of the French Republic had been so delighted with this chance of
  securing a fortune that he had put two million francs into the concern, and
  the Prince of Wales had put in &pound;500,000.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And it was so wonderfully secure, as otherwise the British Government
  would not have allowed the Prince of Wales to invest such a vast sum of money
  if the business was only speculative. Security and fortune beyond the dreams
  of thrift! It was positively dazzling. No wonder that this vision of untold
  riches made poor Mrs. Smithson&rsquo;s mouth water, the more so as she was
  quite shrewd enough to realise that at the rate she was going her share in
  the &pound;15,000 left by the late worthy grocer would soon fade into nothingness.
  In the past few months she and Louisa had spent considerably over &pound;4,000
  between them, and once her daughter was married to a quasi-royal personage,
  good old Mrs. Smithson did not see herself retiring into comparative obscurity
  on a few hundreds a year to be jeered at by all her friends.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So she and Louisa talked the matter over together, and then they
  talked it over with Prince Orsoff on the occasion of his visit about ten
  days before the wedding. The Prince at first was very doubtful if the great
  Mr. Schumann would be willing to make a further sacrifice in the cause of
  friendship. He was an international financier, accustomed to deal in millions;
  he would not look favourably&#8213; the Prince feared&#8213; at a few thousands.
  Mrs. Smithson&rsquo;s entire fortune now only consisted of about &pound;5,000;
  this she was unwilling to admit to the wealthy and aristocratic future son-in-law.
  So the two ladies decided to pool their capital and then they begged that
  Prince Orsoff should ask the great Mr. Schumann whether he would condescend
  to receive &pound;10,000 for investment in Mrs. Smithson&rsquo;s name in
  his great undertaking.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Fortunately the great financier did condescend to do this&#8213; he
  really was more of a philanthropist than a business man&#8213; but, of course,
  he could not be kept waiting, the money must reach him in Paris not later
  than May the 20th, which was the very day fixed for the wedding. It was ail
  terribly difficult, and Mrs. Smithson was at first in despair as she feared
  she could not arrange to sell out her securities in time, and the difficulties
  were increased an hundredfold because, as Prince Orsoff explained to her,
  Mr. Schumann would even at the eleventh hour refuse to allow her to participate
  in the huge fortune if he found that she had talked about the affair over
  in England. The business had to be kept a profound secret for international
  reasons, in fact, if any detail relating to the business and to Mr. Schumann&rsquo;s
  participation in it were to become known, the whole of Europe would once
  more be plunged into war.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;To make a long story short, Mrs. Smithson and Louisa sold out all
  their securities, amounting between them to &pound;10,000, Then they went
  up to London, drew the money out of their bank, changed it themselves into
  French money&#8213; so as to make it more convenient for Mr. Schumann&#8213; and
  handed the entire sum over to Prince Orsoff on the eve of the wedding. Of
  course such fatuous imbecility would be unbelievable if it did not occur
  so frequently: vain, silly women, who have never moved outside their own
  restricted circle are always the ready prey of plausible rascals.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Anyway, in this case the Smithsons returned to Folkestone that day,
  perfectly happy and with never a thought of anything but contentment for
  the present and prosperity in the future. The wedding was to be the next
  day; the bridegroom-elect was coming down by the midday train with his best
  man, whom he vaguely described as secretary to the Russian Embassy, and the
  bridal pair would start for Paris by the afternoon boat.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;All this the Smithsons related to the police inspector in charge
  of the case and subsequently to the Scotland Yard detective, with a wealth
  of details and a profusion of lamentations not unmixed with expletives directed
  against the unknown assassin, and thief. For indeed there was no doubt in
  the minds of Louise and her mother that the unfortunate Prince, on whom the
  girl still lavished the wealth of her trustful love, had been murdered for
  the sake of the vast wealth which he had upon his person. It must have amounted
  to millions of francs, Mrs. Smithson declared, for he had the Prince of Wales&rsquo; money
  upon him also, and probably that of the President of the French Republic,
  and at first she and Louisa fastened their suspicions upon the anonymous
  best man, the so-called secretary of the Russian Embassy. Even when they
  were presently made to realise that there was no such thing as a Russian
  Embassy in London these days, and that minute inquiries both at home and
  abroad regarding the identity of a Prince Orsoff led to no result whatever,
  they repudiated with scorn the suggestion put forth by the police that their
  beloved Russian Prince was nothing more or less than a clever crook who had
  led them by the nose, and that in all probability he had not been murdered
  in the train but had succeeded in jumping out of it and making good his escape
  across country.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;This the Smithson ladies would not admit for a moment, and with commendable
  logic they argued that if Prince Orsoff had been a crook and had intended
  to make away with their money he could have done that easily enough without
  getting into a train at Victoria and jumping out of it at Sydenham Hill.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Pressed with questions, however, the ladies were forced to admit
  that they knew absolutely nothing about Prince Orsoff, they had never been
  introduced to any of his relations, nor had they met any of his friends.
  They did not even know where he had been staying in London. He was in the
  habit of telephoning to Louisa every morning, and any arrangements for his
  visits down to &lsquo;The Towers&rsquo; or the ladies&rsquo; trips up to
  town were made in that manner. As a matter of fact Louisa and her future
  husband had not met more than a dozen times altogether, on some five or six
  occasions in Monte Carlo, and not more than six in England. It had been a
  case of love at first sight.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The question of Mr. Schumann&rsquo;s vast undertaking was first discussed
  at &lsquo;The Towers.&rsquo; After that the ladies wrote to their bank to
  sell out their securities, and subsequently went up to town for a couple
  of days to draw out their money, change it into French currency, and finally
  hand it over to Prince Orsoff. On that occasion he had met them at Victoria
  Station and taken them to a quiet hotel in Kensington, where he had engaged
  a suite of rooms for them. All financial matters were then settled in their
  private sitting-room. In answer to enquiries at that hotel, one or two of
  the employees distinctly remembered the foreign-looking gentleman who had
  called on Mrs and Miss Smithson, lunched with them in their sitting-room
  that day, and saw them into their cab when they went away the following afternoon.
  One or two of the station porters at Victoria also vaguely remembered a man
  who answered to the description given of Prince Orsoff by the Smithson ladies:
  tall, with a slight stoop, wearing pince-nez, and with a profusion of dark,
  curly hair, bushy eyebrows, long dark moustache, and old-fashioned imperial,
  which made him distinctly noticeable, he could not very well have passed
  unperceived.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Unfortunately, on the actual day of the murder, not one man employed
  at Victoria Station could swear positively to having seen him, either alone
  or in the company of another foreigner; and the latter has remained a problematic
  personage to this day.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But the Smithson ladies remained firm in their loyalty to their Russian
  Prince. Had they dared they would openly have accused Henry Carter of the
  murder; as it was they threw out weird hints and insinuations about Henry,
  who had more than once sworn that he would be even with his hated rival,
  and who had actually travelled down in the same train as the Prince on that
  fateful wedding morning, together with his brother John, who no doubt helped
  him in his nefarious deed. I believe that the unfortunate ladies actually
  spent some of the money which now they could ill spare in employing a private
  detective to collect proofs of Henry Carter&rsquo;s guilt.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But not a tittle of evidence could be brought against him. To begin
  with, the train in which the murder was supposed to have been committed was
  a nonstop to Swanley. Then how could the Carters have disposed of the body?
  The Smithsons suggested a third miscreant as a possible confederate; but
  the same objection against that theory subsisted in the shape of the disposal
  of the body. The murder&#8213; if murder there was&#8213; occurred in broad
  daylight in a part of the country that certainly was not lonely. It was not
  possible to suppose that a man would stand waiting on the line close to Sydenham
  Hill station until a body was flung out to him from the passing train, and
  then drag that body about until he found a suitable place in which to bury
  it: and all that without being seen by the workmen on the line or employees
  on the railway, or in fact any passer-by. Therefore the hypothesis that Henry
  Carter or his brother murdered the Russian Prince with or without the help
  of a confederate was as untenable as that the Prince had travelled from Victoria
  to Sydenham Hill and there jumped out of the train, at risk of being discovered
  in the act, rather than disappear quietly in London, shave off his luxuriant
  hair, or assume any other convenient disguise, until he found an opportunity
  for slipping back to the Continent.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But the Smithsons remained firm in their belief in the genuineness
  of their Prince and in their conviction that he had been murdered&#8213; if
  not by the Carters, then by the mysterious secretary to the Russian Embassy
  or any other Russian or German emissary, for political reasons.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And thus the public was confronted with the two hypotheses, both
  of which led to a deadlock. No sensible person doubted that the so-called
  Russian Prince was a crook and that he had a confederate to help him in his
  clever plot, but the mystery remained as to how the rascal or rascals disappeared
  so completely as to checkmate every investigation. The travelling by train
  that morning and setting the scene for a supposed murder was, of course,
  part of the plan, but it was the plan that was so baffling, because to an
  ordinary mind that disappearance could have been effected so much more easily
  and with far less risk without the train journey.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of course there was not a single passenger on that train who was
  not the subject of the closest watchfulness on the part of the police, but
  there was not one&#8213; not excluding the Carters&#8213; who could by any
  possible chance have known that the Prince carried a large sum of money upon
  his person. He was not likely to have confided the fact to a stranger, and
  the mystery of the vanished body was always there to refute the theory of
  an ordinary murderous attack for motives of robbery.&rdquo;</p>
  <h3 align="center"><b>4</b></h3>
  <p>The Man in the Corner ceased talking and became once more absorbed in his
  favourite task of making knots in a bit of string.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I see in the papers,&rdquo; I now put in thoughtfully, &ldquo;that
  Miss Louisa Smithson has overcome her grief for the loss of her aristocratic
  lover by returning to the plebeian one.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; the funny creature replied drily, &ldquo;she is marrying
  Henry Carter. Funny, isn&rsquo;t it? But women are queer fish! One moment
  she looked on the man as a murderer, now, by marrying him, she actually proclaims
  her belief in his innocence.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It certainly was abundantly proved,&rdquo; I rejoined, &ldquo;that
  Henry Carter could not possibly have murdered Prince Orsoff.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It was also abundantly proved,&rdquo; he retorted, &ldquo;that no
  one murdered the so-called Prince.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You think, of course, that he was an ordinary impostor?&rdquo; I
  asked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;An impostor, yes,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;but not an ordinary one.
  In fact I take off my hat to as clever a pair of scamps as I have ever come
  across.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A pair?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why, yes! It could not have been done alone.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But the police ...&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The police,&rdquo; the spook-like creature broke in with a sharp
  cackle, &ldquo;know more, in this case, than you give them credit for. They
  know well enough the solution of the puzzle which appears so baffling to
  the public, but they have not sufficient proof to effect an arrest. At one
  time they hoped that the scoundrels would presently make a false move and
  give themselves away, in which case they could be prosecuted for defrauding
  the Smithsons of &pound;10,000, but this eventuality has become complicated
  through the masterstroke of genius which made Henry Carter marry Louisa Smithson.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Henry Carter?&rdquo; I exclaimed. &ldquo;Then you do think the Carters
  had something to do with the case?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;They had everything to do with the case. In fact, they planned the
  whole thing in a masterly manner.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But the Russian Prince at Monte Carlo?&rdquo; I argued. &ldquo;Who
  was he? If he was a confederate where has he disappeared to?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He is still engaged in the free-lance journalism,&rdquo; the Man
  in the Corner replied drily, &ldquo;and in his spare moments changes parcels
  of French currency back into English notes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You mean the brother!&rdquo; I ejaculated with a gasp.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of course I mean the brother,&rdquo; he retorted drily, &ldquo;who
  else could have been so efficient a collaborator in the plot? John Carter
  was comparatively his own master. He lived with Henry in the small house
  in Chelsea, waited on by a charwoman who came by the day. It was generally
  given out that his reporting work took him frequently and for lengthened
  stays out of London. The brothers, remember, had inherited a few hundreds
  from their father, while the Smithsons had inherited a few thousands. We
  must suppose that the idea of relieving those ladies of those thousands occurred
  to them as soon as they realised that Louisa, egged on by her mother,
  would cold-shoulder her fiance.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;John Carter, mind you, must be a very clever man, else he could not
  have carried out all the details of the plot with so much sang-froid. We
  have been told, if you remember, that he had, early in life, cut his stick
  and gone to seek fortune in London, therefore the Smithsons, who had never
  been out of Folkestone, did not know him intimately. His make-up as the Prince
  must have been very good, and his histrionic powers not to be despised: his
  profession and life in London no doubt helped him in these matters. Then,
  remember also that he took very good care not to be a great deal in the Smithsons&rsquo; company&#8213; even
  in Monte Carlo he only let them see him less than half a dozen times, and
  as soon as he came to England he hurried on the wedding as much as he could.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Another fine stroke was Henry&rsquo;s apparent despair at being cut
  out of Louisa&rsquo;s affections and his threats against his successful rival:
  it helped to draw suspicion on himself&#8213; suspicion which the scoundrels
  took good care could easily be disproved. Then take a pair of vain, credulous,
  unintelligent women, and a smart rascal who knows how to flatter them, and
  you will see how easily the whole plot could be worked. Finally, when John
  Carter had obtained possession of the money, he and Henry arranged the supposed
  tragedy in the train and the Russian Prince&rsquo;s disappearance from the
  world as suddenly as he had entered it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I thought the matter over for a moment or two. The solution of the mystery
  certainly appealed to my dramatic sense.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; I said at last, &ldquo;one wonders why the Carters took
  the trouble to arrange a scene of a supposed murder in the train: they might
  quite well have been caught in the act, and in any case it was an additional
  unnecessary risk. John Carter might quite well have been content to shed
  his role of Russian Prince, without such an elaborate setting.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he admitted,&rdquo; in some ways you are right there,
  but it is always difficult to gauge accurately the mentality of a clever
  scoundrel. In this case I don&rsquo;t suppose that the Carters had quite
  made up their minds about what they would do when they left London, but that
  the plan was in their heads is proved by the hat, pince-nez, and railway
  ticket which they took with them when they started, and which, if you remember,
  were found on the line: but it was probably only because the train was comparatively
  empty, and they had both time and opportunity in the nonstop train, that
  they decided to carry their clever comedy through.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then think what an immense advantage in their future plans would
  be the Smithsons&rsquo; belief in the death of their Prince. Probably Louisa
  would never have dreamed of marrying if she thought her aristocratic lover
  was an impostor and still alive; she would never have let the matter rest;
  her mind would for ever have been busy with trying to trace him, and bring
  him back, repentant, to her feet. You know what women are when they are in
  love with that type of scoundrel, they cling to them with the tenacity of
  a leech. But once she believed the man to be dead, Louisa Smithson gradually
  got over her grief and Henry Carter wooed and won her on the rebound. She
  was poor now, and her friends had quickly enough deserted her; she was touched
  by the fidelity of her simple lover, and he thus consolidated his position
  and made the future secure.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Anyway,&rdquo; the Man in the Corner concluded, &ldquo;I believe
  that it was with a view to making a future marriage possible between Louisa
  and Henry that the two brothers organised the supposed murder. Probably if
  the train had been full and they had seen danger in the undertaking they
  would not have done it. But the <i>mise en scene</i> was easily enough set
  and it certainly was an additional safeguard. Now in another week or so Louisa
  Smithson will be Henry Carter&rsquo;s wife, and presently you will find that,
  John in London, and Henry and his wife, will be quite comfortably off. And
  after that, whatever suspicions Mrs. Smithson might have of the truth, her
  lips would have to remain sealed. She could not very well prosecute her only
  child&rsquo;s husband.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And so the matter will always remain a mystery to the public: but
  the police know more than they are able to admit because they have no proof.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And now they never will have. But as to the murder in the train,
  well!&#8213; the murdered man never existed.&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="TheMysteriousTragedyInBishopsRoad"></a>The Mysterious Tragedy In Bishop&rsquo;s Road</b> </h2>
  <h3 align="center"><b>1</b></h3>
  <p>The Man in the Corner was in a philosophising mood that afternoon, and all
  the while that his thin claw-like fingers fidgeted with the inevitable piece
  of string he gave vent to various, disjointed, always sententious remarks.</p>
  <p>Suddenly he said:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We know, of course, that the world has gone dancing mad! But I doubt
  if the fashionable craze has ever been responsible before for so dark a tragedy
  as the death of old Sarah Levison. What do you think?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; I replied guardedly, for I knew that, whatever I might
  say, I should draw an avalanche of ironical remarks upon my innocent head, &ldquo;I
  never have known what to think, and all the accounts of that brutal murder
  as they appeared in the cheaper Press only made obscurity all the more obscure.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That was a wise and well-thought-out reply,&rdquo; the aggravating
  creature retorted with a dry chuckle, &ldquo;and a non-committal one at that.
  Obscurity is indeed obscure for those who won&rsquo;t take the trouble to
  think.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I suppose it is all quite clear to you?&rdquo; I said, with what
  I meant to be withering sarcasm.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;As clear as the proverbial daylight,&rdquo; he replied undaunted.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You know how old Mrs. Levison came by her death?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of course I do. I will tell you if you like.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;By all means. But I am not prepared to be convinced,&rdquo; I added
  cautiously.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; he admitted, &ldquo;but you soon will be. However, before
  we reach that happy conclusion, I shall have to marshal the facts before
  you, because a good many of these must have escaped your attention. Shall
  I proceed?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If you please.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, then, do you remember all the personages in the drama?&rdquo; he
  began.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I think so.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There were, of course, young Aaron Levison and his wife, Rebecca&#8213; the
  latter young, pretty, fond of pleasure, and above all of dancing, and he,
  a few years older, but still in the prime of life, more of an athlete than
  a business man, and yet tied to the shop in which he carried on the trade
  of pawnbroking for his mother. The latter, an old Jewess, shrewd and dictatorial,
  was the owner of the business: her son was not even her partner, only a well-paid
  clerk in her employ, and this fact we must suppose rankled in the mind of
  her smart daughter-in-law. At any rate, we know that there was no love lost
  between the two ladies; but the young couple and old Mrs. Levison and another
  unmarried son lived together in the substantial house over the shop in Bishop&rsquo;s
  Road.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;They had three servants and we are told that they lived well, old
  Mrs. Levison bearing the bulk of the cost of housekeeping. The younger son,
  Reuben, seems to have been something of a bad egg. He held at one time a
  clerkship in a bank, but was dismissed for insobriety and laziness; then
  after the War he was supposed to have bad health consequent on exposure in
  the trenches, and had not done a day&rsquo;s work since he was demobilised.
  But in spite, or perhaps because, of this, he was very markedly his mother&rsquo;s
  favourite; where the old woman would stint her hard-working, steady elder
  son, she would prove generous, even lavish, toward the loafer, Reuben; and
  young Mrs. Levison and he were as thick as thieves.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What money Reuben extracted out of his mother he would spend on amusements,
  and his sister-in-law was always ready to accompany him. It was either the
  cinema or dancing&#8213; oh, dancing above all! Rebecca Levison was, it seems,
  a beautiful dancer, and night after night she and Reuben would go to one
  or other of the halls or hotels where dancing was going on, and often they
  would not return until the small hours of the morning.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Aaron Levison was indulgent and easy-going enough where his young
  wife was concerned: he thought that she could come to no harm while Reuben
  was there to look after her. But old Mrs. Levison, with the mistrust of her
  race for everything that is frivolous and thriftless, thought otherwise.
  She was convinced in her own mind that her beloved Reuben was being led astray
  from the path of virtue by his brother&rsquo;s wife, and she appears to have
  taken every opportunity to impress her thoughts and her fears upon the indulgent
  husband.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It seems that one of the chief bones of contention between the old
  and the young Mrs. Levison was the question of jewellery. Old Mrs. Levison
  kept charge herself of all the articles of value that were pawned in the
  shop, and every evening after business hours Aaron would bring up all bits
  of jewellery that had been brought in during the day, and his mother would
  lock them up in a safe that stood in her room close by her bedside. The key
  of the safe she always carried about with her. For the most part these bits
  of jewellery consisted of cheap rings and brooches, but now and again some
  impoverished lady or gentleman would bring more valuable articles along for
  the purpose of raising a temporary loan upon them, and at the time of the
  tragedy there were some fine diamond ornaments reposing in the safe in old
  Mrs. Levison&rsquo;s room.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now young Mrs. Levison had more than once suggested that she might
  wear some of this fine jewellery when she went out to balls and parties.
  She saw no harm in it, and neither, for a matter of that, did Reuben. Why
  shouldn&rsquo;t Rebecca wear a few ornaments now and again if she wanted
  to?&#8213; they would always be punctually returned, of course, and they
  could not possibly come to any harm. But the very suggestion of such a thing
  was anathema to the old lady, and in her flat refusal ever to gratify such
  a senseless whim she had the whole-hearted support of her eldest son: such
  a swerving from traditional business integrity was not to be thought of in
  the Levison household.</p>
  <p>On that memorable Saturday evening young Mrs. Levison was going with her
  brother-in-law to one of the big charity balls at the Kensington Town Hall,
  and her great desire was to wear for the occasion a set of diamond stars
  which had lately been pledged in the shop, and which were locked up in the
  old lady&rsquo;s safe. Of course, Mrs. Levison refused, and it seems that
  the two ladies very nearly came to blows about this, the quarrel being all
  the more violent as Reuben hotly sided with his sister-in-law against his
  mother.</p>
  <h3 align="center"><b>2</b></h3>
  <p>&ldquo;That then was the position in the Levison household on the day of
  the mysterious tragedy,&rdquo; the Man in the Corner went on presently: &ldquo;an
  armed truce between the two ladies&#8213; the lovely Rebecca sore and defiant,
  pining to gratify a whim which was being denied her, and old Mrs. Levison
  more bitter than usual against her, owing to Reuben&rsquo;s partisanship.
  Egged on by Rebecca, he was furious with his mother and vowed that he was
  sick of the family and meant to cut his stick in order to be free to lead
  his own life, and so on. It was all tall-talk, of course, as he was entirely
  dependent on his mother, but it went to show the ugliness of his temper and
  the domination which his brother&rsquo;s wife exercised over him. Aaron,
  on the other hand, took no part in the quarrel, but the servants remarked
  that he was unwontedly morose all day, and that his wife was very curt and
  disagreeable with him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nothing, however, of any importance occurred during the day until
  dinner-time, which as usual was served in the parlour at the back of the
  shop at seven o&rsquo;clock. It seems that as soon as the family sat down
  to their meal, there was another violent quarrel on some subject or other
  between the two ladies, Rebecca being hotly backed up by Reuben, and Aaron
  taking no part in the discussion; in the midst of the quarrel, and following
  certain highly offensive words spoken by Reuben, old Mrs. Levison got up
  abruptly from the table and went upstairs to her own room which was immediately
  overhead at the back of the house, next to the drawing-room, nor did she
  come downstairs again that evening.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;At half-past nine the three servants went up to bed according to
  the rule of the house. Old Mrs. Levison, who was a real autocrat in the management
  of the household, expected the girls, to be down at six every morning, but
  they were free to go to bed as soon as their work was done, and half-past
  nine was their usual time.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Two of the girls slept at the top of the house, and the housemaid,
  Ida Griggs by name, who also acted as a sort of maid to old Mrs. Levison,
  occupied a small slip room on the half landing immediately above the old
  lady&rsquo;s bedroom. On the floor above this there was a large bedroom at
  the back and a bathroom and dressing-room in front, all occupied by Mr and
  Mrs. Aaron, and over that, the two maids&rsquo; room, and one for Mr. Reuben,
  and a small spare room in which Mr. Aaron would sleep now and again when
  his wife was likely to be out late and he did not want to get his night&rsquo;s
  rest broken by her home-coming, or if he himself was going to be late home
  on a holiday night after one of those country excursions on his bicycle of
  which he was immensely fond and in which he indulged himself from time to
  time.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;On this fateful Saturday evening Aaron was kept late in the shop,
  but he finally went up to bed soon after ten, after he had seen to all the
  doors below being bolted and barred, with the exception of the front door
  which had to be left on the latch, Mrs. Aaron having the latch-key. Thus
  the house was shut up and everyone in bed by half-past ten.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In the meanwhile the lovely Mrs. Rebecca and Reuben had dressed and
  gone to the ball.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The next morning at a little before six, Ida Griggs, the housemaid,
  having got up and dressed, prepared to go downstairs: but when she went to
  open her bedroom door she found it locked&#8213; locked on the outside. At
  first she thought that the other girls were playing her a silly trick, and,
  presently hearing the patter of their feet on the stairs, she pounded against
  the door with her fists. It took the others some time to understand what
  was amiss, but at last they did try the lock on the outside, and found that
  the key had been turned and that Ida was indeed locked in.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;They let her out, and then consulted what had best be done, but for
  the moment it did not seem to strike any of the girls that this locking of
  a door from the outside had a sinister significance. Anyway, they all went
  down into the kitchen and Ida prepared old Mrs. Levison&rsquo;s early cup
  of tea. This she had to take up every morning at half-past six; on this occasion
  she went up as usual, knocked at her mistress&rsquo; door, and waited to
  be let in, as the old lady always slept behind locked doors. But no sound
  came from within, though Ida knocked repeatedly and loudly called her mistress
  by name. Soon she started screaming and her screams brought the household
  together: the two girls came up from the kitchen, Mr. Aaron came down from
  the top floor brandishing a poker, and presently Mrs. Aaron opened her door
  and peeped out clad in a filmy and exquisite nightgown, her eyes still heavy
  with sleep and her beautiful hair streaming down her back. But of old Mrs.
  Levison there was no sign. Mr. Aaron, genuinely alarmed, glued his ear to
  the keyhole, but not a sound could he hear. Behind that locked door absolute
  silence reigned.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Fearing the worst, he set himself the task of breaking open the door,
  which after some effort, and the use of a jemmy, he succeeded in doing: and
  here the sight that met his eyes filled his soul with horror, for he saw
  his mother lying on the floor of her bedroom in a pool of blood. Evidently
  an awful crime had been committed. The unfortunate woman was fully dressed,
  as she had been on the evening before; the door of the safe was open with
  the key still in the lock, but no other piece of furniture appeared to be
  disturbed; the one window of the room was wide open and the one door had
  been locked on the inside; the other door, the one which gave on the front
  drawing-room, being permanently blocked by a heavy wardrobe; and below the
  open window the bunch of creepers against the wall was all broken and torn,
  showing plainly the way that the miscreant had escaped.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;After a few moments of awe-stricken silence Aaron Levison regained
  control of himself and at once telephoned&#8213; first for the police and
  then for the doctor, but he would not allow anything in the room to be touched,
  not even his mother&rsquo;s dead body.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;For this precaution he was highly commended by the police inspector
  who presently appeared upon the scene, accompanied by a constable and the
  divisional surgeon; the latter proceeded to examine the body. He stated that
  the unfortunate woman had been attacked from behind, the marks of fingers
  being clearly visible round her throat: in her struggle for freedom she must
  have fallen backwards and in so doing struck her head against the corner
  of the marble washstand, which caused her death.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In the meanwhile the inspector had been examining the premises: he
  found that the back door which gave on the yard and the one that gave on
  the front area were barred and locked just as Mr. Aaron had left them before
  he went up to bed the previous night; on the other hand the front door was
  still on me latch, young Mrs. Levison having apparently failed to bolt it
  when she came home from the ball. In the backyard the creeper against the
  wall below the window of Mrs. Levison&rsquo;s room was certainly torn, and
  the miscreant undoubtedly made his escape that way, but he could not have
  got up to the window save with the aid of a ladder, the creeper was too slender
  to have supported any man&rsquo;s weight, and the brick wall of the house
  offered no kind of foothold even to a cat. The yard itself was surrounded
  on every side by the backyards of contiguous houses, and against the dividing
  walls there were clumps of Virginia creeper and anaemic shrubs such as are
  usually found in London backyards. Now neither on those walls nor on the
  creepers and shrubs was there the slightest trace of a ladder being dragged
  across, or even of a man having climbed the walls or slung a rope over: there
  was not a twig of shrub broken or a leaf of creeper disturbed.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;With regard to the safe, it must either have been open at the time
  that the murderer attacked Mrs. Levison, or he had found the key and opened
  the safe after he had committed that awful crime. Certainly the contents
  did not appear to have been greatly disturbed, no jewellery or other pledged
  goods of value were missing: Mr. Aaron could verify this by his books, but
  whether his mother had any money in the safe he was not in a position to
  say.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There was no doubt that at first glance the crime did not seem to
  have been an ordinary one; whether robbery had been its motive, or its corollary,
  only subsequent investigation would reveal: for the moment the inspector
  contented himself with putting a few leading questions to the various members
  of the household, and subsequently questioning the neighbours. The public,
  of course, was not to know what the result of these preliminary investigations
  was, but the midday papers were in a position to assert that no one, with
  perhaps the exception of Ida Griggs, had seen or heard anything alarming
  during the night, and that the most minute inquiries in the neighbourhood
  failed to bring forth the slightest indication of how the miscreants effected
  an entrance into the house.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The papers were also able to state that young Mrs. Levison returned
  from the ball in the small hours of the morning, but that Mr. Reuben Levison
  did not sleep in the house at all that night.</p>
  <h3 align="center"><b>3</b></h3>
  <p>&ldquo;Fortunately for me,&rdquo; my eccentric friend went on glibly, &ldquo;I
  was up betimes that morning when the papers came out with an early account
  of the mysterious crime in Bishop&rsquo;s Road, I say fortunately, because,
  as you know, mysteries of that sort interest me beyond everything, and for
  me there is no theatre in the world to equal in excitement the preliminary
  investigations of a well-conceived and cleverly executed crime. I should
  indeed have been bitterly disappointed had circumstances prevented me from
  attending that particular inquest. From the first, one was conscious of an
  atmosphere of mystery that hung over the events of that night in the Bishop&rsquo;s
  Road household: here indeed was no ordinary crime; the motive for it was
  still obscure, and one instinctively felt that somewhere, in this vast city
  of London, there lurked a criminal of no mean intelligence who would probably
  remain unpunished.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Even the evidence of the police was not as uninteresting as it usually
  is, because it established beyond a doubt that this was not a case of common
  burglary and housebreaking. Certainly the open window and the torn creeper
  suggested that the miscreant had made his escape that way, but how he effected
  an entrance into Mrs. Levison&rsquo;s room remained an unsolved riddle. The
  absence of any trace of a man&rsquo;s passage on the surrounding walls of
  the backyard was very mysterious, and it was firmly established that the
  back door and the area door were secured, barred and bolted from the inside.
  A burglar might, of course, have entered the house by the front door, which
  was on the latch, using a skeleton key, but it still remained inconceivable
  how he gained access into Mrs. Levison&rsquo;s room.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;From the first the public had felt that there was a background of
  domestic drama behind the seemingly purposeless crime, for it did appear
  purposeless, seeing that so much portable jewellery had been left untouched
  in the safe. But it was when Ida Griggs, the housemaid, stood up in response
  to her name being called that one seemed to see the curtain going up on the
  first act of a terrible tragedy.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Griggs was a colourless, youngish woman, with thin, sallow face,
  round blue eyes, and thin lips, and directly she began to speak one felt
  that underneath her placid, old-maidish manner there was an undercurrent
  of bitter spite, and even of passion.</p>
  <p>For some reason which probably would come to light later on, she appeared
  to have conceived a hatred for Mrs. Aaron; on the other hand she had obviously
  been doggedly attached to her late mistress, and in the evidence she dwelt
  at length on the quarrels between the two ladies, especially on the scene
  of violence that occurred at the dinner-table on Saturday and which culminated
  in old Mrs. Levison flouncing out of the room.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Mrs. Levison was that upset,&rsquo; the girl went on, in answer
  to a question put to her by the coroner, &lsquo;that I thought she was going
  to be ill, and she says to me that women like Mrs. Aaron were worse than &#8213;as
  they would stick at nothing to get a new gown or a bit of jewellery. She
  also says to me...&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But at this point the coroner checked her flow of eloquence as, of
  course what the dead woman had said could not be admitted as evidence. But
  nevertheless the impression remained vividly upon the public that there had
  been a terrible quarrel between those two, and of course we all knew that
  young Mrs. Levison had been seen at the ball wearing those five diamond stars;
  we did not need the sworn testimony of several witnesses that were called
  and interrogated on that point. We knew that Rebecca Levison had worn the
  diamond stars at the ball, and that Police Inspector Blackshire found them
  on her dressing-table the morning after the murder.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nor did she deny having worn them. At the inquest she renewed the
  statement which she had already made to the police.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;My brother-in-law, Reuben,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;was a great
  favourite with his mother, and when we were both of us ready dressed he went
  into Mrs. Levison&rsquo;s room to say good night to her. He cajoled her into
  letting me wear the diamond stars that night. In fact he always could make
  her do anything he really wanted, and they parted the best of friends.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;At what time did you go to the ball, Mrs. Levison?&rsquo; the
  coroner asked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;My brother-in-law,&rsquo; she replied, &lsquo;went out to
  call a taxi at half past nine, and he and I got into it the moment one drew
  up.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;And Mr. Reuben Levison had been in to say good night to his
  mother just before that?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Yes, about ten minutes before.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;And he brought you the stars then,&rsquo; the coroner insisted, &lsquo;and
  you put them on before he went out to call the taxi?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;For the fraction of a second Rebecca Levison hesitated, but I do
  not think that anyone in the audience except myself noted that little fact.
  Then she said quite firmly:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Yes, Mr. Reuben Levison told me that he had persuaded his
  mother to let me wear the stars, he handed them to me and I put them on.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;And that was at half-past nine?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Again Rebecca Levison hesitated, this time more markedly; her face
  was very pale and she passed her tongue once or twice across her lips before
  she gave answer.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;At about half-past nine,&rsquo; she said, quite steadily.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;And about what time did you come home, Mrs. Levison?&rsquo; the
  coroner asked her blandly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;It must have been close on one o&rsquo;clock,&rsquo; she replied. &lsquo;The
  dance was a Cinderella, but we walked part of the way home.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&ldquo;What! In the rain?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;It had ceased raining when we came out of the Town Hall.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Mr. Reuben Levison did not accompany you all me way?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;He walked with me across the Park, then he put me into a taxicab
  and I drove home alone. I had my latch-key.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;But you failed to bolt the door after you when you returned.
  How was that?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I forgot, I suppose.&rsquo; the lovely Rebecca replied, with
  a defiant air. &lsquo;I often forget to bolt the door.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;And did you not see or hear anything strange when you came
  in?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I heard nothing. I was rather sleepy and went straight up
  to my room. I was in bed within ten minutes of coming in.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She was speaking quite firmly now, in a clear though rather harsh
  voice: but that she was nervous, not to say frightened, was very obvious.
  She had a handkerchief in her hand, with which she fidgeted until it was
  nothing but a small, wet ball, and she had a habit of standing first on one
  foot then on the other, and of shifting the position of her hat. I do not
  think that there was a single member of the jury who did not think that she
  was lying, and she knew that they thought so, for now and again her fine
  dark eyes would scrutinise their faces and dart glances at them either of
  scorn or of anxiety. After a while she appeared very tired, and when pressed
  by the coroner over some trifling matters she broke down and began to cry.
  After which she was allowed to stand down and Mr. Reuben Levison was called.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I must say that I took an instinctive dislike to him as he stood
  before the jury with a jaunty air of complete self-possession,. He had a
  keen, yet shifty eye, and sharp features, very like a rodent. To me it appeared
  at once that he was reciting a lesson rather than giving independent evidence.
  He stated that he had been present at dinner during the bitter quarrel between
  his mother and sister-in-law, and his mother was certainly very angry at
  the moment, but later on he went upstairs to bid her good night. She cried
  a little and said a few hard things, but in the end she gave way to him as
  she always did: she opened the safe, got out the diamond stars and gave them
  to him, making him promise to return them the very first thing in the morning.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;I told her,&rsquo; Reuben went on glibly, &lsquo;that I would
  not be home until the Monday morning. I would see Rebecca into a taxi after
  the ball, but I had the intention of spending a couple of nights and the
  intervening Sunday with a pal who had a flat at Haverstock Hill. I thought
  then that my mother would lock the stars up again, however&#8213; she was
  always a woman of her word&#8213; once she had said a thing she would stick
  to it&#8213; and so, as I say, she gave me the stars and Mrs. Aaron wore
  them that night.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;And you handed the stars to Mrs. Aaron at half-past nine?&rsquo; The
  coroner asked the question with the same earnest emphasis which he had displayed
  when he put it to young Mrs. Levison. I saw Reuben&rsquo;s shifty eye flash
  across at her, and I know that she answered that flash with a slight drop
  of her eyelids. Whereupon he replied as readily as she had done:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Yes, sir, it must have been about half-past nine.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And I assure you that every intelligent person in that room must
  have felt certain that Reuben was lying just as Rebecca had done before him.
  The inquest was developing on dramatic lines, and the chief actors in the
  play had come to a point of cerebral excitement that was plainly visible
  on their pale, set faces, and there were beads of moisture around their tightly-compressed
  lips which were not entirely attributable to the heat.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The Man in the Corner paused in his narrative. He drank half a glass of
  milk, smacked his lips, and for a few moments appeared intent on examining
  one of the complicated knots which he had made in his bit of string. Then
  after a while he resumed.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The one member of the Levison family,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;for
  whom everyone felt sorry, was the eldest son, Aaron. Like most men of his
  race he had been very fond of his mother, not because of any affection she
  may have shown him but just because she was his mother. He had worked hard
  for her all his life, and now through her death he found himself very much
  left out in the cold. It seems that by her will the old lady left all her
  savings, which, it seems, were considerable, and a certain share in the business,
  to Reuben, whilst to Aaron she only left the business nominally, with a great
  many charges on it in the way of pensions and charitable bequests and whatever
  was due to Reuben.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But here I am digressing, as the matter of the will was not touched
  upon until later on, but there is no doubt that Aaron knew from the first
  that it would be Reuben who would primarily benefit by their mother&rsquo;s
  death. Nevertheless, he did not speak bitterly about his brother, and nothing
  that he said could be construed into possible suspicion of Reuben. He looked
  just a big lump of good nature, splendidly built, with the shoulders and
  gait of an athlete, but with an expression of settled melancholy in his face,
  and a dull, rather depressing voice. Seeing him there, gentle, almost apologetic,
  trying to explain away everything that might in any way cast a reflection
  upon his wife&rsquo;s conduct, one realised easily enough the man&rsquo;s
  position in the family&#8213; a kind of good-natured beast of burden, who
  would do all the work and never receive a &lsquo;thank you&rsquo; in return.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He was not able to throw much light on the horrible tragedy. He,
  too, had been at the dinner-table when the quarrel occurred, but directly
  after dinner he had been obliged to return to the shop, it being Saturday
  night and business very brisk. He had only one assistant to help him, who
  left at nine o&rsquo;clock, after putting up the shutters: but he himself
  remained in the shop until ten o&rsquo;clock to put things away and make
  up the books. He heard the taxi being called and his wife and brother going
  off to the ball; he was not quite sure as to when that was, but he dared
  say it was somewhere near half-past nine. As nothing of special value had
  been pledged that day in the course of business, he had no occasion to go
  and speak with his mother before going up to bed and, on the whole, he thought
  that, as she might still be rather sore and irritable, it would be best not
  to disturb her again, he did just knock at her door, and called out &lsquo;good
  night, mother.&rsquo; But hearing no reply he thought she must already have
  been asleep.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In answer to the coroner Aaron Levison further said that he had slept
  in the spare room at the top of the house for some time, as his wife was
  often very late coming home, and he did not like to have his night&rsquo;s
  rest broken. He had gone up to bed at ten o&rsquo;clock and had neither seen
  nor heard anything in the house until six o&rsquo;clock in the morning when
  the screams of the maid down below had roused him from sleep and made him
  jump out of bed in double-quick time.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Although Aaron&rsquo;s evidence was more or less of a formal character,
  and he spoke very quietly without any show either of swagger or of spite,
  one could not help feeling that the elements of drama and of mystery connected
  with this remarkable case were rather accentuated than diminished by what
  he said. Thus one was more or less prepared for those further developments
  which brought one&rsquo;s excitement and interest in the case to their highest
  point.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Recalled, and pressed by the coroner to try and memorise every event,
  however trifling, that occurred on that Saturday evening, Ida Griggs, the
  maid, said that, soon after she had dropped to sleep, she woke with the feeling
  that she had heard some kind of noise, but what it was she could not define:
  it might have been a bang, or a thud, or a scream. At the time she thought
  nothing of it, whatever it was, because while she lay awake for a few minutes
  afterwards the house was absolutely still; but a moment or two later she
  certainly heard the window of Mrs. Levison&rsquo;s room being thrown open.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;There did not seem to you anything strange in that?&rsquo; the
  coroner asked her.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;No, sir,&rsquo; she replied, &lsquo;there was nothing funny
  in Mrs. Levison opening her window. I remember that it was raining rather
  heavily, for I heard the patter against the window panes, and Mrs. Levison
  may have wanted to look at the weather. I went to sleep directly after that
  and thought no more about it.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;And you don&rsquo;t know what it was that woke you in the
  first instance?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;No, sir, I don&rsquo;t,&rsquo; the girl replied.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;And you did not happen to glance at the clock at the moment?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;No, sir,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;I did not switch on the light.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But having disposed of that point, Ida Griggs had yet another to
  make, and one that proved more dramatic than anything that had gone before.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;While I was clearing away the dinner things,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;Mr.
  Reuben and Mrs. Aaron were sitting talking in the parlour. At half-past eight
  Mrs. Aaron rang for me to take up her hot water as she was going to dress.
  I took up the water for her and also for Mrs. Levison, as I always did. I
  was going to help Mrs. Levison to undress, but she said she was not going
  to bed yet as she had some accounts to go through. She kept me talking for
  a bit, then while I was with her there was a knock at the door and I heard
  Mr. Reuben asking if he might come in and say good night. Mrs. Levison called
  out &ldquo;good night, my boy,&rdquo; but she would not let Mr. Reuben come
  in, and I heard him go downstairs again.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;A quarter of an hour or so afterwards Mrs. Levison dismissed
  me and I heard her locking her door after me. I went downstairs on my way
  to the kitchen: Mrs. Aaron was in the parlour then, fully dressed and with
  her cloak on; and Mr. Reuben was there, too, talking to her. The door was
  wide open and I saw them both and I heard Mrs. Aaron say quite spiteful like: &ldquo;So
  she would not even see you, the old cat! She must have felt bad.&rdquo; And
  Mr. Reuben he laughed and said; &ldquo;Oh&#8213; well, she will have to get
  over it.&rdquo; Then they saw me and stopped talking, and soon afterwards
  Mr. Reuben went out to call a taxi, and we girls went up to bed.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;It is all a wicked lie!&rsquo; here broke in a loud, high-pitched
  voice, and Mrs. Aaron, trembling with excitement, jumped to her feet. &lsquo;A
  lie, I say. The woman is spiteful and wants to ruin me.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The coroner vainly demanded silence, and after a moment or two of
  confusion and of passionate resistance the lovely Rebecca was forcibly led
  out of the room. Her husband followed her, looking bigger and more meek and
  apologetic than ever before; and Ida Griggs was left to conclude her evidence
  in peace. She re-affirmed all that she had said and swore positively to the
  incident just as it had occurred in Mrs. Levison&rsquo;s room. Asked somewhat
  sharply by the coroner why she had said nothing about all this before, she
  replied that she did not wish to make mischief, but that truth was truth,
  and whoever murdered her poor mistress must swing for it, and that&rsquo;s
  all about it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nor could any cross-examination upset her: she looked like a spiteful
  cat, but not like a woman who was lying.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Reuben Levison had sat on, serene and jaunty, all the while that
  these damaging statements were being made against him. When he was recalled
  he contented himself with flatly denying Ida Griggs&rsquo; story, and reiterating
  his own.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;The girl is lying,&rsquo; he said airily, &lsquo;why she does
  so I don&rsquo;t know, but there was nothing in the world more unlikely than
  that my mother should at any time refuse to see me. Ask any impartial witnesses
  you like,&rsquo; he went on dramatically, &lsquo;they will all tell you that
  my mother worshipped me: she was not likely to quarrel with me over a few
  bits of jewellery.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of course Mrs. Aaron, when she was recalled, corroborated Reuben&rsquo;s
  story. She could not make out why Ida should tell such lies about her.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;But there,&rsquo; she added, with tears in her beautiful dark
  eyes, &lsquo;the girl always hated me.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yet one more witness was heard that afternoon whose evidence proved
  of great interest. This was the assistant in the shop, Samuel Kutz. He could
  not throw much light on the tragedy, because he had not been out of the shop
  from six o&rsquo;clock, when he finished his tea, to nine, when he put up
  the shutters and went away. But he did say that, while he was having his
  tea in the back parlour, old Mrs. Levison was helping in the front shop,
  and Mr. Reuben was there, too, doing nothing in particular, as was his custom.
  When witness went back to the shop Mrs. Levison went through into the back
  parlour, and, as soon as she had gone, he noticed that she had left her bag
  on the bureau behind the counter. Mr. Reuben saw it too; he picked up the
  bag and said with a laugh: &lsquo;I&rsquo;d best take it up at once, the
  old girl don&rsquo;t like leaving this about.&rsquo; Kutz told him he thought
  Mrs. Levison was in the back parlour, but Mr. Reuben was sure she had since
  gone upstairs.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Anyway,&rsquo; concluded witness, &lsquo;he took the bag and
  went upstairs with it.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;This may have been a valuable piece of evidence or it may not,&rdquo; the
  Man in the Corner went on with a grin, &ldquo;in view of the tragedy occurring
  so much later, it did not appear to at the time. But it brought in an altogether
  fresh element of conjecture, and while the police asked for an adjournment
  pending fresh inquiries, the public was left to ponder over the many puzzles
  and contradictions that the case presented. Whatever line of argument one
  followed, one quickly came to a dead stop. There was, first of all, the question
  whether Reuben Levison did cajole his mother into giving him the diamond
  stars, or whether he was peremptorily refused admittance to her room: but
  this was just a case of hard swearing between one party and the other, and
  here I must admit, that public opinion was inclined to take Reuben&rsquo;s
  version of the story. Mrs. Levison&rsquo;s passionate affection for her younger
  son was known to all her friends, and people thought that Ida Griggs had
  lied in order to incriminate Mrs. Aaron.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But in this she entirely failed, and here was the first dead stop.
  You will remember that she said that, after she left Mrs. Levison, she went
  downstairs and saw Mrs. Aaron and Mr. Reuben fully dressed in the back parlour,
  and that afterwards she heard Mr. Reuben call a taxi: obviously, therefore,
  Mrs. Aaron had the diamonds in her possession then, since she was wearing
  them at the ball, and it is not conceivable that either of those two would
  have gone off in the taxi, leaving the other to force an entrance into Mrs.
  Levison&rsquo;s room, strangle her, and steal the diamonds. As Mrs. Aaron
  could not possibly have done all that in her evening dress, making her way
  afterwards from a first-floor window down into the yard by clinging to a
  creeper in the pouring rain, the hideous task must have devolved on Reuben,
  and even the police, wildly in search of a criminal, could not put the theory
  forward that a man would murder his mother in order that his sister-in-law
  might wear a few diamond stars at a ball.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It was, in fact, the motive of the crime that seemed so utterly inadequate,
  and therefore public argument fell back on the theory that Reuben had stolen
  the diamond stars, just before dinner after he had found his mother&rsquo;s
  handbag in the shop, and that the subsequent murder was the result of ordinary
  burglary, the miscreant having during the night entered Mrs. Levison&rsquo;s
  room by the window while she was asleep. It was suggested that he had found
  the key of the safe by the bedside and was in the act of ransacking the place
  when Mrs. Levison woke, and the inevitable struggle ensued resulting in the
  old lady&rsquo;s death. The chief argument, however, against this theory
  was the fact that the unfortunate woman was still dressed when she was attacked,
  and no one who knew her for the careful, thrifty woman she was could conceive
  that she would go fast asleep leaving the safe door wide open. This, coupled
  with the fact that not the slightest trace could be found anywhere in the
  backyard of the house, or the adjoining yards and walls of the passage, of
  a miscreant armed with a ladder, constituted another dead stop on the road
  of public conjecture.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Finally, when at the adjourned inquest Reuben Levison was able to
  bring forward more than one witness who could swear that he arrived at the
  ball at the Kensington Town Hall in the company of his sister-in-law somewhere
  about ten o&rsquo;clock, and others who spoke to him from time to time during
  the evening, it seemed clear that he, at any rate, was innocent of the murder.
  Mr. Aaron had not gone up to bed until ten o&rsquo;clock, and if Reuben had
  planned to return and murder his mother he could only have done so at a later
  hour, when he was seen by several people at the Kensington Town Hall.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Subsequently the jury returned an open verdict and that abominable
  crime has remained unpunished until now. Though it appeared so simple and
  crude at first, it proved a terribly hard nut for the police to crack. We
  may say that they never did crack it. They are absolutely convinced that
  Reuben Levison and Mrs. Aaron planned to murder the old lady, but how they
  did it no one has been able to establish. As for proofs of their guilt, there
  are none and never will be, for, though they are perhaps a pair of rascals,
  they are not criminals. It is not they who murdered Mrs. Levison.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You think it was Ida Griggs?&rdquo; I put in quickly, as the Man
  in the Corner momentarily ceased talking.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; he retorted with his funny, dry cackle, &ldquo;you favour
  that theory, do you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, I do not,&rdquo; I replied. &ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t see&#8213;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It is a foolish theory,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;not only because
  there was absolutely no reason why Ida Griggs should kill her mistress&#8213; she
  did not rob her, nor had she anything to gain by old Mrs. Levison&rsquo;s
  death&#8213; but as she was neither a cat, nor a night moth, she could not
  possibly have ascended from a first-floor window to another window on the
  half landing above, and entered her own room that way, for we must not lose
  sight of the fact that her bedroom door was the next morning found locked
  on the outside, and the key left in the lock.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then,&rdquo; I argued, &ldquo;it must have been a case of ordinary
  burglary.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That has been proved impossible,&rdquo; he riposted&#8213; &ldquo;proved
  to the hilt. No man could have climbed up the wall of the house without a
  ladder, and no man could have brought a ladder into the backyard without
  leaving some trace of his passage, however slight: against the walls, around
  the yard, there were creepers and shrubs&#8213; it would be impossible to
  drag a heavy ladder over those walls without breaking some of them.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But someone killed old Mrs. Levison,&rdquo; I went on, with some
  exasperation&#8213; &ldquo;she did not strangle herself with her own fingers.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, she did not do that,&rdquo; he admitted with a dry laugh.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And if the murderer escaped through the window, he could not vanish
  into thin air.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; he admitted again, &ldquo;he could not do that.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well then?&rdquo; I retorted.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well then, the murder must have been committed by one of the inmates
  of the house,&rdquo; he said; and now I knew that I was on the point of hearing
  the solution of the mystery of the five diamond stars, because his thin claw-like
  fingers were working with feverish rapidity upon his beloved bit of string.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But neither Mrs. Aaron,&rdquo; I argued, &ldquo;nor Reuben Levison&#8213;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Neither,&rdquo; he broke in decisively. &ldquo;We all know that.
  It was not conceivable that a woman could commit such a murder, nor that
  Reuben would kill his mother in order to gratify his sister-in-law&rsquo;s
  whim. That, of course, was nonsense, and every proof, both of time and circumstance,
  both of motive and opportunity, was entirely in their favour. No. We must
  look for a deeper motive for the hideous crime, a stronger determination,
  and above all a more powerful physique and easier opportunity for carrying
  the plot through. Personally, I do not believe that there was a plot to murder;
  on the other hand I do believe in the man who idolised his young wife and
  had witnessed a deadly quarrel between her and his mother, and I do believe
  in his going presently to the latter in order to try and soothe her anger
  against the woman he loved.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You mean,&rdquo; I gasped, incredulous and scornful, &ldquo;that
  it was Aaron Levison?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of course I mean that,&rdquo; he replied placidly; &ldquo;and if
  you think over all the circumstances of the case you will readily agree with
  me. We know that Aaron Levison loved and admired his wife; we know that he
  was very athletic, and altogether an outdoor man. Bear these two facts in
  mind and let your thoughts follow the man after the terrible quarrel at the
  dinner-table. For a while he is busy in the shop, probably brooding over
  his mother&rsquo;s anger and the unpleasant consequences it might have for
  the lovely Rebecca. But presently he goes upstairs determined to speak with
  his mother, to plead with her. Dreading that Ida Griggs, with the habit of
  her kind, might sneak out of her room, and perhaps glue her ear to the keyhole,
  he turns the key in the lock of the girl&rsquo;s bedroom door. He knows that
  the interview with his mother will be unpleasant, that hard words will be
  spoken against Rebecca, and these he does not wish Ida Griggs to hear.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then he knocks at his mother&rsquo;s door, and asks admittance on
  the pretext that he has something of value to remit to her for keeping in
  her safe. She would have no reason to refuse. He goes in, talks to his mother;
  she does not mince her words. By now she knows that the diamond stars have
  been extracted from the safe, stolen by her beloved Reuben for the adornment
  of the hated daughter-in-law.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you see those two arguing over the woman whom the man
  loves and whom the older woman hates? Can&rsquo;t you see the latter using
  words which outrage the husband&rsquo;s pride and rouses his wrath till it
  gets beyond his control? Can&rsquo;t you see him in an access of unreasoning
  passion gripping his mother by the throat, to smother the insults hurled
  at his wife?&#8213; and can you see the old woman losing her balance, and
  hitting her head against the corner of the marble washstand and falling&#8213; falling&#8213; whilst
  the son gazes down, frantic and horror-struck at what he has done?</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then the instinct of self-preservation is roused. Oh, the man was
  cleverer than he was given credit for! He remembers with satisfaction locking
  Ida Grigg&rsquo;s door from the outside; and now to give the horrible accident
  the appearance of ordinary burglary! He locks his mother&rsquo;s door on
  the inside, switches out the light, then throws open the window. For a youngish
  man who is active and athletic the drop from a first-floor window, with the
  aid of a creeper on the wall, presents but little difficulty, and when a
  man is faced with a deadly peril, minor dangers do not deter him. Fortunately
  everything has occurred before he has bolted and barred the downstairs doors
  for the night. This, of course, greatly facilitates matters. He lets himself
  down through the window, jumps down into the yard, lets himself into the
  house through the back door, then closes up everything, and quietly goes
  upstairs to bed.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There has not been much noise, even his mother&rsquo;s fall was practically
  soundless, and&#8213; poor thing!&#8213; she had not the time to scream;
  the only sound was the opening of the window; it certainly would not bring
  Ida Griggs out of her bed&#8213; girls of her class are more likely to smother
  their heads under their bedclothes if any alarming noise is heard. And so
  the unfortunate man is able to sneak up to his room unseen and unheard. Whoever
  would dream of casting suspicion on him? He was never mixed up in any quarrel
  with his mother, and he had nothing much to gain by her death. At the inquest
  everyone was sorry for him; but I could not repress a feeling of admiration
  for the coolness and cleverness with which he obliterated every trace of
  his crime. I imagine him carefully wiping his boots before he went upstairs,
  and brushing and folding up his clothes before he went to bed. Cannot you?</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A clever criminal, what?&rdquo; the whimsical creature concluded,
  as he put his piece of string in the pocket of his funny tweed coat. &ldquo;Think
  of it&#8213; you will see that I am right. As you say, Mrs. Levison did not
  strangle herself, and a burglar from the outside could not have vanished
  into thin air.&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="TheMysteryOfTheDogsToothCliff"></a>The Mystery Of The Dog&rsquo;s Tooth Cliff</b> </h2>
  <p>The Man in the Corner was more than usually loquacious that day; he had
  a great deal to say on the subject of the strictures which a learned judge
  levelled against the police in a recent murder case.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well deserved,&rdquo; he concluded with his usual self-opinionated
  emphasis, &ldquo;but not more so in this case than in many others, where
  blunder after blunder is committed and the time of the courts wasted without
  either judge or magistrate, let alone the police, knowing where the hitch
  lies.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of course you always know,&rdquo; I remarked drily.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nearly always,&rdquo; he replied with ludicrous self-complacence. &ldquo;Have
  I not proved to you over and over again that with a little reasonable common
  sense and a minimum of logic there is no such thing as an impenetrable mystery
  in criminology. Criminology is an exact science to which certain rules of
  reasoning invariably apply. The trouble is that so few are masters of logic
  and that fewer still know how to apply its rules. Now take the case of that
  poor girl, Janet Smith. We are likely to see some startling developments
  in it within the next two or three days. You&rsquo;ll see if we don&rsquo;t,
  and they will open the eyes of the police and public alike to what has been
  dear as daylight to me ever since the first day of the inquest.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I hastened to assure the whimsical creature that, though I was acquainted
  with the main circumstances of the tragedy, I was very vague as to detail,
  and that nothing would give me more pleasure than that he should enlighten
  my mind on the subject&#8213; which he immediately proceeded to do.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You know Broxmouth, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; he began after a while&#8213;&rdquo;on
  the Wessex coast. It is a growing place, for the scenery is superb and the
  air acts on jaded spirits like sparkling wine. The only drawback&#8213; that
  is, from an artistic point of view&#8213; to the place, is that hideous barrack-like
  building on the West Cliff. It is a huge industrial school recently erected
  and endowed by the trustees of the Woodforde bequest for the benefit of sons
  of temporary officers killed in the War, and is under the presidency of no
  less a personage than General Sir Arkwright Jones who has a whole alphabet
  after his name.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The building is certainly an eyesore, and, before it came into being,
  Broxmouth was a real beauty spot. If you have ever been there, you will remember
  that fine walk along the edge of the cliffs, at the end of which there is
  a wonderful view as far as the towers of Barchester cathedral. It is called
  the &lsquo;Lovers&rsquo; Walk,&rsquo; and is patronised by all the young
  people in the neighbourhood. They find it romantic as well as exhilarating:
  the objective is usually Kurtmoor, where there are one or two fine hotels
  for plutocrats in search of rural surroundings, and where humble folk like
  you and I and the aforesaid lovers can get an excellent cup of tea at the
  Wheatsheaf in the main village street.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But it is a daylight walk, for the path is narrow and in places the
  cliffs fall away, sheer and precipitous, to the water&rsquo;s edge, whilst
  loose bits of rock have an unpleasant way of giving way under one&rsquo;s
  feet. If you were to consult one of the Broxmouth gaffers on the advisability
  of taking a midnight walk to Kurtmoor, he would most certainly shake his
  head, and tell you to wait till the next day and take your walk in the morning.
  Accidents have happened there&#8213; more than one&#8213; though Broxmouth
  holds its tongue about that. Rash pedestrians have lost their footing and
  tumbled down the side of the cliff before now, almost always with fatal results.
  And so, at first when a couple of small boys, hunting for mussels at low
  tide in the early morning of May 5th last, saw the body of woman lying inanimate
  upon the rocks at the foot of the cliffs, and reported their discovery to
  the police, everyone began concluding that nothing but an accident had occurred,
  and went on to abuse the Town Council for not putting up along the more dangerous
  portions of the &lsquo;Lovers&rsquo; Walk&rsquo; some sort of barrier as
  a protection to unwary pedestrians.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Later on, when the body was identified as that of Janet Smith, a
  well-known resident of Broxmouth, public indignation waxed high: the barrier
  along the edge of the Lovers&rsquo; Walk became the burning question of the
  hour. But during the whole of that day the &lsquo;accident&rsquo; theory
  was never disputed; it was only towards evening that whispers of &lsquo;suicide&rsquo; began
  to circulate in and about Broxmouth, to be soon followed by the more ominous
  ones of &lsquo;murder.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And by the next morning Broxmouth had the thrill of its life when
  it became known throughout the town that Captain Franklin Marston had been
  detained in connection with the finding of the body of Janet Smith, and that
  he would appear that day before the magistrate on a charge of murder.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Properly to appreciate the significance of such an announcement,
  it would be necessary to be oneself a resident of Broxmouth where the Woodforde
  Institute, its affairs and its personnel are, as it were, the be-all and
  end-all of all the gossip in the neighbourhood. To begin with, the deceased
  was head matron of the Institute, and the man, now accused of the foul crime
  of having murdered her, was its secretary; moreover the secretary and the
  pretty young matron were known to be very much in love with one another,
  and, as a matter of fact, Broxmouth had of late been looking forward to a
  very interesting wedding. The idea of Captain Marston&#8213; who by the way
  was very good-looking, very smart, and a splendid tennis player&#8213; being
  accused of murdering his sweetheart was in itself so preposterous, so impossible,
  that his numerous friends and many admirers were aghast and incredulous. &lsquo;There
  is some villainous plot here somewhere,&rsquo; the ladies averred, and wanted
  to know what Major Gubbins&rsquo;s attitude was going to be under these tragic
  circumstances.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Major Gubbins, if you remember, was headmaster of the school, and
  what&rsquo;s more he, too, had been very much in love with Janet Smith, but
  it appeared that his friendship with Captain Marston had prompted him to
  stand aside as soon as he realised which way the girl&rsquo;s affections
  lay. Major Gubbins was not so popular as the Captain, he was inclined to
  be off-hand and disagreeable, so the ladies said, and moreover he did not
  play tennis, and, with the sublime inconsequence of your charming sex, they
  seemed to connect these defects with terrible accusation which was now weighing
  upon the Major&rsquo;s successful rival.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The executive of the Institute consisted, in addition to the three
  persons I have named, of its president, General Sir Arkwright Jones, who,
  it seems, took little if any interest in the concern. It seems as if, by
  giving it the prestige of his name, he had done all that he intended for
  the furtherance of the Institute&rsquo;s welfare. Then there were the governors,
  a number of amiable local gentlemen and ladies who played tennis all day
  and attended innumerable tea-parties and knew as much about administering
  a big concern as a terrier does of rabbit-rearing. In the midst of this official
  supineness, the murder of the young matron, followed immediately by the arrest
  of the secretary, had come as a bombshell, and now wise heads began to wag
  and ominous murmurs became current that for some time past there had been
  something very wrong in the management of the Woodforde Institute. Whilst,
  at the call of various august personages, money was pouring in from the benevolent
  public, the commissariat was being conducted on parsimonious lines that were
  a positive scandal: the boys were shockingly underfed and the staff of servants
  was constantly being changed because girls would not remain on what they
  called a starvation regime.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then again, no proper accounts had been kept since the inception
  of the Institute five years ago; entries were spasmodic, irregular and unreliable;
  books were never audited; no one apparently had the slightest idea of profit
  and loss or of balances; no one knew from week to week where the salaries
  and wages were coming from, or from quarter to quarter if there would be
  funds enough to meet rates and taxes; no one, in fact, appeared to know anything
  about the affairs of the Institute, least of all the secretary himself who
  had often remarked quite jocularly that he had never in all his life known
  anything about book-keeping and that his appointment by the governors rested
  upon his agreeable personality rather than upon his financial and administrative
  ability.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;As you see, the Captain&rsquo;s position was, in consequence of this,
  a very serious one: it became still more so when presently two or three ominous
  facts came to light. To begin with, it seemed that he could give absolutely
  no account of himself during the greater part of the night of May 5th. He
  had left the Institute at about seven o&rsquo;clock; he told the headmaster
  then that he was going for a walk which seemed strange as it was pouring
  with rain. On the other hand the landlady at the room where he lodged told
  the police that when she herself went to bed at eleven o&rsquo;clock the
  Captain had not come in: she hadn&rsquo;t seen him since morning, when he
  went to work and at what time he eventually came home she couldn&rsquo;t
  say. But there was worse to come: firstly, a stick was found on the beach
  some thirty yards or less from the spot where the body itself was discovered;
  and secondly, the police produced a few strands of wool which were, it seems,
  clinging to the poor girl&rsquo;s hat-pin, and which presumably were torn
  out of a muffler during the brief struggle which must have occurred when
  she was first attacked and before she lost her footing and fell down the
  side of the cliff.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now the stick was identified as the property of Captain Marston,
  and he had been seen on the road with it in his hand in the early part of
  the evening. He was then walking alone on the &lsquo;Lover&rsquo;s Walk&rsquo;;
  two Broxmouth visitors met him on their way back from Kurtmoor. Knowing him
  by sight, they passed the time of day. These witnesses, however, were quite
  sure that Captain Marston was not then wearing a muffler, on the other hand
  they were equally sure that he carried the stick; they had noticed it as
  a very unusual one, of what is known as Javanese snake-wood with a round
  heavy knob and leather strap which the Captain carried slung upon his arm.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of course the matter interested me enormously; it is not often that
  a person of the social and intellectual calibre of Captain Marston stands
  accused of so foul a crime. It he was guilty, then indeed he was one of the
  vilest criminals that ever defaced God&rsquo;s earth, and in the annals of
  crime there were few crimes more hideous. The poor girl, it seems, had been
  in love with him right up to the end and, according to some well-informed
  gossips, the wedding day had actually been fixed.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The unsuccessful rival, Major Gubbins, too, was an interesting personality,
  and it was difficult to suppose that he was entirely ignorant of the events
  which must of necessity have led up to the crime. Supposedly there had been
  a quarrel between the lovers; sundry rumours were current as to this and
  in a vague way those rumours connected this quarrel with the shaky financial
  situation of the Institute. But it was all mere surmise and very contradictory;
  no one could easily state what possible connection there could be between
  the affairs of the Institution and the murder of the chief matron.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In the meanwhile the accused had been brought up before the magistrate,
  and formal evidence of the finding of the body and of the arrest was given,
  as well as of the subsequent discovery of the stick which was identified
  by the two witnesses and of the strands of wool. The accused was remanded
  until the following Monday, bail being refused. The inquest was held a day
  or two later and I went down to Broxmouth for it. I remember how hot it was
  in that crowded court-room: excited and perspiring humanity filled the stuffy
  atmosphere with heat. While the crowd jabbered and fidgeted I had a good
  look at the chief personages who were about to enact a thrilling drama for
  my entertainment; you have seen portraits of them all in the illustrated
  papers, the British Army being well represented by a trio of as fine specimens
  of manhood as anyone would wish to see.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The President, General Arkwright Jones, was there as a matter of
  course. He looked worried and annoyed that the even tenor of his pleasant
  existence should have been disturbed by this tiresome event; he is the regular
  type of British pre-war superior officer with ruddy face and white hair,
  something like a nice ripe tomato that has been packed in cotton wool. Then
  there was the headmaster, Major Gubbins, well-groomed, impassive, immaculate
  in dress and bearing; and finally the accused himself, in charge of two warders,
  fine-looking man, obviously more of a soldier and an athlete than a clerk
  immersed in figures.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Two other persons in the crowded room arrested my attention: two
  women. One of them dressed in deep black, thin-lipped, with pale round eyes
  and pursed-up mouth was Miss Amelia Smith, the sister with whom deceased
  had been living, and the other was Louisa Rumble who held the position of
  housekeeper at the Woodforde Institute. The latter was one of the first witnesses
  called, and her evidence was intensely interesting because it gave one the
  first clue as to the motive which underlay the hideous crime. The woman&rsquo;s
  testimony, you must know, bore entirely on the question of housekeeping and
  of the extraordinary scarcity of money in the richly-endowed Institute.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Often and often,&rsquo; said the witness, a motherly old soul
  in a flamboyant bonnet, &lsquo;did I complain to Miss Smith when she give
  me my weekly allowance for the tradesmen&rsquo;s books: &ldquo;&rsquo;Tisn&rsquo;t
  enough, Miss Smith, I says to &rsquo;er, not to feed a family, I says, let
  alone thirty growin&rsquo; boys and &lsquo;alf a dozen working girls.&rdquo; But
  Miss Smith she just shook &rsquo;er &rsquo;ead and says: &ldquo;Committee&rsquo;s
  orders, Mrs. Rumble, I &rsquo;ave no power.&rdquo; &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t
  you speak to the Captain?&rdquo; I says to &rsquo;er, &ldquo;&rsquo;e &rsquo;as
  the &rsquo;andling of the money; it is a scandal,&rdquo; I says. &ldquo;Those
  boys can&rsquo;t live on boiled bacon an&rsquo; beans and not English nor
  Irish bacon, it ain&rsquo;t, neither,&rdquo; I says. &ldquo;Pore lambs. The
  money I &rsquo;ave won&rsquo;t pay for beef or mutton for them, Miss Smith,&rdquo; I
  says, &ldquo;and you know it.&rdquo; But Miss Smith, she only shook &rsquo;er &rsquo;ead
  and says she would speak to the Captain about it.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Asked whether she knew if deceased had actually spoken to the secretary
  on the subject, Mrs. Rumble said most emphatically, &lsquo;Yes!&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;What&rsquo;s more, sir,&rsquo; she went on, &lsquo;I can tell
  you that the very day before she died, the pore lamb &rsquo;ad a reg&rsquo;lar
  tiff with the Captain about that there commissariat.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mrs. Rumble had stumbled a little over the word, but strangely enough
  no one tittered; the importance of the old woman&rsquo;s testimony was impressed
  upon every mind and silenced every tongue. All eyes were turned in the direction
  of the accused. He had flushed to the roots of his hair, but otherwise stood
  quite still, with arms folded, and a dull expression of hopelessness upon
  his good-looking face.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The coroner had asked the witness how she knew that Miss Smith had
  had words with the Captain Marston: &lsquo;Because I &rsquo;eard them two &rsquo;aving
  words, sir,&rsquo; Mrs. Rumble replied. &lsquo;I&rsquo;d been in the office
  to get my money and my orders from Miss Smith, and we &rsquo;ad the usual
  talk about American bacon and boiled beans with which I don&rsquo;t &rsquo;old,
  not for growing boys; then back I went to the kitchen, when I remembered
  I &rsquo;ad forgot to speak to Miss Smith about the scullery maid, who&rsquo;d
  been saucy and given notice. So up I went again and I was just a goin&rsquo; to
  open the office door when I &rsquo;eard Miss Smith say quite loud and distinck: &ldquo;It
  is shameful,&rdquo; she says, &ldquo;and I can&rsquo;t bear it,&rdquo; she
  says, &ldquo;and if you won&rsquo;t speak to the General then I will. He
  is staying at the Queen&rsquo;s at Kurtmoor, I understand,&rdquo; she says, &ldquo;and
  I am goin&rsquo; this very night to speak with him,&rdquo; she says, &ldquo;as
  I can&rsquo;t spend another night,&rdquo; she says, &ldquo;with this on my
  mind.&rdquo; Then I give a genteel cough and...&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The worthy lady had got thus far in her story when her volubility
  was suddenly checked by a violent expletive from the accused.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;But this is damnable!&rsquo; he cried, and no doubt would
  have said a lot more, but a touch on his shoulder from the warders behind
  him quickly recalled him to himself. He once more took up his outwardly calm
  attitude, and Mrs. Rumble concluded her evidence amidst silence more ominous
  than any riotous scene would have been.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I give a genteel cough,&rsquo; she resumed, with unruffled
  dignity, &lsquo;and opened the door. Miss Smith, she was all flushed and
  I could see that she&rsquo;d been crying; but the Captain &rsquo;e just walked
  out of the room, and didn&rsquo;t say not another word.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;By this time,&rdquo; the Man in the Corner went on drily, &ldquo;we
  must suppose that the amateur detectives and the large body of unintelligent
  public felt that they were being cheated. Never had there been so simple
  a case. Here, with the testimony of Mrs. Rumble, was the whole thing clear
  as daylight&#8213; motive, quarrel, means, everything was there already.
  No chance of exercising those powers of deduction so laboriously acquired
  by a systematic study of detective fiction. Had it not been for the position
  of the accused and his popularity in Broxmouth society, all interest in the
  case would have departed in the wake of Mrs. Rumble, and at first when Amelia
  Smith, sister of the deceased, was called, her appearance only roused languid
  curiosity. Miss Amelia looked, what in fact, she was: a retired school marm,
  and wore the regular hall mark of impecunious and somewhat soured spinsterhood.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Janet often told me,&rsquo; she said in the course of her
  evidence,&rsquo; that she was quite sure there was roguery going on in the
  affairs of the Institute, because she knew for a fact that subscriptions
  were constantly pouring in from the public, far in excess of what was being
  spent, for the welfare of the boys. I often used to urge her to go straight
  to the governors or even to the President himself about the whole matter,
  but she would always give the same disheartened reply. General Arkwright
  Jones, it seems, had made it a condition when he accepted the presidency
  that he was never to be worried about the administration of the place, and
  he refused to have anything to do with the handling of the subscriptions;
  as for the governors, my poor sister declared that they cared more for tennis
  parties than for the welfare of a lot of poor officers&rsquo; children.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But a moment or two later we realised that Miss Amelia Smith was
  keeping her titbit of evidence until the end. It seems that she had not even
  spoken about it to the police, determined as she was, no doubt, to create
  a sensation for once in her monotonous and dreary life. So now she pursed
  up her lips tighter than before, and after a moment&rsquo;s dramatic silence,
  she said:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;The day before her death, my poor sister was very depressed.
  In the late afternoon, when she came in for tea, I could see that she had
  been crying. I guessed, of course, what was troubling her, but I didn&rsquo;t
  say much. Captain Franklin Marston was in the habit of calling for Janet
  in the evening and they would go for a walk together; at eight o&rsquo;clock
  on that sad evening I asked her whether Captain Marston was coming as usual,
  whereupon she became quite excited and said: &ldquo;No, no, I don&rsquo;t
  wish to see him!&rdquo; and after a while she added in a voice choked with
  tears: &ldquo;Never again!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;About a quarter of an hour later,&rsquo; Miss Amelia went
  on, &lsquo;Janet suddenly took up her hat and coat. I asked her where she
  was going and she said to me: &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know but I must put an
  end to all this. I must know one way or the other.&rdquo; I tried to question
  her further, but she was in an obstinate mood; when I remarked that it was
  raining hard she said; &ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right, the rain will do me
  good.&rdquo; And when I asked her whether she wasn&rsquo;t going to meet
  Captain Marston after all, she just gave me a look, but she made no reply.
  And so my poor sister went out into the darkness and the rain, and I never
  again saw her alive.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She paused just long enough to give true dramatic value to her statement,
  and indeed there was nothing lukewarm now about the interest which she aroused;
  then she continued: &lsquo;As the clock was striking nine I was surprised
  to receive a visit from the headmaster, Major Gubbins. He came with a message
  from Captain Marston to my sister; I told him that Janet had gone out. He
  appeared vexed, and told me that the Captain would be terribly disappointed.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;What was this message?&rsquo; the coroner asked, amidst breathless
  silence.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;That Janet would please meet Captain Marston at the Dog&rsquo;s
  Tooth Cliff. He would wait for her there until nine o&rsquo;clock.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>The Man in the Corner gave a short, sharp laugh, and with loving eyes contemplated
  his bit of string, in which he had just woven an elegant and complicated
  knot. Then he said:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now it was at the foot of the Dog&rsquo;s Tooth Cliff that the dead
  body of Janet Smith was found, and some thirty yards further on the stick
  which had last been seen in the hand of Captain Franklin Marston. Nervous
  women gave a gasp and scarcely dared to look at the accused for fear no doubt
  that they would see the hangman&rsquo;s rope around his neck, but I took
  a good look at him then. He had uttered a loud groan and buried his face
  in his hands, and I, with that unerring intuition of which I pride myself,
  knew that he was acting, Yes, deliberately acting a part&#8213; the part
  of shame and despair. You, no doubt, would ask me why he should have done
  this. Well, you shall understand presently. For the moment, and to all unthinking
  spectators, the attitude of despair on the part of the accused appeared fully
  justified.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Later on we heard the evidence of Major Gubbins himself. He said
  that about seven o&rsquo; clock he met Captain Marston in the hall of the
  Institute.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;He appeared flushed and agitated,&rsquo; the witness went
  on, very reluctantly it seemed, but in answer to pressing questions put to
  him by the coroner, &lsquo;and told me he was going for a walk. When I remarked
  that it was raining hard, he retorted that the rain would do him good. He
  didn&rsquo;t say where he was going, but presently he put his hand on my
  shoulder and said in a tone of pleading and affection which I shall never
  forget: &ldquo;Old man,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I want you to do something
  for me. Tell Janet that I must see her again tonight; beg her not to deny
  me. I will meet her at our usual place on the Dog&rsquo;s Tooth Cliff. Tell
  her I will wait for her there until nine o&rsquo;clock, whatever the weather.
  But she must come. Tell her she must.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Unfortunately,&rsquo; the Major continued, &lsquo;I was unable
  to deliver the message immediately as I had work to do in my office which
  kept me till close on nine o&rsquo;clock. Then I hurried down to the Smiths&rsquo; house
  and just missed Miss Janet who, it seems, had already gone out.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Asked why he had not spoken about this before, the Major replied
  that he did not intend to give evidence at all unless he was absolutely forced
  to do so as a matter of duty. Captain Marston was his friend and he did not
  think that any man was called upon to give what might prove damnatory evidence
  against his friend.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;All of which sounded very nice and very loyal until we learned that
  William Peryer, batman at the Institute, testified to having overheard violent
  words between the headmaster and the secretary at the very same hour when
  the latter was supposed to have made so pathetic an appeal to his friend
  to deliver a message on his behalf. Peryer swore that the two men were quarrelling
  and quarrelling bitterly. The words he overheard were: &lsquo;You villain!
  You shall pay for this!&rsquo; But he was so upset and so frightened that
  he could not state positively which of the two gentlemen had spoken them,
  but he was inclined to think that it was Major Gubbins.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And so the tangle grew, a tangled web that was dexterously being
  woven around the secretary of the Institute. The two Broxmouth visitors were
  recalled, and they once more swore positively to having met Captain Marston
  on the &lsquo;Lover&rsquo;s Walk&rsquo; at about eight o&rsquo;clock of that
  fateful evening. They spoke to him and they noticed the stick which he was
  carrying. They were on their way home from Kurtmoor, and they met the Captain
  some two hundred yards or so before they came to the Dog&rsquo;s Tooth Cliff.
  Of this they were both quite positive. The lady remembered coming to the
  cliff a few minutes later: she was nervous in the dark and therefore the
  details of the incident impressed themselves upon her memory. Subsequently
  when they were nearing home they met a lady who might or might not have been
  the deceased; they did not know her by sight and the person they met had
  her hat pulled down over her eyes and the collar of her coat up to her ears.
  It was raining hard then, and they themselves were hurrying along and paid
  no attention to passers-by.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We also heard that at about nine o&rsquo;clock James Hoggs and his
  wife, who live in a cottage not very far from the Dog&rsquo;s Tooth Cliff,
  heard a terrifying scream. They were just going to bed and closing up for
  the night. Hoggs had the front door open at the moment and was looking at
  the weather. It was raining, but nevertheless he picked up his cap and ran
  oat toward the cliff. A moment or two later he came up against a man whom
  he hailed; it was very dark, but he noticed that the man was engaged in wrapping
  a muffler round his neck. He asked him whether he had heard a scream, but
  the man said: &lsquo;No, I&rsquo;ve not!&rsquo; then hurried quickly out
  of sight. As Hoggs heard nothing more, or saw anything, he thought that perhaps
  after all he and his missis had been mistaken, so he turned back home and
  went to bed.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I think,&rdquo; the Man in the Corner continued thoughtfully, &ldquo;that
  I have now put before you all the most salient points in the chain of evidence
  collected by the police against the accused. There were not many faulty links
  in the chain you will admit. The motive for the hideous crime was clear enough:
  for there was the fraudulent secretary and the unfortunate girl who had suspected
  the defalcations and was threatening to go and denounce her lover, either
  to the President of the Institute or to the governors.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And the method was equally clear: the meeting in the dark and the
  rain on the lonely cliff, the muffler quickly thrown round the victim&rsquo;s
  mouth to smother her screams, the blow with the stick, the push over the
  edge of the cliff. The stick stood up as an incontestable piece of evidence;
  the absence from home of the accused during the greater part of that night
  had been testified by his landlady, whilst his presence on the scene of the
  crime some time during the evening was not disputed. As a matter of fact
  the only point in the man&rsquo;s favour were the strands of wool found sticking
  to the girl&rsquo;s hat pin and Hoggs&rsquo;s story of the man whom he had
  seen in the dark, engaged in readjusting a muffler around his neck. Unfortunately
  Hoggs, when more closely questioned on that subject, became incoherent and
  confused as men of his class are apt to do when pinned down to a definite
  statement.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Anyway, the accused was committed for trial on the coroner&rsquo;s
  warrant, and of course reserved his defence. You probably, like the rest
  of the public, kept up a certain amount of interest in the Cliff murder,
  as it was popularly called, for a time, and then allowed your mind to dwell
  on other matters and forgot poor Captain Franklin Marston who was languishing
  in gaol under such a horrible accusation. Subsequently, your interest in
  him revived when he was brought up for trial the other day at the Barchester
  Assizes. In the meanwhile he had secured the services of Messrs. Chamton
  and Inglewood, the noted solicitors, who had engaged Mr. Provost Boon, K.C.,
  to defend their client.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You know as well as I do what happened at the trial, and how Mr.
  Boon turned the witnesses for the Crown inside out and round about until
  they contradicted themselves and one another all along the line. The defence
  was conducted in a masterly fashion. To begin with the worthy housekeeper,
  Mrs. Rumble, after a stiff cross-examination which lasted nearly an hour,
  was forced to admit that she could not swear positively to the exact words
  which she overheard between the deceased and Captain Marston. All that she
  could swear to was that the Captain and his sweetheart had apparently had
  a tiff. Then, as to Miss Amelia Smith&rsquo;s evidence: it also merely went
  to prove that the lovers had had a quarrel; there was nothing whatever to
  say that it was on the subject of finance, or that deceased had any intention
  either of speaking to the President about it, or of handing in her resignation
  to the governors.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Next came the question of Major Gubbins&rsquo;s story of the message
  which he had been asked by his friend to deliver to the deceased. Now accused
  flatly denied that story, and denied it on oath. The whole thing, he declared,
  was a fabrication on the part of the Major, who, far from being his friend,
  was his bitter enemy and unsuccessful rival. In support of his theory William
  Peryer&rsquo;s evidence was cited as conclusive. He had heard the two men
  quarrelling at the very moment when accused was alleged to have made a pathetic
  appeal to his friend. Peryer had heard one of them say to the other: &lsquo;You
  villain! You shall pay for this!&rsquo; And, in very truth, the unfortunate
  Captain was paying for it, in humiliation and racking anxiety.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then there came the great, the vital question of the stick, and of
  the strands of wool so obviously torn out of a muffler. With regard to the
  stick, the accused had stated that in the course of his walk he had caught
  his foot against a stone and stumbled, and that the stick had fallen out
  of his hand and over the edge of the cliff. Now this statement was certainly
  borne out by the fact that, as eminent counsel reminded the jury, the stick
  was found more than thirty yards away from the body. As for the muffler,
  it was a graver point still; strands of wool were found sticking to the girl&rsquo;s
  hat pin and James Hoggs, after hearing a scream at nine o&rsquo;clock that
  evening, ran out toward the cliff and came across a man who was engaged in
  readjusting a muffler round his throat.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That was incontestable. Of course, Mr. Boon argued, it was easy enough
  to upset a witness of the type of James Hoggs, but an English jury&rsquo;s
  duty was not to fasten guilt on the first man who happens to be handy, but
  to see justice meted out to innocent and guilty alike. The evidence of the
  muffler, argued the eminent counsel, was proof positive of the innocence
  of the accused. The witnesses who saw him in the Lover&rsquo;s Walk on that
  fateful night had declared most emphatically that he was not wearing a muffler.
  Then where was the man with the muffler? Where was the man who was within
  a few yards of the scene of the crime five minutes after James Hoggs had
  heard the scream&#8213; the man who had denied hearing the scream, although
  both Hoggs and his wife heard it over a quarter of a mile away?</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Yes, gentlemen of the jury,&rsquo; the eminent counsel concluded
  with a dramatic gesture, &lsquo;it is the man with the muffler who murdered
  the unfortunate girl. If he is innocent, why is he not here to give evidence?
  There are no side tracks that lead to the cliffs at this point, so the man
  with the muffler must have seen something or someone; he must know something
  that would be of invaluable assistance to the elucidation of this sad mystery.
  Then why does he not come forward? I say because he dare not. But let the
  police look for him, I say. The accused is innocent; he is the victim of
  tragic circumstances, but his whole life, his war record, his affection for
  the deceased, all proclaim him to be guiltless of such a dastardly crime,
  and above all there stands the incontestable proof of his innocence, the
  muffler, gentlemen of the jury&#8213; the muffler!</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He said a lot more than that, of course,&rdquo; the Man in the Corner
  went on, chuckling drily to himself, &ldquo;and said it a lot better than
  ever I can repeat it, but I have given you the gist of what he said. You
  know the result of the trial. The accused was acquitted, the jury having
  deliberated less than a quarter of an hour. There was no getting away from
  that muffler, even though every other circumstance pointed to Marston as
  the murderer of Janet Smith. On the whole his acquittal was a popular one,
  although many who were present at the trial shook their heads and thought
  that if they had been on the jury Marston would not have got off so easily,
  but for the most part these sceptics were not Broxmouth people. In Broxmouth
  the Captain was personally liked, and the proclamation of his innocence was
  hailed with enthusiasm; and, what&rsquo;s more, those same champions of the
  good-looking secretary&#8213; they were the women mostly&#8213; looked askance
  on the headmaster who, they averred, had woven a Machiavellian net for trapping
  and removing from his path for ever a hated and successful rival. The police
  have received a perfect deluge of anonymous communications suggesting that
  Major Gubbins was identical with the mysterious man with the muffler, but
  of course such a suggestion is perfectly absurd, since at the very hour when
  James Hoggs heard the scream and a very few minutes before he met the man
  with the muffler, Major Gubbins was paying his belated visit to Miss Amelia
  Smith and delivering the alleged message. Even those ladies who disliked
  the headmaster most cordially had to admit that he could not very well have
  been in two places at the same time. The Dog&rsquo;s Tooth Cliff is a good
  half-hour&rsquo;s walk from Miss Smith&rsquo;s house to the &lsquo;Lover&rsquo;s
  Walk&rsquo; itself and is not accessible to cyclists or motors.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And thus to all intents and purposes the Cliff murder has remained
  a mystery, but it won&rsquo;t be one for long. Have I not told you that you
  may expect important developments within the next few days? And I am seldom
  wrong. Already in this evening&rsquo;s paper you will have read that the
  entire executive of the Woodforde Institute has placed its resignation in
  the hands of the governors, that several august personages have withdrawn
  their names from the list of patrons, and that though the President has been
  implored not to withdraw his name, he has proved adamant on the subject,
  and even refused to recommend successors to the headmaster, the secretary
  or the matron; in fact, he has seemingly washed his hands of the whole concern.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But surely,&rdquo; I now broke in, seeing that the Man in the Corner
  threatened to put away his piece of string and to leave me without the usual
  epilogue to his interesting narrative, &ldquo;surely General Sir Arkwright
  Jones cannot be blamed for the scandal which undoubtedly has dimmed the fortunes
  of the Woodfordfe Institute!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Cannot be blamed?&rdquo; the Man in the Corner retorted sarcastically. &ldquo;Cannot
  be blamed for entering into a conspiracy with his secretary and his headmaster
  to defraud the Institute, and then to silence for ever the one voice that
  might have been raised in accusation against him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Sir Arkwright Jones?&rdquo; I exclaimed incredulously, for indeed
  the idea appeared to me preposterous then, as the General&rsquo;s name was
  almost a household word before the catastrophe. &ldquo;Impossible!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Impossible!&rdquo; he reiterated. &ldquo;Why? He murdered Janet Smith;
  of that you will be as convinced within the next few days as I am at this
  hour. That the three men were in collusion I have not the shadow of doubt.
  Marston only made love to Janet Smith in order to secure her silence, but
  in this he failed and the girl boldly accused him of roguery as soon as she
  found him out. It would be inconceivable to suppose that being the bright,
  intelligent girl that she admittedly was, she could remain for ever in ignorance
  of the defalcations in the books; she must and did tax her lover of irregularities,
  she must have and indeed did threaten to put the whole thing before the governors.
  So much for the lover&rsquo;s quarrel overheard by Mrs. Rumble. I believe
  that the fate of the poor girl was decided on then and there by two of the
  scoundrels; it only remained to consult with their other accomplice as to
  the means for carrying their hideous project through. Janet had announced
  her determination to go to Kurtmoor that selfsame evening, the only question
  was which of those three miscreants would meet her in the darkness and solitude
  of the &lsquo;Lovers&rsquo; Walk.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But in order at the outset to throw dust in the eyes of the public
  and the police and not appear to be in any way associated with one another,
  Marston and Gubbins made pretence of a violent quarrel which Peryer overheard;
  then Gubbins, in order to make sure that the poor girl would carry out her
  intention of going over to Kurtmoor that evening, went to her house with
  the supposed message from Marston, and incidentally secured thereby his own
  alibi. This made him safe. Marston in the meanwhile went to arrange matters
  with Arkwright Jones. His position was of course more difficult than that
  of Gubbins. If there was to be murder&#8213; and my belief is that the scoundrels
  had been resolved on murder for some time before&#8213; the first suspicion
  would inevitably fall on the secretary who had kept the books and who had
  had the handling of the money. The miscreants had some sort of vague plan
  in their heads: of this there can be no doubt; they were only procrastinating,
  hoping against hope that chance would continue to favour them. But now the
  hour had come, the danger was imminent; within the next four and twenty hours
  Janet Smith, being promised no redress on the part of the President, would
  place the whole matter before the governors. Unless she was effectually made
  to hold her tongue.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We can easily suppose that Marston would be clever enough to arrange
  to meet Arkwright Jones, without arousing suspicion. We do know that soon
  after he finally quarrelled with Janet Smith he walked over to Kurtmoor;
  the two witnesses who spoke with him stated that they met him whilst they
  themselves were walking to Broxmouth. It was then past eight o&rsquo;clock.
  Arkwright Jones had either dined at his hotel or not; we do not know, for
  it never struck the police to enquire at once how the popular General had
  spent his time on that fateful evening. You know what those sort of unconventional
  seaside places are: people spend most of their time out of doors, and there
  would be nothing strange, let alone suspicious, in any visitor going out
  for an hour after dinner, even if it rained.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then surely you can in your mind see those two scoundrels putting
  their villainous heads together, and, as suspicion of any foul play would
  of necessity at once fall on Marston, Jones decided to take the hideous onus
  on himself. He went to the Dog&rsquo;s Tooth Cliff to meet Janet Smith himself
  and borrowed Marston&rsquo;s stick to aid him in his abominable deed. He
  was clever enough, however, to throw it over the edge of the cliff some distance
  away from the scene of his crime. We do not know, of course, whether the
  poor girl recognised him, or whether he just fell on her in the dark; she
  gave only one scream before she fell. They were clever scoundrels we must
  admit, but chance favoured them too, especially in one thing: she favoured
  them when she prompted Arkwright Jones to put a muffler round his throat.
  This one fact as you know saved Marston&rsquo;s neck from the gallows; but
  for the strands of wool in the girl&rsquo;s hat pin and Hoggs&rsquo;s brief
  view of a man manipulating a muffler nothing but Jones&rsquo;s own confession
  could have saved his accomplice. Whether he would have confessed remains
  a riddle which no one will ever solve. But as to the whole so-called mystery,
  I saw daylight through it the moment I realised that Marston&rsquo;s despair
  and humiliation during the inquest was a pretence. If he feigned despair
  it was because he desired temporarily to be the victim of circumstantial
  evidence. From that point to the unravelling of the tangled skein was but
  a step for a mind bent on logic.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; I argued, for indeed I was bewildered and really incredulous, &ldquo;what
  will be the end of it all? Surely three scoundrels like that will not go
  scot free. There will be an inquiry into the affairs of the Institute: the
  governors&#8213;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The governors have talked of an inquiry,&rdquo; the funny creature
  broke in with a chuckle, &ldquo;but if you had any experience of these private
  charities you would know that the thing their administrators wish to avoid
  is publicity. The President of the Woodforde Institute had sufficient influence
  on the committee, you may be sure, to stifle any suggestion of creating public
  scandal by any sort of inquiry.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But the question of the finances of the Institute is anyhow public
  property now and&#8213;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And it will be allowed to sink into oblivion. The executive has resigned.
  Marston and Gubbins will leave the country, and everything will be conveniently
  hushed up.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But Arkwright Jones&#8213;&rdquo; I protested.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You see the papers regularly,&rdquo; he rejoined drily, &ldquo;watch
  them and you will see...&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I don&rsquo;t know when he went, but a moment or two later I found myself
  sitting alone at the table in the blameless tea shop. The matter interested
  me more than I cared to admit but, for once, I was not altogether prepared
  to accept the funny creature&rsquo;s deductions.</p>
  <p>Twenty-four hours later, however, I had to own that he had been right, when
  the following piece of sensational news appeared in the <i>Evening Post.</i></p>
  <p align="center" class="note">TRAGIC SEQUEL TO THE CLIFF MURDER.</p>
  <p class="note">An extraordinary sequel to the mysterious tragedy of
      the Dog&rsquo;s
   Tooth </p>
  <p class="note">Cliff, near Broxmouth, occurred last night, when on the
      self-same spot where Miss Janet Smith met her death three months ago, General
      Sir Arkwright Jones lost his footing and fell a distance of two hundred
      feet on to the rocks below. It was a beautiful moonlight evening, and the
      tide being low, a number of visitors were down on the beach at the time,
      but those who immediately hurried to the General&rsquo;s assistance found
      life already extinct. The distinguished soldier, who will be deeply mourned,
   must have been killed on the spot. </p>
  <p class="note">Indeed now general public opinion as well as every inhabitant
      of Broxmouth will bring pressure to bear upon the Borough Council to see
      that a suitable barrier is erected along the dangerous portions of the
      beautiful &lsquo;Lover&rsquo;s
   Walk.&rsquo; The double tragedy of this year&rsquo;s season renders such
   an erection imperative. </p>
  <p>I was probably the only reader of that paragraph who guessed that the once
  distinguished soldier had not come accidentally by his death. No doubt the
  police had followed up the clue of the man with the muffler and were actually
  on the track of the miscreant, when the latter, guessing that exposure was
  imminent, preferred to put an end to his own miserable life.</p>
  <p>I have since heard from friends at Broxmouth that Marston has gone to the
  Malay States, and that Gubbins is doing something in Germany. Curious creature
  Marston must have been! Imagine after Jones had returned from his infamous
  errand and told him that the hideous deed was done, imagine Marston walking
  back to Broxmouth along the &lsquo;Lover&rsquo;s Walk&rsquo; in the rain
  and the darkness, past the Dog&rsquo;s Tooth Cliff, at the foot of which
  the body of the murdered girl lay! I wonder what would be the views of the
  Man in the Corner on the psychology of a man with nerve enough for such an
  ordeal.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="TheTythertonCase"></a>The Tytherton Case</b> </h2>
  <h3 align="center"><b>1</b></h3>
  <p>&ldquo;What do you make of this?&rdquo; the Man in the Corner said to me
  that afternoon. &ldquo;A curious case is it not?&rdquo; And with his claw-like
  fingers he indicated the paragraph in the Evening Post which I had just been
  perusing with great interest.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;At best,&rdquo; I replied, &ldquo;it is a very unpleasant business
  for the Carysforts.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And at the worst?&rdquo; he retorted with a chuckle.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well...!&rdquo; I remarked drily.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do you think they are guilty?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see who else ...&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; he broke in, with his usual lack of manners, &ldquo;that
  is such a stale argument. One doesn&rsquo;t see who else, therefore one makes
  up one&rsquo;s mind that so and so must be guilty. I&rsquo;ll lay an even
  bet with anyone that out of a dozen cases of miscarriage of justice, I could
  point to ten that were directly due to that fallacious reasoning. We all
  admit that there is a motive underlying every crime, and my argument is that
  public and police alike are far too ready to presuppose a motive that is
  half the time of their own creation, and, having done that, they start working
  upon a flimsy foundation, waste a vast amount of time, and in the meanwhile
  give the real criminal every chance of escape. Now take as an example the
  Tytherton case, in which you are apparently interested. It was an unprecedented
  outrage which stirred the busy provincial town to its depths, the victim,
  Mr. Walter Stonebridge, being one of its most noted solicitors. He had his
  office in Tytherton High Street and lived in a small, detached house on the
  Great West Road. The house stood in the middle of a small garden, and had
  only one story above the ground floor; the front door opened straight on
  a long, narrow hall which ran along the full depth of the house. On the left
  side of this hall there were two doors, one leading to the drawing-room and
  the other to a small morning-room. At the end of the hall was the staircase,
  and beyond it, down a couple of steps, there was a tiny dining-room and the
  usual offices. The back door opened straight on the kitchen, and on the floor
  above there were four bedrooms and a bathroom. Mr. Walter Stonebridge was
  a bachelor and his domestic staff consisted of a married couple&#8213; Henning
  by name&#8213; who did all that was necessary for him in the house.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It was on the last evening of February. The weather was fair and
  bright. The Hennings had gone upstairs to their room as usual at ten o&rsquo;clock.
  Mr. Stonebridge was at the time, sitting in the morning-room. He was in the
  habit of sitting up late, reading and writing. On this occasion he told the
  Hennings to close the shutters and lock the back door as usual, but to leave
  the front door on the latch as he was expecting a visitor. The Hennings thought
  nothing of that, as one or two gentlemen-friends, or sometimes clients of
  Mr. Stonebridge, would now and then drop in late to see him. Anyway, they
  went contentedly to bed. A little while later&#8213; they could not exactly
  recollect at what hour because they had already settled down for the night&#8213; they
  heard the front door bell, and immediately afterwards Mr. Stonebridge&rsquo;s
  footsteps along the hall. Then suddenly they heard a crash followed by what
  sounded like a struggle, then a smothered cry, and finally silence. Henning
  was out of bed and on the landing in an instant and he had just switched
  on the light there when he heard Mr. Stonebridge&rsquo;s voice calling up
  to him from below:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;That&rsquo;s all right, Henning. I caught my foot in this
  confounded rug. That&rsquo;s all.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Henning looked over the bannister, and seeing nothing he shouted down:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Shall I give you a &lsquo;and, sir?&rsquo; But Mr. Stonebridge
  at once replied, quite cheerily: &lsquo;No, no! I&rsquo;m all right. You
  go back to bed.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And Henning did as he was told, nor did he or his wife hear anything
  more during the night. But in the early morning when Mrs. Henning came downstairs
  she was horror-struck to find Mr. Stonebridge in the dining-room, lying across
  the table to which he was securely pinioned with a rope; a serviette taken
  out of the sideboard drawer had been tied tightly round his mouth and his
  eyes were blindfolded with his own pocket handkerchief. The woman&rsquo;s
  screams brought her husband upon the scene; together they set to work to
  rescue their master from his horrible plight. At first they thought that
  he was dead, and Henning was for fetching the police immediately, but his
  wife declared that Mr. Stonebridge was just unconscious and she started to
  apply certain household restoratives and made Henning force some brandy through
  Mr. Stonebridge&rsquo;s lips. Presently the poor man opened his eyes and
  gave one or two other signs of returning consciousness, but he was still
  very queer and shaky. The Hennings then carried him upstairs, undressed him
  and put him to bed, and then Henning ran for the doctor.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, it was days, or in fact weeks, before Mr. Stonebridge had sufficiently
  recovered to give a coherent statement of what happened to him on that fateful
  night, and&#8213; which was just as much to the point&#8213; what had happened
  the previous day. The doctor had prescribed complete rest in the interim.
  The patient had suffered from concussion and I know not what, and those events
  had got so mixed up in his brain that to try and disentangle them was such
  an effort that every time he attempted it it nearly sent him into a brain
  fever. But in the meanwhile his friends had been busy&#8213; notably Mr.
  Stonebridge&rsquo;s head clerk, Mr. Medburn, who was giving the police no
  rest. There was, even without the evidence of the principal witness concerned,
  plenty of facts to go on to make out a case against the perpetrator of such
  a dastardly outrage. That robbery had been the main motive of the assault
  was easily enough established&#8213; a small fire and burglar proof safe
  which stood in a corner of the morning-room had been opened and ransacked.
  When examined it was found to contain only a few trinkets which had probably
  a sentimental value, but were otherwise worthless. The key of the safe&#8213; one
  of a bunch&#8213; was still in the lock, which went to prove either that
  Mr. Stonebridge had the safe open when he was attacked, or what was more
  likely&#8213; considering the solicitor&rsquo;s well-known careful habits&#8213; that
  the assailant had ransacked his victim&rsquo;s pockets after he had knocked
  him down. A pocket-book, torn, and containing only a few unimportant papers
  lay on the ground; there had been a fire in the room at the time of the outrage
  and careful analysis of the ashes found in the hearth revealed the presence
  of a quantity of burnt paper.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But robbery being established as the motive of the outrage did not
  greatly help matters, because while Mr. Stonebridge remained in such a helpless
  condition, it was impossible to ascertain what booty his assailant had carried
  away. Soon, however, the first ray of light was thrown upon what seemed until
  this hour an impenetrable mystery. It appears that Mr. Medburn was looking
  after the business in High Street during his employer&rsquo;s absence, and
  one morning&#8213; it was on the Monday following the night of the outrage&#8213; he
  had a visit from a client who sent in his name as Felix Shap. The head clerk
  knew something about this client who had recently come over to England from
  somewhere abroad in order to make good his claim to certain royalties on
  what is known as the Shap Fuelettes&#8213; a kind of cheap fuel which was
  launched some time before the war by Sir Alfred Carysfort, Bart., of Tytherton
  Grange, and out of which that gentleman made an immense fortune, and, incidentally,
  got his title thereby.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;This man Shap&#8213; a Dutchman by birth&#8213; was, it appears the
  original inventor and patentee of these Fuelettes, and Mr. Carysfort, as
  he was then, had met him out in the Dutch East Indies and had bought the
  invention from him for a certain sum down, and then exploited it in England
  first and afterwards all over the world at immense profit. Sir Alfred Carysfort
  died about a year ago, leaving a fortune of over a million sterling, and
  was succeeded in the title and in the managing directorship of the business
  by his eldest son David, a married man with a large family. The business
  had long since been turned into a private limited liability company, the
  bulk of the shares being held by the managing director.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The fact that the patent rights of the Shap Fuelettes had been sold
  by the inventor to the late Alfred Carysfort had, never been in dispute.
  It further appeared that Felix Shap had at one time been a very promising
  mining engineer, but that in consequence of incurable, intemperate habits
  he had gradually drifted down the social scale; he lost one good appointment
  after another until he was just an underpaid clerk in the office of an engineer
  in Batavia, whose representative in England was Mr. Alfred Carysfort. The
  latter was on a visit to the head office in Batavia some twelve years ago
  when he met Shap, who was then on his beam-ends. He had recently been sacked
  by his employers for intemperance and was on the fair way of becoming one
  of those hopeless human derelicts who usually end their days either on the
  gallows or in a convict prison.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But at the back of Shap&rsquo;s fuddled mind there had lingered throughout
  his downward career the remembrance of a certain invention which he had once
  patented and which he had always declared would one day bring him an immense
  fortune; but though he had spent quite a good deal of money in keeping up
  his patent rights, he had never had the pluck and perseverance to exploit
  or even to perfect his invention. Alfred Carysfort, on the other hand, was
  brilliantly clever, he was ambitious, probably none too scrupulous, and at
  once he saw the immense possibilities, if properly worked, of Shap&rsquo;s
  rough invention, and he set to work to obtain the man&rsquo;s confidence,
  and, presumably, by exercising certain persuasion and pressure he got the
  wastrel to make over to him in exchange for a few hundred pounds the entire
  patent rights in the Fuelettes. The transaction was, as far as that goes,
  perfectly straightforward and above board; it was embodied in a contract
  drawn up by an English solicitor, who was the British Consul in Batavia at
  the time; nor was it&#8213; taking everything into consideration&#8213; an
  unfair one. Shap would never have done anything with his invention, and a
  clean, wholesome and entirely practical fuel would probably have been thus
  lost to the world; but there remains the fact that Alfred Carysfort died
  a dozen years later worth more than a million sterling, every penny of which
  he had made out of an invention for which he had originally paid less than
  five hundred.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mr. Medburn had been put in possession of these facts some weeks
  previously when Mr. Felix Shap had first presented himself at the private
  house of Mr. Stonebridge; he came armed with a letter of introduction from
  a relative of Mr. Stonebridge&rsquo;s whom he had met out in Java, and he
  was accompanied by a friend&#8213; an American named Julian Lloyd&#8213; who
  was piloting him about the place, and acting as his interpreter and secretary,
  as he himself had never been in England and spoke English very indifferently.
  His passport and papers of identification were perfectly in order; he appeared
  before Mr. Stonebridge as a man still on the right side of sixty who certainly
  bore traces on his prematurely wrinkled face and in his tired lustreless
  eyes of a life spent in dissipation rather than in work, but otherwise he
  bore himself well, was well dressed and apparently plentifully supplied with
  money.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The story that he told Mr. Stonebridge through the intermediary of
  his friend, Julian Lloyd, was a very curious one. According to his version
  of various transactions which took place between himself and the late Sir
  Alfred Carysfort, the latter had, some time after the signing of the original
  contract, made him a definite promise in writing that should the proceeds
  in the business of the Shap Fuelettes exceed &pound;10,000 in any one year,
  he, Sir Alfred, would pay the original inventor out of his own pocket a sum
  equivalent to twenty per cent of all such profits over and above the &pound;10,000,
  with a minimum of &pound;200. Mr. Shap had brought over with him all the
  correspondence relating to this promise, and, moreover, he adduced as proof
  positive that Sir Alfred had looked on that promise as binding, and had at
  first loyally abided by it, the fact that until 1916 he had paid to Mr. Felix
  Shap the sum of &pound;200 every year. These sums had been paid half-yearly
  through Sir Alfred&rsquo;s bankers, and acknowledgments were duly sent by
  Shap direct to the bank, all of which could of course be easily verified.
  But in the year 1916 these payments suddenly ceased. Mr. Shap wrote repeatedly
  to Sir Alfred, but never received any reply. At first he thought that there
  were certain difficulties in the way owing to the European War, so after
  a while he ceased writing. But presently there came the Armistice; Mr. Shap
  wrote again and again, but was again met by the same obstinate silence.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In the meanwhile he had come to the end of his resources; he had
  spent all that he had ever saved, but nevertheless he was determined that
  as soon as he could scrape up a sufficiency of money he would go to England
  in order to establish his rights. Then in 1922 he heard of Sir Alfred Carysfort&rsquo;s
  death. It was now or never if he did not mean to acquiesce silently in the
  terrible wrong which was being put upon him. Fortunately he had a good friend
  in Mr. Julian Lloyd, who had helped him with money and advice, and at last
  he had arrived in England. It was for Mr. Stonebridge to say whether the
  papers and correspondence which he had brought with him were sufficient to
  establish his claim in law. Mr. Medburn remembered Mr. Stonebridge telling
  him all about these matters and emphasising the fact that Felix Shap had
  undoubtedly a very strong case and that he could not understand a man in
  the position of Sir Alfred Carysfort thus wilfully repudiating his own signature.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;There is not only the original letter,&rsquo; Mr. Stonebridge
  had concluded, &lsquo;making a definite promise to pay certain sums out of
  his own pocket if the profits of the company exceeded &pound;10,000 in any
  one year, but there are all the covering letters from Sir Alfred&rsquo;s bankers
  whenever they sent cheques on his behalf to Shap&#8213; usually twice a year
  for sums that varied between &pound;100 and &pound;150. I cannot understand
  it!&rsquo; he
  had reiterated more than once, and Mr. Medburn, who also had a great deal
  of respect for the Carysforts, who were among the wealthiest people in the
  county, was equally at a loss to understand the position.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;However Mr. Stonebridge, after he had seen the late Sir Alfred&rsquo;s
  bankers about the payments to Shap and consulted an expert on the subject
  of the all-important letter signed by the late Alfred Carysfort, sought an
  interview with Sir David. From the first there seemed to be an extraordinary
  amount of acrimony brought into the dispute by both sides; this was understandable
  enough on the part of Felix Shap, who felt he was being defrauded of his
  just dues by men who were literally coining money out of the product of his
  brain; but the greatest bitterness really appeared to come from the other
  side.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;At first Sir David Carysfort refused even to discuss the question;
  he was quite sure that if his father had made promises of payments to anyone,
  he was the last man in the world to repudiate such obligations. Sir David
  had not yet had time to go through all his father&rsquo;s papers, but he
  was quite convinced that correspondence, or documents, would presently be
  found, which would set at nought the original letter produced by Mr. Shap.
  But, of course, the payments to Shap up to and including the year 1916 could
  not be denied; there was the testimony of Sir Alfred&rsquo;s bankers that
  sums in accordance with Sir Alfred&rsquo;s instructions, varying between &pound;100
  and &pound;150, were paid by cheque every half-year to the order of Felix
  Shap in Batavia. In 1916 these payments automatically ceased, Sir Alfred
  giving no further orders for these to be made. Mr. Stonebridge naturally
  desired to know what explanation Sir David would give about those payments.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;At first Sir David denied all knowledge as to the reason or object
  of the payments, but after a while he must have realised that public opinion
  was beginning to raise its voice on the subject, and that it was not exactly
  singing the praises of Sir David Carysfort, Bart. Although Mr. Stonebridge
  had, of course, been discretion itself, Mr. Shap had admittedly not the same
  incentive to silence, and what&rsquo;s more his friend, Mr. Lloyd, made it
  his business to get as much publicity for the whole affair as he could. Paragraphs
  in the local papers had begun to appear with unabated regularity, and though
  there were no actual comments on the case as a whole, no prejudging of respective
  merits, there were unmistakable hints that it would be in Sir David&rsquo;s
  interest to put dignity on one side and come out frankly into the open with
  explanations and suggestions. Soon the London papers got hold of the story,
  and you know what that means. The Radical Press simply battened on a story
  which placed a poor, down-at-heel inventor in the light of a victim to the
  insatiable greed and frank dishonesty of a high-born profiteer.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Whether it was pressure from outside, or from his own family, that
  suddenly induced Sir David to &lsquo;come out into the open&rsquo; is not
  generally known; certain it is that presently he condescended to give an
  explanation of the mysterious half-yearly payments made by his father to
  Felix Shap, and the explanation was so romantic and frankly so far-fetched
  that most people, especially men, refused to accept it&#8213; notably Mr.
  Stonebridge. It was not the business of a lawyer to listen to sentimental
  stories, least of all was it the business of the lawyer acting on the other
  side. The story told by Sir David, namely, was this:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The late Sir Alfred, when quite a young man, had gone out as clerk
  to that same engineering firm in Batavia whom he represented later on; it
  was then that he first met Felix Shap, who had not yet begun to go downhill.
  An intimacy sprang up between Alfred Carysfort and Shap&rsquo;s sister, Berta,
  and the two were secretly married in Batavia. A year later Berta had a son
  whose birth she only survived by a few hours. The marriage had been an unhappy
  one from the first, and Carysfort was only too thankful when his firm called
  him back to England and he was able to shake off the dust of Batavia from
  his feet, as he hoped for ever. He never spoke of his marriage, nor did he
  ever recognise or have anything to do with his son. By some pecuniary arrangement
  entered into with Felix Shap the latter undertook to provide for and look
  after the boy, to give him his own name, and never to trouble his brother-in-law
  about him again. A deed-poll was, Sir David believed, duly executed, and
  the boy assumed the name of Alfred Shap.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Some years later there occurred the transaction over the Shap Fuelettes.
  Alfred Carysfort had come to Batavia on business: he had met Felix Shap again
  who by this time had become a hopeless wastrel. The contract for the sale
  of the patent rights in the Fuelettes was duly executed, but whether, after
  seeing his son once more, the call of the blood became more insistent in
  the heart of Alfred Carysfort or whether he merely yielded to blackmail,
  Sir David could not say; certain it is that after a while when the profits
  of the Shap Fuelettes Company became substantial Sir Alfred took to sending
  over a couple of hundred pounds every year to Shap for the benefit of young
  Alfred. Then the war broke out; young Alfred joined the Australian Expeditionary
  Force and was killed in Gallipoli in August, 1915. As soon as Sir Alfred
  had definite news of the boy&rsquo;s death, he naturally stopped all further
  payments to Shap.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The story as you see sounded plausible enough, and if it proved to
  be untrue, it would reflect great credit on Sir David&rsquo;s gift of imagination.
  Felix Shap, as was only to be expected, denied it from beginning to end;
  the whole thing, he declared, was an impudent falsehood, based on a semblance
  of truth. It was quite true that he had adopted and for years had cared for
  his sister&rsquo;s son, who was subsequently killed in Gallipoli; it was
  also true that Alfred Carysfort had years ago paid some attention to his
  sister Berta, but there never was any question of marriage between them,
  young Carysfort deeming himself far too grand and well-born to marry the
  daughter of an obscure East Indian trader. Berta had subsequently married
  a man of mixed blood who deserted her and went off somewhere&#8213; Argentina
  or Honduras&#8213; Shap did not know where; at any rate he was never heard
  of again.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In proof of his version of the romantic story, Felix Shap actually
  had a copy of his sister&rsquo;s marriage certificate, as well as one or
  two letters written at different times to his sister Berta by her rascally
  husband. He had, indeed, plenty of proofs for his assertions; but when Mr.
  Stonebridge asked for confirmation of Sir David&rsquo;s story, the latter
  appeared either unprepared or unwilling to produce any, whereupon Mr. Stonebridge,
  on behalf of his client, entered an action for the recovery of certain royalties
  due to him on the sales of the Shap Fuelettes, the amount to be presently
  agreed on after examination of the audited accounts.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Thus matters stood when on that Wednesday night in February last
  Mr. Stonebridge was found gagged and unconscious, the victim of a murderous
  and inexplicable assault. And on the Saturday following Mr. Felix Shap, accompanied
  by his friend, Mr. Lloyd, called on Mr. Medburn at the office in High Street.
  They had read in the papers certain details which had filled Shap with apprehension;
  they had read that the safe in the morning-room in Mr. Stonebridge&rsquo;s
  house had been obviously ransacked, and that the analysis of the ashes in
  the grate had revealed the presence of a large quantity of burnt paper.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;My friend Mr. Shap would like you to put his mind at rest
    Mr.&#8213; er&#8213; Medburn,&rsquo; Mr.
  Lloyd said in an anxious, agitated tone of voice, &lsquo;that the papers
  relating to this case, which I entrusted to Mr. Stonebridge, are safely locked
  up in a safe at this office.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Unfortunately the head clerk was not able to satisfy Mr. Shap on
  that point. Mr. Stonebridge had never brought the papers to the office, nor
  had Mr. Medburn ever seen them. His impression was&#8213; he regretted to
  say&#8213; that Mr. Stonebridge had, for the time being, kept all papers
  relating to this particular case at his private house, just as he had always
  seen Mr. Shap there rather than at the office. Of course, Medburn hastened
  to assure his visitor, Mr. Stonebridge may have kept the documents in some
  other secure place; Mr. Medburn couldn&rsquo;t say, not having access to
  all his employer&rsquo;s papers, and in any case he would make a comprehensive
  search for the missing documents, and if nothing was found he would at once
  inform the police.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;An evening or two later the papers came out with flaring headlines: &lsquo;Amazing
  developments in the Tytherton outrage. Missing documents. Sensational turn
  in the Shap Fuelettes case.&rsquo; And so on. The head clerk had made an
  exhaustive search amongst his employer&rsquo;s papers, but not a trace could
  he find of any documents relative to Mr. Snap&rsquo;s case. One and all had
  disappeared: the original letter from Alfred Carysfort promising to pay an
  extra twenty per cent on the profits of the Shap Fuelette Company under certain
  conditions, the letters from the scoundrel who had been Berta&rsquo;s husband
  together with the copy of Berta&rsquo;s marriage certificate&#8213; everything
  was gone, every proof of the truth of the story which Felix Shap had come
  all this way to tell.</p>
  <h3 align="center"><b>2</b></h3>
  <p>&ldquo;The next exciting incident,&rdquo; the Man in the Corner continued
  glibly, &ldquo;in this remarkably mysterious case, was the news that Mr.
  Allan Carysfort, eldest son of Sir David Carysfort, Bart., had been detained
  in connection with the assault upon Mr. Stonebridge and the disappearance
  of certain papers, the property of Mr. Felix Shap of Batavia.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Young Allan Carysfort, who was a subaltern in a cavalry regiment,
  had come home from India recently, and, as a matter of fact, he had arrived
  at the Grange, the family seat just outside Tytherton, the very evening of
  the outrage. Acting upon, certain information received the police had detained
  him. He was to be brought before the magistrates on the following day and
  in the meanwhile it was generally understood that some highly sensational
  evidence had been collected by the police.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It has been asserted that Sir David Carysfort and his family were
  the last to realise how very strong public opinion had been against them
  ever since Shap&rsquo;s story and the loss of the documents had become generally
  known. Though there had been no hint of it in the Press, the public loudly
  declared that the Carysforts must have had something to do with the outrage,
  seek him whom the crime benefits being a most excellent adage. But imagine
  the sensation when Allan Carysfort, the eldest son of Sir David Carysfort,
  Bart., was arrested! Need I say that the following day when the young man
  was, brought before the magistrates the court was crowded. David was a magistrate,
  too, but of course he did not sit that day. To see his eldest son arraigned
  before his brother Beaks must have been a bitter pill for his pride to swallow.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We had the usual formal evidence of arrest, the medical evidence,
  and so on, after which we quickly plunged into exciting business. Mr Stonebridge
  we were soon told had made a statement. He was not yet strong enough to appear
  in person but he had made a statement, so at last the public was to be initiated
  into the mysteries that surrounded the inexplicable assault.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;After my servants had gone to bed,&rsquo; Mr. Stonebridge
  had stated, &lsquo;I sat awhile reading in the morning-room. I was expecting
  the visit of Mr. Shap, as we had talked over the possibility of a quiet chat
  at my house that evening on the subject of his affairs. He and Mr. Lloyd,
  who were both of them very fond of the cinema, were in the habit of dropping
  in after the show, on their way home. At about a quarter to eleven&#8213; I
  am sure it was not later&#8213; there was a ring at the front door bell,
  and I went to open the door. No sooner had I done this than a shawl or muffler
  of some sort was thrown over my face, and I was made to lose my balance by
  the thrust of a foot between my two shins. I came down backwards with a crash.
  The whole thing occurred in fewer seconds that it takes to describe; the
  next moment I had the sensation of cold steel against my temple, I heard
  an ominous click, and a husky voice whispered in my ear, &ldquo;Your servant
  is coming out of his room. Speak to him, tell him you are all right, or I
  shoot.&rdquo; What could I do? I was utterly helpless and a revolver was
  held to my temple. The muffler was then lifted from my mouth, I could feel
  the man bending over me, I could feel his hot breath on my forehead, and
  a few seconds later I heard Henning come out of his room upstairs and switch
  on the light on the top landing. &ldquo;If he comes downstairs,&rdquo; the
  voice whispered close to my ear, &ldquo;I shoot.&rdquo; Then it was,&rsquo; Mr.
  Stonebridge went on to say, &lsquo;that I shouted up to Henning that I had
  only tripped over a rug, and that I was quite all right. I don&rsquo;t think
  I ever looked death so very near in the face before. The next moment I heard
  Henning switch off the light upstairs and go back to his room. After that
  I remember nothing more. I only have a vague recollection of a sudden terrible
  pain in my head; everything else is a blank until I found myself in bed,
  and with vague stirrings of memory bringing a return of that same appalling
  headache.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The great point about Mr. Stonebridge&rsquo;s evidence was that he
  was utterly unable to identify his assailant. He was not even sure whether
  he had been attacked by two men or one, since he had been blindfolded at
  the outset, and all that he heard was a husky voice that spoke in a whisper.
  He was ready to admit that he may have left the safe unlocked when he went
  to answer the front door bell, and he certainly had the papers relating to
  Mr. Shap&rsquo;s case on his desk as he had been going through them earlier
  in the evening. Those papers, therefore, had undoubtedly been burned in the
  grate, and it was obvious that the theft and destruction of those papers
  was the motive of the assault.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;After that we went from excitement to excitement. We did not get
  it all the same day of course; Allan Carysfort appeared, as far as I can
  remember, three or four times before the local magistrates; in between times
  he was out on bail, this having been fixed at &pound;1,000 in two recognisances
  of &pound;500 each, with an additional &pound;500 on his own. It seems that
  when he was arrested he had made a statement, to which he had since unreservedly
  subscribed. He said that he had arrived in London from Southampton on Monday
  the 26th, and after seeing to some business in town, he took the 8.10 pm
  train on the 28th to Tytherton, where he arrived at 9.50, having dined on
  board. His father met him at the station with the car, but it was such a
  beautiful moonlit night Sir David and himself decided that they would walk
  to the Grange and then sent the car home with a message to Lady Carysfort
  that they would be home at about eleven o&rsquo;clock.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Carysfort had been asked whether it was not strange that after being
  absent from home so long, he should have elected to put off seeing his mother
  till a much later hour.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Not at all,&rsquo; he replied. &lsquo;Sir David wished to
  put me <i>au fait</i> of certain family matters before I actually saw Lady
  Carysfort. These matters,&rsquo; he added emphatically in reply to questions
  put to him by the magistrate, &lsquo;had nothing whatever to do with financial
  business, least of all were they in any relation to Mr. Shap and his affairs.
  Sir David and I,&rsquo; he went on calmly, &lsquo;walked about for a while
  and then Sir David remembered that he wished to see a friend at the County
  Club. He went in there, but I preferred to take another turn out of doors,
  as I had not had a taste of English country air for nearly two years.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Asked how long he had walked about Tytherton waiting for Sir David,
  Carysfort thought about half an hour, and when questioned as to the direction
  he had taken, he said he really couldn&rsquo;t remember. The police of course
  had adduced certain witnesses whose testimony would justify the course they
  had taken in arresting a gentleman in the position of Mr. Alan Carysfort.
  There was, first of all, Felix Shap himself and his friend Julian Lloyd.
  They deposed that at about half-past ten, or perhaps a little earlier, they
  were on their way to see Mr. Stonebridge, as the latter had expressed a wish
  to see them both and have another quiet talk over a cigar and a glass of
  wine; Shap and Lloyd had been to the P.P.P cinema in High Street, and they
  left just before the end to go to Mr. Stonebridge&rsquo;s house. They were
  within fifty yards of it when they saw a man turn out of the nearest side
  street and go up to Mr. Stonebridge&rsquo;s house. The man went through the
  garden gate and up to the front door. Shap and Lloyd saw him in the act of
  ringing the bell. It was then somewhere between 10.30 and 10.45. Mr. Stonebridge
  was so very much in the habit of seeing friends, and even those clients with
  whom he was intimate, late in the evenings, that Mr. Shap and Mr. Lloyd didn&rsquo;t
  think anything of the incident; but, at the same time, they made up their
  minds to postpone their own visit to Mr. Stonebridge until they could be
  quite sure of seeing him alone. So they turned then and there and went straight
  back to the Black Swan where they lodged.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I may add that with commendable reserve both these witnesses refused
  to identify Allan Carysfort with Mr. Stonebridge&rsquo;s visitor on that
  memorable Wednesday evening. The man they saw had an overcoat and wore a
  Glengarry cap. More they could not say, as they had not seen his face clearly.
  On the other hand the hall-porter at the County Club, another witness for
  the Treasury, had no cause for such reserve. He said that on the evening
  of February 28th Sir David Carysfort came to the Club a little before half-past
  ten. Mr. Allan was with him then, but he didn&rsquo;t come in. The hall-porter
  heard him say to Sir David: &lsquo;Very well then! I&rsquo;ll pick you up
  here in about half an hour!&rsquo; And Sir David rejoined: &lsquo;Yes; don&rsquo;t
  be late!&rsquo; Mr. Allan did return to the Club at about eleven o&rsquo;clock
  and the two gentlemen then went off together. The hall-porter remembered
  the incident on that date quite distinctly, because he recollected being
  much surprised at seeing Mr. Allan Carysfort, who he thought was still abroad.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;After that there was another remand, Allan Carysfort&rsquo;s solicitor
  having asked and obtained an adjournment for a week. But by this time, as
  you may imagine, not only the county, but London society too were absolutely
  horror-struck. To think that a man in the position of the Carysforts should
  have stooped to such an act, not only of violence, but of improbity, was
  indeed staggering. Nor did public opinion swerve from this attitude one hair&rsquo;s
  breadth, even though at the next hearing all the proofs which the police
  had adduced against the accused were absolutely confuted. Fortunately for
  Carysfort, his solicitors had been successful in finding two witnesses, Miriam
  Page and Arthur Ormeley, who had seen Mr. Allan Carysfort, whom they knew
  by sight, strolling by the river at a quarter to eleven. They&#8213; like
  the hall-porter at the County Club&#8213; remembered the circumstance very
  clearly because they did not know that Mr. Allan was home from abroad, and
  were astonished to see him there.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The point of the evidence of three witnesses was that the river where
  they had seen Allan Carysfort strolling at a quarter to eleven is at the
  diametrically opposite end of the town to that where lies the Great West
  Road. Now the hall-porter had seen Allan Carysfort outside the County Club
  at half-past ten and again at eleven. If Carysfort was strolling by the river
  at a quarter to eleven, and there was no reason to impugn the credibility
  of the witnesses, he could not possibly have been the man whom Mr. Snap and
  Mr. Lloyd saw ringing the bell of Mr. Stonebridge&rsquo;s house at about
  that same hour.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Allan Carysfort was discharged by the magistrates as you know. There
  was no definite proof against him. But public opinion is ever an uncertain
  quantity, and it is still dead against the Carysforts. In the public mind
  two facts have remained indelibly fixed: firstly, that the Carysforts had
  everything to gain by the destruction of Felix Shap&rsquo;s papers, and,
  secondly, that there was nobody else who could possibly have benefited by
  it. Since then also Mr. Stonebridge has made a declaration that nothing was
  stolen out of his safe and pocket-book except the papers and letters belonging
  to Felix Shap. So what would you? Although Allan Carysfort was discharged
  by the magistrates, really because there was no tangible evidence against
  him, he did not leave the court without a stain on his character. The stain
  was there, and there it is to this day. It will take the Carysforts years
  to live the scandal down; though some friends have remained loyal, there
  are always the enemies, the envious, the uncharitable, and they insist that
  the two witnesses&#8213; the only two, mind you, whose evidence did clear
  Allan Carysfort of suspicion&#8213; had been bought and should not be believed,
  while others simply declare that Sir David and his son employed some ruffian
  to do the dirty work for them.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He gave a dry cackle and contemplated me through his huge horn-rimmed spectacles.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And you are of that opinion, too, I imagine,&rdquo; he said.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, it seems the only likely explanation,&rdquo; I replied guardedly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Surely you don&rsquo;t suppose,&rdquo; he retorted, &ldquo;that a
  business man like David Carysfort would place himself so entirely in the
  hands of a ruffian that he would for ever after be the victim of blackmail!
  Why, it would have been cheaper to buy off Felix Shap!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; I rejoined, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see who else had any
  interest in doing away with those documents.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you,&rdquo; he rejoined dryly. &ldquo;Felix Shap
  himself.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; I queried, with as much lofty scorn as I
  could command.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I mean,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;that all Felix Shap&rsquo;s documents
  were forgeries.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Forgeries?&rdquo; I exclaimed.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, spurious! False affidavits! Forgeries the lot of &rsquo;em.
  My belief is that Stonebridge began to suspect this himself, and I think
  he has had a narrow escape of being murdered outright by those two rascals.
  As it is they have destroyed every proof of their villainy, and old Stonebridge,
  I imagine, is content to let things remain as they are rather than admit
  publicly that he was completely taken in by two very plausible rogues.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; I urged, &ldquo;what about the handwriting expert?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The funny creature laughed aloud.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes!&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;what about the expert? If there had been
  two they would have disagreed. And mind you at a distance of twelve years
  a signature would be difficult of absolute identification. Everyone&rsquo;s
  handwriting undergoes certain modifications in the course of years. Experts,&rdquo; he
  reiterated, &ldquo;Bah!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; I went on impatiently, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see the object
  of the whole scheme.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The object was blackmail,&rdquo; the whimsical creature retorted, &ldquo;and
  it succeeded admirably. Already we read that Messrs. Shap and Lloyd are staying
  at expensive hotels in London, that they have granted interviews to pressmen
  and written articles for halfpenny newspapers. We shall hear of them as cinema
  stars presently. They have had the most gorgeous, the most paying publicity,
  and presently Sir David Carysfort will have had enough of them and will put
  a few more hundreds in their pockets just to be rid of them. That was the
  object of the whole scheme, my dear young lady! And see how well it was carried
  out. Of course the addle-headed Dutchman never thought of it. I imagine that
  the whole scheme originated in the fertile brain of Mr. Julian Lloyd, and
  it was thoroughly well thought out from the manufacture of the documents
  and letters down to the assault on the silly old country attorney. And, mind
  you, the rascals originally went to a silly country attorney; they would
  have been afraid to go to a London lawyer lest he be too sharp for them.
  The only mistake they made were the letters purported to be written to Berta
  Shap by the husband who is supposed to have disappeared, and the copy of
  Berta&rsquo;s marriage certificate. It is those letters that gave me the
  clue to the whole thing; old Stonebridge was too dull to have seen through
  those letters. If they were genuine why should Felix Shap have brought them
  over to England? They had nothing whatever to do with any contract about
  the Shap Fuelettes. If they were genuine, how could he guess that he would
  have to disprove a story of a secret marriage and of young Alfred being the
  son of Sir Alfred Carysfort? By wanting to prove too much, he, to my mind,
  gave himself away, and one can but marvel that neither lawyers nor police
  saw through the roguery. Of course the moment one understands that one set
  of papers was spurious, it is easily concluded that all the others were forgeries.
  And the late Sir Alfred Carysfort, anxious only to obliterate every vestige
  of that early marriage of his, unwittingly played into the hands of those
  two scoundrels by destroying all the correspondence that he had ever had
  with Shap.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Think it all over, you will see that I am right. Look at this paragraph
  again in the <i>Evening Post</i>, does it not bear out what I say?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The paragraph in the evening paper to which the Man in the Corner was pointing
  read as follows:</p>
  <p class="note">&ldquo;Among the passengers on the Dutch liner <i>Stadt Rotterdam</i> is
   Mr. Felix Shap, the hero of a recent celebrated case. He is returning to
   Batavia, having, through a misadventure which has remained an impenetrable
   mystery to this day, been deprived of all the proofs that would have established
   his claim to a substantial share of the profits in the Shap Fuelettes Company.
   Fortunately Mr. Shap had enlisted many sympathies in England that his friends
   had no difficulty in collecting a considerable sum of money which was presented
   to him on his departure in the form of a purse and as a compensation for
   the ill-luck which has attended him since he set foot in this country.
   Mr. Shap will now be able to take abroad with him the assurance that British
   public opinion is always on the side of the victims of an adverse and unmerited
   fate.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes!&rdquo; the funny creature concluded with a cackle, &ldquo;until
  the victims are found out to be rogues. Mr. Felix Shap and his friend, Mr.
  Julian Lloyd, will be found out some day.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The next moment he had gone with that rapidity which was so characteristic
  of him, and I might have thought that he was just a spook who had come to
  visit me whilst I dozed over my cup of tea, only that on the table by the
  side of an empty glass was a piece of string adorned with a series of complicated
  knots.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="TheMysteryOfBrudenellCourt"></a>The Mystery Of Brudenell Court</b> </h2>
  <h3 align="center"><b>1</b></h3>
  <p>&ldquo;Did you ever make up your mind about that Brudenell Court affair,&rdquo; the
  Man in the Corner said to me that day.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; I replied. &ldquo;As far as I am concerned the death of
  Colonel Forburg has remained a complete mystery.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t think,&rdquo; he insisted &ldquo;that Morley Thrall
  was guilty?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what to think.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then don&rsquo;t do it,&rdquo; he rejoined with a chuckle, &ldquo;if
  you don&rsquo;t know what to think, then it&rsquo;s best not to think at
  all. At any rate wait until I have told you exactly what did happen&#8213; not
  as it was reported in the newspapers, but in the sequence in which the various
  incidents occurred.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;On Christmas Eve, last year, while the family were at dinner, there
  was a sudden commotion and cries of &lsquo;Stop thief!&rsquo; issuing from
  the back premises of Brudenell Court, the country seat of a certain Colonel
  Forburg. The butler ran in excitedly to say that Julia Mason, one of the
  maids, was drawing down the blinds in one of the first-floor rooms when she
  saw a man fiddling with the shutters of the French window in the smoking-room
  downstairs. She at once gave the alarm, whereupon the man bolted across the
  garden in the direction of the five-acre field. The Colonel and his stepson,
  as well as two male guests who were dining with them, immediately jumped
  up and hurried out to help in the chase. It was a very dark night, people
  were running to and fro, and for a few moments there was a great deal of
  noise and confusion, through which two pistol shots in close succession were
  distinctly heard.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The ladies&#8213; amongst whom was Miss Monica Glenluce, the Colonel&rsquo;s
  stepdaughter&#8213; had remained in the dining-room, and the dinner was kept
  waiting, pending the return of the gentlemen. They straggled in one by one,
  all except the Colonel. The ladies eagerly asked for news; the gentlemen
  could not say much&#8213; the night was very dark and they had just waited
  about outside until some of the indoor men who had given chase came back
  with the news that the thief had been caught. This news was confirmed by
  young Glenluce, Miss Monica&rsquo;s brother, who was the last to return.
  He had actually witnessed the capture. The thief had bolted straight across
  the five-acre meadow, but doubled back before he reached the stables, turned
  sharply to the right through the kitchen garden and then jumped over the
  boundary wall of the ground into the lane beyond, where he fell straight
  into the arms of the local constable who happened to be passing by. Young
  Glenluce had great fun out of the chase; he had guessed the man&rsquo;s purpose
  and instead of running after him across the meadow, he had gone round it,
  and had reached the boundary wall only a few seconds after the thief had
  scaled it. The was some talk about the gun shots that had been heard and
  everyone supposed that Colonel Forburg, who was a violent tempered man, had
  snatched up a revolver before giving chase to the burglar and had taken a
  pot-shot at him; it was fortunate that he had missed him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The incident would then have been closed and the interrupted dinner
  proceeded with, but for the fact that the host had not yet returned. Nothing
  was thought of this at first, for it was generally supposed that the Colonel
  had been kept talking by one of his men, or perhaps by the constable who
  had effected the capture; it was only when close on half an hour had gone
  by that Miss Monica became impatient. She got the butler to telephone both
  to the stables and to the lodge, but the Colonel had not been seen at either
  place, either during or after the incident with the burglar; communication
  with the police station brought the same result; nothing had been seen or
  heard of the Colonel. Genuinely alarmed now, Monica gave orders for the grounds
  to be searched; it was just possible that the Colonel had fallen whilst running,
  and was lying somewhere, helpless in the dark, perhaps unconscious... Everyone
  began recalling those pistol shots and a sense of tragedy spread over the
  entire house. Monica blamed herself for not having thought of all this before.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A search party went out at once; for awhile stable-lanterns and electric
  torches gleamed through the darkness and past the shrubberies. Then suddenly
  there were calls for help, the wandering lights centred in one spot, somewhere
  in the middle of the five-acre meadow near the big elm tree. Obviously there
  had been an accident. Monica ran to the front door, followed by all the guests.
  Through the darkness a group of men were seen slowly wending their way toward
  the house: one man was running ahead, it was the chauffeur. Young Glenluce,
  half-guessing that something sinister had occurred, went forward to meet
  him. What had happened was indeed as tragic as it was mysterious; the search
  party had found the Colonel lying full-length in the meadow. His clothes
  were saturated with blood, he had been shot in the breast and was apparently
  dead. Close by a revolver had been picked up. It was impossible to keep the
  terrible news from Miss Monica. Her brother broke the news to her. She bore
  up with marvellous calm, and it was she who at once gave the necessary orders
  to have her stepfather&rsquo;s body taken upstairs and to fetch both the
  doctor and the police.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In the meanwhile the guests had gone back into the house. They stood
  about in groups, awestruck and whispering. They did not care to finish their
  dinner, or to go up to their rooms, as in all probability they would be required
  when the police came to make enquiries. Monica and Gerald Glenluce had gone
  to sit in the smoking-room.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It was the most horrible Christmas Eve any one in that house had
  ever experienced.&rdquo;</p>
  <h3 align="center"><b>2</b></h3>
  <p>&ldquo;Murder committed from any other motive than that of robbery.&rdquo; the
  Man in the Corner went on after a moment&rsquo;s pause, &ldquo;always excites
  the interest of the public. There is nearly always an element of mystery
  about it, and it invariably suggests possibilities of romance. In this case,
  of course, there was no question of robbery. After Colonel Forburg fell,
  shot, as it transpired at close range and full in the breast, his clothes
  were left untouched; there was loose silver in his trouser pocket, a few
  treasury notes in his letter-case, and he was wearing a gold watch and chain
  and a fine pearl stud. The motive of the crime was therefore enmity or revenge,
  and, here the police were at once confronted with a great difficulty. Not,
  mind you, the difficulty of finding a man who hated the Colonel sufficiently
  to kill him, but that of choosing among his many enemies one who was most
  likely to have committed such a terrible crime. He was the best hated man
  in the county. Known as &lsquo;Remount Forburg&rsquo; he was generally supposed
  have made his fortune in some shady transactions connected with the Remount
  Department of the War Office during Boer War, more than twenty years ago.
  His first wife was said to have died of a broken heart, and he had no children
  of his own; some ten years ago he had married a widow with two young children.
  She had a considerable fortune of her own, and when she died she left it
  in trust for her children, but she directed that her husband should be the
  sole guardian of Monica and Gerald until they came of age; moreover, she left
  him the interest on the whole of the capital amount for as long as they were
  in his house and unmarried. After his death the money would revert unconditionally
  to them.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of course it was a foolish, one might say a criminal will, and one
  obviously made under the influence of her husband. One can only suppose that
  the poor woman had died without knowing anything of &lsquo;Remount Forburg&rsquo;s&rsquo; character.
  Since her death his violent temper and insufferable arrogance had alienated
  from the children every friend they ever had. Only some chance acquaintances
  ever came anywhere near Brudenell Court now. Naturally everyone said that
  the Colonel&rsquo;s behaviour was part of a scheme for keeping suitors away
  from his stepdaughter Monica, who was a very beautiful girl; as for Gerald
  Glenluce, Monica&rsquo;s younger brother, he had been sadly disfigured when
  he was a schoolboy through a fall against a sharp object that had broken
  his nose and somewhat mysteriously deprived him of the sight of one eye.
  Those who suffered most from Colonel Forburg&rsquo;s violent tempers declare
  that the boy&rsquo;s face had been smashed in by a blow from a stick, and
  that the stick had been wielded by his stepfather. Be that as it may, Gerald
  Glenluce had remained, in consequence of his disfigurement, a shy, retiring,
  silent boy, who neither played games nor rode to hounds and had no idea how
  to handle a gun; but he was essentially the Colonel&rsquo;s favourite. Where
  Forburg was harsh and dictatorial with everyone else he would always unbend
  to Gerald, and was almost gentle and affectionate toward him. Perhaps an
  occasional twinge of remorse had something to do with that soft side of his
  disagreeable character. Certainly that softness did not extend to Monica.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He made the girl&rsquo;s life almost unbearable with his violence
  which amounted almost to brutality. The girl hated him openly and said so.
  Her one desire was to get away from Brudenell Court by any possible means.
  But owing to her mother&rsquo;s foolish will she had no money of her own,
  and the few friends she had were not sufficiently rich, or sufficiently disinterested,
  to give her a home away from her stepfather, nor would the Colonel, for the
  matter of that, have given his consent to her living away from him. As for
  marriage, it was a difficult question. Young men fought shy of any family
  connection with &lsquo;Remount Forburg.&rsquo; The latter&rsquo;s nickname
  was bad enough, but there were rumours of secrets more unavowable still in
  the past history of the Colonel. Certain it is that though Monica excited
  admiration wherever she went, und though one or two of her admirers did go
  to the length of openly courting her, the courtship never matured into an
  actual engagement. Something or other always occurred to cool off the ardour
  of the wooers. Suddenly they would either go on a big game shooting expedition,
  or on a tour round the world, or merely find that country air did not suit
  them. There would perhaps be a scene of fond farewell, but Monica would always
  understand that the farewell was a definite one, and, as she was an intelligent
  as well as a fascinating girl, she put two and two together, and observed
  that these farewell scenes were invariably preceded by a long interview behind
  closed doors between her stepfather and her admirer of the moment. Small
  wonder then that she hated the Colonel. She hated him as much as she loved
  her brother. A great affection had, especially of late, developed between
  these two; it was a love born of an affinity of trouble and sense of injustice.
  On Gerald&rsquo;s part there was also an element of protection toward the
  beautiful sister; the fact that he was so avowedly the spoilt son of his
  irascible stepfather enabled him many a time to stand between Monica and
  the Colonel&rsquo;s unbridled temper.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Latterly, however, some brightness and romance had been introduced
  into the drab existence of Monica Glenluce by the discreet courtship of her
  latest admirer, Mr. Morley Thrall. Mr. Thrall was a wealthy man, not too
  young and of independent position, who presumably did not care whether county
  society would cut him or no in consequence of his marriage with the stepdaughter
  of &lsquo;Remount Forburg.&rsquo; Subsequent events showed that he had observed
  the greatest discretion while he was courting Monica. No one knew that there
  was an understanding between him and the girl, least of all the Colonel.
  Mr. Morley Thrall came, not too frequently, to Brudenell Court; while there
  he appeared to devote most of his attention to his host and to Gerald, and
  to take little if any notice of Monica. She had probably given him a hint
  of rocks ahead, and he had succeeded in avoiding the momentous interview
  with the Colonel which Monica had learned to look on with dread.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mr. Morley Thrall had been asked to stay at Brudenell Court for Christmas,
  the other guests being a Major Rawstone, with his wife and daughter, Rachel.
  They were all at dinner on that memorable Christmas Eve when the tragedy
  occurred, and all the men hurried out of the dining-room in the wake of their
  host when first the burglary alarm was given.&rdquo;</p>
  <h3 align="center"><b>3</b></h3>
  <p>&ldquo;Thus did matters stand at Brudenell Court when directly after the
  holidays, Jim Peyton, a groom recently in the employ of Colonel Forburg,
  was brought before the magistrates charged with the murder of his former
  master. There was a pretty stiff case against him too. It seems that he had
  lately been dismissed by Colonel Forburg for drunkenness, and that before
  dismissing him the Colonel had given him a thrashing which apparently was
  well deserved, because while he was drunk he very nearly set fire to stables,
  and an awful disaster was only averted by the timely arrival of the Colonel
  himself upon the scene.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Be that as it may, the man went away swearing vengeance. Subsequently
  he took out a summons for assault against Colonel Forburg and only got damages
  of one shilling. This had occurred a week before Christmas. There were several
  witnesses there who could swear to the threatening language used by Peyton
  on more than one occasion since then, and of course he had been caught in
  the very act of trying to break into the house through the French window
  of the smoking-room.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;On the other hand, the revolver with which &lsquo;Remount Forburg&rsquo; had
  been shot, and which was found close to the body with two empty chambers,
  was identified as the Colonel&rsquo;s own property, one which he always kept,
  loaded, in a drawer of his desk in the smoking-room. And&#8213; this is the
  interesting point&#8213; the shutters of the smoking-room were found by the
  police inspector, who examined them subsequently, to be bolted on the inside,
  just as they had been left earlier in the evening by the footman whose business
  it was to see to the fastening of windows and shutters on the ground floor.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;This fact&#8213; the shutters being bolted on the inside&#8213; was
  confirmed by Miss Monica Glenluce who had been the first to go into the smoking-room
  after the tragic event. Her brother joined her subsequently. Both of these
  witnesses said that the room looked absolutely undisturbed, the shutters
  were bolted, the drawer of the desk was closed: they had remained in the
  room until after the visit of the police inspector.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;After the positive evidence of these two witnesses, the police prosecution
  had of necessity to fall back on the far-fetched theory that Colonel Forburg
  himself, before he hurried out in order to join in the chase against the
  burglar, had run into the smoking-room and picked up his revolver, and that,
  having overtaken Peyton, he had threatened him; that Peyton had then jumped
  on him, wrenched the weapon out of his hand and shot him. It was a far-fetched
  theory certainly, and one which the defence quickly upset. Gerald Glenluce
  for one was distinctly under the impression that the Colonel ran from the
  dining-room straight out into the garden, and the young footman who was watching
  the fun from the front door, and saw the Colonel run out, was equally sure
  that he had not a revolver in his hand.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Peyton got six months hard for attempted house-breaking, there really
  was no evidence against him to justify the more serious charge; but when
  the charge of murder was withdrawn, it left the mystery of &lsquo;Remount
  Forburg&rsquo;s&rsquo; tragic end seemingly more impenetrable than before.
  Nevertheless the coroner and jury laboured conscientiously at the inquest.
  No stone was to be left unturned to bring the murderer of &lsquo;Remount
  Forburg&rsquo; to justice, and, in this laudable effort the coroner had the
  able and unqualified assistance of Miss Glenluce. However bitter her feelings
  may have been in the past towards her stepfather while he lived, she seemed
  determined that his murderer should not go unpunished. Nay more, there appeared
  to be in all her actions during this terrible time a strange note of vindictiveness
  and animosity, as if the unknown man who had rid her of an arrogant and brutal
  tyrant had really done her a lasting injury.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It was entirely through her energy and exertions that certain witnesses
  were induced to come forward and give what turned out to be highly sensational
  evidence. The police who were convinced that James Peyton was guilty had
  turned all their investigations in the direction of proving their theories;
  Miss Monica, on the other hand, had seemingly made up her mind that the murderer
  was to be sought for inside the house; it even appeared as if she had certain
  suspicions which she only desired to confirm. To this end she had questioned
  and cross-questioned everyone who was in the house on that fatal night, well
  knowing how reluctant some people are to be mixed up in any way with police
  proceedings. But at last she had forced two persons to speak, and it was
  on the first day of the inquest that at last a glimmer of light was thrown
  upon the mysterious tragedy.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;After the medical evidence which went to establish beyond a doubt
  that Colonel Forburg died from a gunshot wound inflicted at close range,
  both balls having penetrated the heart, Miss Glenluce was called. Replying
  to the coroner who had put certain questions to her with regard to the Colonel&rsquo;s
  state of mind just before the tragedy, she said that he appeared to have
  a premonition that something untoward was about to happen. When the butler
  ran into the dining-room saying that a burglar had been seen trying to break
  into the house, the Colonel had jumped up from the table at once.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I did the same,&rsquo; Miss Monica went on, &lsquo;as I was
  genuinely alarmed; but my stepfather in his peremptory way ordered me to
  sit still. &ldquo;I believe,&rdquo; he said to me with a funny laugh, &ldquo;that
  it&rsquo;s a put-up job. It&rsquo;s some friend of Thrall&rsquo;s giving
  him a hand&rdquo; I could not, of course, understand what he meant by that,
  and I looked at Mr. Thrall for an explanation. I must add that Mr. Thrall
  had been extraordinarily moody all through dinner; he looked flushed and
  I noticed particularly that he never spoke either to my stepfather, to my
  brother, or to me. However at the moment I failed to catch his eye, and the
  very next second he was out of the room, on the heels of Colonel Forburg.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;This was remarkable evidence to say the least of it, but nevertheless
  it was confirmed by two witnesses who heard the Colonel make that strange
  remark: one was Rachel Rawstone, the young friend who was dining at Brudenell
  Court that Christmas Eve, and the other was Gerald Glenluce.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of course, by this time the public was getting very excited: they
  were like so many hounds heading for a scent, and the jury was beginning
  to show signs of that obstinate prejudice which culminated presently in a
  ridiculous verdict. But there was more to come. Thanks again to Miss Monica&rsquo;s
  insistence the footman at Brudenell Court, a lad named Cambalt, had been
  induced to come forward with a story which he had evidently intended to keep
  hidden within his bosom, if possible. He gave his evidence with obvious reluctance
  and in a scarcely audible voice. It was generally noticed, however, that
  Miss Monica urged him frequently to speak up.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Cambalt deposed that just before dinner on Christmas Eve he had gone
  in to tidy the smoking-room before the gentlemen came down from dressing.
  As he opened the door he saw Mr. Morley Thrall standing in the middle of
  the room facing Colonel Forburg who was seated at his desk. Young Mr. Glenluce
  was standing near the mantelpiece with one foot on the fender staring into
  the fire. Mr. Thrall, according to witness, was livid with rage.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;&rsquo;E took a step forward like,&rsquo; Cambalt went on,
  amidst breathless silence on the part of the public and jury alike. &lsquo;and &rsquo;e
  raised &rsquo;is fist. But the Colonel &rsquo;e just laughed, then &rsquo;e
  opened the drawer of the desk and took out a revolver and showed it to Mr.
  Thrall and says: &ldquo;&rsquo;Ere y&rsquo;are, there&rsquo;s a revolver &rsquo;andy,
  any way.&rdquo; Then Mr. Thrall, &rsquo;e swore like anything and says: &ldquo;You
  blackguard! You d&#8213; d scoundrel! You ought to be shot like the cur you
  are.&rdquo; I thought &rsquo;e would strike the Colonel, but young Mr. Glenluce &rsquo;e
  just stepped quickly in between the two gentlemen and &rsquo;e says &lsquo;Look &rsquo;ere.
  Thrall, I won&rsquo;t put up with this! You jess get out!&rdquo; Then one
  of the gentlemen seed me and Mr. Thrall &rsquo;e walked out of the room.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;And what happened after he had gone?&rsquo; the coroner asked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Oh!&rsquo; the witness replied, &lsquo;the Colonel &rsquo;e
  threw the revolver back into the drawer and laughed sarcastic like. Then &rsquo;e &rsquo;eld
  out &rsquo;is &rsquo;and to Mr. Gerald and says: &ldquo;Thanks my boy. You
  did &rsquo;elp me to get rid of that ruffian.&rdquo; After that,&rsquo; Cambalt
  concluded, &lsquo;I got on with my work, and the gentlemen took no notice
  of me.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;This witness was very much pressed with questions as to what happened
  later on when the burglary alarm was given and the gentlemen all hurried
  out of the house. Cambalt was in the hall at the time and he made straight
  for the front door to see some of the fun. He said that the Colonel was out
  first and the other three gentlemen, Mr. Gerald, Mr. Rawstone and Mr. Morley
  Thrall went out after him; Mr. Thrall was the last to go outside; he ran
  across the garden in the direction of the five-acre field. Major Rawstone
  remained somewhere near the house, but it was a very dark night, and he,
  Cambalt, soon lost sight of the gentlemen. Presently, however, Mr. Thrall
  came back toward the house. It was a few minutes after the shots had been
  fired and witness heard Mr. Thrall say to Major Rawstone: &lsquo; I suppose
  it&rsquo;s that fool Forburg potting away at the burglar; he&rsquo;ll get
  himself into trouble if he doesn&rsquo;t look out.&rsquo; Soon after that
  Mr. Gerald came running back with the news that the burglar had fallen into
  the arms of a passing constable and Cambalt then returned to his duties in
  the dining-room.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;As you see,&rdquo; the Man in the Corner went on glibly, &ldquo;the
  witness&rsquo;s evidence was certainly sensational. The jury, which was composed
  of farm labourers, with the local butcher at foreman, had by now fully made
  up its silly mind that Mr. Morley Thrall had taken the opportunity of sneaking
  into the smoking-room, snatching up the revolver and shooting &lsquo;Remount
  Forburg,&rsquo; whom he hated, because the Colonel was opposing his marriage
  with Miss Monica.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It was all as clear as daylight to those dunderheads, and from that
  moment they simply would not listen to any more evidence. They had made up
  their minds; they were ready with their verdict and it was: Manslaughter
  against Morley Thrall. Not murder you see! The dolts who had all of them
  suffered from &lsquo;Remount Forburg&rsquo;s&rsquo; arrogance and violent
  temper would not admit that killing such vermin was a capital crime.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What I am telling you would be unbelievable if it were not a positive
  fact. It is no use quoting British justice and dilating on the absolute fairness
  of trial by jury. A coroner&rsquo;s inquest fortunately is not a trial. The
  verdict of a coroner&rsquo;s jury, such as the one which sat on the Brudenell
  Court affair, though it may have very unpleasant consequences for an innocent
  person, cannot have fatal results. In this case it cast a stigma on a gentleman
  of high position and repute, and the following day Mr. Morley Thrall, himself
  J.P., was brought up before his brother magistrates on an ignominious charge.</p>
  <h3 align="center"><b>4</b></h3>
  <p>&ldquo;It is not often,&rdquo; the Man in the Corner resumed after a while, &ldquo;that
  so serious a charge is preferred against a gentleman of Mr. Morley Thrall&rsquo;s
  social position, and I am afraid that the best of us are snobbish enough
  to be more interested in a gentleman criminal than in an ordinary Bill Sykes.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I happened to be present at that magisterial inquiry when Mr. Morley
  Thrall, J.P., was brought in between two warders, looking quite calm and
  self-possessed. Everyone of us there noticed that when he first came in,
  and in fact throughout that trying inquiry, his eyes sought to meet those
  of Miss Glenluce who sat at the solicitor&rsquo;s table; but whenever she chanced
  to look his way, she quickly averted her gaze again, and turned her head away
  with a contemptuous shrug. Gerald Glenluce, on the other hand, made pathetic
  efforts at bowing sympathy with the accused, but he was of such unprepossessing
  appearance and was so shy and awkward that it was small wonder Morley Thrall
  took little if any notice of him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Very soon we got going. I must tell you first of all that the whole
  point of the evidence rested upon a question of time. If the accused took
  the revolver out of the desk in the smoking-room, when did he do it? The
  footman, Cambalt, reiterated the statement which he had made at the inquest.
  He was, of course, pressed to say definitely whether after the quarrel between
  Mr. Morley Thrall and the Colonel which he had witnessed, and before everyone
  went in to dinner, Mr. Thrall might have gone back to the smoking-room and
  extracted the revolver from the drawer of the desk; but Cambalt said positively
  that he did not think this was possible. He himself, after he had tidied
  the smoking-room, had been in and out of the hall preparing to serve dinner.
  The door of the smoking-room gave on the hall, between the dining room and
  the passage leading to the kitchens. If anyone had gone in or out of the
  smoking-room at that time Cambalt must have seen them.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;At this point Miss Glenluce was seen to lean forward and to say something
  in a whisper to the Clerk of the Justices, who in his turn whispered to the
  chairman on the Bench, and a moment or two later that gentleman asked the
  witness:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Are you absolutely prepared to swear that no one went in or
  out of the smoking-room while you were making ready to serve dinner?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then, as the young man seemed to hesitate, the magistrate added more
  emphatically:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Think now! You were busy with your usual avocations; there
  would have been nothing extraordinary in one of the gentlemen going in or
  out of the smoking-room at that hour. Do you really believe and are you prepared
  to swear that such a very ordinary incident would have impressed itself indelibly
  upon your mind?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Thus pressed and admonished, Cambalt retrenched himself behind a
  vague,</p>
  <p>&lsquo;No sir! I shouldn&rsquo;t like to swear one way or the other.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Whereat Miss Monica threw a defiant look at the accused who, however,
  did not as much as wink an eyelid in response.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Presently when that lady herself was called no one could fail to
  notice that she, like the coroner&rsquo;s jury the previous day, had absolutely
  made up her mind that Morley Thrall was guilty, otherwise her attitude of
  open hostility toward him would have been quite inexplicable. She dwelt at
  length on the fact that Mr Thrall had paid her marked attention for months,
  and that he had asked her to marry him.</p>
  <p>She had given him her consent, and between them they had decided to keep
  their engagement a secret, until after she, Monica, had attained her twenty-first
  birthday, when she would be free to marry whom she chose.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Unfortunately,&rsquo; the witness went on, suddenly assuming
  a dry, pursed-up manner, &lsquo;Colonel Forburg got wind of this. He was
  always very much set against my marrying at all, and between tea and dinner
  on Christmas Eve he and I had some very sharp words together on the subject,
  at the end of which my stepfather said very determinedly: &ldquo;Christmas
  or no Christmas, the fellow shall leave my house by the first available train
  tomorrow, and tonight I am going to give him a piece of my mind.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Just for a moment after Miss Glenluce had finished speaking, the
  accused seemed to depart from his attitude of dignity and reserve, and an
  indignant &lsquo;Oh!&rsquo; quickly repressed, escaped his lips. The public
  by this time was dead against him. They are just like sheep, as you know,
  and the verdict of the coroner&rsquo;s jury had prejudiced them from the
  start, and the police, aided by Miss Glenluce, had certainly built up a formidable
  case against the unfortunate man. Everyone felt that the motive for the crime
  was fully established already. &lsquo;Remount Forburg&rsquo; had had a violent
  quarrel with Morley Thrall, then had turned him out of the house, and the
  latter, furious at being separated from the girl he loved, had killed the
  man who stood in his way.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I should be talking until tomorrow morning were I to give you in
  detail all the evidence that was adduced in support of the prosecution. The
  accused listened to it all with perfect calm. He stood with arms folded,
  his eyes fixed on nothing. The &lsquo;Oh!&rsquo; of indignation did not again
  cross his lips, nor did he look once at Miss Monica Glenluce. I can assure
  you that at one moment that day things were looking very black against him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Fortunately for him, however, he had a very clever lawyer to defend
  him in the person of his distinguished cousin, Sir Evelyn Thrall. The latter,
  by amazingly clever cross-examination of the servants and guests at Brudenell
  Court, had succeeded in establishing the fact that at no time, from the moment
  that the burglary alarm was given until after the two revolver shots had
  been heard, was the accused completely out of sight of someone or other of
  the witnesses. He was the last to leave the dining-room. Mrs. Rawstone and
  her daughter testified to that. He had stayed behind one moment after the
  other three gentlemen had gone out in order to say a few words to Monica
  Glenluce. Miss Rawstone was standing inside the dining-room door and she
  was quite positive that Mr. Thrall went straight out into the garden.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;On the other hand Major Rawstone saw him in the forecourt coming
  away from the five-acre meadow only a very few moments after the shots were
  fired, and gave it absolutely as his opinion that it would have been impossible
  for the accused to have fired those shots. This is where the question of
  time came in.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;When a man who bears a spotless reputation,&rsquo; Major
  Rawstone argued, &lsquo;finds that he has killed a fellow creature, he would
  necessarily pause a moment, horror-struck with what he has done; whether
  the deed was premeditated or involuntary he would at least try and ascertain
  if life was really extinct. It is inconceivable that any man, save an habitual
  and therefore callous criminal, would just throw down his weapon and with
  absolute calm, hands in pocket and without a tremor in his voice make a casual
  remark to a friend. Now I saw Mr. Morley Thrall perhaps two minutes after
  the shots were fired; in that time he could not have walked from the centre
  of the field to the forecourt where I was standing and he had not been running
  as his voice was absolutely clear and he came walking towards me with his
  hands in pockets.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;As was only to be expected Sir Evelyn Thrall made the most of Major
  Rawstone&rsquo;s evidence, and I may say that it was chiefly on the strength
  of it that the charge of murder against the accused was withdrawn, even though
  the Clerk to the Magistrates, perpetually egged on by Miss Glenluce, did
  his best to upset Major Rawstone. When the lady found that this could not
  be done, she tried to switch back to the idea that accused had abstracted
  the revolver out of the morning-room before dinner and immediately after
  his quarrel with Colonel Forburg. The footman Cambalt&rsquo;s evidence on
  this point had been somewhat discounted by his refusing to state positively
  that no one could have gone into the smoking-room at that time without his
  seeing them. But against this theory there was always the argument&#8213; of
  which Sir Evelyn Thrall made the most as you know&#8213; that before dinner
  the accused could not have known that there would be an alarm of burglary
  which would give him the opportunity of waylaying the Colonel in the open
  field.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;With equal skill, too, Sir Evelyn brought forward evidence to bear
  out the statement made by the accused on the matter of his quarrel with Colonel
  Forburg.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Just before dinner,&rsquo; Mr. Thrall stated, &lsquo;Colonel
  Forburg told me he had something to say to me in private. I followed him
  into the smoking-room and there he gave me certain information with regard
  to his past life and also with regard to Miss Glenluce&rsquo;s parentage
  which made it absolutely impossible for me, in spite of the deep regard which
  I have for that lady, to offer her marriage. Miss Glenluce is the innocent
  victim of tragic circumstances in the past, and Forburg is just an unmitigated
  blackguard, and I told him so, but I had my family to consider and very reluctantly
  I came to the conclusion that I could not introduce any relation of Colonel
  Forburg into its circle. Colonel Forburg did not stand in the way of my marrying
  his stepdaughter, it is I who most reluctantly withdrew.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Whilst the accused was cross-examined upon this statement, and he
  gave his answers in firm, dignified tones, Miss Monica never took her eyes
  off him, and surely if looks could kill, Mr. Morley Thrall would not at that
  moment have escaped with his life, so full of deadly hatred and contempt
  was her gaze. The accused had signed a much fuller statement than the one
  which he had made in open court: it contained a detailed account of his interview
  with Colonel Forburg, and of the circumstances which finally induced him
  to give up all thoughts of asking Miss Glenluce to be his wife. These facts
  were not made public at the time for the sake of Miss Monica and of the unfortunate
  Gerald, but it seems that the transactions which had earned for the Colonel
  the sobriquet of &lsquo;Remount Forburg&rsquo; were so disreputable and so
  dishonest that not only was he cashiered from the army, but he served a term
  of imprisonment for treason, fraud and embezzlement.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He had no right to be styled Colonel any longer, and quite recently
  had been threatened with prosecution if he persisted in making further use
  of his army rank. But that was not all the trouble. It seems that in his
  career of improbity he had been associated with a man named Nosdel, a man
  of Dutch extraction whom he had known in South Africa,, This man was subsequently
  hanged for a particularly brutal murder, and it was his widow who was &lsquo;Remount
  Forburg&rsquo;s&rsquo; second wife and the mother of Monica and of Gerald,
  who had been given the fancy name of Glenluce.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Obviously a man in Mr Morley Thrall&rsquo;s position could not marry
  into such a family, and it appears that whenever there was a question of
  a suitor for Monica, &lsquo;Remount Forburg&rsquo; would tell the aspirant
  the whole story of his own shady past and, above all, that of Monica&rsquo;s
  father. Sir Evelyn Thrall had been clever enough to discover one or two gentlemen
  who had had the same experience as his cousin Morley; they, too, just before
  their courtship came to a head had had a momentous interview with &lsquo;Remount
  Forburg,&rsquo; who found this means of choking off any further desire for
  matrimony on the part of a man who had family connections to consider. But
  it was very obvious that Mr. Morley Thrall had no motive for killing &lsquo;Remount
  Forburg&rsquo;; he would have left Brudenell Court that very evening, he
  said, only that young Glenluce had begged him, for Monica&rsquo;s sake, not
  to make a scene; anyway, he was leaving the house next day and had no intention
  of ever darkening its doors again.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Poor Monica Glenluce or Nosdel, ignorant of the hideous cloud that
  hung over her entire life, ignorant too of what passed between her stepfather
  and Mr. Morley Thrall, nothing but hatred and contempt for the man whose
  love, she believed, had proved as unstable as that of any of her other admirers.
  For charity&rsquo;s sake one must suppose that she really thought him guilty
  at first, and hoped that when the clouds had rolled by he would return to
  her, more ardent than before. Presumably he found means to make her understand
  that all was irrevocably at an end between them as far as he was concerned,
  whereupon her regard for him turned bitterness and desire for revenge.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And, indeed, but for the cleverness of a distinguished lawyer, poor
  Morley Thrall might have found himself the victim of a judicial error brought
  about by the deliberate enmity of a woman. Had he been committed for trial,
  she would have had more time at her disposal to manufacture evidence against
  him, which I am convinced she had a mind to do.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;As it is,&rdquo; I now put in tentatively, for the Man in the Corner
  had been silent for some little while, &ldquo;the withdrawal of the charge
  of murder against Morley Thrall did not help to clear up the mystery of &lsquo;Remount
  Forburg&rsquo;s&rsquo; tragic death.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not as far as the public is concerned,&rdquo; he retorted drily.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You have a theory?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not a theory,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;I know who killed &lsquo;Remount
  Forburg.&rsquo;&ldquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How do you know?&rdquo; I riposted.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;By logic and inference,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;As it was proved that
  Morley Thrall did not kill him, and that Miss Monica could not have done
  it, as the ladies did not join in the chase after the burglar, I looked about
  me for the only other person in whose interest it was to put that blackguard
  out of the way.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You mean&#8213;?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I mean the boy Gerald, of course. Openly and before the other witness
  Cambalt, he stood up for his stepfather against Thrall who was not measuring
  his words, but just think how the knowledge which he had gained about his
  own parentage and that of his sister must have rankled in his mind. He must
  have come to the conclusion that while this man&#8213; his stepfather&#8213; lived,
  there would be no chance for him to make friends, no chance for the sister
  whom he loved ever to have a home, a life of her own. Whether that interview
  on Christmas Eve was the first inkling which he had of the real past history
  of his own and Forburg&rsquo;s family, it is impossible to say. Probably
  he had suspicions of it before, when, one by one, Monica&rsquo;s suitors
  fell away after certain private interviews with the Colonel. Morley Thrall
  must have been a last hope, and that, too, was dashed to the ground by the
  same infamous means.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I am not prepared to say that the boy got hold of the revolver that
  night with the deliberate intention of killing his stepfather at the earliest
  opportunity: he may have run into the smoking-room to snatch up the weapon,
  only with a view to using it against the burglar; certain it is that he overtook &lsquo;Remount
  Forburg&rsquo; in the five-acre field and that he shot him then and there.
  Remember that the night was very dark, and that there was a great deal of
  running about and of confusion. The boy was young enough and nimble enough
  after he had thrown down the revolver to run across the field and then to
  go back to the house by a roundabout way. It is easy enough in a case like
  that to cover one&rsquo;s tracks, and, of course, no one suspected anything
  at the time. Even the sound of firing created but little astonishment; it
  was so very much on the cards that the Colonel would use a revolver without
  the slightest hesitation against a man who had been trying to break into
  his house. It was just the sort of revenge that a man of Gerald&rsquo;s temperament&mdash;disfigured,
  shy, silent and self-absorbed&#8213; would seek against one whom he considered
  the fount of all his wrongs.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; I objected, &ldquo;how could young Glenluce run into
  the smoking-room, pick up the revolver out of a drawer, and run back through
  the hall with servants and guests standing about. Someone would be sure to
  see him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No one saw him,&rdquo; the funny creature retorted, &ldquo;for he
  did it at the moment of the greatest confusion. The butler had run in with
  the news of the burglary, the Colonel jumped up and ran out through the hall,
  the guests had not yet made up their minds what to do. In moments like this
  there are always just a few seconds of pandemonium, quite sufficient for
  a boy like Gerald to make a dash for the smoking-room.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But after that&#8213;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;After that he took the revolver out of the drawer and ran out through
  the French window.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But the shutters were found to be bolted on the inside,&rdquo; I
  argued, &ldquo;when they were subsequently examined by police inspector.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So they were,&rdquo; he admitted. &ldquo;Miss Monica had already
  been in there with young Gerald. They had seen to the shutters.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then you think that Monica knew?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of course she did.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then her desire to prove Morley Thrall guilty&#8213;?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Was partly hatred of him and partly the desire to shield her brother,&rdquo; the
  funny creature concluded as he collected his traps, his bit of string and
  his huge umbrella. &ldquo;Think it over; you will see that I am right. I
  am sorry for those two, aren&rsquo;t you? But they are selling Brudenell
  Court, I understand, and their mother&rsquo;s fortune has become theirs absolutely.
  They will go abroad together, make a home for themselves, and one day, perhaps,
  everything will be forgotten, and a new era of happiness will arise for the
  innocent, now that the guilty has been so signally punished. But it was an
  interesting case. Don&rsquo;t you agree with me?&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="TheMysteryOfTheWhiteCarnation"></a>The Mystery Of The White Carnation</b> </h2>
  <h3 align="center"><b>1</b></h3>
  <p>&ldquo;I suppose that it is a form of snobbishness,&rdquo; the Man in the
  Corner began abruptly.</p>
  <p>I gave such a jump that I nearly upset the contents of a cup of boiling
  tea which I was conveying to my mouth. As it was, I scalded my tongue and
  nearly choked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What is?&rdquo; I queried with a frown, for I was really vexed with
  the creature. I had no idea he was there at all. But he only smiled and concluded
  his speech, quite unperturbed.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;...that creates additional interest in a crime when it concerns people
  of wealth or rank.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Snobbishness,&rdquo; I rejoined, &ldquo;of course it&rsquo;s snobbishness!
  And when the little suburban madam has finished reading about Lady Stickinthemud&rsquo;s
  reception at Claridge&rsquo;s, she likes to turn to Lord Tomnoodle&rsquo;s
  prospective sojourn in gaol.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You were thinking of the disappearance of the Australian millionaire?&rdquo; he
  asked blandly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know that I was,&rdquo; I retorted.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But of course you were. How could any journalist worthy of the name
  fail to be interested in that intricate case?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I suppose you have your theory&#8213; as usual?</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It is not a theory,&rdquo; the creature replied, with that fatuous
  smile of his which always irritated me; &ldquo;it is a certainty.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Then, as he became silent, absorbed in the contemplation of a wonderfully
  complicated knot in his beloved bit of string, I said with gracious condescension:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You may talk about it, if you like.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He did like, fortunately for me, because, frankly, I could not see daylight
  in that maze of intrigue, adventure and possibly crime, which was described
  by the Press as &ldquo;The Mystery of the White Carnation.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The events were interesting from the outset,&rdquo; he began after
  a while, whilst I settled down to listen, &ldquo;and so were the various
  actors in the society drama. Chief amongst these was, of course, Captain
  Shillington, an Australian ex-officer, commonly reputed to be a millionaire,
  who, with his mother and sister, rented Mexfield House in Somerset Street,
  Mayfair, the summer before last. It appears that Lord Mexfield&rsquo;s younger
  son, the Honourable Henry Buckley, who was an incorrigible rake and whom
  his father had sent on a tour round the world in order to keep him temporarily
  out of mischief, not to say out of gaol, had met a married brother of Captain
  Shillington&rsquo;s out in the Antipodes; they had been very kind to him,
  and so on, with the result that when came the following London season the
  family turned up in England and, after spending a couple of days at the Savoy,
  they moved into the Mexfields&rsquo; house in Somerset Street.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Lord and Lady Mexfield were abroad that year and Henry Buckley and
  his sister Angela were living with an aunt who had a small house somewhere
  in Mayfair.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Although the Shillingtons were reputed to be very wealthy, they appeared
  to be very quiet, simple folk, and it certainly seemed rather strange that
  they should have gone to the expense of a house in town, when obviously they
  had no social ambitions and did not mean to entertain. As a matter of fact,
  as far as Mrs. Shillington and her daughter were concerned, nobody could
  have lived a quieter, more retiring life than they did. Mrs. Shillington
  was an invalid and hardly ever went outside her front door, and the girl
  Marion seemed to be suffering from a perpetual cold in the head.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;They seemed to be in a chronic state of servant trouble. Mrs. Shillington
  was dreadfully irritable and one set of servants after another were engaged
  only to leave without notice after a few days. The only faithful servant
  who remained was a snuffy old man who came to them about a month after they
  moved into Mexfield House. He and a charwoman did all the work of cooking
  and valeting and so on. Presumably the old man could not have got a situation
  elsewhere as his appearance was very unprepossessing, and therefore he was
  willing to put up with what the servants&rsquo; registry offices would term &lsquo;a
  very uncomfortable situation.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Captain Shillington, the hero of the tragic adventure, on the other
  hand, went about quite a good deal. He was certainly voted to be rather straightlaced,
  not to say priggish, but he was very good looking and a fine dancer. Henry
  Buckley introduced him to some of his smart friends and Lady Angela constituted
  him her dancing partner. This partnership soon developed into warmer friendship,
  and presently it was given out that Lady Angela Buckley, only daughter of
  the Earl and Countess of Mexfield, was engaged to Captain Denver Shillington,
  the Australian millionaire. Lady Angela confided to her friends that her
  fiance was the owner of immense estates in Western Australia, on a portion
  of which rich deposits of gold had lately been discovered. He certainly had
  plenty of money to spend, and on one occasion he actually paid Henry Buckley&rsquo;s
  gambling debts to the tune of two or three hundred pounds.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;On the whole, society pronounced the match a suitable one. Lady Angela
  Buckley was no longer in her first youth, whilst her brother, to whom she
  was really devoted, would be all the better for a somewhat puritanical, straight-laced
  and above all wealthy brother-in-law.</p>
  <h3 align="center"><b>2</b></h3>
  <p>&ldquo;That, then, was the position,&rdquo; the old Man in the Corner continued,
  after a while, &ldquo;and the date of Lady Angela Buckley&rsquo;s marriage
  to Captain Denver Shillington had been actually fixed when the public was
  startled one afternoon towards the end of the summer by the sensational news
  in all the evening papers: &lsquo;Mysterious disappearance of a millionaire.&rsquo; This
  highly coloured description applied, as it turned out, to Captain Shillington,
  the fiance of Lady Angela Buckley. It seems that during the course of that
  same morning a young lady, apparently in deep distress and suffering from
  a streaming cold in the head, had called at Scotland Yard. She gave her name
  and address as Marion Shillington of Mexfield House, Somerset Street, Mayfair,
  and stated that she and her mother were in the greatest possible anxiety
  owing to the disappearance of her brother, Captain Denver Shillington. They
  had last seen him on the previous Friday evening at about nine o&rsquo;clock
  when he left home in order to pick up his fiancee, Lady Angela Buckley, whom
  he was escorting that night to a reception in Grosvenor Square. He was wearing
  full evening dress and a soft hat. Miss Shillington couldn&rsquo;t say whether
  he had any money in his pockets. She thought that probably he was carrying
  a gold cigarette case which Lady Angela had given him, but, as a matter of
  fact, he never wore any jewellery.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No one in the house had heard him come in again that night, and his
  bed had not been slept in. Questioned by the police, Miss Shillington explained
  that neither she nor her mother felt any alarm at first because there had
  been some talk of Captain Shillington going away with his fiancee to stay
  with friends over the weekend somewhere near Newmarket. It was only this
  morning, Wednesday, that Mrs. Shillington first began to worry when there
  was still no sign or letter from him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;My brother is a very good son,&rsquo; Miss Shillington continued,
  explaining to the police, &ldquo;and always very considerate to mother. It
  was so unlike him to leave us without news all this while and not to let
  us know when to expect him home. So I rang up Lady Angela Buckley, who is
  his fiancee, to see if I could get news through her, as I could see mother
  was beginning to get anxious.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Mr. Henry Buckley, Lady Angela&rsquo;s brother, answered the &rsquo;phone.
  I asked after his sister and he told me that she was staying on in the country
  a day or two longer. He himself had come back to town the previous night.
  I then asked him, quite casually, if he knew whether Denver&#8213; that&rsquo;s
  my brother&#8213; would be returning with Angela. And his answer to me was, &ldquo;Denver?
  Why, I haven&rsquo;t seen him since Friday, and I can tell you he is in for
  a row with Angela. She was furious with him that he never wrote once to her
  while she was away.&rdquo; I was so upset that I hung up the receiver and
  just sat there wondering what to do next. But Mr. Buckley rang up a moment
  or two later and asked quite cheerily if there was anything wrong. &ldquo;Good
  old Square-toes!&rdquo; he said, meaning my brother, whom he always used
  to chaff by calling him &lsquo;Square-toes,&rsquo; &ldquo;don&rsquo;t tell
  me he has gone off on the spree without letting you know. I say, that&rsquo;s
  too bad of him, though. But I shouldn&rsquo;t be anxious, if I were you.
  Boys, you know, Miss Shillington, will be boys, and I like old Square-toes
  all the better for it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Miss Shillington,&rdquo; the old Man in the Corner went on, &ldquo;was,
  as usual, suffering from a streaming cold, and between spluttering and crying
  she had reduced two or three handkerchiefs to wet balls. At best she is no
  beauty, and with a red nose and streaming eyes she presented a most pitiable
  spectacle.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I made Mr. Buckley assure me once more,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;that
  he had seen nothing of Denver since Friday. That night he and Lady Angela
  and Denver were at a reception in Grosvenor Square. They all left about the
  same time. Angela and Denver went presumably straight home; at any rate,
  he, Mr. Buckley, saw nothing more of them after they got into their car.
  He himself went to spend an hour or two at his club and came home about two
  am. The next morning, after breakfast, he drove his sister out to Tatchford,
  near Newmarket, where they spent the weekend with some friends. And that
  was all Mr. Buckley could say to me.&rsquo; Miss Shillington concluded, vigorously
  blowing her nose: &lsquo;He came home last night from Tatchford, and was
  expecting Lady Angela in a couple of days. Denver had not been at Tatchford
  at all, and he had not once written to Angela all the while she was away.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of course the police inspector to whom Miss Shillington related all
  these facts had a great many questions to put to her. For one thing he wanted
  to know whether she had been in communication with Lady Angela Buckley since
  this morning.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;No,&rsquo; the girl replied, &lsquo;I have not, and so far
  I haven&rsquo;t said anything to mother. As soon as I felt strong enough
  I put on my things and came along here.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then the inspector wanted to know if she knew of any friends or acquaintances
  of her brother&rsquo;s with whom he might have gone off for a weekend jaunt
  without saying anything about it, either at home or to his fiancee. He put
  the questions as delicately as he could, but the sister flared up with indignation.
  It seems that the Captain&rsquo;s conduct had always been irreproachable.
  He was a model son, a model brother, and deeply in love with Angela. Miss
  Shillington also refused to believe that he could have been enticed to a
  place of ill-fame and robbed by one of the usual confidence-tricksters.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;My brother is exceptionally shrewd,&rsquo; she declared, &lsquo;and
  a splendid business man. Though he is not yet thirty he has built up an enormous
  fortune out in Australia, and administers his estates himself to the admiration
  of everyone who knows him. He is not the sort of man who could be fooled
  in that way.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But beyond all this, and beyond giving a detailed description of
  her brother&rsquo;s appearance, the poor girl had very little to say, and
  the detective who was put in charge of the case could only assure her that
  enquiries would at once be instituted in every possible direction, and that
  the police would keep her informed of everything that was being done. Obviously,
  the person most likely to be able to throw some light upon the mystery was
  Lady Angela Buckley, but as you know, the advent of this charming lady upon
  the scene only helped to complicate matters.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It appears that Henry Buckley, delighted at what he jocosely called, &ldquo;Old
  Square-toes&rdquo; falling from grace,&rdquo; had rung up his sister in order
  to tell her the startling news over the telephone. Lady Angela being a very
  modern young woman, her brother thought that she might storm for a bit, but
  in end see the humorous side of the situation. But not at all! Lady Angela
  took the affair entirely <i>au tragique</i>. Over telephone she only exclaimed &lsquo;Great
  Lord!&rsquo; but at o&rsquo;clock after noon she arrived at the flat, having
  taken the first train up to town and not even waiting for her maid to pack
  her things. Mr. Henry Buckley was just going out to lunch. Without condescending
  to explain anything, his sister dragged him off then and there to Scotland
  Yard. &ldquo;Something happened to Denver,&rdquo; was all that she would
  say. &ldquo;Something dreadful, I am sure.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>In vain did her brother protest that she would only be making a fool of
    herself by rushing to the police like this, that old Square-toes had only
    gone on the spree, and that anyway he ought to consult with the Shillingtons
    before doing anything silly; Lady Angela would not listen to reason. &ldquo;You
  don&rsquo;t know! You don&rsquo;t know!&rdquo; she kept on reiterating with
  ever-increasing agitation. &lsquo;He has been murdered, I tell you. Murdered!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;By the time that the pair arrived at Scotland Yard Lady Angela was
  in a state bordering on hysterics, and her brother appeared both sulky and
  perplexed. They saw the same Inspector who had interviewed Miss Shillington,
  and certainly his amazement was no whit less than that of Mr. Henry Buckley&rsquo;s
  when Lady Angela, having mentioned the disappearance of Captain Denver Shillington,
  said abruptly. &lsquo;Yes, he has disappeared, and incidentally, he had my
  pearls in his pocket.&rsquo; The Inspector made no immediate comment; men
  of his calling are used to those kinds of surprises, but Henry Buckley gave
  a gasp of horror.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Your pearls?&rsquo; he exclaimed. &lsquo;What pearls? Not&#8213;?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; Lady Angela rejoined coolly. &lsquo;The Glenarm
  pearls. All of them!&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;But&#8213;&rsquo; Henry Buckley stammered, wide-eyed and white
  to the lips.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;His sister threw him what appeared to be a warning glance, then she
  turned once more to the police inspector.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;My brother is upset,&rsquo; she said calmly, &lsquo;because
  he knows that the pearls are of immense value. The late Lord Glenarm left
  them to me in his will. He made a huge fortune by a successful speculation
  in sugar. He had no daughters of his own and late in life he married my mother&rsquo;s
  sister. He was my godfather, and when he first bought the pearls and gave
  them to his wife as a wedding present, he said that after her death and his
  they should belong to me. They were valued for probate at twenty-five thousand
  pounds.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Henry Buckley was still speechless, and it was in answer to several
  questions put to her by the inspector that Lady Angela gave the full history,
  as far as she knew it, of the disappearance of her pearls.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I was going to spend the weekend with some friends at Tatchford,
  near Newmarket,&rsquo; she said. &lsquo;My brother at first had decided not
  to come with me. On the Friday evening I went with Captain Shillington to
  a ball at the Duchess of Flint&rsquo;s in Grosvenor Square. I wore my pearls;
  on the way home in the car Captain Shillington appeared very anxious as to
  what I should do about the pearls whilst I was away. He wanted me to take
  them to the bank first thing in the morning before I left. But I knew I couldn&rsquo;t
  do this because my train was at nine-fifty from Liverpool Street. Captain
  Shillington had once or twice before shown anxiety about the pearls and urged
  me to keep them at the bank when I was not wearing them, but he had never
  been so insistent as that night.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Lady Angela appeared to hesitate for a moment or two. She glanced
  at her brother with a curious expression, both of anxiety and contempt. It
  seemed as if she were trying to make up her mind to say something that was
  very difficult to put in so many words. The inspector sat silent and impassive,
  waiting for her to continue her story, and at last she did make up her mind
  to speak.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I had a safe in the flat,&rsquo; she went on glibly, &lsquo;where
  I keep my jewellery, but Captain Shillington did not seem satisfied. He argued
  and argued, and at last he persuaded me to let him have the pearls while
  I was away and he would deposit them at his own bank until my return.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Presumably at this point the lady caught an expression on the face
  of the inspector which displeased her, for she added with becoming dignity, &lsquo;I
  am engaged to be married to Captain Denver Shillington.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;My God!&rsquo; Henry Buckley exclaimed at this point, and
  with a groan he buried his face in his hands.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mind you,&rdquo; the Man in the Corner proceeded, after moment&rsquo;s
  pause, &ldquo;the public had no information as to the exact words, and so
  on, that passed between Lady Angela, her brother Henry, and the officials
  of Scotland Yard. All that I am telling you, and what I am still about to
  tell you, came out bit by bit in the papers. Sensation lovers were immensely
  interested in the case from the outset, because although both public and
  police are familiar enough with the tragi-comedy of the good-looking young
  blackguard who gets confiding females to entrust him with their little bits
  of jewellery, this was the first time that the confidence trick had been
  played by a well-known man about town&#8213; reputed wealthy since he had
  gone to the length of paying a friend&rsquo;s gambling debts&#8213; on a
  society lady who was not in her first youth and must presumably have had
  some knowledge of the world she lived in.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Lady Angela had concluded her statements by saying that during the
  drive home in the car she took off her pearls and handed them to her fiance
  who slipped them into his pocket just as they were, although when presently
  the car drew up at her door she suggested running up to her room to get the
  case for them. The Captain, however, declared this to be unnecessary. What
  he said was, &lsquo;I will sleep with them under my pillow tonight, and tomorrow
  morning first thing I will take them round to the bank for you.&rsquo; After
  this he said good night. Lady Angela let herself into the house with her
  latch-key, and Captain Shillington then dismissed the car, saying that he
  would enjoy a bit of a walk as the rooms at Grosvenor Square had been so
  desperately hot.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And it was at this point,&rdquo; the Man in the Corner now said with
  deliberate emphasis as he worked away at an exceptionally intricate knot
  in his beloved bit of string, &ldquo;it was at this point that certain facts
  leaked out which lent to the whole case a sinister aspect.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It appears that on the Saturday morning at break of day one of the
  boats belonging to the Thames District Police found a grey Homburg hat floating
  under one of the old steamship landing stages and stuck to one of the wooden
  piles close by a man&rsquo;s silk scarf. There was no name inside the hat
  or any other clue as to the owner&rsquo;s identity, but both the scarf, which
  had once been white or light grey, and the hat were terribly soiled and torn,
  and both were stained with blood. The police had tried on the quiet to trace
  the owner of the hat and scarf but without success. After Lady Angela had
  told her story of the missing pearls, the things were shown to Miss Shillington,
  who at once identified the hat as belonging to her brother; the scarf, however,
  she knew nothing about.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But this was not by any means all. It appears that for some reason
  which was never quite clear, Captain Shillington, after he said good night
  to Lady Angela, altered his mind about the proposed walk. It may have started
  to rain, or he may not, after all, have liked the idea of walking about the
  streets at night with twenty-five thousand pounds&rsquo; worth of pearls
  in his pocket. Be that as it may, he hailed a passing taxi and drove to Mexfield
  House. The driver came forward voluntarily in answer to an advertisement
  put in the papers by the police. He stated that he remembered the circumstance
  quite well because of what followed. He remembered taking up a fare outside
  Stanhope Gate and being ordered to drive to Mexfield House in Somerset Street.
  When he slowed down close to Mexfield House, he noticed a man with his hands
  in his pockets lounging under the doorway of one of the houses close by.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;As far as he could see the man was in evening dress and wore a light
  overcoat. He had on a silk hat tilted right to his eyes so that only the lower
  part of his face was visible, and he had a white or pale grey scarf tied
  loosely round his face. The chauffeur also noticed that he had a large white
  flower, probably a carnation, in his buttonhole. After the taxi-man had put
  down his fare he drove off, and as he did so he saw the man in the light
  overcoat step out from under the doorway where he had been lounging, and
  turn in the direction of Maxfield House. What happened after that he didn&rsquo;t
  know, as he drove away without taking further notice, but the police were
  already in touch with another man who had been watching that night in Somerset
  Street, where a portion of the road was up for repair.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;This man whose name, I think, was William Rugger, remembered quite
  distinctly seeing a &lsquo;swell&rsquo; in a light overcoat and wearing a
  light-coloured scarf round his neck, loafing around Mexfield House. He remembered
  the taxi drawing up and a gentleman getting out of it, whereupon the one
  in the light overcoat and the scarf went up to him and said, &lsquo;Hallo,
  Denver!&rsquo; at which the other gent, the one who had come in the taxi,
  appeared very surprised, for Rugger heard him say; &lsquo;Good Lord, Henry,
  what are you doing here?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Rugger didn&rsquo;t hear any more because the gentleman in the light
  overcoat then took the other one by the arm and together the pair of them
  walked away down the street. When they had gone Rugger noticed a large white
  carnation lying on the pavement; he picked it up and subsequently took it
  home to his missus.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You may imagine what a stir and excitement this story&#8213; which
  pretty soon leaked out in all its details&#8213; caused amongst the public.
  It seems that, although neither the taxi driver nor the man Rugger had seen
  the face of the man who had stepped out from under a neighbouring doorway
  and accosted Captain Shillington, they were both of them quite positive that
  he was in evening dress, and that he wore a silk hat, a light overcoat, and
  had a pale grey or white scarf wound round his neck. And besides that, there
  was the white carnation. But, of course, the crux of the whole evidence was
  Rugger&rsquo;s assertion that he heard one gentleman&#8213; the one who got
  out of the cab&#8213; say to the other in tones of great surprise, &lsquo;Good
  Lord, Henry, what are you doing here?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Questioned again and again he never wavered in this statement. He
  heard the name Henry quite distinctly and it stuck in his mind because his
  eldest boy was Henry. He was also asked whether the gentleman who had stepped
  out of the taxi&#8213; obviously Captain Shillington since the other had
  called to him &lsquo;Hello, Denver!&rsquo;&#8213; walked away reluctantly
  or willingly when he was thus summarily taken hold of by the arm. Rugger
  was under the impression that he walked away reluctantly; he freed his arm
  once, but the other got hold of him again, and, though Rugger did not catch
  the actual words, he certainly thought that the two gentlemen were quarrelling.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And thus public opinion which at first had been dead against the
  Australian Captain now went equally dead against Henry Buckley. Ugly stories
  were current of his extravagance, his gambling debts, his addiction to drink.
  People who knew him remembered one or two ugly pages in his life&rsquo;s
  history: altercations with the police, raids on gambling clubs of which he
  was a prominent member; there was even a fraudulent bankruptcy which had
  been the original cause of his being sent out to Australia by his harassed
  parents until the worst of the clouds had rolled by.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The only thing that told in his favour, as far as the public was
  concerned, was the bitter vindictiveness displayed against him by Miss Shillington.
  That the girl had cause for bitterness was not to be denied. For a time,
  at any rate, public opinion had branded her brother as a common trickster
  and a thief, and she and her mother had no doubt suffered terribly under
  the stigma; in consequence of this, Mrs. Shillington&rsquo;s health, always
  in a precarious state, had completely broken down and the old lady had taken
  to her bed, not suffering from any particular disease, but just from debility
  of mind and body, obstinately refusing to see a doctor, declaring that nothing
  would cure her except the return of her son.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And on the top of all that came the growing conviction that the son
  never would return and that he had been foully murdered for the sake of Lady
  Angela&rsquo;s pearls, which he so foolishly was carrying in his pocket that
  night. No wonder then, that his sister Marion felt bitter against the people
  who were the original cause of all these disasters; no wonder that she threw
  herself heart and soul into the search for evidence against the man whom
  she sincerely believed to be guilty of a most hideous crime.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It was mainly due to her that the police came on the track of William
  Rugger, the night-watchman, and through the latter that the driver of the
  taxi-cab was advertised for, because Rugger remembered seeing the gentleman
  alight from a taxi outside Mexfield House. But Miss Shillington&rsquo;s valuable
  assistance in the matter of investigation went even further than that. She
  at last prevailed upon the old man-servant at Mexfield House to come forward
  like a man and to speak the truth. He was a poor creature, not really old,
  probably not more than fifty, but timid and almost abject. He had at first
  declined to make any statement whatever, declaring that he had nothing to
  say. To every question put to him by the police he gave the one answer, &lsquo;I
  saw nothing, sir, I &rsquo;eard nothing. I went to bed as usual on the Friday
  night. The Captain &rsquo;e never expected me to sit up for &rsquo;im when &rsquo;e
  out to parties, and I never &rsquo;ear &rsquo;im come in, as I sleep at top
  of the &rsquo;ouse. No, sir, I didn&rsquo;t &rsquo;ear nothing that night.
  The last I seed of the Captain was at nine o&rsquo;clock when &rsquo;e got
  into the car and said good night to me.&rsquo; When he was shown the blood-stained
  hat, he burst out crying and said, &lsquo;Yes, sir! Yes, sir! That is the
  Captain&rsquo;s &rsquo;at. My Lord! What &rsquo;as come of &rsquo;im?&rsquo; He
  also failed to identify the scarf as being his master&rsquo;s property.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then one day Miss Shillington, still suffering from a cold in the
  head, but otherwise very business-like and brisk, arrived at Scotland Yard
  with the man&#8213; James Rose was his name&#8213; in tow. By what means
  she had persuaded him to speak the truth at last no one ever knew, but in
  a tremulous voice and shaken with nervousness, he did tell what he swore
  to be the truth. &lsquo;I must &rsquo;ave dropped to sleep in the dining-room,&rsquo; he
  said. &lsquo;I was very tired that evening, and I remember after I &rsquo;ad
  cleared supper away I just felt as &rsquo;ow I couldn&rsquo;t stand on my
  legs any longer, and I sat down in an armchair and must &rsquo;ave dozed
  off. What woke me was the front door bell which rings in the &rsquo;all as
  well as in the basement. I looked at the clock, it was past midnight. Captain
  forgot &rsquo;is key, that&rsquo;s what I thought. Lucky I &rsquo;adn&rsquo;t
  gone to bed, or I should never &rsquo;ave &rsquo;eard &rsquo;im. Funny &rsquo;is
  forgetting &rsquo;is key, I thought. Never done such a thing before, I thought,
  and went to open the door for &rsquo;im. But it wasn&rsquo;t the Captain,&rsquo; Rose
  went on, his voice getting more and more husky as no doubt he realised the
  deadly importance of what he was about to say. &lsquo;No, it wasn&rsquo;t
  the Captain,&rsquo; he reiterated, and shook his head in a doleful manner.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Who was it?&rsquo; the inspector demanded.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;The young gentleman who sometimes came to the &rsquo;ouse,&rsquo; Rose
  repeated under his breath. &ldquo;Mr. &rsquo;Enery Buckley it was, sir. Yes,
  Mr. &rsquo;Enery, that&rsquo;s &rsquo;oo it was.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;What did he say?&rsquo; Rose was asked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;&rsquo;E asked if the Captain was in, and I said no, not as
  I knew, but I would go and see. So up I went to the Captain&rsquo;s room
  and saw &rsquo;e wasn&rsquo;t there. Not yet. And I told Mr. &rsquo;Enery
  so when I came down again.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Then what happened?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Mr. &rsquo;Enery &rsquo;e told me that &rsquo;e wouldn&rsquo;t
  wait and that I was to tell the Captain &rsquo;e &rsquo;ad called, and that &rsquo;e
  would call again in &rsquo;arf an hour. I said that I was going to bed and
  I wouldn&rsquo;t probably see the Captain. &rsquo;E might be ever so late.
  Then Mr &rsquo;Enery &rsquo;e just said, &ldquo;Very good,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Never
  mind,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Good night, Rose,&rdquo; &rsquo;e said, and then
  I let &rsquo;im out.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Well, and what happened after that?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know, sir,&rsquo; the old man concluded. &lsquo;I
  went to bed and I never seed the Captain again, nor yet Mr. &rsquo;Enery&#8213; not
  from that day to this, sir. No, not again sir.&rsquo; And Rose once more
  shook his head in the same doleful manner. Of course the police were very
  down on him for keeping back this valuable piece of information, and they
  were even inclined to look with suspicion upon the man. They wanted to know
  something about his antecedents, and why he seemed so frightened of facing
  the police authorities. Fortunately for him, however. Miss Shillington could
  give them all the information they wanted. She said that James Rose had been
  for years in the service of a Mrs. O&rsquo;Shea who was a great friend of
  Mrs. Shillington&rsquo;s. When Mrs. O&rsquo;Shea died she left him a hundred
  pounds. But the poor thing had never been very strong and he was nothing
  to look at, he couldn&rsquo;t get another place, and the hundred pounds vanished
  bit by bit. About a month ago Mrs. Shillington, who was requiring a manservant,
  advertised for one in the <i>Daily Mail</i>. Rose answered the advertisement
  and though the poor thing in the meanwhile had gone terribly downhill physically,
  Mrs Shillington, who remembered how honest and respectable he had always
  been when he was in Mrs. O&rsquo;Shea&rsquo;s service, engaged him out of
  compassion for the sake of old times. Miss Shillington gave him a excellent
  character and the police were satisfied.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I think,&rdquo; the old Man in the Corner said, amorously contemplating
  a marvellously intricate knot which he had had just made in his bit of string, &ldquo;I
  think that the police were mainly satisfied because at last they felt that &lsquo;they
  had made out a case.&rsquo; From that moment the detectives and inspectors
  in charge became absolutely convinced that Henry Buckley had enticed Captain
  Denver Shillington to some place of ill fame close to the river and there,
  in collusion probably with other disreputable characters, had robbed and
  murdered him. To say the least, the case looked black enough against Buckley.
  His fast living, his mountain of debt, the absence in him of moral rectitude
  as proved by his fraudulent bankruptcy, told against him; and now it was
  definitely proved that he had sought out and actually been in the company
  of Captain Shillington the night that the latter disappeared. A light grey
  overcoat similar to the one described by Rugger and the chauffeur as worn
  by the gentleman who was loafing round Somerset Street was found to be a
  part of his wardrobe; no one could swear, however, as to the scarf, but it
  turned out that he never went out in the evening without wearing a large
  white carnation in his buttonhole.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The fact that he had not stated from the beginning that he had called
  at Mexfield House that night, and subsequently met the missing man and walked
  away with him, naturally told terribly against him. Obviously the man lost
  his head. Questioned by the police, he tried at first to deny the whole thing:
  he declared that the man with the white carnation and the light-coloured
  scarf was some other man whose name happened to be Henry, and he tried to
  upset Rose&rsquo;s evidence by declaring that the man lied and that he had
  never called at Mexfield House that night. But, unfortunately for him, he
  had taken a taxi from his club to the house, the taxi-driver was found, and
  the noose was further tightened round the Honourable Henry Buckley&rsquo;s
  neck. In vain did he assert after that that Denver Shillington had told him
  to call at Mexfield House at a quarter-past midnight on that fatal Friday.
  He was no longer believed. He admitted that he was in financial difficulties,
  and that he had spoken about these to Captain Shillington earlier in the
  evening. He admitted, tardily enough, that he went to Mexfield House hoping
  that Denver would give him some money in order to wipe out his most pressing
  debts. When he found that the Captain had not yet come home, he left a message
  with the manservant and thought he would go on to the club for a little while
  and return later to see Shillington. Unfortunately, he drank rather heavily
  whilst he was at the club and never thought any more about his money worries
  or about the Captain. In fact, he remembered nothing very clearly beyond
  the fact that he west home in the small hours and went straight to bed.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He then went on to say that he woke up the next morning with a splitting
  headache. It was pouring with rain and London was looking particularly beastly,
  as he picturesquely termed it. He recollected that his sister Angela had
  planned to go down with old Square-toes to some friends near Newmarket for
  the weekend. He, too, had been asked but had declined the invitation, but
  now he began to wish he hadn&rsquo;t; while he was out of town money-lenders
  couldn&rsquo;t dun him, and a breath of country air would certainly do him
  good.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And he was just cogitating over these matters at eight a.m. on that
  Saturday morning when his sister Angela came into his room. &lsquo;She told
  me,&rsquo; he went on, &lsquo;that old Square-toes was unable to accompany
  her to these friends in Cambridgeshire, that she didn&rsquo;t want to go
  alone, and would I hire a car and drive her down. She offered to pay for
  the car, and, as the scheme happened to suit me, I agreed. We drove down
  to Tatchford, and on the Tuesday I had an unpleasant reminder from one of
  my creditors and thought that I must get back to see what old Square-toes
  would do for me. I got home that game evening, and the next morning early
  Miss Shillington rang me up and told me over the &rsquo;phone that they had
  heard nothing of Captain Shillington since the previous Friday and that they
  were getting anxious. And that&rsquo;s all I know.&rdquo; he concluded. &lsquo;I
  swear that I never set eyes on Shillington after he drove off from the Duchess
  of Flint&rsquo;s with my sister in his car. I did call at Mexfield House,
  but it was at Shillington&rsquo;s suggestion, but when the man told me that
  the Captain was not yet home, I did not loaf about the street, I went straight
  back to the club and then home.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of course all this was very clear and very categorical but there
  were one or two doubtful points in Buckley&rsquo;s statements, which the
  police&#8213; dead out now to prove him guilty of murder&#8213; made the
  most of. Firstly, there was his former denial on oath that he had not called
  at Mexfield House that night. It was only when he was confronted with the
  testimony of the taxi-cab driver that he made the admission. The employees
  at his club, which, by the way, was in Hanover Square, had seen him come
  in at about half-past eleven. He went out again twenty minutes later and
  the hall-porter saw him hail a taxi-cab. He was once more in the club at
  half past twelve, and it is a significant fact that two of the young members
  chaffed him subsequently because he had not usual white carnation in his
  buttonhole.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then again it was more than strange that on the Friday he was so
  worried about his debts that he went in the middle of the night to his friend&rsquo;s
  house in order to try and borrow money from him, and yet when according to
  his own statements he never even saw his friend, off he went the very next
  morning to the country, stayed away four days, and on his return did not
  make any attempt seemingly to see the Captain or to ask him for money. Thirdly,
  it was equally inconceivable that Captain Shillington should have appointed
  to see Buckley at that hour of the night, however pressed the latter might
  have been for money. Why should he? The next morning would have done just
  as well, whether he meant to help him or whether he did not, and, according
  to the testimony of the night-watchman, William Rugger, when he was accosted
  by Buckley, he exclaimed in tones of great surprise, &lsquo;Good Lord, Henry,
  what are you doing here?&rsquo; These are not words which a man would say
  to a friend whom he had appointed to meet at this very hour.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;However, this portion of the taxi-driver&rsquo;s and Rugger&rsquo;s
  testimony Buckley still strenuously denied. He could deny the other. He had
  called at Mexfield House and reluctantly admitted that it had been nothing
  but &lsquo;blue funk&rsquo; that had prompted him at first to hold his tongue
  about that and then to deny the fact altogether.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But, above all, there was yet another fact which to the police was
  more conclusive, more damning than any other, and that was that on the Wednesday
  morning the Honourable Henry Buckley had called at Messrs. Foster and Turnbull,
  the well-known pawnbrokers of Oxford Street, and had pledged a pair of diamond
  ear-rings and a couple of valuable bracelets there for which he received
  three hundred and fifty pounds.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Here again, if Buckley had volunteered this statement, all might
  have been well, but it was the pawnbrokers who gave information to the police.
  It turned out that the ear-rings and the two bracelets were the property
  of his sister, Lady Angela. Buckley declared that she had given them to him
  and she, very nobly, did her best to corroborate this statement of his, but
  it had become impossible to believe a word he said. Lady Angela&rsquo;s valiant
  efforts on his behalf were thought to be unconvincing, and, as a matter of
  fact, the public has never known from that day to this whether Henry Buckley
  stole his sister&rsquo;s jewellery or whether she gave them to him voluntarily.&rdquo;</p>
  <h3 align="center">3</h3>
  <p>&ldquo;Mind you, there can be no question but that the police acted very
  injudiciously when they actually preferred a charge of murder against Henry
  Buckley. There were two such damning flaws in the chain of evidence that
  had been collected against him that the man ought never to have been arrested.
  Even the magistrate was of that opinion. As you know, if there is the slightest
  doubt about such a serious charge, the magistrates will always commit a man
  for trial and let a jury of twelve men pronounce on the final issue rather
  than decide such grave matters on their own. But in this case there were
  really no proofs. There were deductions; the accused was a young blackguard,
  a moral coward and a liar. There was the blood-stained scarf, the hat and
  the white carnation, there was the testimony of the taxi-driver and the night-watchman
  that Henry Buckley had been in the company of Captain Shillington that night,
  but there was no proof that he had murdered his friend and stolen the pearls.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;To begin with, if there had been a murder, where was it committed,
  and what became of Captain Shillington&rsquo;s body? Of course, the police
  still hope to find traces of it, but, as you know, they have not yet succeeded.
  Various theories are put forward that Henry Buckley was member of a gang
  of ruffians with headquarters in some obscure corner of London close to the
  river, and that he enticed the Captain there and murdered him with the help
  of his criminal associates with whom he probably shared the proceeds of the
  crime. But over a year has gone by since Shillington disappeared and the
  police are no nearer finding the body of the missing man.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The magistrate dismissed the case against Henry Buckley. There was
  not sufficient evidence to commit him for trial. What told most in his favour
  in the end was the question of time. He was able to prove that he was at
  his club in Hanover Square at half-past midnight on the fateful night. Now
  according to James Rose&rsquo;s testimony, it was after midnight when he,
  Buckley, called at Mexfield House. Even supposing that Shillington had arrived
  in the taxi five minutes later, it was inconceivable that a man could entice
  another to an out-of-the-way part of London, murder him&#8213; even if he
  left others to dispose of the body&#8213; and walk back unconcernedly to
  Hanover Square, all in less than half an hour. Nor were the pearls or any
  large sum of money ever traced to Henry Buckley. He was just as deeply in
  debt after the disappearance of Captain Shillington as he had been before.
  Now he has gone on another tour round the world, and the Shillingtons&#8213; mother
  and daughter&#8213; have given up all hopes of ever seeing the gallant Captain,
  who was such a model son, again. A little while ago the illustrated papers
  published photos of the two ladies on board a P. &amp; O steamer bound for
  Australia, but the public had forgotten all about Lady Angela&rsquo;s pearls
  and the mysterious white carnation. No one was interested in the old lady
  with the white hair and stooping figure who was carried on board in a chair,
  and who obstinately refused to be interviewed by newspaper men eager for
  copy. The case is relegated, as far as the public is concerned, to the category
  of undiscovered crimes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; I argued, as the Man in the Corner became silent, absorbed
  in the untying of an intricate knot which had made a little while ago, &ldquo;surely
  the police have found out who the man was who accosted Captain Shillington
  in Somerset Street that night, the man with the light-coloured scarf which
  was subsequently found in the river by the side of the missing man&rsquo;s
  hat, the man who called the Captain &lsquo;Denver,&rsquo; and whom the latter
  called &lsquo;Henry&rsquo; and was so surprised to see. If it was not Henry
  Buckley, who was it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; the exasperating creature retorted with a fatuous smile, &ldquo;who
  was it? That&rsquo;s just the point&#8213; a point just as dark as that a
  man like Captain Shillington could be enticed at that hour of the night to
  an out-of-the-way part of London, and at a moment when he had his fiancee&rsquo;s
  jewellery worth twenty-five thousand pounds in his pocket. Don&rsquo;t you
  think that that point is absolutely inconceivable?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;it does seem&#8213;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of course it does,&rdquo; he broke in eagerly. &ldquo;I ask you:
  is it likely? At one moment we are told that Captain Shillington was a pattern
  of all the virtues and that his business acumen and abilities had earned
  for him not only a fortune but the admiration of all those who knew him;
  and the very next we are asked to suppose that he would meekly allow a young
  blackguard whom he knew to be dishonest and unscrupulous to drag him &lsquo;reluctantly&rsquo; to
  some obscure haunt of a gang of criminals. Surely that should have jumped
  to the eyes of my sane person who had studied the case.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t suppose,&rdquo; I retorted, &ldquo;that Captain Shillington
  allowed Buckley to drag him very far. Most people believed at the time that
  he was attacked directly he rounded the corner of Somerset Street. There
  are one or two entrances to mews just about there&#8213;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; the funny creature rejoined excitedly, &ldquo;but not
  one nearer than fifty yards from Mexfield House. And do you think that the
  immaculate Australian would have walked ten yards at night with young Buckley
  and with those pearls in his pocket? Why should he? He was outside his own
  door. Wouldn&rsquo;t he have taken Henry into the house with him if he wished
  to speak to him? No! No! The whole theory is inconceivable....&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But Captain Shillington disappeared,&rdquo; I argued, &ldquo;and
  so did the pearls, and his hat was found floating in the river, torn and
  blood-stained. You cannot deny that.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I certainly cannot deny,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;that a blood-stained
  hat will float on the water if it is thrown-say from a convenient bridge.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But the scarf?&rdquo; I retorted.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A scarf will obey the same laws of Nature as a hat.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But surely you are not going to tell me&#8213;?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That the whole thing was a confidence trick, after all?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I am certain that it was. A clever one, I&rsquo;ll admit, and even
  I was puzzled at the time. I couldn&rsquo;t think who &lsquo;Henry&rsquo; could
  possibly be. It wasn&rsquo;t young Buckley, that was obvious. The alibi was
  conclusive as to that; the miscreants who had planned to throw dust in the
  eyes of the police by trying to fasten a hideous crime on that unfortunate
  young Buckley set their stage rather too elaborately when they devised the
  trick about the scarf. By identifying the murderer with the wearer of the scarf,
  they saved Buckley from the gallows; without it, there might have remained
  some doubt in the minds of some of the jury. But, of course, it raised a
  tremendous puzzle. Who was the &lsquo;Henry&rsquo; of Somerset Street? And
  was it not a curious coincidence that he should be wearing an overcoat similar
  to the one habitually worn by Henry Buckley and a white carnation which many
  friends would at once associate with that unfortunate young man? From the
  examination of the puzzle to its solution was but a step. I came at once
  to the conclusion that here was no coincidence but a deliberate attempt to
  impersonate Henry Buckley, the man most likely in the eyes of the public
  to waylay, and even murder a man whom he knew to be in possession of valuable
  jewellery. Such a deliberate attempt, therefore, argued that Captain Shillington
  himself must have been in it.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Good Lord, Henry, what in the world are you doing here?&rsquo; was
  obviously intended for any passer-by to hear in the in way that the white
  carnation was intended for any chance passer-by to pick up. Having established
  the <i>mise en sc&egrave;ne</i> the two scoundrels walked off, having previously
  provided themselves with a blood-stained hat which presently Miss Shillington
  would identify as the property of her brother.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Miss Shillington?&rdquo; I broke in eagerly, &ldquo;then you think
  that the whole Australian family was in the conspiracy? And what about the
  man Rose?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The whole family,&rdquo; he rejoined, &ldquo;only consisted of two.
  Man and wife most likely.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But the man Rose?&rdquo; I insisted.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;An excellent part, alternately played with remarkable skill by the
  Captain and his female accomplice.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do reconstruct the whole thing for me,&rdquo; I pleaded. &ldquo;I
  own that I am bewildered.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And from my bag I extracted a brand-new piece of string which I handed to
  him with an engaging smile. Nothing could have pleased the fatuous creature
  more. With long, claw-like fingers twiddling the string, he began leisurely:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nothing could be more simple. Captain Shillington takes leave of
  his fiancee, having the pearls in his pocket. It is then about half-past
  eleven. Henry Buckley has gone to his club, Shillington having appointed
  to see him at Mexfield House soon after midnight. There is, therefore, plenty
  of time. Shillington hurries home, changes his personality into that of James
  Rose, as he often has done before, and subsequently interviews Henry Buckley
  on the doorstep. You can see that, can&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Easily,&rdquo; I replied.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then as soon as he has got rid of Buckley, our friend the Captain
  quits the personality of a snuffy, middle-aged manservant, and becomes himself
  once more. He goes back to the neighbourhood of Mayfair, hails a taxi and
  drives to Mexfield House. But in the meanwhile the female confederate&#8213; we&rsquo;ll
  call her Miss Shillington for convenience sake&#8213; in male attire and
  evening-dress, wearing a light overcoat, a light-coloured scarf and a white
  carnation in her buttonhole, lounges under a doorway in Somerset Street,
  waiting to play her part. Now do you see how simple it all is?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Perfectly,&rdquo; I admitted. &ldquo;As you said before, they had
  provided themselves with a blood-stained hat which presently they threw into
  the river, together with the scarf; and what happened after that?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;They walked home quietly and went to bed.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What? Both of them?... But the mother?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe in the mother,&rdquo; he retorted blandly. &ldquo;Do
  you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I thought&#8213;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She takes to her bed&#8213; she never sees a doctor&#8213; she and
  her daughter never see anyone&#8213; they have no friends&#8213; no servants
  save the man Rose; put two and two together, my dear,&rdquo; the funny old
  man concluded as he slipped the piece of string in his pocket. &ldquo;Captain
  Shillington was the only one in that house who ever went outside the doors.
  The mother never did&#8213; no one ever saw her&#8213; the daughter had a
  perpetual cold in the head&#8213; the man Rose had no one to speak for him,
  no one to relate his past history, except Miss Shillington. Where is he now?
  What has become of him? There&rsquo;s nobody to enquire after him, so the
  police don&rsquo;t trouble. The two Shillingtons&#8213; supposed to be mother
  and daughter&#8213; went back to Australia last year, but not the man Rose.
  Then, where is he? But I say that the two passengers on board that P &amp; O
  boat were not mother and daughter, but male and female confederates in as
  fine a bit of rascality as I&rsquo;ve ever seen. And the man Rose never existed.
  He was just a disguise assumed from time to time by Captain Shillington.
  It is not difficult, you know, to assume a personality of that sort. The
  police inspectors who questioned him had never seen Captain Shillington,
  and dirt and shabby clothes are very perfect disguises. Now the pair of them
  are knocking about the world somewhere, they will dispose of the pearls to
  continental dealers not over scrupulous where a good bargain can be struck.
  If you will just think of Captain Shillington impersonating James Rose and
  a decrepit old woman alternately and of Miss Shillington impersonating Henry
  Buckley on that one occasion you will see how conclusive are my deductions.
  I have a snapshot here of the two Australian &lsquo;ladies&rsquo; taken on
  board the boat. This muffled-up bundle of bonnet and shawl is supposed to
  be Mrs. Shillington; it might as well be M. Poincare or the Kaiser, don&rsquo;t
  you think? And here is a snapshot of James Rose giving evidence in the magistrate&rsquo;s
  court. Unfortunately I have no photo of Captain Shillington or I could have
  shown you just how to trace the personality of the handsome young man about
  town under that of the snuffy, dirty, ill-kempt, unwashed and badly clothed,
  stooping figure of an out-at-elbows servant.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He threw a bundle of newspaper cuttings down on the table. I gazed at them
  still puzzled, but nevertheless convinced that he was right. When I looked
  up again, I only saw a corner of his shabby checked ulster disappearing through
  the swing-doors.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="TheMysteryOfTheMontmartreHat"></a>The Mystery Of The Montmartre Hat</b> </h2>
  <h3 align="center"><b>1</b></h3>
  <p>&ldquo;It was during a foggy, rainy night in November a couple of years
  ago,&rdquo; the Man in the Corner said to me that day, &ldquo;that the inhabitants
  of Wicklow Lane, Southwark, were startled by a terrible row proceeding from
  one of the houses down the street. There was a lot of shouting and banging,
  then a couple of pistol shots, after that nothing more. It was then just
  after midnight. The dwellers in Wicklow Lane are all of them poor, they are
  all of them worried with the cares of large families, small accommodation,
  and irregular work, all of which we must take it make for indifference to
  other people&rsquo;s worries, and, above all, to other people&rsquo;s quarrels.
  Rows were not an unknown occurrence in Wicklow Lane, not always perhaps at
  dead of night and not necessarily accompanied by pistol shots, but nevertheless
  sufficiently frequent not to arouse more than passing interest. Half a dozen
  tousled heads&#8213; no more&#8213; were thrust out of the windows to ascertain
  what this particular row was about; but as everything was quiet again, as
  no police was in sight to whom one might give directions, and the mixture
  of rain and fog was particularly unpleasant, the tousled heads after a few
  minutes disappeared again, and once more peace reigned in Wicklow Lane.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of course the next morning the event of the night was mentioned and
  mildly discussed, both by the men whilst going to their work and by the ladies
  whilst scrubbing their door steps. Everyone agreed that the pistol shots
  were fired soon after midnight, but no one seemed to be very clear in which
  particular house the row had occurred. Two or three of the people who lived
  in No 11 and No. 15 respectively would have it that it occurred &lsquo;next
  door,&rsquo; but as the house next door to them both could only be the one
  between them, namely No. 13, and as No. 13 had been empty for months, this
  testimony was at first strongly discounted.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Presently, however, a helmeted and blue-coated representative of
  the law came striding leisurely down the Lane, Within a minute or two he
  was surrounded by a number of excited ladies, all eager to give him their
  own version of the affair. You can see him, can&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; the Man
  in the Corner went on with a grin, &ldquo;stalking up the street, his thumbs
  thrust into his belt, his face wearing that marvellous look of impassivity
  peculiar to the force, and followed by this retinue of gesticulating ladies,
  dressed in what they happened to have picked up in neighbouring &lsquo;ole
  clo&rsquo; shops, and by a sprinkling of callow youths and unkempt, unshaven
  men. You can see him solemnly plying the knocker on the dilapidated front
  door of No. 13, while for the space of a minute or two the gesticulating
  ladies, the youths and the men were silent and motionless. But not a sound
  came in response to the Bobby&rsquo;s vigorous knocking. The house was silent
  as the grave; just above the front door a weather-worn board, swaying and
  creaking in the wind, mutely gave it out that the lease of these desirable
  premises was to be sold and that the key could be had on application to Messrs.
  J. Whiskin and Sons, of Newnham Road, S.E. The ladies, with cheeks blanched
  under the grime, looked aghast at one another; the youths tittered nervously,
  the men swore. No one appeared altogether displeased. Here was a real excitement
  at last to vary the monotony of life, something that would keep gossip alive
  at the &lsquo;White Lion&rsquo; for many a day to come. The majestic representative
  of the law then blew his whistle. This broke the spell of silence and voluble
  tongues started wagging again. Soon the second representative of the law
  appeared, as ponderous, as impassive as his mate. He was quickly put in possession
  of all the known and unknown facts connected with the mysterious occurrence.
  Leaving his mate in charge, he stalked off to get assistance.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, you remember no doubt what happened after that. A police inspector
  called straightway on Messrs. Whiskin and Sons and elicited from them the
  information that effectively No. 13 Wicklow Lane was for sale, had been for
  some time, and that on the previous morning&#8213; it was, of course, Thursday&#8213; a
  well-dressed gentleman had called to make enquiries about the house. Young
  Mr. Whiskin gave him the key and asked him to be sure and return it before
  1 pm as the office closed early on Thursdays. Well, the gentleman hadn&rsquo;t
  come back yet with the key, but Mr. Whiskin was not troubling much about
  that, there being nothing in the house&#8213; nor for a matter of that in
  the street&#8213; likely to tempt a thief. Young Mr. Whiskin thought that
  he would be able to identify the gentleman if he saw him again. He had rather
  a red face and a thick nose which suggested that he was accustomed to good
  living, rough ginger-coloured hair, and a straggly ginger beard and walrus
  moustache, all of which gave him rather a peculiar appearance. He wore a
  neat brown lounge suit, a light overcoat, and grey Homburg hat, and he was
  carrying a large parcel under his arm. Mr. Whiskin added that he had never
  seen the man before or since.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;As soon as these facts became known there was more voluntary information
  forthcoming. It appears that one or two of the residents in Wicklow Lane
  remembered seeing a man in light overcoat and soft grey hat, and carrying
  a parcel under his arm, enter No. 13 with a latch-key. No one had taken &lsquo;pertikler
  notice,&rsquo; however, chiefly because the occurrence was not an unusual
  one. Often people would go in to look at the empty house and come out again
  after inspection. Unfortunately, too, because of this there was distinct
  confusion of evidence, some witnesses declaring that the man carried a large
  parcel and that he went away again, but not until the evening; others would
  have it that he had a very small parcel and that he wore a bowler hat; others
  that the man with the bowler hat was another person altogether and did not
  call till the evening, whilst this again was contradicted by another witness
  who said that the man who called in the evening had very conspicuous ginger-coloured
  hair and beard, but that he certainly wore a bowler hat. And through this
  mass of conflicting evidence there was always the fact that the fog was very
  thick that night and that no one therefore was able to swear very positively
  to anything.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;This, then, being all the information that could be gathered for
  the moment from the outside, the police next decided to force an entry into
  the empty house. Its unlucky number justified, as you know, its sinister
  reputation, because the first sight that greeted the inspector when he entered
  the front room on the ground floor was the body of a man lying in a pool
  of blood. At first glance he looked like a foreigner&#8213; youngish, and
  with jet-black hair and moustache. By side of him there was a damp towel,
  also stained with blood. Closer examination revealed the fact that he was
  not dead, but he seemed in a dead faint, and the inspector sent one of the
  men off at once to telephone for the divisional surgeon.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The wounded man was dressed in a dark suit. He had on a gold watch
  of foreign make, twenty pounds in notes and some loose silver in his pockets,
  and a letter addressed to &lsquo;Allen Lloyd, Esq.&rsquo; at an hotel at
  Boulogne. The letter was a private one relating unimportant family events;
  it was signed by a Christian name only, and bore a London postmark but no
  address. The police inspector took charge of the letters and the money, and
  as the divisional surgeon had now arrived and was busy with the wounded man,
  he proceeded to examine the premises.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The houses in Wicklow Lane all have small yards at the back. These
  yards end in a brick wall, the other side of which there is a railway cutting.
  It was obvious that No. 13 had been untenanted for some time. The dust of
  ages lay over window and door frames, over broken mantelpieces and dilapidated
  stoves. There was not a stick of anything anywhere; even the rubbish in the
  basement&#8213; such as is found in every empty house, residue left over
  by the last tenant&#8213; had been picked over until there was nothing left
  but dust and a few empty bottles.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The front room in which the wounded man lay revealed very little.
  Two bullets were found lodged in one of the walls; one, quite close to the
  ceiling, suggesting that it had been fired in the air, and the other at a
  height of seven feet from the ground. The dust on the floor had certainly
  been disturbed, but by how many pairs of feet it was impossible say. On the
  other hand, the back room on the same floor had quite a grim tale to tell.
  It gave on the small backyard with the wall as a background, beyond which
  was the railway cutting. The window in this room was open. In one corner
  there was an ordinary sink which showed that water had been running from
  the tap quite recently; there was a small piece of soap in the sink which
  had also recently been used. On the mantelpiece a small oak-framed mirror
  was propped up against the wall and beside it on the shelf there was the
  remnant of a burnt-out candle and a box of matches, half empty. And thrown
  down on the floor, in a corner of the room, were a black Inverness cape and
  soft black hat with a very wide brim, such as are usually affected by French
  students.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It was, of course, difficult to reconstruct the assault just at present,
  the wounded man being still in a state of stupor and unable to give any account
  of himself, but the revolver was found lying at the bottom of the yard close
  to the end wall.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In the meanwhile the divisional surgeon had concluded his examination.
  He pronounced the wound to have been caused by one of the bullets that had
  lodged in the wall of the front room. It had been fired at very close range,
  as the flesh was singed all round the wound. The bullet had gone right through
  the left deltoid, front to back and slightly upwards, just grazed the top
  of the shoulder and then lodged in the wall. The surgeon was inclined to
  think that the wound was self-inflicted, but this theory was thought to be
  untenable, because if a man was such an obviously poor shot he would surely
  have chosen some other way of putting an end to himself, unless, indeed,
  he was a lunatic, which might account for any incongruity in the known facts,
  even to the noise&#8213; the shouting and the banging&#8213; that all the
  neighbours agreed had preceded the revolver shots.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But there certainly was one fact which discounted the attempted suicide
  theory and that was the undoubted presence of another man upon the scene&#8213; the
  man with the ginger hair and the thick nose who had called for the key at Messrs.
  Whiskin and Sons, and whom several witnesses had actually seen entering the
  empty house&#8213; the man with the parcel. Now no one
  saw him come out again by the front door. He must have been in the house
  when the foreigner with the jet-black hair came and joined him, and he must
  have slipped out later on in the dark, under cover of the fog and rain, either
  by the front door when nobody happened to be passing by, or over the wall
  and then by the railway cutting. Now what had brought these two men together
  in an empty house, in one of the worst slums in London? One man was wounded;
  where was the other? Had the revolver been dropped by one of them in his
  flight or flung out of the window by a lunatic? Was it attempted suicide
  by a madman or murder consequent on a quarrel, or blackmail? None of these
  questions was ever answered, nor was the man with the ginger-coloured hair
  ever found. There was absolutely no clue by which he might be traced; the
  earth just swallowed him up as if he had been a spook.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nor was the identity of the wounded man ever satisfactorily established.
  Who he was, where he came from, who were his associates and what were his
  antecedents, he never revealed. He was detained in hospital for a time as
  he certainly was suffering from loss of memory. But presently they had to
  let him go. He had money and he was otherwise perfectly sane, but to every
  question put to him he only answered &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know! I can&rsquo;t
  remember!&rsquo; He spoke English without the slightest trace of foreign
  accent; all that was foreign about him was his jet-black hair and beard.
  Nor was the history of the revolver ever traced to its source. Where was
  it bought? To whom was it sold, and by whom? Nobody ever knew.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But where did the man go after he left the hospital?&rdquo; I now
  asked, seeing that the funny creature looked like curling himself up in his
  corner and going to sleep. &ldquo;Surely he was kept under observation when
  they let him out!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of course he was,&rdquo; he replied glibly, &ldquo;and for some time
  after that.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then where did he go,&rdquo; I reiterated impatiently, &ldquo;when
  he was discharged from hospital?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He asked the way to the nearest public library and went straight
  there; he looked down the columns of the Morning Post, scribbled a few addresses
  on a scrap of paper, then took a taxi and drove to one of the private hotels
  in Mexborough Gate, where he engaged a room, paying a fortnight&rsquo;s board
  and lodging in advance. Here he lived for some considerable time. He was
  always plentifully supplied with money, he bought himself clothes and linen,
  but where he got the money from was never discovered. For a time he was watched
  both by the police and by amateur detectives eager for copy, but nothing
  was ever discovered that would clear up the mystery. From time to time letters
  came for him at the hotel in Mexborough Gate. They were addressed to Allen
  Lloyd, Esq., which may or may not have been a taken-up name. Presumably these
  letters contained remittances in cash. They were never traced to their source.
  Anyway he always paid his weekly bills at the hotel, but he never spoke to
  anyone in the place, nor, as far as could be ascertained,did he ever meet
  anyone or enter any house except the one he lodged in.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then one fine day he left the hotel, never to return. He went out
  one afternoon and nothing has been seen or heard of him from that day to
  this. The mysterious Mr. Allen Lloyd has disappeared in the whirlpool of
  London, leaving no trace of his identity. He had paid his bill at the hotel
  that very day. He left no debts and just a very few personal belongings behind.
  To all intents and purposes the matter was relegated in the public mind to
  the category of unsolved and unsolvable mysteries.&rdquo;</p>
  <h3 align="center"><b>2</b></h3>
  <p>The Man in the Corner had paused. From the capacious pocket of his tweed
  ulster he now extracted a thick piece of string; his claw-like fingers set
  to work. The problem which the police and public had never been able to solve
  had, I had no doubt, presented few difficulties to his agile brain.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Tell me,&rdquo; I suggested.</p>
  <p>He went on working away for a little while at an intricate knot, then he
  said: &ldquo;If you want to know more, you will have to listen to what will
  seem to you an irrelevant story.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I professed my willingness to listen to anything he might choose to tell
  me.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Very well, then,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Let me take your mind back
  to that same winter two years ago. Do you remember the extraordinary theft
  of a valuable collection of gems, the property of Sir James Narford?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I do.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do you know who Sir James Narford was?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I would prefer you to tell me,&rdquo; I replied.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Sir James Narford,&rdquo; the funny creature went on glibly, &ldquo;was
  a young gentleman who had been employed during the war in one of the Government
  departments; he was the only son of his father who was an impoverished Irish
  baronet. Soon after the Armistice Sir James went to South America to visit
  some relations. He must have made a very favourable impression on one of
  these&#8213; an eccentric old cousin who died a very few months later and
  left to his English relative a marvellous collection of pearls and other
  gems. Some of these were of priceless value, and as is the way with anything
  that is out of the common, all sorts of stories grew around the romantic
  legacy. The great worth and marvellous beauty of the jewels were told and
  retold, with many embellishment no doubt, in the English papers. It was asserted
  that the Brazilian Government had valued them for probate at a million pounds
  sterling; that there were diamonds&#8213; some still uncut&#8213; that would
  make the Koh-i-noor or the Orloff look like small bits of glass, and so on.
  I daresay you can remember some of the legends that gathered around Sir James
  Narford&rsquo;s gems. By the time the lucky owner of the fabulous treasure,
  who had gone out again to Brazil in order to fetch away his jewels, had returned
  to England, he was the object of universal interest, and he and his gems
  were photographed and paragraphed all over the place.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But as I told you, the recipient of this princely legacy had always
  been a poor man. We may take it that the payment of legacy duty on forty
  thousand pounds&rsquo; worth of gems had impoverished him still further.
  Busybodies, of course tried to persuade him to sell the gems; he had numberless
  letters from diamond and pearl merchants, asking for permission to see them
  with a view to purchase, but, naturally enough, he didn&rsquo;t want to do
  anything in a hurry; he deposited his treasure at the bank and then thought
  things over. He didn&rsquo;t want to sell for he was inordinately proud of
  his new possession and of the notoriety which it had conferred upon him.
  It was even rumoured that he had received more than one hint from fair lips
  that if he proposed marriage, the owner of such beautiful jewels would be
  certain of acceptance.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know who first suggested the idea to Sir James Narford
  that he should exhibit the gems for the benefit of disabled soldiers and
  sailors. It was a splendid idea; 2s. 6d. was to be charged for admission,
  and, after deducting expenses of rent and attendants, the profits were to
  go to that very laudable able charity. Suitable premises were secured in
  Sackville Street. These consisted of a shop with a large plate-glass front
  and a small room at the back; the entrance was through a front door and passage
  which were common to the rest of the house, and there were two doors in the
  passage, one of which gave into the shop and the other into the back room.
  Sir James spent a little money in getting up the place in modern style and
  he had some cases made for the display of the gems. The door which gave from
  the passage into the shop was condemned and a heavy piece of furniture placed
  against it. The back room was only to be used as an office and ante-room
  with communicating doors leading into the shop.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In the daytime the gems were displayed in glass cases ranged right
  and left of the shop; at night they were locked up in a safe which stood
  in the middle of the shop, facing the plate-glass window and with a blazing
  electric light kept on all night, just above the safe. This is a very usual
  device with jewellers in a smaller way of business. The policeman on night
  duty can see at once if there is anything wrong.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Everything being ready. Sir James Narford asked a distinguished lady
  friend of his to declare the show open, and for the first fortnight&#8213; this,
  I must tell you, was in October&#8213; there was a steady stream of visitors,
  ladies for the most part, who came to gaze on the much-advertised gems. You
  might wonder what pleasure there could be in looking at things one could
  never hope to possess, especially at loose gems, however precious, which
  to my mind only become beautiful when they are mounted and set in artistic
  designs. However, I do not profess to understand feminine mentality; all
  I know is that Sir James Narford declared himself on more than one occasion
  satisfied with the result of his little venture.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;True that after the first fortnight the attendance at the show fell
  off considerably, and a few people did wonder why Sir James should continue
  to keep it open for so long. Those who had been most curious to see the gems
  of fabulous value had flocked in the first few days, after that there was
  only a very thin sprinkling of people up from the country, or foreigners
  who paid their 2s. 6d. admission for the sight. But be that as it may, the
  jewels were certainly getting an additional amount of advertisement, and
  when presently the owner would put them up for sale, as no doubt he intended
  to do, they would fetch a higher figure in consequence. In the meantime Sir
  James went on living very quietly in a small service flat in George Street,
  waited on by a faithful servant, a man named Ruggles whom he had known for
  years. Every day he would stroll round to Sackville Street to look at his
  treasure and to talk to one or two friends. At six o&rsquo;clock the exhibition
  would be closed and Sir James would himself deposit all the gems into the
  safe, lock up the premises, and take the key back with him to his flat. He
  went out very little in society and only occasionally to his club. His one
  extravagance appeared to be a mania for travelling in all sorts of out-of-the-way
  places; he had been seemingly in every corner of Europe&#8213; in Czecho-Slovakia
  and Yugo-Slavia, in Montenegro, Bosnia and Bessarabia. Before this whenever
  he went off on his travels he would take his man with him and shut up the
  flat, but on the occasion which presently arose he left Ruggles in charge
  of the exhibition in Sackville Street. This was early in November, about
  a fortnight after the opening of the exhibition; and when Sir James had gone
  it was Ruggles who, every night at six o&rsquo;clock, put the gems away in
  the safe and locked up the premises. He then made a point of going for a
  brisk walk and returned to the flat at about half-past seven, had his supper,
  read his paper, and then went to bed at about ten o&rsquo;clock with the
  keys of the safe and of the Sackville Street premises underneath his pillow.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;One of the staff in the flats at George Street always got his supper
  ready for him&#8213; some cold meat, bread and cheese and half a pint of
  beer, which the lift-boy invariably fetched for him from the Crown and Sceptre
  round the corner. He prepared his own breakfast in the morning and his other
  meals he took in Sackville Street. They were sent in from one of the cheaper
  restaurants in Piccadilly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Every morning the charwoman who cleaned the steps outside the block
  of flats in George Street would see Ruggles come out of the house and walk
  away in the direction of Sackville Street. Even on Sundays he would stroll
  round as far as the shop to see that everything was all right.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It was on a snowy morning in January that the charwoman failed to
  see Ruggles at his accustomed time. As the quiet neighbourhood did not as
  a rule lend itself much to gossip, the present opportunity was not to be
  missed. The charwoman, on meeting with the lift-boy, imparted to him the
  priceless news that Mr. Ruggles must either be ill or had gone and overslept
  himself. Whereupon the lift-boy was ready with the startling information
  that he had just observed that one of the glass panels in the front door
  of Sir James Narford&rsquo;s flat was broken. &lsquo;The glass wasn&rsquo;t
  broken in the evening, ten-thirty,&rsquo; he went on to say, &lsquo;when
  I took a party down who&rsquo;d been visitin&rsquo; Miss Jenkins.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It seems that Miss Jenkins was maid to a lady who had a flat on the
  same floor as Sir James Narford. But there was the length of a passage with
  staircase and lift between the two flats, and neither the lady nor the maid,
  when spoken to by the lift-boy about the broken glass panel, had heard anything
  during the night. Now all this seemed very strange, more especially as the
  morning hours wore on and there was still no sign of Mr. Ruggles. The lift-boy
  was kept busy for the next hour taking the staff of the service flats up
  and down in his lift, as everyone wished to have a look at the broken panel
  and wanted to add their quota of opinion as to what had gone on last night
  in Sir James Narford&rsquo;s flat. At ten o&rsquo;clock the housekeeper,
  more responsible or more enterprising than the rest of the staff, resolved
  to knock at the flat door. No answer came. She then tried to peep through
  the broken glass panel and to apply her ear to it. For a time all was silence.
  The charwoman, the lift-boy, the scullery-maid and the head housemaid stood
  by on the landing, holding their breath. Suddenly they all gave a simultaneous
  gasp! A groan&#8213; distinctly a groan&#8213; was heard issuing from inside
  the flat! The group of watchers looked at one another in dismay. &lsquo;What&rsquo;s
  to be done?&rsquo; they murmured.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The lift-boy had the key of the flat, but as the front door was bolted
  on the inside, the key in itself was no use. The housekeeper, with the air
  of a general in command about to order a deathly charge, said resolutely, &lsquo;I
  shall force my way in!&rsquo; And it was the lift-boy who gasped, awe-stricken, &lsquo;You
  kin put your &rsquo;and through the broken panel, mum, and pull the bolt.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Somehow this bright idea which had occurred to the lift-boy made
  everyone there feel still more uncomfortable. The housekeeper, who had been
  so bold a while ago, stammered something about fetching the police, and when
  at the precise moment the lift-bell rang, the head housemaid declared herself
  ready to faint. But it was only Sir James Narford who had rung for the lift
  from below. He had arrived by the night mail from Paris, and had only his
  small suit-case with him. The lift-boy had the satisfaction of being the
  first to impart the exciting news to him. &lsquo;&rsquo;E took it badly, &rsquo;e
  did!&rsquo; was that young gentleman&rsquo;s comment on Sir James&rsquo;s
  reception of the news. Without taking the slightest notice of the group of
  excited women on the landing, Sir James went straight to his front door,
  thrust his hand through the broken panel, drew back the inside bolt and stepped
  into his flat. The next moment the agitated crowd on the landing heard him
  cry out, &lsquo;My God, Ruggles, what has happened?&rsquo; A feeble voice
  which was scarcely recognisable as that of Ruggles, was then heard talking
  in short, jerky sentences, and a few moments later Sir James&rsquo;s voice
  could be distinctly heard speaking on the telephone.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;He is telephoning for the police,&rsquo; the housekeeper solemnly
  announced to the staff.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; the Man in the Corner continued after awhile, &ldquo;let
  me shorten my tale by telling you briefly the story which Ruggles told the
  police. It did not amount to a great deal, but such as it was it revealed
  a degree of cunning and of daring in the ways of burglary that have seldom
  been equalled. Ruggles, it seems, had as usual put away the gems in the safe
  and locked up the premises in Sackville Street and then walked home to the
  flat, very glad, he declared, that his responsibility would cease before
  another day went by, as he expected Sir James home from abroad the following
  morning. He had his supper as usual, but when he settled down to read his
  paper he felt so sleepy that he just went and bolted the front door, placed
  the keys underneath his pillow and went straight to bed. He remembered nothing
  more until he felt himself roughly shaken and heard his master&rsquo;s voice
  calling to him. It took him some time to collect himself; he felt dazed and
  his head ached terribly. When Sir James told him that it was past ten o&rsquo;clock
  he could not conceive how he could have overslept himself in this way. Through
  force of habit he put his hand under his pillow to grope for the keys. They
  had gone! Then Sir James telephoned to the police. That was all that Ruggles
  could say. His condition was pitiable; alternately bemoaning his fate and
  cursing himself for a fool, he knelt at his master&rsquo;s feet and with
  hands clasped begged for forgiveness.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I&rsquo;d have done anything in the world for Sir James,&rsquo; he
  kept reiterating to the police officer, &lsquo;and &rsquo;ere I&rsquo;ve
  been the ruin of &rsquo;im, just through over-sleepin.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The police inspector got quite impatient with him, and at one time,
  I think, he thought that the man was acting a part. But Sir James Narford
  himself indignantly repudiated any suggestion of the sort. &lsquo;I would
  trust Ruggles,&rsquo; he said emphatically, &lsquo;as I would myself. I have
  known him for thirty years and he was in my father&rsquo;s service before
  that. I trust him with my keys, with money, with everything. He would have
  plenty of opportunity to rob me comfortably if he had a mind. What would
  a man of his class do with valuable gems?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;All the same I fancy that the police did not altogether lose sight
  of the possibility that Ruggles might know something about the affair, but
  in spite of very clever questioning and cross-questioning, his story never
  varied even in the minutest detail. All that he added to his original statement
  that was of any value was the description of a foreign visitor at Sackville
  Street whom, in his own words, he &lsquo;didn&rsquo;t like the looks of.&rsquo; This
  was a youngish man, with very sallow complexion, jet-black hair and moustache,
  and wearing a peculiar-looking caped overcoat and black soft hat with a very
  wide brim, who had remained over half an hour in the shop, apparently deeply
  interested in the gems. At one time he asked Ruggles whether he might have
  the glass cases opened so that he could examine the stones and pearls more
  closely. This request Ruggles very naturally refused. The young man then
  put a lot of questions to him: &lsquo;Where did the gems come from? What
  was their value? Were they insured? Where were they kept at night? Was the
  safe burglar-proof or only fire-proof?&rsquo; and so on.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It seems that two ladies who were visiting the exhibition at the
  same time noticed this same young man with the sallow complexion and the
  jet-black hair. They heard him questioning Ruggles and remarked upon his
  foreign accent, which was neither Italian nor Spanish; they thought he might
  be Portuguese. His clothes were certainly very outlandish. The ladies had
  noticed the caped coat, a kind of black Inverness, and the hat a la Montmartre.
  The presence of this foreigner in the shop in Sackville Street became still
  more significant later on, when another fact came to light&#8213; a fact
  in connection with the half-pint of beer which the lift-boy from the flats
  in George Street had fetched as usual on the evening preceding the robbery,
  from the Crown and Sceptre public-house. A few drops of the beer had remained
  in the mug beside the remnants of Ruggles&rsquo; supper. On examination the
  beer was found to contain chloral.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The lift-boy at first was probably too scared to throw any light
  on this circumstance. He had, he declared, fetched the beer as usual from
  the Crown and Sceptre, taken it up to No. 4, Sir James Narford&rsquo;s flat,
  and put it upon the table in the sitting-room where Mr. Ruggles&rsquo; supper
  was already laid for him. After repeated questions from the police inspector,
  however, he recollected that on his way from the public-house to the flats,
  a gentleman accosted him and asked him the way to Regent Street. The boy,
  holding the mug of beer in one hand, pointed out the way with the other,
  and probably turned his head in the same direction as he did so. He couldn&rsquo;t
  say for certain. The gentleman seemed stupid and didn&rsquo;t understand
  the directions all at once; the boy had to repeat them again and again, and
  altogether was in conversation with the gentleman quite a while.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It was dark at the time, but he did see that the gentleman wore a
  funny sort of coat and a funny hat, and, as the boy picturesquely put it, &lsquo;&rsquo;e
  spoke queer-like, as if &rsquo;e wor a Frenchman.&rsquo; To a lift-boy presumably
  every foreigner is Frenchman if he be not a German, and though the lad&rsquo;s
  description of the coat and hat only amounted to his calling them &lsquo;funny,&rsquo; there
  seemed little doubt but that the man who visited the shop in Sackville Street
  and the one who accosted the lift-boy in George Street were one and the same.
  There was also little doubt but that he poured the drug into the mug of beer
  while the boy&rsquo;s head was turned away. And finally all doubts were set
  at rest when the &lsquo;funny coat and hat&rsquo; were discovered tied up
  in a bundle in the area of an empty house, two doors higher up the street.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Unfortunately, although these few facts were definitely established,
  all traces of the man himself vanished after that. How he got into the block
  of flats could not be ascertained. He might have slipped in after the lift-boy,
  while the latter went upstairs with the beer, and concealed himself somewhere
  in the basement. It was impossible to say. The street door was kept open
  as usual until eleven o&rsquo;clock, and until that hour the boy was in attendance
  at the lift; he had been up and down several times, taking up residents or
  their visitors, and while he ran to fetch the beer one of the maids saw to
  the lift if the bell rang. At eleven o&rsquo;clock every evening the street
  door was closed, but not bolted; it was provided with a Yale lock and every
  resident had one key in case they came in late; the lift was not worked after
  that hour, but there was a light kept on every landing. These lights the
  housemaid switched off the first thing every morning when she did the stairs,
  and, as a matter of fact, she remembered that on that memorable morning the
  light on the top floor landing&#8213; which is the landing outside Sir James
  Narford&rsquo;s flat&#8213; was already switched off when she went to do
  it.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And those are all the facts,&rdquo; the Man in the Corner went on
  slowly, while he paused in his work of fashioning intricate knots in his
  beloved bit of string, &ldquo;all the facts that were ever known in connection
  with the theft of Sir James Narford&rsquo;s gems. Of course, as you may well
  suppose, not only the official but also the public mind at once flew to the
  mysterious personage originally found wounded in an empty house in Wicklow
  Lane. There could be no shadow of doubt that this man and the one who visited
  the shop in Sackville Street, who accosted the lift-boy, drugged Ruggles&rsquo; beer
  and robbed him of his keys, were one and the same. There was the black caped
  coat, the Montmartre hat, the jet-black hair and the foreign look. True,
  the wounded man of Wicklow Lane spoke English without any foreign accent,
  but the latter could easily be assumed. Indeed it all seemed plain sailing,
  and as soon as the word went round about the robbery in Sackville Street
  and the description was given of the foreign-looking individual with the
  jet-black hair, the police thought they had a perfectly clear case.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A clear case, yes!&rdquo; the funny creature went on, with a grin, &ldquo;but
  not an easy one, because when the police called at the hotel in Mexborough
  Square they learned that the mysterious Mr. Allen Lloyd had been gone three
  days. He paid his bill, he had walked out of the house one dark afternoon
  and not been seen or heard of since. He went off carrying a paper parcel
  which no doubt contained the few belongings he had bought of late.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of course he was the thief and a marvellously cunning one. Just think
  what it meant. It meant, first of all, the presence of mind and daring to
  accost the lift-boy and engage him in conversation whilst pouring a drug
  into a mug of beer; then it meant sneaking into the block of flats in George
  Street, breaking the glass panel of a door, entering the flat, stealing the
  keys, sneaking out of the building again, going round to Sackville Street,
  watching until the police on duty had passed by, entering the house, opening
  the safe, collecting the gems&#8213; all in full view of the street, mind
  you, or in absolute darkness&#8213; then relocking the safe and again watching
  for the opportunity to sneak out of the house until the man on duty was out
  of sight. Clever? I should think it would have been clever, if it had ever
  been done!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How do you mean, if it had ever been done?&rdquo; I ejaculated with
  some impatience. &ldquo;Whoever the thief was&#8213; and suppose that you
  have your theory&#8213; he must have done those things.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, no, he did not!&rdquo; the funny creature asserted emphatically, &ldquo;he
  merely put all the gems away in his own pocket after the exhibition was closed
  for the night, instead of locking them up in the safe.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then you think it was Ruggles?&rdquo; I exclaimed.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In conjunction with his master.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Sir James Narford? But why?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;For the sake of the insurance money.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But man alive!&rdquo; I ejaculated, &ldquo;that was the tragedy of
  the whole thing. I remember reading about it at the time. I suppose that
  it was either out of meanness or because he had so little ready money, but
  Sir James Narford had only insured his treasure for &pound;20,000, whereas
  the jewels&#8213;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Were not worth a penny more than that,&rdquo; the Man in the Corner
  broke in with his bland smile. &ldquo;The public may have been bamboozled
  with tales of fabulous value&#8213; nowadays people talk as glibly of millions
  as the past generation did of thousands&#8213; but insurance companies don&rsquo;t
  usually listen to fairy tales.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But even so,&rdquo; I argued, &ldquo;the jewels must have been worth
  more than the insurance after all the advertisement they got. Why shouldn&rsquo;t
  Sir James have sold them, rather than take the risk of stealing them?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But, my dear young lady,&rdquo; he retorted, &ldquo;can&rsquo;t you
  see that the jewels can still be sold and that they will be&#8213; abroad&#8213; presently&#8213; one
  by one? Twenty thousand pounds insurance money is good, but you double the
  amount and it is better.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But what about the wounded man in Wicklow Lane?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A red herring across the trail,&rdquo; he replied, with a smile, &ldquo;only
  with this difference, that it was dragged across before the hounds were on
  the scent. And that is where the immense cleverness of the man comes in.
  To create a personality on whom to draw suspicion of a crime and then make
  that personality disappear before the crime is committed, is as clever a
  bit of rascality as I have ever seen. It needed absolute coolness and a knowledge
  of facial make-up, in both of which we must take it Sir James Narford was
  a past-master. Think then how easy everything else would be for him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Just let me reconstruct the whole thing for you from beginning to
  end, that is, from the moment when Sir James Narford first conceived the
  idea of doubling the value of his gems, and took his man Ruggles as partner
  in that fine piece of rascality. He couldn&rsquo;t have done it without a
  partner, of course, and probably this was not the first villainy those two
  scoundrels carried through together. Well then, Narford, having given instructions
  to Ruggles and arranged certain matters of detail with him, begins his campaign
  by ostensibly starting on a journey. He crossed over to France probably and
  then back to England. It is easy enough for a man to disappear in crowded
  trains or railway stations if there is no one on his track; easy enough for
  him to stay in one hotel after another in any big town if he chooses hotels
  whose proprietors have reason to dread the police and will not volunteer
  information if any of their visitors are &lsquo;wanted.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A month only of such wanderings and Sir James Narford, habitually
  a very dapper man with sleek, sandy hair cropped very close, a tiny tooth-brush
  moustache and shaven cheeks and chin, can easily be transformed into one with
  shaggy hair and beard and walrus moustache. Add to this a nose built out
  with grease-paint and highly-coloured, and cheeks stained a dull red, and
  you have the man who called for the key of that empty house at Messrs. Whiskin
  and Sons, with a parcel under his arm which contained the black cape and
  Montmartre hat purchased abroad at some time previously, during the course
  of his wanderings. That&rsquo;s simple, is it not?&rdquo; the funny creature
  continued, while his thin, claw-like fingers worked away feverishly at his
  piece of string. .</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now, all that our rascal wants is to change his clothes and his face;
  so, late that evening, by preconcerted plan, Ruggles meets him at the empty
  house under cover of the fog. Here he and his precious master change clothes
  with one another. Narford then completes his toilet by applying to his shaggy
  hair and beard one of those modern dyes that are so much advertised for the
  use of ladies desiring to possess raven locks. And so we have the explanation
  of all the conflicting evidence of the witnesses who saw a man with a parcel
  and yet were so much at variance both as to the time when they saw him, as
  to his appearance, and even as to the size of the parcel.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Having thus created the personality of a foreign-looking individual
  in black clothes, you will easily see how important it was for the general
  scheme that the comedy of the row and the pistol shots in the empty house
  should be enacted. Attention had to be drawn to the created personage, attention
  coupled with mystery, and at this stage of the scheme there was not the slightest
  danger of the wounded man in Wicklow Lane being in any way connected with
  Sir James Narford of George Street, Mayfair. Time was no object. The mysterious
  Allen Lloyd of Wicklow Lane might be detained days, weeks, even months, but
  he would have to be let out some time or other. He was perfectly harmless
  apparently, and otherwise sane; he could not be kept for ever at the country&rsquo;s
  expense. He was eventually discharged, went to an hotel and lived there quietly
  a while longer until he thought that the time was ripe for complete disappearance.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In the meanwhile we must suppose that he was in touch with Ruggles.
  Ruggles made a point of taking a brisk walk every evening. Well, winter evenings
  are dark and London is a very crowded place. Ruggles would bring what money
  was required. What more easy than to meet in a crowd?</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then at last the two rascals thought that the time was ripe. The
  mysterious Mr. Allen Lloyd disappeared from the hotel in Mexborough Gate;
  he went to Sackville Street where he shaved off his shaggy moustache and
  beard and cut his hair once more so close that nothing of the dyed ends could
  be seen. He changed into his own clothes which Ruggles kept there ready for
  him. Then he slipped round to Victoria Station and crossed over to France,
  only in order to return to England openly this time as Sir James Narford,
  and just in time to find Ruggles just aroused from a drugged sleep and the
  whole flat seething with excitement. But it was he who in black cape and
  Montmartre hat visited the shop in Sackville Street, it was Ruggles who the
  following night spoke to the lift boy, even while Narford was procuring for
  himself a perfect alibi by crossing over quite openly from France.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ruggles&rsquo; task was, of course, much easier. All he had to do
  was to put the gems in his pocket and these Narford took over from him in
  the morning at the flat before he telephoned for the police. To put on the
  black cape and hat and to accost the lift-boy was easy enough on a dark,
  snowy night in January. And now all the excitement has died down. The whole
  thing was so cleverly planned that the real rascal was never suspected. Ruggles
  may have been but nothing could really be brought up against him. The gems
  haven&rsquo;t been found and to all appearances he has not benefited by the
  robbery. He is just the faithful, trusted servant of his master.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Sir James Narford has got his money from the Insurance Company and
  since then has left for abroad. By the way,&rdquo; the Man in the Corner
  concluded, as he gathered up his precious bit of string and slipped it in
  the pocket of his ulster, &ldquo;I heard recently that he has bought some
  property in Argentina and has settled down there permanently with his friend
  Ruggles. I think he was wise to do that, and if you care to publish my version
  of that mysterious affair, you are at liberty to do so. I don&rsquo;t think
  that our friend would sue you for defamation of character, and, anyway, I&rsquo;ll
  undertake to pay damages if the case comes into court.&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="TheMiserOfMaidaVale"></a>The Miser Of Maida Vale</b> </h2>
  <p>&ldquo;One of the most puzzling cases I ever remember watching,&rdquo; the
  Man in the Corner said to me that day, &ldquo;was the one known to the public
  as that of &lsquo;The Miser of Maida Vale.&rsquo; It presented certain altogether
  novel features, and for once I was willing to admit that, though the police
  had a very hard nut to crack in the elucidation of the mystery, and in the
  end failed to find a solution, they were at one time very near putting their
  finger on the key of the puzzle. If they had only possessed some of that
  instinct for true facts with which Nature did so kindly endow me, there is
  no doubt that they would have brought that clever criminal to book.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I wish it were in my power to convey something of that air of ludicrous
  complacency with which he said this. I could almost hear him purring to himself,
  like a lean, shabby old cat. He had his inevitable bit of string in his hand
  and had been in rapturous contemplation of a series of knots which he had
  been fashioning until the moment when I sat down beside him and he began
  to speak. But as soon as he embarked upon his beloved topic he turned his
  rapturous contemplation on himself. He just sat there and admired himself,
  and now and again blinked at me, with such an air of self-satisfaction that
  I longed to say something terribly rude first and then to flounce out of
  the place, leaving him to admire himself at his leisure.</p>
  <p>But, of course, this could not be. To use the funny creature&rsquo;s own
  verbiage, Nature had endowed me with the journalistic instinct. I had to
  listen to him; I had to pick his brains and to get copy out of him. The irresistible
  desire to learn something new, something that would thrill my editor as well
  as my public compelled me to swallow my impatience, to smile at him&#8213; somewhat
  wryly perhaps&#8213; and then to beg him to proceed.</p>
  <p>I was all attention.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he said, still wearing an irritating air of condescension, &ldquo;do
  you remember the case of the old miser of Maida Vale?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Only vaguely,&rdquo; I was willing to admit.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It presented some very interesting features,&rdquo; he went on blandly, &ldquo;and,
  assuming that you really only remember them vaguely, I will put them before
  you as clearly as possible, in order that you may follow my argument more
  easily later on.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The victim of the mysterious tragedy was, as no doubt you remember,
  an eccentric old invalid named Thornton Ashley, the well-known naval constructor,
  who had made a considerable fortune during the war and then retired, chiefly,
  it was said, owing to ill-health. He had two sons, one of whom, Charles,
  was a misshapen, undersized creature, singularly unprepossessing both in
  appearance and in manner, whilst the other, Philip, was a tall, good-looking
  fellow, very agreeable and popular wherever he went. Both these young men
  were bachelors, a fact which, it appears, had been for some time a bone of
  contention between them and their father. Old Ashley was passionately fond
  of children and the only desire of his declining years was to see the grandchildren
  who would ultimately enjoy the fortune which he had accumulated. Whilst he
  was ready to admit that Charles, with his many afflictions, did not stand
  much chance with the fair sex, there was no reason at all why Philip should
  not, marry, and there had been more than one heated quarrel between father
  and son on that one subject.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So much so, indeed, that presently Philip cut his stick and went
  to live in rooms in Jermyn Street. He had a few hundreds a year of his own,
  left to him by a godmother. He had been to Rugby and to Cambridge and had
  been a temporary officer in the war; pending his obtaining some kind of job
  he settled down to live the life of a smart young bachelor in town, whilst
  his brother Charles was left to look after the old man, who became more and
  more eccentric as his health gradually broke up.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He sold his fine house in Hyde Park Gardens, his motor and the bulk
  of his furniture, and moved into a cheap flat in Maida Vale, where he promptly
  took to his bed, which he never left again. His eccentricities became more
  and more pronounced and his temper more and more irascible. He took a violent
  dislike to strangers, refused to see anybody except his sons and two old
  friends, Mr. Oldwall, the well-known solicitor, and Dr. Fanshawe-Bigg, who
  visited him from time to time, and whose orders he obstinately refused to
  obey. Worst of all, as far as the unfortunate Charles was concerned, he became
  desperately mean, denying himself (and, incidentally, his son) every luxury,
  subsisting on the barest necessities, and keeping no servant to wait on him
  except a daily &lsquo;char.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Soon his miserliness degenerated into a regular mania.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Charles and I are saving money for the grandchildren you are
  going to give me one day,&rsquo; he would say with a chuckle whenever Philip
  tried to reason with him on the subject of this self-denying ordinance. &lsquo;When
  you have an establishment of your own, you can invite us to come and live
  with you. There will be plenty then for housekeeping, I promise you!&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;At which the handsome Philip would laugh and shrug his shoulders
  and go back to his comfortable rooms in Jermyn Street. But no one knew what
  Charles thought about it all. To an outsider his case must always have appeared
  singularly pathetic. He had no money of his own and his delicate health had
  made it impossible for him to take up any profession: he could not cut his
  stick like his brother Philip had done, but, truth to tell, he did not appear
  to wish to do so. Perhaps it was real fondness for his father that made him
  seem contented with his lot. Certain it is that as time went on he became
  a regular slave to the old man, waiting on him hand and foot, more hard-worked
  than the daily &lsquo;char,&rsquo; who put on her bonnet and walked out of
  the flat every day at six o&rsquo;clock when her work was done, and who had
  all her Sundays to herself.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;All the relaxation that Charles ever had were alternate weekends,
  when his brother Philip would come over and spend Saturday to Monday in the
  flat, taking charge of the invalid. On those occasions Charles would get
  on an old bicycle, and with just a few shillings in his pocket which he had
  saved during the past fortnight out of the meagre housekeeping allowance
  which he handled, he would go off for the day somewhere into the country,
  nobody ever knew where. Then on Monday morning he would return to the flat
  in Maida Vale, ready to take up his slave&rsquo;s yoke, to all appearance
  with a light heart.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Charles Ashley is wise,&rsquo; the gossiping acquaintances
  would say, &lsquo;he sticks to the old miser. Thornton Ashley can&rsquo;t
  live for ever, and Oldwall says that he is worth close a quarter of a million.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Philip, on the other hand, could have had no illusions with regard
  to his father&rsquo;s testamentary intentions. The bone of contention&#8213; Philip&rsquo;s
  celibacy&#8213; was still there, making bad blood between father and son;
  more than once the old miser had said to him with a sardonic grin: &lsquo;Let
  me see you married soon, my boy, and with a growing family around you, or
  I tell you that my money shall go to that fool Charles, or to the founding
  of an orphan asylum or the establishment of a matrimonial agency.&rsquo;&ldquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mr. Oldwall the solicitor, a very old friend of the Ashleys, and
  who had seen the two boys grow up, threw out as broad a hint to Philip on
  that same subject as professional honour allowed.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Your father,&rsquo; he said to him one day, &lsquo;has got
  that mania for saving money, but otherwise he is perfectly sane you know.
  He&rsquo;ll never forgive you if you don&rsquo;t gratify his wish to see
  you married. Hang it all, man, there are plenty of nice girls about. And
  what on earth would poor old Charles do with a quarter of a million, I&rsquo;d
  like to know.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But for a long time Philip remained obstinate and his friends knew
  well enough the cause of this obstinacy; it had its root in a pre-war romance.
  Philip Ashley had been in love&#8213; some say that he had actually been
  engaged to her&#8213; with a beautiful girl, Muriel Balleine, the daughter
  of the eminent surgeon, Sir Arnold Balleine. The two young people were thought
  to be devoted to one another. But the lovely Muriel had, as it turned out,
  another admirer in Sir Wilfred Peet-Jackson, the wealthy ship-owner, who
  worshipped her. Philip Ashley and Wilfred Peet-Jackson were great friends;
  they had been at school and &rsquo;Varsity together. In 1915 they both obtained
  a commission in the Coldstreams and in 1916 Peet-Jackson was very severely
  wounded. He was sent home to be nursed by the beautiful Muriel in her father&rsquo;s
  hospital in Grosvenor Square. His case had already been pronounced hopeless,
  and Sir Arnold himself, as well as other equally eminent surgeons, gave it
  as their opinion that the unfortunate young man could not live more than
  a few months&#8213; if that.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We must then take it that pity and romance played their part in the
  events that ensued. Certain it is that London society was one day thrilled
  to read in its <i>Times </i>that Miss Muriel Balleine had been married the
  previous morning to Sir Wilfred Peet-Jackson, the wealthy ship-owner and
  owner of lovely Deverill Castle in Northamptonshire. Her friends at once
  put it about that Muriel had only yielded to a dying man&rsquo;s wish, and
  that there was nothing mercenary or calculating in this unexpected marriage;
  she probably would be a widow within a very short time and free to return
  to her original love and to marry Philip Ashley. But in this case, like in
  so many others in life, the unexpected occurred. Sir Wilfred Peet-Jackson
  did not die&#8213; not just then. He lived six years after the doctors had
  said that he must die in six months. He remained an invalid and he and his
  beautiful wife spent their winters in the Canaries and their summers in Switzerland,
  but Muriel did not become a widow until 1922, and Philip Ashley all that
  time never looked at another girl; he was even willing to allow a fortune
  to slip away from him, because he always hoped that the woman whom he had
  never ceased to worship would be his wife one day.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Probably old Ashley knew all that; probably he hated the idea that
  this one woman should spoil his son&rsquo;s life for always; probably he
  thought that threat of disinheritance would bring Philip back out of the
  realms of romance to the realities of life. All this we shall never know.
  The old man spoke to no one about that, not even to Mr. Oldwall, possibly
  not even to Charles. By the time that Sir Wilfred Peet-Jackson had died and
  Philip had announced his engagement to the beautiful widow, Thornton Ashley
  was practically a dying man. However, he did have the satisfaction before
  he died of hearing the good news. Philip told him of his engagement one Saturday
  in May when he came for his usual fortnightly weekend visit.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Strangely enough although the old man must have been delighted at
  this tardy realisation of his life&rsquo;s desire, he did not after that
  make any difference in his mode of life. He remained just as irascible, just
  as difficult and every bit as mean as he had always been; he never asked
  to see his future daughter-in-law, whom he had known in the past, though
  she did come once or twice to see him; nor did he encourage Philip to come
  and see him any more frequently than he had done before. The only indication
  he ever gave that he was pleased with the engagement was an obvious impatience
  to see the wedding-day fixed as soon as possible, and one day he worked himself
  up into a state of violent passion because Philip told him that Lady Peet-Jackson
  was bound to let a full year lapse before she married again, out of respect
  for Wilfred&rsquo;s memory.&rdquo;</p>
  <h3 align="center"><b>2</b></h3>
  <p>&ldquo;Of course a good deal of gossip was concentrated on all these events.
  Although Thornton Ashley had, for the past three years, cut himself adrift
  from all social intercourse, past friends and acquaintances had not altogether
  forgotten him, whilst Philip Ashley and Lady Peet-Jackson had always been
  well-known figures in a certain set in London. It was not likely, therefore,
  that their affairs would not be discussed and commented on at tea-parties
  and in the clubs. Philip Ashley was exalted to the position of a hero. By
  his marriage he would at last grasp the fortune which he had so obstinately
  and romantically evaded: true love was obtaining its just reward, and so
  on. Lady Peet-Jackson, on the other hand, was not quite so leniently dealt
  with by the gossips. It was now generally averred that she had originally
  thrown Philip Ashley over only because Peet-Jackson was a very rich man and
  had a handle to his name, and that she was only returning to her former love
  now, because Thornton Ashley had already one foot in the grave and was reputed
  to be worth a quarter of a million.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I have a photograph here,&rdquo; the Man in the Corner went on, and
  threw a bundle of newspaper cuttings down before me, &ldquo;of Lady Peet-Jackson.
  As no doubt you will admit, she is very beautiful, but the face is hard;
  looking at it one feels instinctively that she is not a woman who would stand
  by a man in case of trouble or disgrace. But it is difficult to judge from
  these smudgy reproductions, and there is no doubt that Philip Ashley was
  madly in love with her. That she had enemies, especially amongst those of
  her own sex, was only natural in view of the fact that she was exceptionally
  beautiful, had made one brilliant marriage and was on the point of making
  another.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But the two romantic lovers were not the sole food of the gossip-mongers.
  There was the position of Charles Ashley to be discussed and talked over.
  What was going to become of him? How would he take this change in his fortune?
  If rumour, chiefly based on Mr. Oldwall&rsquo;s indiscretions, was correct,
  he would be losing that reputed quarter of a million if Philip&rsquo;s marriage
  came off. But in this case gossip had to rest satisfied with conjectures.
  No one ever saw Charles, and Philip, when questioned about him, had apparently
  very little to say.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Charles is a queer fish,&rsquo; he would reply. &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t
  profess to know what goes on inside him. He seems delighted at the prospect
  of my marriage, but he doesn&rsquo;t say much. He is very shy and very sensitive
  about his deformity, and he won&rsquo;t see anyone now, not even Muriel.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And thus the stage was set,&rdquo; the funny creature continued with
  a fatuous grin,&rdquo; for the mysterious tragedy which has puzzled the public
  and the police as much as the friends of the chief actors in the drama. It
  was set for the scene of Philip Ashley&rsquo;s marriage to Muriel Lady Peet-Jackson,
  which was to take place very quietly at St. Saviour&rsquo;s, Warwick Road,
  early in the following year.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;On August 27th old Thornton Ashley died, that is to say he was found
  dead in his bed by his son Charles, who had returned that morning from his
  fortnightly weekend holiday. The cause of death was not in question at first;
  though Dr. Fanshawe-Bigg was out of town at the moment, his locum tenens
  knew all about the case, and had seen the invalid on the Thursday preceding
  his death. In accordance with the amazing laws of this country, he gave the
  necessary certificate without taking a last look at the dead man, and Thornton
  Ashley would no doubt have been buried then and there without either fuss
  or ceremony, but for the amazing events which thereupon followed one another
  in quick succession.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The funeral had been fixed for Thursday the 30th, but within twenty-four
  hours of the old miser&rsquo;s death it had already transpired that he had
  indeed left a considerable fortune which included one or two substantial
  life insurances, and that the provisions of his will were very much as Philip
  Ashley and his friends had surmised. After sundry legacies to various charitable
  institutions concerned with the care of children, Thornton Ashley had left
  the residue of his personality to whichever of his sons was first married
  within a year from the time of the testator&rsquo;s death, the other son
  receiving an annuity of three hundred pounds. This clearly was aimed at Philip
  as poor misshapen Charles had always been thought to be out of the running.
  Moreover, a further clause in the will directed that in the event of both
  the testator&rsquo;s sons beings still unmarried within that given time,
  then the whole of the residue was to go to Charles, with an annuity of one
  hundred pounds to Philip and a sum of ten thousand pounds for the endowment
  of an orphan asylum at the discretion of the Charity Organisation Society.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There were a few conjectures as to whether Charles Ashley, who, by
  his brother&rsquo;s impending marriage, would be left with a paltry three
  hundred pounds a year, would contest his father&rsquo;s will on the grounds
  of non-compos mentis, but, you know, it is always very difficult in this
  country to upset a will, and the provisions of this particular one were so
  entirely in accord with the wishes expressed by the deceased on every possible
  occasion, that the plea that he was of unsound mind when he made it would
  never have been upheld, quite apart from the fact that Mr. Oldwall, who drew
  up the will and signed it as one of the witnesses, would have repudiated
  any suggestion that his client was anything but absolutely sane at the time.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Everything then appeared quite smooth and above board when suddenly,
  like a bolt from the blue, came the demand from the Insurance Company in
  which the late Mr. Thornton Ashley had a life policy for forty thousand pounds
  for a post-mortem examination, the company not being satisfied that the deceased
  had died a natural death. Naturally, Dr. Percy Jutt, who had signed the death
  certificate, was furious, but he was overruled by the demands of the Insurance
  Company, backed by no less a person than Charles Ashley. Indeed, it soon
  transpired that it was in consequence of certain statements made by Mr. Triscott,
  a local solicitor, on behalf of Charles Ashley to the general manager of
  the company, that the latter took action in the matter.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Philip Ashley, through his solicitor, Mr. Oldwall, and backed by
  Dr. Jutt, might perhaps have opposed the proceedings, but quite apart from
  the fact that opposition from that quarter would have been impolitic, it
  probably also would have been unsuccessful. Anyway, the sensation-mongers
  had quite a titbit to offer to the public that afternoon: the evening papers
  came out before midday with flaring headlines: &lsquo;The Mystery Miser of
  Maida Vale.&rsquo; Also &lsquo;Sensational Developments&rsquo; and &lsquo;Sinister
  Rumours.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;By four o&rsquo;clock in the afternoon some of the papers had it
  that a post-mortem examination of the body of the late Mr. Thornton Ashley
  had been conducted by Dr. Dawson, the divisional surgeon, and that it had
  revealed the fact that the old miser had not died a natural death, traces
  of violence having been discovered on the body. It was understood that the
  police were already in possession of certain facts and that the coroner of
  the district would hold an inquest on Thursday the 30th, the very day on
  which the funeral was to have taken place.</p>
  <h3 align="center"><b>3</b></h3>
  <p>&ldquo;Now I have attended many an inquest in my day,&rdquo; the Man in
  the Corner continued after a brief pause, during which his claw-like fingers
  worked away with feverish energy at his bit of string, &ldquo;but seldom
  have I been present at a more interesting one. There were so many surprises,
  such an unexpected turn of events, that one was kept on tenterhooks the whole
  time as to what would happen next.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Even to those who were in the know, the witnesses in themselves were
  a surprise. Of course, everyone knew Mr. Oldwall, the solicitor and life-long
  friend of old Thornton Ashley, and the divisional surgeon, whose evidence
  would be interesting; then there was poor Charles Ashley and handsome brother,
  Philip, now the owner of a magnified fortune, whose romantic history had
  more than once been paragraphed in the Press. But what in the world had Mr.
  Triscott, a local lawyer whom nobody knew, and Mrs. Trapp, a slatternly old &lsquo;char,&rsquo; to
  do with the case? And there was also Dr. Percy Jutt who had not come out
  of the case with flying professional colours, and who must have cursed the
  day when he undertook the position of locum tenens for Dr. Fanshawe-Bigg.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The proceedings began with the sensational evidence of Dr. Dawson,
  the divisional surgeon, who had conducted the post-mortem. He stated that
  the deceased had been in an advanced state of uraemia, but this had not actually
  been the cause of death. Death was due to heart-failure caused by fright
  and shock following on violent aggression and an attempt at strangulation.
  There were marks round the throat, and evidences of a severe blow having
  been dealt to the face and cranium, causing concussion. In the patient weak
  state of health, shock and fright had affected the heart&rsquo;s action with
  fatal results.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;All the while that the divisional surgeon gave evidence, going into
  technical details which the layman could not understand. Dr. Percy Jutt had
  obvious difficulty to control himself. He had a fidgety, nervous way with
  him and was constantly biting his nails. When he, in his turn, entered the
  witness-box, he was as white as a sheet and tried to hide his nervousness
  behind a dictatorial, blustering manner. In answer to the coroner, he explained
  that he had been acting as locum tenens for Dr. Fanshawe-Bigg who was away
  on holiday. He had visited the deceased once or twice during the past fortnight,
  and had last seen him on the Thursday preceding his death. Dr. Fanshawe-Bigg
  had left him a few notes on the case.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I found,&rsquo; he went on to explain, &lsquo;the deceased
  in an advanced stage of uraemia, and there was very little that I could do,
  more especially as I was made to understand that my visits were not particularly
  wanted. On the Thursday deceased was in a very drowsy state, this being one
  of the best-known symptoms of the disease, and I didn&rsquo;t think that
  he could live much longer. I told Mr. Charles Ashley so; at the same time
  I did ot think that the end would come quite so soon. However, I was not
  particularly surprised when on the Monday morning I received a visit from
  Mr. Charles Ashley who told me that his father was dead. I found him very
  difficult to understand,&rsquo; Dr. Jutt continued in reply to a question
  from the coroner, &lsquo;emotion had, I thought, addled his speech a little.
  He may have tried to tell me something in connection with his father&rsquo;s
  death, but I was so rushed with work that morning, and, as I say, I was fully
  prepared for the event, that all I could do was to promise to come round
  some time during the day, and, in the meanwhile, in order to facilitate arrangements
  for the funeral, I gave the necessary certificate. I was entirely within
  my rights,&rsquo; he concluded, with somewhat aggressive emphasis, and,
  as far as I can recollect, Mr. Charles Ashley said nothing that in any way
  led me to think that there was anything wrong.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mr. Oldwall, the solicitor, was the next witness called, and his
  testimony was unimportant to the main issue. He had drafted the late Mr.
  Thornton Ashley&rsquo;s will in 1919, and had last seen him alive before
  starting on a short holiday some time in June. Deceased had just heard then
  of his son&rsquo;s engagement and witness thought him looking wonderfully
  better and brighter than he had been for a long time.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Mr. Ashley,&rsquo; the coroner asked, &lsquo;didn&rsquo;t
  say anything to you then about any alteration to his will?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Most emphatically, no!&rsquo; the witness replied.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Or at any time?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;At no time,&rsquo; Mr. Oldwall asserted.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;These questions put by the coroner in quick succession had, figuratively
  speaking, made everyone sit up. Up to now the general public had not been
  greatly interested; one had made up one&rsquo;s mind that the old miser had
  kept certain sums of money, after the fashion of his kind, underneath his
  mattress; that some evildoer had got wind of this and entered the flat when
  no one was about, giving poor Thornton Ashley a fright that had cost him
  his life.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But with this reference to some possible alteration in the will the
  case at once appeared more interesting. Suddenly one felt on the alert, excitement
  was in the air, and when the next witness, a middle-aged, dapper little man,
  wearing spectacles, a grey suit and white spats, stood up to answer questions
  put to him by the coroner, a suppressed gasp of anticipatory delight went
  round the circle of spectators.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The witness gave his name as James Triscott, solicitor of Warwick
  Avenue. He said that he had known the deceased slightly, having seen him
  on business in connection with the lease of 73, Malvine Mansions, the landlord
  being a client of his. On the previous Friday, that is, the 24th, witness
  received a note written in a crabbed hand and signed &lsquo;A. Thornton Ashley,&rsquo; asking
  him to call at Malvine Mansion any time during the day. This Mr. Triscott
  did that same afternoon. The door was opened by Mr. Charles Ashley whom he
  had also met once or twice before, who showed him into the room where the
  deceased lay in bed, obviously very ill but perfectly conscious and reasonable.</p>
  <br clear="all">
 <p>&nbsp;&ldquo;&lsquo;After some preliminary talk,&rsquo; the witness went
  on, &lsquo;the deceased explained to me that he was troubled in his mind
  about a will which he had made some four years previously, and which had
  struck him of late as being both harsh and unjust. He desired to make a new
  will, revoking the previous one. I naturally told him that I was entirely
  at his service, and he then dictated his wishes to me. I made notes and promised
  to have the will ready for his signature by Monday. The thought of this delay
  annoyed him considerably, and he pressed me hard to have everything ready
  for him by the next day. Unfortunately, I couldn&rsquo;t do that. I was obliged
  to go off into the country that evening on business for another client, and
  couldn&rsquo;t possibly be back before midday Saturday, when my clerk and
  typist would both be gone. All I could do was to promise faithfully to call
  again on Monday at eleven o&rsquo;clock with the will quite ready for signature.
  I said I would bring my clerk with me, who could then sign as a witness.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I quite saw the urgency of the business,&rsquo; Mr. Triscott,
  went on in his brisk, rather consequential way, &lsquo;as the poor old gentleman
  certainly looked very ill. Before I left he asked me to let him at least
  have a copy of my notes before I went away this evening. This I was able
  to promise him. I got my clerk to copy the notes and to take them round to
  the flat later on in the day.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I can assure you,&rdquo; the Man in the Corner said, &ldquo;that
  while that dapper little man was talking, you might have heard the proverbial
  pin drop amongst the public. You see, this was the first that anyone had
  ever heard of any alteration in old Ashley&rsquo;s will, and Mr. Triscott&rsquo;s
  evidence opened up a vista of exciting situations that was positively dazzling.
  When he ceased speaking, you might almost have heard the sensation-mongers
  licking their chops like a lot of cats after a first bite at a succulent
  meal; glances were exchanged, but not a word spoken, and presently a sigh
  of eagerness went round when the coroner put the question which everyone
  had been anticipating:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Have you got the notes, Mr. Triscott, which you took from
  the late Mr. Thornton Ashley&rsquo;s dictation?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;At which suggestion Mr. Oldwall jumped up, objecting that such evidence
  was inadmissible. There was some legal argument between him and the coroner,
  during which Mr. Triscott, still standing in the witness-box, beamed at his
  colleague and at the public generally through his spectacles. In the end
  the jury decided the point by insisting on having the notes read out to them.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Briefly, by the provisions of the new will, which was destined never
  to be signed, the miser left his entire fortune with the exception of the
  same trifling legacies and of an annuity of a thousand pounds a year to Philip,
  to his son Charles absolutely, in grateful recognition for years of unflagging
  devotion to an eccentric and crabbed invalid. Mr. Triscott explained that
  on the Monday morning he had the document quite ready by eleven o&rsquo;clock
  and that he walked round with it to Malvine Mansions, accompanied by his
  clerk. Great was his distress when he was met at the door by Charles Ashley,
  who told him that old Mr. Thornton Ashley was dead.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That was the substance of Mr. Triscott&rsquo;s evidence, and I can
  assure you that even I was surprised at the turn which events had taken.
  You know what the sensation-mongers are; within an hour of the completion
  of Mr. Triscott&rsquo;s evidence it was all over London that Mr. Philip Ashley
  had murdered his father in order to prevent his signing a will that would
  deprive him&#8213; Philip&#8213; of a fortune. That is the way of the world,&rdquo; the
  funny creature added with a cynical smile. &ldquo;Philip&rsquo;s popularity
  went down like a sail when the wind suddenly drops, and in a moment public
  sympathy was all on the side of Charles who had been done out of a fortune
  by a grasping and unscrupulous brother.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But there was more to come.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The next witness called was Mrs. Triscott, the wife of the dapper
  little solicitor, and her presence here in connection with the death of old
  Thornton Ashley seemed as surprising at first as that of her husband had
  been. She looked a hard, rather common, but capable woman, and after she
  had replied to the coroner&rsquo;s preliminary questions, she plunged into
  her story in a quiet, self-assured manner. She began explaining that she
  was a trained nurse, but had given up her profession since her marriage.
  Now and again, however, either in an emergency or to oblige a friend, she
  had taken care of a patient. &ldquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;On Friday evening last,&rsquo; she continued, &lsquo;Mr. Triscott,
  who was just going off into the country, on business, said to me that he
  had a client in the neighbourhood who was very ill, and about whom, for certain
  reasons, he felt rather anxious. He went on to say that he was chiefly sorry
  for the son, a delicate man, who was sadly deformed. Would I, like a good
  Samaritan, go and look after the sick man during the week end? It seems that
  the doctor had ordered absolute rest, and Mr. Triscott feared that there
  might be some trouble with another son because, as a matter of fact, the
  old man had decided to alter his will.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;I knew nothing about Mr. Thornton Ashley&rsquo;s family affairs,&rsquo; the
  witness said, in reply to a question put to her the coroner, and calmly ignoring
  the sensation which her statement was causing, &lsquo;beyond what I have
  just told that Mr. Triscott said to me, but I agreed to go to Malvine Mansions
  and see if I could be of any use. I arrived at the flat on Friday evening
  and saw at once what the invalid was suffering from. I had nursed cases of
  uraemia before, and I could see that the poor old man had not many more days
  to live. Still I did not think that the end was imminent. Mr. Charles Ashley,
  who had welcomed me most effusively, looked to need careful nursing almost
  as much as his father did. He told me that he had not slept for three nights,
  so I just packed him off to bed and spent the night in an arm-chair in the
  patient&rsquo;s room.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;The next morning Mr. Philip Ashley arrived and I was told
  of the arrangement whereby Mr. Charles got a weekend holiday once a fortnight.
  welcomed the idea for his sake, and as he seemed very anxious about his father,
  and remembering what my husband had told me, I promised that I would stay
  on in the flat until his return on the Monday. Thus only was I able to persuade
  him to go off on his much needed holiday. Directly he had gone, however,
  I thought it my duty to explain to Mr. Philip Ashley that really his father
  was very ill. He was only conscious intermittently and that in such cases
  the only thing that could be done was to keep the patient absolutely quiet.
  It was the only way, I added, to prolong life and to ensure a painless and
  peaceful death.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Mr. Philip Ashley,&rsquo; the witness continued, &lsquo;appeared
  more annoyed than distressed when I told him this, and asked me by whose
  authority I was here, keeping him out of his father&rsquo;s room, and so
  on. He also asked me several peremptory questions as to who had visited his
  father lately, and when I told him that I was the wife of a well-known solicitor
  in the neighbourhood, he looked for a moment as if he would give way to a
  violent fit of rage. However, I suppose he thought better of it, and presently
  I took him into the patient&rsquo;s room, who was asleep just then, begging
  him on no account to disturb the sufferer.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;After he had seen his father, Mr. Ashley appeared more ready
  to admit that I was acting for the best. However, he asked me&#8213; rather
  rudely, I thought, considering that the patient was nothing to me and I was
  not getting paid for my services&#8213; how long I proposed staying in the
  flat. I told him that I would wait here until his brother&rsquo;s return,
  which I was afraid would not be before ten o&rsquo;clock on Monday morning.
  Whereupon he picked up his hat, gave me a curt good-day, and walked out of
  the flat.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;To my astonishment,&rsquo; the witness now said, amidst literally
  breathless silence on the part of the spectators, &lsquo;it had only just
  gone eight on the Monday morning when Mr. Philip Ashley turned up once more.
  I must say that I was rather pleased to see him. I was expecting Mr. Triscott
  home and had a lot to do in my own house. The patient, who had rallied wonderfully
  the last two days, had just gone off into a comfortable sleep, and as I knew
  that Mr. Charles would be back soon, I felt quite justified in going off
  duty and leaving Mr. Philip in charge, with strict injunctions that he was
  on no account to disturb the patient. If he woke, he might be given a little
  barley-water first and then some beef-tea, all of which I had prepared and
  put ready. My intention was, directly I got home, to telephone to Dr. Jutt
  and ask him to look in at Malvine Mansions some time during the morning.
  Unfortunately, when I got home I had such a lot to do, that frankly, I forgot
  to telephone to the doctor, and before the morning was over, Mr. Triscott
  had come home with the news that old Mr. Thornton Ashley was dead.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;This,&rdquo; the Man in the Corner continued, &ldquo;was the gist
  of Mrs. Triscott&rsquo;s evidence at that memorable inquest. Of course, there
  were some dramatic incidents during the course of her examination; glances
  exchanged between Philip Ashley and Mr. Oldwall, and between him and the
  dapper little Mr. Triscott. The latter, I must tell you, still beamed at
  everybody; he looked inordinately proud of his capable business-like wife,
  and very pleased with the prominence which he had attained through this mysterious
  and intricate case.</p>
  <h3 align="center"><b>4</b></h3>
  <p>&ldquo;The luncheon interval gave us all a respite from tension that had
  kept our nerves strung up all morning. I don&rsquo;t think that Philip Ashley,
  for one, ate much lunch that day. I noticed, by the way, that he and Mr.
  Oldwall went off together, whilst Mr and Mrs. Triscott took kindly charge
  of poor Charles. I caught sight of the three of them subsequently in a blameless
  tea-shop. Charles was indeed a pathetic picture to look upon; he looked the
  sort of man who lives on his nerves, with no flesh on his poor misshapen
  bones, and a hungry craving expression in his eyes, as in those of an underfed
  dog.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We had his evidence directly after luncheon. But, a matter of fact,
  he had not much to say. He had last seen his father alive on the Saturday
  morning when he went off on his fortnightly weekend holiday. He had cycled
  to Dorking and spent his time there at the &lsquo;Running Footman,&rsquo; as
  he had often done before. He was well known in the place. On Monday morning
  he made an early start and got to Malvine Mansions soon after ten and let
  himself into the flat with his latch-key. He expected to find his brother
  or Mrs. Triscott there, but there was no one. He then went into his father&rsquo;s
  room, and, at first, thought that the old man was only asleep. The blinds
  were down and the room very dark.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He drew up the blind and went back to his father&rsquo;s bedside.
  Then only did he realise that the old man was dead. Though he was very ignorant
  in such matters, he thought that there was something strange about the dead
  man, and he tried to explain this to Dr. Jutt. But the latter seemed too
  busy to attend to him, so when Mr. Triscott came to call later on, he told
  him of this strange feeling that troubled him. Mr. Triscott then thought
  that as Dr. Jutt seemed so indifferent about the matter, it might be best
  to see the police.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;But this,&rsquo; Charles Ashley explained, &lsquo;I refused
  to do, and then Mr. Triscott asked me if I knew whether my dear father had
  any life insurances, and, if so, in what company. I was able to satisfy him
  on that point, as I had heard him speak to Mr. Oldwall about a life policy
  he had in the Empire of India Life Insurance Company. Mr. Triscott then told
  me to leave the matter to him, which I was only too glad to do.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Witness was asked if he knew anything of his father&rsquo;s intentions
  with regard to altering his will, and to this he gave an emphatic &lsquo;No!&rsquo; He
  explained that he had taken a note from his father to Mr. Triscott on the
  Friday and that he had seen Mr. Triscott when the latter called at the flat
  that afternoon, but when the coroner asked him whether he knew what passed
  between his father and the lawyer on that occasion, he again gave an emphatic &lsquo;No!&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;He had accepted gratefully Mr. Triscott&rsquo;s suggestion
  that Mrs. Triscott should come over for the weekend to take charge of the
  invalid, but he declared that this arrangement was in no way a reflection
  upon his brother. On the whole then, Charles Ashley made a favourable impression
  upon the public and jury for his clear and straightforward evidence. The
  only time when he hesitated&#8213; and did so very obviously&#8213; was when
  the coroner asked him whether he knew of any recent disagreement between
  his father and his brother Philip, a disagreement which might have led to
  Mr. Thornton Ashley&rsquo;s decision to alter his will. Charles Ashley did
  hesitate at this point and, though he was hard-pressed by the coroner, he
  only gave ambiguous replies, and when he had completed his evidence he left
  one under the impression that he might have said something if he would, and
  that but for his many afflictions the coroner would probably have pressed
  him much harder.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;This impression was confirmed by the evidence of the next witness,
  a Mrs. Trapp, who had been the daily char at Malvine Mansions. She began
  by explaining to the coroner that she had done the work at the flat for the
  past two years. At first she used to come every morning for a couple of hours,
  with the exception of Sundays, but for the last two months or so she came
  on the Sundays, but stayed away on the Monday; on Wednesdays she stayed the
  whole day, until about six, as Mr. Charles always did a lot of shopping those
  afternoons.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Asked whether she remembered what happened at the flat on the Wednesday
  preceding Mr. Thornton Ashley&rsquo;s death she said that she did remember
  quite well. Mr. Philip Ashley called; he did do that sometimes on a Wednesday
  when his brother was out. He stayed about an hour and, in Mrs. Trapp&rsquo;s
  picturesque language, he and his father &lsquo;carried on awful!&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I couldn&rsquo;t &rsquo;ear what they said,&rsquo; Mrs. Trapp
  explained with eager volubility, &lsquo;but I could &rsquo;ear the ole gentleman
  screaming. I &rsquo;ad &rsquo;eard &rsquo;im storm like that at Mr. Philip
  once before&#8213; about a month ago. But Lor&rsquo; bless you, Mr. Philip &rsquo;e
  didn&rsquo;t seem to care, and on Wednesday when I let &rsquo;im out of the
  flat &rsquo;e just looked quite cheerful like. But the ole gentleman &rsquo;e
  was angry. I &rsquo;ad to give &rsquo;im a nip o&rsquo; brandy, &rsquo;e
  was sort o&rsquo; shaken after Mr. Philip went.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You see then, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; the Man in the Corner said
  with a grim chuckle, &ldquo;how gradually a network of sinister evidence
  was being woven around Philip Ashley. He himself was conscious of it, and
  he was conscious also of the wave of hostility that was rising up against
  him. He looked now, not only grave, but decidedly anxious, and he held his
  arms tightly crossed over his chest, as if in the act of making a physical
  effort to keep his nerves under control.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He gave me the impression of a man who would hate any kind of publicity,
  and the curious, eager looks that were cast upon him, especially by the women,
  must have been positive torture to a sensitive man. However, he looked a
  handsome and manly figure as he stood up to answer the questions put to him
  by the coroner. He said that he had arrived at the flat on the Saturday at
  about midday, explaining to the jury that he always came once a fortnight
  to be with his father, whilst his brother Charles enjoyed a couple of days
  in the country. On this occasion, however, he was told that his father was
  too ill to see him. Charles, however, went off on his bicycle as usual, but
  contrary to precedent a lady had apparently been left in charge of the invalid.
  Witness understood that this was Mrs. Triscott, the wife of a neighbour,
  who had kindly volunteered to stay over the weekend. She was an experienced
  nurse and would know what to do in case the patient required anything. For
  the moment he was asleep and must not be disturbed.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I naturally felt very vexed,&rsquo; the witness continued, &lsquo;at
  being kept out of my father&rsquo;s room, and I may have spoken rather sharply
  at the moment, but I flatly deny that I was rude to Mrs. Triscott, or that
  I was in a violent rage. I did get a glimpse of my father as he lay in bed,
  and I must say that I did not think that he looked any worse than he had
  been all along. However, I was not going to argue the point. I preferred
  to wait until the Monday morning when my brother would be home, and I could
  tackle him on the subject.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;At this point the coroner desired to know why, in that case, when
  the witness was told that his brother would not be at the flat before ten
  o&rsquo;clock, he turned up there as early as half-past eight.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Because,&rsquo; the witness replied, &lsquo;I was naturally
  rather anxious to know how things were, and because I hoped to get a day
  on the river with a friend, and to make an early start if possible. However,
  when I got to the flat, Mrs. Triscott wanted to get away, and so I agreed
  to stay there and wait until ten o&rsquo;clock, when, so Mrs. Triscott assured
  me, my brother would certainly be home. As a matter of fact he always used
  to get home at that hour with clockwork regularity on the Monday mornings
  after his holiday.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;My father was asleep and Mrs. Triscott left me instructions
  what to do in case he required anything. At half-past nine he woke. I heard
  him stirring and I went into his room and gave him some barley-water and
  sat with him for a little while. He seemed quite cheerful and good-tempered
  and, honestly, I did not think that he was any worse than he had been for
  weeks. Just before ten o&rsquo;clock he dropped off to sleep again. I knew
  that my brother would be in within the next half-hour and, as this would
  not be the first time that my father was left alone in the flat, I did not
  think that I should be doing anything wrong by leaving him. I went back to
  my chambers and was busy making arrangements for the day when I had a telephone
  message from my brother that our father was dead.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Questioned by the coroner as to the disagreement which he had had
  with his father on the previous Wednesday, Mrs Philip Ashley indignantly
  repudiated the idea that there was any quarrel.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;My father,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;had a very violent temper
  and a very harsh, penetrating voice. He certainly did get periodically angry
  with me whenever I explained to him that my marriage to Lady Peet-Jackson
  could not, in all decency, take place for at least another six months. He
  would storm and shriek for a little while,&rsquo; the witness went on, &lsquo;but
  we invariably parted the best of friends.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>The Man in the Corner paused for a little while, leaving me both interested
  and puzzled. I was trying to piece together what I remembered of the case
  with what he had just told me, and I was longing to hear his explanation
  of the events which followed that memorable inquest. After a little while
  the funny creature resumed:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I told you,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that a wave of hostility had risen
  in the public mind against Philip Ashley. It came from a sense of sympathy
  for the other son, who, deformed and afflicted, had been done out of a fortune.
  True, that it would not have been of much use to him, and that in the original
  will ample provision had been made for his modest wants, but it now seemed
  as if, at the eleventh hour, the old miser had thought to make reparation
  toward the son who had given up his whole life to him, whilst the other had
  led one of leisure, independence and gaiety. What had caused old Thornton
  Ashley thus to change his mind was never conclusively proved; there were
  some rumours already current that Philip Ashley was in debt and had appealed
  to his father for money, a fatal thing to do with a miser. But this also
  was never actually proved. The only persons who could have enlightened the
  jury on the subject were Philip Ashley himself and his brother Charles, but
  each of them, for reasons of his own, chose to remain silent.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And now you will no doubt recall the fact which finally determined
  the jury to bring in their sensational verdict, in consequence of which Philip
  Ashley was arrested on the coroner&rsquo;s warrant on a charge of attempted
  murder. It seemed horrible, ununderstandable, unbelievable, but nevertheless
  a jury of twelve men did arrive at that momentous decision after deliberation
  lasting less than half an hour.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What I believe weighed with them in the end was the fact that the
  assistant who came with the divisional surgeon to conduct the post-mortem
  found underneath the bed of the deceased a walking-stick with a rather heavy
  knob, and the crumpled and torn copy of the notes for the new will which
  Mr. Triscott had prepared. Philip Ashley when confronted with the stick admitted
  that it was his. He had missed it on the Saturday when he was leaving the
  flat, as he was under the impression that he had brought one with him; however,
  he did not want to spend any more time looking for it, as he was obviously
  so very much in the way.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now both the charwoman and Mrs. Triscott swore that the patient&rsquo;s
  room had been cleaned and tidied on the Sunday, and that there was no sign
  of a walking-stick in the room then.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And so,&rdquo; the Man in the Corner went on, with a cynical shrug
  of his lean shoulders, &ldquo;Philip Ashley went through the terrible ordeal
  of being hauled up before the magistrate on the charge of having attempted
  to murder his father, an old man with one foot in the grave. He pleaded &lsquo;Not
  Guilty&rsquo; and reserved his defence. The whole of the evidence was gone
  through all over again, of course, but nothing new had transpired. The case
  was universally thought to look very black against the accused, and no one
  was surprised when he was eventually committed for trial.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Public feeling remained distinctly hostile to him. It was a crime
  so horrible and so unique you would have thought that no one would have believed
  that a well-known, well-educated man could possibly have been guilty of it.
  Probably, if the event had occurred before the war, public opinion would
  have repudiated the possibility, but so many horrible crimes have occurred
  in every country these past few years that one was just inclined to shrug
  one&rsquo;s shoulders and to murmur, &lsquo;Perhaps, one never knows!&rsquo; One
  thing remained beyond a doubt: old Mr. Thornton Ashley died of shock or fright
  following a violent and dastardly assault, finger-marks were discovered round
  his throat, and there were evidences on his face and head that he had been
  repeatedly struck with what might easily have been the walking-stick which
  was found under his bed. Add to this the weight of evidence of the new will
  about to be signed, and of the quarrel between father and son on the previous
  Wednesday, and you have as good a motive for the murder as any prosecuting
  counsel might wish for. Philip Ashley would not, of course, hang for murder,
  but it was even betting that he would get twenty years.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Anyway, I don&rsquo;t think that, as things were, anyone blamed Lady
  Peet-Jackson for her decision. A week before Philip Ashley&rsquo;s trial
  came on she announced her engagement to Lord Francis Firmour, son of the
  Marquis of Ettridge, whom she subsequently married.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But Philip Ashley was acquitted&#8213; you remember that? He was
  acquitted because Sir Arthur Inglewood was his counsel, and Sir Arthur is
  the finest criminal lawyer we possess; and, because the evidence against
  him was entirely circumstantial, it was demolished by his counsel with masterly
  skill. Whatever might be said on the subject of motive, there was nothing
  whatever to prove that the accused knew anything of his father&rsquo;s intentions
  with regard to a new will; and there was only a charwoman&rsquo;s word to
  say that Philip had quarrelled with his father on that memorable Wednesday.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;On the other hand, there was Mr. Oldwall and Dr. Fanshawe-Bigg, old
  friends of the deceased, both swearing positively that Thornton Ashley had
  a peculiarly shrill and loud voice, that he would often get into passions
  about nothing at all, when he would scream and storm, and yet mean nothing
  by it. The only evidence of any tangible value was the walking-stick, but
  even that was not enough to blast a man&rsquo;s life with such a monstrous
  suspicion.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Philip Ashley was acquitted, but there are not many people who followed
  that case closely who believed him altogether innocent at the time. What
  Lady Peet-Jackson thought about it no one knows. It was for her sake that
  the unfortunate man threw up the chances of a fortune, and when it came within
  his grasp it still seemed destined to evade him in the end. In losing the
  woman for whom he had been prepared to make so many sacrifices, poor Philip
  lost the fortune a second time, because, as he was not married within the
  prescribed time-limit, it was Charles who inherited under the terms of the
  original will. But I think you will agree with me that any sensitive man
  is well out of a union with a hard and mercenary woman.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And now there has been another revolution in the wheel of Fate. Charles
  Ashley died the other day in a nursing-home of heart-failure following an
  operation. He died intestate and his brother is his sole heir. Funny, isn&rsquo;t
  it, that Philip Ashley should get his father&rsquo;s fortune in the end?
  But Fate does have a way sometimes of dealing out compensations after she
  has knocked a man about beyond his deserts. Philip Ashley is a rich man now,
  and there is a rumour, I am told, current in the society papers, that Lady
  Francis Firmour has filed a petition for divorce, and that the proceedings
  will be undefended. But can you imagine any man marrying such a woman after
  all that she made him suffer?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Then, as the funny creature paused and appeared entirely engrossed in the
  fashioning of complicated knots in his beloved bit of string, I felt that
  it was my turn to keep the ball rolling.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then you, for one,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;are quite convinced that
  Philip Ashley did not know that his father intended to make a new will, and
  did not try to murder him?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; he retorted.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; I rejoined, somewhat lamely, &ldquo;someone did assault
  the old miser, didn&rsquo;t they? If it was not Philip Ashley then it must
  have been just an ordinary burglar who thought that the old man had some
  money hidden away under his mattress.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you theorise more intelligently than that?&rdquo; the
  tiresome creature asked, in his very rude and cynical manner. I would gladly
  have slapped his face, only&#8213; I did want to know.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Your own theory,&rdquo; I retorted, choosing to ignore his impertinence, &ldquo;seek
  him first whom the crime benefits.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, and whom did that particular crime benefit the most?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Philip Ashley, of course,&rdquo; I replied. &ldquo;But you said yourself&#8213;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Philip Ashley did not benefit by the crime,&rdquo; the old scarecrow
  broke in, with a dry cackle. &ldquo;No, no, but for the fact that a merciful
  Providence removed Charles Ashley so very unexpectedly out of this wicked
  world, Philip would still be living on a few hundreds a year, most of which
  he would owe to the munificence of his brother.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That,&rdquo; I argued, &ldquo;was only because that Peet-Jackson
  woman threw him over, otherwise&#8213;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And why did she throw him over? Because old Thornton Ashley died
  under mysterious circumstances and Philip Ashley was under a cloud because
  of it. Anyone could have foreseen that that particular woman would throw
  him over the very moment that suspicion fell upon him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But Charles&#8213;&rdquo; I began.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Exactly,&rdquo; he broke in, excitedly, &ldquo;it was Charles who
  benefited by the crime. It was he who inherited the fortune.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But, by the new will he would have inherited anyhow. Then why in
  the world&#8213;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You surely don&rsquo;t believe in that new will, do you? The way
  in which I marshalled the facts before you ought to have paved the way for
  more intelligent reasoning.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But Mr. Triscott&#8213;&rdquo; I argued.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah, yes,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;Mr. Triscott&#8213; exactly. The
  whole thing could only be done in partnership, I admit. But does not everything
  point to a partnership in what, to my mind is one of the ugliest crimes in
  our records? You ought be able to follow the workings of Charles Ashley&rsquo;s
  mind, a mind as tortuous as the body that held it. Let me put the facts more
  briefly before you.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;While Philip obstinately remained a bachelor, all was well. Charles
  stuck to the old miser, carefully watching over his interests lest they became
  jeopardised. But presently Lady Peet-Jackson became a widow and Philip gaily
  announced his engagement. From that hour Charles, of course, must have seen
  the fortune on which he had already counted slipping away irretrievably from
  his grasp. Can you not see in your mind&rsquo;s eye that queer, misshapen
  creature setting his crooked brain to devise a way out of the difficulty?
  Can you not see the plan taking shape gradually, forming itself slowly into
  a resolve&#8213; a resolve to stop his brother&rsquo;s marriage at all costs?</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But how? Philip, passionately in love with Muriel Peet-Jackson, having
  won her after years of waiting, was not likely to give her up. No, but she
  might give him up. She had done it once for the sake of ambition, she might
  do it again if... if ... Well, Charles Ashley, obscure, poor, misshapen,
  was not likely to find a rival who would supplant his handsome brother in
  any woman&rsquo;s affections. Certainly not! But there remained the other
  possibility, the possibility that Philip, poor&#8213; or, better still, disgraced&#8213; might
  cease to be a prize in the matrimonial market. Disgraced! But how? By publicity?
  By crime? Yes, by crime! Now, can you see the plan taking shape?</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Can you see Charles cudgelling his wits as to what crime could most
  easily be fastened on a man of Philip&rsquo;s personality and social position?
  Probably a chance word dropped by his father put the finishing touch to his
  scheme, a chance word on the subject of a will. And there was the whole plan
  ready. The unsigned will, the assault on the dying man, and there were always
  plenty of quarrels between the peppery old miser and his somewhat impatient
  son. As for Triscott, the dapper little local lawyer, I suppose it took some
  time for Charles Ashley&rsquo;s crooked schemes to appear as feasible and
  profitable to him. Of course, without him nothing could have been done, and
  the whole of my theory rests upon the fact that the two men were partners
  in the crime.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Where they first met, and how they became friends, I don&rsquo;t
  profess to know. If I had had anything to do with the official investigation
  of that crime I should first of all have examined the servant in the Triscott
  household, and found out whether or no Mr. Charles Ashley had ever been a
  visitor there. In any case, I should have found out something about Triscott&rsquo;s
  friends and Triscott&rsquo;s haunts. I am sure that it would then have come
  to light that Charles Ashley and Mr. Triscott had constant intercourse together.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I cannot bring myself to believe in that unsigned will. There was
  nothing whatever that led up to it, except the supposed quarrel on the Wednesday.
  But, if that old miser did want to alter his will, why should he have sent
  for a man whom he hardly knew and whom, mind you, he would have to pay for
  his services, rather than for his friend, Oldwall, who would have done the
  work for nothing? The man was a miser, remember. His meanness, we are told,
  amounted to a mania; a miser never pays for something he can get for nothing.
  There was also another little point that struck me during the inquest as
  significant. If Triscott was an entire stranger to Charles Ashley, why should
  he have taken such a personal interest in him and in the old man to the extent
  of sending his wife to spend two whole days and nights in charge of an invalid
  who was nothing to him? Why should Mrs. Triscott have undertaken such a thankless
  task in the house of a miser where she would get no comforts and hardly anything
  to eat? Why, I say, should the Triscotts have done all that if they had not
  some vital self-interest at stake?</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And I contend that that vital self-interest demand that one of them
  should be there, in the flat, on the watch to see that no third person was
  present whilst Philip spent his time by his father&rsquo;s bedside&#8213; a
  witness, such as Lady Peet-Jackson, perhaps, or some friend&#8213; whose
  testimony might demolish the whole edifice of lies which had been so carefully
  built up. And, did you notice another point? The charwoman, by a new arrangement,
  was never at the flat on a Monday morning, and that arrangement had only
  obtained for the past two months. Now why? Charwomen stay away, I believe,
  on Sundays always, but, I ask you, have you ever heard of a charwoman having
  a holiday on a Monday?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I was bound to admit that it was unusual, whereupon the old scarecrow went
  on with excitement that grew as rapidly as did the feverish energy of his
  fingers manipulating his bit of string.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And now propel your mind back to that same Monday morning, when,
  the coast being clear, Charles Ashley, back at the flat and alone with the
  old man, was able at last to put the finishing touch to his work of infamy.
  One pressure of the fingers, one blow with the walking-stick, and the curtain
  was rung down finally on the hideous drama which he had skilfully invented.
  Think of it all carefully and intelligently,&rdquo; the Man in the Corner
  concluded, as he stuffed his beloved of string into the capacious pocket
  of his checked ulster, &ldquo;and you will admit that there is not a single
  flaw in my argument&#8213;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The walking-stick,&rdquo; I broke in, quickly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Exactly,&rdquo; he retorted, &ldquo;the walking-stick. Charles was
  quick enough to grasp the significance of that, and on Saturday, while his
  brother&rsquo;s back was turned, he carefully hid the walking-stick, knowing
  that it would be a useful piece of evidence presently. Do you, for a moment
  suppose,&rdquo; he added, drily, &ldquo;that any man would have been such
  a fool as to throw his walking-stick and the crumpled notes of the will underneath
  his victim&rsquo;s bed? They could not have been left there, remember, they
  could not have rolled under the bed, as the walking-stick had a crook handle,
  they must deliberately have been thrown there.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, no!&rdquo; he said, in conclusion, &ldquo;there is no flaw. It
  is all as clear as daylight to any receptive intelligence, and though human
  justice did err at first, and it looked, at one time, as if the innocent
  alone would suffer and the guilty enjoy the fruits of this crime, a higher
  Justice interposed in the end. Charles has gone, and Philip is in possession
  of the fortune which his father desired him to have. I only hope that his
  eyes are opened at last to the true value of the beautiful Muriel&rsquo;s
  love, and that it will be some other worthier woman who will share his fortune
  and help him forget all that he endured in the past.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And what about the Triscotts?&rdquo; I asked</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; he said, with a sigh, &ldquo;they are the wicked who prosper,
  and higher Justice has apparently forgotten them, as it often does forget
  the evil-doer, for a time. We must take it that they were well paid for their
  share in the crime, and, if the unfortunate Charles had lived, he probably
  would have been blackmailed by them and bled white. As it is, they have gone
  scot-free. I made a few enquiries in the neighbourhood lately and I discovered
  that Mr. Triscott is selling his practice and retiring from business. Presently
  we&rsquo;ll hear that he has bought himself a cottage in the country. Then,
  perhaps, your last doubt will vanish and you will be ready to admit that
  I have found the true solution of the mystery that surrounded the death of
  the miser of Maida Vale.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The next moment he was gone and I just caught sight of the corner of his
  checked ulster disappearing through the swing-doors.</p>
  <h2><b><a name="TheFultonGardensMystery"></a>The Fulton Gardens Mystery</b> </h2>
  <p>&ldquo;Are you prepared to admit,&rdquo; the Man in the Corner said abruptly
  as soon as he had finished his glass of milk, &ldquo;that sympathy, understanding,
  largeness of heart&#8213; what?&#8213; are invariably the outcome of a big
  brain? It is the fool who is censorious and cruel. Your clever man is nearly
  always sympathetic. He understands, he appreciates, he studies motives and
  understands them. During the war it was the fools who tracked down innocent
  men and women under pretence that they were spies; it was the fools who did
  not understand that a German might be just as fine a patriot as a Briton
  or a Frenchman if he served his own country. The hard, cruel man is almost
  always a fool; the backbiting old maid invariably so.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I am tempted to say this,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;because I have
  been thinking over that curious case which newspaper reporters have called
  the Fulton Gardens Mystery. You remember it, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;I do. As a matter of fact, I knew poor
  old Mr. Jessup slightly and I was terribly shocked when I heard about that
  awful tragedy. And to think that that horrid young Leighton&#8213;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ha!&rdquo; my eccentric friend broke in, with a chuckle, &ldquo;then
  you have held on to that theory, have you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There was no other possible!&rdquo; I retorted.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But he was discharged.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I shrugged my shoulders under pretence of being unconvinced. As a matter
  of fact, all I wanted was to make the funny creature talk. &ldquo;A flimsy
  alibi,&rdquo; I said coldly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And a want of sympathy,&rdquo; he rejoined.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What has sympathy got to do with a brutal assault on a defenceless
  old man? You can&rsquo;t deny that Leighton had something, at any rate, to
  do with it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I did not mean sympathy for the guilty,&rdquo; he argued, &ldquo;but
  for the women who were the principal witnesses in the case.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see&#8213;&rdquo; I protested.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, but I do. I understood, and in a great measure I sympathised.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>At which expression of noble sentiment I burst out laughing. I couldn&rsquo;t
  help it. In view of his preamble just now his fatuous statement was funny
  beyond words.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You being the clever man who understands, etcetera,&rdquo; I said,
  as seriously as I could, &ldquo;and I the censorious and cruel old maid who
  is invariably a fool.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You put it crudely,&rdquo; he rejoined complacently, &ldquo;and
  had you not given ample proof of your intelligence before now I might have
  thought it worth while to refute the second half of your argument. As for
  the first...&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hadn&rsquo;t you better tell me about the Fulton Garde Mystery?&rdquo; I
  broke in impatiently.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; he replied, in no way abashed. &ldquo;I have meant
  to talk to you about it all along, only that you would digress.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Pax!&rdquo; I retorted, and with a conciliatory smile I handed him
  a beautiful bit of string. He pounced on it with thin hands that looked like
  the talons of a bird, and he gloated on that bit of string for all the world
  as on a prey.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I daresay,&rdquo; he began, &ldquo;that to most people the mystery
  appeared baffling enough. But to me... Well, there was the victim of what
  you very properly call the cowardly assault, your friend&#8213; or acquaintance&#8213; Mr.
  Seton Jessup, a man on the wrong side of sixty, but very active and vigorous
  for his years. He carried on the business of pearl merchant in Fulton Gardens,
  but he did not live there, as you know. He was a married man, had sons and
  daughters and a nice house in Fitzjohn&rsquo;s Avenue. He also owned the
  house in Fulton Gardens, a four-storied building of the pattern prevalent
  in that neighbourhood.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The ground floor, together with the one above that, and the basement
  were used by Mr. Jessup himself for his business: on the ground-floor he
  had his office and showroom, above that were a couple of reception rooms
  where he usually had his lunch and saw a few privileged customers, and in
  the basement there was a kitchen with scullery and pantry, a small servants&rsquo; hall
  and a strong room for valuables. The top storey of all was let to a surgical-instrument
  maker who did not sleep on the premises, and the second floor&#8213; that
  is the one just below the surgical-instrument maker and immediately above
  the reception rooms&#8213; was occupied by Mrs. Tufnell, who was cook-housekeeper
  to Mr. Jessup, and her niece, Ann Weber, who acted as the house-parlourmaid.
  Mrs. Tufnell&rsquo;s son, Mark, who was a junior clerk in the office, did
  not sleep in the house. He was considered to be rather delicate and lived
  with a family somewhere near the Alexandra Palace.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;All these people, as you know, played important parts in the drama
  that was enacted on the 16th of November at No. 13, Fulton Gardens&#8213; an
  unlucky number, by the way, but one which Mr. Jessup did not change to the
  usual 12a when he bought the house because he despised all superstition.
  He was a hard-headed, prosperous business man; he worked hard himself and
  expected hard work from his employees. Both his sons worked in the office,
  one as senior clerk and the other as showman, and in addition to young Mark
  Tufnell there was another junior clerk&#8213; a rather unsatisfactory youth
  named Arthur Leighton, who was some sort of a relation of Mrs. Jessup&rsquo;s.
  But for this connection he never would have been kept on in the business,
  as he was unpunctual, idle and unreliable. The housekeeper, as well as some
  of the neighbours, had been scandalised lately by what was picturesquely
  termed the &lsquo;goings on of that young Leighton with Ann, the housemaid
  at No. 13.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ann Weber was a very pretty girl, and like many pretty girls, she
  was fond of finery and of admiration. As soon as she entered Mr. Jessup&rsquo;s
  service she started a flirtation with Mark Tufnell, then she dropped him
  for a while in favour of the youngest Mr. Jessup; then she went back to Mark
  and seemed really in love with him that time until, finally, she transferred
  her favours to Arthur Leighton, chiefly because he was by far the most generous
  of her admirers. He was always giving her presents of jewellery which Mark
  Tufnell could not afford, and young Jessup apparently did not care to give
  her. But she did not, by any means, confine her flirtations to one man: indeed,
  it appears that she had a marvellous facility for keeping several men hanging
  about her dainty apron-strings.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She was not on the best of terms with her aunt, chiefly because the
  latter noted with some asperity that her son was far from cured of his infatuation
  for the pretty housemaid. The more she flirted with Leighton and the others
  the greater did his love for her appear, and all that Mrs. Tufnell could
  hope for was that Mr. Leighton would many Ann one day soon, when he would
  take her right away and Mark would then probably make up his mind to forget
  her. Young Leighton was doing very well in business apparently, for he always
  had plenty of money to spend, whilst poor Mark had only a small salary, and,
  moreover, had nothing of the smart, dashing about him which had made the
  other man so attractive to Ann.</p>
  <h3 align="center"><b>2</b></h3>
  <p>&ldquo;And now,&rdquo; the Man in the Corner continued after a while, &ldquo;we
  come to that 16th of November when the mysterious drama occurred at No. 13,
  Fulton Gardens. As a general rule, it seems, Mr. Jessup was in his office
  most evenings until seven o&rsquo;clock. His clerks and showmen finished
  at six, but he would, almost invariably, stay on an hour longer to go through
  his accounts or look over his stock. On this particular evening, just before
  seven o&rsquo;clock, he rang for the housekeeper, Mrs. Tufnell, and told
  her that he would be staying until quite late, and would she send him in
  a cup of tea and a plate of sandwiches in about an hour&rsquo;s time.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mrs. Tufnell owned to being rather disappointed when she had this
  order because her son Mark had arranged to take her and Ann to the cinema
  that evening, and now, of course, they could not leave until after Mr. Jessup
  had gone, in case he wanted anything, and he might be staying on until all
  hours. However, Mark stayed to supper, and after supper Mrs. Tufnell got
  the tea and sandwiches ready and took the tray up to Mr. Jessup herself.
  Mr. Jessup was then sitting at his desk with two or three big books in front
  of him, and Mrs. Tufnell noticed that the safe in which the cash was kept
  that came in after banking hours was wide open.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mrs. Tufnell put down the tray and was about to leave the room again
  when Mr. Jessup spoke to her.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I expect Mr. Leighton back presently. Show him in here when
  he comes. But I don&rsquo;t want to see anybody else, not any of you. Understand?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It seems that he said this in such a harsh and peremptory manner
  that Mrs. Tufnell was not only upset but quite frightened. Mr. Jessup had
  always been very kind and considerate to his servants, and the housekeeper
  declared that she had never been spoken to like that before. But we all know
  what those sort of people are: they have no understanding, and unless you
  are perpetually smiling at them they turn huffy at the slightest word of
  impatience. Undoubtedly Mr. Jessup was both tired and worried and no great
  stress was laid by the police subsequently on the fact that he had spoken
  harshly on this occasion. Even to you at this moment I daresay that this
  seems a trifling circumstance, but I mention it because to my mind it had
  a great deal of significance, and I think that the police were very wrong
  to dismiss it quite so lightly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, to resume. Mr. Jessup was in his office with his books and
  with the safe, where he kept all the cash that came in after banking hours,
  open. Mrs. Tufnell saw and spoke to him at eight o&rsquo;clock and he was
  then expecting Arthur Leighton to come to him at nine.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No one saw him alive after that.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The next morning Mrs. Tufnell was downstairs as usual at a quarter
  to seven. After she had lighted the kitchen fire, done her front steps and
  swept the hall, she went to do the ground-floor rooms. She told the police
  afterwards that from the moment she got up she felt that there was something
  wrong in the house. Somehow or other she was frightened; she didn&rsquo;t
  know of what, but she was frightened. As soon as she had opened the office
  door she gave a terrified scream. Mr. Jessup was sitting at his desk just
  as Mrs. Tufnell had seen him the night before, with his big books in front
  of him and the safe door open. But his head had fallen forward on the desk
  and his arms were spread out over his books. Mrs. Tufnell never doubted for
  a second but that he was dead, even before she saw the stick lying on the
  floor and that horrible, horrible, dull red stain which spread from the back
  of the old man&rsquo;s head, right down to his neck and stained his collar
  and the top of his coat. Even before she saw all that she knew that Mr. Jessup
  was dead.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Terrified, she clung to the open door; she could do nothing but stare
  and stare, for the room, the furniture, the motionless figure by the desk
  had started whirling round and round before her eyes, so that she felt that
  at any moment she might fall down in a dead faint. It seemed ages before
  she heard Ann&rsquo;s voice calling to her, asking what was the matter. Ann
  was lazy and never came downstairs before eight o&rsquo;clock. She had apparently
  only just tumbled out of bed when she heard Mrs. Tufnell&rsquo;s scream.
  Now she came running downstairs, with her bare feet thrust into her slippers
  and a dressing gown wrapped round her.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;What is it, auntie?&rsquo; she kept on asking as she ran, &lsquo;What
  has happened?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And when she reached the office door, she only gave one look into
  the room and exclaimed, &lsquo;Oh, my God! He&rsquo;s killed him!&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Somehow Ann&rsquo;s exclamation of horror brought Mrs. Tufnell to
  her senses. With a great effort she pulled herself together, just in time,
  too, to grip Ann by the arm, or the girl would have measured her length on
  the tiled floor behind her. As it was, Mrs. Tufnell gave her a vigorous shake:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;What do you mean, Ann Weber?&rsquo; she demanded in a hoarse
  whisper. &lsquo;What do you mean? Who has killed him?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But Ann couldn&rsquo;t or wouldn&rsquo;t utter another word. She
  was as white as a sheet and, staggering backwards, she had fallen up against
  the banisters at the foot of the stairs and was clinging to them, wide-eyed,
  with twitching mouth and shaking knees.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Pull yourself together, Ann Weber,&rsquo; Mrs. Tufnell said
  peremptorily, &lsquo;and run and fetch the police at once.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But Ann looked as if she couldn&rsquo;t move. She kept reiterating
  in a dry, meaningless manner, &lsquo;The police! The police!&rsquo; until
  Mrs. Tufnell, who by now had gathered her wits together, gave her a vigorous
  push and then went upstairs to put on her bonnet. A few minutes later she
  had gone for the police.</p>
  <h3 align="center"><b>3</b></h3>
  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; the Man in the Corner went on glibly, &ldquo;whether
  you remember all the circumstances which made that case such a puzzling one.
  Indeed, it well deserved the popular name that the evening papers bestowed
  on it&#8213; &lsquo;The Fulton Gardens Mystery&rsquo;&#8213; for it was,
  indeed, a mystery, and to most people it has so remained to this day.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not to you,&rdquo; I put in, with a smile, just to humour him, as
  I could see he was waiting to be buttered-up before he would proceed with
  his narrative.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, not to me,&rdquo; he admitted, with his fatuous smile. &ldquo;If
  the members of the police force who had the case in hand had been psychologists,
  they would not have been puzzled, either. But they were satisfied with their
  own investigations and with all that was revealed at the inquest, and they
  looked no further, with the result that when the edifice of their deductions
  collapsed, they had nowhere to turn. Time had gone on, evidences had become
  blurred, witnesses were less sure of themselves and less reliable, and a
  certain blackguard, on whom I for one could lay my fingers at this moment,
  is going through the world scot-free.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But let me begin by telling you the facts as they were revealed at
  the inquest. You can then form your own conclusions, and I daresay that these
  will be quite as erroneous as those arrived at by the public and the police.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The drama began to unfold itself when Mr. Ernest Jessup, the younger
  son of the deceased gentleman, was called. He began by explaining that he
  was junior clerk in his father&rsquo;s office, and that he, along with all
  the other employees, had remarked on the 16th that the guv&rsquo;nor did
  not seem at all like himself. He was irritable with everybody, and just before
  luncheon he called Arthur Leighton into his office and apparently some very
  hot words passed between the two. Witness happened to be in the hall at the
  moment, getting his hat and coat, and the housemaid was standing by. They
  both heard very loud voices coming from the office. The guv&rsquo;nor was
  storming away at the top of his voice.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;That&rsquo;s poor Leighton getting it in the neck,&rsquo; witness
  remarked to Ann Weber.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But the girl only giggled and shrugged her shoulders. Then she said: &lsquo;Do
  you think so?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; witness replied; &lsquo;aren&rsquo;t you sorry
  to see your devoted admirer in such hot water?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Again the girl giggled and then ran away upstairs. Mr. Leighton was
  not at the office the whole of that afternoon, but witness understood, either
  from his father or from his brother&#8213; he couldn&rsquo;t remember which&#8213; that
  Leighton was to come in late that night to interview the guv&rsquo;nor.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Witness was next questioned as to the events that occurred at Mr.
  Jessup&rsquo;s home in Fitzjohn&rsquo;s Avenue, while the terrible tragedy
  was enacted in Fulton Gardens. It seems that Mr. Jessup had an old mother
  who lived in St. Albans, and that he went sometimes to see her after business
  hours and stayed the night. As a general rule when he intended going he would
  telephone home in the course of the afternoon. On the 16th he rang up at
  about five o&rsquo;clock and said that he was staying late at the office&#8213; later
  than usual&#8213; and they were not to wait dinner for him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mrs. Jessup took this message herself and had recognised her husband&rsquo;s
  voice. Then, later on in the evening&#8213; it might have been half-past
  eight or nine&#8213; there was another telephone message from the office.
  Witness went to the telephone that time. A voice, which at first he did not
  think that he recognised, said: &lsquo;Mr. Jessup has gone to St. Albans.
  He caught the 7.50 and won&rsquo;t be home tonight.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In giving evidence witness at first insisted on the fact that he
  did not recognise the voice on the telephone. It was a man&rsquo;s voice,
  and sounded like that of a person who was rather the worse for drink. He
  asked who was speaking and the reply came quite clearly that time: &lsquo;Why,
  it&rsquo;s Leighton, you ass! Don&rsquo;t you know me?&rsquo; Witness then
  asked: &lsquo;Where are you speaking from?&rsquo; and the reply was: &lsquo;From
  the office, of course. I&rsquo;ve had my wigging and am getting consoled
  by our Annie-bird.&rsquo; Annie-bird was the name the pretty housemaid went
  by among the young clerks at the office.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Witness then hung up the receiver and gave his mother the message.
  Neither Mrs. Jessup nor anyone else in the house thought anything more about
  it, as there was nothing whatever unusual about the occurrence. Witness only
  made some remarks about Arthur Leighton having been drinking again, and there
  the matter unfortunately remained until the following morning, when witness
  and his brother arrived at the office and were met with the awful news.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Both Mrs. Jessup and Mr. Aubrey, the eldest son, corroborated the
  statements made by the previous witness with regard to the telephone messages
  on the evening of the 16th. Mr. Aubrey Jessup also stated that he knew that
  his father was worried about some irregularities in Arthur Leighton&rsquo;s
  accounts; and that he meant to have it out with the young clerk in the course
  of the evening. Witness had begged his father to let the matter rest until
  the next day, as Leighton, he thought, had got the afternoon off to see a
  sick sister, but the deceased had rejected the suggestion with obvious irritation.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Stuff and nonsense!&rsquo; he said. &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t believe
  in that sick sister a bit. I&rsquo;ll see that young blackguard tonight.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The next witness was Mrs. Tufnell, who was cook-housekeeper at Fulton
  Gardens. She was a middle-aged, capable-looking woman, with a pair of curiously
  dark eyes. I say &lsquo;curiously&rsquo; because Mrs. Tufnell&rsquo;s eyes
  had that velvety quality which is usually only met with in Southern countries.
  I have seldom seen them in England, except, perhaps, in Cornwall. Apart from
  her eyes, there was nothing either remarkable or beautiful about Mrs. Tufnell.
  She may have been good looking once, but that was a long time ago. When she
  stood up to give evidence, her face appeared rather bloodless, weather-beaten,
  and distinctly hard. She spoke quite nicely and without any of that hideous
  Cockney accent one might have expected from a cook in a City office.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She deposed that on the 16th, just before the luncheon hour, she
  was crossing the hall at 13, Fulton Gardens. The door into the office was
  ajar and she heard Mr. Jessup&rsquo;s voice raised, evidently in great wrath.
  Mrs. Tufnell also heard Mr. Leighton&rsquo;s voice, both gentlemen, as she
  picturesquely put it, going at one another hammer and tongs. Obviously, though
  she wouldn&rsquo;t admit it, Mrs. Tufnell stopped to listen, but she does
  not seem to have understood much of what was said. However, a moment or two
  later, Mr. Jessup went to the door in order to shut it, and while he did
  so, Mrs. Tufnell heard him say quite distinctly:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Well, if you must go now, you must, though I don&rsquo;t believe
  a word about your sister being ill. But you may go; only, understand that
  I expect you back here this evening not later than nine. I shall have gone
  through the accounts by then, and...&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;At this point the door was shut and witness heard nothing more. But
  she reiterated the statements which she had already made to the police, and
  which I have just retold you, about Mr. Jessup staying late at the office
  and her taking him in some sandwiches, when he told her that he was expecting
  Mr. Leighton at about nine o&rsquo;clock and did not wish to be disturbed
  by anybody else. Witness was asked to repeat what the deceased had actually
  said to her with reference to this matter, and she laid great stress on Mr.
  Jessup&rsquo;s harsh and dictatorial manner, so different, she said, to his
  usual gentlemanly ways.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to see anybody else&#8213; not any of you,&rdquo; that&rsquo;s
  what he said,&rsquo; Mrs. Tufnell replied, with an air of dignity, and then
  added: &lsquo;As if Ann Weber or I had ever thought of disturbing him when
  he was at work!&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Witness went on to relate that, after she had taken in the tray of
  tea and sandwiches, she went upstairs and found Ann Weber sitting in her
  room by herself. Mark, the girl explained, had gone off, very disappointed
  that they couldn&rsquo;t all go together to the cinema. Mrs. Tufnell argued
  the point for a moment or two, as she didn&rsquo;t see why Ann should have
  refused to go if she wanted to see the show. But the girl seemed to have
  turned sulky. Anyway, it was too late, she said, as Mark had gone off by
  himself: he had booked the places and didn&rsquo;t want to waste them, so
  he was going to get another friend to go with him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mrs. Tufnell then settled down to do some sewing and Ann turned over
  the pages of a stale magazine. Mrs. Tufnell thought that she appeared restless
  and agitated. Her cheeks were flushed and at the slightest sound she gave
  a startled jump. Presently she said that she had some silver to clean in
  the pantry, and went downstairs to do it. Some little time after that there
  was a ring at the front door bell, and Mrs. Tufnell heard Ann going through
  the hall to open the door. A quarter of an hour went by, and then another.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mrs. Tufnell began to wonder what Ann was up to. She put down her
  sewing and started to go downstairs. The first thing that struck her was
  that all the lights on the stairs and landing were out; the house appeared
  very silent and dark; only a glimmer came from one of the lights downstairs
  in the hall at the foot of the stairs.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mrs. Tufnell went down cautiously. Strangely enough, it did not occur
  to her to turn on the lights on her way. After she had passed the first-floor
  landing she heard the sound of muffled voices coming from the hall below.
  Thinking that she recognised Ann&rsquo;s voice, she called to her: &lsquo;Is
  that you, Ann?&rsquo; And Ann immediately replied: &lsquo;Coming, aunt.&rsquo; &lsquo;Who
  are you talking to?&rsquo; Mrs. Tufnell asked, and as Ann did not answer
  this time, she went on: &lsquo;Is it Mr. Leighton?&rsquo; And Ann said: &lsquo;Yes.
  He is just going.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mrs. Tufnell stood there, waiting. She was half-way down the stairs
  between the first floor and the hall, and she couldn&rsquo;t see Ann or Mr.
  Leighton, but a moment or two later she heard Ann&rsquo;s voice saying quite
  distinctly: &lsquo;Well, good night, Mr. Leighton, see you tomorrow as usual.&rsquo; After
  which the front door was opened, then banged to again, and presently Ann
  came tripping back across the hall.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;You go to bed now, Ann,&rsquo; Mrs. Tufnell said to her. &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll
  see Mr. Jessup off when he goes. He won&rsquo;t be long, now, I daresay.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Oh, but,&rsquo; Ann said, &lsquo;Mr. Jessup has been gone
  some time.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Gone some time?&rsquo; Mrs. Tufnell exclaimed. &lsquo;He can&rsquo;t
  have been gone some time. Why, he was expecting Mr. Leighton, and Mr. Leighton
  has only just gone.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ann shrugged her shoulders: &lsquo;I can only tell you what I know,
  Mrs. Tufnell,&rsquo; she said, acidly. &lsquo;You can come down and see
  for yourself. The office is shut up and all the lights out.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;But didn&rsquo;t Mr. Leighton see Mr. Jessup?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;No, he didn&rsquo;t. Mr. Jessup told Mr. Leighton to wait
  and then he went away without seeing him.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;That&rsquo;s funny,&rsquo; Mrs. Tufnell remarked, dryly. &lsquo;What
  was Mr. Leighton doing in the house, then, all this time? I heard the front
  door bell half an hour ago and more.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;That&rsquo;s no business of yours. Aunt Sarah,&rsquo; the
  girl retorted pertly. &lsquo;And it wasn&rsquo;t half an hour, so there!&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mrs. Tufnell did not argue the point any further. Mechanically she
  went downstairs and ascertained in point of fact that the door of the office
  and the showroom on the ground floor were both locked as usual, and that
  the key of the office was outside in the lock. This was entirely in accordance
  with custom. Mrs. Tufnell, through force of habit, did just turn the key
  and open the door of the office. She just peeped in to see that the lights
  were really all out. Satisfied that everything was dark she then closed and
  relocked the door. Ann, in the meanwhile, stood half -way up the stairs,
  watching. Then the two women went upstairs together. They had only just got
  back in their room when the front door bell rang once more.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Now, whoever can that be?&rsquo; Mrs. Tufnell exclaimed.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t trouble, aunt,&rsquo; Ann said with alacrity. &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll
  run down and see.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Which she did. Again it was some time before she came back, and when she
  did get back to her room she seemed rather breathless and agitated.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Someone for Mr. Jessup,&rsquo; she said in answer to Mrs.,
  Tufnell&rsquo;s rather acid remark that she had been gone a long time. &lsquo;He
  kept me talking ever such a while. I don&rsquo;t think he believed me when
  I said Mr. Jessup had gone.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Who was it?&rsquo; witness asked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rsquo; the girl replied. &lsquo;I never
  saw him before.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Didn&rsquo;t you ask his name?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I did. But he said it didn&rsquo;t matter&#8213; he would
  call again tomorrow.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;After that the two women sat for a little while longer, Mrs. Tufnell
  sewing, and Ann still rather restlessly turning&rsquo; over the pages of
  a magazine. At ten o&rsquo;clock they went to bed. And that was the end of
  the day as far as the household of Mr. Jessup was concerned.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You may well imagine that all the amateur detectives who were present
  at the inquest had made up their minds by now that Arthur Leighton had murdered
  Mr. Seton Jessup, and robbed the till both before and after the crime. It
  was a simple deduction easily arrived at and presenting the usual features.
  A flirty minx, an enamoured young man, extravagance, greed, opportunity and
  supreme temptation. Amongst the public there were many who did not even think
  it worthwhile to hear further witnesses. To their minds the hangman&rsquo;s
  rope was already round young Leighton&rsquo;s neck. Of course I admit that
  at this point it seemed a very clear case. It was only after this that complications
  arose and soon the investigations bristled with difficulties.</p>
  <h3 align="center"><b>4</b></h3>
  <p>&ldquo;After a good deal of tedious and irrelevant evidence had been gone
  through, the inquest was adjourned and the public left the court on the tiptoe
  of expectation as to what the morrow would bring. Nor was anyone disappointed,
  for on the morrow the mystery deepened even though there was plenty of sensational
  evidence for newspaper reporters to feed on.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The police, it seems, had brought forward a very valuable witness
  in the person of the point policeman, who was on duty from eight o&rsquo;clock
  onwards on the evening of the 16th at the corner of Clerkenwell Road and
  Fulton Gardens. Number 13 is only a few yards up the street. The man had
  stated, it seems, that soon after half-past eight he had seen a man come
  along Fulton Gardens from the direction of Holborn, go up to the front door
  of Number 13 and ring the bell. He was admitted after a minute or two and
  he stayed in the house about half an hour. It was a dark night and there
  was a slight drizzle; the witness could not swear to the man&rsquo;s identity.
  He was slight and of middle height and walked like a young man. When he arrived
  he wore a bowler hat and no overcoat, but when he came out again he had an
  overcoat on and a soft grey hat and he carried the bowler in his hand. Witness
  noticed as he walked away up Fulton Gardens towards Finsbury this time he
  took off the soft hat, slipped it into the pocket of his overcoat and put
  on the bowler.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;About ten minutes later, not more, another visitor called at No.
  13. He also was slight and tallish, and he wore an overcoat and a bowler
  hat. He turned into Fulton Gardens from Clerkenwell Road, but on the opposite
  corner to the one where witness was standing. He rang the bell and was admitted
  and stayed about twenty minutes. He walked away in the direction of Holborn.
  Witness would not undertake to identify either of these two visitors: he
  had not been close enough to them to see their faces, and there was a good
  deal of fog that night as well as the drizzle. There was nothing suspicious
  looking about either of the men. They had walked quite openly up to the front
  door, rung the bell and been admitted. The only thing that had struck the
  constable as queer was the way the first visitor had changed hats when he
  walked away.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Witness swore positively that no one else had gone in or out of No.
  13 that night except those two visitors. How important this evidence was
  you will understand presently.</p>
  <p>After this young Tufnell was called. He was a shy-looking fellow, with a
  nervous manner altogether out of keeping with his dark expressive eyes&#8213; eyes
  which he had obviously inherited from his mother and which gave him a foreign
  as well as a romantic appearance. He was said to be musical and to be a talented
  amateur actor. Everyone agreed, it seems, that he had always been a very
  good son to his mother until his love for Ann Weber had absorbed all his
  thoughts and most of his screw. He explained that he was junior clerk to
  Mr Jessup, and as far as he knew had always given satisfaction. On the 16th
  he had also noticed that the guv&rsquo;nor was not quite himself. He appeared
  unusually curt and irritable with everybody. Witness had not been in the
  house all the evening. When his mother told him that neither she nor Ann
  could go to the cinema with him he went off by himself, and after the show
  he went straight back to his digs near the Alexandra Palace. He only heard
  of the tragedy when he arrived at the office as usual on the morning of the
  17th.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;His evidence would have seemed uninteresting and unimportant but
  for the fact that while he gave it he glanced now and again in the direction
  where Ann Weber sat beside her aunt. It seemed as if he were all the time
  mutely asking for her approval of what he was saying, and presently when
  the coroner asked him whether he knew the cause of his employer&rsquo;s irritability,
  he very obviously looked at Ann before he finally said: &lsquo;No, sir, I
  don&rsquo;t!&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;After that Ann Weber was called. Of course it had been clear all
  along that she was by far the most important witness in this mysterious case,
  and when she rose from her place looking very trim and neat in her navy-blue
  coat and skirt, with a jaunty little hat pulled over her left eye, and wearing
  long amber ear-rings that gave her pretty face a piquant expression, everyone
  settled down comfortably to enjoy the sensation of the afternoon.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ann, who was thoroughly self-possessed, answered the coroner&rsquo;s
  preliminary questions quite glibly, and when she was asked to relate what
  occurred at No. 13, Fulton Gardens on the night of the 16th, she plunged
  into her story without any hesitation or trace of nervousness.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;At about half-past eight,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;or it may
  have been later&#8213; I won&rsquo;t swear as to the time&#8213; there was
  a ring at the front door bell. I was down in the pantry and as I came upstairs
  I heard the office door being opened. When I got into the passage I saw Mr.
  Jessup standing in the doorway of the office. He had his spectacles on his
  nose and a pen in his hand. He looked as if he had just got up from his desk.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;If that&rsquo;s young Leighton,&rsquo; he said to me, &lsquo;tell
  him I&rsquo;ll see him tomorrow. I can&rsquo;t be bothered now.&rsquo; Then
  he went back into the office and shut the door.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I opened the door to Mr. Leighton,&rsquo; witness continued, &lsquo;and
  he came in looking very cold and wet. I told him that Mr. Jessup didn&rsquo;t
  want to see him tonight. He seemed very pleased at this but he wouldn&rsquo;t
  go away, and when I told him I was busy, he said that I couldn&rsquo;t be
  so unkind as to turn a fellow out into the rain without giving him a drink.
  Now I could see that already Mr. Leighton had had a bit too much,
  and I told him so quite plainly. But there! he wouldn&rsquo;t take &ldquo;No&rdquo; for
  an answer, and as it really was jolly cold and damp I told him to go and
  sit down in the servants&rsquo; hall while I got him a hot toddy. I went
  down into the kitchen and put the kettle on and cut a couple of sandwiches.
  I don&rsquo;t know where Mr. Leighton was during that time or what he was
  doing. I was in the kitchen some time because I couldn&rsquo;t get the kettle
  to boil as the fire had gone down and we have no gas downstairs.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;When I took the tray into the servants&rsquo; hall Mr. Leighton
  was there, and again I told him that I didn&rsquo;t think he ought to have
  any more whisky, but he only laughed and was rather impudent, so I just put
  the tray down, and then I thought that I would run upstairs and see if Mr.
  Jessup wanted anything. I was rather surprised when I got to the hall to
  see that all the lights up the stairs had been turned off. There&rsquo;s
  a switch down in the hall that turns off the lot. The whole house looked
  very dark. There was but a very little light that came from the lamp at the
  other end of the hall, near the front door.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I was just thinking that I would turn on the lights again
  when I saw what I could have sworn was Mr. Jessup coming out of his office.
  He had already got his hat and coat on, and when he came out of the office
  he shut the door and turned the key in the lock, just as Mr. Jessup always
  did. It never struck me for a moment that it could be anybody but him. Though
  it was dark, I recognised his hat and his overcoat, and his own way of turning
  the key. I spoke to him,&rsquo; witness continued in answer to a question
  put to her by the coroner, &lsquo;but he didn&rsquo;t reply; he just went
  straight through the hall and out by the front door. Then after a bit Mr.
  Leighton came up, and I told him Mr. Jessup had gone. He was quite pleased
  and stopped talking in the hall for a moment, and then aunt called to me and
  Mr. Leighton went away.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Witness was then questioned as to the other visitor who called later
  that same evening, but she stated that she had no idea who it was. &lsquo;He
  came about nine,&rsquo; she explained, &lsquo;and I went down to open the
  door. He kept me talking ever such a time, asking all sorts of silly questions;
  I didn&rsquo;t know how to get rid of him, and he wouldn&rsquo;t leave his
  name. He said he would call again and that it didn&rsquo;t matter.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ann Weber here gave the impression that the unknown visitor had stopped
  for a flirtation with her on the doorstep and her smirking and pert glances
  rather irritated the coroner. He pulled her up sharply by putting a few straight
  questions to her. He wanted to pin her down to a definite statement as to
  the time when (1) she opened the door to Mr. Leighton; (2) she saw what she
  thought was Mr. Jessup go out of the house, and (3) the second visitor arrived.
  Though doubtful as to the exact time, Ann was quite sure that the three events
  occurred in the order in which she had originally related them and in this
  she was, of course, corroborating the evidence of the point policeman.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But there was the mysterious contradiction. Ann Weber swore that
  Mr. Leighton followed her up from the servants&rsquo; hall just after she
  had seen the mysterious individual go out by the front door. On the other
  hand, she couldn&rsquo;t swear what happened while she was busy in the kitchen
  getting the hot toddy for Mr. Leighton. She had been trying to make the fire
  burn up, and had rattled coals and fire-irons. She certainly had not heard
  anyone using the telephone, which was in the office, and she did not know
  where Mr. Leighton was during that time.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nor would she say what was in her mind when first she saw her employer
  lying dead over the desk and exclaimed: &lsquo;My God! He has killed him!&rsquo; And
  when the coroner pressed her with questions, she burst into tears. Except
  for this her evidence had, on the whole, been given with extraordinary self-possession.
  It was a terrible ordeal for a girl to have to stand up before a jury and,
  roughly speaking, to swear away the character of a man with whom she had
  been on intimate terms.... The character, did I say? I might just as well
  have said the life, because whatever doubts had lurked in the public mind
  about Arthur Leighton&rsquo;s guilt, or at least complicity in the crime,
  those doubts were dispelled by the girl&rsquo;s evidence. For I need not
  tell you, I suppose, that every man present that second day at the inquest
  had already made up his mind that Ann Weber was lying to save her sweetheart.
  No one believed in the mysterious impersonator of Mr. Jessup. It was Arthur
  Leighton, they argued, who had murdered his employer and robbed the till,
  and Ann Weber knew it and had invented the story in order to drag a red herring
  across the trail.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I must say that the man himself did not make a good impression when
  he was called in his turn. As he stepped forward with a swaggering air, and
  a bold glance at coroner and jury, the interest which he aroused was not
  a kindly one. He was rather a vulgar-looking creature, with a horsey get-up,
  high collar, stock-tie, fancy waistcoat and so on. His hair was of a ginger
  colour, his eyes light and his face tanned. Everyone noticed that he winked
  at Ann Weber when he caught her eye, and also that the girl immediately averted
  her glance and almost imperceptibly shrugged her shoulders. Thereupon Leighton
  frowned and very obviously swore under his breath.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Questioned as to his doings on the 16th, he admitted that &lsquo;the
  guv&rsquo;nor had been waxy with him, because,&rsquo; as he put it with an
  indifferent swagger, &lsquo;there were a few pounds missing in the till.&rsquo; He
  also admitted that he had not been looking forward to the evening&rsquo;s
  interview, but that he had not dared refuse to come. In order to kill time
  and to put heart into himself, he had gone with a couple of friends to the
  Cafe Royal in Regent Street and they all had whiskies and sodas till it was
  time for him to go to Fulton Gardens. His friends were to wait for him until
  he returned, when they intended to have supper together. Witness then went
  to Fulton Gardens and saw Ann Weber, who told him that the guv&rsquo;nor
  didn&rsquo;t wish to see him. This, according to his own picturesque language,
  was a little bit of all right. He stayed for a few minutes talking to Ann,
  and she gave him a hot toddy. He certainly didn&rsquo;t think he had stayed
  as long as half an hour, but then, when a fellow was taking to a pretty girl...
  eh?... what?...</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The coroner curtly interrupted his fatuous explanations by asking
  him at what time he had left his friends, and at what time he had met them
  again subsequently. Witness was not very sure; he thought he left the Cafe
  Royal about half-past eight, but it might have been earlier or later. He
  took a bus to the bottom of Fulton Gardens. It was beastly cold and wet,
  and he was very grateful to Ann for giving him a hot drink. He denied that
  he had been drinking too much or that he had demanded the hot drink. It was
  Ann Weber who had offered to get it for him. Jolly pretty girl, Annie-bird,
  and not shy. Witness concluded his evidence by swearing positively that he
  had waited in the servants&rsquo; hall all the while that Ann Weber got him
  the toddy; he had followed her down and not gone upstairs or seen anything
  of Mr. Jessup all the time he was in the house. When he left Fulton Gardens
  he tried to get a bus back to Regent Street, but many of them were full and
  it was rather late before he got back to the Cafe Royal.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It was very obvious that as the coroner continued to put question
  after question to him, Arthur Leighton became vaguely conscious of the feeling
  of hostility towards him which had arisen in the public mind. He lost something
  of his swagger, and his face under the tan took on a greyish hue. From time
  to time he glanced at Ann Weber, but she obstinately looked another way.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Undoubtedly he felt that he was caught in a network of damnatory
  evidence which he was unable to combat. The day ended, however, with another
  adjournment; the police wanted a little more time before taking drastic action.
  The public so often blame them for being in too great a hurry to fasten an
  accusation on the flimsiest grounds that one is pleased to record such a
  noteworthy instance when they really did not leave a single stone unturned
  before they arrested Arthur Leighton on the charge of murder. They did everything
  they could to find some proof of the existence and identity of the individual
  whom Ann Weber professed to have seen while Leighton was still in the house.
  But all their efforts in that direction came to naught, whilst Leighton himself
  denied having had an accomplice just as strenuously as he did his own guilt.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He was brought up before the magistrate, charged with the terrible
  crime. No one, the police argued, had so strong a motive for the crime or
  such an opportunity. Alternatively, no one else could have admitted the mysterious
  impersonator of Mr. Jessup into the house, the accomplice who did the deed,
  whilst Leighton engaged Ann Weber&rsquo;s attention, always supposing that
  he did exist, which was never proved, and which the evidence of the police
  constable refuted. People who dabbled in spiritualism and that sort of thing
  were pleased to think that the mysterious personage whom the housemaid saw
  was the ghost of poor old Jessup, who was then lying murdered in his office,
  stricken by Leighton&rsquo;s hand. But even the most physically-minded individual
  was unable to give a satisfactory explanation for the ghost having changed
  hats while he walked away from that fateful No. 13.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Altogether the question of hats played an important role in the drama
  of Leighton&rsquo;s arrest and final discharge. The magistrate did not commit
  him for trial because the case for the prosecution collapsed suddenly like
  a pack of cards. It was the question of hats that saved Leighton&rsquo;s
  neck from the hangman&rsquo;s rope. You remember, perhaps, that in his evidence
  he had stated that before starting to interview his irate employer he had
  been with some friends at the Cafe Royal in Regent Street, and that subsequently
  he met these friends there for supper. Well, although it appeared impossible
  to establish definitely the time when Leighton left the Cafe Royal to go
  to Fulton Gardens, there were two or three witnesses prepared to swear that
  he was back again at a quarter to ten. Now this was very important. It seems
  that his friends who were waiting at the Cafe Royal were getting impatient,
  and at twenty minutes to ten by the clock one of them&#8213; a fellow named
  Richard Hurrill&#8213; said he would go outside and see if he could see anything
  of Leighton. He strolled on as far as Piccadilly Circus where the &rsquo;buses
  stop that come from the City, and a minute or two later he saw Leighton step
  out of one. He seemed a little fuzzy in the head, and Hurrill chaffed him
  a bit. Then he took him by the arm and led him back in triumph to the Cafe
  Royal.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now mark what followed,&rdquo; the funny creature went on, whilst
  all at once his fingers started working away as if for dear life on his bit
  of string. &ldquo;A hat&#8213; a soft grey hat&#8213; with an overcoat wrapped
  round it, were found in the area of a derelict house in Blackhorse Road,
  Walthamstow, close to the waterworks, and identified as the late Mr. Seton
  Jessup&rsquo;s overcoat and hat. I don&rsquo;t suppose that you have the
  least idea where Blackhorse Road, Walthamstow is, but let me tell you that
  it is at the back of beyond in the north-east of London.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If you remember, the point policeman had stated that the first visitor
  had called at No. 13, Fulton Gardens, at half-past eight and stayed half
  an hour. He then walked away in the direction of Finsbury. That visitor,
  the police argued, was Arthur Leighton who had murdered Mr. Jessup and sent
  the telephone message to Fitzjohn&rsquo;s Avenue; then, hearing Ann Weber
  moving about downstairs and frightened at being caught by her, he had put
  on the deceased&rsquo;s hat and coat slipped out of the house. Ann, however,
  had recognised him. She had involuntarily given him away when the housekeeper
  asked her whom she was talking to, so she invented the story of having seen
  what she thought was Mr. Jessup in order to save her sweetheart.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It was a logical theory enough, but here came the evidence of the
  hat. The man who walked away from Fulton Gardens at nine o&rsquo;clock, whom
  the point policeman saw changing his hat in the street at that hour, could
  not possibly have gone all the way to Walthamstow, either by bus or even
  part of the way in a taxi, and back again to Piccadilly Circus all in the
  space of forty-five minutes. And Leighton, mind you, stepped out of a bus
  when his friend met him, and I can tell you that the police worked their
  hardest to find a taxi-man who may have picked up a fare that night in the
  neighbourhood of Clerkenwell and driven out to Walthamstow and then back
  to Holborn. That search proved entirely fruitless.</p>
  <p>On the other hand, Leighton had paid his bus fare from Holborn, and the
  conductor vaguely recollected that he had got in at the corner of Clerkenwell
  Road. Well, that being proved, the man couldn&rsquo;t have done in the time
  all that the prosecution declared that he did.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;After he was discharged, the Press started violently abusing the
  police for not having directed their attention to the second visitor who
  called at Fulton Gardens ten minutes or so after the first one had left.
  But this person appeared as elusive and intangible as the mysterious wearer
  of Mr. Jessup&rsquo;s hat and coat. The point policeman saw him in the distance
  and Ann Weber admitted him into the house and chatted with him for over twenty
  minutes. She didn&rsquo;t know him, but she declared that she could easily
  recognise him if she saw him again. For some time after that the poor girl
  was constantly called upon by the police to see, and if possible identify,
  the mysterious visitor. Half the shady characters in London passed, I believe,
  before her eyes during the next three months. But this search proved as fruitless
  as the other. The murder of Mr. Seton Jessup has remained as complete and
  as baffling a mystery as any in the annals of crime.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Many there are&#8213; you amongst the number&#8213; who firmly believe
  that Arthur Leighton had, at any rate, something to do with it. I know that
  the family of the deceased were convinced that he did. Mr. Aubrey Jessup,
  the eldest son of the deceased, who was one of the executors under his father&rsquo;s
  will, and who had gone through the accounts of the business, had noted certain
  irregularities in Leighton&rsquo;s books; he also declared that various sums
  which had come in on the 16th after banking hours were missing from the safe.
  Moreover, young Leighton himself had admitted that &lsquo;the guv&rsquo;nor
  was waxy with him because a few pounds were missing from the till.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;All these facts, no doubt, had influenced the police when they applied
  for a warrant for his arrest, but there was no getting away from the evidence
  of that hat and coat found ten miles and more away from the scene of the
  crime, and of the bus conductor who could swear that out of forty-five minutes
  which the accused had to account for, he had spent twenty in a bus.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It is all very mysterious,&rdquo; I put in, because my eccentric
  friend had been silent for quite a long time, while his attention was entirely
  taken up by the fashioning of a whole series of intricate knots. &ldquo;I
  am afraid that I was one of those who blamed the police for not directing
  their investigations sooner in the direction of the second visitor. He seems
  to me much, more mysterious than the first. We know who the first one was&#8213;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do we?&rdquo; he retorted with a chuckle. &ldquo;Or rather, do you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, of course, it was Arthur Leighton,&rdquo; I rejoined impatiently. &ldquo;Mrs.
  Tufnell saw him&#8213;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She didn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; he broke in, quickly. &ldquo;The house was
  pitch dark; she heard voices and she asked whether she was speaking to Mr.
  Leighton.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And Ann said yes!&rdquo; I riposted.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She said yes,&rdquo; he admitted with an irritating smile.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And Leighton himself in his evidence&#8213;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Leighton in his evidence.&rdquo; the funny creature broke in excitedly, &ldquo;admitted
  that he had called at the house, he admitted that he remembered vaguely that
  Ann Weber told him that Mr. Jessup had decided not to see him, and that to
  celebrate the occasion he got the girl to make him a whisky toddy. But, apart
  from these facts, he only had the haziest notions as to the time when he
  came and when he left or how long he stayed. Nor were his precious friends
  at the Caf&eacute; Royal any clearer on that point. They had all of them
  been drinking and only had the haziest notion of time until twenty minutes
  to ten, when they got hungry and wanted their supper.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But what does that prove?&rdquo; I argued with an impatient frown.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It proves that my contention is correct; that the first visitor was
  not Leighton, that it was someone for whom Ann Weber cared more than she
  did for Leighton, as she lied for his sake when she told her aunt that she
  was speaking to Leighton in the hall. The whole thing occurred just as the
  police supposed. The first visitor called and while Ann Weber was down in
  the kitchen getting him something to eat and drink, he entered the office,
  probably not with any evil intention, and saw his employer sitting at his
  desk with the safe containing a quantity of loose cash, invitingly open.
  Let us be charitable and assume that he yielded to sudden temptation. Mr.
  Jessup&rsquo;s coat, hat and stick were lying there on a chair. The stick
  was one of those heavily weighted ones which men like to carry nowadays.
  He seizes the stick and strikes the old man on the head with it, then he
  collects the money from the safe and thrusts it into his pockets.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;At that moment Ann Weber comes up the stairs. I say that this man
  was her lover; she had returned to him, as she did once before. Imagine her
  horror first and then her desire&#8213; her mad desire&#8213; to save him
  from the consequences of his crime. It is her woman&rsquo;s wit which first
  suggests the idea of telephoning to Fitzjohn&rsquo;s Avenue: she who thinks
  of plunging the house in darkness. And now to get the criminal out of the
  house. It can be done in a moment, but just then Mrs. Tufnell opens her door
  on the second floor and begins to grope her way downstairs. It is impossible
  to think quickly enough how to meet this situation. Instinct is the only
  guide, and instinct suggests impersonating the deceased, to avoid the danger
  of Mrs. Tufnell peeping in at the office door.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The criminal hastily dons his victim&rsquo;s hat and coat, and he
  is almost through the hall when Mrs. Tufnell calls to Ann:</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Is it Mr. Leighton?&rsquo; and Ann on the impulse of the moment replies: &lsquo;Yes,
  it is! He is just going.&rsquo; And so the criminal escapes unseen. But there
  is still the danger of Mrs. Tufnell peeping in at the office door, so Ann
  invents the story of having seen Mr. Jessup walk out of the house some time
  before. So for the moment danger is averted; the housekeeper does peep in
  at the door, but only in order to satisfy herself that the lights are out,
  and the women then go upstairs together.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ten minutes later there is another ring at the bell. This time it
  is Arthur Leighton and Ann Weber has sufficient presence of mind not to let
  him see that there is anything wrong in the house. She asks him in, she tells
  him Mr. Jessup cannot see him, she gets him a drink and sends him off again.
  I don&rsquo;t suppose for a moment that at this stage she has any intention
  of using him as a shield for her present sweetheart, but undoubtedly the
  thought had by now crept into her mind to utilize Leighton&rsquo;s admitted
  presence in the house for the purpose of confusing the issues. Nor do I think
  that she had any idea that night that Mr. Jessup was dead. She probably thought
  that he had only been stunned by a blow from the stick: hence her exclamation
  when she realised the truth, &lsquo;My God, he has killed him!&rsquo; Then
  only did she concentrate all her energies and all her wits to saving her
  sweetheart&#8213; even at the cost of another man.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Women are like that sometimes,&rdquo; the Man in the Corner went
  on with a chuckle, &ldquo;the instinct of the primitive woman is first of
  all to save her man, never mind at whose expense. The cave-man&rsquo;s instinct
  is to protect his woman with his fists&#8213; but she, conscious of physical
  weakness, sets her wits to work, and if her man is in serious danger, she
  will lie and she will cheat&#8213; aye, and perjure herself if need be. And
  those flirtatious minxes of which Annie-bird is a striking example are only
  cave-women with a veneer of civilisation over them.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She did save her man by dragging a red herring across his trail,
  and she left Fate to deal with Leighton. Once embarked on a system of lies
  she had to stick to it or her man was doomed. Fortunately she could rely
  on the other woman. A mother&rsquo;s wits are even sharper than those of
  a sweetheart.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A mother?&rdquo; I ejaculated. &ldquo;Then you think that it was&#8213;?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mark Tufnell, of course,&rdquo; he broke in, dryly. &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t
  you guess? As he could not go with his beloved to the cinema, he thought
  he would spend a happy evening with her. What made him originally go into
  the office we shall never know. Some trifle, no doubt, some message for his
  employer; it is those sort of trifles that so often govern the destinies
  of men. Personally I think that he was very much in the same boat as young
  Leighton: some trifling irregularities in his account. The deceased speaking
  so harshly to Mrs. Tufnell that night first directed my attention to young
  Tufnell. He didn&rsquo;t want to see any of them that night: he was irritated
  with Mark quite as much as with Leighton, but out of consideration for the
  housekeeper whom he valued he said little about her son.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Perhaps he had ordered the young man to come to his office; as I
  said just now, this little point I cannot vouch for. But if I have not succeeded
  in convincing you that the first visitor at No. 13, Fulton Gardens was Mark
  Tufnell, and that it was he who went out in Mr. Jessup&rsquo;s hat and overcoat,
  changed hats in the street and wandered out as far as Walthamstow in order
  to be rid of the pieces de conviction then you are less intelligent than
  I have taken you to be. Mark Tufnell, remember, lives in the north of London;
  he was supposed to have gone to the cinema that night, therefore the people
  with whom he lodged thought nothing of his coming home late.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That poor mother!&rdquo; I ejaculated, &ldquo;I wonder if she suspects
  the truth.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She knows it,&rdquo; the funny creature said, &ldquo;you may be sure
  of that. There was a bond of understanding between those two women, and they
  never once contradicted each other in their evidence. A worthless young blackguard
  has been saved from the gallows; my sympathy is not with him, but with the
  women who put up such a brave fight for his sake.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do you know what happened to them all subsequently?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not exactly. But I do know that Mr. Seton Jessup in his will left
  his housekeeper an annuity of &pound;50. I also know that young Tufnell has
  gone out to Australia, and that if you ever dine with a friend at the Alcyon
  Club you will notice an exceptionally pretty waitress who will make eyes
  at all the men. Her name is Ann Weber!&rdquo;</p>
  <h2><b><a name="AMoorlandTragedy"></a>A Moorland Tragedy</b> </h2>
  <p>The Man in the Corner had finished his glass of milk and ceased to munch
  his bun; from the capacious pocket of his huge tweed coat he extracted a
  piece of string, and for a while he sat contemplating it, with his head on
  one side, so like one of those bald-headed storks at the Zoo.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I always had a great predilection for that mystery,&rdquo; he said,
  a propos of nothing at all. &ldquo;It still fascinates me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What mystery?&rdquo; I asked; but as usual he took no notice of my
  question.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It was more romantic than the common crimes of today; in fact, I
  don&rsquo;t know if you will agree with me, but to me it has quite an eighteenth-century
  atmosphere about it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If you were to tell me to what particular crime you refer,&rdquo; I
  said coldly, &ldquo;I might tell you whether I agree with you or not.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He looked at me as if he thought me an idiot, then he rejoined dryly:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t mean to say that you have never thought of the Moorland
  Tragedy!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;often!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And don&rsquo;t you think that the story is as romantic as any you
  have read in fiction recently?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, I do think that the story is romantic but only because of its <i>mise
   en sc&egrave;ne</i>. The same thing might have occurred in a London slum,
   and then it would have been merely sordid. Of course it is all very mysterious,
   and I for one have often wondered what has become of that Italian&#8213; I
   forget his name.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Antonio Vissio. A queer creature, wasn&rsquo;t he? And we can well
  imagine with what suspicion he was regarded by the yokels in the neighbouring
  villages. Yorkshire yokels! Just think of them in connection with an exotic
  creature like Vissio. He had a curious history, too. His people owned a little
  farm somewhere in the mountains near Santa Catarina in Liguria, and during
  the war an English Intelligence officer&#8213; Captain Arnott&#8213; lodged
  with them for a time. They were, it seems, extraordinarily kind to him. The
  family consisted of a widow, two daughters, and the son Antonio. As he was
  the only son of a widow, he was, of course, exempt from military service
  and helped his mother to look after the farm.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;His passion, however&#8213; and one, by the way, which is very common
  to Italian peasants&#8213; was shooting. There is very little game in that
  part of Italy, and it means long tramps before you can get as much as a rabbit
  or a partridge; but there was nothing that Antonio loved more than those
  tramps with a gun and a dog, and when Captain Arnott had leisure the two
  of them would go off together at daybreak and never return till late at night.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Sometime in 1917 Captain Arnott was transferred to another front.
  He got his majority the following year, and after the war he retired with
  the rank of Lieut. Colonel. He hadn&rsquo;t seen the Vissio family for some
  time, but he always retained the happiest recollections of their kindness
  to him and of Antonio&rsquo;s pleasant companionship. It was not to be wondered
  at, therefore, that when in 1919 that terrible explosion occurred at the
  fort of Santa Catarina, which was only distant a quarter of a mile from the
  Vissio&rsquo;s farm, Colonel Arnott should at once think of his friends,
  and, as he happened to be at Genoa on business at the time, he motored over
  to Santa Catarina to see if he could ascertain anything of their fate.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He found the village a complete devastation, the isolated farms for
  miles around nothing but masses of wreckage. I don&rsquo;t know how many
  people&#8213; men, women and children&#8213; had been killed, there were
  over two hundred injured, and those who had escaped were herding together
  amongst the ruins of their homes. It was only by dint of perseverance and
  the exercise of an iron will that Colonel Arnott succeeded at last in finding
  Antonio Vissio.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There was nothing left of the farm but dust and ashes. The mother
  and one of the girls had been killed by the falling in of the roof, and the
  younger daughter was being taken care of by some sisters in a neighbouring
  convent which had escaped total destruction. Antonio was left in the world
  all alone, homeless, moneyless; Italy is not like England where at times
  of disaster money comes pouring at once out of the pockets of the much abused
  capitalists to help the unfortunate. There was no money poured out to help
  poor Antonio and his kindred.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Colonel Arnott was deeply moved at sight of the man&rsquo;s loneliness.
  He worked hard to try and get him a job in England right away from the scenes
  of the disaster that must perpetually have awakened bitter memories. Finally
  he succeeded. A friend of his, Lord Crookhaven, who owned considerable property
  in the North Riding, agreed to take Vissio as assistant to one of his gamekeepers,
  a fellow named William Topcoat. Of course this was an ideal life for Antonio.
  He could indulge his passion for shooting to his heart&rsquo;s content, and,
  incidentally, he would learn something of the science of preserving, and
  of the game laws as they exist in all the sporting countries.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t suppose that Antonio ever realised quite how unpopular
  he was from the first in his new surroundings. The Yorkshire yokels looked
  upon him as a dago, and the fact that he had not fought in the war did not
  help matters. During the first six months he did not speak a word of English,
  and even after he had begun to pick up a sentence or two, he always remained
  unsociable. To begin with, he didn&rsquo;t drink: he hated beer and said
  so. He didn&rsquo;t understand cricket and was bored with football. He didn&rsquo;t
  bet and he was frightened of horses. All that he cared for was his gun, and
  he went about his work not only conscientiously but intelligently, took great
  interest in the rearing of young birds and was particularly successful with
  them.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;After he had been in England a year, he fell madly in love with Winnie
  Gooden. And that is how the tragedy began.&rdquo;</p>
  <h3 align="center"><b>2</b></h3>
  <p>&ldquo;An Italian peasant&rsquo;s idea of love is altogether different to
  that of an English yokel. The latter will begin by keeping company with his
  sweetheart: he will walk out with her in the twilight, and sit beside her
  on the stile, chewing the end of a straw and timidly holding her hand. Kisses
  are exchanged and sighs, and usually no end of jokes and chaff. On the whole
  the English yokel is a cheerful lover. Not so the Italian. With him love
  is the serious drama of life; he is always prepared for it to turn to tragedy.
  His love is overwhelming, tempestuous. With one arm he fondles his sweetheart,
  but the other hand is behind his back, grasping a knife.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So it was with Antonio Vissio. Winnie Gooden was the daughter of
  one of the gardeners at Markthwaite Hall, Lord Crookhaven&rsquo;s residence.
  She was remarkably pretty, and I suppose that she was attracted by the silent,
  rather sullen Italian, who, by the way, was extraordinarily good looking.
  Dark eyes, a soft creamy skin, quantities of wavy hair; everyone admitted
  that the two of them made a splendid pair when they walked out together on
  Sunday afternoons. Thanks to the kindness of Colonel Arnott, Vissio had succeeded
  in selling the bit of land on which his farm had stood, so he had a good
  bit of money, too, and though James Gooden, the father, was said to be averse
  to the idea of his daughter marrying a foreigner, it was thought that Winnie
  would talk her father over easily enough if she really meant to have Antonio;
  but people didn&rsquo;t think that she was seriously in love with him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;During the spring of 1922, Mr. Gerald Moville came home from Argentina
  where he was said to be engaged cattle-rearing. He was the youngest son of
  Sir Timor Moville whose property adjoined that of Lord Crookhaven. His arrival
  caused quite a flutter in feminine hearts for miles around, for smart young
  men are scarce in those parts, and Gerald Moville was both good looking and
  smart, a splendid dancer, a fine tennis and bridge player, and, in fact was
  possessed of the very qualities which young ladies of all classes admire,
  and which were so sadly lacking in the other young men of the neighbourhood.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The fact that he had always been very wild, and that it was only
  through joining the Air Force at the beginning of the war that he escaped
  prosecution for some shady transaction in connection with a bridge club in
  London, did not seriously stand against him, at any rate with the ladies;
  the men, perhaps, cold-shouldered him at first, and he was not made an honorary
  member of the County Club at Richmond, but he was welcome at all their tea
  and garden parties, the dances and the tennis matches throughout the North
  Riding, and in social matters it is, after all, the ladies who rule the roost.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The Movilles, moreover, were big people in the neighbourhood, whom
  nobody would have cared to offend. The eldest son was Colonel commanding
  a smart regiment&#8213; I forget which; one daughter had married an eminent
  K.C., and the other was the wife of a bishop; so for the sake of the family,
  if for no other reason, Gerald Moville was accepted socially and his peccadilloes,
  of which it seems there was more than the one in connection with the bridge
  club, were conveniently forgotten; besides which it was declared that he
  was now a reformed character. He had joined the Air Force quite early in
  the war, been a prisoner of the Germans until 1919 when he went out to Argentina
  where he had made good, and where, it was said, he was making a huge fortune.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;This rumour also helped, no doubt, to make Gerald Moville popular,
  even though he himself had laughingly sworn on more than one occasion that
  he was not a marrying man: he was in love with too many girls ever to settle
  down with one. He certainly was a terrible flirt and gave all the pretty
  girls of the neighbourhood a very good time; he had hired a smart little
  two-seater at Richmond, and motor excursions, lunches at the Wheatsheaf at
  Reeth, jade ear-rings or wrist-watches&#8213; the girls, who were ready to
  flirt with him and to amuse him could get anything they wanted out of him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But it was soon pretty evident that though Gerald Moville flirted
  with many, it was Winnie Gooden whom he admired the most. From the first
  he ran after that girl in a way that scandalised the village gossips. She,
  of course, was flattered by his attentions, but did not show the slightest
  inclination to throw Antonio over. She was sensible enough to know that Gerald
  Moville would never marry her, and she made it very clear that though he
  amused her, her heart would remain true to her Italian lover. But here was
  the trouble. Antonio was not the man to run in double harness. His fiery
  Southern blood rose in revolt against any thought of rivalry. He had won
  Winnie&rsquo;s love and meant to hold it against all comers, and more than
  once in public and in private he threatened to do for any man who came between
  him and Winnie.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You would have thought that those who were in the know would have
  foreseen the tragedy from the moment that Winnie Gooden started to flirt
  with Gerald Moville; nevertheless when it did occur there was universal surprise
  quite as much as horror, and there seemed to be no one clever enough to understand
  the psychological problem that was the true key of that so-called mystery.&rdquo;</p>
  <h3 align="center"><b>3</b></h3>
  <p>&ldquo;Lord Crookhaven&rsquo;s property, you must know,&rdquo; the Man in
  the Corner resumed, after a moment&rsquo;s pause, &ldquo;extends right over
  Markthwaite Moor, which is a lonely stretch of country, intersected by gullies,
  down which, during the heavy rains in spring and autumn, the water rushes
  in torrents. There are one or two disused stone quarries on the moor, and,
  except for the shooting season when Lord Crookhaven has an occasional party
  of sportsmen to stay with him at the Hall, who are out after the birds all
  day, this stretch of country is singularly desolate.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Topcoat&rsquo;s cottage, where Vissio lodged, is on the edge of the
  moor on the Markthwaite side; about a couple of miles away to the north the
  moor is intersected by the secondary road which runs from Kirkby Stephen
  and joins up with the main road at Richmond, and three or four miles again
  to the north of the road is the boundary wall that divides Lord Crookhaven&rsquo;s
  property from that of his neighbour Sir Timothy Moville.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It was in September 1922 that the tragedy occurred which made Markthwaite
  Moor so notorious at the time. Topcoat was walking across the moor in the
  company of the Italian, both carrying their guns, when about half a mile
  away, on the further side of the quarry known as the Poacher&rsquo;s Leap,
  the gamekeeper spied a man who appeared to be crouching behind some scrub.
  Without much reflection he pointed his crouching figure out to Vissio and
  said: &ldquo;&lsquo;There&rsquo;s a fellow who is up to no good. After the
  birds again, the damned thief. Run along, my lad, and see if you can&rsquo;t
  put a shot or two into his legs.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Topcoat swore subsequently, that when he said this, he had not recognised
  who the crouching figure was. But he was a very hard man where poachers were
  concerned; he had been much worried with them lately, and a day or two ago
  had been reprimanded by Lord Crookhaven for want of vigilance. This, no doubt,
  had irritated his temper, and made him rather &lsquo;jumpy.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Vissio, with his gun on his shoulder, went off in the direction of
  the Poacher&rsquo;s Leap. Topcoat watched him until a bit of sharply rising
  ground hid him from sight. A moment or two later the crouching figure stood
  up and Topcoat recognised Mr. Gerald Moville. He had always had exceptionally
  fine sight, and Mr. Moville had certain tricks of gait and movement which
  were unmistakable even at that distance. Topcoat immediately shouted to Vissio
  to come back, but apparently the Italian did not hear him, and the last thing
  that the gamekeeper saw on that eventful morning was Mr. Moville suddenly
  turn and walk towards the high bit of ground behind which Vissio had just
  disappeared.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And that was the last,&rdquo; my eccentric neighbour concluded with
  a chuckle all his own, &ldquo;that has been seen up to this hour of those
  two men, Mr. Gerald Moville and Antonio Vissio. Topcoat waited for a while
  on the moor, and called to the Italian several times, but as he heard nothing
  in response and as it had started to rain heavily, he finally went home.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Vissio did not turn up at the cottage the whole of that day, and
  he did not come home that night. The following morning, which was a Thursday,
  Topcoat walked across to the Goodens&rsquo; cottage to make enquiries, but
  no one had seen the Italian and Winnie knew nothing about him. The gamekeeper
  waited until the Saturday before he informed the police; that, of course,
  was a serious delay which ought never to have occurred, but you have to know
  that class of north country yokel intimately to appreciate this man&rsquo;s
  conduct throughout the affair. They all have a perfect horror of anything
  to do with the police. The type of delinquency most frequent in these parts
  is, of course, poaching, and the gamekeepers on the big estates look on themselves
  as the only efficient police for those cases. Half the time they don&rsquo;t
  turn the delinquent over to the magistrates at all, and administer a kind
  of rough justice as they think best. They hate police interference.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In this case we must also bear Topcoat&rsquo;s subsequent statement
  in mind, which was that at first no suspicion of foul play had entered his
  head. He had not heard the report of a gun, and all he feared was that the
  Italian had tried to pick a quarrel with Mr. Moville and been soundly punished
  for his impertinence, and that probably he did not dare show his face until
  the trouble had blown over. Topcoat, however, spent a couple of days scouring
  the moor for the missing man, in case he had met with an accident and was
  lying somewhere unable to move.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;On the second day he found Vissio&rsquo;s gun lying in a gully close
  to the Poacher&rsquo;s Leap; it had not been discharged, and the next day&#8213; that
  is, on the Saturday&#8213; he, very reluctantly went to the police. Even
  then he made no mention of Mr. Gerald Moville; he only said that his assistant,
  an Italian named Antonio Vissio, who lodged with him,&#8213; had not been
  home for three days, and that he had last seen him on Markthwaite Moor on
  the previous Wednesday carrying a gun and walking in the direction of the
  Poacher&rsquo;s Leap.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Poachers, of course, were at once suspected; Topcoat referred vaguely
  to Vissio having gone after a man whose movements had appeared suspicious.
  He was severely blamed for having delayed so long before informing the police;
  even if the Italian had not been the victim of foul play he might, it was
  argued, have met with a serious accident, and been lying for days, perhaps,
  with a broken leg out in the cold and wet, and might even have perished of
  exposure and neglect. But this latter theory Topcoat would not admit. He
  had scoured the moor, he declared, from end to end; if Vissio had been lying
  anywhere, he swore that he would have found him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Another three or four days were now spent by the police in scouring
  the moor, and it was only after a last fruitless search that Topcoat mentioned
  the fact that he had seen Mr. Gerald Moville the very morning and close to
  the spot where Vissio disappeared: that, as a matter of fact, he was the
  man after whom the Italian had gone, and that the two have met somewhere
  near the north end of the Poacher&rsquo;s Leap.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of course to the general public&#8213; to you, for instance&#8213; Topcoat&rsquo;s
  attitude of reticence all this while must seem positively criminal; but it
  is useless to measure the conduct of people of that class in remote north-country
  districts by the ordinary rules of common sense. For a man in Topcoat&rsquo;s
  position to connect &lsquo;one of the gentry&rsquo; with the disappearance
  of a gamekeeper&rsquo;s assistant&#8213; and a foreigner at that&#8213; would
  seem as preposterous as to imagine that the King of England would go poaching
  on his neighbour&rsquo;s estate. It simply couldn&rsquo;t be, and when the
  D.C.C., to whom Topcoat first made this statement, rebuked him with unusual
  severity, the gamekeeper turned sulky and declared that he didn&rsquo;t see
  he had done anything wrong.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;More than a week you see had elapsed since that Wednesday morning
  when Vissio had last been seen alive; for the past four days the police had
  worked very hard, but entirely in the dark. Now at last they felt that they
  had a glimmer of light to guide them in their search. The public, who had
  taken some interest at first in the Moorland Mystery, was beginning to tire
  of reading about this fruitless search for a missing dago. But now, suddenly,
  the mystery had taken a sensational turn. Topcoat&rsquo;s statement had found
  its way into the local papers and Mr. Gerald Moville&rsquo;s name was whispered
  in connection with the case. And hardly had the lovers of sensation recovered
  from this first shock of surprise, when they received another that was even
  more staggering.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mr. Gerald Moville, it seems, had left home on the very day that
  Vissio disappeared, and his people were without news of him. Just think what
  this sensational bit of news meant! It evoked at once in the mind of the
  imaginative, a drama of love and jealousy, a real romance such as is only
  dreamt of in the cinema, with an Italian dago as the jealous lover, and a
  handsome young Englishman as the victim of that jealousy. The police, holding
  on to this clue, turned their attention to the investigation of Mr. Gerald
  Moville&rsquo;s movements on the morning of that eventful Wednesday: they
  had to go very tactfully to work so as not to cause alarm to Sir Timothy
  and Lady Moville.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It seems that Mr. Gerald had, on the Monday previously, announced
  his sudden intention to return immediately to Argentina. According to statements
  made by one or two of the servants, he did this at breakfast one morning
  after he had received a couple of official-looking letters that bore the
  Buenos Ayres&rsquo; postmark. Lady Moville had been very distressed at this,
  and she and Sir Timothy tried to dissuade Mr. Gerald from going quite so
  soon; but he was quite determined to go, saying that there was some trouble
  at the farm which he must see to at once or it would mean a severe loss,
  not only to himself but to his partner. He finally announced that he would
  have to go up to London on the Wednesday at latest to see about getting a
  berth, if possible, in a boat that left Southampton for Buenos Ayres the
  following Saturday. Preparations for his departure were made accordingly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;On the Tuesday the chauffeur took his luggage to Richmond and saw
  to its being sent off to London in advance. It was addressed to the
  Carlton Hotel. On the Wednesday Mr. Gerald had breakfast at half-past six
  as he wished to make an early start; he was going to drive the little two-seater
  back to the place in Richmond whence he had hired it, and then take the train
  that would take him to Dalton in time to catch the express up to London.
  He had said goodbye to his parents the evening before, and, having tipped
  all the servants lavishly, he made a start soon after seven.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Two labourers going to their work saw the little car speeding along
  the road that intersects the moor; according their statement there were two
  people in the car, a man and a woman. They thought that the man who was driving
  might have been Mr. Moville, but the woman had on a thick veil and they had
  not particularly noticed who she was. On other hand one witness had seen
  the car standing unattended on the roadside within a hundred yards of a group
  of cottages one of which was occupied by Gooden. Whereupon Winnie was taken
  to task by the police. Amidst a flood of tears she finally confessed that
  she had seen Mr. Moville on the Wednesday morning. He had called for her
  in his car very early; her father had only just gone to work, so it could
  not have much later than seven o&rsquo;clock; he told her that he had some
  business to attend to in Richmond, would she like to come for a run and have
  lunch there with him. To this she willingly assented. On the way Mr. Moville
  told her that as a matter of fact he was going away for good, and that he
  could not possibly live without her. He begged her to come away with him;
  he would take her to London first and buy everything she wanted in the way
  of clothes, and then they would go on to Paris and travel all over the world
  and be the happiest couple on this earth.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It seems that the girl at first was carried away by his eloquence;
  she was immensely flattered and thrilled by this romantic adventure, until
  something he said, or didn&rsquo;t say, some expression or some gesture&#8213; Winnie
  couldn&rsquo;t say what it was&#8213; but something seemed to drag her back.
  Probably it was just sound Yorkshire common sense. Anyway she took fright,
  turned a deaf ear to Gerald Moville&rsquo;s blandishments, and insisted on
  being taken back to her father&rsquo;s cottage at once.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Still to the accompaniment of a flood of tears Winnie went on to
  say that Mr. Gerald &lsquo;carried on terribly&rsquo; when she finally refused
  to go away with him and he reproached her bitterly for having played with
  him, all the while that she was in love with that &lsquo;dirty dago.&rsquo; But
  Winnie was firm and in the end the disappointed lover had to turn the car
  back and take the girl home again. It was then close upon nine o&rsquo;clock.
  Mr. Gerald drove her to within half a mile of her father&rsquo;s cottage;
  here she got out and walked the rest of the way home. She had not seen Mr.
  Moville since. On the other hand one of the neighbours told her that soon
  after she went off in the car that morning, Antonio Vissio had called at
  the cottage, and seemed in a terrible way when he was told that she had gone
  out with Mr. Moville.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;As you see the mystery was deepening. Instead of the one missing
  man, there were now two who had disappeared, and the question was what had
  become of Mr. Gerald Moville and his car. Enquiries at the garage where it
  belonged brought no light upon the subject. The car had not been returned,
  and nothing had been seen in Richmond of Mr. Moville or the car. Enquiries
  were then telegraphed all over the place and twenty-four hours later the
  car was traced to a small place called Falconblane, which is about twelve
  miles from Paisley, where it was left at a garage late on the Wednesday night
  by a man who had never since been to claim it.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The people at the garage could only give a vague description, of
  this man. It was about eleven o&rsquo;clock, a very dark night and just upon
  closing time. The man wore a big motor-coat and a cap with flaps over the
  ears; he had on a pair of goggles, and the lower part of his face looked
  coated with grime. It would be next to impossible to swear to his identity,
  but the assistant who took charge of the car said that the man spoke broken
  English. The police searched the car and found a handbag containing a number
  of effects such as a man would take with him if he was going on a long train
  journey: brush and comb, a novel, a couple of handkerchiefs and so on. Some
  of these effects bore the initials G. M.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Pursuing their investigations further the police discovered that
  a man wearing a big motor-coat, goggles and a cap with flap-ears had taken
  a first-class ticket for Glasgow at Beith, which is a small place on a local
  branch line, in the early morning of Thursday, and had travelled to Glasgow
  by the 7.5 am. Glasgow being a very busy terminus no one appears to have
  noticed him there, but one of the porters found a motor-coat, a cap and a
  pair of goggles in one of the first-class carriages on the local from Beith,
  and a certain Mr. Etty, who was a gentleman&rsquo;s outfitter in the Station
  Road, stated that he had a customer in his shop early on Thursday morning
  who purchased a tweed cap and an overcoat off the peg. He had come in without
  either hat or coat, his face and hands were black with grime, and his hair
  looked covered with coal dust.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He explained that he was an engineer who had been engaged all night
  on some salvage work down the line, where there had been a breakdown, and
  that he had somehow lost his coat and his cap. He paid for the goods with
  a &pound;5 note which he took from a case out of his pocket, and the case
  appeared to be bulging over with notes. Mr. Etty thought that he might possibly
  be able to identify the man if he saw him again; one thing he did note about
  him, and that was that spoke broken English.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But from that moment, in spite of strenuous efforts the part of the
  police, all traces of the man with the dirty face who spoke broken English
  vanished completely. And what&rsquo;s more all trace of Mr. Gerald Moville
  had also vanished. He did not go up to London, and all this while his luggage
  was at the Carlton Hotel waiting to be claimed. Nor was it ever claimed by
  him, because about a month after that tragic Wednesday in September the body
  of Mr. Gerald Moville was found in a &lsquo;gruff&rsquo; or gully about three
  quarters of a mile from the Poacher&rsquo;s Leap. When I say that the body
  was found, I am wrong, for it was only a part of the body and that, of course,
  was completely decomposed. The head was missing and it was never found, in
  spite of the most strenuous efforts on the part of professional and amateur
  detectives, and lavish expenditure of money, thought and trouble on the part
  of Sir Timothy Moville. It lies buried, I imagine, somewhere on the moor.
  The clothes, though sodden, were, however, still recognisable, also the unfortunate
  man&rsquo;s wrist-watch, which had stopped at five minutes past eleven, his
  cuff-links, and his signet ring which had fallen from his fleshless finger
  and lay beside it in the &lsquo;gruff.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And about seventy yards higher up the gully a search-party found
  a knife of obviously foreign make, which still bore certain stains, which
  scientific analysis proved to be human blood. That knife was identified by
  Topcoat as the property of Vissio.&rdquo;</p>
  <h3 align="center"><b>4</b></h3>
  <p>The Man in the Corner had been silent for a little while, as was his habit
  when he reached a certain stage of his narrative. At such moments it always
  seemed as if nothing in the world interested him, except the fashioning of
  innumerable and complicated knots in a bit of string. It was my business
  to set him talking again.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of course there was an inquest after that,&rdquo; I said casually.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, there was,&rdquo; he replied dryly, &ldquo;but it revealed nothing
  that the public did not already know. A few minor details&#8213; that was
  all. For instance, it came to light that when Mr. Moville left home on that
  fateful morning he was wearing the coat, cap and goggles which were subsequently
  found in the train at Glasgow station. It was easy to suppose that the murderer
  had stolen these from his victim, the cap and goggles being especially useful
  for purposes of disguise. The same supposition applies to money. Vissio,
  it was argued, had probably only a few shillings in his pocket when in a
  moment of mad jealousy he killed Gerald Moville.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That, of course, was the universally accepted theory, it was only
  desperate necessity that pushed him on to robbing the dead. Topcoat and others
  who knew Antonio well, declared that he was quite harmless except where Winnie
  Gooden was concerned, but it was more than likely that that morning he was
  tortured by one of his jealous fits. He had hated Gerald Moville from the
  first, and, according to the girl&rsquo;s own admissions, she must have given
  him definite cause for jealousy. That very morning he had called at her cottage
  and found that she had gone out with his rival. Perhaps he knew that Moville
  was going away for good. Perhaps he guessed that he would try and induce
  Winnie to go with him. With such torturing fears in his heart, what wonder
  that when he met his rival on the lonely moor he &lsquo;saw red,&rsquo; and
  used his knife as Southerners, unfortunately, are only too apt to do?</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The coroner&rsquo;s jury returned a verdict of wilful murder against
  Antonio Vissio, and the police hold a warrant for his arrest. But more than
  two years have gone by since then, and Vissio has succeeded in eluding the
  police. For many weeks the public were deeply interested in the mystery the
  evening papers used to come out with the headlines; &lsquo;Where is Antonio
  Vissio?&rsquo; and one great daily offered a reward of &pound;500 for information
  that would lead to his apprehension. But, as you know, it has all been in
  vain. The public want to know how a man of unusual personality and speaking
  broken English could possibly lie perdu so long in this tight little island.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And if he did leave the country, then how did he do it? He hadn&rsquo;t
  his passport with him, as that remained with his effects at Topcoat&rsquo;s
  Cottage. How then did he evade the passport officials at Glasgow or any other
  port of embarkation? It is done sometimes, we all know that, and in this
  case Vissio had four days&rsquo; start before Topcoat gave information to
  police, but somehow the newspaper-reading public felt that if Vissio got
  out of the country, something would have betrayed him, someone would have
  seen him and furnished the first clue that would lead to discovery.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And so the disappearance of the Italian has been classed as one of
  the unsolved mysteries in the annals of crime. But to me the only point on
  which I am not absolutely clear (although even there I hold a theory), is
  why Gerald Moville should have gone wandering about the moor, after he had
  parted from Winnie Gooden, and when he hadn&rsquo;t very much time left to
  catch his train, if he didn&rsquo;t want to miss his connection at Dalton.
  That point did strike Inspector Dodsworth of the C.I.D who had been sent
  down from London to assist the local police in the investigation of the crime.
  I know Dodsworth very well, and he and I discussed that point once or twice.
  Of course I was not going to give him the key to the whole mystery&#8213; a
  key, mind you, which I had discovered for myself&#8213; but I didn&rsquo;t
  object to talking over one or two of the minor details with the man, and
  I told him that in my opinion Moville undoubtedly went out on the moor in
  order to meet Vissio and have it out with him on the subject of Winnie.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He wanted Winnie&#8213; badly&#8213; to come away with him, and I
  believe that he was just the sort of man who would think that he could bribe
  the Italian to stand aside for him, by offering him money. I believe those
  half-bred Spaniards and Portuguese out in Argentina are a most corrupt and
  venal lot, and Gerald Moville classed Vissio amongst that lot. I have no
  doubt whatever in my mind that Moville was walking across the moor to see
  if he couldn&rsquo;t find Vissio in Topcoat&rsquo;s cottage. It was obviously
  not for me to tell the police that the Poacher&rsquo;s, Leap is in a direct
  line between that cottage and the place where the two-seater was seen at
  a standstill on the roadside. But Dodsworth had to admit that I was right
  on that point.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then you think,&rdquo; I rejoined, &ldquo;that Mr. Moville, after
  he parted from Winnie Gooden, set out to seek an interview with Antonio Vissio
  with a view to enter into an arrangement with him about the girl.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes!&rdquo; my eccentric friend assented with a nod.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He wanted to bribe Vissio to stand aside for him?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Exactly.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then,&rdquo; I went on, &ldquo;he met Vissio on the moor?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Came out with his proposition?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Which so enraged the Italian that he knocked the other man down and
  finally knifed him in accordance with the amiable custom of his country.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; the Man in the Corner retorted drily, &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t
  say that.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But we know that the two men met and that&#8213;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And that one of them was killed,&rdquo; he broke in quickly. &ldquo;But
  that man was not Gerald Moville.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He was seen,&rdquo; I argued, &ldquo;at Falconblane, at Beith and
  at Glasgow. The man with the dirty face, the motor-coat, and the goggles.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Exactly,&rdquo; he broke in once more. &ldquo;The man in the cap
  with the flap-ears, and wearing motor goggles; the man whose face and hair
  were in addition covered with grime. An excellent disguise, as it indeed
  proved to be.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But the foreign accent. The man spoke broken English.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There are few things,&rdquo; he said, with a sarcastic smile, &ldquo;that
  are easier to assume than broken English, especially when only uneducated
  ears are there to hear.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then you think&#8213;?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think,&rdquo; he replied curtly, &ldquo;I know. I know
  that Gerald Moville met the Italian on the moor, that he quarrelled with
  him over Winnie Gooden, that he knocked him down, and that Vissio was killed
  in the fall. I can see the whole scene as plainly as if I had been there.
  Can&rsquo;t you see Moville realising that he had killed the man?&#8213; that
  inevitably suspicion would fall on him? Topcoat had seen him, witnesses had
  seen his car in the road, he was known to be the Italian&rsquo;s rival in
  Winnie&rsquo;s affections! Already he could feel the hangman&rsquo;s rope
  round his neck. But we must look on Gerald Moville as a man of resource,
  a man, above all, up to many tricks; for drawing a red herring across the
  trail of his own delinquencies.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I will spare you the details of what I can see in my own mind as
  having happened after Moville had realised that Vissio was dead: the stripping
  of the body, the exchange of clothes down to the vest and shirt, the mutilation
  of the corpse with the victim&rsquo;s own knife, and the dragging of the
  body to a distant &lsquo;gruff&rsquo; where it must inevitably remain hidden
  for days, until advanced decomposition had set in to efface all identification
  marks.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Fear no doubt lent ingenuity, and strength to the miscreant; and,
  as a matter of fact, Gerald Moville is one of the few criminals who committed
  no appreciable blunder when he set to work to obliterate all traces of his
  crime; he left the knife with its tell-tale stains on the spot, and that
  knife was identified as the property of the Italian, and the head which alone
  might have betrayed him, even if the body were not found for weeks, he took
  away with him to bury somewhere far away&#8213; goodness only knows where,
  but somewhere between Yorkshire and Scotland.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I can see Gerald Moville after he had accomplished his grim task
  making his way back to his car&#8213; the loneliness of this stretch of country
  would be entirely in his favour, more especially as it had begun to rain;
  I can see him driving along putting mile upon mile between himself and the
  scene of his crime. At one place he stopped&#8213; a lonely spot it must have
  been&#8213; where he disposed of his gruesome burden; then on and on, past
  the borders of Yorkshire, of Westmoreland and Cumberland and into Scotland,
  till he came close to the network of railway round about Paisley and Glasgow.
  Falconblane, a village tucked away on a lonely bit of country but boasting
  of a garage, must have seemed an ideal spot wherein to abandon the car altogether
  and take to the road, and this Moville did, trusting to the long night, and
  also to luck, to further efface his traces. Again I can see him wandering
  restlessly through the dark hours of that night, not daring to enter a house
  and ask for a bed, determined at all costs to obliterate every vestige of
  his movements since the crime.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then in the morning he takes train for Glasgow, the busiest centre
  wherein a man can disappear in a crowd; in the train he takes the precaution
  of divesting himself of the motor-coat, the goggles and the cap, but not
  of the grime that covers his face and hair. We know how he provided himself
  with a more suitable hat and coat; we know how all through his wanderings
  he kept up his broken English. At Glasgow all traces of him vanish; he has
  become a very ordinary-looking man, wearing quite ordinary clothes, and in
  Glasgow people are far too busy to take much notice of passers-by.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We can easily conjecture how easy it was for Moville to leave the
  country altogether. He had plenty of money and it is never difficult for
  a man of resource to leave a British port for any destination he pleases,
  especially if he is of obviously British nationality. Money we all know will
  accomplish anything, and rogues will slip through a cordon of officials where
  the respectable citizens will be chivvied about and harassed with regulations.
  Moreover, we must always bear this in mind that the police were not on his
  track, nor on that of the Italian for that matter. Moville was free to come
  and go, and you may be sure that he was quite clever enough not to behave
  in any way that might create suspicion.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The Man in the Corner paused quite abruptly. A complicated knot was absorbing
  his whole attention. I felt thoughtful, meditative, and after a few minutes&rsquo; silence
  I put my meditations into words.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That is all very well,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;but, personally, I don&rsquo;t
  see that you have anything definite this time on which to base your theory.
  Both the men have disappeared; the police say that Vissio killed Moville;
  you assert the reverse and declare that Moville deliberately dressed up the
  body of the Italian in his own clothes, but you have nothing more to go on
  for your assertion than the police have for theirs.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I was waiting for that,&rdquo; he rejoined with a dry chuckle. &ldquo;But
  let me assure you that I have at least three psychological facts to go on
  for my assertion, whereas the police only go on two very superficial matters
  for theirs; they base their whole argument firstly on the clothes, watch,
  jewellery and so on found on a body that was otherwise unidentifiable, and
  secondly on a blood-stained knife known to have belonged to the Italian.
  Now I have demonstrated to you have I not, how easy it was for Moville to
  manufacture both these pieces of evidence. So mark the force of my argument,&rdquo; the
  funny creature went on, gesticulating with his thin hands like a scarecrow
  blown by the wind. &ldquo;First of all, why did Moville suddenly declare
  his intention of leaving England? In order to look after his partner&rsquo;s
  affairs? Not a bit of it. He left England because of some shady transaction
  out there in Argentina which was coming to light, and because of which he
  thought it best to disappear altogether for a time.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My proof for this? you will ask. The simple proof that his parents
  accepted his disappearance for a whole week without making any enquiries
  about him either in Richmond, or London or the Shipping Company that controls
  the steamers to Buenos Ayres. Can you imagine that Sir Timothy Moville, having
  seen the last of his son on the Tuesday evening, would say and do nothing,
  when he was left eight days without news; he would have enquired in London;
  he knew to which hotel his son intended to go; someone would have enquired
  at Richmond whether the car had been left there. But no! There was not a
  single enquiry made for Gerald Moville by his parents, or his brothers and
  sisters, until after Topcoat had mentioned his name to the police and the
  latter had started their investigations.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And why? Because his people knew where he was; that is to say they
  knew&#8213; or some of them knew&#8213; that Gerald had to lie low, at any
  rate for a time. Of course his supposed death, under such tragic circumstances,
  must have been a terrible shock to them, but it is a remarkable fact you
  will admit that the offer of a substantial reward for the apprehension of
  the murderer did not come from Sir Timothy Moville; it came from one of the
  big dailies out for publicity.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My whole argument rests on psychological grounds, and in criminal
  cases psychology is by far the surest guide. Now there was not a single detail
  in connection with the Moorland Tragedy that in any way suggested the hand
  of a man like Antonio Vissio. Can you see an Italian peasant, who, moreover,
  has lived all his life with a gun in his hand, solemnly laying that gun down
  before embarking on a quarrel with his rival? And yet the gun was found undischarged,
  lying in a gully. Vissio was much more likely to have shouldered it at sight
  of the man he hated and shot him dead, more especially as the Englishman
  would have an enormous advantage in a hand to hand fight, even if the other
  man had suddenly whisked out a knife.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Vissio was not the type of man who would think of the consequences
  of his crime. Maddened by jealousy, he would kill his man at sight, but in
  his own country and also in France, there would be no disgrace attached to
  such a deed&#8213; no disgrace and very little punishment. The man who last
  year shot the English dancing girl on the Riviera because he thought that
  she was carrying on with another man, only got five years&rsquo; imprisonment;
  Vissio would not realise that he would be amenable to English law, which
  does not look on homicide quite so leniently.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Having killed his rival, the Italian would, in all probability, have
  swanked as far as the nearest village, had a good drink to steady his nerves,
  and then have boasted loudly of what he had done, certain that he would be
  leniently dealt with by a judge, and sympathised with by a jury, because
  of the torments of jealousy which he had endured until he could do so no
  longer. You can&rsquo;t imagine such a man sawing off his victim&rsquo;s
  head and wrapping it up in a newspaper taken out of the dead man&rsquo;s
  pocket.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And this brings me to the final point in my argument, and one which
  ought to have struck the police from the first: the question of the car.
  How would Vissio know that he would find Moville&rsquo;s car conveniently
  stationed by the roadside? He would have to know that before he could dare
  walk across the moor, carrying his gruesome parcel. Now Vissio couldn&rsquo;t
  possibly know all that, and what&rsquo;s more, though he might not have been
  altogether ignorant of driving, he certainly was not expert enough to drive
  a car, all by himself for over a hundred miles, at top speed and for several
  hours in the dark.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;To my mind, if this fact had been driven home to the jury by a motoring
  expert they never would have brought in a verdict against Vissio, and if
  you think the whole matter over you will be bound to admit that there is
  not a single flaw in my argument. From the point of view of possibility as
  well as of psychology, only one man could have committed that crime and that
  was Gerald Moville. I suppose his unfortunate parents will know the truth
  one day. Soon, probably, when the young miscreant is short of money and writes
  home for funds.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Or else he may return to Argentina and under an assumed name start
  life anew. They are not over particular there as to a man&rsquo;s antecedents.
  They will, perhaps, think all the more of him, when they know that where
  a girl is concerned he will stand no nonsense from a rival. Think it all
  over, you&rsquo;ll come to the conclusion that I&rsquo;m right.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He gathered up his bit of string and took the spectacles from off his nose.
  For the first time I saw his pale, shrewd eyes looking down straight at me.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I shan&rsquo;t see you again for some time,&rdquo; he said with a
  wry smile. &ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you shake hands and wish me luck?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Indeed I will,&rdquo; I replied, &ldquo;but you are not going away,
  are you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He gave a curious, short, dry chuckle:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I am going out of England for the benefit of my health,&rdquo; he
  said coolly.</p>
  <p>I hadn&rsquo;t shaken hands with him, because the very next moment he had
  turned his back on me as if he thought better of it. The next morning I read
  in the papers a curious account of some extensive robberies committed in
  the neighbourhood of Hatton Garden. The burglar had managed to escape, but
  the police were said to hold an important clue. A curious feature about those
  robberies was the way in which a knotted cord had been used to effect an
  entrance through a skylight. The newspaper reporters gave a very full description
  of this cord: it was photographed and reproduced in the illustrated papers.
  The knots in it were of a wonderful and intricate pattern.</p>
  <p>They set me thinking&#8213; and wondering!</p>
  <p>I have often been to that blameless tea-shop in Fleet Street since. But
  the Man in the Corner is never there now, and the police have never been
  able to trace the large consignment of diamonds stolen from that shop in
  Hatton Garden and which has been valued at &pound;80,000.</p>
  <p>I wonder if I shall ever see my eccentric friend again.</p>
  <p>Somehow I think that I shall. And if I do shall I see him sitting in his
  accustomed corner, with his spectacles on his nose, and his long, thin fingers
  working away at a bit of string&#8213; fashioning knots&#8213; many knots&#8213; complicated
  knots&#8213; like those in the cord by the aid of which an entrance was effected
  into that shop in Hatton Garden and diamonds worth &pound;80,000 were stolen.</p>
  <p>I wonder!!</p>
