<h1><a name="S01"><i>NEIGHBOUR ROSICKY</i></a></h1>

<p> </p>

<h2>I</h2>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>When Doctor Burleigh told neighbour Rosicky he had a bad heart,
Rosicky protested.</p>

<p>"So? No, I guess my heart was always pretty good. I got a little
asthma, maybe. Just a awful short breath when I was pitchin' hay last
summer, dat's all."</p>

<p>"Well now, Rosicky, if you know more about it than I do, what did
you come to me for? It's your heart that makes you short of breath, I
tell you. You're sixty-five years old, and you've always worked hard,
and your heart's tired. You've got to be careful from now on, and you
can't do heavy work any more. You've got five boys at home to do it
for you."</p>

<p>The old farmer looked up at the Doctor with a gleam of amusement
in his queer triangular-shaped eyes. His eyes were large and lively,
but the lids were caught up in the middle in a curious way, so that
they formed a triangle. He did not look like a sick man. His brown
face was creased but not wrinkled, he had a ruddy colour in his
smooth-shaven cheeks and in his lips, under his long brown moustache.
His hair was thin and ragged around his ears, but very little grey.
His forehead, naturally high and crossed by deep parallel lines, now
ran all the way up to his pointed crown. Rosicky's face had the habit
of looking interested,--suggested a contented disposition and a
reflective quality that was gay rather than grave. This gave him a
certain detachment, the easy manner of an onlooker and observer.</p>

<p>"Well, I guess you ain't got no pills fur a bad heart, Doctor Ed.
I guess the only thing is fur me to git me a new one."</p>

<p>Doctor Burleigh swung round in his desk-chair and frowned at the
old farmer. "I think if I were you I'd take a little care of the old
one, Rosicky."</p>

<p>Rosicky shrugged. "Maybe I don't know how. I expect you mean fur
me not to drink my coffee no more."</p>

<p>"I wouldn't, in your place. But you'll do as you choose about
that. I've never yet been able to separate a Bohemian from his coffee
or his pipe. I've quit trying. But the sure thing is you've got to
cut out farm work. You can feed the stock and do chores about the
barn, but you can't do anything in the fields that makes you short of
breath."</p>

<p>"How about shelling corn?"</p>

<p>"Of course not!"</p>

<p>Rosicky considered with puckered brows.</p>

<p>"I can't make my heart go no longer'n it wants to, can I, Doctor
Ed?"</p>

<p>"I think it's good for five or six years yet, maybe more, if
you'll take the strain off it. Sit around the house and help Mary. If
I had a good wife like yours, I'd want to stay around the house."</p>

<p>His patient chuckled. "It ain't no place fur a man. I don't like
no old man hanging round the kitchen too much. An' my wife, she's a
awful hard worker her own self."</p>

<p>"That's it; you can help her a little. My Lord, Rosicky, you are
one of the few men I know who has a family he can get some comfort
out of; happy dispositions, never quarrel among themselves, and they
treat you right. I want to see you live a few years and enjoy
them."</p>

<p>"Oh, they're good kids, all right," Rosicky assented.</p>

<p>The Doctor wrote him a prescription and asked him how his oldest
son, Rudolph, who had married in the spring, was getting on. Rudolph
had struck out for himself, on rented land. "And how's Polly? I was
afraid Mary mightn't like an American daughter-in-law, but it seems
to be working out all right."</p>

<p>"Yes, she's a fine girl. Dat widder woman bring her daughters up
very nice. Polly got lots of spunk, an' she got some style, too. Da's
nice, for young folks to have some style." Rosicky inclined his head
gallantly. His voice and his twinkly smile were an affectionate
compliment to his daughter-in-law.</p>

<p>"It looks like a storm, and you'd better be getting home before it
comes. In town in the car?" Doctor Burleigh rose.</p>

<p>"No, I'm in de wagon. When you got five boys, you ain't got much
chance to ride round in de Ford. I ain't much for cars, noway."</p>

<p>"Well, it's a good road out to your place; but I don't want you
bumping around in a wagon much. And never again on a hay-rake,
remember!"</p>

<p>Rosicky placed the Doctor's fee delicately behind the
desk-telephone, looking the other way, as if this were an
absent-minded gesture. He put on his plush cap and his corduroy
jacket with a sheepskin collar, and went out.</p>

<p>The Doctor picked up his stethoscope and frowned at it as if he
were seriously annoyed with the instrument. He wished it had been
telling tales about some other man's heart, some old man who didn't
look the Doctor in the eye so knowingly, or hold out such a warm
brown hand when he said good-bye. Doctor Burleigh had been a poor boy
in the country before he went away to medical school; he had known
Rosicky almost ever since he could remember, and he had a deep
affection for Mrs. Rosicky.</p>

<p>Only last winter he had had such a good breakfast at Rosicky's,
and that when he needed it. He had been out all night on a long, hard
confinement case at Tom Marshall's,--a big rich farm where there was
plenty of stock and plenty of feed and a great deal of expensive farm
machinery of the newest model, and no comfort whatever. The woman had
too many children and too much work, and she was no manager. When the
baby was born at last, and handed over to the assisting neighbour
woman, and the mother was properly attended to, Burleigh refused any
breakfast in that slovenly house, and drove his buggy--the snow was
too deep for a car--eight miles to Anton Rosicky's place. He didn't
know another farm-house where a man could get such a warm welcome,
and such good strong coffee with rich cream. No wonder the old chap
didn't want to give up his coffee!</p>

<p>He had driven in just when the boys had come back from the barn
and were washing up for breakfast. The long table, covered with a
bright oilcloth, was set out with dishes waiting for them, and the
warm kitchen was full of the smell of coffee and hot biscuit and
sausage. Five big handsome boys, running from twenty to twelve, all
with what Burleigh called natural good manners,--they hadn't a bit of
the painful self-consciousness he himself had to struggle with when
he was a lad. One ran to put his horse away, another helped him off
with his fur coat and hung it up, and Josephine, the youngest child
and the only daughter, quickly set another place under her mother's
direction.</p>

<p>With Mary, to feed creatures was the natural expression of
affection,--her chickens, the calves, her big hungry boys. It was a
rare pleasure to feed a young man whom she seldom saw and of whom she
was as proud as if he belonged to her. Some country housekeepers
would have stopped to spread a white cloth over the oilcloth, to
change the thick cups and plates for their best china, and the
wooden-handled knives for plated ones. But not Mary.</p>

<p>"You must take us as you find us, Doctor Ed. I'd be glad to put
out my good things for you if you was expected, but I'm glad to get
you any way at all."</p>

<p>He knew she was glad,--she threw back her head and spoke out as if
she were announcing him to the whole prairie. Rosicky hadn't said
anything at all; he merely smiled his twinkling smile, put some more
coal on the fire, and went into his own room to pour the Doctor a
little drink in a medicine glass. When they were all seated, he
watched his wife's face from his end of the table and spoke to her in
Czech. Then, with the instinct of politeness which seldom failed him,
he turned to the Doctor and said slyly; "I was just tellin' her not
to ask you no questions about Mrs. Marshall till you eat some
breakfast. My wife, she's terrible fur to ask questions."</p>

<p>The boys laughed, and so did Mary. She watched the Doctor devour
her biscuit and sausage, too much excited to eat anything herself.
She drank her coffee and sat taking in everything about her visitor.
She had known him when he was a poor country boy, and was boastfully
proud of his success, always saying: "What do people go to Omaha for,
to see a doctor, when we got the best one in the State right here?"
If Mary liked people at all, she felt physical pleasure in the sight
of them, personal exultation in any good fortune that came to them.
Burleigh didn't know many women like that, but he knew she was like
that.</p>

<p>When his hunger was satisfied, he did, of course, have to tell
them about Mrs. Marshall, and he noticed what a friendly interest the
boys took in the matter.</p>

<p>Rudolph, the oldest one (he was still living at home then), said:
"The last time I was over there, she was lifting them big heavy
milk-cans, and I knew she oughtn't to be doing it."</p>

<p>"Yes, Rudolph told me about that when he come home, and I said it
wasn't right," Mary put in warmly. "It was all right for me to do
them things up to the last, for I was terrible strong, but that
woman's weakly. And do you think she'll be able to nurse it, Ed?" She
sometimes forgot to give him the title she was so proud of. "And to
think of your being up all night and then not able to get a decent
breakfast! I don't know what's the matter with such people."</p>

<p>"Why, Mother," said one of the boys, "if Doctor Ed had got
breakfast there, we wouldn't have him here. So you ought to be
glad."</p>

<p>"He knows I'm glad to have him, John, any time. But I'm sorry for
that poor woman, how bad she'll feel the Doctor had to go away in the
cold without his breakfast."</p>

<p>"I wish I'd been in practice when these were getting born." The
doctor looked down the row of close-clipped heads. "I missed some
good breakfasts by not being."</p>

<p>The boys began to laugh at their mother because she flushed so
red, but she stood her ground and threw up her head. "I don't care,
you wouldn't have got away from this house without breakfast. No
doctor ever did. I'd have had something ready fixed that Anton could
warm up for you."</p>

<p>The boys laughed harder than ever, and exclaimed at her: "I'll bet
you would!" "She would, that!"</p>

<p>"Father, did you get breakfast for the doctor when we were
born?"</p>

<p>"Yes, and he used to bring me my breakfast, too, mighty nice. I
was always awful hungry!" Mary admitted with a guilty laugh.</p>

<p>While the boys were getting the Doctor's horse, he went to the
window to examine the house plants. "What do you do to your geraniums
to keep them blooming all winter, Mary? I never pass this house that
from the road I don't see your windows full of flowers."</p>

<p>She snapped off a dark red one, and a ruffled new green leaf, and
put them in his buttonhole. "There, that looks better. You look too
solemn for a young man, Ed. Why don't you git married? I'm worried
about you. Settin' at breakfast, I looked at you real hard, and I
seen you've got some grey hairs already."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes! They're coming. Maybe they'd come faster if I
married."</p>

<p>"Don't talk so. You'll ruin your health eating at the hotel. I
could send your wife a nice loaf of nut bread, if you only had one. I
don't like to see a young man getting grey. I'll tell you something,
Ed; you make some strong black tea and keep it handy in a bowl, and
every morning just brush it into your hair, an' it'll keep the grey
from showin' much. That's the way I do!"</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>Sometimes the Doctor heard the gossipers in the drug-store
wondering why Rosicky didn't get on faster. He was industrious, and
so were his boys, but they were rather free and easy, weren't
pushers, and they didn't always show good judgment. They were
comfortable, they were out of debt, but they didn't get much ahead.
Maybe, Doctor Burleigh reflected, people as generous and warm-hearted
and affectionate as the Rosickys never got ahead much; maybe you
couldn't enjoy your life and put it into the bank, too.</p>

<p> </p>

<h2>II</h2>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>When Rosicky left Doctor Burleigh's office he went into the
farm-implement store to light his pipe and put on his glasses and
read over the list Mary had given him. Then he went into the general
merchandise place next door and stood about until the pretty girl
with the plucked eyebrows, who always waited on him, was free. Those
eyebrows, two thin India-ink strokes, amused him, because he
remembered how they used to be. Rosicky always prolonged his shopping
by a little joking; the girl knew the old fellow admired her, and she
liked to chaff with him.</p>

<p>"Seems to me about every other week you buy ticking, Mr. Rosicky,
and always the best quality," she remarked as she measured off the
heavy bolt with red stripes.</p>

<p>"You see, my wife is always makin' goose-fedder pillows, an' de
thin stuff don't hold in dem little down-fedders."</p>

<p>"You must have lots of pillows at your house."</p>

<p>"Sure. She makes quilts of dem, too. We sleeps easy. Now she's
makin' a fedder quilt for my son's wife. You know Polly, that married
my Rudolph. How much my bill, Miss Pearl?"</p>

<p>"Eight eighty-five."</p>

<p>"Chust make it nine, and put in some candy fur de women."</p>

<p>"As usual. I never did see a man buy so much candy for his wife.
First thing you know, she'll be getting too fat."</p>

<p>"I'd like dat. I ain't much fur all dem slim women like what de
style is now."</p>

<p>"That's one for me, I suppose, Mr. Bohunk!" Pearl sniffed and
elevated her India-ink strokes.</p>

<p>When Rosicky went out to his wagon, it was beginning to snow,--the
first snow of the season, and he was glad to see it. He rattled out
of town and along the highway through a wonderfully rich stretch of
country, the finest farms in the county. He admired this High
Prairie, as it was called, and always liked to drive through it. His
own place lay in a rougher territory, where there was some clay in
the soil and it was not so productive. When he bought his land, he
hadn't the money to buy on High Prairie; so he told his boys, when
they grumbled, that if their land hadn't some clay in it, they
wouldn't own it at all. All the same, he enjoyed looking at these
fine farms, as he enjoyed looking at a prize bull.</p>

<p>After he had gone eight miles, he came to the graveyard, which lay
just at the edge of his own hay-land. There he stopped his horses and
sat still on his wagon seat, looking about at the snowfall. Over
yonder on the hill he could see his own house, crouching low, with
the clump of orchard behind and the windmill before, and all down the
gentle hill-slope the rows of pale gold cornstalks stood out against
the white field. The snow was falling over the cornfield and the
pasture and the hay-land, steadily, with very little wind,--a nice
dry snow. The graveyard had only a light wire fence about it and was
all overgrown with long red grass. The fine snow, settling into this
red grass and upon the few little evergreens and the headstones,
looked very pretty.</p>

<p>It was a nice graveyard, Rosicky reflected, sort of snug and
homelike, not cramped or mournful,--a big sweep all round it. A man
could lie down in the long grass and see the complete arch of the sky
over him, hear the wagons go by; in summer the mowing-machine rattled
right up to the wire fence. And it was so near home. Over there
across the cornstalks his own roof and windmill looked so good to him
that he promised himself to mind the Doctor and take care of himself.
He was awful fond of his place, he admitted. He wasn't anxious to
leave it. And it was a comfort to think that he would never have to
go farther than the edge of his own hayfield. The snow, falling over
his barnyard and the graveyard, seemed to draw things together like.
And they were all old neighbours in the graveyard, most of them
friends; there was nothing to feel awkward or embarrassed about.
Embarrassment was the most disagreeable feeling Rosicky knew. He
didn't often have it,--only with certain people whom he didn't
understand at all.</p>

<p>Well, it was a nice snowstorm; a fine sight to see the snow
falling so quietly and graciously over so much open country. On his
cap and shoulders, on the horses' backs and manes, light, delicate,
mysterious it fell; and with it a dry cool fragrance was released
into the air. It meant rest for vegetation and men and beasts, for
the ground itself; a season of long nights for sleep, leisurely
breakfasts, peace by the fire. This and much more went through
Rosicky's mind, but he merely told himself that winter was coming,
clucked to his horses, and drove on.</p>

<p>When he reached home, John, the youngest boy, ran out to put away
his team for him, and he met Mary coming up from the outside cellar
with her apron full of carrots. They went into the house together. On
the table, covered with oilcloth figured with clusters of blue
grapes, a place was set, and he smelled hot coffee-cake of some kind.
Anton never lunched in town; he thought that extravagant, and anyhow
he didn't like the food. So Mary always had something ready for him
when he got home.</p>

<p>After he was settled in his chair, stirring his coffee in a big
cup, Mary took out of the oven a pan of <i>kolache</i> stuffed with
apricots, examined them anxiously to see whether they had got too
dry, put them beside his plate, and then sat down opposite him.</p>

<p>Rosicky asked her in Czech if she wasn't going to have any
coffee.</p>

<p>She replied in English, as being somehow the right language for
transacting business: "Now what did Doctor Ed say, Anton? You tell me
just what."</p>

<p>"He said I was to tell you some compliments, but I forgot 'em."
Rosicky's eyes twinkled.</p>

<p>"About you, I mean. What did he say about your asthma?"</p>

<p>"He says I ain't got no asthma." Rosicky took one of the little
rolls in his broad brown fingers. The thickened nail of his right
thumb told the story of his past.</p>

<p>"Well, what is the matter? And don't try to put me off."</p>

<p>"He don't say nothing much, only I'm a little older, and my heart
ain't so good like it used to be."</p>

<p>Mary started and brushed her hair back from her temples with both
hands as if she were a little out of her mind. From the way she
glared, she might have been in a rage with him.</p>

<p>"He says there's something the matter with your heart? Doctor Ed
says so?"</p>

<p>"Now don't yell at me like I was a hog in de garden, Mary. You
know I always did like to hear a woman talk soft. He didn't say
anything de matter wid my heart, only it ain't so young like it used
to be, an' he tell me not to pitch hay or run de corn-sheller."</p>

<p>Mary wanted to jump up, but she sat still. She admired the way he
never under any circumstances raised his voice or spoke roughly. He
was city-bred, and she was country-bred; she often said she wanted
her boys to have their papa's nice ways.</p>

<p>"You never have no pain there, do you? It's your breathing and
your stomach that's been wrong. I wouldn't believe nobody but Doctor
Ed about it. I guess I'll go see him myself. Didn't he give you no
advice?"</p>

<p>"Chust to take it easy like, an' stay round de house dis winter. I
guess you got some carpenter work for me to do. I kin make some new
shelves for you, and I want dis long time to build a closet in de
boys' room and make dem two little fellers keep dere clo'es hung
up."</p>

<p>Rosicky drank his coffee from time to time, while he considered.
His moustache was of the soft long variety and came down over his
mouth like the teeth of a buggy-rake over a bundle of hay. Each time
he put down his cup, he ran his blue handkerchief over his lips. When
he took a drink of water, he managed very neatly with the back of his
hand.</p>

<p>Mary sat watching him intently, trying to find any change in his
face. It is hard to see anyone who has become like your own body to
you. Yes, his hair had got thin, and his high forehead had deep lines
running from left to right. But his neck, always clean shaved except
in the busiest seasons, was not loose or baggy. It was burned a dark
reddish brown, and there were deep creases in it, but it looked firm
and full of blood. His cheeks had a good colour. On either side of
his mouth there was a half-moon down the length of his cheek, not
wrinkles, but two lines that had come there from his habitual
expression. He was shorter and broader than when she married him; his
back had grown broad and curved, a good deal like the shell of an old
turtle, and his arms and legs were short.</p>

<p>He was fifteen years older than Mary, but she had hardly ever
thought about it before. He was her man, and the kind of man she
liked. She was rough, and he was gentle,--city-bred, as she always
said. They had been shipmates on a rough voyage and had stood by each
other in trying times. Life had gone well with them because, at
bottom, they had the same ideas about life. They agreed, without
discussion, as to what was most important and what was secondary.
They didn't often exchange opinions, even in Czech,--it was as if
they had thought the same thought together. A good deal had to be
sacrificed and thrown overboard in a hard life like theirs, and they
had never disagreed as to the things that could go. It had been a
hard life, and a soft life, too. There wasn't anything brutal in the
short, broad-backed man with the three-cornered eyes and the forehead
that went on to the top of his skull. He was a city man, a gentle
man, and though he had married a rough farm girl, he had never
touched her without gentleness.</p>

<p>They had been at one accord not to hurry through life, not to be
always skimping and saving. They saw their neighbours buy more land
and feed more stock than they did, without discontent. Once when the
creamery agent came to the Rosickys to persuade them to sell him
their cream, he told them how much money the Fasslers, their nearest
neighbours, had made on their cream last year.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Mary, "and look at them Fassler children! Pale,
pinched little things, they look like skimmed milk. I'd rather put
some colour into my children's faces than put money into the
bank."</p>

<p>The agent shrugged and turned to Anton.</p>

<p>"I guess we'll do like she says," said Rosicky.</p>

<p> </p>

<center>
<h2>III</h2>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>Mary very soon got into town to see Doctor Ed, and then she had a
talk with her boys and set a guard over Rosicky. Even John, the
youngest, had his father on his mind. If Rosicky went to throw hay
down from the loft, one of the boys ran up the ladder and took the
fork from him. He sometimes complained that though he was getting to
be an old man, he wasn't an old woman yet.</p>

<p>That winter he stayed in the house in the afternoons and
carpentered, or sat in the chair between the window full of plants
and the wooden bench where the two pails of drinking-water stood.
This spot was called "Father's corner," though it was not a corner at
all. He had a shelf there, where he kept his Bohemian papers and his
pipes and tobacco, and his shears and needles and thread and tailor's
thimble. Having been a tailor in his youth, he couldn't bear to see a
woman patching at his clothes, or at the boys'. He liked tailoring,
and always patched all the overalls and jackets and work shirts.
Occasionally he made over a pair of pants one of the older boys had
outgrown, for the little fellow.</p>

<p>While he sewed, he let his mind run back over his life. He had a
good deal to remember, really; life in three countries. The only part
of his youth he didn't like to remember was the two years he had
spent in London, in Cheapside, working for a German tailor who was
wretchedly poor. Those days, when he was nearly always hungry, when
his clothes were dropping off him for dirt, and the sound of a
strange language kept him in continual bewilderment, had left a sore
spot in his mind that wouldn't bear touching.</p>

<p>He was twenty when he landed at Castle Garden in New York, and he
had a protector who got him work in a tailor shop in Vesey Street,
down near the Washington Market. He looked upon that part of his life
as very happy. He became a good workman, he was industrious, and his
wages were increased from time to time. He minded his own business
and envied nobody's good fortune. He went to night school and learned
to read English. He often did overtime work and was well paid for it,
but somehow he never saved anything. He couldn't refuse a loan to a
friend, and he was self-indulgent. He liked a good dinner, and a
little went for beer, a little for tobacco; a good deal went to the
girls. He often stood through an opera on Saturday nights; he could
get standing-room for a dollar. Those were the great days of opera in
New York, and it gave a fellow something to think about for the rest
of the week. Rosicky had a quick ear, and a childish love of all the
stage splendour; the scenery, the costumes, the ballet. He usually
went with a chum, and after the performance they had beer and maybe
some oysters somewhere. It was a fine life; for the first five years
or so it satisfied him completely. He was never hungry or cold or
dirty, and everything amused him: a fire, a dog fight, a parade, a
storm, a ferry ride. He thought New York the finest, richest,
friendliest city in the world.</p>

<p>Moreover, he had what he called a happy home life. Very near the
tailor shop was a small furniture-factory, where an old Austrian,
Loeffler, employed a few skilled men and made unusual furniture, most
of it to order, for the rich German housewives up-town. The top floor
of Loeffler's five-storey factory was a loft, where he kept his
choice lumber and stored the odd pieces of furniture left on his
hands. One of the young workmen he employed was a Czech, and he and
Rosicky became fast friends. They persuaded Loeffler to let them have
a sleeping-room in one corner of the loft. They bought good beds and
bedding and had their pick of the furniture kept up there. The loft
was low-pitched, but light and airy, full of windows, and
good-smelling by reason of the fine lumber put up there to season.
Old Loeffler used to go down to the docks and buy wood from South
America and the East from the sea captains. The young men were as
foolish about their house as a bridal pair. Zichec, the young
cabinet-maker, devised every sort of convenience, and Rosicky kept
their clothes in order. At night and on Sundays, when the quiver of
machinery underneath was still, it was the quietest place in the
world, and on summer nights all the sea winds blew in. Zichec often
practised on his flute in the evening. They were both fond of music
and went to the opera together. Rosicky thought he wanted to live
like that for ever.</p>

<p>But as the years passed, all alike, he began to get a little
restless. When spring came round, he would begin to feel fretted, and
he got to drinking. He was likely to drink too much of a Saturday
night. On Sunday he was languid and heavy, getting over his spree. On
Monday he plunged into work again. So he never had time to figure out
what ailed him, though he knew something did. When the grass turned
green in Park Place, and the lilac hedge at the back of Trinity
churchyard put out its blossoms, he was tormented by a longing to run
away. That was why he drank too much; to get a temporary illusion of
freedom and wide horizons.</p>

<p>Rosicky, the old Rosicky, could remember as if it were yesterday
the day when the young Rosicky found out what was the matter with
him. It was on a Fourth of July afternoon, and he was sitting in Park
Place in the sun. The lower part of New York was empty. Wall Street,
Liberty Street, Broadway, all empty. So much stone and asphalt with
nothing going on, so many empty windows. The emptiness was intense,
like the stillness in a great factory when the machinery stops and
the belts and bands cease running. It was too great a change, it took
all the strength out of one. Those blank buildings, without the
stream of life pouring through them, were like empty jails. It struck
young Rosicky that this was the trouble with big cities; they built
you in from the earth itself, cemented you away from any contact with
the ground. You lived in an unnatural world, like the fish in an
aquarium, who were probably much more comfortable than they ever were
in the sea.</p>

<p>On that very day he began to think seriously about the articles he
had read in the Bohemian papers, describing prosperous Czech farming
communities in the West. He believed he would like to go out there as
a farm hand; it was hardly possible that he could ever have land of
his own. His people had always been workmen; his father and
grandfather had worked in shops. His mother's parents had lived in
the country, but they rented their farm and had a hard time to get
along. Nobody in his family had ever owned any land,--that belonged
to a different station of life altogether. Anton's mother died when
he was little, and he was sent into the country to her parents. He
stayed with them until he was twelve, and formed those ties with the
earth and the farm animals and growing things which are never made at
all unless they are made early. After his grandfather died, he went
back to live with his father and stepmother, but she was very hard on
him, and his father helped him to get passage to London.</p>

<p>After that Fourth of July day in Park Place, the desire to return
to the country never left him. To work on another man's farm would be
all he asked; to see the sun rise and set and to plant things and
watch them grow. He was a very simple man. He was like a tree that
has not many roots, but one tap-root that goes down deep. He
subscribed for a Bohemian paper printed in Chicago, then for one
printed in Omaha. His mind got farther and farther west. He began to
save a little money to buy his liberty. When he was thirty-five,
there was a great meeting in New York of Bohemian athletic societies,
and Rosicky left the tailor shop and went home with the Omaha
delegates to try his fortune in another part of the world.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Perhaps the fact that his own youth was well over before he began
to have a family was one reason why Rosicky was so fond of his boys.
He had almost a grandfather's indulgence for them. He had never had
to worry about any of them--except, just now, a little about
Rudolph.</p>

<p>On Saturday night the boys always piled into the Ford, took little
Josephine, and went to town to the moving-picture show. One Saturday
morning they were talking at the breakfast table about starting early
that evening, so that they would have an hour or so to see the
Christmas things in the stores before the show began. Rosicky looked
down the table.</p>

<p>"I hope you boys ain't disappointed, but I want you to let me have
de car tonight. Maybe some of you can go in with de neighbours."</p>

<p>Their faces fell. They worked hard all week, and they were still
like children. A new jack-knife or a box of candy pleased the older
ones as much as the little fellow.</p>

<p>"If you and Mother are going to town," Frank said, "maybe you
could take a couple of us along with you, anyway."</p>

<p>"No, I want to take de car down to Rudolph's, and let him an'
Polly go in to de show. She don't git into town enough, an' I'm
afraid she's gettin' lonesome, an' he can't afford no car yet."</p>

<p>That settled it. The boys were a good deal dashed. Their father
took another piece of apple-cake and went on: "Maybe next Saturday
night de two little fellers can go along wid dem."</p>

<p>"Oh, is Rudolph going to have the car every Saturday night?"</p>

<p>Rosicky did not reply at once; then he began to speak seriously:
"Listen, boys; Polly ain't lookin' so good. I don't like to see
nobody lookin' sad. It comes hard fur a town girl to be a farmer's
wife. I don't want no trouble to start in Rudolph's family. When it
starts, it ain't so easy to stop. An American girl don't git used to
our ways all at once. I like to tell Polly she and Rudolph can have
the car every Saturday night till after New Year's, if it's all right
with you boys."</p>

<p>"Sure it's all right, Papa," Mary cut in. "And it's good you
thought about that. Town girls is used to more than country girls. I
lay awake nights, scared she'll make Rudolph discontented with the
farm."</p>

<p>The boys put as good a face on it as they could. They surely
looked forward to their Saturday nights in town. That evening Rosicky
drove the car the half-mile down to Rudolph's new, bare little
house.</p>

<p>Polly was in a short-sleeved gingham dress, clearing away the
supper dishes. She was a trim, slim little thing, with blue eyes and
shingled yellow hair, and her eyebrows were reduced to a mere
brush-stroke, like Miss Pearl's.</p>

<p>"Good evening, Mr. Rosicky. Rudolph's at the barn, I guess." She
never called him father, or Mary mother. She was sensitive about
having married a foreigner. She never in the world would have done it
if Rudolph hadn't been such a handsome, persuasive fellow and such a
gallant lover. He had graduated in her class in the high school in
town, and their friendship began in the ninth grade.</p>

<p>Rosicky went in, though he wasn't exactly asked. "My boys ain't
goin' to town tonight, an' I brought de car over fur you two to go in
to de picture show."</p>

<p>Polly, carrying dishes to the sink, looked over her shoulder at
him. "Thank you. But I'm late with my work tonight, and pretty tired.
Maybe Rudolph would like to go in with you."</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't go to de shows! I'm too old-fashioned. You won't feel
so tired after you ride in de air a ways. It's a nice clear night,
an' it ain't cold. You go an' fix yourself up, Polly, an' I'll wash
de dishes an' leave everything nice fur you."</p>

<p>Polly blushed and tossed her bob. "I couldn't let you do that, Mr.
Rosicky. I wouldn't think of it."</p>

<p>Rosicky said nothing. He found a bib apron on a nail behind the
kitchen door. He slipped it over his head and then took Polly by her
two elbows and pushed her gently toward the door of her own room. "I
washed up de kitchen many times for my wife, when de babies was sick
or somethin'. You go an' make yourself look nice. I like you to look
prettier'n any of dem town girls when you go in. De young folks must
have some fun, an' I'm goin' to look out fur you, Polly."</p>

<p>That kind, reassuring grip on her elbows, the old man's funny
bright eyes, made Polly want to drop her head on his shoulder for a
second. She restrained herself, but she lingered in his grasp at the
door of her room, murmuring tearfully: "You always lived in the city
when you were young, didn't you? Don't you ever get lonesome out
here?"</p>

<p>As she turned round to him, her hand fell naturally into his, and
he stood holding it and smiling into her face with his peculiar,
knowing, indulgent smile without a shadow of reproach in it. "Dem big
cities is all right fur de rich, but dey is terrible hard fur de
poor."</p>

<p>"I don't know. Sometimes I think I'd like to take a chance. You
lived in New York, didn't you?"</p>

<p>"An' London. Da's bigger still. I learned my trade dere. Here's
Rudolph comin', you better hurry."</p>

<p>"Will you tell me about London some time?"</p>

<p>"Maybe. Only I ain't no talker, Polly. Run an' dress yourself
up."</p>

<p>The bedroom door closed behind her, and Rudolph came in from the
outside, looking anxious. He had seen the car and was sorry any of
his family should come just then. Supper hadn't been a very pleasant
occasion. Halting in the doorway, he saw his father in a kitchen
apron, carrying dishes to the sink. He flushed crimson and something
flashed in his eye. Rosicky held up a warning finger.</p>

<p>"I brought de car over fur you an' Polly to go to de picture show,
an' I made her let me finish here so you won't be late. You go put on
a clean shirt, quick! "</p>

<p>"But don't the boys want the car, Father?"</p>

<p>"Not tonight dey don't." Rosicky fumbled under his apron and found
his pants pocket. He took out a silver dollar and said in a hurried
whisper: "You go an' buy dat girl some ice cream an' candy tonight,
like you was courtin'. She's awful good friends wid me."</p>

<p>Rudolph was very short of cash, but he took the money as if it
hurt him. There had been a crop failure all over the county. He had
more than once been sorry he'd married this year.</p>

<p>In a few minutes the young people came out, looking clean and a
little stiff. Rosicky hurried them off, and then he took his own time
with the dishes. He scoured the pots and pans and put away the milk
and swept the kitchen. He put some coal in the stove and shut off the
draughts, so the place would be warm for them when they got home late
at night. Then he sat down and had a pipe and listened to the clock
tick.</p>

<p>Generally speaking, marrying an American girl was certainly a
risk. A Czech should marry a Czech. It was lucky that Polly was the
daughter of a poor widow woman; Rudolph was proud, and if she had a
prosperous family to throw up at him, they could never make it go.
Polly was one of four sisters, and they all worked; one was
book-keeper in the bank, one taught music, and Polly and her younger
sister had been clerks, like Miss Pearl. All four of them were
musical, had pretty voices, and sang in the Methodist choir, which
the eldest sister directed.</p>

<p>Polly missed the sociability of a store position. She missed the
choir, and the company of her sisters. She didn't dislike housework,
but she disliked so much of it. Rosicky was a little anxious about
this pair. He was afraid Polly would grow so discontented that Rudy
would quit the farm and take a factory job in Omaha. He had worked
for a winter up there, two years ago, to get money to marry on. He
had done very well, and they would always take him back at the
stockyards. But to Rosicky that meant the end of everything for his
son. To be a landless man was to be a wage-earner, a slave, all your
life; to have nothing, to be nothing.</p>

<p>Rosicky thought he would come over and do a little carpentering
for Polly after the New Year. He guessed she needed jollying. Rudolph
was a serious sort of chap, serious in love and serious about his
work.</p>

<p>Rosicky shook out his pipe and walked home across the fields.
Ahead of him the lamplight shone from his kitchen windows. Suppose he
were still in a tailor shop on Vesey Street, with a bunch of pale,
narrow-chested sons working on machines, all coming home tired and
sullen to eat supper in a kitchen that was a parlour also; with
another crowded, angry family quarrelling just across the dumb-waiter
shaft, and squeaking pulleys at the windows where dirty washings hung
on dirty lines above a court full of old brooms and mops and
ash-cans. . . .</p>

<p>He stopped by the windmill to look up at the frosty winter stars
and draw a long breath before he went inside. That kitchen with the
shining windows was dear to him; but the sleeping fields and bright
stars and the noble darkness were dearer still.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>On the day before Christmas the weather set in very cold; no snow,
but a bitter, biting wind that whistled and sang over the flat land
and lashed one's face like fine wires. There was baking going on in
the Rosicky kitchen all day, and Rosicky sat inside, making over a
coat that Albert had outgrown into an overcoat for John. Mary had a
big red geranium in bloom for Christmas, and a row of Jerusalem
cherry trees, full of berries. It was the first year she had ever
grown these; Doctor Ed brought her the seeds from Omaha when he went
to some medical convention. They reminded Rosicky of plants he had
seen in England; and all afternoon, as he stitched, he sat thinking
about those two years in London, which his mind usually shrank from
even after all this while.</p>

<p>He was a lad of eighteen when he dropped down into London, with no
money and no connexions except the address of a cousin who was
supposed to be working at a confectioner's. When he went to the
pastry shop, however, he found that the cousin had gone to America.
Anton tramped the streets for several days, sleeping in doorways and
on the Embankment, until he was in utter despair. He knew no English,
and the sound of the strange language all about him confused him. By
chance he met a poor German tailor who had learned his trade in
Vienna, and could speak a little Czech. This tailor, Lifschnitz, kept
a repair shop in a Cheapside basement, underneath a cobbler. He
didn't much need an apprentice, but he was sorry for the boy and took
him in for no wages but his keep and what he could pick up. The
pickings were supposed to be coppers given you when you took work
home to a customer. But most of the customers called for their
clothes themselves, and the coppers that came Anton's way were very
few. He had, however, a place to sleep. The tailor's family lived
upstairs in three rooms; a kitchen, a bedroom, where Lifschnitz and
his wife and five children slept, and a living-room. Two corners of
this living-room were curtained off for lodgers; in one Rosicky slept
on an old horsehair sofa, with a feather quilt to wrap himself in.
The other corner was rented to a wretched, dirty boy, who was
studying the violin. He actually practised there. Rosicky was dirty,
too. There was no way to be anything else. Mrs. Lifschnitz got the
water she cooked and washed with from a pump in a brick court, four
flights down. There were bugs in the place, and multitudes of fleas,
though the poor woman did the best she could. Rosicky knew she often
went empty to give another potato or a spoonful of dripping to the
two hungry, sad-eyed boys who lodged with her. He used to think he
would never get out of there, never get a clean shirt to his back
again. What would he do, he wondered, when his clothes actually
dropped to pieces and the worn cloth wouldn't hold patches any
longer?</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>It was still early when the old farmer put aside his sewing and
his recollections. The sky had been a dark grey all day, with not a
gleam of sun, and the light failed at four o'clock. He went to shave
and change his shirt while the turkey was roasting. Rudolph and Polly
were coming over for supper.</p>

<p>After supper they sat round in the kitchen, and the younger boys
were saying how sorry they were it hadn't snowed. Everybody was
sorry. They wanted a deep snow that would lie long and keep the wheat
warm, and leave the ground soaked when it melted.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir!" Rudolph broke out fiercely; "if we have another dry
year like last year, there's going to be hard times in this
country."</p>

<p>Rosicky filled his pipe. "You boys don't know what hard times is.
You don't owe nobody, you got plenty to eat an' keep warm, an' plenty
water to keep clean. When you got them, you can't have it very
hard."</p>

<p>Rudolph frowned, opened and shut his big right hand, and dropped
it clenched upon his knee. "I've got to have a good deal more than
that, Father, or I'll quit this farming gamble. I can always make
good wages railroading, or at the packing house, and be sure of my
money."</p>

<p>"Maybe so," his father answered dryly.</p>

<p>Mary, who had just come in from the pantry and was wiping her
hands on the roller towel, thought Rudy and his father were getting
too serious. She brought her darning-basket and sat down in the
middle of the group.</p>

<p>"I ain't much afraid of hard times, Rudy," she said heartily.
"We've had a plenty, but we've always come through. Your father
wouldn't never take nothing very hard, not even hard times. I got a
mind to tell you a story on him. Maybe you boys can't hardly remember
the year we had that terrible hot wind, that burned everything up on
the Fourth of July? All the corn an' the gardens. An' that was in the
days when we didn't have alfalfa yet,--I guess it wasn't
invented.</p>

<p>"Well, that very day your father was out cultivatin' corn, and I
was here in the kitchen makin' plum preserves. We had bushels of
plums that year. I noticed it was terrible hot, but it's always hot
in the kitchen when you're preservin', an' I was too busy with my
plums to mind. Anton come in from the field about three o'clock, an'
I asked him what was the matter.</p>

<p>"'Nothin',' he says, 'but it's pretty hot, an' I think I won't
work no more today.' He stood round for a few minutes, an' then he
says: 'Ain't you near through? I want you should git up a nice supper
for us tonight. It's Fourth of July.'</p>

<p>"I told him to git along, that I was right in the middle of
preservin', but the plums would taste good on hot biscuit. 'I'm goin'
to have fried chicken, too,' he says, and he went off an' killed a
couple. You three oldest boys was little fellers, playin' round
outside, real hot an' sweaty, an' your father took you to the horse
tank down by the windmill an' took off your clothes an' put you in.
Them two box-elder trees was little then, but they made shade over
the tank. Then he took off all his own clothes, an' got in with you.
While he was playin' in the water with you, the Methodist preacher
drove into our place to say how all the neighbours was goin' to meet
at the schoolhouse that night, to pray for rain. He drove right to
the windmill, of course, and there was your father and you three with
no clothes on. I was in the kitchen door, an' I had to laugh, for the
preacher acted like he ain't never seen a naked man before. He surely
was embarrassed, an' your father couldn't git to his clothes; they
was all hangin' up on the windmill to let the sweat dry out of 'em.
So he laid in the tank where he was, an' put one of you boys on top
of him to cover him up a little, an' talked to the preacher.</p>

<p>"When you got through playin' in the water, he put clean clothes
on you and a clean shirt on himself, an' by that time I'd begun to
get supper. He says: 'It's too hot in here to eat comfortable. Let's
have a picnic in the orchard. We'll eat our supper behind the
mulberry hedge, under them linden trees.'</p>

<p>"So he carried our supper down, an' a bottle of my wild-grape
wine, an' everything tasted good, I can tell you. The wind got cooler
as the sun was goin' down, and it turned out pleasant, only I noticed
how the leaves was curled up on the linden trees. That made me think,
an' I asked your father if that hot wind all day hadn't been terrible
hard on the gardens an' the corn.</p>

<p>"'Corn,' he says, 'there ain't no corn.'</p>

<p>"'What you talkin' about?' I said. 'Ain't we got forty acres?'</p>

<p>"'We ain't got an ear,' he says, 'nor nobody else ain't got none.
All the corn in this country was cooked by three o'clock today, like
you'd roasted it in an oven.'</p>

<p>"'You mean you won't get no crop at all?' I asked him. I couldn't
believe it, after he'd worked so hard.</p>

<p>"'No crop this year,' he says. 'That's why we're havin' a picnic.
We might as well enjoy what we got.'</p>

<p>"An' that's how your father behaved, when all the neighbours was
so discouraged they couldn't look you in the face. An' we enjoyed
ourselves that year, poor as we was, an' our neighbours wasn't a bit
better off for bein' miserable. Some of 'em grieved till they got
poor digestions and couldn't relish what they did have."</p>

<p>The younger boys said they thought their father had the best of
it. But Rudolf was thinking that, all the same, the neighbours had
managed to get ahead more, in the fifteen years since that time.
There must be something wrong about his father's way of doing things.
He wished he knew what was going on in the back of Polly's mind. He
knew she liked his father, but he knew, too, that she was afraid of
something. When his mother sent over coffee-cake or prune tarts or a
loaf of fresh bread, Polly seemed to regard them with a certain
suspicion. When she observed to him that his brothers had nice
manners, her tone implied that it was remarkable they should have.
With his mother she was stiff and on her guard. Mary's hearty
frankness and gusts of good humour irritated her. Polly was afraid of
being unusual or conspicuous in any way, of being "ordinary," as she
said!</p>

<p>When Mary had finished her story, Rosicky laid aside his pipe.</p>

<p>"You boys like me to tell you about some of dem hard times I been
through in London? Warmly encouraged, he sat rubbing his forehead
along the deep creases. It was bothersome to tell a long story in
English (he nearly always talked to the boys in Czech), but he wanted
Polly to hear this one.</p>

<p>"Well, you know about dat tailor shop I worked in in London? I had
one Christmas dere I ain't never forgot. Times was awful bad before
Christmas; de boss ain't got much work, an' have it awful hard to pay
his rent. It ain't so much fun, bein' poor in a big city like London,
I'll say! All de windows is full of good t'ings to eat, an' all de
pushcarts in de streets is full, an' you smell 'em all de time, an'
you ain't got no money,--not a damn bit. I didn't mind de cold so
much, though I didn't have no overcoat, chust a short jacket I'd
outgrowed so it wouldn't meet on me, an' my hands was chapped raw.
But I always had a good appetite, like you all know, an' de sight of
dem pork pies in de windows was awful fur me!</p>

<p>"Day before Christmas was terrible foggy dat year, an' dat fog
gits into your bones and makes you all damp like. Mrs. Lifschnitz
didn't give us nothin' but a little bread an' drippin' for supper,
because she was savin' to try for to give us a good dinner on
Christmas Day. After supper de boss say I can go an' enjoy myself, so
I went into de streets to listen to de Christmas singers. Dey sing
old songs an' make very nice music, an' I run round after dem a good
ways, till I got awful hungry. I t'ink maybe if I go home, I can
sleep till morning an' forgit my belly.</p>

<p>"I went into my corner real quiet, and roll up in my fedder quilt.
But I ain't got my head down, till I smell somet'ing good. Seem like
it git stronger an' stronger, an' I can't git to sleep noway. I can't
understand dat smell. Dere was a gas light in a hall across de court,
dat always shine in at my window a little. I got up an' look round. I
got a little wooden box in my corner fur a stool, 'cause I ain't got
no chair. I picks up dat box, and under it dere is a roast goose on a
platter! I can't believe my eyes. I carry it to de window where de
light comes in, an' touch it and smell it to find out, an' den I
taste it to be sure. I say, I will eat chust one little bite of dat
goose, so I can go to sleep, and tomorrow I won't eat none at all.
But I tell you, boys, when I stop, one half of dat goose was
gone!"</p>

<p>The narrator bowed his head, and the boys shouted. But little
Josephine slipped behind his chair and kissed him on the neck beneath
his ear.</p>

<p>"Poor little Papa, I don't want him to be hungry!"</p>

<p>"Da's long ago, child. I ain't never been hungry since I had your
mudder to cook fur me."</p>

<p>"Go on and tell us the rest, please," said Polly.</p>

<p>"Well, when I come to realize what I done, of course, I felt
terrible. I felt better in de stomach, but very bad in de heart. I
set on my bed wid dat platter on my knees, an' it all come to me; how
hard dat poor woman save to buy dat goose, and how she get some
neighbour to cook it dat got more fire, an' how she put it in my
corner to keep it away from dem hungry children. Dey was a old carpet
hung up to shut my corner off, an' de children wasn't allowed to go
in dere. An' I know she put it in my corner because she trust me
more'n she did de violin boy. I can't stand it to face her after I
spoil de Christmas. So I put on my shoes and go out into de city. I
tell myself I better throw myself in de river; but I guess I ain't
dat kind of a boy.</p>

<p>"It was after twelve o'clock, an' terrible cold, an' I start out
to walk about London all night. I walk along de river awhile, but dey
was lots of drunks all along; men, and women too. I chust move along
to keep away from de police. I git onto de Strand, an' den over to
New Oxford Street, where dere was a big German restaurant on de
ground floor, wid big windows all fixed up fine, an' I could see de
people havin' parties inside. While I was lookin' in, two men and two
ladies come out, laughin' and talkin' and feelin' happy about all dey
been eatin' an' drinkin', and dey was speakin' Czech,--not like de
Austrians, but like de home folks talk it.</p>

<p>"I guess I went crazy, an' I done what I ain't never done before
nor since. I went right up to dem gay people an' begun to beg dem:
'Fellow-countrymen, for God's sake give me money enough to buy a
goose!'</p>

<p>"Dey laugh, of course, but de ladies speak awful kind to me, an'
dey take me back into de restaurant and give me hot coffee and cakes,
an' make me tell all about how I happened to come to London, an' what
I was doin' dere. Dey take my name and where I work down on paper,
an' both of dem ladies give me ten shillings.</p>

<p>"De big market at Covent Garden ain't very far away, an' by dat
time it was open. I go dere an' buy a big goose an' some pork pies,
an' potatoes and onions, an' cakes an' oranges fur de children,--all
I could carry! When I git home, everybody is still asleep. I pile all
I bought on de kitchen table, an' go in an' lay down on my bed, an' I
ain't waken up till I hear dat woman scream when she come out into
her kitchen. My goodness, but she was surprise! She laugh an' cry at
de same time, an' hug me and waken all de children. She ain't stop
fur no breakfast; she git de Christmas dinner ready dat morning, and
we all sit down an' eat all we can hold. I ain't never seen dat
violin boy have all he can hold before.</p>

<p>"Two three days after dat, de two men come to hunt me up, an' dey
ask my boss, and he give me a good report an' tell dem I was a steady
boy all right. One of dem Bohemians was very smart an' run a Bohemian
newspaper in New York, an' de odder was a rich man, in de importing
business, an' dey been travelling togedder. Dey told me how t'ings
was easier in New York, an' offered to pay my passage when dey was
goin' home soon on a boat. My boss say to me: 'You go. You ain't got
no chance here, an' I like to see you git ahead, fur you always been
a good boy to my woman, and fur dat fine Christmas dinner you give us
all.' An' da's how I got to New York."</p>

<p>That night when Rudolph and Polly, arm in arm, were running home
across the fields with the bitter wind at their backs, his heart
leaped for joy when she said she thought they might have his family
come over for supper on New Year's Eve. "Let's get up a nice supper,
and not let your mother help at all; make her be company for
once."</p>

<p>"That would be lovely of you, Polly," he said humbly. He was a
very simple, modest boy, and he, too, felt vaguely that Polly and her
sisters were more experienced and worldly than his people.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>The winter turned out badly for farmers. It was bitterly cold, and
after the first light snows before Christmas there was no snow at
all,--and no rain. March was as bitter as February. On those days
when the wind fairly punished the country, Rosicky sat by his window.
In the fall he and the boys had put in a big wheat planting, and now
the seed had frozen in the ground. All that land would have to be
ploughed up and planted over again, planted in corn. It had happened
before, but he was younger then, and he never worried about what had
to be. He was sure of himself and of Mary; he knew they could bear
what they had to bear, that they would always pull through somehow.
But he was not so sure about the young ones, and he felt troubled
because Rudolph and Polly were having such a hard start.</p>

<p>Sitting beside his flowering window while the panes rattled and
the wind blew in under the door, Rosicky gave himself to reflection
as he had not done since those Sundays in the loft of the
furniture-factory in New York, long ago. Then he was trying to find
what he wanted in life for himself; now he was trying to find what he
wanted for his boys, and why it was he so hungered to feel sure they
would be here, working this very land, after he was gone.</p>

<p>They would have to work hard on the farm, and probably they would
never do much more than make a living. But if he could think of them
as staying here on the land, he wouldn't have to fear any great
unkindness for them. Hardships, certainly; it was a hardship to have
the wheat freeze in the ground when seed was so high; and to have to
sell your stock because you had no feed. But there would be other
years when everything came along right, and you caught up. And what
you had was your own. You didn't have to choose between bosses and
strikers, and go wrong either way. You didn't have to do with
dishonest and cruel people. They were the only things in his
experience he had found terrifying and horrible; the look in the eyes
of a dishonest and crafty man, of a scheming and rapacious woman.</p>

<p>In the country, if you had a mean neighbour, you could keep off
his land and make him keep off yours. But in the city, all the
foulness and misery and brutality of your neighbours was part of your
life. The worst things he had come upon in his journey through the
world were human,--depraved and poisonous specimens of man. To this
day he could recall certain terrible faces in the London streets.
There were mean people everywhere, to be sure, even in their own
country town here. But they weren't tempered, hardened, sharpened,
like the treacherous people in cities who live by grinding or
cheating or poisoning their fellow-men. He had helped to bury two of
his fellow-workmen in the tailoring trade, and he was distrustful of
the organized industries that see one out of the world in big cities.
Here, if you were sick, you had Doctor Ed to look after you; and if
you died, fat Mr. Haycock, the kindest man in the world, buried
you.</p>

<p>It seemed to Rosicky that for good, honest boys like his, the
worst they could do on the farm was better than the best they would
be likely to do in the city. If he'd had a mean boy, now, one who was
crooked and sharp and tried to put anything over on his brothers,
then town would be the place for him. But he had no such boy. As for
Rudolph, the discontented one, he would give the shirt off his back
to anyone who touched his heart. What Rosicky really hoped for his
boys was that they could get through the world without ever knowing
much about the cruelty of human beings. "Their mother and me ain't
prepared them for that," he sometimes said to himself.</p>

<p>These thoughts brought him back to a grateful consideration of his
own case. What an escape he had had, to be sure! He, too, in his
time, had had to take money for repair work from the hand of a hungry
child who let it go so wistfully; because it was money due his boss.
And now, in all these years, he had never had to take a cent from
anyone in bitter need,--never had to look at the face of a woman
become like a wolf's from struggle and famine. When he thought of
these things, Rosicky would put on his cap and jacket and slip down
to the barn and give his work-horses a little extra oats, letting
them eat it out of his hand in their slobbery fashion. It was his way
of expressing what he felt, and made him chuckle with pleasure.</p>

<p>The spring came warm, with blue skies,--but dry, dry as a bone.
The boys began ploughing up the wheat-fields to plant them over in
corn. Rosicky would stand at the fence corner and watch them, and the
earth was so dry it blew up in clouds of brown dust that hid the
horses and the sulky plough and the driver. It was a bad outlook.</p>

<p>The big alfalfa-field that lay between the home place and
Rudolph's came up green, but Rosicky was worried because during that
open windy winter a great many Russian thistle plants had blown in
there and lodged. He kept asking the boys to rake them out; he was
afraid their seed would root and "take the alfalfa." Rudolph said
that was nonsense. The boys were working so hard planting corn, their
father felt he couldn't insist about the thistles, but he set great
store by that big alfalfa field. It was a feed you could depend
on,--and there was some deeper reason, vague, but strong. The
peculiar green of that clover woke early memories in old Rosicky,
went back to something in his childhood in the old world. When he was
a little boy, he had played in fields of that strong blue-green
colour.</p>

<p>One morning, when Rudolph had gone to town in the car, leaving a
work-team idle in his barn, Rosicky went over to his son's place, put
the horses to the buggy-rake, and set about quietly raking up those
thistles. He behaved with guilty caution, and rather enjoyed stealing
a march on Doctor Ed, who was just then taking his first vacation in
seven years of practice and was attending a clinic in Chicago.
Rosicky got the thistles raked up, but did not stop to burn them.
That would take some time, and his breath was pretty short, so he
thought he had better get the horses back to the barn.</p>

<p>He got them into the barn and to their stalls, but the pain had
come on so sharp in his chest that he didn't try to take the harness
off. He started for the house, bending lower with every step. The
cramp in his chest was shutting him up like a jack-knife. When he
reached the windmill, he swayed and caught at the ladder. He saw
Polly coming down the hill, running with the swiftness of a slim
greyhound. In a flash she had her shoulder under his armpit.</p>

<p>"Lean on me, Father, hard! Don't be afraid. We can get to the
house all right."</p>

<p>Somehow they did, though Rosicky became blind with pain; he could
keep on his legs, but he couldn't steer his course. The next thing he
was conscious of was lying on Polly's bed, and Polly bending over him
wringing out bath towels in hot water and putting them on his chest.
She stopped only to throw coal into the stove, and she kept the
tea-kettle and the black pot going. She put these hot applications on
him for nearly an hour, she told him afterwards, and all that time he
was drawn up stiff and blue, with the sweat pouring off him.</p>

<p>As the pain gradually loosed its grip, the stiffness went out of
his jaws, the black circles round his eyes disappeared, and a little
of his natural colour came back. When his daughter-in-law buttoned
his shirt over his chest at last, he sighed.</p>

<p>"Da's fine, de way I feel now, Polly. It was a awful bad spell,
an' I was so sorry it all come on you like it did."</p>

<p>Polly was flushed and excited. "Is the pain really gone? Can I
leave you long enough to telephone over to your place?"</p>

<p>Rosicky's eyelids fluttered. "Don't telephone, Polly. It ain't no
use to scare my wife. It's nice and quiet here, an' if I ain't too
much trouble to you, just let me lay still till I feel like myself. I
ain't got no pain now. It's nice here."</p>

<p>Polly bent over him and wiped the moisture from his face. "Oh, I'm
so glad it's over!" she broke out impulsively. "It just broke my
heart to see you suffer so, Father."</p>

<p>Rosicky motioned her to sit down on the chair where the tea-kettle
had been, and looked up at her with that lively affectionate gleam in
his eyes. "You was awful good to me, I won't never forgit dat. I hate
it to be sick on you like dis. Down at de barn I say to myself, dat
young girl ain't had much experience in sickness, I don't want to
scare her, an' maybe she's got a baby comin' or somet'ing."</p>

<p>Polly took his hand. He was looking at her so intently and
affectionately and confidingly; his eyes seemed to caress her face,
to regard it with pleasure. She frowned with her funny streaks of
eyebrows, and then smiled back at him.</p>

<p>"I guess maybe there is something of that kind going to happen.
But I haven't told anyone yet, not my mother or Rudolph. You'll be
the first to know."</p>

<p>His hand pressed hers. She noticed that it was warm again. The
twinkle in his yellow-brown eyes seemed to come nearer.</p>

<p>"I like mighty well to see dat little child, Polly," was all he
said. Then he closed his eyes and lay half-smiling. But Polly sat
still, thinking hard. She had a sudden feeling that nobody in the
world, not her mother, not Rudolph, or anyone, really loved her as
much as old Rosicky did. It perplexed her. She sat frowning and
trying to puzzle it out. It was as if Rosicky had a special gift for
loving people, something that was like an ear for music or an eye for
colour. It was quiet, unobtrusive; it was merely there. You saw it in
his eyes,--perhaps that was why they were merry. You felt it in his
hands, too. After he dropped off to sleep, she sat holding his warm,
broad, flexible brown hand. She had never seen another in the least
like it. She wondered if it wasn't a kind of gypsy hand, it was so
alive and quick and light in its communications,--very strange in a
farmer. Nearly all the farmers she knew had huge lumps of fists, like
mauls, or they were knotty and bony and uncomfortable-looking, with
stiff fingers. But Rosicky's was like quicksilver, flexible,
muscular, about the colour of a pale cigar, with deep, deep creases
across the palm. It wasn't nervous, it wasn't a stupid lump; it was a
warm brown human hand, with some cleverness in it, a great deal of
generosity, and something else which Polly could only call
"gypsy-like,"--something nimble and lively and sure, in the way that
animals are.</p>

<p>Polly remembered that hour long afterwards; it had been like an
awakening to her. It seemed to her that she had never learned so much
about life from anything as from old Rosicky's hand. It brought her
to herself; it communicated some direct and untranslatable
message.</p>

<p>When she heard Rudolph coming in the car, she ran out to meet
him.</p>

<p>"Oh, Rudy, your father's been awful sick! He raked up those
thistles he's been worrying about, and afterwards he could hardly get
to the house. He suffered so I was afraid he was going to die."</p>

<p>Rudolph jumped to the ground. "Where is he now?"</p>

<p>"On the bed. He's asleep. I was terribly scared, because, you
know, I'm so fond of your father." She slipped her arm through his
and they went into the house. That afternoon they took Rosicky home
and put him to bed, though he protested that he was quite well
again.</p>

<p>The next morning he got up and dressed and sat down to breakfast
with his family. He told Mary that his coffee tasted better than
usual to him, and he warned the boys not to bear any tales to Doctor
Ed when he got home. After breakfast he sat down by his window to do
some patching and asked Mary to thread several needles for him before
she went to feed her chickens,--her eyes were better than his, and
her hands steadier. He lit his pipe and took up John's overalls. Mary
had been watching him anxiously all morning, and as she went out of
the door with her bucket of scraps, she saw that he was smiling. He
was thinking, indeed, about Polly, and how he might never have known
what a tender heart she had if he hadn't got sick over there. Girls
nowadays didn't wear their heart on their sleeve. But now he knew
Polly would make a fine woman after the foolishness wore off. Either
a woman had that sweetness at her heart or she hadn't. You couldn't
always tell by the look of them; but if they had that, everything
came out right in the end.</p>

<p>After he had taken a few stitches, the cramp began in his chest,
like yesterday. He put his pipe cautiously down on the window-sill
and bent over to ease the pull. No use,--he had better try to get to
his bed if he could. He rose and groped his way across the familiar
floor, which was rising and falling like the deck of a ship. At the
door he fell. When Mary came in, she found him lying there, and the
moment she touched him she knew that he was gone.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>Doctor Ed was away when Rosicky died, and for the first few weeks
after he got home he was hard driven. Every day he said to himself
that he must get out to see that family that had lost their father.
One soft, warm moonlight night in early summer he started for the
farm. His mind was on other things, and not until his road ran by the
graveyard did he realize that Rosicky wasn't over there on the hill
where the red lamplight shone, but here, in the moonlight. He stopped
his car, shut off the engine, and sat there for a while.</p>

<p>A sudden hush had fallen on his soul. Everything here seemed
strangely moving and significant, though signifying what, he did not
know. Close by the wire fence stood Rosicky's mowing-machine, where
one of the boys had been cutting hay that afternoon; his own
workhorses had been going up and down there. The new-cut hay perfumed
all the night air. The moonlight silvered the long, billowy grass
that grew over the graves and hid the fence; the few little
evergreens stood out black in it, like shadows in a pool. The sky was
very blue and soft, the stars rather faint because the moon was
full.</p>

<p>For the first time it struck Doctor Ed that this was really a
beautiful graveyard. He thought of city cemeteries; acres of
shrubbery and heavy stone, so arranged and lonely and unlike anything
in the living world. Cities of the dead, indeed; cities of the
forgotten, of the "put away." But this was open and free, this little
square of long grass which the wind for ever stirred. Nothing but the
sky overhead, and the many-coloured fields running on until they met
that sky. The horses worked here in summer; the neighbours passed on
their way to town; and over yonder, in the cornfield, Rosicky's own
cattle would be eating fodder as winter came on. Nothing could be
more un-deathlike than this place; nothing could be more right for a
man who had helped to do the work of great cities and had always
longed for the open country and had got to it at last. Rosicky's life
seemed to him complete and beautiful.</p>

<h1><a name="S02"><i>OLD MRS. HARRIS</i></a></h1>

<p> </p>

<h2>I</h2>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>Mrs. David Rosen, cross-stitch in hand, sat looking out of the
window across her own green lawn to the ragged, sunburned back yard
of her neighbours on the right. Occasionally she glanced anxiously
over her shoulder toward her shining kitchen, with a black and white
linoleum floor in big squares, like a marble pavement.</p>

<p>"Will dat woman never go?" she muttered impatiently, just under
her breath. She spoke with a slight accent--it affected only her
<i>th's,</i> and, occasionally, the letter <i>v.</i> But people in
Skyline thought this unfortunate, in a woman whose superiority they
recognized.</p>

<p>Mrs. Rosen ran out to move the sprinkler to another spot on the
lawn, and in doing so she saw what she had been waiting to see. From
the house next door a tall, handsome woman emerged, dressed in white
broadcloth and a hat with white lilacs; she carried a sunshade and
walked with a free, energetic step, as if she were going out on a
pleasant errand.</p>

<p>Mrs. Rosen darted quickly back into the house, lest her neighbour
should hail her and stop to talk. She herself was in her kitchen
housework dress, a crisp blue chambray which fitted smoothly over her
tightly corseted figure, and her lustrous black hair was done in two
smooth braids, wound flat at the back of her head, like a braided
rug. She did not stop for a hat--her dark, ruddy, salmon-tinted skin
had little to fear from the sun. She opened the half-closed oven door
and took out a symmetrically plaited coffee-cake, beautifully
browned, delicately peppered over with poppy seeds, with sugary
margins about the twists. On the kitchen table a tray stood ready
with cups and saucers. She wrapped the cake in a napkin, snatched up
a little French coffee-pot with a black wooden handle, and ran across
her green lawn, through the alley-way and the sandy, unkept yard next
door, and entered her neighbour's house by the kitchen.</p>

<p>The kitchen was hot and empty, full of the untempered afternoon
sun. A door stood open into the next room; a cluttered, hideous room,
yet somehow homely. There, beside a goods-box covered with figured
oilcloth, stood an old woman in a brown calico dress, washing her hot
face and neck at a tin basin. She stood with her feet wide apart, in
an attitude of profound weariness. She started guiltily as the
visitor entered.</p>

<p>"Don't let me disturb you, Grandma," called Mrs. Rosen. "I always
have my coffee at dis hour in the afternoon. I was just about to sit
down to it when I thought: 'I will run over and see if Grandma Harris
won't take a cup with me.' I hate to drink my coffee alone."</p>

<p>Grandma looked troubled,--at a loss. She folded her towel and
concealed it behind a curtain hung across the corner of the room to
make a poor sort of closet. The old lady was always composed in
manner, but it was clear that she felt embarrassment.</p>

<p>"Thank you, Mrs. Rosen. What a pity Victoria just this minute went
down town!"</p>

<p>"But dis time I came to see you yourself, Grandma. Don't let me
disturb you. Sit down there in your own rocker, and I will put my
tray on this little chair between us, so!"</p>

<p>Mrs. Harris sat down in her black wooden rocking-chair with curved
arms and a faded cretonne pillow on the wooden seat. It stood in the
corner beside a narrow spindle-frame lounge. She looked on silently
while Mrs. Rosen uncovered the cake and delicately broke it with her
plump, smooth, dusky-red hands. The old lady did not seem
pleased,--seemed uncertain and apprehensive, indeed. But she was not
fussy or fidgety. She had the kind of quiet, intensely quiet, dignity
that comes from complete resignation to the chances of life. She
watched Mrs. Rosen's deft hands out of grave, steady brown eyes.</p>

<p>"Dis is Mr. Rosen's favourite coffee-cake, Grandma, and I want you
to try it. You are such a good cook yourself, I would like your
opinion of my cake."</p>

<p>"It's very nice, ma'am," said Mrs. Harris politely, but without
enthusiasm.</p>

<p>"And you aren't drinking your coffee; do you like more cream in
it?"</p>

<p>"No, thank you. I'm letting it cool a little. I generally drink it
that way."</p>

<p>"Of course she does," thought Mrs. Rosen, "since she never has her
coffee until all the family are done breakfast!"</p>

<p>Mrs. Rosen had brought Grandma Harris coffee-cake time and again,
but she knew that Grandma merely tasted it and saved it for her
daughter Victoria, who was as fond of sweets as her own children, and
jealous about them, moreover,--couldn't bear that special dainties
should come into the house for anyone but herself. Mrs. Rosen, vexed
at her failures, had determined that just once she would take a cake
to "de old lady Harris," and with her own eyes see her eat it. The
result was not all she had hoped. Receiving a visitor alone,
unsupervised by her daughter, having cake and coffee that should
properly be saved for Victoria, was all so irregular that Mrs. Harris
could not enjoy it. Mrs. Rosen doubted if she tasted the cake as she
swallowed it,--certainly she ate it without relish, as a hollow form.
But Mrs. Rosen enjoyed her own cake, at any rate, and she was glad of
an opportunity to sit quietly and look at Grandmother, who was more
interesting to her than the handsome Victoria.</p>

<p>It was a queer place to be having coffee, when Mrs. Rosen liked
order and comeliness so much: a hideous, cluttered room, furnished
with a rocking-horse, a sewing-machine, an empty baby-buggy. A walnut
table stood against a blind window, piled high with old magazines and
tattered books, and children's caps and coats. There was a wash-stand
(two wash-stands, if you counted the oilcloth-covered box as one). A
corner of the room was curtained off with some black-and-red-striped
cotton goods, for a clothes closet. In another corner was the wooden
lounge with a thin mattress and a red calico spread which was
Grandma's bed. Beside it was her wooden rocking-chair, and the little
splint-bottom chair with the legs sawed short on which her
darning-basket usually stood, but which Mrs. Rosen was now using for
a tea-table.</p>

<p>The old lady was always impressive, Mrs. Rosen was thinking,--one
could not say why. Perhaps it was the way she held her head,--so
simply, unprotesting and unprotected; or the gravity of her large,
deep-set brown eyes, a warm, reddish brown, though their look, always
direct, seemed to ask nothing and hope for nothing. They were not
cold, but inscrutable, with no kindling gleam of intercourse in them.
There was the kind of nobility about her head that there is about an
old lion's: an absence of self-consciousness, vanity,
preoccupation--something absolute. Her grey hair was parted in the
middle, wound in two little horns over her ears, and done in a little
flat knot behind. Her mouth was large and composed,--resigned, the
corners drooping. Mrs. Rosen had very seldom heard her laugh (and
then it was a gentle, polite laugh which meant only politeness). But
she had observed that whenever Mrs. Harris's grandchildren were
about, tumbling all over her, asking for cookies, teasing her to read
to them, the old lady looked happy.</p>

<p>As she drank her coffee, Mrs. Rosen tried one subject after
another to engage Mrs. Harris's attention.</p>

<p>"Do you feel this hot weather, Grandma? I am afraid you are over
the stove too much. Let those naughty children have a cold lunch
occasionally."</p>

<p>"No'm, I don't mind the heat. It's apt to come on like this for a
spell in May. I don't feel the stove. I'm accustomed to it."</p>

<p>"Oh, so am I! But I get very impatient with my cooking in hot
weather. Do you miss your old home in Tennessee very much,
Grandma?"</p>

<p>"No'm, I can't say I do. Mr. Templeton thought Colorado was a
better place to bring up the children."</p>

<p>"But you had things much more comfortable down there, I'm sure.
These little wooden houses are too hot in summer."</p>

<p>"Yes'm, we were more comfortable. We had more room."</p>

<p>"And a flower-garden, and beautiful old trees, Mrs. Templeton told
me."</p>

<p>"Yes'm, we had a great deal of shade."</p>

<p>Mrs. Rosen felt that she was not getting anywhere. She almost
believed that Grandma thought she had come on an equivocal errand, to
spy out something in Victoria's absence. Well, perhaps she had! Just
for once she would like to get past the others to the real
grandmother,--and the real grandmother was on her guard, as always.
At this moment she heard a faint miaow. Mrs. Harris rose, lifting
herself by the wooden arms of her chair, said: "Excuse me," went into
the kitchen, and opened the screen door.</p>

<p>In walked a large, handsome, thickly furred Maltese cat, with long
whiskers and yellow eyes and a white star on his breast. He preceded
Grandmother, waited until she sat down. Then he sprang up into her
lap and settled himself comfortably in the folds of her full-gathered
calico skirt. He rested his chin in his deep bluish fur and regarded
Mrs. Rosen. It struck her that he held his head in just the way
Grandmother held hers. And Grandmother now became more alive, as if
some missing part of herself were restored.</p>

<p>"This is Blue Boy," she said, stroking him. "In winter, when the
screen door ain't on, he lets himself in. He stands up on his hind
legs and presses the thumb-latch with his paw, and just walks in like
anybody."</p>

<p>"He's your cat, isn't he, Grandma?" Mrs. Rosen couldn't help
prying just a little; if she could find but a single thing that was
Grandma's own!</p>

<p>"He's our cat," replied Mrs. Harris. "We're all very fond of him.
I expect he's Vickie's more'n anybody's."</p>

<p>"Of course!" groaned Mrs. Rosen to herself. "Dat Vickie is her
mother over again."</p>

<p>Here Mrs. Harris made her first unsolicited remark. "If you was to
be troubled with mice at any time, Mrs. Rosen, ask one of the boys to
bring Blue Boy over to you, and he'll clear them out. He's a master
mouser." She scratched the thick blue fur at the back of his neck,
and he began a deep purring. Mrs. Harris smiled. "We call that
spinning, back with us. Our children still say: 'Listen to Blue Boy
spin,' though none of 'em is ever heard a spinning-wheel--except
maybe Vickie remembers."</p>

<p>"Did you have a spinning-wheel in your own house, Grandma
Harris?"</p>

<p>"Yes'm. Miss Sadie Crummer used to come and spin for us. She was
left with no home of her own, and it was to give her something to do,
as much as anything, that we had her. I spun a good deal myself, in
my young days." Grandmother stopped and put her hands on the arms of
her chair, as if to rise. "Did you hear a door open? It might be
Victoria."</p>

<p>"No, it was the wind shaking the screen door. Mrs. Templeton won't
be home yet. She is probably in my husband's store this minute,
ordering him about. All the merchants down town will take anything
from your daughter. She is very popular wid de gentlemen,
Grandma."</p>

<p>Mrs. Harris smiled complacently. "Yes'm. Victoria was always much
admired."</p>

<p>At this moment a chorus of laughter broke in upon the warm
silence, and a host of children, as it seemed to Mrs. Rosen, ran
through the yard. The hand-pump on the back porch, outside the
kitchen door, began to scrape and gurgle.</p>

<p>"It's the children, back from school," said Grandma. "They are
getting a cool drink."</p>

<p>"But where is the baby, Grandma?"</p>

<p>"Vickie took Hughie in his cart over to Mr. Holliday's yard, where
she studies. She's right good about minding him."</p>

<p>Mrs. Rosen was glad to hear that Vickie was good for
something.</p>

<p>Three little boys came running in through the kitchen; the twins,
aged ten, and Ronald, aged six, who went to kindergarten. They
snatched off their caps and threw their jackets and school bags on
the table, the sewing-machine, the rocking-horse.</p>

<p>"Howdy do, Mrs. Rosen." They spoke to her nicely. They had nice
voices, nice faces, and were always courteous, like their father. "We
are going to play in our back yard with some of the boys, Gram'ma,"
said one of the twins respectfully, and they ran out to join a troop
of schoolmates who were already shouting and racing over that poor
trampled back yard, strewn with velocipedes and croquet mallets and
toy wagons, which was such an eyesore to Mrs. Rosen.</p>

<p>Mrs. Rosen got up and took her tray.</p>

<p>"Can't you stay a little, ma'am? Victoria will be here any
minute."</p>

<p>But her tone let Mrs. Rosen know that Grandma really wished her to
leave before Victoria returned.</p>

<p>A few moments after Mrs. Rosen had put the tray down in her own
kitchen, Victoria Templeton came up the wooden sidewalk, attended by
Mr. Rosen, who had quitted his store half an hour earlier than usual
for the pleasure of walking home with her. Mrs. Templeton stopped by
the picket fence to smile at the children playing in the back
yard,--and it was a real smile, she was glad to see them.</p>

<p>She called Ronald over to the fence to give him a kiss. He was hot
and sticky.</p>

<p>"Was your teacher nice today? Now run in and ask Grandma to wash
your face and put a clean waist on you."</p>

<p> </p>

<p>That night Mrs. Harris got supper with an effort--had to drive
herself harder than usual. Mandy, the bound girl they had brought
with them from the South, noticed that the old lady was uncertain and
short of breath. The hours from two to four, when Mrs. Harris usually
rested, had not been at all restful this afternoon. There was an
understood rule that Grandmother was not to receive visitors alone.
Mrs. Rosen's call, and her cake and coffee, were too much out of the
accepted order. Nervousness had prevented the old lady from getting
any repose during her visit.</p>

<p>After the rest of the family had left the supper table, she went
into the dining-room and took her place, but she ate very little. She
put away the food that was left, and then, while Mandy washed the
dishes, Grandma sat down in her rocking-chair in the dark and
dozed.</p>

<p>The three little boys came in from playing under the electric
light (arc lights had been but lately installed in Skyline) and began
begging Mrs. Harris to read <i>Tom Sawyer</i> to them. Grandmother
loved to read, anything at all, the Bible or the continued story in
the Chicago weekly paper. She roused herself, lit her brass "safety
lamp," and pulled her black rocker out of its corner to the
wash-stand (the table was too far away from her corner, and anyhow it
was completely covered with coats and school satchels). She put on
her old-fashioned silver-rimmed spectacles and began to read. Ronald
lay down on Grandmother's lounge bed, and the twins, Albert and
Adelbert, called Bert and Del, sat down against the wall, one on a
low box covered with felt, and the other on the little sawed-off
chair upon which Mrs. Rosen had served coffee. They looked intently
at Mrs. Harris, and she looked intently at the book.</p>

<p>Presently Vickie, the oldest grandchild, came in. She was fifteen.
Her mother was entertaining callers in the parlour, callers who
didn't interest Vickie, so she was on her way up to her own room by
the kitchen stairway.</p>

<p>Mrs. Harris looked up over her glasses. "Vickie, maybe you'd take
the book awhile, and I can do my darning."</p>

<p>"All right," said Vickie. Reading aloud was one of the things she
would always do toward the general comfort. She sat down by the
wash-stand and went on with the story. Grandmother got her
darning-basket and began to drive her needle across great knee-holes
in the boys' stockings. Sometimes she nodded for a moment, and her
hands fell into her lap. After a while the little boy on the lounge
went to sleep. But the twins sat upright, their hands on their knees,
their round brown eyes fastened upon Vickie, and when there was
anything funny, they giggled. They were chubby, dark-skinned little
boys, with round jolly faces, white teeth, and yellow-brown eyes that
were always bubbling with fun unless they were sad,--even then their
eyes never got red or weepy. Their tears sparkled and fell; left no
trace but a streak on the cheeks, perhaps.</p>

<p>Presently old Mrs. Harris gave out a long snore of utter defeat.
She had been overcome at last. Vickie put down the book. "That's
enough for tonight. Grandmother's sleepy, and Ronald's fast asleep.
What'll we do with him?"</p>

<p>"Bert and me'll get him undressed," said Adelbert. The twins
roused the sleepy little boy and prodded him up the back stairway to
the bare room without window blinds, where he was put into his cot
beside their double bed. Vickie's room was across the narrow hallway;
not much bigger than a closet, but, anyway, it was her own. She had a
chair and an old dresser, and beside her bed was a high stool which
she used as a lamp-table,--she always read in bed.</p>

<p>After Vickie went upstairs, the house was quiet. Hughie, the baby,
was asleep in his mother's room, and Victoria herself, who still
treated her husband as if he were her "beau," had persuaded him to
take her down town to the ice-cream parlour. Grandmother's room,
between the kitchen and the dining-room, was rather like a
passage-way; but now that the children were upstairs and Victoria was
off enjoying herself somewhere, Mrs. Harris could be sure of enough
privacy to undress. She took off the calico cover from her lounge bed
and folded it up, put on her nightgown and white nightcap.</p>

<p>Mandy, the bound girl, appeared at the kitchen door.</p>

<p>"Miz' Harris," she said in a guarded tone, ducking her head, "you
want me to rub your feet for you?"</p>

<p>For the first time in the long day the old woman's low composure
broke a little. "Oh, Mandy, I would take it kindly of you!" she
breathed gratefully.</p>

<p>That had to be done in the kitchen; Victoria didn't like anybody
slopping about. Mrs. Harris put an old checked shawl round her
shoulders and followed Mandy. Beside the kitchen stove Mandy had a
little wooden tub full of warm water. She knelt down and untied Mrs.
Harris's garter strings and took off her flat cloth slippers and
stockings.</p>

<p>"Oh, Miz' Harris, your feet an' legs is swelled turrible
tonight!"</p>

<p>"I expect they air, Mandy. They feel like it."</p>

<p>"Pore soul!" murmured Mandy. She put Grandma's feet in the tub
and, crouching beside it, slowly, slowly rubbed her swollen legs.
Mandy was tired, too. Mrs. Harris sat in her nightcap and shawl, her
hands crossed in her lap. She never asked for this greatest solace of
the day; it was something that Mandy gave, who had nothing else to
give. If there could be a comparison in absolutes, Mandy was the
needier of the two,--but she was younger. The kitchen was quiet and
full of shadow, with only the light from an old lantern. Neither
spoke. Mrs. Harris dozed from comfort, and Mandy herself was half
asleep as she performed one of the oldest rites of compassion.</p>

<p>Although Mrs. Harris's lounge had no springs, only a thin cotton
mattress between her and the wooden slats, she usually went to sleep
as soon as she was in bed. To be off her feet, to lie flat, to say
over the psalm beginning: <i>"The Lord is my shepherd"</i> was
comfort enough. About four o'clock in the morning, however, she would
begin to feel the hard slats under her, and the heaviness of the old
home-made quilts, with weight but little warmth, on top of her. Then
she would reach under her pillow for her little comforter (she called
it that to herself) that Mrs. Rosen had given her. It was a tan
sweater of very soft brushed wool, with one sleeve torn and ragged. A
young nephew from Chicago had spent a fortnight with Mrs. Rosen last
summer and had left this behind him. One morning, when Mrs. Harris
went out to the stable at the back of the yard to pat Buttercup, the
cow, Mrs. Rosen ran across the alley-way.</p>

<p>"Grandma Harris," she said, coming into the shelter of the stable,
"I wonder if you could make any use of this sweater Sammy left? The
yarn might be good for your darning."</p>

<p>Mrs. Harris felt of the article gravely. Mrs. Rosen thought her
face brightened. "Yes'm, indeed I could use it. I thank you
kindly."</p>

<p>She slipped it under her apron, carried it into the house with
her, and concealed it under her mattress. There she had kept it ever
since. She knew Mrs. Rosen understood how it was; that Victoria
couldn't bear to have anything come into the house that was not for
her to dispose of.</p>

<p>On winter nights, and even on summer nights after the cocks began
to crow, Mrs. Harris often felt cold and lonely about the chest.
Sometimes her cat, Blue Boy, would creep in beside her and warm that
aching spot. But on spring and summer nights he was likely to be
abroad skylarking, and this little sweater had become the dearest of
Grandmother's few possessions. It was kinder to her, she used to
think, as she wrapped it about her middle, than any of her own
children had been. She had married at eighteen and had had eight
children; but some died, and some were, as she said, scattered.</p>

<p>After she was warm in that tender spot under the ribs, the old
woman could lie patiently on the slats, waiting for daybreak;
thinking about the comfortable rambling old house in Tennessee, its
feather beds and hand-woven rag carpets and splint-bottom chairs, the
mahogany sideboard, and the marble-top parlour table; all that she
had left behind to follow Victoria's fortunes.</p>

<p>She did not regret her decision; indeed, there had been no
decision. Victoria had never once thought it possible that Ma should
not go wherever she and the children went, and Mrs. Harris had never
thought it possible. Of course she regretted Tennessee, though she
would never admit it to Mrs. Rosen:--the old neighbours, the yard and
garden she had worked in all her life, the apple trees she had
planted, the lilac arbour, tall enough to walk in, which she had
clipped and shaped so many years. Especially she missed her lemon
tree, in a tub on the front porch, which bore little lemons almost
every summer, and folks would come for miles to see it.</p>

<p>But the road had led westward, and Mrs. Harris didn't believe that
women, especially old women, could say when or where they would stop.
They were tied to the chariot of young life, and had to go where it
went, because they were needed. Mrs. Harris had gathered from Mrs.
Rosen's manner, and from comments she occasionally dropped, that the
Jewish people had an altogether different attitude toward their old
folks; therefore her friendship with this kind neighbour was almost
as disturbing as it was pleasant. She didn't want Mrs. Rosen to think
that she was "put upon," that there was anything unusual or pitiful
in her lot. To be pitied was the deepest hurt anybody could know. And
if Victoria once suspected Mrs. Rosen's indignation, it would be all
over. She would freeze her neighbour out, and that friendly voice,
that quick pleasant chatter with the little foreign twist, would
thenceforth be heard only at a distance, in the alley-way or across
the fence. Victoria had a good heart, but she was terribly proud and
could not bear the least criticism.</p>

<p>As soon as the grey light began to steal into the room, Mrs.
Harris would get up softly and wash at the basin on the
oilcloth-covered box. She would wet her hair above her forehead, comb
it with a little bone comb set in a tin rim, do it up in two smooth
little horns over her ears, wipe the comb dry, and put it away in the
pocket of her full-gathered calico skirt. She left nothing lying
about. As soon as she was dressed, she made her bed, folding her
nightgown and nightcap under the pillow, the sweater under the
mattress. She smoothed the heavy quilts, and drew the red calico
spread neatly over all. Her towel was hung on its special nail behind
the curtain. Her soap she kept in a tin tobacco-box; the children's
soap was in a crockery saucer. If her soap or towel got mixed up with
the children's, Victoria was always sharp about it. The little rented
house was much too small for the family, and Mrs. Harris and her
"things" were almost required to be invisible. Two clean calico
dresses hung in the curtained corner; another was on her back, and a
fourth was in the wash. Behind the curtain there was always a good
supply of aprons; Victoria bought them at church fairs, and it was a
great satisfaction to Mrs. Harris to put on a clean one whenever she
liked. Upstairs, in Mandy's attic room over the kitchen, hung a black
cashmere dress and a black bonnet with a long cr&ecirc;pe veil, for
the rare occasions when Mr. Templeton hired a double buggy and horses
and drove his family to a picnic or to Decoration Day exercises. Mrs.
Harris rather dreaded these drives, for Victoria was usually cross
afterwards.</p>

<p>When Mrs. Harris went out into the kitchen to get breakfast, Mandy
always had the fire started and the water boiling. They enjoyed a
quiet half-hour before the little boys came running down the stairs,
always in a good humour. In winter the boys had their breakfast in
the kitchen, with Vickie. Mrs. Harris made Mandy eat the cakes and
fried ham the children left, so that she would not fast so long. Mr.
and Mrs. Templeton breakfasted rather late, in the dining-room, and
they always had fruit and thick cream,--a small pitcher of the very
thickest was for Mrs. Templeton. The children were never fussy about
their food. As Grandmother often said feelingly to Mrs. Rosen, they
were as little trouble as children could possibly be. They sometimes
tore their clothes, of course, or got sick. But even when Albert had
an abscess in his ear and was in such pain, he would lie for hours on
Grandmother's lounge with his cheek on a bag of hot salt, if only she
or Vickie would read aloud to him.</p>

<p>"It's true, too, what de old lady says," remarked Mrs. Rosen to
her husband one night at supper, "dey are nice children. No one ever
taught them anything, but they have good instincts, even dat Vickie.
And think, if you please, of all the self-sacrificing mothers we
know,--Fannie and Esther, to come near home; how they have planned
for those children from infancy and given them every advantage. And
now ingratitude and coldness is what dey meet with."</p>

<p>Mr. Rosen smiled his teasing smile. "Evidently your sister and
mine have the wrong method. The way to make your children unselfish
is to be comfortably selfish yourself."</p>

<p>"But dat woman takes no more responsibility for her children than
a cat takes for her kittens. Nor does poor young Mr. Templeton, for
dat matter. How can he expect to get so many children started in
life, I ask you? It is not at all fair!"</p>

<p>Mr. Rosen sometimes had to hear altogether too much about the
Templetons, but he was patient, because it was a bitter sorrow to
Mrs. Rosen that she had no children. There was nothing else in the
world she wanted so much.</p>

<p> </p>

<h2>III</h2>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>Mrs. Rosen in one of her blue working dresses, the indigo blue
that became a dark skin and dusky red cheeks with a tone of salmon
colour, was in her shining kitchen, washing her beautiful dishes--her
neighbours often wondered why she used her best china and linen every
day--when Vickie Templeton came in with a book under her arm.</p>

<p>"Good day, Mrs. Rosen. Can I have the second volume?"</p>

<p>"Certainly. You know where the books are." She spoke coolly, for
it always annoyed her that Vickie never suggested wiping the dishes
or helping with such household work as happened to be going on when
she dropped in. She hated the girl's bringing-up so much that
sometimes she almost hated the girl.</p>

<p>Vickie strolled carelessly through the dining-room into the
parlour and opened the doors of one of the big bookcases. Mr. Rosen
had a large library, and a great many unusual books. There was a
complete set of the Waverley Novels in German, for example; thick,
dumpy little volumes bound in tooled leather, with very black type
and dramatic engravings printed on wrinkled, yellowing pages. There
were many French books, and some of the German classics done into
English, such as Coleridge's translation of Schiller's
<i>Wallenstein.</i></p>

<p>Of course no other house in Skyline was in the least like Mrs.
Rosen's; it was the nearest thing to an art gallery and a museum that
the Templetons had ever seen. All the rooms were carpeted alike (that
was very unusual), with a soft velvet carpet, little blue and rose
flowers scattered on a rose-grey ground. The deep chairs were
upholstered in dark blue velvet. The walls were hung with engravings
in pale gold frames: some of Raphael's "Hours," a large soft
engraving of a castle on the Rhine, and another of cypress trees
about a Roman ruin, under a full moon. There were a number of
water-colour sketches, made in Italy by Mr. Rosen himself when he was
a boy. A rich uncle had taken him abroad as his secretary. Mr. Rosen
was a reflective, unambitious man, who didn't mind keeping a
clothing-store in a little Western town, so long as he had a great
deal of time to read philosophy. He was the only unsuccessful member
of a large, rich Jewish family.</p>

<p>Last August, when the heat was terrible in Skyline, and the crops
were burned up on all the farms to the north, and the wind from the
pink and yellow sand-hills to the south blew so hot that it singed
the few green lawns in the town, Vickie had taken to dropping in upon
Mrs. Rosen at the very hottest part of the afternoon. Mrs. Rosen
knew, of course, that it was probably because the girl had no other
cool and quiet place to go--her room at home under the roof would be
hot enough! Now, Mrs. Rosen liked to undress and take a nap from
three to five,--if only to get out of her tight corsets, for she
would have an hourglass figure at any cost. She told Vickie firmly
that she was welcome to come if she would read in the parlour with
the blind up only a little way, and would be as still as a mouse.
Vickie came, meekly enough, but she seldom read. She would take a
sofa pillow and lie down on the soft carpet and look up at the
pictures in the dusky room, and feel a happy, pleasant excitement
from the heat and glare outside and the deep shadow and quiet within.
Curiously enough, Mrs. Rosen's house never made her dissatisfied with
her own; she thought that very nice, too.</p>

<p>Mrs. Rosen, leaving her kitchen in a state of such perfection as
the Templetons were unable to sense or to admire, came into the
parlour and found her visitor sitting cross-legged on the floor
before one of the bookcases.</p>

<p>"Well, Vickie, and how did you get along with <i>Wilhelm
Meister?</i>"</p>

<p>"I like it," said Vickie.</p>

<p>Mrs. Rosen shrugged. The Templetons always said that; quite as if
a book or a cake were lucky to win their approbation.</p>

<p>"Well, <i>what</i> did you like?"</p>

<p>"I guess I liked all that about the theatre and Shakspere
best."</p>

<p>"It's rather celebrated," remarked Mrs. Rosen dryly. "And are you
studying every day? Do you think you will be able to win that
scholarship?"</p>

<p>"I don't know. I'm going to try awful hard."</p>

<p>Mrs. Rosen wondered whether any Templeton knew how to try very
hard. She reached for her work-basket and began to do cross-stitch.
It made her nervous to sit with folded hands.</p>

<p>Vickie was looking at a German book in her lap, an illustrated
edition of <i>Faust.</i> She had stopped at a very German picture of
Gretchen entering the church, with Faustus gazing at her from behind
a rose tree, Mephisto at his shoulder.</p>

<p>"I wish I could read this," she said, frowning at the black Gothic
text. "It's splendid, isn't it?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Rosen rolled her eyes upward and sighed. "Oh, my dear, one of
de world's masterpieces!"</p>

<p>That meant little to Vickie. She had not been taught to respect
masterpieces, she had no scale of that sort in her mind. She cared
about a book only because it took hold of her.</p>

<p>She kept turning over the pages. Between the first and second
parts, in this edition, there was inserted the <i>Dies Ir&aelig;</i>
hymn in full. She stopped and puzzled over it for a long while.</p>

<p>"Here is something I can read," she said, showing the page to Mrs.
Rosen.</p>

<p>Mrs. Rosen looked up from her cross-stitch. "There you have the
advantage of me. I do not read Latin. You might translate it for
me."</p>

<p>Vickie began:</p>

<p> </p>

<blockquote>
<p>"Day of wrath, upon that day<br>
 The world to ashes melts away,<br>
 As David and the Sibyl say.</p>
</blockquote>

<p> </p>

<p>"But that don't give you the rhyme; every line ought to end in two
syllables."</p>

<p>"Never mind if it doesn't give the metre," corrected Mrs. Rosen
kindly; "go on, if you can."</p>

<p>Vickie went on stumbling through the Latin verses, and Mrs. Rosen
sat watching her. You couldn't tell about Vickie. She wasn't pretty,
yet Mrs. Rosen found her attractive. She liked her sturdy build, and
the steady vitality that glowed in her rosy skin and dark blue
eyes,--even gave a springy quality to her curly reddish-brown hair,
which she still wore in a single braid down her back. Mrs. Rosen
liked to have Vickie about because she was never listless or dreamy
or apathetic. A half-smile nearly always played about her lips and
eyes, and it was there because she was pleased with something, not
because she wanted to be agreeable. Even a half-smile made her cheeks
dimple. She had what her mother called "a happy disposition."</p>

<p>When she finished the verses, Mrs. Rosen nodded approvingly.
"Thank you, Vickie. The very next time I go to Chicago, I will try to
get an English translation of <i>Faust</i> for you."</p>

<p>"But I want to read this one." Vickie's open smile darkened. "What
I want is to pick up any of these books and just read them, like you
and Mr. Rosen do."</p>

<p>The dusky red of Mrs. Rosen's cheeks grew a trifle deeper. Vickie
never paid compliments, absolutely never; but if she really admired
anyone, something in her voice betrayed it so convincingly that one
felt flattered. When she dropped a remark of this kind, she added
another link to the chain of responsibility which Mrs. Rosen
unwillingly bore and tried to shake off--the irritating sense of
being somehow responsible for Vickie, since, God knew, no one else
felt responsible.</p>

<p>Once or twice, when she happened to meet pleasant young Mr.
Templeton alone, she had tried to talk to him seriously about his
daughter's future. "She has finished de school here, and she should
be getting training of some sort; she is growing up," she told him
severely.</p>

<p>He laughed and said in his way that was so honest, and so
disarmingly sweet and frank: "Oh, don't remind me, Mrs. Rosen! I just
pretend to myself she isn't. I want to keep my little daughter as
long as I can." And there it ended.</p>

<p>Sometimes Vickie Templeton seemed so dense, so utterly
unperceptive, that Mrs. Rosen was ready to wash her hands of her.
Then some queer streak of sensibility in the child would make her
change her mind. Last winter, when Mrs. Rosen came home from a visit
to her sister in Chicago, she brought with her a new cloak of the
sleeveless dolman type, black velvet, lined with grey and white
squirrel skins, a grey skin next a white. Vickie, so indifferent to
clothes, fell in love with that cloak. Her eyes followed it with
delight whenever Mrs. Rosen wore it. She found it picturesque,
romantic. Mrs. Rosen had been captivated by the same thing in the
cloak, and had bought it with a shrug, knowing it would be quite out
of place in Skyline; and Mr. Rosen, when she first produced it from
her trunk, had laughed and said: "Where did you get that?--out of
<i>Rigoletto?</i>" It looked like that--but how could Vickie
know?</p>

<p>Vickie's whole family puzzled Mrs. Rosen; their feelings were so
much finer than their way of living. She bought milk from the
Templetons because they kept a cow--which Mandy milked,--and every
night one of the twins brought the milk to her in a tin pail.
Whichever boy brought it, she always called him Albert--she thought
Adelbert a silly, Southern name.</p>

<p>One night when she was fitting the lid on an empty pail, she said
severely:</p>

<p>"Now, Albert, I have put some cookies for Grandma in this pail,
wrapped in a napkin. And they are for Grandma, remember, not for your
mother or Vickie."</p>

<p>"Yes'm."</p>

<p>When she turned to him to give him the pail, she saw two full
crystal globes in the little boy's eyes, just ready to break. She
watched him go softly down the path and dash those tears away with
the back of his hand. She was sorry. She hadn't thought the little
boys realized that their household was somehow a queer one.</p>

<p>Queer or not, Mrs. Rosen liked to go there better than to most
houses in the town. There was something easy, cordial, and carefree
in the parlour that never smelled of being shut up, and the ugly
furniture looked hospitable. One felt a pleasantness in the human
relationships. These people didn't seem to know there were such
things as struggle or exactness or competition in the world. They
were always genuinely glad to see you, had time to see you, and were
usually gay in mood--all but Grandmother, who had the kind of gravity
that people who take thought of human destiny must have. But even she
liked light-heartedness in others; she drudged, indeed, to keep it
going.</p>

<p>There were houses that were better kept, certainly, but the
housekeepers had no charm, no gentleness of manner, were like hard
little machines, most of them; and some were grasping and narrow. The
Templetons were not selfish or scheming. Anyone could take advantage
of them, and many people did. Victoria might eat all the cookies her
neighbour sent in, but she would give away anything she had. She was
always ready to lend her dresses and hats and bits of jewellery for
the school theatricals, and she never worked people for favours.</p>

<p>As for Mr. Templeton (people usually called him "young Mr.
Templeton"), he was too delicate to collect his just debts. His
boyish, eager-to-please manner, his fair complexion and blue eyes and
young face, made him seem very soft to some of the hard old
money-grubbers on Main Street, and the fact that he always said "Yes,
sir," and "No, sir," to men older than himself furnished a good deal
of amusement to by-standers.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>Two years ago, when this Templeton family came to Skyline and
moved into the house next door, Mrs. Rosen was inconsolable. The new
neighbours had a lot of children, who would always be making a
racket. They put a cow and a horse into the empty barn, which would
mean dirt and flies. They strewed their back yard with packing-cases
and did not pick them up.</p>

<p>She first met Mrs. Templeton at an afternoon card party, in a
house at the extreme north end of the town, fully half a mile away,
and she had to admit that her new neighbour was an attractive woman,
and that there was something warm and genuine about her. She wasn't
in the least willowy or languishing, as Mrs. Rosen had usually found
Southern ladies to be. She was high-spirited and direct; a trifle
imperious, but with a shade of diffidence, too, as if she were trying
to adjust herself to a new group of people and to do the right
thing.</p>

<p>While they were at the party, a blinding snowstorm came on, with a
hard wind. Since they lived next door to each other, Mrs. Rosen and
Mrs. Templeton struggled homeward together through the blizzard. Mrs.
Templeton seemed delighted with the rough weather; she laughed like a
big country girl whenever she made a mis-step off the obliterated
sidewalk and sank up to her knees in a snow-drift.</p>

<p>"Take care, Mrs. Rosen," she kept calling, "keep to the right!
Don't spoil your nice coat. My, ain't this real winter? We never had
it like this back with us."</p>

<p>When they reached the Templeton's gate, Victoria wouldn't hear of
Mrs. Rosen's going farther. "No, indeed, Mrs. Rosen, you come right
in with me and get dry, and Ma'll make you a hot toddy while I take
the baby."</p>

<p>By this time Mrs. Rosen had begun to like her neighbour, so she
went in. To her surprise, the parlour was neat and comfortable--the
children did not strew things about there, apparently. The hard-coal
burner threw out a warm red glow. A faded, respectable Brussels
carpet covered the floor, an old-fashioned wooden clock ticked on the
walnut bookcase. There were a few easy chairs, and no hideous
ornaments about. She rather liked the old oil-chromos on the wall:
"Hagar and Ishmael in the Wilderness," and "The Light of the World."
While Mrs. Rosen dried her feet on the nickel base of the stove, Mrs.
Templeton excused herself and withdrew to the next room,--her
bedroom,--took off her silk dress and corsets, and put on a white
challis n&eacute;glig&eacute;e. She reappeared with the baby, who was
not crying, exactly, but making eager, passionate, gasping
entreaties,--faster and faster, tenser and tenser, as he felt his
dinner nearer and nearer and yet not his.</p>

<p>Mrs. Templeton sat down in a low rocker by the stove and began to
nurse him, holding him snugly but carelessly, still talking to Mrs.
Rosen about the card party, and laughing about their wade home
through the snow. Hughie, the baby, fell to work so fiercely that
beads of sweat came out all over his flushed forehead. Mrs. Rosen
could not help admiring him and his mother. They were so comfortable
and complete. When he was changed to the other side, Hughie resented
the interruption a little; but after a time he became soft and bland,
as smooth as oil, indeed; began looking about him as he drew in his
milk. He finally dropped the nipple from his lips altogether, turned
on his mother's arm, and looked inquiringly at Mrs. Rosen.</p>

<p>"What a beautiful baby!" she exclaimed from her heart. And he was.
A sort of golden baby. His hair was like sunshine, and his long
lashes were gold over such gay blue eyes. There seemed to be a gold
glow in his soft pink skin, and he had the smile of a cherub.</p>

<p>"We think he's a pretty boy," said Mrs. Templeton. "He's the
prettiest of my babies. Though the twins were mighty cunning little
fellows. I hated the idea of twins, but the minute I saw them, I
couldn't resist them."</p>

<p>Just then old Mrs. Harris came in, walking widely in her
full-gathered skirt and felt-soled shoes, bearing a tray with two
smoking goblets upon it.</p>

<p>"This is my mother, Mrs. Harris, Mrs. Rosen," said Mrs.
Templeton.</p>

<p>"I'm glad to know you, ma'am," said Mrs. Harris. "Victoria, let me
take the baby, while you two ladies have your toddy."</p>

<p>"Oh, don't take him away, Mrs. Harris, please!" cried Mrs.
Rosen.</p>

<p>The old lady smiled. "I won't. I'll set right here. He never frets
with his grandma."</p>

<p>When Mrs. Rosen had finished her excellent drink, she asked if she
might hold the baby, and Mrs. Harris placed him on her lap. He made a
few rapid boxing motions with his two fists, then braced himself on
his heels and the back of his head, and lifted himself up in an arc.
When he dropped back, he looked up at Mrs. Rosen with his most
intimate smile. "See what a smart boy I am!"</p>

<p>When Mrs. Rosen walked home, feeling her way through the snow by
following the fence, she knew she could never stay away from a house
where there was a baby like that one.</p>

<p>Vickie did her studying in a hammock hung between two tall
cottonwood trees over in the Headmaster's green yard. The Headmaster
had the finest yard in Skyline, on the edge of the town, just where
the sandy plain and the sage-brush began. His family went back to
Ohio every summer, and Bert and Del Templeton were paid to take care
of his lawn, to turn the sprinkler on at the right hours and to cut
the grass. They were really too little to run the heavy lawn-mower
very well, but they were able to manage because they were twins. Each
took one end of the handle-bar, and they pushed together like a pair
of fat Shetland ponies. They were very proud of being able to keep
the lawn so nice, and worked hard on it. They cut Mrs. Rosen's grass
once a week, too, and did it so well that she wondered why in the
world they never did anything about their own yard. They didn't have
city water, to be sure (it was expensive), but she thought they might
pick up a few velocipedes and iron hoops, and dig up the messy
"flower-bed," that was even uglier than the naked gravel spots. She
was particularly offended by a deep ragged ditch, a miniature arroyo,
which ran across the back yard, serving no purpose and looking very
dreary.</p>

<p>One morning she said craftily to the twins, when she was paying
them for cutting her grass:</p>

<p>"And, boys, why don't you just shovel the sand-pile by your fence
into dat ditch, and make your back yard smooth?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no, ma'am," said Adelbert with feeling. "We like to have the
ditch to build bridges over!"</p>

<p>Ever since vacation began, the twins had been busy getting the
Headmaster's yard ready for the Methodist lawn party. When Mrs.
Holliday, the Headmaster's wife, went away for the summer, she always
left a key with the Ladies' Aid Society and invited them to give
their ice-cream social at her place.</p>

<p>This year the date set for the party was June fifteenth. The day
was a particularly fine one, and as Mr. Holliday himself had been
called to Cheyenne on railroad business, the twins felt personally
responsible for everything. They got out to the Holliday place early
in the morning, and stayed on guard all day. Before noon the drayman
brought a wagon-load of card-tables and folding chairs, which the
boys placed in chosen spots under the cottonwood trees. In the
afternoon the Methodist ladies arrived and opened up the kitchen to
receive the freezers of home-made ice-cream, and the cakes which the
congregation donated. Indeed, all the good cake-bakers in town were
expected to send a cake. Grandma Harris baked a white cake, thickly
iced and covered with freshly grated coconut, and Vickie took it over
in the afternoon.</p>

<p>Mr. and Mrs. Rosen, because they belonged to no church,
contributed to the support of all, and usually went to the church
suppers in winter and the socials in summer. On this warm June
evening they set out early, in order to take a walk first. They
strolled along the hard gravelled road that led out through the sage
toward the sand-hills; tonight it led toward the moon, just rising
over the sweep of dunes. The sky was almost as blue as at midday, and
had that look of being very near and very soft which it has in desert
countries. The moon, too, looked very near, soft and bland and
innocent. Mrs. Rosen admitted that in the Adirondacks, for which she
was always secretly homesick in summer, the moon had a much colder
brilliance, seemed farther off and made of a harder metal. This moon
gave the sage-brush plain and the drifted sand-hills the softness of
velvet. All countries were beautiful to Mr. Rosen. He carried a
country of his own in his mind, and was able to unfold it like a tent
in any wilderness.</p>

<p>When they at last turned back toward the town, they saw groups of
people, women in white dresses, walking toward the dark spot where
the paper lanterns made a yellow light underneath the cottonwoods.
High above, the rustling tree-tops stirred free in the flood of
moonlight.</p>

<p>The lighted yard was surrounded by a low board fence, painted the
dark red Burlington colour, and as the Rosens drew near, they noticed
four children standing close together in the shadow of some tall
elder bushes just outside the fence. They were the poor Maude
children; their mother was the washwoman, the Rosens' laundress and
the Templetons'. People said that every one of those children had a
different father. But good laundresses were few, and even the members
of the Ladies' Aid were glad to get Mrs. Maude's services at a dollar
a day, though they didn't like their children to play with hers. Just
as the Rosens approached, Mrs. Templeton came out from the lighted
square, leaned over the fence, and addressed the little Maudes.</p>

<p>"I expect you children forgot your dimes, now didn't you? Never
mind, here's a dime for each of you, so come along and have your
ice-cream."</p>

<p>The Maudes put out small hands and said: "Thank you," but not one
of them moved.</p>

<p>"Come along, Francie" (the oldest girl was named Frances). "Climb
right over the fence." Mrs. Templeton reached over and gave her a
hand, and the little boys quickly scrambled after their sister. Mrs.
Templeton took them to a table which Vickie and the twins had just
selected as being especially private--they liked to do things
together.</p>

<p>"Here, Vickie, let the Maudes sit at your table, and take care
they get plenty of cake."</p>

<p>The Rosens had followed close behind Mrs. Templeton, and Mr. Rosen
now overtook her and said in his most courteous and friendly manner:
"Good evening, Mrs. Templeton. Will you have ice-cream with us?" He
always used the local idioms, though his voice and enunciation made
them sound altogether different from Skyline speech.</p>

<p>"Indeed I will, Mr. Rosen. Mr. Templeton will be late. He went out
to his farm yesterday, and I don't know just when to expect him."</p>

<p>Vickie and the twins were disappointed at not having their table
to themselves, when they had come early and found a nice one; but
they knew it was right to look out for the dreary little Maudes, so
they moved close together and made room for them. The Maudes didn't
cramp them long. When the three boys had eaten the last crumb of cake
and licked their spoons, Francie got up and led them to a green slope
by the fence, just outside the lighted circle. "Now set down, and
watch and see how folks do," she told them. The boys looked to
Francie for commands and support. She was really Amos Maude's child,
born before he ran away to the Klondike, and it had been rubbed into
them that this made a difference. The Templeton children made their
ice-cream linger out, and sat watching the crowd. They were glad to
see their mother go to Mr. Rosen's table, and noticed how nicely he
placed a chair for her and insisted upon putting a scarf about her
shoulders. Their mother was wearing her new dotted Swiss, with many
ruffles, all edged with black ribbon, and wide ruffly sleeves. As the
twins watched her over their spoons, they thought how much prettier
their mother was than any of the other women, and how becoming her
new dress was. The children got as much satisfaction as Mrs. Harris
out of Victoria's good looks.</p>

<p>Mr. Rosen was well pleased with Mrs. Templeton and her new dress,
and with her kindness to the little Maudes. He thought her manner
with them just right,--warm, spontaneous, without anything
patronizing. He always admired her way with her own children, though
Mrs. Rosen thought it too casual. Being a good mother, he believed,
was much more a matter of physical poise and richness than of
sentimentalizing and reading doctor-books. Tonight he was more
talkative than usual, and in his quiet way made Mrs. Templeton feel
his real friendliness and admiration. Unfortunately, he made other
people feel it, too.</p>

<p>Mrs. Jackson, a neighbour who didn't like the Templetons, had been
keeping an eye on Mr. Rosen's table. She was a stout square woman of
imperturbable calm, effective in regulating the affairs of the
community because she never lost her temper, and could say the most
cutting things in calm, even kindly, tones. Her face was smooth and
placid as a mask, rather good-humoured, and the fact that one eye had
a cast and looked askance made it the more difficult to see through
her intentions. When she had been lingering about the Rosens' table
for some time, studying Mr. Rosen's pleasant attentions to Mrs.
Templeton, she brought up a trayful of cake.</p>

<p>"You folks are about ready for another helping," she remarked
affably.</p>

<p>Mrs. Rosen spoke. "I want some of Grandma Harris's cake. It's a
white coconut, Mrs. Jackson."</p>

<p>"How about you, Mrs. Templeton, would you like some of your own
cake?"</p>

<p>"Indeed I would," said Mrs. Templeton heartily. "Ma said she had
good luck with it. I didn't see it. Vickie brought it over."</p>

<p>Mrs. Jackson deliberately separated the slices on her tray with
two forks. "Well," she remarked with a chuckle that really sounded
amiable, "I don't know but I'd like my cakes, if I kept somebody in
the kitchen to bake them for me."</p>

<p>Mr. Rosen for once spoke quickly. "If I had a cook like Grandma
Harris in my kitchen, I'd live in it!" he declared.</p>

<p>Mrs. Jackson smiled. "I don't know as we feel like that, Mrs.
Templeton? I tell Mr. Jackson that my idea of coming up in the world
would be to forget I had a cook-stove, like Mrs. Templeton. But we
can't all be lucky."</p>

<p>Mr. Rosen could not tell how much was malice and how much was
stupidity. What he chiefly detected was self-satisfaction; the
craftiness of the coarse-fibred country girl putting catch questions
to the teacher. Yes, he decided, the woman was merely showing
off,--she regarded it as an accomplishment to make people
uncomfortable.</p>

<p>Mrs. Templeton didn't at once take it in. Her training was all to
the end that you must give a guest everything you have, even if he
happens to be your worst enemy, and that to cause anyone
embarrassment is a frightful and humiliating blunder. She felt hurt
without knowing just why, but all evening it kept growing clearer to
her that this was another of those thrusts from the outside which she
couldn't understand. The neighbours were sure to take sides against
her, apparently, if they came often to see her mother.</p>

<p>Mr. Rosen tried to distract Mrs. Templeton, but he could feel the
poison working. On the way home the children knew something had
displeased or hurt their mother. When they went into the house, she
told them to go up-stairs at once, as she had a headache. She was
severe and distant. When Mrs. Harris suggested making her some
peppermint tea, Victoria threw up her chin.</p>

<p>"I don't want anybody waiting on me. I just want to be let alone."
And she withdrew without saying good-night, or "Are you all right,
Ma?" as she usually did.</p>

<p>Left alone, Mrs. Harris sighed and began to turn down her bed. She
knew, as well as if she had been at the social, what kind of thing
had happened. Some of those prying ladies of the Woman's Relief
Corps, or the Woman's Christian Temperance Union, had been intimating
to Victoria that her mother was "put upon." Nothing ever made
Victoria cross but criticism. She was jealous of small attentions
paid to Mrs. Harris, because she felt they were paid "behind her
back" or "over her head," in a way that implied reproach to her.
Victoria had been a belle in their own town in Tennessee, but here
she was not very popular, no matter how many pretty dresses she wore,
and she couldn't bear it. She felt as if her mother and Mr. Templeton
must be somehow to blame; at least they ought to protect her from
whatever was disagreeable--they always had!</p>

<p> </p>

<h2>V</h2>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>Mrs. Harris wakened at about four o'clock, as usual, before the
house was stirring, and lay thinking about their position in this new
town. She didn't know why the neighbours acted so; she was as much in
the dark as Victoria. At home, back in Tennessee, her place in the
family was not exceptional, but perfectly regular. Mrs. Harris had
replied to Mrs. Rosen, when that lady asked why in the world she
didn't break Vickie in to help her in the kitchen: "We are only young
once, and trouble comes soon enough." Young girls, in the South, were
supposed to be carefree and foolish; the fault Grandmother found in
Vickie was that she wasn't foolish enough. When the foolish girl
married and began to have children, everything else must give way to
that. She must be humoured and given the best of everything, because
having children was hard on a woman, and it was the most important
thing in the world. In Tennessee every young married woman in good
circumstances had an older woman in the house, a mother or
mother-in-law or an old aunt, who managed the household economies and
directed the help.</p>

<p>That was the great difference; in Tennessee there had been plenty
of helpers. There was old Miss Sadie Crummer, who came to the house
to spin and sew and mend; old Mrs. Smith, who always arrived to help
at butchering- and preserving-time; Lizzie, the coloured girl, who
did the washing and who ran in every day to help Mandy. There were
plenty more, who came whenever one of Lizzie's barefoot boys ran to
fetch them. The hills were full of solitary old women, or women but
slightly attached to some household, who were glad to come to Miz'
Harris's for good food and a warm bed, and the little present that
either Mrs. Harris or Victoria slipped into their carpet-sack when
they went away.</p>

<p>To be sure, Mrs. Harris, and the other women of her age who
managed their daughter's house, kept in the background; but it was
their own background, and they ruled it jealously. They left the
front porch and the parlour to the young married couple and their
young friends; the old women spent most of their lives in the kitchen
and pantries and back dining-room. But there they ordered life to
their own taste, entertained their friends, dispensed charity, and
heard the troubles of the poor. Moreover, back there it was
Grandmother's own house they lived in. Mr. Templeton came of a
superior family and had what Grandmother called "blood," but no
property. He never so much as mended one of the steps to the front
porch without consulting Mrs. Harris. Even "back home," in the
aristocracy, there were old women who went on living like young
ones,--gave parties and drove out in their carriage and "went North"
in the summer. But among the middle-class people and the
country-folk, when a woman was a widow and had married daughters, she
considered herself an old woman and wore full-gathered black dresses
and a black bonnet and became a housekeeper. She accepted this estate
unprotestingly, almost gratefully.</p>

<p>The Templetons' troubles began when Mr. Templeton's aunt died and
left him a few thousand dollars, and he got the idea of bettering
himself. The twins were little then, and he told Mrs. Harris his boys
would have a better chance in Colorado--everybody was going West. He
went alone first, and got a good position with a mining company in
the mountains of southern Colorado. He had been book-keeper in the
bank in his home town, had "grown up in the bank," as they said. He
was industrious and honourable, and the managers of the mining
company liked him, even if they laughed at his polite, soft-spoken
manners. He could have held his position indefinitely, and maybe got
a promotion. But the altitude of that mountain town was too high for
his family. All the children were sick there; Mrs. Templeton was ill
most of the time and nearly died when Ronald was born. Hillary
Templeton lost his courage and came north to the flat, sunny,
semi-arid country between Wray and Cheyenne, to work for an
irrigation project. So far, things had not gone well with him. The
pinch told on everyone, but most on Grandmother. Here, in Skyline,
she had all her accustomed responsibilities, and no helper but Mandy.
Mrs. Harris was no longer living in a feudal society, where there
were plenty of landless people glad to render service to the more
fortunate, but in a snappy little Western democracy, where every man
was as good as his neighbour and out to prove it.</p>

<p>Neither Mrs. Harris nor Mrs. Templeton understood just what was
the matter; they were hurt and dazed, merely. Victoria knew that here
she was censured and criticized, she who had always been so admired
and envied! Grandmother knew that these meddlesome "Northerners" said
things that made Victoria suspicious and unlike herself; made her
unwilling that Mrs. Harris should receive visitors alone, or accept
marks of attention that seemed offered in compassion for her
state.</p>

<p>These women who belonged to clubs and Relief Corps lived
differently, Mrs. Harris knew, but she herself didn't like the way
they lived. She believed that somebody ought to be in the parlour,
and somebody in the kitchen. She wouldn't for the world have had
Victoria go about every morning in a short gingham dress, with bare
arms, and a dust-cap on her head to hide the curling-kids, as these
brisk housekeepers did. To Mrs. Harris that would have meant real
poverty, coming down in the world so far that one could no longer
keep up appearances. Her life was hard now, to be sure, since the
family went on increasing and Mr. Templeton's means went on
decreasing; but she certainly valued respectability above personal
comfort, and she could go on a good way yet if they always had a cool
pleasant parlour, with Victoria properly dressed to receive visitors.
To keep Victoria different from these "ordinary" women meant
everything to Mrs. Harris. She realized that Mrs. Rosen managed to be
mistress of any situation, either in kitchen or parlour, but that was
because she was "foreign." Grandmother perfectly understood that
their neighbour had a superior cultivation which made everything she
did an exercise of skill. She knew well enough that their own ways of
cooking and cleaning were primitive beside Mrs. Rosen's.</p>

<p>If only Mr. Templeton's business affairs would look up, they could
rent a larger house, and everything would be better. They might even
get a German girl to come in and help,--but now there was no place to
put her. Grandmother's own lot could improve only with the family
fortunes--any comfort for herself, aside from that of the family, was
inconceivable to her; and on the other hand she could have no real
unhappiness while the children were well, and good, and fond of her
and their mother. That was why it was worth while to get up early in
the morning and make her bed neat and draw the red spread smooth. The
little boys loved to lie on her lounge and her pillows when they were
tired. When they were sick, Ronald and Hughie wanted to be in her
lap. They had no physical shrinking from her because she was old. And
Victoria was never jealous of the children's wanting to be with her
so much; that was a mercy!</p>

<p>Sometimes, in the morning, if her feet ached more than usual, Mrs.
Harris felt a little low. (Nobody did anything about broken arches in
those days, and the common endurance test of old age was to keep
going after every step cost something.) She would hang up her towel
with a sigh and go into the kitchen, feeling that it was hard to make
a start. But the moment she heard the children running down the
uncarpeted back stairs, she forgot to be low. Indeed, she ceased to
be an individual, an old woman with aching feet; she became part of a
group, became a relationship. She was drunk up into their freshness
when they burst in upon her, telling her about their dreams,
explaining their troubles with buttons and shoe-laces and underwear
shrunk too small. The tired, solitary old woman Grandmother had been
at daybreak vanished; suddenly the morning seemed as important to her
as it did to the children, and the mornings ahead stretched out
sunshiny, important.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>The day after the Methodist social, Blue Boy didn't come for his
morning milk; he always had it in a clean saucer on the covered back
porch, under the long bench where the tin wash-tubs stood ready for
Mrs. Maude. After the children had finished breakfast, Mrs. Harris
sent Mandy out to look for the cat.</p>

<p>The girl came back in a minute, her eyes big.</p>

<p>"Law me, Miz' Harris, he's awful sick. He's a-layin' in the straw
in the barn. He's swallered a bone, or havin' a fit or
somethin'."</p>

<p>Grandmother threw an apron over her head and went out to see for
herself. The children went with her. Blue Boy was retching and
choking, and his yellow eyes were filled up with rhume.</p>

<p>"Oh, Gram'ma, what's the matter?" the boys cried.</p>

<p>"It's the distemper. How could he have got it?" Her voice was so
harsh that Ronald began to cry. "Take Ronald back to the house, Del.
He might get bit. I wish I'd kept my word and never had a cat
again!"</p>

<p>"Why, Gram'ma!" Albert looked at her. "Won't Blue Boy get
well?"</p>

<p>''Not from the distemper, he won't."</p>

<p>"But Gram'ma, can't I run for the veter'nary?"</p>

<p>"You gether up an armful of hay. We'll take him into the
coal-house, where I can watch him."</p>

<p>Mrs. Harris waited until the spasm was over, then picked up the
limp cat and carried him to the coal-shed that opened off the back
porch. Albert piled the hay in one corner--the coal was low, since it
was summer--and they spread a piece of old carpet on the hay and made
a bed for Blue Boy. "Now you run along with Adelbert. There'll be a
lot of work to do on Mr. Holliday's yard, cleaning up after the
sociable. Mandy an' me'll watch Blue Boy. I expect he'll sleep for a
while."</p>

<p>Albert went away regretfully, but the drayman and some of the
Methodist ladies were in Mr. Holliday's yard, packing chairs and
tables and ice-cream freezers into the wagon, and the twins forgot
the sick cat in their excitement. By noon they had picked up the last
paper napkin, raked over the gravel walks where the salt from the
freezers had left white patches, and hung the hammock in which Vickie
did her studying back in its place. Mr. Holliday paid the boys a
dollar a week for keeping up the yard, and they gave the money to
their mother--it didn't come amiss in a family where actual cash was
so short. She let them keep half the sum Mrs. Rosen paid for her milk
every Saturday, and that was more spending money than most boys had.
They often made a few extra quarters by cutting grass for other
people, or by distributing handbills. Even the disagreeable Mrs.
Jackson next door had remarked over the fence to Mrs. Harris: "I do
believe Bert and Del are going to be industrious. They must have got
it from you, Grandma."</p>

<p>The day came on very hot, and when the twins got back from the
Roadmaster's yard, they both lay down on Grandmother's lounge and
went to sleep. After dinner they had a rare opportunity; the
Roadmaster himself appeared at the front door and invited them to go
up to the next town with him on his railroad velocipede. That was
great fun: the velocipede always whizzed along so fast on the bright
rails, the gasoline engine puffing; and grasshoppers jumped up out of
the sagebrush and hit you in the face like sling-shot bullets.
Sometimes the wheels cut in two a lazy snake who was sunning himself
on the track, and the twins always hoped it was a rattler and felt
they had done a good work.</p>

<p>The boys got back from their trip with Mr. Holliday late in the
afternoon. The house was cool and quiet. Their mother had taken
Ronald and Hughie down town with her, and Vickie was off somewhere.
Grandmother was not in her room, and the kitchen was empty. The boys
went out to the back porch to pump a drink. The coal-shed door was
open, and inside, on a low stool, sat Mrs. Harris beside her cat.
Bert and Del didn't stop to get a drink; they felt ashamed that they
had gone off for a gay ride and forgotten Blue Boy. They sat down on
a big lump of coal beside Mrs. Harris. They would never have known
that this miserable rumpled animal was their proud tom. Presently he
went off into a spasm and began to froth at the mouth.</p>

<p>"Oh, Gram'ma, can't you do anything?" cried Albert, struggling
with his tears. "Blue Boy was such a good cat,--why has he got to
suffer?"</p>

<p>"Everything that's alive has got to suffer," said Mrs. Harris.
Albert put out his hand and caught her skirt, looking up at her
beseechingly, as if to make her unsay that saying, which he only half
understood. She patted his hand. She had forgot she was speaking to a
little boy.</p>

<p>"Where's Vickie?" Adelbert asked aggrievedly. "Why don't she do
something? He's part her cat."</p>

<p>Mrs. Harris sighed. "Vickie's got her head full of things lately;
that makes people kind of heartless."</p>

<p>The boys resolved they would never put anything into their heads,
then!</p>

<p>Blue Boy's fit passed, and the three sat watching their pet that
no longer knew them. The twins had not seen much suffering;
Grandmother had seen a great deal. Back in Tennessee, in her own
neighbourhood, she was accounted a famous nurse. When any of the poor
mountain people were in great distress, they always sent for Miz'
Harris. Many a time she had gone into a house where five or six
children were all down with scarlet fever or diphtheria, and done
what she could. Many a child and many a woman she had laid out and
got ready for the grave. In her primitive community the undertaker
made the coffin,--he did nothing more. She had seen so much misery
that she wondered herself why it hurt so to see her tom-cat die. She
had taken her leave of him, and she got up from her stool. She didn't
want the boys to be too much distressed.</p>

<p>"Now you boys must wash and put on clean shirts. Your mother will
be home pretty soon. We'll leave Blue Boy; he'll likely be easier in
the morning." She knew the cat would die at sundown.</p>

<p>After supper, when Bert looked into the coal-shed and found the
cat dead, all the family were sad. Ronald cried miserably, and Hughie
cried because Ronald did. Mrs. Templeton herself went out and looked
into the shed, and she was sorry, too. Though she didn't like cats,
she had been fond of this one.</p>

<p>"Hillary," she hold her husband, "when you go down town tonight,
tell the Mexican to come and get that cat early in the morning,
before the children are up."</p>

<p>The Mexican had a cart and two mules, and he hauled away tin cans
and refuse to a gully out in the sage-brush.</p>

<p>Mrs. Harris gave Victoria an indignant glance when she heard this,
and turned back to the kitchen. All evening she was gloomy and
silent. She refused to read aloud, and the twins took Ronald and went
mournfully out to play under the electric light. Later, when they had
said good-night to their parents in the parlour and were on their way
upstairs, Mrs. Harris followed them into the kitchen, shut the door
behind her, and said indignantly:</p>

<p>"Air you two boys going to let that Mexican take Blue Boy and
throw him onto some trash-pile?"</p>

<p>The sleepy boys were frightened at the anger and bitterness in her
tone. They stood still and looked up at her, while she went on:</p>

<p>"You git up early in the morning, and I'll put him in a sack, and
one of you take a spade and go to that crooked old willer tree that
grows just where the sand creek turns off the road, and you dig a
little grave for Blue Boy, an' bury him right."</p>

<p>They had seldom seen such resentment in their grandmother.
Albert's throat choked up, he rubbed the tears away with his
fist.</p>

<p>"Yes'm, Gram'ma, we will, we will," he gulped.</p>

<p> </p>

<center>
<h2>VII</h2>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>Only Mrs. Harris saw the boys go out next morning. She slipped a
bread-and-butter sandwich into the hand of each, but she said
nothing, and they said nothing.</p>

<p>The boys did not get home until their parents were ready to leave
the table. Mrs. Templeton made no fuss, but told them to sit down and
eat their breakfast. When they had finished, she said
commandingly:</p>

<p>"Now you march into my room." That was where she heard
explanations and administered punishment. When she whipped them, she
did it thoroughly.</p>

<p>She followed them and shut the door.</p>

<p>"Now, what were you boys doing this morning?"</p>

<p>"We went off to bury Blue Boy."</p>

<p>"Why didn't you tell me you were going?"</p>

<p>They looked down at their toes, but said nothing. Their mother
studied their mournful faces, and her overbearing expression
softened.</p>

<p>"The next time you get up and go off anywhere, you come and tell
me beforehand, do you understand?"</p>

<p>"Yes'm."</p>

<p>She opened the door, motioned them out, and went with them into
the parlour. "I'm sorry about your cat, boys," she said. "That's why
I don't like to have cats around; they're always getting sick and
dying. Now run along and play. Maybe you'd like to have a circus in
the back yard this afternoon? And we'll all come."</p>

<p>The twins ran out in a joyful frame of mind. Their grandmother had
been mistaken; their mother wasn't indifferent about Blue Boy, she
was sorry. Now everything was all right, and they could make a circus
ring.</p>

<p>They knew their grandmother got put out about strange things,
anyhow. A few months ago it was because their mother hadn't asked one
of the visiting preachers who came to the church conference to stay
with them. There was no place for the preacher to sleep except on the
folding lounge in the parlour, and no place for him to wash--he would
have been very uncomfortable, and so would all the household. But
Mrs. Harris was terribly upset that there should be a conference in
the town, and they not keeping a preacher! She was quite bitter about
it.</p>

<p>The twins called in the neighbour boys, and they made a ring in
the back yard, around their turning-bar. Their mother came to the
show and paid admission, bringing Mrs. Rosen and Grandma Harris. Mrs.
Rosen thought if all the children in the neighbourhood were to be
howling and running in a circle in the Templetons' back yard, she
might as well be there, too, for she would have no peace at home.</p>

<p>After the dog races and the Indian fight were over, Mrs. Templeton
took Mrs. Rosen into the house to revive her with cake and lemonade.
The parlour was cool and dusky. Mrs. Rosen was glad to get into it
after sitting on a wooden bench in the sun. Grandmother stayed in the
parlour with them, which was unusual. Mrs. Rosen sat waving a
palm-leaf fan,--she felt the heat very much, because she wore her
stays so tight--while Victoria went to make the lemonade.</p>

<p>"De circuses are not so good, widout Vickie to manage them,
Grandma," she said.</p>

<p>"No'm. The boys complain right smart about losing Vickie from
their plays. She's at her books all the time now. I don't know what's
got into the child."</p>

<p>"If she wants to go to college, she must prepare herself, Grandma.
I am agreeably surprised in her. I didn't think she'd stick to
it."</p>

<p>Mrs. Templeton came in with a tray of tumblers and the glass
pitcher all frosted over. Mrs. Rosen wistfully admired her
neighbour's tall figure and good carriage; she was wearing no corsets
at all today under her flowered organdie afternoon dress, Mrs. Rosen
had noticed, and yet she could carry herself so smooth and
straight,--after having had so many children, too! Mrs. Rosen was
envious, but she gave credit where credit was due.</p>

<p>When Mrs. Templeton brought in the cake, Mrs. Rosen was still
talking to Grandmother about Vickie's studying. Mrs. Templeton
shrugged carelessly.</p>

<p>"There's such a thing as overdoing it, Mrs. Rosen," she observed
as she poured the lemonade. "Vickie's very apt to run to
extremes."</p>

<p>"But, my dear lady, she can hardly be too extreme in dis matter.
If she is to take a competitive examination with girls from much
better schools than ours, she will have to do better than the others,
or fail; no two ways about it. We must encourage her."</p>

<p>Mrs. Templeton bridled a little. "I'm sure I don't interfere with
her studying, Mrs. Rosen. I don't see where she got this notion, but
I let her alone."</p>

<p>Mrs. Rosen accepted a second piece of chocolate cake. "And what do
you think about it, Grandma?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Harris smiled politely. "None of our people, or Mr.
Templeton's either, ever went to college. I expect it is all on
account of the young gentleman who was here last summer."</p>

<p>Mrs. Rosen laughed and lifted her eyebrows. "Something very
personal in Vickie's admiration for Professor Chalmers we think,
Grandma? A very sudden interest in de sciences, I should say!"</p>

<p>Mrs. Templeton shrugged. "You're mistaken, Mrs. Rosen. There ain't
a particle of romance in Vickie."</p>

<p>"But there are several kinds of romance, Mrs. Templeton. She may
not have your kind."</p>

<p>"Yes'm, that's so," said Mrs. Harris in a low, grateful voice. She
thought that a hard word Victoria had said of Vickie.</p>

<p>"I didn't see a thing in that Professor Chalmers, myself,"
Victoria remarked. "He was a gawky kind of fellow, and never had a
thing to say in company. Did you think he amounted to much?"</p>

<p>"Oh, widout doubt Doctor Chalmers is a very scholarly man. A great
many brilliant scholars are widout de social graces, you know." When
Mrs. Rosen, from a much wider experience, corrected her neighbour,
she did so somewhat playfully, as if insisting upon something
Victoria capriciously chose to ignore.</p>

<p>At this point old Mrs. Harris put her hands on the arms of the
chair in preparation to rise. "If you ladies will excuse me, I think
I will go and lie down a little before supper." She rose and went
heavily out on her felt soles. She never really lay down in the
afternoon, but she dozed in her own black rocker. Mrs. Rosen and
Victoria sat chatting about Professor Chalmers and his boys.</p>

<p>Last summer the young professor had come to Skyline with four of
his students from the University of Michigan, and had stayed three
months, digging for fossils out in the sandhills. Vickie had spent a
great many mornings at their camp. They lived at the town hotel, and
drove out to their camp every day in a light spring-wagon. Vickie
used to wait for them at the edge of the town, in front of the
Roadmaster's house, and when the spring-wagon came rattling along,
the boys would call: "There's our girl!" slow the horses, and give
her a hand up. They said she was their mascot, and were very jolly
with her. They had a splendid summer,--found a great bed of fossil
elephant bones, where a whole herd must once have perished. Later on
they came upon the bones of a new kind of elephant, scarcely larger
than a pig. They were greatly excited about their finds, and so was
Vickie. That was why they liked her. It was they who told her about a
memorial scholarship at Ann Arbor, which was open to any girl from
Colorado.</p>

<p> </p>

<center>
<h2>VIII</h2>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>In August Vickie went down to Denver to take her examinations. Mr.
Holliday, the Roadmaster, got her a pass, and arranged that she
should stay with the family of one of his passenger conductors.</p>

<p>For three days she wrote examination papers along with other
contestants, in one of the Denver high schools, proctored by a
teacher. Her father had given her five dollars for incidental
expenses, and she came home with a box of mineral specimens for the
twins, a singing top for Ronald, and a toy burro for Hughie.</p>

<p>Then began days of suspense that stretched into weeks. Vickie went
to the post-office every morning, opened her father's combination
box, and looked over the letters, long before he got down
town,--always hoping there might be a letter from Ann Arbor. The
night mail came in at six, and after supper she hurried to the
post-office and waited about until the shutter at the
general-delivery window was drawn back, a signal that the mail had
all been "distributed." While the tedious process of distribution was
going on, she usually withdrew from the office, full of joking men
and cigar smoke, and walked up and down under the big cottonwood
trees that overhung the side street. When the crowd of men began to
come out, then she knew the mail-bags were empty, and she went in to
get whatever letters were in the Templeton box and take them
home.</p>

<p>After two weeks went by, she grew downhearted. Her young
professor, she knew, was in England for his vacation. There would be
no one at the University of Michigan who was interested in her fate.
Perhaps the fortunate contestant had already been notified of her
success. She never asked herself, as she walked up and down under the
cottonwoods on those summer nights, what she would do if she didn't
get the scholarship. There was no alternative. If she didn't get it,
then everything was over.</p>

<p>During the weeks when she lived only to go to the post-office, she
managed to cut her finger and get ink into the cut. As a result, she
had a badly infected hand and had to carry it in a sling. When she
walked her nightly beat under the cottonwoods, it was a kind of
comfort to feel that finger throb; it was companionship, made her
case more complete.</p>

<p>The strange thing was that one morning a letter came, addressed to
Miss Victoria Templeton; in a long envelope such as her father called
"legal size," with <i>"University of Michigan"</i> in the upper
left-hand corner. When Vickie took it from the box, such a wave of
fright and weakness went through her that she could scarcely get out
of the post-office. She hid the letter under her striped blazer and
went a weak, uncertain trail down the sidewalk under the big trees.
Without seeing anything or knowing what road she took, she got to the
Headmaster's green yard and her hammock, where she always felt not on
the earth, yet of it.</p>

<p>Three hours later, when Mrs. Rosen was just tasting one of those
clear soups upon which the Templetons thought she wasted so much
pains and good meat, Vickie walked in at the kitchen door and said in
a low but somewhat unnatural voice:</p>

<p>"Mrs. Rosen, I got the scholarship."</p>

<p>Mrs. Rosen looked up at her sharply, then pushed the soup back to
a cooler part of the stove.</p>

<p>"What is dis you say, Vickie? You have heard from de
University?"</p>

<p>"Yes'm. I got the letter this morning." She produced it from under
her blazer.</p>

<p>Mrs. Rosen had been cutting noodles. She took Vickie's face in two
hot, plump hands that were still floury, and looked at her intently.
"Is dat true, Vickie? No mistake? I am delighted--and surprised! Yes,
surprised. Den you will <i>be</i> something, you won't just sit on de
front porch." She squeezed the girl's round, good-natured cheeks, as
if she could mould them into something definite then and there. "Now
you must stay for lunch and tell us all about it. Go in and announce
yourself to Mr. Rosen."</p>

<p>Mr. Rosen had come home for lunch and was sitting, a book in his
hand, in a corner of the darkened front parlour where a flood of
yellow sun streamed in under the dark green blind. He smiled his
friendly smile at Vickie and waved her to a seat, making her
understand that he wanted to finish his paragraph. The dark engraving
of the pointed cypresses and the Roman tomb was on the wall just
behind him.</p>

<p>Mrs. Rosen came into the back parlour, which was the dining-room,
and began taking things out of the silver-drawer to lay a place for
their visitor. She spoke to her husband rapidly in German.</p>

<p>He put down his book, came over, and took Vickie's hand.</p>

<p>"Is it true, Vickie? Did you really win the scholarship?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>He stood looking down at her through his kind, remote smile,--a
smile in the eyes, that seemed to come up through layers and layers
of something--gentle doubts, kindly reservations.</p>

<p>"Why do you want to go to college, Vickie?" he asked
playfully.</p>

<p>"To learn," she said with surprise.</p>

<p>"But why do you want to learn? What do you want to do with
it?"</p>

<p>"I don't know. Nothing, I guess."</p>

<p>"Then what do you want it for?"</p>

<p>"I don't know. I just want it."</p>

<p>For some reason Vickie's voice broke there. She had been terribly
strung up all morning, lying in the hammock with her eyes tight shut.
She had not been home at all, she had wanted to take her letter to
the Rosens first. And now one of the gentlest men she knew made her
choke by something strange and presageful in his voice.</p>

<p>"Then if you want it without any purpose at all, you will not be
disappointed." Mr. Rosen wished to distract her and help her to keep
back the tears. "Listen: a great man once said: <i>'Le but n'est
rien; le chemin, c'est tout.'</i> That means: The end is nothing, the
road is all. Let me write it down for you and give you your first
French lesson."</p>

<p>He went to the desk with its big silver inkwell, where he and his
wife wrote so many letters in several languages, and inscribed the
sentence on a sheet of purple paper, in his delicately shaded foreign
script, signing under it a name: <i>J. Michelet.</i> He brought it
back and shook it before Vickie's eyes. "There, keep it to remember
me by. Slip it into the envelope with your college credentials,--that
is a good place for it." From his deliberate smile and the twitch of
one eyebrow, Vickie knew he meant her to take it along as an
antidote, a corrective for whatever colleges might do to her. But she
had always known that Mr. Rosen was wiser than professors.</p>

<p>Mrs. Rosen was frowning, she thought that sentence a bad precept
to give any Templeton. Moreover, she always promptly called her
husband back to earth when he soared a little; though it was exactly
for this transcendental quality of mind that she reverenced him in
her heart, and thought him so much finer than any of his successful
brothers.</p>

<p>"Luncheon is served," she said in the crisp tone that put people
in their places. "And Miss Vickie, you are to eat your tomatoes with
an oil dressing, as we do. If you are going off into the world, it is
quite time you learn to like things that are everywhere
accepted."</p>

<p>Vickie said: "Yes'm," and slipped into the chair Mr. Rosen had
placed for her. Today she didn't care what she ate, though ordinarily
she thought a French dressing tasted a good deal like castor oil.</p>

<p> </p>

<center>
<h2>IX</h2>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>Vickie was to discover that nothing comes easily in this world.
Next day she got a letter from one of the jolly students of Professor
Chalmers's party, who was watching over her case in his chief's
absence. He told her the scholarship meant admission to the freshman
class without further examinations, and two hundred dollars toward
her expenses; she would have to bring along about three hundred more
to put her through the year.</p>

<p>She took this letter to her father's office. Seated in his
revolving desk-chair, Mr. Templeton read it over several times and
looked embarrassed.</p>

<p>"I'm sorry, daughter," he said at last, "but really, just now, I
couldn't spare that much. Not this year. I expect next year will be
better for us."</p>

<p>"But the scholarship is for this year, Father. It wouldn't count
next year. I just have to go in September."</p>

<p>"I really ain't got it, daughter." He spoke, oh so kindly! He had
lovely manners with his daughter and his wife. "It's just all I can
do to keep the store bills paid up. I'm away behind with Mr. Rosen's
bill. Couldn't you study here this winter and get along about as
fast? It isn't that I wouldn't like to let you have the money if I
had it. And with young children, I can't let my life insurance
go."</p>

<p>Vickie didn't say anything more. She took her letter and wandered
down Main Street with it, leaving young Mr. Templeton to a very bad
half-hour.</p>

<p>At dinner Vickie was silent, but everyone could see she had been
crying. Mr. Templeton told <i>Uncle Remus</i> stories to keep up the
family morale and make the giggly twins laugh. Mrs. Templeton glanced
covertly at her daughter from time to time. She was sometimes a
little afraid of Vickie, who seemed to her to have a hard streak. If
it were a love-affair that the girl was crying about, that would be
so much more natural--and more hopeful!</p>

<p>At two o'clock Mrs. Templeton went to the Afternoon Euchre Club,
the twins were to have another ride with the Roadmaster on his
velocipede, the little boys took their nap on their mother's bed. The
house was empty and quiet. Vickie felt an aversion for the hammock
under the cottonwoods where she had been betrayed into such bright
hopes. She lay down on her grandmother's lounge in the cluttered
play-room and turned her face to the wall.</p>

<p>When Mrs. Harris came in for her rest and began to wash her face
at the tin basin, Vickie got up. She wanted to be alone. Mrs. Harris
came over to her while she was still sitting on the edge of the
lounge.</p>

<p>"What's the matter, Vickie child?" She put her hand on her
grand-daughter's shoulder, but Vickie shrank away. Young misery is
like that, sometimes.</p>

<p>"Nothing. Except that I can't go to college after all. Papa can't
let me have the money."</p>

<p>Mrs. Harris settled herself on the faded cushions of her rocker.
"How much is it? Tell me about it, Vickie. Nobody's around."</p>

<p>Vickie told her what the conditions were, briefly and dryly, as if
she were talking to an enemy. Everyone was an enemy; all society was
against her. She told her grandmother the facts and then went
upstairs, refusing to be comforted.</p>

<p>Mrs. Harris saw her disappear through the kitchen door, and then
sat looking at the door, her face grave, her eyes stern and sad. A
poor factory-made piece of joiner's work seldom has to bear a look of
such intense, accusing sorrow; as if that flimsy pretence of
"grained" yellow pine were the door shut against all young
aspiration.</p>

<p> </p>

<center>
<h2>X</h2>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>Mrs. Harris had decided to speak to Mr. Templeton, but
opportunities for seeing him alone were not frequent. She watched out
of the kitchen window, and when she next saw him go into the barn to
fork down hay for his horse, she threw an apron over her head and
followed him. She waylaid him as he came down from the hayloft.</p>

<p>"Hillary, I want to see you about Vickie. I was wondering if you
could lay hand on any of the money you got for the sale of my house
back home."</p>

<p>Mr. Templeton was nervous. He began brushing his trousers with a
little whisk-broom he kept there, hanging on a nail.</p>

<p>"Why, no'm, Mrs. Harris. I couldn't just conveniently call in any
of it right now. You know we had to use part of it to get moved up
here from the mines."</p>

<p>"I know. But I thought if there was any left you could get at, we
could let Vickie have it. A body'd like to help the child."</p>

<p>"I'd like to, powerful well, Mrs. Harris. I would, indeedy. But
I'm afraid I can't manage it right now. The fellers I've loaned to
can't pay up this year. Maybe next year--" He was like a little boy
trying to escape a scolding, though he had never had a nagging word
from Mrs. Harris.</p>

<p>She looked downcast, but said nothing.</p>

<p>"It's all right, Mrs. Harris," he took on his brisk business tone
and hung up the brush. "The money's perfectly safe. It's well
invested."</p>

<p>Invested; that was a word men always held over women, Mrs. Harris
thought, and it always meant they could have none of their own money.
She sighed deeply.</p>

<p>"Well, if that's the way it is--" She turned away and went back to
the house on her flat heelless slippers, just in time; Victoria was
at that moment coming out to the kitchen with Hughie.</p>

<p>"Ma," she said, "can the little boy play out here, while I go down
town?"</p>

<p> </p>

<h2>XI</h2>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>For the next few days Mrs. Harris was very sombre, and she was not
well. Several times in the kitchen she was seized with what she
called giddy spells, and Mandy had to help her to a chair and give
her a little brandy.</p>

<p>"Don't you say nothin', Mandy," she warned the girl. But Mandy
knew enough for that.</p>

<p>Mrs. Harris scarcely noticed how her strength was failing, because
she had so much on her mind. She was very proud, and she wanted to do
something that was hard for her to do. The difficulty was to catch
Mrs. Rosen alone.</p>

<p>On the afternoon when Victoria went to her weekly euchre, the old
lady beckoned Mandy and told her to run across the alley and fetch
Mrs. Rosen for a minute.</p>

<p>Mrs. Rosen was packing her trunk, but she came at once.
Grandmother awaited her in her chair in the play-room.</p>

<p>"I take it very kindly of you to come, Mrs. Rosen. I'm afraid it's
warm in here. Won't you have a fan?" She extended the palm leaf she
was holding.</p>

<p>"Keep it yourself, Grandma. You are not looking very well. Do you
feel badly, Grandma Harris?" She took the old lady's hand and looked
at her anxiously.</p>

<p>"Oh, no, ma'am! I'm as well as usual. The heat wears on me a
little, maybe. Have you seen Vickie lately, Mrs. Rosen?"</p>

<p>"Vickie? No. She hasn't run in for several days. These young
people are full of their own affairs, you know."</p>

<p>"I expect she's backward about seeing you, now that she's so
discouraged."</p>

<p>"Discouraged? Why, didn't the child get her scholarship after
all?"</p>

<p>"Yes'm, she did. But they write her she has to bring more money to
help her out; three hundred dollars. Mr. Templeton can't raise it
just now. We had so much sickness in that mountain town before we
moved up here, he got behind. Pore Vickie's downhearted."</p>

<p>"Oh, that is too bad! I expect you've been fretting over it, and
that is why you don't look like yourself. Now what can we do about
it?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Harris sighed and shook her head. "Vickie's trying to muster
courage to go around to her father's friends and borrow from one and
another. But we ain't been here long,--it ain't like we had old
friends here. I hate to have the child do it."</p>

<p>Mrs. Rosen looked perplexed. "I'm sure Mr. Rosen would help her.
He takes a great interest in Vickie."</p>

<p>"I thought maybe he could see his way to. That's why I sent Mandy
to fetch you."</p>

<p>"That was right, Grandma. Now let me think." Mrs. Rosen put up her
plump red-brown hand and leaned her chin upon it. "Day after tomorrow
I am going to run on to Chicago for my niece's wedding." She saw her
old friend's face fall. "Oh, I shan't be gone long; ten days,
perhaps. I will speak to Mr. Rosen tonight, and if Vickie goes to him
after I am off his hands, I'm sure he will help her."</p>

<p>Mrs. Harris looked up at her with solemn gratitude. "Vickie ain't
the kind of girl would forget anything like that, Mrs. Rosen. Nor I
wouldn't forget it."</p>

<p>Mrs. Rosen patted her arm. "Grandma Harris," she exclaimed, "I
will just ask Mr. Rosen to do it for you! You know I care more about
the old folks than the young. If I take this worry off your mind, I
shall go away to the wedding with a light heart. Now dismiss it. I am
sure Mr. Rosen can arrange this himself for you, and Vickie won't
have to go about to these people here, and our gossipy neighbours
will never be the wiser." Mrs. Rosen poured this out in her quick,
authoritative tone, converting her <i>th's</i> into <i>d's,</i> as
she did when she was excited.</p>

<p>Mrs. Harris's red-brown eyes slowly filled with tears,--Mrs. Rosen
had never seen that happen before. But she simply said, with quiet
dignity: "Thank you, ma'am. I wouldn't have turned to nobody
else."</p>

<p>"That means I am an old friend already, doesn't it, Grandma? And
that's what I want to be. I am very jealous where Grandma Harris is
concerned!" She lightly kissed the back of the purple-veined hand she
had been holding, and ran home to her packing. Grandma sat looking
down at her hand. How easy it was for these foreigners to say what
they felt!</p>

<p> </p>

</center>

<p> </p>

<p>Mrs. Harris knew she was failing. She was glad to be able to
conceal it from Mrs. Rosen when that kind neighbour dashed in to kiss
her good-bye on the morning of her departure for Chicago. Mrs.
Templeton was, of course, present, and secrets could not be
discussed. Mrs. Rosen, in her stiff little brown travelling-hat, her
hands tightly gloved in brown kid, could only wink and nod to
Grandmother to tell her all was well. Then she went out and climbed
into the "hack" bound for the depot, which had stopped for a moment
at the Templetons' gate.</p>

<p>Mrs. Harris was thankful that her excitable friend hadn't noticed
anything unusual about her looks, and, above all, that she had made
no comment. She got through the day, and that evening, thank
goodness, Mr. Templeton took his wife to hear a company of strolling
players sing <i>The Chimes of Normandy</i> at the Opera House. He
loved music, and just now he was very eager to distract and amuse
Victoria. Grandma sent the twins out to play and went to bed
early.</p>

<p>Next morning, when she joined Mandy in the kitchen, Mandy noticed
something wrong.</p>

<p>"You set right down, Miz' Harris, an' let me git you some whisky.
Deed, ma'am, you look awful porely. You ought to tell Miss Victoria
an' let her send for the doctor."</p>

<p>"No, Mandy, I don't want no doctor. I've seen more sickness than
ever he has. Doctors can't do no more than linger you out, an' I've
always prayed I wouldn't last to be a burden. You git me some whisky
in hot water, and pour it on a piece of toast. I feel real
empty."</p>

<p>That afternoon when Mrs. Harris was taking her rest, for once she
lay down upon her lounge. Vickie came in, tense and excited, and
stopped for a moment.</p>

<p>"It's all right, Grandma. Mr. Rosen is going to lend me the money.
I won't have to go to anybody else. He won't ask Father to endorse my
note, either. He'll just take my name." Vickie rather shouted this
news at Mrs. Harris, as if the old lady were deaf, or slow of
understanding. She didn't thank her; she didn't know her grandmother
was in any way responsible for Mr. Rosen's offer, though at the close
of their interview he had said: "We won't speak of our arrangement to
anyone but your father. And I want you to mention it to the old lady
Harris. I know she has been worrying about you."</p>

<p>Having brusquely announced her news, Vickie hurried away. There
was so much to do about getting ready, she didn't know where to
begin. She had no trunk and no clothes. Her winter coat, bought two
years ago, was so outgrown that she couldn't get into it. All her
shoes were run over at the heel and must go to the cobbler. And she
had only two weeks in which to do everything! She dashed off.</p>

<p>Mrs. Harris sighed and closed her eyes happily. She thought with
modest pride that with people like the Rosens she had always "got
along nicely." It was only with the ill-bred and unclassified, like
this Mrs. Jackson next door, that she had disagreeable experiences.
Such folks, she told herself, had come out of nothing and knew no
better. She was afraid this inquisitive woman might find her ailing
and come prying round with unwelcome suggestions.</p>

<p>Mrs. Jackson did, indeed, call that very afternoon, with a
miserable contribution of veal-loaf as an excuse (all the Templetons
hated veal), but Mandy had been forewarned, and she was resourceful.
She met Mrs. Jackson at the kitchen door and blocked the way.</p>

<p>"Sh-h-h, ma'am, Miz' Harris is asleep, havin' her nap. No'm, she
ain't porely, she's as usual. But Hughie had the colic last night
when Miss Victoria was at the show, an' kep' Miz' Harris awake."</p>

<p>Mrs. Jackson was loath to turn back. She had really come to find
out why Mrs. Rosen drove away in the depot hack yesterday morning.
Except at church socials, Mrs. Jackson did not meet people in Mrs.
Rosen's set.</p>

<p>The next day, when Mrs. Harris got up and sat on the edge of her
bed, her head began to swim, and she lay down again. Mandy peeped
into the play-room as soon as she came downstairs, and found the old
lady still in bed. She leaned over her and whispered:</p>

<p>"Ain't you feelin' well, Miz' Harris?"</p>

<p>"No, Mandy, I'm right porely," Mrs. Harris admitted.</p>

<p>"You stay where you air, ma'am. I'll git the breakfast fur the
chillun, an' take the other breakfast in fur Miss Victoria an' Mr.
Templeton." She hurried back to the kitchen, and Mrs. Harris went to
sleep.</p>

<p>Immediately after breakfast Vickie dashed off about her own
concerns, and the twins went to cut grass while the dew was still on
it. When Mandy was taking the other breakfast into the dining-room,
Mrs. Templeton came through the play-room.</p>

<p>"What's the matter, Ma? Are you sick?" she asked in an accusing
tone.</p>

<p>"No, Victoria, I ain't sick. I had a little giddy spell, and I
thought I'd lay still."</p>

<p>"You ought to be more careful what you eat, Ma. If you're going to
have another bilious spell, when everything is so upset anyhow, I
don't know what I'll do!" Victoria's voice broke. She hurried back
into her bedroom, feeling bitterly that there was no place in that
house to cry in, no spot where one could be alone, even with misery;
that the house and the people in it were choking her to death.</p>

<p>Mrs. Harris sighed and closed her eyes. Things did seem to be
upset, though she didn't know just why. Mandy, however, had her
suspicions. While she waited on Mr. and Mrs. Templeton at breakfast,
narrowly observing their manner toward each other and Victoria's
swollen eyes and desperate expression, her suspicions grew
stronger.</p>

<p>Instead of going to his office, Mr. Templeton went to the barn and
ran out the buggy. Soon he brought out Cleveland, the black horse,
with his harness on. Mandy watched from the back window. After he had
hitched the horse to the buggy, he came into the kitchen to wash his
hands. While he dried them on the roller towel, he said in his most
business-like tone:</p>

<p>"I likely won't be back tonight, Mandy. I have to go out to my
farm, and I'll hardly get through my business there in time to come
home."</p>

<p>Then Mandy was sure. She had been through these times before, and
at such a crisis poor Mr. Templeton was always called away on
important business. When he had driven out through the alley and up
the street past Mrs. Rosen's, Mandy left her dishes and went in to
Mrs. Harris. She bent over and whispered low:</p>

<p>"Miz' Harris, I 'spect Miss Victoria's done found out she's goin'
to have another baby! It looks that way. She's gone back to bed."</p>

<p>Mrs. Harris lifted a warning finger. "Sh-h-h!"</p>

<p>"Oh yes'm, I won't say nothin'. I never do."</p>

<p>Mrs. Harris tried to face this possibility, but her mind didn't
seem strong enough--she dropped off into another doze.</p>

<p>All that morning Mrs. Templeton lay on her bed alone, the room
darkened and a handkerchief soaked in camphor tied round her
forehead. The twins had taken Ronald off to watch them cut grass, and
Hughie played in the kitchen under Mandy's eye.</p>

<p>Now and then Victoria sat upright on the edge of the bed, beat her
hands together softly and looked desperately at the ceiling, then
about at those frail, confining walls. If only she could meet the
situation with violence, fight it, conquer it! But there was nothing
for it but stupid animal patience. She would have to go through all
that again, and nobody, not even Hillary, wanted another baby,--poor
as they were, and in this overcrowded house. Anyhow, she told
herself, she was ashamed to have another baby, when she had a
daughter old enough to go to college! She was sick of it all; sick of
dragging this chain of life that never let her rest and periodically
knotted and overpowered her; made her ill and hideous for months, and
then dropped another baby into her arms. She had had babies enough;
and there ought to be an end to such apprehensions some time before
you were old and ugly.</p>

<p>She wanted to run away, back to Tennessee, and lead a free, gay
life, as she had when she was first married. She could do a great
deal more with freedom than ever Vickie could. She was still young,
and she was still handsome; why must she be for ever shut up in a
little cluttered house with children and fresh babies and an old
woman and a stupid bound girl and a husband who wasn't very
successful? Life hadn't brought her what she expected when she
married Hillary Templeton; life hadn't used her right. She had tried
to keep up appearances, to dress well with very little to do it on,
to keep young for her husband and children. She had tried, she had
tried! Mrs. Templeton buried her face in the pillow and smothered the
sobs that shook the bed.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>Hillary Templeton, on his drive out through the sage-brush, up
into the farming country that was irrigated from the North Platte,
did not feel altogether cheerful, though he whistled and sang to
himself on the way. He was sorry Victoria would have to go through
another time. It was awkward just now, too, when he was so short of
money. But he was naturally a cheerful man, modest in his demands
upon fortune, and easily diverted from unpleasant thoughts. Before
Cleveland had travelled half the eighteen miles to the farm, his
master was already looking forward to a visit with his tenants, an
old German couple who were fond of him because he never pushed them
in a hard year--so far, all the years had been hard--and he sometimes
brought them bananas and such delicacies from town.</p>

<p>Mrs. Heyse would open her best preserves for him, he knew, and
kill a chicken, and tonight he would have a clean bed in her spare
room. She always put a vase of flowers in his room when he stayed
overnight with them, and that pleased him very much. He felt like a
youth out there, and forgot all the bills he had somehow to meet, and
the loans he had made and couldn't collect. The Heyses kept bees and
raised turkeys, and had honeysuckle vines running over the front
porch. He loved all those things. Mr. Templeton touched Cleveland
with the whip, and as they sped along into the grass country, sang
softly:</p>

<p> </p>

<p>"Old Jesse was a gem'man,<br>
 Way down in Tennessee."</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Mandy had to manage the house herself that day, and she was not at
all sorry. There wasn't a great deal of variety in her life, and she
felt very important taking Mrs. Harris's place, giving the children
their dinner, and carrying a plate of milk toast to Mrs. Templeton.
She was worried about Mrs. Harris, however, and remarked to the
children at noon that she thought somebody ought to "set" with their
grandma. Vickie wasn't home for dinner. She had her father's office
to herself for the day and was making the most of it, writing a long
letter to Professor Chalmers. Mr. Rosen had invited her to have
dinner with him at the hotel (he boarded there when his wife was
away), and that was a great honour.</p>

<p>When Mandy said someone ought to be with the old lady, Bert and
Del offered to take turns. Adelbert went off to rake up the grass
they had been cutting all morning, and Albert sat down in the
play-room. It seemed to him his grandmother looked pretty sick. He
watched her while Mandy gave her toast-water with whisky in it, and
thought he would like to make the room look a little nicer. While
Mrs. Harris lay with her eyes closed, he hung up the caps and coats
lying about, and moved away the big rocking-chair that stood by the
head of Grandma's bed. There ought to be a table there, he believed,
but the small tables in the house all had something on them.
Upstairs, in the room where he and Adelbert and Ronald slept, there
was a nice clean wooden cracker-box, on which they sat in the morning
to put on their shoes and stockings. He brought this down and stood
it on end at the head of Grandma's lounge, and put a clean napkin
over the top of it.</p>

<p>She opened her eyes and smiled at him. "Could you git me a tin of
fresh water, honey?"</p>

<p>He went to the back porch and pumped till the water ran cold. He
gave it to her in a tin cup as she had asked, but he didn't think
that was the right way. After she dropped back on the pillow, he
fetched a glass tumbler from the cupboard, filled it, and set it on
the table he had just manufactured. When Grandmother drew a red
cotton handkerchief from under her pillow and wiped the moisture from
her face, he ran upstairs again and got one of his Sunday-school
handkerchiefs, linen ones, that Mrs. Rosen had given him and Del for
Christmas. Having put this in Grandmother's hand and taken away the
crumpled red one, he could think of nothing else to do--except to
darken the room a little. The windows had no blinds, but flimsy
cretonne curtains tied back,--not really tied, but caught back over
nails driven into the sill. He loosened them and let them hang down
over the bright afternoon sunlight. Then he sat down on the low
sawed-off chair and gazed about, thinking that now it looked quite
like a sick-room.</p>

<p>It was hard for a little boy to keep still. "Would you like me to
read <i>Joe's Luck</i> to you, Gram'ma?" he said presently.</p>

<p>"You might, Bertie."</p>

<p>He got the "boy's book" she had been reading aloud to them, and
began where she had left off. Mrs. Harris liked to hear his voice,
and she liked to look at him when she opened her eyes from time to
time. She did not follow the story. In her mind she was repeating a
passage from the second part of <i>Pilgrim's Progress,</i> which she
had read aloud to the children so many times; the passage where
Christiana and her band come to the arbour on the Hill of Difficulty:
<i>"Then said Mercy, how sweet is rest to them that labour."</i></p>

<p>At about four o'clock Adelbert came home, hot and sweaty from
raking. He said he had got in the grass and taken it to their cow,
and if Bert was reading, he guessed he'd like to listen. He dragged
the wooden rocking-chair up close to Grandma's bed and curled up in
it.</p>

<p>Grandmother was perfectly happy. She and the twins were about the
same age; they had in common all the realest and truest things. The
years between them and her, it seemed to Mrs. Harris, were full of
trouble and unimportant. The twins and Ronald and Hughie were
important. She opened her eyes.</p>

<p>"Where is Hughie?" she asked.</p>

<p>"I guess he's asleep. Mother took him into her bed."</p>

<p>"And Ronald?"</p>

<p>"He's upstairs with Mandy. There ain't nobody in the kitchen
now."</p>

<p>"Then you might git me a fresh drink, Del."</p>

<p>"Yes'm, Gram'ma." He tiptoed out to the pump in his brown canvas
sneakers.</p>

<p>When Vickie came home at five o'clock, she went to her mother's
room, but the door was locked--a thing she couldn't remember ever
happening before. She went into the playroom,--old Mrs. Harris was
asleep, with one of the twins on guard, and he held up a warning
finger. She went into the kitchen. Mandy was making biscuits, and
Ronald was helping her to cut them out.</p>

<p>"What's the matter, Mandy? Where is everybody?"</p>

<p>"You know your papa's away, Miss Vickie; an' your mama's got a
headache, an' Miz' Harris has had a bad spell. Maybe I'll just fix
supper for you an' the boys in the kitchen, so you won't all have to
be runnin' through her room."</p>

<p>"Oh, very well," said Vickie bitterly, and she went upstairs.
Wasn't it just like them all to go and get sick, when she had now
only two weeks to get ready for school, and no trunk and no clothes
or anything? Nobody but Mr. Rosen seemed to take the least interest,
"when my whole life hangs by a thread," she told herself fiercely.
What were families for, anyway?</p>

<p>After supper Vickie went to her father's office to read; she told
Mandy to leave the kitchen door open, and when she got home she would
go to bed without disturbing anybody. The twins ran out to play under
the electric light with the neighbour boys for a little while, then
slipped softly up the back stairs to their room. Mandy came to Mrs.
Harris after the house was still.</p>

<p>"Kin I rub your legs fur you, Miz' Harris?"</p>

<p>"Thank you, Mandy. And you might get me a clean nightcap out of
the press."</p>

<p>Mandy returned with it.</p>

<p>"Lawsie me! But your legs is cold, ma'am!"</p>

<p>"I expect it's about time, Mandy," murmured the old lady. Mandy
knelt on the floor and set to work with a will. It brought the sweat
out on her, and at last she sat up and wiped her face with the back
of her hand.</p>

<p>"I can't seem to git no heat into 'em, Miz' Harris. I got a hot
flat-iron on the stove; I'll wrap it in a piece of old blanket and
put it to your feet. Why didn't you have the boys tell me you was
cold, pore soul?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Harris did not answer. She thought it was probably a cold
that neither Mandy nor the flat-iron could do much with. She hadn't
nursed so many people back in Tennessee without coming to know
certain signs.</p>

<p>After Mandy was gone, she fell to thinking of her blessings. Every
night for years, when she said her prayers, she had prayed that she
might never have a long sickness or be a burden. She dreaded the
heart-ache and humiliation of being helpless on the hands of people
who would be impatient under such a care. And now she felt certain
that she was going to die tonight, without troubling anybody.</p>

<p>She was glad Mrs. Rosen was in Chicago. Had she been at home, she
would certainly have come in, would have seen that her old neighbour
was very sick, and bustled about. Her quick eye would have found out
all Grandmother's little secrets: how hard her bed was, that she had
no proper place to wash, and kept her comb in her pocket; that her
nightgowns were patched and darned. Mrs. Rosen would have been
indignant, and that would have made Victoria cross. She didn't have
to see Mrs. Rosen again to know that Mrs. Rosen thought highly of her
and admired her--yes, admired her. Those funny little pats and arch
pleasantries had meant a great deal to Mrs. Harris.</p>

<p>It was a blessing that Mr. Templeton was away, too. Appearances
had to be kept up when there was a man in the house; and he might
have taken it into his head to send for the doctor, and stir
everybody up. Now everything would be so peaceful. <i>"The Lord is my
shepherd"</i> she whispered gratefully. "Yes, Lord, I always spoiled
Victoria. She was so much the prettiest. But nobody won't ever be the
worse for it: Mr. Templeton will always humour her, and the children
love her more than most. They'll always be good to her; she has that
way with her."</p>

<p>Grandma fell to remembering the old place at home: what a dashing,
high-spirited girl Victoria was, and how proud she had always been of
her; how she used to hear her laughing and teasing out in the lilac
arbour when Hillary Templeton was courting her. Toward morning all
these pleasant reflections faded out. Mrs. Harris felt that she and
her bed were softly sinking, through the darkness to a deeper
darkness.</p>

<p>Old Mrs. Harris did not really die that night, but she believed
she did. Mandy found her unconscious in the morning. Then there was a
great stir and bustle; Victoria, and even Vickie, were startled out
of their intense self-absorption. Mrs. Harris was hastily carried out
of the play-room and laid in Victoria's bed, put into one of
Victoria's best nightgowns. Mr. Templeton was sent for, and the
doctor was sent for. The inquisitive Mrs. Jackson from next door got
into the house at last,--installed herself as nurse, and no one had
the courage to say her nay. But Grandmother was out of it all, never
knew that she was the object of so much attention and excitement. She
died a little while after Mr. Templeton got home.</p>

<p>Thus Mrs. Harris slipped out of the Templetons' story; but
Victoria and Vickie had still to go on, to follow the long road that
leads through things unguessed at and unforeseeable. When they are
old, they will come closer and closer to Grandma Harris. They will
think a great deal about her, and remember things they never noticed;
and their lot will be more or less like hers. They will regret that
they heeded her so little; but they, too, will look into the eager,
unseeing eyes of young people and feel themselves alone. They will
say to themselves: "I was heartless, because I was young and strong
and wanted things so much. But now I know."</p>

<p> </p>

<h2>I</h2>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>Even in early youth, when the mind is so eager for the new and
untried, while it is still a stranger to faltering and fear, we yet
like to think that there are certain unalterable realities, somewhere
at the bottom of things. These anchors may be ideas; but more often
they are merely pictures, vivid memories, which in some unaccountable
and very personal way give us courage. The sea-gulls, that seem so
much creatures of the free wind and waves, that are as homeless as
the sea (able to rest upon the tides and ride the storm, needing
nothing but water and sky), at certain seasons even they go back to
something they have known before; to remote islands and lonely ledges
that are their breeding-grounds. The restlessness of youth has such
retreats, even though it may be ashamed of them.</p>

<p>Long ago, before the invention of the motorcar (which has made
more changes in the world than the War, which indeed produced the
particular kind of war that happened just a hundred years after
Waterloo), in a little wooden town in a shallow Kansas river valley,
there lived two friends. They were "business men," the two most
prosperous and influential men in our community, the two men whose
affairs took them out into the world to big cities, who had
"connections" in St. Joseph and Chicago. In my childhood they
represented to me success and power.</p>

<p>R. E. Dillon was of Irish extraction, one of the dark Irish, with
glistening jet-black hair and moustache, and thick eyebrows. His skin
was very white, bluish on his shaven cheeks and chin. Shaving must
have been a difficult process for him, because there were no smooth
expanses for the razor to glide over. The bony structure of his face
was prominent and unusual; high cheek-bones, a bold Roman nose, a
chin cut by deep lines, with a hard dimple at the tip, a jutting
ridge over his eyes where his curly black eyebrows grew and met. It
was a face in many planes, as if the carver had whittled and modelled
and indented to see how far he could go. Yet on meeting him what you
saw was an imperious head on a rather small, wiry man, a head held
conspicuously and proudly erect, with a carriage unmistakably
arrogant and consciously superior. Dillon had a musical, vibrating
voice, and the changeable grey eye that is peculiarly Irish. His full
name, which he never used, was Robert Emmet Dillon, so there must
have been a certain feeling somewhere back in his family.</p>

<p>He was the principal banker in our town, and proprietor of the
large general store next the bank; he owned farms up in the grass
country, and a fine ranch in the green timbered valley of the Caw. He
was, according to our standards, a rich man.</p>

<p>His friend, J. H. Trueman, was what we called a big cattleman.
Trueman was from Buffalo; his family were old residents there, and he
had come West as a young man because he was restless and
unconventional in his tastes. He was fully ten years older than
Dillon,--in his early fifties, when I knew him; large, heavy, very
slow in his movements, not given to exercise. His countenance was as
unmistakably American as Dillon's was not,--but American of that
period, not of this. He did not belong to the time of efficiency and
advertising and progressive methods. For any form of pushing or
boosting he had a cold, unqualified contempt. All this was in his
face,--heavy, immobile, rather melancholy, not remarkable in any
particular. But the moment one looked at him one felt solidity, an
entire absence of anything mean or small, easy carelessness, courage,
a high sense of honour.</p>

<p>These two men had been friends for ten years before I knew them,
and I knew them from the time I was ten until I was thirteen. I saw
them as often as I could, because they led more varied lives than the
other men in our town; one could look up to them. Dillon, I believe,
was the more intelligent. Trueman had, perhaps, a better tradition,
more background.</p>

<p>Dillon's bank and general store stood at the corner of Main Street
and a cross-street, and on this cross-street, two short blocks away,
my family lived. On my way to and from school, and going on the
countless errands that I was sent upon day and night, I always passed
Dillon's store. Its long, red brick wall, with no windows except high
overhead, ran possibly a hundred feet along the sidewalk of the
cross-street. The front door and show windows were on Main Street,
and the bank was next door. The board sidewalk along that red brick
wall was wider than any other piece of walk in town, smoother, better
laid, kept in perfect repair; very good to walk on in a community
where most things were flimsy. I liked the store and the brick wall
and the sidewalk because they were solid and well built, and possibly
I admired Dillon and Trueman for much the same reason. They were
secure and established. So many of our citizens were nervous little
hopper men, trying to get on. Dillon and Trueman had got on; they
stood with easy assurance on a deck that was their own.</p>

<p>In the daytime one did not often see them together--each went
about his own affairs. But every evening they were both to be found
at Dillon's store. The bank, of course, was locked and dark before
the sun went down, but the store was always open until ten o'clock;
the clerks put in a long day. So did Dillon. He and his store were
one. He never acted as salesman, and he kept a cashier in the
wire-screened office at the back end of the store; but he was there
to be called on. The thrifty Swedes to the north, who were his best
customers, usually came to town and did their shopping after
dark--they didn't squander daylight hours in farming season. In these
evening visits with his customers, and on his drives in his buckboard
among the farms, Dillon learned all he needed to know about how much
money it was safe to advance a farmer who wanted to feed cattle, or
to buy a steam thrasher or build a new barn.</p>

<p>Every evening in winter, when I went to the post-office after
supper, I passed through Dillon's store instead of going round
it,--for the warmth and cheerfulness, and to catch sight of Mr.
Dillon and Mr. Trueman playing checkers in the office behind the wire
screening; both seated on high accountant's stools, with the
checker-board on the cashier's desk before them. I knew all Dillon's
clerks, and if they were not busy, I often lingered about to talk to
them; sat on one of the grocery counters and watched the
checker-players from a distance. I remember Mr. Dillon's hand used to
linger in the air above the board before he made a move; a well-kept
hand, white, marked with blue veins and streaks of strong black hair.
Trueman's hands rested on his knees under the desk while he
considered; he took a checker, set it down, then dropped his hand on
his knee again. He seldom made an unnecessary movement with his hands
or feet. Each of the men wore a ring on his little finger. Mr.
Dillon's was a large diamond solitaire set in a gold claw, Trueman's
the head of a Roman soldier cut in onyx and set in pale twisted gold;
it had been his father's, I believe.</p>

<p>Exactly at ten o'clock the store closed. Mr. Dillon went home to
his wife and family, to his roomy, comfortable house with a garden
and orchard and big stables. Mr. Trueman, who had long been a
widower, went to his office to begin the day over. He led a double
life, and until one or two o'clock in the morning entertained the
poker-players of our town. After everything was shut for the night, a
queer crowd drifted into Trueman's back office. The company was
seldom the same on two successive evenings, but there were three
tireless poker-players who always came: the billiard-hall proprietor,
with green-gold moustache and eyebrows, and big white teeth; the
horse-trader, who smelled of horses; the dandified cashier of the
bank that rivalled Dillon's. The gamblers met in Trueman's place
because a game that went on there was respectable, was a social game,
no matter how much money changed hands. If the horse-trader or the
crooked money-lender got over-heated and broke loose a little, a look
or a remark from Mr. Trueman would freeze them up. And his remark was
always the same:</p>

<p>"Careful of the language around here."</p>

<p>It was never "your" language, but "the" language,--though he
certainly intended no pleasantry. Trueman himself was not a lucky
poker man; he was never ahead of the game on the whole. He played
because he liked it, and he was willing to pay for his amusement. In
general he was large and indifferent about money matters,--always
carried a few hundred-dollar bills in his inside coat-pocket, and
left his coat hanging anywhere,--in his office, in the bank, in the
barber shop, in the cattle-sheds behind the freight yard.</p>

<p>Now, R. E. Dillon detested gambling, often dropped a contemptuous
word about "poker bugs" before the horse-trader and the billiard-hall
man and the cashier of the other bank. But he never made remarks of
that sort in Trueman's presence. He was a man who voiced his
prejudices fearlessly and cuttingly, but on this and other matters he
held his peace before Trueman. His regard for him must have been very
strong.</p>

<p>During the winter, usually in March, the two friends always took a
trip together, to Kansas City and St. Joseph. When they got ready,
they packed their bags and stepped aboard a fast Santa F&eacute;
train and went; the Limited was often signalled to stop for them.
Their excursions made some of the rest of us feel less shut away and
small-townish, just as their fur overcoats and silk shirts did. They
were the only men in Singleton who wore silk shirts. The other
business men wore white shirts with detachable collars, high and
stiff or low and sprawling, which were changed much oftener than the
shirts. Neither of my heroes was afraid of laundry bills. They did
not wear waistcoats, but went about in their shirt-sleeves in hot
weather; their suspenders were chosen with as much care as their
neckties and handkerchiefs. Once when a bee stung my hand in the
store (a few of them had got into the brown-sugar barrel), Mr. Dillon
himself moistened the sting, put baking soda on it, and bound my hand
up with his pocket handkerchief. It was of the smoothest linen, and
in one corner was a violet square bearing his initials, R. E. D., in
white. There were never any handkerchiefs like that in my family. I
cherished it until it was laundered, and I returned it with
regret.</p>

<p>It was in the spring and summer that one saw Mr. Dillon and Mr.
Trueman at their best. Spring began early with us,--often the first
week of April was hot. Every evening when he came back to the store
after supper, Dillon had one of his clerks bring two arm-chairs out
to the wide sidewalk that ran beside the red brick wall,--office
chairs of the old-fashioned sort, with a low round back which formed
a half-circle to enclose the sitter, and spreading legs, the front
ones slightly higher. In those chairs the two friends would spend the
evening. Dillon would sit down and light a good cigar. In a few
moments Mr. Trueman would come across from Main Street, walking
slowly, spaciously, as if he were used to a great deal of room. As he
approached, Mr. Dillon would call out to him:</p>

<p>"Good evening, J. H. Fine weather."</p>

<p>J. H. would take his place in the empty chair.</p>

<p>"Spring in the air," he might remark, if it were April. Then he
would relight a dead cigar which was always in his hand,--seemed to
belong there, like a thumb or finger.</p>

<p>"I drove up north today to see what the Swedes are doing," Mr.
Dillon might begin. "They're the boys to get the early worm. They
never let the ground go to sleep. Whatever moisture there is, they
get the benefit of it."</p>

<p>"The Swedes are good farmers. I don't sympathize with the way they
work their women."</p>

<p>"The women like it, J. H. It's the old-country way; they're
accustomed to it, and they like it."</p>

<p>"Maybe. I don't like it," Trueman would reply with something like
a grunt.</p>

<p>They talked very much like this all evening; or, rather, Mr.
Dillon talked, and Mr. Trueman made an occasional observation. No one
could tell just how much Mr. Trueman knew about anything, because he
was so consistently silent. Not from diffidence, but from
superiority; from a contempt for chatter, and a liking for silence, a
taste for it. After they had exchanged a few remarks, he and Dillon
often sat in an easy quiet for a long time, watching the passers-by,
watching the wagons on the road, watching the stars. Sometimes, very
rarely, Mr. Trueman told a long story, and it was sure to be an
interesting and unusual one.</p>

<p>But on the whole it was Mr. Dillon who did the talking; he had a
wide-awake voice with much variety in it. Trueman's was thick and
low,--his speech was rather indistinct and never changed in pitch or
tempo. Even when he swore wickedly at the hands who were loading his
cattle into freight cars, it was a mutter, a low, even growl. There
was a curious attitude in men of his class and time, that of being
rather above speech, as they were above any kind of fussiness or
eagerness. But I knew he liked to hear Mr. Dillon talk,--anyone did.
Dillon had such a crisp, clear enunciation, and he could say things
so neatly. People would take a reprimand from him they wouldn't have
taken from anyone else, because he put it so well. His voice was
never warm or soft--it had a cool, sparkling quality; but it could be
very humorous, very kind and considerate, very teasing and
stimulating. Every sentence he uttered was alive, never languid,
perfunctory, slovenly, unaccented. When he made a remark, it not only
meant something, but sounded like something,--sounded like the thing
he meant.</p>

<p>When Mr. Dillon was closeted with a depositor in his private room
in the bank, and you could not hear his words through the closed
door, his voice told you exactly the degree of esteem in which he
held that customer. It was interested, encouraging, deliberative,
humorous, satisfied, admiring, cold, critical, haughty, contemptuous,
according to the deserts and pretensions of his listener. And one
could tell when the person closeted with him was a woman; a farmer's
wife, or a woman who was trying to run a little business, or a
country girl hunting a situation. There was a difference; something
peculiarly kind and encouraging. But if it were a foolish,
extravagant woman, or a girl he didn't approve of, oh, then one knew
it well enough! The tone was courteous, but cold; relentless as the
multiplication table.</p>

<p>All these possibilities of voice made his evening talk in the
spring dusk very interesting; interesting for Trueman and for me. I
found many pretexts for lingering near them, and they never seemed to
mind my hanging about. I was very quiet. I often sat on the edge of
the sidewalk with my feet hanging down and played jacks by the hour
when there was moonlight. On dark nights I sometimes perched on top
of one of the big goods-boxes--we called them "store boxes,"--there
were usually several of these standing empty on the sidewalk against
the red brick wall.</p>

<p>I liked to listen to those two because theirs was the only
"conversation" one could hear about the streets. The older men talked
of nothing but politics and their business, and the very young men's
talk was entirely what they called "josh"; very personal, supposed to
be funny, and really not funny at all. It was scarcely speech, but
noises, snorts, giggles, yawns, sneezes, with a few abbreviated words
and slang expressions which stood for a hundred things. The original
Indians of the Kansas plains had more to do with articulate speech
than had our promising young men.</p>

<p>To be sure my two aristocrats sometimes discussed politics, and
joked each other about the policies and pretentions of their
respective parties. Mr. Dillon, of course, was a Democrat,--it was in
the very frosty sparkle of his speech,--and Mr. Trueman was a
Republican; his rear, as he walked about the town, looked a little
like the walking elephant labelled "G. O. P." in <i>Puck.</i> But
each man seemed to enjoy hearing his party ridiculed, took it as a
compliment.</p>

<p>In the spring their talk was usually about weather and planting
and pasture and cattle. Mr. Dillon went about the country in his
light buckboard a great deal at that season, and he knew what every
farmer was doing and what his chances were, just how much he was
falling behind or getting ahead.</p>

<p>"I happened to drive by Oscar Ericson's place today, and I saw as
nice a lot of calves as you could find anywhere," he would begin, and
Ericson's history and his family would be pretty thoroughly discussed
before they changed the subject.</p>

<p>Or he might come out with something sharp: "By the way, J. H., I
saw an amusing sight today. I turned in at Sandy Bright's place to
get water for my horse, and he had a photographer out there taking
pictures of his house and barn. It would be more to the point if he
had a picture taken of the mortgages he's put on that farm."</p>

<p>Trueman would give a short, mirthless response, more like a cough
than a laugh.</p>

<p>Those April nights, when the darkness itself tasted dusty (or, by
the special mercy of God, cool and damp), when the smell of burning
grass was in the air, and a sudden breeze brought the scent of wild
plum blossoms,--those evenings were only a restless preparation for
the summer nights,--nights of full liberty and perfect idleness. Then
there was no school, and one's family never bothered about where one
was. My parents were young and full of life, glad to have the
children out of the way. All day long there had been the excitement
that intense heat produces in some people,--a mild drunkenness made
of sharp contrasts; thirst and cold water, the blazing stretch of
Main Street and the cool of the brick stores when one dived into
them. By nightfall one was ready to be quiet. My two friends were
always in their best form on those moonlit summer nights, and their
talk covered a wide range.</p>

<p>I suppose there were moonless nights, and dark ones with but a
silver shaving and pale stars in the sky, just as in the spring. But
I remember them all as flooded by the rich indolence of a full moon,
or a half-moon set in uncertain blue. Then Trueman and Dillon would
sit with their coats off and have a supply of fresh handkerchiefs to
mop their faces; they were more largely and positively themselves.
One could distinguish their features, the stripes on their shirts,
the flash of Mr. Dillon's diamond; but their shadows made two dark
masses on the white sidewalk. The brick wall behind them, faded
almost pink by the burning of successive summers, took on a carnelian
hue at night. Across the street, which was merely a dusty road, lay
an open space, with a few stunted box-elder trees, where the farmers
left their wagons and teams when they came to town. Beyond this space
stood a row of frail wooden buildings, due to be pulled down any day;
tilted, crazy, with outside stairs going up to rickety second-storey
porches that sagged in the middle. They had once been white, but were
now grey, with faded blue doors along the wavy upper porches. These
abandoned buildings, an eyesore by day, melted together into a
curious pile in the moonlight, became an immaterial structure of
velvet-white and glossy blackness, with here and there a faint smear
of blue door, or a tilted patch of sage-green that had once been a
shutter.</p>

<p>The road, just in front of the sidewalk where I sat and played
jacks, would be ankle-deep in dust, and seemed to drink up the
moonlight like folds of velvet. It drank up sound, too; muffled the
wagon-wheels and hoof-beats; lay soft and meek like the last residuum
of material things,--the soft bottom resting-place. Nothing in the
world, not snow mountains or blue seas, is so beautiful in moonlight
as the soft, dry summer roads in a farming country, roads where the
white dust falls back from the slow wagon-wheel.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>Wonderful things do happen even in the dullest places--in the
cornfields and the wheat-fields. Sitting there on the edge of the
sidewalk one summer night, my feet hanging in the warm dust, I saw a
transit of Venus. Only the three of us were there. It was a hot
night, and the clerks had closed the store and gone home. Mr. Dillon
and Mr. Trueman waited on a little while to watch. It was a very blue
night, breathless and clear, not the smallest cloud from horizon to
horizon. Everything up there overhead seemed as usual, it was the
familiar face of a summer-night sky. But presently we saw one bright
star moving. Mr. Dillon called to me; told me to watch what was going
to happen, as I might never chance to see it again in my
lifetime.</p>

<p>That big star certainly got nearer and nearer the moon,--very
rapidly, too, until there was not the width of your hand between
them--now the width of two fingers--then it passed directly into the
moon at about the middle of its girth; absolutely disappeared. The
star we had been watching was gone. We waited, I do not know how
long, but it seemed to me about fifteen minutes. Then we saw a bright
wart on the other edge of the moon, but for a second only,--the
machinery up there worked fast. While the two men were exclaiming and
telling me to look, the planet swung clear of the golden disk, a rift
of blue came between them and widened very fast. The planet did not
seem to move, but that inky blue space between it and the moon seemed
to spread. The thing was over.</p>

<p>My friends stayed on long past their usual time and talked about
eclipses and such matters.</p>

<p>"Let me see," Mr. Trueman remarked slowly, "they reckon the moon's
about two hundred and fifty thousand miles away from us. I wonder how
far that star is."</p>

<p>"I don't know, J. H., and I really don't much care. When we can
get the tramps off the railroad, and manage to run this town with one
fancy house instead of two, and have a Federal Government that is as
honest as a good banking business, then it will be plenty of time to
turn our attention to the stars."</p>

<p>Mr. Trueman chuckled and took his cigar from between his teeth.
"Maybe the stars will throw some light on all that, if we get the run
of them," he said humorously. Then he added: "Mustn't be a reformer,
R. E. Nothing in it. That's the only time you ever get off on the
wrong foot. Life is what it always has been, always will be. No use
to make a fuss." He got up, said: "Good-night, R. E.," said
good-night to me, too, because this had been an unusual occasion, and
went down the sidewalk with his wide, sailor-like tread, as if he
were walking the deck of his own ship.</p>

<p>When Dillon and Trueman went to St. Joseph, or, as we called it,
St. Joe, they stopped at the same hotel, but their diversions were
very dissimilar. Mr. Dillon was a family man and a good Catholic; he
behaved in St. Joe very much as if he were at home. His sister was
Mother Superior of a convent there, and he went to see her often. The
nuns made much of him, and he enjoyed their admiration and all the
ceremony with which they entertained him. When his two daughters were
going to the convent school, he used to give theatre parties for
them, inviting all their friends.</p>

<p>Mr. Trueman's way of amusing himself must have tried his friend's
patience--Dillon liked to regulate other people's affairs if they
needed it. Mr. Trueman had a lot of poker-playing friends among the
commission men in St. Joe, and he sometimes dropped a good deal of
money. He was supposed to have rather questionable women friends
there, too. The grasshopper men of our town used to say that Trueman
was financial adviser to a woman who ran a celebrated sporting house.
Mary Trent, her name was. She must have been a very unusual woman;
she had credit with all the banks, and never got into any sort of
trouble. She had formerly been head mistress of a girls' finishing
school and knew how to manage young women. It was probably a fact
that Trueman knew her and found her interesting, as did many another
sound business man of that time. Mr. Dillon must have shut his ears
to these rumours,--a measure of the great value he put on Trueman's
companionship.</p>

<p>Though they did not see much of each other on these trips, they
immensely enjoyed taking them together. They often dined together at
the end of the day, and afterwards went to the theatre. They both
loved the theatre; not this play or that actor, but the
theatre,--whether they saw <i>Hamlet</i> or <i>Pinafore.</i> It was
an age of good acting, and the drama held a more dignified position
in the world than it holds today.</p>

<p>After Dillon and Trueman had come home from the city, they used
sometimes to talk over the plays they had seen, recalling the great
scenes and fine effects. Occasionally an item in the Kansas City
<i>Star</i> would turn their talk to the stage.</p>

<p>"J. H., I see by the paper that Edwin Booth is very sick," Mr.
Dillon announced one evening as Trueman came up to take the empty
chair.</p>

<p>"Yes, I noticed." Trueman sat down and lit his dead cigar. "He's
not a young man any more." A long pause. Dillon always seemed to know
when the pause would be followed by a remark, and waited for it. "The
first time I saw Edwin Booth was in Buffalo. It was in <i>Richard the
Second,</i> and it made a great impression on me at the time."
Another pause. "I don't know that I'd care to see him in that play
again. I like tragedy, but that play's a little too tragic. Something
very black about it. I think I prefer <i>Hamlet."</i></p>

<p>They had seen Mary Anderson in St. Louis once, and talked of it
for years afterwards. Mr. Dillon was very proud of her because she
was a Catholic girl, and called her "our Mary." It was curious that a
third person, who had never seen these actors or read the plays,
could get so much of the essence of both from the comments of two
business men who used none of the language in which such things are
usually discussed, who merely reminded each other of moments here and
there in the action. But they saw the play over again as they talked
of it, and perhaps whatever is seen by the narrator as he speaks is
sensed by the listener, quite irrespective of words. This
transference of experience went further: in some way the lives of
those two men came across to me as they talked, the strong, bracing
reality of successful, large-minded men who had made their way in the
world when business was still a personal adventure.</p>

<h2>II</h2>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>Mr. Dillon went to Chicago once a year to buy goods for his store.
Trueman would usually accompany him as far as St. Joe, but no
farther. He dismissed Chicago as "too big." He didn't like to be one
of the crowd, didn't feel at home in a city where he wasn't
recognized as J. H. Trueman.</p>

<p>It was one of these trips to Chicago that brought about the
end--for me and for them; a stupid, senseless, commonplace end.</p>

<p>Being a Democrat, already somewhat "tainted" by the free-silver
agitation, one spring Dillon delayed his visit to Chicago in order to
be there for the Democratic Convention--it was the Convention that
first nominated Bryan.</p>

<p>On the night after his return from Chicago, Mr. Dillon was seated
in his chair on the sidewalk, surrounded by a group of men who wanted
to hear all about the nomination of a man from a neighbour State. Mr.
Trueman came across the street in his leisurely way, greeted Dillon,
and asked him how he had found Chicago,--whether he had had a good
trip.</p>

<p>Mr. Dillon must have been annoyed because Trueman didn't mention
the Convention. He threw back his head rather haughtily. "Well, J.
H., since I saw you last, we've found a great leader in this country,
and a great orator." There was a frosty sparkle in his voice that
presupposed opposition,--like the feint of a boxer getting ready.</p>

<p>"Great windbag!" muttered Trueman. He sat down in his chair, but I
noticed that he did not settle himself and cross his legs as
usual.</p>

<p>Mr. Dillon gave an artificial laugh. "It's nothing against a man
to be a fine orator. All the great leaders have been eloquent. This
Convention was a memorable occasion; it gave the Democratic party a
rebirth."</p>

<p>"Gave it a black eye, and a blind spot, I'd say!" commented
Trueman. He didn't raise his voice, but he spoke with more heat than
I had ever heard from him. After a moment he added: "I guess Grover
Cleveland must be a sick man; must feel like he'd taken a lot of
trouble for nothing."</p>

<p>Mr. Dillon ignored these thrusts and went on telling the group
around him about the Convention, but there was a special nimbleness
and exactness in his tongue, a chill politeness in his voice that
meant anger. Presently he turned again to Mr. Trueman, as if he could
now trust himself:</p>

<p>"It was one of the great speeches of history, J. H.; our
grandchildren will have to study it in school, as we did Patrick
Henry's."</p>

<p>"Glad I haven't got any grandchildren, if they'd be brought up on
that sort of tall talk," said Mr. Trueman. "Sounds like a schoolboy
had written it. Absolutely nothing back of it but an unsound
theory."</p>

<p>Mr. Dillon's laugh made me shiver; it was like a thin glitter of
danger. He arched his curly eyebrows provokingly.</p>

<p>"We'll have four years of currency reform, anyhow. By the end of
that time, you old dyed-in-the-wool Republicans will be thinking
differently. The under dog is going to have a chance."</p>

<p>Mr. Trueman shifted in his chair. "That's no way for a banker to
talk." He spoke very low. "The Democrats will have a long time to be
sorry they ever turned Pops. No use talking to you while your Irish
is up. I'll wait till you cool off." He rose and walked away, less
deliberately than usual, and Mr. Dillon, watching his retreating
figure, laughed haughtily and disagreeably. He asked the
grain-elevator man to take the vacated chair. The group about him
grew, and he sat expounding the reforms proposed by the Democratic
candidate until a late hour.</p>

<p>For the first time in my life I listened with breathless interest
to a political discussion. Whoever Mr. Dillon failed to convince, he
convinced me. I grasped it at once: that gold had been responsible
for most of the miseries and inequalities of the world; that it had
always been the club the rich and cunning held over the poor; and
that "the free and unlimited coinage of silver" would remedy all
this. Dillon declared that young Mr. Bryan had looked like the
patriots of old when he faced and challenged high finance with: "You
shall not press this crown of thorns upon the brow of labour; you
shall not crucify mankind upon a cross of gold." I thought that
magnificent; I thought the cornfields would show them a thing or two,
back there!</p>

<p>R. E. Dillon had never taken an aggressive part in politics. But
from that night on, the Democratic candidate and the free-silver
plank were the subject of his talks with his customers and
depositors. He drove about the country convincing the farmers, went
to the neighbouring towns to use his influence with the merchants,
organized the Bryan Club and the Bryan Ladies' Quartette in our
county, contributed largely to the campaign fund. This was all a new
line of conduct for Mr. Dillon, and it sat unsteadily on him. Even
his voice became unnatural; there was a sting of comeback in it. His
new character made him more like other people and took away from his
special personal quality. I wonder whether it was not Trueman, more
than Bryan, who put such an edge on him.</p>

<p>While all these things were going on, Trueman kept to his own
office. He came to Dillon's bank on business, but he did not "come
back to the sidewalk," as I put it to myself. He waited and said
nothing, but he looked grim. After a month or so, when he saw that
this thing was not going to blow over, when he heard how Dillon had
been talking to representative men all over the county, and saw the
figure he had put down for the campaign fund, then Trueman remarked
to some of his friends that a banker had no business to commit
himself to a scatter-brained financial policy which would destroy
credit.</p>

<p>The next morning Mr. Trueman went to the bank across the street,
the rival of Dillon's, and wrote a cheque on Dillon's bank "for the
amount of my balance." He wasn't the sort of man who would ever know
what his balance was, he merely kept it big enough to cover
emergencies. That afternoon the Merchants' National took the check
over to Dillon on its collecting rounds, and by night the word was
all over town that Trueman had changed his bank. After this there
would be no going back, people said. To change your bank was one of
the most final things you could do. The little, unsuccessful men were
pleased, as they always are at the destruction of anything strong and
fine.</p>

<p>All through the summer and the autumn of that campaign Mr. Dillon
was away a great deal. When he was at home, he took his evening
airing on the sidewalk, and there was always a group of men about
him, talking of the coming election; that was the most exciting
presidential campaign people could remember. I often passed this
group on my way to the post-office, but there was no temptation to
linger now. Mr. Dillon seemed like another man, and my zeal to free
humanity from the cross of gold had cooled. Mr. Trueman I seldom saw.
When he passed me on the street, he nodded kindly.</p>

<p>The election and Bryan's defeat did nothing to soften Dillon. He
had been sure of a Democratic victory. I believe he felt almost as if
Trueman were responsible for the triumph of Hanna and McKinley. At
least he knew that Trueman was exceedingly well satisfied, and that
was bitter to him. He seemed to me sarcastic and sharp all the time
now.</p>

<p>I don't believe self-interest would ever have made a breach
between Dillon and Trueman. Neither would have taken advantage of the
other. If a combination of circumstances had made it necessary that
one or the other should take a loss in money or prestige, I think
Trueman would have pocketed the loss. That was his way. It was his
code, moreover. A gentleman pocketed his gains mechanically, in the
day's routine; but he pocketed losses punctiliously, with a sharp, if
bitter, relish. I believe now, as I believed then, that this was a
quarrel of "principle." Trueman looked down on anyone who could take
the reasoning of the Populist party seriously. He was a perfectly
direct man, and he showed his contempt. That was enough. It lost me
my special pleasure of summer nights: the old stories of the early
West that sometimes came to the surface; the minute biographies of
the farming people; the clear, detailed, illuminating accounts of all
that went on in the great crop-growing, cattle-feeding world; and the
silence,--the strong, rich, outflowing silence between two friends,
that was as full and satisfying as the moonlight. I was never to know
its like again.</p>

<p>After that rupture nothing went well with either of my two great
men. Things were out of true, the equilibrium was gone. Formerly,
when they used to sit in their old places on the sidewalk, two black
figures with patches of shadow below, they seemed like two bodies
held steady by some law of balance, an unconscious relation like that
between the earth and the moon. It was this mathematical harmony
which gave a third person pleasure.</p>

<p>Before the next presidential campaign came round, Mr. Dillon died
(a young man still) very suddenly, of pneumonia. We didn't know that
he was seriously ill until one of his clerks came running to our
house to tell us he was dead. The same clerk, half out of his
wits--it looked like the end of the world to him--ran on to tell Mr.
Trueman.</p>

<p>Mr. Trueman thanked him. He called his confidential man, and told
him to order flowers from Kansas City. Then he went to his house,
informed his housekeeper that he was going away on business, and
packed his bag. That same night he boarded the Santa F&eacute;
Limited and didn't stop until he was in San Francisco. He was gone
all spring. His confidential clerk wrote him letters every week about
the business and the new calves, and got telegrams in reply. Trueman
never wrote letters.</p>

<p>When Mr. Trueman at last came home, he stayed only a few months.
He sold out everything he owned to a stranger from Kansas City; his
feeding ranch, his barns and sheds, his house and town lots. It was a
terrible blow to me; now only the common, everyday people would be
left. I used to walk mournfully up and down before his office while
all these deeds were being signed,--there were usually lawyers and
notaries inside. But once, when he happened to be alone, he called me
in, asked me how old I was now, and how far along I had got in
school. His face and voice were more than kind, but he seemed
absent-minded, as if he were trying to recall something. Presently he
took from his watch-chain a red seal I had always admired, reached
for my hand, and dropped the piece of carnelian into my palm.</p>

<p>"For a keepsake," he said evasively.</p>

<p>When the transfer of his property was completed, Mr. Trueman left
us for good. He spent the rest of his life among the golden hills of
San Francisco. He moved into the Saint Francis Hotel when it was
first built, and had an office in a high building at the top of what
is now Powell Street. There he read his letters in the morning and
played poker at night. I've heard a man whose offices were next his
tell how Trueman used to sit tilted back in his desk chair, a
half-consumed cigar in his mouth, morning after morning, apparently
doing nothing, watching the Bay and the ferry-boats, across a line of
wind-racked eucalyptus trees. He died at the Saint Francis about nine
years after he left our part of the world.</p>

<p>The breaking-up of that friendship between two men who scarcely
noticed my existence was a real loss to me, and has ever since been a
regret. More than once, in Southern countries where there is a smell
of dust and dryness in the air and the nights are intense, I have
come upon a stretch of dusty white road drinking up the moonlight
beside a blind wall, and have felt a sudden sadness. Perhaps it was
not until the next morning that I knew why,--and then only because I
had dreamed of Mr. Dillon or Mr. Trueman in my sleep. When that old
scar is occasionally touched by chance, it rouses the old uneasiness;
the feeling of something broken that could so easily have been
mended; of something delightful that was senselessly wasted, of a
truth that was accidentally distorted--one of the truths we want to
keep.</p>
