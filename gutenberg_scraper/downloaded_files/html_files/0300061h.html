<h2><a name="ch0" id="ch0"></a>Preface</h2>

<p>WHEN this story first appeared, the writer received letters of
two kinds, one asking a question and the other making a statement.
The question was, whether there was any foundation of truth in the
story; the statement challenged him to say that there was. The
letters seemed to show that a large proportion of readers prefer
their dose of fiction with a sweetening of fact. This is written to
furnish that condiment, and to answer the question and the
statement.</p>

<p>In the dog world, the original of the bull-terrier in the story
is known as Edgewood Cold Steel and to his intimates as "Kid." His
father was Lord Minto, a thoroughbred bullterrier, well known in
Canada, but the story of Kid's life is that his mother was a
black-and-tan named Vic. She was a lady of doubtful pedigree. Among
her off spring by Lord Minto, so I have been often informed by many
Canadian dog-fanciers, breeders, and exhibitors, Kid was the only
white puppy in a litter of black-and-tans. He made his first
appearance in the show world in 1900 in Toronto, where, under the
judging of Mr. Charles H. Mason, he was easily first. During that
year, when he came to our kennels, and in the two years following,
he carried off many blue ribbons and cups at nearly every
first-class show in the country. The other dog, "Jimmy Jocks," who
in the book was his friend and mentor, was in real life his friend
and companion, Woodcote Jumbo, or "Jaggers," an aristocratic son of
a long line of English champions. He has gone to that place where
some day all good dogs must go.</p>

<p>In this autobiography I have tried to describe Kid as he really
is, and this year, when he again strives for blue ribbons, I trust,
should the gentle reader see him at any of the bench-shows, he will
give him a friendly pat and make his acquaintance. He will find his
advances met with a polite and gentle courtesy.</p>

<p>THE AUTHOR.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch1" id="ch1"></a>Part 1</h2>

<p>THE Master was walking most unsteady, his legs tripping each
other. After the fifth or sixth round, my legs often go the same
way.</p>

<p>But even when the Master's legs bend and twist a bit, you
mustn't think he can't reach you. Indeed, that is the time he kicks
most frequent. So I kept behind him in the shadow, or ran in the
middle of the street. He stopped at many public houses with
swinging doors, those doors that are cut so high from the sidewalk
that you can look in under them, and see if the Master is inside.
At night, when I peep beneath them, the man at the counter will see
me first and say, "Here's the Kid, Jerry, come to take you home.
Get a move on you." and the Master will stumble out and follow me.
It's lucky for us I'm so white, for, no matter how dark the night,
he can always see me ahead, just out of reach of his boot. At night
the Master certainly does see most amazing. Sometimes he sees two
or four of me, and walks in a circle, so that I have to take him by
the leg of his trousers and lead him into the right road. One
night, when he was very nasty-tempered and I was coaxing him along,
two men passed us, and one of them says "Look at that brute!" and
the other asks, "Which?" and they both laugh. The Master he cursed
them good and proper.</p>

<p class="caption">The master will stumble out and follow me.</p>

<p>But this night, whenever we stopped at a public house, the
Master's pals left it and went on with us to the next. They spoke
quite civil to me, and when the Master tried a flying kick, they
gives him a shove. "Do you want us to lose our money?" says the
pals.</p>

<p>I had had nothing to eat for a day and a night, and just before
we set out the Master gives me a wash under the hydrant. Whenever I
am locked up until all the slop-pans in our alley are empty, and
made to take a bath, and the Master's pals speak civil and feel my
ribs, I know something is going to happen. And that night, when
every time they see a policeman under a lamp-post, they dodged
across the street, and when at the last one of them picked me up
and hid me under his jacket, I began to tremble; f or I knew what
it meant. It meant that I was to fight again for the Master.</p>

<p>I don't fight because I like fighting. I fight because if I
didn't the other dog would find my throat, and the Master would
lose his stakes, and I would be very sorry for him, and ashamed.
Dogs can pass me and I can pass dogs, and I'd never pick a fight
with none of them. When I see two dogs standing on their hind legs
in the streets, clawing each other's ears, and snapping for each
other's windpipes, or howling and swearing and rolling in the mud,
I feel sorry they should act so, and pretend not to notice. If he'd
let me, I'd like to pass the time of day with every dog I meet. But
there's something about me that no nice dog can abide. When I trot
up to nice dogs, nodding and grinning, to make friends, they always
tell me to be off.</p>

<p>"Go to the devil!" they bark at me. "Get out!" And when I walk
away they shout "Mongrel!" and "Gutterdog!" and sometimes, after my
back is turned, they rush me. I could kill most of them with three
shakes, breaking the backbone of the little ones and squeezing the
throat of the big ones. But what's the good? They are nice dogs;
that's why I try to make up to them: and, though it's not for them
to say it, I am a streetdog, and if I try to push into the company
of my betters, I suppose it's their right to teach me my place.</p>

<p>Of course they don't know I'm the best fighting bull-terrier of
my weight in Montreal. That's why it wouldn't be fair for me to
take notice of what they shout. They don't know that if I once
locked my jaws on them I'd carry away whatever I touched. The night
I fought Kelly's White Rat, I wouldn't loosen up until the Master
made a noose in my leash and strangled me; and, as for that Ottawa
dog if the handlers hadn't thrown red pepper down my nose I never
would have let go of him. I don't think the handlers treated me
quite right that time, but maybe they didn't know the Ottawa dog
was dead. I did.</p>

<p>I learned my fighting from my mother when I was very young. We
slept in a lumberyard on the river-front, and by day hunted for
food along the wharves. When we got it, the other tramp-dogs would
try to take it off us, and then it was wonderful to see mother fly
at them and drive them away. All I know of fighting I learned from
mother, watching her picking the ash-heaps for me when I was too
little to fight for myself. No one ever was so good to me as
mother. When it snowed and the ice was in the St. Lawrence, she
used to hunt alone, and bring me back new bones, and she'd sit and
laugh to see me trying to swallow 'em whole. I was just a puppy
then; my teeth was falling out. When I was able to fight we kept
the whole river-range to ourselves, I had the genuine long
"punishing" jaw, so mother said, and there wasn't a man or a dog
that dared worry us. Those were happy days, those were; and we
lived well, share and share alike, and when we wanted a bit of fun,
we chased the fat old wharf-rats! My, how they would squeal!</p>

<p>Then the trouble came. It was no trouble to me. I was too young
to care then. But mother took it so to heart that she grew ailing,
and wouldn't go abroad with me by day. It was the same old scandal
that they're always bringing up against me. I was so young then
that I didn't know. I couldn't see any difference between mother
and other mothers.</p>

<p>But one day a pack of curs we drove off snarled back some new
names at her, and mother dropped her head and ran, just as though
they had whipped us. After that she wouldn't go out with me except
in the dark, and one day she went away and never came back, and,
though I hunted for her in every court and alley and back street of
Montreal, I never found her.</p>

<p>One night, a month after mother ran away, I asked Guardian, the
old blind mastiff, whose Master is the night watchman on our slip,
what it all meant. And he told me.</p>

<p>"Every dog in Montreal knows," he says, "except you; and every
Master knows. So I think it's time you knew."</p>

<p>Then he tells me that my father, who had treated mother so bad,
was a great and noble gentleman from London. "Your father had
twenty two registered ancestors, had your father," old Guardian
says, "and in him was the best bull-terrier blood of England, the
most ancientest, the most royal; the winning 'blue-ribbon' blood,
that breeds champions. He had sleepy pink eyes and thin pink lips,
and he was as white all over as his own white teeth, and under his
white skin you could see his muscles, hard and smooth, like the
links of a steel chain. When your father stood still, and tipped
his nose in the air, it was just as though he was saying, 'Oh, yes,
you common dogs and men, you may well stare. It must be a rare
treat for you colonials to see real English royalty.' He certainly
was pleased with hisself, was your f ather. He looked just as proud
and haughty as one of them stone dogs in Victoria Park-them as is
cut out of white marble. And you're like him," says the old
mastiff-"by that, of course, meaning you're white, same as him.
That's the only likeness. But, you see, the trouble is,
Kid&mdash;well, you see, Kid, the trouble is&mdash;your
mother&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That will do," I said, for then I understood without his
telling me, and I got up and walked away, holding my head and tail
high in the air.</p>

<p>But I was, oh, so miserable, and I wanted to see mother that
very minute, and tell her that I didn't care.</p>

<p>Mother is what I am, a street-dog; there's no royal blood in
mother's veins, nor is she like that father of mine, nor&mdash;and
that's the worst she's not even like me. For while I, when I'm
washed for a fight, am as white as clean snow, she&mdash;and this
is our trouble&mdash;she, my mother, is a black-and-tan.</p>

<p>When mother hid herself from me, I was twelve months old and
able to take care of myself, and as, after mother left me, the
wharves were never the same, I moved uptown and met the Master.
Before he came, lots of other menfolks had tried to make up to me,
and to whistle me home. But they either tried patting me or coaxing
me with a piece of meat; so I didn't take to 'em. But one day the
Master pulled me out of a streetfight by the hind-legs, and kicked
me good.</p>

<p>"You want to fight, do you?" says he. "I'll give you all the
fighting you want!" he says, and he kicks me again. So I knew he
was my Master, and I followed him home. Since that day I've pulled
off many fights for him, and they've brought dogs from all over the
province to have a go at me; but up to that night none, under
thirty pounds, had ever downed me.</p>

<p>But that night, so soon as they carried me into the ring, I saw
the dog was overweight, and that I was no match for him. It was
asking too much of a puppy. The Master should have known I couldn't
do it. Not that I mean to blame the Master, for when sober, which
he sometimes was,&mdash;though not, as you might say, his
habit,&mdash;he was most kind to me, and let me out to find food,
if I could get it, and only kicked me when I didn't pick him up at
night and lead him home.</p>

<p>But kicks will stiffen the muscles, and starving a dog so as to
get him ugly-tempered for a fight may make him nasty, but it's
weakening to his insides, and it causes the legs to wobble.</p>

<p>The ring was in a hall back of a public house. There was a
red-hot whitewashed stove in one corner, and the ring in the other.
I lay in the Master's lap, wrapped in my blanket, and, spite of the
stove, shivering awful; but I always shiver before a fight: I can't
help gettin' excited. While the men-folks were a-flashing their
money and taking their last drink at the bar, a little Irish groom
in gaiters came up to me and give me the back of his hand to smell,
and scratched me behind the cars.</p>

<p>"You poor little pup," says he; "you haven't no show," he says.
"That brute in the tap-room he'll eat your heart out."</p>

<p>"That's what you think," says the Master, snarling. "I'll lay
you a quid the Kid chews him up."</p>

<p>The groom he shook his head, but kept looking at me so
sorry-like that I begun to get a bit sad myself. He seemed like he
couldn't bear to leave off a-patting of me, and he says, speaking
low just like he would to a man-folk, "well, good luck to you,
little pup," which I thought so civil of him that I reached up and
licked his hand. I don't do that to many men. And the Master he
knew I didn't, and took on dreadful.</p>

<p>"What 'ave you got on the back of your hand?" says he, jumping
up.</p>

<p>"Soap!" says the groom, quick as a rat. "That's more than you've
got on yours Do you want to smell of it?" and he sticks his fist
under the Master's nose. But the pals pushed in between 'em.</p>

<p>"He tried to poison the Kid!" shouts the Master.</p>

<p>"Oh, one fight at a time," says the referee. "Get into the ring,
Jerry We're waiting." So we went into the ring.</p>

<p>I never could just remember what did happen in that ring. He
give me no time to spring. He fell on me like a horse. I couldn't
keep my feet against him, and though, as I saw, he could get his
hold when he liked, he wanted to chew me over a bit first. I was
wondering if they'd be able to pry him off me, when, in the third
round, he took his hold; and I begun to drown, just as I did when I
fell into the river off the Red C slip. He closed deeper and deeper
on my throat, and everything went black and red and bursting; and
then, when I was sure I were dead, the handlers pulled him off, and
the Master give me a kick that brought me to. But I couldn't move
none, or even wink, both eyes being shut with lumps.</p>

<p>"He's a cur!" yells the Master, "a sneaking, cowardly cur! He
lost the fight for me," says he, "because he's a &mdash;&mdash;
cowardly cur." And he kicks me again in the lower ribs, so that I
go sliding across the sawdust.</p>

<p>"There's gratitude fer yer," yells the Master. "I've fed that
dog, and nussed that dog and housed him like a prince; and now he
puts his tail between his legs and sells me out, he does. He's a
coward! I've done with him, I am. I'd sell him for a pipeful of
tobacco." He picked me up by the tail, and swung me for the
men-folks to see. "Does any gentleman here want to buy a dog," he
says, "to make into sausage meat?" he says. "That's all he's good
for."</p>

<p><a name="im3"></a>
<p class="cp"><img src="0300061h-images/TheBarSinister-p23.jpg" alt="Illustration" title="Illustration">

<p class="caption">"He's a coward, I've done with him."</p>

<p>Then I heard the little Irish groom say, "I'll give you ten bob
for the dog."</p>

<p>And another voice says, "Ah, don't you do it; the dog's same as
dead&mdash;mebbe he is dead."</p>

<p>"Ten shillings!" says the Master, and his voice sobers a bit;
"make it two pounds and he's yours."</p>

<p>But the pals rushed in again.</p>

<p>"Don't you be a fool, Jerry," they say. "You'll be sorry for
this when you're sober. The Kid's worth a fiver." One of my eyes
was not so swelled up as the other, and as I hung by my tail, I
opened it, and saw one of the pals take the groom by the
shoulder.</p>

<p>"You ought to give 'im five pounds for that dog, mate," he says;
"that's no ordinary dog. That dog's got good blood in him, that dog
has. Why, his father&mdash;that very dog's father&mdash;"</p>

<p>I thought he never would go on. He waited like he wanted to be
sure the groom was listening.</p>

<p>"That very dog's father," says the pal, "is Regent Royal, son of
Champion Regent Monarch, champion bull-terrier of England for four
years."</p>

<p>I was sore, and torn, and chewed most awful, but what the pal
said sounded so fine that I wanted to wag my tail, only couldn't,
owing to my hanging from it.</p>

<p>But the Master calls out: "Yes, his father was Regent Royal;
who's saying he wasn't but the pup's a cowardly cur, that's what
his pup is. And why? I'll tell you why: because his mother was a
black-and-tan street-dog, that's why!"</p>

<p>I don't see how I got the strength, but, someway I threw myself
out of the Master's grip and fell at his feet, and turned over and
fastened all my teeth in his ankle, just across the bone.</p>

<p>When I woke, after the pals had kicked me off him, I was in the
smoking-car of a railroad-train, lying in the lap of the little
groom, and he was rubbing my open wounds with a greasy yellow
stuff, exquisite to the smell and most agreeable to lick off.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch2" id="ch2"></a>Part 2</h2>

<p>"WELL, what's your name&mdash;Nolan? Well, Nolan, these
references are satisfactory," said the young gentleman my new
Master called "Mr. Wyndham, sir"..."I'll take you on as second man.
You can begin to-day."</p>

<p>My new Master shuffled his feet and put his finger to his
forehead. "Thank you, sir," says he. Then he choked like he had
swallowed a fish-bone. "I have a little dawg, sir," says he.</p>

<p>"You can't keep him," says 'Mr. Wyndham, sir,' very short.</p>

<p>"'E's only a puppy, sir," says my new Master; "'e wouldn't go
outside the stables, sir."</p>

<p>"It's not that," says 'Mr. Wyndham, sir.' "I have a large kennel
of very fine dogs; they're the best of their breed in America. I
don't allow strange dogs on the premises."</p>

<p>The Master shakes his head, and motions me with his cap, and I
crept out from behind the door. "I'm sorry, sir," says the Master.
"Then I can't take the place. I can't get along without the dawg,
sir."</p>

<p>'Mr. Wyndham, sir,' looked at me that fierce that I guessed he
was going to whip me, so I turned over on my back and begged with
my legs and tail.</p>

<p>"Why, you beat him!" says 'Mr. Wyndham, sir,' very stern.</p>

<p>"No fear!" the Master says, getting very red. "The party I
bought him off taught him that. He never learnt that from me!" He
picked me up in his arms, and to show 'Mr. Wyndham, sir,' how well
I loved the Master, I bit his chin and hands.</p>

<p>'Mr. Wyndham, sir,' turned over the letters the Master had given
him. "Well, these references certainly are very strong," he says.
"I guess I'll let the dog stay. Only see you keep him away from the
kennels&mdash;or you'll both go."</p>

<p>"Thank you, sir," says the Master, grinning like a cat when
she's safe behind the area railing.</p>

<p>"He's not a bad bull-terrier," says 'Mr. Wyndham, sir,' feeling
my head. "Not that I know much about the smooth-coated breeds. My
dogs are St. Bernards." He stopped patting me and held up my nose.
"What's the matter with his ears?" he says. "They're chewed to
pieces. Is this a fighting dog?" he asks, quick and roughlike.</p>

<p>I could have laughed. If he hadn't been holding my nose, I
certainly would have had a good grin at him. Me the best under
thirty pounds in the Province of Quebec, and him asking if I was a
fighting dog! I ran to the Master and hung down my head
modest-like, waiting for him to tell my list of battles, but the
Master he coughs in his cap most painful. "Fightin'dawg, sir!" he
cries. "Lor' bless you sir, the Kid don't know the word. E's just a
puppy sir, same as you see; a pet dog, so to speak. E's a regular
old lady's lap-dog the Kid is."</p>

<p>"Well, you keep him away from my St. Bernards," says "Mr.
Wyndham, sir," . . . "or they might make a mouthful of him."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir; that they might," says the Master. But when we gets
outside he slaps his knee and laughs inside hisself, and winks at
me most sociable.</p>

<p>The Master's new home was in the country, in a province they
called Long Island. There was a high stone wall about his home with
big iron gates to it, same as Godfrey's brewery; and there was a
house with five red roofs; and the stables, where I lived, was
cleaner than the aerated bakery shop. And then there was the
kennels; but they was like nothing else in this world that ever I
see. For the first days I couldn't sleep of nights for fear some
one would catch me lying in such a cleaned-up place, and would
chase me out of it; and when I did fall to sleep I'd dream I was
back in the old Master's attic, shivering tinder the rusty stove,
which never had no coals in it, with the Master flat on his back on
the cold floor, with his clothes on. And I'd wake up scared and
whimpering, and find myself on the new Master's cot with his hand
on the quilt beside me; and I'd see the glow of the big stove, and
hear the high-quality horses below-stairs stamping in their
straw-lined boxes, and I'd snoop the sweet smell of hay and
harness-soap and go to sleep again.</p>

<p>The stables was my jail, so the Master said, but I don't ask no
better home than that jail.</p>

<p>"Now, Kid," says he, sitting on the top of a bucket upside down,
"you've got to understand this. When I whistle it means you're not
to go out of this 'ere yard. These stables is your jail. If you
leave 'em I'll have to leave 'em too, and over the seas, in the
County Mayo, an old mother will 'ave to leave her bit of a cottage.
For two pounds I must he sending her every month, or she'll have
naught to eat, nor no thatch over 'er head. I can't lose my place,
Kid, so see you don't lose it for me. You must keep away from the
kennels," says he; "they're not for the likes of you. The kennels
are for the quality. I wouldn't take a litter of them woolly dogs
for one wag of your tail, Kid, but for all that they are your
betters, same as the gentry up in the big house are my betters. I
know my place and keep away from the gentry, and you keep away from
the champions."</p>

<p>So I never goes out of the stables. All day I just lay in the
sun on the stone flags, licking my jaws, and watching the grooms
wash down the carriages, and the only care I had was to see they
didn't get gay and turn the hose on me. There wasn't even a single
rat to plague me. Such stables I never did see.</p>

<p>"Nolan," says the head groom, "some day that dog of yours will
give you the slip. You can't keep a street-dog tied up all his
life. It's against his natur'." The head groom is a nice old
gentleman, but he doesn't know everything, just as though I'd been
a street-dog because I liked it! As if I'd rather poke for my
vittles in ash-heaps than have 'em handed me in a wash-basin, and
would sooner bite and fight than be polite and sociable. If I'd had
mother there I couldn't have asked for nothing more. But I'd think
of her snooping in the gutters, or freezing of nights under the
bridges, or, what's worst of all, running through the hot streets
with her tongue down, so wild and crazy for a drink that the people
would shout "mad dog" at her and stone her. Water's so good that I
don't blame the menfolks for locking it up inside their houses: but
when the hot days come, I think they might remember that those are
the dogdays, and leave a little water outside in a trough, like
they do for the horses. Then we wouldn't go mad, and the policemen
wouldn't shoot us. I had so much of everything I wanted that it
made me think a lot of the days when I hadn't nothing, and if I
could have given what I had to mother, as she used to share with
me, I'd have been the happiest dog in the land. Not that I wasn't
happy then, and most grateful to the Master, too, and if I'd only
minded him, the trouble wouldn't have come again.</p>

<p>But one day the coachman says that the little lady they called
Miss Dorothy had come back from school, and that same morning she
runs over to the stables to pat her ponies, and she sees me.</p>

<p>"Oh, what a nice little, white little dog!" said she. "Whose
little dog are you?" says she.</p>

<p>"That's my dog, miss," says the Master. "'Is name is Kid." And I
ran up to her most polite, and licks her fingers, for I never see
so pretty and kind a lady.</p>

<p>"You must come with me and call on my new puppies," says she,
picking me up in her arms and starting off with me.</p>

<p>"Oh, but please, miss," cries Nolan, "Mr. Wyndham give orders
that the Kid's not to go to the kennels!"</p>

<p>"That'll be all right," says the little lady; "they're my
kennels too. And the puppies will like to play with him."</p>

<p>You wouldn't believe me if I was to tell you of the style of
them quality-dogs. If I hadn't seen it myself I wouldn't have
believed it neither. The Viceroy of Canada don't live no better.
There was forty of them, but each one had his own house and a
yard&mdash;most exclusive&mdash;and a cot and a drinking-basin all
to hisself. They had servants standing round waiting to feed 'em
when they was hungry, and valets to wash em; and they had their
hair combed and brushed like the grooms must when they go out on
the box. Even the puppies had overcoats with their names on 'em in
blue letters, and the name of each of those they called champions
was painted up fine over his front door just like it was a public
house or a veterinary's. They were the biggest St. Bernards I ever
did see. I could have walked under them if they'd have let me. But
they were very proud and haughty dogs, and looked only once at me,
and then sniffed in the air. The little lady's own dog was an old
gentleman bull-dog. He'd come along with us, and when he notices
how taken aback I was with all I see, 'e turned quite kind and
affable and showed me about.</p>

<p>"Jimmy Jocks," Miss Dorothy called him, but, owing to his
weight, he walked most dignified and slow, waddling like a duck, as
you might say, and looked much too proud and handsome for such a
silly name.</p>

<p>"That's the runway, and that's the trophy house," says he to me,
"and that over there is the hospital, where you have to go if you
get distemper, and the vet gives you beastly medicine."</p>

<p>"And which of these is your 'ouse, sir?" asks I, wishing to be
respectful. But he looked that hurt and haughty. "I don't live in
the kennels," says he, most contemptuous. "I am a house-dog. I
sleep in Miss Dorothy's room. And at lunch I'm let in with the
family, if the visitors don't mind. They 'most always do, but
they're too polite to say so. Besides," says he, smiling most
condescending, "visitors are always afraid of me. It's because I'm
so ugly," says he. "I suppose," says he, screwing up his wrinkles
and speaking very slow and impressive, "I suppose I'm the ugliest
bulldog in America;" and as he seemed to be so pleased to think
hisself so, I said, "Yes, sir; you certainly are the ugliest ever I
see." At which he nodded his head most approving.</p>

<p class="cp"><img src="0300061h-images/TheBarSinister-p51.jpg" alt="Illustration" title="Illustration">

<p class="caption">"I suppose I'm the ugliest bull-dog in America."</p>

<p>"But I couldn't hurt 'em, as you say," he goes on, though I
hadn't said nothing like that, being too polite. "I'm too old," he
says; "I haven't any teeth. The last time one of those grizzly
bears," said he, glaring at the big St. Bernards, "took a hold of
me, he nearly was my death," says he. I thought his eyes would pop
out of his head, he seemed so wrought up about it. "He rolled me
around in the dirt, he did," says Jimmy Jocks "an' I couldn't get
up. It was low," says Jimmy Jocks making a face like he had a bad
taste in his mouth. "Low, that's what I call it&mdash;bad form, you
understand, young man, not done in my set&mdash;and&mdash;and low."
He growled 'way down in his stomach, and puffed hisself out,
panting and blowing like he had been on a run.</p>

<p>"I'm not a street fighter," he says, scowling at a St. Bernard
marked 'Champion.' "And when my rheumatism is not troubling me," he
says, "I endeavour to be civil to all dogs, so long as they are
gentlemen."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," said I, for even to me he had been most affable.</p>

<p>At this we had come to a little house off by itself, and Jimmy
Jocks invites me in. "This is their trophy room," he says, "where
they keep their prizes. Mine," he says, rather grandlike, "are on
the sideboard." Not knowing what a sideboard might be, I said,
"Indeed, sir, that must be very gratifying." But he only wrinkled
up his chops as much as to say, "It is my right."</p>

<p>The trophy-room was as wonderful as any public house I ever see.
On the walls was pictures of nothing but beautiful St. Bernard
dogs, and rows and rows of blue and red and yellow ribbons; and
when I asked Jimmy Jocks why they was so many more of blue than of
the others, he laughs and says, "Because these kennels always win."
And there was many shining cups on the shelves, which Jimmy Jocks
told me were prizes won by the champions.</p>

<p>"Now, sir, might I ask you, sir," says I, "wot is a
champion?"</p>

<p>At that he panted and breathed so hard I thought he would bust
hisself.</p>

<p>"My dear young friend!" says he, "wherever have you been
educated? A champion is a&mdash;a champion," he says. "He must win
nine blue ribbons in the 'open' class. You follow me that
is&mdash;against all comers. Then he has the title before his name,
and they put his photograph in the sporting papers. You know, of
course, that I am a champion," says he. "I am Champion Woodstock
Wizard III and the two other Woodstock Wizards, my father and
uncle, were both champions."</p>

<p>"But I thought your name was Jimmy Jocks," I said.</p>

<p>He laughs right out at that.</p>

<p>"That's my kennel name, not my registered name," he says. "Why,
certainly you know that every dog has two names. Now, for instance,
what's your registered name and number?" says he.</p>

<p>"I've got only one name," I says, "Just Kid."</p>

<p>Woodstock Wizard puffs at that and wrinkles up his forehead and
pops out his eyes.</p>

<p>"Who are your people?" says he. "Where is your home?" "At the
stable, sir," I said. "My Master is the second groom."</p>

<p>At that Woodstock Wizard III looks at me for quite a bit without
winking, and stares all around the room over my head.</p>

<p>"Oh, well," says he at last, "you're a very civil young dog,"
says he, "and I blame no one for what he can't help." which I
thought most fair and liberal. "And I have known many bull-terriers
that were champions," says he, "though as a rule they mostly run
with fire-engines and to fighting. For me, I wouldn't care to run
through the streets after a hose-cart, nor to fight," says he: "but
each to his taste."</p>

<p>I could not help thinking that if Woodstock Wizard III tried to
follow a fire-engine he would die of apoplexy, and seeing he'd lost
his teeth, it was lucky he had no taste for fighting; but, after
his being so condescending, I didn't say nothing.</p>

<p>"Anyway," says he, "every smooth-coated dog is better than any
hairy old camel like those St. Bernards, and if ever you're hungry
down at the stables, young man, come up to the house and I'll give
you a bone. I can't eat them myself, but I bury them around the
garden from force of habit and in case a friend should drop in. Ah,
I see my mistress coming," he says, "and I bid you good day. I
regret," he says, "that our different social position prevents our
meeting frequent, for you're a worthy young dog with a proper
respect for your betters, and in this country there's precious few
of them have that." Then he waddles off, leaving me alone and very
sad, for he was the first dog in many days that had spoke to me.
But since he showed, seeing that I was a stable-dog, he didn't want
my company, I waited for him to get well away. It was not a
cheerful place to wait, the trophy-house. The pictures of the
champions seemed to scowl at me, and ask what right such as I had
even to admire them, and the blue and gold ribbons and the silver
cups made me very miserable. I had never won no blue ribbons or
silver cups, only stakes for the old Master to spend in the
publics; and I hadn't won them for being a beautiful high-quality
dog, but just for fighting&mdash;which, of course, as Woodstock
Wizard Ill says, is low. So I started for the stables, with my head
down and my tail between my legs, feeling sorry I had ever left the
Master. But I had more reason to be sorry before I got back to
him.</p>

<p>The trophy-house was quite a bit from the kennels, and as I left
it I see Miss Dorothy and Woodstock Wizard Ill walking back toward
them, and, also, that a big St. Bernard, his name was Champion Red
Elfberg, had broke his chain and was running their way. When he
reaches old Jimmy Jocks he lets out a roar like a grain-steamer in
a fog, and he makes three leaps for him. Old Jimmy Jocks was about
a fourth his size; but he plants his feet and curves his back, and
his hair goes up around his neck like a collar. But he never had no
show at no time, for the grizzly bear, as Jimmy Jocks had called
him, lights on old Jimmy's back and tries to break it, and old
Jimmy Jocks snaps his gums and claws the grass, panting and
groaning awful. But he can't do nothing, and the grizzly bear just
rolls him under him, biting and tearing cruel. The odds was all
that Woodstock Wizard III was going to be killed; I had fought
enough to see that: but not knowing the rules of the game among
champions, I didn't like to interfere between two gentlemen who
might be settling a private affair, and, as it were, take it as
presuming of me. So I stood by, though I was shaking terrible, and
holding myself in like I was on a leash. But at that Woodstock
Wizard III, who was underneath, sees me through the dust, and calls
very faint, "Help, you!" he says. "Take him in the hind-leg," he
says. "He's murdering me," he says. And then the little Miss
Dorothy, who was crying, and calling to the kennel-men, catches at
the Red Elfberg's hind-legs to pull him off, and the brute, keeping
his front pats well in Jimmy's stomach, turns his big head and
snaps at her. So that was all I asked for, thank you. I went up
under him. It was really nothing. He stood so high that I had only
to take off about three feet from him and come in from the side,
and my long "punishing jaw," as mother was always talking about,
locked on his woolly throat, and my back teeth met. I couldn't
shake him, but I shook myself, and every time I shook myself there
was thirty pounds of weight tore at his windpipes.

<p class="cp"><img src="0300061h-images/TheBarSinister-p54.jpg" alt="Illustration" title="Illustration">

<p class="caption">"My long "punishing jaw"...locked on his woolly throat.</p>

<p>I couldn't see
nothing for his long hair, but I heard Jimmy Jocks puffing and
blowing on one side, and munching the brute's leg with his old
gums. Jimmy was an old sport that day, was Jimmy, or Woodstock
Wizard III, as I should say. When the Red Elfberg was out and down
I had to run, or those kennel-men would have had my life. They
chased me right into the stables; and from under the hay I watched
the head groom take down a carriagewhip and order them to the right
about. Luckily Master and the young grooms were out, or that day
there'd have been fighting for everybody.</p>

<p>Well, it nearly did for me and the Master. 'Mr. Wyndham, sir'
comes raging to the stables. I'd half killed his best prize-winner,
he says, and had oughter be shot, and he gives the Master his
notice. But Miss Dorothy she follows him, and says it was his Red
Elfberg what began the fight, and that I'd saved Jimmy's life, and
that old Jimmy Jocks was worth more to her than all the St.
Bernards in the Swiss mountains-wherever they may be. And that I
was her champion, anyway. Then she cried over me most beautiful,
and over Jimmy Jocks, too, who was that tied up in bandages he
couldn't even waddle. So when he heard that side of it, 'Mr.
Wyndham, sir,' told us that if Nolan put me on a chain we could
stay. So it came out all right for everybody but me. I was glad the
Master kept his place, but I'd never worn a chain before, and it
disheartened me. But that was the least of it. For the quality-dogs
couldn't forgive my whipping their champion, and they came to the
fence between the kennels and the stables, and laughed through the
bars, barking most cruel words at me. I couldn't understand how
they found it out, but they knew. After the fight Jimmy Jocks was
most condescending to me, and he said the grooms had boasted to the
kennel-men that I was a son of Regent Royal, and that when the
kennelmen asked who was my mother they had had to tell them that
too. Perhaps that was the way of it, but, however, the scandal got
out, and every one of the quality-dogs knew that I was a street-dog
and the son of a black-and-tan.</p>

<p>"These misalliances will occur," said Jimmy Jocks, in his
old-fashioned way; "but no well-bred dog," says he, looking most
scornful at the St. Bernards, who were howling behind the palings,
"would refer to your misfortune before you, certainly not cast it
in your face. I myself remember your father's father, when he made
his debut at the Crystal Palace. He took four blue ribbons and
three specials."</p>

<p>But no sooner than Jimmy would leave me the St. Bernards would
take to howling again, insulting mother and insulting me. And when
I tore at my chain, they, seeing they were safe, would howl the
more. It was never the same after that; the laughs and the jeers
cut into my heart, and the chain bore heavy on my spirit. I was so
sad that sometimes I wished I was back in the gutter again, where
no one was better than me, and some nights I wished I was dead. If
it hadn't been for the Master being so kind, and that it would have
looked like I was blaming mother, I would have twisted my leash and
hanged myself.</p>

<p>About a month after my fight, the word was passed through the
kennels that the New York Show was coming, and such goings on as
followed I never did see. If each of them had been matched to fight
for a thousand pounds and the gate, they couldn't have trained more
conscientious. But perhaps that's just my envy. The kennel-men
rubbed 'em and scrubbed 'em, and trims their hair and curls and
combs it, and some dogs they fatted and some they starved. No one
talked of nothing but the Show, and the chances "our kennels" had
against the other kennels, and if this one of our champions would
win over that one, and whether them as hoped to be champions had
better show in the "open" or the "limit" class, and whether this
dog would beat his own dad, or whether his little puppy sister
couldn't beat the two of 'em. Even the grooms had their money up,
and day or night you heard nothing but praises of "our" dogs, until
I, being so far out of it, couldn't have felt meaner if I had been
running the streets with a can to my tail. I knew shows were not
for such as me, and so all day I lay stretched at the end of my
chain, pretending I was asleep, and only too glad that they had
something so important to think of that they could leave me
alone.</p>

<p>But one day, before the Show opened, Miss Dorothy came to the
stables with 'Mr. Wyndham, sir,' and seeing me chained up and so
miserable, she takes me in her arms.</p>

<p>"You poor little tyke!" says she. "It's cruel to tie him up so;
he's eating his heart out, Nolan," she says. "I don't know nothing
about bull-terriers," says she, "but I think Kid's got good
points," says she, "and you ought to show him. Jimmy Jocks has
three legs on the Rensselaer Cup now, and I'm going to show him
this time, so that he can get the fourth; and, if you wish, I'll
enter your dog too. How would you like that, Kid?" says she. "How
would you like to see the most beautiful dogs in the world? Maybe
you'd meet a pal or two," says she. "It would cheer you up,
wouldn't it, Kid?" says she. But I was so upset I could only wag my
tail most violent. "He says it would!" says she, though, being that
excited, I hadn't said nothing.</p>

<p>So 'Mr. Wyndham, sir,' laughs, and takes out a piece of blue
paper and sits down at the head groom's table.</p>

<p>"What's the name of the father of your dog, Nolan?" says he. And
Nolan says: "The man I got him off told me he was a son of Champion
Regent Royal, sir. But it don't seem likely, does it?" says
Nolan.</p>

<p>"It does not!" says 'Mr. Wyndham, sir,' short-like.</p>

<p>"Aren't you sure, Nolan?" says Miss Dorothy.</p>

<p>"No, miss," says the Master.</p>

<p>"Sire unknown," says 'Mr. Wyndham, sir,' and writes it down.</p>

<p>"Date of birth?" asks "Mr. Wyndham, sir."</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I&mdash;unknown, sir," says Nolan. And 'Mr. Wyndham,
sir,' writes it down.</p>

<p>"Breeder?" says "Mr. Wyndham, sir."</p>

<p>"Unknown," says Nolan, getting very red around the jaws, and I
drops my head and tail. And 'Mr. Wyndham, sir,' writes that
down.</p>

<p>"Mother's name?" says 'Mr. Wyndham, sir.'</p>

<p>"She was a-unknown," says the Master. And I licks his hand.</p>

<p>"Dam unknown," says 'Mr. Wyndham, sir,' and writes it down. Then
he takes the paper and reads out loud: "'Sire unknown, dam unknown,
breeder unknown, date of birth unknown.' You'd better call him the
'Great Unknown'," says he. "Who's paying his entrance fee?"</p>

<p>"I am," says Miss Dorothy.</p>

<p>Two weeks after we all got on a train for New York, Jimmy Jocks
and me following Nolan in the smoking-car, and twenty-two of the
St. Bernards in boxes and crates and on chains and leashes. Such a
barking and howling I never did hear; and when they sees me going,
too, they laughs fit to kill.</p>

<p>"Wot is this-a circus?" says the railroad man.</p>

<p>But I had no heart in it. I hated to go. I knew I was no "show"
dog, even though Miss Dorothy and the Master did their best to keep
me from sharing them. For before we set out Miss Dorothy brings a
man from town who scrubbed and rubbed me, and sandpapered my tail,
which hurt most awful, and shaved my ears with the Master's razor,
so you could 'most see clear through 'em, and sprinkles me over
with pipeclay, till I shines like a Tommy's cross-belts.</p>

<p>"Upon my word!" says Jimmy Jocks when he first sees me. "Wot a
swell you are! You're the image of your grand-dad when he made his
debut at the Crystal Palace. He took four firsts and three
specials." But I knew he was only trying to throw heart into me.
They might scrub, and they might rub, and they might pipe-clay, but
they couldn't pipe-clay the insides of me, and they was
black-and-tan.</p>

<p>Then we came to a garden, which it was not, but the biggest hall
in the world. Inside there was lines of benches a few miles long,
and on them sat every dog in America. If all the dog-snatchers in
Montreal had worked night and day for a year, they couldn't have
caught so many dogs. And they was all shouting and barking and
howling so vicious that my heart stopped beating. For at first I
thought they was all enraged at my presuming to intrude. But after
I got in my place they kept at it just the same, barking at every
dog as he came in: daring him to fight, and ordering him out, and
asking him what breed of dog he thought he was, anyway. Jimmy Jocks
was chained just behind me, and he said he never see so fine a
show. "That's a hot class you're in, my lad," he says, looking over
into my street, where there were thirty bull-terriers. They was all
as white as cream, and each so beautiful that if I could have broke
my chain I would have run all the way home and hid myself under the
horse-trough.</p>

<p>All night long they talked and sang, and passed greetings with
old pals, and the homesick puppies howled dismal. Them that
couldn't sleep wouldn't let no others sleep, and all the electric
lights burned in the roof, and in my eyes. I could hear Jimmy Jocks
snoring peaceful, but I could only doze by jerks, and when I dozed
I dreamed horrible. All the dogs in the hall seemed coming at me
for daring to intrude, with their jaws red and open, and their eyes
blazing like the lights in the roof. "You're a street-dog! Get out,
you street-dog!" they yells. And as they drives me out, the
pipe-clay drops off me, and they laugh and shriek; and when I looks
down I see that I have turned into a black-and-tan.</p>

<p>They was most awful dreams, and next morning, when Miss Dorothy
comes and gives me water in a pan, I begs and begs her to take me
home; but she can't understand. "How well Kid is!" she says. And
when I jumps into the Master's arms and pulls to break my chain, he
says, "If he knew all as he had against him, miss, he wouldn't be
so gay." And from a book they reads out the names of the beautiful
highbred terriers which I have got to meet. And I can't make 'em
understand that I only want to run away and hide myself where no
one will see me.</p>

<p><a name="im6"></a>
<p class="cp"><img src="0300061h-images/TheBarSinister-p70.jpg" alt="Illustration" title="Illustration">

<p class="caption">"How well Kid is!" she says.</p>

<p>Then suddenly men comes hurrying down our street and begins to
brush the beautiful bull-terriers; and the Master rubs me with a
towel so excited that his hands trembles awful, and Miss Dorothy
tweaks my cars between her gloves, so that the blood runs to 'em,
and they turn pink and stand up straight and sharp.</p>

<p>"Now, then, Nolan," says she, her voice shaking just like his
fingers, "keep his head up-and never let the judge lose sight of
him." When I hears that my legs breaks under me, for I knows all
about judges. Twice the old Master goes up before the judge for
fighting me with other dogs, and the judge promises him if he ever
does it again he'll chain him up in jail. I knew he'd find me out.
A judge can't be fooled by no pipe-clay. He can see right through
you, and he reads your insides.</p>

<p>The judging-ring, which is where the judge holds out, was so
like a fighting-pit that when I come in it, and find six other dogs
there, I springs into position, so that when they lets us go I can
defend myself. But the Master smooths down my hair and whispers,
"Hold 'ard, Kid, hold 'ard. This ain't a fight," says he. "Look
your prettiest," he whispers. "Please, Kid, look your prettiest;"
and he pulls my leash so tight that I can't touch my pats to the
sawdust, and my nose goes up in the air. There was millions of
people a-watching us from the railings, and three of our
kennel-men, too, making fun of the Master and me, and Miss Dorothy
with her chin just reaching to the rail, and her eyes so big that I
thought she was a-going to cry. It was awful to think that when the
judge stood up and exposed me, all those people, and Miss Dorothy,
would be there to see me driven from the Show.</p>

<p>The judge he was, a fierce-looking man with specs on his nose,
and a red beard. When I first come in he didn't see me, owing to my
being too quick for him and dodging behind the Master. But when the
Master drags me round and I pulls at the sawdust to keep back, the
judge looks at us careless-like, and then stops and glares through
his specs, and I knew it was all up with me.</p>

<p>"Are there any more?" asks the judge to the gentleman at the
gate, but never taking his specs from me.</p>

<p>The man at the gate looks in his book. "Seven in the novice
class," says he. "They're all here. You can go ahead," and he shuts
the gate.</p>

<p>The judge he doesn't hesitate a moment. He just waves his hand
toward the corner of the ring. "Take him away," he says to the
Master, "over there, and keep him away;" and he turns and looks
most solemn at the six beautiful bullterriers. I don't know how I
crawled to that corner. I wanted to scratch under the sawdust and
dig myself a grave. The kennel-men they slapped the rail with their
hands and laughed at the Master like they would fall over. They
pointed at me in the corner, and their sides just shaked. But
little Miss Dorothy she presses her lips tight against the rail,
and I see tears rolling from her eyes. The Master he hangs his head
like he had been whipped. I felt most sorry for him than all. He
was so red, and he was letting on not to see the kennel-men, and
blinking his eyes. If the judge had ordered me right out it
wouldn't have disgraced us so, but it was keeping me there while he
was judging the highbred dogs that hurt so hard. With all those
people staring, too. And his doing it so quick, without no doubt
nor questions. You can't fool the judges. They see inside you.</p>

<p>But he couldn't make up his mind about them high-bred dogs. He
scowls at 'em, and he glares at 'em, first with his head on the one
side and then on the other. And he feels of 'em, and orders 'em to
run about. And Nolan leans against the rails, with his head hung
down, and pats me. And Miss Dorothy comes over beside him, but
don't say nothing, only wipes her eye with her finger. A man on the
other side of the rail he says to the Master, "The judge don't like
your dog?"</p>

<p>"No," says the Master.</p>

<p>"Have you ever shown him before?" says the man.</p>

<p>"No," says the Master, "and I'll never show him again. He's my
dog," says the Master, "and he suits me! And I don't care what no
judges think." And when he says them kind words, I licks his hand
most grateful.</p>

<p>The judge had two of the six dogs on a little platform in the
middle of the ring, and he had chased the four other dogs into the
corners, where they was licking their chops, and letting on they
didn't care, same as Nolan was.</p>

<p>The two dogs on the platform was so beautiful that the judge
hisself couldn't tell which was the best of 'em, even when he
stoops down and holds their heads together. But at last he gives a
sigh, and brushes the sawdust off his knees, and goes to the table
in the ring, where there was a man keeping score, and heaps and
heaps of blue and gold and red and yellow ribbons. And the judge
picks up a bunch of 'em and walks to the two gentlemen who was
holding the beautiful dogs, and he says to each, "What's his
number?" and he hands each gentleman a ribbon. And then he turned
sharp and comes straight at the Master.</p>

<p>"What's his number?" says the judge. And Master was so scared
that he couldn't make no answer.</p>

<p>But Miss Dorothy claps her hands and cries out like she was
laughing, "Three twenty-six," and the judge writes it down and
shoves Master the blue ribbon.</p>

<p>I bit the Master, and I jumps and bit Miss Dorothy, and I
waggled so hard that the Master couldn't hold me. When I get to the
gate Miss Dorothy snatches me up and kisses me between the ears,
right before millions of people, and they both hold me so tight
that I didn't know which of them was carrying of me. But one thing
I knew, for I listened hard, as it was the judge hisself as said
it.</p>

<p>"Did you see that puppy I gave first to?" says the judge to the
gentleman at the gate.</p>

<p>"I did. He was a bit out of his class," says the gate
gentleman.</p>

<p>"He certainly was!" says the judge, and they both laughed.</p>

<p>But I didn't care. They couldn't hurt me then, not with Nolan
holding the blue ribbon and Miss Dorothy hugging my ears, and the
kennel-men sneaking away, each looking like he'd been caught with
his nose under the lid of the slop can.</p>

<p>We sat down together, and we all three just talked as fast as we
could. They was so pleased that I couldn't help feeling proud
myself, and I barked and leaped about so gay that all the
bull-terriers in our street stretched on their chains and howled at
me.</p>

<p>"Just look at him!" says one of those I had beat. "What's he
giving hisself airs about?"</p>

<p>"Because he's got one blue ribbon!" says another of 'em. "Why,
when I was a puppy I used to eat 'em, and if that judge could ever
learn to know a toy from a mastiff, I'd have had this one."</p>

<p>But Jimmy Jocks he leaned over from his bench and says, "Well
done, Kid. Didn't I tell you so?" What he 'ad told me was that I
might get a "commended," but I didn't remind him.</p>

<p>"Didn't I tell you," says Jimmy Jocks, "that I saw your
grandfather make his debut at the Crystal?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, you did, sir," says I, for I have no love for the men
of my family.</p>

<p>A gentleman with a showing-leash around his neck comes up just
then and looks at me very critical. "Nice dog you've got, Miss
Wyndham," says he; "would you care to sell him?"</p>

<p>"He's not my dog," says Miss Dorothy, holding me tight. "I wish
he were."</p>

<p>"He's not for sale, sir," says the Master, and I was that
glad.</p>

<p>"Oh, he's yours, is he?" says the gentleman, looking hard at
Nolan. "Well, I'll give you a hundred dollars for him," says he,
careless-like.</p>

<p>"Thank you, sir; he's not for sale," says Nolan, but his eyes
get very big. The gentleman he walked away; but I watches him, and
he talks to a man in a golf-cap, and by and by the man comes along
our street, looking at all the dogs, and stops in front of me.</p>

<p>"This your dog?" says he to Nolan. "Pity he's so leggy," says
he. "If he had a good tail, and a longer stop, and his ears were
set higher, he'd be a good dog. As he is, I'll give you fifty
dollars for him."</p>

<p>But, before the Master could speak, Miss Dorothy laughs and
says: "You're Mr. Polk's kennel-man, I believe. Well, you tell Mr.
Polk from me that the dog's not for sale now any more than he was
five minutes ago, and that when he is, he'll have to bid against me
for him."</p>

<p>The man looks foolish at that, but he turns to Nolan quick-like.
"I'll give you three hundred for him," he says.</p>

<p>"Oh, indeed!" whispers Miss Dorothy, like she was talking to
herself. "That's it, is it?" And she turns and looks at me just as
though she had never seen me before. Nolan he was a-gaping, too,
with his mouth open. But he holds me tight.</p>

<p>"He's not for sale," he growls, like he was frightened; and the
man looks black and walks away.</p>

<p>"Why, Nolan!" cries Miss Dorothy, "Mr. Polk knows more about
bull-terriers than any amateur in America. What can he mean? Why,
Kid is no more than a puppy! Three hundred dollars for a
puppy!"</p>

<p>"And he ain't no thoroughbred, neither!" cries the Master. "He's
'Unknown,' ain't he? Kid can't help it, of course, but his mother,
miss-"</p>

<p>I dropped my head. I couldn't bear he should tell Miss Dorothy.
I couldn't bear she should know I had stolen my blue ribbon.</p>

<p>But the Master never told, for at that a gentleman runs up,
calling, "Three twenty-six, three twentysix!" And Miss Dorothy
says, "Here he is; what is it?"</p>

<p>"The Winners' class," says the gentleman. "Hurry, please; the
judge is waiting for him."</p>

<p>Nolan tries to get me off the chain on to a showing-leash, but
he shakes so, he only chokes me. "What is it, miss?" he says. "What
is it?"</p>

<p>"The Winners' class," says Miss Dorothy. "The judge wants him
with the winners of the other classes&mdash;to decide which is the
best. It's only a form," says she. "He has the champions against
him now."</p>

<p>"Yes," says the gentleman, as he hurries us to the ring. "I'm
afraid it's only a form for your dog, but the judge wants all the
winners, puppy class even."</p>

<p>We had got to the gate, and the gentleman there was writing down
my number.</p>

<p>"Who won the open?" asks Miss Dorothy.</p>

<p>"Oh, who would?" laughs the gentleman. "The old champion, of
course. He's won for three years now. There he is. Isn't he
wonderful?" says he; and he points to a dog that's standing proud
and haughty on the platform in the middle of the ring.</p>

<p>I never see so beautiful a dog-so fine and clean and noble, so
white like he had rolled hisself in flour, holding his nose up and
his eyes shut, same as though no one was worth looking at. Aside of
him we other dogs, even though we had a blue ribbon apiece, seemed
like lumps of mud. He was a royal gentleman, a king, he was. His
master didn't have to hold his head with no leash. He held it
hisself, standing as still as an iron dog on a lawn, like he knew
all the people was looking at him. And so they was, and no one
around the ring pointed at no other dog but him.</p>

<p>"Oh, what a picture!" cried Miss Dorothy. "He's like a marble
figure by a great artist&mdash;one who loved dogs. Who is he?" says
she, looking in her book. "I don't keep up with terriers."</p>

<p>"Oh, you know him," says the gentleman. "He is the champion of
champions, Regent Royal."</p>

<p>The Master's face went red.</p>

<p>"And this is Regent Royal's son," cries he, and he pulls me
quick into the ring, and plants me on the platform next my
father.</p>

<p>I trembled so that I near fell. My legs twisted like a leash.
But my father he never looked at me. He only smiled the same sleepy
smile, and he still kept his eyes half shut, like as no one, no,
not even his own son, was worth his lookin' at.</p>

<p>The judge he didn't let me stay beside my father, but, one by
one, he placed the other dogs next to him and measured and felt and
pulled at them. And each one he put down, but he never put my
father down. And then he comes over and picks up me and sets me
back on the platf orm, shoulder to shoulder with the Champion
Regent Royal, and goes down on his knees, and looks into our
eyes.</p>

<p>The gentleman with my f ather he laughs, and says to the judge,
"Thinking of keeping us here all day, John?" But the judge he
doesn't hear him, and goes behind us and runs his hand down my
side, and holds back my cars, and takes my jaws between his
fingers. The crowd around the ring is very deep now, and nobody
says nothing. The gentleman at the score-table, he is leaning
forward, with his elbows on his knees and his eyes very wide, and
the gentleman at the gate is whispering quick to Miss Dorothy, who
has turned white. I stood as stiff as stone. I didn't even breathe.
But out of the corner of my eye I could see my father licking his
pink chops, and yawning just a little, like he was bored.</p>

<p>The judge he had stopped looking fierce and was looking solemn,
Something inside him seemed a-troubling him awful. The more he
stares at us now, the more solemn he gets, and when he touches us
he does it gentle, like he was patting us. For a long time he
kneels in the sawdust, looking at my father and at me, and no one
around the ring says nothing to nobody. Then the judge takes a
breath and touches me sudden. "It's his," he says. But he lays his
hand just as quick on my father. "I'm sorry," says he.</p>

<p class="caption">For a long time he kneels in the sawdust.</p>

<p>The gentleman holding my father cries:</p>

<p>"Do you mean to tell me-"</p>

<p>And the judge he answers, "I mean the other is the better dog."
He takes my father's head between his hands and looks down at him
most sorrowful. "The king is dead," says he. "Long live the king!
Goodbye, Regent," he says.</p>

<p>The crowd around the railings clapped their hands, and some
laughed scornful, and every one talks fast, and I start for the
gate, so dizzy that I can't see my way. But my f ather pushes in
front of me, walking very daintily, and smiling sleepy, same as he
had just been waked, with his head high and his eyes shut, looking
at nobody.</p>

<p>So that is how I "came by my inheritance," as Miss Dorothy calls
it; and just for that, though I couldn't feel where I was any
different, the crowd follows me to my bench, and pats me, and coos
at me, like I was a baby in a babycarriage. And the handlers have
to hold 'em back so that the gentlemen from the papers can make
pictures of me, and Nolan walks me up and down so proud, and the
men shake their heads and says, "He certainly is the true type, he
is!" And the pretty ladies ask Miss Dorothy, who sits beside me
letting me lick her gloves to show the crowd what friends we is,
"Aren't you afraid he'll bite you?" And Jimmy Jocks calls to me,
"Didn't I tell you so? I always knew you were one of us. Blood will
out, Kid; blood will out. I saw your grandfather," says he, "make
his debut at the Crystal Palace. But he was never the dog you
are!"</p>

<p>After that, if I could have asked for it, there was nothing I
couldn't get. You might have thought I was a snow-dog, and they was
afeard I'd melt. If I wet my pats, Nolan gave me a hot bath and
chained me to the stove; if I couldn't eat my food, being stuffed
full by the cook,&mdash;for I am a house-dog now, and let in to
lunch, whether there is visitors or not,&mdash;Nolan would run to
bring the vet. It was all tommy rot, as Jimmy says, but meant most
kind. I couldn't scratch myself comfortable, without Nolan giving
me nasty drinks, and rubbing me outside till it burnt awful; and I
wasn't let to eat bones f or fear of spoiling my "beautiful" mouth,
what mother used to call my "punishing jaw;" and my food was cooked
special on a gas-stove; and Miss Dorothy gives me an overcoat, cut
very stylish like the champions', to wear when we goes out
carriage-driving.</p>

<p>After the next Show where I takes three blue ribbons, four
silver cups, two medals, and brings home forty five dollars for
Nolan, they gives me a "registered" name, same as Jimmy's. Miss
Dorothy wanted to call me "Regent Heir Apparent;" but I was that
glad when Nolan says, "No; Kid don't owe nothing to his father,
only to you and hisself. So, if you please, miss, we'll call him
Wyndham Kid." And so they did, and you can see it on my overcoat in
blue letters, and painted top of my kennel. It was all too hard to
understand. For days I just sat and wondered if I was really me,
and how it all come about, and why everybody was so kind. But oh,
it was so good they was, for if they hadn't been I'd never have got
the thing I most wished after. But, because they was kind, and not
liking to deny me nothing, they gave it me, and it was more to me
than anything in the world.</p>

<p>It came about one day when we was out driving. We was in the
cart they calls the dog-cart because it's the one Miss Dorothy
keeps to take Jimmy and me for an airing. Nolan was up behind, and
me, in my new overcoat, was sitting beside Miss Dorothy. I was
admiring the view, and thinking how good it was to have a horse
pull you about so that you needn't get yourself splashed and have
to be washed, when I hears a dog calling loud for help, and I
pricks up my ears and looks over the horse's head. And I sees
something that makes me tremble down to my toes. In the road before
us three big dogs was chasing a little old lady-dog. She had a
string to her tail, where some boys had tied a can, and she was
dirty with mud and ashes, and torn most awful. She was too far done
up to get away, and too old to help herself, but she was making a
fight for her life, snapping her old gums savage, and dying game.
All this I see in a wink, and then the three dogs pinned her down,
and I can't stand it no longer, and clears the wheel and lands in
the road on my head. It was my stylish overcoat done that, and I
cursed it proper, but I gets my pats again quick, and makes a rush
for the fighting. Behind me I hear Miss Dorothy cry: "They'll kill
that old dog. Wait, take my whip. Beat them off her! The Kid can
take care of himself;" and I hear Nolan fall into the road, and the
horse come to a stop. The old lady-dog was down, and the three was
eating her vicious; but as I come up, scattering the pebbles, she
hears, and thinking it's one more of them, she lifts her head, and
my heart breaks open like some one had sunk his teeth in it. For,
under the ashes arid the dirt and the blood, I can see who it is,
and I know that my mother has come back to me.</p>

<p>I gives a yell that throws them three dogs off their legs.</p>

<p>"Mother!" I cries. "I'm the Kid," I cries. "I'm coming to you.
Mother, I'm coming!"</p>

<p>And I shoots over her at the throat of the big dog, and the
other two they sinks their teeth into that stylish overcoat and
tears it off me, and that sets me free, and I lets them have it. I
never had so fine a fight as that! What with mother being there to
see, and not having been let to mix up in no fights since I become
a prizewinner, it just naturally did me good, and it wasn't three
shakes before I had 'em yelping. Quick as a wink, mother she jumps
into help me, and I just laughed to see her. It was so like old
times. And Nolan he made me laugh, too. He was like a hen on a
bank, shaking the butt of his whip, but not daring to cut in for
fear of hitting me.</p>

<p>"Stop it, Kid," he says, "stop it. Do you want to be all torn
up?" says he. "Think of the Boston show," says he. "Think of
Chicago. Think of Danbury. Don't you never want to be a
champion?"</p>

<p>How was I to think of all them places when I had three dogs to
cut up at the same time? But in a minute two of 'em begs for mercy,
and mother and me lets 'em run away. The big one he ain't able to
run away. Then mother and me we dances and jumps, and barks and
laughs, and bites each other and rolls each other in the road.
There never was two dogs so happy as we. And Nolan he whistles and
calls and begs me to come to him; but I just laugh and play larks
with mother.</p>

<p>"Now, you come with me," says I, "to my new home, and never try
to run away again." And I shows her our house with the five red
roofs, set on the top of the hill. But mother trembles awful, and
says: "They'd never let me in such a place. Does the Viceroy live
there, Kid?" says she. And I laugh at her. "No; I do," I says. "And
if they won't let you live there, too, you and me will go back to
the streets together, for we must never be parted no more. So we
trots up the hill side by side, with Nolan trying to catch me, and
Miss Dorothy laughing at him from the cart.</p>

<p>"The Kid's made friends with the poor old dog," says she. "Maybe
he knew her long ago when he ran the streets himself. Put her in
here beside me, and see if he doesn't follow."</p>

<p>So when I hears that I tells mother to go with Nolan and sit in
the cart; but she says no-that she'd soil the pretty lady's frock;
but I tells her to do as I say, and so Nolan lifts her, trembling
still, into the cart, and I runs alongside, barking joyful.</p>

<p>When we drives into the stables I takes mother to my kennel, and
tells her to go inside it and make herself at home. "Oh, but he
won't let me!" says she.</p>

<p>"Who won't let you?" says I, keeping my eye on Nolan, and
growling a bit nasty, just to show I was meaning to have my
way.</p>

<p>"Why, Wyndham Kid," says she, looking up at the name on my
kennel.</p>

<p>"But I'm Wyndham Kid!" says I. "You!" cries mother. "You! Is my
little Kid the great Wyndham Kid the dogs all talk about?" And at
that, she being very old, and sick, and nervous, as mothers are,
just drops down in the straw and weeps bitter.</p>

<p>Well, there ain't much more than that to tell. Miss Dorothy she
settled it.</p>

<p>"If the Kid wants the poor old thing in the stables," says she,
"let her stay."</p>

<p>"You see," says she, "she's a black-and-tan, and his mother was
a black-and-tan, and maybe that's what makes Kid feel so friendly
toward her," says she.</p>

<p>"Indeed, for me," says Nolan, "she can have the best there is.
I'd never drive out no dog that asks for a crust nor a shelter," he
says. "But what will Mr. Wyndham do?"</p>

<p>"He'll do what I say," says Miss Dorothy, "and if I say she's to
stay, she will stay, and I say-she's to stay!"</p>

<p>And so mother and Nolan and me found a home. Mother was scared
at first&mdash;not being used to kind people; but she was so gentle
and loving that the grooms got fonder of her than of me, and tried
to make me jealous by patting of her and giving her the pick of the
vittles. But that was the wrong way to hurt my feelings. That's
all, I think. Mother is so happy here that I tell her we ought to
call it the Happy Hunting Grounds, because no one hunts you, and
there is nothing to hunt; it just all comes to you. And so we live
in peace, mother sleeping all day in the sun, or behind the stove
in the head groom's office, being fed twice a day regular by Nolan,
and all the day by the other grooms most irregular. And as for me,
I go hurrying around the country to the benchshows, winning money
and cups for Nolan, and taking the blue ribbons away from
father.</p>
