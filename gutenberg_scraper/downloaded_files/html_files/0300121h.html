</center>

<p> </p>

<p>Though this play of The Millionairess does not pretend to be
anything more than a comedy of humorous and curious contemporary
characters, such as Ben Jonson might write were he alive now, yet it
raises a question that has troubled human life and moulded human
society since the creation.</p>

<p>The law is equal before all of us; but we are not all equal before
the law. Virtually there is one law for the rich and another for the
poor, one law for the cunning and another for the simple, one law for
the forceful and another for the feeble, one law for the ignorant and
another for the learned, one law for the brave and another for the
timid, and within family limits one law for the parent and no law at
all for the child.</p>

<p>In the humblest cabin that contains a family you may find a
<i>ma&icirc;tresse femme</i> who rules in the household by a sort of
divine right. She may rule amiably by being able to think more
quickly and see further than the others, or she may be a tyrant
ruling violently by intensity of will and ruthless egotism. She may
be a grandmother and she may be a girl. But the others find they are
unable to resist her. Often of course the domestic tyrant is a man;
but the phenomenon is not so remarkable in his case, as he is by
convention the master and lawgiver of the hearthstone.</p>

<p>In every business street you will find a shopkeeper who is always
in difficulties and ends his business adventures in the bankruptcy
court. Hard by you will find another shopkeeper, with no greater
advantages to start with, or possibly less, who makes larger and
larger profits, and inspires more and more confidence in his banker,
until he ends as the millionaire head of a giant multiple shop.</p>

<p>How does the captain of a pirate ship obtain his position and
maintain his authority over a crew of scoundrels who are all, like
himself, outside the law? How does an obscure village priest, the son
of humble fisherfolk, come to wear the triple crown and sit in the
papal chair? How do common soldiers become Kings, Shahs, and
Dictators? Why does a hereditary peer find that he is a nonentity in
a grand house organized and ruled by his butler?</p>

<p>Questions like these force themselves on us so continually and
ruthlessly that many turn in despair from Socialism and political
reform on the ground that to abolish all the institutional tyrannies
would only deliver the country helplessly into the hands of the born
bosses. A king, a prelate, a squire, a capitalist, a justice of the
peace may be a good kind Christian soul, owing his position, as most
of us do, to being the son of his father; but a born boss is one who
rides roughshod over us by some mysterious power that separates him
from our species and makes us fear him: that is, hate him.</p>

<p>What is to be done with that section of the possessors of specific
talents whose talent is for moneymaking? History and daily experience
teach us that if the world does not devise some plan of ruling them,
they will rule the world. Now it is not desirable that they should
rule the world; for the secret of moneymaking is to care for nothing
else and to work at nothing else; and as the world's welfare depends
on operations by which no individual can make money, whilst its ruin
by war and drink and disease and drugs and debauchery is enormously
profitable to moneymakers, the supremacy of the moneymaker is the
destruction of the State. A society which depends on the incentive of
private profit is doomed.</p>

<p>And what about ambitious people who possess commanding business
ability or military genius or both? They are irresistible unless they
are restrained by law; for ordinary individuals are helpless in their
hands. Are they to be the masters of society or its servants?</p>

<p>What should the nineteenth century have done in its youth with
Rothschild and Napoleon? What is the United States to do with its
money kings and bosses? What are we to do with ours? How is the
mediocre private citizen to hold his own with the able bullies and
masterful women who establish family despotisms, school despotisms,
office despotisms, religious despotisms in their little circles all
over the country? Our boasted political liberties are a mockery to
the subjects of such despotisms. They may work well when the despot
is benevolent; but they are worse than any political tyranny in the
selfish cases.</p>

<p>It is much more difficult to attack a personal despotism than an
institutional one. Monarchs can be abolished: they have been
abolished in all directions during the last century and a half, with
the result, however, of sometimes replacing a personally amiable and
harmless monarch, reigning under strict constitutional and
traditional restraints, by energetic dictators and presidents who,
having made hay of constitutions and traditions, are under no
restraints at all. A hereditary monarch, on the throne because he is
the son of his father, may be a normal person, amenable to reasonable
advice from his councils, and exercising no authority except that
conferred on him (or her) by the Constitution. Behead him, as we
beheaded our Charles, or the French their Louis, and the born despot
Cromwell or Napoleon (I purposely avoid glaring contemporary examples
because I am not quite sure where they will be by the time this book
is published) takes his place. The same mysterious personal force
that makes the household tyrant, the school tyrant, the office
tyrant, the brigand chief and the pirate captain, brings the born
boss to the top by a gravitation that ordinary people cannot
resist.</p>

<p>The successful usurpers of thrones are not the worst cases. The
political usurper may be an infernal scoundrel, ruthless in murder,
treachery, and torture; but once his ambition is achieved and he has
to rule a nation, the magnitude and difficulty of his job, and the
knowledge that if he makes a mess of it he will fall as suddenly as
he has risen, will civilize him with a ruthlessness greater than his
own. When Henry IV usurped the English crown he certainly did not
intend to die of political overwork; but that is what happened to
him. No political ruler could possibly be as wickedly selfish and
cruel as the tyrant of a private house. Queen Elizabeth was a
<i>ma&icirc;tresse femme;</i> but she could have had her own way much
more completely as landlady of the Mermaid Tavern than she had as
sovereign of England. Because Nero and Paul I of Russia could not be
made to understand this, they were killed like mad dogs by their own
courtiers. But our petty fireside tyrants are not killed. Christina
of Sweden would not have had to abdicate if her realm had been a
ten-roomed villa. Had Catherine II reigned over her husband only, she
need not nor could not have had him murdered; but as Tsarina she was
forced to liquidate poor Peter very much against her own easy good
nature, which prevented her from scolding her maids properly.</p>

<p>Modern Liberal democracy claims unlimited opportunities for
tyranny: qualification for rule by heredity and class narrows it and
puts it in harness and blinkers. Especially does such democracy favor
money rule. It is in fact not democracy at all, but unashamed
plutocracy. And as the meanest creature can become rich if he devotes
his life to it, and the people with wider and more generous interests
become or remain poor with equal certainty, plutocracy is the very
devil socially, because it creates a sort of Gresham law by which the
baser human currency drives out the nobler coinage. This is quite
different from the survival of the fittest in the contests of
character and talent which are independent of money. If Moses is the
only tribesman capable of making a code of laws, he inevitably
becomes Lawgiver to all the tribes, and, equally inevitably, is
forced to add to what he can understand of divine law a series of
secular regulations designed to maintain his personal authority. If
he finds that it is useless to expect the tribesmen to obey his laws
as a matter of common sense, he must persuade them that his
inspiration is the result of direct and miraculous communication with
their deity. Moses and Mahomet and Joseph Smith the Mormon had to
plead divine revelations to get them out of temporary and personal
difficulties as well as out of eternal and impersonal ones. As long
as an individual of their calibre remains the indispensable man (or
woman) doing things that the common man can neither do without nor do
for himself, he will be, up to a point, the master of the common man
in spite of all the democratic fudge that may be advanced to the
contrary.</p>

<p>Of course there are limits. He cannot go to the lengths at which
the common man will believe him to be insane or impious: when
measures of that complexion are necessary, as they very often are, he
must either conceal them or mask them as follies of the sort the
common man thinks splendid. If the ruler thinks it well to begin a
world war he must persuade his people that it is a war to end war,
and that the people he wants them to kill are diabolical scoundrels;
and if he is forced to suspend hostilities for a while, and does so
by a treaty which contains the seeds of half a dozen new wars and is
impossible enough in its conditions to make its violation certain, he
must create a general belief that it is a charter of eternal peace
and a monument of retributive justice.</p>

<p>In this way the most honest ruler becomes a tyrant and a
fabricator of legends and falsehoods, not out of any devilment in
himself, but because those whom he rules do not understand his
business, and, if they did, would not sacrifice their own immediate
interests to the permanent interests of the nation or the world. In
short, a ruler must not only make laws, and rule from day to day: he
must, by school instruction and printed propaganda, create and
maintain an artificial mentality which will endorse his proceedings
and obey his authority. This mentality becomes what we call
Conservatism; and the revolt against it when it is abused
oppressively or becomes obsolete as social conditions change, is
classed as sedition, and reviled as Radicalism, Anarchism,
Bolshevism, or what you please.</p>

<p>When a mentality is created and a code imposed, the born ruler,
the Moses or Lenin, is no longer indispensable: routine government by
dunderheads becomes possible and in fact preferable as long as the
routine is fairly appropriate to the current phase of social
development. The assumption of the more advanced spirits that
revolutionists are always right is as questionable as the
conservative assumption that they are always wrong. The industrious
dunderhead who always does what was done last time because he is
incapable of conceiving anything better, makes the best routineer.
This explains the enormous part played by dunderheads as such in the
history of all nations, provoking repeated explanations of surprise
at the littleness of the wisdom with which the world is governed.</p>

<p>But what of the ambitious usurper? the person who has a capacity
for kingship but has no kingdom and must therefore acquire a
readymade one which is getting along in its own way very well without
him? It cannot be contended with any plausibility that William the
Conqueror was indispensable in England: he wanted England and grabbed
it. He did this by virtue of his personal qualities, entirely against
the will of the people of England, who, as far as they were
politically conscious at all, would have greatly preferred Harold.
But William had all the qualities that make an individual
irresistible: the physical strength and ferocity of a king of beasts,
the political genius of a king of men, the strategic cunning and
tactical gumption of a military genius; and nothing that France or
England could say or do prevailed against him. What are we to do with
such people?</p>

<p>When an established political routine breaks down and produces
political chaos, a combination of personal ambition with military
genius and political capacity in a single individual gives that
individual his opportunity. Napoleon, if he had been born a century
earlier, would have had no more chance of becoming emperor of the
French than Marshal Saxe had of supplanting Louis XV. In spite of the
French Revolution, he was a very ordinary snob in his
eighteenth-century social outlook. His assumption of the imperial
diadem, his ridiculous attempt to establish the little Buonaparte
family on all the thrones under his control, his remanufacture of a
titular aristocracy to make a court for himself, his silly insistence
on imperial etiquette when he was a dethroned and moribund prisoner
in St Helena, shew that, for all his genius, he was and always had
been behind the times. But he was for a time irresistible because,
though he could fight battles on academic lines only, and was on that
point a routineer soldier, he could play the war game on the
established procedure so superbly that all the armies of Europe
crumpled up before him. It was easy for anti-Bonapartist writers,
from Taine to Mr H. G. Wells, to disparage him as a mere cad; but
Goethe, who could face facts, and on occasion rub them in, said
simply 'You shake your chains in vain.' Unfortunately for himself and
Europe Napoleon was fundamentally a commonplace human fool. In spite
of his early failure in the east he made a frightful draft on the
manhood of France for his march to Moscow, only to hurry back leaving
his legions dead in the snow, and thereafter go from disaster to
disaster. Bernadotte, the lawyer's son who enlisted as a common
soldier and ended unconquered on the throne of Sweden (his
descendants still hold it), made a far better job of his affairs.
When for the first time Napoleon came up against a really original
commander at Waterloo, he still made all the textbook moves he had
learnt at the military academy, and did not know when he was beaten
until it was too late to do anything but run away. Instead of making
for America at all hazards he threw himself on the magnanimity of the
Prince Regent, who obviously could not have spared him even if he had
wanted to. His attempt to wedge himself and his upstart family into
the old dynasties by his divorce and his Austrian marriage ended in
making him a notorious cuckold. But the vulgarer fool and the
paltrier snob you prove Napoleon to have been, the more alarming
becomes the fact that this shabby-genteel Corsican subaltern (and a
very unsatisfactory subaltern at that) dominated Europe for years,
and placed on his own head the crown of Charlemagne. Is there really
nothing to be done with such men but submit to them until, having
risen by their specialities, they ruin themselves by their
vulgarities?</p>

<p>It was easy for Napoleon to make a better job of restoring order
after the French Revolution than Siey&egrave;s, who tried to do it by
writing paper constitutions, or than a plucky bully like Barras, who
cared for nothing except feathering his own nest. Any tidy and public
spirited person could have done as much with the necessary prestige.
Napoleon got that prestige by feeding the popular appetite for
military glory. He could not create that natural appetite; but he
could feed it by victories; and he could use all the devices of
journalism and pageantry and patriotic braggadocio to make La Gloire
glorious. And all this because, like William the Conqueror, he had
the group of talents that make a successful general and democratic
ruler. Had not the French Revolution so completely failed to produce
a tolerable government to replace the monarchy it overthrew, and
thereby reduced itself to desperation, Napoleon would have been only
a famous general like Saxe or Wellington or Marlborough, who under
similar circumstances could and indeed must have become kings if they
had been ungovernable enough to desire it. Only the other day a man
without any of the social advantages of these commanders made himself
Shah of Iran.</p>

<p>Julius Caesar and Cromwell also mounted on the d&eacute;bris of
collapsing political systems; and both of them refused crowns. But no
crown could have added to the power their military capacity gave
them, Caesar bribed enormously; but there were richer men than he in
Rome to play that game. Only, they could not have won the battle of
Pharsalia. Cromwell proved invincible in the field--such as it
was.</p>

<p>It is not, however, these much hackneyed historical figures that
trouble us now. Pharsalias and Dunbars and Waterloos are things of
the past: battles nowadays last several months and then peter out on
barbed wire under the fire of machine guns. Suppose Ludendorff had
been a Napoleon, and Haig a Marlborough, Wellington, and Cromwell
rolled into one, what more could they have done than either declare
modern war impossible or else keep throwing masses of infantry in the
old fashion against slaughtering machinery like pigs in Chicago?
Napoleon's booklearnt tactics and the columns that won so many
battles for him would have no more chance nowadays than the ragged
Irish pikemen on Vinegar Hill; and Wellington's thin red line and his
squares would have vanished in the fumes of T.N.T. on the Somme. 'The
Nelson touch' landed a section of the British fleet at the bottom of
the Dardanelles. And yet this war, which, if it did not end civilized
war (perhaps it did, by the way, though the War Office may not yet
have realized it) at least made an end of the supremacy of the glory
virtuoso who can play brilliant variations on the battle of Hastings,
has been followed by such a group of upstart autocrats as the world
had ceased to suppose possible. Mussolini, Hitler, Kemal and Riza
Khan began in the ranks, and have no Marengos to their credit; yet
there they are at the top!</p>

<p>Here again the circumstances gave the men their opportunity.
Neither Mussolini nor Hitler could have achieved their present
personal supremacy when I was born in the middle of the nineteenth
century, because the prevailing mentality of that deluded time was
still hopefully parliamentary. Democracy was a dream, an ideal.
Everything would be well when all men had votes. Everything would be
better than well when all women had votes. There was a great fear of
public opinion because it was a dumb phantom which every statesman
could identify with his own conscience and dread as the Nemesis of
unscrupulous ambition. That was the golden age of democracy: the
phantom was a real and beneficent force. Many delusions are. In those
days even our Conservative rulers agreed that we were a liberty
loving people: that, for instance, Englishmen would never tolerate
compulsory military service as the slaves of foreign despots did.</p>

<p>It was part of the democratic dream that Parliament was an
instrument for carrying out the wishes of the voters, absurdly called
its constituents. And as, in the nineteenth century, it was still
believed that British individual liberty forbad Parliament to do
anything that it could possibly leave to private enterprise,
Parliament was able to keep up its reputation by simply maintaining
an effective police force and enforcing private contracts. Even
Factory Acts and laws against adulteration and sweating were
jealously resisted as interferences with the liberty of free Britons.
If there was anything wrong, the remedy was an extension of the
franchise. Like Hamlet, we lived on the chameleon's dish 'air,
promise crammed.'</p>

<p>But you cannot create a mentality out of promises without having
to face occasional demands for their materialization. The Treasury
Bench was up for auction at every election, the bidding being in
promises. The political parties, finding it much less troublesome to
give the people votes than to carry out reforms, at last established
adult suffrage.</p>

<p>The result was a colossal disappointment and disillusion. The
phantom of Democracy, <i>alias</i> Public Opinion, which, acting as
an artificial political conscience, had restrained Gladstone and
Disraeli, vanished. The later parliamentary leaders soon learnt from
experience that they might with perfect impunity tell the nation one
thing on Tuesday and the opposite on Friday without anyone noticing
the discrepancy. The donkey had overtaken the carrots at last; and
instead of eating them he allowed them to be snatched away from him
by any confidence trickster who told him to look up into the sky.</p>

<p>The diplomatists immediately indulged themselves with a
prodigiously expensive war, after which the capitalist system, which
had undertaken to find employment for everybody at subsistence wages,
and which, though it had never fulfilled that undertaking, had at
least found employment for enough of them to leave the rest too few
to be dangerous, defaulted in respect of unprecedented millions of
unemployed, who had to be bought off by doles administered with a
meanness and cruelty which revived all the infamies of the Poor Law
of a century ago (the days of Oliver Twist) and could not be
administered in any kinder way without weakening the willingness of
its recipients to prefer even the poorliest paid job to its
humiliations.</p>

<p>The only way of escape was for the Government to organize the
labor of the unemployed for the supply of their own needs. But
Parliament not only could not do this, but could and did prevent its
being done. In vain did the voters use their votes to place a Labor
Government, with a Cabinet of Socialists, on the Treasury Bench.
Parliament took these men, who had been intransigent Socialists and
revolutionists all their lives, and reduced them to a condition of
political helplessness in which they were indistinguishable except by
name from the most reactionary members of the House of Lords or the
military clubs. A Socialist Prime Minister, after trying for years to
get the parliamentary car into gear for a move forward, and finding
that though it would work easily and smoothly in neutral the only
gear that would engage was the reverse gear (popularly called 'the
axe' because it could do nothing but cut down wages), first formed
what he called a national government by a coalition of all parties,
and then, having proved by this experiment that it did not make the
smallest difference whether members of the Cabinet were the reddest
of Bolsheviks or the bluest of Tories, made things easier by handing
over his premiership to a colleague who, being a Conservative, and
popular and amiable into the bargain, could steal a horse where a
Socialist dare not look over a hedge. The voters rejected him at the
next election; but he retained his membership of the Cabinet
precisely as if he had been triumphantly returned. Bismarck could
have done no more.</p>

<p>These events, helped by the terrific moral shock of the war, and
the subsequent exposure of the patriotic lying by which the workers
of Europe had been provoked to slaughter one another, made an end of
the nineteenth century democratic mentality. Parliament fell into
contempt; ballot papers were less esteemed than toilet papers; the
men from the trenches had no patience with the liberties that had not
saved them from being driven like sheep to the shambles.</p>

<p>Of this change our parliamentarians and journalists had no
suspicion. Creatures of habit, they went on as if nothing had
occurred since Queen Victoria's death except a couple of extensions
of the franchise and an epoch-making revolution in Russia which they
poohpoohed as a transient outburst of hooliganism fomented by a few
bloodthirsty scoundrels, exactly as the American revolution and the
French revolution had been poohpoohed when they, too, were
contemporary.</p>

<p>Here was clearly a big opportunity for a man psychologist enough
to grasp the situation and bold enough to act on it. Such a man was
Mussolini. He had become known as a journalist by championing the
demobilized soldiers who, after suffering all the horrors of the war,
had returned to find that the men who had been kept at home in the
factories comfortably earning good wages, had seized those factories
according to the Syndicalist doctrine of 'worker's control', and were
wrecking them in their helpless ignorance of business. As one
indignant master-Fascist said to me 'They were listening to speeches
round red flags and leaving the cows unmilked.'</p>

<p>The demobilized fell on the Syndicalists with sticks and stones.
Some, more merciful, only dosed them with castor oil. They carried
Mussolini to Rome with a rush. This gave him the chance of making an
irreparable mistake and spending the next fifteen years in prison. It
seemed just the occasion for a grand appeal for liberty, for
democracy, for a parliament in which the people were supreme: in
short, for nineteenth century resurrection pie. Mussolini did not
make that mistake. With inspired precision he denounced Liberty as a
putrefying corpse. He declared that what people needed was not
liberty but discipline, the sterner the better. He said that he would
not tolerate Oppositions: he called for action and silence. The
people, instead of being shocked like good Liberals, rose to him. He
was able to organize a special constabulary who wore black shirts and
applied the necessary coercion.</p>

<p>Such improvised bodies attracted young men of military tastes and
old soldiers, inevitably including a percentage of ruffians and
Sadists. This fringe of undesirables soon committed outrages and a
couple of murders, whereupon all the Liberal newspapers in Europe
shrieked with horror, as if nothing else was happening in Italy.
Mussolini refused to be turned aside from his work like a
parliamentary man to discuss 'incidents'. All he said was 'I take the
responsibility for everything that has happened.' When the Italian
Liberals joined in the shrieking he seized the shriekers and
transported them to the Lipari Isles. Parliament, openly flouted,
chastised, and humiliated, could do nothing. The people were
delighted; for that was just how they wanted to see Parliament
treated. The doctrinaires of liberty fled to France and England,
preferring them to Lipari, and wrote eloquent letters to the papers
demanding whether every vestige of freedom, freedom of speech,
freedom of the press, freedom of Parliament, was to be trampled under
the heel of a ruthless dictator merely because the Italian trains
were running punctually and travellers in Italy could depend on their
luggage not being stolen without actually sitting on it. The English
editors gave them plenty of space, and wrote sympathetic articles
paraphrasing John Stuart Mill's Essay on Liberty. Mussolini, now Il
Duce, never even looked round: he was busy sweeping up the elected
municipalities, and replacing them with efficient commissioners of
his own choice, who had to do their job or get out. The editors had
finally to accord him a sort of Pragmatic Sanction by an admission
that his plan worked better than the old plan; but they were still
blind to the fact staring them in the face that Il Duce, knowing what
the people wanted and giving it to them, was responding to the real
democratic urge whilst the cold tealeaves of the nineteenth century
were making them sick. It was evident that Mussolini was master of
Italy as far as such mastership is possible; but what was not evident
to Englishmen who had had their necks twisted the other way from
their childhood was that even when he deliberately spat in the face
of the League of Nations at Corfu, and defiantly asked the Powers
whether they had anything to say about it, he was delighting his own
people by the spectacle of a great Italian bullying the world, and
getting away with it triumphantly. Parliaments are supposed to have
their fingers always on the people's pulse and to respond to its
slightest throb. Mussolini proved that parliaments have not the
slightest notion of how the people are feeling, and that he, being a
good psychologist and a man of the people himself to boot, was a true
organ of democracy.</p>

<p>I, being a bit of a psychologist myself, also understood the
situation, and was immediately denounced by the refugees and their
champions as an anti-democrat, a hero worshipper of tyrants, and all
the rest of it.</p>

<p>Hitler's case was different; but he had one quality in common with
Il Duce: he knew what the victorious Allies would fight for and what
they would only bluster about. They had already been forced to
recognize that their demands for plunder had gone far beyond
Germany's utmost resources. But there remained the clauses of the
Versailles treaty by which Germany was to be kept in a condition of
permanent, decisive, and humiliating military inferiority to the
other Powers, and especially to France. Hitler was political
psychologist enough to know that the time had arrived when it would
be quite impossible for the Allies to begin the war over again to
enforce these clauses. He saw his opportunity and took it. He
violated the clauses, and declared that he was going to go on
violating them until a fully re-armed Germany was on equal terms with
the victors. He did not soften his defiance by any word of argument
or diplomacy. He knew that his attitude was safe and sure of success;
and he took care to make it as defiant as that of Ajax challenging
the lightning. The Powers had either to renew the war or tear up the
impossible clauses with a good grace. But they could not grasp the
situation, and went on nagging pitifully about the wickedness of
breaking a treaty. Hitler said that if they mentioned that subject
again Germany would withdraw from the League of Nations and cut the
Powers dead. He bullied and snubbed as the man who understands a
situation can always bully and snub the nincompoops who are only
whining about it. He at once became a popular idol, and had the
regular executive forces so completely devoted to him that he was
able to disband the brownshirted constabulary he had organized on the
Mussolini model. He met the conventional democratic challenge by
plebiscites of ninety per cent in his favor. The myopia of the Powers
had put him in a position so far stronger than Mussolini's that he
was able to kill seventy-seven of his most dangerous opponents at a
blow and then justify himself completely before an assembly fully as
representative as the British Parliament, the climax being his
appointment as absolute dictator in Germany for life, a stretch of
Caesarism no nineteenth-century Hohenzollern would have dreamt of
demanding.</p>

<p>Hitler was able to go further than Mussolini because he had a
defeated, plundered, humiliated nation to rescue and restore, whereas
Mussolini had only an irritated but victorious one. He carried out a
persecution of the Jews which went to the scandalous length of
outlawing, plundering, and exiling Albert Einstein, a much greater
man than any politician, but great in such a manner that he was quite
above the heads of the masses and therefore so utterly powerless
economically and militarily that he depended for his very existence
on the culture and conscience of the rulers of the earth. Hitler's
throwing Einstein to the Antisemite wolves was an appalling breach of
cultural faith. It raised the question which is the root question of
this preface: to wit, what safeguard have the weaponless great
against the great who have myrmidons at their call? It is the most
frightful betrayal of civilization for the rulers who monopolize
physical force to withhold their protection from the pioneers in
thought. Granted that they are sometimes forced to do it because
intellectual advances may present themselves as quackery, sedition,
obscenity, or blasphemy, and always present themselves as heresies.
Had Einstein been formally prosecuted and sentenced by the German
National Socialist State, as Galileo was prosecuted by the Church,
for shaking the whole framework of established physical science by
denying the infallibility of Newton, introducing fantastic factors
into mathematics, destroying human faith in absolute measurement, and
playing an incomprehensible trick with the sacred velocity of light,
quite a strong case could have been made out by the public
prosecutor. But to set the police on him because he was a Jew could
be justified only on the ground that the Jews are the natural enemies
of the rest of the human race, and that as a state of perpetual war
necessarily exists between them any Gentile has the same reason for
killing any Jew at sight as the Roman soldier had for killing
Archimedes.</p>

<p>Now no doubt Jews are most obnoxious creatures. Any competent
historian or psycho-analyst can bring a mass of incontrovertible
evidence to prove that it would have been better for the world if the
Jews had never existed. But I, as an Irishman, can, with patriotic
relish, demonstrate the same of the English. Also of the Irish. If
Herr Hitler would only consult the French and British newspapers and
magazines of the latter half of 1914, he would learn that the Germans
are a race of savage idolaters, murderers, liars, and fiends whose
assumption of the human form is thinner than that of the wolf in
Little Red Riding Hood.</p>

<p>We all live in glass houses. Is it wise to throw stones at the
Jews? Is it wise to throw stones at all?</p>

<p>Herr Hitler is not only an Antisemite, but a believer in the
possibility and desirability of a pure bred German race. I should
like to ask him why. All Germans are not Mozarts, nor even
Mendelssohns and Meyerbeers, both of whom, by the way, though
exceptionally desirable Germans, were Jews. Surely the average German
can be improved. I am told that children bred from Irish colleens and
Chinese laundrymen are far superior to inbred Irish or Chinese. Herr
Hitler is not a typical German. I should not be at all surprised if
it were discovered that his very mixed blood (all our bloods today
are hopelessly mixed) got fortified somewhere in the past by that of
King David. He cannot get over the fact that the lost tribes of
Israel expose us all to the suspicion (sometimes, as in Abyssinia, to
the boast) that we are those lost tribes, or at least that we must
have absorbed them.</p>

<p>One of my guesses in this matter is that Herr Hitler in his youth
was fascinated by Houston Chamberlain's Foundations of the XIX
Century, an interesting book which at the time of its appearance I
recommended everybody to read. Its ethnology was not wholly
imaginary. A smattering of Mendelism is all that one needs to know
that the eternal fusion of races does not always blend them. The Jews
will often throw up an apparently pure-bred Hittite or a pure-bred
Philistine. The Germans throw up out-and-out blond beasts side by
side with dark Saturnine types like the F&uuml;hrer himself. I am a
blond, much less an antique Roman than a Dane. One of my sisters was
a brunette: the other had hair of a flaming red seen only in the
Scottish Highlands, to which my ancestry has been traced. All these
types with which writers like Chamberlain play: the Teutons and
Latins, the Apollonians and Dionysians, the Nordics and Southics, the
Dominants and Recessives, have existed and keep cropping up as
individuals, and exciting antipathies or affinities quite often
enough to give substance to theories about them; but the notion that
they can be segregated as races or species is bosh. We have nations
with national characteristics (rapidly fading, by the way), national
languages, and national customs. But they deteriorate without cross
fertilization; and if Herr Hitler could put a stop to cross
fertilization in Germany and produce a population of brainless
Bismarcks Germany would be subjugated by crossfertilized aliens,
possibly by cosmopolitan Jews. There is more difference between a
Catholic Bavarian and a Lutheran Prussian, between a tall fair Saxon
and a stocky Baltic Celt, than there is between a Frankfort Jew and a
Frankfort Gentile. Even in Africa, where pink emigrants struggle with
brown and black natives for possession of the land, and our Jamaican
miscegenation shocks public sentiment, the sun sterilizes the pinks
to such an extent that Cabinet ministers call for more emigration to
maintain the pink population. They do not yet venture to suggest that
the pinks had better darken their skins with a mixture of Bantu or
Zulu blood; but that conclusion is obvious. In New Zealand, in
Hawaii, there are pure-bred pinks and yellows; but there are hardly
any pure-bred Maories or South Sea Islanders left. In Africa the
intelligent pink native is a Fusionist as between Dutch and British
stock. The intelligent Jew is a Fusionist as between Jew and Gentile
stock, even when he is also a bit of a Zionist. Only the stupidest or
craziest ultra-Nationalists believe that people corralled within the
same political frontier are all exactly alike, and that they improve
by continuous inbreeding.</p>

<p>Now Herr Hitler is not a stupid German. I therefore urge upon him
that his Antisemitism and national exclusiveness must be
pathological: a craze, a complex, a bee in his bonnet, a hole in his
armor, a hitch in his statesmanship, one of those lesions which
sometimes prove fatal. As it has no logical connection with Fascism
or National Socialism, and has no effect on them except to bring them
into disrepute, I doubt whether it can survive its momentary
usefulness as an excuse for plundering raids and <i>coups
d'&eacute;tat</i> against inconvenient Liberals or Marxists. A
persecution is always a man hunt; and man hunting is not only a very
horrible sport but socially a dangerous one, as it revives a
primitive instinct incompatible with civilization: indeed
civilization rests fundamentally on the compact that it shall be
dropped.</p>

<p>And here comes the risk we run when we allow a dominant individual
to become a despot. There is a story told of a pious man who was
sustained through a lifetime of crushing misfortune by his steady
belief that if he fought the good fight to the end he would at last
stand in the presence of his God. In due course he died, and
presented himself at the gates of heaven for his reward. Saint Peter,
who was for some reason much worried, hastily admitted him and bade
him go and enjoy himself. But the good man said that he did not want
to enjoy himself: he wanted to stand in the presence of God. Saint
Peter tried to evade the claim, dwelling on the other delights of
heaven, coaxing, bullying, arguing. All in vain: he could not shake
the claimant and could not deny his right. He sent for Saint Paul,
who was as worried and as evasive as his colleague; but he also
failed to induce the newcomer to forgo his promised privilege. At
last they took him by the arms and led him to a mighty cathedral,
where, entering by the west door, he saw the Ancient of Days seated
in silent majesty on a throne in the choir. He sprang forward to
prostrate himself at the divine feet, but was held back firmly by the
apostles. 'Be quiet' said Saint Paul. 'He has gone mad; and we dont
know what to do.' 'Dont tell anybody' added Saint Peter. And there
the story ends.</p>

<p>But that is not how the story ends on earth. Make any common
fellow an autocrat and at once you have the Beggar on Horseback
riding to the devil. Even when, as the son of his father, he has been
trained from infancy to behave well in harness and blinkers, he may
go as mad sadistically as a Roman emperor or a Russian Tsar. But that
is only the extreme case. Uncommon people, promoted on their merits,
are by no means wholly exempt from megalomania. Morris's simple and
profound saying that 'no man is good enough to be another man's
master' holds good unless both master and man regard themselves as
equally the fellow servants of God in States where God still reigns,
or, in States where God is dead, as the subjects and agents of a
political constitution applying humane principles which neither of
them may violate. In that case autocrats are no longer autocrats.
Failing any such religious or political creed all autocrats go more
or less mad. That is a plain fact of political pathology.</p>

<p>Judged in this light our present predicament is lamentable. We no
longer believe in the old 'sanctions' (as they are called nowadays)
of heaven and hell; and except in Russia there is not in force a
single political constitution that enables and enjoins the citizen to
earn his own living as a matter of elementary honesty, or that does
not exalt vast personal riches and the organization of slaughter and
conquest above all other conditions and activities. The financier and
the soldier are the cocks of the walk; and democracy means that their
parasites and worshippers carry all before them.</p>

<p>Thus when so many other tyrannies have been swept away by simple
Liberalism, the tyranny of the talented individuals will remain.
Again I ask what are we to do with them in self-defence? Mere
liquidation would be disastrous, because at present only about five
per cent of the population are capable of making decisions of any
importance; and without many daily decisions civilization would go to
pieces. The problem is how to make sure that the decisions shall be
made in the general interest and not solely in the immediate personal
interest of the decider. It was argued by our classical political
economists that there is a divine harmony between these two interests
of such a nature that if every decider does the best for himself the
result will also be the best for everybody. In spite of a century of
bitter experience of the adoption of these excuses for laziness in
politics, shameless selfishness in industry, and glorification of
idle uselessness in the face of the degrading misery of the masses,
they are still taught in our universities, and, what is worse,
broadcast by university professors by wireless, as authentic
political economy instead of what they really are: that is, the
special pleading put forward in defence of the speculators,
exploiters, and parasitic property owners in whose grossly
anti-social interests the country is misgoverned. Since Karl Marx and
Friedrich Engels exposed the horrible condition of the working
classes that underlies the pursepride and snobbery of the upper
middle classes and the prestige of the landed gentry and peerage
there has been no substantial excuse for believing in the alleged
harmony of interests. Nothing more diabolical can be conceived than
the destiny of a civilization in which the material sources of the
people's subsistence are privately owned by a handful of persons
taught from childhood that every penny they can extort from the
propertyless is an addition to the prosperity of their country and an
enrichment of the world at large.</p>

<p>But private property is not the subject of my demonstration in The
Millionairess. Private property can be communized. Capitalists and
landlords can be pressed into the service of the community, or, if
they are idle or incorrigibly recalcitrant, handed over to the
police. Under such circumstances the speculator would find his
occupation gone. With him would disappear the routine exploiter. But
the decider, the dominator, the organizer, the tactician, the
mesmerizer would remain; and if they were still educated as ladies
and gentlemen are educated today, and consequently had the same sort
of consciences and ambitions, they would, if they had anything like
our present proletariat to deal with, re-establish industrial anarchy
and heritable private property in land with all their disastrous
consequences and Gadarene destiny. And their rule, being that of able
persons and not of nincompoops born with silver spoons in their
mouths, would at first produce some striking improvements in the
working of the public services, including the elimination of dud
dignitaries and the general bracing up of plodders and slackers. But
when dominators die, and are succeeded by persons who can only work a
routine, a relapse is inevitable; and the destruction by the
dominators of the organizations by which citizens defend themselves
against oppression (trade unions, for example) may be found to leave
society less organized than it was before the hand of the master had
risen from the dust to which it has returned. For it is obvious that
a business organized for control by an exceptionally omnipotent and
omniscient head will go to pieces when that head is replaced by a
commonplace numskull. We need not go back to Richard Cromwell or the
Duke of Reichstadt to illustrate this. It is occurring every day in
commercial business.</p>

<p>Now the remedy lies, not in the extermination of all dominators
and deciders, but on the contrary in their multiplication to what may
be called their natural minority limit, which will destroy their
present scarcity value. But we must also eliminate the mass of
ignorance, weakness, and timidity which force them to treat fools
according to their folly. Armies, fanatical sects and mobs, and the
blackshirts complained of today by their black and blue victims, have
consisted hitherto mostly of people who should not exist in civilized
society. Titus Oates and Lord George Gordon owed their vogue to the
London mob. There should not have been any London mob. The soldiers
of Marlborough and Wellington were never-do-wells, mental defectives,
and laborers with the minds and habits of serfs. Military geniuses
could hunt with such products more easily than with a pack of hounds.
Our public school and university education equips armies of this kind
with appropriate staffs of officers. When both are extinct we shall
be able to breathe more freely.</p>

<p>Let us therefore assume that the soldier and his officer as we
know them, the Orange and Papist rioters of Belfast, the Moslem and
Hindu irreconcilables of the east and the Ku-Klux-Klans and lynching
mobs of the west, have passed away as the less dangerous prehistoric
monsters have passed, and that all men and women are meeting on equal
terms as far as circumstances and education are concerned. Let us
suppose that no man can starve or flog his fellows into obeying him,
or force upon them the alternative of risking their lives for him in
battle or being shot at dawn. Let us take for granted armies
intelligent enough to present their officers at any moment with the
alternative of organizing a return home or being superseded out of
hand. Let us narrow the case to the mysterious precedence into which
certain people get pushed even when they lack ambition and are far
too intelligent to believe that eminence and its responsibilities are
luxuries. To be 'greatest among you' is a distinction dearly bought
at the price of being 'servant to all the rest.' Plato was quite
right in taking reluctance to govern as a leading symptom of supreme
fitness for it. But if we insisted on this qualification in all
cases, we should find ourselves as short of governors as the churches
would be if they insisted on all their parish priests or rectors
being saints. A great deal of the directing and organizing work of
the world will still have to be done by energetic and capable
careerists who are by no means void of vulgar ambition, and very
little troubled by the responsibilities that attend on power. When I
said that Napoleon was fundamentally a fool and a snob I did not mean
for a moment to question his extraordinary capacity as a ruler of
men. If we compare him with his valet-secretary Bourrienne we find
that there were no external circumstances to prevent Bourrienne
becoming the emperor and Napoleon the valet. They quarrelled and
parted with an exchange of epithets unprintable in polite English.
Bourrienne was as much a Man of Destiny as Buonaparte. But it was his
destiny to be ruled and Buonaparte's to rule; and so Buonaparte
became Napoleon Bonaparte, First Consul and Emperor, as inevitably as
Bourrienne remained a speculator, litterateur and diplomatist. I am
not forgetting that Bourrienne saw Napoleon come and go, and had a
much more comfortable and finally a more successful career than his
quondam master; but the point is that Napoleon was master whilst
their personal relations lasted. And please note that Napoleon did
not and could not impose on Bourrienne and Talleyrand, nor even on
the more cultivated of his marshals (all planetary Napoleons) as he
could and did on the soldiery and peasantry. They turned against him
very promptly when his fortunes changed and he could no longer be of
any use to them.</p>

<p>Now if a ruler can command men only as long as he is efficient and
successful his rule is neither a tyranny nor a calamity: it is a very
valuable asset. But suppose the nation is made up for the most part
of people too ignorant to understand efficient government, and
taught, as far as they are taught at all, to measure greatness by
pageantry and the wholesale slaughter called military glory. It was
this ignorance and idolatry that first exalted Napoleon and then
smashed him. From Toulon to Austerlitz Napoleon did what good he did
by stealth, and had no occasion to 'blush to find it fame,' as nobody
gave him the least credit for anything but killing. When the glory
turned to shame on the road back from Moscow his good works availed
him nothing, and the way was open to St Helena. Catherine of Russia,
when she was faced with a revolt against the misery of her people,
said, not 'Let us relieve their misery by appropriate reforms,' but
'Let us give them a little war to amuse them.' Every tottering regime
tries to rally its subjects to its support in the last resort by a
war. It was not only the last card of Napoleon III before he lost the
game: it played a considerable part in the capitalist support of
Hohenzollern sabre rattling which made the desperate onslaught of
Germany in 1914 possible. Patriotism, roused to boiling point by an
enemy at the gate, is not only the last refuge of a scoundrel in Dr
Johnson's sense, it is far more dangerously the everyday resort of
capitalism and feudalism as a red herring across the scent of
Communism. Under such circumstances it is fortunate that war on the
modern scale is so completely beyond the capacity of private
capitalism that, as in 1915, it forces the belligerents into national
factory production, public discipline, and rationed distribution: in
short, into Socialism. Not only did national factories spring up like
mushrooms, but the private factories had to be brought up to the mark
by public control of prices and dictation of scientific business
methods, involving such an exposure of the obsolescence and
inefficiency of profitmongering methods that it took years of
reckless lying from Press and platform to make the silly public
believe the contrary. For war is like the seven magic bullets which
the devil has ready to sell for a human soul. Six of them may hit the
glorymonger's mark very triumphantly; but the seventh plays some
unexpected and unintended trick that upsets the gunman's apple cart.
It seemed an astute stroke of German imperial tactics to send Lenin
safely through Germany to Russia so that he might make trouble for
the Tsar. But the bullet was a number seven: it killed the Tsar very
efficiently; but it came back like a boomerang and laid the
Hohenzollerns beside the Romanoffs.</p>

<p>Pageantry will lose its black magic when it becomes a local
popular amusement; so that the countryside may come to know it from
behind the scenes, when, though it will still please, it will no
longer impose. For mere iconoclasm is a mistake: the Roundhead folly
(really a Thickhead one) of destroying the power of the pageant by
forbidding all theatrical displays and dressings-up, and making
everybody wear ugly clothes, ended in the flamboyant profligacy of
the Restoration; and the attempt to enforce the second commandment by
smashing the images soon smashed the second commandment. Give away
the secret that the dressed-up performers are only amateurs, and the
images works of art, and the dupes and worshippers will become
undeluded connoisseurs.</p>

<p>Unfortunately it is easier to produce a nation of artistic than of
political connoisseurs. Our schools and universities do not concern
themselves with fine art, which they despise as an unmanly pursuit.
It is possible for a young gentleman to go through the whole
educational mill of preparatory school, public school, and university
with the highest academic honors without knowing the difference
between a chanty and a symphony, a tavern sign and a portrait by
Titian, a ballad by Macaulay and a stanza by Keats. But at least he
is free to find out all this for himself if he has a fancy that
way.</p>

<p>Not so in political science. Not so in religion. In these subjects
he is proselytized from the beginning in the interests of established
institutions so effectually that he remains all his life firmly
convinced that his greatest contemporaries are rascally and venal
agitators, villainous blasphemers, or at best seditious cads. He will
listen to noodles' orations, read pompous leading articles, and
worship the bloodthirsty tribal idols of Noah and Samuel with a
gravity and sincerity that would make him infinitely pitiable if they
did not also make him infinitely dangerous. He will feed his mind on
empty phrases as Nebuchadnezzar fed his body on grass; and any boss
who has mastered these phrases can become his dictator, his despot,
his evangelist, and in effect his god-emperor.</p>

<p>Clearly we shall be bossridden in one form or another as long as
education means being put through this process, or the best imitation
of it that our children's parents can afford. The remedy is another
Reformation, now long and perilously overdue, in the direction and
instruction of our children's minds politically and religiously. We
should begin well to the left of Russia, which is still encumbered
with nineteenth century superstitions. Communism is the fairy
godmother who can transform Bosses into 'servants to all the rest';
but only a creed of Creative Evolution can set the souls of the
people free. Then the dominator will still find himself face to face
with subordinates who can do nothing without him; but that will not
give him the inside grip. A late rich shipowner, engaged in a quarrel
with his workmen in which he assumed that I was on their side, rashly
asked me what his men could do without him. Naturally I asked him
what he could do without them, hoping to open his eyes to the fact
that apart from the property rights he had bought or borrowed he was
as dependent on them as they on him. But I fear I impressed him most
by adding, quite untruly, that no gentleman would have asked that
question.</p>

<p>Save for my allusion to the persecution and exile of Einstein I
have not said a word here about the miserable plight of the great men
neglected, insulted, starved, and occasionally put to death,
sometimes horribly, by the little ones. Their case is helpless
because nothing can defend them against the might of overwhelming
numbers unless and until they develop the Vril imagined by
Bulwer-Lytton which will enable one person to destroy a multitude,
and thereby make us more particular than we are at present about the
sort of persons we produce. I am confining myself to the power
wielded by the moneymakers and military geniuses in political life
and by the dominant personalities in private life. Lytton's Vril was
a fiction only in respect of its being available for everybody, and
therefore an infallible preventive of any attempt at oppression. For
that individuals here and there possess a power of domination which
others are unable to resist is undeniable; and since this power is as
yet nameless we may as well call it Vril as anything else. It is the
final reality of inequality. It is easy to equalize the dominators
with the commonplacers economically: you just give one of them
half-a-crown and the other two-and-sixpence. Nelson was paid no more
than any other naval captain or admiral; and the poverty of Mozart or
Marx was worse than the voluntary holy poverty of the great heads of
the religious orders. Dominators and dominated are already equalized
before the law: shall not I, a playwright of Shakesperean eminence,
be hanged if I commit a murder precisely as if I were the most
illiterate call boy? Politically we all have at least the symbol of
equality in our votes, useless as they are to us under political and
economic institutions made to encourage William the Conqueror to slay
Harold and exploit Hodge. But, I repeat, when all these perfectly
feasible equalizations are made real, there still remains Epifania,
shorn of her millions and unable to replace them, but still as
dominant as Saint Joan, Saint Clare, and Saint Teresa. The most
complete Communism and Democracy can only give her her chance far
more effectively than any feudal or capitalist society.</p>

<p>And this, I take it, is one of the highest claims of Communism and
Democracy to our consideration, and the explanation of the apparently
paradoxical fact that it is always the greatest spirits, from Jesus
to Lenin, from Saint Thomas More to William Morris, who are
communists and democrats, and always the commonplace people who weary
us with their blitherings about the impossibility of equality when
they are at a loss for any better excuse for keeping other people in
the kitchen and themselves in the drawing room. I say cheerfully to
the dominators 'By all means dominate: it is up to us to so order our
institutions that you shall not oppress us, nor bequeath any of your
precedence to your commonplace children.' For when ambition and greed
and mere brainless energy have been disabled, the way will be clear
for inspiration and aspiration to save us from the fatheaded
stagnation of the accursed Victorian snobbery which is bringing us to
the verge of ruin.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><i>Mr Julius Sagamore, a smart young solicitor, is in his office
in Lincoln's Inn Fields. It is a fine morning in May. The room, an
old panelled one, is so arranged that Mr Sagamore, whom we see
sitting under the window in profile with his back to it and his left
side presented to us, is fenced off by his writing table from
excessive intimacy with emotional clients or possible assault by
violent or insane ones. The door is on his right towards the farther
end of the room. The faces of the clients are thus illuminated by the
window whilst his own countenance is in shadow. The fireplace, of
Adam design, is in the wall facing him. It is surmounted by a dingy
portrait of a judge. In the wall on his right, near the corner
farthest from him, is the door, with a cleft pediment enshrining a
bust of some other judge. The rest of this wall is occupied by
shelves of calf-bound law books. The wall behind Mr Sagamore has the
big window as aforesaid, and beside it a stand of black tin boxes
inscribed with clients' names.</i></p>

<p><i>So far, the place proclaims the eighteenth century; but as the
year is 1935, and Mr Sagamore has no taste for dust and mould, and
requires a room which suggests opulence, and in which lady clients
will look their best, everything is well dusted and polished; the
green carpet is new, rich, and thick; and the half dozen chairs, four
of which are ranged under the bookshelves, are Chippendales of the
very latest fake. Of the other two one is occupied by himself, and
the other stands half way between his table and the fireplace for the
accommodation of his clients.</i></p>

<p><i>The telephone, on the table at his elbow, rings.</i></p>

<p> </p>
</blockquote>

<p>SAGAMORE <i>[listening]</i> Yes? . . . <i>[Impressed]</i> Oh! Send
her up at once.</p>

<p><i>A tragic looking woman, athletically built and expensively
dressed, storms into the room. He rises obsequiously.</i></p>

<p>THE LADY. Are you Julius Sagamore, the worthless nephew of my late
solicitor Pontifex Sagamore?</p>

<p>SAGAMORE. I do not advertize myself as worthless; but Pontifex
Sagamore was my uncle; and I have returned from Australia to succeed
to as much of his business as I can persuade his clients to trust me
with.</p>

<p>THE LADY. I have heard him speak of you; and I naturally concluded
that as you had been packed off to Australia you must be worthless.
But it does not matter, as my business is very simple. I desire to
make my will, leaving everything I possess to my husband. You can
hardly go wrong about that, I suppose.</p>

<p>SAGAMORE. I shall do my best. Pray sit down.</p>

<p>THE LADY. No: I am restless. I shall sit down when I feel
tired.</p>

<p>SAGAMORE. As you please. Before I draw up the will it will be
necessary for me to know who your husband is.</p>

<p>THE LADY. My husband is a fool and a blackguard. You will state
that fact in the will. You will add that it was his conduct that
drove me to commit suicide.</p>

<p>SAGAMORE. But you have not committed suicide.</p>

<p>THE LADY. I shall have, when the will is signed.</p>

<p>SAGAMORE. Of course, quite so: stupid of me. And his name?</p>

<p>THE LADY. His name is Alastair Fitzfassenden.</p>

<p>SAGAMORE. What! The amateur tennis champion and heavy weight
boxer?</p>

<p>THE LADY. Do you know him?</p>

<p>SAGAMORE. Every morning we swim together at the club.</p>

<p>THE LADY. The acquaintance does you little credit.</p>

<p>SAGAMORE. I had better tell you that he and I are great friends,
Mrs Fitzfassen--</p>

<p>THE LADY. Do not call me by his detestable name. Put me in your
books as Epifania Ognisanti di Parerga.</p>

<p>SAGAMORE <i>[bowing]</i> Oh! I am indeed honored. Pray be
seated.</p>

<p>EPIFANIA. Sit down yourself; and dont fuss.</p>

<p>SAGAMORE. If you prefer it, certainly. <i>[He sits].</i> Your
father was a very wonderful man, madam.</p>

<p>EPIFANIA. My father was the greatest man in the world. And he died
a pauper. I shall never forgive the world for that.</p>

<p>SAGAMORE. A pauper! You amaze me. It was reported that he left
you, his only child, thirty millions.</p>

<p>EPIFANIA. Well, what was thirty millions to him? He lost a hundred
and fifty millions. He had promised to leave me two hundred millions.
I was left with a beggarly thirty. It broke his heart.</p>

<p>SAGAMORE. Still, an income of a million and a half--</p>

<p>EPIFANIA. Man: you forget the death duties. I have barely seven
hundred thousand a year. Do you know what that means to a woman
brought up on an income of seven figures? The humiliation of it!</p>

<p>SAGAMORE. You take away my breath, madam.</p>

<p>EPIFANIA. As I am about to take my own breath away, I have no time
to attend to yours.</p>

<p>SAGAMORE. Oh, the suicide! I had forgotten that.</p>

<p>EPIFANIA. Had you indeed? Well, will you please give your mind to
it for a moment, and draw up a will for me to sign, leaving
everything to Alastair.</p>

<p>SAGAMORE. To humiliate him?</p>

<p>EPIFANIA. No. To ruin him. To destroy him. To make him a beggar on
horseback so that he may ride to the devil. Money goes to his head. I
have seen it at work on him.</p>

<p>SAGAMORE. I also have seen that happen. But you cannot be sure. He
might marry some sensible woman.</p>

<p>EPIFANIA. You are right. Make it a condition of the inheritance
that within a month from my funeral he marries a low female named
Polly Seedystockings.</p>

<p>SAGAMORE <i>[making a note of it]</i> A funny name.</p>

<p>EPIFANIA. Her real name is Patricia Smith. But her letters to
Alastair are signed Polly Seedystockings, as a hint, I suppose, that
she wants him to buy her another dozen.</p>

<p>SAGAMORE <i>[taking another sheet of paper and writing]</i> I
should like to know Polly.</p>

<p>EPIFANIA. Pray why?</p>

<p>SAGAMORE <i>[talking as he writes]</i> Well, if Alastair prefers
her to you she must be indeed worth knowing. I shall certainly make
him introduce me.</p>

<p>EPIFANIA. You are hardly tactful, Julius Sagamore.</p>

<p>SAGAMORE. That will not matter when you have taken this <i>[he
hands her what he has written].</i></p>

<p>EPIFANIA. What's this?</p>

<p>SAGAMORE. For the suicide. You will have to sign the chemist's
book for the cyanide. Say it is for a wasp's nest. The tartaric acid
is harmless: the chemist will think you want it to make lemonade. Put
the two separately in just enough water to dissolve them. When you
mix the two solutions the tartaric and potash will combine and make
tartrate of potash. This, being insoluble, will be precipitated to
the bottom of the glass; and the supernatant fluid will be pure
hydrocyanic acid, one sip of which will kill you like a
thunderbolt.</p>

<p>EPIFANIA <i>[fingering the prescription rather disconcertedly]</i>
You seem to take my death very coolly, Mr Sagamore.</p>

<p>SAGAMORE. I am used to it.</p>

<p>EPIFANIA. Do you mean to tell me that you have so many clients
driven to despair that you keep a prescription for them?</p>

<p>SAGAMORE. I do. It's infallible.</p>

<p>EPIFANIA. You are sure that they have all died painlessly and
instantaneously?</p>

<p>SAGAMORE. No. They are all alive.</p>

<p>EPIFANIA. Alive! The prescription is a harmless fraud!</p>

<p>SAGAMORE. No. It's a deadly poison. But they dont take it.</p>

<p>EPIFANIA. Why?</p>

<p>SAGAMORE. I dont know. But they never do.</p>

<p>EPIFANIA. I will. And I hope you will be hanged for giving it to
me.</p>

<p>SAGAMORE. I am only acting as your solicitor. You say you are
going to commit suicide; and you come to me for advice. I do my best
for you, so that you can die without wasting a lot of gas or jumping
into the Serpentine. Six and eightpence I shall charge your
executors.</p>

<p>EPIFANIA. For advising me how to kill myself!</p>

<p>SAGAMORE. Not today. Tomorrow.</p>

<p>EPIFANIA. Why put it off until tomorrow?</p>

<p>SAGAMORE. Well, it will do as well tomorrow as today. And
something amusing may happen this evening. Or even tomorrow evening.
Theres no hurry.</p>

<p>EPIFANIA. You are a brute, a beast, and a pig. My life is nothing
to you: you do not even ask what has driven me to this. You make
money out of the death of your clients.</p>

<p>SAGAMORE. I do. There will be a lot of business connected with
your death. Alastair is sure to come to settle your affairs.</p>

<p>EPIFANIA. And you expect me to kill myself to make money for
you?</p>

<p>SAGAMORE. Well, it is you who have raised my expectations,
madam.</p>

<p>EPIFANIA. O God, listen to this man! Has it ever occurred to you
that when a woman's life is wrecked she needs a little sympathy and
not a bottle of poison?</p>

<p>SAGAMORE. I really cant sympathize with suicide. It doesnt appeal
to me, somehow. Still, if it has to be done, it had better be done
promptly and scientifically.</p>

<p>EPIFANIA. You dont even ask what Alastair has done to me?</p>

<p>SAGAMORE. It wont matter what he has done to you when you are
dead. Why bother about it?</p>

<p>EPIFANIA. You are an unmitigated hog, Julius Sagamore.</p>

<p>SAGAMORE. Why worry about me? The prescription will cure
everything.</p>

<p>EPIFANIA. Damn your prescription. There! <i>[She tears it up and
throws the pieces in his face].</i></p>

<p>SAGAMORE <i>[beaming]</i> It's infallible. And now that you have
blown off steam, suppose you sit down and tell me all about it.</p>

<p>EPIFANIA. You call the outcry of an anguished heart blowing off
steam, do you?</p>

<p>SAGAMORE. Well, what else would you call it?</p>

<p>EPIFANIA. You are not a man: you are a rhinoceros. You are also a
fool.</p>

<p>SAGAMORE. I am only a solicitor.</p>

<p>EPIFANIA. You are a rotten solicitor. You are not a gentleman. You
insult me in my distress. You back up my husband against me. You have
no decency, no understanding. You are a fish with the soul of a
black-beetle. Do you hear?</p>

<p>SAGAMORE. Yes: I hear. And I congratulate myself on the number of
actions for libel I shall have to defend if you do me the honor of
making me your solicitor.</p>

<p>EPIFANIA. You are wrong. I never utter a libel. My father
instructed me most carefully in the law of libel. If I questioned
your solvency, that would be a libel. If I suggested that you are
unfaithful to your wife, that would be a libel. But if I call you a
rhinoceros--which you are: a most unmitigated rhinoceros--that is
only vulgar abuse. I take good care to confine myself to vulgar
abuse; and I have never had an action for libel taken against me. Is
that the law, or is it not?</p>

<p>SAGAMORE. I really dont know. I will look it up in my law
books.</p>

<p>EPIFANIA. You need not. I instruct you that it is the law. My
father always had to instruct his lawyers in the law whenever he did
anything except what everybody was doing every day. Solicitors know
nothing of law: they are only good at practice, as they call it. My
father was a great man: every day of his life he did things that
nobody else ever dreamt of doing. I am not, perhaps, a great woman;
but I am his daughter; and as such I am an unusual woman. You will
take the law from me and do exactly what I tell you to do.</p>

<p>SAGAMORE. That will simplify our relations considerably,
madam.</p>

<p>EPIFANIA. And remember this. I have no sense of humor. I will not
be laughed at.</p>

<p>SAGAMORE. I should not dream of laughing at a client with an
income of three quarters of a million.</p>

<p>EPIFANIA. Have you a sense of humor?</p>

<p>SAGAMORE. I try to keep it in check; but I am afraid I have a
little. You appeal to it, somehow.</p>

<p>EPIFANIA. Then I tell you in cold blood, after the most careful
consideration of my words, that you are a heartless blackguard. My
distress, my disgrace, my humiliation, the horrible mess and failure
I have made of my life seem to you merely funny. If it were not that
my father warned me never to employ a solicitor who had no sense of
humor I would walk out of this office and deprive you of a client
whose business may prove a fortune to you.</p>

<p>SAGAMORE. But, my dear lady, I dont know anything about your
distress, your disgrace, the mess you have made of your life and all
the rest of it. How can I laugh at things I dont know? If I am
laughing--and am I really laughing?--I assure you I am laughing, not
at your misfortunes, but at you.</p>

<p>EPIFANIA. Indeed? Am I so comic a figure in my misery?</p>

<p>SAGAMORE. But what is your misery? Do, pray, sit down.</p>

<p>EPIFANIA. You seem to have one idea in your head, and that is to
get your clients to sit down. Well, to oblige you. <i>[She sits down
with a flounce. The back of the chair snaps off short with a loud
crack. She springs up].</i> Oh, I cannot even sit down in a chair
without wrecking it. There is a curse on me.</p>

<p>SAGAMORE <i>[collapses on the table, shaking with uncontrollable
laughter]!</i>!!!!!</p>

<p>EPIFANIA. Ay: laugh, laugh, laugh. Fool! Clown!</p>

<p>SAGAMORE <i>[rising resolutely and fetching another chair from the
wall]</i> My best faked Chippendale gone. It cost me four guineas.
<i>[Placing the chair for her]</i> Now will you please sit down as
gently as you can, and stop calling me names? Then, if you wish, you
can tell me what on earth is the matter. <i>[He picks up the
broken-off back of the chair and puts it on the table].</i></p>

<p>EPIFANIA <i>[sitting down with dignity]</i> The breaking of that
chair has calmed and relieved me, somehow. I feel as if I had broken
your neck, as I wanted to. Now listen to me. <i>[He comes to her and
looks down gravely at her].</i> And dont stand over me like that. Sit
down on what is left of your sham Chippendale.</p>

<p>SAGAMORE. Certainly <i>[he sits].</i> Now go ahead.</p>

<p>EPIFANIA. My father was the greatest man in the world. I was his
only child. His one dread was that I should make a foolish marriage,
and lose the little money he was able to leave me.</p>

<p>SAGAMORE. The thirty millions. Precisely.</p>

<p>EPIFANIA. Don't interrupt me. He made me promise that whenever a
man asked me to marry him I should impose a condition on my
consent.</p>

<p>SAGAMORE <i>[attentive]</i> So? What condition?</p>

<p>EPIFANIA. I was to give him one hundred and fifty pounds, and tell
him that if within six months he had turned that hundred and fifty
pounds into fifty thousand, I was his. If not, I was never to see him
again. I saw the wisdom of this. Nobody but my father could have
thought of such a real, infallible, unsentimental test. I gave him my
sacred promise that I would carry it out faithfully.</p>

<p>SAGAMORE. And you broke that promise. I see.</p>

<p>EPIFANIA. What do you mean--broke that promise?</p>

<p>SAGAMORE. Well, you married Alastair. Now Alastair is a dear good
fellow--one of the best in his way--but you are not going to persuade
me that he made fifty thousand pounds in six months with a capital of
one hundred and fifty.</p>

<p>EPIFANIA. He did. Wise as my father was, he sometimes forgot the
wise things he said five minutes after he said them. He warned me
that ninety per cent of our self-made millionaires are criminals who
have taken a five hundred to one chance and got away with it by pure
luck. Well, Alastair was that sort of criminal.</p>

<p>SAGAMORE. No no: not a criminal. That is not like Alastair. A
fool, perhaps, in business. But not a criminal.</p>

<p>EPIFANIA. Like all solicitors you think you know more about my
husband than I do. Well, I tell you that Alastair came back to me
after six months probation with fifty thousand pounds in his pocket
instead of the penal servitude he richly deserved. That man's luck is
extraordinary. He always wins. He wins at tennis. He wins at boxing.
He won me, the richest heiress in England.</p>

<p>SAGAMORE. But you were a consenting party. If not, why did you put
him to the test? Why did you give him the hundred and fifty to try
his luck with?</p>

<p>EPIFANIA. Boxing.</p>

<p>SAGAMORE. Boxing?</p>

<p>EPIFANIA. His boxing fascinated me. My father held that women
should be able to defend themselves. He made me study Judo.</p>

<p>SAGAMORE. Judo? Do you mean Hebrew?</p>

<p>EPIFANIA. Hebrew! Nonsense! Judo is what ignorant people call
jujitsu. I could throw you through that window as easily as you
handed me that rotten chair.</p>

<p>SAGAMORE. Oh! Japanese wrestling. Rather a rough sport for a lady,
isnt it?</p>

<p>EPIFANIA. How dare you call Judo a sport? It is a religion.</p>

<p>SAGAMORE <i>[collapsing]</i> Forgive me. Go on with your story.
And please break it to me as gently as you can. I have never had a
client like you before.</p>

<p>EPIFANIA. You never will again.</p>

<p>SAGAMORE. I dont doubt it for a moment. Now tell me: where does
Alastair come in?</p>

<p>EPIFANIA. I saw him win an amateur heavy weight championship. He
has a solar plexus punch that no other boxer can withstand.</p>

<p>SAGAMORE. And you married a man because he had a superlative solar
plexus punch!</p>

<p>EPIFANIA. Well, he was handsome. He stripped well, unlike many
handsome men. I am not insusceptible to sex appeal, very far from
it.</p>

<p>SAGAMORE <i>[hastily]</i> Oh quite, quite: you need not go into
details.</p>

<p>EPIFANIA. I will if I like. It is your business as a solicitor to
know the details. I made a very common mistake. I thought that this
irresistible athlete would be an ardent lover. He was nothing of the
kind. All his ardor was in his fists. Never shall I forget the
day--it was during our honeymoon--when his coldness infuriated me to
such a degree that I went for him with my fists. He knocked me out
with that abominable punch in the first exchange. Have you ever been
knocked out by a punch in the solar plexus?</p>

<p>SAGAMORE. No, thank heaven. I am not a pugilist.</p>

<p>EPIFANIA. It does not put you to sleep like a punch on the jaw.
When he saw my face distorted with agony and my body writhing on the
floor, he was horrified. He said he did it automatically--that he
always countered that way, by instinct. I almost respected him for
it.</p>

<p>SAGAMORE. Then why do you want to get rid of him?</p>

<p>EPIFANIA. I want to get rid of myself. I want to punish myself for
making a mess of my life and marrying an imbecile. I, Epifania
Ognisanti di Parerga, saw myself as the most wonderful woman in
England marrying the most wonderful man. And I was only a goose
marrying a buck rabbit. What was there for me but death? And now you
have put me off it with your fooling; and I dont know what I want.
That is a horrible state of mind. I am a woman who must always want
something and always get it.</p>

<p>SAGAMORE. An acquisitive woman. Precisely. How splendid! <i>[The
telephone rings. He rises].</i> Excuse me. <i>[He goes to the table
and listens]</i> Yes? . . . <i>[Hastily]</i> One moment. Hold the
line. <i>[To Epifania]</i> Your husband is downstairs, with a woman.
They want to see me.</p>

<p>EPIFANIA <i>[rising]</i> That woman! Have them up at once.</p>

<p>SAGAMORE. But can I depend on you to control yourself?</p>

<p>EPIFANIA. You can depend on Alastair's fists. I must have a look
at Seedystockings. Have them up, I tell you.</p>

<p>SAGAMORE <i>[into the telephone]</i> Send Mr Fitzfassenden and the
lady up.</p>

<p>EPIFANIA. We shall see now the sort of woman for whom he has
deserted ME!</p>

<p>SAGAMORE. I am thrilled. I expect something marvellous.</p>

<p>EPIFANIA. Dont be a fool. Expect something utterly common.</p>

<p><i>Alastair Fitzfassenden and Patricia Smith come in. He is a
splendid athlete, with most of his brains in his muscles. She is a
pleasant quiet little woman of the self-supporting type. She makes
placidly for the table, leaving Alastair to deal with his
wife.</i></p>

<p>ALASTAIR. Eppy! What are you doing here? <i>[To Sagamore]</i> Why
didn't you tell me?</p>

<p>EPIFANIA. Introduce the female.</p>

<p>PATRICIA. Patricia Smith is my name, Mrs Fitzfassenden.</p>

<p>EPIFANIA. That is not how you sign your letters, I think.</p>

<p>ALASTAIR. Look here, Eppy. Dont begin making a row--</p>

<p>EPIFANIA. I was not speaking to you. I was speaking to the
woman.</p>

<p>ALASTAIR <i>[losing his temper]</i> You have no right to call her
a woman.</p>

<p>PATRICIA. Now, now, Ally: you promised me--</p>

<p>EPIFANIA. Promised you! What right had he to promise you? How dare
he promise you? How dare you make him promise you?</p>

<p>ALASTAIR. I wont have Polly insulted.</p>

<p>SAGAMORE <i>[goodhumoredly]</i> You dont mind, Miss Smith, do
you?</p>

<p>PATRICIA <i>[unconcerned]</i> Oh, I dont mind. My sister goes on
just like that.</p>

<p>EPIFANIA. Your sister! You presume to compare your sister to
me!</p>

<p>PATRICIA. Only when she goes off at the deep end. You mustnt mind
me: theres nothing like letting yourself go if you are built that
way. Introduce me to the gentleman, Ally.</p>

<p>ALASTAIR. Oh, I forgot. Julius Sagamore, my solicitor. An old pal.
Miss Smith.</p>

<p>EPIFANIA. Alias Polly Seedystockings.</p>

<p>PATRICIA. Thats only my pet name, Mr Sagamore. Smith is the
patronymic, as dear wise old father says.</p>

<p>EPIFANIA. She sets up a wise father! This is the last straw.</p>

<p>SAGAMORE. Do sit down, Miss Smith, wont you? <i>[He goes to fetch
a chair from the wall].</i></p>

<p>PATRICIA <i>[contemplating the wrecked chair]</i> Hallo! Whats
happened to the chair?</p>

<p>EPIFANIA. <i>I</i> have happened to the chair. Let it be a warning
to you.</p>

<p><i>Sagamore places the chair for Patricia next the table. Alastair
shoves the broken chair back out of the way with his foot; fetches
another from the wall, and is about to sit on it next Patricia when
Epifania sits on it and motions him to her own chair, so that she is
seated between the two, Patricia on her left, Alastair on her right,
Sagamore goes back to his official place at the table.</i></p>

<p>PATRICIA. You see, Mr Sagamore, it's like this. Alastair--</p>

<p>EPIFANIA. You need not explain. I have explained everything to Mr
Sagamore. And you will please have the decency in his presence and in
mine to speak of my husband as Mr Fitzfassenden. His Christian name
is no business of yours.</p>

<p>ALASTAIR <i>[angry]</i> Of course, Eppy, if you wont let anybody
speak--</p>

<p>EPIFANIA. I am not preventing you nor anybody from speaking. If
you have anything to say for yourself, say it.</p>

<p>PATRICIA. I am sorry. But it's such a long name. In my little
circle everyone calls him just Ally.</p>

<p>EPIFANIA <i>[her teeth on edge]</i> You hear this, Mr Sagamore! My
husband is called 'Ally' by these third rate people! What right have
they to speak of him at all? Am I to endure this?</p>

<p>PATRICIA <i>[soothingly]</i> Yes: we know you have to put up with
a lot, deary;--</p>

<p>EPIFANIA. <i>[stamping]</i> Deary!!!</p>

<p>PATRICIA <i>[continuing]</i>--but thats what the world is
like.</p>

<p>EPIFANIA. The world is like that to people who are like that. Your
world is not my world. Every woman has her own world within her own
soul. Listen to me, Mr Sagamore. I married this man. I admitted him
to my world, the world which my imagination had peopled with heroes
and saints. Never before had a real man been permitted to enter it. I
took him to be hero, saint, lover all in one. What he really was you
can see for yourself.</p>

<p>ALASTAIR <i>[jumping up with his fists clenched and his face
red]</i> I am damned if I stand this.</p>

<p>EPIFANIA <i>[rising and facing him in the pose of a martyr]</i>
Yes: strike me. Shew her your knock-out punch. Let her see how you
treat women.</p>

<p>ALASTAIR <i>[baffled]</i> Damn! <i>[He sits down again].</i></p>

<p>PATRICIA. Dont get rattled, Ally: you will only put yourself in
the wrong before Mr Sagamore. I think youd better go home and leave
me to have it out with her.</p>

<p>EPIFANIA. Will you have the goodness not to speak of me as 'her'?
I am Mrs Fitzfassenden. I am not a pronoun. <i>[She resumes her seat
haughtily].</i></p>

<p>PATRICIA. Sorry; but your name is such a tonguetwister. Mr
Sagamore: dont you think Ally had better go? It's not right that we
should sit here arguing about him to his face. Besides, he's worn
out: he's hardly slept all night.</p>

<p>EPIFANIA. How do you know that, pray?</p>

<p>PATRICIA. Never mind how I know it. I do.</p>

<p>ALASTAIR. It was quite innocent; but where could I go to when you
drove me out of the house by your tantrums?</p>

<p>EPIFANIA <i>[most unexpectedly amused]</i> You went to her?</p>

<p>ALASTAIR. I went to Miss Smith: she's not a pronoun, you know. I
went where I could find peace and kindness, to my good sweet darling
Polly. So there!</p>

<p>EPIFANIA. I have no sense of humor; but this strikes me as
irresistibly funny. You actually left ME to spend the night in the
arms of Miss Seedystockings!</p>

<p>ALASTAIR. No, I tell you. It was quite innocent.</p>

<p>EPIFANIA <i>[to Patricia]</i> Was he in your arms or was he
not?</p>

<p>PATRICIA. Well, yes, of course he was for a while. But not in the
way you mean.</p>

<p>EPIFANIA. Then he is even a more sexless fish than I took him for.
But really a man capable of flouncing out of the house when I was on
the point of pardoning him and giving him a night of legitimate bliss
would be capable of any imbecility.</p>

<p>ALASTAIR. Pardoning me! Pardoning me for what? What had I done
when you flew out at me?</p>

<p>EPIFANIA. I did not fly out at you. I have never lost my dignity
even under the most insufferable wrongs.</p>

<p>ALASTAIR. You hadnt any wrongs. You drove me out of the
house--</p>

<p>EPIFANIA. I did not. I never meant you to go. It was abominably
selfish of you. You had your Seedystockings to go to; but I had
nobody. Adrian was out of town.</p>

<p>SAGAMORE. Adrian! This is a new complication. Who is Adrian?</p>

<p>PATRICIA. Adrian is Mrs Fitzfassenden's Sunday husband, Mr
Sagamore.</p>

<p>EPIFANIA. My what, did you say?</p>

<p>PATRICIA. Your Sunday husband. You understand. What Mr Adrian
Blenderbland is to you, as it were. What Ally is to me.</p>

<p>SAGAMORE. I dont quite follow. What is Mr Blenderbland to you, Mrs
Fitzfassenden, if I may ask?</p>

<p>EPIFANIA. Well, he is a gentleman with whom I discuss subjects
that are beyond my husband's mental grasp, which is extremely
limited.</p>

<p>ALASTAIR. A chap that sets up to be an intellectual because his
father was a publisher! He makes up to Eppy and pretends to be in
love with her because she has a good cook; but I tell her he cares
for nothing but his food. He always calls at mealtimes. A bellygod, I
call him. And I am expected to put up with him. But if I as much as
look at Polly! Oh my!</p>

<p>EPIFANIA. The cases are quite different. Adrian worships the
ground I tread on: that is quite true. But if you think that
Seedystockings worships the ground you tread on, you flatter yourself
grossly. She endures you and pets you because you buy stockings for
her, and no doubt anything else she may be short of.</p>

<p>PATRICIA. Well, I never contradict anyone, because it only makes
trouble. And I am afraid I do cost him a good deal; for he likes me
to have nice things that I cant afford.</p>

<p>ALASTAIR <i>[affectionately]</i> No, Polly: you dont. Youre as
good as gold. I'm always pressing things on you that you wont take.
Youre a jolly sight more careful of my money than I am myself.</p>

<p>EPIFANIA. How touching! You are the Sunday wife, I suppose.</p>

<p>PATRICIA. No: I should say that you are the Sunday wife, Mrs
Fitzfassenden. It's I that have to look after his clothes and make
him get his hair cut.</p>

<p>EPIFANIA. Surely the creature is intelligent enough to do at least
that much for himself.</p>

<p>PATRICIA. You dont understand men: they get interested in other
things and neglect themselves unless they have a woman to look after
them. You see, Mr Sagamore, it's like this. There are two sorts of
people in the world: the people anyone can live with and the people
that no one can live with. The people that no one can live with may
be very goodlooking and vital and splendid and temperamental and
romantic and all that; and they can make a man or woman happy for
half an hour when they are pleased with themselves and disposed to be
agreeable; but if you try to live with them they just eat up your
whole life running after them or quarrelling or attending to them one
way or another: you cant call your soul your own. As Sunday husbands
and wives, just to have a good tearing bit of love-making with, or a
blazing row, or mostly one on top of the other, once a month or so,
theyre all right. But as everyday partners theyre just
impossible.</p>

<p>EPIFANIA. So I am the Sunday wife. <i>[To Patricia,
scornfully]</i> And what are you, pray?</p>

<p>PATRICIA. Well, I am the angel in the house, if you follow me.</p>

<p>ALASTAIR <i>[blubbering]</i> You are, dear: you are.</p>

<p>EPIFANIA <i>[to Patricia]</i> You are his doormat: thats what you
are.</p>

<p>PATRICIA. Doormats are very useful things if you want the house
kept tidy, dear.</p>

<p><i>The telephone rings. Sagamore attends to it.</i></p>

<p>SAGAMORE. Yes? . . . Did you say Blenderbland?</p>

<p>EPIFANIA. Adrian! How did he know I was here?</p>

<p>SAGAMORE. Ask the gentleman to wait. <i>[He hangs up the
receiver].</i> Perhaps you can tell me something about him, Mrs
Fitzfassenden. Is he the chairman of Blenderbland's Literary
Pennyworths?</p>

<p>EPIFANIA. No. That is his father, who created the business. Adrian
is on the board; but he has no business ability. He is on fifteen
boards of directors on the strength of his father's reputation, and
has never, as far as I know, contributed an idea to any of them.</p>

<p>ALASTAIR. Be fair to him, Eppy. No man in London knows how to
order a dinner better. That's what keeps him at the top in the
city.</p>

<p>SAGAMORE. Thank you: I think I have his measure sufficiently.
Shall I have him up?</p>

<p>EPIFANIA. Certainly. I want to know what he is doing here.</p>

<p>ALASTAIR. I dont mind. You understand, of course, that I am not
supposed to know anything of his relations with my wife, whatever
they may be.</p>

<p>EPIFANIA. They are perfectly innocent, so far. I am not quite
convinced that I love Adrian. He makes himself agreeable: that is
all.</p>

<p>SAGAMORE <i>[into the telephone]</i> Send Mr Blenderbland up.
<i>[He hangs up the instrument].</i></p>

<p>ALASTAIR <i>[to Patricia]</i> You will now see the blighter who
has cut me out with Eppy.</p>

<p>PATRICIA. I cant imagine any man cutting you out with any woman,
dear.</p>

<p>EPIFANIA. Will you be good enough to restrain your endearments
when he comes in?</p>

<p><i>Adrian Blenderbland, an imposing man in the prime of life,
bearded in the Victorian literary fashion, rather handsome, and well
dressed, comes in. Sagamore rises. Adrian is startled when he sees
the company, but recovers his aplomb at once, and advances
smiling.</i></p>

<p>ADRIAN. Hallo! Where have we all come from? Good morning, Mrs
Fitzfassenden. How do, Alastair? Mr Sagamore, I presume. I did not
know you were engaged.</p>

<p>SAGAMORE. Your arrival is quite opportune, sir. Will you have the
goodness to sit down? <i>[He takes a chair from the wall and places
it at the table, on his own right and Patricia's left].</i></p>

<p>ADRIAN <i>[sitting down]</i> Thank you. I hope I am not
interrupting this lady.</p>

<p>PATRICIA. Not at all. Dont mind me.</p>

<p>SAGAMORE <i>[introducing]</i> Miss Smith, an intimate friend of Mr
Fitzfassenden.</p>

<p>PATRICIA. Pleased to meet you, I'm sure.</p>

<p><i>Adrian bows to her; then turns to Sagamore.</i></p>

<p>ADRIAN. The fact is, Mrs Fitzfassenden mentioned your name to me
in conversation as her choice of a new solicitor. So I thought I
could not place myself in better hands.</p>

<p>SAGAMORE <i>[bowing]</i> Thank you, sir. But--excuse me--had you
not a solicitor of your own?</p>

<p>ADRIAN. My dear Mr Sagamore: never be content with a single
opinion. When I feel ill I always consult at least half a dozen
doctors. The variety of their advice and prescriptions convinces me
that I had better cure myself. When a legal point arises I consult
six solicitors, with much the same--</p>

<p>EPIFANIA. Adrian: I have no sense of humor; and you know how it
annoys me when you talk the sort of nonsense that is supposed to be
funny. Did you come here to consult Mr Sagamore about me?</p>

<p>ADRIAN. I did. But of course I expected to find him alone.</p>

<p>SAGAMORE. Has the matter on which you wish to consult me any
reference to Mr Fitzfassenden's family circle?</p>

<p>ADRIAN. It has.</p>

<p>SAGAMORE. Is it of such a nature that sooner or later it will have
to be discussed with all the adult members of that circle?</p>

<p>ADRIAN. Well, yes: I suppose so. But hadnt we better talk it over
a little in private first?</p>

<p>EPIFANIA. You shall do nothing of the sort. I will not have my
affairs discussed by anybody in public or in private. They concern
myself alone.</p>

<p>ADRIAN. May I not discuss my own affairs?</p>

<p>EPIFANIA. Not with my solicitor. I will not have it.</p>

<p>ALASTAIR. Now she is off at the deep end again. We may as well go
home.</p>

<p>EPIFANIA <i>[restlessly rising]</i> Oh, the deep end! the deep
end! What is life if it is not lived at the deep end? Alastair: you
are a tadpole. <i>[She seizes his head and ruffles his hair as she
passes him].</i></p>

<p>ALASTAIR. Dont do that. <i>[He tries to smooth his hair].</i></p>

<p>EPIFANIA <i>[to Patricia]</i> Smooth it for him, angel in the
house.</p>

<p>PATRICIA <i>[moving to Epifania's chair and doing so]</i> You
shouldnt make a sight of him like that.</p>

<p>SAGAMORE. Mr Fitzfassenden: why did you marry Mrs
Fitzfassenden?</p>

<p>EPIFANIA. Why!!! Does that require any explanation? I have told
you why <i>I</i> married him.</p>

<p>ALASTAIR. Well, though you mightnt think it, she can be
frightfully fascinating when she really wants to be.</p>

<p>EPIFANIA. Why might he not think it? What do you mean?</p>

<p>ALASTAIR. He knows what I mean.</p>

<p>EPIFANIA. Some silly joke, I suppose.</p>

<p>ADRIAN. Dont be absurd, Fitzfassenden. Your wife is the most
adorable woman on earth.</p>

<p>EPIFANIA. Not here, Adrian. If you are going to talk like that,
take me away to some place where we can be alone.</p>

<p>ALASTAIR. Do, for heaven's sake, before she drives us all
crazy.</p>

<p>SAGAMORE. Steady! steady! I hardly know where I am. You are all
consulting me; but none of you has given me any instructions. Had you
not better all be divorced?</p>

<p>EPIFANIA. What is the creature to live on? He has nothing: he
would have had to become a professional boxer or tennis player if his
uncle had not pushed him into an insurance office, where he was
perfectly useless.</p>

<p>ALASTAIR. Look here, Eppy: Sagamore doesnt want to hear all
this.</p>

<p>EPIFANIA. He does. He shall. Be silent. When Alastair proposed to
me--he was too great an idiot to comprehend his own audacity--I kept
my promise to my father. I handed him a cheque for a hundred and
fifty pounds. 'Make that into fifty thousand within six months' I
said 'and I am yours.'</p>

<p>ADRIAN. You never told me this.</p>

<p>EPIFANIA. Why should I? It is a revolting story.</p>

<p>ALASTAIR. What is there revolting about it? Did I make good or did
I not? Did I go through hell to get that money and win you or did I
not?</p>

<p>ADRIAN <i>[amazed]</i> Do I understand you to say, Alastair, that
you made fifty thousand pounds in six months?</p>

<p>ALASTAIR. Why not?</p>

<p>EPIFANIA. You may well look incredulous, Adrian. But he did. Yes:
this imbecile made fifty thousand pounds and won Epifania Ognisanti
di Parerga for his bride. You will not believe me when I tell you
that the possession of all that money, and the consciousness of
having made it himself, gave him a sort of greatness. I am impulsive:
I kept my word and married him instantly. Then, too late, I found out
how he had made it.</p>

<p>ALASTAIR. Well, how did I make it? By my own brains.</p>

<p>EPIFANIA. Brains! By your own folly, your ignorance, your criminal
instincts, and the luck that attends the half-witted. You won my
hand, for which all Europe was on its knees to me. What you deserved
was five years penal servitude.</p>

<p>ALASTAIR. Five years! Fifteen, more likely. That was what I risked
for you. And what did I get by it? Life with you was worse than any
penal servitude.</p>

<p>EPIFANIA. It would have been heaven to you if Nature had fitted
you for such a companionship as mine. But what was it for me? No man
had been good enough for me. I was like a princess in a fairy tale
offering all men alive my hand and fortune if they could turn my
hundred and fifty pound cheque into fifty thousand within six months.
Able men, brilliant men, younger sons of the noblest families either
refused the test or failed. Why? Because they were too honest or too
proud. This thing succeeded; and I found myself tied for life to an
insect.</p>

<p>ALASTAIR. You may say what you like; but you were just as much in
love with me as I was with you.</p>

<p>EPIFANIA. Well, you were young; you were well shaped, your lawn
tennis was outstanding; you were a magnificent boxer; and I was
excited by physical contact with you.</p>

<p>SAGAMORE. Is it necessary to be so very explicit, Mrs
Fitzfassenden?</p>

<p>EPIFANIA. Julius Sagamore: you may be made of sawdust; but I am
made of flesh and blood. Alastair is physically attractive: that is
my sole excuse for having married him. Will you have the face to
pretend that he has any mental charm?</p>

<p>ADRIAN. But how did he make the fifty thousand pounds? Was it on
the Stock Exchange?</p>

<p>EPIFANIA. Nonsense! the creature does not know the difference
between a cumulative preference and a deferred ordinary. He would not
know even how to begin.</p>

<p>ADRIAN. But how did he begin? My bank balance at present is
somewhere about a hundred and fifty. I should very much like to know
how to make it up to fifty thousand. You are so rich, Epifania, that
every decent man who approaches you feels like a needy adventurer.
You dont know how a man to whom a hundred pounds is a considerable
sum feels in the arms of a woman to whom a million is mere pin
money.</p>

<p>EPIFANIA. Nor do you know what it feels like to be in the arms of
a man and know that you could buy him up twenty times over and never
miss the price.</p>

<p>ADRIAN. If I give you my hundred and fifty pounds, will you invest
it for me?</p>

<p>EPIFANIA. It is not worth investing. You cannot make money on the
Stock Exchange until your weekly account is at least seventy
thousand. Do not meddle with money, Adrian: you do not understand it.
I will give you all you need.</p>

<p>ADRIAN. No, thank you: I should lose my self-respect. I prefer the
poor man's luxury of paying for your cabs and flowers and theatre
tickets and lunches at the Ritz, and lending you all the little sums
you have occasion for when we are together.</p>

<p><i>The rest all stare at this light on Epifania's habits.</i></p>

<p>EPIFANIA. It is quite true: I never have any pocket money: I must
owe you millions in odd five pound notes. I will tell my bankers that
you want a thousand on account.</p>

<p>ADRIAN. But I dont. I love lending you fivers. Only, as they run
through my comparatively slender resources at an appalling rate, I
should honestly like a few lessons from Alastair in the art of
turning hundreds into tens of thousands.</p>

<p>EPIFANIA. His example would be useless to you, Adrian, because
Alastair is one of Nature's marvels; and there is nothing marvellous
about you except your appetite. Listen. On each of his birthdays his
aunt had presented him with a gramophone record of the singing of the
celebrated tenor Enrico Caruso. Now it so happens that Nature, in one
of her most unaccountable caprices, has endowed Alastair with a
startlingly loud singing voice of almost supernatural range. He can
sing high notes never before attained by mortal man. He found that he
could imitate gramophone records with the greatest facility; and he
became convinced that he could make a fortune as an operatic tenor.
The first use he made of my money was to give fifty pounds to the
manager of some trumpery little opera company which was then on its
last legs in the suburbs to allow him to appear for one night in one
of Caruso's most popular roles. He actually took me to hear his
performance.</p>

<p>ALASTAIR. It wasnt my fault. I can sing Caruso's head off. It was
a plot. The regular tenor of the company: a swine that could hardly
reach B flat without breaking his neck, paid a lot of blackguards to
go into the gallery and boo me.</p>

<p>EPIFANIA. My dear Alastair, the simple truth is that Nature, when
she endowed you with your amazing voice, unfortunately omitted to
provide you with a musical ear. You can bellow loudly enough to drown
ten thousand bulls; but you are always at least a quarter tone sharp
or flat as the case may be. I laughed until I fell on the floor of my
box in screaming hysterics. The audience hooted and booed; but they
could not make themselves heard above your roaring. At last the
chorus dragged you off the stage; and the regular tenor finished the
performance only to find that the manager had absconded with my fifty
pounds and left the whole company penniless. The prima donna was deaf
in the left ear, into which you had sung with all your force. I had
to pay all their salaries and send them home.</p>

<p>ALASTAIR. I tell you it was a plot. Why shouldnt people like my
singing? I can sing louder than any tenor on the stage. I can sing
higher.</p>

<p>EPIFANIA. Alastair: you cannot resist a plot when the whole world
is a party to it.</p>

<p>ADRIAN. Still, this does not explain how Alastair made the fifty
thousand pounds.</p>

<p>EPIFANIA. I leave him to tell that disgraceful tale himself. I
believe he is proud of it. <i>[She sits down disdainfully in the
vacant chair].</i></p>

<p>ALASTAIR. Well, it worked out all right. But it was a near thing,
I tell you. What I did was this. I had a hundred pounds left after
the opera stunt. I met an American. I told him I was crazy about a
woman who wouldn't marry me unless I made fifty thousand in six
months, and that I had only a hundred pounds in the world. He jumped
up and said 'Why, man alive, if you have a hundred you can open a
bank account and get a cheque book,' I said 'What good is a cheque
book?' He said 'Are we partners, fifty fifty?' So I said yes: what
else could I say? That very day we started in. We lodged the money
and got a book of a hundred cheques. We took a theatre. We engaged a
first rate cast. We got a play. We got a splendid production: the
scenery was lovely: the girls were lovely: the principal woman was an
angry-eyed creature with a queer foreign voice and a Hollywood
accent, just the sort the public loves. We never asked the price of
anything: we just went in up to our necks for thousands and
thousands.</p>

<p>ADRIAN. But how did you pay for all these things?</p>

<p>ALASTAIR. With our cheques, of course. Didn't I tell you we had a
cheque book?</p>

<p>ADRIAN. But when the hundred was gone the cheques must have been
dishonored.</p>

<p>ALASTAIR. Not one of them. We kited them all. But it was a
heartbreaking job.</p>

<p>ADRIAN. I dont understand. What does kiting mean?</p>

<p>SAGAMORE. It is quite simple. You pay for something with a cheque
after the banks have closed for the day: if on Saturday or just
before a bank holiday all the better. Say the cheque is for a hundred
pounds and you have not a penny at the bank. You must then induce a
friend or a hotel manager to cash another cheque for one hundred
pounds for you. That provides for the previous cheque; but it obliges
you, on pain of eighteen months hard labour, to induce another friend
or hotel manager to cash another cheque for you for two hundred
pounds. And so you go on spending and kiting from hundreds to
thousands and from risks of eighteen months imprisonment to five
years, ten years, fourteen years even.</p>

<p>ALASTAIR. If you think that was an easy job, just try it yourself:
thats all. I dream of it sometimes: it's my worst nightmare. Why, my
partner and I never saw that theatre! never saw that play! until the
first night: we were signing cheques and kiting them all the time. Of
course, it was easier after a while, because as we paid our way all
right we found it easier to get credit; and the biggest expenses
didnt come until after the play was produced and the money was coming
in. I could have done it for half the money; but the American could
only keep himself up to the excitement of it by paying twice as much
as we needed for everything and shoving shares in it on people for
nothing but talk. But it didnt matter when the money began to come
in. My! how it did come in! The whole town went mad about the
angry-eyed woman. It rained money in bucketsful. It went to my head
like drink. It went to the American's head. It went to the head of
the American's American friends. They bought all the rights: the film
rights, the translation rights, the touring rights, all sorts of
rights that I never knew existed, and began selling them to one
another until everybody in London and New York and Hollywood had a
rake-off on them. Then the American bought all the rights back for
five hundred thousand dollars, an I sold them to an American
syndicate for a million. It took six more Americans to do it; and
every one of then had to have a rake-off; but all I wanted was fifty
thousand pounds; and I cleared out with that and came swanking back
to claim Eppy's hand. She thought I was great. I was great: the money
made me great: I tell you I was drunk with it: I was another man. You
may believe it or not as you like; but my hats were really too small
for me.</p>

<p>EPIFANIA. It is quite true. The creature was not used to money;
and it transfigured him. I, poor innocent, had no suspicion that
money could work such miracles; for I had possessed millions in my
cradle; and it meant no more to me than the air I breathed.</p>

<p>SAGAMORE. But just now, when I suggested a divorce, you asked how
he was to live. What has become of the fifty thousand pounds?</p>

<p>EPIFANIA. He lost it all in three weeks. He bought a circus with
it. He thought everything he touched would turn into gold. I had to
liquidate that circus a month later. He was about to turn the wild
beasts loose and run away when I intervened. I was down four hundred
and thirty pounds sixteen and seven-pence by the transaction.</p>

<p>ALASTAIR. Was it my fault? The elephant got influenza. The
Ministry of Health closed me down and wouldnt let me move on because
the animals might carry foot-and-mouth disease.</p>

<p>EPIFANIA. At all events, the net result was that instead of his
being fifty thousand pounds to the good I was four hundred and thirty
pounds to the bad. Instead of bringing me the revenues of a prince
and a hero he cost me the allowance of a worm. And now he has the
audacity to ask for a divorce.</p>

<p>ALASTAIR. No I dont. It was Sagamore who suggested that. How can I
afford to let you divorce me? As your husband I enjoy a good deal of
social consideration; and the tradesmen give me unlimited credit.</p>

<p>EPIFANIA. For stockings, among other things.</p>

<p>PATRICIA. Oh <i>[she weeps]!</i> Does she pay for them, Ally?</p>

<p>ALASTAIR. Never mind, dear: I have shewn that I can make money
when I am put to it; and I will make it again and buy you all the
stockings you need out of my own earnings. <i>[He rises and goes
behind her chair to take her cheeks in his hands].</i> There,
darling: dont cry.</p>

<p>EPIFANIA. There! They think they are married already!</p>

<p>SAGAMORE. But the matter is not in your hands, Mr Fitzfassenden.
Mrs Fitzfassenden can divorce you whether you like it or not. The
evidence is that on a recent occasion you left your wife and took
refuge in the arms of Miss Smith. The Court will give Mrs
Fitzfassenden a decree on that.</p>

<p>PATRICIA <i>[consoled and plucky]</i> Well, let it. I can support
Alastair until he has time to make another fortune. You all think him
a fool; but he's a dear good boy; and it just disgusts me the way you
all turn against him, and the way his wife treats him as if he were
dirt under her feet. What would she be without her money, I'd like to
know?</p>

<p>EPIFANIA. Nobody is anybody without money, Seedystockings. My dear
old father taught me that. 'Stick to your money' he said 'and all the
other things shall be added unto you.' He said it was in the Bible. I
have never verified the quotation; but I have never forgotten it. I
have stuck to my money; and I shall continue to stick to it. Rich as
I am, I can hardly forgive Alastair for letting me down by four
hundred and thirty pounds.</p>

<p>ALASTAIR. Sixteen and sevenpence! Stingy beast. But I will pay
it.</p>

<p>PATRICIA. You shall, dear. I will sell out my insurance and give
it to you.</p>

<p>EPIFANIA. May I have that in writing, Miss Smith?</p>

<p>ALASTAIR. Oh, you ought to be ashamed of yourself, you greedy pig.
It was your own fault. Why did you let the elephant go for thirty
pounds? He cost two hundred.</p>

<p>SAGAMORE. Do not let us wander from the point.</p>

<p>EPIFANIA. What is the point, pray?</p>

<p>SAGAMORE. The point is that you can obtain a divorce if you
wish.</p>

<p>EPIFANIA. I dont wish. Do you think I am going to be dragged
through the divorce court and have my picture in the papers with that
thing? To have the story of my infatuation told in headlines in every
rag in London! Besides, it is convenient to be married. It is
respectable. It keeps other men off. It gives me a freedom that I
could not enjoy as a single woman. I have become accustomed to a
husband. No: decidedly I will not divorce Alastair--at least until I
can find a substitute whom I really want.</p>

<p>PATRICIA. You couldnt divorce him unless he chose to let you.
Alastair's too much the gentleman to mention it; but you know very
well that your own behavior hasnt been so very nunlike that you dare
have it shewn up in court.</p>

<p>EPIFANIA. Alastair was the first man I ever loved; and I hope he
will not be the last. But legal difficulties do not exist for people
with money. At all events, as Alastair cannot afford to divorce me,
and I have no intention of divorcing him, the question does not
arise. What o'clock is it?</p>

<p>ALASTAIR. I really think, Eppy, you might buy a wrist watch. I
have told you so over and over again.</p>

<p>EPIFANIA. Why should I go to the expense of buying a wrist watch
when everyone else has one; and I have nothing to do but ask? I have
not carried a watch since I lost the key of my father's old
repeater.</p>

<p>PATRICIA. It is ten minutes past twelve.</p>

<p>EPIFANIA. Gracious! I have missed my lesson. How annoying!</p>

<p>ALASTAIR. Your lesson? What are you learning now, may I ask?</p>

<p>EPIFANIA. All-in wrestling. When you next indulge in your favorite
sport of wife beating, look out for a surprise. What did I come here
for, Mr Sagamore?</p>

<p>SAGAMORE. To give me instructions about your will.</p>

<p>ALASTAIR. She makes a new will every time she loses her temper,
Sagamore. Jolly good business for you.</p>

<p>EPIFANIA. Do be quiet, Alastair. You forget the dignity of your
position as my husband. Mr Sagamore: I have changed my mind about my
will. And I shall overlook your attempt to poison me.</p>

<p>SAGAMORE. Thank you.</p>

<p>EPIFANIA. What do I owe you for this abortive consultation?</p>

<p>SAGAMORE. Thirteen and fourpence, if you please.</p>

<p>EPIFANIA. I do not carry money about with me. Adrian: can you lend
me thirteen and fourpence?</p>

<p>ADRIAN <i>[puts his hand in his pocket]</i>--</p>

<p>EPIFANIA. Stop. Mr Sagamore: you had better be my family solicitor
and send me your bill at the end of the year.</p>

<p>ALASTAIR. Send a County Court summons with it, Sagamore; or you
may go whistle for your money.</p>

<p>EPIFANIA. Do hold your tongue, Alastair. Of course I always wait
for a summons. It is a simple precaution against paying bills sent in
twice over.</p>

<p>SAGAMORE. Quite, Mrs Fitzfassenden. An excellent rule.</p>

<p>EPIFANIA. You are a man of sense, Mr Sagamore. And now I must have
some fresh air: this orgy of domesticity has made the room stuffy.
Come along, Adrian: we'll drive out into the country somewhere, and
lunch there. I know the quaintest little place up the river. Goodbye,
Mr Sagamore. Goodbye, Seedy: take care of Alastair for me. His good
looks will give you a pleasing sensation down your spine. <i>[She
goes out].</i></p>

<p>SAGAMORE <i>[as Adrian is following her out]</i> By the way, Mr
Blenderbland, what did you come for?</p>

<p>ADRIAN. I totally forget. I dont feel equal to any more this
morning. <i>[He goes out without further salutations].</i></p>

<p>SAGAMORE <i>[to Alastair]</i> Your wife is a most extraordinary
lady.</p>

<p>ALASTAIR <i>[utters a stifled howl]</i>!</p>

<p>PATRICIA. He cant find words for her, poor dear.</p>

<p>SAGAMORE. And now, Mr Fitzfassenden, may I ask what you came to
consult me about?</p>

<p>ALASTAIR. I dont know. After ten minutes of Eppy I never do know
whether I am standing on my head or my heels.</p>

<p>PATRICIA. It was about a separation. Pull yourself together a bit,
dear.</p>

<p>ALASTAIR. Separation! You might as well try to separate yourself
from a hurricane. <i>[He becomes sententious].</i> Listen to me,
Sagamore. I am one of those unfortunate people--you must know a lot
of them--I daresay many of them have sat in this chair and talked to
you as I am now talking to you--</p>

<p>SAGAMORE <i>[after waiting in vain for a completion of the
sentence]</i> Yes? You were saying--?</p>

<p>PATRICIA. Dont wander, Ally. Tell Mr Sagamore what sort of
people.</p>

<p>ALASTAIR. The people that have bitten off more than they can chew.
The ordinary chaps that have married extraordinary women. The
commonplace women that have married extraordinary men. They all
thought it was a splendid catch for them. Take my advice, Sagamore:
marry in your own class. Dont misunderstand me: I dont mean rank or
money. What I mean--what I mean--</p>

<p>PATRICIA <i>[coming to the rescue]</i> What he means is that
people who marry should think about the same things and like the same
things. They shouldnt be over one another's heads, if you follow
me.</p>

<p>SAGAMORE. Perfectly. May I take it that Alastair made that
mistake, and that later on (too late, unfortunately) he discovered in
you a--shall I say a soul mate?</p>

<p>ALASTAIR. No: that sounds silly. Literary, you know.</p>

<p>PATRICIA. More of a mind mate, I should call it.</p>

<p>SAGAMORE. Precisely. Thank you. A mind mate with whom he could be
thoroughly comfortable.</p>

<p>ALASTAIR <i>[grasping Sagamore's hand fervently]</i> Thank you,
Sagamore: you are a real friend. Youve got it exactly. Think over it
for us. Come on, Seedy darling: we mustnt waste a busy man's
time.</p>

<p><i>He goes out, leaving Patricia and Sagamore alone together. She
rises and goes to the table.</i></p>

<p>PATRICIA. Mr Sagamore: youll stand by us, wont you? Youll save
Ally from that awful woman. Youll save him for me.</p>

<p>SAGAMORE. I'm afraid I cant control her, Miss Smith. Whats worse,
I'm afraid she can control me. It's not only that I cant afford to
offend so rich a client. It's that her will paralyzes mine. It's a
sort of genius some people have.</p>

<p>PATRICIA. Dont you be afraid of her, Mr Sagamore. She has a genius
for making money. It's in her family. Money comes to her. But I have
my little bit of genius too; and she cant paralyze me.</p>

<p>SAGAMORE. And what have you a genius for, Miss Smith, if I may
ask?</p>

<p>PATRICIA. For making people happy. Unhappy people come to me just
as money comes to her.</p>

<p>SAGAMORE <i>[shaking his head]</i> I cant think that your will is
stronger than hers, Miss Smith.</p>

<p>PATRICIA. It isnt, Mr Sagamore. I have no will at all. But I get
what I want, somehow. Youll see.</p>

<p>ALASTAIR <i>[outside, shouting]</i> Seedy! Come on!</p>

<p>PATRICIA. Coming, darling. <i>[To Sagamore]</i> Goodbye, Mr
Sagamore. <i>[They shake hands quickly. She hurries to the door].</i>
Youll see. <i>[She goes out].</i></p>

<p>SAGAMORE <i>[to himself]</i> I think I shall wait and see.</p>

<p><i>He resumes his morning's work.</i></p>

<h1><a name="a02">ACT II</a></h1>

<p> </p>

<blockquote>
<p><i>A dismal old coffee room in an ancient riverside inn. An
immense and hideous sideboard of the murkiest mahogany stretches
across the end wall. Above it hang, picturewise, two signboards,
nearly black with age: one shewing the arms of the lord of the manor,
and the other a sow standing upright and playing a flageolet.
Underneath the sow is inscribed in tall letters THE PIG &amp;
WHISTLE. Between these works of art is a glass case containing an
enormous stuffed fish, certainly not less than a century old.</i></p>

<p><i>At right angles to the sideboard, and extending nearly the
whole length of the room, are two separate long tables, laid for
lunch for about a dozen people each. The chairs, too close together,
are plain wooden ones, hard and uncomfortable. The cutlery is cheap
kitchen ware, with rickety silver cruets and salt cellars to keep up
appearances. The table cloths are coarse, and are not fresh from the
laundry.</i></p>

<p><i>The walls are covered with an ugly Victorian paper which may
have begun as a design of dull purple wreaths on a dark yellow
background, but is now a flyblown muck of no describable color. On
the floor a coarse drugget, very old. The door, which stands wide
open and has COFFEE ROOM inscribed on it, is to the right of anyone
contemplating the sideboard from the opposite end of the room. Next
the door an old fashioned hatstand flattens itself against the wall;
and on it hang the hat and light overcoat of Mr Adrian
Blenderbland.</i></p>

<p><i>He, with Epifania, is seated at the end of the table farthest
from the door. They have just finished a meal. The cheese and
biscuits are still on the table. She looks interested and happy. He
is in the worst of tempers.</i></p>
</blockquote>

<p> </p>

<p>EPIFANIA. How jolly!</p>

<p>ADRIAN <i>[looking round disparagingly]</i> I must be a very
attractive man.</p>

<p>EPIFANIA <i>[opening her eyes wide]</i> Indeed! Not that I am
denying it; but what has it to do with what I have just said?</p>

<p>ADRIAN. You said 'How jolly!' I look round at this rotten old inn
trying to pretend that it's a riverside hotel. We have just had a
horrible meal of tomato tea called soup, the remains of Sunday's
joint, sprouts, potatoes, apple tart and stale American synthetic
cheese. If you can suffer this and say 'How jolly!' there must be
some irresistible attraction present; and I can see nothing that is
not utterly repulsive except myself.</p>

<p>EPIFANIA. Dont you like these dear old-world places? I do.</p>

<p>ADRIAN. I dont. They ought all to be rooted up, pulled down, burnt
to the ground. Your flat on the Embankment in London cost more to
furnish than this place did to build from the cellar to the roof. You
can get a decent lunch there, perfectly served, by a word through the
telephone. Your luxurious car will whisk you out to one of a dozen
first rate hotels in lovely scenery. And yet you choose this filthy
old inn and say 'How jolly!' What is the use of being a millionairess
on such terms?</p>

<p>EPIFANIA. Psha! When I was first let loose on the world with
unlimited money, how long do you think it took me to get tired of
shopping and sick of the luxuries you think so much of? About a
fortnight. My father, when he had a hundred millions, travelled third
class and never spent more than ten shillings a day on himself except
when he was entertaining people who were useful to him. Why should
he? He couldnt eat more than anyone else. He couldnt drink more than
anyone else. He couldnt wear more than anyone else. Neither can
I.</p>

<p>ADRIAN. Then why do you love money and hate spending it?</p>

<p>EPIFANIA. Because money is power. Money is security. Money is
freedom. It's the difference between living on the slope of a volcano
and being safe in the garden of the Hesperides. And there is the
continual pleasure of making more of it, which is quite easy if you
have plenty to start with. I can turn a million into two million much
more easily than a poor woman can turn five pounds into ten, even if
she could get the five pounds to begin with. It turns itself, in
fact.</p>

<p>ADRIAN. To me money is a vulgar bore and a soul destroying worry.
I need it, of course; but I dont like it. I never think of it when I
can possibly help it.</p>

<p>EPIFANIA. If you dont think about money what do you think about?
Women?</p>

<p>ADRIAN. Yes, of course; but not exclusively.</p>

<p>EPIFANIA. Food?</p>

<p>ADRIAN. Well, I am not always thinking about my food; but I am
rather particular about it. I confess I looked forward to a better
lunch than <i>[indicating the table]</i> that.</p>

<p>EPIFANIA. Oho! So that is what has put you out of temper, is
it?</p>

<p>ADRIAN <i>[annoyed]</i> I am not out of temper, I hope. But you
promised me a very special treat. You said you had found out the most
wonderful place on the river, where we could be ourselves and have a
delicious cottage meal in primitive happiness. Where is the charm of
this dismal hole? Have you ever eaten a viler lunch? There is not
even a private sitting room: anybody can walk in here at any moment.
We should have been much more comfortable at Richmond or Maidenhead.
And I believe it is raining.</p>

<p>EPIFANIA. Is that my fault?</p>

<p>ADRIAN. It completes your notion of a happy day up the river. Why
is it that the people who know how to enjoy themselves never have any
money, and the people who have money never know how to enjoy
themselves?</p>

<p>EPIFANIA. You are not making yourself agreeable, Adrian.</p>

<p>ADRIAN. You are not entertaining me very munificently, Epifania.
For heaven's sake let us get into the car and drive about the
country. It is much more luxurious than this hideous coffee room, and
more private.</p>

<p>EPIFANIA. I am tired of my car.</p>

<p>ADRIAN. I am not. I wish I could afford one like it.</p>

<p>EPIFANIA. I thought you would enjoy sitting in this crazy
out-of-way place talking to me. But I find you are a spoilt old
bachelor: you care about nothing but your food and your little
comforts. You are worse than Alastair; for he at least could talk
about boxing and tennis.</p>

<p>ADRIAN. And you can talk about nothing but money.</p>

<p>EPIFANIA. And you think money uninteresting! Oh, you should have
known my father!</p>

<p>ADRIAN. I am very glad I did not.</p>

<p>EPIFANIA <i>[suddenly dangerous]</i> Whats that you say?</p>

<p>ADRIAN. My dear Epifania, if we are to remain friends, I may as
well be quite frank with you. Everything you have told me about your
father convinces me that though he was no doubt an affectionate
parent and amiable enough to explain your rather tiresome father
fixation, as Dr Freud would call it, he must have been quite the most
appalling bore that ever devastated even a Rotary club.</p>

<p>EPIFANIA <i>[stunned for a moment by this blasphemy]</i> My
father! You infinite nothingness! My father made a hundred and fifty
millions. You never made even half a million.</p>

<p>ADRIAN. My good girl, your father never made anything. I have not
the slightest notion of how he contrived to get a legal claim on so
much of what other people made; but I do know that he lost four
fifths of it by being far enough behind the times to buy up the
properties of the Russian nobility in the belief that England would
squash the Soviet revolution in three weeks or so. Could anyone have
made a stupider mistake? Not I.</p>

<p>EPIFANIA <i>[springing up]</i> You rotten thing. <i>[He rises
apprehensively].</i> Take that for calling my father a bore. <i>[She
throws him].</i></p>

<p>ADRIAN <i>[picking himself up painfully]</i> Oh! Restrain
yourself. You might have hurt me very seriously.</p>

<p>EPIFANIA. I will hurt you until you wish yourself dead. Scum!
Filth! Take that for saying he never made anything. <i>[She throws
him again].</i></p>

<p>ADRIAN. Help! Help! There is a madwoman here: I shall not be able
to hold her single handed. Help! <i>[He comes behind her and seizes
her round the waist].</i></p>

<p>EPIFANIA. Vermin! <i>[She throws him over her shoulder].</i></p>

<p>ADRIAN. Police! She is murdering me. She is mad. Help! help!
<i>[He scrambles up and is flying to the door when she overtakes
him].</i></p>

<p>EPIFANIA. Dirt! Carrion! <i>[She throws him out head over heels
and flings his hat and overcoat after him].</i></p>

<p>ADRIAN <i>[outside, rolling downstairs with appalling bumps]</i>
Oh! Oh! Help! Murder! Police! Oh! <i>[He faints. Silence].</i></p>

<p>EPIFANIA. You brute! You have killed me. <i>[She totters to the
nearest chair and sinks into it, scattering the crockery as she
clutches the table with her outstretched arms and sprawls on it in
convulsions].</i></p>

<p><i>A serious looking middleaged Egyptian gentleman in an old black
frock coat and a tarboosh, speaking English too well to be mistaken
for a native, hurries in.</i></p>

<p>THE EGYPTIAN <i>[peremptorily]</i> Whats the matter? What is going
on here?</p>

<p>EPIFANIA <i>[raising her head slowly and gazing at him]</i> Who
the devil are you?</p>

<p>THE EGYPTIAN. I am an Egyptian doctor. I hear a great disturbance.
I hasten to ascertain the cause. I find you here in convulsions. Can
I help?</p>

<p>EPIFANIA. I am dying.</p>

<p>THE DOCTOR. Nonsense! You can swear. The fit has subsided. You can
sit up now: you are quite well. Good afternoon.</p>

<p>EPIFANIA. Stop. I am not quite well: I am on the point of death. I
need a doctor. I am a rich woman.</p>

<p>THE DOCTOR. In that case you will have no difficulty in finding an
English doctor. Is there anyone else who needs my help? I was
upstairs. The noise was of somebody falling downstairs. He may have
broken some bones. <i>[He goes out promptly].</i></p>

<p>EPIFANIA <i>[struggling to her feet and calling after him]</i>
Never mind him: if he had broken every bone in his body it is no more
than he deserves. Come back instantly. I want you. Come back. Come
back.</p>

<p>THE DOCTOR <i>[returning]</i> The landlord is taking the gentleman
to the Cottage Hospital in your car.</p>

<p>EPIFANIA. In my car! I will not permit it. Let them get an
ambulance.</p>

<p>THE DOCTOR. The car has gone. You should be very glad that it is
being so useful.</p>

<p>EPIFANIA. It is your business to doctor me, not to lecture me.</p>

<p>THE DOCTOR. I am not your doctor: I am not in general practice. I
keep a clinic for penniless Mahometan refugees; and I work in the
hospital. I cannot attend to you.</p>

<p>EPIFANIA. You can attend to me. You must attend to me. Are you
going to leave me here to die?</p>

<p>THE DOCTOR. You are not dying. Not yet, at least. Your own doctor
will attend to you.</p>

<p>EPIFANIA. You are my own doctor. I tell you I am a rich woman:
doctors' fees are nothing to me: charge me what you please. But you
must and shall attend to me. You are abominably rude; but you inspire
confidence as a doctor.</p>

<p>THE DOCTOR. If I attended all those in whom I inspire confidence I
should be worn out in a week. I have to reserve myself for poor and
useful people.</p>

<p>EPIFANIA. Then you are either a fool or a Bolshevik.</p>

<p>THE DOCTOR. I am nothing but a servant of Allah.</p>

<p>EPIFANIA. You are not: you are my doctor: do you hear? I am a sick
woman: you cannot abandon me to die in this wretched place.</p>

<p>THE DOCTOR. I see no symptoms of any sickness about you. Are you
in pain?</p>

<p>EPIFANIA. Yes. Horrible pain.</p>

<p>THE DOCTOR. Where?</p>

<p>EPIFANIA. Dont cross-examine me as if you didnt believe me. I must
have sprained my wrist throwing that beast all over the place.</p>

<p>THE DOCTOR. Which hand?</p>

<p>EPIFANIA <i>[presenting a hand]</i> This.</p>

<p>THE DOCTOR <i>[taking her hand in a businesslike way, and pulling
and turning the fingers and wrist]</i> Nothing whatever the
matter.</p>

<p>EPIFANIA. How do you know? It's my hand, not yours.</p>

<p>THE DOCTOR. You would scream the house down if your wrist were
sprained. You are shamming. Lying. Why? Is it to make yourself
interesting?</p>

<p>EPIFANIA. Make myself interesting! Man: I am interesting.</p>

<p>THE DOCTOR. Not in the least, medically. Are you interesting in
any other way?</p>

<p>EPIFANIA. I am the most interesting woman in England. I am
Epifania Ognisanti di Parerga.</p>

<p>THE DOCTOR. Never heard of her. Italian aristocrat, I presume.</p>

<p>EPIFANIA. Aristocrat! Do you take me for a fool? My ancestors were
moneylenders to all Europe five hundred years ago: we are now bankers
to all the world.</p>

<p>THE DOCTOR. Jewess, eh?</p>

<p>EPIFANIA. Christian, to the last drop of my blood. Jews throw half
their money away on charities and fancies like Zionism. The stupidest
di Parerga can just walk round the cleverest Jew when it comes to
moneymaking. We are the only real aristocracy in the world: the
aristocracy of money.</p>

<p>THE DOCTOR. The plutocracy, in fact.</p>

<p>EPIFANIA. If you like. I am a plutocrat of the plutocrats.</p>

<p>THE DOCTOR. Well, that is a disease for which I do not prescribe.
The only known cure is a revolution; but the mortality rate is high;
and sometimes, if it is the wrong sort of revolution, it intensifies
the disease. I can do nothing for you. I must go back to my work.
Good morning.</p>

<p>EPIFANIA <i>[holding him]</i> But this is your work. What else
have you to do?</p>

<p>THE DOCTOR. There is a good deal to be done in the world besides
attending rich imaginary invalids.</p>

<p>EPIFANIA. But if you are well paid?</p>

<p>THE DOCTOR. I make the little money I need by work which I venture
to think more important.</p>

<p>EPIFANIA <i>[throwing him away and moving about distractedly]</i>
You are a pig and a beast and a Bolshevik. It is the most abominable
thing of you to leave me here in my distress. My car is gone. I have
no money. I never carry money about.</p>

<p>THE DOCTOR. I have none to carry. Your car will return presently.
You can borrow money from your chauffeur.</p>

<p>EPIFANIA. You are an unmitigated hippopotamus. You are a
Bashibazouk. I might have known it from your ridiculous tarboosh. You
should take it off in my presence. <i>[She snatches it from his head
and holds it behind her back].</i> At least have the manners to stay
with me until my chauffeur comes back.</p>

<p><i>The motor horn is heard honking.</i></p>

<p>THE DOCTOR. He has come back.</p>

<p>EPIFANIA. Damn! Cant you wait until he has had his tea and a
cigarette?</p>

<p>THE DOCTOR. No. Be good enough to give me back my fez.</p>

<p>EPIFANIA. I wanted to see what you looked like without it. <i>[She
puts it tenderly on his head].</i> Listen to me. You are having an
adventure. Have you no romance in you? Havent you even common
curiosity? Dont you want to know why I threw that beast downstairs?
Dont you want to throw your wretched work to the devil for once and
have an afternoon on the river with an interesting and attractive
woman?</p>

<p>THE DOCTOR. Women are neither interesting nor attractive to me
except when they are ill. I know too much about them, inside and out.
You are perfectly well.</p>

<p>EPIFANIA. Liar. Nobody is perfectly well, nor ever has been, nor
ever will be. <i>[She sits down, sulking].</i></p>

<p>THE DOCTOR. That is true. You must have brains of a sort. <i>[He
sits down opposite to her].</i> I remember when I began as a young
surgeon I killed several patients by my operations because I had been
taught that I must go on cutting until there was nothing left but
perfectly healthy tissue. As there is no such thing as perfectly
healthy tissue I should have cut my patients entirely away if the
nurse had not stopped me before they died on the table. They died
after they left the hospital; but as they were carried away from the
table alive I was able to claim a successful operation. Are you
married?</p>

<p>EPIFANIA. Yes. But you need not be afraid. My husband is openly
unfaithful to me and cannot take you into court if you make love to
me. I can divorce him if necessary.</p>

<p>THE DOCTOR. And the man you threw downstairs: who was he? One does
not throw one's husband downstairs. Did he make love to you?</p>

<p>EPIFANIA. No. He insulted my father's memory because he was
disappointed with his lunch here. When I think of my father all
ordinary men seem to me the merest trash. You are not an ordinary
man. I should like to see some more of you. Now that you have asked
me confidential questions about my family, and I have answered them,
you can no longer pretend that you are not my family doctor. So that
is settled.</p>

<p>THE DOCTOR. A father fixation, did you say?</p>

<p>EPIFANIA <i>[nods]</i>!</p>

<p>THE DOCTOR. And an excess of money?</p>

<p>EPIFANIA. Only a beggarly thirty millions.</p>

<p>THE DOCTOR. A psychological curiosity. I will consider it.</p>

<p>EPIFANIA. Consider it! You will feel honored, gratified,
delighted.</p>

<p>THE DOCTOR. I see. Enormous self-confidence. Reckless audacity.
Insane egotism. Apparently sexless.</p>

<p>EPIFANIA. Sexless! Who told you that I am sexless?</p>

<p>THE DOCTOR. You talk to me as if you were a man. There is no
mystery, no separateness, no sacredness about men to you. A man to
you is only a male of your species.</p>

<p>EPIFANIA. My species indeed! Men are a different and very inferior
species. Five minutes conversation with my husband will convince you
that he and I do not belong to the same species. But there are some
great men, like my father. And there are some good doctors, like
you.</p>

<p>THE DOCTOR. Thank you. What does your regular doctor say about
you?</p>

<p>EPIFANIA. I have no regular doctor. If I had I should have an
operation a week until there was nothing left of me or of my bank
balance. I shall not expect you to maul me about with a stethoscope,
if that is what you are afraid of. I have the lungs of a whale and
the digestion of an ostrich. I have a clockwork inside. I sleep eight
hours like a log. When I want anything I lose my head so completely
about it that I always get it.</p>

<p>THE DOCTOR. What things do you want mostly?</p>

<p>EPIFANIA. Everything. Anything. Like a lightning flash. And then
there is no stopping me.</p>

<p>THE DOCTOR. Everything and anything is nothing.</p>

<p>EPIFANIA. Five minutes ago I wanted you. Now I have got you.</p>

<p>THE DOCTOR. Come! You cannot bluff a doctor. You may want the sun
and the moon and the stars; but you cannot get them.</p>

<p>EPIFANIA. That is why I take good care not to want them. I want
only what I can get.</p>

<p>THE DOCTOR. Good. A practical intellect. And what do you want at
present, for instance?</p>

<p>EPIFANIA. That is the devil of it. There is nothing one can get
except more money.</p>

<p>THE DOCTOR. What about more men?</p>

<p>EPIFANIA. More Alastairs! More Blenderblands! Those are not deep
wants. At present I want a motor launch.</p>

<p>THE DOCTOR. There is no such thing in this little place.</p>

<p>EPIFANIA. Tell the landlord to stop the first one that</p>

<p>comes along and buy it.</p>

<p>THE DOCTOR. Tcha! People will not sell their boats like that.</p>

<p>EPIFANIA. Have you ever tried?</p>

<p>THE DOCTOR. No.</p>

<p>EPIFANIA. I have. When I need a car or a motor boat or a launch or
anything like that I buy straight off the road or off the river or
out of the harbor. These things cost thousands when they are new; but
next day you cannot get fifty pounds for them. Offer &pound;300 for
any of them, and the owner dare not refuse: he knows he will never
get such an offer again.</p>

<p>THE DOCTOR. Aha! You are a psychologist. This is very
interesting.</p>

<p>EPIFANIA. Nonsense! I know how to buy and sell, if that is what
you mean.</p>

<p>THE DOCTOR. That is how good psychologists make money.</p>

<p>EPIFANIA. Have you made any?</p>

<p>THE DOCTOR. No. I do not care for money: I care for knowledge.</p>

<p>EPIFANIA. Knowledge is no use without money. Are you married?</p>

<p>THE DOCTOR. I am married to Science. One wife is enough for me,
though by my religion I am allowed four.</p>

<p>EPIFANIA. Four! What do you mean?</p>

<p>THE DOCTOR. I am what you call a Mahometan.</p>

<p>EPIFANIA. Well, you will have to be content with two wives if you
marry me.</p>

<p>THE DOCTOR. Oh! Is there any question of that between us?</p>

<p>EPIFANIA. Yes. I want to marry you.</p>

<p>THE DOCTOR. Nothing doing, lady. Science is my bride.</p>

<p>EPIFANIA. You can have Science as well: I shall not be jealous of
her. But I made a solemn promise to my father on his deathbed--</p>

<p>THE DOCTOR <i>[interrupting]</i> Stop. I had better tell you that
I made a solemn promise to my mother on her deathbed.</p>

<p>EPIFANIA. What!!!</p>

<p>THE DOCTOR. My mother was a very wise woman. She made me swear to
her that if any woman wanted to marry me, and I felt tempted, I would
hand the woman two hundred piastres and tell her that unless she
would go out into the world with nothing but that and the clothes she
stood in, and earn her living alone and unaided for six months, I
would never speak to her again.</p>

<p>EPIFANIA. And if she stood the test?</p>

<p>THE DOCTOR. Then I must marry her even if she were the ugliest
devil on earth.</p>

<p>EPIFANIA. And you dare ask me--me, Epifania Ognisanti di Parerga!
to submit myself to this test--to any test!</p>

<p>THE DOCTOR. I swore. I have a mother fixation. Allah willed it so.
I cannot help myself.</p>

<p>EPIFANIA. What was your mother?</p>

<p>THE DOCTOR. A washerwoman. A widow. She brought up eleven
children. I was the youngest, the Benjamin. The other ten are honest
working folk. With their help she made me a man of learning. It was
her ambition to have a son who could read and write. She prayed to
Allah; and he endowed me with the necessary talent.</p>

<p>EPIFANIA. And you think I will allow myself to be beaten by an old
washerwoman?</p>

<p>THE DOCTOR. I am afraid so. You could never pass the test.</p>

<p>EPIFANIA. Indeed! And my father's test for a husband worthy of
me?</p>

<p>THE DOCTOR. Oh! The husband is to be tested too! That never
occurred to me.</p>

<p>EPIFANIA. Nor to your mother either, it seems. Well, you know
better now. I am to give you a hundred and fifty pounds. In six
months you are to increase it to fifty thousand. How is that for a
test?</p>

<p>THE DOCTOR. Quite conclusive. At the end of the six months I shall
not have a penny of it left, praise be to Allah.</p>

<p>EPIFANIA. You confess yourself beaten?</p>

<p>THE DOCTOR. Absolutely. Completely.</p>

<p>EPIFANIA. And you think I am beaten too.</p>

<p>THE DOCTOR. Hopelessly. You do not know what homeless poverty is;
and Allah the Compassionate will take care that you never do.</p>

<p>EPIFANIA. How much is two hundred piastres?</p>

<p>THE DOCTOR. At the rate of exchange contemplated by my mother,
about thirtyfive shillings.</p>

<p>EPIFANIA. Hand it over.</p>

<p>THE DOCTOR. Unfortunately my mother forgot to provide for this
contingency. I have not got thirtyfive shillings. I must borrow them
from you.</p>

<p>EPIFANIA. I have not a penny on me. No matter: I will borrow it
from the chauffeur. He will lend you a hundred and fifty pounds on my
account if you dare ask him. Goodbye for six months. <i>[She goes
out].</i></p>

<p>THE DOCTOR. There is no might and no majesty save in Thee, O
Allah; but oh! most Great and Glorious, is this another of Thy
terrible jokes?</p>

<h1><a name="a03">ACT III</a></h1>
</center>

<p> </p>

<blockquote>
<p><i>A basement in the Commercial Road. An elderly man, anxious,
poor, and ratlike, sits at a table with his wife. He is poring over
his accounts. She, on his left, is sewing buttons on a coat, working
very fast. There is a pile of coats on the table to her right waiting
to have buttons sewn on, and another to her left which she has
finished. The table is draped down to the ground with an old cloth.
Some daylight comes in down the stone stairs; but does not extend to
the side where the couple sit, which is lighted by a small electric
bulb on a wire. Between the stairs and the table a dirty old patched
curtain hangs in front of an opening into a farther
compartment.</i></p>

<p><i>A bell tinkles. The woman instantly stops sewing and conceals
the piles of coats under the table. Epifania, her dress covered by an
old waterproof, and wearing an elaborately damaged hat, comes down
the stairs. She looks at the pair; then looks round her; then goes to
the curtain and looks through. The old man makes a dash to prevent
her, but is too late. He snatches the curtain from her and bars her
passage.</i></p>
</blockquote>

<p> </p>

<p>THE MAN. What do you want? What are you doing here?</p>

<p>EPIFANIA. I want employment. A woman told me I should find it
here. I am destitute.</p>

<p>THE MAN. Thats not the way to get employment: poking your nose
into places that dont concern you. Get out. There are no women
employed here.</p>

<p>EPIFANIA. You lie. There are six women working in there. Who
employs them?</p>

<p>THE MAN. Is that the way to talk to me? You think a lot of
yourself, dont you? What do you take me for?</p>

<p>EPIFANIA. A worm.</p>

<p>THE MAN <i>[making a violent demonstration]</i>!!</p>

<p>EPIFANIA. Take care. I can use my fists. I can shoot, if
necessary.</p>

<p>THE WOMAN <i>[hurrying to the man and holding him]</i> Take care,
Joe. She's an inspector. Look at her shoes.</p>

<p>EPIFANIA. I am not an inspector. And what is the matter with my
shoes, pray?</p>

<p>THE WOMAN <i>[respectfully]</i> Well maam, could a woman looking
for work at tuppence hapeny an hour afford a west end shoe like that?
I assure you we dont employ any women here. We're only
caretakers.</p>

<p>EPIFANIA. But I saw six women--</p>

<p>THE MAN <i>[throwing open the curtain]</i> Where? Not a soul.
Search the whole bloody basement.</p>

<p>THE WOMAN. Hush, hush, Joe: dont speak to the lady like that. You
see, maam: theres not a soul.</p>

<p>EPIFANIA. Theres a smell. You have given them a signal to hide.
You are breaking the law. Give me some work or I will send a postcard
to the Home Office.</p>

<p>THE MAN. Look here, lady. Cant we arrange this? What good will it
do you to get me into trouble and shut up my little shop?</p>

<p>EPIFANIA. What good will it do me to say nothing?</p>

<p>THE MAN. Well, what about half a crown a week?</p>

<p>EPIFANIA. I cannot live on half a crown a week.</p>

<p>THE MAN. You can if you look round a bit. There are others you
know.</p>

<p>EPIFANIA. Give me the address of the others. If I am to live by
blackmail I must have an extended practice.</p>

<p>THE MAN. Well, if I have to pay I dont see why the others shouldnt
too. Will you take half a crown? <i>[He holds up half a crown.]</i>
Look here! Look at it! Listen to it! <i>[He rings it on the
table].</i> It's yours, and another every Wednesday if you keep the
inspector off me.</p>

<p>EPIFANIA. It's no use ringing half crowns at me: I am accustomed
to them. And I feel convinced that you will pay five shillings if I
insist.</p>

<p>THE WOMAN. Oh, maam, have some feeling for us. You dont know the
struggle we have to live.</p>

<p>THE MAN <i>[roughly]</i> Here: we're not beggars. I'll pay what
the business can afford and not a penny more. You seem to know that
it can afford five shillings. Well, if you know that, you know that
it cant afford any more. Take your five shillings and be damned to
you. <i>[He flings two half crowns on the table].</i></p>

<p>THE WOMAN. Oh, Joe, dont be so hasty.</p>

<p>THE MAN. You shut up. You think you can beg a shilling or two off;
but you cant. I can size up a tough lot without looking at her shoes.
She's got us; and she knows she's got us.</p>

<p>EPIFANIA. I do not like this blackmailing business. Of course if I
must I must; but can you not give me some manual work?</p>

<p>THE MAN. You want to get a little deeper into our business, dont
you?</p>

<p>EPIFANIA. I am as deep as I can go already. You are employing six
women in there. The thing in the corner is a gas engine: that makes
you a workshop under the Act. Except that the sanitary arrangements
are probably abominable, there is nothing more for me to know. I have
you in the hollow of my hand. Give me some work that I can live by or
I will have you cleared out like a wasp's nest.</p>

<p>THE MAN. I have a good mind to clear out now and take some place
where you wont find me so easy. I am used to changing my address.</p>

<p>EPIFANIA. That is the best card in your hand. You have some
business ability. Tell me why you cannot give me work to live by just
as you give it, I suppose, to the women I saw in there.</p>

<p>THE MAN. I dont like the people I employ to know too much.</p>

<p>EPIFANIA. I see. They might call in the inspector.</p>

<p>THE MAN. Call in the inspector! What sort of fool are you? They
dread the inspector more than I do.</p>

<p>EPIFANIA. Why? Dont they want to be protected?</p>

<p>THE WOMAN. The inspector wouldnt protect them, maam: he'd only
shut up the place and take away their job from them. If they thought
youd be so cruel as to report them theyd go down on their knees to
you to spare them.</p>

<p>THE MAN. You that know such a lot ought to know that a business
like this cant afford any luxuries. It's a cheap labor business. As
long as I get women to work for their natural wage, I can get along;
but no luxuries, mind you. No trade union wages. No sanitary
arrangements as you call them. No limewashings every six months. No
separate rooms to eat in. No fencing in of dangerous machinery or the
like of that: not that I care; for I have nothing but the old gas
engine that wouldnt hurt a fly, though it brings me under the blasted
Workshop Act as you spotted all right. I have no big machinery; but I
have to undersell those that have it. If I put up my prices by a
farthing theyd set their machinery going and drop me. You might as
well ask me to pay trade union wages as do all that the inspector
wants: I should be out of business in a week.</p>

<p>EPIFANIA. And what is a woman's natural wage?</p>

<p>THE MAN. Tuppence hapeny an hour for twelve hours a day.</p>

<p>EPIFANIA. Slavery!</p>

<p>THE WOMAN. Oh no, maam: nobody could call that slavery. A good
worker can make from twelve to fifteen shillings a week at it, week
in and week out.</p>

<p>THE MAN. Isnt it what the Government paid at the beginning of the
war when all the women were called on to do their bit? Do you expect
me to pay more than the British Government?</p>

<p>THE WOMAN. I assure you it's the regular and proper wage and
always has been, maam.</p>

<p>THE MAN. Like five per cent at the Bank of England it is. This is
a respectable business, whatever your inspectors may say.</p>

<p>EPIFANIA. Can a woman live on twelve shillings a week?</p>

<p>THE MAN. Of course she can. Whats to prevent her?</p>

<p>THE WOMAN. Why, maam, when I was a girl in a match factory I had
five shillings a week; and it was a godsend to my mother. And a girl
who had no family of her own could always find a family to take her
in for four and sixpence, and treat her better than if she had been
in her father's house.</p>

<p>THE MAN. I can find you a family what'll do it today, in spite of
all the damned doles and wages boards that have upset everything and
given girls ideas above their station without giving them the means
to pamper themselves.</p>

<p>EPIFANIA. Well, I will work even for that, to prove that I can
work and support myself. So give me work and have done talking.</p>

<p>THE MAN. Who started talking? You or I?</p>

<p>EPIFANIA. I did. I thank you for the information you have given
me: it has been instructive and to the point. Is that a sufficient
apology? And now to work, to work. I am in a hurry to get to
work.</p>

<p>THE MAN. Well, what work can you do?</p>

<p>THE WOMAN. Can you sew? Can you make buttonholes?</p>

<p>EPIFANIA. Certainly not. I dont call that work.</p>

<p>THE MAN. Well, what sort of work are you looking for?</p>

<p>EPIFANIA. Brain work.</p>

<p>THE MAN. She's dotty!</p>

<p>EPIFANIA. Your work. Managing work. Planning work. Driving work.
Let me see what you make here. Tell me how you dispose of it.</p>

<p>THE MAN <i>[to his wife]</i> You had better get on with your work.
Let her see it. <i>[To Epifania, whilst the woman pulls out the pile
of coats from under the table and sits down resignedly to her
sewing]</i> And when youve quite satisfied your curiosity, perhaps
youll take that five shillings and go.</p>

<p>EPIFANIA. Why? Dont you find my arrival a pleasant sort of
adventure in this den?</p>

<p>THE MAN. I never heard the like of your cheek, not from nobody.
<i>[He sits down to his accounts].</i></p>

<p>EPIFANIA <i>[to the woman, indicating the pile of coats]</i> What
do you do with these when they are finished?</p>

<p>THE WOMAN <i>[going on with her work]</i> The man comes with his
lorry and takes them away.</p>

<p>EPIFANIA. Does he pay you for them?</p>

<p>THE WOMAN. Oh no. He gives us a receipt for them. Mr Superflew
pays us for the receipts at the end of the week.</p>

<p>EPIFANIA. And what does Mr Superflew do with the coats?</p>

<p>THE WOMAN. He takes them to the wholesaler that supplies him with
the cloth. The lorry brings us the cloth when it takes away the
finished clothes.</p>

<p>EPIFANIA. Why dont you deal directly with the wholesalers?</p>

<p>THE WOMAN. Oh no: that wouldnt be right. We dont know who they
are; and Mr Superflew does. Besides, we couldnt afford a lorry.</p>

<p>EPIFANIA. Does Mr Superflew own the lorry?</p>

<p>THE WOMAN. Oh no: that wouldnt be right. He hires it by the hour
from Bolton's.</p>

<p>EPIFANIA. Is the driver always the same man?</p>

<p>THE WOMAN. Yes, of course: always old Tim Goodenough.</p>

<p>EPIFANIA <i>[to the man]</i> Write those names for me: Superflew,
Bolton's, Goodenough.</p>

<p>THE MAN. Here! I'm not your clerk, you know.</p>

<p>EPIFANIA. You will be, soon. Do as I tell you.</p>

<p>THE MAN. Well of all the cheek--! <i>[He obeys].</i></p>

<p>EPIFANIA. When Goodenough comes round next, tell him to tell
Bolton's that he has found somebody who will buy the lorry for
fourteen pounds. Tell him that if he can induce Bolton's to part from
it at that figure you will give him a pound for himself and engage
him at half a crown advance on his present wages to drive it just the
same old round to the same places. He knows the wholesalers. Mr
Superflew is superfluous. We shall collect not only our own stuff but
that of all the other sweaters.</p>

<p>THE MAN. Sweaters! Who are you calling sweaters?</p>

<p>EPIFANIA. Man, know thyself. You sweat yourself; you sweat your
wife; you sweat those women in there; you live on sweat.</p>

<p>THE MAN. Thats no way to talk about it. It isnt civil. I pay the
right wages, same as everybody pays. I give employment that the like
of them couldnt make for themselves.</p>

<p>EPIFANIA. You are sensitive about it. I am not. I am going to
sweat Mr Superflew out of existence. I am going to sweat Mr Timothy
Goodenough instead of allowing Mr Superflew to sweat him.</p>

<p>THE MAN. See here. Does this business belong to me or to you?</p>

<p>EPIFANIA. We shall see. Dare you buy the lorry?</p>

<p>THE MAN. Wheres the money to come from?</p>

<p>EPIFANIA. Where does all money come from? From the bank.</p>

<p>THE MAN. You got to put it there first, havnt you?</p>

<p>EPIFANIA. Not in the least. Other people put it there; and the
bank lends it to you if it thinks you know how to extend your
business.</p>

<p>THE WOMAN <i>[terrified]</i> Oh, Joe, dont trust your money in a
bank. No good ever comes out of banks for the likes of us. Dont let
her tempt you, Joe.</p>

<p>EPIFANIA. When had you last a holiday?</p>

<p>THE WOMAN. Me! A holiday! We cant afford holidays. I had one on
Armistice Day, eighteen years ago.</p>

<p>EPIFANIA. Then it cost a world war and the slaughter of twenty
millions of your fellow creatures to give you one holiday in your
lifetime. I can do better for you than that.</p>

<p>THE WOMAN. We dont understand that sort of talk here. Weve no time
for it. Will you please take our little present and go away?</p>

<p><i>The bell tinkles.</i></p>

<p>THE MAN <i>[rising]</i> Thats Tim, for the clothes.</p>

<p>EPIFANIA <i>[masterfully]</i> Sit down. I will deal with Tim.</p>

<p><i>She goes out. The man, after a moment of irresolution, sits
down helplessly.</i></p>

<p>THE WOMAN <i>[crying]</i> Oh, Joe, dont listen to her: dont let
her meddle with us. That woman would spend our little savings in a
week, and leave us to slave to the end of our days to make it up
again. I cant go on slaving for ever; we're neither of us as young as
we were.</p>

<p>THE MAN <i>[sullen]</i> What sort of wife are you for a man? You
take the pluck out of me every time. Dont I see other men swanking
round and throwing money about that they get out of the banks? In and
out of banks they are, all day. What do they do but smoke cigars and
drink champagne? A five pound note is to them what a penny is to me.
Why shouldn't I try their game instead of slaving here for pence and
hapence?</p>

<p>THE WOMAN. Cause you dont understand it, Joe. We know our own
ways; and though we're poor our ways have never let us down; and they
never will if we stick to them. And who would speak to us? who would
know us or give us a helping hand in hard times if we began doing
things that nobody else does? How would you like to walk down
Commercial Road and get nothing but black looks from all your friends
and be refused a week's credit in the shops? Joe: Ive gone on in our
natural ways all these years without a word of complaint; and I can
go on long enough still to make us comfortable when we're too old to
see what I'm sewing or you to count the pence. But if youre going to
risk everything and put our money in a bank and change our ways I
cant go on: I cant go on: itll kill me. Go up and stop her, Joe. Dont
let her talk: just put her out. Be a man, darling: dont be afraid of
her. Dont break my heart and ruin yourself. Oh, dont sit there
dithering: you dont know what she may be doing. Oh! oh! oh! <i>[She
can say no more for sobbing].</i></p>

<p>THE MAN <i>[rising, but not very resolutely]</i> There! there!
Hold your noise: I'm not going to let her interfere with us. I'll put
her out all right. <i>[He goes to the stairs. Epifania comes
down].</i> Now, missis: lets have an understanding.</p>

<p>EPIFANIA. No understanding is necessary. Tim is sure that Bolton's
will take ten pounds for the lorry. Tim is my devoted slave. Make
that poor woman stop howling if you can. I am going now. There is not
enough work here for me: I can do it all in half a day every week. I
shall take a job as scullery maid at a hotel to fill up my time. But
first I must go round to the address Tim has given me and arrange
that we send them our stuff direct and collect just as Superflew did.
When I have arranged everything with them I will come back and
arrange everything for you. Meanwhile, carry on as usual. Good
morning. <i>[She goes out].</i></p>

<p>THE MAN <i>[stupefied]</i> It seems to me like a sort of dream.
What could I do?</p>

<p>THE WOMAN <i>[who has stopped crying on hearing Epifania's
allusion to her]</i> Do what she tells us, Joe. We're like
children--<i>[She begins crying again softly].</i></p>

<p><i>There is nothing more to be said.</i></p>

<blockquote>
<p><i>The coffee room of The Pig &amp; Whistle, now transmogrified
into the lounge of The Cardinal's Hat, a very attractive riverside
hotel. The long tables are gone, replaced by several teatables with
luxurious chairs round them. The old sideboard, the stuffed fish, the
signboards are no more: instead there is an elegant double writing
desk for two sitters, divided by stationery cases and electric lamps
with dainty shades. Near it is a table with all the illustrated
papers and magazines to hand. Farther down the room, towards the side
next the door, there is a long well cushioned seat, capable of
accommodating three persons. With three chairs at the other side it
forms a fireside circle. The old hatstand has gone to its grave with
the sideboard. The newly painted walls present an attractive color
scheme. The floor is parquetted and liberally supplied with oriental
rugs. All the appurtenances of a brand new first class hotel lounge
are in evidence.</i></p>

<p><i>Alastair, in boating flannels, is sprawling happily on the long
seat, reading an illustrated magazine. Patricia, in her gladdest
summer rags, is knitting in the middle chair opposite, full of quiet
enjoyment.</i></p>

<p><i>It is a fine summer afternoon; and the general effect is that
of a bank holiday paradise.</i></p>
</blockquote>

<p> </p>

<p>ALASTAIR. I say, Seedy, isnt this jolly?</p>

<p>PATRICIA. Yes, darling: it's lovely.</p>

<p>ALASTAIR. Nothing beats a fine week-end on the river. A pull on
the water in the morning to give one a good stretch and a good
appetite. A good lunch, and then a good laze. What more can any man
desire on earth?</p>

<p>PATRICIA. You row so beautifully, Ally. I love to see you
sculling. And punting too. You look so well standing up in the
punt.</p>

<p>ALASTAIR. It's the quiet of it, the blessed quiet. You are so
quiet: I'm never afraid of your kicking up a row about nothing. The
river is so smooth. I dont know which is more comforting, you or the
river, when I think of myself shooting Niagara three or four times a
day at home.</p>

<p>PATRICIA. Dont think of it, darling. It isnt home: this is
home.</p>

<p>ALASTAIR. Yes, dear: youre right: this is what home ought to be,
though it's only a hotel.</p>

<p>PATRICIA. Well, what more could anyone ask but a nice hotel? All
the housekeeping done for us: no trouble with the servants: no rates
nor taxes. I have never had any peace except in a hotel. But perhaps
a man doesnt feel that way.</p>

<p><i>The manager of the hotel, a young man, smartly dressed, enters.
He carries the hotel register, which he opens and places on the
newspaper table. He then comes obsequiously to his two
guests.</i></p>

<p>MANAGER <i>[between them]</i> Good afternoon, sir. I hope you find
everything here to your liking.</p>

<p>ALASTAIR. Yes, thanks. But what have you done to the old place?
When I was here last, a year ago, it was a common pub called The Pig
and Whistle.</p>

<p>THE MANAGER. It was so until quite lately, sir. My father kept The
Pig and Whistle. So did his forefathers right back to the reign of
William the Conqueror. Cardinal Wolsey stopped once for an hour at
The Pig and Whistle when his mule cast a shoe and had to go to the
blacksmith's. I assure you my forefathers thought a lot of
themselves. But they were uneducated men, and ruined the old place by
trying to improve it by getting rid of the old things in it. It was
on its last legs when you saw it, sir. I was ashamed of it.</p>

<p>ALASTAIR. Well, you have made a first rate job of it now.</p>

<p>THE MANAGER. Oh, it was not my doing, sir: I am only the manager.
You would hardly believe it if I were to tell you the story of it.
Much more romantic, to my mind, than the old tale about Wolsey. But I
mustnt disturb you talking. You will let me know if theres anything I
can do to make you quite comfortable.</p>

<p>PATRICIA. I should like to know about the old Pig if it's
romantic. If you can spare the time, of course.</p>

<p>THE MANAGER. I am at your service, madam, always.</p>

<p>ALASTAIR. Fire ahead, old man.</p>

<p>THE MANAGER. Well, madam, one day a woman came here and asked for
a job as a scullery maid. My poor old father hadnt the nerve to turn
her out: he said she might just try for a day or two. So she started
in. She washed two dishes and broke six. My poor old mother was
furious: she thought the world of her dishes. She had no suspicion,
poor soul, that they were ugly and common and old and cheap and
altogether out of date. She said that as the girl had broken them she
should pay for them if she had to stay for a month and have the price
stopped out of her wages. Off went the girl to Reading and came back
with a load of crockery that made my mother cry: she said we should
be disgraced for ever if we served a meal on such old fashioned
things. But the very next day an American lady with a boating party
bought them right off the table for three times what they cost; and
my poor mother never dared say another word. The scullery maid took
things into her own hands in a way we could never have done. It was
cruel for us; but we couldnt deny that she was always right.</p>

<p>PATRICIA. Cruel! What was there cruel in getting nice crockery for
you?</p>

<p>THE MANAGER. Oh, it wasnt only that, madam: that part of it was
easy and pleasant enough. You see all she had to do with the old
crockery was to break it and throw the bits into the dustbin. But
what was the matter with the old Pig and Whistle was not the old
thick plate that took away your appetite. It was the old people it
had gathered about itself that were past their work and had never
been up to much according to modern ideas. They had to be thrown into
the street to wander about for a few days and then go into the
workhouse. There was the bar that was served by father and mother:
she dressed up to the nines, as she thought, poor old dear, never
dreaming that the world was a day older than when she was married.
The scullery maid told them the truth about themselves; and it just
cut them to pieces; for it was the truth; and I couldnt deny it. The
old man had to give in, because he had raised money on his freehold
and was at his wits' end to pay the mortgage interest. The next thing
we knew, the girl had paid off the mortgage and got the whip hand of
us completely. 'It's time for you two to sell your freehold and
retire: you are doing no good here' she said.</p>

<p>PATRICIA. But that was dreadful, to root them up like that.</p>

<p>THE MANAGER. It was hard; but it was the truth. We should have had
the brokers in sooner or later if we had gone on. Business is
business; and theres no room for sentiment in it. And then, think of
the good, she did. My parents would never have got the price for the
freehold that she gave them. Here was I, ashamed of the place, tied
to the old Pig and Whistle by my feeling for my parents, with no
prospects. Now the house is a credit to the neighborhood and gives
more employment than the poor old Pig did in its best days; and I am
the manager of it with a salary and a percentage beyond anything I
could have dreamt of.</p>

<p>ALASTAIR. Then she didnt chuck you, old man.</p>

<p>THE MANAGER. No, sir. You see, though I could never have made the
change myself, I was intelligent enough to see that she was right. I
backed her up all through. I have such faith in that woman, sir, that
if she told me to burn down the hotel tonight I'd do it without a
moment's hesitation. When she puts her finger on a thing it turns
into gold every time. The bank would remind my father if he overdrew
by five pounds; but the manager keeps pressing overdrafts on her: it
makes him miserable when she has a penny to her credit. A wonderful
woman, sir: one day a scullery maid, and the next the proprietress of
a first class hotel.</p>

<p>PATRICIA. And are the old people satisfied and happy?</p>

<p>THE MANAGER. Well, no: the change was too much for them at their
age. My father had a stroke and wont last long, I'm afraid. And my
mother has gone a bit silly. Still, it was best for them; and they
have all the comforts they care for.</p>

<p>ALASTAIR. Well, thats a very moving tale: more so than you think,
old boy, because I happen to know a woman of that stamp. By the way,
I telegraphed for a friend of mine to come and spend the week-end
with us here: a Mr Sagamore. I suppose you can find a room for
him.</p>

<p>THE MANAGER. That will be quite all right, sir, thank you.</p>

<p>PATRICIA. Have you many people in the house this week-end?</p>

<p>THE MANAGER. Less than usual, madam. We have an Egyptian doctor
who takes his meals here: a very learned man I should think: very
quiet: not a word to anybody. Then there is another gentleman, an
invalid, only just discharged from the Cottage Hospital. The Egyptian
doctor recommended our chef to him; and he takes his meals here too.
And that is all, madam, unless some fresh visitors arrive.</p>

<p>ALASTAIR. Well, we must put up with them.</p>

<p>THE MANAGER. By the way, sir, I am sorry to trouble you; but you
came up this morning without signing the register. I have brought it
up. Would you be so good? <i>[He fetches the register from the table
and presents it to Alastair with his fountain pen].</i></p>

<p>ALASTAIR <i>[sitting up and taking it on his knees]</i> Oh, I am
sorry: I forgot. <i>[He signs].</i> There you are. <i>[He puts up his
legs again].</i></p>

<p>THE MANAGER. Thanks very much, sir. <i>[He glances at the register
before shutting it. The signature surprises him].</i> Oh, indeed,
sir! We are honored.</p>

<p>ALASTAIR. Anything wrong?</p>

<p>THE MANAGER. Oh no, sir, nothing wrong: quite the contrary. Mr and
Mrs Fitzfassenden. The name is so unusual. Have I the honor of
entertaining the celebrated--</p>

<p>ALASTAIR <i>[interrupting]</i> Yes: it's all right: I am the
tennis champion and the boxing champion and all the rest of it; but I
am here for a holiday and I dont want to hear anything more about
it.</p>

<p>THE MANAGER <i>[shutting the book]</i> I quite understand, sir. I
should not have said anything if it were not that the proprietress of
this hotel, the lady I told you of, is a Mrs Fitzfassenden.</p>

<p>ALASTAIR <i>[rising with a yell]</i> What! Let me out of this.
Pack up, Seedy. My bill, please, instantly.</p>

<p>THE MANAGER. Certainly, sir. But may I say that she is not on the
premises at present and that I do not expect her this week-end.</p>

<p>PATRICIA. Dont fuss, darling. Weve a perfect right to be in her
hotel if we pay our way just like anybody else.</p>

<p>ALASTAIR. Very well: have it your own way. But my week-end is
spoilt.</p>

<p>THE MANAGER. Depend on it, she wont come, sir. She is getting
tired of paying us unexpected visits now that she knows she can
depend on me. <i>[He goes out, but immediately looks in again to
say]</i> Your friend Mr Sagamore, sir, coming up with the invalid
gentleman. <i>[He holds the door open for Sagamore and Adrian, who
come in. Then he goes out, taking the register with him].</i></p>

<p><i>Adrian, who comes first, limps badly on two walking sticks; and
his head is bandaged. He is disagreeably surprised at seeing
Fitzfassenden and Patricia.</i></p>

<p>ADRIAN. Alastair! Miss Smith! What does this mean, Sagamore? You
never told me who you were bringing me to see: you said two friends.
Alastair: I assure you I did not know you were here. Sagamore said
some friends who would be glad to see me.</p>

<p>PATRICIA. Well, we are glad to see you, Mr Blenderbland. Wont you
sit down?</p>

<p>ALASTAIR. But whats happened to you, old chap? What on earth have
you done to yourself?</p>

<p>ADRIAN <i>[exasperated]</i> Everyone asks me what I have done to
myself. I havent done anything to myself. I suppose you mean this and
this <i>[he indicated his injuries].</i> Well, they are what your
wife has done to me. That is why Sagamore should not have brought me
here.</p>

<p>ALASTAIR. I say: I am frightfully sorry, old chap.</p>

<p>PATRICIA <i>[rising solicitously]</i> Do sit down, Mr
Blenderbland. Rest yourself on that couch. <i>[Arranging
cushions]</i> Dear! dear!</p>

<p>ALASTAIR. Eppy is like that, you know.</p>

<p>ADRIAN. Yes: I know now. But I ought not to be here: Sagamore
should not have brought me here.</p>

<p>PATRICIA. But why not? I assure you we're delighted to see you. We
dont mind what Mrs Fitzfassenden does.</p>

<p>ADRIAN. But I do. You are most kind; but I cannot claim the
privilege of a friend and at the same time be the plaintiff in an
action for assault and battery.</p>

<p>ALASTAIR. Yes you can, old chap. The situation is not new. The
victims always come to us for sympathy. Make yourself
comfortable.</p>

<p>ADRIAN <i>[reluctantly sitting down and disposing his damaged
limbs along the couch]</i> Well, it's most kind of you; and I really
cant stand any longer. But I dont understand why Sagamore should have
played such a trick on me. And, of course, on you too.</p>

<p><i>Patricia returns to her chair, and resumes her
knitting.</i></p>

<p>SAGAMORE <i>[taking a chair next Patricia on her left]</i> Well,
the truth of the matter is that Blenderbland wont be reasonable; and
I thought you two might help me to bring him to his senses.</p>

<p>ADRIAN <i>[obstinately]</i> It's no use, Sagamore. Two thousand
five hundred. And costs. Not a penny less.</p>

<p>SAGAMORE. Too much. Ridiculous. A jury might give five hundred if
there was a clear disablement from earning, or if the defendant had
done something really womanly, like throwing vitriol. But you are
only a sleeping partner in the firm your father founded: you dont
really earn your income. Besides, hang it all! a man accusing a woman
of assault!</p>

<p>ALASTAIR. Why didnt you give her a punch in the solar plexus?</p>

<p>ADRIAN. Strike a woman! Impossible.</p>

<p>ALASTAIR. Rot! If a woman starts fighting she must take what she
gets and deserves.</p>

<p>PATRICIA. Look at the marks she's left on you, Mr Blenderbland!
You shouldnt have put up with it: it only encourages her.</p>

<p>ALASTAIR. Search me for marks: you wont find any. Youd have found
a big mark on her the first time she tried it on me. There was no
second time.</p>

<p>ADRIAN. Unfortunately I have neither your muscle nor your
knowledge of how to punch. But I will take lessons when I get well.
And she shall pay for them. Two thousand five hundred. And medical
expenses. And costs.</p>

<p>SAGAMORE. And cab fare to the Cottage Hospital, I suppose.</p>

<p>ADRIAN. No: I went in her own car. But now you remind me, I tipped
the chauffeur. Now dont misunderstand me. It is not the money. But I
wont be beaten by a woman. It's a point of honor: of
self-respect.</p>

<p>SAGAMORE. Yes; but how do you arrive at the figure? Why is your
honor and self-respect worth two thousand five hundred pounds and not
two thousand five hundred millions?</p>

<p>ADRIAN. My brother got two thousand five hundred from the railway
company when an electric truck butted into him on the platform at
Paddington. I will not let Epifania off with less. It was an
unprovoked, brutal, cowardly assault.</p>

<p>SAGAMORE. Was it quite unprovoked? You will not get a jury to
swallow that without a peck of salt?</p>

<p>ADRIAN. I have told you over and over again that it was absolutely
unprovoked. But the concussion from which I suffered obliterated all
consciousness of what happened immediately before the assault: the
last thing I can recollect was a quite ordinary conversation about
her father's money.</p>

<p>SAGAMORE. So much the worse for you. She can accuse you of
anything she likes. And remember: no man can get damages out of a
British jury unless he goes into court as a moral man.</p>

<p>ADRIAN. Do you suggest that I am not a moral man?</p>

<p>SAGAMORE. No; but Mrs Fitzfassenden's counsel will if you take her
into court.</p>

<p>ADRIAN. Stuff! Would any jury believe that she and I were lovers
on the strength of a sprained ankle, a dislocated knee, and a lump on
my head the size of an ostrich's egg?</p>

<p>SAGAMORE. The best of evidence against you. It's only lovers that
have lovers' quarrels. And suppose she pleads self-defence against a
criminal assault!</p>

<p>ADRIAN. She dare not swear to such a lie.</p>

<p>SAGAMORE. How do you know it's a lie? You dont know what happened
at the end. You had concussion of the brain.</p>

<p>ADRIAN. Yes: after the assault.</p>

<p>SAGAMORE. But it obliterated your consciousness of what happened
before the assault. How do you know what you did in those
moments?</p>

<p>ADRIAN. Look here. Are you my solicitor or hers?</p>

<p>SAGAMORE. Fate seems to have made me the solicitor of everybody in
this case. If I am forced to throw up either her case or yours, I
must throw up yours. How can I afford to lose a client with such an
income and such a temper? Her tantrums are worth two or three
thousand a year to any solicitor.</p>

<p>ADRIAN. Very well, Sagamore. You see my condition: you know that
right and justice are on my side. I shall not forget this.</p>

<p><i>The manager enters, looking very serious.</i></p>

<p>THE MANAGER <i>[to Alastair]</i> I am extremely sorry, sir. Mrs
Fitzfassenden is downstairs with the Egyptian doctor. I really did
not expect her.</p>

<p>EPIFANIA <i>[dashing into the room and addressing herself fiercely
to the manager]</i> You have allowed my husband to bring a woman to
my hotel and register her in my name. You are fired. <i>[She is
behind the couch and does not see Adrian. Sagamore rises].</i></p>

<p>THE MANAGER. I am sorry, madam: I did not know that the gentleman
was your husband. However, you are always right. Do you wish me to go
at once or to carry on until you have replaced me?</p>

<p>EPIFANIA. I do not wish you to go at all: you are re-engaged.
Throw them both out, instantly.</p>

<p>ALASTAIR. Ha ha ha!</p>

<p>SAGAMORE. Your manager cannot throw Alastair out: Alastair can
throw all of us out, if it comes to that. As to Miss Smith, this is a
licensed house; and she has as much right to be here as you or I.</p>

<p>EPIFANIA. I will set fire to the hotel if necessary. <i>[She sees
Adrian].</i> Hallo! What is this? Adrian here too! What has happened
to your head? What are those sticks for? <i>[To the manager]</i> Send
the doctor here at once. <i>[To Adrian]</i> Have you hurt
yourself?</p>

<p><i>The manager hurries out, glad to escape from the
m&ecirc;l&eacute;e.</i></p>

<p>ADRIAN. Hurt myself! Hurt myself!!</p>

<p>EPIFANIA. Has he been run over?</p>

<p>ADRIAN. This woman has half killed me; and she asks have I hurt
myself! I fell down the whole flight of stairs. My ankle was
sprained. My knee was twisted. The small bone of my leg was broken. I
ricked my spine. I had to give them a subscription at the Cottage
Hospital, where your man took me. I had to go from there to a nursing
home: twelve guineas a week. I had to call in three Harley Street
surgeons; and none of them knew anything about dislocated knees: they
wanted to cut my knee open to see what was the matter with it. I had
to take it to a bonesetter; and he charged me fifty guineas.</p>

<p>EPIFANIA. Well, why did you not walk downstairs properly? Were you
drunk?</p>

<p>ADRIAN <i>[suffocating]</i> I--</p>

<p>SAGAMORE <i>[cutting in quickly]</i> He declares that his injuries
were inflicted by you when you last met, Mrs Fitzfassenden.</p>

<p>EPIFANIA. By me! Am I a prizefighter? Am I a coal-heaver?</p>

<p>ADRIAN. Both.</p>

<p>SAGAMORE. Do you deny that you assaulted him?</p>

<p>EPIFANIA. Of course I deny it. Anything more monstrous I never
heard. What happened was that he insulted my father grossly, without
the slightest provocation, at a moment when I had every reason to
expect the utmost tenderness from him. The blood rushed to my head:
the next thing I remember is that I was lying across the table,
trembling, dying. The doctor who found me can tell you what my
condition was.</p>

<p>ADRIAN. I dont care what your condition was. What condition did
your chauffeur find me in?</p>

<p>SAGAMORE. Then neither of you has the least notion of how this
affair ended.</p>

<p>ADRIAN. I have medical evidence.</p>

<p>EPIFANIA. So have I.</p>

<p>ADRIAN. Well, we shall see. I am not going to be talked out of my
case.</p>

<p>EPIFANIA. What do you mean by your case?</p>

<p>SAGAMORE. He is taking an action against you.</p>

<p>EPIFANIA. An action! Very well: you know my invariable rule. Fight
him to the last ditch, no matter what it costs. Take him to the House
of Lords if necessary. We shall see whose purse will hold out
longest. I will not be blackmailed.</p>

<p>ADRIAN. You think your father's money places you above the
law?</p>

<p>EPIFANIA <i>[flushing]</i> Again!</p>

<p><i>She makes for him. Alastair seizes her from behind and whirls
her away towards Sagamore; then places himself on guard between her
and the couch, balancing his fist warningly.</i></p>

<p>ALASTAIR. Now! now! now! None of that. Toko, my girl, toko.</p>

<p>SAGAMORE. Toko! What is toko?</p>

<p>ALASTAIR. She knows. Toko is an infallible medicine for calming
the nerves. A punch in the solar plexus and a day in bed: thats
toko.</p>

<p>EPIFANIA. You are my witness, Mr Sagamore, how I go in fear of my
husband's brutal violence. He is stronger than I am: he can batter
me, torture me, kill me. It is the last argument of the lower nature
against the higher. My innocence is helpless. Do your worst. <i>[She
sits down in Sagamore's chair with great dignity].</i></p>

<p>ALASTAIR. Quite safe now, ladies and gentlemen. <i>[He picks up
his illustrated paper, and retires with it to one of the remoter
tea-tables, where he sits down to read as quietly as may be].</i></p>

<p>ADRIAN <i>[to Epifania]</i> Now you know what I felt. It serves
you right.</p>

<p>EPIFANIA. Yes: go on. Insult me. Threaten me. Blackmail me. You
can all do it with impunity now.</p>

<p>SAGAMORE <i>[behind her chair]</i> Dont take it that way, Mrs
Fitzfassenden. There is no question of blackmailing or insulting you.
I only want to settle this business of Mr Blenderbland's injuries
before we go into the matrimonial question.</p>

<p>EPIFANIA. I want to hear no more of Mr Blenderbland and his
ridiculous injuries.</p>

<p>SAGAMORE. Do be a little reasonable, Mrs Fitzfassenden. How are we
to discuss the compensation due to Mr Blenderbland without mentioning
his injuries?</p>

<p>EPIFANIA. There is no compensation due to Mr Blenderbland. He
deserved what he got, whatever that was.</p>

<p>SAGAMORE. But he will take an action against you.</p>

<p>EPIFANIA. Take one against him first.</p>

<p>SAGAMORE. What for?</p>

<p>EPIFANIA. For anything; only dont bother me about it. Claim twenty
thousand pounds damages. I tell you I will not be blackmailed.</p>

<p>ADRIAN. Neither will I. I am entitled to compensation and I mean
to have it.</p>

<p>SAGAMORE <i>[coming between them]</i> Steady! steady! please. I
cannot advise either of you to go to law; but quite seriously, Mrs
Fitzfassenden, Mr Blenderbland is entitled to some compensation. You
can afford it.</p>

<p>EPIFANIA. Mr Sagamore: a woman as rich as I am cannot afford
anything. I have to fight to keep every penny I possess. Every
beggar, every blackmailer, every swindler, every charity, every
testimonial, every political cause, every league and brotherhood and
sisterhood, every church and chapel, every institution of every kind
on earth is busy from morning to night trying to bleed me to death.
If I weaken for a moment, if I let a farthing go, I shall be
destitute by the end of the month. I subscribe a guinea a year to the
Income Tax Payers' Defence League; but that is all: absolutely all.
My standing instructions to you are to defend every action and to
forestall every claim for damages by a counter-claim for ten times
the amount. That is the only way in which I can write across the sky
'Hands off My Money.'</p>

<p>SAGAMORE. You see, Mr Blenderbland, it's no use. You must withdraw
your threat of an action.</p>

<p>ADRIAN. I wont.</p>

<p>SAGAMORE. You will. You must. Mrs Fitzfassenden: he can do nothing
against you. Let me make an appeal on his behalf ad
misericordiam.</p>

<p>EPIFANIA <i>[impatiently]</i> Oh, we are wasting time; and I have
more important business to settle. Give him a ten pound note and have
done with it.</p>

<p>ADRIAN. A ten pound note!!!</p>

<p>SAGAMORE <i>[remonstrant]</i> Oh, Mrs Fitzfassenden!</p>

<p>EPIFANIA. Yes: a ten pound note. No man can refuse a ten pound
note if you crackle it under his nose.</p>

<p>SAGAMORE. But he wants two thousand five hundred.</p>

<p>EPIFANIA <i>[rising stupefied]</i> Two thou--<i>[She
gasps].</i></p>

<p>ADRIAN. Not a penny less.</p>

<p>EPIFANIA <i>[going past Sagamore to the couch]</i> Adrian, my
child, I have underrated you. Your cheek, your gluttony, your
obstinacy impose respect on me. I threw a half baked gentleman
downstairs: and my chauffeur picked him up on the mat a magnificently
complete Skunk.</p>

<p>ADRIAN <i>[furious]</i> Five thousand for that, Sagamore: do you
hear?</p>

<p>SAGAMORE. Please! please! Do keep your temper.</p>

<p>ADRIAN. Keep your own temper. Has she lamed you for life? Has she
raised a bump on your head? Has she called you a skunk?</p>

<p>SAGAMORE. No; but she may at any moment.</p>

<p>EPIFANIA <i>[flinging her arms round him with a whoop of
delight]</i> Ha ha! Ha ha! My Sagamore! My treasure! Shall I give him
five thousand on condition that he turns it into a million in six
months?</p>

<p>ADRIAN. I will do what I like with it. I will have it
unconditionally.</p>

<p>SAGAMORE <i>[extricating himself gently from Epifania's hug]</i>
Mr Blenderbland: it is a mistake to go into court in the character of
a man who has been called a skunk. It makes the jury see you in that
light from the start. It is also very difficult for a plaintiff to
get sympathy in the character of a man who has been thrashed by a
woman. If Mrs Fitzfassenden had stabbed you, or shot you, or poisoned
you, that would have been quite in order: your dignity would not have
been compromised. But Mrs Fitzfassenden knows better. She knows the
privileges of her sex to a hair's breadth and never oversteps them.
She would come into court beautifully dressed and looking her best.
No woman can be more ladylike--more feminine--when it is her cue to
play the perfect lady. Long before we can get the case into the lists
the bump on your head will have subsided; your broken bone will have
set; and the color will have come back to your cheeks. Unless you can
provoke Mrs Fitzfassenden to assault you again the day before the
trial--and she is far too clever for that--the chances are a million
to one against you.</p>

<p>ALASTAIR <i>[rising and coming from the other end of the room]</i>
That is so, Blenderbland. You havnt a dog's chance. Next time you see
her fist coming in your direction, duck and counter. If you dont get
that satisfaction you wont get any. <i>[He sits down next Patricia,
on her right].</i></p>

<p>PATRICIA. Yes, Mr Blenderbland: Alastair's right. Ask her nicely,
and perhaps she'll pay your expenses.</p>

<p>ADRIAN <i>[sitting up and taking his head in his hands, shaken,
almost lachrymose]</i> Is there any justice for a man against a
woman?</p>

<p>SAGAMORE <i>[sitting beside him to console him]</i> Believe me:
no. Not against a millionairess.</p>

<p>EPIFANIA. And what justice is there for a millionairess, I should
like to know?</p>

<p>SAGAMORE. In the courts--</p>

<p>EPIFANIA. I am not thinking of the courts: there is little justice
there for anybody. My millions are in themselves an injustice. I
speak of the justice of heaven.</p>

<p>ALASTAIR. Oh Lord! Now we're for it. <i>[He deliberately puts his
arm round Patricia's waist].</i></p>

<p>EPIFANIA. Alastair: how can you jeer at me? Is it just that I,
because I am a millionairess, cannot keep my husband, cannot keep
even a lover, cannot keep anything but my money? There you sit before
my very eyes, snuggling up to that insignificant little nothingness
who cannot afford to pay for her own stockings; and you are happy and
she is happy. <i>[She turns to Adrian]</i> Here is this suit of
clothes on two sticks. What does it contain?</p>

<p>ADRIAN <i>[broken]</i> Let me alone, will you?</p>

<p>EPIFANIA. Something that once resembled a man, something that
liked lending me five pound notes and never asked me to repay them.
Why? Kindness to me? Love of me? No: the swank of a poor man lending
to a millionairess. In my divine wrath I smashed him as a child
smashes a disappointing toy; and when he was beaten down to his real
self I found I was not a woman to him but a bank account with a good
cook.</p>

<p>PATRICIA. Thats all very fine, deary; but the truth is that no one
can live with you.</p>

<p>EPIFANIA. And anyone can live with you. And apparently you can
live with anybody.</p>

<p>ALASTAIR. What Seedy says is God's truth. Nobody could live with
you.</p>

<p>EPIFANIA. But why? Why? Why?</p>

<p>SAGAMORE. Do be reasonable, Mrs Fitzfassenden. Can one live with a
tornado? with an earthquake? with an avalanche?</p>

<p>EPIFANIA. Yes. Thousands of people live on the slopes of
volcanoes, in the track of avalanches, on land thrown up only
yesterday by earthquakes. But with a millionairess who can rise to
her destiny and wield the power her money gives her, no. Well, be it
so. I shall sit in my lonely house, and be myself, and pile up
millions until I find a man good enough to be to me what Alastair is
to Seedystockings.</p>

<p>PATRICIA. Well, I hope you wont have to wait too long.</p>

<p>EPIFANIA. I never wait. I march on; and when I come upon the
things I need I grab them. I grabbed your Alastair. I find that he
does not suit me: he beats me--</p>

<p>ALASTAIR. In self-defence. I never raised a hand to you except in
self-defence.</p>

<p>EPIFANIA. Yes: you are like the great European Powers: you never
fight except in self-defence. But you are two stone heavier than I;
and I cannot keep my head at infighting as you can. You do not suit.
I throw you to Greedy-Seedy-Stockings: you can punch her to your
heart's content. Mr Sagamore: arrange the divorce. Cruelty and
adultery.</p>

<p>PATRICIA. But I dont like this: it's not fair to Alastair. Why is
he to be divorced instead of you?</p>

<p>EPIFANIA. Mr Sagamore: take an action against Patricia Smith for
alienating my husband's affections. Damages twenty thousand
pounds.</p>

<p>PATRICIA. Oh! Is such a thing possible, Mr Sagamore?</p>

<p>SAGAMORE. I am afraid it is, Miss Smith. Quite possible.</p>

<p>PATRICIA. Well, my dear old father used to say that in the law
courts there is only one way to beat the people who have unlimited
money; and that is to have no money at all. You cant get twenty
thousand out of me. And call it vanity if you will; but I should
rather like the world to know that in my little way I was able to
take the best and dearest man in England from the richest woman.</p>

<p>EPIFANIA. Damn your dear old father!</p>

<p>ALASTAIR <i>[laughing boisterously]</i> Ha ha! One for you, Eppy.
<i>[He kisses Patricia].</i></p>

<p>SAGAMORE <i>[smiling]</i> I am afraid the laugh is with old Mr
Smith, Mrs Fitzfassenden. Where there is nothing, the king loses his
rights.</p>

<p>EPIFANIA. Oh, I can bear no more of this. I will not have my life
dragged down to planes of vulgarity on which I cannot breathe. I will
live in utter loneliness and keep myself sacred until I find the
right man--the man who can stand with me on the utmost heights and
not lose his head--the mate created for me in heaven. He must be
somewhere.</p>

<p>THE DOCTOR <i>[appearing at the door]</i> The manager says I am
wanted here. Who wants me?</p>

<p>EPIFANIA. <i>I</i> want you. Come here <i>[she stretches out her
hand to him imperiously].</i></p>

<p>THE DOCTOR <i>[coming to her and feeling her pulse]</i> Something
wrong with your blood pressure, eh? <i>[Amazed]</i> Ooooh!! I have
never felt such a pulse. It is like a slow sledge hammer.</p>

<p>EPIFANIA. Well, is my pulse my fault?</p>

<p>THE DOCTOR. No. It is the will of Allah. All our pulses are part
of the will of Allah.</p>

<p>ALASTAIR. Look here, you know, Doc: that wont go down in this
country. We dont believe in Allah.</p>

<p>THE DOCTOR. That does not disconcert Allah in the least, my
friend. The pulse beats still, slow, strong. <i>[To Epifania]</i> You
are a terrible woman; but I love your pulse. I have never felt
anything like it before.</p>

<p>PATRICIA. Well, just fancy that! He loves her pulse.</p>

<p>THE DOCTOR. I am a doctor. Women as you fancy them are nothing to
me but bundles of ailments. But the life! the pulse! is the heartbeat
of Allah, save in Whom there is no majesty and no might. <i>[He drops
her hand].</i></p>

<p>EPIFANIA. My pulse will never change: this is the love I crave
for. I will marry you. Mr Sagamore: see about a special licence the
moment you have got rid of Alastair.</p>

<p>THE DOCTOR. It is not possible. We are bound by our vows.</p>

<p>EPIFANIA. Well, have I not passed your mother's test? You shall
have an accountant's certificate. I learned in the first half hour of
my search for employment that the living wage for a single woman is
five shillings a week. Before the end of the week I had made enough
to support me for a hundred years. I did it honestly and
legitimately. I explained the way in which it was done.</p>

<p>THE DOCTOR. It was not the way of Allah, the Merciful, the
Compassionate. Had you added a farthing an hour to the wages of those
sweated women, that wicked business would have crashed on your head.
You sold it to the man Superflew for the last penny of his savings;
and the women still slave for him at one piastre an hour.</p>

<p>EPIFANIA. You cannot change the market price of labor: not Allah
himself can do that. But I came to this hotel as a scullery maid: the
most incompetent scullery maid that ever broke a dinner service. I am
now its owner; and there is no tuppence-hapeny an hour here.</p>

<p>THE DOCTOR. The hotel looks well in photographs; and the wages you
pay would be a fortune to a laborer on the Nile. But what of the old
people whose natural home this place had become? the old man with his
paralytic stroke? the old woman gone mad? the cast out creatures in
the workhouse? Was not this preying on the poverty of the poor? Shall
I, the servant of Allah, live on such gains? Shall I, the healer, the
helper, the guardian of life and the counsellor of health, unite with
the exploiter of misery?</p>

<p>EPIFANIA. I have to take the world as I find it.</p>

<p>THE DOCTOR. The wrath of Allah shall overtake those who leave the
world no better than they found it.</p>

<p>EPIFANIA. I think Allah loves those who make money.</p>

<p>SAGAMORE. All the evidence is that way, certainly.</p>

<p>THE DOCTOR. I do not see it so. I see that riches are a curse;
poverty is a curse; only in the service of Allah is there justice,
righteousness, and happiness. But all this talk is idle. This lady
has easily fulfilled the condition imposed by my mother. But I have
not fulfilled the condition imposed by the lady's father.</p>

<p>EPIFANIA. You need not trouble about that. The six months have not
expired. I will shew you how to turn your hundred and fifty pounds
into fifty thousand.</p>

<p>THE DOCTOR. You cannot. It is gone.</p>

<p>EPIFANIA. Oh, you cannot have spent it all: you who live like a
mouse. There must be some of it left.</p>

<p>THE DOCTOR. Not a penny. Not a piastre. Allah--</p>

<p>EPIFANIA. Oh, bother Allah! What did you do with it?</p>

<p>THE DOCTOR. Allah is never bothered. On that afternoon when you
left me to earn your own living I called upon the Merciful, the
Compassionate, to reveal to me whether you were not one of the
strokes of his infinite humor. Then I sat down and took up a
newspaper. And behold! a paragraph headed Wills and Bequests. I read
a name that I cannot remember: Mrs Somebody of Clapham Park, one
hundred and twentytwo thousand pounds. She had never done anything
but live in Clapham Park; and she left &pound;122,000. But what was
the next name? It was that of the teacher who changed my whole life
and gave me a new soul by opening the world of science to me. I was
his assistant for four years. He used to make his own apparatus for
his experiments; and one day he needed a filament of metal that would
resist a temperature that melted platinum like sealing wax.</p>

<p>EPIFANIA. Buy his patent for me if it has not been snapped up.</p>

<p>THE DOCTOR. He never took out a patent. He believed that knowledge
is no man's property. And he had neither time nor money to waste in
patent offices. Millions have been made out of that discovery of his
by people who care nothing about science and everything about money.
He left four hundred pounds and a widow: the good woman who had been
a second mother to me. A shilling a day for her at most: not even one
piastre an hour.</p>

<p>EPIFANIA. That comes of marrying an incompetent dreamer. Are you
going to beg for her? I warn you I am tired of destitute widows. I
should be a beggar myself if I took them all on my shoulders.</p>

<p>THE DOCTOR. Have no fear. The Merciful, the Compassionate heard
the prayer of the widow. Listen. I once cured a Prime Minister when
he imagined himself to be ill. I went to him and told him that it was
the will of Allah that the widow should have a civil list pension.
She received it: a hundred pounds a year. I went to the great
Metallurgical Trust which exploits his discovery, and told them that
her poverty was a scandal in the face of Allah. They were rich and
generous: they made a special issue of founders' shares for her,
worth three hundred a year to her. They called it letting her in on
the ground floor. May her prayers win them favor from Him save in
whom there is no might and no majesty! But all this took time. The
illness, the nurse, the funeral, the disposal of the laboratory, the
change to a cheaper lodging, had left her without a penny, though no
doctor and no lawyer took a farthing, and the shopkeepers were
patient; for the spirit of Allah worked more strongly upon them than
on the British Treasury, which clamored for its little death duty.
Between the death and the pensions there was a gap exactly one
hundred and fifty pounds wide. He who is just and exact supplied that
sum by your chauffeur's hands and by mine. It rejoiced my heart as
money had never rejoiced it before. But instead of coming to you with
fifty thousand pounds I am in arrear with my bill for my daily bread
in your hotel, and am expecting every day to be told by your manager
that this cannot go on: I must settle.</p>

<p>ALASTAIR. Well, old man, you may not have done a lot for yourself;
but you have done damned well for the widow. And you have escaped
Eppy. She wont marry you with your pockets empty.</p>

<p>EPIFANIA. Pray why? Fifty thousand pounds must have been made out
of that discovery ten times over. The doctor, in putting my money
into the widow's necessary expenses, may be said to have made a
retrospective investment in the discovery. And he has shewn the
greatest ability in the affair: has he not, Mr Sagamore?</p>

<p>SAGAMORE. Unquestionably. He has bowled out the Prime Minister. He
has bowled out the Imperial Metallurgical Trust. He has settled the
widow's affairs to perfection.</p>

<p>THE DOCTOR. But not my own affairs. I am in debt for my food.</p>

<p>EPIFANIA. Well, if you come to that, <i>I</i> am in debt for my
food. I got a letter this morning from my purveyors to say that I
have paid them nothing for two years, and unless I let them have
something on account they will be obliged to resort to the
premises.</p>

<p>THE DOCTOR. What does that mean?</p>

<p>EPIFANIA. Sell my furniture.</p>

<p>THE DOCTOR. You cannot sell mine, I am afraid. I have hardly
any.</p>

<p>BLENDERBLAND. If you have a stick she will sell it. She is the
meanest woman in England.</p>

<p>EPIFANIA. That is why I am also the richest. Mr Sagamore: my mind
is made up: I will marry this doctor. Ascertain his name and make the
necessary arrangements.</p>

<p>BLENDERBLAND. You take care, doctor. She is unfaithful to her
husband in wanting to marry you. She flirted with me: took me down
the river and made me believe I was to be Alastair's successor before
ever she saw you. See what she has done to me! She will do it to you
when the next man takes her fancy.</p>

<p>THE DOCTOR <i>[to Epifania]</i> What have you to say to that?</p>

<p>EPIFANIA. You must learn to take chances in this world. This
disappointed philanderer tries to frighten you with my
unfaithfulness. He has never been married: I have. And I tell you
that in the very happiest marriages not a day passes without a
thousand moments of unfaithfulness. You begin by thinking you have
only one husband: you find you have a dozen. There is a creature you
hate and despise and are tied to for life; and before breakfast is
over the fool says something nice and becomes a man whom you admire
and love; and between these extremes there are a thousand degrees
with a different man and woman at each of them. A wife is all women
to one man: she is everything that is devilish: the thorn in his
flesh, the jealous termagant, the detective dogging all his
movements, the nagger, the scolder, the worrier. He has only to tell
her an affectionate lie and she is his comfort, his helper, at best
his greatest treasure, at worst his troublesome but beloved child.
All wives are all these women in one, all husbands all these men in
one. What do the unmarried know of this infinitely dangerous heart
tearing everchanging life of adventure that we call marriage? Face it
as you would face a dangerous operation: have you not performed
hundreds of them?</p>

<p>THE DOCTOR. Of a surety there is no wit and no wisdom like that of
a woman ensnaring the mate chosen for her by Allah. Yet I am very
well as I am. Why should I change? I shall be very happy as an old
bachelor.</p>

<p>EPIFANIA <i>[flinging out her wrist at him]</i> Can you feel my
pulse every day as an old bachelor?</p>

<p>THE DOCTOR <i>[taking her wrist and mechanically taking out his
watch at the same time]</i> Ah! I had forgotten the pulse. One, two,
three: it is irresistible: it is a pulse in a hundred thousand. I
love it: I cannot give it up.</p>

<p>BLENDERBLAND. You will regret it to the last day of your life.</p>

<p>EPIFANIA. Mr Sagamore: you have your instructions.</p>

<p>SAGAMORE <i>[bows]</i>!</p>

<p>PATRICIA. Congratulations, darling.</p>

<p> </p>

<blockquote>
<p><i>And that is how the story ends in capitalist countries. In
Russia, however, and in countries with Communist sympathies, the
people demand that the tale shall have an edifying moral.
Accordingly, when the doctor, feeling Epifania's pulse, says that he
loves it and cannot give it up, Blenderbland continues the
conversation as follows.</i></p>
</blockquote>

<p> </p>

<p>BLENDERBLAND. Take care. Her hand is accursed. It is the hand of
Midas: it turns everything it touches to gold.</p>

<p>THE DOCTOR. My hand is more deeply accursed. Gold flies away from
it. Why am I always poor? I do not like being poor.</p>

<p>EPIFANIA. Why am I always rich? I do not like being rich.</p>

<p>ALASTAIR. Youd better both go to Russia, where there are neither
rich nor poor.</p>

<p>EPIFANIA. Why not? I buy nothing but Russian stock now.</p>

<p>BLENDERBLAND. The Russians would shoot you as they would a mad
dog. You are a bloated capitalist, you know.</p>

<p>EPIFANIA. I am a capitalist here; but in Russia I should be a
worker. And what a worker! My brains are wasted here: the wealth they
create is thrown away on idlers and their parasites, whilst poverty,
dirt, disease, misery and slavery surround me like a black sea in
which I may be engulfed at any moment by a turn of the money market.
Russia needs managing women like me. In Moscow I shall not be a
millionairess; but I shall be in the Sovnarkom within six months and
in the Politbureau before the end of the year. Here I have no real
power, no real freedom, and no security at all: we may all die in the
workhouse. In Russia I shall have such authority! such scope for my
natural powers! as the Empress Catherine never enjoyed. I swear that
before I have been twenty years in Russia every Russian baby shall
weigh five pounds heavier and every Russian man and woman live ten
years longer. I shall not be an empress; and I may work myself to
death; but in a thousand years from now holy Russia shall again have
a patron saint, and her name shall be Saint Epifania.</p>

<p>BLENDERBLAND. The egotism of that woman!!</p>

<p>SAGAMORE. I am afraid there are no saints now in Russia.</p>

<p>THE DOCTOR. There are saints everywhere: they are the one species
you cannot liquidate. Kings, emperors, conquerors, pontiffs and all
the other idols are swept away sooner or later; and all the king's
horses and all the king's men cannot set them up again; but the
saints shall reign for ever and ever in the temple of the hammer and
the sickle. But we must not go to Russia, because the Russians do not
need us: they have stayed at home and saved their own souls. Ought
not we to stay at home and save ours? Why not make the British Empire
a Soviet republic?</p>

<p>EPIFANIA. By all means; but we shall have to liquidate all the
adult inhabitants and begin with the newly born. And the first step
to that is to get married. Mr Sagamore: make the necessary
arrangements.</p>

<p>SAGAMORE <i>[bows]</i>!</p>

<p>PATRICIA. Congratulations, darling.</p>
