<br>
This work was on the point of publication when the great events of
July took place and turned every mind in a direction which does not
encourage the play of the imagination. We have reason to believe
that the following pages were written in 1827.</p>

<p style="margin-left:30%">The truth, the harsh truth<br>

<h2><a name="ch1" id="ch1"></a>Chapter 1. A Small Town</h2>

<p style="margin-left:10%">Put thousands together<br>
Less bad,<br>
But the cage less gay.<br>
&mdash;HOBBES</p>

<p>The small town of Verrières may be regarded as one of the most
attractive in the Franche-Comté. Its white houses with their high
pitched roofs of red tiles are spread over the slope of a hill, the
slightest contours of which are indicated by clumps of sturdy
chestnuts. The Doubs runs some hundreds of feet below its
fortifications, built in times past by the Spaniards, and now in
ruins.</p>

<p>Verrières is sheltered on the north by a high mountain, a spur
of the Jura. The jagged peaks of the Verra put on a mantle of snow
in the first cold days of October. A torrent which comes tearing
down from the mountain passes through Verrières before emptying its
waters into the Doubs, and supplies power to a great number of
sawmills; this is an extremely simple industry, and procurés a
certain degree of comfort for the majority of the inhabitants, who
are of the peasant rather than of the burgess class. It is not,
however, the sawmills that have made this little town rich. It is
to the manufacture of printed calicoes, known as Mulhouse stuffs,
that it owes the general prosperity which, since the fall of
Napoleon, has led to the refacing of almost all the houses in
Verrières.</p>

<p>No sooner has one entered the town than one is startled by the
din of a noisy machine of terrifying aspect. A score of weighty
hammers, falling with a clang which makes the pavement tremble, are
raised aloft by a wheel which the water of the torrent sets in
motion. Each of these hammers turns out, daily, I cannot say how
many thousands of nails. A bevy of fresh, pretty girls subject to
the blows of these enormous hammers, the little scraps of iron
which are rapidly transformed into nails. This work, so rough to
the outward eye, is one of the industries that most astonish the
traveller who ventures for the first time among the mountains that
divide France from Switzerland. If, on entering Verrières, the
traveller inquires to whom belongs that fine nail factory which
deafens everybody who passes up the main street, he will be told in
a drawling accent: 'Eh! It belongs to the Mayor.'</p>

<p>Provided the traveller halts for a few moments in this main
street of Verrières, which runs from the bank of the Doubs nearly
to the summit of the hill, it is a hundred to one that he will see
a tall man appear, with a busy, important air.</p>

<p>At the sight of him every hat is quickly raised. His hair is
turning grey, and he is dressed in grey. He is a Companion of
several Orders, has a high forehead, an aquiline nose, and on the
whole his face is not wanting in a certain regularity: indeed, the
first impression formed of it may be that it combines with the
dignity of a village mayor that sort of charm which may still be
found in a man of forty-eight or fifty. But soon the visitor from
Paris is annoyed by a certain air of self-satisfaction and
self-sufficiency mingled with a suggestion of limitations and want
of originality. One feels, finally, that this man's talent is
confined to securing the exact payment of whatever is owed to him
and to postponing payment till the last possible moment when he is
the debtor.</p>

<p>Such is the Mayor of Verrières, M. de Rênal. Crossing the street
with a solemn step, he enters the town hall and passes from the
visitor's sight. But, a hundred yards higher up, if the visitor
continues his stroll, he will notice a house of quite imposing
appearance, and, through the gaps in an iron railing belonging to
the house, some splendid gardens. Beyond, there is a line of
horizon formed by the hills of Burgundy, which seem to have been
created on purpose to delight the eye. This view makes the visitor
forget the pestilential atmosphere of small financial interests
which was beginning to stifle him.</p>

<p>He is told that this house belongs to M. de Rênal. It is to the
profits that he has made from his great nail factory that the Mayor
of Verrières is indebted for this fine freestone house which he has
just finished building. His family, they say, is Spanish, old, and
was or claims to have been established in the country long before
Louis XIV conquered it.</p>

<p>Since 1815 he has blushed at his connection with industry: 1815
made him Mayor of Verrières. The retaining walls that support the
various sections of this splendid garden, which, in a succession of
terraces, runs down to the Doubs, are also a reward of M. de
Rênal's ability as a dealer in iron.</p>

<p>You must not for a moment expect to find in France those
picturesque gardens which enclose the manufacturing towns of
Germany; Leipsic, Frankfurt, Nuremberg, and the rest. In the
Franche-Comté, the more walls a man builds, the more he makes his
property bristle with stones piled one above another, the greater
title he acquires to the respect of his neighbours. M. de Rênal's
gardens, honeycombed with walls, are still further admired because
he bought, for their weight in gold, certain minute scraps of
ground which they cover. For instance that sawmill whose curious
position on the bank of the Doubs struck you as you entered
Verrières, and on which you noticed the name <i>Sorel</i>,
inscribed in huge letters on a board which overtops the roof,
occupied, six years ago, the ground on which at this moment they
are building the wall of the fourth terrace of M. de Rênal's
gardens.</p>

<p>For all his pride, the Mayor was obliged to make many overtures
to old Sorel, a dour and obstinate peasant; he was obliged to pay
him in fine golden louis before he would consent to remove his mill
elsewhere. As for the <i>public</i> lade which supplied power to
the saw, M. de Rênal, thanks to the influence he wielded in Paris,
obtained leave to divert it. This favour was conferred upon him
after the 182- elections.</p>

<p>He gave Sorel four acres in exchange for one, five hundred yards
lower down by the bank of the Doubs. And, albeit this site was a
great deal more advantageous for his trade in planks of firwood,
Père Sorel, as they have begun to call him now that he is rich,
contrived to screw out of the impatience and <i>land-owning
mania</i> which animated his neighbour a sum of 6,000 francs.</p>

<p>It is true that this arrangement was adversely criticised by the
local wiseacres. On one occasion, it was a Sunday, four years
later, M. de Rênal, as he walked home from church in his mayoral
attire, saw at a distance old Sorel, supported by his three sons,
watching him with a smile. That smile cast a destroying ray of
light into the Mayor's soul; ever since then he has been thinking
that he might have brought about the exchange at less cost to
himself.</p>

<p>To win popular esteem at Verrières, the essential thing is not
to adopt (while still building plenty of walls) any plan of
construction brought from Italy by those masons who in spring pass
through the gorges of the Jura on their way to Paris. Such an
innovation would earn the rash builder an undying reputation fot
<i>wrong-headedness</i>, and he would be lost forever among the
sober and moderate folk who create reputations in the
Franche-Comté.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact, these sober folk wield there the most
irritating form of <i>despotism</i>; it is owing to that vile word
that residence in small towns is intolerable to anyone who has
lived in that great republic which we call Paris. The tyranny of
public opinion (and what an opinion!) is as fatuous in the small
towns of France as it is in the United States of America.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch2" id="ch2"></a>Chapter 2. A Mayor</h2>

<p style="margin-left:10%">Prestige! Sir, is it nothing? To be
revered by fools, gaped at by children, envied by the rich and
scorned by the wise.<br>
&mdash;BARNAVE</p>

<p>Fortunately for M. de Rênal's reputation as an administrator, a
huge retaining wall was required for the public avenue which skirts
the hillside a hundred feet above the bed of the Doubs. To this
admirable position it is indebted for one of the most picturesque
views in France. But, every spring, torrents of rainwater made
channels across the avenue, carved deep gullies in it and left it
impassable. This nuisance, which affected everybody alike, placed
M. de Rênal under the fortunate obligation to immortalise his
administration by a wall twenty feet in height and seventy or
eighty yards long.</p>

<p>The parapet of this wall, to securé which M. de Rênal was
obliged to make three journeys to Paris, for the Minister of the
Interior before last had sworn a deadly enmity to the Verrières
avenue; the parapet of this wall now rises four feet above the
ground. And, as though to defy all Ministers past and present, it
is being finished off at this moment with slabs of dressed
stone.</p>

<p>How often, my thoughts straying back to the ball-rooms of Paris,
which I had forsaken overnight, my elbows leaning upon those great
blocks of stone of a fine grey with a shade of blue in it, have I
swept with my gaze the vale of the Doubs! Over there, on the left
bank, are five or six winding valleys, along the folds of which the
eye can make out quite plainly a number of little streams. After
leaping from rock to rock, they may be seen falling into the Doubs.
The sun is extremely hot in these mountains; when it is directly
overhead, the traveller's rest is sheltered on this terrace by a
row of magnificent planes. Their rapid growth, and handsome foliage
of a bluish tint are due to the artificial soil with which the
Mayor has filled in the space behind his immense retaining wall,
for, despite the opposition of the town council, he has widened the
avenue by more than six feet (although he is an Ultra and I myself
a Liberal, I give him credit for it), that is why, in his opinion
and in that of M. Valenod, the fortunate governor of the Verrières
poorhouse, this terrace is worthy to be compared with that of
Saint-Germain-en-Laye.</p>

<p>For my part, I have only one fault to find with the <i>Cours de
la Fidélité</i>: one reads this, its official title, in fifteen or
twenty places, on marble slabs which have won M. de Rênal yet
another Cross; what I should be inclined to condemn in the Cours de
la Fidélité is the barbarous manner in which the authorities keep
these sturdy plane trees trimmed and pollarded. Instead of
suggesting, with their low, rounded, flattened heads, the commonest
of kitchen garden vegetables, they would like nothing better than
to assume those magnificent forms which one sees them wear in
England. But the Mayor's will is despotic, and twice a year every
tree belonging to the commune is pitilessly lopped. The Liberals of
the place maintain, but they exaggerate, that the hand of the
official gardener has grown much more severe since the Reverend
Vicar Maslon formed the habit of appropriating the clippings.</p>

<p>This young cleric was sent from Besançon, some years ago, to
keep an eye upon the Abbé Chélan and certain parish priests of the
district. An old Surgeon-Major of the Army of Italy, in retirement
at Verrières, who in his time had been simultaneously, according to
the Mayor, a Jacobin and a Bonapartist, actually ventured one day
to complain to him of the periodical mutilation of these fine
trees.</p>

<p>'I like shade,' replied M. de Rênal with the touch of arrogance
appropriate when one is addressing a surgeon, a Member of the
Legion of Honour; 'I like shade, I have <i>my</i> trees cut so as
to give shade, and I do not consider that a tree is made for any
other purpose, unless, like the useful walnut, it <i>yields a
return</i>.'</p>

<p>There you have the great phrase that decides everything at
Verrières: YIELD A RETURN; it by itself represents the habitual
thought of more than three fourths of the inhabitants.</p>

<p><i>Yielding a return</i> is the consideration that settles
everything in this little town which seemed to you, just now, so
attractive. The stranger arriving there, beguiled by the beauty of
the cool, deep valleys on every side, imagines at first that the
inhabitants are influenced by the idea of <i>beauty</i>; they are
always talking about the beauty of their scenery: no one can deny
that they make a great to-do about it; but this is because it
attracts a certain number of visitors whose money goes to enrich
the innkeepers, and thus, through the channel of the
rate-collector, <i>yields a return to the town</i>.</p>

<p>It was a fine day in autumn and M. de Rênal was strolling along
the Cours de la Fidélité, his lady on his arm. While she listened
to her husband, who was speaking with an air of gravity, Madame de
Rênal's eye was anxiously following the movements of three little
boys. The eldest, who might be about eleven, was continually
running to the parapet as though about to climb on top. A gentle
voice then uttered the name Adolphe, and the child abandoned his
ambitious project. Madame de Rênal looked like a woman of thirty,
but was still extremely pretty.</p>

<p>'He may live to rue the day, that fine gentleman from Paris,' M.
de Rênal was saying in a tone of annoyance, his cheek paler even
than was its wont. 'I myself am not entirely without friends at
Court...'</p>

<p>But albeit I mean to speak to you of provincial life for two
hundred pages, I shall not be so barbarous as to inflict upon you
the tedium and all the <i>clever turns</i> of a provincial
dialogue.</p>

<p>This fine gentleman from Paris, so odious to the Mayor of
Verrières, was none other than M. Appert*, who, a couple of days
earlier, had contrived to make his way not only into the prison and
the poorhouse of Verrières, but also into the hospital,
administered gratuitously by the Mayor and the principal landowners
of the neighbourhood.</p>

<p class="footnote">[* A contemporary philanthropist and prison
visitor.]</p>

<p>'But,' Madame de Rênal put in timidly, 'what harm can this
gentleman from Paris do you, since you provide for the welfare of
the poor with the most scrupulous honesty?'</p>

<p>'He has only come to cast blame, and then he'll go back and have
articles put in the Liberal papers.'</p>

<p>'You never read them, my dear.'</p>

<p>'But people tell us about those Jacobin articles; all that
distracts us, and <i>hinders us from doing good</i>.* As for me, I
shall never forgive the curé.'</p>

<p class="footnote">[* Author's footnote: authentic.]</p>

<h2><a name="ch3" id="ch3"></a>Chapter 3. The Bread of the
Poor</h2>

<p style="margin-left:10%">A virtuous priest who does not involve
himself in intrigue is a blessing for the village.<br>
&mdash;FLEURY</p>

<p>It should be explained that the curé of Verrières, an old man of
eighty, but blessed by the keen air of his mountains with an iron
character and strength, had the right to visit at any hour of the
day the prison, the hospital, and even the poorhouse. It was at six
o'clock in the morning precisely that M. Appert, who was armed with
an introduction to the curé from Paris, had had the good sense to
arrive in an inquisitive little town. He had gone at once to the
presbytery.</p>

<p>As he read the letter addressed to him by M. le Marquis de La
Mole, a Peer of France, and the wealthiest landowner in the
province, the curé Chélan sat lost in thought.</p>

<p>'I am old and liked here,' he murmured to himself at length,
'they would never dare!' Turning at once to the gentleman from
Paris, with eyes in which, despite his great age, there burned that
sacred fire which betokens the pleasure of performing a fine action
which is slightly dangerous:</p>

<p>'Come with me, Sir, and, in the presence of the gaoler and
especially of the superintendents of the poorhouse, be so good as
not to express any opinion of the things we shall see.' M. Appert
realised that he had to deal with a man of feeling; he accompanied
the venerable curé, visited the prison, the hospital, the
poorhouse, asked many questions and, notwithstanding strange
answers, did not allow himself to utter the least word of
reproach.</p>

<p>This visit lasted for some hours. The curé invited M. Appert to
dine with him, but was told that his guest had some letters to
write: he did not wish to compromise his kind friend any further.
About three o'clock, the gentlemen went back to complete their
inspection of the poorhouse, after which they returned to the
prison. There they found the gaoler standing in the doorway; a
giant six feet tall, with bandy legs; terror had made his mean face
hideous.</p>

<p>'Ah, Sir,' he said to the curé, on catching sight of him, 'is
not this gentleman, that I see with you, M. Appert?'</p>

<p>'What if he is?' said the curé.</p>

<p>'Because yesterday I received the most definite instructions,
which the Prefect sent down by a gendarme who had to gallop all
night long, not to allow M. Appert into the prison.'</p>

<p>'I declare to you, M. Noiroud,' said the curé, 'that this
visitor, who is in my company, is M. Appert. Do you admit that I
have the right to enter the prison at any hour of the day or night,
bringing with me whom I please?'</p>

<p>'Yes, M. le curé,' the gaoler murmured in a subdued tone,
lowering his head like a bulldog brought reluctantly to obedience
by fear of the stick. 'Only, M. le curé, I have a wife and
children, if I am reported I shall be dismissed; I have only my
place here to live on.'</p>

<p>'I too should be very sorry to lose mine,' replied the worthy
curé, in a voice swayed by ever increasing emotion.</p>

<p>'What a difference!' the gaoler answered promptly; 'why you, M.
le curé, we know that you have an income of 800 livres, a fine
place in the sun...'</p>

<p>Such are the events which, commented upon, exaggerated in twenty
different ways, had been arousing for the last two days all the
evil passions of the little town of Verrières. At that moment they
were serving as text for the little discussion which M. de Rênal
was having with his wife. That morning, accompanied by M. Valenod,
the governor of the poorhouse, he had gone to the curé's house, to
inform him of their extreme displeasure. M. Chélan was under no
one's protection; he felt the full force of their words.</p>

<p>'Well, gentlemen, I shall be the third parish priest, eighty
years of age, to be deprived of his living in this district. I have
been here for six and fifty years; I have christened almost all the
inhabitants of the town, which was no more than a village when I
came. Every day I marry young couples whose grandparents I married
long ago. Verrières is my family; but I said to myself, when I saw
the stranger: "This man, who has come from Paris, may indeed be a
Liberal, there are far too many of them; but what harm can he do to
our poor people and our prisoners?"'</p>

<p>The reproaches of M. de Rênal, and above all those of M.
Valenod, the governor of the poorhouse, becoming more and more
bitter:</p>

<p>'Very well, gentlemen, have me deprived,' the old curé had
cried, in a quavering voice. 'I shall live in the town all the
same. You all know that forty-eight years ago I inherited a piece
of land which brings me 800 livres; I shall live on that income. I
save nothing out of my stipend, gentlemen, and that may be why I am
less alarmed when people speak of taking it from me.'</p>

<p>M. de Rênal lived on excellent terms with his wife; but not
knowing what answer to make to the question, which she timidly
repeated: 'What harm can this gentleman from Paris do to the
prisoners?' he was just about to lose his temper altogether when
she uttered a cry. Her second son had climbed upon the parapet of
the wall of the terrace, and was running along it, though this wall
rose more than twenty feet from the vineyard beneath. The fear of
alarming her son and so making him fall restrained Madame de Rênal
from calling him. Finally the child, who was laughing at his own
prowess, turned to look at his mother, noticed how pale she was,
sprang down upon the avenue and ran to join her. He was well
scolded.</p>

<p>This little incident changed the course of the conversation.</p>

<p>'I am quite determined to engage young Sorel, the sawyer's son,'
said M. de Rênal; 'he will look after the children, who are
beginning to be too much of a handful for us. He is a young priest
or thereabouts, a good Latin scholar, and will bring the children
on; for he has a strong character, the curé says. I shall give him
300 francs and his board. I had some doubts as to his morals; for
he was the Benjamin of that old surgeon, the Member of the Legion
of Honour who on pretence of being their cousin came to live with
the Sorels. He might quite well have been nothing better than a
secret agent of the Liberals; he said that our mountain air was
good for his asthma; but that has never been proved. He had served
in all <i>Buonaparte's</i> campaigns in Italy, and they even say
that he voted against the Empire in his day. This Liberal taught
young Sorel Latin, and left him all the pile of books he brought
here with him. Not that I should ever have dreamed of having the
carpenter's son with my children; but the curé, only the day before
the scene which has made a permanent breach between us, told me
that this Sorel has been studying theology for the last three
years, with the idea of entering the Seminary; so he is not a
Liberal, and he is a Latin scholar.</p>

<p>'This arrangement suits me in more ways than one,' M. de Rênal
went on, looking at his wife with an air of diplomacy; 'Valenod is
tremendously proud of the two fine Norman horses he has just bought
for his calash. But he has not got a tutor for his children.'</p>

<p>'He is quite capable of taking this one from us.'</p>

<p>'Then you approve of my plan?' said M. de Rênal, thanking his
wife, with a smile, for the excellent idea that had just occurred
to her. 'There, that's settled.'</p>

<p>'Oh, good gracious, my dear, how quickly you make up your
mind!'</p>

<p>'That is because I have a strong character, as the curé has had
occasion to see. Let us make no pretence about it, we are
surrounded by Liberals here. All these cloth merchants are jealous
of me, I am certain of it; two or three of them are growing rich;
very well, I wish them to see M. de Rênal's children go by, out
walking in the care of <i>their tutor</i>. It will make an
impression. My grandfather used often to tell us that in his young
days he had had a tutor. It's a hundred crowns he's going to cost
me, but that will have to be reckoned as a necessary expense to
keep up our position.'</p>

<p>This sudden decision plunged Madame de Rênal deep in thought.
She was a tall, well-made woman, who had been the beauty of the
place, as the saying is in this mountain district. She had a
certain air of simplicity and bore herself like a girl; in the eyes
of a Parisian, that artless grace, full of innocence and vivacity,
might even have suggested ideas of a mildly passionate nature. Had
she had wind of this kind of success, Madame de Rênal would have
been thoroughly ashamed of it. No trace either of coquetry or of
affectation had ever appeared in her nature. M. Valenod, the
wealthy governor of the poorhouse, was supposed to have paid his
court to her, but without success, a failure which had given a
marked distinction to her virtue; for this M. Valenod, a tall young
man, strongly built, with a vivid complexion and bushy black
whiskers, was one of those coarse, brazen, noisy creatures who in
the provinces are called fine men.</p>

<p>Madame de Rênal, being extremely shy and liable to be swayed by
her moods, was offended chiefly by the restless movements and loud
voice of M. Valenod. The distaste that she felt for what at
Verrières goes by the name of gaiety had won her the reputation of
being extremely proud of her birth. She never gave it a thought,
but had been greatly pleased to see the inhabitants of Verrières
come less frequently to her house. We shall not attempt to conceal
the fact that she was reckoned a fool in the eyes of <i>their</i>
ladies, because, without any regard for her husband's interests,
she let slip the most promising opportunities of procuring fine
hats from Paris or Besançon. Provided that she was left alone to
stroll in her fine garden, she never made any complaint.</p>

<p>She was a simple soul, who had never risen even to the point of
criticising her husband, and admitting that he bored her. She
supposed, without telling herself so, that between husband and wife
there could be no more tender relations. She was especially fond of
M. de Rênal when he spoke to her of his plans for their children,
one of whom he intended to place in the army, the second on the
bench, and the third in the church. In short, she found M. de Rênal
a great deal less boring than any of the other men of her
acquaintance.</p>

<p>This wifely opinion was justified. The Mayor of Verrières owed
his reputation for wit, and better still for good tone, to half a
dozen pleasantries which he had inherited from an uncle. This old
Captain de Rênal had served before the Revolution in the Duke of
Orleans's regiment of infantry, and, when he went to Paris, had had
the right of entry into that Prince's drawing-rooms. He had there
seen Madame de Montesson, the famous Madame de Genlis, M. Ducrest,
the 'inventor' of the Palais-Royal. These personages figured all
too frequently in M. de Rênal's stories. But by degrees these
memories of things that it required so much delicacy to relate had
become a burden to him, and for some time now it was only on solemn
occasions that he would repeat his anecdotes of the House of
Orleans. As he was in other respects most refined, except when the
talk ran on money, he was regarded, and rightly, as the most
aristocratic personage in Verrières.</p>

<h2><a name="ch4" id="ch4"></a>Chapter 4. Father and Son</h2>

<p style="margin-left:10%">E sarà mia colpa,<br>
Se cosi e?<br>
&mdash;MACHIAVELLI</p>

<p>'My wife certainly has a head on her shoulders!' the Mayor of
Verrières remarked to himself the following morning at six o'clock,
as he made his way down to Père Sorel's sawmill. 'Although I said
so to her, to maintain my own superiority, it had never occurred to
me that if I do not take this little priest Sorel, who, they tell
me, knows his Latin like an angel, the governor of the poorhouse,
that restless spirit, might very well have the same idea, and
snatch him from me, I can hear the tone of conceit with which he
would speak of his children's tutor!...This tutor, once I've
securéd him, will he wear a cassock?'</p>

<p>M. de Rênal was absorbed in this question when he saw in the
distance a peasant, a man of nearly six feet in height, who, by the
first dawning light, seemed to be busily occupied in measuring
pieces of timber lying by the side of the Doubs, upon the towpath.
The peasant did not appear any too well pleased to see the Mayor
coming towards him; for his pieces of wood were blocking the path,
and had been laid there in contravention of the law.</p>

<p>Père Sorel, for it was he, was greatly surprised and even more
pleased by the singular offer which M. de Rênal made him with
regard to his son Julien. He listened to it nevertheless with that
air of grudging-melancholy and lack of interest which the shrewd
inhabitants of those mountains know so well how to assume. Slaves
in the days of Spanish rule, they still retain this facial
characteristic of the Egyptian fellahin.</p>

<p>Sorel's reply was at first nothing more than a long-winded
recital of all the formal terms of respect which he knew by heart.
While he was repeating these vain words, with an awkward smile
which enhanced the air of falsehood and almost of rascality natural
to his countenance, the old peasant's active mind was seeking to
discover what reason could be inducing so important a personage to
take his scapegrace of a son into his establishment. He was
thoroughly dissatisfied with Julien, and it was for Julien that M.
de Rênal was offering him the astounding wage of 300 francs
annually, in addition to his food and even his clothing. This last
condition, which Père Sorel had had the intelligence to advance on
the spur of the moment, had been granted with equal readiness by M.
de Rênal.</p>

<p>This demand impressed the Mayor. 'Since Sorel is not delighted
and overwhelmed by my proposal, as he ought naturally to be, it is
clear,' he said to himself, 'that overtures have been made to him
from another quarter; and from whom can they have come, except from
Valenod?' It was in vain that M. de Rênal urged Sorel to conclude
the bargain there and then: the astute old peasant met him with an
obstinate refusal; he wished, he said, to consult his son, as
though, in the country, a rich father ever consulted a penniless
son, except for form's sake.</p>

<p>A sawmill consists of a shed by the side of a stream. The roof
is held up by rafters supported on four stout wooden pillars. Nine
or ten feet from the ground, in the middle of the shed, one sees a
saw which moves up and down, while an extremely simple mechanism
thrusts forward against this saw a piece of wood. This is a wheel
set in motion by the mill lade which drives both parts of the
machine; that of the saw which moves up and down, and the other
which pushes the piece of wood gently towards the saw, which slices
it into planks.</p>

<p>As he approached his mill, Père Sorel called Julien in his
stentorian voice; there was no answer. He saw only his two elder
sons, young giants who, armed with heavy axes, were squaring the
trunks of fir which they would afterwards carry to the saw. They
were completely engrossed in keeping exactly to the black line
traced on the piece of wood, from which each blow of the axe sent
huge chips flying. They did not hear their father's voice. He made
his way to the shed; as he entered it, he looked in vain for Julien
in the place where he ought to have been standing, beside the saw.
He caught sight of him five or six feet higher up, sitting astride
upon one of the beams of the roof. Instead of paying careful
attention to the action of the machinery, Julien was reading a
book. Nothing could have been less to old Sorel's liking; he might
perhaps have forgiven Julien his slender build, little adapted to
hard work, and so different from that of his elder brothers; but
this passion for reading he detested: he himself was unable to
read.</p>

<p>It was in vain that he called Julien two or three times. The
attention the young man was paying to his book, far more than the
noise of the saw, prevented him from hearing his father's
terrifying voice. Finally, despite his years, the father sprang
nimbly upon the trunk that was being cut by the saw, and from there
on to the cross beam that held up the roof. A violent blow sent
flying into the mill lade the book that Julien was holding; a
second blow no less violent, aimed at his head, in the form of a
box on the ear, made him lose his balance. He was about to fall
from a height of twelve or fifteen feet, among the moving
machinery, which would have crushed him, but his father caught him
with his left hand as he fell.</p>

<p>'Well, idler! So you keep on reading your cursed books, when you
ought to be watching the saw? Read them in the evening, when you go
and waste your time with the curé.'</p>

<p>Julien, although stunned by the force of the blow, and bleeding
profusely, went to take up his proper station beside the saw. There
were tears in his eyes, due not so much to his bodily pain as to
the loss of his book, which he adored.</p>

<p>'Come down, animal, till I speak to you.' The noise of the
machine again prevented Julien from hearing this order. His father
who had stepped down not wishing to take the trouble to climb up
again on to the machine, went to find a long pole used for knocking
down walnuts, and struck him on the shoulder with it. No sooner had
Julien reached the ground than old Sorel, thrusting him on brutally
from behind, drove him towards the house. 'Heaven knows what he's
going to do to me!' thought the young man. As he passed it, he
looked sadly at the mill lade into which his book had fallen; it
was the one that he valued most of all, the <i>Memorial de
Sainte-Helene</i>.</p>

<p>His cheeks were flushed, his eyes downcast. He was a slim youth
of eighteen or nineteen, weak in appearance, with irregular but
delicate features and an aquiline nose. His large dark eyes, which,
in moments of calm, suggested a reflective, fiery spirit, were
animated at this instant with an expression of the most ferocious
hatred. Hair of a dark chestnut, growing very low, gave him a
narrow brow, and in moments of anger a wicked air. Among the
innumerable varieties of the human countenance, there is perhaps
none that is more strikingly characteristic. A slim and shapely
figure betokened suppleness rather than strength. In his childhood,
his extremely pensive air and marked pallor had given his father
the idea that he would not live, or would live only to be a burden
upon his family. An object of contempt to the rest of the
household, he hated his brothers and father; in the games on
Sundays, on the public square, he was invariably beaten.</p>

<p>It was only during the last year that his good looks had begun
to win him a few supporters among the girls. Universally despised,
as a feeble creature, Julien had adored that old Surgeon-Major who
one day ventured to speak to the Mayor on the subject of the plane
trees.</p>

<p>This surgeon used now and then to pay old Sorel a day's wage for
his son, and taught him Latin and history, that is to say all the
history that he knew, that of the 1796 campaign in Italy. On his
death, he had bequeathed to him his Cross of the Legion of Honour,
the arrears of his pension, and thirty or forty volumes, the most
precious of which had just taken a plunge into the public lade,
diverted by the Mayor's influence.</p>

<p>As soon as he was inside the house, Julien felt his shoulder
gripped by his father's strong hand; he trembled, expecting to
receive a shower of blows.</p>

<p>'Answer me without lying,' the old peasant's harsh voice shouted
in his ear, while the hand spun him round as a child's hand spins a
lead soldier. Julien's great dark eyes, filled with tears, found
themselves starting into the little grey eyes of the old peasant,
who looked as though he sought to penetrate to the depths of his
son's heart.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch5" id="ch5"></a>Chapter 5. Driving a Bargain</h2>

<p style="margin-left:10%">Cunctando restituit rem.<br>
&mdash;ENNIUS</p>

<p>'Answer me, without lying, if you can, you miserable bookworm;
how do you come to know Madame de Rênal? When have you spoken to
her?'</p>

<p>'I have never spoken to her,' replied Julien, 'I have never seen
the lady except in church.'</p>

<p>'But you must have looked at her, you shameless scoundrel?'</p>

<p>'Never! You know that in church I see none but God,' Julien
added with a hypocritical air, calculated, to his mind, to ward off
further blows.</p>

<p>'There is something behind this, all the same,' replied the
suspicious peasant, and was silent for a moment; 'but I shall get
nothing out of you, you damned hypocrite. The fact is, I'm going to
be rid of you, and my saw will run all the better without you. You
have made a friend of the parson or someone, and he's got you a
fine post. Go and pack your traps, and I'll take you to M. de
Rênal's where you're to be tutor to the children.'</p>

<p>'What am I to get for that?'</p>

<p>'Board, clothing and three hundred francs in wages.'</p>

<p>'I do not wish to be a servant,'</p>

<p>'Animal, who ever spoke of your being a servant? Would I allow
my son to be a servant?'</p>

<p>'But, with whom shall I have my meals?'</p>

<p>This question left old Sorel at a loss; he felt that if he spoke
he might be guilty of some imprudence; he flew into a rage with
Julien, upon whom he showered abuse, accusing him of greed, and
left him to go and consult his other sons.</p>

<p>Presently Julien saw them, each leaning upon his axe and
deliberating together. After watching them for some time, Julien,
seeing that he could make out nothing of their discussion, went and
took his place on the far side of the saw, so as not to be taken by
surprise. He wanted time to consider this sudden announcement which
was altering his destiny, but felt himself to be incapable of
prudence; his imagination was wholly taken up with forming pictures
of what he would see in M. de Rênal's fine house.</p>

<p>'I must give up all that,' he said to himself, 'rather than let
myself be brought down to feeding with the servants. My father will
try to force me; I would sooner die. I have saved fifteen francs
and eight sous, I shall run away tonight; in two days, by keeping
to side-roads where I need not fear the police, I can be at
Besançon; there I enlist as a soldier, and, if necessary, cross the
border into Switzerland. But then, good-bye to everything, good-bye
to that fine clerical profession which is a stepping-stone to
everything.'</p>

<p>This horror of feeding with the servants was not natural to
Julien; he would, in seeking his fortune, have done other things
far more disagreeable. He derived this repugnance from Rousseau's
<i>Confessions</i>. It was the one book that helped his imagination
to form any idea of the world. The collection of reports of the
Grand Army and the <i>Memorial de Sainte-Helene</i> completed his
Koran. He would have gone to the stake for those three books. Never
did he believe in any other. Remembering a saying of the old
Surgeon-Major, he regarded all the other books in the world as
liars, written by rogues in order to obtain advancement.</p>

<p>With his fiery nature Julien had one of those astonishing
memories so often found in foolish people. To win over the old
priest Chélan, upon whom he saw quite clearly that his own future
depended, he had learned by heart the entire New Testament in
Latin; he knew also M. de Maistre's book <i>Du Pape</i>, and had as
little belief in one as in the other.</p>

<p>As though by a mutual agreement, Sorel and his son avoided
speaking to one another for the rest of the day. At dusk, Julien
went to the curé for his divinity lesson, but did not think it
prudent to say anything to him of the strange proposal that had
been made to his father. 'It may be a trap,' he told himself; 'I
must pretend to have forgotten about it.'</p>

<p>Early on the following day, M. de Rênal sent for old Sorel, who,
after keeping him waiting for an hour or two, finally appeared,
beginning as he entered the door a hundred excuses interspersed
with as many reverences. By dint of giving voice to every sort of
objection, Sorel succeeded in gathering that his son was to take
his meals with the master and mistress of the house, and on days
when they had company in a room by himself with the children.
Finding an increasing desire to raise difficulties the more he
discerned a genuine anxiety on the Mayor's part, and being moreover
filled with distrust and bewilderment, Sorel asked to see the room
in which his son was to sleep. It was a large chamber very decently
furnished, but the servants were already engaged in carrying into
it the beds of the three children.</p>

<p>At this the old peasant began to see daylight; he at once asked
with assurance to see the coat which would be given to his son. M.
de Rênal opened his desk and took out a hundred francs.</p>

<p>'With this money, your son can go to M. Durand, the clothier,
and get himself a suit of black.'</p>

<p>'And supposing I take him away from you,' said the peasant, who
had completely forgotten the reverential forms of address. 'Will he
take this black coat with him?'</p>

<p>'Certainly.'</p>

<p>'Oh, very well!' said Sorel in a drawling tone, 'then there's
only one thing for us still to settle: the money you're to give
him.'</p>

<p>'What!' M. de Rênal indignantly exclaimed, 'we agreed upon that
yesterday: I give three hundred francs; I consider that plenty, if
not too much.'</p>

<p>'That was your offer, I do not deny it,' said old Sorel,
speaking even more slowly; then, by a stroke of genius which will
astonish only those who do not know the Franc-Comtois peasant, he
added, looking M. de Rênal steadily in the face: '<i>We can do
better elsewhere</i>.'</p>

<p>At these words the Mayor was thrown into confusion. He recovered
himself, however, and, after an adroit conversation lasting fully
two hours, in which not a word was said without a purpose, the
peasant's shrewdness prevailed over that of the rich man, who was
not dependent on his for his living. All the innumerable conditions
which were to determine Julien's new existence were finally
settled; not only was his salary fixed at four hundred francs, but
it was to be paid in advance, on the first day of each month.</p>

<p>'Very well! I shall let him have thirty-five francs,' said M. de
Rênal.</p>

<p>'To make a round sum, a rich and generous gentleman like our
Mayor,' the peasant insinuated in a coaxing voice, 'will surely go
as far as thirty-six.'</p>

<p>'All right,' said M. de Rênal, 'but let us have no more of
this.'</p>

<p>For once, anger gave him a tone of resolution. The peasant saw
that he could advance no farther. Thereupon M. de Rênal began in
turn to make headway. He utterly refused to hand over the
thirty-six francs for the first month to old Sorel, who was most
eager to receive the money on his son's behalf. It occurred to M.
de Rênal that he would be obliged to describe to his wife the part
he had played throughout this transaction.</p>

<p>'Let me have back the hundred francs I gave you,' he said
angrily. 'M. Durand owes me money. I shall go with your son to
choose the black cloth.'</p>

<p>After this bold stroke, Sorel prudently retired upon his
expressions of respect; they occupied a good quarter of an hour. In
the end, seeing that there was certainly nothing more to be gained,
he withdrew. His final reverence ended with the words:</p>

<p>'I shall send my son up to the chateau.'</p>

<p>It was thus that the Mayor's subordinates spoke of his house
when they wished to please him.</p>

<p>Returning to his mill, Sorel looked in vain for his son.
Doubtful as to what might be in store for him, Julien had left home
in the dead of night. He had been anxious to find a safe
hiding-place for his books and his Cross of the Legion of Honour.
He had removed the whole of his treasures to the house of a young
timber-merchant, a friend of his, by the name of Fouque, who lived
on the side of the high mountain overlooking Verrières.</p>

<p>When he reappeared: 'Heaven knows, you damned idler,' his father
said to him, 'whether you will ever have enough honour to pay me
for the cost of your keep, which I have been advancing to you all
these years! Pack up your rubbish, and off with you to the
Mayor's.'</p>

<p>Julien, astonished not to receive a thrashing, made haste to set
off. But no sooner was he out of sight of his terrible father than
he slackened his pace. He decided that it would serve the ends of
his hypocrisy to pay a visit to the church.</p>

<p>The idea surprises you? Before arriving at this horrible idea,
the soul of the young peasant had had a long way to go.</p>

<p>When he was still a child, the sight of certain dragoons of the
6th, in their long, white cloaks, and helmets adorned with long
crests of black horsehair, who were returning from Italy, and whom
Julien saw tying their horses to the barred window of his father's
house, drove him mad with longing for a military career.</p>

<p>Later on he listened with ecstasy to the accounts of the battles
of the Bridge of Lodi, Arcole and Rivoli given him by the old
Surgeon-Major. He noticed the burning gaze which the old man
directed at his Cross.</p>

<p>But when Julien was fourteen, they began to build a church at
Verrières, one that might be called magnificent for so small a
town. There were, in particular, four marble pillars the sight of
which impressed Julien; they became famous throughout the
countryside, owing to the deadly enmity which they aroused between
the Justice of the Peace and the young vicar, sent down from
Besançon, who was understood to be the spy of the Congregation. The
Justice of the Peace came within an ace of losing his post, such at
least was the common report. Had he not dared to have a difference
of opinion with a priest who, almost every fortnight, went to
Besançon, where he saw, people said, the Right Reverend Lord
Bishop?</p>

<p>In the midst of all this, the Justice of the Peace, the father
of a large family, passed a number of sentences which appeared
unjust; all of these were directed against such of the inhabitants
as read the <i>Constitutionnel</i>. The right party was triumphant.
The sums involved amounted, it was true, to no more than four or
five francs; but one of these small fines was levied upon a
nailsmith, Julien's godfather. In his anger, this man exclaimed:
'What a change! And to think that, for twenty years and more, the
Justice was reckoned such an honest man!' The Surgeon-Major,
Julien's friend, was dead.</p>

<p>All at once Julien ceased to speak of Napoleon; he announced his
intention of becoming a priest, and was constantly to be seen, in
his father's sawmill, engaged in learning by heart a Latin Bible
which the curé had lent him. The good old man, amazed at his
progress, devoted whole evenings to instructing him in divinity.
Julien gave utterance in his company to none but pious sentiments.
Who could have supposed that that girlish face, so pale and gentle,
hid the unshakeable determination to expose himself to the risk of
a thousand deaths rather than fail to make his fortune?</p>

<p>To Julien, making a fortune meant in the first place leaving
Verrières; he loathed his native place. Everything that he saw
there froze his imagination.</p>

<p>&gt;From his earliest boyhood, he had had moments of exaltation.
At such times he dreamed with rapture that one day he would be
introduced to the beautiful ladies of Paris; he would manage to
attract their attention by some brilliant action. Why should he not
be loved by one of them, as Bonaparte, when still penniless, had
been loved by the brilliant Madame de Beauharnais? For many years
now, perhaps not an hour of Julien's life had passed without his
reminding himself that Bonaparte, an obscuré subaltern with no
fortune, had made himself master of the world with his sword. This
thought consoled him for his misfortunes which he deemed to be
great, and enhanced his joy when joy came his way.</p>

<p>The building of the church and the sentences passed by the
Justice brought him sudden enlightenment; an idea which occurred to
him drove him almost out of his senses for some weeks, and finally
took possession of him with the absolute power of the first idea
which a passionate nature believes itself to have discovered.</p>

<p>'When Bonaparte made a name for himself, France was in fear of
being invaded; military distinction was necessary and fashionable.
Today we see priests at forty drawing stipends of a hundred
thousand francs, that is to say three times as much as the famous
divisional commanders under Napoleon. They must have people to
support them. Look at the Justice here, so wise a man, always so
honest until now, sacrificing his honour, at his age, from fear of
offending a young vicar of thirty. I must become a priest.'</p>

<p>On one occasion, in the midst of his new-found piety, after
Julien had been studying divinity for two years, he was betrayed by
a sudden blaze of the fire that devoured his spirit. This was at M.
Chélan's; at a dinner party of priests, to whom the good curé had
introduced him as an educational prodigy, he found himself uttering
frenzied praise of Napoleon. He bound his right arm across his
chest, pretending that he had put the arm out of joint when
shifting a fir trunk, and kept it for two months in this awkward
position. After this drastic penance, he forgave himself. Such is
the young man of eighteen, but weak in appearance, whom you would
have said to be, at the most, seventeen, who, carrying a small
parcel under his arm, was entering the magnificent church of
Verrières.</p>

<p>He found it dark and deserted. In view of some festival, all the
windows in the building had been covered with crimson cloth; the
effect of this, when the sun shone, was a dazzling blaze of light,
of the most imposing and most religious character. Julien
shuddered. Being alone in the church, he took his seat on the bench
that had the most handsome appearance. It bore the arms of M. de
Rênal.</p>

<p>On the desk in front, Julien observed a scrap of printed paper,
spread out there as though to be read. He looked at it closely and
saw:</p>

<p>'Details of the execution and of the last moments of Louis
Jenrel, executed at Besançon, on the...'</p>

<p>The paper was torn. On the other side he read the opening words
of a line, which were: 'The first step.'</p>

<p>'Who can have put this paper here?' said Julien. 'Poor wretch!'
he added with a sigh, 'his name has the same ending as mine.' And
he crumpled up the paper.</p>

<p>On his way out, Julien thought he saw blood by the holy water
stoup; it was some of the water that had been spilt: the light from
the red curtains which draped the windows made it appear like
blood.</p>

<p>Finally, Julien felt ashamed of his secret terror.</p>

<p>'Should I prove coward?' he said to himself. '<i>To
arms</i>!'</p>

<p>This phrase, so often repeated in the old Surgeon's accounts of
battles, had a heroic sound in Julien's ears. He rose and walked
rapidly to M. de Rênal's house.</p>

<p>Despite these brave resolutions, as soon as he caught sight of
the house twenty yards away he was overcome by an unconquerable
shyness. The iron gate stood open; it seemed to him magnificent. He
would have now to go in through it.</p>

<p>Julien was not the only person whose heart was troubled by his
arrival in this household. Madame de Rênal's extreme timidity was
disconcerted by the idea of this stranger who, in the performance
of his duty, would be constantly coming between her and her
children. She was accustomed to having her sons sleep in her own
room. That morning, many tears had flowed when she saw their little
beds being carried into the apartment intended for the tutor. In
vain did she beg her husband to let the bed of Stanislas Xavier,
the youngest boy, be taken back to her room.</p>

<p>Womanly delicacy was carried to excess in Madame de Rênal. She
formed a mental picture of a coarse, unkempt creature, employed to
scold her children, simply because he knew Latin, a barbarous
tongue for the sake of which her sons would be whipped.</p>

<h2><a name="ch6" id="ch6"></a>Chapter 6. Dullness</h2>

<p style="margin-left:10%">Non so piu cosa son,<br>
Cosa facio.<br>
&mdash;MOZART (Figaro)</p>

<p>With the vivacity and grace which came naturally to her when she
was beyond the reach of male vision, Madame de Rênal was coming out
through the glass door which opened from the drawing-room into the
garden, when she saw, standing by the front door, a young peasant,
almost a boy still, extremely pale and showing traces of recent
tears. He was wearing a clean white shirt and carried under his arm
a neat jacket of violet ratteen.</p>

<p>This young peasant's skin was so white, his eyes were so
appealing, that the somewhat romantic mind of Madame de Rênal
conceived the idea at first that he might be a girl in disguise,
come to ask some favour of the Mayor. She felt sorry for the poor
creature, who had come to a standstill by the front door, and
evidently could not summon up courage to ring the bell. Madame de
Rênal advanced, oblivious for the moment of the bitter grief that
she felt at the tutor's coming. Julien, who was facing the door,
did not see her approach. He trembled when a pleasant voice sounded
close to his ear:</p>

<p>'What have you come for, my boy?'</p>

<p>Julien turned sharply round, and, struck by the charm of Madame
de Rênal's expression, forgot part of his shyness. A moment later,
astounded by her beauty, he forgot everything, even his purpose in
coming. Madame de Rênal had repeated her question.</p>

<p>'I have come to be tutor, Madame,' he at length informed her,
put to shame by his tears which he dried as best he might.</p>

<p>Madame de Rênal remained speechless; they were standing close
together, looking at one another. Julien had never seen a person so
well dressed as this, let alone a woman with so exquisite a
complexion, to speak to him in a gentle tone. Madame de Rênal
looked at the large tears which lingered on the cheeks (so pallid
at first and now so rosy) of this young peasant. Presently she
burst out laughing, with all the wild hilarity of a girl; she was
laughing at herself, and trying in vain to realise the full extent
of her happiness. So this was the tutor whom she had imagined an
unwashed and ill-dressed priest, who was coming to scold and whip
her children.</p>

<p>'Why, Sir!' she said to him at length, 'do you know Latin?'</p>

<p>The word 'Sir' came as such a surprise to Julien that he thought
for a moment before answering.</p>

<p>'Yes, Ma'am,' he said shyly.</p>

<p>Madame de Rênal felt so happy that she ventured to say to
Julien:</p>

<p>'You won't scold those poor children too severely?'</p>

<p>'Scold them? I?' asked Julien in amazement. 'Why should I?'</p>

<p>'You will, Sir,' she went on after a brief silence and in a
voice that grew more emotional every moment, 'you will be kind to
them, you promise me?'</p>

<p>To hear himself addressed again as 'Sir', in all seriousness,
and by a lady so fashionably attired, was more than Julien had ever
dreamed of; in all the cloud castles of his boyhood, he had told
himself that no fashionable lady would deign to speak to him until
he had a smart uniform. Madame de Rênal, for her part, was
completely taken in by the beauty of Julien's complexion, his great
dark eyes and his becoming hair which was curling more than usual
because, to cool himself, he had just dipped his head in the basin
of the public fountain. To her great delight, she discovered an air
of girlish shyness in this fatal tutor, whose severity and savage
appearance she had so greatly dreaded for her children's sake. To
Madame de Rênal's peace-loving nature the contrast between her
fears and what she now saw before her was a great event. Finally
she recovered from her surprise. She was astonished to find herself
standing like this at the door of her house with this young man
almost in his shirtsleeves and so close to her.</p>

<p>'Let us go indoors, Sir,' she said to him with an air of
distinct embarrassment.</p>

<p>Never in her life had a purely agreeable sensation so profoundly
stirred Madame de Rênal; never had so charming an apparition come
in the wake of more disturbing fears. And so those sweet children,
whom she had tended with such care, were not to fall into the hands
of a dirty, growling priest. As soon as they were in the hall, she
turned to Julien who was following her shyly. His air of surprise
at the sight of so fine a house was an additional charm in the eyes
of Madame de Rênal. She could not believe her eyes; what she felt
most of all was that the tutor ought to be wearing a black
coat.</p>

<p>'But is it true, Sir,' she said to him, again coming to a halt,
and mortally afraid lest she might be mistaken, so happy was the
belief making her, 'do you really know Latin?'</p>

<p>These words hurt Julien's pride and destroyed the enchantment in
which he had been living for the last quarter of an hour.</p>

<p>'Yes, Ma'am,' he informed her, trying to adopt a chilly air; 'I
know Latin as well as M. le curé; indeed, he is sometimes so kind
as to say that I know it better.'</p>

<p>Madame de Rênal felt that Julien had a very wicked air; he had
stopped within arm's length of her. She went nearer to him, and
murmured:</p>

<p>'For the first few days, you won't take the whip to my children,
even if they don't know their lessons?'</p>

<p>This gentle, almost beseeching tone coming from so fine a lady
at once made Julien forget what he owed to his reputation as a
Latin scholar. Madame de Rênal's face was close to his own, he
could smell the perfume of a woman's summer attire, so astounding a
thing to a poor peasant. Julien blushed deeply, and said with a
sigh and in a faint voice:</p>

<p>'Fear nothing, Ma'am, I shall obey you in every respect.'</p>

<p>It was at this moment only, when her anxiety for her children
was completely banished, that Madame de Rênal was struck by
Julien's extreme good looks. The almost feminine cast of his
features and his air of embarrassment did not seem in the least
absurd to a woman who was extremely timid herself. The manly air
which is generally considered essential to masculine beauty would
have frightened her.</p>

<p>'How old are you, Sir?' she asked Julien.</p>

<p>'I shall soon be nineteen.'</p>

<p>'My eldest son is eleven,' went on Madame de Rênal, completely
reassured; 'he will be almost a companion for you, you can talk to
him seriously. His father tried to beat him once, the child was ill
for a whole week, and yet it was quite a gentle blow.'</p>

<p>'How different from me,' thought Julien. 'Only yesterday my
father was thrashing me. How fortunate these rich people are!'</p>

<p>Madame de Rênal had by this time arrived at the stage of
remarking the most trivial changes in the state of the tutor's
mind; she mistook this envious impulse for shyness, and tried to
give him fresh courage.</p>

<p>'What is your name, Sir?' she asked him with an accent and a
grace the charm of which Julien could feel without knowing whence
it sprang.</p>

<p>'They call me Julien Sorel, Ma'am; I am trembling as I enter a
strange house for the first time in my life; I have need of your
protection, and shall require you to forgive me many things at
first. I have never been to College, I was too poor; I have never
talked to any other men, except my cousin the Surgeon-Major, a
Member of the Legion of Honour, and the Reverend Father Chélan. He
will give you a good account of me. My brothers have always beaten
me, do not listen to them if they speak evil of me to you; pardon
my faults, Ma'am, I shall never have any evil intention.'</p>

<p>Julien plucked up his courage again during this long speech; he
was studying Madame de Rênal. Such is the effect of perfect grace
when it is natural to the character, particularly when she whom it
adorns has no thought of being graceful. Julien, who knew all that
was to be known about feminine beauty, would have sworn at that
moment that she was no more than twenty. The bold idea at once
occurred to him of kissing her hand. Next, this idea frightened
him; a moment later, he said to himself: 'It would be cowardly on
my part not to carry out an action which may be of use to me, and
diminish the scorn which this fine lady probably feels for a poor
workman, only just taken from the sawbench.' Perhaps Julien was
somewhat encouraged by the words 'good-looking boy' which for the
last six months he had been used to hearing on Sundays on the lips
of various girls. While he debated thus with himself, Madame de
Rênal offered him a few suggestions as to how he should begin to
handle her children. The violence of Julien's effort to control
himself made him turn quite pale again; he said, with an air of
constraint:</p>

<p>'Never, Ma'am, will I beat your children; I swear it before
God.'</p>

<p>And so saying he ventured to take Madame de Rênal's hand and
carry it to his lips. She was astonished at this action, and, on
thinking it over, shocked. As the weather was very warm, her arm
was completely bare under her shawl, and Julien's action in raising
her hand to his lips had uncovered it to the shoulder. A minute
later she scolded herself; she felt that she had not been quickly
enough offended.</p>

<p>M. de Rênal, who had heard the sound of voices, came out of his
study; with the same majestic and fatherly air that he assumed when
he was conducting marriages in the Town Hall, he said to
Julien:</p>

<p>'It is essential that I speak to you before the children see
you.'</p>

<p>He ushered Julien into one of the rooms and detained his wife,
who was going to leave them together. Having shut the door, M. de
Rênal seated himself with gravity.</p>

<p>'The curé has told me that you were an honest fellow, everyone
in this house will treat you with respect, and if I am satisfied I
shall help you to set up for yourself later on. I wish you to cease
to see anything of either your family or your friends, their tone
would not be suited to my children. Here are thirty-six francs for
the first month; but I must have your word that you will not give a
penny of this money to your father.'</p>

<p>M. de Rênal was annoyed with the old man, who, in this business,
had proved more subtle than he himself.</p>

<p>'And now, <i>Sir</i>, for by my orders everyone in this house is
to address you as Sir, and you will be conscious of the advantage
of entering a well-ordered household; now, Sir, it is not proper
that the children should see you in a jacket. Have the servants
seen him?' M. de Rênal asked his wife.</p>

<p>'No, dear,' she replied with an air of deep thought.</p>

<p>'Good. Put on this,' he said to the astonished young man,
handing him one of his own frock coats. 'And now let us go to M.
Durand, the clothier.'</p>

<p>More than an hour later, when M. de Rênal returned with the new
tutor dressed all in black, he found his wife still seated in the
same place. She felt soothed by Julien's presence; as she studied
his appearance she forgot to feel afraid. Julien was not giving her
a thought; for all his mistrust of destiny and of mankind, his
heart at that moment was just like a child's; he seemed to have
lived whole years since the moment when, three hours earlier, he
stood trembling in the church. He noticed Madame de Rênal's frigid
manner, and gathered that she was angry because he had ventured to
kiss her hand. But the sense of pride that he derived from the
contact of garments so different from those which he was accustomed
to wear caused him so much excitement, and he was so anxious to
conceal his joy that all his gestures were more or less abrupt and
foolish. Madame de Rênal gazed at him with eyes of
astonishment.</p>

<p>'A little gravity, Sir,' M. de Rênal told him, 'if you wish to
be respected by my children and my servants.'</p>

<p>'Sir,' replied Julien, 'I am uncomfortable in these new clothes;
I, a humble peasant, have never worn any but short jackets; with
your permission, I shall retire to my bedroom.'</p>

<p>'What think you of this new acquisition?' M. de Rênal asked his
wife.</p>

<p>With an almost instinctive impulse, of which she herself
certainly was not aware, Madame de Rênal concealed the truth from
her husband.</p>

<p>'I am by no means as enchanted as you are with this little
peasant; your kindness will turn him into an impertinent rascal
whom you will be obliged to send packing within a month.'</p>

<p>'Very well! We shall send him packing; he will have cost me a
hundred francs or so, and Verrières will have grown used to seeing
a tutor with M. de Rênal's children. That point I should not have
gained if I had let Julien remain in the clothes of a working man.
When I dismiss him, I shall of course keep the black suit which I
have just ordered from the clothier. He shall have nothing but the
coat I found ready made at the tailor's, which he is now
wearing.'</p>

<p>The hour which Julien spent in his room seemed like a second to
Madame de Rênal. The children, who had been told of their new
tutor's arrival, overwhelmed their mother with questions. Finally
Julien appeared. He was another man. It would have been straining
the word to say that he was grave; he was gravity incarnate. He was
introduced to the children, and spoke to them with an air that
surprised M. de Rênal himself.</p>

<p>'I am here, young gentlemen,' he told them at the end of his
address, 'to teach you Latin. You know what is meant by repeating a
lesson. Here is the Holy Bible,' he said, and showed them a tiny
volume in 32mo, bound in black. 'It is in particular the story of
Our Lord Jesus Christ, that is the part which is called the New
Testament. I shall often make you repeat lessons; now you must make
me repeat mine.'</p>

<p>Adolphe, the eldest boy, had taken the book.</p>

<p>'Open it where you please,' Julien went on, 'and tell me the
first word of a paragraph. I shall repeat by heart the sacred text,
the rule of conduct for us all, until you stop me.'</p>

<p>Adolphe opened the book, read a word, and Julien repeated the
whole page as easily as though he were speaking French. M. de Rênal
looked at his wife with an air of triumph. The children, seeing
their parents' amazement, opened their eyes wide. A servant came to
the door of the drawing-room, Julien went on speaking in Latin. The
servant at first stood motionless and then vanished. Presently the
lady's maid and the cook appeared in the doorway; by this time
Adolphe had opened the book at eight different places, and Julien
continued to repeat the words with the same ease.</p>

<p>'Eh, what a bonny little priest,' the cook, a good and truly
devout girl, said aloud.</p>

<p>M. de Rênal's self-esteem was troubled; so far from having any
thought of examining the tutor, he was engaged in ransacking his
memory for a few words of Latin; at last, he managed to quote a
line of Horace. Julien knew no Latin apart from the Bible. He
replied with a frown:</p>

<p>'The sacred ministry to which I intend to devote myself has
forbidden me to read so profane a poet.'</p>

<p>M. de Rênal repeated a fair number of alleged lines of Horace.
He explained to his children what Horace was; but the children,
overcome with admiration, paid little attention to what he was
saying. They were watching Julien.</p>

<p>The servants being still at the door, Julien felt it incumbent
upon him to prolong the test.</p>

<p>'And now,' he said to the youngest boy, 'Master Stanislas Xavier
too must set me a passage from the Holy Book.'</p>

<p>Little Stanislas, swelling with pride, read out to the best of
his ability the opening words of a paragraph, and Julien repeated
the whole page. That nothing might be wanting to complete M. de
Rênal's triumph, while Julien was reciting, there entered M.
Valenod, the possessor of fine Norman horses, and M. Charcot de
Maugiron, Sub-Prefect of the district. This scene earned for Julien
the title 'Sir'; the servants themselves dared not withhold it from
him.</p>

<p>That evening, the whole of Verrières flocked to M. de Rênal's to
behold the marvel. Julien answered them all with an air of gloom
which kept them at a distance. His fame spread so rapidly through
the town that, shortly afterwards, M. de Rênal, afraid of losing
him, suggested his signing a contract for two years.</p>

<p>'No, Sir,' Julien replied coldly, 'if you chose to dismiss me I
should be obliged to go. A contract which binds me without putting
you under any obligation is unfair, I must decline.'</p>

<p>Julien managed so skilfully that, less than a month after his
coming to the house, M. de Rênal himself respected him. The curé
having quarrelled with MM. de Rênal and Valenod, there was no one
who could betray Julien's former passion for Napoleon, of whom he
was careful to speak with horror.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch7" id="ch7"></a>Chapter 7. Elective Affinities</h2>

<p style="margin-left:10%">They can only touch the heart by
bruising it.<br>
&mdash;A MODERN</p>

<p>The children adored him, he did not care for them; his thoughts
were elsewhere. Nothing that these urchins could do ever tried his
patience. Cold, just, impassive, and at the same time loved,
because his coming had in a measure banished dullness from the
house, he was a good tutor. For his part, he felt only hatred and
horror for the high society in which he was allowed to occupy the
very foot of the table, a position which may perhaps explain his
hatred and horror. There were certain formal dinners at which he
could barely contain his loathing of everything round about him. On
Saint Louis's day in particular, M. Valenod was laying down the law
at M. de Rênal's; Julien almost gave himself away; he escaped into
the garden, saying that he must look after the children. 'What
panegyrics of honesty!' he exclaimed; 'anyone would say that was
the one and only virtue; and yet what consideration, what a
cringing respect for a man who obviously has doubled and tripled
his fortune since he has been in charge of the relief of the poor!
I would wager that he makes something even out of the fund set
apart for the foundlings, those wretches whose need is even more
sacred than that of the other paupers. Ah, monsters! Monsters! And
I too, I am a sort of foundling, hated by my father, my brothers,
my whole family.'</p>

<p>Some days earlier, Julien walking by himself and saying his
office in a little wood, known as the Belvedere, which overlooks
the Cours de la Fidélité, had tried in vain to avoid his two
brothers, whom he saw approaching him by a solitary path. The
jealousy of these rough labourers had been so quickened by the
sight of their brother's handsome black coat, and air of extreme
gentility, as well as by the sincere contempt which he felt for
them, that they had proceeded to thrash him, leaving him there
unconscious and bleeding freely. Madame de Rênal, who was out
walking with M. Valenod and the Sub-Prefect, happened to turn into
the little wood; she saw Julien lying on the ground and thought him
dead. She was so overcome as to make M. Valenod jealous.</p>

<p>His alarm was premature. Julien admired Madame de Rênal's looks,
but hated her for her beauty; it was the first reef on which his
fortune had nearly foundered. He spoke to her as seldom as
possible, in the hope of making her forget the impulse which, at
their first encounter, had led him to kiss her hand.</p>

<p>Elisa, Madame de Rênal's maid, had not failed to fall in love
with the young tutor; she often spoke of him to her mistress. Miss
Elisa's love had brought upon Julien the hatred of one of the
footmen. One day he heard this man say to Elisa: 'You won't speak
to me any more, since that greasy tutor has been in the house.'
Julien did not deserve the epithet; but, with the instinct of a
good-looking youth, became doubly attentive to his person. M.
Valenod's hatred was multiplied accordingly. He said in public that
so much concern with one's appearance was not becoming in a young
cleric. Barring the cassock, Julien now wore clerical attire.</p>

<p>Madame de Rênal observed that he was speaking more often than
before to Miss Elisa; she learned that these conversations were due
to the limitations of Julien's extremely small wardrobe. He had so
scanty a supply of linen that he was obliged to send it out
constantly to be washed, and it was in performing these little
services that Elisa made herself useful to him.</p>

<p>This extreme poverty, of which she had had no suspicion, touched
Madame de Rênal; she longed to make him presents, but did not dare;
this inward resistance was the first feeling of regret that Julien
caused her. Until then the name of Julien and the sense of a pure
and wholly intellectual joy had been synonymous to her. Tormented
by the idea of Julien's poverty, Madame de Rênal spoke to her
husband about making him a present of linen:</p>

<p>'What idiocy!' he replied. 'What! Make presents to a man with
whom we are perfectly satisfied, and who is serving us well? It is
when he neglects his duty that we should stimulate his zeal.'</p>

<p>Madame de Rênal felt ashamed of this way of looking at things;
before Julien came she would not have noticed it. She never saw the
young cleric's spotless, though very simple, toilet without asking
herself: 'Poor boy, how ever does he manage?'</p>

<p>As time went on she began to feel sorry for Julien's
deficiencies, instead of being shocked by them.</p>

<p>Madame de Rênal was one of those women to be found in the
provinces whom one may easily take to be fools until one has known
them for a fortnight. She had no experience of life, and made no
effort at conversation. Endowed with a delicate and haughty nature,
that instinct for happiness natural to all human beings made her,
generally speaking, pay no attention to the actions of the coarse
creatures into whose midst chance had flung her.</p>

<p>She would have been remarkable for her naturalness and quickness
of mind, had she received the most scanty education; but in her
capacity as an heiress she had been brought up by nuns who
practised a passionate devotion to the Sacred Heart of Jesus, and
were animated by a violent hatred of the French as being enemies of
the Jesuits. Madame de Rênal had sufficient sense to forget at
once, as absurdities, everything she had learned in the convent;
but she put nothing else in its place, and ended by knowing
nothing. The flatteries of which she had been the precocious
object, as the heiress to a large fortune, and a marked tendency
towards passionate devotion, had bred in her an attitude towards
life that was wholly inward. With an outward show of the most
perfect submission, and a self-suppression which the husbands of
Verrières used to quote as an example to their wives, and which was
a source of pride to M. de Rênal, her inner life was, as a matter
of fact, dictated by the most lofty disdain. Any princess who is
quoted as an illustration of pride pays infinitely more attention
to what her gentlemen are doing round about her than this meekest
of women, so modest in appearance, gave to anything that her
husband said or did. Until Julien arrived, she had really paid no
attention to anyone but her children. Their little illnesses, their
sorrows, their little pleasures absorbed the whole sensibility of
this human soul, which had never, in the whole of her life, adored
anyone save God, while she was at the Sacred Heart in Besançon.</p>

<p>Although she did not condescend to say so to anyone, a feverish
attack coming to one of her sons threw her almost into the same
state as if the child had died. A burst of coarse laughter, a shrug
of the shoulders, accompanied by some trivial maxim as to the
foolishness of women, had regularly greeted the confessions of
grief of this sort which the need of an outlet had led her to make
to her husband during the first years of their married life.
Witticisms of this sort, especially when they bore upon the
illnesses of the children, turned the dagger in Madame de Rênal's
heart. This was all the substitute she found for the obsequious,
honeyed flatteries of the Jesuitical convent in which she had
passed her girlhood. She was educated in the school of suffering.
Too proud to speak of griefs of this sort, even to her friend
Madame Derville, she imagined that all men resembled her husband,
M. Valenod, and the Sub-Prefect Charcot de Maugiron. Coarse wit and
the most brutal insensibility to everything that did not promise
money, promotion or a Cross; a blind hatred of every argument that
went against them seemed to her to be things natural to the male
sex, like the wearing of boots and felt hats.</p>

<p>After many long years, Madame de Rênal had not yet grown
accustomed to these money-grubbing creatures among whom she had to
live.</p>

<p>Hence the success of the little peasant Julien. She found much
pleasant enjoyment, radiant with the charm of novelty, in the
sympathy of this proud and noble spirit. Madame de Rênal had soon
forgiven him his extreme ignorance, which was an additional charm,
and the roughness of his manners, which she succeeded in improving.
She found that it was worth her while to listen to him, even when
they spoke of the most ordinary things, even when it was a question
of a poor dog that had been run over, as it was crossing the
street, by a peasant's cart going by at a trot. The sight of such a
tragedy made her husband utter his coarse laugh, whereas she saw
Julien's fine, beautifully arched black eyebrows wince. Generosity,
nobility of soul, humanity, seemed to her, after a time, to exist
only in this young cleric. She felt for him alone all the sympathy
and even admiration which those virtues arouse in well-bred
natures.</p>

<p>In Paris, Julien's position with regard to Madame de Rênal would
very soon have been simplified; but in Paris love is the child of
the novels. The young tutor and his timid mistress would have found
in three or four novels, and even in the lyrics of the Gymnase, a
clear statement of their situation. The novels would have outlined
for them the part to be played, shown them the model to copy; and
this model, sooner or later, albeit without the slightest pleasure,
and perhaps with reluctance, vanity would have compelled Julien to
follow.</p>

<p>In a small town of the Aveyron or the Pyrenees, the slightest
incident would have been made decisive by the ardour of the
climate. Beneath our more sombre skies, a penniless young man, who
is ambitious only because the refinement of his nature puts him in
need of some of those pleasures which money provides, is in daily
contact with a woman of thirty who is sincerely virtuous, occupied
with her children, and never looks to novels for examples of
conduct. Everything goes slowly, everything happens by degrees in
the provinces: life is more natural.</p>

<p>Often, when she thought of the young tutor's poverty, Madame de
Rênal was moved to tears. Julien came upon her, one day, actually
crying.</p>

<p>'Ah, Ma'am, you have had some bad news!'</p>

<p>'No, my friend,' was her answer: 'Call the children, let us go
for a walk.'</p>

<p>She took his arm and leaned on it in a manner which Julien
thought strange. It was the first time that she had called him 'my
friend'.</p>

<p>Towards the end of their walk, Julien observed that she was
blushing deeply. She slackened her pace.</p>

<p>'You will have heard,' she said without looking at him, 'that I
am the sole heiress of a very rich aunt who lives at Besançon. She
loads me with presents. My sons are making...such astonishing
progress...that I should like to ask you to accept a little
present, as a token of my gratitude. It is only a matter of a few
louis to supply you with linen. But&mdash;' she added, blushing even
more deeply, and was silent.</p>

<p>'What, Ma'am?' said Julien.</p>

<p>'It would be unnecessary,' she went on, lowering her head, 'to
speak of this to my husband.'</p>

<p>'I may be humble, Ma'am, but I am not base,' replied Julien
coming to a standstill, his eyes ablaze with anger, and drawing
himself up to his full height. 'That is a point which you have not
sufficiently considered. I should be less than a footman if I put
myself in the position of hiding from M. de Rênal anything that had
to do with my money.'</p>

<p>Madame de Rênal was overwhelmed.</p>

<p>'The Mayor,' Julien went on, 'has given me thirty-six francs
five times since I came to live in his house; I am prepared to show
my account-book to M. de Rênal or to anyone else, including M.
Valenod who hates me.'</p>

<p>This outburst left Madame de Rênal pale and trembling, and the
walk came to an end before either of them could find an excuse for
renewing the conversation. Love for Madame de Rênal became more and
more impossible in the proud heart of Julien: as for her, she
respected, she admired him; she had been scolded by him. On the
pretext of making amends for the humiliation which she had
unintentionally caused him, she allowed herself to pay him the most
delicate attentions. The novelty of this procedure kept her happy
for a week. Its effect was to some extent to appease Julien's
anger; he was far from seeing anything in it that could be mistaken
for personal affection.</p>

<p>'That,' he said to himself, 'is what rich people are like: they
humiliate one, and then think they can put things right by a few
monkey-tricks.'</p>

<p>Madame de Rênal's heart was too full, and as yet too innocent
for her, notwithstanding the resolutions she had made, not to tell
her husband of the offer she had made to Julien and the manner in
which she had been repulsed.</p>

<p>'What,' M. de Rênal retorted, with keen annoyance, 'could you
tolerate a refusal from a servant?'</p>

<p>And as Madame de Rênal protested at this word:</p>

<p>'I speak, Ma'am, as the late Prince de Conde spoke, when
presenting his Chamberlains to his bride: "All these people," he
told her, "are our servants." I read you the passage from
Besenval's <i>Memoirs</i>, it is essential in questions of
precedence. Everyone who is not a gentleman, who lives in your
house and receives a salary, is your servant. I shall say a few
words to this Master Julien, and give him a hundred francs.'</p>

<p>'Ah, my dear,' said Madame de Rênal trembling, 'please do not
say anything in front of the servants.'</p>

<p>'Yes, they might be jealous, and rightly,' said her husband as
he left the room, thinking of the magnitude of the sum.</p>

<p>Madame de Rênal sank down on a chair, almost fainting with
grief. 'He is going to humiliate Julien, and it is my fault!' She
felt a horror of her husband, and hid her face in her hands. She
promised herself that she would never confide anything in him
again.</p>

<p>When she next saw Julien, she was trembling all over, her bosom
was so contracted that she could not manage to utter a single word.
In her embarrassment she took his hands and wrung them.</p>

<p>'Well, my friend,' she said to him after a little, 'are you
pleased with my husband?'</p>

<p>'How should I not be?' Julien answered with a bitter smile; 'he
has given me a hundred francs.'</p>

<p>Madame de Rênal looked at him as though uncertain what to
do.</p>

<p>'Give me your arm,' she said at length with an accent of courage
which Julien had never yet observed in her.</p>

<p>She ventured to enter the shop of the Verrières bookseller, in
spite of his terrible reputation as a Liberal. There she chose
books to the value of ten louis which she gave to her sons. But
these books were the ones which she knew that Julien wanted. She
insisted that there, in the bookseller's shop, each of the children
should write his own name in the books that fell to his share.
While Madame de Rênal was rejoicing at the partial reparation which
she had had the courage to make to Julien, he was lost in amazement
at the quantity of books which he saw on the bookseller's shelves.
Never had he dared to set foot in so profane a place; his heart
beat violently. So far from his having any thought of trying to
guess what was occurring in the heart of Madame de Rênal, he was
plunged in meditation as to how it would be possible for a young
student of divinity to procuré some of these books. At length the
idea came to him that it might be possible, by a skilful approach,
to persuade M. de Rênal that he ought to set his sons, as the
subject for an essay, the lives of the celebrated gentlemen who
were natives of the province. After a month of careful
preliminaries, he saw his idea prove successful, so much so that,
shortly afterwards, he ventured, in speaking to M. de Rênal, to
mention an action considerably more offensive to the noble Mayor;
it was a matter of contributing to the prosperity of a Liberal, by
taking out a subscription at the library. M. de Rênal entirely
agreed that it was wise to let his eldest son have a <i>visual
impression</i> of various works which he would hear mentioned in
conversation when he went to the Military School; but Julien found
the Mayor obdurate in refusing to go any farther. He suspected a
secret reason, which he was unable to guess.</p>

<p>'I was thinking, Sir,' he said to him one day, 'that it would be
highly improper for the name of a respectable gentleman like a
Rênal to appear on the dirty ledger of the librarian.'</p>

<p>M. de Rênal's face brightened.</p>

<p>'It would also be a very bad mark,' Julien went on, in a humbler
tone, 'against a poor divinity student, if it should one day be
discovered that his name had been on the ledger of a bookseller who
keeps a library. The Liberals might accuse me of having asked for
the most scandalous books; for all one knows they might even go so
far as to write in after my name the titles of those perverse
works.'</p>

<p>But Julien was going off the track. He saw the Mayor's features
resume their expression of embarrassment and ill humour. Julien was
silent. 'I have my man hooked,' he said to himself.</p>

<p>A few days later, on the eldest boy's questioning Julien as to a
book advertised in the <i>Quotidienne</i>, in M. de Rênal's
presence:</p>

<p>'To remove all occasion for triumph from the Jacobin Party,'
said the young tutor, 'and at the same time to enable me to answer
Master Adolphe, one might open a subscription at the bookshop in
the name of the lowest of your servants.'</p>

<p>'That is not at all a bad idea,' said M. de Rênal, obviously
delighted.</p>

<p>'Only it would have to be specified,' said Julien with that
grave and almost sorrowful air which becomes certain people so
well, when they see the success of the projects which have been
longest in their minds, 'it would have to be specified that the
servant shall not take out any novels. Once they were in the house,
those dangerous works might corrupt Madame's maids, not to speak of
the servant himself.'</p>

<p>'You forget the political pamphlets,' added M. de Rênal, in a
haughty tone. He wished to conceal the admiration that he felt for
the clever middle course discovered by his children's tutor.</p>

<p>Julien's life was thus composed of a series of petty
negotiations; and their success was of far more importance to him
than the evidence of a marked preference for himself which was only
waiting for him to read it in the heart of Madame de Rênal.</p>

<p>The moral environment in which he had been placed all his life
was repeated in the household of the worshipful Mayor of Verrières.
There, as in his father's sawmill, he profoundly despised the
people with whom he lived, and was hated by them. He saw every day,
from the remarks made by the Sub-Prefect, by M. Valenod and by the
other friends of the family, with reference to the things that had
just happened under their eyes, how remote their ideas were from
any semblance of reality. Did an action strike him as admirable, it
was precisely what called forth blame from the people round about
him. His unspoken retort was always: 'What monsters!' or 'What
fools!' The amusing thing was that, with all his pride, frequently
he understood nothing at all of what was being discussed.</p>

<p>In his whole life, he had never spoken with sincerity except to
the old Surgeon-Major; the few ideas that he had bore reference to
Napoleon's campaigns in Italy, or to surgery. His youthful courage
took delight in detailed accounts of the most painful operations;
he said to himself: 'I should not have flinched.'</p>

<p>The first time that Madame de Rênal attempted a conversation
with him on a subject other than that of the children's education,
he began to talk of surgical operations; she turned pale, and
begged him to stop.</p>

<p>Julien knew nothing apart from these matters. And so, as he
spent his time with Madame de Rênal, the strangest silence grew up
between them as soon as they were alone together. In her own
drawing-room, humble as his bearing was, she found in his eyes an
air of intellectual superiority over everyone that came to the
house. Were she left alone for a moment with him, she saw him grow
visibly embarrassed. This troubled her, for her womanly instinct
made her realise that his embarrassment was not in the least degree
amorous.</p>

<p>In consequence of some idea derived from a description of good
society, as the old Surgeon-Major had beheld it, as soon as
conversation ceased in a place where he found himself in the
company of a woman, Julien felt abashed, as though he himself were
specially to blame for this silence. This sensation was a hundred
times more painful when they were alone. His imagination, full of
the most extravagant, the most Spanish notions as to what a man
ought to say, when he is alone with a woman, offered him in his
agitation none but inadmissible ideas. His soul was in the clouds,
and yet he was incapable of breaking the most humiliating silence.
Thus his air of severity, during his long walks with Madame de
Rênal and the children, was intensified by the most cruel
sufferings. He despised himself hideously. If by mischance he
forced himself to speak, he found himself saying the most
ridiculous things. To increase his misery, he saw and exaggerated
his own absurdity; but what he did not see was the expression in
his eyes, they were so fine and revealed so burning a soul that,
like good actors, they imparted at times a charming meaning to what
was meaningless. Madame de Rênal remarked that, when alone with
her, he never expressed himself well except when he was distracted
by some unforeseen occurrence, he never thought of turning a
compliment. As the friends of the family did not spoil her by
offering her new and brilliant ideas, she took a delight in the
flashes of Julien's intellect.</p>

<p>Since the fall of Napoleon, all semblance of gallantry in speech
has been sternly banished from the code of provincial behaviour.
People are afraid of losing their posts. The unscrupulous seek
support from the <i>Congregation</i> and hypocrisy has made the
most brilliant advances even among the Liberal classes. Dulness
increases. No pleasure is left, save in reading and
agriculture.</p>

<p>Madame de Rênal, the wealthy heiress of a religious aunt,
married at sixteen to a worthy gentleman, had never in her life
felt or seen anything that bore the faintest resemblance to love.
Her confessor, the good curé Chélan, was the only person almost who
had ever spoken to her of love, with reference to the advances of
M. Valenod, and he had drawn so revolting a picture of it that the
word conveyed nothing to her but the idea of the most abject
immorality. She regarded as an exception, or rather as something
quite apart from nature, love such as she had found it in the very
small number of novels that chance had brought to her notice.
Thanks to this ignorance, Madame de Rênal, entirely happy, occupied
incessantly with the thought of Julien, was far from reproaching
herself in the slightest degree.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch8" id="ch8"></a>Chapter 8. Minor Events</h2>

<p style="margin-left:10%">Then there were sighs, the deeper for
suppression,<br>
And stolen glances, sweeter for the theft,<br>
And burning blushes, though for no transgression.<br>
&mdash;<i>Don Juan</i>, I. 74</p>

<p>The angelic sweetness which Madame de Rênal derived from her own
character as well as from her present happiness was interrupted
only when she happened to think of her maid Elisa. This young woman
received a legacy, went to make her confession to the curé Chélan,
and revealed to him her intention to marry Julien. The curé was
genuinely delighted at his friend's good fortune; but his surprise
was great when Julien informed him with a resolute air that Miss
Elisa's offer could not be accepted.</p>

<p>'Pay good heed, my son, to what is taking place in your heart,'
said the curé, frowning; 'I congratulate you on your vocation, if
it is to it alone that must be ascribed your scorn of a more than
adequate provision. For fifty-six years and more have I been curé
at Verrières, and yet, so far as one can see, I am going to be
deprived. This distresses me, albeit I have an income of eight
hundred livres. I tell you of this detail in order that you may not
be under any illusion as to what is in store for you in the
priestly calling. If you think of paying court to the men in power,
your eternal ruin is assured. You may make your fortune, but you
will have to injure the poor and needy, flatter the Sub-Prefect,
the Mayor, the important person, and minister to his passions: such
conduct, which in the world is called the art of life, may, in a
layman, be not wholly incompatible with salvation; but in our
calling, we have to choose; we must make our fortune either in this
world or in the next, there is no middle way. Go, my dear friend,
reflect, and come back in three days' time with a definite answer.
I am sorry to see underlying your character, a smouldering ardour
which does not suggest to my mind the moderation and complete
renunciation of earthly advantages necessary in a priest; I augur
well from your intelligence; but, allow me to tell you,' the good
curé went on, with tears in his eyes, 'in the calling of a priest,
I shall tremble for your salvation.'</p>

<p>Julien was ashamed of his emotion; for the first time in his
life, he saw himself loved; he wept for joy, and went to hide his
tears in the great woods above Verrières.</p>

<p>'Why am I in this state?' he asked himself at length; 'I feel
that I would give my life a hundred times over for that good Father
Chélan, and yet he has just proved to me that I am no better than a
fool. It is he above all that I have to deceive, and he sees
through me. That secret ardour of which he speaks is my plan for
making my fortune. He thinks me unfit to be a priest, at the very
moment when I imagined that the sacrifice of an income of fifty
louis was going to give him the most exalted idea of my piety and
my vocation.</p>

<p>'For the future,' Julien continued, 'I shall rely only upon
those elements of my character which I have tested. Who would ever
have said that I should find pleasure in shedding tears? That I
should love the man who proves to me that I am nothing more than a
fool?'</p>

<p>Three days later, Julien had found the pretext with which he
should have armed himself from the first; this pretext was a
calumny, but what of that? He admitted to the curé, after much
hesitation, that a reason which he could not explain to him,
because to reveal it would injure a third party, had dissuaded him
from the first from the projected marriage. This was tantamount to
an indictment of Elisa's conduct. M. Chélan detected in his manner
a fire that was wholly mundane, and very different from that which
should have inspired a young Levite.</p>

<p>'My friend,' he appealed to him again, 'be an honest yeoman,
educated and respected, rather than a priest without a
vocation.'</p>

<p>Julien replied to these fresh remonstrances extremely well, so
far as words went; he hit upon the expressions which a fervent
young seminarist would have employed; but the tone in which he
uttered them, the ill-concealed fire that smouldered in his eyes
alarmed M. Chélan.</p>

<p>We need not augur ill for Julien's future; he hit upon the
correct form of words of a cunning and prudent hypocrisy. That is
not bad at his age. As for his tone and gestures, he lived among
country folk; he had been debarred from seeing the great models. In
the sequel, no sooner had he been permitted to mix with these
gentlemen than he became admirable as well in gesture as in
speech.</p>

<p>Madame de Rênal was surprised that her maid's newly acquired
fortune had not made the girl more happy; she saw her going
incessantly to the curé's, and returning with tears in her eyes;
finally Elisa spoke to her mistress of her marriage.</p>

<p>Madame de Rênal believed herself to have fallen ill; a sort of
fever prevented her enjoying any sleep; she was alive only when she
had her maid or Julien before her eyes. She could think of nothing
but them and the happiness they would find in their married life.
The poverty of the small house in which people would be obliged to
live, with an income of fifty louis, portrayed itself to her in
enchanting colours. Julien might very well become a lawyer at Bray,
the Sub-Prefecture two leagues from Verrières; in that event she
would see something of him.</p>

<p>Madame de Rênal sincerely believed that she was going mad; she
said so to her husband, and finally did fall ill. That evening, as
her maid was waiting upon her, she noticed that the girl was
crying. She loathed Elisa at that moment, and had spoken sharply to
her; she begged the girl's pardon. Elisa's tears increased; she
said that if her mistress would allow it, she would tell her the
whole tale of her distress.</p>

<p>'Speak,' replied Madame de Rênal.</p>

<p>'Well, the fact is, Ma'am, he won't have me; wicked people must
have spoken evil of me to him, and he believes them.'</p>

<p>'Who won't have you?' said Madame de Rênal, scarcely able to
breathe.</p>

<p>'And who could it be, Ma'am, but M. Julien?' the maid replied
through her sobs. 'His Reverence has failed to overcome his
resistance; for His Reverence considers that he ought not to refuse
a decent girl, just because she has been a lady's maid. After all,
M. Julien's own father is no better than a carpenter; and he
himself, how was he earning his living before he came to
Madame's?'</p>

<p>Madame de Rênal had ceased to listen; surfeit of happiness had
almost deprived her of the use of her reason. She made the girl
repeat to her several times the assurance that Julien had refused
in a positive manner, which would not permit of his coming to a
more reasonable decision later on.</p>

<p>'I wish to make a final effort,' she said to her maid. 'I shall
speak to M. Julien.'</p>

<p>Next day after luncheon, Madame de Rênal gave herself the
exquisite sensation of pleading her rival's cause, and of seeing
Elisa's hand and fortune persistently refused for an hour on
end.</p>

<p>Little by little Julien abandoned his attitude of studied
reserve, and ended by making spirited answers to the sound
arguments advanced by Madame de Rênal. She could not hold out
against the torrent of happiness which now poured into her heart
after all those days of despair. She found herself really ill. When
she had come to herself, and was comfortably settled in her own
room, she asked to be left alone. She was in a state of profound
astonishment.</p>

<p>'Can I be in love with Julien?' she asked herself at length.</p>

<p>This discovery, which at any other time would have filled her
with remorse and with a profound agitation, was no more to her than
a singular spectacle, but one that left her indifferent. Her heart,
exhausted by all that she had just undergone, had no sensibility
left to place at the service of her passions.</p>

<p>Madame de Rênal tried to work, and fell into a deep sleep; when
she awoke, she was less alarmed than she should have been. She was
too happy to be able to take anything amiss. Artless and innocent
as she was, this honest provincial had never tormented her soul in
an attempt to wring from it some little sensibility to some novel
shade of sentiment or distress. Entirely absorbed, before Julien
came, in that mass of work which, outside Paris, is the lot of a
good wife and mother, Madame de Rênal thought about the passions,
as we think about the lottery: a certain disappointment and a
happiness sought by fools alone.</p>

<p>The dinner bell rang; Madame de Rênal blushed deeply when she
heard Julien's voice as he brought in the children. Having acquired
some adroitness since she had fallen in love, she accounted for her
colour by complaining of a splitting headache.</p>

<p>'There you have women,' put in M. de Rênal, with a coarse laugh.
'There's always something out of order in their machinery.'</p>

<p>Accustomed as she was to this form of wit, the tone of his voice
hurt Madame de Rênal. She sought relief in studying Julien's
features; had he been the ugliest man in the world, he would have
charmed her at that moment.</p>

<p>Always zealous in imitating the habits of the Court, with the
first fine days of spring M. de Rênal removed his household to
Vergy; it is the village rendered famous by the tragic adventure of
Gabrielle. A few hundred yards from the picturesque ruins of the
old gothic church, M. de Rênal owned an old castle with its four
towers, and a garden laid out like that of the Tuileries, with a
number of box borders, and chestnut alleys trimmed twice in the
year. An adjoining field, planted with apple trees, allowed the
family to take the air. Nine or ten splendid walnuts grew at the
end of the orchard; their massive foliage rose to a height of some
eighty feet.</p>

<p>'Each of those damned walnuts,' M. de Rênal would say when his
wife admired them, 'costs me half an acre of crop; the corn will
not grow in their shade.'</p>

<p>The rustic scene appeared to come as a novelty to Madame de
Rênal; her admiration knew no bounds. The feeling that animated her
gave her a new spirit and determination. On the second day after
their removal to Vergy, M. de Rênal having returned to town upon
some official business, his wife engaged labourers at her own
expense. Julien had given her the idea of a little gravelled path,
which should run round the orchard and beneath the big walnuts, and
would allow the children to walk there in the early morning without
wetting their shoes in the dew. This plan was put into execution
within twenty-four hours of its conception. Madame de Rênal spent a
long and happy day with Julieu supervising the labourers.</p>

<p>When the Mayor of Verrières returned from the town, he was
greatly surprised to find the path finished. His coming surprised
Madame de Rênal also; she had forgotten that he existed. For the
next two months, he continued to speak with annoyance of their
presumption in having carried out, without consulting him, so
important a repair, but Madame de Rênal had done it at her own
expense, and this to some extent consoled him.</p>

<p>She spent her days running about the orchard with her children,
and chasing butterflies. They had made a number of large nets of
light-coloured gauze, with which they caught the unfortunate
lepidoptera. This was the outlandish name which Julien taught
Madame de Rênal. For she had sent to Besançon for the handsome work
on the subject by M. Godart; and Julien read to her the strange
habits of these insects.</p>

<p>They fastened them, without compunction, with pins upon a large
sheet of pasteboard, also prepared by Julien.</p>

<p>At last Madame de Rênal and Julien had a subject for
conversation; he was no longer exposed to the frightful torture
inflicted on him by intervals of silence.</p>

<p>They conversed incessantly, and with extreme interest, although
always of the most innocent things. This life, active, occupied and
cheerful, suited everyone, except Miss Elisa, who found herself
worked to death. 'Even at carnival-time,' she said, 'when there is
a ball at Verrières, Madame has never taken so much trouble over
her dress; she changes her clothes two or three times a day.'</p>

<p>As it is our intention to flatter no one, we shall not conceal
the fact that Madame de Rênal, who had a superb skin, had dresses
made for her which exposed her arms and bosom freely. She was very
well made, and this way of dressing suited her to perfection.</p>

<p>'You have never <i>been so young</i>, Ma'am,' her friends from
Verrières used to tell her when they came to dine at Vergy. (It is
a local form of speech.)</p>

<p>A curious point, which our readers will scarcely believe, was
that Madame de Rênal had no deliberate intention in taking such
pains with her appearance. She enjoyed doing so; and, without
giving the matter any particular thought, whenever she was not
chasing butterflies with the children and Julien, she was engaged
with Elisa making dresses. Her one expedition to Verrières was due
to a desire to purchase new summer clothes which had just arrived
there from Mulhouse.</p>

<p>She brought back with her to Vergy a young woman, one of her
cousins. Since her marriage, Madame de Rênal had gradually formed
an intimate friendship with Madame Derville, who in their younger
days had been her school-fellow at the Sacre-Coeur.</p>

<p>Madame Derville laughed heartily at what she called her cousin's
absurd ideas. 'If I were alone, they would never occur to me,' she
used to say. These sudden ideas, which in Paris would have been
called sallies, made Madame de Rênal feel ashamed, as of something
foolish, when she was with her husband; but Madame Derville's
presence gave her courage. She began by telling her what she was
thinking in a timid voice; when the ladies were by themselves for
any length of time, Madame de Rênal would become animated, and a
long, undisturbed morning passed in a flash and left the friends
quite merry. On this visit, the sensible Madame Derville found her
cousin much less merry and much happier.</p>

<p>Julien, meanwhile, had been living the life of a child since he
had come to the country, as happy to be running after butterflies
as were his pupils. After so much constraint and skilful diplomacy,
alone, unobserved by his fellow-men, and, instinctively, feeling
not in the least afraid of Madame de Rênal, he gave himself up to
the pleasure of being alive, so keen at his age, and in the midst
of the fairest mountains in the world.</p>

<p>As soon as Madame Derville arrived, Julien felt that she was his
friend; he hastened to show her the view that was to be seen from
the end of the new path; as a matter of fact it was equal, if not
superior to the most admirable scenery which Switzerland and the
Italian lakes have to offer. By climbing the steep slope which
began a few yards farther on, one came presently to high precipices
fringed with oakwoods, which projected almost over the bed of the
river. It was to the summits of these sheer rocks that Julien,
happy, free, and indeed something more, lord of the house, led the
two friends, and relished their admiration of those sublime
prospects.</p>

<p>'To me it is like Mozart's music,' said Madame Derville.</p>

<p>His brothers' jealousy, the presence of a despotic and
ill-tempered father had spoiled the country round Verrières in
Julien's eyes. At Vergy, he found no trace of these unpleasant
memories; for the first time in his life, he could see no one that
was his enemy. When M. de Rênal was in town, as frequently
happened, he ventured to read; soon, instead of reading at night,
and then taking care, moreover, to shade his lamp with an inverted
flower-pot, he could take his full measure of sleep; during the
day, in the interval between the children's lessons, he climbed up
among these rocks with the book that was his sole rule of conduct,
and the sole object of his transports. He found in it at once
happiness, ecstasy and consolation in moments of depression.</p>

<p>Certain things which Napoleon says of women, various discussions
of the merits of the novels in vogue during his reign, furnished
him now, for the first time, with several ideas which would long
since have been familiar to any other young man of his age.</p>

<p>The hot weather came. They formed the habit of spending the
evening under a huge lime a few yards from the house. There the
darkness was intense. One evening, Julien was talking with
emphasis, he was revelling in the pleasure of talking well and to
young married women; as he gesticulated, he touched the hand of
Madame de Rênal, who was leaning on the back of one of those chairs
of painted wood that are placed in gardens.</p>

<p>The hand was hurriedly withdrawn; but Julien decided that it was
his <i>duty</i> to securé that the hand should not be withdrawn
when he touched it. The idea of a duty to be performed, and of
making himself ridiculous, or rather being left with a sense of
inferiority if he did not succeed in performing it, at once took
all the pleasure from his heart.</p>

<h2><a name="ch9" id="ch9"></a>Chapter 9. An Evening in the
Country</h2>

<p style="margin-left:10%">M. Guerin's Dido, a charming sketch!<br>
&mdash;STROMBECK</p>

<p>When he saw Madame de Rênal again, the next morning, there was a
strange look in his eyes; he watched her like an enemy with whom he
would presently be engaged. This expression, so different from his
expression overnight, made Madame de Rênal lose her head; she had
been kind to him, and he appeared vexed. She could not take her
eyes from his.</p>

<p>Madame Derville's presence excused Julien from his share of the
conversation, and enabled him to concentrate his attention upon
what he had in mind. His sole occupation, throughout the day, was
that of fortifying himself by reading the inspired text which
refreshed his soul.</p>

<p>He greatly curtailed the children's lessons, and when, later on,
the presence of Madame de Rênal recalled him to the service of his
own vanity, decided that it was absolutely essential that this
evening she should allow her hand to remain in his.</p>

<p>The sun as it set and so brought nearer the decisive moment made
Julien's heart beat with a strange excitement. Night fell. He
observed, with a joy that lifted a huge weight from his breast,
that it was very dark. A sky packed with big clouds, kept in motion
by a hot breeze, seemed to forebode a tempest. The two women
continued strolling until a late hour. Everything that they did
this evening seemed strange to Julien. They were enjoying this
weather, which, in certain delicate natures, seems to enhance the
pleasure of love.</p>

<p>At last they sat down, Madame de Rênal next to Julien, and
Madame Derville on the other side of her friend. Preoccupied with
the attempt he must shortly make, Julien could think of nothing to
say. The conversation languished.</p>

<p>'Shall I tremble like this and feel as uncomfortable the first
time I have to fight a duel?' Julien wondered; for he had too
little confidence either in himself or in others not to observe the
state he was in.</p>

<p>In this agonising uncertainty, any danger would have seemed to
him preferable. How often did he long to see Madame de Rênal called
by some duty which would oblige her to return to the house and so
leave the garden! The violence of the effort which Julien had to
make to control himself was such that his voice was entirely
altered; presently Madame de Rênal's voice became tremulous also,
but Julien never noticed this. The ruthless warfare which his sense
of duty was waging with his natural timidity was too exhausting for
him to be in a condition to observe anything outside himself. The
quarter before ten had sounded from the tower clock, without his
having yet ventured on anything. Julien, ashamed of his cowardice,
told himself: 'At the precise moment when ten o'clock strikes, I
shall carry out the intention which, all day long, I have been
promising myself that I would fulfil this evening, or I shall go up
to my room and blow my brains out.'</p>

<p>After a final interval of tension and anxiety, during which the
excess of his emotion carried Julien almost out of his senses, the
strokes of ten sounded from the clock overhead. Each stroke of that
fatal bell stirred an echo in his bosom, causing him almost a
physical revulsion.</p>

<p>Finally, while the air was still throbbing with the last stroke
of ten, he put out his hand and took that of Madame de Rênal, who
at once withdrew it. Julien, without exactly knowing what he was
doing, grasped her hand again. Although greatly moved himself, he
was struck by the icy coldness of the hand he was clasping; he
pressed it with convulsive force; a last attempt was made to remove
it from him, but finally the hand was left in his grasp.</p>

<p>His heart was flooded with joy, not because he loved Madame de
Rênal, but because a fearful torment was now at an end. So that
Madame Derville should not notice anything, he felt himself obliged
to speak; his voice, now, was loud and ringing. Madame de Rênal's,
on the other hand, betrayed such emotion that her friend thought
she must be ill and suggested to her that they should go indoors.
Julien saw the danger: 'If Madame de Rênal returns to the
drawing-room, I am going to fall back into the horrible position I
have been in all day. I have not held this hand long enough to be
able to reckon it as a definite conquest.'</p>

<p>When Madame Derville repeated her suggestion that they should go
into the drawing-room, Julien pressed the hand that lay in his.</p>

<p>Madame de Rênal, who was preparing to rise, resumed her seat,
saying in a faint tone:</p>

<p>'I do, as a matter of fact, feel a little unwell, but the fresh
air is doing me good.'</p>

<p>These words confirmed Julien's happiness, which, at this moment,
was extreme: he talked, forgot to dissimulate, appeared the most
charming of men to his two hearers. And yet there was still a
slight want of courage in this eloquence which had suddenly come to
him. He was in a deadly fear lest Madame Derville, exhausted by the
wind which was beginning to rise, and heralded the storm, might
decide to go in by herself to the drawing-room. Then he would be
left alone with Madame de Rênal. He had found almost by accident
the blind courage which was sufficient for action; but he felt that
it lay beyond his power to utter the simplest of words to Madame de
Rênal. However mild her reproaches might be, he was going to be
defeated, and the advantage which he had just gained wiped out.</p>

<p>Fortunately for him, this evening, his touching and emphatic
speeches found favour with Madame Derville, who as a rule found him
as awkward as a schoolboy, and by no means amusing. As for Madame
de Rênal, her hand lying clasped in Julien's, she had no thought of
anything; she was allowing herself to live. The hours they spent
beneath this huge lime, which, local tradition maintained, had been
planted by Charles the Bold, were for her a time of happiness. She
listened with rapture to the moaning of the wind in the thick
foliage of the lime, and the sound of the first few drops that were
beginning to fall upon its lowest leaves. Julien did not notice a
detail which would have greatly reassured him; Madame de Rênal, who
had been obliged to remove her hand from his, on rising to help her
cousin to pick up a pot of flowers which the wind had overturned at
their feet, had no sooner sat down again than she gave him back her
hand almost without difficulty, and as though it had been an
understood thing between them.</p>

<p>Midnight had long since struck; at length it was time to leave
the garden: the party broke up. Madame de Rênal, transported by the
joy of being in love, was so ignorant that she hardly reproached
herself at all. Happiness robbed her of sleep. A sleep like lead
carried off Julien, utterly worn out by the battle that had been
raging all day in his heart between timidity and pride.</p>

<p>Next morning he was called at five o'clock; and (what would have
been a cruel blow to Madame de Rênal had she known of it) he barely
gave her a thought. He had done <i>his duty, and a heroic duty</i>.
Filled with joy by this sentiment, he turned the key in the door of
his bedroom and gave himself up with an entirely new pleasure to
reading about the exploits of his hero.</p>

<p>When the luncheon bell sounded, he had forgotten, in reading the
reports of the Grand Army, all the advantages he had won overnight.
He said to himself, in a careless tone, as he went down to the
drawing-room: 'I must tell this woman that I love her.'</p>

<p>Instead of that gaze charged with passion which he expected to
meet, he found the stern face of M. de Rênal, who, having arrived a
couple of hours earlier from Verrières, did not conceal his
displeasure on finding that Julien was wasting the whole morning
without attending to the children. No sight could have been so
unprepossessing as that of this self-important man, conscious of a
grievance and confident of his right to let it be seen.</p>

<p>Each of her husband's harsh words pierced Madame de Rênal to the
heart. As for Julien, he was so plunged in ecstasy, still so
absorbed in the great events which for the last few hours had been
happening before his eyes, that at first he could barely lower the
pitch of his attention to listen to the stern voice of M. de Rênal.
At length he answered him, sharply enough:</p>

<p>'I was unwell.'</p>

<p>The tone of this reply would have stung a man far less
susceptible than the Mayor of Verrières; it occurred to him to
reply to Julien with an immediate dismissal. He was restrained only
by the maxim which he had laid down for himself, never to be too
hasty in business matters.</p>

<p>'This young fool,' he soon reminded himself, 'has made himself a
sort of reputation in my house; Valenod may take him on, or else he
will marry Elisa, and, in either case, he can afford to laugh at me
in his heart.'</p>

<p>Despite the wisdom of these reflections, M. de Rênal's
displeasure found an outlet nevertheless in a succession of coarse
utterances which succeeded in irritating Julien. Madame de Rênal
was on the point of subsiding in tears. As soon as the meal was
ended, she asked Julien to give her his arm for their walk; she
leaned upon it in a friendly way. To all that Madame de Rênal said
to him, Julien could only murmur in reply:</p>

<p>'This is what rich people are like!'</p>

<p>M. de Rênal kept close beside them; his presence increased
Julien's anger. He noticed suddenly that Madame de Rênal was
leaning upon his arm in a marked manner; this action horrified him,
he repulsed her violently, freeing his arm from hers.</p>

<p>Fortunately M. de Rênal saw nothing of this fresh impertinence;
it was noticed only by Madame Derville; her friend burst into
tears. At this moment M. de Rênal began flinging stones at a little
peasant girl who was trespassing by taking a short cut across a
corner of the orchard.</p>

<p>'Monsieur Julien, kindly control yourself, remember that we are
all of us liable to moments of ill temper,' Madame Derville said
hastily.</p>

<p>Julien looked at her coldly with eyes in which the loftiest
contempt was portrayed.</p>

<p>This look astonished Madame Derville, and would have surprised
her far more could she have guessed its full meaning; she would
have read in it a vague hope of the most terrible revenge. It is
doubtless to such moments of humiliation that we owe men like
Robespierre.</p>

<p>'Your Julien is very violent, he frightens me,' Madame Derville
murmured to her friend.</p>

<p>'He has every reason to be angry,' the other replied. 'After the
astonishing progress the children have made with him, what does it
matter if he spends a morning without speaking to them? You must
admit that gentlemen are very hard.'</p>

<p>For the first time in her life, Madame de Rênal felt a sort of
desire to be avenged on her husband. The intense hatred that
animated Julien against rich people was about to break forth.
Fortunately M. de Rênal called for his gardener, with whom for the
rest of the time he busied himself in stopping up with faggots of
thorn the short cut that had been made across the orchard. Julien
did not utter a single word in reply to the attentions that were
shown him throughout the remainder of the walk. As soon as M. de
Rênal had left them, the two ladies, on the plea that they were
tired, had asked him each for an arm.</p>

<p>As he walked between these women whose cheeks were flushed with
the embarrassment of an intense discomfort, Julien's sombre and
decided air formed a striking contrast. He despised these women,
and all tender feelings.</p>

<p>'What!' he said to himself, 'not even an allowance of five
hundred francs to complete my studies! Ah! How I should send her
packing!'</p>

<p>Absorbed in these drastic thoughts, the little that he deigned
to take in of the polite speeches of the two ladies displeased him
as being devoid of meaning, silly, feeble, in a word
<i>feminine</i>.</p>

<p>By dint of talking for talking's sake, and of trying to keep the
conversation alive, Madame de Rênal found herself saying that her
husband had come from Verrières because he had made a bargain, for
the purchase of maize straw, with one of his farmers. (In this
district maize straw is used to stuff the palliasses of the
beds.)</p>

<p>'My husband will not be joining us again,' Madame de Rênal went
on: 'he will be busy with the gardener and his valet changing the
straw in all the palliasses in the house. This morning he put fresh
straw on all the beds on the first floor, now he is at work on the
second.'</p>

<p>Julien changed colour; he looked at Madame de Rênal in an odd
manner, and presently drew her apart, so to speak, by increasing
his pace. Madame Derville allowed them to move away from her.</p>

<p>'Save my life,' said Julien to Madame de Rênal, 'you alone can
do it; for you know that the valet hates me like poison. I must
confess to you, Ma'am, that I have a portrait; I have hidden it in
the palliasse on my bed.'</p>

<p>At these words, Madame de Rênal in turn grew pale.</p>

<p>'You alone, Ma'am, can go into my room at this moment; feel,
without letting yourself be observed, in the corner of the
palliasse nearest to the window; you will find there a small box of
shiny black pasteboard.'</p>

<p>'It contains a portrait?' said Madame de Rênal, barely able to
stand.</p>

<p>Her air of disappointment was noticed by Julien, who at once
took advantage of it.</p>

<p>'I have a second favour to ask of you, Ma'am; I beg you not to
look at the portrait, it is my secret.'</p>

<p>'It is a secret!' repeated Madame de Rênal, in faint
accents.</p>

<p>But, albeit she had been reared among people proud of their
wealth, and sensible of pecuniary interests alone, love had already
instilled some generosity into her heart. Though cruelly wounded,
it was with an air of the simplest devotion that Madame de Rênal
put to Julien the questions necessary to enable her to execute his
commission properly.</p>

<p>'And so,' she said, as she left him, 'it is a little round box,
of black pasteboard, and very shiny.'</p>

<p>'Yes, Ma'am,' replied Julien in that hard tone which danger
gives a man.</p>

<p>She mounted to the second floor of the house, as pale as though
she were going to her death. To complete her misery she felt that
she was on the point of fainting, but the necessity of doing Julien
a service restored her strength.</p>

<p>'I must have that box,' she said to herself as she quickened her
pace.</p>

<p>She could hear her husband talking to the valet, actually in
Julien's room. Fortunately they moved into the room in which the
children slept. She lifted the mattress and plunged her hand into
the straw with such force as to scratch her fingers. But, although
extremely sensitive to slight injuries of this sort, she was now
quite unconscious of the pain, for almost immediately she felt the
polished surface of the pasteboard box. She seized it and fled.</p>

<p>No sooner was she rid of the fear of being surprised by her
husband, than the horror inspired in her by this box made her feel
that in another minute she must unquestionably faint.</p>

<p>'So Julien is in love, and I have here the portrait of the woman
he loves.'</p>

<p>Seated on a chair in the sitting-room of this apartment, Madame
de Rênal fell a prey to all the horrors of jealousy. Her extreme
ignorance was of service to her again at this moment; astonishment
tempered her grief. Julien appeared, snatched the box, without
thanking her, without saying a word, and ran into his bedroom,
where he struck a light and immediately destroyed it. He was pale,
speechless; he exaggerated to himself the risk he had been
running.</p>

<p>'The portrait of Napoleon,' he said to himself with a toss of
the head, 'found hidden in the room of a man who professes such
hatred for the usurper! Found by M. de Rênal, so <i>ultra</i> and
so angry! and, to complete the imprudence, on the white card at the
back of the portrait, lines in my writing! And lines that can leave
no doubt as to the warmth of my admiration! And each of those
transports of love is dated! There was one only two days ago!</p>

<p>'All my reputation brought down, destroyed in a moment!' Julien
said to himself as he watched the box burn, 'and my reputation is
all I have, I live by it alone...and what a life at that, great
God!'</p>

<p>An hour later, his exhaustion and the pity he felt for himself
disposed him to feel affection. He met Madame de Rênal and took her
hand which he kissed with more sincerity than he had ever yet
shown. She coloured with delight, and almost simultaneously
repulsed Julien with the anger of a jealous woman. Julien's pride,
so recently wounded, made a fool of him at that moment. He saw in
Madame de Rênal only a rich woman, he let fall her hand with
contempt, and strode away. He went out and walked pensively in the
garden; presently a bitter smile appeared on his lips.</p>

<p>'Here I am walking about as calm as a man who is his own master!
I am not looking after the children! I am exposing myself to the
humiliating remarks of M. de Rênal, and he will be justified.' He
hastened to the children's room.</p>

<p>The caresses of the youngest boy, to whom he was greatly
attached, did something to soothe his agonising pain.</p>

<p>'This one does not despise me yet,' thought Julien. But
presently he blamed himself for this relief from pain, as for a
fresh weakness. These children fondle me as they might fondle the
puppy that was bought yesterday.'</p>

<h2><a name="ch10" id="ch10"></a>Chapter 10. A Large Heart and a
Small Fortune</h2>

<p style="margin-left:10%">But passion most dissembles, yet
betrays,<br>
Even by its darkness; as the blackest sky<br>
Foretells the heaviest tempest.<br>
&mdash;<i>Don Juan</i>, I. 73</p>

<p>M. de Rênal, who was visiting every room in the house,
reappeared in the children's room with the servants who brought
back the palliasses refilled. The sudden entry of this man was the
last straw to Julien.</p>

<p>Paler, more sombre than usual, he advanced towards him. M. de
Rênal stood still and looked at his servants.</p>

<p>'Sir,' Julien began, 'do you suppose that with any other tutor
your children would have made the same progress that they have made
with me? If your answer is no,' he went on without giving M. de
Rênal time to speak, 'how dare you presume to reproach me with
neglecting them?'</p>

<p>M. de Rênal, who had barely recovered from his alarm, concluded
from the strange tone which he saw this young peasant adopt that he
had in his pocket some more attractive offer and was going to leave
him. Julien's anger increasing as he spoke:</p>

<p>'I can live without you, Sir,' he concluded.</p>

<p>'I am extremely sorry to see you so agitated,' replied M. de
Rênal, stammering a little. The servants were a few feet away, and
were occupied in making the beds.</p>

<p>'That is not enough for me, Sir,' Julien went on, beside himself
with rage; 'think of the abominable things you said to me, and in
the presence of ladies, too!'</p>

<p>M. de Rênal was only too well aware of what Julien was asking,
and conflicting passions did battle in his heart. It so happened
that Julien, now really mad with rage, exclaimed: 'I know where to
go, Sir, when I leave your house.'</p>

<p>On hearing these words, M. de Rênal had a vision of Julien
established in M. Valenod's household.</p>

<p>'Very well, Sir,' he said at length with a sigh, and the air of
a man calling in a surgeon to perform the most painful operation,
'I agree to your request. From the day after tomorrow, which is the
first of the month, I shall give you fifty francs monthly.'</p>

<p>Julien wanted to laugh and remained speechless: his anger had
completely vanished.</p>

<p>'I did not despise the animal enough,' he said to himself.
'This, no doubt, is the most ample apology so base a nature is
capable of making.'</p>

<p>The children, who had listened to this scene open-mouthed, ran
to the garden to tell their mother that M. Julien was in a great
rage, but that he was to have fifty francs a month.</p>

<p>Julien went after them from force of habit, without so much as a
glance at M. de Rênal, whom he left in a state of intense
annoyance.</p>

<p>'That's a hundred and sixty-eight francs,' the Mayor said to
himself, 'that M. Valenod has cost me. I must really say a few firm
words to him about his contract to supply the foundlings.'</p>

<p>A moment later, Julien again stood before him.</p>

<p>'I have a matter of conscience to discuss with M. Chélan. I have
the honour to inform you that I shall be absent for some
hours.'</p>

<p>'Ah, my dear Julien,' said M. de Rênal, laughing in the most
insincere manner, 'the whole day, if you wish, the whole of
tomorrow, my worthy friend. Take the gardener's horse to go to
Verrières.'</p>

<p>'There,' M. de Rênal said to himself, 'he's going with an answer
to Valenod; he's given me no promise, but we must let the young
hothead cool down.'</p>

<p>Julien made a speedy escape and climbed up among the big woods
through which one can go from Vergy to Verrières. He was in no
hurry to reach M. Chélan's. So far from desiring to involve himself
in a fresh display of hypocrisy, he needed time to see clearly into
his own heart, and to give audience to the swarm of conflicting
feelings that disturbed it.</p>

<p>'I have won a battle,' he said to himself as soon as he found
himself in the shelter of the woods and out of sight of anyone, 'I
have really won a battle!'</p>

<p>The last word painted his whole position for him in glowing
colours, and restored some degree of tranquillity to his heart.</p>

<p>'Here I am with a salary of fifty francs a month; M. de Rênal
must be in a fine fright. But of what?'</p>

<p>His meditation as to what could have frightened the prosperous
and powerful man against whom, an hour earlier, he had been
seething with rage completely restored Julien's serenity. He was
almost conscious, for a moment, of the exquisite beauty of the
woods through which he was walking. Enormous fragments of bare rock
had in times past fallen into the heart of the forest from the side
of the mountain. Tall beeches rose almost as high as these rocks
whose shadow provided a delicious coolness within a few yards of
places where the heat of the sun's rays would have made it
impossible to stop.</p>

<p>Julien paused for a breathing-space in the shadow of these great
rocks, then went on climbing. Presently, by following a narrow
path, barely visible and used only by goatherds, he found himself
standing upon an immense rock, where he could be certain of his
complete isolation from his fellow-men. This natural position made
him smile, it suggested to him the position to which he was burning
to attain in the moral sphere. The pure air of these lofty
mountains breathed serenity and even joy into his soul. The Mayor
of Verrières might still, in his eyes, be typical of all the rich
and insolent denizens of the earth, but Julien felt that the hatred
which had convulsed him that afternoon contained, notwithstanding
its violence, no element of personal ill-feeling. Should he cease
to see M. de Rênal, within a week he would have forgotten him, the
man himself, his house, his dogs, his children and all that was
his. 'I have forced him, I do not know how, to make the greatest of
sacrifices. What, more than fifty crowns a year? A moment earlier I
had just escaped from the greatest danger. That makes two victories
in one day; the second contains no merit, I must try to discover
the reason. But we can leave such arduous research for
tomorrow.'</p>

<p>Julien, erect upon his mighty rock, gazed at the sky, kindled to
flame by an August sun. The grasshoppers were chirping in the patch
of meadow beneath the rock; when they ceased everything around him
was silence. Twenty leagues of country lay at his feet. From time
to time a hawk, risen from the bare cliffs above his head, caught
his eye as it wheeled silently in its vast circles. Julien's eye
followed mechanically the bird of prey. Its calm, powerful motion
impressed him, he envied such strength, he envied such
isolation.</p>

<p>It was the destiny of Napoleon, was it one day to be his
own?</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch11" id="ch11"></a>Chapter 11. Night Thoughts</h2>

<p style="margin-left:10%">Yet Julia's very coldness still was
kind,<br>
And tremulously gentle her small hand<br>
Withdrew itself from his, but left behind<br>
A little pressure, thrilling, and so bland<br>
And slight, so very slight, that to the mind<br>
Twas but a doubt.<br>
&mdash;<i>Don Juan</i>, I. 71</p>

<p>He must, however, let himself be seen at Verrières. As he left
the Presbytery the first person he met was, by a happy chance, M.
Valenod, whom he hastened to inform of the increase in his
salary.</p>

<p>On his return to Vergy, Julien did not go down to the garden
until night had set in. His heart was worn out by the multitude of
powerful emotions that had assailed it in the course of the day.
'What shall I say to them?' he asked himself anxiously, thinking of
the ladies. It never occurred to him that his spirits were
precisely at the level of the trivial happenings that as a rule
occupy the whole interest of women. Often Julien was unintelligible
to Madame Derville, and even to her friend, while he in turn only
half understood all that they were saying to him. Such was the
effect of the force, and, if I may use the word, of the magnitude
of the waves of passion on which the heart of this ambitious youth
was being tossed. In this strange creature almost every day was one
of storm.</p>

<p>When he went into the garden that evening, Julien was ready to
listen with interest to the thoughts of the fair cousins. They
awaited his coming with impatience. He took his accustomed seat, by
Madame de Rênal's side. The darkness soon became intense. He
attempted to clasp a white hand which for some time he had seen
close beside him, resting on the back of a chair. There was some
hesitation shown, but finally the hand was withdrawn from him in a
manner which betokened displeasure. Julien was prepared to regard
this as final, and to continue the conversation in a light tone,
when he heard M. de Rênal approach.</p>

<p>The rude words of the morning still rang in Julien's ears.
'Would it not,' he said to himself, 'be a good way of scoring off
this creature, so lavishly endowed with every material advantage,
to take possession of his wife's hand under his very eyes? Yes, I
will do it, I, for whom he has shown such contempt.'</p>

<p>&gt;From that moment peace of mind, so ill assorted to Julien's
character, speedily vanished; he desired most anxiously, and
without being able to fix his mind on anything else, that Madame de
Rênal might consent to let him hold her hand.</p>

<p>M. de Rênal talked politics in an angry tone: two or three
manufacturers at Verrières were becoming decidedly richer than
himself, and wished to oppose him at the elections. Madame Derville
listened to him. Julien, irritated by this talk, moved his chair
nearer to Madame de Rênal's. The darkness hid every movement. He
ventured to place his hand close to the pretty arm which her gown
left bare. Troubled, no longer conscious of what he was doing, he
moved his cheek in the direction of this pretty arm, and made bold
to press his lips to it.</p>

<p>Madame de Rênal shuddered. Her husband was a few feet away, she
hastened to give Julien her hand, at the same time thrusting him
slightly from her. While M. de Rênal continued his abuse of the
good-for-nothings and Jacobins who were making fortunes, Julien
covered the hand which had been left in his with passionate kisses,
or so at least they seemed to Madame de Rênal. And yet the poor
woman had been furnished with proof, on this fatal day, that the
heart of the man whom she adored without confessing it was pledged
elsewhere! Throughout the hours of Julien's absence, she had been a
prey to the most abject misery, which had made her think.</p>

<p>'What,' she said to herself, 'am I to love, to have love offered
to me? Am I, a married woman, to fall in love? But,' she reminded
herself, 'I have never felt that dark passion for my husband, and
so I cannot tear my mind from Julien. At heart he is only a boy
filled with respect for me! This folly will pass. How can it
concern my husband what feelings I may entertain for this young
man? M. de Rênal would be bored by the talks I have with Julien,
about things of the imagination. He himself thinks only about his
business. I am taking nothing from him to give to Julien.'</p>

<p>No trace of hypocrisy came to sully the purity of this simple
soul, carried away by a passion such as she had never felt. She was
deceived, but quite unawares, and at the same time a virtuous
instinct had taken alarm. Such were the conflicts that were
agitating her when Julien appeared in the garden. She heard his
voice, almost at the same moment she saw him sit down by her side.
Her heart was so to speak carried away by this charming happiness
which for the last fortnight had astonished even more than it had
bewitched her. Everything was unexpected to her. And yet after a
few moments: 'So Julien's presence is enough,' she said to herself,
'to wipe out all memory of his misconduct?' She took fright; then
it was that she withdrew her hand from his.</p>

<p>His kisses, filled with passion and such as she had never yet
received, made her at once forget the possibility of his loving
another woman. Soon he was no longer guilty in her eyes. The
cessation of her poignant grief, born of suspicion, the presence of
a happiness of which she had never even dreamed, plunged her in
transports of affection and wild gaiety. That evening was
delightful for them all, except for the Mayor of Verrières, who
could not forget the growing wealth of his competitors. Julien no
longer thought of his dark ambition, nor of his plans that would be
so difficult of execution. For the first time in his life, he was
carried away by the power of beauty. Lost in a vague and pleasant
dream, so foreign to his nature, gently pressing that hand which
pleased him as an example of perfect beauty, he gave a divided
attention to the rustle of the leaves of the lime, stirred by the
gentle night breeze, and to the dogs at the mill by the Doubs,
barking in the distance.</p>

<p>But this emotion was a pleasure and not a passion. On returning
to his room he thought of one happiness only, that of going on with
his favourite book; at twenty, the thought of the world and of the
impression one is going to make on it, prevails over everything
else.</p>

<p>Presently, however, he put down the book. By dint of dreaming of
Napoleon's victories, he had discerned a new element in his own.
'Yes, I have won a battle,' he told himself, 'but I must follow it
up, I must crush the arrogance of this proud gentleman while he is
still retreating. That is Napoleon out and out. I must ask him for
three days' holiday, to go and see my friend Fouque. If he refuses,
I again offer to break the agreement; but he will give way.'</p>

<p>Madame de Rênal could not close an eye. She felt that she had
never lived until that moment. She could not tear her mind from the
happiness of feeling Julien cover her hand with burning kisses.</p>

<p>Suddenly the horrid word <i>adultery</i> occurred to her. All
the most disgusting implications that the vilest debauchery can
impart to the idea of sensual love came crowding into her
imagination. These ideas sought to tarnish the tender and godlike
image that she had made for herself of Julien and of the pleasure
of loving him. The future portrayed itself in terrible colours. She
saw herself an object of scorn.</p>

<p>It was a frightful moment; her soul journeyed into strange
lands. That evening she had tasted an unknown happiness; now she
suddenly found herself plunged in appalling misery. She had no
conception of such sufferings; they began to affect her reason. The
thought occurred to her for a moment of confessing to her husband
that she was afraid of falling in love with Julien. It would have
allowed her to speak of him. Fortunately she recalled a piece of
advice given her long ago by her aunt, on the eve of her marriage.
It warned her of the danger of confiding in a husband, who is after
all a master. In the intensity of her grief she wrung her
hands.</p>

<p>She was carried away indiscriminately by conflicting and painful
imaginings. At one moment she was afraid of not being loved in
return, at another the fearful thought of the crime tortured her as
though on the morrow she would have to be exposed in the pillory,
on the public square of Verrières, with a placard proclaiming her
adultery to the populace.</p>

<p>Madame de Rênal was without any experience of life; even when
wide awake and in the full exercise of her reason, she would have
seen no distinction between being guilty in the sight of God and
finding herself publicly greeted with all the most flagrant marks
of general opprobrium.</p>

<p>When the frightful idea of adultery and of all the ignominy
which (she supposed) that crime brings in its train gave her at
length a respite, and she began to dream of the delight of living
with Julien innocently, as in the past, she found herself swept
away by the horrible thought that Julien was in love with another
woman. She saw once again his pallor when he was afraid of losing
her portrait, or of compromising her by letting it be seen. For the
first time, she had surprised signs of fear on that calm and noble
countenance. Never had he shown himself in such a state for her or
for her children. This additional grief carried her to the utmost
intensity of anguish which the human soul is able to endure.
Unconsciously, Madame de Rênal uttered cries which roused her maid.
Suddenly she saw appear by her bedside the light of a lamp, and
recognised Elisa.</p>

<p>'Is it you that he loves?' she cried in her frenzy.</p>

<p>The maid, amazed at the fearful distress in which she found her
mistress, paid no attention fortunately to this singular utterance.
Madame de Rênal realised her own imprudence: 'I am feverish,' she
told her, 'and I think, a little light-headed; stay beside me.'</p>

<p>Thoroughly awakened by the necessity of controlling herself, she
felt less wretched; reason resumed the sway of which her state of
drowsiness had deprived it. To escape from the fixed stare of her
maid, she ordered her to read the newspaper aloud, and it was to
the monotonous sound of the girl's voice, reading a long article
from the <i>Quotidienne</i>, that Madame de Rênal formed the
virtuous resolution to treat Julien with absolute coldness when
next she saw him.</p>

<p style="margin-left:10%">In Paris you find elegant people,<br>

&mdash;SIEYES</p>

<p>Next morning, at five o'clock, before Madame de Rênal was
visible, Julien had obtained from her husband three days' leave of
absence. Contrary to his expectation, Julien found himself longing
to see her again, and could think of nothing but that shapely hand.
He went down to the garden, Madame de Rênal was long in coming. But
if Julien had been in love with her he would have seen her, behind
her half-closed shutters on the first floor, her face pressed to
the glass. She was watching him. At length, in spite of her
resolutions, she decided to show herself in the garden. Her
customary pallor had given place to the most glowing colour. This
simple-minded woman was evidently agitated: a feeling of constraint
and even of resentment marred that expression of profound serenity,
as though raised above all the common interests of life, which gave
such charm to that heavenly face.</p>

<p>Julien lost no time in joining her; he admired those fine arms
which a shawl flung in haste across her shoulders left visible. The
coolness of the morning air seemed to increase the brilliance of a
complexion which the agitation of the past night made all the more
sensible to every impression. This beauty, modest and touching, and
yet full of thoughts which are nowhere to be found among the lower
orders, seemed to reveal to Julien an aspect of her nature of which
he had never yet been aware. Wholly absorbed in admiration of the
charms which his greedy eye surprised, Julien was not thinking of
the friendly greeting which he might expect to receive. He was all
the more astonished by the icy coldness that was shown him, beneath
which he even thought he could make out a deliberate intention to
put him in his place.</p>

<p>The smile of pleasure faded from his lips; he remembered the
rank that he occupied in society, especially in the eyes of a noble
and wealthy heiress. In a moment, his features showed nothing but
pride and anger with himself. He felt a violent disgust at having
been so foolish as to postpone his departure by more than an hour,
only to receive so humiliating a greeting.</p>

<p>'Only a fool,' he told himself, 'loses his temper with other
people: a stone falls because it is heavy. Am I always to remain a
boy? When am I going to form the good habit of giving these people
their exact money's worth and no more of my heart and soul? If I
wish to be esteemed by them and by myself, I must show them that it
is my poverty that deals with their wealth, but that my heart is a
thousand leagues away from their insolence, and is placed in too
exalted a sphere to be reached by their petty marks of contempt or
favour.'</p>

<p>While these sentiments came crowding into the young tutor's
mind, his features assumed an expression of injured pride and
ferocity. Madame de Rênal was greatly distressed by this. The
virtuous coldness which she had meant to impart to her greeting
gave way to an expression of interest, and of an interest animated
by the surprise of the sudden change which she had just beheld in
him. The flow of idle words that people exchange in the morning
with regard to one another's health, to the beauty of the day, and
so forth, dried up at once in them both. Julien, whose judgment was
not disturbed by any passion, soon found a way of letting Madame de
Rênal see how little he regarded himself as being on terms of
friendship with her; he said nothing to her of the little
expedition on which he was starting, bowed to her, and set off.</p>

<p>As she watched him go, overwhelmed by the sombre pride which she
read in that glance, so friendly the evening before, her eldest
son, who came running up from the other end of the garden, said to
her as he embraced her:</p>

<p>'We have a holiday, M. Julien is going on a journey.'</p>

<p>At these words Madame de Rênal felt herself frozen by a deadly
chill; she was unhappy in her virtue, and more unhappy still in her
weakness.</p>

<p>This latest development now occupied the whole of her
imagination; she was carried far beyond the wise resolutions which
were the fruit of the terrible night she had passed. It was a
question no longer of resisting this charming lover, but of losing
him for ever.</p>

<p>She was obliged to take her place at table. To add to her
misery, M. de Rênal and Madame Derville spoke of nothing but
Julien's departure. The Mayor of Verrières had remarked something,
unusual in the firm tone with which he had demanded a holiday.</p>

<p>'The young peasant has doubtless an offer from someone in his
pocket. But that someone, even if it should be M. Valenod, must be
a little discouraged by the sum of 600 francs, which he must now be
prepared to spend annually. Yesterday, at Verrières, he will have
asked for three days in which to think things over; and this
morning, so as not to be obliged to give me an answer, the young
gentleman goes off to the mountains. To have to reckon with a
wretched workman who puts on airs, that's what we've come to!'</p>

<p>'Since my husband, who does not know how deeply he has wounded
Julien, thinks he is going to leave us, what am I to suppose?'
Madame de Rênal asked herself. 'Ah! It is all settled!'</p>

<p>So as to be able at least to weep in freedom, and without having
to answer Madame Derville's questions, she pleaded a splitting
headache, and retired to bed.</p>

<p>'There you have a woman all over,' M. de Rênal repeated;
'there's always something wrong with those complicated machines.'
And he went on his way jeering.</p>

<p>While Madame de Rênal was at the mercy of the most cruel
inflictions of the terrible passion into which accident had led
her, Julien was making his way light-heartedly amid the loveliest
views that mountain scenery has to offer. He was obliged to pass
over the high range to the north of Vergy. The path which he
followed, rising gradually amid great beechwoods, forms an endless
series of zigzags on the side of the high mountain which bounds the
valley of the Doubs on the north. Presently the traveller's gaze,
passing over the lower ridges which confine the course of the Doubs
on the south, was able to sweep the fertile plains of Burgundy and
Beaujolais. Irresponsive as the heart of this ambitious youth might
be to this kind of beauty, he could not refrain from stopping now
and again to gaze at so vast and so imposing a prospect.</p>

<p>At length he came to the summit of the high mountain, beneath
which he must pass in order to arrive, by this diagonal route, at
the lonely valley in which his friend Fouque, the young timber
merchant, lived. Julien was in no hurry to see him, or any other
human being for that matter. Concealed like a bird of prey, amid
the bare rocks which crowned the high mountain, he could see a long
way off anyone that might be coming his way. He discovered a small
cave in the almost perpendicular face of one of the rocks. He set
his course for it, and presently was ensconced in this retreat.
'Here,' he said, his eyes sparkling with joy, 'men can do me no
harm.' It occurred to him to indulge in the pleasure of writing
down his thoughts, so dangerous to him in any other place. A smooth
block of stone served as his table. His pen flew: he saw nothing of
the scene round about him. At length he noticed that the sun was
setting behind the distant mountains of Beaujolais.</p>

<p>'Why should I not spend the night here?' he asked himself; 'I
have bread, and <i>I am free</i>!' At the sound of that great word
his heart leaped, his hypocrisy meant that he was not free even
with Fouque. His head supported on both his hands, Julien stayed in
this cave happier than he had ever been in his life, engrossed in
his dreams and in the joy of freedom. Without heeding it he saw
fade and die, one after another, the last rays of evening light. In
the midst of that vast darkness, his soul wandered in contemplation
of what he imagined that he would one day find in Paris. This was
first and foremost a woman far more beautiful and of a far higher
intelligence than any it had been his lot to see in the country. He
loved with passion, he was loved in return. If he tore himself from
her for a few moments, it was to cover himself with glory and earn
the right to be loved more warmly still.</p>

<p>Even if we allow him Julien's imagination, a young man brought
up among the melancholy truths of Paris would have been aroused at
this stage in his romance by the cold touch of irony; the mighty
deeds would have vanished with the hope of performing them, to give
place to the well-known maxim: 'When a man leaves his mistress, he
runs the risk of being betrayed two or three times daily.' The
young peasant saw no obstacle between himself and the most heroic
actions, save want of opportunity.</p>

<p>But black night had succeeded the day, and he had still two
leagues to cover before coming down to the hamlet in which Fouque
lived. Before leaving the little cave, Julien struck a light and
carefully destroyed all that he had written.</p>

<p>He greatly astonished his friend by knocking at his door at one
o'clock in the morning. He found Fouque engaged in making up his
accounts. He was a young man of tall stature, none too well made,
with large, hard features, a huge nose, and plenty of good nature
concealed beneath this repellent aspect.</p>

<p>'You've quarrelled with your M. de Rênal, then, that you come
here of a sudden like this?'</p>

<p>Julien related to him, with suitable omissions, the events of
the previous evening.</p>

<p>'Stay with me,' Fouque said to him; 'I see that you know M. de
Rênal, M. Valenod, the Sub-Prefect Maugiron, the curé Chélan; you
have grasped all the subtle points of their natures; you're ripe
now to put yourself up for auction. You know arithmetic better than
I do, you shall keep my books; I am making a big profit from my
business. The impossibility of doing everything by myself and the
fear of hitting upon a rogue in the man I might take as my partner
prevent me every day from doing the most profitable deals. Not a
month ago I put six thousand francs in the pocket of Michaud of
Saint-Amand, whom I had not seen for six years, and met quite by
chance at the Pontarlier sale. Why should not you have made those
six thousand francs yourself, or three thousand at least? For if I
had had you with me that day, I should have gone on bidding for
that lot of timber, and the other would soon have left me with it.
Be my partner.'</p>

<p>This offer annoyed Julien; it unsettled his erratic mind;
throughout supper, which the friends cooked for themselves, like
Homeric heroes, for Fouque lived by himself, he showed Julien his
books, and proved to him what advantages his trade in timber
offered. Fouque had the highest opinion of Julien's intelligence
and character.</p>

<p>When at length the latter found himself alone in his little room
walled with planks of firwood, 'It is true,' he said to himself, 'I
can make a few thousand francs here, then return with advantage to
the calling of soldier or priest, according to the fashion
prevailing in France at the time. The little hoard that I shall
have amassed will remove all difficulties of detail. Alone on this
mountainside, I can do something to dispel my present appalling
ignorance of so many of the things that occupy the minds of all
these fashionable gentlemen. But Fouque is giving up the thought of
marriage, he has told me again and again that solitude is making
him melancholy. It is obvious that if he is taking a partner who
has no money to put into his business, it is in the hope of
providing himself with a companion who will never leave him.</p>

<p>'Shall I prove false to my friend?' exclaimed Julien angrily.
This creature, for whom hypocrisy and the absence of all fellow
feeling were the ordinary line of conduct, could not on this
occasion bear the thought of the slightest want of delicacy towards
a man who loved him.</p>

<p>But all at once Julien became happy, he had a reason for
refusing. 'What, I should be idly wasting seven or eight years! I
should thus arrive at eight and twenty; but, at that age, Napoleon
had already done his greatest deeds! After I have obscurély scraped
together a little money by going round all these timber sales, and
winning the favour of various minor rascals, who can say whether I
shall still preserve the sacred fire with which one makes oneself a
name?'</p>

<p>The following morning, Julien replied with great coolness to the
worthy Fouque, who looked upon the matter of their partnership as
settled, that his vocation to the sacred ministry of the altar did
not allow him to accept. Fouque could not believe his ears.</p>

<p>'But do you realise,' he kept on saying, 'that I make you my
partner, or, if you prefer, give you four thousand francs a year?
And you want to go back to your M. de Rênal, who despises you like
the mud on his shoes! When you have two hundred louis in hand, what
is to prevent you from entering the Seminary? I will say more, I
undertake to procuré for you the best parish in the district. For,'
Fouque went on, lowering his voice, 'I supply firewood to the
&mdash;&mdash;, and the &mdash;&mdash;, and M. &mdash;&mdash;. I
give them the best quality of oak, for which they pay me the price
of white wood, but never was money better invested.'</p>

<p>Nothing could prevail against Julien's vocation. In the end
Fouque decided that he must be slightly mad. On the third day, at
dawn, Julien left his friend to pass the day among the rocks of the
big mountain. He found his little cave again, but he no longer
enjoyed peace of mind, his friend's offers had destroyed it. Like
Hercules he found himself called upon to choose not between vice
and virtue, but between mediocrity ending in an assured comfort and
all the heroic dreams of his youth. 'So I have no real firmness of
character,' he told himself; and this was the doubt that pained him
most. 'I am not of the stuff of which great men are made, since I
am afraid that eight years spent in providing myself with bread may
rob me of that sublime energy which makes men do extraordinary
things.'</p>

<h2><a name="ch13" id="ch13"></a>Chapter 13. Open-work
Stockings</h2>

<p style="margin-left:10%">A novel is a mirror taken along a
road.<br>
&mdash;SAINT-REAL</p>

<p>When Julien caught sight of the picturesque ruins of the old
church of Vergy, it occurred to him that for two whole days he had
not once thought of Madame de Rênal. The other day, as I was
leaving, that woman reminded me of the vast gulf that separates us,
she treated me like a workman's son. No doubt she wished to show me
that she repented of having let me hold her hand the night
before...It is a lovely hand, all the same! What charm, what
nobility dwells in that woman's glance!'</p>

<p>The possibility of making a fortune with Fouque gave a certain
facility to the course of Julien's reasoning; it was less often
interrupted by irritation, and the keen sense of his own poverty
and humble position in the eyes of the world. As though perched on
a lofty promontory, he was able to judge, and, so to speak,
overlooked extreme poverty on the one hand and that life of comfort
which he still called riches on the other. He was far from
considering his position like a philosopher, but he had sufficient
perception to feel that he was <i>different</i> after this little
expedition among the mountains.</p>

<p>He was struck by the extreme uneasiness with which Madame de
Rênal listened to the short account of his journey, for which she
had asked him.</p>

<p>Fouque had had thoughts of marriage, unhappy love affairs; the
conversation between the friends had been filled with long
confidences of this nature. After finding happiness too soon,
Fouque had discovered that he was not the sole possessor of his
mistress's heart. These disclosures had astonished Julien; he had
learned much that was new to him. His solitary life, compounded of
imagination and suspicion, had kept him aloof from everything that
could have enlightened him.</p>

<p>During his absence, life had been for Madame de Rênal nothing
more than a succession of torments, each different but all alike
intolerable; she was really ill.</p>

<p>'You must not, on any account,' Madame Derville told her when
she saw Julien return, 'feeling as you do, sit in the garden this
evening, the damp air would make you worse.'</p>

<p>Madame Derville was surprised to see that her friend, who was
always being scolded by M. de Rênal for the undue simplicity of her
attire, had put on open-work stockings and a pair of charming
little shoes that had arrived from Paris. For the last three days
Madame de Rênal's sole distraction had been to cut out and make
Elisa put together in all haste a summer gown, of a charming little
fabric greatly in fashion. It was just possible to finish this gown
a few minutes after Julien's arrival; Madame de Rênal at once put
it on. Her friend had no longer any doubt.</p>

<p>'She is in love, poor woman!' Madame Derville said to herself.
She understood all the strange symptoms of her illness.</p>

<p>She saw her speak to Julien. Pallor took the place of the most
vivid blushes. Anxiety stood revealed in her eyes, fastened on
those of the young tutor. Madame de Rênal expected every moment
that he was going to offer an explanation, and announce that he was
leaving the house, or would remain. It never occurred to Julien to
say anything about this subject, which had not entered his
thoughts. After a terrible struggle, Madame de Rênal at last
ventured to say to him, in a tremulous voice, in which the whole
extent of her passion lay revealed:</p>

<p>'Are you going to leave your pupils to take a post
elsewhere?'</p>

<p>Julien was struck by her quavering voice and by the look in her
eyes. 'This woman loves me,' he said to himself; 'but after this
passing weakness for which her pride is reproaching her, and as
soon as she is no longer afraid of my going, she will return to her
arrogance.' This glimpse of their respective positions came to
Julien like a flash of lightning; he replied, hesitatingly:</p>

<p>'I should greatly regret leaving such attractive and
<i>well-born</i> children, but perhaps it will be inevitable. A man
has duties towards himself also.'</p>

<p>As he uttered the words well born (this was one of the
aristocratic expressions which Julien had recently acquired), he
burned with a strong feeling of antipathy.</p>

<p>'To this woman,' he said to himself, 'I am not well born.'</p>

<p>Madame de Rênal, as she listened to him, was admiring his
intelligence, his beauty, her heart was pierced by the possibility
of departure which he dangled before her. All her friends from
Verrières who, during Julien's absence, had come out to dine at
Vergy, had almost vied in complimenting her upon the astonishing
young man that her husband had had the good fortune to unearth.
This was not to say that they understood anything of the progress
that the children had made. The fact of his knowing the Bible by
heart, and in Latin, too, had provoked in the inhabitants of
Verrières an admiration that will endure for, it may be, a
century.</p>

<p>Julien, who spoke to no one, knew nothing of all this. If Madame
de Rênal had had the slightest self-control, she would have
congratulated him on the reputation he had won, and Julien, his
pride set at rest, would have been pleasant and affable to her, all
the more as her new gown seemed to him charming. Madame de Rênal,
also pleased with her pretty gown, and with what Julien said to her
about it, had proposed a turn in the garden; soon she had confessed
that she was not well enough to walk. She had taken the returned
traveller's arm, and, far from restoring her strength, the contact
of that arm deprived her of what little strength remained to
her.</p>

<p>It was dark; no sooner were they seated than Julien, relying on
the privilege he had already won, ventured to press his lips to the
arm of his pretty neighbour, and to take her hand. He was thinking
of the boldness which Fouque had used with his mistresses, and not
of Madame de Rênal; the phrase <i>well born</i> still weighed upon
his heart. His own hand was pressed, but this afforded him no
pleasure. Far from his being proud, or even grateful for the
affection which Madame de Rênal betrayed this evening by
unmistakable signs, beauty, elegance, freshness found him almost
unconscious of their appeal. Purity of heart, freedom from any
feeling of hatred, serve doubtless to prolong the duration of
youth. It is the face that ages first in the majority of beautiful
women.</p>

<p>Julien was sullen all the evening; hitherto he had been angry
only with fortune and with society; now that Fouque had offered him
an ignoble way of arriving at comfort, he was angry with himself.
Absorbed in his own thoughts, although now and then he addressed a
few words to the ladies, Julien ended by unconsciously letting go
Madame de Rênal's hand. This action completely nonplussed the poor
woman; she saw in it an indication of her fate.</p>

<p>Had she been certain of Julien's affection, her virtue might
perhaps have found strength to resist him. Trembling at the thought
of losing him for ever, her passion carried her to the point of
seizing Julien's hand, which, in his distraction, he had allowed to
rest upon the back of a chair. This action stirred the ambitious
youth; he would have liked it to be witnessed by all those proud
nobles who, at table, when he was at the lower end with the
children, used to look at him with so patronising a smile. 'This
woman cannot despise me any longer: in that case,' he said to
himself, 'I ought to be stirred by her beauty; I owe it to myself
to be her lover.' Such an idea would never have occurred to him
before he received the artless confidences of his friend.</p>

<p>The sudden resolution he had just made formed a pleasing
distraction. He said to himself: 'I must have one of these two
women'; he realised that he would greatly have preferred to pay his
court to Madame Derville; it was not that she was more attractive,
but she had seen him always as a tutor honoured for his learning,
and not as a working carpenter, with a ratteen jacket folded under
his arm, as he had first appeared to Madame de Rênal.</p>

<p>It was precisely as a young workman, blushing to the whites of
his eyes, hesitating outside the door of the house and not
venturing to ring the bell, that Madame de Rênal delighted most to
picture him.</p>

<p>As he followed up this survey of his position, Julien saw that
he must not think of attempting the conquest of Madame Derville,
who had probably noticed the weakness that Madame de Rênal showed
for him. Forced to return to the latter: 'What do I know of this
woman's character?' Julien asked himself. 'Only this: before I went
away, I took her hand, she withdrew it; today I withdraw my hand,
she seizes it and presses it. A good opportunity to repay her all
the contempt she has shown for me. God knows how many lovers she
has had! Perhaps she is deciding in my favour only because of the
facilities for our meeting.'</p>

<p>Such is, alas, the drawback of an excessive civilisation. At the
age of twenty, the heart of a young man, if he has any education,
is a thousand leagues from that devil-may-care attitude without
which love is often only the most tedious duty.</p>

<p>'I owe it to myself all the more,' went on Julien's petty
vanity, 'to succeed with this woman, so that if I ever make my
fortune, and someone reproaches me with having filled the humble
post of tutor, I may let it be understood that it was love that
brought me into that position.'</p>

<p>Julien once more withdrew his hand from that of Madame de Rênal,
then took her hand again and pressed it. As they returned to the
drawing-room, towards midnight, Madame de Rênal murmured in his
ear:</p>

<p>'Are you leaving us, are you going away?'</p>

<p>Julien answered with a sigh:</p>

<p>'I must indeed go away, for I love you passionately; it is a
sin...and what a sin for a young priest!'</p>

<p>Madame de Rênal leaned upon his arm, bending towards him until
her cheek felt the warmth of his.</p>

<p>The night passed for these two people very differently. Madame
de Rênal was exalted by transports of the most lofty moral
pleasure. A coquettish girl who falls in love early grows
accustomed to the distress of love; when she comes to the age of
true passion, the charm of novelty is lacking. As Madame de Rênal
had never read any novels, all the refinements of her happiness
were new to her. No melancholy truth came to freeze her heart, not
even the spectre of the future. She saw herself as happy in ten
years' time as she was at that moment. Even the thought of virtue
and of the fidelity she had vowed to M. de Rênal, which had
distressed her some days before, presented itself in vain, she
dismissed it like an importunate stranger. 'Never will I allow
Julien to take any liberty,' Madame de Rênal told herself, 'we
shall live in future as we have been living for the last month. He
shall be a friend.'</p>

Scissors</h2>

<p style="margin-left:10%">A girl of sixteen had a rosy
complexion,<br>
and put on rouge.<br>
&mdash;POLIDORI</p>

<p>As for Julien, Fouque's offer had indeed destroyed all his
happiness; he could not decide upon any course.</p>

<p>'Alas! Perhaps I am wanting in character, I should have made
Napoleon a bad soldier. Anyhow,' he went on, 'my little intrigue
with the lady of the house is going to distract me for the
moment.'</p>

<p>Fortunately for him, even in this minor incident, his inward
feelings bore no relation to his cavalier language. He was afraid
of Madame de Rênal because of her pretty gown. This gown was in his
eyes the advance guard of Paris. His pride was determined to leave
nothing to chance and to the inspiration of the moment. Drawing
upon Fouque's confessions and the little he had read about love in
the Bible, he prepared a plan of campaign in great detail. Since,
though he did not admit it to himself, he was extremely anxious, he
committed this plan to writing.</p>

<p>The following morning, in the drawing-room, Madame de Rênal was
alone with him for a moment.</p>

<p>'Have you no other name besides Julien?' she asked him.</p>

<p>Our hero did not know what answer to give to so flattering a
question. No provision had been made in his plan for such an event.
But for the stupid mistake of making a plan, Julien's quick mind
would soon have come to his rescue, his surprise would only have
added to the keenness of his perceptions.</p>

<p>He was awkward and exaggerated his own awkwardness. Madame de
Rênal soon forgave him that. She saw in it the effect of a charming
candour. And the one thing lacking, to her mind, in this man, who
was considered so brilliant, was an air of candour.</p>

<p>'I don't at all trust your little tutor,' Madame Derville said
to her on several occasions. 'He seems to me to be always thinking
and to act only from motives of policy. He's crafty.'</p>

<p>Julien remained deeply humiliated by the disaster of not having
known what answer to make to Madame de Rênal.</p>

<p>'A man of my sort owes it to himself to make up for this check';
and, seizing the moment at which she passed from one room to
another, he did what he considered his duty by giving Madame de
Rênal a kiss.</p>

<p>Nothing could have been less appropriate, less agreeable either
to himself or to her, nor could anything have been more imprudent.
They barely escaped being caught. Madame de Rênal thought him mad.
She was frightened and even more shocked. This stupidity reminded
her of M. Valenod.</p>

<p>'What would happen to me,' she asked herself, 'if I were left
alone with him?' All her virtue returned, for her love was in
eclipse.</p>

<p>She arranged matters so that there should always be one of her
children with her.</p>

<p>The day passed slowly for Julien, he spent the whole of it in
clumsily carrying out his plan of seduction. He never once looked
at Madame de Rênal without embodying a question in his look; he was
not, however, such a fool as not to see that he was failing
completely to be agreeable, let alone seductive.</p>

<p>Madame de Rênal could not get over her astonishment at finding
him so awkward and at the same time so bold. 'It is the timidity of
love in a man of parts!' she said to herself at length, with an
inexpressible joy. 'Can it be possible that he has never been loved
by my rival!'</p>

<p>After luncheon, Madame de Rênal returned to the drawing-room to
entertain M. Charcot de Maugiron, the Sub-Prefect of Bray. She was
working at a little tapestry frame on a tall stand. Madame Derville
was by her side. It was in this position, and in the full light of
day, that our hero thought fit to thrust forward his boot and press
the pretty foot of Madame de Rênal, whose open-work stocking and
smart Parisian shoe were evidently attracting the gaze of the
gallant Sub-Prefect.</p>

<p>Madame de Rênal was extremely alarmed; she let fall her
scissors, her ball of wool, her needles, and Julien's movement
could thus pass for a clumsy attempt to prevent the fall of the
scissors, which he had seen slipping down. Fortunately these little
scissors of English steel broke, and Madame de Rênal could not
sufficiently express her regret that Julien had not been nearer at
hand.</p>

<p>'You saw them falling before I did, you might have caught them;
your zeal has only succeeded in giving me a violent kick.'</p>

<p>All this play-acting took in the Sub-Prefect, but not Madame
Derville. 'This pretty youth has very bad manners!' she thought;
the worldly-wisdom of a provincial capital can never pardon
mistakes of this sort. Madame de Rênal found an opportunity of
saying to Julien:</p>

<p>'Be careful, I order you.'</p>

<p>Julien realised his own clumsiness, and was annoyed. For a long
time he debated within himself whether he ought to take offence at
the words: 'I order you.' He was foolish enough to think: 'She
might say to me "I order you" if it was something to do with the
children's education; but in responding to my love, she assumes
equality. One cannot love without equality'; and he lost himself in
composing commonplaces on the subject of equality. He repeated
angrily to himself the verse of Corneille which Madame Derville had
taught him a few days earlier:</p>

<p>Love creates equalities, it does not seek them.</p>

<p>Julien, insisting upon playing the part of a Don Juan, he who
had never had a mistress in his life, was deadly dull for the rest
of the day. He had only one sensible idea; bored with himself and
with Madame de Rênal, he saw with alarm the evening approach when
he would be seated in the garden, by her side and in the dark. He
told M. de Rênal that he was going to Verrières to see the curé; he
set off after dinner, and did not return until late at night.</p>

<p>At Verrières, Julien found M. Chélan engaged in packing up; he
had at last been deprived of his benefice; the vicar Maslon was to
succeed him. Julien helped the good curé, and it occurred to him to
write to Fouque that the irresistible vocation which he felt for
the sacred ministry had prevented him at first from accepting his
friend's obliging offer, but that he had just witnessed such an
example of injustice, that perhaps it would be more advantageous to
his welfare were he not to take holy orders.</p>

<p>Julien applauded his own deftness in making use of the
deprivation of the curé of Verrières to leave a door open for
himself and so return to commerce, should the sad voice of prudence
prevail, in his mind, over heroism.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch15" id="ch15"></a>Chapter 15. Cock-crow</h2>

<p style="margin-left:10%">Amour en latin faict amor;<br>
Or done provient d'amour la mort,<br>
Et, par avant, soulcy qui mord,<br>
Deuil, plours, pieges, forfaitz, remord...<br>
&mdash;<i>Blason d'amour</i></p>

<p>If Julien had had a little of that discernment which he so
gratuitously supposed himself to possess, he might have
congratulated himself next day on the effect produced by his visit
to Verrières. His absence had caused his clumsiness to be
forgotten. All that day too, he was inclined to sulk; towards
nightfall a preposterous idea occurred to him, and he imparted it
to Madame de Rênal with a rare intrepidity.</p>

<p>No sooner had they sat down in the garden than, without waiting
for a sufficient cloak of darkness, Julien put his lips to Madame
de Rênal's ear, and, at the risk of compromising her horribly, said
to her:</p>

<p>'Tonight, Ma'am, at two o'clock, I am coming to your room, I
have something to say to you.'</p>

<p>Julien was trembling lest his request should be granted; the
part of a seducer was so horrible a burden that if he had been free
to follow his own inclination, he would have retired to his room
for some days, and not set eyes on the ladies again. He realised
that, by his clever tactics of yesterday, he had squandered all the
promise of the day before, and really he did not know where to
turn.</p>

<p>Madame de Rênal replied with a genuine and by no means
exaggerated indignation to the impertinent announcement which
Julien had had the audacity to make. He thought he could read scorn
in her brief answer. It was certain that in this answer, uttered in
the lowest of tones, the word 'Fie!' had figured. Making the excuse
that he had something to say to the children, Julien went up to
their room, and on his return placed himself by the side of Madame
Derville and at a distance from Madame de Rênal. He thus removed
from himself all possibility of taking her hand. The conversation
took a serious turn, and Julien held his own admirably, apart from
a few intervals of silence during which he cudgelled his brains.
'Why cannot I think of some fine plan,' he asked himself, 'to force
Madame de Rênal to show me those unmistakable marks of affection
which made me imagine, three days ago, that she was mine!'</p>

<p>Julien was extremely disconcerted by the almost desperate
situation into which he had been led. And yet nothing could have
embarrassed him so much as success.</p>

<p>When the party broke up at midnight, his pessimism led him to
believe that Madame Derville looked upon him with contempt, and
that probably he stood no higher in the favour of Madame de
Rênal.</p>

<p>Being in an extremely bad temper and deeply humiliated, Julien
could not sleep. He was a thousand leagues from any thought of
abandoning all pretence, all his plans, and of living from day to
day with Madame de Rênal, contenting himself like a child with the
happiness that each day would bring.</p>

<p>He wearied his brain in devising clever stratagems; a moment
later, he felt them to be absurd; he was in short extremely
wretched, when two struck from the clock tower.</p>

<p>This sound aroused him as the crow of the cock aroused Saint
Peter. He saw himself arrived at the moment of the most distressing
event. He had not thought once again of his impertinent suggestion,
from the moment in which he had made it. It had met with so hostile
a reception!</p>

<p>'I told her that I should come to her at two o'clock,' he said
to himself as he rose; 'I may be inexperienced and coarse, as is
natural in the son of a peasant, Madame Derville has let me see
that plainly enough; but at any rate I will not be weak.'</p>

<p>Julien had every right to praise his own courage, never had he
set himself a more painful task. As he opened the door of his room,
he trembled so much that his knees gave way beneath him, and he was
obliged to lean against the wall.</p>

<p>He was in his stockinged feet. He went to listen at M. de
Rênal's door, through which he could hear him snoring. This
dismayed him. He had no longer any excuse for not going to her.
But, great God! What should he do when he got there? He had no
plan, and even if he had had one, he was in such distress of mind
that he would not have been in a fit state to put it into
practice.</p>

<p>Finally, with an anguish a thousand times keener than if he had
been going to the scaffold, he entered the little corridor that led
to Madame de Rênal's room. He opened the door with a trembling
hand, making a fearful noise as he did so.</p>

<p>There was a light in the room, a night light was burning in the
fireplace; he had not expected this fresh calamity. Seeing him
enter, Madame de Rênal sprang quickly out of bed. 'Wretch!' she
cried. There was some confusion. Julien forgot his futile plans and
returned to his own natural character. Not to please so charming a
woman seemed to him the greatest disaster possible. His only answer
to her reproaches was to fling himself at her feet, clasping her
round the knees. As she spoke to him with extreme harshness, he
burst into tears.</p>

<p>Some hours later, when Julien emerged from Madame de Rênal's
room, one might have said, in the language of romance, that there
was nothing more left for him to wish. And indeed, he was indebted
to the love he had inspired and to the unforeseen impression made
on him by her seductive charms for a victory to which not all his
misplaced ingenuity would ever have led him.</p>

<p>But, in the most delicious moments, the victim of a freakish
pride, he still attempted to play the part of a man in the habit of
captivating women: he made incredible efforts to destroy his
natural amiability. Instead of his paying attention to the
transports which he excited, and to the remorse that increased
their vivacity, the idea of duty was continually before his eyes.
He feared a terrible remorse, and undying ridicule, should he
depart from the ideal plan that he had set himself to follow. In a
word, what made Julien a superior being was precisely what
prevented him from enjoying the happiness that sprang up at his
feet. He was like a girl of sixteen who has a charming complexion
and, before going to a ball, is foolish enough to put on rouge.</p>

<p>In mortal terror at the apparition of Julien, Madame de Rênal
was soon a prey to the cruellest alarms. Julien's tears and despair
distressed her greatly.</p>

<p>Indeed, when she had no longer anything to refuse him, she
thrust him from her, with genuine indignation, and then flung
herself into his arms. No purpose was apparent in all this
behaviour. She thought herself damned without remission, and sought
to shut out the vision of hell by showering the most passionate
caresses on Julien. In a word, nothing would have been wanting to
complete our hero's happiness, not even a burning sensibility in
the woman he had just vanquished, had he been capable of enjoying
it. Julien's departure brought no cessation of the transports which
were shaking her in spite of herself, nor of her struggle with the
remorse that was tearing her.</p>

<p>'Heavens! Is to be happy, to be loved, no more than that?' Such
was Julien's first thought on his return to his own room. He was in
that state of astonishment and uneasy misgivings into which a heart
falls when it has just obtained what it has long desired. It has
grown used to desiring, finds nothing left to desire, and has not
yet acquired any memories. Like a soldier returning from a parade,
Julien was busily engaged in reviewing all the details of his
conduct. 'Have I failed in one of the duties I owe to myself? Have
I really played my part?'</p>

<p>And what a part! The part of a man accustomed to shine before
women.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch16" id="ch16"></a>Chapter 16. The Day After</h2>

<p style="margin-left:10%">He turn'd his lips to hers, and with his
hand<br>
Call'd back the tangles of her wandering hair.<br>
&mdash;<i>Don Juan</i>, I. 170</p>

<p>Fortunately for Julien's pride, Madame de Rênal had been too
greatly agitated and surprised to notice the fatuity of the man who
in a moment had become everything in the world to her.</p>

<p>As she was imploring him to withdraw, seeing the day begin to
break:</p>

<p>'Oh, Heavens!' she said, 'if my husband has heard any sound, I
am lost.'</p>

<p>Julien, who had leisure for composing phrases, remembered one to
the point:</p>

<p>'Should you regret your life?'</p>

<p>'Ah! Very much at this moment, but I should not regret having
known you.'</p>

<p>Julien found that his dignity required him to return to his room
in broad daylight and with deliberate want of precaution.</p>

<p>The continuous attention with which he watched his own slightest
actions, in the insane idea of being taken for a man of experience,
had this one advantage; when he saw Madame de Rênal again, at
luncheon, his behaviour was a miracle of prudence.</p>

<p>As for her, she could not look at him without blushing to the
whites of her eyes, and could not live for an instant without
looking at him; she noticed her own confusion, and her efforts to
conceal it increased. Julien raised his eyes to hers once only. At
first, Madame de Rênal admired his prudence. Presently, seeing that
this solitary glance was not repeated, she took alarm: 'Can it be
that he does not love me any more,' she asked herself; 'alas, I am
far too old for him; I am ten years his senior.'</p>

<p>On the way from the dining-room to the garden, she pressed
Julien's hand. In the surprise that he felt at so extraordinary a
token of affection, he gazed at her with passion; for she had
struck him as looking very pretty at luncheon, and, without raising
his eyes, he had spent his time making a detailed catalogue of her
charms. This look consoled Madame de Rênal; it did not remove all
her uneasiness; but her uneasiness removed, almost entirely, the
remorse she felt when she thought of her husband.</p>

<p>At luncheon, the said husband had noticed nothing; not so with
Madame Derville; she feared Madame de Rênal to be on the point of
succumbing. All through the day, her bold, incisive friendship did
not spare the other those hinted suggestions intended to portray in
hideous colours the danger that she was running.</p>

<p>Madame de Rênal was burning to be left alone with Julien; she
wanted to ask him whether he still loved her. Despite the
unalterable gentleness of her nature, she was more than once on the
point of letting her friend know what a nuisance she was making of
herself.</p>

<p>That evening, in the garden, Madame Derville arranged things so
skilfully that she found herself placed between Madame de Rênal and
Julien. Madame de Rênal, who had formed a delicious image of the
pleasure of pressing Julien's hand and carrying it to her lips,
could not so much as address a word to him.</p>

<p>This catastrophe increased her agitation. Remorse for one thing
was gnawing her. She had so scolded Julien for the imprudence he
had shown in coming to her room the night before, that she trembled
lest he might not come that night. She left the garden early, and
went up to wait in her room. But, beside herself with impatience,
she rose and went to glue her ear to Julien's door. Despite the
uncertainty and passion that were devouring her, she did not dare
enter. This action seemed to her the last word in lowness, for it
serves as text to a country maxim.</p>

<p>The servants were not all in bed. Prudence obliged her finally
to return to her own room. Two hours of waiting were two centuries
of torment.</p>

<p>But Julien was too loyal to what he called his duty, to fail in
the execution, detail by detail, of what he had laid down for
himself.</p>

<p>As one o'clock struck, he slipped quietly from his room, made
sure that the master of the house was sound asleep, and appeared
before Madame de Rênal. On this occasion he found greater happiness
with his mistress, for he was less continually thinking of the part
he had to play. He had eyes to see and ears to hear. What Madame de
Rênal said to him about his age contributed to give him some degree
of self-assurance.</p>

<p>'Alas! I am ten years older than you! How can you love me?' she
repeated without any object, simply because the idea oppressed
her.</p>

<p>Julien could not conceive such a thing, but he saw that her
distress was genuine, and almost entirely forgot his fear of being
ridiculous.</p>

<p>The foolish idea of his being regarded as a servile lover, at
his mistress's beck and call, on account of his humble birth,
vanished likewise. In proportion as Julien's transports reassured
his coy mistress, she recovered some degree of happiness and the
faculty of criticising her lover. Fortunately, he showed almost
nothing, on this occasion, of that borrowed air which had made
their meeting the night before a victory, but not a pleasure. Had
she noticed his intentness upon playing a part, the painful
discovery would have robbed her of all happiness for ever. She
could have seen in it nothing else than a painful consequence of
their disparity of age.</p>

<p>Albeit Madame de Rênal had never thought about theories of love,
difference of age is, next to difference of fortune, one of the
great commonplaces of provincial humour, whenever there is any talk
of love.</p>

<p>In a few days, Julien, all the ardour of his youth restored, was
madly in love.</p>

<p>'One must admit,' he said to himself, 'that her kindness of
heart is angelic, and that no one could be prettier.'</p>

<p>He had almost entirely lost the idea of a part to be played. In
a moment of unrestrained impulse, he even confessed to her all his
anxieties. This confidence raised to its climax the passion that he
inspired. 'So I have not had any fortunate rival,' Madame de Rênal
said to herself with ecstasy. She ventured to question him as to
the portrait in which he took such an interest; Julien swore to her
that it was that of a man.</p>

<p>When Madame de Rênal was calm enough to reflect, she could not
get over her astonishment that such happiness could exist and that
she had never had the slightest idea of it.</p>

<p>'Ah!' she said to herself, 'if I had known Julien ten years ago,
when I might still be considered pretty!'</p>

<p>Julien's thoughts were worlds apart from these. His love was
still founded in ambition: it was the joy of possessing&mdash;he, a poor
creature so unfortunate and so despised&mdash;so noble and beautiful a
woman. His acts of adoration, his transports at the sight of his
mistress's charms, ended by reassuring her somewhat as to the
difference in age. Had she possessed a little of that worldly
wisdom a woman of thirty has long enjoyed in more civilised lands,
she would have shuddered for the continuance of a love which seemed
to exist only upon surprise and the titillation of self-esteem.</p>

<p>In the moments when he forgot his ambition, Julien went into
transports over everything that Madame de Rênal possessed,
including her hats and gowns. He could not tire of the pleasure of
inhaling their perfume. He opened her wardrobe and stood for hours
on end marvelling at the beauty and neat arrangement of everything
inside. His mistress, leaning upon his shoulder, gazed at him; he
himself gazed at those ornaments and fripperies which on a wedding
day are displayed among the presents.</p>

<p>'I might have married a man like this!' Madame de Rênal
sometimes thought; 'What a fiery spirit! What a rapturous life with
him!'</p>

<p>As for Julien, never had he found himself so close to those
terrible weapons of feminine artillery. 'It is impossible,' he told
himself, 'that in Paris there can be anything finer!' After which
he could find no objection to his happiness. Often his mistress's
sincere admiration, and her transports of passion made him forget
the fatuous theory that had kept him so restrained and almost
ridiculous in the first moments of their intimacy. There were
moments when, despite his hypocritical habits, he found an intense
pleasure in confessing to this great lady who admired him his
ignorance of any number of little usages. His mistress's rank
seemed to raise him above himself. Madame de Rênal, for her part,
found the most exquisite moral satisfaction in thus instructing in
a heap of little things this young man endowed with genius whom
everyone regarded as bound one day to go so far. Even the
Sub-Prefect and M. Valenod could not help admiring him: she thought
the better of them accordingly. As for Madame Derville, these were
by no means her sentiments. In despair at what she thought she
could discern, and seeing that her wise counsel was becoming
hateful to a woman who had positively lost her head, she left Vergy
without offering an explanation for which she was not asked. Madame
de Rênal shed a few tears at her departure, and soon it seemed to
her that her happiness was doubled. By the withdrawal of her guest
she found herself left alone with her lover almost all day
long.</p>

<p>Julien gave himself all the more readily to the pleasant society
of his mistress inasmuch as, whenever he was left too long by
himself, Fouque's fatal offer recurred to his mind to worry him. In
the first days of this new life, there were moments when he, who
had never loved, who had never been loved by anyone, found so
exquisite a pleasure in being sincere, that he was on the point of
confessing to Madame de Rênal the ambition which until then had
been the very essence of his existence. He would have liked to be
able to consult her as to the strange temptation which he felt in
Fouque's offer, but a trifling occurrence put a stop to all
frankness.</p>

<h2><a name="ch17" id="ch17"></a>Chapter 17. The Principal
Deputy</h2>

<p style="margin-left:10%">O! how this spring of love
resembleth<br>
The uncertain glory of an April day,<br>
Which now shows all the beauty of the sun,<br>
And by and by a cloud takes all away!<br>
&mdash;<i>The Two Gentlemen of Verona</i></p>

<p>One evening as the sun set, sitting by his mistress, at the end
of the orchard, safe from disturbance, he was deep in thought.
'Will such delicious moments,' he was wondering, 'last for ever?'
His thoughts were absorbed in the difficulty of adopting a
profession, he was deploring this great and distressing problem
which puts an end to boyhood and spoils the opening years of
manhood when one has no money.</p>

<p>'Ah!' he cried, 'Napoleon was indeed the man sent by God to help
the youth of France! Who is to take his place? What will the poor
wretches do without him, even those who are richer than I, who have
just the few crowns needed to procuré them a good education, and
not enough money to purchase a man at twenty and launch themselves
in a career! Whatever happens,' he added with deep sigh, 'that
fatal memory will for ever prevent us from being happy!'</p>

<p>He saw Madame de Rênal frown suddenly; she assumed a cold,
disdainful air; this line of thought seemed to her worthy of a
servant. Brought up in the idea that she was extremely rich, it
seemed to her a thing to be taken for granted that Julien was also.
She loved him a thousand times more than life itself, and money to
her meant nothing.</p>

<p>Julien was far from guessing what was in her mind. This frown
brought him back to earth. He had presence of mind enough to
arrange his sentence and to make it plain to the noble lady, seated
so close beside him on the bank of verdure, that the words he had
just uttered were some that he had heard during his expedition to
his friend the timber merchant. This was the reasoning of the
impious.</p>

<p>'Very well! Don't mix any more with such people,' said Madame de
Rênal, still preserving a trace of that glacial air which had
suddenly taken the place of an expression of the tenderest
affection.</p>

<p>This frown, or rather his remorse for his imprudence, was the
first check administered to the illusion that was bearing Julien
away. He said to himself: 'She is good and kind, her feeling for me
is strong, but she has been brought up in the enemy's camp. They
are bound to be specially afraid of that class of men of spirit
who, after a good education, have not enough money to enter upon a
career. What would become of these nobles, if it were granted us to
fight them with equal weapons? Myself, for instance, as Mayor of
Verrières, well intentioned, honest as M. de Rênal is at heart, how
I should deal with the vicar, M. Valenod and all their rascalities!
How justice should triumph in Verrières. It is not their talents
that would prove an obstacle. They are endlessly feeling their
way.'</p>

<p>Julien's happiness was, that day, on the point of becoming
permanent. What our hero lacked was the courage to be sincere. He
needed the courage to give battle, but on the spot; Madame de Rênal
had been surprised by his speech, because the men whom she was in
the habit of meeting were always saying that the return of
Robespierre was made possible especially by these young men of the
lower orders, who had been too well educated. Madame de Rênal's
cold manner persisted for some time, and seemed to Julien to be
marked. This was because the fear of having said to him indirectly
something unpleasant followed her repugnance at his unfortunate
speech. This distress was clearly shown on her pure countenance; so
simple when she was happy and away from bores.</p>

<p>Julien no longer dared give himself up freely to his dreams.
More calm and less amorous, he decided that it was imprudent in him
to go to Madame de Rênal in her room. It would be better if she
came to him; if a servant saw her moving about the house, there
would be a score of possible reasons to account for her action.</p>

<p>But this arrangement also had its drawbacks. Julien had received
from Fouque certain books for which he, as a student of divinity,
could never have asked a bookseller. He ventured to open them only
at night. Often he would have been just as well pleased not to be
interrupted by an assignation, the tension of waiting for which,
even before the little scene in the orchard, would have left him
incapable of reading.</p>

<p>He was indebted to Madame de Rênal for an entirely new
understanding of the books he read. He had ventured to ply her with
questions as to all sorts of little things ignorance of which
seriously handicaps the intelligence of a young man born outside
the ranks of society, whatever natural genius one may choose to
attribute to him.</p>

<p>This education in love, given by an extremely ignorant woman,
was a blessing. Julien was at once enabled to see society as it is
today. His mind was not perplexed by accounts of what it was in the
past, two thousand years ago, or sixty years ago merely, in the
days of Voltaire and Louis XV. To his unspeakable joy a cloud
passed from before his eyes; he understood at last the things that
were happening at Verrières.</p>

<p>In the foreground appeared the highly complicated intrigues
woven, for the last two years, round the Prefect at Besançon. They
were supported by letters that came from Paris, and bore all the
most illustrious signatures. It was a question of making M. de
Moirod, the most bigoted man in the place, the Principal instead of
the Second Deputy to the Mayor of Verrières.</p>

<p>His rival was an extremely rich manufacturer, whom it was
absolutely essential to confine to the post of Second Deputy.</p>

<p>Julien at last understood the hints that he had overheard, when
the cream of local society came to dine with M. de Rênal. This
privileged class was greatly taken up with this selection of a
Principal Deputy, of which the rest of the town and especially the
Liberals did not even suspect the possibility. What gave it its
importance was that, as everybody knew, the eastern side of the
main street of Verrières must be moved back more than nine feet,
for this street was now a royal highway.</p>

<p>Well, if M. de Moirod, who owned three houses that would have to
be moved back, succeeded in becoming Principal Deputy, and so Mayor
in the event of M. de Rênal's being returned to Parliament, he
would shut his eyes, and it would be possible to make little,
imperceptible repairs to the houses that encroached on the public
thoroughfare, as a result of which they would be good for a hundred
years. Despite the great piety and admitted probity of M. de
Moirod, it was certain that he <i>could be managed</i>, for he had
a large family. Among the houses that would have to be moved back,
nine belonged to the very best people in Verrières.</p>

<p>In Julien's eyes, this intrigue was far more important than the
history of the battle of Fontenoy, a name which he saw for the
first time in one of the books that Fouque had sent him. Many
things had astonished Julien during the five years since he had
begun to spend his evenings with the curé. But discretion and a
humble spirit being the chief qualities required in a divinity
student, it had always been impossible for him to ask any
questions.</p>

<p>One day, Madame de Rênal had given an order to her husband's
valet, Julien's enemy.</p>

<p>'But, Ma'am, today is the last Friday of the month,' the man
answered her with a curious expression.</p>

<p>'Go,' said Madame de Rênal.</p>

<p>'Well,' said Julien, 'he is going to that hay store, which used
to be a church, and was recently restored to the faith; but why?
That is one of the mysteries which I have never been able to
penetrate.'</p>

<p>'It is a most beneficial, but a very strange institution,'
replied Madame de Rênal. 'Women are not admitted; all that I know
of it is that they all address one another as <i>tu</i>. For
instance, this servant will find M. Valenod there, and that
conceited fool will not be in the least annoyed at hearing himself
called <i>tu</i> by Saint-Jean, and will answer him in the same
tone. If you really want to know what they do there, I can ask M.
de Maugiron and M. Valenod for details. We pay twenty francs for
each servant so that they do not cut our throats.'</p>

<p>The time flew. The memory of his mistress's charms distracted
Julien from his black ambition. The necessity to refrain from
speaking to her of serious, reasonable matters, since they were on
opposite sides, added, without his suspecting it, to the happiness
that he owed to her and to the power which she was acquiring over
him.</p>

<p>At those moments when the presence of quick-eared children
confined them to the language of cold reason, it was with a perfect
docility that Julien, gazing at her with eyes that burned with
love, listened to her explanations of the world as it really was.
Often, in the middle of an account of some clever piece of roguery,
in connection with the laying out of a road, or of some astounding
contract, Madame de Rênal's mind would suddenly wander to the point
of delirium; Julien was obliged to scold her, she allowed herself
to caress him in the same way as she caressed her children. This
was because there were days on which she imagined that she loved
him like a child of her own. Had she not to reply incessantly to
his artless questions about a thousand simple matters of which a
child of good family is not ignorant at fifteen? A moment later,
she was admiring him as her master. His intelligence positively
frightened her; she thought she could perceive more clearly every
day the future great man in this young cleric. She saw him as Pope,
she saw him as First Minister, like Richelieu.</p>

<p>'Shall I live long enough to see you in your glory?' she said to
Julien; 'there is a place waiting for a great man; the Monarchy,
the Church need one; these gentlemen say so every day. If some
Richelieu does not stem the torrent of private judgment, all is
lost.'</p>

<p style="margin-left:10%">Are you fit only to be flung down like
the corpse of a nation,<br>
its soul gone and its veins emptied of blood?<br>
&mdash;(From the Bishop's address, delivered in the Chapel of Saint
Clement)</p>

<p>On the third of September, at ten o'clock in the evening, a
mounted constable aroused the whole of Verrières by galloping up
the main street; he brought the news that His Majesty the King of
&mdash; was coming the following Sunday, and it was now Tuesday. The
Prefect authorised, that is to say ordered, the formation of a
Guard of Honour; he must be received with all the pomp possible. A
courier was sent to Vergy. M. de Rênal arrived during the night and
found the whole town in a ferment. Everybody was claiming a right
to something; those who had no other duty were engaging balconies
to see the King enter the town.</p>

<p>Who was to command the Guard of Honour? M. de Rênal saw at once
how important it was, in the interest of the houses that would have
to be moved back, that M. de Moirod should fill this post. It might
be held to constitute a claim to the place of Principal Deputy.
There was nothing to be said against M. de Moirod's devotion; it
went beyond all comparison, but he had never ridden a horse in his
life. He was a man of six and thirty, timid in every way, and
equally afraid of falls and of being laughed at.</p>

<p>The Mayor sent for him at five o'clock in the morning.</p>

<p>'You see, Sir, that I am asking your advice, as though you
already occupied the post in which all right-minded people would
gladly see you. In this unfortunate town the manufacturers prosper,
the Liberal Party are becoming millionaires, they aspire to power,
they will forge themselves weapons out of everything. We must
consider the King's interests, those of the Monarchy, and above all
those of our holy religion. To whom do you think, Sir, that we
ought to entrust the command of the Guard of Honour?'</p>

<p>In spite of the horrible fear that a horse inspired in him, M.
de Moirod ended by accepting this honour like a martyr. 'I shall
manage to adopt the right manner,' he told the Mayor. There was
barely time to overhaul the uniforms which had been used seven
years before on the passage of a Prince of the Blood.</p>

<p>At seven, Madame de Rênal arrived from Vergy with Julien and the
children. She found her drawing-room full of Liberal ladies who
were preaching the union of parties, and had come to implore her to
make her husband find room in the Guard of Honour for theirs. One
of them asserted that if her husband were not chosen he would go
bankrupt from grief. Madame de Rênal sent them all packing at once.
She seemed greatly occupied.</p>

<p>Julien was surprised and even more annoyed by her making a
mystery to him of what was disturbing her. 'I thought as much,' he
told himself bitterly, 'her love is eclipsed by the joy of
receiving a King in her house. All this excitement dazzles her. She
will begin to love me again when her brain is no longer troubled by
ideas of caste.'</p>

<p>The surprising thing was that he loved her all the more for
this.</p>

<p>The upholsterers began to invade the whole house, he long
watched in vain for an opportunity of saying a word to her. At
length he found her coming out of his own room, carrying one of his
coats. They were alone. He tried to speak to her. She made off,
declining to listen to him. 'What a fool I am to be in love with a
woman like that, ambition makes her just as stupid as her
husband.'</p>

<p>She was even more so: one of her great wishes, which she had
never confessed to Julien, for fear of shocking him, was to see him
discard, if only for a day, his gloomy black coat. With an
ingenuity truly admirable in so natural a woman, she securéd, first
from M. de Moirod, and then from the Sub-Prefect M. de Maugiron,
that Julien should be appointed to the Guard of Honour in
preference to five or six young men, sons of manufacturers in easy
circumstances, at least two of whom were of an exemplary piety. M.
Valenod, who was reckoning on lending his carriage to the prettiest
women of the town, in order to have his fine Norman horses admired,
agreed to let Julien, the person he hated most, have one of them.
But each of the members of the Guard of Honour possessed or had
borrowed one of those sky-blue coats with a pair of colonel's
epaulettes in silver, which had shone in public seven years before.
Madame de Rênal wanted a new coat, and she had but four days in
which to send to Besançon, and to procuré from there the uniform,
the weapons, the hat, and all the other requisites for a Guard of
Honour. What is rather amusing is that she thought it imprudent to
have Julien's coat made at Verrières. She wished to take him by
surprise, him and the town.</p>

<p>The work of organising the Guard of Honour and popular feeling
finished, the Mayor had next to deal with a great religious
ceremony; the King of &mdash;&mdash; refused to pass through
Verrières without paying a visit to the famous relic of Saint
Clement which is preserved at Bray-le-Haut, a short league from the
town. The clergy must be present in full force, and this was the
most difficult thing to arrange; M. Maslon, the new curé, was
determined, at any price, to keep M. Chélan out. In vain did M. de
Rênal point out to him the imprudence of this action. The Marquis
de La Mole, whose ancestors for so long were Governors of the
Province, had been chosen to accompany the King of &mdash;&mdash;.
He had known the abbe Chélan for thirty years. He would be certain
to inquire for him on arriving at Verrières, and, if he found that
he was in disgrace, was quite capable of going in search of him, to
the little house to which he had retired, accompanied by such of
the procession as were under his orders. What a rebuff that would
be!</p>

<p>'I am dishonoured here and at Besançon,' replied the abbe
Maslon, 'if he appears among my clergy. A Jansenist, great
heavens!'</p>

<p>'Whatever you may say, my dear abbe,' M. de Rênal assured him,
'I shall not expose the municipal government of Verrières to the
risk of an insult from M. de La Mole. You don't know the man, he is
sound enough at court; but here, in the country, he has a
satirical, mocking spirit, and likes nothing so much as to
embarrass people. He is capable, simply for his own amusement, of
covering us with ridicule in the eyes of the Liberals.'</p>

<p>It was not until the night between Saturday and Sunday, after
three days of discussion, that the abbe Maslon's pride gave way
before the Mayor's fear, which had turned to courage. The next
thing was to write a honeyed note to the abbe Chélan, inviting him
to be present at the veneration of the relic at Bray-le-Haut, his
great age and infirmities permitting. M. Chélan asked for and
obtained a letter of invitation for Julien, who was to accompany
him in the capacity of sub-deacon.</p>

<p>Early on Sunday morning, thousands of peasants, arriving from
the neighbouring mountains, flooded the streets of Verrières. It
was a day of brilliant sunshine. At length, about three o'clock, a
tremor ran through the crowd; they had caught sight of a beacon
blazing on a rock two leagues from Verrières. This signal announced
that the King had just entered the territory of the Department.
Immediately the sound of all the bells and the repeated discharge
of an old Spanish cannon belonging to the town proclaimed its joy
at this great event. Half the population climbed up on the roofs.
All the women were on the balconies. The Guard of Honour began to
move. The brilliant uniforms were greatly admired, each of the
onlookers recognised a relative or friend. There was general
laughter at the alarm of M. de Moirod, whose cautious hand lay
ready at any moment to clutch hold of his saddle. But one thing
made them forget all the others: the left-hand man in the ninth
section was a handsome lad, very slender, who at first was not
identified. Presently a cry of indignation from some, the
astonished silence of others announced a general sensation. The
onlookers recognised in this young man, riding one of M. Valenod's
Norman horses, young Sorel, the carpenter's son. There was one
unanimous outcry against the Mayor, especially among the Liberals.
What, because this young labourer dressed up as a priest was tutor
to his brats, he had the audacity to appoint him to the Guard of
Honour, to the exclusion of M. This and M. That, wealthy
manufacturers! 'Those gentlemen,' said a banker's wife, 'ought
really to offer an affront to the little upstart, born in the
gutter.'</p>

<p>'He has a wicked temper and he is wearing a sabre,' replied her
companion; 'he would be quite treacherous enough to slash them
across the face.'</p>

<p>The comments made by the aristocratic element were more
dangerous. The ladies asked themselves whether the Mayor alone was
responsible for this grave breach of etiquette. On the whole
justice was done to his contempt for humble birth.</p>

<p>While he was giving rise to so much comment, Julien was the
happiest man alive. Bold by nature, he had a better seat on a horse
than most of the young men of this mountain town. He saw in the
eyes of the women that they were talking about him.</p>

<p>His epaulettes were more brilliant because they were new. At
every moment his horse threatened to rear; he was in the seventh
heaven of joy.</p>

<p>His happiness knew no bounds when, as they passed near the old
rampart, the sound of the small cannon made his horse swerve out of
the ranks. By the greatest accident, he did not fall off; from that
moment he felt himself a hero. He was Napoleon's orderly officer
and was charging a battery.</p>

<p>There was one person happier than he. First of all she had
watched him pass from one of the windows of the town hall; then,
getting into her carriage, and rapidly making a wide detour, she
was in time to tremble when his horse carried him out of the ranks.
Finally, her carriage passing out at a gallop through another of
the gates of the town, she made her way back to the road along
which the King was to pass, and was able to follow the Guard of
Honour at a distance of twenty paces, in a noble cloud of dust. Ten
thousand peasants shouted: 'Long live the King' when the Mayor had
the honour of addressing His Majesty. An hour later, when, having
listened to all the speeches, the King was about to enter the town,
the small cannon began to fire again with frenzied haste. But an
accident occurred, not to the gunners who had learned their trade
at Leipsic and Montmirail, but to the future Principal Deputy, M.
de Moirod. His horse dropped him gently into the one puddle to be
found along the whole road, which created a scandal, because he had
to be pulled out of the way to enable the King's carriage to
pass.</p>

<p>His Majesty alighted at the fine new church, which was decked
out for the occasion with all its crimson hangings. The King was to
halt for dinner, immediately after which he would take the road
again to go and venerate the famous relic of Saint Clement. No
sooner was the King inside the church than Julien went off at a
gallop to M. de Rênal's. There he discarded with a sigh his fine
sky-blue coat, his sabre, his epaulettes, to resume the little
threadbare black coat. He mounted his horse again, and in a few
minutes was at Bray-le-Haut, which stands on the summit of an
imposing hill. 'Enthusiasm is multiplying these peasants,' thought
Julien. 'One cannot move at Verrières, and here there are more than
ten thousand of them round this old abbey.' Half ruined by the
vandalism of the Revolution, it had been magnificently restored
since the Restoration, and there was already some talk of miracles.
Julien joined the abbe Chélan, who scolded him severely, and gave
him a cassock and surplice. He vested himself hurriedly in these
and followed M. Chélan, who was going in search of the youthful
Bishop of Agde. This was a nephew of M. de La Mole, recently
appointed to the See, who had been selected to exhibit the relic to
the King. But the Bishop was not to be found.</p>

<p>The clergy were growing impatient. They awaited their leader in
the sombre, gothic cloister of the ancient abbey. Four and twenty
parish priests had been collected to represent the original chapter
of Bray-le-Haut which prior to 1789 had consisted of four and
twenty canons. Having spent three quarters of an hour in deploring
the youthfulness of the Bishop, the priests decided that it would
be a good thing if their Dean were to go and inform His Lordship
that the King was on his way, and that it was time they were in the
choir. M. Chélan's great age had made him Dean; despite the anger
he showed with Julien, he made a sign to him to follow him. Julien
carried his surplice admirably. By some secret process of the
ecclesiastical toilet-table, he had made his fine curly hair lie
quite flat; but, by an oversight which intensified the anger of M.
Chélan, beneath the long folds of his cassock one could see the
spurs of the Guard of Honour.</p>

<p>When they reached the Bishop's apartment, the tall lackeys
smothered in gold lace barely condescended to inform the old curé
that His Lordship could not be seen. They laughed at him when he
tried to explain that in his capacity as Dean of the Noble Chapter
of Bray-le-Haut, it was his privilege to be admitted at all times
to the presence of the officiating Bishop.</p>

<p>Julien's proud spirit was offended by the insolence of the
lackeys. He set off on a tour of the dormitories of the old abbey,
trying every door that he came to. One quite small door yielded to
his efforts and he found himself in a cell in the midst of His
Lordship's body-servants, dressed in black with chains round their
necks. Seeing his air of haste, these gentlemen supposed that the
Bishop had sent for him and allowed him to pass. He went a little
way and found himself in an immense gothic chamber, very dark and
panelled throughout in black oak; with a single exception, its
pointed windows had been walled up with bricks. There was nothing
to conceal the coarse surface of this masonry, which formed a sorry
contrast to the venerable splendour of the woodwork. Both sides of
this room, famous among the antiquarians of Burgundy, which the
Duke Charles the Bold built about the year 1470 in expiation of
some offence, were lined with wooden stalls, richly carved. These
displayed, inlaid in wood of different colours, all the mysteries
of the Apocalypse.</p>

<p>This melancholy splendour, degraded by the intrusion of the bare
bricks and white plaster, impressed Julien. He stood there in
silence. At the other end of the room, near the only window through
which any light came, he saw a portable mirror framed in mahogany.
A young man, robed in violet with a lace surplice, but bare-headed,
was standing three paces away from the mirror. This article
appeared out of place in such a room, and had doubtless been
brought there from the town. Julien thought that the young man
seemed irritated; with his right hand he was gravely giving
benedictions in the direction of the mirror.</p>

<p>'What can this mean?' he wondered. 'Is it a preliminary ceremony
that this young priest is performing? He is perhaps the Bishop's
secretary ...he will be rude like the lackeys...but what of that,
let us try him.'</p>

<p>He went forward and passed slowly down the length of the room,
keeping his eyes fixed on that solitary window and watching the
young man who continued to give benedictions, with a slow motion
but in endless profusion, and without pausing for a moment.</p>

<p>As he drew nearer he was better able to see the other's look of
annoyance. The costliness of his lace-bordered surplice brought
Julien to a standstill some distance away from the magnificent
mirror.</p>

<p>'It is my duty to speak,' he reminded himself at length; but the
beauty of the room had touched his feelings and he was chilled in
anticipation by the harsh words that would be addressed to him.</p>

<p>The young man caught sight of him in the glass, turned round,
and suddenly discarding his look of irritation said to him in the
pleasantest tone:</p>

<p>'Well, Sir, is it ready yet?'</p>

<p>Julien remained speechless. As this young man turned towards
him, Julien saw the pectoral cross on his breast: it was the Bishop
of Agde. 'So young,' thought Julien; 'at the most, only six or
eight years older than myself!'</p>

<p>And he felt ashamed of his spurs.</p>

<p>'Monseigneur,' he replied timidly. 'I am sent by the Dean of the
Chapter, M. Chélan.'</p>

<p>'Ah! I have an excellent account of him,' said the bishop in a
courteous tone which left Julien more fascinated than ever. 'But I
beg your pardon, Sir, I took you for the person who is to bring me
back my mitre. It was carelessly packed in Paris; the silver tissue
has been dreadfully frayed at the top. It will create a shocking
effect,' the young Bishop went on with a sorrowful air, 'and they
are keeping me waiting too.'</p>

<p>'Monseigneur, I shall go and find the mitre, with Your
Lordship's permission.'</p>

<p>Julien's fine eyes had their effect.</p>

<p>'Go, Sir,' the Bishop answered with exquisite courtesy; 'I must
have it at once. I am sorry to keep the gentlemen of the Chapter
waiting.'</p>

<p>When Julien was halfway down the room, he turned to look at the
Bishop and saw that he was once more engaged in giving
benedictions. 'What can that be?' Julien asked himself; 'no doubt,
it is a religious preparation necessary to the ceremony that is to
follow.' When he came to the cell in which the servants were
waiting, he saw the mitre in their hands. These gentlemen, yielding
in spite of themselves to Julien's imperious glance, surrendered it
to him.</p>

<p>He felt proud to be carrying it: as he crossed the room, he
walked slowly; he held it with respect. He found the Bishop seated
before the glass; but, from time to time, his right hand, tired as
it was, still gave the benediction. Julien helped him to put on the
mitre. The Bishop shook his head.</p>

<p>'Ah! It will keep on,' he said to Julien with a satisfied air.
'Will you go a little way off?'</p>

<p>Whereupon the Bishop walked at a smart pace to the middle of the
room, then returning towards the mirror with a slow step, he
resumed his air of irritation and went on solemnly giving
benedictions.</p>

<p>Julien was spellbound with astonishment; he was tempted to guess
what this meant, but did not dare. The Bishop stopped, and looking
at him with an air from which the solemnity rapidly vanished:</p>

<p>'What do you say to my mitre, Sir, does it look right?'</p>

<p>'Quite right, Monseigneur.'</p>

<p>'It is not too far back? That would look rather silly; but it
does not do, either, to wear them pulled down over one's eyes like
an officer's shako.'</p>

<p>'It seems to me to be quite right.'</p>

<p>'The King of &mdash;&mdash; is accustomed to venerable clergy
who are doubtless very solemn. I should not like, especially in
view of my age, to appear too frivolous.'</p>

<p>And the Bishop once more began to walk about the room scattering
benedictions.</p>

<p>'It is quite clear,' said Julien, at last venturing to
understand, 'he is practising the benediction.'</p>

<p>A few moments later:</p>

<p>'I am ready,' said the Bishop. 'Go, Sir, and inform the Dean and
the gentlemen of the Chapter.'</p>

<p>Presently M. Chélan, followed by the two oldest of the curés,
entered by an immense door, magnificently carved, which Julien had
not noticed. But this time he remained in his place in the extreme
rear, and could see the Bishop only over the shoulders of the
ecclesiastics who crowded towards this door.</p>

<p>The Bishop crossed the room slowly; when he came to the
threshold the curés formed in processional order. After a momentary
confusion the procession began to move, intoning a psalm. The
Bishop came last, between M. Chélan and another curé of great age.
Julien found a place for himself quite close to His Lordship, as
being attached to the abbe Chélan. They moved down the long
corridors of the abbey of Bray-le-Haut; in spite of the brilliant
sunshine, these were dark and damp. At length they arrived at the
door of the cloister. Julien was speechless with admiration of so
fine a ceremony. His heart was divided between the ambition aroused
by the Bishop's youthfulness, and the sensibility and exquisite
manners of this prelate. His courtesy was of a very different kind
from M. de Rênal's, even on his good days. 'The more one rises
towards the highest rank of society,' thought Julien, 'the more one
finds these charming manners.'</p>

<p>They entered the church by a side door; suddenly an appalling
crash made its ancient vaults resound; Julien thought that the
walls were collapsing. It was again the small cannon; drawn by
eight horses at a gallop, it had just arrived; and immediately on
its arrival, brought into action by the gunners of Leipsic, it was
firing five rounds a minute, as though the Prussians had been in
front of it.</p>

<p>But this stirring sound no longer had any effect upon Julien, he
dreamed no more of Napoleon and martial glory. 'So young,' he was
thinking, 'to be Bishop of Agde! But where is Agde? And how much is
it worth? Two or three hundred thousand francs, perhaps.'</p>

<p>His Lordship's servants appeared, carrying a magnificent dais;
M. Chélan took one of the poles, but actually it was Julien that
bore it. The Bishop took his place beneath it. He had really
succeeded in giving himself the air of an old man; our hero's
admiration knew no bounds. 'What cannot one do if one is clever!'
he thought.</p>

<p>The King made his entry. Julien was so fortunate as to see him
at close range. The Bishop addressed him with unction, and did not
forget to include a slight touch of confusion, extremely flattering
to His Majesty. We shall not repeat the account of the ceremonies
at Bray-le-Haut; for a fortnight they filled the columns of all the
newspapers of the Department. Julien learned, from the Bishop's
speech, that the King was descended from Charles the Bold.</p>

<p>Later on it was one of Julien's duties to check the accounts of
what this ceremony had cost. M. de La Mole, who had securéd a
bishopric for his nephew, had chosen to pay him the compliment of
bearing the whole of the expense himself. The ceremony at
Bray-le-Haut alone cost three thousand eight hundred francs.</p>

<p>After the Bishop's address and the King's reply, His Majesty
took his place beneath the dais; he then knelt down most devoutly
upon a cushion close to the altar. The choir was enclosed with
stalls, and these stalls were raised two steps above the pavement.
It was on the second of these steps that Julien sat at the feet of
M. Chélan, not unlike a train-bearer at the feet of his Cardinal,
in the Sistine Chapel, in Rome. There were a Te Deum, clouds of
incense, endless volleys of musketry and artillery; the peasants
were frantic with joy and piety. Such a day undoes the work of a
hundred numbers of the Jacobin papers.</p>

<p>Julien was within six paces of the King, who was praying with
genuine fervour. He noticed for the first time a small man of
intelligent appearance, whose coat was almost bare of embroidery.
But he wore a sky-blue riband over this extremely simple coat. He
was nearer to the King than many other gentlemen, whose coats were
so covered with gold lace that, to use Julien's expression, one
could not see the cloth. He learned a minute later that this was M.
de La Mole. He decided that he wore a haughty, indeed an insolent
air.</p>

<p>'This Marquis would not be polite like my dear Bishop,' he
thought. 'Ah! The career of a churchman makes one gentle and wise.
But the King has come to venerate the relic, and I see no relic.
Where can Saint Clement be?'</p>

<p>A little clerk, who was next to him, informed him that the
venerable relic was in the upper part of the building, in a
<i>chapelle ardente</i>.</p>

<p>'What is a <i>chapelle ardente</i>?' Julien asked himself.</p>

<p>But he would not ask for an explanation of the words. He
followed the proceedings with even closer attention.</p>

<p>On the occasion of a visit from a sovereign prince, etiquette
requires that the canons shall not accompany the Bishop. But as he
started for the chapelle ardente His Lordship of Agde summoned the
abbe Chélan; Julien ventured to follow him.</p>

<p>After climbing a long stair, they came to a very small door, the
frame of which was sumptuously gilded. This work had a look of
having just been completed.</p>

<p>Outside the door were gathered on their knees four and twenty
girls, belonging to the most distinguished families of Verrières.
Before opening the door, the Bishop sank on his knees in the midst
of these girls, who were all pretty. While he was praying aloud, it
seemed as though they could not sufficiently admire his fine lace,
his charm, his young and pleasant face. This spectacle made our
hero lose all that remained of his reason. At that moment, he would
have fought for the Inquisition, and in earnest. Suddenly the door
flew open. The little chapel seemed to be ablaze with light. One
saw upon the altar more than a thousand candles arranged in eight
rows, separated from one another by clusters of flowers. The sweet
odour of the purest incense rose in clouds from the gate of the
sanctuary. The newly gilded chapel was quite small, but very lofty.
Julien noticed that there were on the altar candles more than
fifteen feet long. The girls could not restrain a cry of
admiration. No one had been admitted to the tiny ante-chapel save
the twenty-four girls, the two priests and Julien.</p>

<p>Presently the King arrived, followed only by M. de La Mole and
his Great Chamberlain. The guards themselves remained outside, on
their knees, presenting their arms.</p>

<p>His Majesty flung himself rather than knelt down on the
faldstool. It was then only that Julien, pressed against the gilded
door, caught sight, beneath a girl's bare arm, of the charming
statue of Saint Clement. It was hidden beneath the altar, in the
garb of a young Roman soldier. He had in his throat a large wound
from which the blood seemed to be flowing. The artist had surpassed
himself; the eyes, dying but full of grace, were half closed. A
budding moustache adorned the charming mouth, which being slightly
open had the effect of being still engaged in prayer. At the sight
of this statue, the girl nearest to Julien wept hot tears; one of
her tears fell upon Julien's hand.</p>

<p>After an interval of prayer in the most profound silence,
disturbed only by the distant sound of the bells of all the
villages within a radius of ten leagues, the Bishop of Agde asked
the King's permission to speak. He concluded a brief but highly
edifying discourse with these words, simple in themselves, but
thereby all the better assured of their effect.</p>

<p>'Never forget, young Christian women, that you have seen one of
the great Kings of the earth upon his knees before the servants of
this all-powerful and terrible God. These servants, frail,
persecuted, martyred upon earth, as you can see from the still
bleeding wound of Saint Clement, are triumphant in heaven. All your
lives, I think, young Christians, you will remember this day. You
will detest impiety. Always you will remain faithful to this God
who is so great, so terrible, but so good.'</p>

<p>At these words, the Bishop rose with authority.</p>

<p>'You promise me?' he said, extending his arm with an air of
inspiration.</p>

<p>'We promise,' said the girls, bursting into tears.</p>

<p>'I receive your promise, in the name of our terrible God!' the
Bishop concluded in a voice of thunder. And the ceremony was at an
end.</p>

<p>The King himself was in tears. It was not until long afterwards
that Julien was calm enough to inquire where were the bones of the
Saint, sent from Rome to Philip the Good, Duke of Burgundy. He was
told that they were embodied in the charming wax figure.</p>

<p>His Majesty deigned to permit the girls who had accompanied him
into the chapel to wear a red riband upon which were embroidered
the words: 'HATRED OF IMPIETY, PERPETUAL ADORATION.'</p>

<p>M. de La Mole ordered ten thousand bottles of wine to be
distributed among the peasants. That evening, at Verrières, the
Liberals found an excuse for illuminating their houses a hundred
times more brilliantly than the Royalists. Before leaving the town,
the King paid a visit to M. de Moirod.</p>

of Sorrow</h2>

&mdash;BARNAVE</p>

<p>While he was replacing its ordinary furniture in the room that
M. de La Mole had occupied, Julien found a piece of stout paper,
folded twice across. He read at the foot of the first page:</p>

<p>To H. E., M. le Marquis de La Mole, Peer of France, Knight of
the Royal Orders, etc., etc.</p>

<p>It was a petition in the rude handwriting of a cook.</p>

<p>Monsieur le Marquis,</p>

<p>All my life I have held religious principles. I was in Lyons,
exposed to the bombs, at the time of the siege, in '93, of
execrable memory. I am a communicant, I go every Sunday to mass in
my parish church. I have never failed in my Easter duty, not even
in '93, of execrable memory. My cook, for before the revolution I
kept servants, my cook observes Friday. I enjoy in Verrières a
general and I venture to say merited respect. I walk beneath the
dais in processions, beside the curé and the mayor. I carry, on
solemn occasions, a big candle bought at my own cost. The
certificates of all of which are in Paris at the Ministry of
Finance. I ask Monsieur le Marquis for the Verrières lottery
office, which cannot fail to be vacant soon in one way or another,
the present holder being seriously ill, and besides voting the
wrong way at the elections; etc.</p>

<p>DE CHOLIN</p>

<p>On the margin of this petition was an endorsement signed de
Moirod, which began with the words:</p>

<p>'I had the honour yesterday to mention the respectable person
who makes this request,' and so forth.</p>

<p>'And so even that imbecile Cholin shows me the way that I must
follow,' Julien said to himself.</p>

falsehoods, foolish interpretations, absurd discussions, etc.,

Mole, the ten thousand bottles of wine, the unseated Moirod (who,
in the hope of a Cross, did not set foot outside his own door for a
whole month after his fall) were in turn subjected, was the utter
indelicacy of having jockeyed into the Guard of Honour, Julien
Sorel, the son of a carpenter. You ought to have heard, on this
topic, the wealthy calico printers, who, morning, noon and night,
used to talk themselves hoarse in preaching equality. That proud
woman, Madame de Rênal, was the author of this abomination. Her
reason? The flashing eyes and pink cheeks of that young abbe Sorel
were reason enough and to spare.</p>

<p>Shortly after their return to Vergy, Stanislas Xavier, the
youngest of the children, took fever; at once Madame de Rênal was
seized by the most fearful remorse. For the first time she blamed
herself for falling in love in a coherent fashion. She seemed to
understand, as though by a miracle, the appalling sin into which
she had let herself be drawn. Although deeply religious by nature,
until this moment she had never thought of the magnitude of her
crime in the eyes of God.</p>

<p>Long ago, at the convent of the Sacred Heart, she had loved God
with a passionate love; she feared Him in the same way in this
predicament. The struggles that rent her heart asunder were all the
more terrible in that there was nothing reasonable in her fear.
Julien discovered that any recourse to argument irritated instead
of calming her; she saw in it the language of hell. However, as
Julien himself was greatly attached to little Stanislas, he was
more welcome to speak to her of the child's illness: presently it
assumed a grave character. Then her incessant remorse deprived
Madame de Rênal even of the power to sleep; she never emerged from
a grim silence: had she opened her mouth, it would have been to
confess her crime to God and before men.</p>

<p>'I beg of you,' Julien said to her, as soon as they were alone,
'say nothing to anyone; let me be the sole confidant of your
griefs. If you still love me, do not speak! your words cannot curé
our Stanislas of his fever.'</p>

<p>But his attempts at consolation produced no effect; he did not
know that Madame de Rênal had taken it into her head that, to
appease the anger of a jealous God, she must either hate Julien or
see her son die. It was because she felt that she could not hate
her lover that she was so unhappy.</p>

<p>'Avoid my presence,' she said to Julien one day; 'in the name of
God, leave this house: it is your presence here that is killing my
son.</p>

<p>'God is punishing me,' she added in a whisper; 'He is just; I
adore His equity; my crime is shocking, and I was living without
remorse! It was the first sign of departure from God: I ought to be
doubly punished.'</p>

<p>Julien was deeply touched. He was unable to see in this attitude
either hypocrisy or exaggeration. 'She believes that she is killing
her son by loving me, and yet the unhappy woman loves me more than
her son. That, how can I doubt it, is the remorse that is killing
her; there is true nobility of feeling. But how can I have inspired
such love, I, so poor, so ill-bred, so ignorant, often so rude in
my manners?'</p>

<p>One night the child's condition was critical. About two o'clock
in the morning, M. de Rênal came to see him. The boy, burning with
fever, was extremely flushed and did not recognise his father.
Suddenly Madame de Rênal threw herself at her husband's feet:
Julien saw that she was going to reveal everything and to ruin
herself for ever.</p>

<p>Fortunately, this strange exhibition annoyed M. de Rênal.</p>

<p>'Good night! Good night!' he said and prepared to leave the
room.</p>

<p>'No, listen to me,' cried his wife on her knees before him,
seeking to hold him back. 'Learn the whole truth. It is I that am
killing my son. I gave him his life, and I am taking it from him.
Heaven is punishing me; in the eyes of God, I am guilty of murder.
I must destroy and humble myself; it may be that such a sacrifice
will appease the Lord.'</p>

<p>If M. de Rênal had been a man of imagination, he would have
guessed everything.</p>

<p>'Romantic stuff,' he exclaimed, thrusting away his wife who
sought to embrace his knees. 'Romantic stuff, all that! Julien,
tell them to fetch the doctor at daybreak.'</p>

<p>And he went back to bed. Madame de Rênal sank on her knees, half
unconscious, with a convulsive movement thrusting away Julien, who
was coming to her assistance.</p>

<p>Julien stood watching her with amazement.</p>

<p>'So this is adultery!' he said to himself...'Can it be possible
that those rascally priests are right after all? That they, who
commit so many sins, have the privilege of knowing the true theory
of sin? How very odd!'</p>

<p>For twenty minutes since M. de Rênal had left the room, Julien
had seen the woman he loved, her head sunk on the child's little
bed, motionless and almost unconscious. 'Here we have a woman of
superior intelligence reduced to the last extremes of misery,
because she has known me,' he said to himself.</p>

<p>The hours passed rapidly. 'What can I do for her? I must make up
my mind. I have ceased to count here. What do I care for men, and
their silly affectations? What can I do for her?...Go from her? But
I shall be leaving her alone, torn by the most frightful grief.
That automaton of a husband does her more harm than good. He will
say something offensive to her, in his natural coarseness; she may
go mad, throw herself from the window.</p>

<p>'If I leave her, if I cease to watch over her, she will tell him
everything. And then, for all one knows, in spite of the fortune he
is to inherit through her, he will make a scandal. She may tell
everything, great God, to that&mdash;abbe Maslon, who makes the illness
of a child of six an excuse for never stirring out of this house,
and not without purpose. In her grief and her fear of God, she
forgets all that she knows of the man; she sees only the
priest.'</p>

<p>'Leave me,' came suddenly from Madame de Rênal as she opened her
eyes.</p>

<p>'I would give my life a thousand times to know how I can be of
most use to you,' replied Julien; 'never have I so loved you, my
dear angel, or rather, from this instant only, I begin to adore you
as you deserve to be adored. What is to become of me apart from
you, and with the knowledge that you are wretched by my fault! But
I must not speak of my own sufferings. I shall go, yes, my love.
But, if I leave you, if I cease to watch over you, to be constantly
interposing myself between you and your husband, you will tell him
everything, you will be ruined. Think of the ignominy with which he
will drive you from the house; all Verrières, all Besançon will
ring with the scandal. All the blame will be cast on you; you will
never be able to lift up your head again.'</p>

<p>'That is all that I ask,' she cried, rising to her feet. 'I
shall suffer, all the better.'</p>

<p>'But, by this appalling scandal, you will be harming him as
well!'</p>

<p>'But I humble myself, I throw myself down in the mud; and in
that way perhaps I save my son. This humiliation, in the sight of
all, is perhaps a public penance. So far as my frailty can judge,
is it not the greatest sacrifice that I can make to God? Perhaps he
will deign to accept my humiliation and to spare me my son! Show me
a harder sacrifice and I will hasten to perform it.'</p>

<p>'Let me punish myself. I too am guilty. Would you have me retire
to La Trappe? The austerity of the life there may appease your
God...Oh, heaven! Why can I not take upon myself Stanislas's
illness?'</p>

<p>'Ah! You love him,' said Madame de Rênal, rising and flinging
herself into his arms.</p>

<p>Immediately she thrust him from her with horror.</p>

<p>'I believe you! I believe you!' she went on, having fallen once
more on her knees; 'O my only friend, why are not you Stanislas's
father? Then it would not be a horrible sin to love you more than
your son.'</p>

<p>'Will you permit me to stay, and henceforward only to love you
as a brother? It is the only reasonable expiation; it may appease
the wrath of the Most High.'</p>

<p>'And I,' she exclaimed, rising, and taking Julien's head in her
hands, and holding it at arm's length before her eyes, 'and I,
shall I love you like a brother? Is it in my power to love you like
a brother?'</p>

<p>Julien burst into tears.</p>

<p>'I will obey you,' he said as he fell at her feet. 'I will obey
you, whatever you may bid me do; it is the one thing left for me.
My brain is smitten with blindness; I can see no course to take. If
I leave you, you tell your husband all; you ruin yourself, and him
at the same time. After such a disgrace he will never be elected
Deputy. If I stay, you regard me as the cause of your son's death,
and you yourself die of grief. Would you like to test the effect of
my going? If you like, I will punish myself for our sin by leaving
you for a week. I shall pass the time in retreat wherever you
choose. At the abbey of Bray-le-Haut, for instance; but swear to me
that during my absence you will reveal nothing to your husband.
Remember that I can never return if you speak.'</p>

<p>She promised; he departed, but was recalled after two days.</p>

<p>'It is impossible for me to keep my oath without you. I shall
speak to my husband, if you are not constantly there to order me
with your eyes to be silent. Each hour of this abominable life
seems to me to last a day.'</p>

<p>In the end, heaven took pity on this unhappy mother. Gradually
Stanislas passed out of danger. But the ice was broken, her reason
had learned the magnitude of her sin, she could no more recover her
equilibrium. Remorse still remained, and took the form that it was
bound to take in so sincere a heart. Her life was heaven and hell;
hell when she did not see Julien, heaven when she was at his
feet.</p>

<p>'I am no longer under any illusion,' she told him, even at the
moments when she ventured to give absolute rein to her love: 'I am
damned, irremediably damned. You are young, you have yielded to my
seduction, heaven may pardon you; but as for me, I am damned. I
know it by an infallible sign. I am afraid: who would not be afraid
at the sight of hell? But at heart, I am not in the least
repentant. I would commit my sin again, were it to be committed.
Let heaven only refrain from punishing me in this world and in my
children, and I shall have more than I deserve. But you, at least,
my Julien,' she cried at other moments, 'are you happy? Do you feel
that I love you enough?'</p>

<p>Julien's distrust and suffering pride, which needed above all a
love that made sacrifices, could not stand out against the sight of
so great, so indubitable a sacrifice, and one that was made afresh
every moment. He adored Madame de Rênal. 'She may well be noble,
and I the son of a working man; she loves me...I am not to her a
footman employed in the part of lover.' Once rid of this fear,
Julien fell into all the follies of love, into its mortal
uncertainties.</p>

<p>'At least.' she cried when she saw that he doubted her love,
'let me make you happy during the few days we still have to spend
together! Let us make haste; tomorrow perhaps I shall be no longer
yours. If heaven strikes me through my children, in vain shall I
seek to live only for love of you, not to see that it is my crime
that is killing them. I shall not be able to survive that blow.
Even if I would, I could not; I should go mad.'</p>

<p>'Ah! If I could take your sin upon my conscience, as you so
generously wished that you might take Stanislas's fever!'</p>

<p>This great moral crisis changed the nature of the sentiment that
united Julien to his mistress. His love was no longer merely
admiration of her beauty, pride in the possession of her.</p>

<p>Their joy was thenceforward of a far higher nature, the flame
that devoured them was more intense. They underwent transports of
utter madness. Their happiness would have seemed great in the eyes
of other people. But they never recaptured the delicious serenity,
the unclouded happiness, the spontaneous joy of the first days of
their love, when Madame de Rênal's one fear was that of not being
loved enough by Julien. Their happiness assumed at times the aspect
of crime.</p>

<p>In what were their happiest, and apparently their calmest
moments: 'Oh! Great God! I see hell before me,' Madame de Rênal
would suddenly exclaim, gripping Julien's hand with a convulsive
movement. 'What fearful torments! I have well deserved them.' She
clutched him, clinging to him like the ivy to the wall.</p>

<p>Julien tried in vain to calm this agitated soul. She took his
hand, which she covered with kisses. Then, relapsing into a sombre
meditation; 'Hell,' she said, 'hell would be a blessing to me; I
should still have some days in this world to spend with him, but
hell here on earth, the death of my children...Yet, at that price,
perhaps my crime would be forgiven me... Oh! Great God! Grant me
not my pardon at that price. These poor children have done nothing
to offend thee; 'tis I, I, the guilt is mine alone! I love a man
who is not my husband.'</p>

<p>Julien next saw Madame de Rênal reach a state that was outwardly
tranquil. She sought to take the burden upon herself, she wished
not to poison the existence of him whom she loved.</p>

<p>In the midst of these alternations of love, remorse and
pleasure, the days passed for them with lightning rapidity. Julien
lost the habit of reflection.</p>

<p>Miss Elisa went to conduct a little lawsuit which she had at
Verrières. She found M. Valenod greatly annoyed with Julien. She
hated the tutor and often spoke about him to M. Valenod.</p>

<p>'You would ruin me, Sir, if I told you the truth!' she said to
him one day. 'Employers all hang together in important things. They
never forgive us poor servants for certain revelations...'</p>

<p>After these conventional phrases, which the impatient curiosity
of M. Valenod found a way of cutting short, he learned the most
mortifying things in the world for his own self-esteem.</p>

<p>This woman, the most distinguished in the place, whom for six
years he had surrounded with every attention, and, unluckily,
before the eyes of all the world; this proudest of women, whose
disdain had so often made him blush, had taken as her lover a
little journeyman dressed up as a tutor. And that nothing might be
wanting to the discomfiture of the governor of the poorhouse,
Madame de Rênal adored this lover.</p>

<p>'And,' the maid added with a sigh, 'M. Julien went to no pains
to make this conquest, he has never departed from his habitual
coldness with Madame.'</p>

<p>It was only in the country that Elisa had become certain of her
facts, but she thought that this intrigue dated from far
earlier.</p>

<p>'That, no doubt, is why,' she continued bitterly, 'he refused at
the time to marry me. And I, like a fool, going to consult Madame
de Rênal, begging her to speak to the tutor!'</p>

<p>That same evening M. de Rênal received from the town, with his
newspaper, a long anonymous letter which informed him in the
fullest detail of all that was going on under his roof. Julien saw
him turn pale as he read this letter, which was written on blue
paper, and cast angry glances at himself. For the rest of the
evening the Mayor never recovered his peace of mind; it was in vain
that Julien tried to flatter him by asking him to explain obscuré
points in the pedigrees of the best families of Burgundy.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch20" id="ch20"></a>Chapter 20. The Anonymous
Letters</h2>

<p style="margin-left:10%">Do not give dalliance<br>
Too much the rein; the strongest oaths are straw<br>
To the fire i' the blood. &mdash;<i>The Tempest</i></p>

<p>As they left the drawing-room about midnight, Julien found time
to say to his mistress: 'Do not let us meet tonight, your husband
has suspicions; I would swear that that long letter he was reading
with such displeasure is an anonymous one.'</p>

<p>Fortunately, Julien locked himself into his room. Madame de
Rênal conceived the mad idea that this warning was simply a pretext
for not coming to see her. She lost her head absolutely, and at the
usual hour came to his door. Julien, hearing a sound in the
corridor, instantly blew out his lamp. Someone was attempting to
open his door; was it Madame de Rênal, was it a jealous
husband?</p>

<p>Early the next morning, the cook, who took an interest in
Julien, brought him a book on the cover of which he read these
words written in Italian: <i>Guardate alia pagina 130</i>.</p>

<p>Julien shuddered at the imprudence, turned to page one hundred
and thirty and found fastened to it with a pin the following letter
written in haste, bedewed with tears, and without the least attempt
at spelling. Ordinarily Madame de Rênal spelt quite well; he was
moved by this detail and began to forget the frightful
imprudence.</p>

<p>'So you would not let me in tonight? There are moments when I
feel that I have never seen into the depths of your heart. Your
look frightens me. I am afraid of you. Great God! Can it be, you
have never loved me? In that case, my husband can discover our
love, and shut me up in lifelong imprisonment, in the country,
apart from my children. Perhaps God wills it so. I shall soon die;
but you will be a monster.</p>

<p>'Do you not love me? Are you tired of my follies, of my remorse,
impious one? Do you wish to ruin me? I give you an easy method. Go,
show this letter to all Verrières, or rather show it to M. Valenod
alone. Tell him that I love you; but no, utter no such blasphemy;
tell him that I adore you, that life only began for me on the day
when I first saw you; that in the wildest moments of my girlhood, I
had never even dreamed of the happiness that I owe to you; that I
have sacrificed my life to you, that I am sacrificing my soul to
you. You know that I am sacrificing far more.</p>

<p>'But what does he know of sacrifices, that man? Tell him, tell
him, to make him angry, that I defy all evil-speakers, and that
there is but one misfortune in the world for me, that of beholding
a change in the one man who holds me to life. What a blessing for
me to lose it, to offer it in sacrifice, and to fear no longer for
my children!</p>

<p>'Doubt not, dear friend, if there be an anonymous letter, it
comes from that odious being who, for the last six years, has
pursued me with his loud voice, with a list of the jumps his horse
has taken, with his fatuity and with the endless enumeration of all
his advantages.</p>

<p>'Is there an anonymous letter? Wicked one, that is what I wished
to discuss with you; but no, you were right. Clasping you in my
arms, for the last time perhaps, I could never have discussed the
matter calmly, as I do when I am alone. From this moment our
happiness will not be so easily securéd. Will that be an annoyance
to you? Yes, on the days when you have not received some amusing
book from M. Fouque. The sacrifice is made; tomorrow, whether there
be an anonymous letter or not, I shall tell my husband that I have
received an anonymous letter, that he must instantly offer you a
large sum to accept another post, find some decent pretext, and
send you back without delay to your family.</p>

<p>'Alas, dear friend, we are going to be parted for a fortnight,
perhaps a month! But there, I do you justice, you will suffer as
much as I. Still, this is the only way to counteract the effect of
this anonymous letter; it is not the first that my husband has
received, and on my account too. Alas! How I have laughed at
them!</p>

<p>'The whole purpose of my scheme is to make my husband think that
the letter comes from M. Valenod; I have no doubt that he is its
author. If you leave the house, do not fail to go and establish
yourself at Verrières. I shall contrive that my husband conceives
the idea of spending a fortnight there, to prove to the fools that
there is no coolness between him and myself. Once you are at
Verrières, make friends with everyone, even the Liberals. I know
that all the ladies will run after you.</p>

<p>'Do not go and quarrel with M. Valenod, nor crop his ears, as
you once threatened; on the contrary, show him every politeness.
The essential thing is that it should be known throughout Verrières
that you are going to Valenod's, or to some other house, for the
children's education.</p>

<p>'That is what my husband will never stand. Should he resign
himself to it, well, at least you will be living in Verrières, and
I shall see you sometimes. My children, who are so fond of you,
will go to see you. Great God! I feel that I love my children more,
because they love you. What remorse! How is all this going to end?
I am wandering...Well, you understand what you must do; be gentle,
polite, never contemptuous with these vulgar personages, I implore
you on my knees: they are to be the arbiters of our destiny. Doubt
not for a moment that my husband in dealing with you will conform
to whatever <i>public opinion</i> may prescribe.</p>

<p>'It is you that are going to provide me with this anonymous
letter; arm yourself with patience and a pair of scissors. Cut out
of a book the words you will see below; paste them together, with
water-glue, on the sheet of blue paper that I send you; it came to
me from M. Valenod. Be prepared for a search of your room; burn the
pages of the book you mutilate. If you do not find the words ready
made, have the patience to compose them letter by letter. To spare
you trouble, I have cut the anonymous letter short. Alas! If you no
longer love me, as I fear, how long mine must seem to you!</p>

<p>ANONYMOUS LETTER</p>

<p>"MADAME,</p>

<p>All your little goings on are known; but the persons to whose
interest it is to check them have been warned. From a lingering
affection for yourself, I beg you to detach yourself entirely from
the little peasant. If you have the wisdom to do this, your husband
will believe that the warning he has received was misleading, and
he will be left in his error. Bear in mind that I know your secret;
tremble, unhappy woman; henceforward you must tread a straight
path, driven by me."</p>

<p>'As soon as you have finished pasting together the words that
make up this letter (do you recognise the Governor's style in it?)
come out of your room, I shall meet you about the house.</p>

<p>'I shall go to the village, and return with a troubled
countenance; I shall indeed be greatly troubled. Great God! What a
risk I am running, and all because you <i>thought you detected</i>
an anonymous letter. Finally, with a woebegone face, I shall give
my husband this letter, which will have been handed to me by a
stranger. As for you, go for a walk in the direction of the woods
with the children, and do not return until dinner time.</p>

<p>'From the rocks above, you can see the tower of the dovecote. If
all goes well, I shall place a white handkerchief there; if not,
you will see nothing.</p>

<p>'Ungrateful wretch, will not your heart find out some way of
telling me that you love me, before starting on this walk? Whatever
may befall me, be certain of one thing: I should not survive for a
day a final parting. Ah! bad mother! These are two idle words that
I have written, dear Julien. I do not feel them; I can think only
of you at this moment, I have written them only so as not to be
blamed by you. Now that I find myself brought to the point of
losing you, what use is there in pretence? Yes, let my heart seem
black as night to you, but let me not lie to the man whom I adore!
I have been all too deceitful already in my life. Go to, I forgive
you if you love me no longer. I have not time to read my letter
through. It is a small thing in my eyes to pay with my life for the
happy days which I have spent in your arms. You know that they will
cost me more than life.'</p>

<h2><a name="ch21" id="ch21"></a>Chapter 21. Conversation with a
Lord and Master</h2>

<p style="margin-left:10%">Alas! our frailty is the cause, not
we!<br>
For such as we are made of, such we be.<br>
&mdash;<i>Twelfth Night</i></p>

<p>It was with a childish pleasure that Julien spent an hour in
pasting words together. As he left his room he came upon his pupils
and their mother; she took the letter with a simplicity and
courage, the calmness of which terrified him.</p>

<p>'Is the gum quite dry?' she asked him.</p>

<p>'Can this be the woman who was being driven mad by remorse?' he
thought. 'What are her plans at this moment?' He was too proud to
ask her; but never, perhaps, had she appealed to him more
strongly.</p>

<p>'If things go amiss,' she went on with the same coolness, 'I
shall be stripped of everything. Bury this store somewhere in the
mountains; it may some day be my last resource.'</p>

<p>She handed him a glass-topped case, in red morocco, filled with
gold and a few diamonds.</p>

<p>'Go now,' she said to him.</p>

<p>She embraced her children, the youngest of them twice over.
Julien stood spellbound. She left him at a rapid pace and without
looking at him again.</p>

<p>&gt;From the moment of his opening the anonymous letter, M. de
Rênal's life had been a burden to him. He had not been so agitated
since a duel that he had nearly had to fight in 1816, and, to do
him justice, the prospect of receiving a bullet in his person would
now have distressed him less. He examined the letter from every
angle. 'Is not this a woman's hand?' he asked himself. 'In that
case, what woman can have written it?' He considered in turn all
the women he knew at Verrières, without finding a definite object
for his suspicions. Could a man have dictated the letter? If so,
what man? Here again, a similar uncertainty; he had earned the
jealousy and no doubt the hatred of the majority of the men he
knew. 'I must consult my wife,' he said to himself, from force of
habit, as he rose from the armchair in which he had collapsed.</p>

<p>No sooner had he risen than 'Good God!' he exclaimed, clapping
his hand to his head, 'she is the one person whom I cannot trust;
from this moment she is my enemy.' And tears of anger welled into
his eyes.</p>

<p>It was a fitting reward for that barrenness of heart in which
practical wisdom in the provinces is rooted, that the two men whom,
at that moment, M. de Rênal most dreaded were his two most intimate
friends.</p>

<p>'Apart from them, I have ten friends perhaps,' and he turned
them over in his mind, calculating the exact amount of comfort that
he would be able to derive from each. 'To all of them, to all of
them,' he cried in his rage, 'my appalling misfortune will give the
most intense pleasure.' Happily for him, he supposed himself to be
greatly envied, and not without reason. Apart from his superb house
in town on which the King of &mdash;&mdash; had just conferred
everlasting honour by sleeping beneath its roof, he had made an
admirable piece of work of his country house at Vergy. The front
was painted white, and the windows adorned with handsome green
shutters. He was comforted for a moment by the thought of this
magnificence. The fact of the matter was that this mansion was
visible from a distance of three or four leagues, to the great
detriment of all the country houses or so-called <i>chateaux</i> of
the neighbourhood, which had been allowed to retain the humble grey
tones imparted to them by time.</p>

<p>M. de Rênal could reckon upon the tears and pity of one of his
friends, the churchwarden of the parish; but he was an imbecile who
shed tears at everything. This man was nevertheless his sole
resource.</p>

<p>'What misfortune is comparable to mine?' he exclaimed angrily.
'What isolation!</p>

<p>'Is it possible,' this truly pitiable man asked himself, 'is it
possible that, in my distress, I have not a single friend of whom
to ask advice? For my mind is becoming unhinged, I can feel it! Ah,
Falcoz! Ah, Ducros!' he cried bitterly. These were the names of two
of his boyhood's friends whom he had alienated by his arrogance in
1814. They were not noble, and he had tried to alter the terms of
equality on which they had been living all their lives.</p>

<p>One of them, Falcoz, a man of spirit and heart, a paper merchant
at Verrières, had purchased a printing press in the chief town of
the Department and had started a newspaper. The <i>Congregation</i>
had determined to ruin him: his paper had been condemned, his
printer's licence had been taken from him. In these unfortunate
circumstances he ventured to write to M. de Rênal for the first
time in ten years. The Mayor of Verrières felt it incumbent on him
to reply in the Ancient Roman style: 'If the King's Minister did me
the honour to consult me, I should say to him: "Ruin without
compunction all provincial printers, and make printing a monopoly
like the sale of tobacco."' This letter to an intimate friend which
had set the whole of Verrières marvelling at the time, M. de Rênal
now recalled, word for word, with horror. 'Who would have said that
with my rank, my fortune, my Crosses, I should one day regret it?'
It was in such transports of anger, now against himself, now
against all around him, that he passed a night of anguish; but,
fortunately, it did not occur to him to spy upon his wife.</p>

<p>'I am used to Louise,' he said to himself, 'she knows all my
affairs; were I free to marry again tomorrow I could find no one
fit to take her place.' Next, he sought relief in the idea that his
wife was innocent; this point of view made it unnecessary for him
to show his strength of character, and was far more convenient; how
many slandered wives have we not all seen!</p>

<p>'But what!' he suddenly exclaimed, pacing the floor with a
convulsive step, 'am I to allow her, as though I were a man of
straw, a mere ragamuffin, to make a mock of me with her lover? Is
the whole of Verrières to be allowed to sneer at my complacency?
What have they not said about Charmier?' (a notorious local
cuckold). 'When he is mentioned, is there not a smile on every
face? He is a good pleader, who is there that ever mentions his
talent for public speaking? "Ah! Charmier!" is what they say;
"Bernard's Charmier." They actually give him the name of the man
that has disgraced him.</p>

<p>'Thank heaven,' said M. de Rênal at other moments, 'I have no
daughter, and the manner in which I am going to punish their mother
will not damage the careers of my children; I can surprise that
young peasant with my wife, and kill the pair of them; in that
event, the tragic outcome of my misfortune may perhaps make it less
absurd.' This idea appealed to him: he worked it out in the fullest
detail. 'The Penal Code is on my side, and, whatever happens, our
<i>Congregation</i> and my friends on the jury will save me.' He
examined his hunting knife, which had a keen blade; but the thought
of bloodshed frightened him.</p>

<p>'I might thrash this insolent tutor black and blue and turn him
from the house; but what a stir in Verrières and, indeed,
throughout the Department! After the suppression of Falcoz's paper,
when his editor came out of prison, I was instrumental in making
him lose a place worth six hundred francs. They say that the
scribbler has dared to show his face again in Besançon, he may
easily attack me, and so cunningly that it will be impossible to
bring him to justice! That insolent fellow will insinuate in a
thousand ways that he has been speaking the truth. A man of family,
who respects his rank as I do, is always hated by plebeians. I
shall see myself in those frightful Paris papers; my God! what
degradation! To see the ancient name of Rênal plunged in the mire
of ridicule...If I ever travel, I shall have to change my name;
what! give up this name which is my pride and my strength. What a
crowning infamy!</p>

<p>'If I do not kill my wife, if I drive her from the house with
ignominy, she has her aunt at Besançon, who will hand over the
whole of her fortune to her on the quiet. My wife will go and live
in Paris with Julien; Verrières will hear of it, and I shall again
be regarded as a dupe.' This unhappy man then perceived, from the
failing light of his lamp, that day was beginning to break. He went
to seek a breath of air in the garden. At that moment, he had
almost made up his mind to create no scene, chiefly because a scene
of that sort would fill his good friends at Verrières with joy.</p>

<p>His stroll in the garden calmed him somewhat. 'No,' he cried, 'I
shall certainly not part with my wife, she is too useful to me.' He
pictured to himself with horror what his house would be like
without his wife; his sole female relative was the Marquise de
R&mdash;&mdash; who was old, idiotic and evil-minded.</p>

<p>An idea of the greatest good sense occurred to him, but to put
it into practice required a strength of character far exceeding the
little that the poor man possessed. 'If I keep my wife,' he said to
himself; 'I know my own nature; one day, when she taxes my
patience, I shall reproach her with her offence. She is proud, we
are bound to quarrel, and all this will happen before she has
inherited her aunt's estate. And then, how they will all laugh at
me! My wife loves her children, it will all come to them in the
end. But I, I shall be the talk of Verrières. What, they will say,
he couldn't even punish his wife! Would it not be better to stick
to my suspicions and to verify nothing? Then I tie my own hands, I
cannot afterwards reproach her with anything.'</p>

<p>A moment later M. de Rênal, his wounded vanity once more gaining
the mastery, was laboriously recalling all the stories told in the
billiard-room of the Casino or Noble Club of Verrières, when some
fluent talker interrupted the pool to make merry at the expense of
some cuckolded husband. How cruel, at that moment, those
pleasantries seemed.</p>

<p>'God! Why is not my wife dead! Then I should be immune from
ridicule. Why am I not a widower! I should go and spend six months
in Paris in the best society.' After this momentary happiness
caused by the idea of widowhood, his imagination returned to the
methods of ascertaining the truth. Should he at midnight, after the
whole household had gone to bed, sprinkle a few handfuls of bran
outside the door of Julien's room? Next morning, at daybreak, he
would see the footprints on it.</p>

<p>'But that would be no good,' he broke out angrily, 'that
wretched Elisa would notice it, and it would be all over the house
at once that I am jealous.'</p>

<p>In another story that circulated at the Casino, a husband had
made certain of his plight by fastening a hair with a little wax so
as to seal up the doors of his wife's room and her lover's.</p>

<p>After so many hours of vacillation, this method of obtaining
enlightenment seemed to him decidedly the best, and he was thinking
of adopting it, when at a bend in the path he came upon that wife
whom he would have liked to see dead.</p>

<p>She was returning from the village. She had gone to hear mass in
the church of Vergy. A tradition of extremely doubtful value in the
eyes of the cold philosopher, but one in which she believed, made
out that the little church now in use had been the chapel of the
castle of the Lord of Vergy. This thought obsessed Madame de Rênal
throughout the time which she had meant to pass in prayer in this
church. She kept on picturing to herself her husband killing Julien
during the chase, as though by accident, and afterwards, that
evening, making her eat his heart.</p>

<p>'My fate,' she said to herself, 'depends on what he will think
when he hears me. After these terrible moments, perhaps I shall not
find another opportunity to speak to him. He is not a wise
creature, swayed by reason. I might, if he were, with the aid of my
own feeble wits, forecast what he would do or say. But my fate lies
in my cunning, in the art of directing the thoughts of this
whimsical creature, who becomes blind with anger and incapable of
seeing things. Great God! I require talent, coolness, where am I to
find them?'</p>

<p>She recovered her calm as though by magic on entering the garden
and seeing her husband in the distance. The disorder of his hair
and clothes showed that he had not slept. She handed him a letter
which, though the seal was broken, was still folded. He, without
opening it, gazed at his wife with madness in his eyes.</p>

<p>'Here is an abomination,' she said to him, 'which an
evil-looking man who claims to know you and that you owe him a debt
of gratitude, handed to me as I came past the back of the lawyer's
garden. One thing I must ask of you, and that is that you send back
to his own people, and without delay, that Monsieur Julien.' Madame
de Rênal made haste to utter this name, even beginning a little too
soon perhaps, in order to rid herself of the fearful prospect of
having to utter it.</p>

<p>She was filled with joy on beholding the joy that it gave her
husband. &gt;From the fixed stare which he directed at her she
realised that Julien had guessed aright. Instead of worrying about
a very present trouble, 'what intelligence,' she thought to
herself. 'What perfect tact! And in a young man still quite devoid
of experience! To what heights will he not rise in time? Alas! Then
his success will make him forget me.'</p>

<p>This little act of admiration of the man she adored completely
restored her composure.</p>

<p>She congratulated herself on the step she had taken. 'I have
proved myself not unworthy of Julien,' she said to herself, with a
sweet and secret relish.</p>

<p>Without saying a word, for fear of committing himself, M. de
Rênal examined this second anonymous letter composed, as the reader
may remember, of printed words gummed upon a sheet of paper of a
bluish tinge. 'They are making a fool of me in every way,' M. de
Rênal said to himself, utterly worn out.</p>

<p>'Fresh insults to be looked into, and all owing to my wife!' He
was on the point of deluging her with a stream of the coarsest
invective; the thought of the fortune awaiting her at Besançon just
stopped him. Overpowered by the necessity of venting his anger on
something, he tore up the sheet on which this second anonymous
letter was gummed, and strode rapidly away, feeling that he could
not endure his wife's company. A minute later, he returned to her,
already more calm.</p>

<p>'We must take action at once and dismiss Julien,' she
immediately began; 'after all he is only the son of a working man.
You can compensate him with a few crowns, besides, he is clever and
can easily find another place, with M. Valenod, for instance, or
the Sub-Prefect Maugiron; they both have families. And so you will
not be doing him any harm...'</p>

<p>'You speak like the fool that you are,' cried M. de Rênal in a
voice of thunder. 'How can one expect common sense of a woman? You
never pay attention to what is reasonable; how should you have any
knowledge? Your carelessness, your laziness leave you just enough
activity to chase butterflies, feeble creatures which we are so
unfortunate as to have in our households...'</p>

<p>Madame de Rênal let him speak, and he spoke at length; he passed
his anger, as they say in those parts.</p>

<p>'Sir,' she answered him finally, 'I speak as a woman whose
honour, that is to say her most priceless possession, has been
outraged.'</p>

<p>Madame de Rênal preserved an unalterable calm throughout the
whole of this trying conversation, upon which depended the
possibility of her continuing to live beneath the same roof as
Julien. She sought out the ideas that seemed to her best fitted to
guide her husband's blind anger. She had remained unmoved by all
the insulting remarks that he had addressed to her, she did not
hear them, she was thinking all the time of Julien. 'Will he be
pleased with me?'</p>

<p>'This little peasant upon whom we have lavished every attention,
including presents, may be innocent,' she said at length, 'but he
is none the less the occasion of the first insult I have ever
received...Sir, when I read that abominable document, I vowed that
either he or I should leave your roof.'</p>

<p>'Do you wish to create a scandal that will dishonour me and
yourself as well? You'll be giving a fine treat to many people in
Verrières.'</p>

<p>'That is true; they are all jealous of the state of prosperity
to which your wise management has brought you, your family and the
town...Very well, I shall go and bid Julien ask you for leave to
spend a month with that timber merchant in the mountain, a fit
companion for that little workman.'</p>

<p>'Take care what you do,' put in M. de Rênal, calmly enough. 'The
one thing I must insist on is that you do not speak to him. You
would show temper and make him cross with me; you know how touchy
the little gentleman is.'</p>

<p>'That young man has no tact,' went on Madame de Rênal; 'he may
be learned, you know about that, but at bottom he is nothing but a
peasant. For my own part, I have never had any opinion of him since
he refused to marry Elisa, it was a fortune ready made; and all
because now and again she pays a secret visit to M. Valenod.'</p>

<p>'Ah!' said M. de Rênal, raising his eyebrows as far as they
would go, 'what, did Julien tell you that?'</p>

<p>'No, not exactly; he has always spoken to me of the vocation
that is calling him to the sacred ministry; but believe me, the
first vocation for the lower orders is to find their daily bread.
He made it fairly clear to me that he was not unaware of these
secret visits.'</p>

<p>'And I, I, knew nothing about them!' cried M. de Rênal, all his
fury returning, emphasising every word. 'There are things going on
in my house of which I know nothing...What! There has been
something between Elisa and Valenod?'</p>

<p>'Oh, that's an old story, my dear friend,' Madame de Rênal said
laughing, 'and I daresay no harm was done. It was in the days when
your good friend Valenod would not have been sorry to have it
thought in Verrières that there was a little love&mdash;of a purely
platonic sort&mdash;exchanged between him and me.'</p>

<p>'I had that idea at one time,' cried M. de Rênal striking his
head in his fury as he advanced from one discovery to another, 'and
you never said a word to me about it?'</p>

<p>'Was I to make trouble between two friends all for a little
outburst of vanity on the part of our dear Governor? What woman is
there in society to whom he has not addressed one or more letters,
extremely witty and even a trifle gallant?'</p>

<p>'Has he written to you?'</p>

<p>'He writes frequently.'</p>

<p>'Show me his letters this instant, I order you'; and M. de Rênal
added six feet to his stature.</p>

<p>'I shall do nothing of the sort,' the answer came in a tone so
gentle as to be almost indifferent, 'I shall let you see them some
other day, when you are more yourself.'</p>

<p>'This very instant, damn it!' cried M. de Rênal, blind with
rage, and yet happier than he had been at any time in the last
twelve hours.</p>

<p>'Will you swear to me,' said Madame de Rênal solemnly, 'never to
quarrel with the Governor of the Poorhouse over these letters?'</p>

<p>'Quarrel or no quarrel, I can take the foundlings away from him;
but,' he continued, furiously, 'I want those letters this instant;
where are they?'</p>

<p>'In a drawer in my desk; but you may be certain, I shall not
give you the key of it.'</p>

<p>'I shall be able to force it,' he cried as he made off in the
direction of his wife's room.</p>

<p>He did indeed break open with an iron bar a valuable mahogany
writing desk, imported from Paris, which he used often to polish
with the tail of his coat when he thought he detected a spot on its
surface.</p>

<p>Madame de Rênal meanwhile had run up the hundred and twenty
steps of the dovecote; she knotted the corner of a white
handkerchief to one of the iron bars of the little window. She was
the happiest of women. With tears in her eyes she gazed out at the
wooded slopes of the mountain. 'Doubtless,' she said to herself,
'beneath one of those spreading beeches, Julien is watching for
this glad signal.' For long she strained her ears, then cursed the
monotonous drone of the grasshoppers and the twitter of the birds.
But for those tiresome sounds, a cry of joy, issuing from among the
rocks, might have reached her in her tower. Her ravening gaze
devoured that immense slope of dusky verdure, unbroken as the
surface of a meadow, that was formed by the treetops. 'How is it he
has not the sense,' she asked herself with deep emotion, 'to think
of some signal to tell me that his happiness is no less than mine?'
She came down from the dovecote only when she began to be afraid
that her husband might come up in search of her.</p>

<p>She found him foaming with rage. He was running through M.
Valenod's anodyne sentences, that were little used to being read
with such emotion.</p>

<p>Seizing a moment in which a lull in her husband's exclamations
gave her a chance to make herself heard:</p>

<p>'I cannot get away from my original idea,' said Madame de Rênal,
'Julien ought to go for a holiday. Whatever talent he may have for
Latin, he is nothing more, after all, than a peasant who is often
coarse and wanting in tact; every day, thinking he is being polite,
he plies me with extravagant compliments in the worst of taste,
which he learns by heart from some novel...'</p>

<p>'He never reads any,' cried M. de Rênal; 'I am positive as to
that. Do you suppose that I am a blind master who knows nothing of
what goes on under his roof?'</p>

<p>'Very well, if he doesn't read those absurd compliments
anywhere, he invents them, which is even worse. He will have spoken
of me in that tone in Verrières; and, without going so far,' said
Madame de Rênal, with the air of one making a discovery, 'he will
have spoken like that before Elisa, which is just as though he had
spoken to M. Valenod.'</p>

<p>'Ah!' cried M. de Rênal, making the table and the whole room
shake with one of the stoutest blows that human fist ever gave,
'the anonymous letter in print and Valenod's letters were all on
the same paper.'</p>

<p>'At last!' thought Madame de Rênal; she appeared thunderstruck
by this discovery, and without having the courage to add a single
word went and sat down on the divan, at the farther end of the
room.</p>

<p>The battle was now won; she had her work cut out to prevent M.
de Rênal from going and talking to the supposed author of the
anonymous letter.</p>

<p>'How is it you do not feel that to make a scene, without
sufficient proof, with M. Valenod would be the most deplorable
error? If you are envied, Sir, who is to blame? Your own talents:
your wise administration, the buildings you have erected with such
good taste, the dowry I brought you, and above all the considerable
fortune we may expect to inherit from my worthy aunt, a fortune the
extent of which is vastly exaggerated, have made you the principal
person in Verrières.'</p>

<p>'You forget my birth,' said M. de Rênal, with a faint smile.</p>

<p>'You are one of the most distinguished gentlemen in the
province,' Madame de Rênal hastily added; 'if the King were free
and could do justice to birth, you would doubtless be figuring in
the House of Peers,' and so forth. 'And in this magnificent
position do you seek to provide jealousy with food for comment?</p>

<p>'To speak to M. Valenod of his anonymous letter is to proclaim
throughout Verrières, or rather in Besançon, throughout the
Province, that this petty cit, admitted perhaps imprudently to the
friendship of a Rênal, has found out a way to insult him. Did these
letters which you have just discovered prove that I had responded
to M. Valenod's overtures, then it would be for you to kill me, I
should have deserved it a hundred times, but not to show anger with
him. Think that all your neighbours only await a pretext to be
avenged for your superiority; think that in 1816 you were
instrumental in securing certain arrests. That man who took refuge
on your roof...'</p>

<p>'What I think is that you have neither respect nor affection for
me,' shouted M. de Rênal with all the bitterness that such a memory
aroused, 'and I have not been made a Peer!'</p>

<p>'I think, my friend,' put in Madame de Rênal with a smile, 'that
I shall one day be richer than you, that I have been your companion
for twelve years, and that on all these counts I ought to have a
voice in your councils, especially in this business today. If you
prefer Monsieur Julien to me,' she added with ill-concealed scorn,
'I am prepared to go and spend the winter with my aunt.'</p>

<p>This threat was uttered <i>with gladness</i>. It contained the
firmness which seeks to cloak itself in courtesy; it determined M.
de Rênal. But, obeying the provincial custom, he continued to speak
for a long time, harked back to every argument in turn; his wife
allowed him to speak, there was still anger in his tone. At length,
two hours of futile discourse wore out the strength of a man who
had been helpless with rage all night. He determined upon the line
of conduct which he was going to adopt towards M. Valenod, Julien,
and even Elisa.</p>

<p>Once or twice, during this great scene, Madame de Rênal came
within an ace of feeling a certain sympathy for the very real
distress of this man who for ten years had been her friend. But our
true passions are selfish. Moreover she was expecting every moment
an avowal of the anonymous letter which he had received overnight,
and this avowal never came. To gain complete confidence, Madame de
Rênal required to know what ideas might have been suggested to the
man upon whom her fate depended. For, in the country, husbands
control public opinion. A husband who denounces his wife covers
himself with ridicule, a thing that every day is becoming less
dangerous in France; but his wife, if he does not supply her with
money, declines to the position of a working woman at fifteen sous
daily, and even then the virtuous souls have scruples about
employing her.</p>

<p>An odalisque in the seraglio may love the Sultan with all her
heart; he is all powerful, she has no hope of evading his authority
by a succession of clever little tricks. The master's vengeance is
terrible, bloody, but martial and noble: a dagger blow ends
everything. It is with blows dealt by public contempt that a
husband kills his wife in the nineteenth century; it is by shutting
the doors of all the drawing-rooms in her face.</p>

<p>The sense of danger was keenly aroused in Madame de Rênal on her
return to her own room; she was horrified by the disorder in which
she found it. The locks of all her pretty little boxes had been
broken; several planks in the floor had been torn up. 'He would
have been without pity for me!' she told herself. 'To spoil so this
floor of coloured parquet, of which he is so proud; when one of his
children comes in with muddy shoes, he flushes with rage. And now
it is ruined for ever!' The sight of this violence rapidly silenced
the last reproaches with which she had been blaming herself for her
too rapid victory.</p>

<p>Shortly before the dinner bell sounded, Julien returned with the
children. At dessert, when the servants had left the room, Madame
de Rênal said to him very drily:</p>

<p>'You expressed the desire to me to go and spend a fortnight at
Verrières; M. de Rênal is kind enough to grant you leave. You can
go as soon as you please. But, so that the children shall not waste
any time, their lessons will be sent to you every day, for you to
correct.'</p>

<p>'Certainly,' M. de Rênal added in a most bitter tone, 'I shall
not allow you more than a week.'</p>

<p>Julien read in his features the uneasiness of a man in cruel
torment.</p>

<p>'He has not yet come to a decision,' he said to his mistress,
during a moment of solitude in the drawing-room.</p>

<p>Madame de Rênal informed him rapidly of all that she had done
since the morning.</p>

<p>'The details tonight,' she added laughing.</p>

<p>'The perversity of woman!' thought Julien. 'What pleasure, what
instinct leads them to betray us?</p>

<p>'I find you at once enlightened and blinded by your love,' he
said to her with a certain coldness; 'your behaviour today has been
admirable; but is there any prudence in our attempting to see each
other tonight? This house is paved with enemies; think of the
passionate hatred that Elisa has for me.'</p>

<p>'That hatred greatly resembles the passionate indifference that
you must have for me.'</p>

<p>'Indifferent or not, I am bound to save you from a peril into
which I have plunged you. If chance decrees that M. de Rênal speaks
to Elisa, by a single word she may disclose everything to him. What
is to prevent him from hiding outside my room, well armed...'</p>

<p>'What! Lacking in courage even!' said Madame de Rênal, with all
the pride of a woman of noble birth.</p>

<p>'I shall never sink so low as to speak of my courage,' said
Julien coldly, 'that is mean. Let the world judge by my actions.
But,' he went on, taking her hand, 'you cannot conceive how
attached I am to you, and what a joy it is to me to be able to take
leave of you before this cruel parting.'</p>

<h2><a name="ch22" id="ch22"></a>Chapter 22. Manners and Customs in
1830</h2>

<p style="margin-left:10%">Speech was given to man<br>
to enable him to conceal his thoughts.<br>
&mdash;MALAGRIDA, S.J.</p>

<p>The first thing that Julien did on arriving in Verrières was to
reproach himself for his unfairness to Madame de Rênal. 'I should
have despised her as a foolish woman if from weakness she had
failed to bring off the scene with M. de Rênal! She carried it
through like a diplomat, and my sympathies are with the loser, who
is my enemy. There is a streak of middle-class pettiness in my
nature; my vanity is hurt, because M. de Rênal is a man! That vast
and illustrous corporation to which I have the honour to belong; I
am a perfect fool.'</p>

<p>M. Chélan had refused the offers of hospitality which the most
respected Liberals of the place had vied with one another in making
him, when his deprivation drove him from the presbytery. The pair
of rooms which he had taken were littered with his books. Julien,
wishing to show Verrières what it meant to be a priest, went and
fetched from his father's store a dozen planks of firwood, which he
carried on his back the whole length of the main street. He
borrowed some tools from an old friend and had soon constructed a
sort of bookcase in which he arranged M. Chélan's library.</p>

<p>'I supposed you to have been corrupted by the vanity of the
world,' said the old man, shedding tears of joy; 'this quite
redeems the childishness of that dazzling guard of honour uniform
which made you so many enemies.'</p>

<p>M. de Rênal had told Julien to put up in his house. No one had
any suspicion of what had happened. On the third day after his
arrival, there came up to his room no less a personage than the
Sub-Prefect, M. de Maugiron. It was only after two solid hours of
insipid tittle-tattle, and long jeremiads on the wickedness of men,
on the lack of honesty in the people entrusted with the
administration of public funds, on the dangers besetting poor
France, etc., etc., that Julien saw him come at length to the
purpose of his visit. They were already on the landing, and the
poor tutor, on the verge of disgrace, was ushering out with all due
respect the future Prefect of some fortunate Department, when it
pleased the latter gentleman to occupy himself with Julien's
career, to praise his moderation where his own interests were
concerned, etc., etc. Finally M. de Maugiron, taking him in his
arms in the most fatherly manner, suggested to him that he should
leave M. de Rênal and enter the household of an official who had
children to educate, and who, like King Philip, would thank heaven,
not so much for having given him them as for having caused them to
be born in the neighbourhood of M. Julien. Their tutor would
receive a salary of eight hundred francs, payable not month by
month, 'which is not noble,' said M. de Maugiron, but quarterly,
and in advance to boot.</p>

<p>It was now the turn of Julien who, for an hour and a half, had
been waiting impatiently for an opportunity to speak. His reply was
perfect, and as long as a pastoral charge; it let everything be
understood, and at the same time said nothing definite. A listener
would have found in it at once respect for M. de Rênal, veneration
for the people of Verrières and gratitude towards the illustrious
Sub-Prefect. The said Sub-Prefect, astonished at finding a bigger
Jesuit than himself, tried in vain to obtain something positive.
Julien, overjoyed, seized the opportunity to try his skill and
began his answer over again in different terms. Never did the most
eloquent Minister, seeking to monopolise the last hours of a
sitting when the Chamber seems inclined to wake up, say less in
more words. As soon as M. de Maugiron had left him, Julien broke
out in helpless laughter. To make the most of his Jesuitical bent,
he wrote a letter of nine pages to M. de Rênal, in which he
informed him of everything that had been said to him, and humbly
asked his advice. 'Why, that rascal never even told me the name of
the person who is making the offer! It will be M. Valenod, who sees
in my banishment to Verrières the effect of his anonymous
letter.'</p>

<p>His missive dispatched, Julien, as happy as a hunter who at six
in the morning on a fine autumn day emerges upon a plain teeming
with game, went out to seek the advice of M. Chélan. But before he
arrived at the good curé's house, heaven, which was anxious to
shower its blessings on him, threw him into the arms of M. Valenod,
from whom he did not conceal the fact that his heart was torn; a
penniless youth like himself was bound to devote himself entirely
to the vocation which heaven had placed in his heart, but a
vocation was not everything in this vile world. To be a worthy
labourer in the Lord's vineyard, and not to be altogether unworthy
of all one's learned fellow-labourers, one required education; one
required to spend in the seminary at Besançon two very expensive
years; it became indispensable, therefore, to save money, which was
considerably easier with a salary of eight hundred francs paid
quarterly, than with six hundred francs which melted away month by
month. On the other hand, did not heaven, by placing him with the
Rênal boys, and above all by inspiring in him a particular
attachment to them, seem to indicate to him that it would be a
mistake to abandon this form of education for another?...</p>

<p>Julien arrived at such a pitch of perfection in this kind of
eloquence, which has taken the place of the swiftness of action of
the Empire, that he ended by growing tired of the sound of his own
voice.</p>

<p>Returning to the house he found one of M. Valenod's servants in
full livery, who had been looking for him all over the town, with a
note inviting him to dinner that very day.</p>

<p>Never had Julien set foot in the man's house; only a few days
earlier, his chief thought was how he might give him a thorough
good thrashing without subsequent action by the police. Although
dinner was not to be until one o'clock, Julien thought it more
respectful to present himself at half past twelve in the study of
the Governor of the Poorhouse. He found him displaying his
importance amid a mass of papers. His huge black whiskers, his
enormous quantity of hair, his night-cap poised askew on the top of
his head, his immense pipe, his embroidered slippers, the heavy
gold chains slung across his chest in every direction, and all the
equipment of a provincial financier, who imagines himself to be a
ladies' man, made not the slightest impression upon Julien; he only
thought all the more of the thrashing that he owed him.</p>

<p>He craved the honour of being presented to Madame Valenod; she
was making her toilet and could not see him. To make up for this,
he had the privilege of witnessing that of the Governor of the
Poorhouse. They then proceeded to join Madame Valenod, who
presented her children to him with tears in her eyes. This woman,
one of the most important people in Verrières, had a huge masculine
face, which she had plastered with rouge for this great ceremony.
She displayed all the pathos of maternal feelings.</p>

<p>Julien thought of Madame de Rênal. His distrustful nature made
him scarcely susceptible to any memories save those that are evoked
by contrast, but such memories moved him to tears. This tendency
was increased by the sight of the Governor's house. He was taken
through it. Everything in it was sumptuous and new, and he was told
the price of each article. But Julien felt that there was something
mean about it, a taint of stolen money. Everyone, even the
servants, wore a bold air that seemed to be fortifying them against
contempt.</p>

<p>The collector of taxes, the receiver of customs, the chief
constable and two or three other public officials arrived with
their wives. They were followed by several wealthy Liberals. Dinner
was announced. Julien, already in the worst of humours, suddenly
reflected that on the other side of the dining-room wall there were
wretched prisoners, whose rations of meat had perhaps been squeezed
to purchase all this tasteless splendour with which his hosts
sought to dazzle him.</p>

<p>'They are hungry perhaps at this moment,' he said to himself;
his throat contracted, he found it impossible to eat and almost to
speak. It was much worse a quarter of an hour later; they could
hear in the distance a few snatches of a popular and, it must be
admitted, not too refined song which one of the inmates was
singing. M. Valenod glanced at one of his men in full livery, who
left the room, and presently the sound of singing ceased. At that
moment, a footman offered Julien some Rhine wine in a green glass,
and Madame Valenod took care to inform him that this wine cost nine
francs the bottle, direct from the grower. Julien, the green glass
in his hand, said to M. Valenod:</p>

<p>'I don't hear that horrid song any more.'</p>

<p>'Gad! I should think not, indeed,' replied the Governor
triumphantly. 'I've made the rascal shut up.'</p>

<p>This was too much for Julien; he had acquired the manners but
had not yet the heart appropriate to his station. Despite all his
hypocrisy, which he kept in such constant practice, he felt a large
tear trickle down his cheek.</p>

<p>He tried to hide it with the green glass, but it was simply
impossible for him to do honour to the Rhine wine. 'Stop the man
singing!' he murmured to himself, 'O my God, and Thou permittest
it!'</p>

<p>Fortunately for him, no one noticed his ill-bred emotion. The
collector of taxes had struck up a royalist ditty. During the
clamour of the refrain, sung in chorus: 'There,' Julien's
conscience warned him, 'you have the sordid fortune which you will
achieve, and you will enjoy it only in these conditions and in such
company as this! You will have a place worth perhaps twenty
thousand francs, but it must be that while you gorge to repletion
you stop the poor prisoner from singing; you will give dinner
parties with the money you have filched from his miserable
pittance, and during your dinner he will be more wretched still! O
Napoleon! How pleasant it was in your time to climb to fortune
through the dangers of a battle; but meanly to intensify the
sufferings of the wretched!'</p>

<p>I admit that the weakness which Julien displays in this
monologue gives me a poor opinion of him. He would be a worthy
colleague for those conspirators in yellow gloves, who profess to
reform all the conditions of life in a great country, and would be
horrified at having to undergo the slightest inconvenience
themselves.</p>

<p>Julien was sharply recalled to his proper part. It was not that
he might dream and say nothing that he had been invited to dine in
such good company.</p>

<p>A retired calico printer, a corresponding member of the Academy
of Besançon and of that of Uzes, was speaking to him, down the
whole length of the table, inquiring whether all that was commonly
reported as to his astonishing prowess in the study of the New
Testament was true.</p>

<p>A profound silence fell instantly; a New Testament appeared as
though by magic in the hands of the learned member of the two
academies. Julien having answered in the affirmative, a few words
in Latin were read out to him at random. He began to recite: his
memory did not betray him, and this prodigy was admired with all
the noisy energy of the end of a dinner. Julien studied the glowing
faces of the women. Several of them were not ill-looking. He had
made out the wife of the collector who sang so well.</p>

<p>'Really, I am ashamed to go on speaking Latin so long before
these ladies,' he said, looking at her. 'If M. Rubigneau' (this was
the member of the two academies) 'will be so good as to read out
any sentence in Latin, instead of going on with the Latin text, I
shall endeavour to improvise a translation.'</p>

<p>This second test set the crown of glory on his achievement.</p>

<p>There were in the room a number of Liberals, men of means, but
the happy fathers of children who were capable of winning
bursaries, and in this capacity suddenly converted after the last
Mission. Despite this brilliant stroke of policy, M. de Rênal had
never consented to have them in his house. These worthy folk, who
knew Julien only by reputation and from having seen him on
horseback on the day of the King of &mdash;&mdash;'s visit, were
his most vociferous admirers. 'When will these fools tire of
listening to this Biblical language, of which they understand
nothing?' he thought. On the contrary, this language amused them by
its unfamiliarity; they laughed at it. But Julien had grown
tired.</p>

<p>He rose gravely as six o'clock struck and mentioned a chapter of
the new theology of Liguori, which he had to learn by heart in
order to repeat it next day to M. Chélan. 'For my business,' he
added pleasantly, 'is to make other people repeat lessons, and to
repeat them myself.'</p>

<p>His audience laughed heartily and applauded; this is the kind of
wit that goes down at Verrières. Julien was by this time on his
feet, everyone else rose, regardless of decorum; such is the power
of genius. Madame Valenod kept him for a quarter of an hour longer;
he really must hear the children repeat their catechism; they made
the most absurd mistakes which he alone noticed. He made no attempt
to correct them. 'What ignorance of the first principles of
religion,' he thought. At length he said good-bye and thought that
he might escape; but the children must next attempt one of La
Fontaine's Fables.</p>

<p>'That author is most immoral,' Julien said to Madame Valenod;
'in one of his Fables on Messire Jean Chouart, he has ventured to
heap ridicule on all that is most venerable. He is strongly
reproved by the best commentators.'</p>

<p>Before leaving the house Julien received four or five
invitations to dinner. 'This young man does honour to the
Department,' his fellow-guests, in great hilarity, were all
exclaiming at once. They went so far as to speak of a pension voted
out of the municipal funds, to enable him to continue his studies
in Paris.</p>

<p>While this rash idea was making the dining-room ring, Julien had
stolen away to the porch. 'Oh, what scum! What scum!' he murmured
three or four times, as he treated himself to the pleasure of
drinking in the fresh air.</p>

<p>He felt himself a thorough aristocrat for the moment, he who for
long had been so shocked by the disdainful smile and the haughty
superiority which he found lurking behind all the compliments that
were paid him at M. de Rênal's. He could not help feeling the
extreme difference. 'Even if we forget,' he said to himself as he
walked away, 'that the money has been stolen from the poor
prisoners, and that they are forbidden to sing as well, would it
ever occur to M. de Rênal to tell his guests the price of each
bottle of wine that he offers them? And this M. Valenod, in going
over the list of his property, which he does incessantly, cannot
refer to his house, his land and all the rest of it, if his wife is
present, without saying your house, your land.'</p>

<p>This lady, apparently so conscious of the joy of ownership, had
just made an abominable scene, during dinner, with a servant who
had broken a wineglass and spoiled one of her sets; and the servant
had answered her with the most gross insolence.</p>

<p>'What a household!' thought Julien; 'if they were to give me
half of all the money they steal, I wouldn't live among them. One
fine day I should give myself away; I should be unable to keep back
the contempt they inspire in me.'</p>

<p>He was obliged, nevertheless, obeying Madame de Rênal's orders,
to attend several dinners of this sort; Julien was the fashion;
people forgave him his uniform and the guard of honour, or rather
that imprudent display was the true cause of his success. Soon, the
only question discussed in Verrières was who would be successful in
the struggle to securé the learned young man's services, M. de
Rênal or the Governor of the Poorhouse. These two gentlemen formed
with M. Maslon a triumvirate which for some years past had
tyrannised the town. People were jealous of the Mayor, the Liberals
had grounds for complaint against him; but after all he was noble
and created to fill a superior station, whereas M. Valenod's father
had not left him an income of six hundred livres. He had been
obliged to pass from the stage of being pitied for the shabby
apple-green coat in which everybody remembered him in his younger
days to that of being envied for his Norman horses, his gold
chains, the clothes he ordered from Paris, in short, all his
present prosperity.</p>

<p>In the welter of this world so new to Julien he thought he had
discovered an honest man; this was a geometrician, was named Gros
and was reckoned a Jacobin. Julien, having made a vow never to say
anything except what he himself believed to be false, was obliged
to make a show of being suspicious of M. Gros. He received from
Vergy large packets of exercises. He was advised to see much of his
father, and complied with this painful necessity. In a word, he was
quite redeeming his reputation, when one morning he was greatly
surprised to find himself awakened by a pair of hands which were
clapped over his eyes.</p>

<p>It was Madame de Rênal who had come in to town and, running
upstairs four steps at a time and leaving her children occupied
with a favourite rabbit that they had brought with them, had
reached Julien's room a minute in advance of them. The moment was
delicious but all too brief: Madame de Rênal had vanished when the
children arrived with the rabbit, which they wanted to show to
their friend. Julien welcomed them all, including the rabbit. He
seemed to be once more one of a family party; he felt that he loved
these children, that it amused him to join in their chatter. He was
amazed by the sweetness of their voices, the simplicity and
nobility of their manners; he required to wash his imagination
clean of all the vulgar behaviour, all the unpleasant thoughts the
atmosphere of which he had to breathe at Verrières. There was
always the dread of bankruptcy, wealth and poverty were always
fighting for the upper hand. The people with whom he dined, in
speaking of the joint on their table, made confidences humiliating
to themselves, and nauseating to their hearers.</p>

<p>'You aristocrats, you have every reason to be proud,' he said to
Madame de Rênal. And he told her of all the dinners he had
endured.</p>

<p>'Why, so you are in the fashion!' And she laughed heartily at
the thought of the rouge which Madame Valenod felt herself obliged
to put on whenever she expected Julien. 'I believe she has designs
on your heart,' she added.</p>

<p>Luncheon was a joy. The presence of the children, albeit
apparently a nuisance, increased as a matter of fact the general
enjoyment. These poor children did not know how to express their
delight at seeing Julien again. The servants had not failed to
inform them that he was being offered two hundred francs more to
educate the little Valenods.</p>

<p>In the middle of luncheon, Stanislas Xavier, still pale after
his serious illness, suddenly asked his mother what was the value
of his silver spoon and fork and of the mug out of which he was
drinking.</p>

<p>'Why do you want to know?'</p>

<p>'I want to sell them to give the money to M. Julien, so that he
shan't be a <i>dupe</i> to stay with us.'</p>

<p>Julien embraced him, the tears standing in his eyes. The mother
wept outright, while Julien, who had taken Stanislas on his knees,
explained to him that he must not use the word <i>dupe</i>, which,
employed in that sense, was a servant's expression. Seeing the
pleasure he was giving Madame de Rênal, he tried to explain, by
picturesque examples, which amused the children, what was meant by
a dupe.</p>

<p>'I understand,' said Stanislas, 'it's the crow who is silly and
drops his cheese, which is picked up by the fox, who is a
flatterer.'</p>

<p>Madame de Rênal, wild with joy, smothered her children in
kisses, which she could hardly do without leaning slightly upon
Julien.</p>

<p>Suddenly the door opened; it was M. de Rênal. His stern, angry
face formed a strange contrast with the innocent gaiety which his
presence banished. Madame de Rênal turned pale; she felt herself
incapable of denying anything. Julien seized the opportunity and,
speaking very loud, began to tell the Mayor the incident of the
silver mug which Stanislas wanted to sell. He was sure that this
story would be ill received. At the first word M. de Rênal frowned,
from force of habit at the mere name of silver. 'The mention of
that metal,' he would say, 'is always a preliminary to some call
upon my purse.'</p>

<p>But here there was more than money at stake; there was an
increase of his suspicions. The air of happiness which animated his
family in his absence was not calculated to improve matters with a
man dominated by so sensitive a vanity. When his wife praised the
graceful and witty manner in which Julien imparted fresh ideas to
his pupils:</p>

<p>'Yes, yes, I know, he is making me odious to my children; it is
very easy for him to be a hundred times pleasanter to them than I,
who am, after all, the master. Everything tends in these days to
bring <i>lawful</i> authority into contempt. Unhappy France!'</p>

<p>Madame de Rênal did not stop to examine the implications of her
husband's manner. She had just seen the possibility of spending
twelve hours in Julien's company. She had any number of purchases
to make in the town, and declared that she absolutely must dine in
a tavern; in spite of anything her husband might say or do, she
clung to her idea. The children were in ecstasies at the mere word
tavern, which modern prudery finds such pleasure in
pronouncing.</p>

<p>M. de Rênal left his wife in the first linen-draper's shop that
she entered, to go and pay some calls. He returned more gloomy than
in the morning; he was convinced that the whole town was thinking
about nothing but himself and Julien. As a matter of fact, no one
had as yet allowed him to form any suspicion of the offensive
element in the popular comments. Those that had been repeated to
the Mayor had dealt exclusively with the question whether Julien
would remain with him at six hundred francs or would accept the
eight hundred francs offered by the Governor of the Poorhouse.</p>

<p>The said Governor, when he met M. de Rênal in society, gave him
the cold shoulder. His behaviour was not without a certain
subtlety; there is not much thoughtless action in the provinces:
sensations are so infrequent there that people suppress them.</p>

<p>M. Valenod was what is called, a hundred leagues from Paris, a
<i>faraud</i>: this is a species marked by coarseness and natural
effrontery. His triumphant existence, since 1815, had confirmed him
in his habits. He reigned, so to speak, at Verrières, under the
orders of M. de Rênal; but being far more active, blushing at
nothing, interfering in everything, everlastingly going about,
writing, speaking, forgetting humiliations, having no personal
pretensions, he had succeeded in equalling the credit of his Mayor
in the eyes of ecclesiastical authority. M. Valenod had as good as
told the grocers of the place: 'Give me the two biggest fools among
you'; the lawyers: 'Point me out the two most ignorant'; the
officers of health: 'Let me have your two biggest rascals.' When he
had collected the most shameless representatives of each
profession, he had said to them: 'Let us reign together.'</p>

<p>The manners of these men annoyed M. de Rênal. Valenod's coarse
nature was offended by nothing, not even when the young abbe Maslon
gave him the lie direct in public.</p>

<p>But, in the midst of this prosperity, M. Valenod was obliged to
fortify himself by little insolences in points of detail against
the harsh truths which he was well aware that everyone was entitled
to address to him. His activity had multiplied since the alarms
which M. Appert's visit had left in its wake. He had made three
journeys to Besançon; he wrote several letters for each mail; he
sent others by unknown messengers who came to his house at
nightfall. He had been wrong perhaps in securing the deprivation of
the old curé Chélan; for this vindictive action had made him be
regarded, by several pious ladies of good birth, as a profoundly
wicked man. Moreover this service rendered had placed him in the
absolute power of the Vicar-General de Frilair, from whom he
received strange orders. He had reached this stage in his career
when he yielded to the pleasure of writing an anonymous letter. To
add to his embarrassment, his wife informed him that she wished to
have Julien in the house; the idea appealed to her vanity.</p>

<p>In this situation, M. Valenod foresaw a final rupture with his
former confederate M. de Rênal. The Mayor would address him in
harsh language, which mattered little enough to him; but he might
write to Besançon, or even to Paris. A cousin of some Minister or
other might suddenly descend upon Verrières and take over the
Governorship of the Poorhouse. M. Valenod thought of making friends
with the Liberals; it was for this reason that several of them were
invited to the dinner at which Julien recited. He would find
powerful support there against the Mayor. But an election might
come, and it went without saying that the Poorhouse and a vote for
the wrong party were incompatible. The history of these tactics,
admirably divined by Madame de Rênal, had been imparted to Julien
while he gave her his arm to escort her from one shop to another,
and little by little had carried them to the Cours de la Fidélité,
where they spent some hours, almost as peaceful as the hours at
Vergy.</p>

<p>At this period, M. Valenod was seeking to avoid a final rupture
with his former chief, by himself adopting a bold air towards him.
On the day of which we treat, this system proved successful, but
increased the Mayor's ill humour.</p>

<p>Never can vanity, at grips with all the nastiest and shabbiest
elements of a petty love of money, have plunged a man in a more
wretched state than that in which M. de Rênal found himself, at the
moment of his entering the tavern. Never, on the contrary, had his
children been gayer or more joyful. The contrast goaded him to
fury.</p>

<p>'I am not wanted in my own family, so far as I can see!' he said
as he entered, in a tone which he sought to make imposing.</p>

<p>By way of reply, his wife drew him aside and explained to him
the necessity of getting rid of Julien. The hours of happiness she
had just enjoyed had given her back the ease and resolution
necessary for carrying out the plan of conduct which she had been
meditating for the last fortnight. What really and completely
dismayed the poor Mayor of Verrières was that he knew that people
joked publicly in the town at the expense of his attachment to
<i>hard cash</i>: M. Valenod was as generous as a robber, whereas
he had shown himself in a prudent rather than a brilliant light in
the last five or six subscription lists for the Confraternity of
Saint Joseph, the Congregation of Our Lady, the Congregation of the
Blessed Sacrament, and so forth.</p>

<p>Among the country gentlemen of Verrières and the neighbourhood,
skilfully classified in the lists compiled by the collecting
Brethren, according to the amount of their offerings, the name of
M. de Rênal had more than once been seen figuring upon the lowest
line. In vain might he protest that he <i>earned nothing</i>. The
clergy allow no joking on that subject.</p>

Official</h2>

<p style="margin-left:10%">Il piacere di alzar la testa tutto<br>
l'anno e ben pagato da certi quarti d'ora che bisogna passar.<br>
&mdash;CASTI</p>

<p>But let us leave this little man to his little fears; why has he
taken into his house a man of feeling, when what he required was
the soul of a flunkey? Why does he not know how to select his
servants? The ordinary procedure of the nineteenth century is that
when a powerful and noble personage encounters a man of feeling, he
kills, exiles, imprisons or so humiliates him that the other, like
a fool, dies of grief. In this instance it so happens that it is
not yet the man of feeling who suffers. The great misfortune of the
small towns of France and of elected governments, like that of New
York, is an inability to forget that there exist in the world
persons like M. de Rênal. In a town of twenty thousand inhabitants,
these men form public opinion, and public opinion is a terrible
force in a country that has the Charter. A man endowed with a noble
soul, of generous instincts, who would have been your friend did he
not live a hundred leagues away, judges you by the public opinion
of your town, which is formed by the fools whom chance has made
noble, rich and moderate. Woe to him who distinguishes himself!</p>

<p>Immediately after dinner, they set off again for Vergy; but, two
days later, Julien saw the whole family return to Verrières.</p>

<p>An hour had not gone by before, greatly to his surprise, he
discovered that Madame de Rênal was making a mystery of something.
She broke off her conversations with her husband as soon as he
appeared, and seemed almost to wish him to go away. Julien did not
wait to be told twice. He became cold and reserved; Madame de Rênal
noticed this, and did not seek an explanation. 'Is she going to
provide me with a successor?' thought Julien. 'Only the day before
yesterday, she was so intimate with me! But they say that this is
how great ladies behave. They are like kings, no one receives so
much attention as the minister who, on going home, finds the letter
announcing his dismissal.'</p>

<p>Julien remarked that in these conversations, which ceased
abruptly on his approach, there was frequent mention of a big house
belonging to the municipality of Verrières, old, but large and
commodious, and situated opposite the church, in the most valuable
quarter of the town. 'What connection can there be between that
house and a new lover?' Julien asked himself. In his distress of
mind, he repeated to himself those charming lines of Francois I,
which seemed to him new, because it was not a month since Madame de
Rênal had taught them to him. At that time, by how many vows, by
how many caresses had not each line been proved false!</p>

<p>Souvent femme varie<br>
Bien fol est qui s'y fie.</p>

<p>M. de Rênal set off by post for Besançon. This journey was
decided upon at two hours' notice, he seemed greatly troubled. On
his return, he flung a large bundle wrapped in grey paper on the
table.</p>

<p>'So much for that stupid business,' he said to his wife.</p>

<p>An hour later, Julien saw the bill-sticker carrying off this
large bundle; he followed him hastily. 'I shall learn the secret at
the first street corner.'</p>

<p>He waited impatiently behind the bill-sticker, who with his fat
brush was slapping paste on the back of the bill. No sooner was it
in its place than Julien's curiosity read on it the announcement in
full detail of the sale by public auction of the lease of that
large and old house which recurred so frequently in M. de Rênal's
conversations with his wife. The assignation was announced for the
following day at two o'clock, in the town hall, on the extinction
of the third light. Julien was greatly disappointed; he considered
the interval to be rather short: how could all the possible bidders
come to know of the sale in time? But apart from this, the bill,
which was dated a fortnight earlier and which he read from
beginning to end in three different places, told him nothing.</p>

<p>He went to inspect the vacant house. The porter, who did not see
him approach, was saying mysteriously to a friend:</p>

<p>'Bah! It's a waste of time. M. Maslon promised him he should
have it for three hundred francs; and as the Mayor kicked, he was
sent to the Bishop's Palace, by the Vicar-General de Frilair.'</p>

<p>Julien's appearance on the scene seemed greatly to embarrass the
two cronies, who did not say another word.</p>

<p>Julien did not fail to attend the auction. There was a crowd of
people in an ill-lighted room; but everyone eyed his neighbours in
a singular fashion. Every eye was fixed on a table, where Julien
saw, on a pewter plate, three lighted candle-ends. The crier was
shouting: 'Three hundred francs, gentlemen!'</p>

<p>'Three hundred francs! It is too bad!' one man murmured to
another. Julien was standing between them. 'It is worth more than
eight hundred; I am going to cover the bid.'</p>

<p>'It's cutting off your nose to spite your face. What are you
going to gain by bringing M. Maslon, M. Valenod, the Bishop, his
terrible Vicar-General de Frilair and the whole of their gang down
upon you?'</p>

<p>'Three hundred and twenty,' the other shouted.</p>

<p>'Stupid idiot!' retorted his neighbour. 'And here's one of the
Mayor's spies,' he added pointing at Julien.</p>

<p>Julien turned sharply to rebuke him for this speech; but the two
Franc-Comtois paid no attention to him. Their coolness restored his
own. At this moment the last candle-end went out, and the drawling
voice of the crier assigned the house for a lease of nine years to
M. de Saint-Giraud, chief secretary at the Prefecture of
&mdash;&mdash;, and for three hundred and thirty francs.</p>

<p>As soon as the Mayor had left the room, the discussion
began.</p>

<p>'That's thirty francs Grogeot's imprudence has earned for the
town,' said one.</p>

<p>'But M. de Saint-Giraud,' came the answer, 'will have his
revenge on Grogeot, he will pass it on.'</p>

<p>'What a scandal,' said a stout man on Julien's left: 'a house
for which I'ld have given, myself, eight hundred francs as a
factory, and then it would have been a bargain.'</p>

<p>'Bah!' replied a young Liberal manufacturer, 'isn't M. de
Saint-Giraud one of the <i>Congregation</i>? Haven't his four
children all got bursaries? Poor man! The town of Verrières is
simply bound to increase his income with an allowance of five
hundred francs; that is all.'</p>

<p>'And to think that the Mayor hasn't been able to stop it!'
remarked a third. 'For he may be an Ultra, if you like, but he's
not a thief.'</p>

<p>'He's not a thief?' put in another; 'it's a regular thieves'
kitchen. Everything goes into a common fund, and is divided up at
the end of the year. But there's young Sorel; let us get away.'</p>

<p>Julien went home in the worst of tempers; he found Madame de
Rênal greatly depressed.</p>

<p>'Have you come from the sale?' she said to him.</p>

<p>'Yes, Ma'am, where I had the honour to be taken for the Mayor's
spy.'</p>

<p>'If he had taken my advice, he would have gone away
somewhere.'</p>

<p>At that moment, M. de Rênal appeared; he was very sombre. Dinner
was eaten in silence. M. de Rênal told Julien to accompany the
children to Vergy; they travelled in unbroken gloom. Madame de
Rênal tried to comfort her husband.</p>

<p>'Surely you are accustomed to it, my dear.'</p>

<p>That evening, they were seated in silence round the domestic
hearth; the crackle of the blazing beech logs was their sole
distraction. It was one of those moments of depression which are to
be found in the most united families. One of the children uttered a
joyful cry.</p>

<p>'There's the bell! The bell!'</p>

<p>'Egad, if it's M. de Saint-Giraud come to get hold of me, on the
excuse of thanking me, I shall give him a piece of my mind; it's
too bad. It's Valenod that he has to thank, and it is I who am
compromised. What am I going to say if those pestilent Jacobin
papers get hold of the story, and make me out a M. Nonante-Cinq?'
[Footnote by C. K. S. M.: M. Marsan explains this allusion to a
satire by Barthelemy at the expense of the Marseilles magistrate
Merindol, who in sentencing him to a fine had made use of the
Common Southern expression 'Nonante-cinq' for
'Quatre-vingt-quinze.]</p>

<p>A good-looking man, with bushy black whiskers, entered the room
at this moment in the wake of the servant.</p>

<p>'M. le Maire, I am Signor Geronimo. Here is a letter which M. le
Chevalier de Beauvaisis, attache at the Embassy at Naples, gave me
for you when I came away; it is only nine days ago,' Signor
Geronimo added, with a sprightly air, looking at Madame de Rênal.
'Signor de Beauvaisis, your cousin, and my good friend, Madame,
tells me that you know Italian.'</p>

<p>The good humour of the Neapolitan changed this dull evening into
one that was extremely gay. Madame de Rênal insisted upon his
taking supper. She turned the whole house upside down; she wished
at all costs to distract Julien's thoughts from the description of
him as a spy which twice in that day he had heard ringing in his
ear. Signer Geronimo was a famous singer, a man used to good
company, and at the same time the best of company himself,
qualities which, in France, have almost ceased to be compatible. He
sang after supper a little duet with Madame de Rênal. He told
charming stories. At one o'clock in the morning the children
protested when Julien proposed that they should go to bed.</p>

<p>'Just this story,' said the eldest.</p>

<p>'It is my own, Signorino,' replied Signer Geronimo. 'Eight years
ago I was, like you, a young scholar in the Conservatorio of
Naples, by which I mean that I was your age; for I had not the
honour to be the son of the eminent Mayor of the beautiful town of
Verrières.'</p>

<p>This allusion drew a sigh from M. de Rênal, who looked at his
wife.</p>

<p>'Signer Zingarelli,' went on the young singer, speaking with a
slightly exaggerated accent which made the children burst out
laughing, 'Signor Zingarelli is an exceedingly severe master. He is
not loved at the Conservatorio; but he makes them act always as
though they loved him. I escaped whenever I could; I used to go to
the little theatre of San Carlino, where I used to hear music fit
for the gods: but, O heavens, how was I to scrape together the
eight soldi which were the price of admission to the pit? An
enormous sum,' he said, looking at the children, and the children
laughed again. 'Signer Giovannone, the Director of San Carlino,
heard me sing. I was sixteen years old. "This boy is a treasure,"
he said.</p>

<p>'"Would you like me to engage you, my friend?" he said to me one
day.</p>

<p>'"How much will you give me?"</p>

<p>'"Forty ducats a month." That, gentlemen, is one hundred and
sixty francs. I seemed to see the heavens open.</p>

<p>'"But how," I said to Giovannone, "am I to persuade the strict
Zingarelli to let me go?"</p>

<p>'"<i>Lascia fare a me</i>."'</p>

<p>'Leave it to me!' cried the eldest of the children.</p>

<p>'Precisely, young Sir. Signor Giovannone said to me: "First of
all, <i>caro</i>, a little agreement." I signed the paper: he gave
me three ducats. I had never seen so much money. Then he told me
what I must do.</p>

<p>'Next day, I demanded an interview with the terrible Signer
Zingarelli. His old servant showed me into the room.</p>

<p>'"What do you want with me, you scapegrace?" said
Zingarelli.</p>

<p>'"<i>Maestro</i>" I told him, "I repent of my misdeeds; never
again will I break out of the Conservatorio by climbing over the
iron railings. I am going to study twice as hard."</p>

<p>'"If I were not afraid of spoiling the finest bass voice I have
ever heard, I should lock you up on bread and water for a
fortnight, you scoundrel."</p>

<p>'"<i>Maestro</i>" I went on, "I am going to be a model to the
whole school, <i>credete a me</i>. But I ask one favour of you, if
anyone comes to ask for me to sing outside, refuse him. Please say
that you cannot allow it."</p>

<p>'"And who do you suppose is going to ask for a good for nothing
like you? Do you think I shall ever allow you to leave the
Conservatorio? Do you wish to make a fool of me? Off with you, off
with you!" he said, aiming a kick at my hindquarters, "or it will
be bread and water in a cell."</p>

<p>'An hour later, Signer Giovannone came to call on the
Director.</p>

<p>'"I have come to ask you to make my fortune," he began, "let me
have Geronimo. If he sings in my theatre this winter I give my
daughter in marriage."</p>

<p>'"What do you propose to do with the rascal?" Zingarelli asked
him. "I won't allow it. You shan't have him; besides, even if I
consented, he would never be willing to leave the Conservatorio;
he's just told me so himself."</p>

<p>'"If his willingness is all that matters," said Giovannone
gravely, producing my agreement from his pocket, "<i>carta
canta</i>! Here is his signature."</p>

<p>'Immediately Zingarelli, furious, flew to the bell-rope: "Turn
Geronimo out of the Conservatorio," he shouted, seething with rage.
So out they turned me, I splitting my sides with laughter. That
same evening, I sang the <i>aria del Moltiplico</i>. Polichinelle
intends to marry, and counts up on his fingers the different things
he will need for the house, and loses count afresh at every
moment.'</p>

<p>'Oh, won't you, Sir, please sing us that air?' said Madame de
Rênal.</p>

<p>Geronimo sang, and his audience all cried with laughter.</p>

<p>Signor Geronimo did not go to bed until two in the morning,
leaving the family enchanted with his good manners, his obliging
nature and his gay spirits.</p>

<p>Next day M. and Madame de Rênal gave him the letters which he
required for the French Court.</p>

<p>'And so, falsehood everywhere,' said Julien. 'There is Signor
Geronimo on his way to London with a salary of sixty thousand
francs. But for the cleverness of the Director of San Carlino, his
divine voice might not have been known and admired for another ten
years, perhaps...Upon my soul, I would rather be a Geronimo than a
Rênal. He is not so highly honoured in society, but he has not the
humiliation of having to grant leases like that one today, and his
is a merry life.'</p>

<p>One thing astonished Julien: the weeks of solitude spent at
Verrières, in M. de Rênal's house, had been for him a time of
happiness. He had encountered disgust and gloomy thoughts only at
the dinners to which he had been invited; in that empty house, was
he not free to read, write, meditate, undisturbed? He had not been
aroused at every moment from his radiant dreams by the cruel
necessity of studying the motions of a base soul, and that in order
to deceive it by hypocritical words or actions.</p>

<p>'Could happiness be thus within my reach?...The cost of such a
life is nothing; I can, as I choose, marry Miss Elisa, or become
Fouque's partner...But the traveller who has just climbed a steep
mountain, sits down on the summit, and finds a perfect pleasure in
resting. Would he be happy if he were forced to rest always?'</p>

<p>Madame de Rênal's mind was a prey to carking thoughts. In spite
of her resolve to the contrary, she had revealed to Julien the
whole business of the lease. 'So he will make me forget all my
vows!' she thought.</p>

<p>She would have given her life without hesitation to save that of
her husband, had she seen him in peril. Hers was one of those noble
and romantic natures, for which to see the possibility of a
generous action, and not to perform it gives rise to a remorse
almost equal to that which one feels for a past crime.
Nevertheless, there were dreadful days on which she could not
banish the thought of the absolute happiness which she would enjoy,
if, suddenly left a widow, she were free to marry Julien.</p>

<p>He loved her children far more than their father; in spite of
his strict discipline, he was adored by them. She was well aware
that, if she married Julien, she would have to leave this Vergy
whose leafy shade was so dear to her. She pictured herself living
in Paris, continuing to provide her sons with that education at
which everyone marvelled. Her children, she herself, Julien, all
perfectly happy.</p>

<p>A strange effect of marriage, such as the nineteenth century has
made it! The boredom of married life inevitably destroys love, when
love has preceded marriage. And yet, as a philosopher has observed,
it speedily brings about, among people who are rich enough not to
have to work, an intense boredom with all quiet forms of enjoyment.
And it is only dried up hearts, among women, that it does not
predispose to love.</p>

<p>The philosopher's observation makes me excuse Madame de Rênal,
but there was no excuse for her at Verrières, and the whole town,
without her suspecting it, was exclusively occupied with the
scandal of her love. Thanks to this great scandal, people that
autumn were less bored than usual.</p>

<p>The autumn, the first weeks of winter had soon come and gone. It
was time to leave the woods of Vergy. The high society of Verrières
began to grow indignant that its anathemas were making so little
impression upon M. de Rênal. In less than a week, certain grave
personages who made up for their habitual solemnity by giving
themselves the pleasure of fulfilling missions of this sort,
implanted in him the most cruel suspicions, but without going
beyond the most measured terms.</p>

<p>M. Valenod, who was playing a close game, had placed Elisa with
a noble and highly respected family, which included five women.
Elisa fearing, she said, that she might not find a place during the
winter, had asked this family for only about two thirds of what she
was receiving at the Mayor's. Of her own accord, the girl had the
excellent idea of going to confess to the retired curé Chélan as
well as to the new curé, so as to be able to give them both a
detailed account of Julien's amours.</p>

<p>On the morning after his return, at six o'clock, the abbe Chélan
sent for Julien:</p>

<p>'I ask you nothing,' he said to him; 'I beg you, and if need be
order you to tell me nothing, I insist that within three days you
leave either for the Seminary at Besançon or for the house of your
friend Fouque, who is still willing to provide a splendid career
for you. I have foreseen and settled everything, but you must go,
and not return to Verrières for a year.'</p>

<p>Julien made no answer; he was considering whether his honour
ought to take offence at the arrangements which M. Chélan, who
after all was not his father, had made for him.</p>

<p>'Tomorrow at this hour I shall have the honour of seeing you
again,' he said at length to the curé.</p>

<p>M. Chélan, who reckoned upon overcoming the young man by main
force, spoke volubly. His attitude, his features composed in the
utmost humility, Julien did not open his mouth.</p>

<p>At length he made his escape, and hastened to inform Madame de
Rênal, whom he found in despair. Her husband had just been speaking
to her with a certain frankness. The natural weakness of his
character, seeking encouragement in the prospect of the inheritance
from Besançon, had made him decide to regard her as entirely
innocent. He had just confessed to her the strange condition in
which he found public opinion at Verrières. The public were wrong,
had been led astray by envious ill-wishers, but what was to be
done?</p>

<p>Madame de Rênal had the momentary illusion that Julien might be
able to accept M. Valenod's offer, and remain at Verrières. But she
was no longer the simple, timid woman of the previous year; her
fatal passion, her spells of remorse had enlightened her. Soon she
had to bear the misery of proving to herself, while she listened to
her husband, that a separation, at any rate for the time being, was
now indispensable. 'Away from me, Julien will drift back into those
ambitious projects that are so natural when one has nothing. And I,
great God! I am so rich, and so powerless to securé my own
happiness! He will forget me. Charming as he is, he will be loved,
he will love. Ah, unhappy woman! Of what can I complain? Heaven is
just, I have not acquired merit by putting a stop to my crime; it
blinds my judgment. It rested with me alone to win over Elisa with
a bribe, nothing would have been easier. I did not take the trouble
to reflect for a moment, the wild imaginings of love absorbed all
my time. And now I perish.'</p>

<p>One thing struck Julien; as he conveyed to Madame de Rênal the
terrible news of his departure, he was met with no selfish
objection. Evidently she was making an effort not to cry.</p>

<p>'We require firmness, my friend.'</p>

<p>She cut off a lock of her hair.</p>

<p>'I do not know what is to become of me,' she said to him, 'but
if I die, promise me that you will never forget my children. Far or
near, try to make them grow up honourable men. If there is another
revolution, all the nobles will be murdered, their father may
emigrate, perhaps, because of that peasant who was killed upon a
roof. Watch over the family...Give me your hand. Farewell, my
friend! These are our last moments together. This great sacrifice
made, I hope that in public I shall have the courage to think of my
reputation.'</p>

<p>Julien had been expecting despair. The simplicity of this
farewell touched him.</p>

<p>'No, I do not accept your farewell thus. I shall go; they wish
it; you wish it yourself. But, three days after my departure, I
shall return to visit you by night.'</p>

<p>Madame de Rênal's existence was changed. So Julien really did
love her since he had had the idea, of his own accord, of seeing
her again. Her bitter grief changed into one of the keenest bursts
of joy that she had ever felt in her life. Everything became easy
to her. The certainty of seeing her lover again took from these
last moments all their lacerating force. From that instant the
conduct, like the features of Madame de Rênal was noble, firm, and
perfectly conventional.</p>

<p>M. de Rênal presently returned; he was beside himself. For the
first time he mentioned to his wife the anonymous letter which he
had received two months earlier.</p>

<p>'I intend to take it to the Casino, to show them all that it
comes from that wretch Valenod, whom I picked up out of the gutter
and made into one of the richest citizens of Verrières. I shall
disgrace him publicly, and then fight him. It is going too
far.'</p>

<p>'I might be left a widow, great God!' thought Madame de Rênal.
But almost at the same instant she said to herself: 'If I do not
prevent this duel, as I certainly can, I shall be my husband's
murderess.'</p>

<p>Never before had she handled his vanity with so much skill. In
less than two hours she made him see, always by the use of
arguments that had occurred first to him, that he must show himself
friendlier than ever towards M. Valenod, and even take Elisa into
the house again. Madame de Rênal required courage to make up her
mind to set eyes on this girl, the cause of all her troubles. But
the idea had come to her from Julien.</p>

<p>Finally, after having been set three or four times in the right
direction, M. de Rênal arrived of his own accord at the idea
(highly distressing, from the financial point of view) that the
most unpleasant thing that could happen for himself was that
Julien, amid the seething excitement and gossip of the whole of
Verrières, should remain there as tutor to M. Valenod's children.
It was obviously in Julien's interest to accept the offer made him
by the Governor of the Poorhouse. It was essential however to M. de
Rênal's fair fame that Julien should leave Verrières to enter the
seminary at Besançon or at Dijon. But how was he to be made to
agree, and after that how was he to maintain himself there?</p>

<p>M. de Rênal, seeing the imminence of a pecuniary sacrifice, was
in greater despair than his wife. For her part, after this
conversation, she was in the position of a man of feeling who,
weary of life, has taken a dose of <i>stramonium</i>: he ceases to
act, save, so to speak, automatically, and no longer takes an
interest in anything. Thus Louis XIV on his deathbed was led to
say: 'When I was king.' An admirable speech!</p>

<p>On the morrow, at break of day, M. de Rênal received an
anonymous letter. It was couched in the most insulting style. The
coarsest words applicable to his position stared from every line.
It was the work of some envious subordinate. This letter brought
him back to the thought of fighting a duel with M. Valenod. Soon
his courage had risen to the idea of an immediate execution of his
design. He left the house unaccompanied, and went to the gunsmith's
to procuré a brace of pistols, which he told the man to load.</p>

<p>'After all,' he said to himself, 'should the drastic rule of the
Emperor Napoleon be restored, I myself could not be charged with
the misappropriation of a halfpenny. At the most I have shut my
eyes; but I have plenty of letters in my desk authorising me to do
so.'</p>

<p>Madame de Rênal was frightened by her husband's cold anger, it
brought back to her mind the fatal thought of widowhood, which she
found it so hard to banish. She shut herself up with him. For hours
on end she pleaded with him in vain, the latest anonymous letter
had determined him. At length she succeeded in transforming the
courage required to strike M. Valenod into that required to offer
Julien six hundred francs for his maintenance for one year in a
Seminary. M. de Rênal, heaping a thousand curses on the day on
which he had conceived the fatal idea of taking a tutor into his
household, forgot the anonymous letter.</p>

<p>He found a grain of comfort in an idea which he did not
communicate to his wife: by skilful handling, and by taking
advantage of the young man's romantic ideas, he hoped to bind him,
for a smaller sum, to refuse M. Valenod's offers.</p>

<p>Madame de Rênal found it far harder to prove to Julien that, if
he sacrificed to her husband's convenience a post worth eight
hundred francs, publicly offered him by the Governor of the
Poorhouse, he might without blushing accept some compensation.</p>

<p>'But,' Julien continued to object, 'I have never had, even for a
moment, the slightest thought of accepting that offer. You have
made me too familiar with a life of refinement, the vulgarity of
those people would kill me.'</p>

<p>Cruel necessity, with its hand of iron, bent Julien's will. His
pride offered him the self-deception of accepting only as a loan
the sum offered by the Mayor of Verrières, and giving him a note of
hand promising repayment with interest after five years.</p>

<p>Madame de Rênal had still some thousands of francs hidden in the
little cave in the mountains.</p>

<p>She offered him these, trembling, and feeling only too sure that
they would be rejected with fury.</p>

<p>'Do you wish,' Julien asked her, 'to make the memory of our love
abominable?'</p>

<p>At length Julien left Verrières. M. de Rênal was overjoyed; at
the decisive moment of accepting money from him, this sacrifice
proved to be too great for Julien. He refused point-blank. M. de
Rênal fell upon his neck, with tears in his eyes. Julien having
asked him for a testimonial to his character, he could not in his
enthusiasm find terms laudatory enough to extol the young man's
conduct. Our hero had saved up five louis and intended to ask
Fouque for a similar amount.</p>

<p>He was greatly moved. But when he had gone a league from
Verrières, where he was leaving such a treasure of love behind him,
he thought only of the pleasure of seeing a capital, a great
military centre like Besançon.</p>

<p>During this short parting of three days, Madame de Rênal was
duped by one of love's most cruel illusions. Her life was tolerable
enough, there was between her and the last extremes of misery this
final meeting that she was still to have with Julien.</p>

<p>She counted the hours, the minutes that divided her from it.
Finally, during the night that followed the third day, she heard in
the distance the signal arranged between them. Having surmounted a
thousand perils, Julien appeared before her.</p>

<p>&gt;From that moment, she had but a single thought: 'I am
looking at you now for the last time.' Far from responding to her
lover's eagerness, she was like a barely animated corpse. If she
forced herself to tell him that she loved him, it was with an
awkward air that was almost a proof to the contrary. Nothing could
take her mind from the cruel thought of eternal separation. The
suspicious Julien fancied for a moment that she had already
forgotten him. His hints at such a possibility were received only
with huge tears that flowed in silence, and with a convulsive
pressure of his hand.</p>

<p>'But, Great God! How do you expect me to believe you?' was
Julien's reply to his mistress's chill protestations. 'You would
show a hundred times more of sincere affection to Madame Derville,
to a mere acquaintance.'</p>

<p>Madame de Rênal, petrified, did not know how to answer.</p>

<p>'It would be impossible for a woman to be more wretched...I hope
I am going to die...I feel my heart freezing...'</p>

<p>Such were the longest answers he was able to extract from
her.</p>

<p>When the approach of day made his departure necessary, Madame de
Rênal's tears ceased all at once. She saw him fasten a knotted cord
to the window without saying a word, without returning his kisses.
In vain might Julien say to her:</p>

<p>'At last we have reached the state for which you so longed.
Henceforward you will live without remorse. At the slightest
indisposition of one of your children, you will no longer see them
already in the grave.'</p>

<p>'I am sorry you could not say good-bye to Stanislas,' she said
to him coldly.</p>

<p>In the end, Julien was deeply impressed by the embraces, in
which there was no warmth, of this living corpse; he could think of
nothing else for some leagues. His spirit was crushed, and before
crossing the pass, so long as he was able to see the steeple of
Verrières church, he turned round often.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch24" id="ch24"></a>Chapter 24. A Capital</h2>

<p style="margin-left:10%">So much noise, so many busy people!<br>
So many ideas in the head of a man of twenty!<br>
So many distractions for love!<br>
&mdash;BARNAVE</p>

<p>At length he made out, on a distant mountain, a line of dark
walls; it was the citadel of Besançon. 'How different for me,' he
said with a sigh, 'if I were arriving in this noble fortress to be
a sublieutenant in one of the regiments entrusted with its
defence!'</p>

<p>Besançon is not merely one of the most charming towns in France,
it abounds in men and women of feeling and spirit. But Julien was
only a young peasant and had no way of approaching the
distinguished people.</p>

<p>He had borrowed from Fouque a layman's coat, and it was in this
attire that he crossed the drawbridges. His mind full of the
history of the siege of 1674, he was determined to visit, before
shutting himself up in the Seminary, the ramparts and the citadel.
More than once, he was on the point of being arrested by the
sentries for making his way into places from which the engineers of
the garrison excluded the public, in order to make a profit of
twelve or fifteen francs every year by the sale of the hay grown
there.</p>

<p>The height of the walls, the depth of the moats, the
awe-inspiring appearance of the guns had occupied him for some
hours, when he happened to pass by the principal café, on the
boulevard. He stood speechless with admiration; albeit he could
read the word Café inscribed in huge letters over the two vast
doors, he could not believe his eyes. He made an effort to master
his timidity; he ventured to enter, and found himself in a hall
thirty or forty feet long, the ceiling of which rose to a height of
at least twenty feet. On this day of days everything wore an air of
enchantment for him.</p>

<p>Two games of billiards were in progress. The waiters were
calling out the scores; the players hurried round the tables
through a crowd of onlookers. Streams of tobacco smoke, pouring
from every mouth, enveloped them in a blue haze. The tall stature
of these men, their rounded shoulders, their heavy gait, their
bushy whiskers, the long frock coats that coveted their bodies, all
attracted Julien's attention. These noble sons of ancient Bisontium
conversed only in shouts; they gave themselves the air of
tremendous warriors. Julien stood spellbound in admiration; he was
thinking of the vastness and splendour of a great capital like
Besançon. He felt that he could not possibly summon up courage to
ask for a cup of coffee from one of those gentlemen with the proud
gaze who were marking the score at billiards.</p>

<p>But the young lady behind the counter had remarked the charming
appearance of this young country cousin, who, brought to a
standstill three paces from the stove, hugging his little bundle
under his arm, was studying the bust of the King, in gleaming white
plaster. This young lady, a strapping Franc-Comtoise, extremely
well made, and dressed in the style calculated to give tone to a
café, had already said twice, in a low voice so modulated that only
Julien should hear her: 'Sir! Sir!' Julien's gaze met that of a
pair of the most tender blue eyes, and saw that it was himself who
was being addressed.</p>

<p>He stepped briskly up to the counter and the pretty girl, as he
might have advanced in the face of the enemy. As he executed this
great movement, his bundle fell to the ground.</p>

<p>What pity will not our provincial inspire in the young scholars
of Paris, who at fifteen, have already learned how to enter a café
with so distinguished an air! But these children, so stylish at
fifteen, at eighteen begin to turn common. The passionate shyness
which one meets in the provinces now and then overcomes itself, and
then teaches its victim to desire. As he approached this beautiful
girl who had deigned to speak to him, 'I must tell her the truth,'
thought Julien, who was growing courageous by dint of his conquered
shyness.</p>

<p>'Madame, I have come for the first time in my life to Besançon;
I should like to have, and to pay for, a roll of bread and a cup of
coffee.'</p>

<p>The girl smiled a little and then blushed; she feared, for this
good-looking young man, the satirical attention and witticisms of
the billiard players. He would be frightened and would never show
his face there again.</p>

<p>'Sit down here, near me,' she said, and pointed to a marble
table, almost entirely hidden by the enormous mahogany counter
which protruded into the room.</p>

<p>The young woman leaned over this counter, which gave her an
opportunity to display a superb figure. Julien observed this; all
his ideas altered. The pretty girl had just set before him a cup,
some sugar and a roll of bread. She hesitated before calling to a
waiter for coffee, realising that on the arrival of the said waiter
her private conversation with Julien would be at an end.</p>

<p>Julien, lost in thought, was comparing this fair and sprightly
beauty with certain memories which often stirred him. The thought
of the passion of which he had been the object took from him almost
all his timidity. The pretty girl had only a moment; she read the
expression in Julien's eyes.</p>

<p>'This pipe smoke makes you cough, come to breakfast tomorrow
before eight o'clock; at that time, I am almost alone.'</p>

<p>'What is your name?' said Julien, with the caressing smile of
happy timidity.</p>

<p>'Amanda Binet.'</p>

<p>'Will you permit me to send you, in an hour's time, a little
parcel no bigger than this?'</p>

<p>The fair Amanda reflected for a while.</p>

<p>'I am watched: what you ask may compromise me; however, I am now
going to write down my address upon a card, which you can attach to
your parcel. Send it to me without fear.'</p>

<p>'My name is Julien Sorel,' said the young man. 'I have neither
family nor friends in Besançon.'</p>

<p>'Ah! Now I understand,' she exclaimed joyfully, 'you have come
for the law school?'</p>

<p>'Alas, no!' replied Julien; 'they are sending me to the
Seminary.'</p>

<p>The most complete discouragement extinguished the light in
Amanda's features; she called a waiter: she had the necessary
courage now. The waiter poured out Julien's coffee, without looking
at him.</p>

<p>Amanda was taking money at the counter; Julien prided himself on
having ventured to speak to her: there was a dispute in progress at
one of the billiard tables. The shouts and contradictions of the
players, echoing through that vast hall, made a din which
astonished Julien. Amanda was pensive and did not raise her
eyes.</p>

<p>'If you like, Mademoiselle,' he said to her suddenly with
assurance, 'I can say that I am your cousin.'</p>

<p>This little air of authority delighted Amanda. This is no
good-for-nothing young fellow,' she thought. She said to him very
quickly, without looking at him, for her eye was occupied in
watching whether anyone were approaching the counter:</p>

<p>'I come from Genlis, near Dijon; say that you are from Genlis
too, and my mother's cousin.'</p>

<p>'I shall not forget.'</p>

<p>'On Thursdays, at five o'clock, in summer, the young gentlemen
from the Seminary come past the café here.'</p>

<p>'If you are thinking of me, when I pass, have a bunch of violets
in your hand.'</p>

<p>Amanda gazed at him with an air of astonishment; this gaze
changed Julien's courage into temerity; he blushed deeply, however,
as he said to her:</p>

<p>'I feel that I love you with the most violent love.'</p>

<p>'Don't speak so loud, then,' she warned him with an air of
alarm.</p>

<p>Julien thought of trying to recollect the language of an odd
volume of the <i>Nouvelle Heloise</i>, which he had found at Vergy.
His memory served him well; he had been for ten minutes reciting
the <i>Nouvelle Heloise</i> to Miss Amanda, who was in ecstasies;
he was delighted with his own courage, when suddenly the fair
Franc-Comtoise assumed a glacial air. One of her admirers stood in
the doorway of the café.</p>

<p>He came up to the counter, whistling and swaying his shoulders;
he stared at Julien. For the moment, the latter's imagination,
always flying to extremes, was filled entirely with thoughts of a
duel. He turned deadly pale, thrust away his cup, assumed an air of
assurance and studied his rival most attentively. While this
rival's head was lowered as he familiarly poured himself out a
glass of brandy upon the counter, with a glance Amanda ordered
Julien to lower his gaze. He obeyed, and for a minute or two sat
motionless in his place, pale, determined, and thinking only of
what was going to happen; he was really fine at that moment. The
rival had been astonished by Julien's eyes; his glass of brandy
drained at a gulp, he said a few words to Amanda, thrust his hands
into the side pockets of his ample coat, and made his way to one of
the billiard tables, breathing loudly and staring at Julien. The
latter sprang to his feet in a transport of rage; but did not know
what action to take to be insulting. He laid down his little bundle
and, with the most swaggering gait that he could assume, strode
towards the billiard table.</p>

<p>In vain did prudence warn him: 'With a duel on the day of your
arrival at Besançon, your career in the church is gone for
ever.'</p>

<p>'What does that matter, it shall never be said that I quailed
before an insult.'</p>

<p>Amanda observed his courage; it formed a charming contrast with
the simplicity of his manners; in an instant, she preferred him to
the big young man in the long coat. She rose, and, while appearing
to be following with her eyes the movements of someone going by in
the street, took her place swiftly between him and the billiard
table.</p>

<p>'You are not to look askance at that gentleman; he is my
brother-in-law.'</p>

<p>'What do I care? He looked at me.'</p>

<p>'Do you wish to get me into trouble? No doubt, he looked at you,
perhaps he will even come up and speak to you. I have told him that
you are one of my mother's family and that you have just come from
Genlis. He is a Franc-Comtois and has never been farther than Dole,
on the road into Burgundy; so tell him whatever you like, don't be
afraid.'</p>

<p>Julien continued to hesitate; she added rapidly, her barmaid's
imagination supplying her with falsehoods in abundance:</p>

<p>'I dare say he did look at you, but it was when he was asking me
who you were; he is a man who is rude with everyone, he didn't mean
to insult you.'</p>

<p>Julien's eye followed the alleged brother-in-law; he saw him buy
a number for the game of pool which was beginning at the farther of
the two billiard tables. Julien heard his loud voice exclaim: 'I
volunteer!' He passed nimbly behind Miss Amanda's back and took a
step towards the billiard table. Amanda seized him by the arm.</p>

<p>'Come and pay me first,' she said to him.</p>

<p>'Quite right,' thought Julien; 'she is afraid I may leave
without paying.' Amanda was as greatly agitated as himself, and had
turned very red; she counted out his change as slowly as she could,
repeating to him in a whisper as she did so:</p>

<p>'Leave the café this instant, or I shan't like you any more; I
do like you, though, very much.'</p>

<p>Julien did indeed leave, but slowly. 'Is it not incumbent upon
me,' he repeated to himself, 'to go and stare at that rude person
in my turn, and breathe in his face?' This uncertainty detained him
for an hour on the boulevard, outside the café; he watched to see
if his man came out. He did not however appear, and Julien
withdrew.</p>

<p>He had been but a few hours in Besançon, and already he had
something to regret. The old Surgeon-Major had long ago,
notwithstanding his gout, taught him a few lessons in fencing; this
was all the science that Julien could place at the service of his
anger. But this embarrassment would have been nothing if he had
known how to pick a quarrel otherwise than by striking a blow; and,
if they had come to fisticuffs, his rival, a giant of a man, would
have beaten him and left him discomfited.</p>

<p>'For a poor devil like me,' thought Julien, 'without protectors
and without money, there will be no great difference between a
Seminary and a prison; I must leave my lay clothes in some inn,
where I can put on my black coat. If I ever succeed in escaping
from the Seminary for an hour or two, I can easily, in my lay
clothes, see Miss Amanda again.' This was sound reasoning; but
Julien, as he passed by all the inns in turn, had not the courage
to enter any of them.</p>

<p>Finally, as he came again to the Hotel des Ambassadeurs, his
roving gaze met that of a stout woman, still reasonably young, with
a high complexion, a happy and gay expression. He went up to her
and told her his story.</p>

<p>'Certainly, my fine young priest,' the landlady of the
Ambassadeurs said to him, 'I shall keep your lay clothes for you,
indeed I will have them brushed regularly. In this weather, it is a
mistake to leave a broadcloth coat lying.' She took a key and led
him herself to a bedroom, advising him to write down a list of what
he was leaving behind.</p>

<p>'Lord, how nice you look like that, M. l'abbe Sorel,' said the
stout woman, when he came down to the kitchen. 'I am going to order
you a good dinner; and,' she added in an undertone, 'it will only
cost you twenty sous, instead of the fifty people generally pay;
for you must be careful with your little purse.'</p>

<p>'I have ten louis,' retorted Julien with a certain note of
pride.</p>

<p>'Oh, good Lord!' replied the good landlady in alarm, 'do not
speak so loud; there are plenty of bad folk in Besançon. They will
have that out of you in less than no time. Whatever you do, never
go into the cafes, they are full of rogues.'</p>

<p>'Indeed!' said Julien, to whom this last statement gave food for
thought.</p>

<p>'Never go anywhere except to me, I will give you your coffee.
Bear in mind that you will always find a friend here and a good
dinner for twenty sous; that's good enough for you, I hope. Go and
sit down at the table, I am going to serve you myself.'</p>

<p>'I should not be able to eat,' Julien told her. 'I am too much
excited, I am going to enter the Seminary as soon as I leave
here.'</p>

<p>The good woman would not allow him to leave until she had
stuffed his pockets with provisions. Finally Julien set out for the
dread spot, the landlady from her doorstep pointing out the
way.</p>

<hr>

<p style="margin-left:10%">Three hundred and thirty-six dinners at

chocolate to such as are entitled to it;<br>
how much is there to be made on the contract?<br>
&mdash;THE VALENOD OF BESANCON</p>

<p>He saw from a distance the cross of gilded iron over the door;
he went towards it slowly; his legs seemed to be giving way under
him. 'So there is that hell upon earth, from which I can never
escape!' Finally he decided to ring. The sound of the bell echoed
as though in a deserted place. After ten minutes, a pale man
dressed in black came and opened the door to him. Julien looked at
him and at once lowered his gaze. This porter had a singular
physiognomy. The prominent green pupils of his eyes were convex as
those of a cat's; the unwinking contours of his eyelids proclaimed
the impossibility of any human feeling; his thin lips were
stretched and curved over his protruding teeth. And yet this
physiognomy did not suggest a criminal nature, so much as that
entire insensibility which inspires far greater terror in the
young. The sole feeling that Julien's rapid glance could discern in
that long, smug face was a profound contempt for every subject that
might be mentioned to him, which did not refer to another and a
better world.</p>

<p>Julien raised his eyes with an effort, and in a voice which the
palpitation of his heart made tremulous explained that he wished to
speak to M. Pirard, the Director of the Seminary. Without a word,
the man in black made a sign to him to follow. They climbed two
flights of a wide staircase with a wooden baluster, the warped
steps of which sloped at a downward angle from the wall, and seemed
on the point of collapse. A small door, surmounted by a large
graveyard cross of white wood painted black, yielded to pressure
and the porter showed him into a low and gloomy room, the
whitewashed walls of which were adorned with two large pictures
dark with age. There, Julien was left to himself; he was terrified,
his heart throbbed violently; he would have liked to find the
courage to weep. A deathly silence reigned throughout the
building.</p>

<p>After a quarter of an hour, which seemed to him a day, the
sinister porter reappeared on the threshold of a door at the other
end of the room, and, without condescending to utter a word,
beckoned to him to advance. He entered a room even larger than the
first and very badly lighted. The walls of this room were
whitewashed also; but they were bare of ornament. Only in a corner
by the door, Julien noticed in passing a bed of white wood, two
straw chairs and a little armchair made of planks of firwood
without a cushion. At the other end of the room, near a small
window with dingy panes, decked with neglected flowerpots, he saw a
man seated at a table and dressed in a shabby cassock; he appeared
to be in a rage, and was taking one after another from a pile of
little sheets of paper which he spread out on his table after
writing a few words on each. He did not observe Julien's presence.
The latter remained motionless, standing in the middle of the room,
where he had been left by the porter, who had gone out again
shutting the door behind him.</p>

<p>Ten minutes passed in this fashion; the shabbily dressed man
writing all the time. Julien's emotion and terror were such that he
felt himself to be on the point of collapsing. A philosopher would
have said, perhaps wrongly: 'It is the violent impression made by
ugliness on a soul created to love what is beautiful.'</p>

<p>The man who was writing raised his head; Julien did not observe
this for a moment, and indeed, after he had noticed it, still
remained motionless, as though turned to stone by the terrible gaze
that was fixed on him. Julien's swimming eyes could barely make out
a long face covered all over with red spots, except on the
forehead, which displayed a deathly pallor. Between the red cheeks
and white forehead shone a pair of little black eyes calculated to
inspire terror in the bravest heart. The vast expanse of his
forehead was outlined by a mass of straight hair, as black as
jet.</p>

<p>'Are you coming nearer, or not?' the man said at length
impatiently.</p>

<p>Julien advanced with an uncertain step, and at length, ready to
fall to the ground and paler than he had ever been in his life,
came to a halt a few feet away from the little table of white wood
covered with scraps of paper.</p>

<p>'Nearer,' said the man.</p>

<p>Julien advanced farther, stretching out his hand as though in
search of something to lean upon.</p>

<p>'Your name?'</p>

<p>'Julien Sorel.'</p>

<p>'You are very late,' said the other, once more fastening upon
him a terrible eye.</p>

<p>Julien could not endure this gaze; putting out his hand as
though to support himself, he fell full length upon the floor.</p>

<p>The man rang a bell. Julien had lost only his sense of vision
and the strength to move; he could hear footsteps approaching.</p>

<p>He was picked up and placed in the little armchair of white
wood. He heard the terrible man say to the porter:</p>

<p>'An epileptic, evidently; I might have known it.'</p>

<p>When Julien was able to open his eyes, the man with the red face
was again writing; the porter had vanished. 'I must have courage,'
our hero told himself, 'and above all hide my feelings.' He felt a
sharp pain at his heart. 'If I am taken ill, heaven knows what they
will think of me.' At length the man stopped writing, and with a
sidelong glance at Julien asked:</p>

<p>'Are you in a fit state to answer my questions?'</p>

<p>'Yes, Sir,' said Julien in a feeble voice.</p>

<p>'Ah! That is fortunate.'</p>

<p>The man in black had half risen and was impatiently seeking for
a letter in the drawer of his table of firwood which opened with a
creak. He found it, slowly resumed his seat, and once more gazing
at Julien, with an air which seemed to wrest from him the little
life that remained to him:</p>

<p>'You are recommended to me by M. Chélan, who was the best curé
in the diocese, a good man if ever there was one, and my friend for
the last thirty years.'</p>

<p>'Ah! It is M. Pirard that I have the honour to address,' said
Julien in a feeble voice.</p>

<p>'So it seems,' said the Director of the Seminary, looking sourly
at him.</p>

<p>The gleam in his little eyes brightened, followed by an
involuntary jerk of the muscles round his mouth. It was the
physiognomy of a tiger relishing in anticipation the pleasure of
devouring its prey.</p>

<p>'Chélan's letter is short,' he said, as though speaking to
himself. '<i>Intelligenti pauca</i>: in these days, one cannot
write too little.' He read aloud:</p>

<p>'"I send you Julien Sorel, of this parish, whom I baptised
nearly twenty years ago; his father is a wealthy carpenter but
allows him nothing. Julien will be a noteworthy labourer in the
Lord's vineyard. Memory, intelligence are not wanting, he has the
power of reflection. Will his vocation last? Is it sincere?"'</p>

<p>'Sincere!' repeated the abbe Pirard with an air of surprise,
gazing at Julien; but this time the abbe's gaze was less devoid of
all trace of humanity. 'Sincere!' he repeated, lowering his voice
and returning to the letter:</p>

<p>'"I ask you for a bursary for Julien; he will qualify for it by
undergoing the necessary examinations. I have taught him a little
divinity, that old and sound divinity of Bossuet, Arnault, Fleury.
If the young man is not to your liking, send him back to me; the
Governor of our Poorhouse, whom you know well, offers him eight
hundred francs to come as tutor to his children. Inwardly I am
calm, thank God. I am growing accustomed to the terrible blow.
<i>Vale et me ama</i>."'</p>

<p>The abbe Pirard, relaxing the speed of his utterance as he came
to the signature, breathed with a sigh the word 'Chélan.'</p>

<p>'He is calm,' he said; 'indeed, his virtue deserved that reward;
God grant it to me, when my time comes!'</p>

<p>He looked upwards and made the sign of the Cross. At the sight
of this holy symbol Julien felt a slackening of the profound horror
which, from his entering the building, had frozen him.</p>

<p>'I have here three hundred and twenty-one aspirants for the
holiest of callings,' the abbe Pirard said at length, in a severe
but not hostile tone; 'only seven or eight have been recommended to
me by men like the abbe Chélan; thus among the three hundred and
twenty-one you will be the ninth. But my protection is neither
favour nor weakness, it is an increase of precaution and severity
against vice. Go and lock that door.'</p>

<p>Julien made an effort to walk and managed not to fall. He
noticed that a little window, near the door by which he had
entered, commanded a view of the country. He looked at the trees;
the sight of them did him good, as though he had caught sight of
old friends.</p>

<p>'<i>Loquerisne linguam latinam</i>? (Do you speak Latin?)' the
abbe Pirard asked him as he returned.</p>

<p>'<i>Ita, pater optime</i> (Yes, excellent Father),' replied
Julien, who was beginning to come to himself. Certainly nobody in
the world had appeared to him less excellent than M. Pirard, during
the last half-hour.</p>

<p>The conversation continued in Latin. The expression in the
abbe's eyes grew gentler; Julien recovered a certain coolness. 'How
weak I am,' he thought, 'to let myself be imposed upon by this show
of virtue! This man will be simply a rascal like M. Maslon'; and
Julien congratulated himself on having hidden almost all his money
in his boots.</p>

<p>The abbe Pirard examined Julien in theology, and was surprised
by the extent of his knowledge. His astonishment increased when he
questioned him more particularly on the Holy Scriptures. But when
he came to questions touching the doctrine of the Fathers, he
discovered that Julien barely knew the names of Saint Jerome, Saint
Augustine, Saint Bonaventure, Saint Basil, etc., etc.</p>

<p>'In fact,' thought the abbe Pirard, 'here is another instance of
that fatal tendency towards Protestantism which I have always had
to rebuke in Chélan. A thorough, a too thorough acquaintance with
the Holy Scriptures.'</p>

<p>(Julien had just spoken to him, without having been questioned
on the subject, of the true date of authorship of Genesis, the
Pentateuch, etc.)</p>

<p>'To what does all this endless discussion of the Holy Scriptures
lead,' thought the abbe Pirard, 'if not to private judgment, that
is to say to the most fearful Protestantism? And, in conjunction
with this rash learning, nothing about the Fathers that can
compensate for this tendency.'</p>

<p>But the astonishment of the Director of the Seminary knew no
bounds when, questioning Julien as to the authority of the Pope,
and expecting the maxims of the ancient Gallican church, he heard
the young man repeat the whole of M. de Maistre's book.</p>

<p>'A strange man, Chélan,' thought the abbe Pirard; 'has he given
him this book to teach him to laugh at it?'</p>

<p>In vain did he question Julien, trying to discover whether he
seriously believed the doctrine of M. de Maistre. The young man
could answer him only by rote. From this moment, Julien was really
admirable, he felt that he was master of himself. After a prolonged
examination it seemed to him that M. Pirard's severity towards him
was no more than an affectation. Indeed, but for the rule of
austere gravity which, for the last fifteen years, he had imposed
on himself in dealing with his pupils in theology, the Director of
the Seminary would have embraced Julien in the name of logic, such
clarity, precision, and point did he find in the young man's
answers.</p>

<p>'This is a bold and healthy mind,' he said to himself, 'but
<i>corpus debile</i> (a frail body).</p>

<p>'Do you often fall like that?' he asked Julien in French,
pointing with his finger to the floor.</p>

<p>'It was the first time in my life; the sight of the porter's
face paralysed me,' Julien explained, colouring like a child.</p>

<p>The abbe Pirard almost smiled.</p>

<p>'Such is the effect of the vain pomps of this world; you are
evidently accustomed to smiling faces, positive theatres of
falsehood. The truth is austere, Sir. But is not our task here
below austere also? You will have to see that your conscience is on
its guard against this weakness: <i>Undue sensibility to vain
outward charms</i>.</p>

<p>'Had you not been recommended to me,' said the abbe Pirard,
returning with marked pleasure to the Latin tongue, 'had you not
been recommended to me by a man such as the abbe Chélan, I should
address you in the vain language of this world to which it appears
that you are too well accustomed. The entire bursary for which you
apply is, I may tell you, the hardest thing in the world to obtain.
But the abbe Chélan has earned little, by fifty-six years of
apostolic labours, if he cannot dispose of a bursary at the
Seminary.'</p>

<p>After saying these words, the abbe Pirard advised Julien not to
join any secret society or congregation without his consent.</p>

<p>'I give you my word of honour,' said Julien with the heartfelt
warmth of an honest man.</p>

<p>The Director of the Seminary smiled for the first time.</p>

<p>'That expression is not in keeping here,' he told him; 'it is
too suggestive of the vain honour of men of the world, which leads
them into so many errors and often into crime. You owe me obedience
in virtue of the seventeenth paragraph of the Bull <i>Unam
Ecclesiam</i> of Saint Pius V. I am your ecclesiastical superior.
In this house to hear, my dearly beloved son, is to obey. How much
money have you?'</p>

<p>('Now we come to the point,' thought Julien, 'this is the reason
of the "dearly beloved son".')</p>

<p>'Thirty-five francs, Father.'</p>

<p>'Keep a careful note of how you spend your money; you will have
to account for it to me.'</p>

<p>This exhausting interview had lasted three hours. Julien was
told to summon the porter.</p>

<p>'Put Julien Sorel in cell number 103,' the abbe Pirard told the
man.</p>

<p>As a special favour, he was giving Julien a room to himself.</p>

<p>'Take up his trunk,' he added.</p>

<p>Julien lowered his eyes and saw his trunk staring him in the
face; he had been looking at it for three hours and had never seen
it.</p>

<p>On arriving at No. 103, which was a tiny room eight feet square
on the highest floor of the building, Julien observed that it
looked out towards the ramparts, beyond which one saw the smiling
plain which the Doubs divides from the city.</p>

<p>'What a charming view!' exclaimed Julien; in speaking thus to
himself he was not conscious of the feeling implied by his words.
The violent sensations he had experienced in the short time that he
had spent in Besançon had completely drained his strength. He sat
down by the window on the solitary wooden chair that was in his
cell, and at once fell into a profound slumber. He did not hear the
supper bell, nor that for Benediction; he had been forgotten.</p>

<p>When the first rays of the sun awakened him next morning, he
found himself lying upon the floor.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch26" id="ch26"></a>Chapter 26. The World, or What the
Rich Lack</h2>

<p style="margin-left:10%">I am alone on earth, no one deigns to
think of me. All the<br>
people I see making their fortunes have a brazenness and a<br>
hard-heartedness which I do not sense in myself. Ah! I shall<br>
soon be dead, either of hunger, or from the sorrow of finding<br>
men so hard.<br>
&mdash;YOUNG</p>

<p>He made haste to brush his coat and to go downstairs; he was
late. An under-master rebuked him severely; instead of seeking to
excuse himself, Julien crossed his arms on his breast:</p>

<p>'<i>Peccavi, pater optime</i> (I have sinned, I confess my
fault, O Father),' he said with a contrite air.</p>

<p>This was a most successful beginning. The sharp wits among the
seminarists saw that they had to deal with a man who was not new to
the game. The recreation hour came, Julien saw himself the object
of general curiosity. But they found in him merely reserve and
silence. Following the maxims that he had laid down for himself, he
regarded his three hundred and twenty-one comrades as so many
enemies; the most dangerous of all in his eyes was the abbe
Pirard.</p>

<p>A few days later, Julien had to choose a confessor, he was
furnished with a list.</p>

<p>'Eh; Great God, for what do they take me?' he said to himself.
'Do they suppose I can't take a hint?' And he chose the abbe
Pirard.</p>

<p>Though he did not suspect it, this step was decisive. A little
seminarist, still quite a boy, and a native of Verrières, who, from
the first day, had declared himself his friend, informed him that
if he had chosen M. Castanede, the vice-principal of the Seminary,
he would perhaps have shown greater prudence.</p>

<p>'The abbe Castanede is the enemy of M. Pirard, who is suspected
of Jansenism'; the little seminarist added, whispering this
information in his ear.</p>

<p>All the first steps taken by our hero who fancied himself so
prudent were, like his choice of a confessor, foolish in the
extreme. Led astray by all the presumption of an imaginative man,
he mistook his intentions for facts, and thought himself a
consummate hypocrite. His folly went the length of his reproaching
himself for his successes in this art of the weak.</p>

<p>'Alas! It is my sole weapon! In another epoch, it would have
been by speaking actions in the face of the enemy that I should
have <i>earned my bread</i>.'</p>

<p>Julien, satisfied with his own conduct, looked around him; he
found everywhere an appearance of the purest virtue.</p>

<p>Nine or ten of the seminarists lived in the odour of sanctity,
and had visions like Saint Teresa and Saint Francis, when he
received the Stigmata upon Monte Verna, in the Apennines. But this
was a great secret which their friends kept to themselves. These
poor young visionaries were almost always in the infirmary. Some
hundred others combined with a robust faith an unwearying
application. They worked until they made themselves ill, but
without learning much. Two or three distinguished themselves by
real talent, and, among these, one named Chazel; but Julien felt
himself repelled by them, and they by him.</p>

<p>The rest of the three hundred and twenty-one seminarists were
composed entirely of coarse creatures who were by no means certain
that they understood the Latin words which they repeated all day
long. Almost all of them were the sons of peasants, and preferred
to earn their bread by reciting a few Latin words rather than by
tilling the soil. It was after making this discovery, in the first
few days, that Julien promised himself a rapid success. 'In every
service, there is need of intelligent people, for after all there
is work to be done,' he told himself. 'Under Napoleon, I should
have been a serjeant; among these future curés, I shall be a
Vicar-General.</p>

<p>'All these poor devils,' he added, 'labourers from the cradle,
have lived, until they came here, upon skim milk and black bread.
In their cottages, they tasted meat only five or six times in a
year. Like the Roman soldiers who found active service a holiday,
these boorish peasants are enchanted by the luxuries of the
Seminary.'</p>

<p>Julien never read anything in their lack-lustre eyes beyond the
satisfaction of a bodily need after dinner, and the expectation of
a bodily pleasure before the meal. Such were the people among whom
he must distinguish himself; but what Julien did not know, what
they refrained from telling him, was that to be at the top of the
various classes of dogma, church history, etc., etc., which were
studied in the Seminary, was nothing more in their eyes than a sin
of <i>vainglory</i>. Since Voltaire, since Two Chamber government,
which is at bottom only <i>distrust and private judgment</i>, and
instils in the hearts of the people that fatal habit of <i>want of
confidence</i>, the Church of France seems to have realised that
books are its true enemies. It is heartfelt submission that is
everything in its eyes. Success in studies, even in sacred studies,
is suspect, and with good reason. What is to prevent the superior
man from going over to the other side, like Sieyes or Gregoire? The
trembling Church clings to the Pope as to her sole chance of
salvation. The Pope alone can attempt to paralyse private judgment,
and, by the pious pomps of the ceremonies of his court, make an
impression upon the sick and listless minds of men and women of the
world.</p>

<p>Having half mastered these several truths, which however all the
words uttered in a Seminary tend to deny, Julien fell into a deep
melancholy. He worked hard, and rapidly succeeded in learning
things of great value to a priest, entirely false in his eyes, and
in which he took no interest. He imagined that there was nothing
else for him to do.</p>

<p>'Am I then forgotten by all the world?' he wondered. He little
knew that M. Pirard had received and had flung in the fire several
letters bearing the Dijon postmark, letters in which, despite the
most conventional style and language, the most intense passion was
apparent. Keen remorse seemed to be doing battle with this love.
'So much the better,' thought the abbe Pirard, 'at least it is not
an irreligious woman that this young man has loved.'</p>

<p>One day, the abbe Pirard opened a letter which seemed to be half
obliterated by tears, it was an eternal farewell. 'At last,' the
writer informed Julien, 'heaven has granted me the grace of hating
not the author of my fault, he will always be dearer to me than
anything in the world, but my fault itself. The sacrifice is made,
my friend. It is not without tears, as you see. The salvation of
the beings to whom I am bound, and whom you have loved so dearly,
has prevailed. A just but terrible God can no longer wreak
vengeance upon them for their mother's crimes. Farewell, Julien, be
just towards men.'</p>

<p>This ending to the letter was almost entirely illegible. The
writer gave an address at Dijon, and at the same time hoped that
Julien would never reply, or that at least he would confine himself
to language which a woman restored to the ways of virtue could read
without blushing.</p>

<p>Julien's melancholy, assisted by the indifferent food supplied
to the Seminary by the contractor for dinners at 83 centimes a
head, was beginning to have an effect on his health, when one
morning Fouque suddenly appeared in his room.</p>

<p>'At last I have found my way in. I have come five times to
Besançon, honour bound, to see you. Always a barred door. I posted
someone at the gate of the Seminary; why the devil do you never
come out?'</p>

<p>'It is a test which I have set myself.'</p>

<p>'I find you greatly altered. At last I see you again. Two good
five franc pieces have just taught me that I was no better than a
fool not to have offered them on my first visit.'</p>

<p>The conversation between the friends was endless. Julien changed
colour when Fouque said to him:</p>

<p>'Have you heard, by the way? The mother of your pupils has
become most devoutly religious.'</p>

<p>And he spoke with that detached air which makes so singular an
impression on the passionate soul whose dearest interests the
speaker unconsciously destroys.</p>

<p>'Yes, my friend, the most exalted strain of piety. They say that
she makes pilgrimages. But, to the eternal shame of the abbe
Maslon, who has been spying so long upon that poor M. Chélan,
Madame de Rênal will have nothing to do with him. She goes to
confession at Dijon or Besançon.'</p>

<p>'She comes to Besançon!' said Julien, his brow flushing.</p>

<p>'Quite often,' replied Fouque with a questioning air.</p>

<p>'Have you any <i>Constitutionnels</i> on you?'</p>

<p>'What's that you say?' replied Fouque.</p>

<p>'I ask you if you have any <i>Constitutionnels</i>?' Julien
repeated, in a calmer tone. 'They are sold here for thirty sous a
copy.'</p>

<p>'What! Liberals even in the Seminary!' cried Fouque. 'Unhappy
France!' he went on, copying the hypocritical tone and meek accents
of the abbe Maslon.</p>

<p>This visit would have made a profound impression upon our hero,
had not, the very next day, a remark addressed to him by that
little seminarist from Verrières who seemed such a boy, led him to
make an important discovery. Ever since he had been in the
Seminary, Julien's conduct had been nothing but a succession of
false steps. He laughed bitterly at himself.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact, the important actions of his life were
wisely ordered; but he paid no attention to details, and the clever
people in a Seminary look only at details. And so he passed already
among his fellow students as a free thinker. He had been betrayed
by any number of trifling actions.</p>

<p>In their eyes he was convicted of this appalling vice, <i>he
thought, he judged for himself</i>, instead of blindly following
<i>authority</i> and example. The abbe Pirard had been of no
assistance to him; he had not once uttered a word to him apart from
the tribunal of penitence, and even there he listened rather than
spoke. It would have been very different had Julien chosen the abbe
Castanede.</p>

<p>The moment that Julien became aware of his own folly, his
interest revived. He wished to know the whole extent of the harm,
and, with this object, emerged a little from that haughty and
obstinate silence with which he repulsed his fellows. It was then
that they took their revenge on him. His advances were received
with a contempt which went the length of derision. He realised that
since his entering the Seminary, not an hour had passed, especially
during recreation, that had not borne some consequence for or
against him, had not increased the number of his enemies, or won
him the good will of some seminarist who was genuinely virtuous or
a trifle less boorish than the rest. The damage to be repaired was
immense, the task one of great difficulty. Thenceforward Julien's
attention was constantly on the alert; it was a case of portraying
himself in an entirely new character.</p>

<p>The control of his eyes, for instance, gave him a great deal of
trouble. It is not without reason that in such places they are kept
lowered. 'What was not my presumption at Verrières!' Julien said to
himself, 'I imagined I was alive; I was only preparing myself for
life; here I am at last in the world, as I shall find it until I
have played out my part, surrounded by real enemies. What an
immense difficulty,' he went on, 'is this incessant hypocrisy! It
would put the labours of Hercules to shame. The Hercules of modern
times is Sixtus V, who for fifteen years on end, by his modesty,
deceived forty Cardinals, who had seen him proud and vigorous in
his youth.</p>

<p>'So learning is really nothing here!' he told himself with
scorn; 'progress in dogma, in sacred history, and the rest of it,
count only in appearance. All that is said on that topic is
intended to make fools like myself fall into the trap. Alas, my
sole merit consisted in my rapid progress, in my faculty for
grasping all that nonsense. Can it be that in their hearts they
esteem it at its true value; judge of it as I do? And I was fool
enough to be proud of myself! Those first places in class which I
always obtain have served only to give me bitter enemies. Chazel,
who knows far more than I, always puts into his compositions some
piece of stupidity which sends him down to the fiftieth place; if
he obtains the first, it is when he is not thinking. Ah! one word,
a single word from M. Pirard, how useful it would have been to
me!'</p>

<p>&gt;From the moment in which Julien's eyes were opened, the long
exercises of ascetic piety, such as the Rosary five times weekly,
the hymns to the Sacred Heart, etc., etc., which had seemed to him
of such deadly dullness, became the most interesting actions of his
life. Sternly criticising his own conduct, and seeking above all
not to exaggerate his methods, Julien did not aspire from the
first, like the seminarists who served as models to the rest, to
perform at every moment some <i>significant</i> action, that is to
say one which gave proof of some form of Christian perfection. In
Seminaries, there is a way of eating a boiled egg which reveals the
progress one has made in the godly life.</p>

<p>The reader, who is perhaps smiling, will please to remember all
the mistakes made, in eating an egg, by the abbe Delille when
invited to luncheon by a great lady of the Court of Louis XVI.</p>

<p>Julien sought at first to arrive at the <i>non culpa</i>, to
wit, the state of the young seminarist whose gait, his way of
moving his arms, eyes, etc., do not, it is true, indicate anything
worldly, but do not yet show the creature absorbed by the idea of
the next life and the <i>absolute nullity</i> of this.</p>

<p>Everywhere Julien found inscribed in charcoal, on the walls of
the passages, sentences like the following: 'What are sixty years
of trial, set in the balance with an eternity of bliss or an
eternity of boiling oil in hell!' He no longer despised them; he
realised that he must have them always before his eyes. 'What shall
I be doing all my life?' he said to himself; 'I shall be selling
the faithful a place in heaven. How is that place to be made
visible to them? By the difference between my exterior and that of
a layman.'</p>

<p>After several months of application kept up at every moment,
Julien still had the air of a <i>thinker</i>. His way of moving his
eyes and opening his lips did not reveal an implicit faith ready to
believe everything and to uphold everything, even by martyrdom. It
was with anger that Julien saw himself surpassed in this respect by
the most boorish peasants. They had good reasons for not having the
air of thinkers.</p>

<p>What pains did he not take to arrive at that expression of blind
and fervent faith, which is so frequently to be found in the
convents of Italy, and such perfect examples of which Guercino has
bequeathed to us laymen in his paintings in churches. [Author's
footnote: For instance, in the Louvre, no. 1130: 'Francis Duke of
Aquitaine laying aside the crown and putting on a monastic
habit.']</p>

<p>On the greatest festivals the seminarists were given sausages
with pickled cabbage. Julien's neighbours at table observed that he
remained unmoved by this good fortune; it was one of his first
crimes. His comrades saw in it an odious mark of the most stupid
hypocrisy; nothing made him so many enemies. 'Look at that
gentleman, look at that proud fellow,' they would say, 'pretending
to despise our best ration, sausages with cabbage! The wretched
conceit of the damned fellow!' He should have refrained as an act
of penance from eating the whole of his portion, and should have
made the sacrifice of saying to some friend, with reference to the
pickled cabbage: 'What is there that man can offer to an All
Powerful Being, if it be not <i>voluntary suffering</i>?'</p>

<p>Julien lacked the experience which makes it so easy for us to
see things of this sort.</p>

<p>'Alas! The ignorance of these young peasants, my comrades, is a
great advantage to them,' Julien would exclaim in moments of
discouragement. 'When they arrive in the Seminary, the teacher has
not to rid them of the appalling number of worldly thoughts which I
brought with me, and which they read on my face, do what I
will.'</p>

<p>Julien studied with an attention that bordered upon envy the
more boorish of the young peasants who arrived at the Seminary. At
the moment when they were stripped of their ratteen jackets to be
garbed in the black cassock, their education was limited to an
immense and unbounded respect for dry and liquid money, as the
saying goes in the Franche-Comté.</p>

<p>It is the sacramental and heroic fashion of expressing the
sublime idea of ready cash.</p>

<p>Happiness, for these seminarists, as for the heroes of
Voltaire's tales, consists first and foremost in dining well.
Julien discovered in almost all of them an innate respect for the
man who wears a coat of <i>fine cloth</i>. This sentiment estimates
<i>distributive justice</i>, as it is dealt out to us by our
courts, at its true worth, indeed below its true worth. 'What is to
be gained,' they would often say among themselves, 'by going to law
with the big?'</p>

<p>'Big' is the word used in the valleys of the Jura to denote a
rich man. One may imagine their respect for the richest party of
all: the Government!</p>

<p>Not to smile respectfully at the mere name of the Prefect is
reckoned, among the peasants of the Franche-Comté, an imprudence;
and imprudence, among the poor, is promptly punished with want of
bread.</p>

<p>After having been almost suffocated at first by his sense of
scorn, Julien ended by feeling pity: it had often been the lot of
the fathers of the majority of his comrades to come home on a
winter evening to their cottages, and to find there no bread, no
chestnuts, and no potatoes. 'Is it surprising then,' Julien asked
himself, 'if the happy man, in their eyes, is first of all the man
who has just eaten a good dinner, and after that he who possesses a
good coat! My comrades have a definite vocation; that is to say,
they see in the ecclesiastical calling a long continuation of this
happiness: dining well and having a warm coat in winter.'</p>

<p>Julien happened to hear a young seminarist, endowed with
imagination, say to his companion:</p>

<p>'Why should not I become Pope like Sixtus V, who was a
swineherd?'</p>

<p>'They make none but Italians Popes,' replied the friend; 'but
they'll draw lots among us, for sure, to fill places as
Vicars-General and Canons, and perhaps Bishops. M. P&mdash;&mdash;
the Bishop of Chalons, is the son of a cooper; that is my father's
trade.'</p>

<p>One day, in the middle of a lesson in dogma, the abbe Pirard
sent for Julien. The poor young fellow was delighted to escape from
the physical and moral atmosphere in which he was plunged.</p>

<p>Julien found himself greeted by the Director in the manner which
had so frightened him on the day of his joining the Seminary.</p>

<p>'Explain to me what I see written upon this playing card,' he
said to him, looking at him in such a way as to make him wish that
the earth would open and swallow him.</p>

<p>Julien read:</p>

<p>'Amanda Binet, at the Giraffe café, before eight o'clock. Say
you are from Genlis, and a cousin of my mother.'</p>

<p>Julien perceived the immensity of the danger; the abbe
Castanede's police had stolen the address from him.</p>

<p>'The day on which I came here,' he replied, gazing at the abbe
Pirard's forehead, for he could not face his terrible eye, 'I was
trembling with fear: M. Chélan had told me that this was a place
full of tale-bearing and spite of all sorts; spying and the
accusation of one's comrades are encouraged here. Such is the will
of heaven, to show life as it is to young priests, and to inspire
in them a disgust with the world and its pomps.'</p>

<p>'And it is to me that you make these fine speeches'&mdash;the abbe
Pirard was furious. 'You young rascal!'</p>

<p>'At Verrières,' Julien went on calmly, 'my brothers used to beat
me when they had any reason to be jealous of me...'</p>

<p>'To the point! Get to the point!' cried M. Pirard, almost beside
himself.</p>

<p>Without being the least bit in the world intimidated, Julien
resumed his narrative.</p>

<p>'On the day of my coming to Besançon, about noon, I felt hungry,
I went into a café. My heart was filled with repugnance for so
profane a spot; but I thought that my luncheon would cost me less
there than at an inn. A lady, who seemed to be the mistress of the
place, took pity on my raw looks. "Besançon is full of wicked
people," she told me, "I am afraid for you, Sir. If you find
yourself in any trouble, come to me, send a message to me before
eight o'clock. If the porters at the Seminary refuse to take your
message, say that you are my cousin, and come from Genlis..."'</p>

<p>'All this farrago will have to be investigated,' exclaimed the
abbe Pirard who, unable to remain in one place, was striding up and
down the room.</p>

<p>'You will go back to your cell!'</p>

<p>The abbe accompanied Julien and locked him in. He himself at
once proceeded to examine his trunk, in the bottom of which the
fatal card had been carefully concealed. Nothing was missing from
the trunk, but several things had been disarranged; and yet the key
never left his possession. 'How fortunate,' Julien said to himself,
'that during the time of my blindness I never made use of the
permission to leave the building, which M. Castanede so frequently
offered me with a generosity which I now understand. Perhaps I
might have been so foolish as to change my clothes and pay the fair
Amanda a visit, I should have been ruined. When they despaired of
making any use of their information in that way, so as not to waste
it they have used it to denounce me.</p>

<p>A couple of hours later, the Director sent for him.</p>

<p>'You have not lied,' he said to him, looking at him less
severely; 'but to keep such an address is an imprudence the serious
nature of which you cannot conceive. Unhappy boy! In ten years,
perhaps, it will redound to your hurt.'</p>

<h2><a name="ch27" id="ch27"></a>Chapter 27. First Experience of
Life</h2>

<p style="margin-left:10%">The present moment, by God! is the ark
of the Lord.<br>
Woe betide the man who lays his hand upon it.<br>
&mdash;DIDEROT</p>

<p>The reader will kindly excuse our giving but few clear and
precise details of this epoch in Julien's life. Not that we lack
them, far from it; but perhaps the life he led in the Seminary is
too black for the modest colouring which we have sought to preserve
in these pages. People who have been made to suffer by certain
things cannot be reminded of them without a horror which paralyses
every other pleasure, even that to be found in reading a story.</p>

<p>Julien met with little success in his attempts at hypocrisy in
action; he passed through moments of disgust and even of complete
discouragement. He was utterly unsuccessful, and that moreover in a
vile career. The slightest help from without would have sufficed to
restore his morale, the difficulty to be overcome was not great;
but he was alone, as lonely as a vessel abandoned in mid-ocean.
'And if I should succeed,' he said to himself; 'to have to spend my
whole life in such evil company! Gluttons who think of nothing but
the ham omelette they are going to devour at dinner, or men like
the abbe Castanede, to whom no crime is too black! They will rise
to power; but at what a price, great God!</p>

<p>'Man's will is powerful, I see it written everywhere; but is it
sufficiently so to overcome such repulsion? The task of great men
has always been easy; however terrible was their danger, it was
beautiful in their eyes; and who but myself can realise the
ugliness of all that surrounds me?'</p>

<p>This was the most trying moment in his life. It was so easy for
him to enlist in one of the fine regiments that were stationed at
Besançon! He might become a teacher of Latin; he wanted so little
to keep himself alive! But then, no career, no future for his
imagination: it was a living death. Here is a detailed account of
one of his wretched days.</p>

<p>'My presumption has so often flattered itself upon my being
different from the other young peasants! Well, I have lived long
enough to see that difference breeds hatred,' he said to himself
one morning. This great truth had just been revealed to him by one
of his most annoying failures. He had laboured for a week to make
himself agreeable to a student who lived in the odour of sanctity.
He was walking with him in the courtyard, listening submissively to
idiocies that sent him to sleep as he walked. Suddenly a storm
broke, the thunder growled, and the saintly student exclaimed,
thrusting him rudely away:</p>

<p>'Listen, each for himself in this world, I have no wish to be
struck by lightning: God may blast you as an infidel, another
Voltaire.'</p>

<p>His teeth clenched with rage and his eyes opened towards the sky
furrowed by streaks of lightning: 'I should deserve to be
submerged, were I to let myself sleep during the storm!' cried
Julien. 'Let us attempt the conquest of some other drudge.'</p>

<p>The bell rang for the abbe Castanede's class of sacred
history.</p>

<p>These young peasants who lived in such fear of the hard toil and
poverty of their fathers, were taught that day by the abbe
Castanede that that being so terrible in their eyes, the
Government, had no real or legitimate power save what was delegated
to it by God's Vicar on Earth.</p>

<p>'Render yourselves worthy of the Pope's bounties by the sanctity
of your lives, by your obedience, be like a rod in his hands,' he
went on, 'and you will attain to a superb position where you will
be in supreme command, under no man's control; a permanent
position, of which the Government pays one third of the emoluments,
and the faithful, roused by your preaching, the other two
thirds.'</p>

<p>On leaving his classroom, M. Castanede stopped in the
courtyard.</p>

<p>'You may well say of a curé, each man gets what he deserves,' he
said to the students who gathered round him. 'I myself have known
mountain parishes where the fees came to more than those of many
town curés. There was as much in money, not to speak of the fat
capons, eggs, fresh butter, and endless little delicacies; and
there the curé takes the first place without challenge: no good
meal to which he is not invited, made much of,' etc.</p>

<p>No sooner had M. Castanede gone up to his own room, than the
students divided into groups. Julien belonged to none of these;
they drew away from him as from a tainted wether. In each of the
groups, he saw a student toss a copper in the air, and if he
guessed head or tail aright, his companions concluded that he would
soon have one of these livings with fat fees.</p>

<p>Stories followed. One young priest, barely a year in orders,
having presented a domestic rabbit to an old curé's servant, had
got the curé to ask for him as his assistant, and a few months
afterwards, for the curé had died almost immediately, had succeeded
him in a good living. Another had managed to have his name put
forward for the eventual succession to the curacy of a prosperous
country town, by attending all the meals of the paralytic old curé
and carving his chickens for him gracefully.</p>

<p>The seminarists, like young men in every profession, exaggerated
the effect of these little stratagems when they were out of the
ordinary and struck the imagination.</p>

<p>'I must,' thought Julien, 'take part in these conversations.'
When they were not discussing sausages and rich livings, their talk
ran on the worldly side of ecclesiastical teaching; the differences
between Bishops and Prefects, mayors and curés. Julien saw lurking
in their minds the idea of a second God, but of a God far more to
be feared and far more powerful than the first; this second God was
the Pope. It was said, but with lowered voice, and when the speaker
was quite certain of not being overheard by M. Pirard, that if the
Pope did not take the trouble to appoint all the Prefects and all
the mayors in France, it was because he had delegated the King of
France for that duty, by naming him the Eldest Son of the
Church.</p>

<p>It was about this time that Julien thought he might derive some
benefit from his admiration for M. de Maistre's book on the Pope.
He did, as a matter of fact, astonish his fellow-students; but this
was a fresh misfortune. He annoyed them by expressing their
opinions better than they could themselves. M. Chélan had been a
rash counsellor for Julien as he had been for himself. After
training him to the habit of reasoning accurately and not letting
himself be taken in by vain words, he had omitted to tell him that
in a person of little repute this habit is a crime; for sound
reasoning always gives offence.</p>

<p>Julien's fine speech was therefore only another crime against
him. His companions, being compelled to think about him, succeeded
in finding two words to express all the horror with which he filled
them: they nicknamed him Martin Luther; 'chiefly,' they said,
'because of that infernal logic of which he is so proud.'</p>

<p>Several young seminarists had fresher complexions and might be
reckoned better looking than Julien; but he had white hands, and
could not hide certain habits of personal cleanliness. This
distinction was none at all in the grim dwelling into which destiny
had cast him. The unclean peasants among whom he lived declared
that he had extremely lax morals. We are afraid to tire the reader
by an account of our hero's endless mishaps. To take one instance,
the more vigorous among his companions tried to make a practice of
thrashing him; he was obliged to arm himself with a metal compass
and to inform them, but only by signs, that he would use it. Signs
cannot be represented, in a spy's report, so damningly as
words.</p>

<h2><a name="ch28" id="ch28"></a>Chapter 28. A Procession</h2>

<p style="margin-left:10%">All hearts were moved. God's
presence<br>
seemed to have come down into these narrow, gothic streets,<br>
decked on every side, and strewn with sand through the good
offices<br>
of the faithful.<br>
&mdash;YOUNG</p>

<p>[Tr. footnote: As in Chapter 26 I have left this motto in
French. It seems, however, to be taken from Arthur Young rather and
Edward. C. K. S. M.]</p>

<p>In vain might Julien make himself small and foolish, he could
not give satisfaction, he was too different. 'And yet,' he said to
himself, 'all these Professors are men of great discernment, and
picked men, each of them one in a thousand; how is it they do not
like my humility?' One alone seemed to him to be taking advantage
of his readiness to believe anything and to appear taken in by
everything. This was the abbe Chas-Bernard, Master of Ceremonies at
the Cathedral, where, for the last fifteen years, he had been kept
in hopes of a Canonry; in the meantime, he taught sacred eloquence
at the Seminary. In the period of his blindness, this class was one
of those in which Julien most regularly came out at the top. The
abbe Chas had been led by this to show a partiality for him, and,
at the end of his class, would gladly take his arm for a turn in
the garden.</p>

<p>'What can his object be?' Julien asked himself. He found with
amazement that, for hours on end, the abbe talked to him of the
ornaments which the Cathedral possessed. It had seventeen
apparelled chasubles, apart from the vestments worn at requiems.
They had great hopes of President de Rubempre's widow; this lady,
who was ninety years old, had preserved for at least seventy of
those years her wedding garments of superb Lyons stuffs, figured in
gold. 'Just imagine, my friend,' said the abbe Chas coming to a
standstill and opening his eyes wide, 'these stuffs stand by
themselves, there is so much gold in them. It is common opinion in
Besançon that, under the Presidente's will, the treasury of the
Cathedral will be enriched with more than ten chasubles, not to
mention four or five copes for the greater feasts. I will go
farther,' the abbe Chas added, lowering his voice. 'I have good
reason to think that the Presidente will bequeath to us eight
magnificent silver-gilt candlesticks, which are supposed to have
been bought in Italy, by the Duke of Burgundy, Charles the Bold,
whose favourite minister was an ancestor of hers.'</p>

<p>'But what is this man really aiming at behind all this
frippery?' Julien wondered. 'This careful preparation has been
going on for an age, and nothing comes of it. He must have
singularly little faith in me! He is cleverer than any of the
others, whose secret purposes one can see so plainly after a
fortnight. I understand, this man's ambition has been in torment
for fifteen years.'</p>

<p>One evening, in the middle of the armed drill, Julien was sent
for by the abbe Pirard, who said to him:</p>

<p>'Tomorrow is the feast of Corpus Christi. M. l'abbe Chas-Bernard
requires you to help him to decorate the Cathedral; go and
obey.'</p>

<p>The abbe Pirard called him back, and added, in a tone of
compassion:</p>

<p>'It is for you to decide whether you wish to seize the
opportunity of taking a stroll through the town.'</p>

<p>'<i>Incedo per ignes</i>,' replied Julien: which is to say, I am
treading on dangerous ground.</p>

<p>Next morning at daybreak, Julien made his way to the Cathedral,
walking with lowered eyes. The sight of the streets and the
activity which was beginning to pervade the town did him good. On
every side people were draping the fronts of their houses for the
procession. All the time that he had spent in the Seminary seemed
to him no more than an instant. His thoughts were at Vergy, and
with that charming Amanda Binet, whom he might meet, for her café
was but little out of his way. He saw in the distance the abbe
Chas-Bernard, standing by the door of his beloved Cathedral; he was
a large man with a joyful countenance and an open air. This morning
he was triumphant: 'I have been waiting for you, my dear son,' he
called out, as soon as he caught sight of Julien, 'you are welcome.
Our labours this day will be long and hard, let us fortify
ourselves with an early breakfast; the other we shall take at ten
o'clock during high mass.'</p>

<p>'I desire, Sir,' Julien said to him with an air of gravity, 'not
to be left alone for a moment; kindly observe,' he added, pointing
to the clock above their heads, 'that I have arrived at one minute
before five.'</p>

<p>'Ah! So you are afraid of those young rascals at the Seminary!
It is too kind of you to give them a thought,' said the abbe Chas;
'is a road any the worse, because there are thorns in the hedges on
either side of it? The traveller goes his way and leaves the wicked
thorns to wither where they are. However, we must to work, my dear
friend, to work.'</p>

<p>The abbe Chas had been right in saying that their labours would
be hard. There had been a great funeral service in the Cathedral
the day before; it had been impossible to make any preparations;
they were obliged, therefore, in the course of the morning, to
drape each of the gothic pillars which separate the nave from the
aisles in a sort of jacket of red damask which rose to a height of
thirty feet. The Bishop had ordered four decorators from Paris by
mail coach, but these gentlemen could not do everything themselves,
and so far from encouraging the awkward efforts of their Bisontine
colleagues they increased their awkwardness by laughing at it.</p>

<p>Julien saw that he would have to go up the ladders himself, his
agility stood him in good stead. He undertook to direct the local
decorators in person. The abbe Chas was in ecstasies as he watched
him spring from one ladder to another. When all the pillars were
hung with damask, the next thing was to go and place five enormous
bunches of plumes on top of the great baldachino, over the high
altar. A richly gilded wooden crown was supported on eight great
twisted columns of Italian marble. But, in order to reach the
centre of the baldachino, over the tabernacle, one had to step
across an old wooden cornice, possibly worm-eaten, and forty feet
from the ground.</p>

<p>The sight of this perilous ascent had extinguished the gaiety,
so brilliant until then, of the Parisian decorators; they looked at
it from beneath, discussed it volubly, and did not go up. Julien
took possession of the bunches of plumes, and ran up the ladder. He
arranged them admirably upon the ornament in the form of a crown in
the centre of the baldachino. As he stepped down from the ladder,
the abbe Chas-Bernard took him in his arms.</p>

<p>'<i>Optime</i>!' exclaimed the worthy priest, 'I shall tell
Monseigneur of this.'</p>

<p>Their ten o'clock breakfast was a merry feast. Never had the
abbe Chas seen his church looking so well.</p>

<p>'My dear disciple,' he said to Julien, 'my mother used to hire
out chairs in this venerable fane, so that I was brought up in this
great edifice. Robespierre's Terror ruined us; but, at eight years
old, as I then was, I was already serving masses in private houses,
and their owners gave me my dinner on mass days. No one could fold
a chasuble better than I, the gold braid was never broken. Since
the restoration of the Faith by Napoleon, it has been my happy lot
to take charge of everything in this venerable mother church. On
five days in the year, my eyes behold it decked out with these
beautiful ornaments. But never has it been so resplendent, never
have the damask strips been so well hung as they are today, have
they clung so to the pillars.'</p>

<p>'At last, he is going to tell me his secret,' thought Julien,
'here he is talking to me of himself; he is beginning to expand.'
But nothing imprudent was said by this man, evidently in an excited
state. 'And yet he has worked hard, he is happy,' Julien said to
himself, 'the good wine has not been spared. What a man! What an
example for me! He takes the prize.' (This was a low expression
which he had picked up from the old surgeon.)</p>

<p>When the Sanctus bell rang during high mass, Julien wished to
put on a surplice so as to follow the Bishop in the superb
procession.</p>

<p>'And the robbers, my friend, the robbers!' cried the abbe Chas,
'you forget them. The procession is going out; the church will be
left empty; we must keep watch, you and I. We shall be fortunate if
we lose only a couple of ells of that fine braid which goes round
the base of the pillars. That is another gift from Madame de
Rubempre; it comes from the famous Count, her great-grandfather; it
is pure gold, my friend,' the abbe went on, whispering in his ear,
and with an air of evident exaltation, 'nothing false about it! I
entrust to you the inspection of the north aisle, do not stir from
it. I keep for myself the south aisle and nave. Keep an eye on the
confessionals; it is there that the robbers' women spies watch for
the moment when our backs are turned.'</p>

<p>As he finished speaking, the quarter before twelve struck, at
once the big bell began to toll. It was being pulled with all the
ringers' might; the rich and solemn sound stirred Julien deeply.
His imagination rose from the ground.</p>

<p>The odour of the incense and of the rose leaves strewn before
the Blessed Sacrament by children dressed as little Saint Johns,
intensified his excitement.</p>

<p>The sober note of the bell ought to have suggested to Julien
only the thought of the work of a score of men earning fifty
centimes, and assisted perhaps by fifteen or twenty of the
faithful. He ought to have thought of the wear and tear of the
ropes, of the timber, of the danger from the bell itself which fell
every two hundred years, and to have planned some way of
diminishing the wage of the ringers, or of paying them with some
indulgence or other favour drawn from the spiritual treasury of the
Church, with no strain upon her purse.</p>

<p>In place of these sage reflections, Julien's soul, excited by
these rich and virile sounds, was straying through imaginary space.
Never will he make either a good priest or a great administrator.
Souls that are moved thus are capable at most of producing an
artist. Here Julien's presumption breaks out in the full light of
day. Fifty, perhaps, of his fellow seminarists, made attentive to
the realities of life by the public hatred and Jacobinism which,
they are told, is lurking behind every hedge, on hearing the big
bell of the Cathedral, would have thought only of the wages paid to
the ringers. They would have applied the genius of a Bareme to
determine the question whether the degree of emotion aroused in the
public was worth the money given to the ringers. Had Julien chosen
to give his mind to the material interests of the Cathedral, his
imagination flying beyond its goal would have thought of saving
forty francs for the Chapter, and would have let slip the
opportunity of avoiding an outlay of twenty-five centimes.</p>

<p>While, in the most perfect weather ever seen, the procession
wound its way slowly through Besançon, and halted at the glittering
stations which all the local authorities had vied with one another
in erecting, the church remained wrapped in a profound silence. A
suffused light, an agreeable coolness reigned in it; it was still
balmy with the fragrance of flowers and incense.</p>

<p>The silence, the profound solitude, the coolness of the long
aisles, made Julien's musings all the sweeter. He had no fear of
being disturbed by the abbe Chas, who was occupied in another part
of the building. His soul had almost quitted its mortal envelope,
which was strolling at a slow pace along the north aisle committed
to his charge. He was all the more at rest, since he was certain
that there was nobody in the confessionals save a few devout women;
he saw without observing.</p>

<p>His distraction was nevertheless half conquered by the sight of
two women extremely well dressed who were kneeling, one of them in
a confessional, the other, close beside her, upon a chair. He saw
without observing them; at the same time, whether from a vague
sense of his duty, or from admiration of the plain but noble attire
of these ladies, he remarked that there was no priest in that
confessional. 'It is strange,' he thought, 'that these beautiful
ladies are not kneeling before some station, if they are religious;
or placed in good seats in the front of some balcony, if they are
fashionable. How well cut that gown is! What grace!' He slackened
his pace in order to see their faces.</p>

<p>The one who was kneeling in the confessional turned her head
slightly on hearing the sound of Julien's step amid the prevailing
silence. All at once she gave a little cry, and fainted.</p>

<p>As her strength left her, this kneeling lady fell back; her
friend, who was close at hand, hastened to the rescue. At the same
time Julien caught sight of the shoulders of the lady who had
fallen back. A rope of large seed pearls, well known to him, caught
his eye. What was his state when he recognised the hair of Madame
de Rênal! It was she. The lady who was trying to hold up her head,
and to arrest her fall, was Madame Derville. Julien, beside himself
with emotion, sprang forward; Madame de Rênal's fall would perhaps
have brought down her friend if he had not supported them. He saw
Madame de Rênal's head, pale, absolutely devoid of consciousness,
drooping upon her shoulder. He helped Madame Derville to prop that
charming head against the back of a straw chair; he was on his
knees.</p>

<p>Madame Derville turned and recognised him.</p>

<p>'Fly, Sir, fly!' she said to him in accents of the most burning
anger. 'On no account must she see you again. The sight of you must
indeed fill her with horror, she was so happy before you came! Your
behaviour is atrocious. Fly; be off with you, if you have any shame
left.'</p>

<p>This speech was uttered with such authority, and Julien felt so
weak at the moment, that he withdrew. 'She always hated me,' he
said to himself, thinking of Madame Derville.</p>

<p>At that moment, the nasal chant of the leading priests in the
procession rang through the church; the procession was returning.
The abbe Chas-Bernard called repeatedly to Julien, who at first did
not hear him: finally he came and led him by the arm from behind a
pillar where Julien had taken refuge more dead than alive. He
wished to present him to the Bishop.</p>

<p>'You are feeling unwell, my child,' said the abbe, seeing him so
pale and almost unable to walk; 'you have been working too hard.'
The abbe gave him his arm. 'Come, sit down here, on the sacristan's
little stool, behind me; I shall screen you.' They were now by the
side of the main door. 'Calm yourself, we have still a good twenty
minutes before Monseigneur appears. Try to recover yourself; when
he passes, I shall hold you up, for I am strong and vigorous, in
spite of my age.'</p>

<p>But when the Bishop passed, Julien was so tremulous that the
abbe Chas abandoned the idea of presenting him.</p>

<p>'Do not worry yourself about it,' he told him, 'I shall find
another opportunity.'</p>

<p>That evening, he sent down to the chapel of the Seminary ten
pounds of candles, saved, he said, by Julien's efforts and the
rapidity with which he extinguished them. Nothing could have been
farther from the truth. The poor boy was himself extinguished; he
had not had a thought in his head after seeing Madame de Rênal.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch29" id="ch29"></a>Chapter 29. The First Step</h2>

<p style="margin-left:10%">He knew his times, he knew his
departement, and he is rich. &mdash;<i>Le Precurseur</i></p>

<p>Julien had not yet recovered from the profound abstraction in
which the incident in the Cathedral had plunged him, when one
morning the grim abbe Pirard sent for him.</p>

<p>'Here is M. l'abbe Chas-Bernard writing to me to commend you. I
am quite satisfied with your conduct as a whole. You are extremely
imprudent and indeed stupid, without showing it; however, up to the
present your heart is sound and even generous; your intellect is
above the average. Taking you all in all, I see a spark in you
which must not be neglected.</p>

<p>'After fifteen years of labour, I am on the eve of leaving this
establishment: my crime is that of having allowed the seminarists
to use their own judgment, and of having neither protected nor
unmasked that secret society of which you have spoken to me at the
stool of penitence. Before I go, I wish to do something for you; I
should have acted two months ago, for you deserve it, but for the
accusation based upon the address of Amanda Binet, which was found
in your possession. I appoint you tutor in the New and Old
Testaments.'</p>

<p>Julien, in a transport of gratitude, quite thought of falling on
his knees and thanking God; but he yielded to a more genuine
impulse. He went up to the abbe Pirard and took his hand, which he
raised to his lips.</p>

<p>'What is this?' cried the Director in a tone of annoyance; but
Julien's eyes were even more eloquent than his action.</p>

<p>The abbe Pirard gazed at him in astonishment, like a man who, in
the course of long years, has fallen out of the way of meeting with
delicate emotions. This attention pierced the Director's armour;
his voice changed.</p>

<p>'Ah, well! Yes, my child, I am attached to you. Heaven knows
that it is entirely against my will. I ought to be just, and to
feel neither hatred nor love for anyone. Your career will be
difficult. I see in you something that offends the common herd.
Jealousy and calumny will pursue you. In whatever place Providence
may set you, your companions will never set eyes on you without
hating you; and if they pretend to love you, it will be in order to
betray you the more surely. For this there is but one remedy: have
recourse only to God, who has given you, to punish you for your
presumption, this necessity of being hated; let your conduct be
pure; that is the sole resource that I can see for you. If you hold
fast to the truth with an invincible embrace, sooner or later your
enemies will be put to confusion."</p>

<p>It was so long since Julien had heard a friendly voice, that we
must forgive him a weakness: he burst into tears. The abbe Pirard
opened his arms to embrace him; the moment was very precious to
them both.</p>

<p>Julien was wild with joy; this promotion was the first that he
had obtained; the advantages were immense. In order to realise
them, one must have been condemned to pass whole months without a
moment's solitude, and in immediate contact with companions at best
tiresome, and mostly intolerable. Their shouts alone would have
been enough to create disorder in a sensitive organism. The
boisterous joy of these peasants well fed and well dressed, could
find expression, thought itself complete only when they were
shouting with the full force of their lungs.</p>

<p>Now Julien dined by himself, or almost so, an hour later than
the rest of the seminarists. He had a key to the garden, and might
walk there at the hours when it was empty.</p>

<p>Greatly to his surprise, Julien noticed that they hated him
less; he had been expecting, on the contrary, an intensification of
their hatred. That secret desire that no one should speak to him,
which was all too apparent and had made him so many enemies, was no
longer a sign of absurd pride. In the eyes of the coarse beings
among whom he lived, it was a proper sense of his own dignity.
Their hatred diminished perceptibly, especially among the youngest
of his companions, now become his pupils, whom he treated with
great courtesy. In course of time he had even supporters; it became
bad form to call him Martin Luther.</p>

<p>But why speak of his friends, his enemies? It is all so ugly,
and all the more ugly, the more accurately it is drawn from life.
These are however the only teachers of ethics that the people have,
and without them where should we be? Will the newspaper ever manage
to take the place of the parish priest?</p>

<p>Since Julien's promotion, the Director of the Seminary made a
point of never speaking to him except in the presence of witnesses.
This was only prudent, in the master's interest as well as the
pupil's; but more than anything else it was a test. The stern
Jansenist Pirard's invariable principle was: 'Has a man any merit
in your eyes? Place an obstacle in the way of everything that he
desires, everything that he undertakes. If his merit be genuine, he
will certainly be able to surmount or thrust aside your
obstacles.'</p>

<p>It was the hunting season. Fouque took it into his head to send
to the Seminary a stag and a boar in the name of Julien's family.
The dead animals were left lying in the passage, between kitchen
and refectory. There all the seminarists saw them on their way to
dinner. They aroused much interest. The boar, although stone dead,
frightened the younger boys; they fingered his tusks. Nothing else
was spoken of for a week.</p>

<p>This present, which classified Julien's family in the section of
society that one must respect, dealt a mortal blow to jealousy. It
was a form of superiority consecrated by fortune. Chazel and the
most distinguished of the seminarists made overtures to him, and
almost complained to him that he had not warned them of his
parents' wealth, and had thus betrayed them into showing a want of
respect for money.</p>

<p>There was a conscription from which Julien was exempt in his
capacity as a seminarist. This incident moved him deeply. 'And so
there has passed now for ever the moment at which, twenty years
ago, a heroic life would have begun for me!'</p>

<p>Walking by himself in the Seminary garden, he overheard a
conversation between two masons who were at work upon the enclosing
wall.</p>

<p>'Ah, well! One will have to go, here's another
conscription.'</p>

<p>In the <i>other man's</i> days, well and good! A stone mason
became an officer, and became a general, that has been known.'</p>

<p>'Look what it's like now! Only the beggars go. A man with the
<i>wherewithal</i> stays at home.'</p>

<p>'The man who is born poor stays poor, and that's all there is to
it.'</p>

<p>'Tell me, now, is it true what people say, that the other is
dead?' put in a third mason.</p>

<p>'It's the big ones who say that, don't you see? They were afraid
of the other.'</p>

<p>'What a difference, how well everything went in his time! And to
think that he was betrayed by his Marshals! There must always be a
traitor somewhere!'</p>

<p>This conversation comforted Julien a little. As he walked away
he repeated to himself with a sigh:</p>

<p>'The only King whose memory the people cherish still!'</p>

<p>The examinations came round. Julien answered the questions in a
brilliant manner; he saw that Chazel himself was seeking to display
the whole extent of his knowledge.</p>

<p>On the first day, the examiners appointed by the famous
Vicar-General de Frilair greatly resented having always to place
first, or at the very most second on their list this Julien Sorel
who had been pointed out to them as the favourite of the abbe
Pirard. Wagers were made in the Seminary that in the aggregate list
of the examinations, Julien would occupy the first place, a
distinction that carried with it the honour of dining with the
Bishop. But at the end of one session, in which the subject had
been the Fathers of the Church, a skilful examiner, after
questioning Julien upon Saint Jerome, and his passion for Cicero,
began to speak of Horace, Virgil and other profane authors. Unknown
to his companions, Julien had learned by heart a great number of
passages from these authors. Carried away by his earlier successes,
he forgot where he was and, at the repeated request of the
examiner, recited and paraphrased with enthusiasm several odes of
Horace. Having let him sink deeper and deeper for twenty minutes,
suddenly the examiner's face changed, and he delivered a stinging
rebuke to Julien for having wasted his time in these profane
studies, and stuffed his head with useless if not criminal
thoughts.</p>

<p>'I am a fool, Sir, and you are right,' said Julien with a modest
air, as he saw the clever stratagem by which he had been taken
in.</p>

<p>This ruse on the examiner's part was considered a dirty trick,
even in the Seminary, though this did not prevent M. l'abbe de
Frilair, that clever man, who had so ably organised the framework
of the Bisontine <i>Congregation</i>, and whose reports to Paris
made judges, prefect, and even the general officers of the garrison
tremble, from setting, with his powerful hand, the number 198
against Julien's name. He was delighted thus to mortify his enemy,
the Jansenist Pirard.</p>

<p>For the last ten years his great ambition had been to remove
Pirard from control of the Seminary. That cleric, following in his
own conduct the principles which he had outlined to Julien, was
sincere, devout, innocent of intrigue, devoted to his duty. But
heaven, in its wrath, had given him that splenetic temperament,
bound to feel deeply insults and hatred. Not one of the affronts
that were put upon him was lost upon his ardent spirit. He would
have offered his resignation a hundred times, but he believed that
he was of use in the post in which Providence had placed him. 'I
prevent the spread of Jesuitry and idolatry,' he used to say to
himself.</p>

<p>At the time of the examinations, it was perhaps two months since
he had spoken to Julien, and yet he was ill for a week, when, on
receiving the official letter announcing the result of the
competition, he saw the number 198 set against the name of that
pupil whom he regarded as the glory of his establishment. The only
consolation for this stern character was to concentrate upon Julien
all the vigilance at his command. He was delighted to find in him
neither anger nor thoughts of revenge, nor discouragement.</p>

<p>Some weeks later, Julien shuddered on receiving a letter; it
bore the Paris postmark. 'At last,' he thought, 'Madame de Rênal
has remembered her promises.' A gentleman who signed himself Paul
Sorel, and professed to be related to him, sent him a bill of
exchange for five hundred francs. The writer added that if Julien
continued to study with success the best Latin authors, a similar
sum would be sent to him every year.</p>

<p>'It is she, it is her bounty!' Julien said to himself with
emotion, 'she wishes to comfort me; but why is there not one word
of affection?'</p>

<p>He was mistaken with regard to the letter; Madame de Rênal,
under the influence of her friend Madame Derville, was entirely
absorbed in her own profound remorse. In spite of herself, she
often thought of the strange creature whose coming into her life
had so upset it, but she would never have dreamed of writing to
him.</p>

<p>If we spoke the language of the Seminary, we might see a miracle
in this windfall of five hundred francs, and say that it was M. de
Frilair himself that heaven had employed to make this gift to
Julien.</p>

<p>Twelve years earlier, M. l'abbe de Frilair had arrived at
Besançon with the lightest of portmanteaux, which, the story went,
contained his entire fortune. He now found himself one of the
wealthiest landowners in the Department. In the course of his
growing prosperity he had purchased one half of an estate of which
the other half passed by inheritance to M. de La Mole. Hence a
great lawsuit between these worthies.</p>

<p>Despite his brilliant existence in Paris, and the posts which he
held at court, the Marquis de La Mole felt that it was dangerous to
fight down at Besançon against a Vicar-General who was reputed to
make and unmake Prefects. Instead of asking for a gratuity of fifty
thousand francs, disguised under some head or other that would pass
in the budget, and allowing M. de Frilair to win this pettifogging
action for fifty thousand francs, the Marquis took offence. He
believed that he had a case: a fine reason!</p>

<p>For, if we may be so bold as to say it: what judge is there who
has not a son, or at least a cousin to help on in the world?</p>

<p>To enlighten the less clear-sighted, a week after the first
judgment that he obtained, M. l'abbe de Frilair took the Bishop's
carriage, and went in person to convey the Cross of the Legion of
Honour to his counsel. M. de La Mole, somewhat dismayed by the bold
front assumed by the other side, and feeling that his own counsel
were weakening, asked the advice of the abbe Chélan, who put him in
touch with M. Pirard.</p>

<p>At the date of our story they had been corresponding thus for
some years. The abbe Pirard dashed into the business with all the
force of his passionate nature. In constant communication with the
Marquis's counsel, he studied his case, and finding him to be in
the right, openly declared himself a partisan of the Marquis de La
Mole against the all powerful Vicar-General. The latter was furious
at such insolence, and coming from a little Jansenist to boot!</p>

<p>'You see what these court nobles are worth who claim to have
such power!' the abbe de Frilair would say to his intimates; 'M. de
La Mole has not sent so much as a wretched Cross to his agent at
Besançon, and is going to allow him to be deprived of his post
without a murmur. And yet, my friends write to me, this noble peer
never allows a week to pass without going to show off his blue
riband in the drawing-room of the Keeper of the Seals, for what
that is worth.'</p>

<p>In spite of all M. Pirard's activity, and albeit M. de La Mole
was always on the best of terms with the Minister of Justice and
still more with his officials, all that he had been able to
achieve, after six years of constant effort, was to avoid actually
losing his case.</p>

<p>In ceaseless correspondence with the abbe Pirard, over an affair
which they both pursued with passion, the Marquis came in time to
appreciate the abbe's type of mind. Gradually, despite the immense
gulf between their social positions, their correspondence took on a
tone of friendship. The abbe Pirard told the Marquis that his
enemies were seeking to oblige him, by their insults, to offer his
resignation. In the anger which he felt at the infamous stratagem
(according to him) employed against Julien, he related the latter's
story to the Marquis.</p>

<p>Although extremely rich, this great nobleman was not in the
least a miser. He had never once been able to make the abbe Pirard
accept so much as the cost of postage occasioned by the lawsuit. He
took the opportunity to send five hundred francs to the abbe's
favourite pupil.</p>

<p>M. de La Mole took the trouble to write the covering letter with
his own hand. This set him thinking of the abbe.</p>

<p>One day the latter received a short note in which he was
requested to call at once, upon urgent business, at an inn on the
outskirts of Besançon. There he found M. de La Mole's steward.</p>

<p>'M. le Marquis has instructed me to bring you his carriage,' he
was informed. 'He hopes that after you have read this letter, you
will find it convenient to start for Paris, in four or five days
from now. I am going to employ the time which you will be so kind
as to indicate to me in visiting the estates of M. le Marquis in
the Franche-Comté. After which, on whatever day suits you, we shall
start for Paris.'</p>

<p>The letter was brief:</p>

<p>'Rid yourself, my dear Sir, of all these provincial bickerings,
come and breathe a calmer air in Paris. I am sending you my
carriage, which has orders to await your decision for four days. I
shall wait for you myself, in Paris, until Tuesday. It requires
only the word yes, from you, Sir, to make me accept in your name
one of the best livings in the neighbourhood of Paris. The
wealthiest of your future parishioners has never set eyes on you,
but is devoted to you more warmly than you can suppose; he is the
Marquis de La Mole.'</p>

<p>Without knowing it, the stern abbe Pirard loved this Seminary,
peopled with his enemies, to which, for fifteen years, he had
devoted all his thoughts. M. de La Mole's letter was to him like
the sudden appearance of a surgeon with the duty of performing a
painful but necessary operation. His dismissal was certain. He gave
the steward an appointment, in three days' time.</p>

<p>For the next forty-eight hours, he was in a fever of
uncertainty. Finally, he wrote to M. de La Mole and composed, for
the Bishop's benefit, a letter, a masterpiece of ecclesiastical
diction, though a trifle long. It would have been difficult to find
language more irreproachable, or breathing a more sincere respect.
And yet this letter, intended to give M. de Frilair a trying hour
with his patron, enumerated all the serious grounds for complaint
and descended to the sordid little pinpricks which, after he had
borne them, with resignation, for six years, were forcing the abbe
Pirard to leave the diocese.</p>

<p>They stole the wood from his shed, they poisoned his dog, etc.,
etc.</p>

<p>This letter written, he sent to awaken Julien who, at eight
o'clock in the evening, was already asleep, as were all the
seminarists.</p>

<p>'You know where the Bishop's Palace is?' he said to him in the
best Latin; 'take this letter to Monseigneur. I shall not attempt
to conceal from you that I am sending you amongst wolves. Be all
eyes and ears. No prevarication in your answers; but remember that
the man who is questioning you would perhaps take a real delight in
trying to harm you. I am glad, my child, to give you this
experience before I leave you, for I do not conceal from you that
the letter which you are taking contains my resignation.'</p>

<p>Julien did not move; he was fond of the abbe Pirard. In vain
might prudence warn him:</p>

<p>'After this worthy man's departure, the Sacred Heart party will
degrade and perhaps even expel me.'</p>

<p>He could not think about himself. What embarrassed him was a
sentence which he wished to cast in a polite form, but really he
was incapable of using his mind.</p>

<p>'Well, my friend, aren't you going?'</p>

<p>'You see, Sir, they say,' Julien began timidly, 'that during
your long administration here, you have never put anything aside. I
have six hundred francs.'</p>

<p>Tears prevented him from continuing.</p>

<p>'That too will be noticed,' said the ex-Director of the Seminary
coldly. 'Go to the Palace, it is getting late.'</p>

<p>As luck would have it, that evening M. l'abbe de Frilair was in
attendance in the Bishop's parlour; Monseigneur was dining at the
Prefecture. So that it was to M. de Frilair himself that Julien
gave the letter, but he did not know who he was.</p>

<p>Julien saw with astonishment that this priest boldly opened the
letter addressed to the Bishop. The fine features of the
Vicar-General soon revealed a surprise mingled with keen pleasure,
and his gravity increased. While he was reading, Julien, struck by
his good looks, had time to examine him. It was a face that would
have had more gravity but for the extreme subtlety that appeared in
certain of its features, and would actually have suggested
dishonesty, if the owner of that handsome face had ceased for a
moment to control it. The nose, which was extremely prominent,
formed an unbroken and perfectly straight line, and gave
unfortunately to a profile that otherwise was most distinguished,
an irremediable resemblance to the mask of a fox. In addition, this
abbe who seemed so greatly interested in M. Pirard's resignation,
was dressed with an elegance that greatly pleased Julien, who had
never seen its like on any other priest.</p>

<p>It was only afterwards that Julien learned what was the abbe de
Frilair's special talent. He knew how to amuse his Bishop, a
pleasant old man, made to live in Paris, who regarded Besançon as a
place of exile. This Bishop was extremely short-sighted, and
passionately fond of fish. The abbe de Frilair used to remove the
bones from the fish that was set before Monseigneur.</p>

<p>Julien was silently watching the abbe as he read over again the
letter of resignation, when suddenly the door burst open. A lackey,
richly attired, passed rapidly through the room. Julien had barely
time to turn towards the door; he saw a little old man, wearing a
pectoral cross. He fell on his knees: the Bishop bestowed a kind
smile upon him as he passed through the room. The handsome abbe
followed him, and Julien was left alone in this parlour, the pious
magnificence of which he could now admire at his leisure.</p>

<p>The Bishop of Besançon, a man of character, tried, but not
crushed by the long hardships of the Emigration, was more than
seventy-five, and cared infinitely little about what might happen
in the next ten years.</p>

<p>'Who is that clever-looking seminarist, whom I seemed to see as
I passed?' said the Bishop. 'Ought they not, by my orders, to be in
their beds at this hour?'</p>

<p>'This one is quite wide awake, I assure you, Monseigneur, and he
brings great news: the resignation of the only Jansenist left in
your diocese. That terrible abbe Pirard understands at last the
meaning of a hint.'</p>

<p>'Well,' said the Bishop with a laugh, 'I defy you to fill his
place with a man of his quality. And to show you the value of the
man, I invite him to dine with me tomorrow.'</p>

<p>The Vicar-General wished to insinuate a few words as to the
choice of a successor. The prelate, little disposed to discuss
business, said to him:</p>

<p>'Before we put in the next man, let us try to discover why this
one is going. Fetch me in that seminarist, the truth is to be found
in the mouths of babes.'</p>

<p>Julien was summoned: 'I shall find myself trapped between two
inquisitors,' he thought. Never had he felt more courageous.</p>

<p>At the moment of his entering the room, two tall valets, better
dressed than M. Valenod himself, were disrobing Monseigneur. The
prelate, before coming to the subject of M. Pirard, thought fit to
question Julien about his studies. He touched upon dogma, and was
amazed. Presently he turned to the Humanities, Virgil, Horace,
Cicero. 'Those names,' thought Julien, 'earned me my number 198. I
have nothing more to lose, let us try to shine.' He was successful;
the prelate, an excellent humanist himself, was enchanted.</p>

<p>At dinner at the Prefecture, a girl, deservedly famous, had
recited the poem of <i>La Madeleine</i>. [Footnote: A poem by
Delphine Gay] He was in the mood for literary conversation, and at
once forgot the abbe Pirard and everything else, in discussing with
the seminarist the important question, whether Horace had been rich
or poor. The prelate quoted a number of odes, but at times his
memory began to fail him, and immediately Julien would recite the
entire ode, with a modest air; what struck the Bishop was that
Julien never departed from the tone of the conversation; he said
his twenty or thirty Latin verses as he would have spoken of what
was going on in his Seminary. A long discussion followed of Virgil
and Cicero. At length the prelate could not refrain from paying the
young seminarist a compliment.</p>

<p>'It would be impossible to have studied to better
advantage.'</p>

<p>'Monseigneur,' said Julien, 'your Seminary can furnish you with
one hundred and ninety-seven subjects far less unworthy of your
esteemed approval.'</p>

<p>'How so?' said the prelate, astonished at this figure.</p>

<p>'I can support with official proof what I have the honour to say
before Monseigneur.</p>

<p>'At the annual examination of the Seminary, answering questions
upon these very subjects which have earned me, at this moment,
Monseigneur's approval, I received the number 198.'</p>

<p>'Ah! This is the abbe Pirard's favourite,' exclaimed the Bishop,
with a laugh, and with a glance at M. de Frilair; 'we ought to have
expected this; but it is all in fair play. Is it not the case, my
friend,' he went on, turning to Julien, 'that they waked you from
your sleep to send you here?'</p>

<p>'Yes, Monseigneur. I have never left the Seminary alone in my
life but once, to go and help M. l'abbe Chas-Bernard to decorate
the Cathedral, on the feast of Corpus Christi.'</p>

<p>'<i>Optime</i>,' said the Bishop; 'what, it was you that showed
such great courage, by placing the bunches of plumes on the
baldachino? They make me shudder every year; I am always afraid of
their costing me a man's life. My friend, you will go far; but I do
not wish to cut short your career, which will be brilliant, by
letting you die of hunger.'</p>

<p>And, on an order from the Bishop, the servants brought in
biscuits and Malaga wine, to which Julien did honour, and even more
so than abbe Frilair, who knew that his Bishop liked to see him eat
cheerfully and with a good appetite.</p>

<p>The prelate, growing more and more pleased with the close of his
evening, spoke for a moment of ecclesiastical history. He saw that
Julien did not understand. He then passed to the moral conditions
of the Roman Empire, under the Emperors of the Age of Constantine.
The last days of paganism were accompanied by that state of
uneasiness and doubt which, in the nineteenth century, is
disturbing sad and weary minds. Monseigneur remarked that Julien
seemed hardly to know even the name of Tacitus.</p>

<p>Julien replied with candour, to the astonishment of the prelate,
that this author was not to be found in the library of the
Seminary.</p>

<p>'I am really delighted to hear it,' said the Bishop merrily.
'You relieve me of a difficulty; for the last ten minutes, I have
been trying to think of a way of thanking you for the pleasant
evening which you have given me, and certainly in a most unexpected
manner. Although the gift is scarcely canonical, I should like to
give you a set of Tacitus.'</p>

<p>The prelate sent for eight volumes handsomely bound, and
insisted upon writing with his own hand, on the title-page of the
first, a Latin inscription to Julien Sorel. The Bishop prided
himself on his fine Latinity; he ended by saying to him, in a
serious tone, completely at variance with his tone throughout the
rest of the conversation:</p>

<p>'Young man, if you are wise, you shall one day have the best
living in my diocese, and not a hundred leagues from my episcopal
Palace; but you must be wise.'</p>

<p>Julien, burdened with his volumes, left the Palace, in great
bewilderment, as midnight was striking.</p>

<p>Monseigneur had not said a word to him about the abbe Pirard.
Julien was astonished most of all by the extreme politeness shown
him by the Bishop. He had never imagined such an urbanity of form,
combined with so natural an air of dignity. He was greatly struck
by the contrast when he set eyes once more on the sombre abbe
Pirard, who awaited him with growing impatience.</p>

<p>'<i>Quid tibi dixerunt</i>? (What did they say to you?)' he
shouted at the top of his voice, the moment Julien came within
sight.</p>

<p>Then, as Julien found some difficulty in translating the
Bishop's conversation into Latin:</p>

<p>'Speak French, and repeat to me Monseigneur's own words, without
adding or omitting anything,' said the ex-Director of the Seminary,
in his harsh tone and profoundly inelegant manner.</p>

<p>'What a strange present for a Bishop to make to a young
seminarist,' he said as he turned the pages of the sumptuous
Tacitus, the gilded edges of which seemed to fill him with
horror.</p>

<p>Two o'clock was striking when, after a detailed report of
everything, he allowed his favourite pupil to retire to his own
room.</p>

<p>'Leave me the first volume of your Tacitus, which contains the
Bishop's inscription,' he said to him. 'That line of Latin will be
your lightning conductor in this place, when I have gone.</p>

<p>'<i>Erit tibi, fili mi, successor meus tanquam leo quaerens
quern devoret</i>. (My successor will be to you, my son, as a lion
seeking whom he may devour.)'</p>

<p>On the following morning, Julien detected something strange in
the manner in which his companions addressed him. This made him all
the more reserved. 'Here,' he thought, 'we have the effect of M.
Pirard's resignation. It is known throughout the place, and I am
supposed to be his favourite. There must be an insult behind this
attitude'; but he could not discover it. There was, on the
contrary, an absence of hatred in the eyes of all whom he
encountered in the dormitories. 'What can this mean? It is
doubtless a trap, we are playing a close game.' At length the young
seminarist from Verrières said to him with a laugh: '<i>Cornelii
Taciti opera omnia</i> (Complete Works of Tacitus).'</p>

<p>At this speech, which was overheard, all the rest seemed to vie
with one another in congratulating Julien, not only upon the
magnificent present which he had received from Monseigneur, but
also upon the two hours of conversation with which he had been
honoured. It was common knowledge, down to the most trifling
details. From this moment, there was no more jealousy; everyone
paid court to him most humbly; the abbe Castanede who, only
yesterday, had treated him with the utmost insolence, came to take
him by the arm and invited him to luncheon.</p>

<p>Owing to a weakness in Julien's character, the insolence of
these coarse creatures had greatly distressed him; their servility
caused him disgust and no pleasure.</p>

<p>Towards midday, the abbe Pirard took leave of his pupils, not
without first delivering a severe allocution. 'Do you seek the
honours of this world,' he said to them, 'all social advantages,
the pleasure of commanding men, that of defying the laws and of
being insolent to all men with impunity? Or indeed do you seek your
eternal salvation? The most ignorant among you have only to open
their eyes to distinguish between the two paths.'</p>

<p>No sooner had he left than the devotees of the Sacred Heart of
Jesus went to chant a <i>Te Deum</i> in the chapel. Nobody in the
Seminary took the late Director's allocution seriously. 'He is very
cross at being dismissed,' was what might be heard on all sides.
Not one seminarist was simple enough to believe in the voluntary
resignation of a post which provided so many opportunities for
dealing with the big contractors.</p>

<p>The abbe Pirard took up his abode in the best inn in Besançon;
and on the pretext of some imaginary private affairs, proposed to
spend a couple of days there.</p>

<p>The Bishop invited him to dinner, and, to tease his
Vicar-General, de Frilair, endeavoured to make him shine. They had
reached the dessert when there arrived from Paris the strange
tidings that the abbe Pirard was appointed to the splendid living
of N &mdash;&mdash;, within four leagues of the capital. The worthy
prelate congratulated him sincerely. He saw in the whole affair a
well played game which put him in a good humour and gave him the
highest opinion of the abbe's talents. He bestowed upon him a
magnificent certificate in Latin, and silenced the abbe de Frilair,
who ventured to make remonstrances.</p>

<p>That evening, Monseigneur carried his admiration to the
drawing-room of the Marquise de Rubempre. It was a great piece of
news for the select society of Besançon; people were lost in
conjectures as to the meaning of this extraordinary favour. They
saw the abbe Pirard a Bishop already. The sharper wits supposed M.
de La Mole to have become a Minister, and allowed themselves that
evening to smile at the imperious airs which M. l'abbe de Frilair
assumed in society.</p>

<p>Next morning, the abbe Pirard was almost followed through the
streets, and the tradesmen came out to their shop-doors when he
went to beg an audience of the Marquis's judges. For the first
time, he was received by them with civility. The stern Jansenist,
indignant at everything that he saw around him, spent a long time
at work with the counsel whom he had chosen for the Marquis de La
Mole, and then left for Paris. He was so foolish as to say to two
or three lifelong friends who escorted him to the carriage and
stood admiring its heraldic blason, that after governing the
Seminary for fifteen years he was leaving Besançon with five
hundred and twenty francs in savings. These friends embraced him
with tears in their eyes, and then said to one another: The good
abbe might have spared himself that lie, it is really too
absurd.'</p>

<p>The common herd, blinded by love of money, were not fitted to
understand that it was in his sincerity that the abbe Pirard had
found the strength to fight single-handed for six years against
Marie Alacoque, the Sacred Heart of Jesus, the Jesuits and his
Bishop.</p>

<h2><a name="ch30" id="ch30"></a>Chapter 30. Ambition</h2>

<p style="margin-left:10%">There is only one true nobility left;
namely, the title of Duke;<br>
Marquis is absurd, at the word Duke one turns one's head.<br>
&mdash;<i>The Edinburgh Review</i></p>

<p>[Trans. footnote: I have translated this motto, which is quoted
in French by Stendhal, but have not been able to find the original
passage in the <i>Edinburgh Review</i>. C. K. S. M.]</p>

<p>The Marquis de La Mole received the abbe Pirard without any of
those little mannerisms of a great gentleman, outwardly so polite,
but so impertinent to him who understands them. It would have been
a waste of time, and the Marquis was so far immersed in public
business as to have no time to waste.</p>

<p>For six months he had been intriguing to make both King and
nation accept a certain Ministry, which, as a mark of gratitude,
would make him a Duke.</p>

<p>The Marquis had appealed in vain, year after year, to his lawyer
at Besançon for a clear and definite report on his lawsuits in the
Franche-Comté. How was the eminent lawyer to explain them to him,
if he did not understand them himself?</p>

<p>The little slip of paper which the abbe gave him explained
everything.</p>

<p>'My dear abbe,' said the Marquis, after polishing off in less
than five minutes all the polite formulas and personal inquiries,
'my dear abbe, in the midst of my supposed prosperity, I lack the
time to occupy myself seriously with two little matters which
nevertheless are of considerable importance: my family and my
affairs. I take the greatest interest in the fortunes of my house,
I may carry it far; I look after my pleasures, and that is what
must come before everything else, at least in my eyes,' he went on,
noticing the astonishment in the eyes of the abbe Pirard. Although
a man of sense, the abbe was amazed to see an old man talking so
openly of his pleasures.</p>

<p>'Work does no doubt exist in Paris,' the great nobleman
continued, 'but perched in the attics; and as soon as I come in
contact with a man, he takes an apartment on the second floor, and
his wife starts a day; consequently, no more work, no effort except
to be or to appear to be a man of fashion. That is their sole
interest once they are provided with bread.</p>

<p>'For my lawsuits, to be strictly accurate, and also for each
lawsuit separately, I have lawyers who work themselves to death;
one of them died of consumption, the day before yesterday. But, for
my affairs in general, would you believe, Sir, that for the last
three years I have given up hope of finding a man who, while he is
writing for me, will deign to think a little seriously of what he
is doing. However, all this is only a preamble.</p>

<p>'I respect you, and, I would venture to add, although we meet
for the first time, I like you. Will you be my secretary, with a
salary of eight thousand francs, or indeed twice that sum? I shall
gain even more, I assure you; and I shall make it my business to
keep your fine living for you, for the day on which we cease to
agree.'</p>

<p>The abbe declined, but towards the end of the conversation, the
sight of the Marquis's genuine embarrassment suggested an idea to
him.</p>

<p>'I have left down in my Seminary a poor young man who, if I be
not mistaken, is going to be brutally persecuted. If he were only a
simple monk he would be already <i>in pace</i>.</p>

<p>'At present this young man knows only Latin and the Holy
Scriptures; but it is by no means impossible that one day he may
display great talent, either for preaching or for the guidance of
souls. I do not know what he will do; but he has the sacred fire,
he may go far. I intended to give him to our Bishop, should one
ever be sent to us who had something of your way of looking at men
and affairs.'</p>

<p>'What is your young man's origin?' said the Marquis.</p>

<p>'He is said to be the son of a carpenter in our mountains, but I
am inclined to believe that he is the natural son of some rich man.
I have seen him receive an anonymous or pseudonymous letter
containing a bill of exchange for five hundred francs.'</p>

<p>'Ah! It is Julien Sorel,' said the Marquis.</p>

<p>'How do you know his name?' asked the astonished abbe; and, as
he was blushing at his own question:</p>

<p>'That is what I am not going to tell you,' replied the
Marquis.</p>

<p>'Very well!' the abbe went on, 'you might try making him your
secretary, he has energy, and judgment; in short, it is an
experiment worth trying.'</p>

<p>'Why not?' said the Marquis; 'but would he be the sort of man to
let his palm be greased by the Prefect of Police or by anyone else,
to play the spy on me? That is my only objection.'</p>

<p>Receiving favourable assurances from the abbe Pirard, the
Marquis produced a note for one thousand francs:</p>

<p>'Send this to Julien Sorel for his journey; tell him to come to
me.'</p>

<p>'One can see,' said the abbe Pirard, 'that you live in Paris!
You are unaware of the tyranny that weighs upon us poor
provincials, and especially upon priests who are not on good terms
with the Jesuits. They will never allow Julien Sorel to leave, they
will manage to cover themselves with the cleverest excuses, they
will reply that he is ill, letters will have gone astray in the
post,' etc., etc.</p>

<p>'One of these days I shall procuré a letter from the Minister to
the Bishop,' said the Marquis.</p>

<p>'I was forgetting one thing,' said the abbe: 'this young man,
although of quite humble birth, has a proud heart, he will be of no
use to you if his pride is offended; you will only make him
stupid.'</p>

<p>'I like that,' said the Marquis, 'I shall make him my son's
companion, will that do?'</p>

<p>Some time after this, Julien received a letter in an unknown
hand and bearing the postmark of Chalons, and found a draft upon a
merchant in Besançon and instructions to proceed to Paris without
delay. The letter was signed with an assumed name, but as he opened
it Julien trembled: a leaf from a tree had fallen out at his feet;
it was the signal arranged between him and the abbe Pirard.</p>

<p>Within an hour, Julien was summoned to the Bishop's Palace,
where he found himself greeted with a wholly fatherly welcome.
Interspersed with quotations from Horace, Monseigneur paid him,
with regard to the exalted destiny that awaited him in Paris, a
number of very neat compliments, which required an explanation if
he were to express his thanks. Julien could say nothing, chiefly
because he knew nothing, and Monseigneur showed a high regard for
him. One of the minor clergy of the Palace wrote to the Mayor who
made haste to appear in person bringing a passport already signed,
but with a blank space for the name of the traveller.</p>

<p>Before midnight, Julien was with Fouque, whose sober mind was
more astonished than delighted by the future which seemed to be in
store for his friend.</p>

<p>'The end of it will be,' said this Liberal elector, 'a post
under Government, which will oblige you to take some action that
will be pilloried in the newspapers. It will be through your
disgrace that I shall have news of you. Remember that, even
financially speaking, it is better to earn one hundred louis in an
honest trade in timber, where you are your own master, than to
receive four thousand francs from a Government, were it that of
King Solomon himself.'</p>

<p>Julien saw no more in this than the pettiness of a rustic mind.
He was at last going to appear on the stage of great events. The
good fortune of going to Paris, which he peopled in his imagination
with men of intelligence, great intriguers, great hypocrites, but
as courteous as the Bishop of Besançon and the Bishop of Agde,
eclipsed everything else in his eyes. He represented himself to his
friend as deprived of his free will by the abbe Pirard's
letter.</p>

<p>Towards noon on the following day he arrived in Verrières the
happiest of men, he reckoned upon seeing Madame de Rênal again. He
went first of all to his original protector, the good abbe Chélan.
He met with a stern reception.</p>

<p>'Do you consider that you are under any obligation to me?' said
M. Chélan, without acknowledging his greeting. 'You will take
luncheon with me, meanwhile another horse will be hired for you,
and you will leave Verrières, without seeing anyone.'</p>

<p>'To hear is to obey,' replied Julien, with the prim face of a
seminarist; and there was no further discussion save of theology
and Latin scholarship.</p>

<p>He mounted his horse, rode a league, after which, coming upon a
wood, with no one to see him enter it, he hid himself there. At
sunset he sent the horse back. Later on, he entered the house of a
peasant, who agreed to sell him a ladder, and to go with him,
carrying the ladder, to the little wood that overhung the Cours de
la Fidélité, in Verrières.</p>

<p>'We are a poor conscript deserting&mdash;or a smuggler,' said the
peasant, as he took leave of him, 'but what do I care? My ladder is
well paid for, and I myself have had to pass some awkward moments
in my life.'</p>

<p>The night was very dark. About one o'clock in the morning,
Julien, carrying his ladder, made his way into Verrières. He
climbed down as soon as he could into the bed of the torrent, which
ran through M. de Rênal's magnificent gardens at a depth of ten
feet, and confined between walls. Julien climbed up easily by his
ladder. 'What sort of greeting will the watch-dogs give me?' he
wondered. 'That is the whole question.' The dogs barked, and rushed
towards him; but he whistled softly, and they came and fawned upon
him.</p>

<p>Then climbing from terrace to terrace, although all the gates
were shut, he had no difficulty in arriving immediately beneath the
window of Madame de Rênal's bedroom, which, on the garden side, was
no more than nine or ten feet above the ground.</p>

<p>There was in the shutters a small opening in the shape of a
heart, which Julien knew well. To his great dismay, this little
opening was not lighted by the glimmer of a nightlight within.</p>

<p>'Great God!' he said to himself; 'tonight, of all nights, this
room is not occupied by Madame de Rênal! Where can she be sleeping?
The family are at Verrières, since I found the dogs here; but I may
in this room, without a light, come upon M. de Rênal himself or a
stranger, and then what a scandal!'</p>

<p>The most prudent course was to retire; but the idea filled
Julien with horror. 'If it is a stranger, I shall make off as fast
as my legs will carry me, leaving my ladder behind; but if it is
she, what sort of welcome awaits me? She is steeped in repentance
and the most extreme piety, I may be sure of that; but after all,
she has still some memory of me, since she has just written to me.'
With this argument he made up his mind.</p>

<p>His heart trembling, but determined nevertheless to see her or
to perish, he flung a handful of gravel against the shutter; no
reply. He placed his ladder against the wall by the side of the
window and tapped himself on the shutter, softly at first then more
loudly. 'Dark as it is, they may fire a gun at me,' thought Julien.
This thought reduced his mad undertaking to a question of physical
courage.</p>

<p>'This room is unoccupied tonight,' he thought, 'or else whoever
it is that is sleeping here is awake by this time. So there is no
need for any further precaution here; all I need think of is not
making myself heard by the people who are sleeping in the other
rooms.'</p>

<p>He stepped down, placed his ladder against one of the shutters,
climbed up again and passing his hand through the heart-shaped
opening, was fortunate in finding almost at once the wire fastened
to the latch that closed the shutter. He pulled this wire; it was
with an unspeakable joy that he felt that the shutter was no longer
closed and was yielding to his efforts. 'I must open it little by
little and let her recognise my voice.' He opened the shutter
sufficiently to pass his head through the gap, repeating in a
whisper: 'It is a friend.'</p>

<p>He made certain, by applying his ear, that nothing broke the
profound silence in the room. But decidedly, there was no
nightlight, even half extinguished, on the hearth; this was indeed
a bad sign.</p>

<p>'Beware of a gunshot!' He thought for a moment; then, with one
finger, ventured to tap the pane: no response; he tapped more
loudly. 'Even if I break the glass, I must settle this business.'
As he was knocking hard, he thought he could just make out, in the
pitch darkness, something like a white phantom coming across the
room. In a moment, there was no doubt about it, he did see a
phantom which seemed to be advancing with extreme slowness.
Suddenly he saw a cheek pressed to the pane to which his eye was
applied.</p>

<p>He shuddered, and recoiled slightly. But the night was so dark
that, even at this close range, he could not make out whether it
was Madame de Rênal. He feared an instinctive cry of alarm; he
could hear the dogs prowling with muttered growls round the foot of
his ladder. 'It is I,' he repeated, quite loudly, 'a friend.' No
answer; the white phantom had vanished. 'For pity's sake, open the
window. I must speak to you, I am too wretched!' and he knocked
until the window nearly broke.</p>

<p>A little sharp sound was heard; the catch of the window gave
way; he pushed it open and sprang lightly into the room.</p>

<p>The white phantom moved away; he seized it by the arms; it was a
woman. All his ideas of courage melted. 'If it is she, what will
she say to me?' What was his state when he realised from a faint
cry that it was Madame de Rênal.</p>

<p>He gathered her in his arms; she trembled, and had barely the
strength to repulse him.</p>

<p>'Wretch! What are you doing?'</p>

<p>Scarcely could her tremulous voice articulate the words. Julien
saw that she was genuinely angry.</p>

<p>'I have come to see you after fourteen months of a cruel
parting.'</p>

<p>'Go, leave me this instant. Ah! M. Chélan, why did you forbid me
to write to him? I should have prevented this horror.' She thrust
him from her with a force that was indeed extraordinary. 'I repent
of my crime; heaven has deigned to enlighten me,' she repeated in a
stifled voice. 'Go! Fly!'</p>

<p>'After fourteen months of misery, I shall certainly not leave
you until I have spoken to you. I wish to know all that you have
been doing. Ah! I have loved you well enough to deserve this
confidence...I wish to know all.'</p>

<p>In spite of herself Madame de Rênal felt this tone of authority
exert its influence over her heart.</p>

<p>Julien, who was holding her in a passionate embrace, and
resisting her efforts to liberate herself, ceased to press her in
his arms. This relaxation helped to reassure Madame de Rênal.</p>

<p>'I am going to draw up the ladder,' he said, 'so that it may not
compromise us if one of the servants, awakened by the noise, goes
the rounds.'</p>

<p>'Ah! Leave me, leave me rather,' the answer came with unfeigned
anger. 'What do men matter to me? It is God that sees the terrible
wrong you are doing me, and will punish me for it. You are taking a
cowardly advantage of the regard that I once felt for you, but no
longer feel. Do you hear, Master Julien?'</p>

<p>He drew up the ladder very slowly, so as not to make any
noise.</p>

<p>'Is your husband in town?' he asked, not to defy her, but from
force of habit.</p>

<p>'Do not speak to me so, for pity's sake, or I shall call my
husband. I am all too guilty already of not having sent you away,
at any cost. I pity you,' she told him, seeking to wound his pride
which she knew to be so irritable.</p>

<p>Her refusal to use the <i>tu</i> form, that abrupt method of
breaking so tender a bond, and one upon which he still reckoned,
roused Julien's amorous transport to a frenzy.</p>

<p>'What! Is it possible that you no longer love me!' he said to
her, in those accents of the heart to which it is so difficult to
listen unmoved.</p>

<p>She made no reply; as for him, he was weeping bitter tears.</p>

<p>Really, he had no longer the strength to speak.</p>

<p>'And so I am completely forgotten by the one person who has ever
loved me! What use to live any longer?' All his courage had left
him as soon as he no longer had to fear the danger of encountering
a man; everything had vanished from his heart, save love.</p>

<p>He wept for a long time in silence. He took her hand, she tried
to withdraw it; and yet, after a few almost convulsive movements,
she let him keep it. The darkness was intense; they found
themselves both seated upon Madame de Rênal's bed.</p>

<p>'What a difference from the state of things fourteen months
ago!' thought Julien, and his flow of tears increased. 'So absence
unfailingly destroys all human feelings!</p>

<p>'Be so kind as to tell me what has happened to you,' Julien said
at length, embarrassed by his silence and in a voice almost stifled
by tears.</p>

<p>'There can be no doubt,' replied Madame de Rênal in a harsh
voice, the tone of which offered a cutting reproach to Julien, 'my
misdeeds were known in the town, at the time of your departure. You
were so imprudent in your behaviour. Some time later, when I was in
despair, the respectable M. Chélan came to see me. It was in vain
that, for a long time, he sought to obtain a confession. One day,
the idea occurred to him to take me into that church at Dijon in
which I made my first Communion. There, he ventured to broach the
subject...' Madame de Rênal's speech was interrupted by her tears.
'What a shameful moment! I confessed all. That worthy man was kind
enough not to heap on me the weight of his indignation: he shared
my distress. At that time I was writing you day after day letters
which I dared not send you; I concealed them carefully, and when I
was too wretched used to shut myself up in my room and read over my
own letters.</p>

<p>'At length, M. Chélan persuaded me to hand them over to
him...Some of them, written with a little more prudence than the
rest, had been sent to you; never once did you answer me.'</p>

<p>'Never, I swear to you, did I receive any letter from you at the
Seminary.'</p>

<p>'Great God! who can have intercepted them?'</p>

<p>'Imagine my grief; until the day when I saw you in the
Cathedral, I did not know whether you were still alive.'</p>

<p>'God in His mercy made me understand how greatly I was sinning
against Him, against my children, against my husband,' replied
Madame de Rênal. 'He has never loved me as I believed then that you
loved me ...'</p>

<p>Julien flung himself into her arms, without any definite
intention but with entire lack of self-control. But Madame de Rênal
thrust him from her, and continued quite firmly:</p>

<p>'My respectable friend M. Chélan made me realise that, in
marrying M. de Rênal, I had pledged all my affections to him, even
those of which I was still ignorant, which I had never felt before
a certain fatal intimacy... Since the great sacrifice of those
letters, which were so precious to me, my life has flowed on, if
not happily, at any rate quietly enough. Do not disturb it any
more; be a friend to me...the best of friends.' Julien covered her
hands with kisses; she could feel that he was still crying. 'Do not
cry, you distress me so...Tell me, it is your turn now, all that
you have been doing.' Julien was unable to speak. 'I wish to know
what sort of life you led at the Seminary,' she repeated, 'then you
shall go.'</p>

<p>Without a thought of what he was telling her, Julien spoke of
the endless intrigues and jealousies which he had encountered at
first, then of his more peaceful life after he was appointed
tutor.</p>

<p>'It was then,' he added, 'that after a long silence, which was
doubtless intended to make me understand what I see only too
clearly now, that you no longer love me, and that I had become as
nothing to you...'</p>

<p>Madame de Rênal gripped his hands. 'It was then that you sent me
a sum of five hundred francs.'</p>

<p>'Never,' said Madame de Rênal.</p>

<p>'It was a letter postmarked <i>Paris</i> and signed Paul Sorel,
to avoid all suspicion.'</p>

<p>A short discussion followed as to the possible source of this
letter. The atmosphere began to change. Unconsciously, Madame de
Rênal and Julien had departed from their solemn tone; they had
returned to that of a tender intimacy. They could not see each
other, so intense was the darkness, but the sound of their voices
told all. Julien slipped his arm round the waist of his mistress;
this movement was highly dangerous. She tried to remove Julien's
arm, whereupon he, with a certain adroitness, distracted her
attention by an interesting point in his narrative.</p>

<p>The arm was then forgotten, and remained in the position that it
had occupied.</p>

<p>After abundant conjectures as to the source of the letter with
the five hundred francs, Julien had resumed his narrative; he
became rather more his own master in speaking of his past life
which, in comparison with what was happening to him at that moment,
interested him so little. His attention was wholly concentrated on
the manner in which his visit was to end. 'You must leave me,' she
kept on telling him, in a curt tone.</p>

<p>'What a disgrace for me if I am shown the door! The remorse will
be enough to poison my whole life,' he said to himself, 'she will
never write to me. God knows when I shall return to this place!'
From that moment, all the element of heavenly bliss in Julien's
situation vanished rapidly from his heart. Seated by the side of a
woman whom he adored, clasping her almost in his arms, in this room
in which he had been so happy, plunged in a black darkness,
perfectly well aware that for the last minute she had been crying,
feeling, from the movement of her bosom, that she was convulsed
with sobs, he unfortunately became a frigid politician, almost as
calculating and as frigid as when, in the courtyard of the
Seminary, he saw himself made the butt of some malicious joke by
one of his companions stronger than himself. Julien spun out his
story, and spoke of the wretched life he had led since leaving
Verrières. 'And so,' Madame de Rênal said to herself, 'after a
year's absence, almost without a single token of remembrance, while
I was forgetting him, his mind was entirely taken up with the happy
days he had enjoyed at Vergy.' Her sobs increased in violence.
Julien saw that his story had been successful. He realised that he
must now try his last weapon: he came abruptly to the letter that
he had just received from Paris.</p>

<p>'I have taken leave of Monseigneur, the Bishop.'</p>

<p>'What! You are not returning to Besançon! You are leaving us for
ever?'</p>

<p>'Yes,' replied Julien, in a resolute tone; 'yes, I am abandoning
the place where I am forgotten even by her whom I have most dearly
loved in all my life, and I am leaving it never to set eyes on it
again. I am going to Paris...'</p>

<p>'You are going to Paris!' Madame de Rênal exclaimed quite
aloud.</p>

<p>Her voice was almost stifled by her tears, and showed the
intensity of her grief. Julien had need of this encouragement; he
was going to attempt a course which might decide everything against
him; and before this exclamation, seeing no light, he was
absolutely ignorant of the effect that he was producing. He
hesitated no longer; the fear of remorse gave him complete command
of himself; he added coldly as he rose to his feet:</p>

<p>'Yes, Madame, I leave you for ever, may you be happy;
farewell.'</p>

<p>He took a few steps towards the window; he was already opening
it. Madame de Rênal sprang after him and flung herself into his
arms.</p>

<p>Thus, after three hours of conversation, Julien obtained what he
had so passionately desired during the first two. Had they come a
little earlier, this return to tender sentiments, the eclipse of
remorse in Madame de Rênal would have been a divine happiness;
obtained thus by artifice, they were no more than mere pleasure.
Julien positively insisted, against the entreaties of his mistress,
upon lighting the nightlight.</p>

<p>'Do you then wish me,' he asked her, 'to retain no memory of
having seen you? The love that is doubtless glowing in those
charming eyes, shall it then be lost to me? Shall the whiteness of
that lovely hand be invisible to me? Think that I am leaving you
for a very long time perhaps!'</p>

<p>Madame de Rênal could refuse nothing in the face of this idea
which made her dissolve in tears. Dawn was beginning to paint in
clear hues the outline of the fir trees on the mountain to the
least of Verrières. Instead of going away, Julien, intoxicated with
pleasure, asked Madame de Rênal to let him spend the whole day
hidden in her room, and not to leave until the following night.</p>

<p>'And why not?' was her answer. 'This fatal relapse destroys all
my self-esteem, and dooms me to lifelong misery,' and she pressed
him to her heart. 'My husband is no longer the same, he has
suspicions; he believes that I have been fooling him throughout
this affair, and is in the worst of tempers with me. If he hears
the least sound I am lost, he will drive me from the house like the
wretch that I am.'</p>

<p>'Ah! There I can hear the voice of M. Chélan,' said Julien; you
would not have spoken to me like that before my cruel departure for
the Seminary; you loved me then!'</p>

<p>Julien was rewarded for the coolness with which he had uttered
this speech; he saw his mistress at once forget the danger in which
the proximity of her husband involved her, to think of the far
greater danger of seeing Julien doubtful of her love for him. The
daylight was rapidly increasing and now flooded the room; Julien
recovered all the exquisite sensations of pride when he was once
more able to see in his arms and almost at his feet this charming
woman, the only woman that he had ever loved, who, a few hours
earlier, had been entirely wrapped up in the fear of a terrible God
and in devotion to duty. Resolutions fortified by a year of
constancy had not been able to hold out against his boldness.</p>

<p>Presently they heard a sound in the house; a consideration to
which she had not given a thought now disturbed Madame de
Rênal.</p>

<p>'That wicked Elisa will be coming into the room, what are we to
do with that enormous ladder?' she said to her lover; 'where are we
to hide it? I am going to take it up to the loft,' she suddenly
exclaimed, with a sort of playfulness.</p>

<p>'But you will have to go through the servant's room,' said
Julien with astonishment.</p>

<p>'I shall leave the ladder in the corridor, call the man and send
him on an errand.'</p>

<p>'Remember to have some excuse ready in case the man notices the
ladder when he passes it in the passage.'</p>

<p>'Yes, my angel,' said Madame de Rênal as she gave him a kiss.
'And you, remember to hide yourself quickly under the bed if Elisa
comes into the room while I am away.'</p>

<p>Julien was amazed at this sudden gaiety. 'And so,' he thought,
'the approach of physical danger, so far from disturbing her,
restores her gaiety because she forgets her remorse! Indeed a
superior woman! Ah! There is a heart in which it is glorious to
reign!' Julien was in ecstasies.</p>

<p>Madame de Rênal took the ladder; plainly it was too heavy for
her. Julien went to her assistance; he was admiring that elegant
figure, which suggested anything rather than strength, when
suddenly, without help, she grasped the ladder and picked it up as
she might have picked up a chair. She carried it swiftly to the
corridor on the third storey, where she laid it down by the wall.
She called the manservant, and, to give him time to put on his
clothes, went up to the dovecote. Five minutes later, when she
returned to the corridor, the ladder was no more to be seen. What
had become of it? Had Julien been out of the house, the danger
would have been nothing. But, at that moment, if her husband saw
the ladder! The consequences might be appalling. Madame de Rênal
ran up and down the house. At last she discovered the ladder under
the roof, where the man had taken it and in fact hidden it himself.
This in itself was strange, and at another time would have alarmed
her.</p>

<p>'What does it matter to me,' she thought, 'what may happen in
twenty-four hours from now, when Julien will have gone? Will not
everything then be to me horror and remorse?'</p>

<p>She had a sort of vague idea that she ought to take her life,
but what did that matter? After a parting which she had supposed to
be for ever, he was restored to her, she saw him again, and what he
had done in making his way to her gave proof of such a wealth of
love!</p>

<p>In telling Julien of the incident of the ladder:</p>

<p>'What shall I say to my husband,' she asked him, 'if the man
tells him how he found the ladder?' She meditated for a moment. 'It
will take them twenty-four hours to discover the peasant who sold
it to you'; and flinging herself into Julien's arms and clasping
him in a convulsive embrace: 'Ah! to die, to die like this!' she
cried as she covered him with kisses; 'but I must not let you die
of hunger,' she added with a laugh.</p>

<p>'Come; first of all, I am going to hide you in Madame Derville's
room, which is always kept locked.' She kept watch at the end of
the corridor and Julien slipped from door to door. 'Remember not to
answer, if anyone knocks,' she reminded him as she turned the key
outside; 'anyhow, it would only be the children playing.'</p>

<p>'Make them go into the garden, below the window,' said Julien,
'so that I may have the pleasure of seeing them, make them
speak.'</p>

<p>'Yes, yes,' cried Madame de Rênal as she left him.</p>

<p>She returned presently with oranges, biscuits, a bottle of
Malaga; she had found it impossible to purloin any bread.</p>

<p>'What is your husband doing?' said Julien.</p>

<p>'He is writing down notes of the deals he proposes to do with
some peasants.'</p>

<p>But eight o'clock had struck, the house was full of noise. If
Madame de Rênal were not to be seen, people would begin searching
everywhere for her; she was obliged to leave him. Presently she
returned, in defiance of all the rules of prudence, to bring him a
cup of coffee; she was afraid of his dying of hunger. After
luncheon she managed to shepherd the children underneath the window
of Madame Derville's room. He found that they had grown
considerably, but they had acquired a common air, or else his ideas
had changed. Madame de Rênal spoke to them of Julien. The eldest
replied with affection and regret for his former tutor, but it
appeared that the two younger had almost forgotten him.</p>

<p>M. de Rênal did not leave the house that morning; he was
incessantly going up and downstairs, engaged in striking bargains
with certain peasants, to whom he was selling his potato crop.
Until dinner time, Madame de Rênal had not a moment to spare for
her prisoner. When dinner was on the table, it occurred to her to
steal a plateful of hot soup for him. As she silently approached
the door of the room in which he was, carrying the plate carefully,
she found herself face to face with the servant who had hidden the
ladder that morning. At that moment, he too was coming silently
along the corridor, as though listening. Probably Julien had
forgotten to tread softly. The servant made off in some confusion.
Madame de Rênal went boldly into Julien's room; her account of the
incident made him shudder.</p>

<p>'You are afraid'; she said to him; 'and I, I would brave all the
dangers in the world without a tremor. I fear one thing only, that
is the moment when I shall be left alone after you have gone,' and
she ran from the room.</p>

<p>'Ah!' thought Julien, greatly excited, 'remorse is the only
danger that sublime soul dreads!'</p>

<p>Night came at last. M. de Rênal went to the Casino.</p>

<p>His wife had announced a severe headache, she retired to her
room, made haste to dismiss Elisa, and speedily rose from her bed
to open the door to Julien.</p>

<p>It so happened that he really was faint with hunger. Madame de
Rênal went to the pantry to look for bread. Julien heard a loud
cry. She returned and told him that on entering the dark pantry,
making her way to a cupboard in which the bread was kept, and
stretching out her hand, she had touched a woman's arm. It was
Elisa who had uttered the cry which Julien had heard.</p>

<p>'What was she doing there?'</p>

<p>'She was stealing a few sweetmeats, or possibly spying on us,'
said Madame de Rênal with complete indifference. 'But fortunately I
have found a pate and a big loaf.'</p>

<p>'And what have you got there?' said Julien, pointing to the
pockets of her apron.</p>

<p>Madame de Rênal had forgotten that, ever since dinner, they had
been filled with bread.</p>

<p>Julien clasped her in his arms with the keenest passion; never
had she seemed to him so beautiful. 'Even in Paris,' he told
himself vaguely, 'I shall not be able to find a nobler character.'
She had all the awkwardness of a woman little accustomed to
attentions of this sort, and at the same time the true courage of a
person who fears only dangers of another kind and far more
terrible.</p>

<p>While Julien was devouring his supper with a keen appetite, and
his mistress was playfully apologising for the simplicity of the
repast, for she had a horror of serious speech, the door of the
room was all at once shaken violently. It was M. de Rênal.</p>

<p>'Why have you locked yourself in?' he shouted to her.</p>

<p>Julien had just time to slip beneath the sofa.</p>

<p>'What! You are fully dressed,' said M. de Rênal, as he entered;
'you are having supper, and you have locked your door?'</p>

<p>On any ordinary day, this question, put with all the brutality
of a husband, would have troubled Madame de Rênal, but she felt
that her husband had only to lower his eyes a little to catch sight
of Julien; for M. de Rênal had flung himself upon the chair on
which Julien had been sitting a moment earlier, facing the
sofa.</p>

<p>Her headache served as an excuse for everything. While in his
turn her husband was giving her a long and detailed account of the
pool he had won in the billiard room of the Casino, 'a pool of
nineteen francs, begad!' he added, she saw lying on a chair before
their eyes, and within a few feet of them, Julien's hat. Cooler
than ever, she began to undress, and, choosing her moment, passed
swiftly behind her husband and flung a garment over the chair with
the hat on it.</p>

<p>At length M. de Rênal left her. She begged Julien to begin over
again the story of his life in the Seminary: 'Yesterday I was not
listening to you, I was thinking, while you were speaking, only of
how I was to bring myself to send you away.'</p>

<p>She was the embodiment of imprudence. They spoke very loud; and
it might have been two o'clock in the morning when they were
interrupted by a violent blow on the door. It was M. de Rênal
again:</p>

<p>'Let me in at once, there are burglars in the house!' he said,
'Saint-Jean found their ladder this morning.'</p>

<p>'This is the end of everything,' cried Madame de Rênal, throwing
herself into Julien's arms. 'He is going to kill us both, he does
not believe in the burglars; I am going to die in your arms, more
fortunate in my death than I have been in my life.' She made no
answer to her husband, who was waiting angrily outside, she was
holding Julien in a passionate embrace.</p>

<p>'Save Stanislas's mother,' he said to her with an air of
command. 'I am going to jump down into the courtyard from the
window of the closet, and escape through the garden, the dogs know
me. Make a bundle of my clothes and throw it down into the garden
as soon as you can. Meanwhile, let him break the door in. And
whatever you do, no confession, I forbid it, suspicion is better
than certainty.'</p>

<p>'You will kill yourself, jumping down,' was her sole reply and
her sole anxiety.</p>

<p>She went with him to the window of the closet; she then took
such time as she required to conceal his garments. Finally she
opened the door to her husband, who was boiling with rage. He
searched the bedroom, the closet, without uttering a word, and then
vanished. Julien's clothes were thrown down to him, he caught them
and ran quickly down the garden towards the Doubs.</p>

<p>As he ran, he heard a bullet whistle past him, and
simultaneously the sound of a gun being fired.</p>

<p>'That is not M. de Rênal,' he decided, 'he is not a good enough
shot.' The dogs were running by his side in silence, a second shot
apparently shattered the paw of one dog, for it began to emit
lamentable howls. Julien jumped the wall of a terrace, proceeded
fifty yards under cover, then continued his flight in a different
direction. He heard voices calling, and could distinctly see the
servant, his enemy, fire a gun; a farmer also came and shot at him
from the other side of the garden, but by this time Julien had
reached the bank of the Doubs, where he put on his clothes.</p>

<p>An hour later, he was a league from Verrières, on the road to
Geneva. 'If there is any suspicion,' thought Julien, 'it is on the
Paris road that they will look for me.'</p>

<p style="margin-left:10%">O rus, quando ego te aspiciam!<br>
VIRGIL [HORACE in earlier edition]</p>

<p>'The gentleman is waiting, surely, for the mail-coach for
Paris?' he was asked by the landlord of an inn at which he stopped
to break his fast.</p>

<p>'Today or tomorrow, it is all the same to me,' said Julien.</p>

<p>The coach arrived while he was feigning indifference. There were
two places vacant.</p>

<p>'What! It is you, my poor Falcoz,' said the traveller, who had
come from the direction of Geneva to him who now entered the coach
with Julien.</p>

<p>'I thought you had settled in the neighbourhood of Lyons,' said
Falcoz, 'in a charming valley by the Rhone.'</p>

<p>'Settled, indeed! I am running away.'</p>

<p>'What! Running away? You, Saint-Giraud! With that honest face of
yours, have you committed a crime?' said Falcoz, with a laugh.</p>

<p>'Upon my soul, not far off it. I am running away from the
abominable life one leads in the country. I love the shade of the
woods and the quiet of the fields, as you know; you have often
accused me of being romantic. The one thing I never wished to hear
mentioned was politics, and politics pursue me everywhere.'</p>

<p>'But to what party do you belong?'</p>

<p>'To none, and that is what has been fatal to me. These are all
my politics: I enjoy music, and painting; a good book is an event
in my life; I shall soon be four and forty. How many years have I
to live? Fifteen, twenty, thirty, perhaps, at the most. Very well;
I hold that in thirty years from now, our Ministers will be a
little more able, but otherwise just as good fellows as we have
today. The history of England serves as a mirror to show me our
future. There will always be a King who seeks to extend his
prerogative; the ambition to enter Parliament, the glory and the
hundreds of thousands of francs amassed by Mirabeau will always
keep our wealthy provincials awake at night: they will call that
being Liberal and loving the people. The desire to become a Peer or
a Gentleman in Waiting will always possess the Ultras. On board the
Ship of State, everyone will wish to be at the helm, for the post
is well paid. Will there never be a little corner anywhere for the
mere passenger?'</p>

<p>'Why, of course, and a very pleasant one, too, for a man of your
peaceful nature. Is it the last election that is driving you from
your district?'</p>

<p>'My trouble dates from farther back. I was, four years ago,
forty years old, and had five hundred thousand francs, I am four
years older now, and have probably fifty thousand less, which I
shall lose by the sale of my place, Monfleury, by the Rhone, a
superb position.</p>

<p>'In Paris, I was tired of that perpetual play-acting, to which
one is driven by what you call nineteenth-century civilisation. I
felt a longing for human fellowship and simplicity. I bought a
piece of land in the mountains by the Rhone, the most beautiful
spot in the world.</p>

<p>'The vicar of the village and the neighbouring squires made much
of me for the first six months; I had them to dine; I had left
Paris, I told them, so as never to mention or to hear of politics
again. You see, I subscribe to no newspaper. The fewer letters the
postman brings me, the happier I am.</p>

<p>'This was not what the vicar wanted; presently I was besieged
with endless indiscreet requests, intrigues, and so forth. I wished
to give two or three hundred francs every year to the poor, they
pestered me for them on behalf of pious associations; Saint Joseph,
Our Lady, and so forth. I refused: then I came in for endless
insults. I was foolish enough to show annoyance. I could no longer
leave the house in the morning to go and enjoy the beauty of our
mountain scenery, without meeting some bore who would interrupt my
thoughts with an unpleasant reminder of my fellow men and their
evil ways. In the Rogationtide processions, for instance, the
chanting in which I like (it is probably a Greek melody), they no
longer bless my fields, because, the vicar says, they belong to an
unbeliever. A pious old peasant woman's cow dies, she says that it
is because there is a pond close by which belongs to me, the
unbeliever, a philosopher from Paris, and a week later I find all
my fish floating on the water, poisoned with lime. I am surrounded
by trickery in every form. The justice of the peace, an honest man,
but afraid of losing his place, always decides against me. The
peace of the fields is hell to me. As soon as they saw me abandoned
by the vicar, head of the village <i>Congregation</i>, and not
supported by the retired captain, head of the Liberals, they all
fell upon me, even the mason who had been living upon me for a
year, even the wheelwright, who tried to get away with cheating me
when he mended my ploughs.</p>

<p>'In order to have some footing and to win a few at least of my
lawsuits, I turned Liberal; but, as you were saying, those damned
elections came, they asked me for my vote...'</p>

<p>'For a stranger?'</p>

<p>'Not a bit of it, for a man I know only too well. I refused, a
fearful imprudence! From that moment, I had the Liberals on top of
me as well, my position became intolerable. I believe that if it
had ever entered the vicar's head to accuse me of having murdered
my servant, there would have been a score of witnesses from both
parties, ready to swear that they had seen me commit the
crime.'</p>

<p>'You wish to live in the country without ministering to your
neighbours' passions, without even listening to their gossip. What
a mistake!'</p>

<p>'I have made amends for it now. Monfleury is for sale. I shall
lose fifty thousand francs, if I must, but I am overjoyed, I am
leaving that hell of hypocrisy and malice. I am going to seek
solitude and rustic peace in the one place in France where they
exist, in a fourth-floor apartment, overlooking the Champs-Elysees.
And yet I am just thinking whether I shall not begin my political
career, in the Roule quarter, by presenting the blessed bread in
the parish church.'</p>

<p>'None of that would have happened to you under Bonaparte,' said
Falcoz, his eyes shining with anger and regret.</p>

<p>'That's all very well, but why couldn't he keep going, your
Bonaparte? Everything that I suffer from today is his doing.'</p>

<p>Here Julien began to listen with increased attention. He had
realised from the first that the Bonapartist Falcoz was the early
playmate of M. de Rênal, repudiated by him in 1816, while the
philosopher Saint-Giraud must be a brother of that chief clerk in
the Prefecture of &mdash;&mdash;, who knew how to have municipal
property knocked down to him on easy terms.</p>

<p>'And all that has been your Bonaparte's doing,' Saint-Giraud
continued: 'An honest man, harmless if ever there was one, forty
years old and with five hundred thousand francs, can't settle down
in the country and find peace there. Bonaparte's priests and nobles
drive him out again.'</p>

<p>'Ah! You must not speak evil of him,' cried Falcoz, 'never has
France stood so high in the esteem of foreign nations as during the
thirteen years of his reign. In those days, everything that was
done had greatness in it.'</p>

<p>'Your Emperor, may the devil fly away with him,' went on the man
of four and forty, 'was great only upon his battlefields, and when
he restored our financial balance in 1801. What was the meaning of
all his conduct after that? With his chamberlains and his pomp and
his receptions at the Tuileries, he simply furnished a new edition
of all the stuff and nonsense of the monarchy. It was a corrected
edition, it might have served for a century or two. The nobles and
priests preferred to return to the old edition, but they have not
the iron hand that they need to bring it before the public.'</p>

<p>'Listen to the old printer talking!'</p>

<p>'Who is it that is turning me off my land?' went on the printer
with heat. 'The priests, whom Napoleon brought back with his
Concordat, instead of treating them as the State treats doctors,
lawyers, astronomers, of regarding them merely as citizens, without
inquiring into the trade by which they earn their living. Would
there be these insolent gentlemen today if your Bonaparte had not
created barons and counts? No, the fashion had passed. Next to the
priests, it is the minor country nobles that have annoyed me most,
and forced me to turn Liberal.'</p>

<p>The discussion was endless, this theme will occupy the minds and
tongues of France for the next half-century. As Saint-Giraud kept
on repeating that it was impossible to live in the provinces,
Julien timidly cited the example of M. de Rênal.</p>

<p>'Egad, young man, you're a good one!' cried Falcoz, 'he has
turned himself into a hammer so as not to be made the anvil, and a
terrible hammer at that. But I can see him cut out by Valenod. Do
you know that rascal? He's the real article. What will your M. de
Rênal say when he finds himself turned out of office one of these
fine days, and Valenod filling his place?'</p>

<p>'He will be left to meditate on his crimes,' said Saint-Giraud.
'So you know Verrières, young man, do you? Very good! Bonaparte,
whom heaven confound, made possible the reign of the Rênals and
Chélans, which has paved the way for the reign of the Valenods and
Maslons.'</p>

<p>This talk of shady politics astonished Julien, and took his
thoughts from his dreams of sensual bliss.</p>

<p>He was little impressed by the first view of Paris seen in the
distance. His fantastic imaginings of the future in store for him
had to do battle with the still vivid memory of the twenty-four
hours which he had just spent at Verrières. He made a vow that he
would never abandon his mistress's children, but would give up
everything to protect them, should the impertinences of the priests
give us a Republic and lead to persecutions of the nobility.</p>

<p>What would have happened to him on the night of his arrival at
Verrières if, at the moment when he placed his ladder against
Madame de Rênal's bedroom window, he had found that room occupied
by a stranger, or by M. de Rênal?</p>

<p>But also what bliss in those first few hours, when his mistress
really wished to send him away, and he pleaded his cause, seated by
her side in the darkness! A mind like Julien's is pursued by such
memories for a lifetime. The rest of their meeting had already
merged into the first phases of their love, fourteen months
earlier.</p>

<p>Julien was awakened from his profound abstraction by the
stopping of the carriage. They had driven into the courtyard of the
posthouse in the rue Jean-Jacques Rousseau. 'I wish to go to La
Malmaison,' he told the driver of a passing cabriolet. 'At this
time of night, Sir? What to do?' 'What business is it of yours?
Drive on.'</p>

<p>True passion thinks only of itself. That, it seems to me, is why
the passions are so absurd in Paris, where one's neighbour always
insists upon one's thinking largely of him. I shall not describe
Julien's transports at La Malmaison. He wept. What! In spite of the
ugly white walls set up this year, which divide the park in pieces?
Yes, sir; for Julien, as for posterity, there was no distinction
between Arcole, Saint Helena and La Malmaison.</p>

<p>That evening, Julien hesitated for long before entering the
playhouse; he had strange ideas as to that sink of iniquity.</p>

<p>An intense distrust prevented him from admiring the Paris of
today, he was moved only by the monuments bequeathed by his
hero.</p>

<p>'So here I am in the centre of intrigue and hypocrisy! This is
where the abbe de Frilair's protectors reign.'</p>

<p>On the evening of the third day, curiosity prevailed over his
plan of seeing everything before calling upon the abbe Pirard.</p>

<p>The said abbe explained to him, in a frigid tone, the sort of
life that awaited him at M. de La Mole's.</p>

<p>'If after a few months you are of no use to him, you will return
to the Seminary, but by the front door. You are going to lodge with
the Marquis, one of the greatest noblemen in France. You will dress
in black, but like a layman in mourning, not like a churchman. I
require that, thrice weekly, you pursue your theological studies in
a Seminary, where I shall introduce you. Each day, at noon, you
will take your place in the library of the Marquis, who intends to
employ you in writing letters with reference to lawsuits and other
business. The Marquis notes down, in a word or two, upon the margin
of each letter that he receives, the type of answer that it
requires. I have undertaken that, by the end of three months, you
will have learned to compose these answers to such effect that, of
every twelve which you present to the Marquis for his signature, he
will be able to sign eight or nine. In the evening, at eight
o'clock, you will put his papers in order, and at ten you will be
free.</p>

<p>'It may happen,' the abbe Pirard continued, 'that some old lady
or some man of persuasive speech will hint to you the prospect of
immense advantages, or quite plainly offer you money to let him see
the letters received by the Marquis...'</p>

<p>'Oh, Sir!' cried Julien, blushing.</p>

<p>'It is strange,' said the abbe with a bitter smile, 'that, poor
as you are, and after a year of Seminary, you still retain these
virtuous indignations. You must indeed have been blind!</p>

<p>'Can it be his blood coming out?' murmured the abbe, as though
putting the question to himself. 'The strange thing is,' he added,
looking at Julien, 'that the Marquis knows you...How, I cannot say.
He is giving you, to begin with, a salary of one hundred louis. He
is a man who acts only from caprice, that is his weakness; he will
outdo you in puerilities. If he is pleased with you, your salary
may rise in time to eight thousand francs.</p>

<p>'But you must be well aware,' the abbe went on in a harsh tone,
'that he is not giving you all this money for your handsome face.
You will have to be of use to him. If I were in your position, I
should speak as little as possible, and above all, never speak of
matters of which I know nothing.</p>

<p>'Ah!' said the abbe, 'I have been making inquiries on your
behalf; I was forgetting M. de La Mole's family. He has two
children, a daughter, and a son of nineteen, the last word in
elegance, a mad fellow, who never knows at one minute what he will
be doing the next. He has spirit, and courage; he has fought in
Spain. The Marquis hopes, I cannot say why, that you will become
friends with the young Comté Norbert. I have said that you are a
great Latin scholar, perhaps he reckons upon your teaching his son
a few ready-made phrases about Cicero and Virgil.</p>

<p>'In your place, I should never allow this fine young man to make
free with me; and, before yielding to his overtures, which will be
perfectly civil, but slightly marred by irony, I should make him
repeat them at least twice.</p>

<p>'I shall not conceal from you that the young Comté de La Mole is
bound to look down upon you at first, because of your humble birth.
He is the direct descendant of a courtier, who had the honour to
have his head cut off on the Place de Greve, on the 26th of April,
1574, for a political intrigue. As for you, you are the son of a
carpenter at Verrières, and moreover, you are in his father's pay.
Weigh these differences carefully, and study the history of this
family in Moreri, all the flatterers who dine at their table make
from time to time what they call delicate allusions to it.</p>

<p>'Take care how you respond to the pleasantries of M. le Comté
Norbert de La Mole, Squadron Commander of Hussars and a future Peer
of France, and do not come and complain to me afterwards.'</p>

<p>'It seems to me,' said Julien, blushing deeply, 'that I ought
not even to answer a man who looks down upon me.'</p>

<p>'You have no idea of this form of contempt; it will reveal
itself only in exaggerated compliments. If you were a fool, you
might let yourself be taken in by them; if you wished to succeed,
you ought to let yourself be taken in.'</p>

<p>'On the day when all this ceases to agree with me,' said Julien,
'shall I be considered ungrateful if I return to my little cell,
number 103?'</p>

<p>'No doubt,' replied the abbe, 'all the sycophants of the house
will slander you, but then I shall appear. <i>Adsum qui fed</i>. I
shall say that it was from me that the decision came.'</p>

<p>Julien was dismayed by the bitter and almost malicious tone
which he remarked in M. Pirard; this tone completely spoiled his
last utterance.</p>

<p>The fact was that the abbe felt a scruple of conscience about
loving Julien, and it was with a sort of religious terror that he
was thus directly interfering with the destiny of another man.</p>

<p>'You will also see,' he continued, with the same ill grace, and
as though in the performance of a painful duty, 'you will see
Madame la Marquise de La Mole. She is a tall, fair woman, pious,
proud, perfectly civil and even more insignificant. She is a
daughter of the old Due de Chaulnes, so famous for his aristocratic
prejudices. This great lady is a sort of compendium, in high
relief, of all that makes up the character of the women of her
rank. She makes it no secret that to have had ancestors who went to
the Crusades is the sole advantage to which she attaches any
importance. Money comes only a long way after: does that surprise
you? We are no longer in the country, my friend.</p>

<p>'You will find in her drawing-room many great noblemen speaking
of our Princes in a tone of singular disrespect. As for Madame de
La Mole, she lowers her voice in respect whenever she names a
Prince, let alone a Princess. I should not advise you to say in her
hearing that Philip II or Henry VIII was a monster. They were
KINGS, and that gives them an inalienable right to the respect of
everyone, and above all to the respect of creatures without birth,
like you and me. However,' M. Pirard added, 'we are priests, for
she will take you for one; on that footing, she regards us as
lackeys necessary to her salvation.'</p>

<p>'Sir,' said Julien, 'it seems to me that I shall not remain long
in Paris.'</p>

<p>'As you please; but observe that there is no hope of success,
for a man of our cloth, except through the great nobles. With that
indefinable element (at least, I cannot define it), which there is
in your character, if you do not succeed you will be persecuted;
there is no middle way for you. Do not abuse your position. People
see that you are not pleased when they speak to you; in a social
environment like this, you are doomed to misfortune, if you do not
succeed in winning respect.</p>

<p>'What would have become of you at Besançon, but for this caprice
on the part of the Marquis de La Mole? One day, you will appreciate
all the singularity of what he is doing for you, and, if you are
not a monster, you will feel eternal gratitude to him and his
family. How many poor abbes, cleverer men than you, have lived for
years in Paris, upon the fifteen sous for their mass and the ten
sous for their lectures in the Sorbonne!... Remember what I told
you, last winter, of the early years of that wretch, Cardinal
Dubois. Are you, by any chance, so proud as to imagine that you
have more talent than he?</p>

<p>'I, for example, a peaceable and insignificant man, expected to
end my days in my Seminary; I was childish enough to have grown
attached to it. Very well! I was going to be turned out when I
offered my resignation. Do you know what was the extent of my
fortune? I had five hundred and twenty francs of capital, neither
more nor less; not a friend, at most two or three acquaintances. M.
de La Mole, whom I had never seen, saved me from disaster; he had
only to say the word, and I was given a living in which all my
parishioners are people in easy circumstances, above the common
vices, and the stipend fills me with shame, so far out of
proportion is it to my work. I have spoken to you at this length
only to put a little ballast into that head of yours.</p>

<p>'One word more; it is my misfortune to have a hasty temper; it
is possible that you and I may cease to speak to one another.</p>

<p>'If the arrogance of the Marquise, or the mischievous pranks of
her son, make the house definitely insupportable to you, I advise
you to finish your studies in some Seminary thirty leagues from
Paris, and in the North, rather than in the South. You will find in
the North more civilisation and fewer injustices; and,' he added,
lowering his voice, 'I must admit it, the proximity of the Parisian
newspapers makes the petty tyrants afraid.</p>

<p>'If we continue to find pleasure in each other's company, and
the Marquis's household does not agree with you, I offer you a
place as my vicar, and shall divide the revenues of this living
with you equally. I owe you this and more,' he added, cutting short
Julien's expressions of gratitude, 'for the singular offer which
you made me at Besançon. If, instead of five hundred and twenty
francs, I had had nothing, you would have saved me.'</p>

<p>The cruel tone had gone from the abbe's voice. To his great
confusion, Julien felt the tears start to his eyes; he was longing
to fling himself into the arms of his friend: he could not resist
saying to him, with the most manly air that he was capable of
affecting:</p>

<p>'I have been hated by my father from the cradle; it was one of
my great misfortunes; but I shall no longer complain of fortune. I
have found another father in you, Sir.'</p>

<p>'Good, good,' said the abbe, with embarrassment; then
remembering most opportunely a phrase from the vocabulary of a
Director of a Seminary: 'You must never say fortune, my child,
always say Providence.'</p>

<p>The cab stopped; the drier lifted the bronze knocker on an
immense door: it was the HOTEL DE LA MOLE; and, so that the
passer-by might be left in no doubt of this, the words were to be
read on a slab of black marble over the door.</p>

<p>This affectation was not to Julien's liking. 'They are so afraid
of the Jacobins! They see a Robespierre and his tumbril behind
every hedge; often they make one die with laughing, and they
advertise their house like this so that the mob shall know it in
the event of a rising, and sack it.' He communicated what was in
his mind to the Abbe Pirard.</p>

<p>'Ah! Poor boy, you will soon be my vicar. What an appalling idea
to come into your head!'</p>

<p>'I can think of nothing more simple,' said Julien.</p>

<p>The gravity of the porter and above all the cleanness of the
courtyard had filled him with admiration. The sun was shining
brightly.</p>

<p>'What magnificent architecture!' he said to his friend.</p>

<p>It was one of the typical town houses, with their lifeless
fronts, of the Faubourg Saint-Germain, built about the date of
Voltaire's death. Never have the fashionable and the beautiful been
such worlds apart.</p>

<h2><a name="ch32" id="ch32"></a>Chapter 32. First Appearance in
Society</h2>

<p style="margin-left:10%">Absurd and touching memory: one's first
appearance, at<br>
eighteen, alone and unsupported, in a drawing-room! A<br>
glance from a woman was enough to terrify me. The more<br>
I tried to shine, the more awkward I became. I formed<br>
the most false ideas of everything; either I surrendered<br>
myself for no reason, or I saw an enemy in a man because<br>
he had looked at me with a serious expression. But then,<br>
amid all the fearful sufferings of my shyness, how fine<br>
was a fine day!<br>
&mdash;KANT</p>

<p>Julien stopped in confusion in the middle of the courtyard.</p>

<p>'Do assume a reasonable air,' said the Abbe Picard; 'you take
hold of horrible ideas, and you are only a boy! Where is the <i>nil
mirari</i> of Horace?' (That is: no enthusiasm.) 'Reflect that this
tribe of flunkeys, seeing you established here, will try to make a
fool of you; they will regard you as an equal, unjustly set over
them. Beneath a show of good nature, of good advice, of a wish to
guide you, they will try to catch you out in some stupid
blunder.'</p>

<p>'I defy them to do so,' said Julien, biting his lip; and he
recovered all his former distrust.</p>

<p>The drawing-rooms through which our friends passed on the first
floor, before coming to the Marquis's study, would have seemed to
you, gentle reader, as depressing as they were magnificent. Had you
been made a present of them as they stood, you would have refused
to live in them; they are the native heath of boredom and dreary
argument. They redoubled Julien's enchantment. 'How can anyone be
unhappy,' he thought, 'who lives in so splendid a residence?'</p>

<p>Finally, our friends came to the ugliest of the rooms in this
superb suite: the daylight barely entered it; here, they found a
wizened little man with a keen eye and a fair periwig. The abbe
turned to Julien, whom he presented. It was the Marquis. Julien had
great difficulty in recognising him, so civil did he find him. This
was no longer the great nobleman, so haughty in his mien, of the
Abbey of Bray-le-Haut. It seemed to Julien that there was far too
much hair in his wig. Thanks to this impression, he was not in the
least intimidated. The descendant of Henri III's friend struck him
at first as cutting but a poor figure. He was very thin and greatly
agitated. But he soon remarked that the Marquis showed a courtesy
even more agreeable to the person he was addressing than that of
the Bishop of Besançon himself. The audience did not occupy three
minutes. As they left the room, the abbe said to Julien:</p>

<p>'You looked at the Marquis as you would have looked at a
picture. I am no expert in what these people call politeness, soon
you will know more about it than I; still, the boldness of your
stare seemed to me to be scarcely polite.'</p>

<p>They had returned to their vehicle; the driver stopped by the
boulevard; the abbe led Julien through a series of spacious rooms.
Julien remarked that they were unfurnished. He was looking at a
magnificent gilt clock, representing a subject that in his opinion
was highly indecent, when a most elegant gentleman approached them
with an affable expression. Julien made him a slight bow.</p>

<p>The gentleman smiled and laid a hand on his shoulder. Julien
quivered and sprang back. He was flushed with anger. The abbe
Pirard, for all his gravity, laughed till the tears ran down his
cheeks. The gentleman was a tailor.</p>

<p>'I leave you at liberty for two days,' the abbe told him as they
emerged; 'it is not until then that you can be presented to Madame
de La Mole. Most people would protect you like a young girl, in
these first moments of your sojourn in this modern Babylon. Ruin
yourself at once, if you are to be ruined, and I shall be rid of
the weakness I show in caring for you. The day after tomorrow, in
the morning, this tailor will bring you two coats; you will give
five francs to the boy who tries them on you. Otherwise, do not let
these Parisians hear the sound of your voice. If you utter a word,
they will find a way of making you look foolish. That is their
talent. The day after tomorrow, be at my house at midday...Run
along, ruin yourself...I was forgetting, go and order boots,
shirts, a hat at these addresses.'</p>

<p>Julien studied the handwriting of the addresses.</p>

<p>'That is the Marquis's hand,' said the abbe, 'he is an active
man who provides for everything, and would rather do a thing
himself than order it to be done. He is taking you into his
household so that you may save him trouble of this sort. Will you
have sufficient intelligence to carry out all the orders that this
quick-witted man will suggest to you in a few words? The future
will show: have a care!'</p>

<p>Julien, without uttering a word, made his way into the shops
indicated on the list of addresses; he observed that he was greeted
there with respect, and the bootmaker, in entering his name in his
books, wrote 'M. Julien de Sorel'.</p>

<p>In the Cemetery of Père-Lachaise a gentleman who seemed highly
obliging, and even more Liberal in his speech, offered to guide
Julien to the tomb of Marshal Ney, from which a wise administration
has withheld the honour of an epitaph. But, after parting from this
Liberal, who, with tears in his eyes, almost clasped him to his
bosom, Julien no longer had a watch. It was enriched by this
experience that, two days later, at noon, he presented himself
before the abbe Pirard, who studied him attentively.</p>

<p>'You are perhaps going to become a fop,' the abbe said to him,
with a severe expression. Julien had the appearance of an extremely
young man, in deep mourning; he did, as a matter of fact, look
quite well, but the good abbe was himself too provincial to notice
that Julien still had that swing of the shoulders which in the
provinces betokens at once elegance and importance. On seeing
Julien, the Marquis considered his graces in a light so different
from that of the good abbe that he said to him:</p>

<p>'Should you have any objection to M. Sorel's taking
dancing-lessons?'</p>

<p>The abbe was rooted to the spot.</p>

<p>'No,' he replied, at length, 'Julien is not a priest.'</p>

<p>The Marquis, mounting two steps at a time by a little secret
stair, conducted our hero personally to a neat attic which
overlooked the huge garden of the house. He asked him how many
shirts he had ordered from the hosier.</p>

<p>'Two,' replied Julien, dismayed at seeing so great a gentleman
descend to these details.</p>

<p>'Very good,' said the Marquis, with a serious air, and an
imperative, curt note in his voice, which set Julien thinking:
'very good! Order yourself two and twenty more. Here is your first
quarter's salary.'</p>

<p>As they came down from the attic, the Marquis summoned an
elderly man: 'Arsene,' he said to him, 'you will look after M.
Sorel.' A few minutes later, Julien found himself alone in a
magnificent library: it was an exquisite moment. So as not to be
taken by surprise in his emotion, he went and hid himself in a
little dark corner; from which he gazed with rapture at the
glittering backs of the books. 'I can read all of those,' he told
himself. 'And how should I fail to be happy here? M. de Rênal would
have thought himself disgraced for ever by doing the hundredth part
of what the Marquis de La Mole has just done for me.</p>

<p>'But first of all, we must copy the letters.' This task ended,
Julien ventured towards the shelves; he almost went mad with joy on
finding an edition of Voltaire. He ran and opened the door of the
library so as not to be caught. He then gave himself the pleasure
of opening each of the eighty volumes in turn. They were
magnificently bound, a triumph of the best craftsman in London.
This was more than was needed to carry Julien's admiration beyond
all bounds.</p>

<p>An hour later, the Marquis entered the room, examined the
copies, and was surprised to see that Julien wrote cela with a
double <i>l</i>, <i>cella</i> 'So all that the abbe has been
telling me of his learning is simply a tale!' The Marquis, greatly
discouraged, said to him gently:</p>

<p>'You are not certain of your spelling?'</p>

<p>'That is true,' said Julien, without the least thought of the
harm he was doing himself; he was moved by the Marquis's kindness,
which made him think of M. de Rênal's savage tone.</p>

<p>'It is all a waste of time, this experiment with a little
Franc-comtois priest,' thought the Marquis; 'but I did so want a
trustworthy man.</p>

<p>'<i>Cela</i> has only one <i>l</i>,' the Marquis told him; 'when
you have finished your copies, take the dictionary and look out all
the words of which you are not certain.'</p>

<p>At six o'clock the Marquis sent for him; he looked with evident
dismay at Julien's boots: 'I am to blame. I forgot to tell you that
every evening at half-past five you must dress.'</p>

<p>Julien looked at him without understanding him.</p>

<p>'I mean put on stockings. Arsene will remind you; today I shall
make your apologies.'</p>

<p>So saying, M. de La Mole ushered Julien into a drawing-room
resplendent with gilding. On similar occasions, M. de Rênal never
failed to increase his pace so that he might have the satisfaction
of going first through the door.</p>

<p>The effect of his old employer's petty vanity was that Julien
now trod upon the Marquis's heels, and caused him considerable
pain, owing to his gout. 'Ah! He is even more of a fool than I
thought,' the Marquis said to himself. He presented him to a woman
of tall stature and imposing aspect. It was the Marquise. Julien
decided that she had an impertinent air, which reminded him a
little of Madame de Maugiron, the Sub-Prefect's wife of the
Verrières district, when she attended the Saint Charles's day
dinner. Being somewhat embarrassed by the extreme splendour of the
room, Julien did not hear what M. de La Mole was saying. The
Marquise barely deigned to glance at him. There were several men in
the room, among whom Julien recognised with unspeakable delight the
young Bishop of Agde, who had condescended to say a few words to
him once at the ceremony at Bray-le-Haut. The young prelate was
doubtless alarmed by the tender gaze which Julien, in his timidity,
fastened upon him, and made no effort to recognise this
provincial.</p>

<p>The men assembled in this drawing-room seemed to Julien to be
somehow melancholy and constrained; people speak low in Paris, and
do not exaggerate trifling matters.</p>

<p>A handsome young man, wearing moustaches, very pale and slender,
entered the room at about half-past six; he had an extremely small
head.</p>

<p>'You always keep us waiting,' said the Marquise, as he kissed
her hand.</p>

<p>Julien gathered that this was the Comté de La Mole. He found him
charming from the first.</p>

<p>'Is it possible,' he said to himself, 'that this is the man
whose offensive pleasantries are going to drive me from this
house?'</p>

<p>By dint of a survey of Comté Norbert's person, Julien discovered
that he was wearing boots and spurs; 'and I ought to be wearing
shoes, evidently as his inferior.' They sat down to table. Julien
heard the Marquise utter a word of rebuke, slightly raising her
voice. Almost at the same moment he noticed a young person
extremely fair and very comely, who was taking her place opposite
to him. She did not attract him at all; on studying her
attentively, however, he thought that he had never seen such fine
eyes; but they hinted at great coldness of heart. Later, Julien
decided that they expressed a boredom which studies other people
but keeps on reminding itself that it is one's duty to be imposing.
'Madame de Rênal, too, had the most beautiful eyes,' he said to
himself; 'people used to compliment her on them; but they had
nothing in common with these.' Julien had not enough experience to
discern that it was the fire of wit that shone from time to time in
the eyes of Mademoiselle Mathilde, for so he heard her named. When
Madame de Rênal's eyes became animated, it was with the fire of her
passions, or was due to a righteous indignation upon hearing of
some wicked action. Towards the end of dinner, Julien found the
right word to describe the type of beauty exemplified by the eyes
of Mademoiselle de La Mole: 'They are scintillating,' he said to
himself. Otherwise, she bore a painful resemblance to her mother,
whom he disliked more and more, and he ceased to look at her. Comté
Norbert, on the other hand, struck him as admirable in every
respect. Julien was so captivated, that it never entered his head
to be jealous of him and to hate him, because he was richer and
nobler than himself.</p>

<p>Julien thought that the Marquis appeared bored.</p>

<p>During the second course, he said to his son:</p>

<p>'Norbert, I must ask you to look after M. Julien Sorel, whom I
have just taken upon my staff, and intend to make a man of, if that
(<i>cela</i>) can be done.</p>

<p>'He is my secretary,' the Marquis added to his neighbour, 'and
he spells <i>cela</i> with a double <i>l</i>.'</p>

<p>Everyone looked at Julien, who gave Norbert a slightly
exaggerated bow; but on the whole, they were satisfied with his
appearance.</p>

<p>The Marquis must have spoken of the kind of education that
Julien had received, for one of the guests tackled him upon Horace:
'It was precisely in discussing Horace that I was successful with
the Bishop of Besançon,' Julien said to himself, 'evidently he is
the only author they know.' From that moment he was master of
himself. This change was made easy by his having just decided that
Mademoiselle de La Mole would never be a woman in his eyes. Since
his Seminary days he defied men to do their worst, and refused to
be intimidated by them. He would have enjoyed perfect
self-possession, had the dining-room been furnished with less
magnificence. It was, as a matter of fact, a pair of mirrors, each
of them eight feet high, in which he caught sight now and then of
his challenger as he spoke of Horace, that still continued to
overawe him. His sentences were not unduly long for a provincial.
He had fine eyes, the sparkle in which was enhanced by his
tremulous, or, when he had made a good answer, his happy shyness.
This sort of examination made a serious dinner-party quite
interesting. The Marquis made a sign to the other speaker to press
Julien hard. 'Can it be possible that he does know something?' he
thought.</p>

<p>Julien found fresh ideas as he answered, and lost enough of his
shyness not, indeed, to display wit, a thing impossible to a person
ignorant of the language that is spoken in Paris, but he had
original ideas, albeit expressed without gracefulness or
appropriateness, and it could be seen that he had a thorough
knowledge of Latin.</p>

<p>His adversary was a member of the Academy of Inscriptions, who
happened to know Latin; he found in Julien an excellent humanist,
lost all fear of making him blush, and really did seek to embarrass
him. In the heat of the duel, Julien at length forgot the
magnificent decoration of the dining-room, and began to express
ideas with regard to the Latin poets, which the other had never
read in any book. Being an honest man, he gave the credit for them
to the young secretary. Fortunately, the discussion turned to the
question whether Horace had been poor or rich: an amiable person,
sensual and easy-going, making poetry for his own amusement, like
Chapelle, the friend of Moliere and La Fontaine; or a poor devil of
a Poet Laureate attached to the court and composing odes for the
King's Birthday, like Southey, the traducer of Lord Byron. They
spoke of the state of society under Augustus and under George IV;
in both epochs the aristocracy was all-powerful! but in Rome it saw
its power wrested from it by Maecenas, who was a mere knight; and
in England it had reduced George IV more or less to the position of
a Doge of Venice. This discussion seemed to draw the Marquis out of
the state of torpor in which his boredom had kept him plunged at
the beginning of dinner.</p>

<p>Julien could make nothing of all these modern names, such as
Southey, Lord Byron, George IV, which he now heard for the first
time. But no one could fail to observe that whenever there was any
question of historical events at Rome, a knowledge of which might
be derived from the works of Horace, Martial, Tacitus, etc., he had
an unchallengeable superiority. Julien appropriated without a
scruple a number of ideas which he had acquired from the Bishop of
Besançon, during the famous discussion he had had with that
prelate; these proved to be not the least acceptable.</p>

<p>When the party tired of discussing poets, the Marquise, who made
it a rule to admire anything that amused her husband, condescended
to glance at Julien. 'The awkward manners of this young cleric may
perhaps be concealing a learned man,' the Academician, who was
sitting near her, said to the Marquise; and Julien overheard
something of what he was saying. Ready-made phrases were quite to
the taste of his hostess; she adopted this description of Julien,
and was glad that she had invited the Academician to dine. 'He
amuses M. de La Mole,' she thought.</p>

<h2><a name="ch33" id="ch33"></a>Chapter 33. First Steps</h2>

<p style="margin-left:10%">That immense valley filled with
brilliant lights and with all<br>
those thousands of people dazzles my sight. Not one of them<br>
knows me, all are superior to me. My head reels.<br>
&mdash;<i>Poemi dell' avvocato</i>, REINA</p>

<p>Early in the morning of the following day, Julien was copying
letters in the library, when Mademoiselle Mathilde entered by a
little private door, cleverly concealed with shelves of dummy
books. While Julien was admiring this device, Mademoiselle Mathilde
appeared greatly surprised and distinctly annoyed to see him there.
Julien decided that her curlpapers gave her a hard, haughty, almost
masculine air. Mademoiselle de La Mole had a secret habit of
stealing books from her father's library, undetected. Julien's
presence frustrated her expedition that morning, which annoyed her
all the more as she had come to securé the second volume of
Voltaire's <i>Princesse de Babylone</i>, a fitting complement to an
eminently monarchical and religious education, a triumph on the
part of the Sacre-Coeur! This poor girl, at nineteen, already
required the spice of wit to make her interested in a novel.</p>

<p>Comté Norbert appeared in the library about three o'clock; he
had come to study a newspaper, in order to be able to talk politics
that evening, and was quite pleased to find Julien, whose existence
he had forgotten. He was charming to him, and offered to lend him a
horse.</p>

<p>'My father is letting us off until dinner.'</p>

<p>Julien appreciated this <i>us</i>, and thought it charming.</p>

<p>'Heavens, Monsieur le Comté,' said Julien, 'if it were a
question of felling an eighty-foot tree, trimming it and sawing it
into planks, I venture to say that I should manage it well enough;
but riding a horse is a thing I haven't done six times in my
life.'</p>

<p>'Well, this will be the seventh,' said Norbert.</p>

<p>Privately, Julien remembered the entry of the King of
&mdash;&mdash; into Verrières and imagined himself a superior
horseman. But, on their way back from the Bois de Boulogne, in the
very middle of the Rue du Bac, he fell off, while trying to avoid a
passing cab, and covered himself in mud. It was fortunate for him
that he had a change of clothes. At the dinner the Marquis, wishing
to include him in the conversation, asked him about his ride;
Norbert made haste to reply in generous language.</p>

<p>'Monsieur le Comté is too kind to me,' put in Julien. 'I thank
him for it, and fully appreciate his kindness. He has been so good
as to give me the quietest and handsomest of horses; but after all
he could not glue me on to it, and, that being so, I fell off right
in the middle of that very long street near the bridge.'</p>

<p>Mademoiselle Mathilde tried in vain to stifle a peal of
laughter; finally indiscretion prevailed and she begged for
details. Julien emerged from the difficulty with great simplicity;
he had an unconscious grace.</p>

<p>'I augur well of this little priest,' the Marquis said to the
Academician; 'a simple countryman in such a scrape! Such a thing
was never yet seen and never will be seen; in addition to which he
relates his misadventure before the <i>ladies</i>!'</p>

<p>Julien set his listeners so thoroughly at ease over his mishap
that at the end of dinner, when the general conversation had taken
another turn, Mademoiselle Mathilde began to ply her brother with
questions as to the details of the distressing event. As her
inquiry continued, and as Julien more than once caught her eye, he
ventured to reply directly, although he had not been questioned,
and all three ended in laughter, just like three young peasants
from a village in the heart of a forest.</p>

<p>On the following day Julien attended two lectures on theology,
and then returned to transcribe a score of letters. He found
ensconced by his own place in the library a young man dressed with
great neatness, but his general appearance was ignominious and his
expression one of envy.</p>

<p>The Marquis entered.</p>

<p>'What are you doing here, Monsieur Tanbeau?' he asked the
newcomer in a severe tone.</p>

<p>'I thought,' the young man began with a servile smile.</p>

<p>'No, Sir, you did not think. This is an attempt, but it is an
unfortunate one.'</p>

<p>Young Tanbeau rose in a fury and left the room. He was a nephew
of the Academician, Madame de La Mole's friend, and was intended
for a literary career. The Academician had persuaded the Marquis to
take him as a secretary. Tanbeau, who worked in a room apart,
having heard of the favour that was being bestowed upon Julien, was
anxious to share it, and that morning had come and set up his desk
in the library.</p>

<p>At four o'clock, Julien ventured, after some hesitation, to seek
out Comté Norbert. This young gentleman was going out riding, and
was somewhat embarrassed, for his manners were perfect.</p>

<p>'I think,' he said to Julien, 'that presently you might go to
the riding school; and after a few weeks I shall be delighted to
ride with you.'</p>

<p>'I wished to have the honour of thanking you for all your
kindness to me; pray believe, Sir,' Julien added with a most
serious air, 'that I am fully conscious of all that I owe you. If
your horse is not injured as a result of my clumsiness yesterday,
and if it is free, I should like to ride it today.'</p>

<p>'Faith, my dear Sorel, on your own head be it! Assume that I
have raised all the objections that prudence demands; the fact is
that it is four o'clock, we have no time to lose.'</p>

<p>After he was in the saddle:</p>

<p>'What must one do, not to fall off?' Julien asked the young
Comté.</p>

<p>'All sorts of things,' replied Norbert with a shout of laughter:
'for instance, sit well back.'</p>

<p>Julien began to trot. They were crossing the Place Louis
XVI.</p>

<p>'Ah! Young hothead, there are too many carriages here, and with
careless drivers too. Once you are on the ground, their tilburys
will go bowling over you; they are not going to risk hurting their
horses' mouths by pulling up short.'</p>

<p>A score of times Norbert saw Julien on the point of falling; but
at last their ride ended without mishap. On their return, the young
Comté said to his sister:</p>

<p>'Let me introduce a regular dare-devil.'</p>

<p>At dinner, speaking to his father, down the length of the table,
he did justice to Julien's courage; it was all that one could
praise in his method of riding. During the day the young Comté had
heard the men who were grooming the horses in the yard make
Julien's fall an excuse for the most outrageous mockery of him.</p>

<p>In spite of all this kindness, Julien soon felt himself
completely isolated among this family. All their customs seemed
strange to him, and he was always making mistakes. His blunders
were the delight of the footmen.</p>

<p>The abbe Pirard had gone off to his living. 'If Julien is a
frail reed, let him perish; if he is a man of courage, let him make
his way by himself,' he thought.</p>

<h2><a name="ch34" id="ch34"></a>Chapter 34. The Hotel de La
Mole</h2>

<p style="margin-left:10%">What is he doing here? might it please
him?<br>
might he think to please?<br>
&mdash;RONSARD</p>

<p>If everything seemed strange to Julien, in the noble
drawing-room of the Hotel de La Mole, the young man himself, pale
and dressed in black, seemed in turn highly singular to those who
deigned to notice him. Madame de La Mole suggested that her husband
should send him away on business upon days when certain personages
were coming to dine.</p>

<p>'I should like to carry through the experiment,' replied the
Marquis. 'The abbe Pirard maintains that we do wrong to crush the
self-respect of the people we admit into our households. One can
lean only upon what resists, etc. There is nothing wrong with this
fellow except his uncouth appearance; he might be deaf and
dumb.'</p>

<p>'If I am to keep my bearings, I must,' Julien said to himself,
'write down the names and a few words as to the character of the
people I see appear in this drawing-room.'</p>

<p>At the head of his list he placed five or six friends of the
family who paid a desperate court to him, supposing him to be
protected by some caprice of the Marquis. These were poor devils,
more or less spiritless; but, it must be said in praise of men of
this class as they are to be found today in the drawing-rooms of
the nobility, they were not equally spiritless to all comers. Some
of them would have let themselves be abused by the Marquis, and yet
would have revolted against a harsh word addressed to them by
Madame de La Mole.</p>

<p>There was too much pride, there was too much boredom in the
character of both host and hostess; they were too much in the habit
of insulting people for their own distraction, to be able to expect
any true friends. But, except on wet days, and in their moments of
furious boredom, which were rare, they were never to be found
wanting in politeness.</p>

<p>If the five or six flatterers who treated Julien with such
fatherly affection had deserted the Hotel de La Mole, the Marquise
would have been left to long hours of solitude; and, in the eyes of
women of her rank, solitude is a dreadful thing: it is the badge of
disgrace.</p>

<p>The Marquis behaved admirably to his wife; he saw to it that her
drawing-room was adequately filled; not with peers, he found his
new colleagues scarcely noble enough to come to his house as
friends, nor entertaining enough to be admitted as
subordinates.</p>

<p>It was not until much later that Julien discovered these
secrets. The political questions which form the chief topic in
middle-class houses are never mentioned in houses like that of the
Marquis, save in times of trouble.</p>

<p>So powerful still, even in this age of boredom, are the dictates
of the need of amusement, that even on the evenings of
dinnerparties, as soon as the Marquis had left the drawing-room,
everyone else fled. So long as you did not speak lightly of God, or
of the clergy, or of the King, or of the men in power, or of the
artists patronised by the court, or of anything established; so
long as you did not say anything good of Beranger, or of the
opposition press, or of Voltaire, or of Rousseau, or of anything
that allowed itself the liberty of a little freedom of speech; so
long, above all, as you did not talk politics, you could discuss
anything you pleased with freedom.</p>

<p>There is no income of a hundred thousand crowns, no blue riband
that can prevail against a drawing-room so constituted. The
smallest living idea seemed an outrage. Despite good tone, perfect
manners, the desire to be agreeable, boredom was written upon every
brow. The young men who came to pay their respects, afraid to speak
of anything that might lead to their being suspected of thinking,
afraid to reveal some forbidden reading, became silent after a few
elegantly phrased sentences on Rossini and the weather.</p>

<p>Julien observed that the conversation was usually kept going by
two Viscounts and five Barons whom M. de La Mole had known during
the Emigration. These gentlemen enjoyed incomes of from six to
eight thousand livres; four of them swore by the
<i>Quotidienne</i>, and three by the <i>Gazette de France</i>. One
of them had some new story to tell every day of the Chateau, in
which the word 'admirable' was lavishly used. Julien remarked that
this man wore five Crosses, whereas the others, as a rule, had no
more than three.</p>

<p>On the other hand, you saw in the ante-room ten footmen in
livery, and all through the evening you had ices or tea every
quarter of an hour; and, at midnight, a sort of supper with
champagne.</p>

<p>It was for this reason that Julien sometimes remained to the
end; otherwise, he failed to understand how anyone could listen
seriously to the ordinary conversation of this drawing-room, so
magnificently gilded. Now and again he would watch the speakers, to
see whether they themselves were not laughing at what they were
saying. 'My M. de Maistre, whom I know by heart, has said things a
hundred times better,' he thought; 'and even he is extremely
boring.'</p>

<p>Julien was not the only one to be aware of the mental
stagnation. Some consoled themselves by taking quantities of ices;
the others with the pleasure of being able to say for the rest of
the evening: 'I have just come from the Hotel de La Mole, where I
heard that Russia', etc., etc.</p>

<p>Julien learned, from one of the flatterers, that less than six
months ago Madame de La Mole had rewarded an assiduity that had
lasted for more than twenty years by securing a Prefecture for poor
Baron Le Bourguignon, who had been a Sub-Prefect ever since the
Restoration.</p>

<p>This great event had rekindled the zeal of these gentlemen; the
least thing might have offended them before, now they were no
longer offended by anything. It was rare that the incivility was
direct, but Julien had already overheard at table two or three
brief little passages between the Marquis and his wife, wounding to
those who were placed near them. These noble personages did not
conceal their sincere contempt for everyone that was not the
offspring of people who rode in the King's carriages. Julien
observed that the word Crusade was the only one that brought to
their faces an expression of intense seriousness, blended with
respect. Their ordinary respect had always a shade of
condescension.</p>

<p>In the midst of this magnificence and this boredom, Julien was
interested in nothing but M. de La Mole; he listened with pleasure
one day to his protestations that he was in no way responsible for
the promotion of that poor Le Bourguignon. This was a delicate
attention to the Marquise: Julien had learned the truth from the
abbe Pirard.</p>

<p>One morning when the abbe was working with Julien, in the
Marquis's library, on the endless litigation with Frilair:</p>

<p>'Sir,' said Julien suddenly, 'is dining every evening with
Madame la Marquise one of my duties, or is it a favour that they
show me?'</p>

<p>'It is a signal honour!' replied the abbe, greatly shocked. 'M.
N&mdash;&mdash;, the Academician, who has been paying assiduous
court for the last fifteen years, has never been able to obtain it
for his nephew M. Tanbeau.'</p>

<p>'It is to me, Sir, the most tedious part of my employment. I was
less bored at the Seminary. I see even Mademoiselle de La Mole yawn
at times, although she must be accustomed to the pretty speeches of
the friends of the family. I am afraid of falling asleep. Please be
so good as to obtain leave for me to go and dine for forty sous in
some obscuré inn.'</p>

<p>The abbe, a regular <i>parvenu</i>, was highly sensible of the
honour of dining with a great nobleman. While he was endeavouring
to make Julien understand what he felt, a slight sound made them
turn their heads. Julien saw Mademoiselle de La Mole who was
listening. He blushed. She had come in search of a book and had
heard everything; she felt a certain respect for Julien. 'This
fellow was not born on his knees,' she thought, 'like that old
abbe. Heavens! How ugly he is.'</p>

<p>At dinner, Julien dared not look at Mademoiselle de La Mole, but
she was so kind as to speak to him. That evening, they expected a
large party; she made him promise to remain. Girls in Paris do not
care for men of a certain age, especially when they are not well
dressed. Julien did not require much sagacity to perceive that M.
Le Bourguignon's colleagues, who remained in the drawing-room, had
the honour to be the customary butt of Mademoiselle de La Mole's
wit. That evening, whether with deliberate affectation or not, she
was cruel in her treatment of the bores.</p>

<p>Mademoiselle de La Mole was the centre of a little group that
assembled almost every evening behind the Marquise's immense
armchair. There, you would find the Marquis de Croisenois, the
Comté de Caylus, the Vicomte de Luz and two or three other young
officers, friends of Norbert or his sister. These gentlemen sat
upon a large blue sofa. At the end of the sofa, opposite to that
occupied by the brilliant Mathilde, Julien was silently installed
upon a little cane-bottomed chair with a low seat. This modest post
was the envy of all the flatterers; Norbert kept his father's young
secretary in countenance by addressing him or uttering his name
once or twice in the course of the evening. On this occasion,
Mademoiselle de La Mole asked him what might be the height of the
mountain on which the citadel of Besançon stood. Julien could not
for the life of him have said whether this mountain was higher or
lower than Montmartre. Often he laughed heartily at what was being
said in the little group; but he felt himself incapable of thinking
of anything similar to say. It was like a foreign language which he
could understand, but was unable to speak.</p>

<p>Mathilde's friends were that evening in a state of constant
hostility towards the people who kept arriving in this vast
drawing-room. The friends of the family had the preference at
first, being better known. One can imagine whether Julien was
attentive; everything interested him, both the things themselves,
and the way they were made to seem ridiculous.</p>

<p>'Ah! Here comes M. Descoulis,' said Mathilde; 'he has left off
his wig; can he be hoping to securé a Prefecture by his genius? He
is exposing that bald brow which he says is filled with lofty
thoughts.'</p>

<p>'He is a man who knows the whole world,' said the Marquis de
Croisenois; 'he comes to my uncle, the Cardinal's, too. He is
capable of cultivating a lie with each of his friends, for years on
end, and he has two or three hundred friends. He knows how to
foster friendship, that is his talent. You ought to see him,
covered in mud, at the door of a friend's house, at seven o'clock
on a winter morning.</p>

<p>'He hatches a quarrel, now and again, and writes seven or eight
letters to keep up the quarrel. Then he is reconciled, and produces
seven or eight letters for the transports of affection. But it is
in the frank and sincere expansion of an honest man who can keep
nothing on his conscience that he shines most. This is his
favourite device when he has some favour to ask. One of my uncle's
Vicars-General is perfect when he relates the life of M. Descoulis
since the Restoration. I shall bring him to see you.'</p>

<p>'Bah! I shouldn't listen to that talk; it is the professional
jealousy of small-minded people,' said the Comté de Caylus.</p>

<p>'M. Descoulis will have a name in history,' the Marquis went on;
'he made the Restoration with the Abbe de Pradt and M. Talleyrand
and Pozzo di Borgo.'</p>

<p>'That man has handled millions,' said Norbert, 'and I cannot
conceive why he comes here to swallow my father's epigrams, which
are often appalling. "How many times have you betrayed your
friends, my dear Descoulis?" he shouted at him the other day, down
the whole length of the table.'</p>

<p>'But is it true that he has betrayed people?' said Mademoiselle
de La Mole. 'Who is there that has not?'</p>

<p>'What!' said the Comté de Caylus to Norbert, 'you have M.
Sainclair here, the notorious Liberal; what the devil can he have
come for? I must go over to him, and talk to him, and make him
talk; they say he is so clever.'</p>

<p>'But how can your mother have him in the house?' said M de
Croisenois. 'His ideas are so extravagant, so enthusiastic, so
independent...'</p>

<p>'Look,' said Mademoiselle de La Mole, 'there is your independent
man, bowing to the ground before M. Descoulis, and seizing his
hand. I almost thought he was going to raise it to his lips.'</p>

<p>'Descoulis must stand better with the authorities than we
thought,' put in M. de Croisenois.</p>

<p>'Sainclair comes here to get into the Academy,' said Norbert;
'look how he is bowing to Baron L &mdash;&mdash;, Croisenois.'</p>

<p>'He would be less servile if he went on his knees,' put in M. de
Luz.</p>

<p>'My dear Sorel,' said Norbert, 'you who are a man of brains, but
have just come down from your mountains, see that you never bow to
people as that great poet does, not even to God Almighty.'</p>

<p>'Ah! Here comes a man of brains if you like, M. le Baron Baton,'
said Mademoiselle de La Mole, imitating the voice of the footman
who had just announced him.</p>

<p>'I think even your servants laugh at him. What a name, Baron
Baton!' said M. de Caylus.</p>

<p>'"What's in a name?" as he said to us the other day,' retorted
Mathilde. '"Imagine the Duc de Bouillon announced for the first
time. All the public needs, in my case, is to have grown accustomed
to it."'</p>

<p>Julien quitted the circle round the sofa. Still but little
sensible of the charming subtleties of a light-handed mockery, if
he were to laugh at a witticism, he required that it should be
founded on reason. He could see nothing in the talk of these young
men, but the tone of general depreciation, and this shocked him.
His provincial or English prudery went so far as to detect envy in
it, wherein he was certainly mistaken.</p>

<p>'Comté Norbert,' he said to himself, 'whom I have seen make
three rough copies of a letter of twenty lines to his Colonel,
would be very glad to have written a single page in his life like
those of M. Sainclair.'</p>

<p>Passing unperceived owing to his lack of importance, Julien
approached several groups in turn; he was following Baron Baton at
a distance, and wished to hear him talk. This man of such
intelligence wore a troubled air, and Julien saw him recover
himself a little only when he had hit upon three or four sparkling
sentences. It seemed to Julien that this kind of wit required ample
room to develop itself.</p>

<p>The Baron could not produce epigrams; he required at least four
sentences of six lines each to be brilliant.</p>

<p>'This man is holding forth, he is not talking,' said someone
behind Julien's back. He turned round and flushed with pleasure
when he heard the name of Comté Chalvet. This was the cleverest man
of the day. Julien had often come upon his name in the <i>Memorial
de Sainte-Helene</i> and in the fragments of history dictated by
Napoleon. Comté Chalvet was curt in his speech; his remarks were
flashes of lightning, accurate, keen, profound. If he spoke of any
public matter, immediately one saw the discussion reach a fresh
stage. He brought facts to bear on it, it was a pleasure to listen
to him. In politics, however, he was a brazen cynic.</p>

<p>'I am independent, myself,' he was saying to a gentleman wearing
three decorations, whom he was apparently quizzing. 'Why should I
be expected to hold the same opinion today that I held six weeks
ago? If I did, I should be a slave to my opinion.'</p>

<p>Four grave young men who stood round him made grimaces at this;
these gentlemen do not care for the flippant style. The Comté saw
that he had gone too far. Fortunately he caught sight of the honest
M. Balland, a tartuffe of honesty. The Comté began talking to him:
people gathered round them, guessing that poor Balland was going to
be scarified. By dint of morals and morality, although horribly
ugly, and after early struggles with the world which it would be
hard to describe, M. Balland had married an extremely rich wife,
who died; then a second extremely rich wife, who was never seen in
society. He enjoyed in all humility an income of sixty thousand
livres, and had flatterers of his own. Comté Chalvet spoke to him
of all this, without pity. Presently they were surrounded by a
circle of thirty people. Everyone smiled, even the grave young men,
the hope of the age.</p>

<p>'Why does he come to M. de La Mole's, where he is obviously made
a butt?' thought Julien. He went across to the abbe Pirard, to ask
him.</p>

<p>M. Balland left the room.</p>

<p>'Good!' said Norbert, 'there's one of my father's spies gone;
that leaves only the little cripple Napier.'</p>

<p>'Can that be the clue to the riddle?' thought Julien. 'But, in
that case, why does the Marquis invite M. Balland?'</p>

<p>The stern abbe Pirard was making faces in a corner of the room,
as he heard fresh names announced.</p>

<p>'Why, it is a den,' he said, like Basilic, 'I see none but
villains enter.'</p>

<p>The fact was that the stern abbe did not recognise the
distinguishing marks of good society. But, from his Jansenist
friends, he had a very accurate notion of the men who make their
way into drawing-rooms only by their extreme cleverness in the
service of all parties, or by a fortune of notorious origin. For
some minutes, that evening, he replied from the abundance of his
heart to Julien's eager questions, then cut himself short,
distressed to find himself speaking ill of everyone, and imputing
it to himself as a sin. Being choleric and a Jansenist, and
regarding Christian charity as a duty, his life in society was a
perpetual conflict.</p>

<p>'How frightful that abbe Pirard looks!' Mademoiselle de La Mole
was saying, as Julien returned to the sofa.</p>

<p>Julien felt a sting of irritation, and yet she was right. M.
Pirard was beyond question the most honest man in the room, but his
blotched face, distorted by the pangs of conscience, made him
hideous at the moment. 'Never judge by appearances after this,'
thought Julien; 'it is at the moment when the abbe's scruples are
reproaching him with some peccadillo that he looks terrible;
whereas on the face of that Napier, whom everyone knows to be a
spy, one sees a pure and tranquil happiness.' The abbe Pirard had
nevertheless made a great concession to his party; he had engaged a
valet, and was quite well dressed.</p>

<p>Julien remarked a singular occurrence in the drawing-room: this
was a general movement of all eyes towards the door, with a lull in
the conversation. A footman announced the famous Baron de Tolly, to
whom the recent elections had attracted universal attention. Julien
moved forward and had an excellent view of him. The Baron was
returning officer in a certain constituency: he had had the bright
idea of making away with the little slips of paper bearing the
votes of one of the parties. But, to compensate for this, he duly
replaced them with other little slips of paper bearing a name of
which he himself approved. This decisive manoeuvre was observed by
some of the electors, who lost no time in presenting their
compliments to Baron de Tolly. The worthy man was still pale after
his great excitement. Evil tongues had uttered the word galleys. M.
de La Mole received him coldly. The poor Baron hurriedly made his
escape.</p>

<p>'If he leaves us so soon, it must be to go to M. Comté's,'
[Footnote: A celebrated conjurer of the day.] said Comté Chalvet;
and the others laughed.</p>

<p>Amid a crowd of great noblemen who remained silent, and of
intriguers, mostly disreputable, but all of them clever fellows,
who arrived one after another that evening, in M. de La Mole's
drawing-room (people were speaking of him for a vacant Ministry),
young Tanbeau was winning his spurs. If he had not yet acquired any
fineness of perception, he made up for the deficiency, as we shall
see, by the vigour of his language.</p>

<p>'Why not sentence the man to ten years' imprisonment?' he was
saying at the moment when Julien joined his group; 'it is in a
dungeon underground that we ought to keep reptiles shut up; they
must be made to die in the dark, otherwise their venom spreads and
becomes more dangerous. What is the good of fining him a thousand
crowns? He is poor, very well, all the better; but his party will
pay the fine for him. It should have been a fine of five hundred
francs and ten years in a dungeon.'</p>

<p>'Good God! Who can the monster be that they are discussing?'
thought Julien, marvelling at his colleague's vehement tone and
stilted gestures. The thin, drawn little face of the Academician's
favourite nephew was hideous as he spoke. Julien soon learned that
the person in question was the greatest poet of the day. [Trans.
Footnote: Beranger, sentenced in December, 1828, to imprisonment
and a fine of 10,000 francs. C. K. S. M.]</p>

<p>'Ah, monster!' exclaimed Julien, half aloud, and generous tears
sprang to his eyes. 'Ah, little wretch, I shall make you eat those
words.</p>

<p>'And yet these,' he thought, 'are the waifs and strays of the
party of which the Marquis is one of the leaders! And that
illustrious man whom he is slandering, how many Crosses, how many
sinecurés might he not have collected, if he had sold himself, I do
not say to the lifeless Ministry of M. de Nerval, but to one of
those passably honest Ministers whom we have seen succeed one
another in office?'</p>

<p>The abbe Pirard beckoned to Julien; M. de La Mole had just been
saying something to him. But when Julien, who at the moment was
listening, with lowered gaze, to the lamentations of a Bishop, was
free to move, and able to join his friend, he found him monopolised
by that abominable young Tanbeau. The little monster loathed him as
the source of the favour that Julien enjoyed, and had come to pay
court to him.</p>

<p>'When will death rid us of that old mass of corruption?' It was
in these terms, with Biblical emphasis, that the little man of
letters was speaking at that moment of the eminent Lord Holland.
His chief merit was a thorough knowledge of the biography of living
men, and he had just been making a rapid survey of all those who
might aspire to positions of influence under the new King of
England.</p>

<p>The abbe Pirard moved into an adjoining room; Julien followed
him.</p>

<p>'The Marquis does not like scribblers, I warn you; it is his one
antipathy. Know Latin, Greek if you can, the History of the
Egyptians, of the Persians, and so forth; he will honour you and
protect you as a scholar. But do not go and write a single page in
French, especially upon grave subjects, that are above your
position in society; he would call you a scribbler, and would take
a dislike to you. What, living in a great nobleman's mansion, don't
you know the Duc de Castries's saying about d'Alembert and
Rousseau: "That sort of fellow wishes to argue about everything,
and has not a thousand crowns a year?"'</p>

<p>'Everything becomes known,' thought Julien, 'here as in the
Seminary.' He had written nine or ten pages with distinct emphasis:
they were a sort of historical eulogy of the old Surgeon-Major,
who, he said, had made a man of him. 'And that little copy-book,'
Julien said to himself, 'has always been kept under lock and key.'
He went upstairs, burned his manuscript and returned to the
drawing-room. The brilliant rogues had departed, there remained
only the stars and ribands.</p>

<p>Round the table, which the servants had just brought in already
laid, were seated seven or eight ladies, extremely noble, extremely
religious, extremely affected, between thirty and thirty-five years
of age. The brilliant wife of Marshal de Fervaques entered the
room, apologising for the lateness of the hour. It was after
midnight; she took her place next to the Marquise. Julien was
deeply stirred; her eyes and her expression reminded him of Madame
de Rênal.</p>

<p>The group round Mademoiselle de La Mole was still numerous. She
and her friends were engaged in making fun of the unfortunate Comté
de Thaler. This was the only son of the famous Jew, celebrated for
the riches that he had acquired by lending money to Kings to make
war on the common people. The Jew had recently died leaving his son
a monthly income of one hundred thousand crowns, and a name that,
alas, was only too well known! This singular position required
either simplicity of character or great determination.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the Comté was nothing but a good fellow, adorned
with all sorts of pretensions inspired in him by his
flatterers.</p>

<p>M. de Caylus asserted that he had been credited with the
determination to propose for the hand of Mademoiselle de La Mole
(to whom the Marquis de Croisenois, who was heir to a Dukedom with
an income of one hundred thousand livres, was paying court).</p>

<p>'Ah! Don't accuse him of having any determination,' Norbert
pleaded compassionately.</p>

<p>What this poor Comté de Thaler most lacked was, perhaps, the
power to determine anything. In this respect, he would have made an
excellent King. Taking advice incessantly from everybody, he had
not the courage to follow out any suggestion to the end.</p>

<p>His features would have been enough by themselves, said
Mademoiselle de La Mole, to fill her with everlasting joy. His face
was a curious blend of uneasiness and disappointment; but from time
to time one could make out quite plainly bursts of self-importance,
combined with that cutting tone which the wealthiest man in France
ought to adopt, especially when he is by no means bad-looking, and
is not yet thirty-six. 'He is timidly insolent,' said M. de
Croisenois. The Comté de Caylus, Norbert and two or three young men
with moustaches made fun of him to their hearts' content, without
his guessing it, and finally sent him away as one o'clock
struck.</p>

<p>'Is it your famous pair of arabs that you are keeping waiting in
this weather?' Norbert asked him.</p>

<p>'No, I have a new pair that cost much less,' replied M. de
Thaler. 'The near horse cost me five thousand francs, and the off
horse is only worth a hundred louis; but I must have you understand
that he is only brought out at night. The fact is that he trots
perfectly with the other.'</p>

<p>Norbert's remark made the Comté think that it befitted a man in
his position to have a passion for horses, and that he ought not to
allow his to stand in the rain. He left, and the other gentlemen
took their leave immediately, laughing at him as they went.</p>

<p>'And so,' thought Julien, as he heard the sound of their
laughter on the staircase, 'I have been allowed to see the opposite
extreme to my own position! I have not an income of twenty louis,
and I have found myself rubbing shoulders with a man who has an
income of twenty louis an hour, and they laughed at him...A sight
like that curés one of envy.'</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch35" id="ch35"></a>Chapter 35. Sensibility and a
Pious Lady</h2>

<p style="margin-left:10%">The smallest living idea seems an
outrage, so accustomed are<br>
people there to words without colour. Woe to the man who<br>
innovates while he speaks!<br>
&mdash;FAUBLAS</p>

<p>After many months of trial, this is the stage that Julien had
reached on the day when the steward of the household paid him his
third quarter's salary. M. de La Mole had set him to study the
management of his estates in Brittany and Normandy. Julien made
frequent journeys to those parts. His principal duty was to take
charge of the correspondence relative to the famous lawsuit with
the abbe de Frilair. M. Pirard had given him the necessary
instructions.</p>

<p>&gt;From the brief notes which the Marquis used to scribble on
the margins of the papers of all kinds that came to him, Julien
composed letters almost all of which were signed.</p>

<p>At the school of theology, his teachers complained of his lack
of industry, but regarded him none the less as one of their most
distinguished pupils. These several labours, taken up with all the
ardour of a chafed ambition, had soon robbed Julien of the fresh
complexion he had brought with him from the country. His pallor was
a merit in the eyes of the young seminarists his companions; he
found them much less irritating, much less inclined to fall upon
their knees before a coin of the realm than those at Besançon;
they, for their part, supposed him to be consumptive. The Marquis
had given him a horse.</p>

<p>Afraid of their seeing him when he was out riding, Julien had
told them that this exercise had been ordered him by the doctors.
The abbe Pirard had taken him to a number of Jansenist societies.
Julien was astonished; the idea of religion was inseparably linked
in his mind with that of hypocrisy, and the hope of making money.
He admired these devout and stern men who took no interest in the
budget. Several of the Jansenists had formed an affection for him
and gave him advice. A new world opened before him. He met among
the Jansenists a certain Conte Altamira, a man six feet in height,
a Liberal under sentence of death in his own country, and a devout
Catholic. This strange incongruity, religion wedded to a love of
freedom, impressed him.</p>

<p>Julien was out of favour with the young Count. Norbert had found
that he replied with too much warmth to the pleasantries of certain
of his friends. Julien after being guilty once or twice of a breach
of good manners, had pledged himself never to address another word
to Mademoiselle Mathilde. They were always perfectly civil to him
at the Hotel de La Mole; but he felt that he had fallen in their
esteem. His provincial common sense explained this change in the
words of the popular proverb: 'new is beautiful.'</p>

<p>Perhaps his perception was now a little clearer than at first,
or else the first fascination produced by the urbanity of Paris had
ceased.</p>

<p>As soon as he stopped working, he fell into the clutches of a
deadly boredom; this was the withering effect of the politeness,
admirable in itself, but so measured, so perfectly graduated
according to one's position, which is a mark of high society. A
heart that is at all sensitive discerns the artificiality.</p>

<p>No doubt, provincials may be accused of a trace of vulgarity, or
of a want of politeness; but they do show a little warmth in
answering one. Never, in the Hotel de La Mole, was Julien's
self-esteem wounded; but often, at the end of the day he felt
inclined to weep. In the provinces, a waiter in a café takes an
interest in you if you meet with some accident on entering his
café; but if that accident involves anything capable of wounding
your vanity, then, in condoling with you, he will repeat again and
again the word that makes you wince. In Paris they are so
considerate as to turn their backs to laugh at you, but you will
always remain a stranger.</p>

<p>We pass without comment over a multitude of minor adventures
which would have brought Julien into ridicule had he not been in a
sense beneath ridicule. An insane self-consciousness made him
commit thousands of blunders. All his pleasures were forms of
precaution; he practised with his pistol every day, and was
numbered among the more promising pupils of the most famous fencing
masters. Whenever he had a moment to spare, instead of spending it
with a book as at one time, he would dash to the riding school and
as ask for the most vicious horses. In his outings with the riding
master, he was almost invariably thrown.</p>

<p>The Marquis found him useful owing to his persistent hard work,
his reticence and his intelligence, and, by degrees, entrusted him
with the handling of all his business that was at all complicated.
In those moments in which his lofty ambition allowed him some
relaxation, the Marquis did his business with sagacity; being in a
position to hear all the latest news, he speculated with success.
He bought houses, timber; but he took offence easily. He gave away
hundreds of louis and went to law over hundreds of francs. Rich men
with big ideas seek amusement and not results from their private
undertakings. The Marquis needed a chief of staff who would put all
his financial affairs into an easily intelligible order.</p>

<p>Madame de La Mole, albeit of so restrained a character, would
sometimes make fun of Julien. The unexpected, an outcome of
sensibility, horrifies great ladies; it is a direct challenge to
all the conventions. On two or three occasions the Marquis took his
part: 'If he is absurd in your drawing-room, in his own office he
reigns supreme.' Julien, for his part, thought he could divine the
Marquise's secret. She deigned to take an interest in everything as
soon as her servants announced the Baron de La Joumate. This was a
chilly creature, with expressionless features. He was small, thin,
ugly, very well dressed, he spent all his time at the Chateau and,
as a rule, had nothing to say about anything. His speech revealed
his mind. Madame de La Mole would have been passionately happy, for
the first time in her life, if she could have securéd him as a
husband for her daughter.</p>

<h2><a name="ch36" id="ch36"></a>Chapter 36. Pronunciation</h2>

<p>Their lofty mission is to pass calm judgment on the trivial<br>
events in the daily life of nations. Their wisdom should<br>
pre-empt any fury caused by little things, or by events<br>
which the voice of repute transfigures in bruiting them abroad.<br>
&mdash;GRATIUS</p>

<p>For a newcomer, who, out of pride, never asked any questions,
Julien managed to avoid any serious pitfall. One day, when he had
been driven into a café in the Rue Saint-Honore by a sudden shower,
a tall man in a beaver coat, surprised at his gloomy stare, began
to stare back at him exactly as Mademoiselle Amanda's lover had
stared at him, long before, at Besançon.</p>

<p>Julien had too often reproached himself for having allowed the
former insult to pass unpunished to tolerate this stare. He
demanded an explanation, the man in the greatcoat at once began to
abuse him in the foulest terms: everyone in the café gathered round
them; the passers-by stopped outside the door. With provincial
caution, Julien always carried a brace of pocket pistols; his hand
gripped one of these in his pocket with a convulsive movement.
Better counsels prevailed, however, and he confined himself to
repeating with clockwork regularity: 'Sir, your address? I scorn
you.'</p>

<p>The persistence with which he clung to these six words began to
impress the crowd.</p>

<p>'Gad, that other fellow who goes on talking by himself ought to
give him his address.' The man in the greatcoat, hearing this
opinion freely vented, flung a handful of visiting cards in
Julien's face. Fortunately, none of them hit him, he had vowed that
he would use his pistol only in the event of his being touched. The
man went away, not without turning round from time to time to shake
his fist at Julien and to shout abuse.</p>

<p>Julien found himself bathed in sweat. 'So it lies within the
power of the lowest of mankind to work me up like this!' he said
angrily to himself. 'How am I to destroy this humiliating
sensibility?'</p>

<p>Where was he to find a second? He had made the acquaintance of a
number of men; but all of them, after six weeks or so, had drifted
away from him. 'I am unsociable, and here I am cruelly punished for
it,' he thought. Finally, it occurred to him to apply to a retired
Lieutenant of the 96th named Lieven, a poor devil with whom he used
often to fence. Julien was frank with him.</p>

<p>'I shall be glad to be your second,' said Lieven, 'but upon one
condition: if you do not hit your man, you shall fight with me,
there and then.'</p>

<p>'Agreed,' said Julien, with delight; and they went to find M. C.
de Beauvoisis at the address indicated upon his cards, in the heart
of the Faubourg Saint-Germain.</p>

<p>It was seven o'clock in the morning. It was only when he sent in
his name that it occurred to Julien that this might be Madame de
Rênal's young relative, formerly attached to the Embassy at Rome or
Naples, who had given the singer Geronimo a letter of
introduction.</p>

<p>Julien had handed to a tall footman one of the cards flung at
him the day before, together with one of his own.</p>

<p>He was kept waiting, with his second, for fully three quarters
of an hour; finally they were shown into an admirably furnished
apartment. They found a tall young man, got up like a doll; his
features exemplified the perfection and the insignificance of
Grecian beauty. His head, remarkably narrow, was crowned with a
pyramid of the most beautiful golden locks. These were curled with
scrupulous care, not a hair stood out from the rest. 'It is to have
his hair curled like that,' thought the Lieutenant of the 96th,
'that this damned idiot has been keeping us waiting.' His striped
dressing-gown, his morning trousers, everything, down to his
embroidered slippers, was correct and marvellously well cared for.
His features, noble and vacuous, betokened a propriety and paucity
of ideas, the ideal of the well-meaning man, a horror of the
unexpected and of ridicule, an abundance of gravity.</p>

<p>Julien, to whom his Lieutenant of the 96th had explained that to
keep him waiting so long, after rudely flinging his card in his
face, was an additional insult, strode boldly into M. de
Beauvoisis's presence. It was his intention to be insolent, but he
wished at the same time to show his good breeding.</p>

<p>He was so much impressed by M. de Beauvoisis's gentle manners,
by his air at once formal, important and self-satisfied, by the
admirable elegance of his surroundings, that in a twinkling all
thought of being insolent forsook him. This was not his man of the
day before. So great was his astonishment at finding so
distinguished a person in place of the vulgar fellow he had met in
the café, that he could not think of a single word to say. He
presented one of the cards that had been flung at him:</p>

<p>'This is my name,' said the man of fashion, in whom Julien's
black coat, at seven o'clock in the morning, inspired but scant
respect; 'but I do not understand, the honour...'</p>

<p>His way of pronouncing these last words restored some of
Julien's ill humour.</p>

<p>'I have come to fight with you, Sir,' and he rapidly explained
the situation.</p>

<p>M. Charles de Beauvoisis, after giving it careful thought, was
quite satisfied with the cut of Julien's black coat. 'From Staub's,
clearly,' he said to himself, listening to him in silence, 'that
waistcoat is in good taste, the boots are right; but, on the other
hand, that black coat in the early morning!...It will be to stop
the bullet,' thought the Chevalier de Beauvoisis.</p>

<p>As soon as he had furnished himself with this explanation, he
reverted to a perfect politeness, and addressed Julien almost as an
equal. The discussion lasted for some time, it was a delicate
matter; but in the end Julien could not reject the evidence of his
own eyes. The well-bred young man whom he saw before him bore no
resemblance whatsoever to the rude person who, the day before, had
insulted him.</p>

<p>Julien felt an invincible reluctance to go away, he prolonged
the explanation. He observed the self-sufficiency of the Chevalier
de Beauvoisis, for such was the style that he had adopted in
referring to himself, shocked at Julien's addressing him as
Monsieur, pure and simple.</p>

<p>He admired the other's gravity, blended with a certain modest
fatuity but never discarded for a single instant. He was astonished
by the curious way in which his tongue moved as he enunciated his
words...But after all, in all this, there was not the slightest
reason to pick a quarrel with him.</p>

<p>The young diplomat offered to fight with great courtesy, but the
ex-Lieutenant of the 96th, who had been sitting for an hour with
his legs apart, his hands on his hips and his arms akimbo, decided
that his friend, M. Sorel, was not the sort of person to pick a
quarrel, in the German fashion, with another man, because that
man's visiting cards had been stolen.</p>

<p>Julien left the house in the worst of tempers. The Chevalier de
Beauvoisis's carriage was waiting for him in the courtyard, in
front of the steps; as it happened, Julien raised his eyes and
recognised his man of the previous day in the coachman.</p>

<p>Seeing him, grasping him by the skirts of his coat, pulling him
down from his box and belabouring him with his whip, were the work
of a moment. Two lackeys tried to defend their fellow; Julien
received a pummelling: immediately he drew one of his pocket
pistols and fired at them; they took to their heels. It was all
over in a minute.</p>

<p>The Chevalier de Beauvoisis came slowly downstairs with the most
charming gravity, repeating in the accents of a great nobleman:
'What's this? What's this?' His curiosity was evidently aroused,
but his diplomatic importance did not allow him to show any sign of
interest. When he learned what the matter was, a lofty pride still
struggled in his features against the slightly playful coolness
which ought never to be absent from the face of a diplomat.</p>

<p>The Lieutenant of the 96th realised that M. de Beauvoisis was
anxious to fight; he wished also, diplomatically enough, to
preserve for his friend the advantages of the initiative. 'This
time,' he cried, 'there are grounds for a duel!' 'I should think
so,' replied the diplomat.</p>

<p>'I dismiss that rascal,' he said to his servants; 'someone else
must drive.' They opened the carriage door: the Chevalier insisted
that Julien and his second should get in before him. They went to
find a friend of M. de Beauvoisis, who suggested a quiet spot. The
conversation as they drove to it was perfect. The only odd thing
was the diplomat in undress.</p>

<p>'These gentlemen, although of the highest nobility,' thought
Julien, 'are not in the least boring like the people who come to
dine with M. de La Mole; and I can see why,' he added a moment
later, 'they are not ashamed to be indecent.' They were speaking of
the dancers whom the public had applauded in a ballet of the
previous evening. The gentlemen made allusions to spicy anecdotes
of which Julien and his second, the Lieutenant of the 96th, were
entirely ignorant. Julien did not make the mistake of pretending to
know them; he admitted his ignorance with good grace. This
frankness found favour with the Chevalier's friend; he repeated the
anecdotes to him in full detail, and extremely well.</p>

<p>One thing astonished Julien vastly. A station which was being
erected in the middle of the street for the Corpus Christi day
procession, held up the carriage for a moment. The gentlemen
indulged in a number of pleasantries; the curé, according to them,
was the son of an Archbishop. Never, in the house of the Marquis de
La Mole, who hoped to become a Duke, would anyone have dared to say
such a thing.</p>

<p>The duel was over in an instant: Julien received a bullet in his
arm; they bound it up for him with handkerchiefs; these were soaked
in brandy, and the Chevalier de Beauvoisis asked Julien most
politely to allow him to take him home, in the carriage that had
brought them. When Julien gave his address as the Hotel de La Mole,
the young diplomat and his friend exchanged glances. Julien's cab
was waiting, but he found these gentlemen's conversation infinitely
more amusing than that of the worthy Lieutenant of the 96th.</p>

<p>'Good God! A duel, is that all?' thought Julien. 'How fortunate
I was to come across that coachman again! What a misfortune, if I
had had to endure that insult a second time in a cafe!' The amusing
conversation had scarcely been interrupted. Julien now understood
that the affectation of a diplomat does serve some purpose.</p>

<p>'So dullness is by no means inherent,' he said to himself, 'in a
conversation between people of high birth! These men make fun of
the Corpus Christi day procession, they venture to repeat highly
scabrous anecdotes, and with picturesque details. Positively the
only thing lacking to them is judgment in politics, and this
deficiency is more than made up for by the charm of their tone and
the perfect aptness of their expressions.' Julien felt himself
keenly attracted to them. 'How glad I should be to see them
often!'</p>

<p>No sooner had they parted than the Chevalier de Beauvoisis
hastened in search of information: what he heard was by no means
promising.</p>

<p>He was extremely curious to know his man better; could he with
decency call upon him? The scanty information he managed to obtain
was not of an encouraging nature.</p>

<p>'This is frightful!' he said to his second. 'It is impossible
for me to admit that I have fought a duel with a mere secretary of
M. de La Mole, and that because I have been robbed of my visiting
cards by a coachman.'</p>

<p>'Certainly the whole story leaves one exposed to ridicule.'</p>

<p>That evening, the Chevalier de Beauvoisis spread the report
everywhere that this M. Sorel, who incidentally was a perfectly
charming young man, was the natural son of an intimate friend of
the Marquis de La Mole. The rumour passed without difficulty. As
soon as it was established, the young diplomat and his friend
deigned to pay Julien several visits, during the fortnight for
which he was confined to his room. Julien confessed to them that he
had never in his life been to the Opera.</p>

<p>'This is terrible,' they told him, 'where else does one go? Your
first outing must be to the <i>Comté Ory</i>.'</p>

<p>At the Opera, the Chevalier de Beauvoisis presented him to the
famous singer Geronimo, who was enjoying an immense success that
season.</p>

<p>Julien almost paid court to the Chevalier; his blend of
self-respect, mysterious importance and boyish fatuity enchanted
him. For instance, the Chevalier stammered slightly because he had
the honour to be frequently in the company of a great nobleman who
suffered from that infirmity. Never had Julien seen combined in a
single person the absurdity which keeps one amused and the
perfection of manners which a poor provincial must seek to
copy.</p>

<p>He was seen at the Opera with the Chevalier de Beauvoisis; their
association caused his name to be mentioned.</p>

<p>'Well, Sir!' M. de La Mole said to him one day, 'and so you are
the natural son of a rich gentleman of the Franche-Comté, my
intimate friend!'</p>

<p>The Marquis cut Julien short when he tried to protest that he
had in no way helped to give currency to this rumour.</p>

<p>'M. de Beauvoisis did not wish to have fought a duel with a
carpenter's son.'</p>

<p>'I know, I know,' said M. de La Mole; 'it rests with me now to
give consistency to the story, which suits me. But I have one
favour to ask you, which will cost you no more than half an hour of
your time: every Opera evening, at half-past eleven, go and stand
in the vestibule when the people of fashion are coming out. I still
notice provincial mannerisms in you at times, you must get rid of
them; besides, it can do you no harm to know, at least by sight,
important personages to whom I may one day have occasion to send
you. Call at the box office to have yourself identified; they have
placed your name on the list.'</p>

<h2><a name="ch37" id="ch37"></a>Chapter 37. An Attack of Gout</h2>

<p style="margin-left:10%">And I received promotion, not on my own
merits, but because<br>
my master had the gout.<br>
&mdash;BERTOLOTTI</p>

<p>The reader is perhaps surprised at this free and almost friendly
tone; we have forgotten to say that for six weeks the Marquis had
been confined to the house by an attack of gout.</p>

<p>Mademoiselle de La Mole and her mother were at Hyeres, with the
Marquise's mother. Comté Norbert saw his father only for brief
moments; they were on the best of terms, but had nothing to say to
one another. M. de La Mole, reduced to Julien's company, was
astonished to find him endowed with ideas. He made him read the
newspapers aloud. Soon the young secretary was able to select the
interesting passages. There was a new paper which the Marquis
abhorred; he had vowed that he would never read it, and spoke of it
every day. Julien laughed. The Marquis, out of patience with the
times, made Julien read him Livy; the translation improvised from
the Latin text amused him.</p>

<p>One day the Marquis said, with that tone of over-elaborate
politeness, which often tried Julien's patience:</p>

<p>'Allow me, my dear Sorel, to make you the present of a blue
coat: when it suits you to put it on and to pay me a visit, you
will be, in my eyes, the younger brother of the Comté de Chaulnes,
that is to say, the son of my old friend the Duke.'</p>

<p>Julien was somewhat in the dark as to what was happening; that
evening he ventured to pay a visit in his blue coat. The Marquis
treated him as an equal. Julien had a heart capable of appreciating
true politeness, but he had no idea of the finer shades. He would
have sworn, before this caprice of the Marquis, that it would be
impossible to be received by him with greater deference. 'What a
marvellous talent!' Julien said to himself; when he rose to go, the
Marquis apologised for not being able to see him to the door on
account of his gout.</p>

<p>Julien was obsessed by this strange idea: 'Can he be laughing at
me?' he wondered. He went to seek the advice of the abbe Pirard,
who, less courteous than the Marquis, answered him only with a
whistle and changed the subject. The following morning Julien
appeared before the Marquis, in a black coat, with his portfolio
and the letters to be signed. He was received in the old manner.
That evening, in his blue coat, it was with an entirely different
tone and one in every way as polite as the evening before.</p>

<p>'Since you appear to find some interest in the visits which you
are so kind as to pay to a poor, suffering old man,' the Marquis
said to him, 'you must speak to him of all the little incidents in
your life, but openly, and without thinking of anything but how to
relate them clearly and in an amusing fashion. For one must have
amusement,' the Marquis went on; 'that is the only real thing in
life. A man cannot save my life on a battle-field every day, nor
can he make me every day the present of a million; but if I had
Rivarol here, by my couch, every day, he would relieve me of an
hour of pain and boredom. I saw a great deal of him at Hamburg,
during the Emigration.'</p>

<p>And the Marquis told Julien stories of Rivarol among the
Hamburgers, who would club together in fours to elucidate the point
of a witty saying.</p>

<p>M. de La Mole, reduced to the society of this young cleric,
sought to enliven him. He stung Julien's pride. Since he was asked
for the truth, Julien determined to tell his whole story; but with
the suppression of two things: his fanatical admiration for a name
which made the Marquis furious, and his entire unbelief, which
hardly became a future curé. His little affair with the Chevalier
de Beauvoisis arrived most opportunely. The Marquis laughed till he
cried at the scene in the café in the Rue Saint-Honore, with the
coachman who covered him with foul abuse. It was a period of
perfect frankness in the relations between employer and
protege.</p>

<p>M. de La Mole became interested in this singular character. At
first, he played with Julien's absurdities, for his own
entertainment; soon he found it more interesting to correct, in the
gentlest manner, the young man's mistaken view of life. 'Most
provincials who come to Paris admire everything,' thought the
Marquis; 'this fellow hates everything. They have too much
sentiment, he has not enough, and fools take him for a fool.'</p>

<p>The attack of gout was prolonged by the wintry weather and
lasted for some months.</p>

<p>'One becomes attached to a fine spaniel,' the Marquis told
himself; 'why am I so ashamed of becoming attached to this young
cleric? He is original. I treat him like a son; well, what harm is
there in that! This fancy, if it lasts, will cost me a diamond
worth five hundred louis in my will.'</p>

<p>Once the Marquis had realised the firm character of his protege,
he entrusted him with some fresh piece of business every day.</p>

<p>Julien noticed with alarm that this great nobleman would
occasionally give him contradictory instructions with regard to the
same matter.</p>

<p>This was liable to land him in serious trouble. Julien, when he
came to work with the Marquis, invariably brought a diary in which
he wrote down his instructions, and the Marquis initialled them.
Julien had engaged a clerk who copied out the instructions relative
to each piece of business in a special book. In this book were kept
also copies of all letters.</p>

<p>This idea seemed at first the most ridiculous and tiresome thing
imaginable. But, in less than two months, the Marquis realised its
advantages. Julien suggested engaging a clerk from a bank, who
should keep an account by double entry of all the revenue from and
expenditure on the estates of which he himself had charge.</p>

<p>These measures so enlightened the Marquis as to his own
financial position that he was able to give himself the pleasure of
embarking on two or three fresh speculations without the assistance
of his broker, who had been robbing him.</p>

<p>'Take three thousand francs for yourself,' he said, one day to
his young minister.</p>

<p>'But, Sir, my conduct may be criticised.'</p>

<p>'What do you want, then?' replied the Marquis, with
irritation.</p>

<p>'I want you to be so kind as to make a formal agreement, and to
write it down yourself in the book; the agreement will award me a
sum of three thousand francs. Besides, it was M. l'abbe Pirard who
first thought of all this book-keeping.' The Marquis, with the
bored expression of the Marquis de Moncade, listening to M.
Poisson, his steward, reading his accounts, wrote out his
instructions.</p>

<p>In the evening, when Julien appeared in his blue coat, there was
never any talk of business. The Marquis's kindness was so
flattering to our hero's easily wounded vanity that presently, in
spite of himself, he felt a sort of attachment to this genial old
man. Not that Julien was sensitive, as the word is understood in
Paris; but he was not a monster, and no one, since the death of the
old Surgeon-Major, had spoken to him so kindly. He remarked with
astonishment that the Marquis showed a polite consideration for his
self-esteem which he had never received from the old surgeon.
Finally he realised that the surgeon had been prouder of his Cross
than the Marquis was of his Blue Riband. The Marquis was the son of
a great nobleman.</p>

<p>One day, at the end of a morning interview, in his black coat,
and for the discussion of business, Julien amused the Marquis, who
kept him for a couple of hours, and positively insisted upon giving
him a handful of bank notes which his broker had just brought him
from the Bourse.</p>

<p>'I hope, Monsieur le Marquis, not to be wanting in the profound
respect which I owe you if I ask you to allow me to say
something.'</p>

<p>'Speak, my friend.'</p>

<p>'Will Monsieur le Marquis be graciously pleased to let me
decline this gift. It is not to the man in black that it is
offered, and it would at once put an end to the liberties which he
is so kind as to tolerate from the man in blue.' He bowed most
respectfully, and left the room without looking round.</p>

<p>This attitude amused the Marquis, who reported it that evening
to the abbe Pirard.</p>

<p>'There is something that I must at last confess to you, my dear
abbe. I know the truth about Julien's birth, and I authorise you
not to keep this confidence secret.</p>

<p>'His behaviour this morning was noble,' thought the Marquis,
'and I shall ennoble him.'</p>

<p>Some time after this, the Marquis was at length able to leave
his room.</p>

<p>'Go and spend a couple of months in London,' he told Julien.
'The special couriers and other messengers will bring you the
letters I receive, with my notes. You will write the replies and
send them to me, enclosing each letter with its reply. I have
calculated that the delay will not amount to more than five
days.'</p>

<p>As he travelled post along the road to Calais, Julien thought
with amazement of the futility of the alleged business on which he
was being sent.</p>

<p>We shall not describe the feeling of horror, almost of hatred,
with which he set foot on English soil. The reader is aware of his
insane passion for Bonaparte. He saw in every officer a Sir Hudson
Lowe, in every nobleman a Lord Bathurst, ordering the atrocities of
Saint Helena, and receiving his reward in ten years of office.</p>

<p>In London he at last made acquaintance with the extremes of
fatuity. He made friends with some young Russian gentlemen who
initiated him.</p>

<p>'You are predestined, my dear Sorel,' they told him, 'you are
endowed by nature with that cold expression <i>a thousand leagues
from the sensation of the moment</i>, which we try so hard to
assume.'</p>

<p>'You have not understood our age,' Prince Korasoff said to him;
'<i>always do the opposite to what people expect of you</i>. That,
upon my honour, is the only religion of the day. Do not be either
foolish or affected, for then people will expect foolishness and
affectations, and you will not be obeying the rule.'</p>

<p>Julien covered himself with glory one day in the drawing-room of
the Duke of Fitz-Fulke, who had invited him to dine, with Prince
Korasoff. The party were kept waiting for an hour. The way in which
Julien comported himself amid the score of persons who stood
waiting is still quoted by the young Secretaries of Embassy in
London. His expression was inimitable.</p>

<p>He was anxious to meet, notwithstanding his friends the dandies,
the celebrated Philip Vane, the one philosopher that England has
produced since Locke. He found him completing his seventh year in
prison. 'The aristocracy does not take things lightly in this
country,' thought Julien; 'in addition to all this, Vane is
disgraced, abused,' etc.</p>

<p>Julien found him good company; the fury of the aristocracy kept
him amused. 'There,' Julien said to himself, as he left the prison,
'is the one cheerful man that I have met in England.'</p>

<p>'The idea of most use to tyrants is that of God,' Vane had said
to him.</p>

<p>We suppress the rest of the philosopher's system as being
cynical.</p>

<p>On his return: 'What amusing idea have you brought me from
England?' M. de La Mole asked him. He remained silent. 'What idea
have you brought, amusing or not?' the Marquis went on,
sharply.</p>

<p>'First of all,' said Julien, 'the wisest man in England is mad
for an hour daily; he is visited by the demon of suicide, who is
the national deity.</p>

<p>'Secondly, intelligence and genius forfeit twenty-five per cent
of their value on landing in England.</p>

<p>'Thirdly, nothing in the world is so beautiful, admirable,
moving as the English countryside.'</p>

<p>'Now, it is my turn,' said the Marquis.</p>

<p>'First of all, what made you say, at the ball at the Russian
Embassy, that there are in France three hundred thousand young men
of five and twenty who are passionately anxious for war? Do you
think that that is quite polite to the Crowned Heads?'</p>

<p>'One never knows what to say in speaking to our great
diplomats,' said Julien. They have a mania for starting serious
discussions. If one confines oneself to the commonplaces of the
newspapers, one is reckoned a fool. If one allows oneself to say
something true and novel, they are astonished, they do not know how
to answer, and next morning, at seven o'clock they send word to one
by the First Secretary, that one has been impolite.'</p>

<p>'Not bad,' said the Marquis, with a laugh. 'I wager, however,
Master Philosopher, that you have not discovered what you went to
England to do.'</p>

<p>'Pardon me,' replied Julien; 'I went there to dine once a week
with His Majesty's Ambassador, who is the most courteous of
men.'</p>

<p>'You went to securé the Cross which is lying there' the Marquis
told him. 'I do not wish to make you lay aside your black coat, and
I have grown accustomed to the more amusing tone which I have
adopted with the man in blue. Until further orders, understand
this: when I see this Cross, you are the younger son of my friend
the Duc de Chaulnes, who, without knowing it, has been for the last
six months employed in diplomacy. Observe,' added the Marquis, with
a highly serious air, cutting short Julien's expressions of
gratitude, 'that I do not on any account wish you to rise above
your station. That is always a mistake, and a misfortune both for
patron and for protege. When my lawsuits bore you, or when you no
longer suit me I shall ask for a good living for you, like that of
our friend the abbe Pirard, and <i>nothing more</i>,' the Marquis
added, in the driest of tones.</p>

<p>This Cross set Julien's pride at rest; he began to talk far more
freely. He felt himself less frequently insulted and made a butt by
those remarks, susceptible of some scarcely polite interpretation,
which, in the course of an animated conversation, may fall from the
lips of anyone.</p>

<p>His Cross was the cause of an unexpected visit; this was from M.
le Baron de Valenod, who came to Paris to thank the Minister for
his Barony and to come to an understanding with him. He was going
to be appointed Mayor of Verrières in the place of M. de Rênal.</p>

<p>Julien was consumed with silent laughter when M. de Valenod gave
him to understand that it had just been discovered that M de Rênal
was a Jacobin. The fact was that, in a new election which was in
preparation, the new Baron was the ministerial candidate, and in
the combined constituency of the Department, which in reality was
strongly Ultra, it was M. de Rênal who was being put forward by the
Liberals.</p>

<p>It was in vain that Julien tried to learn something of Madame de
Rênal; the Baron appeared to remember their former rivalry, and was
impenetrable. He ended by asking Julien for his father's vote at
the coming election. Julien promised to write.</p>

<p>'You ought, Monsieur le Chevalier, to introduce me to M. le
Marquis de La Mole.'</p>

<p>'Indeed, so <i>I ought</i>,' thought Julien; 'but a rascal like
this!'</p>

<p>'To be frank,' he replied, 'I am too humble a person in the
Hotel de La Mole to take it upon me to introduce anyone.'</p>

<p>Julien told the Marquis everything: that evening he informed him
of Valenod's pretension, and gave an account of his life and
actions since 1814.</p>

<p>'Not only,' M. de La Mole replied, with a serious air, 'will you
introduce the new Baron to me tomorrow, but I shall invite him to
dine the day after. He will be one of our new Prefects.'</p>

<p>'In that case,' retorted Julien coldly, 'I request the post of
Governor of the Poorhouse for my father.'</p>

<p>'Excellent,' said the Marquis, recovering his gaiety; 'granted;
I was expecting a sermon. You are growing up.'</p>

<p>M. de Valenod informed Julien that the keeper of the lottery
office at Verrières had just died; Julien thought it amusing to
bestow this place upon M. de Cholin, the old imbecile whose
petition he had picked up in the room occupied there by M. de La
Mole. The Marquis laughed heartily at the petition which Julien
recited as he made him sign the letter applying for this post to
the Minister of Finance.</p>

<p>No sooner had M. de Cholin been appointed than Julien learned
that this post had been requested by the Deputies of the Department
for M. Gros, the celebrated geometrician: this noble-hearted man
had an income of only fourteen hundred francs, and every year had
been lending six hundred francs to the late holder of the post, to
help him to bring up his family.</p>

<p>Julien was astonished at the effect of what he had done. 'It is
nothing,' he told himself; 'I must be prepared for many other acts
of injustice, if I am to succeed, and, what is more, must know how
to conceal them, under a cloak of fine sentimental words: poor M,
Gros! It is he that deserved the Cross, it is I that have it, and I
must act according to the wishes of the Government that has given
it to me.'</p>

<h2><a name="ch38" id="ch38"></a>Chapter 38. What Is the Decoration
that Confers Distinction?</h2>

<p style="margin-left:10%">Your water does not refresh me, said the
thirsty genie.<br>
Yet it is the coolest well in all the Diar Bekir.<br>
&mdash;PELLICO</p>

<p>One day Julien returned from the charming property of
Villequier, on the bank of the Seine, in which M. de La Mole took a
special interest because, of all his estates, it was the only one
that had belonged to the celebrated Boniface de La Mole. He found
at the Hotel the Marquise and her daughter, who had returned from
Hyeres.</p>

<p>Julien was now a dandy and understood the art of life in Paris.
He greeted Mademoiselle de La Mole with perfect coolness. He
appeared to remember nothing of the time when she asked him so
gaily to tell her all about his way of falling from his horse.</p>

<p>Mademoiselle de La Mole found him taller and paler. There was no
longer anything provincial about his figure or his attire; not so
with his conversation: this was still perceptibly too serious, too
positive. In spite of these sober qualities, and thanks to his
pride, it conveyed no sense of inferiority; one felt merely that he
still regarded too many things as important. But one saw that he
was a man who would stand by his word.</p>

<p>'He is wanting in lightness of touch, but not in intelligence,'
Mademoiselle de La Mole said to her father, as she teased him over
the Cross he had given Julien. 'My brother has been asking you for
it for the last eighteen months, and he is a La Mole!'</p>

<p>'Yes; but Julien has novelty. That has never been the case with
the La Mole you mention.'</p>

<p>M. le Duc de Retz was announced.</p>

<p>Mathilde felt herself seized by an irresistible desire to yawn;
she recognised the antique decorations and the old frequenters of
the paternal drawing-room. She formed an entirely boring picture of
the life she was going to resume in Paris. And yet at Hyeres she
had longed for Paris.</p>

<p>'To think that I am nineteen!' she reflected: 'it is the age of
happiness, according to all those gilt-edged idiots.' She looked at
nine or ten volumes of recent poetry that had accumulated, during
her absence in Provence, on the drawing-room table. It was her
misfortune to have more intelligence than MM. de Croisenois, de
Caylus, de Luz, and the rest of her friends. She could imagine
everything that they would say to her about the beautiful sky in
Provence, poetry, the south, etc., etc.</p>

<p>Those lovely eyes, in which was revealed the most profound
boredom, and, what was worse still, a despair of finding any
pleasure, came to rest upon Julien. At any rate, he was not exactly
like all the rest.</p>

<p>'Monsieur Sorel,' she said in that short, sharp voice, with
nothing feminine about it, which is used by young women of the
highest rank, 'Monsieur Sorel, are you coming to M. de Retz's ball
tonight?'</p>

<p>'Mademoiselle, I have not had the honour to be presented to M.
le Duc.' (One would have said that these words and the title burned
the lips of the proud provincial.)</p>

<p>'He has asked my brother to bring you; and, if you came, you
could tell me all about Villequier; there is some talk of our going
there in the spring. I should like to know whether the house is
habitable, and if the country round it is as pretty as people say.
There are so many undeserved reputations!'</p>

<p>Julien made no reply.</p>

<p>'Come to the ball with my brother,' she added, in the driest of
tones.</p>

<p>Julien made a respectful bow. 'So, even in the middle of a ball,
I must render accounts to all the members of the family. Am I not
paid to be their man of business?' In his ill humour, he added:
'Heaven only knows whether what I tell the daughter may not upset
the plans of her father, and brother, and mother! It is just like
the court of a Sovereign Prince. One is expected to be a complete
nonentity, and at the same time give no one any grounds for
complaint.</p>

<p>'How I dislike that great girl!' he thought, as he watched
Mademoiselle de La Mole cross the room, her mother having called
her to introduce her to a number of women visitors. 'She overdoes
all the fashions, her gown is falling off her shoulders...she is
even paler than when she went away... What colourless hair, if that
is what they call golden! You would say the light shone through it.
How arrogant her way of bowing, of looking at people! What regal
gestures!'</p>

<p>Mademoiselle de La Mole had called her brother back, as he was
leaving the room.</p>

<p>Comté Norbert came up to Julien:</p>

<p>'My dear Sorel,' he began, 'where would you like me to call for
you at midnight for M. de Retz's ball? He told me particularly to
bring you.'</p>

<p>'I know to whom I am indebted for such kindness,' replied
Julien, bowing to the ground.</p>

<p>His ill humour, having no fault to find with the tone of
politeness, indeed of personal interest, in which Norbert had
addressed him, vented itself upon the reply which he himself had
made to this friendly speech. He detected a trace of servility in
it.</p>

<p>That night, on arriving at the ball, he was struck by the
magnificence of the Hotel de Retz. The courtyard was covered with
an immense crimson awning patterned with golden stars: nothing
could have been more elegant. Beneath this awning, the court was
transformed into a grove of orange trees and oleanders in blossom.
As their tubs had been carefully buried at a sufficient depth,
these oleanders and orange trees seemed to be springing from the
ground. The carriage drive had been sprinkled with sand.</p>

<p>The general effect seemed extraordinary to our provincial. He
had no idea that such magnificence could exist; in an instant his
imagination had taken wings and flown a thousand leagues away from
ill humour. In the carriage, on their way to the ball, Norbert had
been happy, and he had seen everything in dark colours; as soon as
they entered the courtyard their moods were reversed.</p>

<p>Norbert was conscious only of certain details, which, in the
midst of all this magnificence, had been overlooked. He reckoned up
the cost of everything, and as he arrived at a high total, Julien
remarked that he appeared almost jealous of the outlay and began to
sulk.</p>

<p>As for Julien, he arrived spell-bound with admiration, and
almost timid with excess of emotion in the first of the saloons in
which the company were dancing. Everyone was making for the door of
the second room, and the throng was so great that he found it
impossible to move. This great saloon was decorated to represent
the Alhambra of Granada.</p>

<p>'She is the belle of the ball, no doubt about it,' said a young
man with moustaches, whose shoulder dug into Julien's chest.</p>

<p>'Mademoiselle Fourmont, who has been the reigning beauty all
winter,' his companion rejoined, 'sees that she must now take the
second place: look how strangely she is frowning.'</p>

<p>'Indeed she is hoisting all her canvas to attract. Look, look at
that gracious smile as soon as she steps into the middle in that
country dance. It is inimitable, upon my honour.'</p>

<p>'Mademoiselle de La Mole has the air of being in full control of
the pleasure she derives from her triumph, of which she is very
well aware. One would say that she was afraid of attracting whoever
speaks to her.'</p>

<p>'Precisely! That is the art of seduction.'</p>

<p>Julien was making vain efforts to catch a glimpse of this
seductive woman; seven or eight men taller than himself prevented
him from seeing her.</p>

<p>'There is a good deal of coquetry in that noble reserve,' went
on the young man with the moustaches.</p>

<p>'And those big blue eyes which droop so slowly just at the
moment when one would say they were going to give her away,' his
companion added. 'Faith, she's a past master.'</p>

<p>'Look how common the fair Fourmont appears beside her,' said a
third.</p>

<p>'That air of reserve is as much as to say: "How charming I
should make myself to you, if you were the man that was worthy of
me."'</p>

<p>'And who could be worthy of the sublime Mathilde?' said the
first: 'Some reigning Prince, handsome, clever, well made, a hero
in battle, and aged twenty at the most.'</p>

<p>'The natural son of the Emperor of Russia, for whom, on the
occasion of such a marriage, a Kingdom would be created; or simply
the Comté de Thaler, with his air of a peasant in his Sunday
clothes...'</p>

<p>The passage was now cleared, Julien was free to enter.</p>

<p>'Since she appears so remarkable in the eyes of these puppets,
it is worth my while to study her,' he thought. 'I shall understand
what perfection means to these people.'</p>

<p>As he was trying to catch her eye, Mathilde looked at him. 'Duty
calls me,' Julien said to himself, but his resentment was now
confined to his expression. Curiosity made him step forward with a
pleasure which the low cut of the gown on Mathilda's shoulders
rapidly enhanced, in a manner, it must be admitted, by no means
flattering to his self-esteem. 'Her beauty has the charm of youth,'
he thought. Five or six young men, among whom Julien recognised
those whom he had heard talking in the doorway, stood between her
and him.</p>

<p>'You can tell me, Sir, as you have been here all the winter,'
she said to him, 'is it not true that this is the prettiest ball of
the season?' He made no answer.</p>

<p>'This Coulon quadrille seems to me admirable; and the ladies are
dancing it quite perfectly.' The young men turned round to see who
the fortunate person was who was being thus pressed for an answer.
It was not encouraging.</p>

<p>'I should hardly be a good judge, Mademoiselle; I spend my time
writing: this is the first ball on such a scale that I have
seen.'</p>

<p>The moustached young men were shocked.</p>

<p>'You are a sage, Monsieur Sorel,' she went on with a more marked
interest; 'you look upon all these balls, all these parties, like a
philosopher, like a Jean-Jacques Rousseau. These follies surprise
you without tempting you.'</p>

<p>A chance word had stifled Julien's imagination and banished
every illusion from his heart. His lips assumed an expression of
disdain that was perhaps slightly exaggerated.</p>

<p>'Jean-Jacques Rousseau,' he replied, 'is nothing but a fool in
my eyes when he takes it upon himself to criticise society; he did
not understand it, and approached it with the heart of an upstart
flunkey.'</p>

<p>'He wrote the <i>Contrat Social</i>,' said Mathilde in a tone of
veneration.</p>

<p>'For all his preaching a Republic and the overthrow of
monarchical titles, the upstart is mad with joy if a Duke alters
the course of his after-dinner stroll to accompany one of his
friends.'</p>

<p>'Ah, yes! The Due de Luxembourg at Montmorency accompanies a M.
Coindet on the road to Paris,' replied Mademoiselle de La Mole with
the impetuous delight of a first enjoyment of pedantry. She was
overjoyed at her own learning, almost like the Academician who
discovered the existence of King Feretrius. Julien's eye remained
penetrating and stern. Mathilde had felt a momentary enthusiasm;
her partner's coldness disconcerted her profoundly. She was all the
more astonished inasmuch as it was she who was in the habit of
producing this effect upon other people.</p>

<p>At that moment, the Marquis de Croisenois advanced eagerly
towards Mademoiselle de La Mole. He stopped for a moment within a
few feet of her, unable to approach her on account of the crowd. He
looked at her, with a smile at the obstacle. The young Marquise de
Rouvray was close beside him; she was a cousin of Mathilde. She
gave her arm to her husband, who had been married for only a
fortnight. The Marquis de Rouvray, who was quite young also, showed
all that fatuous love which seizes a man, who having made a
'suitable' marriage entirely arranged by the family lawyers, finds
that he has a perfectly charming spouse. M. de Rouvray would be a
Duke on the death of an uncle of advanced years.</p>

<p>While the Marquis de Croisenois, unable to penetrate the throng,
stood gazing at Mathilde with a smiling air, she allowed her large,
sky-blue eyes to rest upon him and his neighbours. 'What could be
duller,' she said to herself, 'than all that group! Look at
Croisenois who hopes to marry me; he is nice and polite, he has
perfect manners like M. de Rouvray. If they did not bore me, these
gentlemen would be quite charming. He, too, will come to balls with
me with that smug, satisfied air. A year after we are married, my
carriage, my horses, my gowns, my country house twenty leagues from
Paris, everything will be as perfect as possible, just what is
needed to make an upstart burst with envy, a Comtésse de Roiville
for instance; and after that?</p>

<p>Mathilde let her mind drift into the future. The Marquis de
Croisenois succeeded in reaching her, and spoke to her, but she
dreamed on without listening. The sound of his voice was lost in
the hubbub of the ball. Her eye mechanically followed Julien, who
had moved away with a respectful, but proud and discontented air.
She saw in a corner, aloof from the moving crowd, Conte Altamira,
who was under sentence of death in his own country, as the reader
already knows. Under Louis XIV, a lady of his family had married a
Prince de Conti; this antecedent protected him to some extent from
the police of the <i>Congregation</i>.</p>

<p>'I can see nothing but a sentence of death that distinguishes a
man,' thought Mathilde: 'it is the only thing that is not to be
bought.</p>

<p>'Ah! There is a witty saying that I have wasted on myself! What
a pity that it did not occur to me when I could have made the most
of it!' Mathilde had too much taste to lead up in conversation to a
witticism prepared beforehand; but she had also too much vanity not
to be delighted with her own wit. An air of happiness succeeded the
appearance of boredom in her face. The Marquis de Croisenois, who
was still addressing her, thought he saw a chance of success, and
doubled his loquacity.</p>

<p>'What fault would anyone have to find with my remark?' Mathilde
asked herself. 'I should answer my critic: "A title of Baron, or
Viscount, that can be bought; a Cross, that is given; my brother
has just had one, what has he ever done? A step in promotion, that
is obtained. Ten years of garrison duty, or a relative as Minister
for War, and one becomes a squadron-commander, like Norbert. A
great fortune! That is still the most difficult thing to securé,
and therefore the most meritorious. Now is not that odd? It is just
the opposite to what all the books say...Well, to securé a fortune,
one marries M. Rothschild's daughter."</p>

<p>'My remark is really subtle. A death sentence is still the only
thing for which no one has ever thought of asking.</p>

<p>'Do you know Conte Altamira?' she asked M. de Croisenois.</p>

<p>She had the air of having come back to earth from so remote an
abstraction, and this question bore so little relation to all that
the poor Marquis had been saying to her for the last five minutes,
that his friendly feelings were somewhat disconcerted. He was,
however, a man of ready wit, and highly esteemed in that
capacity.</p>

<p>'Mathilde is certainly odd,' he thought; 'it is a drawback, but
she gives her husband such a splendid social position! I cannot
think how the Marquis de La Mole manages it; he is on intimate
terms with the best people in every party, he is a man who cannot
fall. Besides, this oddity in Mathilde may pass for genius. Given
noble birth and an ample fortune, genius is not to be laughed at,
and then, what distinction! She has such a command, too, when she
pleases, of that combination of wit, character and aptness, which
makes conversation perfect...' As it is hard to do two things well
at the same time, the Marquis answered Mathilde with a vacant air,
and as though repeating a lesson:</p>

<p>'Who does not know poor Altamira?' and he told her the story of
the absurd, abortive conspiracy.</p>

<p>'Most absurd!' said Mathilde, as though speaking to herself,
'but he has done something. I wish to see a man; bring him to me,'
she said to the Marquis, who was deeply shocked.</p>

<p>Conte Altamira was one of the most openly professed admirers of
the haughty and almost impertinent air of Mademoiselle de La Mole;
she was, according to him, one of the loveliest creatures in
Paris.</p>

<p>'How beautiful she would be on a throne!' he said to M. de
Croisenois, and made no difficulty about allowing himself to be led
to her.</p>

<p>There are not wanting in society people who seek to establish
the principle that nothing is in such bad tone as a conspiracy; it
reeks of Jacobinism. And what can be more vile than an unsuccessful
Jacobin?</p>

<p>Mathilde's glance derided Altamira's Liberalism to M. de
Croisenois, but she listened to him with pleasure.</p>

<p>'A conspirator at a ball, it is a charming contrast,' she
thought. In this conspirator, with his black moustaches, she
detected a resemblance to a lion in repose; but she soon found that
his mind had but one attitude: utility, admiration for utility.</p>

<p>Excepting only what might bring to his country Two Chamber
government, the young Count felt that nothing was worthy of his
attention. He parted from Mathilde, the most attractive person at
the ball, with pleasure because he had seen a Peruvian General
enter the room.</p>

<p>Despairing of Europe, poor Altamira had been reduced to hoping
that, when the States of South America became strong and powerful,
they might restore to Europe the freedom which Mirabeau had sent to
them. [Footnote: This page, written on July 25, 1830, was printed
on August 4. (Publisher's note.) &mdash;<i>Le Rouge et le Noir</i> was
published in 1831. It was an order of July 25, 1830, dissolving the
Chamber, which provoked the Revolution of the following days, the
abdication of Charles X, and the accession of Louis-Phillippe&mdash;C.
K. S. M.]</p>

<p>A swarm of young men with moustaches had gathered round
Mathilde. She had seen quite well that Altamira was not attracted,
and felt piqued by his desertion of her; she saw his dark eye gleam
as he spoke to the Peruvian General. Mademoiselle de La Mole
studied the young Frenchmen with that profound seriousness which
none of her rivals was able to imitate. 'Which of them,' she
thought, 'could ever be sentenced to death, even allowing him the
most favourable conditions?'</p>

<p>This singular gaze flattered those who had little intelligence,
but disturbed the rest. They feared the explosion of some pointed
witticism which it would be difficult to answer.</p>

<p>'Good birth gives a man a hundred qualities the absence of which
would offend me: I see that in Julien's case,' thought Mathilde;
'but it destroys those qualities of the spirit which make people be
sentenced to death.'</p>

<p>At that moment someone remarked in her hearing: 'That Conte
Altamira is the second son of the Principe di San Nazaro-Pimentel;
it was a Pimentel who attempted to save Conradin, beheaded in 1268.
They are one of the noblest families of Naples.'</p>

<p>'There,' Mathilde said to herself, 'is an excellent proof of my
maxim: Good birth destroys the strength of character without which
people do not incur sentences of death. I seem fated to go wrong
this evening. Since I am only a woman like any other, well, I must
dance.' She yielded to the persistence of the Marquis de
Croisenois, who for the last hour had been pleading for a galop. To
distract her thoughts from her philosophical failure, Mathilde
chose to be perfectly bewitching; M. de Croisenois was in
ecstasies.</p>

<p>But not the dance, nor the desire to please one of the
handsomest men at court, nothing could distract Mathilde. She could
not possibly have enjoyed a greater triumph. She was the queen of
the ball, she knew it, but she remained cold.</p>

<p>'What a colourless life I shall lead with a creature like
Croisenois,' she said to herself, as he led her back to her place
an hour later...'What pleasure can there be for me,' she went on
sadly, 'if after an absence of six months, I do not find any in a
ball which is the envy of all the women in Paris? And moreover I am
surrounded by the homage of a society which could not conceivably
be more select. There is no plebeian element here except a few
peers and a Julien or two perhaps. And yet,' she added, with a
growing melancholy, 'what advantages has not fate bestowed on me!
Birth, wealth, youth! Everything, alas, but happiness.</p>

<p>'The most dubious of my advantages are those of which they have
been telling me all evening. Wit, I know I have, for obviously I
frighten them all. If they venture to broach a serious subject,
after five minutes of conversation they all arrive out of breath,
and as though making a great discovery, at something which I have
been repeating to them for the last hour. I am beautiful, I have
that advantage for which Madame de Stael would have sacrificed
everything, and yet the fact remains that I am dying of boredom. Is
there any reason why I should be less bored when I have changed my
name to that of the Marquis de Croisenois?</p>

<p>'But, Lord!' she added, almost in tears, 'is he not a perfect
man? He is the masterpiece of the education of the age; one cannot
look at him without his thinking of something pleasant, and even
clever, to say to one; he is brave...But that Sorel is a strange
fellow,' she said to herself, and the look of gloom in her eye gave
place to a look of anger. 'I told him that I had something to say
to him, and he does not condescend to return!'</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch39" id="ch39"></a>Chapter 39. The Ball</h2>

<p style="margin-left:10%">The splendour of the dresses, the blaze

the perfumes; all those rounded arms, and fine shoulders;<br>
bouquets, the sound of Rossini's music, pictures by Ciceri!<br>

&mdash;<i>Travels of Uzeri</i></p>

<p>'You are feeling cross,' the Marquise de La Mole said to her; 'I
warn you, that is not good manners at a ball.'</p>

<p>'It is only a headache,' replied Mathilde contemptuously, 'it is
too hot in here.'</p>

<p>At that moment, as though to corroborate Mademoiselle de La
Mole, the old Baron de Tolly fainted and fell to the ground; he had
to be carried out. There was talk of apoplexy, it was a
disagreeable incident.</p>

<p>Mathilde did not give it a thought. It was one of her definite
habits never to look at an old man or at anyone known to be given
to talking about sad things.</p>

<p>She danced to escape the conversation about the apoplexy, which
was nothing of the sort, for a day or two later the Baron
reappeared.</p>

<p>'But M. Sorel does not appear,' she said to herself again after
she had finished dancing. She was almost searching for him with her
eyes when she caught sight of him in another room. Strange to say,
he seemed to have shed the tone of impassive coldness which was so
natural to him; he had no longer the air of an Englishman.</p>

<p>'He is talking to Conte Altamira, my condemned man!' Mathilde
said to herself. 'His eye is ablaze with a sombre fire; he has the
air of a Prince in disguise; the arrogance of his gaze has
increased.'</p>

<p>Julien was coming towards the spot where she was, still talking
to Altamira; she looked fixedly at him, studying his features in
search of those lofty qualities which may entitle a man to the
honour of being sentenced to death.</p>

<p>As he passed by her:</p>

<p>'Yes,' he was saying to Conte Altamira, 'Danton was a man!'</p>

<p>'Oh, heavens! Is he to be another Danton,' thought Mathilde;
'but he has such a noble face, and that Danton was so horribly
ugly, a butcher, I fancy.' Julien was still quite near her, she had
no hesitation in calling to him; she was conscious and proud of
asking a question that was extraordinary, coming from a girl.</p>

<p>'Was not Danton a butcher?' she asked him.</p>

<p>'Yes, in the eyes of certain people,' Julien answered her with
an expression of the most ill-concealed scorn, his eye still ablaze
from his conversation with Altamira, 'but unfortunately for people
of birth, he was a lawyer at Mery-sur-Seine; that is to say,
Mademoiselle,' he went on with an air of sarcasm, 'that he began
life like several of the Peers whom I see here this evening. It is
true that Danton had an enormous disadvantage in the eyes of
beauty: he was extremely ugly.'</p>

<p>The last words were uttered rapidly, with an extraordinary and
certainly far from courteous air.</p>

<p>Julien waited for a moment, bowing slightly from the waist and
with an arrogantly humble air. He seemed to be saying: 'I am paid
to answer you, and I live upon my pay.' He did not deign to raise
his eyes to her face. She, with her fine eyes opened
extraordinarily wide and fastened upon him, seemed like his slave.
At length, as the silence continued, he looked at her as a servant
looks at his master, when receiving orders. Although his eyes
looked full into those of Mathilde, still fastened upon him with a
strange gaze, he withdrew with marked alacrity.</p>

<p>'That he, who really is so handsome,' Mathilde said to herself
at length, awakening from her dreams, 'should pay such a tribute to
ugliness! Never a thought of himself! He is not like Caylus or
Croisenois. This Sorel has something of the air my father adopts
when he is playing the Napoleon, at a ball.' She had entirely
forgotten Danton. 'No doubt about it, I am bored this evening.' She
seized her brother by the arm, and, greatly to his disgust, forced
him to take her for a tour of the rooms. The idea occurred to her
of following the condemned man's conversation with Julien.</p>

<p>The crowd was immense. She succeeded, however, in overtaking
them at the moment when, just in front of her, Altamira had stopped
by a tray of ices to help himself. He was talking to Julien, half
turning towards him. He saw an arm in a braided sleeve stretched
out to take an ice from the same tray. The gold lace seemed to
attract his attention; he turned round bodily to see whose this arm
was. Immediately his eyes, so noble and unaffected, assumed a
slight expression of scorn.</p>

<p>'You see that man,' he murmured to Julien; 'he is the Principe
d'Araceli, the &mdash;&mdash; Ambassador. This morning he applied
for my extradition to your French Foreign Minister, M. de Nerval.
Look, there he is over there, playing whist. M. de Nerval is quite
ready to give me up, for we gave you back two or three conspirators
in 1816. If they surrender me to my King I shall be hanged within
twenty-four hours. And it will be one of those pretty gentlemen
with moustaches who will seize me.'</p>

<p>'The wretches!' exclaimed Julien, half aloud.</p>

<p>Mathilde did not lose a syllable of their conversation. Her
boredom had vanished.</p>

<p>'Not such wretches as all that,' replied Conte Altamira. 'I have
spoken to you of myself to impress you with a real instance. Look
at Principe d'Araceli; every five minutes he casts a glance at his
Golden Fleece; he cannot get over the pleasure of seeing that
trinket on his breast. The poor man is really nothing worse than an
anachronism. A hundred years ago, the Golden Fleece was a signal
honour, but then it would have been far above his head. Today,
among people of breeding, one must be an Araceli to be thrilled by
it. He would have hanged a whole town to obtain it.'</p>

<p>'Was that the price he paid for it?' said Julien, with
anxiety.</p>

<p>'Not exactly,' replied Altamira coldly; 'he perhaps had some
thirty wealthy landowners of his country, who were supposed to be
Liberals, flung into the river.'</p>

<p>'What a monster!' said Julien again.</p>

<p>Mademoiselle de La Mole, leaning forward with the keenest
interest, was so close to him that her beautiful hair almost
brushed his shoulder.</p>

<p>'You are very young!' replied Altamira. 'I told you that I have
a married sister in Provence; she is still pretty, good, gentle;
she is an excellent mother, faithful to all her duties, pious
without bigotry.'</p>

<p>'What is he leading up to?' thought Mademoiselle de La Mole.</p>

<p>'She is happy,' Conte Altamira continued; 'she was happy in
1815. At that time I was in hiding there, on her property near
Antibes; well, as soon as she heard of the execution of Marshal
Ney, she began to dance!'</p>

<p>'Is it possible?' said the horrified Julien.</p>

<p>'It is the partisan spirit,' replied Altamira. There are no
longer any genuine passions in the nineteenth century; that is why
people are so bored in France. We commit the greatest cruelties,
but without cruelty.'</p>

<p>'All the worse!' said Julien; 'at least, when we commit crimes,
we should commit them with pleasure: that is the only good thing
about them, and the only excuse that can in any way justify
them.'</p>

<p>Mademoiselle de La Mole, entirely forgetting what she owed to
herself, had placed herself almost bodily between Altamira and
Julien. Her brother, upon whose arm she leaned, being accustomed to
obey her, was looking about the room, and, to hide his lack of
composure, pretending to be held up by the crowd.</p>

<p>'You are right,' said Altamira; 'we do everything without
pleasure and without remembering it afterwards, even our crimes. I
can point out to you at this ball ten men, perhaps, who will be
damned as murderers. They have forgotten it, and the world also.
[Footnote: 'A malcontent is speaking.' (Note by Moliere to
<i>Tartuffe</i>.)]</p>

<p>'Many of them are moved to tears if their dog breaks its paw. At
Père-Lachaise, when people strew flowers on their graves, as you so
charmingly say in Paris, we are told that they combined all the
virtues of the knights of old, and we hear of the great deeds of
their ancestor who lived in the days of Henri IV: If, despite the
good offices of Principe d'Araceli, I am not hanged, and if I ever
come to enjoy my fortune in Paris, I hope to invite you to dine
with nine or ten murderers who are honoured and feel no
remorse.</p>

<p>'You and I, at that dinner, will be the only two whose hands are
free from blood, but I shall be despised and almost hated, as a
bloody and Jacobinical monster, and you will simply be despised as
a plebeian who has thrust his way into good society.'</p>

<p>'Nothing could be more true,' said Mademoiselle de La Mole.</p>

<p>Altamira looked at her in astonishment; Julien did not deign to
look at her.</p>

<p>'Note that the revolution at the head of which I found myself,'
Conte Altamira went on, 'was unsuccessful, solely because I would
not cut off three heads, and distribute among our supporters seven
or eight millions which happened to be in a safe of which I held
the key. My King, who is now burning to have me hanged, and who,
before the revolt, used to address me as <i>tu</i>, would have
given me the Grand Cordon of his Order if I had cut off those three
heads and distributed the money in those safes: for then I should
have scored at least a partial success, and my country would have
had a Charter of sorts...Such is the way of the world, it is a game
of chess.'</p>

<p>'Then,' replied Julien, his eyes ablaze, 'you did not know the
game; now...'</p>

<p>'I should cut off the heads, you mean, and I should not be a
Girondin as you gave me to understand the other day? I will answer
you,' said Altamira sadly, 'when you have killed a man in a duel,
and that is a great deal less unpleasant than having him put to
death by a headsman.'</p>

<p>'Faith!' said Julien, 'the end justifies the means; if, instead
of being a mere atom, I had any power, I would hang three men to
save the lives of four.'</p>

<p>His eyes expressed the fire of conscience and a contempt for the
vain judgments of men; they met those of Mademoiselle de La Mole
who stood close beside him, and this contempt, instead of changing
into an air of gracious civility, seemed to intensify.</p>

<p>It shocked her profoundly; but it no longer lay in her power to
forget Julien; she moved indifferently away, taking her brother
with her.</p>

<p>'I must take some punch, and dance a great deal,' she said to
herself, 'I intend to take the best that is going, and to create an
effect at all costs. Good, here comes that master of impertinence,
the Comté de Fervaques.' She accepted his invitation; they danced.
'It remains to be seen,' she thought, 'which of us will be the more
impertinent, but, to get the full enjoyment out of him, I must make
him talk.' Presently all the rest of the country dance became a
pure formality. No one was willing to miss any of Mathilde's
piquant repartees. M. de Fervaques grew troubled, and, being able
to think of nothing but elegant phrases, in place of ideas, began
to smirk; Mathilde, who was out of temper, treated him cruelly, and
made an enemy of him. She danced until daybreak, and finally went
home horribly tired. But, in the carriage, the little strength that
remained to her was still employed in making her melancholy and
wretched. She had been scorned by Julien, and was unable to scorn
him.</p>

<p>Julien was on a pinnacle of happiness. Carried away
unconsciously by the music, the flowers, the beautiful women, the
general elegance, and, most of all, by his own imagination, which
dreamed of distinctions for himself and of liberty for mankind:</p>

<p>'What a fine ball!' he said to the Conte, 'nothing is
lacking.'</p>

<p>'Thought is lacking,' replied Altamira.</p>

<p>And his features betrayed that contempt which is all the more
striking because one sees that politeness makes it a duty to
conceal it.</p>

<p>'You are here, Monsieur le Comté. Is not that thought, and
actively conspiring, too?'</p>

<p>'I am here because of my name. But they hate thought in your
drawing-rooms. It must never rise above the level of a comic song:
then it is rewarded. But the man who thinks, if he shows energy and
novelty in his sallies, you call a <i>cynic</i>. Is not that the
name that one of your judges bestowed upon Courier? You put him in
prison, and Beranger also. Everything that is of any value among
you, intellectually, the <i>Congregation</i> flings to the criminal
police; and society applauds.</p>

<p>'The truth is that your antiquated society values
conventionality above everything...You will never rise higher than
martial gallantry; you will have Murats, but never a Washington. I
can see nothing in France but vanity. A man who thinks of things as
he speaks may easily say something rash, and his host then imagines
himself insulted.'</p>

<p>At this point, the Conte's carriage, which was taking Julien
home, stopped at the Hotel de La Mole. Julien was in love with his
conspirator. Altamira had paid him a handsome compliment, evidently
springing from a profound conviction: 'You have not the French
frivolity, and you understand the principle of <i>utility</i>.' It
so happened that, only two evenings before, Julien had seen
<i>Marino Faliero</i>, a tragedy by M. Casimir Delavigne.</p>

<p>'Has not Israel Bertuccio more character than all those Venetian
nobles?' our rebellious plebeian asked himself; 'and yet they are
men whose noble descent can be proved as far back as the year 700,
a century before Charlemagne; whereas the bluest blood at M. de
Retz's ball tonight does not go farther back, and that only by a
hop, skip and jump, than the thirteenth century. Very well! Among
those Venetian nobles, so great by birth, it is Israel Bertuccio
that one remembers.</p>

<p>'A conspiracy wipes out all the titles conferred by social
caprice. In those conditions, a man springs at once to the rank
which his manner of facing death assigns to him. The mind itself
loses some of its authority...</p>

<p>'What would Danton be today, in this age of Valenods and Renais?
Not even a Deputy Crown Prosecutor...</p>

<p>'What am I saying? He would have sold himself to the
<i>Congregation</i>: he would be a Minister, for after all the
great Danton did steal. Mirabeau, too, sold himself. Napoleon stole
millions in Italy, otherwise he would have been brought to a
standstill by poverty, like Pichegru. Only La Fayette never stole.
Must one steal, must one sell oneself?' Julien wondered. The
question arrested the flow of his imagination. He spent the rest of
the night reading the history of the Revolution.</p>

<p>Next day, as he copied his letters in the library, he could
still think of nothing but Conte Altamira's conversation.</p>

<p>'It is quite true,' he said to himself, after a long spell of
absorption; 'if those Spanish Liberals had compromised the people
by a few crimes, they would not have been swept away so easily.
They were conceited, chattering boys...like myself!' Julien
suddenly cried, as though awaking with a bound.</p>

<p>'What difficult thing have I ever done that gives me the right
to judge poor devils who, after all, once in their lives, have
dared, have begun to act? I am like a man who, on rising from
table, exclaims: "Tomorrow I shall not dine; that will not prevent
me from feeling strong and brisk as I do today." How can I tell
what people feel in the middle of a great action?...' These lofty
thoughts were interrupted by the sudden arrival of Mademoiselle de
La Mole, who at this moment entered the library. He was so excited
by his admiration for the great qualities of Danton, Mirabeau,
Carnot, who had contrived not to be crushed, that his eyes rested
upon Mademoiselle de La Mole, but without his thinking of her,
without his greeting her, almost without his seeing her. When at
length his great staring eyes became aware of her presence, the
light died out in them. Mademoiselle de La Mole remarked this with
a feeling of bitterness.</p>

<p>In vain did she ask him for a volume of Vely's <i>Histoire de
France</i> which stood on the highest shelf, so that Julien was
obliged to fetch the longer of the two ladders. He brought the
ladder; he found the volume, he handed it to her, still without
being able to think of her. As he carried back the ladder, in his
preoccupation, his elbow struck one of the glass panes protecting
the shelves; the sound of the splinters falling on the floor at
length aroused him. He hastened to make his apology to Mademoiselle
de La Mole; he tried to be polite, but he was nothing more.
Mathilde saw quite plainly that she had disturbed him, that he
would have preferred to dream of what had been occupying his mind
before her entry, rather than to talk to her. After a long glance
at him, she slowly left the room. Julien watched her as she went.
He enjoyed the contrast between the simplicity of the attire she
was now wearing and her sumptuous magnificence overnight. The
difference in her physiognomy was hardly less striking. This girl,
so haughty at the Duc de Retz's ball, had at this moment almost a
suppliant look. 'Really,' Julien told himself, 'that black gown
shows off the beauty of her figure better than anything; but why is
she in mourning?</p>

<p>'If I ask anyone the reason of this mourning, I shall only make
myself appear a fool as usual.' Julien had quite come to earth from
the soaring flight of his enthusiasm. 'I must read over all the
letters I have written today; Heaven knows how many missing words
and blunders I shall find.' As he was reading with forced attention
the first of these letters, he heard close beside him the rustle of
a silken gown; he turned sharply round; Mademoiselle de La Mole was
standing by his table, and smiling. This second interruption made
Julien lose his temper.</p>

<p>As for Mathilde, she had just become vividly aware that she
meant nothing to this young man; her smile was intended to cover
her embarrassment, and proved successful.</p>

<p>'Evidently, you are thinking about something that is extremely
interesting, Monsieur Sorel. Is it by any chance some curious
anecdote of the conspiracy that has sent the Conte Altamira here to
Paris? Tell me what it is? I am burning to know; I shall be
discreet, I swear to you!' This last sentence astonished her as she
uttered it. What, she was pleading with a subordinate! Her
embarrassment grew, she adopted a light manner:</p>

<p>'What can suddenly have turned you, who are ordinarily so cold,
into an inspired creature, a sort of Michelangelo prophet?'</p>

<p>This bold and indiscreet question, cutting Julien to the quick,
revived all his passion.</p>

<p>'Was Danton justified in stealing?' he said to her sharply, and
with an air that grew more and more savage. 'The Revolutionaries of
Piedmont, of Spain, ought they to have compromised the people by
crimes? To have given away, even to men without merit, all the
commands in the army, all the Crosses? Would not the men who wore
those Crosses have had reason to fear a Restoration of their King?
Ought they to have let the Treasury in Turin be pillaged? In a
word, Mademoiselle,' he said, as he came towards her with a
terrible air, 'ought the man who seeks to banish ignorance and
crime from the earth to pass like a whirlwind and do evil as though
blindly?'</p>

<p>Mathilde was afraid, she could not meet his gaze, and recoiled a
little. She looked at him for a moment; then, ashamed of her fear,
with a light step left the library.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch40" id="ch40"></a>Chapter 40. Queen Marguerite</h2>

<p style="margin-left:10%">Love! In what folly do you not contrive
to make us find pleasure?<br>
&mdash;<i>Letters of a Portuguese Nun</i></p>

<p>Julien read over his letters. When the dinner bell sounded: 'How
ridiculous I must have appeared in the eyes of that Parisian doll!'
he said to himself; 'what madness to tell her what was really in my
thoughts! And yet perhaps not so very mad. The truth on this
occasion was worthy of me.</p>

<p>'Why, too, come and cross-examine me on private matters? Her
question was indiscreet. She forgot herself. My thoughts on Danton
form no part of the sacrifice for which her father pays me.'</p>

<p>On reaching the dining-room, Julien was distracted from his ill
humour by Mademoiselle de La Mole's deep mourning, which was all
the more striking since none of the rest of the family was in
black.</p>

<p>After dinner, he found himself entirely recovered from the fit
of enthusiasm which had possessed him all day. Fortunately, the
Academician who knew Latin was present at dinner. There is the man
who will be least contemptuous of me, if, as I suppose, my question
about Mademoiselle de La Mole's mourning should prove a
blunder.'</p>

<p>Mathilde was looking at him with a singular expression. 'There
we have an instance of the coquetry of the women of these parts,
just as Madame de Rênal described it to me,' Julien told himself.
'I was not agreeable to her this morning, I did not yield to her
impulse for conversation. My value has increased in her eyes. No
doubt the devil loses no opportunity there. Later on, her proud
scorn will find out a way of avenging itself. Let her do her worst.
How different from the woman I have lost! What natural charm! What
simplicity! I knew what was in her mind before she did; I could see
her thoughts take shape; I had no competitor, in her heart, but the
fear of losing her children; it was a reasonable and natural
affection, indeed it was pleasant for me who felt the same fear. I
was a fool. The ideas that I had I formed of Paris prevented me
from appreciating that sublime woman.</p>

<p>'What a difference, great God! And what do I find here? A sere
and haughty vanity, all the refinements of self-esteem and nothing
more.'</p>

<p>The party left the table. 'I must not let my Academician be
intercepted,' said Julien. He went up to him as they were moving
into the garden, assumed a meek, submissive air, and sympathised
with his rage at the success of <i>Hernani</i>.</p>

<p>'If only we lived in the days of <i>lettres de cachet</i>!' he
said.</p>

<p>'Ah, then he would never have dared,' cried the Academician,
with a gesture worthy of Talma.</p>

<p>In speaking of a flower, Julien quoted a line or two from
Virgil's <i>Georgics</i>, and decided that nothing came up to the
poetry of the abbe Delille. In short, he flattered the Academician
in every possible way. After which, with an air of the utmost
indifference: 'I suppose,' he said to him, 'that Mademoiselle de La
Mole has received a legacy from some uncle for whom she is in
mourning.'</p>

<p>'What! You live in the house,' said the Academician, coming to a
standstill, 'and you don't know her mania? Indeed, it is strange
that her mother allows such things; but, between you and me, it is
not exactly by strength of character that they shine in this
family. Mademoiselle Mathilde has enough for them all, and leads
them by the nose. Today is the 30th of April!' and the Academician
broke off, looking at Julien, with an air of connivance. Julien
smiled as intelligently as he was able.</p>

<p>'What connection can there be between leading a whole household
by the nose, wearing black and the 30th of April?' he asked
himself. 'I must be even stupider than I thought.</p>

<p>'I must confess to you,' he said to the Academician, and his eye
continued the question.</p>

<p>'Let us take a turn in the garden,' said the Academician,
delighted to see this chance of delivering a long and formal
speech. 'What! Is it really possible that you do not know what
happened on the 30th of April, 1574?'</p>

<p>'Where?' asked Julien, in surprise.</p>

<p>'On the Place de Greve.'</p>

<p>Julien was so surprised that this name did not enlighten him.
His curiosity, the prospect of a tragic interest, so attuned to his
nature, gave him those sparkling eyes which a story-teller so loves
to see in his audience. The Academician, delighted to find a virgin
ear, related at full length to Julien how, on the 30th of April,
1574, the handsomest young man of his age, Boniface de La Mole, and
Annibal de Coconasso, a Piedmontese gentleman, his friend, had been
beheaded on the Place de Greve. 'La Mole was the adored lover of
Queen Marguerite of Navarre; and observe,' the Academician added,
'that Mademoiselle de La Mole is named Mathilde-Marguerite. La Mole
was at the same time the favourite of the Duc d'Alencon and an
intimate friend of the King of Navarre, afterwards Henri IV, the
husband of his mistress. On Shrove Tuesday in this year, 1574, the
Court happened to be at Saint-Germain, with the unfortunate King
Charles IX, who was on his deathbed. La Mole wished to carry off
the Princes, his friends, whom Queen Catherine de' Medici was
keeping as prisoners with the Court. He brought up two hundred
horsemen under the walls of Saint-Germain, the Due d'Alencon took
fright, and La Mole was sent to the scaffold.</p>

<p>'But what appeals to Mademoiselle Mathilde, as she told me
herself, seven or eight years ago, when she was only twelve, for
she has a head, such a head!...' and the Academician raised his
eyes to heaven. 'What impresses her in this political catastrophe
is that Queen Marguerite of Navarre, who had waited concealed in a
house on the Place de Greve, made bold to ask the executioner for
her lover's head. And the following night, at midnight, she took
the head in her carriage, and went to bury it with her own hands in
a chapel which stood at the foot of the hill of Montmartre.'</p>

<p>'Is it possible?' exclaimed Julien, deeply touched.</p>

<p>'Mademoiselle Mathilde despises her brother because, as you see,
he thinks nothing of all this ancient history, and never goes into
mourning on the 30th of April. It is since this famous execution,
and to recall the intimate friendship between La Mole and
Coconasso, which Coconasso, being as he was an Italian, was named
Annibal, that all the men of this family have borne that name.
And,' the Academician went on, lowering his voice, 'this Coconasso
was, on the authority of Charles IX, himself, one of the bloodiest
assassins on the 24th of August, 1572.. But how is it possible, my
dear Sorel, that you are ignorant of these matters, you, who are an
inmate of the house?'</p>

<p>'Then that is why twice, during the dinner, Mademoiselle de La
Mole addressed her brother as Annibal. I thought I had not heard
aright.'</p>

<p>'It was a reproach. It is strange that the Marquise permits such
folly ... That great girl's husband will see some fine doings!'</p>

<p>This expression was followed by five or six satirical phrases.
The joy at thus revealing an intimate secret that shone in the
Academician's eyes shocked Julien. 'What are we but a pair of
servants engaged in slandering our employers?' he thought. 'But
nothing ought to surprise me that is done by this academic
gentleman.'</p>

<p>One day Julien had caught him on his knees before the Marquise
de La Mole; he was begging her for a tobacco licence for a nephew
in the country. That night, he gathered from a little maid of
Mademoiselle de La Mole, who was making love to him, as Elisa had
done in the past, that her mistress's mourning was by no means put
on to attract attention. This eccentricity was an intimate part of
her nature. She really loved this La Mole, the favoured lover of
the most brilliant Queen of her age, who had died for having sought
to set his friends at liberty. And what friends! The First Prince
of the Blood and Henri IV.</p>

<p>Accustomed to the perfect naturalness that shone through the
whole of Madame de Rênal's conduct, Julien saw nothing but
affectation in all the women of Paris, and even without feeling
disposed to melancholy, could think of nothing to say to them.
Mademoiselle de La Mole was the exception.</p>

<p>He began no longer to mistake for hardness of heart the kind of
beauty that goes with nobility of bearing. He had long
conversations with Mademoiselle de La Mole, who would stroll with
him in the garden sometimes after dinner, past the open windows of
the drawing-room. She told him one day that she was reading
d'Aubigne's <i>History</i>, and Brantome. 'A strange choice,'
thought Julien, 'and the Marquise does not allow her to read the
novels of Walter Scott!'</p>

<p>One day she related to him, with that glow of pleasure in her
eyes which proves the sincerity of the speaker's admiration, the
feat of a young woman in the reign of Henri in, which she had just
discovered in the <i>Memoires</i> by l'Etoile: finding that her
husband was unfaithful, she had stabbed him.</p>

<p>Julien's self-esteem was flattered. A person surrounded by such
deference, one who, according to the Academician, was the leader of
the household, deigned to address him in a tone which might almost
be regarded as friendly. 'I was mistaken,' was his next thought;
'this is not familiarity, I am only the listener to a tragic story,
it is the need to speak. I am regarded as learned by this family. I
shall go and read Brantome, d'Aubigne, l'Etoile. I shall be able to
challenge some of the anecdotes which Mademoiselle de La Mole cites
to me. I must emerge from this part of a passive listener.'</p>

<p>In course of time his conversations with this girl, whose manner
was at once so imposing and so easy, became more interesting. He
forgot his melancholy role as a plebeian in revolt. He found her
learned and indeed rational. Her opinions in the garden differed
widely from those which she maintained in the drawing-room. At
times she displayed with him an enthusiasm and a frankness which
formed a perfect contrast with her normal manner, so haughty and
cold.</p>

<p>'The Wars of the League are the heroic age of France,' she said
to him one day, her eyes aflame with intellect and enthusiasm.
'Then everyone fought to securé a definite object which he desired
in order to make his party triumph, and not merely to win a stupid
Cross as in the days of your Emperor. You must agree that there was
less egoism and pettiness. I love that period.'</p>

<p>'And Boniface de La Mole was its hero,' he said to her.</p>

<p>'At any rate he was loved as it is perhaps pleasant to be loved.
What woman alive today would not be horrified to touch the head of
her decapitated lover?'</p>

<p>Madame de La Mole called her daughter indoors. Hypocrisy, to be
effective, must be concealed; and Julien, as we see, had taken
Mademoiselle de La Mole partly into his confidence as to his
admiration for Napoleon.</p>

<p>'That is the immense advantage which they have over us,' he said
to himself, when left alone in the garden. 'The history of their
ancestors raises them above vulgar sentiments, and they have not
always to be thinking of their daily bread! What a wretched state
of things!' he added bitterly. 'I am not worthy to discuss these
serious matters. My life is nothing more than a sequence of
hypocrisies, because I have not an income of a thousand francs with
which to buy my bread.'</p>

<p>'What are you dreaming of, Sir?' Mathilde asked him, running
back outdoors.</p>

<p>Julien was tired of despising himself. In a moment of pride, he
told her frankly what he was thinking. He blushed deeply when
speaking of his poverty to a person who was so rich. He sought to
make it quite clear by his proud tone that he asked for nothing.
Never had he seemed so handsome to Mathilde; she found in him an
expression of sensibility and frankness which he often lacked.</p>

<p>Less than a month later, Julien was strolling pensively in the
garden of the Hotel de La Mole; but his features no longer showed
the harshness, as of a surly philosopher, which the constant sense
of his own inferiority impressed on them. He had just come from the
door of the drawing-room to which he had escorted Mademoiselle de
La Mole, who pretended that she had hurt her foot when running with
her brother.</p>

<p>'She leaned upon my arm in the strangest fashion!' Julien said
to himself. 'Am I a fool, or can it be true that she has a liking
for me? She listens to me so meekly even when I confess to her all
the sufferings of my pride! She, who is so haughty with everyone
else! They would be greatly surprised in the drawing-room if they
saw her looking like that. There is no doubt about it, she never
assumes that meek, friendly air with anyone but myself.'</p>

<p>Julien tried not to exaggerate this singular friendship. He
compared it himself to an armed neutrality. Day by day, when they
met, before resuming the almost intimate tone of the day before,
they almost asked themselves: 'Are we friends today, or enemies?'
Julien had realised that, were he once to allow himself to be
insulted with impunity by this haughty girl, all was lost. 'If I
must quarrel, is it not to my advantage to do so from the first, in
defending the lawful rights of my pride, rather than in repelling
the marks of contempt that must quickly follow the slightest
surrender of what I owe to my personal dignity?'</p>

<p>Several times, on days of mutual discord, Mathilde tried to
adopt with him the tone of a great lady; she employed a rare skill
in these attempts, but Julien repulsed them rudely.</p>

<p>One day he interrupted her suddenly: 'Has Mademoiselle de La
Mole some order to give to her father's secretary?' he asked her;
'he is obliged to listen to her orders and to carry them out with
respect; but apart from that, he has not one word to say to her. He
certainly is not paid to communicate his thoughts to her.'</p>

<p>This state of affairs, and the singular doubts which Julien felt
banished the boredom which he found regularly in that drawing-room,
in which, for all its magnificence, people were afraid of
everything, and it was not thought proper to treat any subject
lightly.</p>

<p>'It would be amusing if she loved me! Whether she loves me or
not,' Julien went on, 'I have as my intimate confidant an
intelligent girl, before whom I see the whole household tremble,
and most of all the Marquis de Croisenois. That young man who is so
polished, so gentle, so brave, who combines in his own person all
the advantages of birth and fortune, any one of which would set my
heart so at ease! He is madly in love with her, he is going to
marry her. Think of all the letters M. de La Mole has made me write
to the two lawyers arranging the contract! And I who see myself so
subordinate, pen in hand, two hours later, here in the garden, I
triumph over so attractive a young man: for after all, her
preference is striking, direct. Perhaps, too, she hates the idea of
him as a future husband. She is proud enough for that. And the
favour she shows me, I obtain on the footing of a confidential
servant!</p>

<p>'But no, either I am mad, or she is making love to me; the more
I show myself cold and respectful towards her, the more she seeks
me out. That might be deliberate, an affectation; but I see her
eyes become animated when I appear unexpectedly. Are the women of
Paris capable of pretending to such an extent? What does it matter!
I have appearances on my side, let us make the most of them. My
God, how handsome she is! How I admire her great blue eyes, seen at
close range, and looking at me as they often do! What a difference
between this spring and the last, when I was living in misery,
keeping myself alive by my strength of character, surrounded by
those three hundred dirty and evil-minded hypocrites! I was almost
as evil as they.'</p>

<p>In moments of depression: That girl is making a fool of me,'
Julien would think. 'She is plotting with her brother to mystify
me. But she seems so to despise her brother's want of energy! He is
brave, and there is no more to be said, she tells me. He has not an
idea which ventures to depart from the fashion. It is always I who
am obliged to take up her defence. A girl of nineteen! At that age
can a girl be faithful at every moment of the day to the code of
hypocrisy that she has laid down for herself?</p>

<p>'On the other hand, when Mademoiselle de La Mole fastens her
great blue eyes on me with a certain strange expression, Comté
Norbert always moves away. That seems to me suspicious; ought he
not to be annoyed at his sister's singling out a <i>domestic</i> of
their household? For I have heard the Duc de Chaulnes use that term
of me.' At this memory anger obliterated every other feeling. 'Is
it only the love of old-fashioned speech in that ducal maniac?</p>

<p>'Anyhow, she is pretty!' Julien went on, with the glare of a
tiger. 'I will have her, I shall then depart and woe to him that
impedes me in my flight!'</p>

<p>This plan became Julien's sole occupation; he could no longer
give a thought to anything else. His days passed like hours. At all
hours of the day, when he sought to occupy his mind with some
serious business, his thoughts would abandon everything, and he
would come to himself a quarter of an hour later, his heart
throbbing, his head confused, and dreaming of this one idea: 'Does
she love me?'</p>

Girl</h2>

<p style="margin-left:10%">I admire her beauty, but I fear her
intelligence.<br>
&mdash;MERIMEE</p>

<p>Had Julien devoted to the consideration of what went on in the
drawing-room the time which he spent in exaggerating Mathilde's
beauty, or in lashing himself into a fury at the aloofness natural
to her family, whom she was forgetting in his company, he would
have understood in what her despotic power over everyone round
about her consisted. Whenever anyone earned Mademoiselle de La
Mole's displeasure, she knew how to punish him by a witticism so
calculated, so well chosen, apparently so harmless, so aptly
launched, that the wound it left deepened the more he thought of
it. In time she became deadly to wounded vanity. As she attached no
importance to many things that were the object of serious ambition
with the rest of her family, she always appeared cool in their
eyes. The drawing-rooms of the nobility are pleasant things to
mention after one has left them, but that is all; bare politeness
is something in itself only for the first few days. Julien
experienced this; after the first enchantment, the first
bewilderment. 'Politeness,' he said to himself, 'is nothing more
than the absence of the irritation which would come from bad
manners.' Mathilde was frequently bored, perhaps she would have
been bored in any circumstances. At such times to sharpen the point
of an epigram was for her a distraction and a real pleasure.</p>

<p>It was perhaps in order to have victims slightly more amusing
than her distinguished relatives, the Academician and the five or
six other inferiors who formed their court, that she had given
grounds for hope to the Marquis de Croisenois, the Comté de Caylus
and two or three other young men of the highest distinction. They
were nothing more to her than fresh subjects for epigram.</p>

<p>We confess with sorrow, for we are fond of Mathilde, that she
had received letters from several of their number, and had
occasionally answered them. We hasten to add that this character in
our story forms an exception to the habits of the age. It is not,
generally speaking, with want of prudence that one can reproach the
pupils of the noble Convent of the Sacre-Coeur.</p>

<p>One day the Marquis de Croisenois returned to Mathilde a
distinctly compromising letter which she had written him the day
before. He thought that by this sign of extreme prudence he was
greatly strengthening his position. But imprudence was what
Mathilde enjoyed in her correspondence. It was her chief pleasure
to play with fire. She did not speak to him again for six
weeks.</p>

<p>She amused herself with the letters of these young men; but,
according to her, they were all alike. It was always the most
profound, the most melancholy passion.</p>

<p>'They are all the same perfect gentlemen, ready to set off for
Palestine,' she said to her cousin. 'Can you think of anything more
insipid? Think that this is the sort of letter that I am going to
receive for the rest of my life! These letters can only change
every twenty years, according to the kind of occupation that is in
fashion. They must have been less colourless in the days of the
Empire. Then all these young men in society had seen or performed
actions in which there was real greatness. The Due de
N&mdash;&mdash;, my uncle, fought at Wagram.'</p>

<p>'What intelligence is required to wield a sabre? And when that
has happened to them, they talk about it so often!' said
Mademoiselle de Sainte-Heredite, Mathilde's cousin.</p>

<p>'Oh, well, those stories amuse me. To have been in a real
battle, one of Napoleon's battles, in which ten thousand soldiers
were killed, is a proof of courage. Exposing oneself to danger
elevates the soul, and saves it from the boredom in which all my
poor adorers seem to be plunged; and it is contagious, that
boredom. Which of them ever dreams of doing anything out of the
common? They seek to win my hand, a fine enterprise! I am rich, and
my father will help on his son-in-law. Oh, if only he could find
one who was at all amusing!'</p>

<p>Mathilde's vivid, picturesque point of view affected her speech,
as we can see. Often something she said jarred on the refined
nerves of her highly polished friends. They would almost have
admitted, had she been less in the fashion, that there was
something in her language a little too highly coloured for feminine
delicacy.</p>

<p>She, on her part, was most unjust to the handsome men on
horseback who throng the Bois de Boulogne. She looked towards the
future, not with terror, that would have been too strong a feeling,
but with a disgust very rare at her age.</p>

<p>What had she left to desire? Fortune, noble birth, wit, beauty,
or so it was said, and she believed, all had been heaped upon her
by the hand of chance.</p>

<p>Such were the thoughts of the most envied heiress of the
Faubourg Saint-Germain, when she began to find pleasure in
strolling with Julien. She was amazed at his pride; she admired the
cunning of this little plebeian. 'He will manage to get himself
made a Bishop like the abbe Maury,' she said to herself.</p>

<p>Presently the sincere and unfeigned resistance, with which our
hero received a number of her ideas, began to occupy her mind; she
thought about him; she reported to her cousin the pettiest details
of their conversations, and found that she could never succeed in
displaying them in every aspect.</p>

<p>Suddenly an idea dawned upon her: 'I have the good fortune to be
in love,' she told herself one day, with an indescribable transport
of joy. 'I am in love, I am in love, it is quite clear! At my age,
a young girl, beautiful, clever, where can she find sensations, if
not in love? I may do what I like, I shall never feel any love for
Croisenois, Caylus, <i>e tutti quanti</i>. They are perfect, too
perfect perhaps; in short, they bore me.'</p>

<p>She turned over in her mind all the descriptions of passion
which she had read in <i>Manon Lescaut</i>, the <i>Nouvelle
Heloise</i>, the <i>Letters of a Portuguese Nun</i>, and so forth.
There was no question, of course, of anything but a grand passion;
mere fleeting affection was unworthy of a girl of her age and
birth. She bestowed the name of love only upon that heroic
sentiment which was to be found in France in the days of Henri IV
and Bassompierre. That love never basely succumbed to obstacles;
far from it, it caused great deeds to be done. 'What a misfortune
for me that there is not a real Court like that of Catherine de'
Medici or Louis XIII! I feel that I am equal to everything that is
most daring and great. What should I not do with a King who was a
man of feeling, like Louis XII, sighing at my feet! I should lead
him to the Vendee, as Baron de Tolly is always saying, and from
there he would reconquer his Kingdom; then no more talk of a
Charter... and Julien would aid me. What is it that he lacks? A
name and a fortune. He would make a name for himself, he would
acquire a fortune.</p>

<p>'The Marquis de Croisenois lacks nothing, and all his life long
he will be merely a Duke, half Ultra, half Liberal, an undecided
creature always holding back from extremes, and consequently
finding himself everywhere in the second rank.</p>

<p>'Where is the great action which is not an extreme at the moment
in which one undertakes it? It is when it is accomplished that it
seems possible to creatures of common clay. Yes, it is love with
all its miracles that is going to reign in my heart; I feel it by
the fire that is animating me. Heaven owed me this favour. Not in
vain will it have heaped every advantage upon a single head. My
happiness will be worthy of myself. Each of my days will not coldly
resemble the day before. There is already something grand and
audacious in daring to love a man placed so far beneath me in
social position. Let me see: will he continue to deserve me? At the
first sign of weakness that I observe in him, I abandon him. A girl
of my birth, and with the chivalrous character which they are so
kind as to attribute to me' (this was one of her father's sayings)
'ought not to behave like a fool.</p>

<p>'Is not that the part that I should be playing if I loved the
Marquis de Croisenois? It would be simply a repetition of the
happiness of my cousins, whom I despise so utterly. I know
beforehand everything that the poor Marquis would say to me, all
that I should have to say to him in reply. What is the use of a
love that makes one yawn? One might as well take to religion. I
should have a scene at the signing of my marriage contract like my
youngest cousin, with the noble relatives shedding tears, provided
they were not made angry by a final condition inserted in the
contract the day before by the solicitor to the other party.'</p>

<h2><a name="ch42" id="ch42"></a>Chapter 42. Another Danton</h2>

<p style="margin-left:10%">The need for anxiety explains the
character of the beautiful<br>
Marguerite de Valois, my aunt, who soon afterwards married<br>
the King of Navarre, whom we now see on the throne of France<br>
under the name of Henri IV. The need to gamble was the key<br>
to the character of this delightful princess; hence the<br>
quarrels and the reconciliations with her brothers from<br>
the age of sixteen onwards. And what does a young girl gamble<br>
with? The most precious thing she has: her reputation, the<br>
possibility of esteem for her entire life.<br>
&mdash;<i>Memoirs of the Due d'Angouleme</i>, natural son of Charles
IX</p>

<p>'With Julien and me there is no contract to be signed, no
lawyer; everything is heroic, everything will be left to chance.
But for nobility, which he lacks, it is the love of Marguerite de
Valois for young La Mole, the most distinguished man of his time.
Is it my fault if the young men at Court are such ardent devotees
of the Conventions, and turn pale at the mere thought of any
adventure that is slightly out of the common? A little expedition
to Greece or Africa is to them the height of audacity, and even
then they can only go in a troop. As soon as they find themselves
alone, they become afraid, not of Bedouin spears, but of ridicule,
and that drives them mad.</p>

<p>'My little Julien, on the contrary, will only act alone. Never,
in that privileged being, is there the slightest thought of seeking
the approval and support of others! He despises other people, that
is why I do not despise him.</p>

<p>'If, with his poverty, Julien had been noble, my love would be
nothing more than a piece of vulgar folly, an unfortunate marriage;
I should not object to that; it would lack that element which
characterises great passion: the immensity of the difficulty to be
overcome and the black uncertainty of events.'</p>

<p>Mademoiselle de La Mole was so absorbed in these fine
speculations that next day, quite unintentionally, she sang
Julien's praises to the Marquis de Croisenois and her brother. Her
eloquence went so far that they became annoyed.</p>

<p>'Beware of that young man, who has so much energy,' her brother
cried; 'if the Revolution begins again, he will have us all
guillotined.'</p>

<p>She made no answer, and hastened to tease her brother and the
Marquis de Croisenois over the fear that energy inspired in them.
It was nothing more, really, than the fear of meeting something
unexpected, the fear of being brought up short in the presence of
the unexpected...</p>

<p>'Still, gentlemen, still the fear of ridicule, a monster which,
unfortunately, died in 1816.'</p>

<p>'There can be no more ridicule,' M. de La Mole used to say, 'in
a country where there are two Parties.'</p>

<p>His daughter had assimilated this idea.</p>

<p>'And so, gentlemen,' she told Julien's enemies, 'you will be
haunted by fear all your lives, and afterwards people will say of
you:</p>

<p>'"It was not a wolf, it was only a shadow."'</p>

<p>Mathilde soon left them. Her brother's remark filled her with
horror; it greatly disturbed her; but after sleeping on it, she
interpreted it as the highest possible praise.</p>

<p>'In this age, when all energy is dead, his energy makes them
afraid. I shall tell him what my brother said. I wish to see what
answer he will make. But I shall choose a moment when his eyes are
glowing. Then he cannot lie to me.</p>

<p>'Another Danton?' she went on after a long, vague spell of
musing. 'Very well! Let us suppose that the Revolution has begun.
What parts would Croisenois and my brother play? It is all
prescribed for them: sublime resignation. They would be heroic
sheep, allowing their throats to be cut without a word. Their sole
fear when dying would still be of committing a breach of taste. My
little Julien would blow out the brains of the Jacobin who came to
arrest him, if he had the slightest hope of escaping. He, at least,
has no fear of bad taste.'</p>

<p>These last words made her pensive again; they revived painful
memories, and destroyed all her courage. They reminded her of the
witticisms of MM. de Caylus, de Croisenois, de Luz, and her
brother. These gentlemen were unanimous in accusing Julien of a
<i>priestly</i> air, humble and hypocritical.</p>

<p>'But,' she went on, suddenly, her eye sparkling with joy, 'by
the bitterness and the frequency of their sarcasms, they prove, in
spite of themselves, that he is the most distinguished man that we
have seen this winter. What do his faults, his absurdities matter?
He has greatness, and they are shocked by it, they who in other
respects are so kind and indulgent. He knows well that he is poor,
and that he has studied to become a priest; they are squadron
commanders, and have no need of study; it is a more comfortable
life.</p>

<p>'In spite of all the drawbacks of his eternal black coat, and of
that priestly face, which he is obliged to assume, poor boy, if he
is not to die of hunger, his merit alarms them, nothing could be
clearer. And that priestly expression, he no longer wears it when
we have been for a few moments by ourselves. Besides, when these
gentlemen say anything which they consider clever and startling, is
not their first glance always at Julien? I have noticed that
distinctly. And yet they know quite well that he never speaks to
them, unless he is asked a question. It is only myself that he
addresses. He thinks that I have a lofty nature. He replies to
their objections only so far as politeness requires. He becomes
respectful at once. With me, he will discuss things for hours on
end, he is not sure of his own ideas if I offer the slightest
objection. After all, all this winter we have not heard a shot
fired; the only possible way to attract attention has been by one's
talk. Well, my father, a superior man, and one who will greatly
advance the fortunes of our family, respects Julien. All the rest
hate him, no one despises him, except my mother's religious
friends.'</p>

<p>The Comté de Caylus had or pretended to have a great passion for
horses; he spent all his time in his stables, and often took his
luncheon there. This great passion, combined with his habit of
never laughing, had won him a great esteem among his friends: he
was the 'strong man' of their little circle.</p>

<p>As soon as it had assembled next day behind Madame de La Mole's
armchair, Julien not being present, M. de Caylus, supported by
Croisenois and Norbert, launched a violent attack upon the good
opinion Mathilde had of Julien, without any reason and almost as
soon as he saw Mademoiselle de La Mole. She detected this stratagem
a mile off, and was charmed by it.</p>

<p>'There they are all in league,' she said to herself, 'against a
man who has not ten louis to his name, and can answer them only
when he is questioned. They are afraid of him in his black coat.
What would he be with epaulettes?'</p>

<p>Never had she been so brilliant. At the first onslaught, she
covered Caylus and his allies with witty sarcasm. When the fire of
these brilliant officers' pleasantries was extinguished:</p>

<p>'Tomorrow some country squire from the mountains of the
Franche-Comté,' she said to M. de Caylus, 'has only to discover
that Julien is his natural son, and give him a name and a few
thousand francs, and in six weeks he will have grown moustaches
like yourselves, gentlemen; in six months he will be an officer of
hussars like yourselves, gentlemen. And then the greatness of his
character will no longer be a joke. I can see you reduced, My Lord
Duke-to-be, to that old and worthless plea: the superiority of the
nobility of the Court to the provincial nobility. But what defence
have you left if I choose to take an extreme case, if I am so
unkind as to make Julien's father a Spanish Duke, a prisoner of war
at Besançon in Napoleon's time, who, from a scruple of conscience,
acknowledges him on his deathbed?'</p>

<p>All these assumptions of a birth out of wedlock were regarded by
MM. de Caylus and de Croisenois as in distinctly bad taste. This
was all that they saw in Mathilde's argument.</p>

<p>Obedient as Norbert was, his sister's meaning was so
unmistakable that he assumed an air of gravity, little in keeping,
it must be confessed, with his genial, smiling features. He
ventured to say a few words:</p>

<p>'Are you unwell, dear?' Mathilde answered him with a
mock-serious expression. 'You must be feeling very ill to reply to
a joke with a sermon.</p>

<p>'A sermon, from you! Are you thinking of asking to be made a
Prefect?'</p>

<p>Mathilde very soon forgot the annoyance of the Comté de Caylus,
Norbert's ill humour and the silent despair of M. de Croisenois.
She had to make up her mind over a desperate idea which had taken
possession of her.</p>

<p>'Julien is quite sincere with me,' she told herself; 'at his
age, in an inferior state of fortune, wretched as an astounding
ambition makes him, he needs a woman friend. I can be that friend;
but I see no sign in him of love. With the audacity of his nature,
he would have spoken to me of his love.'</p>

<p>This uncertainty, this inward discussion, which, from now
onwards, occupied every moment of Mathilde's life, and in support
of which, whenever Julien addressed her, she found fresh arguments,
completely banished those periods of depression to which she was so
liable.</p>

<p>The daughter of a man of intelligence who might become a
Minister, and restore their forests to the Clergy, Mademoiselle de
La Mole had been, in the Convent of the Sacre-Coeur, the object of
the most extravagant flatteries. The harm done in this way can
never be effaced. They had persuaded her that, in view of all her
advantages of birth, fortune, etc., she ought to be happier than
other girls. This is the source of the boredom from which princes
suffer, and of all their follies.</p>

<p>Mathilde had not been immune to the fatal influence of this
idea. However intelligent a girl may be, she cannot be on her guard
for ten years against the flattery of an entire convent, especially
when it appears to be so well founded.</p>

<p>&gt;From the moment in which she decided that she was in love
with Julien, she was no longer bored. Every day she congratulated
herself on the decision she had made to indulge in a grand passion.
'This amusement has its dangers,' she thought. 'All the better! A
thousand times better!</p>

<p>'Without a grand passion, I was languishing with boredom at the
best moment in a girl's life, between sixteen and twenty. I have
already wasted my best years; with no pleasure but to listen to the
nonsense talked by my mother's friends, who at Coblenz, in 1792,
were not quite, one gathers, so strict in their conduct, as they
are today in speech.'</p>

<p>It was while Mathilde was still devoured by this great
uncertainty that Julien was unable to understand the gaze which she
kept fastened upon him. He did indeed find an increased coldness in
Comté Herbert's manner, and a stiffening of pride in that of MM. de
Caylus, de Luz and de Croisenois. He was used to it. This
discomfiture befell him at times after an evening in which he had
shone more brightly than befitted his position. But for the special
welcome which Mathilde extended to him, and the curiosity which the
whole scene inspired in him, he would have refrained from following
into the garden these brilliant young men with the moustaches, when
after dinner they escorted Mademoiselle de La Mole.</p>

<p>'Yes, I cannot possibly blind myself to the fact,' thought
Julien, 'Mademoiselle de La Mole keeps looking at me in a strange
fashion. But, even when her beautiful blue eyes seem to gaze at me
with least restraint, I can always read in them a cold, malevolent
scrutiny. Is it possible that this is love? How different from the
look in Madame de Rênal's eyes.'</p>

<p>One evening after dinner, Julien, who had gone with M. de La
Mole to his study, came rapidly out to the garden. As he walked
boldly up to the group round Mathilde, he overheard a few words
uttered in a loud voice. She was teasing her brother. Julien heard
his own name uttered distinctly twice. He appeared; a profound
silence at once fell, and vain efforts were made to break it.
Mademoiselle de La Mole and her brother were too much excited to
think of another topic of conversation. MM. de Caylus, de
Croisenois, de Luz and another of their friends met Julien with an
icy coldness. He withdrew.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch43" id="ch43"></a>Chapter 43. A Plot</h2>

<p style="margin-left:10%">Disconnected remarks, chance meetings
turn into proofs<br>
of the utmost clarity in the eyes of the imaginative man,<br>
if he has any fire in his heart.<br>
&mdash;SCHILLER</p>

<p>On the following day he again surprised Norbert and his sister,
who were talking about him. On his arrival, a deathly silence fell,
as on the day before. His suspicions knew no bounds. 'Can these
charming young people be planning to make a fool of me? I must own,
that is far more probable, far more natural than a pretended
passion on the part of Mademoiselle de La Mole, for a poor devil of
a secretary. For one thing, do these people have passions?
Mystification is their specialty. They are jealous of my wretched
little superiority in language. Being jealous, that is another of
their weaknesses. That explains everything. Mademoiselle de La Mole
hopes to persuade me that she is singling me out, simply to offer
me as a spectacle to her intended.'</p>

<p>This cruel suspicion completely changed Julien's moral attitude.
The idea encountered in his heart a germ of love which it had no
difficulty in destroying. This love was founded only upon
Mathilde's rare beauty, or rather upon her regal manner and her
admirable style in dress. In this respect Julien was still an
upstart. A beautiful woman of fashion is, we are assured, the sight
that most astonishes a clever man of peasant origin when he arrives
amid the higher ranks of society. It was certainly not Mathilde's
character that had set Julien dreaming for days past. He had enough
sense to grasp that he knew nothing about her character. Everything
that he saw of it might be only a pretence.</p>

<p>For instance, Mathilde would not for anything in the world have
failed to hear mass on a Sunday; almost every day she went to
church with her mother. If, in the drawing-room of the Hotel de La
Mole, some impudent fellow forgot where he was and allowed himself
to make the remotest allusion to some jest aimed at the real or
supposed interests of Throne or Altar, Mathilde would at once
assume an icy severity. Her glance, which was so sparkling, took on
all the expressionless pride of an old family portrait.</p>

<p>But Julien knew for certain that she always had in her room one
or two of the most philosophical works of Voltaire. He himself
frequently abstracted a volume or two of the handsome edition so
magnificently bound. By slightly separating the other volumes on
the shelf, he concealed the absence of the volume he was taking
away; but soon he discovered that someone else was reading
Voltaire. He had recourse to a trick of the Seminary, he placed
some little pieces of horsehair across the volumes which he
supposed might interest Mademoiselle de La Mole. They vanished for
weeks at a time.</p>

<p>M. de La Mole, losing patience with his bookseller, who kept
sending him all the sham <i>Memoirs</i>, gave Julien orders to buy
every new book that was at all sensational. But, so that the poison
might not spread through the household, the secretary was
instructed to place these books in a little bookcase that stood in
the Marquis's own room. He soon acquired the certainty that if any
of these books were hostile to the interests of Throne and Altar,
they were not long in vanishing. It was certainly not Norbert that
was reading them.</p>

<p>Julien, exaggerating the importance of this discovery, credited
Mademoiselle de La Mole with a Machiavellian duplicity. This
feigned criminality wa a charm in his eyes, almost the only moral
charm that she possessed. The tediousness of hypocrisy and virtuous
conversation drove him to this excess.</p>

<p>He excited his imagination rather than let himself be carried
away by love.</p>

<p>It was after he had lost himself in dreams of the elegance of
Mademoiselle de La Mole's figure, the excellent taste of her
toilet, the whiteness of her hand, the beauty of her arm, the
<i>disinvoltura</i> of all her movements, that he found himself in
love. Then, to complete her charm, he imagined her to be a
Catherine de' Medici. Nothing was too profound or too criminal for
the character that he assigned to her. It was the ideal of the
Maslons, the Frilairs and Castanedes whom he had admired in his
younger days. It was, in short, the ideal, to him, of Paris.</p>

<p>Was ever anything so absurd as to imagine profundity or
criminality in the Parisian character?</p>

<p>'It is possible that this trio may be making a fool of me,' he
thought. The reader has learned very little of Julien's nature if
he has not already seen the sombre, frigid expression that he
assumed when his eyes met those of Mathilde. A bitter irony
repulsed the assurances of friendship with which Mademoiselle de La
Mole in astonishment ventured on two or three occasions, to try
him.</p>

<p>Piqued by his sudden eccentricity, the heart of this girl,
naturally cold, bored, responsive to intelligence, became as
passionate as it was in her nature to be. But there was also a
great deal of pride in Mathilde's nature, and the birth of a
sentiment which made all her happiness dependent upon another was
attended by a sombre melancholy.</p>

<p>Julien had made sufficient progress since his arrival in Paris
to discern that this was not the barren melancholy of boredom.
Instead of being eager, as in the past, for parties, shows and
distractions of every kind, she avoided them.</p>

<p>Music performed by French singers bored Mathilde to death, and
yet Julien, who made it his duty to be present at the close of the
Opera, observed that she made her friends take her there as often
as possible. He thought he could detect that she had lost a little
of the perfect balance which shone in all her actions. She would
sometimes reply to her friends with witticisms that were offensive
in their pointed emphasis. It seemed to him that she had taken a
dislike to the Marquis de Croisenois. 'That young man must have a
furious passion for money, not to go off and leave a girl like
that, however rich she may be!' thought Julien. As for himself,
indignant at the insults offered to masculine dignity, his coldness
towards her increased. Often he went the length of replying with
positive discourtesy.</p>

<p>However determined he might be not to be taken in by the signs
of interest shown by Mathilde, they were so evident on certain
days, and Julien, from whose eyes the scales were beginning to
fall, found her so attractive, that he was at times embarrassed by
them.</p>

<p>'The skill and forbearance of these young men of fashion will
end by triumphing over my want of experience,' he told himself; 'I
must go away, and put an end to all this.' The Marquis had recently
entrusted to him the management of a number of small properties and
houses which he owned in lower Languedoc. A visit to the place
became necessary: M. de La Mole gave a reluctant consent. Except in
matters of high ambition, Julien had become his second self.</p>

<p>'When all is said and done, they have not managed to catch me,'
Julien told himself as he prepared for his departure. 'Whether the
jokes which Mademoiselle de La Mole makes at the expense of these
gentlemen be real, or only intended to inspire me with confidence,
I have been amused by them.</p>

<p>'If there is no conspiracy against the carpenter's son,
Mademoiselle de La Mole is inexplicable, but she is just as much so
to the Marquis de Croisenois as to me. Yesterday, for instance, her
ill humour was quite genuine, and I had the pleasure of seeing
discomfited in my favour a young man as noble and rich as I am
penniless and plebeian. That is my finest triumph. It will keep me
in good spirits in my post-chaise, as I scour the plains of
Languedoc.'</p>

<p>He had kept his departure secret, but Mathilde knew better than
he that he was leaving Paris next day, and for a long time. She
pleaded a splitting headache, which was made worse by the close
atmosphere of the drawing-room. She walked for hours in the garden,
and so pursued with her mordant pleasantries Norbert, the Marquis
de Croisenois, Caylus, de Luz and various other young men who had
dined at the Hotel de La Mole, that she forced them to take their
leave. She looked at Julien in a strange fashion.</p>

<p>'This look is perhaps a piece of play-acting,' thought he; 'but
her quick breathing, all that emotion! Bah!' he said to himself,
'who am I to judge of these matters? This is an example of the most
consummate, the most artificial behaviour to be found among the
women of Paris. That quick breathing, which so nearly proved too
much for me, she will have learned from Leontine Fay, whom she
admires so.'</p>

<p>They were now left alone; the conversation was plainly
languishing. 'No! Julien has no feeling for me,' Mathilde told
herself with genuine distress.</p>

<p>As he took leave of her, she clutched his arm violently:</p>

<p>'You will receive a letter from me this evening,' she told him
in a voice so strained as to be barely audible.</p>

<p>This had an immediate effect on Julien.</p>

<p>'My father,' she went on, 'has a most natural regard for the
services that you render him. You <i>must not</i> go tomorrow; find
some excuse.' And she ran from the garden.</p>

<p>Her figure was charming. It would have been impossible to have a
prettier foot, she ran with a grace that enchanted Julien; but
guess what was his second thought when she had quite vanished. He
was offended by the tone of command in which she had uttered the
words, <i>you must</i>. Similarly Louis XV, as he breathed his
last, was keenly annoyed by the words <i>you must</i> awkwardly
employed by his Chief Physician, and yet Louis XV was no
upstart.</p>

<p>An hour later, a footman handed Julien a letter; it was nothing
less than a declaration of love.</p>

<p>'The style is not unduly affected,' he said to himself, seeking
by literary observations to contain the joy that was contorting his
features and forcing him to laugh in spite of himself.</p>

<p>'And so I,' he suddenly exclaimed, his excitement being too
strong to be held in check, 'I, a poor peasant, have received a
declaration of love from a great lady!</p>

<p>'As for myself, I have not done badly,' he went on, controlling
his joy as far as was possible. 'I have succeeded in preserving the
dignity of my character. I have never said that I was in love.' He
began to study the shapes of her letters; Mademoiselle de La Mole
wrote in a charming little English hand. He required some physical
occupation to take his mind from a joy which was bordering on
delirium.</p>

<p>'Your departure obliges me to speak...It would be beyond my
endurance not to see you any more.'</p>

<p>A sudden thought occurred to strike Julien as a discovery,
interrupt the examination that he was making of Mathilde's letter,
and intensify his joy. 'I am preferred to the Marquis de
Croisenois,' he cried, 'I, who never say anything that is not
serious! And he is so handsome! He wears moustaches, a charming
uniform; he always manages to say, just at the right moment,
something witty and clever.'</p>

<p>It was an exquisite moment for Julien; he roamed about the
garden, mad with happiness.</p>

<p>Later, he went upstairs to his office, and sent in his name to
the Marquis de La Mole, who fortunately had not gone out. He had no
difficulty in proving to him, by showing him various marked papers
that had arrived from Normandy, that the requirements of his
employer's lawsuits there obliged him to postpone his departure for
Languedoc.</p>

<p>'I am very glad you are not going,' the Marquis said to him,
when they had finished their business, '<i>I like to see you</i>.'
Julien left the room; this speech disturbed him.</p>

<p>'And I am going to seduce his daughter! To render impossible,
perhaps, that marriage with the Marquis de Croisenois, which is the
bright spot in his future: if he is not made Duke, at least his
daughter will be entitled to a <i>tabouret</i>.' Julien thought of
starting for Languedoc in spite of Mathilde's letter, in spite of
the explanation he had given the Marquis. This virtuous impulse
soon faded.</p>

<p>'How generous I am,' he said to himself; 'I, a plebeian, to feel
pity for a family of such high rank! I, whom the Duc de Chaulnes
calls a domestic! How does the Marquis increase his vast fortune?
By selling national securities, when he hears at the Chateau that
there is to be the threat of a <i>Coup d' Etat</i> next day. And I,
cast down to the humblest rank by a stepmotherly Providence, I,
whom Providence has endowed with a noble heart and not a thousand
francs of income, that is to say not enough for my daily bread,
<i>literally speaking, not enough for my daily bread</i>: am I to
refuse a pleasure that is offered me? A limpid spring which wells
up to quench my thirst in the burning desert of mediocrity over
which I trace my painful course! Faith, I am no such fool; everyone
for himself in this desert of selfishness which is called
life.'</p>

<p>And he reminded himself of several disdainful glances aimed at
him by Madame de La Mole, and especially by the <i>ladies</i>, her
friends.</p>

<p>The pleasure of triumphing over the Marquis de Croisenois
completed the rout of this lingering trace of virtue.</p>

<p>'How I should love to make him angry!' said Julien; 'with what
assurance would I now thrust at him with my sword.' And he struck a
sweeping blow at the air. 'Until now, I was a smug, basely
profiting by a trace of courage. After this letter, I am his
equal.</p>

<p>'Yes,' he said to himself with an infinite delight, dwelling on
the words, 'our merits, the Marquis's and mine, have been weighed,
and the poor carpenter from the Jura wins the day.</p>

<p>'Good!' he cried, 'here is the signature to my reply ready
found. Do not go and imagine, Mademoiselle de La Mole, that I am
forgetting my station. I shall make you realise and feel that it is
for the son of a carpenter that you are betraying a descendant of
the famous Guy de Croisenois, who followed Saint Louis on his
Crusade.'</p>

<p>Julien was unable to contain his joy. He was obliged to go down
to the garden. His room, in which he had locked himself up, seemed
too confined a space for him to breathe in.</p>

<p>'I, a poor peasant from the Jura,' he kept on repeating, 'I, I
condemned always to wear this dismal black coat! Alas, twenty years
ago, I should have worn uniform like them! In those days a man of
my sort was either killed, or <i>a General at six and thirty</i>.'
The letter, which he kept tightly clasped in his hand, gave him the
bearing and pose of a hero. 'Nowadays, it is true, with the said
black coat, at the age of forty, a man has emoluments of one
hundred thousand francs and the Blue Riband, like the Bishop of
Beauvais.</p>

<p>'Oh, well!' he said to himself, laughing like Mephistopheles, 'I
have more sense than they; I know how to choose the uniform of my
generation.' And he felt an intensification of his ambition and of
his attachment to the clerical habit. 'How many Cardinals have
there been of humbler birth than mine, who have risen to positions
of government! My fellow-countryman Granvelle, for instance.'
[Trans. Footnote: Antoine de Granvelle, born at Besançon in 1517,
was Minister to Charles V and Philip II and Governor of the
Netherlands. C. K. S. M.]</p>

<p>Gradually Julien's agitation subsided; prudence rose to the
surface. He said to himself, like his master Tartuffe, whose part
he knew by heart:</p>

<p>'I might suppose these words an honest artifice...Nay,<br>
I shall not believe so flattering a speech<br>
Unless some favour shown by her for whom I sigh<br>
Assure me that they mean all that they might imply.'<br>
&mdash;(<i>Tartuffe</i>, Act IV, Scene V)</p>

<p>'Tartuffe also was ruined by a woman, and he was as good a man
as most...My answer may be shewn...a mishap for which we find this
remedy,' he went on, pronouncing each word slowly, and in accents
of restrained ferocity, 'we begin it by quoting the strongest
expressions from the letter of the sublime Mathilde.</p>

<p>'Yes, but then four of M. de Croisenois's flunkeys will spring
upon me, and tear the original from me.</p>

<p>'No, for I am well armed, and am accustomed, as they know, to
firing on flunkeys.</p>

<p>'Very well! Say, one of them has some courage; he springs upon
me. He has been promised a hundred napoleons. I kill or injure him,
all the better, that is what they want. I am flung into prison with
all the forms of law; I appear in the police court, and they send
me, with all justice and equity on the judges' part, to keep MM.
Fontan and Magalon company at Poissy. There, I lie upon straw with
four hundred poor wretches, pell-mell...And I am to feel some pity
for these people,' he cried, springing impetuously to his feet.
'What pity do they show for the Third Estate when they have us in
their power?' These words were the dying breath of his gratitude to
M. de La Mole which, in spite of himself, had tormented him until
then.</p>

<p>'Not so fast, my fine gentlemen, I understand this little stroke
of Machiavellianism; the abbe Maslon or M. Castanede of the
Seminary could not have been more clever. You rob me of my
incitement, the letter, and I become the second volume of Colonel
Caron at Colmar.</p>

<p>'One moment, gentlemen, I am going to send the fatal letter in a
carefully sealed packet to the custody of M. l'abbe Pirard. He is
an honest man, a Jansenist, and as such out of reach of the
temptations of the Budget. Yes, but he opens letters...it is to
Fouque that I must send this one.'</p>

<p>It must be admitted the glare in Julien's eyes was ghastly, his
expression hideous; it was eloquent of unmitigated crime. He was an
unhappy man at war with the whole of society.</p>

<p>'<i>To arms</i>!' cried Julien. And he sprang with one bound
down the steps that led from the house. He entered the
letter-writer's booth at the street corner; the man was alarmed.
'Copy this,' said Julien, giving him Mademoiselle de La Mole's
letter.</p>

<p>While the writer was thus engaged, he himself wrote to Fouque;
he begged him to keep for him a precious article. 'But,' he said to
himself, laying down his pen, 'the secret room in the post office
will open my letter, and give you back the one you seek; no,
gentlemen.' He went and bought an enormous Bible from a Protestant
bookseller, skilfully concealed Mathilde's letter in the boards,
had it packed up with his own letter, and his parcel went off by
the mail, addressed to one of Fouque's workmen, whose name was
unknown to anybody in Paris.</p>

<p>This done, he returned joyful and brisk to the Hotel de La Mole.
'It is our turn, now,' he exclaimed, as he locked himself into his
room, and flung off his coat:</p>

<p>'What, Mademoiselle,' he wrote to Mathilde, 'it is Mademoiselle
de La Mole who, by the hand of Arsene, her father's servant,
transmits a letter couched in too seductive terms to a poor
carpenter from the Jura, doubtless to play a trick upon his
simplicity...' And he transcribed the most unequivocal sentences
from the letter he had received.</p>

<p>His own would have done credit to the diplomatic prudence of M.
le Chevalier de Beauvoisis. It was still only ten o'clock; Julien,
intoxicated with happiness and with the sense of his own power, so
novel to a poor devil like himself, went off to the Italian opera.
He heard his friend Geronimo sing. Never had music raised him to so
high a pitch. He was a god. [Author's Footnote: Esprit per, pre.
gui II. A. 30. (Note by Stendhal.)]</p>

<h2><a name="ch44" id="ch44"></a>Chapter 44. A Girl's Thoughts</h2>

<p style="margin-left:10%">So much perplexity? So many sleepless
nights!<br>
Good God! Am I making myself despicable? He will<br>
despise me himself. But he's leaving, he's going.<br>
&mdash;ALFRED DE MUSSET</p>

<p>It was not without an inward struggle that Mathilde had brought
herself to write. Whatever might have been the beginning of her
interest in Julien, it soon overcame the pride which, ever since
she had been aware of herself, had reigned alone in her heart. That
cold and haughty spirit was carried away for the first time by a
passionate sentiment. But if this overcame her pride, it was still
faithful to the habits bred of pride. Two months of struggle and of
novel sensations had so to speak altered her whole moral
nature.</p>

<p>Mathilde thought she had happiness in sight. This prospect,
irresistible to a courageous spirit combined with a superior
intellect, had to make a long fight against dignity and every
sentiment of common duty. One day she entered her mother's room, at
seven o'clock in the morning, begging her for leave to retire to
Villequier. The Marquise did not even deign to answer her, and
recommended her to go back to her bed. This was the last effort
made by plain sense and the deference paid to accepted ideas.</p>

<p>The fear of wrongdoing and of shocking the ideas held as sacred
by the Caylus, the de Luz, the Croisenois, had little or no hold
over her; such creatures as they did not seem to her to be made to
understand her; she would have consulted them had it been a
question of buying a carriage or an estate. Her real terror was
that Julien might be displeased with her.</p>

<p>'Perhaps, too, he has only the outward appearance of a superior
person.'</p>

<p>She abhorred want of character, it was her sole objection to the
handsome young men among whom she lived. The more gracefully they
mocked at everything which departed from the fashion, or which
followed it wrongly when intending to follow it, the more they
condemned themselves in her eyes.</p>

<p>They were brave, and that was all. 'And besides, how are they
brave?' she asked herself: 'in a duel. But the duel is nothing more
now than a formality. Everything is known beforehand, even what a
man is to say when he falls. Lying on the grass, his hand on his
heart, he must extend a handsome pardon to his adversary and leave
a message for a fair one who is often imaginary, or who goes to a
ball on the day of his death, for fear of arousing suspicion.</p>

<p>'A man will face danger at the head of a squadron all glittering
with steel, but a danger that is solitary, strange, sudden, truly
ugly?</p>

<p>'Alas!' said Mathilde, 'it was at the Court of Henri in that one
found men great by character as well as by birth! Ah, if Julien had
served at Jarnac or at Moncontour, I should no longer be in doubt.
In those days of strength and prowess, Frenchmen were not mere
dolls. The day of battle was almost the day of least
perplexity.</p>

<p>'Their life was not imprisoned like an Egyptian mummy, within an
envelope always common to them all, always the same. Yes,' she went
on, 'there was more true courage in crossing the town alone at
eleven o'clock at night, after leaving the Hotel de Soissons,
occupied by Catherine de' Medici, than there is today in dashing to
Algiers. A man's life was a succession of hazards. Nowadays
civilisation has banished hazard, there is no room for the
unexpected. If it appears in our ideas, there are not epigrams
enough to cope with it; if it appears in events, no act of
cowardice is too great for our fear. Whatever folly our fear makes
us commit is excused us. Degenerate and boring age! What would
Boniface de La Mole have said if, raising his severed head from the
tomb, he had seen, in 1793, seventeen of his descendants allow
themselves to be penned like sheep, to be guillotined a day or two
later? Their death was certain, but it would have been in bad form
to defend themselves and at least kill a Jacobin or two. Ah! In the
heroic age of France, in the days of Boniface de La Mole, Julien
would have been the squadron commander, and my brother the young
priest, properly behaved, with wisdom in his eyes and reason on his
lips.'</p>

<p>A few months since, Mathilde had despaired of meeting anyone a
little different from the common pattern. She had found a certain
happiness in allowing herself to write to various young men of
fashion. This act of boldness, so unconventional, so imprudent in a
young girl, might dishonour her in the eyes of M. de Croisenois, of
his father, the Duc de Chaulnes, and of the whole house of
Chaulnes, who, seeing the projected marriage broken off, would wish
to know the reason. At that time, on the night after she had
written one of these letters, Mathilde was unable to sleep. But
these letters were mere replies.</p>

<p>Now she had ventured to say that she was in love. She had
written <i>first</i> (what a terrible word!) to a man in the lowest
rank of society.</p>

<p>This circumstance assured her, in the event of discovery,
eternal disgrace. Which of the women who came to see her mother
would dare to take her part? What polite expression could be put
into their mouths to lessen the shock of the fearful contempt of
the drawing-rooms?</p>

<p>And even to speak to a man was fearful, but to write! 'There are
things which one does not write,' Napoleon exclaimed when he heard
of the surrender of Baylen. And it was Julien who had told her of
this saying! As though teaching her a lesson in advance.</p>

<p>But all this was still nothing, Mathilde's anguish had other
causes. Oblivious of the horrible effect upon society, of the
ineradicable blot, the universal contempt, for she was outraging
her caste, Mathilde was writing to a person of a very different
nature from the Croisenois, the de Luz, the Caylus.</p>

<p>The depth, the <i>strangeness</i> of Julien's character had
alarmed her, even when she was forming an ordinary relation with
him. And she was going to make him her lover, possibly her
master!</p>

<p>'What claims will he not assert, if ever he is in a position to
do as he likes with me? Very well! I shall say to myself like
Medea: "<i>Midst all these perils, I have still MYSELF</i>."'</p>

<p>Julien had no reverence for nobility of blood, she understood.
Worse, still, perhaps, he felt no love for her!</p>

<p>In these final moments of tormenting doubts, she was visited by
ideas of feminine pride. 'Everything ought to be strange in the lot
of a girl like myself,' cried Mathilde, with impatience. And so the
pride that had been inculcated in her from her cradle began to
fight against her virtue. It was at this point that Julien's
threatened departure came to precipitate events.</p>

<p>(Such characters are fortunately quite rare.)</p>

<p>Late that night, Julien was malicious enough to have an
extremely heavy trunk carried down to the porter's lodge; to carry
it, he summoned the footman who was courting Mademoiselle de La
Mole's maid. 'This device may lead to no result,' he said to
himself, 'but if it proves successful, she will think that I have
gone.' He went to sleep, highly delighted with his trick. Mathilde
never closed an eye.</p>

<p>Next morning, at a very early hour, Julien left the house
unobserved, but returned before eight o'clock.</p>

<p>No sooner was he in the library than Mademoiselle de La Mole
appeared on the threshold. He handed her his answer. He thought
that it was incumbent upon him to speak to her; this, at least, was
the most polite course, but Mademoiselle de La Mole would not
listen to him and vanished. Julien was overjoyed, he had not known
what to say to her.</p>

<p>'If all this is not a trick arranged with Comté Norbert, plainly
it must have been my frigid glance that has kindled the freakish
love which this girl of noble birth has taken it into her head to
feel for me. I should be a little too much of a fool if I ever
allowed myself to be drawn into feeling any attraction towards the
great flaxen doll.' This piece of reasoning left him more cold and
calculating than he had ever been.</p>

<p>'In the battle that is preparing,' he went on, 'pride of birth
will be like a high hill, forming a military position between her
and myself. It is there that we must manoeuvre. I have done wrong
to remain in Paris; this postponement of my departure cheapens me,
and exposes my flank if all this is only a game. What danger was
there in my going? I was fooling them, if they are fooling me. If
her interest in me has any reality, I was increasing that interest
an hundredfold.'</p>

<p>Mademoiselle de La Mole's letter had so flattered Julien's
vanity that, while he laughed at what was happening to him, he had
forgotten to think seriously of the advantages of departure.</p>

<p>It was a weakness of his character to be extremely sensitive to
his own faults. He was extremely annoyed at this instance of his
weakness, and had almost ceased to think of the incredible victory
which had preceded this slight check when, about nine o'clock,
Mademoiselle de La Mole appeared on the threshold of the library,
flung him a letter, and fled.</p>

<p>'It appears that this is to be a romance told in letters,' he
said, as he picked this one up. 'The enemy makes a false move, now
I am going to bring coldness and virtue into play.'</p>

<p>The letter called for a definite answer with an arrogance which
increased his inward gaiety. He gave himself the pleasure of
mystifying, for the space of two pages, the people who might wish
to make a fool of him, and it was with a fresh pleasantry that he
announced, towards the end of his reply, his decision to depart on
the following morning.</p>

<p>This letter finished: 'The garden can serve me as a post
office,' he thought, and made his way there. He looked up at the
window of Mademoiselle de La Mole's room.</p>

<p>It was on the first floor, next to her mother's apartment, but
there was a spacious mezzanine beneath.</p>

<p>This first floor stood so high, that, as he advanced beneath the
lime-alley, letter in hand, Julien could not be seen from
Mademoiselle de La Mole's window. The vault formed by the limes,
which were admirably pleached, intercepted the view.</p>

<p>'But what is this!' Julien said to himself, angrily, 'another
imprudence! If they have decided to make a fool of me, to let
myself be seen with a letter in my hand, is to play the enemy's
game.'</p>

<p>Norbert's room was immediately above his sister's, and if Julien
emerged from the alley formed by the pleached branches of the
limes, the Count and his friends would be able to follow his every
movement.</p>

<p>Mademoiselle de La Mole appeared behind her closed window; he
half showed her his letter; she bowed her head. At once Julien ran
up to his own room, and happened to meet, on the main staircase,
the fair Mathilde, who snatched the letter with perfect composure
and laughing eyes.</p>

<p>'What passion there was in the eyes of that poor Madame de
Rênal,' Julien said to himself, 'when, even after six months of
intimate relations, she ventured to receive a letter from me! Never
once, I am sure, did she look at me with a laugh in her eyes.'</p>

<p>He did not express to himself so clearly the rest of his
comment; was he ashamed of the futility of his motives? 'But also
what a difference,' his thoughts added, 'in the elegance of her
morning gown, in the elegance of her whole appearance! On catching
sight of Mademoiselle de La Mole thirty yards off, a man of taste
could tell the rank that she occupies in society. That is what one
may call an explicit merit.'</p>

<p>Still playing with his theme, Julien did not yet confess to
himself the whole of his thoughts; Madame de Rênal had had no
Marquis de Croisenois to sacrifice to him. He had had as a rival
only that ignoble Sub-Prefect M. Charcot, who had assumed the name
of Maugiron, because the Maugirons were extinct.</p>

<p>At five o'clock, Julien received a third letter; it was flung at
him from the library door. Mademoiselle de La Mole again fled.
'What a mania for writing,' he said to himself with a laugh, 'when
it is so easy for us to talk! The enemy wishes to have my letters,
that is clear, and plenty of them!' He was in no haste to open this
last. 'More elegant phrases,' he thought; but he turned pale as he
read it. It consisted of eight lines only.</p>

<p>'I have to speak to you: I must speak to you, tonight; when one
o'clock strikes, be in the garden. Take the gardener's long ladder
from beside the well; place it against my window and come up to my
room. There is a moon: no matter.'</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch45" id="ch45"></a>Chapter 45. Is it a Plot?</h2>

<p style="margin-left:10%">Ah! How cruel is the interval between
the conception of a<br>
great project and its execution! What vain terrors! What<br>
irresolutions! Life is at stake. Far more than life&mdash;honour!<br>
&mdash;SCHILLER</p>

<p>'This is becoming serious,' thought Julien...'and a little too
obvious,' he added, after a moment's reflection. 'Why! This pretty
young beauty can speak to me in the library with a freedom which,
thank heaven, is unrestricted; the Marquis, for fear of my
bothering him with accounts, never comes there. Why! M. de La Mole
and Comté Norbert, the only people who ever show their faces here,
are absent almost all day; it is easy to watch for the moment of
their return to the house, and the sublime Mathilde, for whose hand
a Sovereign Prince would not be too noble, wishes me to commit an
act of abominable imprudence!</p>

<p>'It is clear, they wish to ruin me, or to make a fool of me, at
least. First of all, they sought to ruin me by my letters; these
proved cautious; very well, now they require an action that shall
be as clear as daylight. These pretty little gentlemen think me too
simple or too conceited. The devil! With the brightest moon you
ever saw, to climb up by a ladder to a first floor, five and twenty
feet from the ground! They will have plenty of time to see me, even
from the neighbouring houses. I shall be a fine sight on my
ladder!' Julien went up to his room and began to pack his trunk,
whistling as he did so. He had made up his mind to go, and not even
to answer the letter.</p>

<p>But this sage resolution gave him no peace of heart. 'If, by any
chance,' he said to himself, suddenly, his trunk packed and shut,
'Mathilde were sincere! Then I shall be cutting in her eyes the
most perfect figure of a coward. I have no birth, so I require
great qualities, ready on demand, with no flattering suppositions,
qualities proved by eloquent deeds...'</p>

<p>He spent a quarter of an hour pacing the floor of his room.
'What use in denying it?' he asked himself, at length; 'I shall be
a coward in her eyes. I lose not only the most brilliant young
person in high society, as everyone was saying at M. le Duc de
Retz's ball, but, furthermore, the heavenly pleasure of seeing her
throw over for me the Marquis de Croisenois, the son of a Duke, and
a future Duke himself. A charming young man who has all the
qualities that I lack: a ready wit, birth, fortune...</p>

<p>'This remorse will pursue me all my life, not for her, there are
heaps of mistresses, "but only one honour", as old Don Diego says,
and here I am clearly and plainly recoiling from the first peril
that comes my way; for that duel with M. de Beauvoisis was a mere
joke. This is quite different. I may be shot point-blank by a
servant, but that is the least danger; I may forfeit my honour.</p>

<p>'This is becoming serious, my boy,' he went on, with a Gascon
gaiety and accent. '<i>Honur</i> is at stake. A poor devil kept
down by fate in my lowly station will never find such an
opportunity again; I shall have adventures, but tawdry ones...'</p>

<p>He reflected at length, he paced the room with a hurried step,
stopping short now and again. There stood in his room a magnificent
bust in marble of Cardinal Richelieu, which persistently caught his
eye. This bust appeared to be gazing at him sternly, as though
reproaching him for the want of that audacity which ought to be so
natural to the French character. 'In thy time, great man, should I
have hesitated?</p>

<p>'At the worst,' Julien told himself finally, 'let us suppose
that all this is a plot, it is a very dark one, and highly
compromising for a young girl. They know that I am not the man to
keep silent. They will therefore have to kill me. That was all very
well in 1574, in the days of Boniface de La Mole, but the La Mole
of today would never dare. These people are not the same now.
Mademoiselle de La Mole is so envied! Four hundred drawing-rooms
would echo with her disgrace next day, and with what rejoicing!</p>

<p>'The servants chatter among themselves of the marked preference
that is shown me; I know it, I have heard them...</p>

<p>'On the other hand, her letters!...They may suppose that I have
them on me. They surprise me in her room, and take them from me. I
shall have two, three, four, any number of men to deal with. But
these men, where will they collect them? Where is one to find
discreet agents in Paris? They are afraid of the law...Gad! It will
be the Caylus and Croisenois and de Luz themselves. The thought of
that moment, and the foolish figure I shall cut there among them
will be what has tempted them. Beware the fate of Abelard, Master
Secretary!</p>

<p>'Begad, then, gentlemen, you shall bear the mark of my fists, I
shall strike at your faces, like Caesar's soldiers at
Pharsalia...As for the letters, I can put them in a safe
place.'</p>

<p>Julien made copies of the two last, concealed them in a volume
of the fine Voltaire from the library, and went himself with the
originals to the post.</p>

<p>When he returned: 'Into what madness am I rushing!' he said to
himself with surprise and terror. He had been a quarter of an hour
without considering his action of the coming night in all its
aspects.</p>

<p>'But, if I refuse, I must despise myself ever afterwards. All my
life long, that action will be a matter for doubt to me, and such a
doubt is the most bitter agony. Have I not felt it over Amanda's
lover? I believe that I should find it easier to forgive myself
what was clearly a crime; once I had confessed it, I should cease
to think about it.</p>

<p>'What! I shall have been the rival of a man bearing one of the
best names in France, and I myself, with a light heart, am to
declare myself his inferior! Indeed, there is a strain of cowardice
in not going. That word settles everything,' cried Julien,
springing to his feet...'besides, she is a real beauty!</p>

<p>'If this is not treachery, how foolishly she is behaving for
me!...If it is a mystification, begad, gentlemen, it rests with me
to turn the jest to earnest, and so I shall.</p>

<p>'But if they pinion my arms, the moment I enter the room; they
may have set some diabolical machine there ready for me!</p>

<p>'It is like a duel,' he told himself with a laugh, 'there is a
parry for every thrust, my fencing master says, but the Almighty,
who likes things to end, makes one of the fighters forget to parry.
Anyhow, here is what will answer them'; he drew his pocket pistols;
and, albeit they were fully charged, renewed the primings.</p>

<p>There were still many hours to wait; in order to have something
to do, Julien wrote to Fouque: 'My friend, open the enclosed letter
only in case of accident, if you hear it said that something
strange has befallen me. Then, erase the proper names from the
manuscript that I am sending you, and make eight copies of it which
you will send to the newspapers of Marseilles, Bordeaux, Lyons,
Brussels, etc.; ten days later, have the manuscript printed, send
the first copy to M. le Marquis de La Mole, and a fortnight after
that, scatter the other copies by night about the streets of
Verrières.'</p>

<p>This brief exonerating memoir, arranged in the form of a tale,
which Fouque was to open only in case of accident, Julien made as
little compromising as possible to Mademoiselle de La Mole, but,
nevertheless, it described his position very accurately.</p>

<p>He had just sealed his packet when the dinner-bell rang; it made
his heart beat violently. His imagination, preoccupied with the
narrative which he had just composed, was a prey to all sorts of
tragic presentiment. He had seen himself seized by servants,
garrotted, carried down to a cellar with a gag in his mouth. There,
one of them kept a close watch over him, and if the honour of the
noble family required that the adventure should have a tragic
ending, it was easy to end everything with one of those poisons
which leave no trace; then, they would say that he had died a
natural death, and would take his dead body back to his room.</p>

<p>Carried away by his own story like a dramatic author, Julien was
really afraid when he entered the dining-room. He looked at all the
servants in full livery. He studied their expressions. 'Which of
them have been chosen for tonight's expedition?' he asked himself.
'In this family, the memories of the Court of Henri in are so
present, so often recalled, that, when they think themselves
outraged, they will show more decision than other people of their
rank.' He looked at Mademoiselle de La Mole in order to read in her
eyes what were the plans of her family; she was pale, and had quite
a mediaeval appearance. Never had he found such an air of grandeur
in her, she was truly beautiful and imposing. He almost fell in
love with her. '<i>Pallida morte futura</i>,' he told himself, 'her
pallor betokens that something serious is afoot.'</p>

<p>In vain, after dinner, did he prolong his stroll in the garden,
Mademoiselle de La Mole did not come out. Conversation with her
would, at that moment, have relieved his heart of a great
burden.</p>

<p>Why not confess it? He was afraid. As he was determined to act,
he abandoned himself to this sentiment without shame. 'Provided
that at the moment of action, I find the courage that I require,'
he said to himself, 'what does it matter how I may be feeling now?'
He went to reconnoitre the position and to try the weight of the
ladder.</p>

<p>'It is an instrument,' he said to himself, with a laugh, 'which
it is written in my destiny that I am to use! Here as at Verrières.
What a difference! Then,' he continued with a sigh, 'I was not
obliged to be suspicious of the person for whose sake I was
exposing myself. What a difference, too, in the danger!</p>

<p>'I might have been killed in M. de Rênal's gardens without any
harm to my reputation. It would have been easy to make my death
unaccountable. Here, what abominable tales will they not bandy
about in the drawing-rooms of the Hotel de Chaulnes, the Hotel de
Caylus, the Hotel de Retz, and in short everywhere? I shall be
handed down to posterity as a monster.</p>

<p>'For two or three years,' he added, laughing at himself. But the
thought of this overwhelmed him. 'And I, who is going to justify
me? Supposing that Fouque prints my posthumous pamphlet, it will be
only an infamy the more. What! I am received in a house, and in
payment for the hospitality I receive there, the kindness that is
showered upon me, I print a pamphlet reporting all that goes on in
the house! I attack the honour of its women! Ah, a thousand times
rather, let us be trapped!'</p>

<p>It was a terrible evening.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch46" id="ch46"></a>Chapter 46. One o'Clock in the
Morning</h2>

<p>The garden was extremely large, laid out with perfect<br>
taste just a few years previously. But the trees were over<br>
a century old. The place had something rustic about it.<br>
&mdash;MASSINGER</p>

<p>[Trans. footnote: I have left this motto untranslated, as the
attribution to Massinger seems to be entirely fantastic. C. K. S.
M.]</p>

<p>He was on the point of countermanding his instructions to Fouque
when the clock struck eleven. He came out of his bedroom and shut
the door behind him, turning the key noisily in the lock, as though
he were locking himself in. He prowled round the house to see what
was afoot everywhere, especially on the fourth floor, where the
servants slept. There was nothing unusual. One of Madame de La
Mole's maids was giving a party, the servants were merrily imbibing
punch. 'The men who are laughing like that,' thought Julien,
'cannot have been detailed for the midnight encounter, they would
be more serious.'</p>

<p>Finally he took his stand in a dark corner of the garden. 'If
their plan is to avoid the notice of the servants of the house,
they will make the men they have hired to seize me come in over the
garden wall.</p>

<p>'If M. de Croisenois is taking all this calmly, he must feel
that it will be less compromising for the young person whom he
intends to marry to have me seized before the moment when I shall
have entered her room.'</p>

<p>He made an extremely careful military reconnaissance. 'My honour
is at stake,' he thought; 'if I make some blunder, it will be no
excuse in my own eyes to say to myself: "I never thought of
that."'</p>

<p>The sky was maddeningly clear. About eleven o'clock the moon
rose, at half-past twelve it lighted the whole garden front of the
house.</p>

<p>'She is mad,' Julien said to himself; when one o'clock struck,
there was still a light in Comté Norbert's windows. Never in his
life had Julien been so much afraid, he saw only the dangers of the
enterprise, and felt not the least enthusiasm.</p>

<p>He went to fetch the huge ladder, waited five minutes, to allow
time for a countermand, and at five minutes past one placed the
ladder against Mathilde's window. He climbed quietly, pistol in
hand, astonished not to find himself attacked. As he reached the
window, she opened it silently:</p>

<p>'Here you are, Sir,' Mathilde said to him with deep emotion; 'I
have been following your movements for the last hour.'</p>

<p>Julien was greatly embarrassed, he did not know how to behave,
he did not feel the least vestige of love. In his embarrassment, he
decided that he must show courage, he attempted to embrace
Mathilde.</p>

<p>'Fie, Sir!' she said, and thrust him from her.</p>

<p>Greatly relieved at this repulse, he hastened to cast an eye
round the room: the moonlight was so brilliant that the shadows
which it formed in Mademoiselle de La Mole's room were black.
'There may easily be men concealed there without my seeing them,'
he thought.</p>

<p>'What have you in the side pocket of your coat?' Mathilde asked
him, delighted at finding a topic of conversation. She was
strangely ill at ease; all the feelings of reserve and timidity, so
natural to a young girl of good family, had resumed their sway and
were keeping her on tenter-hooks.</p>

<p>'I have all sorts of weapons and pistols,' replied Julien, no
less pleased at having something to say.</p>

<p>'You must pull up the ladder,' said Mathilde.</p>

<p>'It is huge, and may break the windows of the room below, or of
the mezzanine.'</p>

<p>'It must not break the windows,' Mathilde went on, trying in
vain to adopt the tone of ordinary conversation; 'you might, it
seems to me, let the ladder down by means of a cord tied to the top
rung. I always keep a supply of cords by me.'</p>

<p>'And this is a woman in love!' thought Julien, 'she dares to say
that she loves! Such coolness, such sagacity in her precautions
make it plain to me that I am not triumphing over M. de Croisenois,
as I foolishly imagined; but am simply becoming his successor.
After all, what does it matter? I am not in love! I triumph over
the Marquis in this sense, that he will be greatly annoyed at
having a successor, and still more annoyed that his successor
should be myself. How arrogantly he stared at me last night in the
Café Tortoni, pretending not to know me! How savagely he bowed to
me afterwards, when he could no longer avoid it!'</p>

<p>Julien had fastened the cord to the highest rung of the ladder,
he now let it down gently, leaning far out over the balcony so as
to see that it did not touch the windows. 'A fine moment for
killing me,' he thought, 'if there is anyone hidden in Mathilde's
room'; but a profound silence continued to reign everywhere.</p>

<p>The head of the ladder touched the ground. Julien succeeded in
concealing it in the bed of exotic flowers that ran beneath the
wall.</p>

<p>'What will my mother say,' said Mathilde, 'when she sees her
beautiful plants all ruined! You must throw down the cord,' she
went on, with perfect calm. 'If it were seen running up to the
balcony, it would be difficult to explain its presence.'</p>

<p>'And how me gwine get way?' asked Julien, in a playful tone,
imitating Creole speech. (One of the maids in the house was a
native of San Domingo.)</p>

<p>'You get way by the door,' said Mathilde, delighted at this
solution.</p>

<p>'Ah! How worthy this man is of all my love,' she thought.</p>

<p>Julien had just let the cord drop into the garden; Mathilde
gripped him by the arm. He thought he was being seized by an enemy,
and turned sharply round drawing a dagger. She thought she had
heard a window being opened. They stood motionless, without
breathing. The moon shone full upon them. As the sound was not
repeated, there was no further cause for alarm.</p>

<p>Then their embarrassment began again, and was great on both
sides. Julien made sure that the door was fastened with all its
bolts; he even thought of looking under the bed, but dared not;
they might have hidden a footman or two there. Finally, the fear of
a subsequent reproach from his prudence made him look.</p>

<p>Mathilde had succumbed to all the agonies of extreme shyness.
She felt a horror of her position.</p>

<p>'What have you done with my letters?' she said, at length.</p>

<p>'What a fine opportunity to discomfit these gentlemen, if they
are listening, and so avoid the conflict!' thought Julien.</p>

<p>'The first is hidden in a stout Protestant Bible which last
night's mail has carried far from here.'</p>

<p>He spoke very distinctly as he entered into these details, and
in such a way as to be overheard by anyone who might be concealed
in two great mahogany wardrobes which he had not dared to
examine.</p>

<p>'The other two are in the post, and are going the same way as
the first.'</p>

<p>'Good Lord! But why all these precautions?' said Mathilde, with
astonishment.</p>

<p>'Is there any reason why I should lie to her?' thought Julien;
and he confessed to her all his suspicions.</p>

<p>'So that accounts for the coldness of thy letters!' cried
Mathilde, in accents rather of frenzy than of affection.</p>

<p>Julien did not observe her change of tone. This use of the
singular pronoun made him lose his head, or at least his suspicions
vanished; he ventured to clasp in his arms this girl who was so
beautiful and inspired such respect in him. He was only half
repulsed.</p>

<p>He had recourse to his memory, as once before, long ago, at
Besançon with Amanda Binet, and repeated several of the finest
passages from the <i>Nouvelle Heloise</i>.</p>

<p>'Thou hast a man's heart,' she replied, without paying much
attention to what he was saying; 'I wished to test thy bravery, I
admit. Thy first suspicions and thyu determination to come shew
thee to be even more intrepid than I supposed.'</p>

<p>Mathilde made an effort to use the more intimate form; she was
evidently more attentive to this unusual way of speaking than to
what she was saying. This use of the <i>tu</i> form, stripped of
the tone of affection, ceased, after a moment, to afford Julien any
pleasure, he was astonished at the absence of happiness; finally,
in order to feel it, he had recourse to his reason. He saw himself
highly esteemed by this girl who was so proud, and never bestowed
unrestricted praise; by this line of reasoning he arrived at a
gratification of his self-esteem.</p>

<p>This was not, it is true, that spiritual ecstasy which he had
found at times in the company of Madame de Rênal. There was nothing
tender in his sentiments at this first moment. What he felt was the
keenest gratification of his ambition, and Julien was above all
things ambitious. He spoke again of the people he suspected and of
the precautions he had contrived. As he spoke he was thinking of
how best to profit by his victory.</p>

<p>Mathilde, who was still greatly embarrassed and had the air of
one appalled by what she had done, seemed enchanted at finding a
topic of conversation. They discussed how they should meet again.
Julien employed to the full the intelligence and daring of which he
furnished fresh proofs in the course of this discussion. They had
some extremely sharp-sighted people against them, young Tanbeau was
certainly a spy, but Mathilde and he were not altogether
incompetent either.</p>

<p>What could be easier than to meet in the library, and arrange
everything?</p>

<p>'I can appear, without arousing suspicion, in any part of the
house, I could almost appear in Madame de La Mole's bedroom.' It
was absolutely necessary to pass through this room to reach her
daughter's. If Mathilde preferred that he should always come by a
ladder, it was with a heart wild with joy that he would expose
himself to this slight risk.</p>

<p>As she listened to him speaking, Mathilde was shocked by his air
of triumph. 'He is my master, then!' she told herself. Already she
was devoured by remorse. Her reason felt a horror of the signal act
of folly which she had just committed. Had it been possible, she
would have destroyed herself and Julien. Whenever, for an instant,
the strength of her will made her remorse silent, feelings of
shyness and outraged modesty made her extremely wretched. She had
never for a moment anticipated the dreadful plight in which she now
found herself.</p>

<p>'I must speak to him, though,' she said to herself, finally,
'that is laid down in the rules, one speaks to one's lover.' And
then, as though performing a duty, and with a tenderness that was
evident rather in the words that she used than in the sound of her
voice, she told him of the various decisions to which she had come
with regard to him during the last few days.</p>

<p>She had made up her mind that if he ventured to come to her with
the aid of the gardener's ladder, as she had bidden him, she would
give herself to him. But never were things so tender said in a
colder and more formal tone. So far, their intercourse was
ice-bound. It was enough to make one hate the thought of love. What
a moral lesson for a rash young woman! Is it worth her while to
wreck her future for such a moment?</p>

<p>After prolonged uncertainties, which might have appeared to a
superficial observer to be due to the most decided hatred, so hard
was it for the feeling of self-respect which a woman owes to
herself, to yield to so masterful a will, Mathilde finally became
his mistress.</p>

<p>To tell the truth, their transports were somewhat deliberate.
Passionate love was far more a model which they were imitating than
a reality with them.</p>

<p>Mademoiselle de La Mole believed that she was performing a duty
towards herself and towards her lover. 'The poor boy,' she told
herself, 'has been the last word in daring, he deserves to be made
happy, or else I am wanting in character.' But she would gladly
have redeemed at the cost of an eternity of suffering the cruel
necessity to which she found herself committed.</p>

<p>In spite of the violence she was doing to herself, she retained
entire command of her speech.</p>

<p>No regret, no reproach came to mar this night which seemed odd
rather than happy to Julien. What a difference, great God, from his
last visit, of twenty-four hours, to Verrières! 'These fine Paris
manners have found out the secret of spoiling everything, even
love,' he said to himself with an extreme disregard of justice.</p>

<p>He abandoned himself to these reflections, standing upright in
one of the great mahogany wardrobes into which he had been thrust
at the first sound heard from the next room, which was Madame de La
Mole's bedroom. Mathilde accompanied her mother to mass, the maids
soon left the apartment, and Julien easily made his escape before
they returned to complete their labours.</p>

<p>He mounted his horse and made at a leisurely pace for the most
solitary recesses of one of the forests near Paris. He was still
more surprised than happy. The happiness which, from time to time,
came flooding into his heart, was akin to that of a young Second
Lieutenant who, after some astounding action, has just been
promoted Colonel by the Commander in Chief; he felt himself carried
to an immense height. Everything that had been above him the day
before was now on his level or far beneath him. Gradually Julien's
happiness increased as he put the miles behind him.</p>

<p>If there was nothing tender in his heart, it was because,
strange as it may appear, Mathilde, throughout the whole of her
conduct with him, had been performing a duty. There was nothing
unforeseen for her in all the events of this night but the misery
and shame which she had found in the place of that utter bliss of
which we read in novels.</p>

<p>'Can I have been mistaken? Am I not in love with him?' she asked
herself.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch47" id="ch47"></a>Chapter 47. An Old Sword</h2>

<p style="margin-left:10%">I now mean to be serious:&mdash;it is
time,<br>
Since laughter nowadays is deem'd too serious.<br>
A jest at Vice by Virtue's call'd a crime.<br>
&mdash;<i>Don Juan</i>, XIII.</p>

<p>She did not appear at dinner. In the evening she came to the
drawing-room for a moment, but did not look at Julien. This
behaviour seemed to him strange; 'but,' he thought, 'I do not know
the ways of good society, she will give me some good reason for all
this.' At the same time, urged by the most intense curiosity, he
studied the expression on Mathilde's features; he could not conceal
from himself that she had a sharp and malevolent air. Evidently
this was not the same woman who, the night before, had felt or
pretended to feel transports of joy too excessive to be
genuine.</p>

<p>Next day, and the day after, the same coldness on her part; she
never once looked at him, she seemed unaware of his existence.
Julien, devoured by the keenest anxiety, was a thousand leagues
from the feeling of triumph which alone had animated him on the
first day. 'Can it, by any chance,' he asked himself, 'be a return
to the path of virtue?' But that was a very middle-class expression
to use of the proud Mathilde.</p>

<p>'In the ordinary situations of life she has no belief in
religion,' thought Julien; 'she values it as being very useful to
the interests of her caste.</p>

<p>'But out of simple delicacy may she not be bitterly reproaching
herself with the mistake that she has made?' Julien assumed that he
was her first lover.</p>

<p>'But,' he said to himself at other moments, 'one must admit that
there is nothing artless, simple, tender, in her attitude; never
have I seen her looking so haughty. Can she despise me? It would be
like her to reproach herself with what she has done for me, solely
on account of my humble birth.'</p>

<p>While Julien, steeped in the prejudices he had derived from
books and from memories of Verrières, was pursuing the chimera of a
tender mistress who never gives a thought to her own existence the
moment she has gratified the desires of her lover, Mathilde in her
vanity was furious with him.</p>

<p>As she had ceased to be bored for the last two months, she was
no longer afraid of boredom; so, albeit he could not for a moment
suspect it, Julien was deprived of his strongest advantage.</p>

<p>'I have given myself a master!' Mademoiselle de La Mole was
saying to herself, in the grip of the blackest despond. 'He may be
the soul of honour; but if I goad his vanity to extremes, he will
have his revenge by making public the nature of our relations.'
Mathilde had never had a lover, and at this epoch in life, which
gives certain tender illusions to even the most sterile hearts, she
was a prey to the bitterest reflections.</p>

<p>'He has an immense power over me, since he reigns by terror and
can inflict a fearful punishment on me if I drive him to extremes.'
This idea, by itself, was enough to provoke Mathilde to insult him.
Courage was the fundamental quality in her character. Nothing was
capable of giving her any excitement and of curing her of an
ever-present tendency to boredom, but the idea that she was playing
heads or tails with her whole existence.</p>

<p>On the third day, as Mademoiselle de La Mole persisted in not
looking at him, Julien followed her after dinner, to her evident
annoyance, into the billiard room.</p>

<p>'Well, Sir; you must imagine yourself to have acquired some very
powerful hold over me,' she said to him, with ill-controlled rage,
'since in opposition to my clearly expressed wishes, you insist on
speaking to me? Are you aware that nobody in the world has ever
been so presumptuous?'</p>

<p>Nothing could be more entertaining than the dialogue between
these two lovers; unconsciously they were animated by a mutual
sentiment of the keenest hatred. As neither of them had a
consistent nature, as moreover they were used to the ways of good
society, it was not long before they both declared in plain terms
that they had quarrelled for ever.</p>

<p>'I swear to you eternal secrecy,' said Julien; 'I would even add
that I will never address a word to you again, were it not that
your reputation might be injured by too marked a change.' He bowed
respectfully and left her.</p>

<p>He performed without undue difficulty what he regarded as a
duty; he was far from imagining himself to be deeply in love with
Mademoiselle de La Mole. No doubt he had not been in love with her
three days earlier, when he had been concealed in the great
mahogany wardrobe. But everything changed rapidly in his heart from
the moment when he saw himself parted from her for ever.</p>

<p>His pitiless memory set to work reminding him of the slightest
incidents of that night which in reality had left him so cold.</p>

<p>During the very night after their vow of eternal separation,
Julien nearly went mad when he found himself forced to admit that
he was in love with Mademoiselle de La Mole.</p>

<p>A ghastly conflict followed this discovery: all his feelings
were thrown into confusion.</p>

<p>Two days later, instead of being haughty with M. de Croisenois,
he could almost have burst into tears and embraced him.</p>

<p>The force of continued unhappiness gave him a glimmer of common
sense; he decided to set off for Languedoc, packed his trunk and
went to the posting house.</p>

<p>He almost fainted when, on reaching the coach office, he was
informed that, by mere chance, there was a place vacant next day in
the Toulouse mail. He engaged it and returned to the Hotel de La
Mole to warn the Marquis of his departure.</p>

<p>M. de La Mole had gone out. More dead than alive, Julien went to
wait for him in the library. What were his feelings on finding
Mademoiselle de La Mole there?</p>

<p>On seeing him appear, she assumed an air of malevolence which it
was impossible for him to misinterpret,</p>

<p>Carried away by his misery, dazed by surprise, Julien was weak
enough to say to her, in the tenderest of tones and one that sprang
from the heart: 'Then, you no longer love me?'</p>

<p>'I am horrified at having given myself to the first comer,' said
Mathilde, weeping with rage at herself.</p>

<p>'<i>To the first comer</i>!' cried Julien, and he snatched up an
old mediaeval sword which was kept in the library as a
curiosity.</p>

<p>His grief, which he had believed to be intense at the moment of
his speaking to Mademoiselle de La Mole, had now been increased an
hundredfold by the tears of shame which he saw her shed. He would
have been the happiest of men had it been possible to kill her.</p>

<p>Just as he had drawn the sword, with some difficulty, from its
antiquated scabbard, Mathilde, delighted by so novel a sensation,
advanced proudly towards him; her tears had ceased to flow.</p>

<p>The thought of the Marquis de La Mole, his benefactor, arose
vividly in Julien's mind. 'I should be killing his daughter!' he
said to himself; 'how horrible!' He made as though to fling away
the sword. 'Certainly,' he thought, 'she will now burst out
laughing at the sight of this melodramatic gesture': thanks to this
consideration, he entirely regained his self-possession. He
examined the blade of the old sword with curiosity, and as though
he were looking for a spot of rust, then replaced it in its
scabbard, and with the utmost calm hung it up on the nail of gilded
bronze from which he had taken it.</p>

<p>This series of actions, very deliberate towards the end,
occupied fully a minute; Mademoiselle de La Mole gazed at him in
astonishment. 'So I have been within an inch of being killed by my
lover!' she said to herself.</p>

<p>This thought carried her back to the bravest days of the age of
Charles IX and Henri III.</p>

<p>She stood motionless before Julien who had now replaced the
sword, she gazed at him with eyes in which there was no more
hatred. It must be admitted that she was very attractive at that
moment, certainly no woman had ever borne less resemblance to a
Parisian doll (this label expressed Julien's chief objection to the
women of that city).</p>

<p>'I am going to fall back into a fondness for him,' thought
Mathilde; 'and then at once he would suppose himself to be my lord
and master, after a relapse, and at the very moment when I have
just spoken to him so firmly.' She fled.</p>

<p>'My God! How beautiful she is!' said Julien, as he watched her
run from the room: 'that is the creature who flung herself into my
arms with such frenzy not a week ago...And those moments will never
come again! And it is my fault! And, at the moment of so
extraordinary an action, and one that concerned me so closely, I
was not conscious of it!...I must admit that I was born with a very
dull and unhappy nature.'</p>

<p>The Marquis appeared; Julien made haste to inform him of his
departure.</p>

<p>'For where?' said M. de La Mole.</p>

<p>'For Languedoc.'</p>

<p>'No, if you please, you are reserved for a higher destiny; if
you go anywhere, it will be to the North...Indeed, in military
parlance, I confine you to your quarters. You will oblige me by
never being absent for more than two or three hours, I may need you
at any moment.'</p>

<p>Julien bowed, and withdrew without uttering a word, leaving the
Marquis greatly astonished; he was incapable of speech, and shut
himself up in his room. There, he was free to exaggerate all the
iniquity of his lot.</p>

<p>'And so,' he thought, 'I cannot even go away! God knows for how
many days the Marquis is going to keep me in Paris; great God! What
is to become of me? And not a friend that I can consult; the abbe
Pirard would not let me finish my first sentence, Conte Altamira
would offer to enlist me in some conspiracy.</p>

<p>'And meanwhile I am mad, I feel it; I am mad!</p>

<p>'Who can guide me, what is to become of me?'</p>

<p style="margin-left:10%">And she admits it to me! She goes into
the minutest<br>
details! Her lovely eye fixed on mine reveals the<br>
love that she felt for another!<br>
&mdash;SCHILLER</p>

<p>Mademoiselle de La Mole, in an ecstasy, could think only of the
felicity of having come within an inch of being killed. She went so
far as to say to herself: 'He is worthy to be my master, since he
has been on the point of killing me. How many of the good-looking
young men in society would one have to fuse together to arrive at
such an impulse of passion?</p>

<p>'One must admit that he did look handsome when he climbed on the
chair, to replace the sword, precisely in the picturesque position
which the decorator had chosen for it! After all, I was not such a
fool to fall in love with him.'</p>

<p>At that moment, had any honourable way of renewing their
relations presented itself, she would have seized it with pleasure.
Julien, locked and double-locked in his room, was a prey to the
most violent despair. In the height of his folly, he thought of
flinging himself at her feet. If, instead of remaining hidden in a
remote corner, he had wandered through the house and into the
garden, so as to be within reach of any opportunity, he might
perhaps in a single instant have converted his fearful misery into
the keenest happiness.</p>

<p>But the adroitness with the want of which we are reproaching him
would have debarred the sublime impulse of seizing the sword which,
at that moment, made him appear so handsome in the eyes of
Mademoiselle de La Mole. This caprice, which told in Julien's
favour, lasted for the rest of the day; Mathilde formed a charming
impression of the brief moments during which she had loved him, and
looked back on them with regret.</p>

<p>'Actually,' she said to herself, 'my passion for that poor boy
lasted, in his eyes, only from one o'clock in the morning, when I
saw him arrive by his ladder, with all his pistols in the side
pocket of his coat, until eight. It was at a quarter past eight,
when hearing mass at Sainte-Valere, that it first occurred to me
that he would imagine himself to be my master, and might try to
make me obey him by force of terror.'</p>

<p>After dinner, Mademoiselle de La Mole, far from avoiding Julien,
spoke to him, and almost ordered him to accompany her to the
garden; he obeyed. This proved too much for her self-control.
Mathilde yielded, almost unconsciously, to the love which she began
to feel for him. She found an intense pleasure in strolling by his
side, it was with curiosity that she gazed at his hands which that
morning had seized the sword to kill her.</p>

<p>After such an action, after all that had passed, there could no
longer be any question of their conversing on the same terms as
before.</p>

<p>Gradually Mathilde began to talk to him with an intimate
confidence of the state of her heart. She found a strange delight
in this kind of conversation; she proceeded to tell him of the
fleeting impulses of enthusiasm which she had felt for M. de
Croisenois, for M. de Caylus ...</p>

<p>'What! For M. de Caylus as well!' cried Julien; and all the
bitter jealousy of a past jilted lover was made manifest in his
words. Mathilde received them in that light, and was not
offended.</p>

<p>She continued to torture Julien, detailing her past feelings in
the most picturesque fashion, and in accents of the most absolute
sincerity. He saw that she was describing what was present before
her eyes. He had the grief of remarking that as she spoke she made
fresh discoveries in her own heart.</p>

<p>The agony of jealousy can go no farther.</p>

<p>The suspicion that a rival is loved is painful enough already,
but to have the love that he inspires in her confessed to one in
detail by the woman whom one adores is without doubt the acme of
suffering.</p>

<p>Oh, how she punished, at that moment, the impulse of pride which
had led Julien to set himself above all the Caylus and Croisenois!
With what an intense and heartfelt misery he now exaggerated their
most trivial advantages! With what ardent sincerity he now despised
himself!</p>

<p>Mathilde seemed adorable to him, language fails to express the
intensity of his admiration. As he walked by her side, he cast
furtive glances at her hands, her arms, her regal bearing. He was
on the point of falling at her feet, crushed with love and misery,
and crying: 'Pity!'</p>

<p>'And this creature who is so lovely, so superior to all the
rest, who has once loved me, it is M. de Caylus whom, no doubt, she
will presently be loving!'</p>

<p>Julien could not doubt Mademoiselle de La Mole's sincerity; the
accent of truth was all too evident in everything that she said.
That absolutely nothing might be wanting to complete his misery,
there were moments when, by dint of occupying her mind with the
sentiments which she had at one time felt for M. de Caylus,
Mathilde was led to speak of him as though she loved him still.
Certainly there was love in her accents, Julien could see it
plainly.</p>

<p>Had his bosom been flooded with a mass of molten lead, he would
have suffered less. How, arrived at this extreme pitch of misery,
was the poor boy to guess that it was because she was talking to
him that Mademoiselle de La Mole found such pleasure in recalling
all the niceties of love that she had felt in the past for M. de
Caylus or M. de Luz?</p>

<p>No words could express Julien's anguish. He was listening to the
detailed confidences of the love felt for others in that same lime
walk where, so few days since, he had waited for one o'clock to
strike before making his way into her room. Human nature is
incapable of enduring misery at a higher pitch than this.</p>

<p>This kind of cruel intimacy lasted for a whole week. Mathilde
now appeared to seek, now did not shun opportunities of speaking to
him; and the subject of conversation, to which they seemed both to
return with a sort of torturing pleasure, was the recital of the
sentiments that she had felt for others; she recounted to him the
letters that she had written, told him the very words of them,
repeated whole sentences. On the final days she seemed to be
studying Julien with a sort of malignant delight. His sufferings
were a source of keen enjoyment to her.</p>

<p>We can see that Julien had no experience of life, he had not
even read any novels; if he had been a little less awkward, and had
said with a certain coldness to this girl, whom he so adored and
who made him such strange confidences: 'Admit that though I am not
the equal of all these gentlemen, it is still myself that you
love...'</p>

<p>Perhaps she would have been glad to have her secret guessed; at
any rate his success would have depended entirely upon the grace
with which Julien expressed this idea, and the moment that he
chose. However that might be, he came out well, and yith advantage
to himself, from a situation which was tending to become monotonous
in Mathilde's eyes.</p>

<p>'And you no longer love me, me who adore you!' Julien said |o
her one day, desperate with love and misery. It was almost She
worst blunder that he could have made.</p>

<p>This speech destroyed in an instant all the pleasure that
lademoiselle de La Mole found in speaking to him of the state of
her heart. She was beginning to feel astonished that after what had
happened he did not take offence at her confidences, he was on the
point of imagining, at the moment when he made this foolish speech,
that perhaps he no longer loved her. 'Pride has doubtless quenched
his love,' she said to herself. 'He is not the man to see himself
set with impunity beneath creatures like Caylus, de Luz,
Croisenois, who he admits are so far his superiors. No, I shall
never see him at my feet again!'</p>

<p>On the preceding days, in the artlessness of his misery, Julien
had paid a heartfelt tribute to the brilliant qualities of these
gentlemen; he went so far as to exaggerate them. This change of
attitude had by no means escaped the notice of Mademoiselle de La
Mole; it had surprised her, but she did not suspect the reason or
it. Julien's frenzied soul, in praising a rival whom he believed to
be loved, sympathised with that rival in his good fortune.</p>

<p>This speech, so frank but so stupid, altered the whole situation
an instant: Mathilde, certain of being loved, despised him
completely.</p>

<p>She was strolling with him at the moment of this unfortunate
utterance; she left him, and her final glance was expressive of the
most bitter scorn. Returning to the drawing-room, for the rest of
the evening she never looked at him again. Next day, this scorn of
him had entire possession of her heart; there was no longer any
question of the impulse which, for a whole week, had made her find
such pleasure in treating Julien as her most intimate friend; the
sight of him was repulsive to her. Mathilde's feeling reached the
point of disgust; no words could express the intensity of the scorn
that she felt when her eyes happened to fall on him.</p>

<p>Julien had understood nothing of all that had been happening in
Mathilde's heart, but for the past week he discerned her scorn. He
had the good sense to appear in her presence as rarely as possible,
and never looked her in the face.</p>

<p>But it was not without a mortal anguish that he deprived himself
to some extent of her company. He thought he could feel that his
misery was thereby actually increased. 'The courage of a man's
heart can go no farther,' he told himself. He spent all his time at
a little window in the attics of the house; the shutters were
carefully closed, and from there, at least, he could catch a
glimpse of Mademoiselle de La Mole when she appeared in the
garden.</p>

<p>What were his feelings when, after dinner, he saw her strolling
with M. de Caylus, M. de Luz or any of the others for whom she had
avowed some slight amorous inclination in the past?</p>

<p>Julien had had no idea of such an intensity of misery; he was on
the point of crying aloud; that resolute heart was at last reduced
to utter helplessness.</p>

<p>Any thought that was not of Mademoiselle de La Mole had become
odious to him; he was incapable of writing the most simple
letters.</p>

<p>'You are crazy,' the Marquis said to him.</p>

<p>Julien, trembling with fear of a disclosure, pleaded illness and
managed to make himself believed. Fortunately for him, the Marquis
teased him at dinner over his coming journey: Mathilde gathered
that it might be prolonged. For several days now Julien had been
avoiding her, and the brilliant young men who had everything that
was lacking in this creature so pale and sombre, once loved by her,
had no longer the power to distract her from her dreams.</p>

<p>'An ordinary girl,' she said to herself, 'would have sought for
the man of her choice among the young fellows who attract every eye
in a drawing-room; but one of the characteristics of genius is not
to let its thoughts move in the rut traced by the common herd.</p>

<p>'As the partner of such a man as Julien, who lacks nothing but
the fortune which I possess, I shall continue to attract attention,
I shall by no means pass unperceived through life. So far from
incessantly dreading a Revolution like my cousins, who, in their
fear of the people, dare not scold a postilion who drives them
badly, I shall be certain of playing a part and a great part, for
the man of my choice has character and an unbounded ambition. What
does he lack? Friends? Money? I can give him all that.' But in her
thoughts she treated Julien rather as an inferior being who can be
made to love one when one wills.</p>

<h2><a name="ch49" id="ch49"></a>Chapter 49. The Opera-Bouffe</h2>

<p style="margin-left:10%">O how this spring of love resembleth<br>
The uncertain glory of an April day;<br>
Which now shows all the beauty of the sun,<br>
And by and by a cloud takes all away!<br>
&mdash;SHAKESPEARE</p>

<p>Occupied with thoughts of the future and of the singular part
which she hoped to play, Mathilde soon came to look back with
regret upon the dry, metaphysical discussions which she often had
with Julien. Wearied with keeping her thoughts on so high a plane,
sometimes also she would sigh for the moments of happiness which
she had found in his company; these memories were not untouched by
remorse, which at certain moments overwhelmed her.</p>

<p>'But if one has a weakness,' she said to herself, 'it is
incumbent upon a girl like myself to forget her duties only for a
man of merit; people will not be able to say that it was his
handsome moustaches or his elegant seat on a horse that seduced me,
but his profound discussions of the future in store for France, his
ideas as to the resemblance the events that are going to burst upon
us may bear to the Revolution of 1688 in England. I have been
seduced,' she answered the voice of remorse, 'I am a weak woman,
but at least I have not been led astray like a puppet by outward
advantages.</p>

<p>'If there be a Revolution, why should not Julien Sorel play the
part of Roland, and I that of Madame Roland? I prefer that to the
part of Madame de Stael: immoral conduct will be an obstacle in our
time. Certainly they shall not reproach me with a second lapse; I
should die of shame.'</p>

<p>Mathilde's meditations were not all as grave, it must be
admitted, as the thoughts we have just transcribed.</p>

<p>She would look at Julien, and found a charming grace in his most
trivial actions.</p>

<p>'No doubt,' she said to herself, 'I have succeeded in destroying
every idea in his mind that he has certain rights.</p>

<p>'The air of misery and profound passion with which the poor boy
addressed those words of love to me a week ago, is proof positive;
I must confess that it was extraordinary in me to be vexed by a
speech so fervent with respect and passion. Am I not his wife? That
speech was only natural, and, I am bound to say, quite agreeable.
Julien still loved me after endless conversations, in which I had
spoken to him, and with great cruelty, I admit, only of the
feelings of love which the boredom of the life I lead had inspired
in me for the young men in society of whom he is so jealous. Ah, if
he knew how little danger there is in them for me! How lifeless
they seem to me when compared with him, all copies of each
other.'</p>

<p>As she made these reflections, Mathilde was tracing lines with a
pencil at random on a page of her album. One of the profiles as she
finished it startled and delighted her: it bore a striking
resemblance to Julien. 'It is the voice of heaven! This is one of
the miracles of love,' she cried in a transport, 'quite
unconsciously I have drawn his portrait.'</p>

<p>She fled to her room, locked herself in, set to work, tried
seriously to make a portrait of Julien, but could not succeed; the
profile drawn at random was still the best likeness. Mathilde was
enchanted; she saw in it a clear proof of her grand passion.</p>

<p>She did not lay aside her album until late in the evening, when
the Marquise sent for her to go to the Italian opera. She had only
one idea, to catch Julien's eye, so as to make her mother invite
him to join them.</p>

<p>He did not appear; the ladies had only the most commonplace
people in their box. During the whole of the first act of the
opera, Mathilde sat dreaming of the man whom she loved with
transports of the most intense passion; but in the second act a
maxim of love sung, it must be admitted, to a melody worthy of
Cimarosa, penetrated her heart. The heroine of the opera said: 'I
must be punished for all the adoration that I feel for him, I love
him too well!'</p>

<p>The moment she had heard this sublime <i>cantilena</i>,
everything that existed in the world vanished from Mathilde's ken.
People spoke to her; she did not answer; her mother scolded her, it
was all she could do to look at her. Her ecstasy reached a state of
exaltation and passion comparable to the most violent emotions
that, during the last few days, Julien had felt for her. The
<i>cantilena</i>, divinely graceful, to which was sung the maxim
that seemed to her to bear so striking an application to her own
situation, occupied every moment in which she was not thinking
directly of Julien. Thanks to her love of music, she became that
evening as Madame de Rênal invariably was when thinking of him.
Love born in the brain is more spirited, doubtless, than true love,
but it has only flashes of enthusiasm; it knows itself too well, it
criticises itself incessantly; so far from banishing thought, it is
itself reared only upon a structure of thought.</p>

<p>On her return home, in spite of anything that Madame de La Mole
might say, Mathilde alleged an attack of fever, and spent part of
the night playing over the <i>cantilena</i> on her piano. She sang
the words of the famous aria which had charmed her:</p>

<p style="margin-left:10%">Devo punirmi, devo punirmi,<br>
Se troppo amai.</p>

<p>The result of this night of madness was that she imagined
herself to have succeeded in conquering her love. (This page will
damage the unfortunate author in more ways than one. The frigid
hearts will accuse it of indecency. It does not offer the insult to
the young persons who shine in the drawing-rooms of Paris, of
supposing that a single one of their number is susceptible to the
mad impulses which degrade the character of Mathilde. This
character is wholly imaginary, and is indeed imagined quite apart
from the social customs which among all the ages will assure so
distinguished a place to the civilisation of the nineteenth
century.</p>

<p>It is certainly not prudence that is lacking in the young ladies
who have been the ornament of the balls this winter.</p>

<p>Nor do I think that one can accuse them of unduly despising a
brilliant fortune, horses, fine properties, and everything that
ensures an agreeable position in society. So far from their seeing
nothing but boredom in all these advantages, they are as a rule the
object of their most constant desires, and if there is any passion
in their hearts it is for them.</p>

<p>Neither is it love that provides for the welfare of young men
endowed with a certain amount of talent like Julien; they attach
themselves inseparably to a certain set, and when the set
'arrives', all the good things of society rain upon them. Woe to
the student who belongs to no set, even his minute and far from
certain successes will be made a reproach to him, and the higher
virtue will triumph over him as it robs him. Ah, Sir, a novel is a
mirror carried along a high road. At one moment it reflects to your
vision the azure skies, at another the mire of the puddles at your
feet. And the man who carries this mirror in his pack will be
accused by you of being immoral! His mirror shows the mire, and you
blame the mirror! Rather blame that high road upon which the puddle
lies, still more the inspector of roads who allows the water to
gather and the puddle to form.</p>

<p>Now that it is quite understood that the character of Mathilde
is impossible in our age, no less prudent than virtuous, I am less
afraid of causing annoyance by continuing the account of the
follies of this charming girl.)</p>

<p>Throughout the whole of the day that followed she looked out for
opportunities to assure herself that she had indeed conquered her
insane passion. Her main object was to displease Julien in every
way; but none of her movements passed unperceived by him.</p>

<p>Julien was too wretched and above all, too greatly agitated, to
interpret so complicated a stratagem of passion, still less could
he discern all the promise that it held out to himself: he fell a
victim to it; never perhaps had his misery been so intense. His
actions were so little under the control of his mind that if some
morose philosopher had said to him: 'Seek to take advantage rapidly
of a disposition which for the moment is favourable to you; in this
sort of brain-fed love, which we see in Paris, the same state of
mind cannot continue for more than a couple of days,' he would not
have understood. But, excited as he might be, Julien had a sense of
honour. His first duty was discretion; so much he did understand.
To ask for advice, to relate his agony to the first comer would
have been a happiness comparable to that of the wretch who,
crossing a burning desert, receives from the sky a drop of ice-cold
water. He was aware of the danger, he was afraid of answering with
a torrent of tears the indiscreet person who should question him;
he closeted himself in his room.</p>

<p>He saw Mathilde strolling late and long in the garden; when at
length she had left it, he went down there; he made his way to a
rose tree from which she had plucked a rose.</p>

<p>The night was dark, he could indulge the full extent of his
misery without fear of being seen. It was evident to him that
Mademoiselle de La Mole was in love with one of those young
officers to whom she had been chattering so gaily. He himself had
been loved by her, but she had seen how slight were his merits.</p>

<p>'And indeed, they are slight!' Julien told himself with entire
conviction; 'I am, when all is said, a very dull creature, very
common, very tedious to others, quite insupportable to myself.' He
was sick to death of all his own good qualities, of all the things
that he had loved with enthusiasm; and in this state of inverted
imagination he set to work to criticise life with his imagination.
This is an error that stamps a superior person.</p>

<p>More than once the idea of suicide occurred to him; this image
was full of charm, it was like a delicious rest; it was the glass
of ice-cold water offered to the wretch who, in the desert, is
dying of thirst and heat.</p>

<p>'My death will increase the scorn that she feels for me!' he
exclaimed. 'What a memory I shall leave behind me!'</p>

<p>Sunk into the nethermost abyss of misery, a human being has no
resource left but courage. Julien had not wisdom enough to say to
himself: 'I must venture all'; but as he looked up at the window of
Mathilde's room, he could see through the shutters that she was
putting out her light: he pictured to himself that charming room
which he had seen, alas, once only in his life. His imagination
went no farther.</p>

<p>One o'clock struck; from hearing the note of the bell to saying
to himself: 'I am going up by the ladder,' did not take a
moment.</p>

<p>This was a flash of genius, cogent reasons followed in
abundance. 'Can I possibly be more wretched?' he asked himself. He
ran to the ladder, the gardener had made it fast with a chain. With
the hammer of one of his pocket pistols, which he broke, Julien,
animated for the moment by a superhuman force, wrenched open one of
the iron links of the chain which bound the ladder; in a few
minutes it was free, and he had placed it against Mathilde's
window.</p>

<p>'She will be angry, will heap contempt upon me, what of that? I
give her a kiss, a final kiss, I go up to my room and kill
myself...; my lips will have touched her cheek before I die!'</p>

<p>He flew up the ladder, tapped at the shutter; a moment later
Mathilde heard him, she tried to open the shutter, the ladder kept
it closed. Julien clung to the iron latch intended to hold the
shutter open, and, risking a thousand falls, gave the ladder a
violent shake, and displaced it a little. Mathilde was able to open
the shutter.</p>

<p>He flung himself into the room more dead than alive: 'So it is
you!' she said, and fell into his arms...</p>

<p>* * *</p>

<p>What words can describe the intensity of Julien's happiness?
Mathilde's was almost as great.</p>

<p>She spoke to him against herself, she accused herself to
him.</p>

<p>'Punish me for my atrocious pride,' she said to him, squeezing
him in her arms as though to strangle him; 'you are my master, I am
your slave, I must beg pardon upon my knees for having sought to
rebel.' She slipped from his embrace to fall at his feet. 'Yes, you
are my master,' she said again, intoxicated with love and joy;
'reign over me for ever, punish your slave severely when she seeks
to rebel.'</p>

<p>In another moment she had torn herself from his arms, lighted
the candle, and Julien had all the difficulty in the world in
preventing her from cutting off all one side of her hair.</p>

<p>'I wish to remind myself,' she told him, 'that I am your
servant: should my accursed pride ever make me forget it, show me
these locks and say: "There is no question now of love, we are not
concerned with the emotion that your heart may be feeling at this
moment, you have sworn to obey, obey upon your honour."'</p>

<p>But it is wiser to suppress the description of so wild a
felicity.</p>

<p>Julien's chivalry was as great as his happiness; 'I must go down
now by the ladder,' he said to Mathilde, when he saw the dawn
appear over the distant chimneys to the east, beyond the gardens.
The sacrifice that I am imposing on myself is worthy of you, I am
depriving myself of some hours of the most astounding happiness
that a human soul can enjoy, it is a sacrifice that I am offering
to your reputation: if you know my heart you appreciate the effort
that I have to make. Will you always be to me what you are at this
moment? But the voice of honour speaks, it is enough. Let me tell
you that, since our first meeting, suspicion has not been directed
only against robbers. M. de La Mole has set a watch in the garden.
M. de Croisenois is surrounded by spies, we know what he is, doing
night by night...'</p>

<p>When she heard this idea, Mathilde burst out laughing. Her
mother and one of the maids were aroused: immediately they called
to her through the door. Julien looked at her, she turned pale as
she scolded the maid, and did not condescend to speak to her
mother.</p>

<p>'But if it should occur to them to open the window, they will
see the ladder!' Julien said to her.</p>

<p>He clasped her once more in his arms, sprang on to the ladder
and slid rather than climbed down it; in a moment he was on the
ground.</p>

<p>Three seconds later the ladder was under the lime alley, and
Mathilde's honour was saved. Julien, on recovering his senses,
found himself bleeding copiously and half naked: he had cut himself
in his headlong descent.</p>

<p>The intensity of his happiness had restored all the energy of
his nature: had a score of men appeared before him, to attack them
single-handed would, at that moment, have been but a pleasure the
more. Fortunately, his martial valour was not put to the proof: he
laid down the ladder in its accustomed place; he replaced the chain
that fastened it; he did not forget to come back and obliterate the
print which the ladder had left in the border of exotic flowers
beneath Mathilde's window.</p>

<p>As in the darkness he explored the loose earth with his hand, to
make sure that the mark was entirely obliterated, he felt something
drop on his hand; it was a whole side of Mathilde's hair which she
had clipped and threw down to him.</p>

<p>She was at her window.</p>

<p>'See what your servant sends you,' she said in audible tones,
'it is the sign of eternal obedience. I renounce the exercise of my
own reason; be my master.'</p>

<p>Julien, overcome, was on the point of fetching back the ladder
and mounting again to her room. Finally reason prevailed.</p>

<p>To enter the house from the garden was by no means easy. He
succeeded in forcing the door of a cellar; once in the house he was
obliged to break open, as silently as possible, the door of his own
room. In his confusion he had left everything behind, including the
key, which was in the pocket of his coat. 'Let us hope,' he
thought, 'that she will remember to hide all that <i>corpus
delicti</i>!'</p>

<p>Finally exhaustion overpowered happiness, and, as the sun rose,
he fell into a profound slumber.</p>

<p>The luncheon bell just succeeded in waking him, he made his
appearance in the dining-room. Shortly afterwards, Mathilde entered
the room. Julien's pride tasted a momentary joy when he saw the
love that glowed in the eyes of this beautiful creature, surrounded
by every mark of deference; but soon his prudence found an occasion
for alarm.</p>

<p>On the pretext of not having had time to dress her hair
properly, Mathilde had so arranged it that Julien could see at a
glance the whole extent of the sacrifice that she had made for him
in clipping her locks that night. If anything could have spoiled so
lovely a head, Mathilde would have succeeded in spoiling hers; all
one side of those beautiful pale golden locks were cropped to
within half an inch of her scalp.</p>

<p>At luncheon, Mathilde's whole behaviour was in keeping with this
original imprudence. You would have said that she was deliberately
trying to let everyone see the insane passion that she had for
Julien. Fortunately, that day, M. de La Mole and the Marquise were
greatly taken up with a list of forthcoming promotions to the Blue
Riband, in which the name of M. de Chaulnes had not been included.
Towards the end of the meal, Mathilde in talking to Julien
addressed him as 'my master'. He coloured to the whites of his
eyes.</p>

<p>Whether by accident or by the express design of Madame de La
Mole, Mathilde was not left alone for an instant that day. In the
evening, however, as she passed from the dining-room to the
drawing-room, she found an opportunity of saying to Julien:</p>

<p>'I hope you do not think that it is my idea: Mamma has just
decided that one of her maids is to sleep in my room.'</p>

<p>The day passed like lightning; Julien was on the highest
pinnacle of happiness. By seven o'clock next morning he was
installed in the library; he hoped that Mademoiselle de La Mole
would deign to appear there; he had written her an endless
letter.</p>

<p>He did not see her until several hours had passed, at luncheon.
Her head was dressed on this occasion with the greatest pains; a
marvellous art had been employed to conceal the gap left by the
clipped locks. She looked once or twice at Julien, but with polite,
calm eyes; there was no longer any question of her calling him 'my
master'.</p>

<p>Julien could not breathe for astonishment...Mathilde found fault
with herself for almost everything that she had done for him.</p>

<p>On mature reflection, she had decided that he was a creature, if
not altogether common, at any rate not sufficiently conspicuous to
deserve all the strange follies which she had ventured to commit
for him. On the whole, she no longer thought of love; she was tired
of love that day.</p>

<p>As for Julien, the emotions of his heart were those of a boy of
sixteen. Harrowing doubt, bewilderment, despair, seized upon him by
turns during this luncheon, which seemed to him to be
everlasting.</p>

<p>As soon as he could decently rise from table, he flew rather
than ran to the stable, saddled his horse himself and was off at a
gallop; he was afraid of disgracing himself by some sign of
weakness. 'I must kill my heart by physical exhaustion,' he said to
himself as he galloped through the woods of Meudon. 'What have I
done, what have I said to deserve such disgrace?</p>

<p>'I must do nothing, say nothing today,' he decided as he
returned to the house, 'be dead in body as I am in spirit. Julien
no longer lives, it is his corpse that is still stirring.'</p>

&mdash;JEAN-PAUL</p>

<p>The dinner bell rang, Julien had barely time to dress; he found
Mathilde in the drawing-room urging her brother and M. de
Croisenois not to go and spend the evening with Madame la Marechale
de Fervaques.</p>

<p>She could hardly have been more seductive and charming with
them. After dinner they were joined by M. de Luz, M. de Caylus and
several of their friends. One would have said that Mademoiselle de
La Mole had resumed, together with the observance of sisterly
affection, that of the strictest conventions. Although the weather
that evening was charming, she insisted that they should not go out
to the garden; she was determined not to be lured away from the
armchair in which Madame de La Mole was enthroned. The blue sofa
was the centre of the group, as in winter.</p>

<p>Mathilde was out of humour with the garden, or at least it
seemed to her to be utterly boring: it was associated with the
memory of Julien.</p>

<p>Misery destroys judgment. Our hero made the blunder of clinging
to that little cane chair which in the past had witnessed such
brilliant triumphs. This evening, nobody spoke to him; his presence
passed as though unperceived or worse. Those of Mademoiselle de La
Mole's friends who were seated near him at the end of the sofa made
an affectation of turning their backs on him, or so he thought.</p>

<p>'It is a courtier's disgrace,' he concluded. He decided to study
for a moment the people who were trying to crush him with their
disdain.</p>

<p>M. de Luz's uncle held an important post in the King's
Household, the consequence of which was that this gallant officer
opened his conversation with each fresh arrival with the following
interesting detail: His uncle had set off at seven o'clock for
Saint-Cloud, and expected to spend the night there. This piece of
news was introduced in the most casual manner, but it never failed
to come out.</p>

<p>Upon observing M. de Croisenois with the severe eye of misery,
Julien remarked the enormous influence which this worthy and
amiable young man attributed to occult causes. So much so that he
became moody and cross if he heard an event of any importance set
down to a simple and quite natural cause. 'There is a trace of
madness there,' Julien told himself. 'This character bears a
striking resemblance to that of the Emperor Alexander, as Prince
Korasoff described him to me.' During the first year of his stay in
Paris, poor Julien, coming fresh from the Seminary, dazzled by the
graces, so novel to him, of all these agreeable young men, could do
nothing but admire them. Their true character was only now
beginning to outline itself before his eyes.</p>

<p>'I am playing an undignified part here,' he suddenly decided.
The next thing was how to leave his little cane chair in a fashion
that should not be too awkward. He tried to think of one, he called
for something original upon an imagination that was fully occupied
elsewhere. He was obliged to draw upon his memory, which, it must
be confessed, was by no means rich in resources of this order; the
boy was still a thorough novice, so that his awkwardness was
complete and attracted everyone's attention when he rose to leave
the drawing-room. Misery was all too evident in his whole
deportment. He had been playing the part for three quarters of an
hour of a troublesome inferior from whom people do not take the
trouble to conceal what they think of him.</p>

<p>The critical observations which he had been making at the
expense of his rivals prevented him, however, from taking his
misfortune too seriously; he retained, to give support to his
pride, the memory of what had occurred the night before last.
'Whatever the advantages they may have over me,' he thought as he
went into the garden by himself, 'Mathilde has not been to any of
them what, on two occasions in my life, she has deigned to be to
me.'</p>

<p>His sagacity went no farther. He failed entirely to understand
the character of the singular person whom chance had now made
absolute mistress of his whole happiness.</p>

<p>He devoted the next day to killing himself and his horse with
exhaustion. He made no further attempt, that evening, to approach
the blue sofa to which Mathilde was faithful. He remarked that
Comté Norbert did not so much as deign to look at him when they met
in the house. 'He must be making an extraordinary effort,' he
thought, 'he who is naturally so polite.'</p>

<p>For Julien, sleep would have meant happiness. Despite his bodily
exhaustion, memories of a too seductive kind began to invade his
whole imagination. He had not the intelligence to see that by his
long rides through the forests round Paris, acting only upon
himself and in no way upon the heart or mind of Mathilde, he was
leaving the arrangement of his destiny to chance.</p>

<p>It seemed to him that one thing would supply boundless comfort
to his grief: namely to speak to Mathilde. And yet what could he
venture to say to her?</p>

<p>This was the question upon which one morning at seven o'clock he
was pondering deeply, when suddenly he saw her enter the
library.</p>

<p>'I know, Sir, that you desire to speak to me.'</p>

<p>'Great God! Who told you that?'</p>

<p>'I know it, what more do you want? If you are lacking in honour,
you may ruin me, or at least attempt to do so; but this danger,
which I do not regard as real, will certainly not prevent me from
being sincere. I no longer love you, Sir; my wild imagination
misled me...'</p>

<p>On receiving this terrible blow, desperate with love and misery,
Julien tried to excuse himself. Nothing could be more absurd. Does
one excuse oneself for failing to please? But reason no longer held
any sway over his actions. A blind instinct urged him to postpone
the decision of his fate. It seemed to him that so long as he was
still speaking, nothing was definitely settled. Mathilde did not
listen to his words, the sound of them irritated her, she could not
conceive how he had the audacity to interrupt her.</p>

<p>The twofold remorse of her virtue and her pride made her, that
morning, equally unhappy. She was more or less crushed by the
frightful idea of having given certain rights over herself to a
little cleric, the son of a peasant. 'It is almost,' she told
herself in moments when she exaggerated her distress, 'as though I
had to reproach myself with a weakness for one of the footmen.'</p>

<p>In bold and proud natures, it is only a step from anger with
oneself to fury with other people; one's transports of rage are in
such circumstances a source of keen pleasure.</p>

<p>In a moment, Mademoiselle de La Mole reached the stage of
heaping on Julien the marks of the most intense scorn. She had
infinite cleverness, and this cleverness triumphed in the art of
torturing the self-esteem of others and inflicting cruel wounds
upon them.</p>

<p>For the first time in his life, Julien found himself subjected
to the action of a superior intelligence animated by the most
violent hatred of himself. So far from entertaining the slightest
idea of defending himself at that moment, he began to despise
himself. Hearing her heap upon him such cruel marks of scorn, so
cleverly calculated to destroy any good opinion that he might have
of himself, he felt that Mathilde was right, and that she was not
saying enough.</p>

<p>As for her, her pride found an exquisite pleasure in thus
punishing herself and him for the adoration which she had felt a
few days earlier.</p>

<p>She had no need to invent or to think for the first time of the
cruel words which she now uttered with such complacence. She was
only repeating what for the last week had been said in her heart by
the counsel of the opposite party to love.</p>

<p>Every word increased Julien's fearful misery an hundredfold. He
tried to escape, Mademoiselle de La Mole held him by the arm with a
gesture of authority.</p>

<p>'Please to observe,' he said to her, 'that you are speaking
extremely loud; they will hear you in the next room.'</p>

<p>'What of that!' Mademoiselle de La Mole retorted proudly, 'who
will dare to say to me that he has heard me? I wish to rid your
petty self-esteem for ever of the ideas which it may have formed of
me.'</p>

<p>When Julien was able to leave the library, he was so astounded
that he already felt his misery less keenly. 'Well! She no longer
loves me,' he repeated to himself, speaking aloud as though to
inform himself of his position. 'It appears that she loved me for a
week or ten days, and I shall love her all my life.</p>

<p>'Is it really possible, she meant nothing, nothing at all to my
heart, only a few days ago.'</p>

<p>The delights of satisfied pride flooded Mathilde's bosom; so she
had managed to break with him for ever! The thought of so complete
a triumph over so strong an inclination made her perfectly happy.
'And so this little gentleman will understand, and once for all,
that he has not and never will have any power over me.' She was so
happy that really she had ceased to feel any love at that
moment.</p>

<p>After so atrocious, so humiliating a scene, in anyone less
passionate than Julien, love would have become impossible. Without
departing for a single instant from what she owed to herself,
Mademoiselle de La Mole had addressed to him certain of those
disagreeable statements, so well calculated that they can appear to
be true, even when one remembers them in cold blood.</p>

<p>The conclusion that Julien drew at the first moment from so
astonishing a scene was that Mathilde had an unbounded pride. He
believed firmly that everything was at an end for ever between
them, and yet, the following day, at luncheon, he was awkward and
timid in her presence. This was a fault that could not have been
found with him until then. In small matters as in great, he knew
clearly what he ought and wished to do, and carried it out.</p>

<p>That day, after luncheon, when Madame de La Mole asked him for a
seditious and at the same time quite rare pamphlet, which her
parish priest had brought to her secretly that morning, Julien, in
taking it from a side table, knocked over an old vase of blue
porcelain, the ugliest thing imaginable.</p>

<p>Madame de La Mole rose to her feet with a cry of distress and
came across the room to examine the fragments of her beloved vase.
'It was old Japan,' she said, 'it came to me from my great-aunt the
Abbess of Chelles; it was a present from the Dutch to the Duke of
Orleans when he was Regent and he gave it to his daughter...'</p>

<p>Mathilde had followed her mother, delighted to see the
destruction of this blue vase which seemed to her horribly ugly.
Julien stood silent and not unduly distressed; he saw Mademoiselle
de La Mole standing close beside him.</p>

<p>'This vase,' he said to her, 'is destroyed for ever; so is it
with a sentiment which was once the master of my heart; I beg you
to accept my apologies for all the foolish things it has made me
do'; and he left the room.</p>

<p>'Really, one would think,' said Madame de La Mole as he went,
'that this M. Sorel is proud and delighted with what he has
done.'</p>

<p>This speech fell like a weight upon Mathilde's heart. 'It is
true,' she told herself, 'my mother has guessed aright, such is the
sentiment that is animating him.' Then and then only ended her joy
in the scene that she had made with him the day before. 'Ah, well,
all is at an end,' she said to herself with apparent calm; 'I am
left with a great example; my mistake has been fearful, degrading!
It will make me wise for all the rest of my life.'</p>

<p>'Was I not speaking the truth?' thought Julien; 'why does the
love that I felt for that madwoman torment me still?'</p>

<p>This love, so far from dying, as he hoped, was making rapid
strides. 'She is mad, it is true,' he said to himself, 'but is she
any less adorable? Is it possible for a girl to be more lovely?
Everything that the most elegant civilisation can offer in the way
of keen pleasures, was it not all combined to one's heart's content
in Mademoiselle de La Mole?' These memories of past happiness took
possession of Julien, and rapidly undid all the work of reason.</p>

<p>Reason struggles in vain against memories of this sort; its
stern endeavours serve only to enhance their charm.</p>

<p>Twenty-four hours after the breaking of the old Japanese vase,
Julien was decidedly one of the unhappiest of men.</p>

<h2><a name="ch51" id="ch51"></a>Chapter 51. The Secret Note</h2>

<p style="margin-left:10%">For I saw everything that I am telling
you; and if I<br>
may have been deceived when I saw it, I am most<br>
certainly not deceiving you in telling you of it.<br>
&mdash;From a Letter to the Author</p>

<p>The Marquis sent for him; M. de La Mole seemed rejuvenated,
there was a gleam in his eye.</p>

<p>'Let us hear a little about your memory,' he said to Julien. 'I
am told it is prodigious! Could you learn four pages by heart and
go and repeat them in London? But without altering a word!'</p>

<p>The Marquis was feverishly turning the pages of that morning's
<i>Quotidienne</i>, and seeking in vain to dissimulate a highly
serious air, which Julien had never seen him display, not even when
they were discussing the Frilair case.</p>

<p>Julien had by this time sufficient experience to feel that he
ought to appear thoroughly deceived by the light manner that was
being assumed for his benefit.</p>

<p>'This number of the <i>Quotidienne</i> is perhaps not very
amusing; but, if M. le Marquis will allow me, tomorrow morning I
shall have the honour to recite it to him from beginning to
end.'</p>

<p>'What! Even the advertisements?'</p>

<p>'Literally, and without missing a word.'</p>

<p>'Do you give me your word for that?' went on the Marquis with a
sudden gravity.</p>

<p>'Yes, Sir, only the fear of not keeping it might upset my
memory.'</p>

<p>'What I mean is that I forgot to ask you this question
yesterday; I do not ask you on your oath never to repeat what you
are about to hear; I know you too well to insult you in that way. I
have answered for you, I am going to take you to a room where there
will be twelve persons assembled; you will take note of what each
of them says.</p>

<p>'Do not be uneasy, it is not going to be a confused
conversation, each one will speak in his turn, I do not mean a set
speech,' the Marquis went on, resuming the tone of careless
superiority which came so naturally to him. 'While we are talking,
you will write down twenty pages or so; you will return here with
me, we shall cut down those twenty pages to four. It is those four
pages that you shall recite to me tomorrow morning instead of the
whole number of the <i>Quotidienne</i>. You will then set off at
once; you will have to take post like a young man who is travelling
for his pleasure. Your object will be to pass unobserved by anyone.
You will arrive in the presence of a great personage. There, you
will require more skill. It will be a question of taking in
everyone round him; for among his secretaries, among his servants,
there are men in the pay of our enemies, who lie in wait for our
agents to intercept them. You shall have a formal letter of
introduction. When His Excellency looks at you, you will take out
my watch here, which I am going to lend you for the journey. Take
it now, while you are about it, and give me yours.</p>

<p>'The Duke himself will condescend to copy out at your dictation
the four pages which you will have learned by heart.</p>

<p>'When this has been done, but not before, remember, you may, if
His Excellency questions you, give him an account of the meeting
which you are now about to attend.</p>

<p>'One thing that will prevent you from feeling bored on your
jorney is that between Paris and the residence of the Minister
there are people who would ask for nothing better than to fire a
shot at M. l'abbe Sorel. Then his mission is at an end and I
foresee a long delay; for, my dear fellow, how shall we hear of
your death? Your zeal cannot go so far as to inform us of it.</p>

<p>'Run off at once and buy yourself a complete outfit,' the
Marquis went on with a serious air. 'Dress in the style of the year
before last. This evening you will have to look a little shabby. On
the journey, however, you will dress as usual. Does that surprise
you, does your suspicious mind guess the reason? Yes, my friend,
one of the venerable personages whom you are about to hear discuss
is fully capable of transmitting information by means of which
someone may quite possibly administer opium to you, if nothing
worse, in the evening, in some respectable inn at which you will
have called for supper.'</p>

<p>'It would be better,' said Julien, 'to travel thirty leagues
farther and avoid the direct route. My destination is Rome, I
suppose...'</p>

<p>The Marquis assumed an air of haughty displeasure which Julien
had not seen to so marked a degree since Bray-le-Haut.</p>

<p>'That is what you shall learn, Sir, when I think fit to tell
you. I do not like questions.'</p>

<p>'It was not a question,' replied Julien effusively: 'I swear to
you, Sir, I was thinking aloud, I was seeking in my own mind the
safest route.'</p>

<p>'Yes, it seems that your thoughts were far away. Never forget
that an ambassador, one of your youth especially, ought not to
appear to be forcing confidences.'</p>

<p>Julien was greatly mortified, he was in the wrong. His
self-esteem sought for an excuse and could find none.</p>

<p>'Understand then,' M. de La Mole went on, 'that people always
appeal to their hearts when they have done something foolish.'</p>

<p>An hour later, Julien was in the Marquis's waiting-room in the
garb of an inferior, with old-fashioned clothes, a doubtfully clean
neckcloth and something distinctly smug about his whole
appearance.</p>

<p>At the sight of him, the Marquis burst out laughing, and then
only was Julien's apology accepted.</p>

<p>'If this young man betrays me,' M. de La Mole asked himself,
'whom can I trust? And yet when it comes to action, one has to
trust somebody. My son and his brilliant friends of the same kidney
have honest hearts, and loyalty enough for a hundred thousand; if
it were a question of fighting, they would perish on the steps of
the throne, they know everything... except just what is required at
the moment. Devil take me if I can think of one of them who could
learn four pages by heart and travel a hundred leagues without
being tracked. Norbert would know how to let himself be killed like
his ancestors, but any conscript can do that...'</p>

<p>The Marquis fell into a profound meditation: 'And even being
killed,' he said with a sigh, 'perhaps this Sorel would manage that
as well as he...</p>

<p>'The carriage is waiting,' said the Marquis, as though to banish
a vexatious thought.</p>

<p>'Sir,' said Julien, 'while they were altering this coat for me,
I committed to memory the first page of today's
<i>Quotidienne</i>.'</p>

<p>The Marquis took the paper, Julien repeated the page without a
single mistake. 'Good,' said the Marquis, every inch the diplomat
that evening; 'meanwhile this young man is not observing the
streets through which we are passing.'</p>

<p>They arrived in a large room of a distinctly gloomy aspect,
partly panelled and partly hung in green velvet. In the middle of
the room, a scowling footman had just set up a large dinner-table,
which he proceeded to convert into a writing table, by means of an
immense green cloth covered with ink stains, a relic of some
Ministry.</p>

<p>The master of the house was a corpulent man whose name was never
uttered; Julien decided that his expression and speech were those
of a man engaged in digestion.</p>

<p>At a sign from the Marquis, Julien had remained at the lower end
of the table. To avoid drawing attention to himself he began to
point the quills. He counted out of the corner of his eye seven
speakers, but he could see nothing more of them than their backs.
Two of them appeared to him to be addressing M. de La Mole on terms
of equality, the others seemed more or less deferential.</p>

<p>Another person entered the room unannounced. 'This is strange,'
thought Julien, 'no one is announced in this room. Can this
precaution have been taken in my honour?' Everyone rose to receive
the newcomer. He was wearing the same extremely distinguished
decoration as three of the men who were already in the room. They
spoke in low tones. In judging the newcomer, Julien was restricted
to what he could learn from his features and dress. He was short
and stout, with a high complexion and a gleaming eye devoid of any
expression beyond the savage glare of a wild boar.</p>

<p>Julien's attention was sharply distracted by the almost
immediate arrival of a wholly different person. This was a tall
man, extremely thin and wearing three or four waistcoats. His eye
was caressing, his gestures polished.</p>

<p>'That is just the expression of the old Bishop of Besançon,'
thought Julien. This man evidently belonged to the Church, he did
not appear to be more than fifty or fifty-five, no one could have
looked more fatherly.</p>

<p>The young Bishop of Agde appeared, and seemed greatly surprised
when, in making a survey of those present, his eye rested on
Julien. He had not spoken to him since the ceremony at
Bray-le-Haut. His look of surprise embarrassed and irritated
Julien. 'What,' the latter said to himself, 'is knowing a man to be
always to my disadvantage? All these great gentlemen whom I have
never seen before do not frighten me in the least, and the look in
this young Bishop's eyes freezes me! It must be admitted that I am
a very strange and very unfortunate creature.'</p>

<p>A small and extremely dark man presently made a noisy entrance,
and began speaking from the door; he had a sallow complexion and a
slightly eccentric air. On the arrival of this pitiless talker,
groups began to form, apparently to escape the boredom of listening
to him.</p>

<p>As they withdrew from the fireplace they drew near to the lower
end of the table, where Julien was installed. His expression became
more and more embarrassed, for now at last, in spite of all his
efforts, he could not avoid hearing them, and however slight his
experience might be, he realised the full importance of the matters
that were being discussed without any attempt at concealment; and
yet how careful the evidently exalted personages whom he saw before
him ought to be to keep them secret.</p>

<p>Already, working as slowly as possible, Julien had pointed a
score of quills; this resource must soon fail him. He looked in
vain for an order in the eyes of M. de La Mole; the Marquis had
forgotten him.</p>

<p>'What I am doing is absurd,' thought Julien as he pointed his
pens; 'but people who are so commonplace in appearance, and are
entrusted by others or by themselves with such high interests, must
be highly susceptible. My unfortunate expression has a questioning
and scarcely respectful effect which would doubtless annoy them. If
I lower my eyes too far I shall appear to be making a record of
their talk.'</p>

<p>His embarrassment was extreme, he was hearing some strange
things said.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch52" id="ch52"></a>Chapter 52. The Discussion</h2>

<p style="margin-left:10%">The republic&mdash;for every person today
willing to sacrifice<br>
all to the common good, there are thousands and millions<br>
who know only their own pleasures and their vanity. One<br>
is esteemed in Paris for one's carriage, not for one's virtue.<br>
&mdash;NAPOLEON, <i>Memorial</i></p>

<p>The footman burst in, announcing: 'Monsieur le Duc de
&mdash;&mdash;.'</p>

<p>'Hold your tongue, you fool,' said the Duke as he entered the
room. He said this so well, and with such majesty that Julien could
not help thinking that knowing how to lose his temper with a
footman was the whole extent of this great personage's knowledge.
Julien raised his eyes and at once lowered them again. He had so
clearly divined the importance of this new arrival that he trembled
lest his glance should be thought an indiscretion.</p>

<p>This Duke was a man of fifty, dressed like a dandy, and treading
as though on springs. He had a narrow head with a large nose, and a
curved face which he kept thrusting forward. It would have been
hard for anyone to appear at once so noble and so insignificant.
His coming was a signal for the opening of the discussion.</p>

<p>Julien was sharply interrupted in his physiognomical studies by
the voice of M. de La Mole. 'Let me present to you M. l'abbe
Sorel,' said the Marquis. 'He is endowed with an astonishing
memory; it was only an hour ago that I spoke to him of the mission
with which he might perhaps be honoured, and, in order to furnish
us with a proof of his memory, he has learned by heart the first
page of the <i>Quotidienne</i>.'</p>

<p>'Ah! The foreign news, from poor N &mdash;&mdash;,' said the
master of the house. He picked up the paper eagerly and, looking at
Julien with a whimsical air, in the effort to appear important:
'Begin, Sir,' he said to him.</p>

<p>The silence was profound, every eye was fixed on Julien; he
repeated his lesson so well that after twenty lines: 'That will
do,' said the Duke. The little man with the boar's eyes sat down.
He was the chairman for, as soon as he had taken his place, he
indicated a card table to Julien, and made a sign to him to bring
it up to his side. Julien established himself there with writing
materials. He counted twelve people seated round the green
cloth.</p>

<p>'M. Sorel,' said the Duke, 'retire to the next room. We shall
send for you.'</p>

<p>The master of the house assumed an uneasy expression. 'The
shutters are not closed,' he murmured to his neighbour. 'It is no
use your looking out of the window,' he foolishly exclaimed to
Julien. 'Here I am thrust into a conspiracy at the very least,' was
the latter's thought. 'Fortunately, it is not one of the kind that
end on the Place de Greve. Even if there were danger, I owe that
and more to the Marquis. I should be fortunate, were it granted me
to atone for all the misery which my follies may one day cause
him!'</p>

<p>Without ceasing to think of his follies and of his misery, he
studied his surroundings in such a way that he could never forget
them. Only then did he remember that he had not heard the Marquis
tell his footman the name of the street, and the Marquis had sent
for a cab, a thing he never did.</p>

<p>Julien was left for a long time to his reflections. He was in a
parlour hung in green velvet with broad stripes of gold. There was
on the side-table a large ivory crucifix, and on the mantelpiece
the book <i>Du Pape</i>, by M. de Maistre, with gilt edges, and
magnificently bound. Julien opened it so as not to appear to be
eavesdropping. Every now and then there was a sound of raised
voices from the next room. At length the door opened, his name was
called.</p>

<p>'Remember, Gentlemen,' said the chairman, 'that from this moment
we are addressing the Duc de &mdash;&mdash;. This gentleman,' he
said, pointing to Julien, 'is a young Levite, devoted to our sacred
cause, who will have no difficulty in repeating, thanks to his
astonishing memory, our most trivial words.</p>

<p>'Monsieur has the floor,' he said, indicating the personage with
the fatherly air, who was wearing three or four waistcoats. Julien
felt that it would have been more natural to call him the gentleman
with the waistcoats. He supplied himself with paper and wrote
copiously.</p>

<p>(Here the author would have liked to insert a page of dots.
'That will not look pretty,' says the publisher, 'and for so
frivolous a work not to look pretty means death.'</p>

<p>'Politics,' the author resumes, 'are a stone attached to the
neck of literature, which, in less than six months, drowns it.
Politics in the middle of imaginative interests are like a
pistol-shot in the middle of a concert. The noise is deafening
without being emphatic. It is not in harmony with the sound of any
of the instruments. This mention of politics is going to give
deadly offence to half my readers, and to bore the other half, who
have already found far more interesting and emphatic politics in
their morning paper.'</p>

<p>'If your characters do not talk politics,' the publisher
retorts, 'they are no longer Frenchmen of 1830, and your book
ceases to hold a mirror, as you claim...')</p>

<p>Julien's report amounted to twenty-six pages; the following is a
quite colourless extract; for I have been obliged, as usual, to
suppress the absurdities, the frequency of which would have
appeared tedious or highly improbable. (Compare the <i>Gazette des
Tribunaux</i>. )</p>

<p>The man with the waistcoats and the fatherly air (he was a
Bishop, perhaps), smiled often, and then his eyes, between their
tremulous lids, assumed a strange brilliance and an expression less
undecided than was his wont. This personage, who was invited to
speak first, before the Duke ('but what Duke?' Julien asked
himself), apparently to express opinions and to perform the
functions of Attorney General, appeared to Julien to fall into the
uncertainty and absence of definite conclusions with which those
officers are often reproached. In the course of the discussion the
Duke went so far as to rebuke him for this.</p>

<p>After several phrases of morality and indulgent philosophy, the
man with the waistcoats said:</p>

<p>'Noble England, guided by a great man, the immortal Pitt, spent
forty thousand million francs in destroying the Revolution. If this
assembly will permit me to express somewhat boldly a melancholy
reflection, England does not sufficiently understand that with a
man like Bonaparte, especially when one had had to oppose to him
only a collection of good intentions, there was nothing decisive
save personal measures...'</p>

<p>'Ah! Praise of assassination again!' said the master of the
house with an uneasy air.</p>

<p>'Spare us your sentimental homilies,' exclaimed the chairman
angrily; his boar's eye gleamed with a savage light. 'Continue,' he
said to the man with the waistcoats. The chairman's cheeks and brow
turned purple.</p>

<p>'Noble England,' the speaker went on, 'is crushed today, for
every Englishman, before paying for his daily bread, is obliged to
pay the interest on the forty thousand million francs which were
employed against the Jacobins. She has no longer a Pitt...'</p>

<p>'She has the Duke of Wellington,' said a military personage who
assumed an air of great importance.</p>

<p>'Silence, please, Gentlemen,' cried the chairman; 'if we
continue to disagree, there will have been no use in our sending
for M. Sorel.'</p>

<p>'We know that Monsieur is full of ideas,' said the Duke with an
air of vexation and a glance at the interrupter, one of Napoleon's
Generals. Julien saw that this was an allusion to something
personal and highly offensive. Everyone smiled; the turncoat
General seemed beside himself with rage.</p>

<p>'There is no longer a Pitt,' the speaker went on, with the
discouraged air of a man who despairs of making his hearers listen
to reason. 'Were there a fresh Pitt in England, one does not
hoodwink a nation twice by the same means...'</p>

<p>'That is why a conquering General, a Bonaparte is impossible now
in France,' cried the military interrupter.</p>

<p>On this occasion, neither the chairman nor the Duke dared show
annoyance, though Julien thought he could read in their eyes that
they were tempted to do so. They lowered their eyes, and the Duke
contented himself with a sigh loud enough to be audible to them
all.</p>

<p>But the speaker had lost his temper.</p>

<p>'You are in a hurry for me to conclude,' he said with heat,
entirely discarding that smiling politeness and measured speech
which Julien had assumed to be the natural expression of his
character: 'you are in a hurry for me to conclude; you give me no
credit for the efforts that I am making not to offend the ears of
anyone present, however long they may be. Very well, Gentlemen, I
shall be brief.</p>

<p>'And I shall say to you in the plainest of words: England has
not a halfpenny left for the service of the good cause. Were Pitt
to return in person, with all his genius he would not succeed in
hoodwinking the small landowners of England, for they know that the
brief campaign of Waterloo cost them, by itself, one thousand
million francs. Since you wish for plain speaking,' the speaker
added, growing more and more animated, 'I shall say to you: Help
yourselves, for England has not a guinea for your assistance, and
if England does not pay, Austria, Russia, Prussia, which have only
courage and no money, cannot support more than one campaign or two
against France.</p>

<p>'You may hope that the young soldiers collected by Jacobinism
will be defeated in the first campaign, in the second perhaps; but
in the third (though I pass for a revolutionary in your prejudiced
eyes), in the third you will have the soldiers of 1794, who were no
longer the recruited peasants of 1792.'</p>

<p>Here the interruption broke out in three or four places at
once.</p>

<p>'Sir,' said the chairman to Julien, 'go and make a fair copy in
the next room of the first part of the report which you have taken
down.' Julien left the room with considerable regret. The speaker
had referred to probabilities which formed the subject of his
habitual meditations.</p>

<p>'They are afraid of my laughing at them,' he thought. When he
was recalled, M. de La Mole was saying, with an earnestness, which,
to Julien, who knew him, seemed highly amusing:</p>

<p>'Yes, Gentlemen, it is above all of this unhappy race that one
can say: "Shall it be a god, a table or a bowl?"</p>

<p>'"<i>It shall be a god</i>!" cries the poet. It is to you,
Gentlemen, that this saying, so noble and so profound, seems to
apply. Act for yourselves, and our noble France will reappear more
or less as our ancestors made her and as our own eyes beheld her
before the death of Louis XVI.</p>

<p>'England, her noble Lords at least, curses as heartily as we
ignoble Jacobinism: without English gold, Austria, Russia, Prussia
cannot fight more than two or three battles. Will that suffice to
bring about a glorious occupation, like that which M. de Richelieu
squandered so stupidly in 1817? I do not think so.'</p>

<p>At this point an interruption occurred, but it was silenced by a
general murmur. It arose once more from the former Imperial
General, who desired the Blue Riband, and was anxious to appear
among the compilers of the secret note.</p>

<p>'I do not think so,' M. de La Mole resumed after the
disturbance. He dwelt upon the word 'I' with an insolence which
charmed Julien. 'That is well played,' he said to himself as he
made his pen fly almost as fast as the Marquis's utterance. With a
well-placed word, M. de La Mole annihilated the twenty campaigns of
the turncoat.</p>

<p>'It is not to foreigners alone,' the Marquis continued in the
most measured tone, 'that we can remain indebted for a fresh
military occupation. That youthful band who contribute incendiary
articles to the <i>Globe</i> will provide you with three or four
thousand young captains, among whom may be found a Kleber, a Hoche,
a Jourdan, a Pichegru, but less well-intentioned.'</p>

<p>'We did wrong in not crowning him with glory,' said the
chairman, 'we ought to have made him immortal.'</p>

<p>'There must, in short, be two parties in France,' went on M. de
La Mole, 'but two parties, not in name only, two parties clearly
defined, sharply divided. Let us be certain whom we have to crush.
On one side the journalists, the electors, public opinion; in a
word, youth and all those who admire it. While it is dazed by the
sound of its own idle words, we, we have the certain advantage of
handling the budget.'</p>

<p>Here came a fresh interruption.</p>

<p>'You, Sir,' M. de La Mole said to the interrupter with a
supercilious ease that was quite admirable, 'you do not handle,
since the word appears to shock you, you devour forty thousand
francs borne on the state budget and eighty thousand which you
receive from the Civil List.</p>

<p>'Very well, Sir, since you force me to it, I take you boldly as
an example. Like your noble ancestors who followed Saint Louis to
the Crusade, you ought, for those hundred and twenty thousand
francs, to let us see at least a regiment, a company, shall I say a
half-company, were it composed only of fifty men ready to fight,
and devoted to the good cause, alive or dead. You have only footmen
who, in the event of a revolt, would frighten nobody but
yourself.</p>

<p>The Throne, the Altar, the Nobility may perish any day,
Gentlemen, so long as you have not created in each Department a
force of five hundred devoted men; devoted, I mean, not only with
all the gallantry of France but with the constancy of Spain.</p>

<p>'One half of this troop will have to be composed of our sons,
our nephews, in short of true gentlemen. Each of them will have by
his side, not a glib little cockney ready to hoist the striped
cockade if another 1815 should arrive, but an honest peasant,
simple and open like Cathelineau; our gentleman will have trained
him, it should be his foster-brother, if possible. Let each of us
sacrifice the fifth part of his income to form this little devoted
troop of five hundred men to a Department. Then you may count upon
a foreign occupation. Never will the foreign soldier cross our
borders as far as Dijon even, unless he is certain of finding five
hundred friendly soldiers in each Department.</p>

<p>'The foreign Kings will listen to you only when you can inform
them that there are twenty thousand gentlemen ready to take up arms
to open to them the gates of France. This service is arduous, you
will say. Gentlemen, it is the price of our heads. Between the
liberty of the press and our existence as gentlemen, there is war
to the knife. Become manufacturers, peasants, or take up your guns.
Be timid if you like, but do not be stupid. Open your eyes.</p>

<p>'<i>Form your battalions</i>, I say to you, in the words of the
Jacobin song; then there will appear some noble Gustavus-Adolphus,
who, moved by the imminent peril to the monarchical principle will
come flying three hundred leagues beyond his borders, and do for
you what Gustavus did for the Protestant princes. Do you propose to
go on talking without acting? In fifty years there will be nothing
in Europe but Presidents of Republics, not one King left. And with
those four letters K-I-N-G, go the priests and the gentlemen. I can
see nothing but <i>candidates</i> paying court to draggletailed
<i>majorities</i>.</p>

<p>'It is no use your saying that France has not at this moment a
trustworthy General, known and loved by all, that the army is
organised only in the interests of Throne and Altar, that all the
old soldiers have been discharged from it, whereas each of the
Prussian and Austrian regiments includes fifty non-commissioned
officers who have been under fire.</p>

<p>'Two hundred thousand young men of the middle class are in love
with the idea of war...'</p>

<p>'Enough unpleasant truths,' came in a tone of importance from a
grave personage, apparently high on the ladder of ecclesiastical
preferment, for M. de La Mole smiled pleasantly instead of showing
annoyance, which was highly significant to Julien.</p>

<p>'Enough unpleasant truths; Gentlemen, to sum up: the man with
whom it was a question of amputating his gangrened leg would be
ill-advised to say to his surgeon: this diseased leg is quite
sound. Pardon me the simile, Gentlemen, the noble Duke of
&mdash;&mdash; is our surgeon.' [Trans. footnote: The Duke of
Wellington. C. K. S. M.]</p>

<p>'There is the great secret out at last,' thought Julien; 'it is
to the &mdash;&mdash; that I shall be posting tonight.'</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch53" id="ch53"></a>Chapter 53. The Clergy, their
Forests, Liberty</h2>

<p style="margin-left:10%">The first law for every creature is that
of<br>
self-preservation, of life. You sow hemlock,<br>
and expect to see the corn ripen!<br>
&mdash;MACHIAVELLI</p>

<p>The grave personage continued; one could see that he knew; he
set forth with a gentle and moderate eloquence, which vastly
delighted Julien, the following great truths:</p>

<p>(1) England has not a guinea at our service; economy and Hume
are the fashion there. Even the Saints will not give us any money,
and Mr Brougham will laugh at us.</p>

<p>(2,) Impossible to obtain more than two campaigns from the
Monarchs of Europe, without English gold; and two campaigns will
not be enough against the middle classes.</p>

<p>(3) Necessity of forming an armed party in France, otherwise the
monarchical principle in the rest of Europe will not risk even
those two campaigns.</p>

<p>'The fourth point which I venture to suggest to you as
self-evident is this:</p>

<p>'<i>The impossibility of forming an armed party in France
without the Clergy</i>. I say it to you boldly, because I am going
to prove it to you, Gentlemen. We must give the Clergy
everything:</p>

<p>'(i) Because, occupying themselves with their own business night
and day, and guided by men of high capacity established out of
harm's way three hundred leagues from your frontiers...'</p>

<p>'Ah! Rome! Rome!' exclaimed the master of the house...</p>

<p>'Yes, Sir, <i>Rome</i>!' the Cardinal answered proudly.
'Whatever be the more or less ingenious pleasantries which were in
fashion when you were young, I will proclaim boldly, in 1830, that
the Clergy, guided by Rome, speak and speak alone to the lower
orders.</p>

<p>'Fifty thousand priests repeat the same words on the day
indicated by their leaders, and the people, who, after all, furnish
the soldiers, will be more stirred by the voice of their priests
than by all the cheap poems in the world...' (This personal
allusion gave rise to murmurs.)</p>

<p>'The Clergy have an intellect superior to yours,' the Cardinal
went on, raising his voice; 'all the steps that you have taken
towards this essential point, <i>having an armed party here in
France</i>, have been taken by us.' Here facts were cited. Who had
sent eighty thousand muskets to the Vendee? and so forth.</p>

<p>'So long as the Clergy are deprived of their forests, they have
no tenure. At the first threat of war, the Minister of Finance
writes to his agents that there is no more money except for the
parish priests. At heart, France is not religious, and loves war.
Whoever it be that gives her war, he will be doubly popular, for to
make war is to starve the Jesuits, in vulgar parlance; to make war
is to deliver those monsters of pride, the French people, from the
menace of foreign intervention.'</p>

<p>The Cardinal had a favourable hearing...'It was essential,' he
said, 'that M. de Nerval should leave the Ministry, his name caused
needless irritation.'</p>

<p>Upon this, they all rose to their feet and began speaking at
once. 'They will be sending me out of the room again,' thought
Julien; but the prudent chairman himself had forgotten Julien's
presence and indeed his existence.</p>

<p>Every eye turned to a man whom Julien recognised. It was M. de
Nerval, the First Minister, whom he had seen at the Duc de Retz's
ball.</p>

<p><i>The disorder was at its height</i>, as the newspapers say,
when reporting the sittings of the Chamber. After fully a quarter
of an hour, silence began to be restored.</p>

<p>Then M. de Nerval rose and, adopting the tone of an Apostle:</p>

<p>'I shall not for one moment pretend,' he said, in an unnatural
voice, 'that I am not attached to office.</p>

<p>'It has been proved to me, Gentlemen, that my name doubles the
strength of the Jacobins by turning against us a number of moderate
men. I should willingly resign, therefore; but the ways of the Lord
are visible to but a small number; but,' he went on, looking
fixedly at the Cardinal, 'I have a mission; heaven has said to me:
"You shall lay down your head on the scaffold, or you shall
reestablish the Monarchy in France, and reduce the Chambers to what
Parliament was under Louis XV," and that, Gentlemen, <i>I will
do</i>.'</p>

<p>He ceased, sat down, and a great silence fell.</p>

<p>'There is a good actor,' thought Julien. He made the mistake,
then as always, of crediting people with too much cleverness.</p>

<p>Animated by the debates of so lively an evening, and above all
by the sincerity of the discussion, at that moment M. de Nerval
believed in his mission. With his great courage the man did not
combine any sense.</p>

<p>Midnight struck during the silence that followed the fine
peroration '<i>that I will do</i>'. Julien felt that there was
something imposing and funereal in the sound of the clock. He was
deeply moved.</p>

<p>The discussion soon began again with increasing energy and above
all with an incredible simplicity. 'These men will have me
poisoned,' thought Julien, at certain points. 'How can they say
such things before a plebeian?'</p>

<p>Two o'clock struck while they were still talking. The master of
the house had long been asleep; M. de La Mole was obliged to ring
to have fresh candles brought in. M. de Nerval, the Minister, had
left at a quarter to two, not without having frequently studied
Julien's face in a mirror which hung beside him. His departure had
seemed to create an atmosphere of relief.</p>

<p>While the candles were being changed: 'Heaven knows what that
fellow is going to say to the King!' the man with the waistcoats
murmured to his neighbour. 'He can make us look very foolish and
spoil our future.</p>

<p>'You must admit that he shows a very rare presumption, indeed
effrontery, in appearing here. He used to come here before he took
office; but a portfolio alters everything, swallows up all a man's
private interests, he ought to have felt that.'</p>

<p>As soon as the Minister was gone, Bonaparte's General had shut
his eyes. He now spoke of his health, his wounds, looked at his
watch, and left.</p>

<p>'I would bet,' said the man with the waistcoats, 'that the
General is running after the Minister; he is going to make his
excuses for being found here, and pretend that he is our
leader.'</p>

<p>When the servants, who were half asleep, had finished changing
the candles:</p>

<p>'Let us now begin to deliberate, Gentlemen,' said the chairman,
'and no longer attempt to persuade one another. Let us consider the
tenor of the note that in forty-eight hours will be before the eyes
of our friends abroad. There has been reference to Ministers. We
can say, now that M. de Nerval has left us, what do we care for
Ministers? We shall control them.'</p>

<p>The Cardinal showed his approval by a delicate smile.</p>

<p>'Nothing easier, it seems to me, than to sum up our position,'
said the young Bishop of Agde with the concentrated and restrained
fire of the most exalted fanaticism. Hitherto he had remained
silent; his eye, which Julien had watched, at first mild and calm,
had grown fiery after the first hour's discussion. Now his heart
overflowed like lava from Vesuvius.</p>

<p>'From 1806 to 1814, England made only one mistake,' he said,
'which was her not dealing directly and personally with Napoleon.
As soon as that man had created Dukes and Chamberlains, as soon as
he had restored the Throne, the mission that God had entrusted to
him was at an end; he was ripe only for destruction. The Holy
Scriptures teach us in more than one passage the way to make an end
of tyrants.' (Here followed several Latin quotations.)</p>

<p>'Today, Gentlemen, it is not a man that we must destroy; it is
Paris. The whole of France copies Paris. What is the use of arming
your five hundred men in each Department? A hazardous enterprise
and one that will never end. What is the use of involving France in
a matter which is peculiar to Paris? Paris alone, with her
newspapers and her drawing-rooms, has done the harm; let the modern
Babylon perish.</p>

<p>'Between the Altar and Paris, there must be a fight to the
finish. This catastrophe is indeed to the earthly advantage of the
Throne. Why did not Paris dare to breathe under Bonaparte? Ask the
artillery of Saint-Roch.'</p>

<p>* * *</p>

<p>It was not until three o'clock in the morning that Julien left
the house with M. de La Mole.</p>

<p>The Marquis was depressed and tired. For the first time, in
speaking to Julien, he used a tone of supplication. He asked him to
promise never to disclose the excesses of zeal, such was his
expression, which he had chanced to witness. 'Do not mention it to
our friend abroad, unless he deliberately insists on knowing the
nature of our young hotheads. What does it matter to them if the
State be overthrown? They will be Cardinals, and will take refuge
in Rome. We, in our country seats, shall be massacred by the
peasants.'</p>

<p>The secret note which the Marquis drafted from the long report
of six and twenty pages, written by Julien, was not ready until a
quarter to five.</p>

<p>'I am dead tired,' said the Marquis, 'and so much can be seen
from this note, which is lacking in precision towards the end; I am
more dissatisfied with it than with anything I ever did in my life.
Now, my friend,' he went on, 'go and lie down for a few hours, and
for fear of your being abducted, I am going to lock you into your
room.'</p>

<p>Next day, the Marquis took Julien to a lonely mansion, at some
distance from Paris. They found there a curious company who, Julien
decided, were priests. He was given a passport which bore a false
name, but did at last indicate the true goal of his journey, of
which he had always feigned ignorance. He started off by himself in
a calash.</p>

<p>The Marquis had no misgivings as to his memory, Julien had
repeated the text of the secret note to him several times; but he
was greatly afraid of his being intercepted.</p>

<p>'Remember, whatever you do, to look like a fop who is travelling
to kill time,' was his friendly warning, as Julien was leaving the
room. 'There may perhaps have been several false brethren in our
assembly last night.'</p>

<p>The journey was rapid and very tedious. Julien was barely out of
the Marquis's sight before he had forgotten both the secret note
and his mission, and was thinking of nothing but Mathilde's
scorn.</p>

<p>In a village, some leagues beyond Metz, the postmaster came to
inform him that there were no fresh horses. It was ten o'clock at
night; Julien, greatly annoyed, ordered supper. He strolled up and
down outside the door and passed unperceived into the stable-yard.
He saw no horses there.</p>

<p>'The man had a singular expression all the same,' he said to
himself; 'his coarse eye was scrutinising me.'</p>

<p>We can see that he was beginning not to believe literally
everything that he was told. He thought of making his escape after
supper, and in the meanwhile, in order to learn something of the
lie of the land, left his room to go and warm himself by the
kitchen fire. What was his joy upon finding there Signor Geronimo,
the famous singer!</p>

<p>Comfortably ensconced in an armchair which he had made them push
up close to the fire, the Neapolitan was groaning aloud and talking
more, by himself, than the score of German peasants who were
gathered round him open-mouthed.</p>

<p>'These people are ruining me,' he cried to Julien, 'I have
promised to sing tomorrow at Mayence. Seven Sovereign Princes have
assembled there to hear me. But let us take the air,' he added, in
a significant tone.</p>

<p>When he had gone a hundred yards along the road, and was well
out of earshot:</p>

<p>'Do you know what is happening?' he said to Julien; 'this
postmaster is a rogue. As I was strolling about, I gave a franc to
a little ragamuffin who told me everything. There are more than a
dozen horses in a stable at the other end of the village. They mean
to delay some courier.'</p>

<p>'Indeed?' said Julien, with an innocent air.</p>

<p>It was not enough to have discovered the fraud, they must get
on: this was what Geronimo and his friend could not manage to do.
'We must wait for the daylight,' the singer said finally, 'they are
suspicious of us. Tomorrow morning we shall order a good breakfast;
while they are preparing it we go out for a stroll, we escape, hire
fresh horses, and reach the next post.'</p>

<p>'And your luggage?' said Julien, who thought that perhaps
Geronimo himself might have been sent to intercept him. It was time
to sup and retire to bed. Julien was still in his first sleep, when
he was awakened with a start by the sound of two people talking in
his room, apparently quite unconcerned.</p>

<p>He recognised the postmaster, armed with a dark lantern. Its
light was concentrated upon the carriage-trunk, which Julien had
had carried up to his room. With the postmaster was another man who
was calmly going through the open trunk. Julien could make out only
the sleeves of his coat, which were black and close-fitting.</p>

<p>'It is a cassock,' he said to himself, and quietly seized the
pocket pistols which he had placed under his pillow.</p>

<p>'You need not be afraid of his waking, Monsieur le curé,' said
the postmaster. 'The wine we gave them was some of what you
prepared yourself.'</p>

<p>'I can find no trace of papers,' replied the curé. 'Plenty of
linen, oils, pomades and fripperies; he is a young man of the
world, occupied with his own pleasures. The envoy will surely be
the other, who pretends to speak with an Italian accent.'</p>

<p>The men came up to Julien to search the pockets of his
travelling coat. He was strongly tempted to kill them as robbers.
This could involve no dangerous consequences. He longed to do
it...'I should be a mere fool,' he said to himself, 'I should be
endangering my mission.' After searching his coat, 'this is no
diplomat,' said the priest: he moved away, and wisely.</p>

<p>'If he touches me in my bed, it will be the worse for him!'
Julien was saying to himself; 'he may quite well come and stab me,
and that I will not allow.'</p>

<p>The curé turned his head, Julien half-opened his eyes; what was
his astonishment! It was the abbe Castanede! And indeed, although
the two men had tried to lower their voices, he had felt, from the
first, that he recognised the sound of one of them. He was seized
with a passionate desire to rid the world of one of its vilest
scoundrels...</p>

<p>'But my mission!' he reminded himself.</p>

<p>The priest and his acolyte left the room. A quarter of an hour
later, Julien pretended to awake. He called for help and roused the
whole house.</p>

<p>'I have been poisoned,' he cried, 'I am in horrible agony!' He
wanted a pretext for going to Geronimo's rescue. He found him half
asphyxiated by the laudanum that had been in his wine.</p>

<p>Julien, fearing some pleasantry of this kind, had supped upon
chocolate which he had brought with him from Paris. He could not
succeed in arousing Geronimo sufficiently to make him agree to
leave the place.</p>

<p>'Though you offered me the whole Kingdom of Naples,' said the
singer, 'I would not forgo the pleasure of sleep at this
moment.'</p>

<p>'But the seven Sovereign Princes!'</p>

<p>'They can wait.'</p>

<p>Julien set off alone and arrived without further incident at the
abode of the eminent personage. He spent a whole morning in vainly
soliciting an audience. Fortunately, about four o'clock, the Duke
decided to take the air. Julien saw him leave the house on foot,
and had no hesitation in going up to him and begging for alms. When
within a few feet of the eminent personage, he drew out the Marquis
de La Mole's watch, and flourished it ostentatiously. 'Follow me at
distance,' said the other, without looking at him.</p>

<p>After walking for a quarter of a league, the Duke turned
abruptly in to a little <i>Kaffeehaus</i>. It was in a bedroom of
this humblest form of inn that Julien had the honour of reciting
his four pages to the Duke. When he had finished: 'Begin again, and
go more slowly,' he was told.</p>

<p>The Prince took down notes. 'Go on foot to the next post. Leave
your luggage and your calash here. Make your way to Strasbourg as
best you can, and on the twenty-second of the month'&mdash;it was now
the tenth&mdash;'be in this coffee-house here at half-past twelve. Do
not leave here for half an hour. Silence!'</p>

<p>Such were the only words that Julien heard said. They sufficed
to fill him with the deepest admiration. 'It is thus,' he thought,
'that one handles affairs; what would this great statesman say if
he had heard those hotheaded chatterboxes three days ago?'</p>

<p>Julien took two days to reach Strasbourg, he felt that there was
nothing for him to do there. He made a wide circuit. 'If that
devil, the abbe Castanede has recognised me, he is not the man to
be easily shaken off...And what a joy to him to make a fool of me,
and to spoil my mission!'</p>

<p>The abbe Castanede, Chief of Police to the <i>Congregation</i>
along the whole of the Northern frontier, had mercifully not
recognised him. And the Jesuits of Strasbourg, albeit most zealous,
never thought of keeping an eye on Julien, who, with his Cross and
his blue greatcoat, had the air of a young soldier greatly
concerned with his personal appearance.</p>

<h2><a name="ch54" id="ch54"></a>. Chapter 54. Strasbourg</h2>

<p style="margin-left:10%">Fascination! Thou sharest with love all
its energy, all<br>
its capacity for suffering. Its enchanting pleasures, its<br>
sweet delights are alone beyond thy sphere. I could not<br>
say, as I saw her asleep: She is all mine with her angelic<br>
beauty and her sweet frailties! Behold her delivered into<br>
my power, as heaven made her in its compassion to enchant<br>
a man's heart.<br>
&mdash;<i>Ode</i> by SCHILLER</p>

<p>Obliged to spend a week in Strasbourg, Julien sought to distract
himself with thoughts of martial glory and of devotion to his
country. Was he in love, then? He could not say, only he found in
his bruised heart Mathilde the absolute mistress of his happiness
as of his imagination. He required all his natural energy to keep
himself from sinking into despair. To think of anything that bore
no relation to Mademoiselle de La Mole was beyond his power.
Ambition, the mere triumphs of vanity, had I distracted him in the
past from the sentiments that Madame de Rênal inspired in him.
Mathilde had absorbed all; he found her everywhere in his
future.</p>

<p>On every hand, in this future, Julien foresaw failure. This
creature whom we saw at Verrières so filled with presumption, so
arrogant, had fallen into an absurd extreme of modesty.</p>

<p>Three days earlier he would have killed the abbe Castanede with
pleasure, and at Strasbourg, had a boy picked a quarrel with him,
he would have offered the boy an apology. In thinking over the
adversaries, the enemies whom he had encountered in the course of
his life, he found that invariably he, Julien, had been in the
wrong.</p>

<p>The fact was that he had now an implacable enemy in that
powerful imagination, which before had been constantly employed in
painting such brilliant successes for him in the future.</p>

<p>The absolute solitude of a traveller's existence strengthened
the power of this dark imagination. What a treasure would a friend
have been! 'But,' Julien asked himself, 'is there a heart in the
world that beats for me? And if I had a friend, does not honour
impose on me an eternal silence?'</p>

<p>He took a horse and rode sadly about the neighbourhood of Kehl;
it is a village on the bank of the Rhine, immortalised by Desaix
and Gouvion Saint-Cyr. A German peasant pointed out to him the
little streams, the roads, the islands in the Rhine which the
valour of those great Generals has made famous. Julien, holding the
reins in his left hand, was carrying spread out in his right the
superb map which illustrates the Memoirs of Marshal Saint-Cyr. A
joyful exclamation made him raise his head.</p>

<p>It was Prince Korasoff, his London friend, who had expounded to
him some months earlier the first principles of high fatuity.
Faithful to this great art, Korasoff, who had arrived in Strasbourg
the day before, had been an hour at Kehl, and had never in his life
read a line about the siege of 1796, began to explain it all to
Julien. The German peasant gazed at him in astonishment; for he
knew enough French to make out the enormous blunders into which the
Prince fell. Julien's thoughts were a thousand leagues away from
the peasant's, he was looking with amazement at this handsome young
man, and admiring his grace in the saddle.</p>

<p>'A happy nature!' he said to himself. 'How well his breeches fit
him, how elegantly his hair is cut! Alas, if I had been like that,
perhaps after loving me for three days she would not have taken a
dislike to me.'</p>

<p>When the Prince had come to an end of his version of the siege
of Kehl: 'You look like a Trappist,' he said to Julien, 'you are
infringing the principle of gravity I taught you in London. A
melancholy air can never be the right thing; what you want is a
bored air. If you are melancholy, it must be because you want
something, there is something in which you have not succeeded.</p>

<p>'<i>It is shewing your inferiority</i>. If you are bored, on the
other hand, it is the person who has tried in vain to please you
who is inferior. Realise, my dear fellow, what a grave mistake you
are making.'</p>

<p>Julien flung a crown to the peasant who stood listening to them,
open-mouthed.</p>

<p>'Good,' said the Prince, 'that is graceful, a noble disdain!
Very good!' And he put his horse into a gallop. Julien followed
him, filled with a stupefied admiration.</p>

<p>'Ah! If I had been like that, she would not have preferred
Croisenois to me!' The more his reason was shocked by the
absurdities of the Prince, the more he despised himself for not
admiring them, and deemed himself unfortunate in not sharing them.
Self-contempt can be carried no farther.</p>

<p>The Prince found him decidedly melancholy: 'Ah, my dear fellow,'
he said to him, as they rode into Strasbourg, 'have you lost all
your money, or can you be in love with some little actress?'</p>

<p>The Russians imitate French ways, but always at a distance of
fifty years. They have now reached the days of Louis XV.</p>

<p>These jests, at the expense of love, filled Julien's eyes with
tears: 'Why should not I consult so friendly a man?' he asked
himself suddenly.</p>

<p>'Well, yes, my friend,' he said to the Prince, 'you find me in
Strasbourg, madly in love, indeed crossed in love. A charming
woman, who lives in a neighbouring town, has abandoned me after
three days of passion, and the change is killing me.'</p>

<p>He described to the Prince, under an assumed name, the actions
and character of Mathilde.</p>

<p>'Do not go on,' said Korasoff: 'to give you confidence in your
physician, I am going to cut short your confidences. This young
woman's husband possesses an enormous fortune, or, what is more
likely, she herself belongs to the highest nobility of the place.
She must be proud of something.'</p>

<p>Julien nodded his head, he had no longer the heart to speak.</p>

<p>'Very good,' said the Prince, 'here are three medicines, all
rather bitter, which you are going to take without delay:</p>

<p>'First: You must every day see Madame &mdash;&mdash; what do you
call her?'</p>

<p>'Madame de Dubois.'</p>

<p>'What a name!' said the Prince, with a shout of laughter; 'but
forgive me, to you it is sublime. It is essential that you see
Madame de Dubois every day; above all do not appear to her cold and
cross; remember the great principle of your age: be the opposite to
what people expect of you. Show yourself precisely as you were a
week before you were honoured with her favours.'</p>

<p>'Ah! I was calm then,' cried Julien, in desperation, 'I thought
that I pitied her...'</p>

<p>'The moth singes its wings in the flame of the candle,' the
Prince continued, 'a metaphor as old as the world.</p>

<p>'First of all: you will see her every day.</p>

<p>'Secondly: you will pay court to a woman of her acquaintance,
but without any appearance of passion, you understand? I do not
conceal from you, yours is a difficult part to play: you have to
act, and if she discovers that you are acting, you are doomed.'</p>

<p>'She is so clever, and I am not! I am doomed,' said Julien
sadly.</p>

<p>'No, you are only more in love than I thought. Madame de Dubois
is profoundly taken up with herself, like all women who have
received from heaven either too high a rank or too much money. She
looks at herself instead of looking at you, and so does not know
you. During the two or three amorous impulses to which she has
yielded in your favour, by a great effort of imagination, she
beheld in you the hero of her dreams and not yourself as you really
are...</p>

<p>'But what the devil, these are the elements, my dear Sorel, are
you still a schoolboy?...</p>

<p>'Egad! Come into this shop; look at that charming black cravat;
you would say it was made by John Anderson, of Burlington Street;
do me the pleasure of buying it, and of throwing right away that
dreadful black rope which you have round your neck.</p>

<p>'And now,' the Prince went on as they left the shop of the first
hosier in Strasbourg, 'who are the friends of Madame de Dubois?
Good God, what a name! Do not be angry, my dear Sorel, I cannot
help it...To whom will you pay court?'</p>

<p>'To a prude of prudes, the daughter of an enormously rich
stocking-merchant. She has the loveliest eyes in the world, which
please me vastly; she certainly occupies the first place in the
district; but amid all her grandeur she blushes and loses her head
entirely if anyone refers to trade and a shop. And unfortunately
for her, her father was one of the best-known tradesmen in
Strasbourg.'</p>

<p>'So that if one mentions <i>industry</i>,' said the Prince, with
a laugh, 'you may be sure that your fair one is thinking of herself
and not of you. The weakness is divine and most useful, it will
prevent you from ever doing anything foolish in her fair eyes. Your
success is assured.'</p>

<p>Julien was thinking of Madame la Marechale de Fervaques, who
often came to the Hotel de La Mole. She was a beautiful foreigner
who had married the Marshal a year before his death. Her whole life
seemed to have no other object than to make people forget that she
was the daughter of an <i>industrial</i>, and in order to count for
something in Paris she had set herself at the head of the forces of
virtue.</p>

<p>Julien admired the Prince sincerely; what would he not have
given to have his absurd affectations! The conversation between the
friends was endless; Korasoff was in raptures: never had a
Frenchman given him so long a hearing. 'And so I have succeeded at
last,' the Prince said to himself with delight, 'in making my voice
heard when I give lessons to my masters!</p>

<p>'It is quite understood,' he repeated to Julien for the tenth
time, 'not a vestige of passion when you are talking to the young
beauty, the Strasbourg stocking-merchant's daughter, in the
presence of Madame de Dubois. On the contrary, burning passion when
you write. Reading a well-written love letter is a prude's supreme
pleasure; it is a momentary relaxation. She is not acting a part,
she dares to listen to her heart; and so, two letters daily.'</p>

<p>'Never, never!' said Julien, losing courage; 'I would let myself
be brayed in a mortar sooner than compose three sentences; I am a
corpse, my dear fellow, expect nothing more of me. Leave me to die
by the roadside.'</p>

<p>'And who said anything about composing phrases? I have in my
hold-all six volumes of love letters in manuscript. There are
specimens for every kind of woman, I have a set for the most rigid
virtue. Didn't Kalisky make love on Richmond Terrace, you know, a
few miles out of London, to the prettiest Quakeress in the whole of
England?'</p>

<p>Julien was less wretched when he parted from his friend at two
o'clock in the morning.</p>

<p>Next day the Prince sent for a copyist, and two days later
Julien had fifty-three love letters carefully numbered, intended to
cope with the most sublime and melancholy virtue.</p>

<p>'There would be fifty-four,' said the Prince, 'only Kalisky was
shown the door; but what does it matter to you, being ill-treated
by the stocking-merchant's daughter, since you are seeking to
influence only the heart of Madame de Dubois?'</p>

<p>Every day they went out riding: the Prince was madly taken with
Julien. Not knowing what token to give him of his sudden affection,
he ended by offering him the hand of one of his cousins, a wealthy
heiress in Moscow; 'and once you are married,' he explained, 'my
influence and the Cross you are wearing will make you a Colonel in
two years.'</p>

<p>'But this Cross was not given me by Napoleon, quite the
reverse.'</p>

<p>'What does that matter,' said the Prince, 'didn't he invent it?
It is still the first decoration by far in Europe.'</p>

<p>Julien was on the point of accepting; but duty recalled him to
the eminent personage; on parting from Korasoff, he promised to
write. He received the reply to the secret note that he had
brought, and hastened to Paris; but he had barely been by himself
for two days on end, before the thought of leaving France and
Mathilde seemed to him a punishment worse than death itself. 'I
shall not wed the millions that Korasoff offers me,' he told
himself, 'but I shall follow his advice.</p>

<p>'After all, the art of seduction is his business; he has thought
of nothing else for more than fifteen years, for he is now thirty.
One cannot say that he is lacking in intelligence; he is shrewd and
cautious; enthusiasm, poetry are impossible in such a nature: he is
calculating; all the more reason why he should not be mistaken.</p>

<p>'There is no help for it, I am going to pay court to Madame de
Fervaques.</p>

<p>'She will bore me a little, perhaps, but I shall gaze into those
lovely eyes which are so like the eyes that loved me best in the
world.</p>

<p>'She is foreign; that is a fresh character to be studied.</p>

<p>'I am mad, I am going under, I must follow the advice of a
friend, and pay no heed to myself.'</p>

<h2><a name="ch55" id="ch55"></a>Chapter 55. The Office of
Virtue</h2>

<p style="margin-left:10%">But if I take this pleasure with so much
prudence<br>
and circumspection, it ceases to be a pleasure for me.<br>
&mdash;LOPE DE VEGA</p>

<p>Immediately on his return to Paris, and on leaving the study of
the Marquis de La Mole, who appeared greatly disconcerted by the
messages that were conveyed to him, our hero hastened to find Conte
Altamira. With the distinction of being under sentence of death,
this handsome foreigner combined abundant gravity and had the good
fortune to be devout; these two merits and, more than all, the
exalted birth of the Count were entirely to the taste of Madame de
Fervaques, who saw much of him.</p>

<p>Julien confessed to him gravely that he was deeply in love with
her.</p>

<p>'She represents the purest and loftiest virtue,' replied
Altamira, 'only it is a trifle Jesuitical and emphatic. There are
days on which I understand every word that she uses, but I do not
understand the sentence as a whole. She often makes me think that I
do not know French as well as people say. This acquaintance will
make you talked about; it will give you a position in society. But
let us go and see Bustos,' said Conte Altamira, who had an orderly
mind; 'he has made love to Madame la Marechale.'</p>

<p>Don Diego Bustos made them explain the matter to him in detail,
without saying a word, like a barrister in chambers. He had a
plump, monkish face, with black moustaches, and an unparalleled
gravity; in other respects, a good carbonaro.</p>

<p>'I understand,' he said at length to Julien. 'Has the Marechale
de Fervaques had lovers, or has she not? Have you, therefore, any
hope of success? That is the question. It is as much as to say
that, for my own part, I have failed. Now that I am no longer
aggrieved, I put it to myself in this way: often she is out of
temper, and, as I shall shortly prove to you, she is nothing if not
vindictive.</p>

<p>'I do not find in her that choleric temperament which is a mark
of genius and covers every action with a sort of glaze of passion.
It is, on the contrary, to her calm and phlegmatic Dutch manner
that she owes her rare beauty and the freshness of her
complexion.'</p>

<p>Julien was growing impatient with the deliberateness and
imperturbable phlegm of the Spaniard; now and again, in spite of
himself, he gave vent to a monosyllabic comment.</p>

<p>'Will you listen to me?' Don Diego Bustos inquired gravely.</p>

<p>'Pardon the <i>furia francese</i>: I am all ears,' said
Julien.</p>

<p>'Well, then, the Marechale de Fervaques is much given to hatred;
she is pitiless in her pursuit of people she has never seen,
lawyers, poor devils of literary men who have written songs like
Colle, you know?</p>

<p style="margin-left:10%">"J'ai la marotte<br>
D'aimer Marote," etc.'</p>

<p>And Julien was obliged to listen to the quotation to the end.
The Spaniard greatly enjoyed singing in French.</p>

<p>That divine song was never listened to with greater impatience.
When he had finished: 'The Marechale,' said Don Diego Bustos, 'has
ruined the author of the song:</p>

<p>"Un jour l'amant au cabaret..."'</p>

<p>Julien was in an agony lest he should wish to sing it. He
contented himself with analysing it. It was, as a matter of fact,
impious and hardly decent.</p>

<p>'When the Marechale flew into a passion with that song,' said
Don Diego, 'I pointed out to her that a woman of her rank ought not
to read all the stupid things that are published. Whatever progress
piety and gravity may make, there will always be in France a
literature of the tavern. When Madame de Fervaques had the author,
a poor devil on half pay, deprived of a post worth eighteen hundred
francs: "Take care," said I to her, "you have attacked this
rhymester with your weapons, he may reply to you with his rhymes:
he will make a song about virtue. The gilded saloons will be on
your side; the people who like to laugh will repeat his epigrams."
Do you know, Sir, what answer the Marechale made me? "In the Lord's
service all Paris would see me tread the path of martyrdom; it
would be a novel spectacle in France. The people would learn to
respect the quality. It would be the happiest day of my life."
Never were her eyes more brilliant.'</p>

<p>'And she has superb eyes,' exclaimed Julien.</p>

<p>'I see that you are in love...Very well, then,' Don Diego Bustos
went on gravely, 'she has not the choleric constitution that impels
one to vengeance. If she enjoys injuring people, nevertheless, it
is because she is unhappy, I suspect <i>inward suffering</i>. May
she not be a prude who has grown weary of her calling?'</p>

<p>The Spaniard gazed at him in silence for fully a minute.</p>

<p>'That is the whole question,' he went on gravely, 'and it is
from this that you may derive some hope. I gave it much thought
during the two years in which I professed myself her most humble
servant. Your whole future, you, Sir, who are in love, hangs on
this great problem. Is she a prude, weary of her calling, and
malicious because she is miserable?'</p>

<p>'Or rather,' said Altamira, emerging at last from his profound
silence, 'can it be what I have said to you twenty times? Simply
and solely French vanity; it is the memory of her father, the
famous cloth merchant, that causes the unhappiness of a character
naturally morose and dry. There could be only one happiness for
her, that of living in Toledo, and being tormented by a confessor,
who every day would show her hell gaping for her.'</p>

<p>As Julien rose to leave: 'Altamira tells me that you are one of
us,' Don Diego said to him, graver than ever. 'One day you will
help us to reconquer our freedom, and so I wish to help you in this
little diversion. It is as well that you should be acquainted with
the Marechale's style; here are four letters in her hand.'</p>

<p>'I shall have them copied,' cried Julien, 'and return them to
you.'</p>

<p>'And no one shall ever learn from you a single word of what we
have been saying?'</p>

<p>'Never, upon my honour!' cried Julien.</p>

<p>'Then may heaven help you!' the Spaniard concluded; and he
accompanied Julien and Altamira in silence to the head of the
stair.</p>

<p>This scene cheered our hero somewhat; he almost smiled. 'And
here is the devout Altamira,' he said to himself, 'helping me in an
adulterous enterprise.'</p>

<p>Throughout the whole of the grave conversation of Don Diego
Bustos, Julien had been attentive to the stroke of the hours on the
clock of the Hotel d'Aligre.</p>

<p>The dinner hour was approaching, he was to see Mathilde again!
He went home, and dressed himself with great care.</p>

<p>'My first blunder,' he said to himself, as he was going
downstairs; 'I must carry out the Prince's orders to the
letter.'</p>

<p>He returned to his room, and put on a travelling costume of the
utmost simplicity.</p>

<p>'Now,' he thought, 'I must consider how I am to look at her.' It
was only half-past five, and dinner was at six. He decided to go
down to the drawing-room, which he found deserted. The sight of the
blue sofa moved him to tears; soon his cheeks began to burn. 'I
must get rid of this absurd sensibility,' he said to himself
angrily; 'it will betray me.' He took up a newspaper to keep
himself in countenance, and strolled three or four times from the
drawing-room to the garden.</p>

<p>It was only in fear and trembling and safely concealed behind a
big oak tree that he ventured to raise his eyes to the window of
Mademoiselle de La Mole's room. It was fast shut; he nearly fell to
the ground, and stood for a long time leaning against the oak;
then, with a tottering step, he went to look at the gardener's
ladder.</p>

<p>The link of the chain, forced open by him in circumstances,
alas, so different, had not been mended. Carried away by a mad
impulse, Julien pressed it to his lips.</p>

<p>After a long course of wandering between drawing-room and
garden, he found himself horribly tired; this was an initial
success which pleased him greatly. 'My eyes will be dull and will
not betray me!' Gradually, the guests arrived in the drawing-room;
the door never opened without plunging Julien in mortal dread.</p>

<p>They sat down to table. At length Mademoiselle de La Mole
appeared, still faithful to her principle of keeping the others
waiting. She blushed a deep red on seeing Julien; she had not been
told of his arrival. Following Prince Korasoff's advice, Julien
looked at her hands; they were trembling. Disquieted himself,
beyond all expression, by this discovery, he was thankful to appear
to be merely tired.</p>

<p>M. de La Mole sang his praises. The Marquise addressed him
shortly afterwards, and expressed concern at his appearance of
fatigue. Julien kept on saying to himself: 'I must not look at
Mademoiselle de La Mole too much, but I ought not either to avoid
her eye. I must appear to be what I really was a week before my
disaster...' He had occasion to be satisfied with his success, and
remained in the drawing-room. Attentive for the first time to the
lady of the house, he spared no effort to make the men of her
circle talk, and to keep the conversation alive.</p>

<p>His politeness was rewarded: about eight o'clock, Madame la
Marechale de Fervaques was announced. Julien left the room and
presently reappeared, dressed with the most scrupulous care. Madame
de La Mole was vastly flattered by this mark of respect, and sought
to give him a proof of her satisfaction by speaking of his travels
to Madame de Fervaques. Julien took his seat beside the Marechale,
in such a way that his eyes should not be visible to Mathilde. Thus
placed, and following all the rules of the art, he made Madame de
Fervaques the object of the most awed admiration. It was with an
outburst on this sentiment that the first of the fifty-three
letters of which Prince Korasoff had made him a present began.</p>

<p>The Marechale announced that she was going on to the
Opera-Bouffe. Julien hastened there; he found the Chevalier de
Beauvoisis, who took him to the box of the Gentlemen of the
Household, immediately beside that of Madame de Fervaques. Julien
gazed at her incessantly. 'I must,' he said to himself, as he
returned home, 'keep a diary of the siege; otherwise I should lose
count of my attacks.' He forced himself to write down two or three
pages on this boring subject, and thus succeeded (marvel of
marvels!) in hardly giving a thought to Mademoiselle de La
Mole.</p>

<p>Mathilde had almost forgotten him during his absence. 'After
all, he is only a common person,' she thought, 'his name will
always remind me of the greatest mistake of my life. I must return
in all sincerity to the recognised standards of prudence and
honour; a woman has everything to lose in forgetting them.' She
showed herself ready to permit at length the conclusion of the
arrangement with the Marquis de Croisenois, begun so long since. He
was wild with joy; he would have been greatly astonished had anyone
told him that it was resignation that lay at the root of this
attitude on Mathilde's part, which was making him so proud.</p>

<p>All Mademoiselle de La Mole's ideas changed at the sight of
Julien. 'In reality, that is my husband,' she said to herself; 'if
I return in sincerity to the standards of prudence, it is obviously
he that I ought to marry.'</p>

<p>She was prepared for importunities, for an air of misery on
Julien's part; she prepared her answers: for doubtless, on rising
from table, he would endeavour to say a few words to her. Far from
it, he remained fixed in the drawing-room, his eyes never even
turned towards the garden, heaven knows with how great an effort!
'It would be better to get our explanation over at once,'
Mademoiselle de La Mole told herself; she went out by herself to
the garden, Julien did not appear there. Mathilde returned and
strolled past the drawing-room windows; she saw him busily engaged
in describing to Madame de Fervaques the old ruined castles that
crown the steep banks of the Rhine and give them so distinctive a
character. He was beginning to acquit himself none too badly in the
use of the sentimental and picturesque language which is called
<i>wit</i> in certain drawing-rooms.</p>

<p>Prince Korasoff would indeed have been proud, had he been in
Paris: the evening was passing exactly as he had foretold.</p>

<p>He would have approved of the mode of behaviour to which Julien
adhered throughout the days that followed.</p>

<p>An intrigue among those constituting the Power behind the Throne
was about to dispose of several Blue Ribands; Madame la Marechale
de Fervaques insisted that her great-uncle should be made a Knight
of the Order. The Marquis de La Mole was making a similar claim for
his father-in-law; they combined their efforts, and the Marechale
came almost every day to the Hotel de La Mole. It was from her that
Julien learned that the Marquis was to become a Minister: he
offered the <i>Camarilla</i> a highly ingenious plan for destroying
the Charter, without any fuss, in three years' time.</p>

<p>Julien might expect a Bishopric, if M. de La Mole entered the
Ministry; but to his eyes all these important interests were as
though hidden by a veil. His imagination perceived them now only
vaguely, and so to speak in the distance. The fearful misery which
was driving him mad made him see every interest in life in the
state of his relations with Mademoiselle de La Mole. He calculated
that after five or six years of patient effort, he might succeed in
making her love him once again.</p>

<p>This coolest of heads had, as we see, sunk to a state of
absolute unreason. Of all the qualities that had distinguished him
in the past, there remained to him only a trace of firmness.
Faithful to the letter to the plan of conduct dictated to him by
Prince Korasoff, every evening he took his place as near as
possible to the armchair occupied by Madame de Fervaques, but found
it impossible to think of a word to say to her.</p>

<p>The effort that he was imposing on himself to appear curéd in
the eyes of Mathilde absorbed all his spiritual strength, he
remained rooted beside the Marechale like a barely animate being;
his eyes even, as in the extremity of physical suffering, had lost
all their fire.</p>

<p>Since Madame de La Mole's attitude towards the world was never
anything more than a feeble copy of the opinions of that husband
who might make her a Duchess, for some days she had been lauding
Julien's merits to the skies.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch56" id="ch56"></a>Chapter 56. Moral Love</h2>

<p style="margin-left:10%">There also was of course in Adeline<br>
That calm patrician polish in the address,<br>
Which ne'er can pass the equinoctial line<br>
Of anything which nature would express;<br>
Just as a mandarin finds nothing fine,<br>
At least his manner suffers not to guess<br>
That anything he views can greatly please.<br>
&mdash;<i>Don Juan</i>, XIII. 34</p>

<p>'There is a trace of madness in the way the whole of this family
have of looking at things,' thought the Marechale; 'they are
infatuated with their little abbe, who can do nothing but sit and
stare at one; it is true, his eyes are not bad-looking.'</p>

<p>Julien, for his part, found in the Marechale's manner an almost
perfect example of that patrician calm which betokens a scrupulous
politeness and still more the impossibility of any keen emotion.
Any sudden outburst, a want of self-control, would have shocked
Madame de Fervaques almost as much as a want of dignity towards
one's inferiors. The least sign of sensibility would have been in
her eyes like a sort of moral intoxication for which one ought to
blush, and which was highly damaging to what a person of exalted
rank owed to herself. Her great happiness was to speak of the
King's latest hunt, her favourite book the <i>Memoires du duc de
Saint-Simon</i>, especially the genealogical part.</p>

<p>Julien knew the place in the drawing-room which, as the lights
were arranged, suited the style of beauty of Madame de Fervaques.
He would be there waiting for her, but took great care to turn his
chair so that he should not be able to see Mathilde. Astonished by
this persistence in hiding from her, one evening she left the blue
sofa and came to work at a little table that stood by the
Marquise's armchair. Julien could see her at quite a close range
from beneath the brim of Madame de Fervaques's hat. Those eyes,
which governed his destiny, frightened him at first, seen at such
close range, then jerked him violently out of his habitual apathy;
he talked, and talked very well.</p>

<p>He addressed himself to the Marechale, but his sole object was
to influence the heart of Mathilde. He grew so animated that
finally Madame de Fervaques could not understand what he said.</p>

<p>This was so much to the good. Had it occurred to Julien to
follow it up with a few expressions of German mysticism, religious
fervour and Jesuitry, the Marechale would have numbered him
straightway among the superior persons called to regenerate the
age.</p>

<p>'Since he shows such bad taste,' Mademoiselle de La Mole said to
herself, 'as to talk for so long and with such fervour to Madame de
Fervaques, I shall not listen to him any more.' For the rest of the
evening she kept her word, albeit with difficulty.</p>

<p>At midnight, when she took up her mother's candlestick, to
escort her to her room, Madame de La Mole stopped on the stairs to
utter a perfect panegyric of Julien. This completed Mathilde's ill
humour; she could not send herself to sleep. A thought came to her
which soothed her: 'The things that I despise may even be great
distinctions in the Marechale's eyes.'</p>

<p>As for Julien, he had now taken action, he was less wretched;
his eyes happened to fall on the Russia-leather portfolio in which
Prince Korasoff had placed the fifty-three love letters of which he
had made him a present. Julien saw a note at the foot of the first
letter: 'Send No. 1 a week after the first meeting.'</p>

<p>'I am late!' exclaimed Julien, 'for it is ever so long now since
I first met Madame de Fervaques.' He set to work at once to copy
out this first love letter; it was a homily stuffed with phrases
about virtue, and of a deadly dullness; Julien was fortunate in
falling asleep over the second page.</p>

<p>Some hours later the risen sun surprised him crouching with his
head on the table. One of the most painful moments of his life was
that in which, every morning, as he awoke, he discovered his
distress. This morning, he finished copying his letter almost with
a laugh. 'Is it possible,' he asked himself, 'that there can ever
have been a young man who could write such stuff?' He counted
several sentences of nine lines. At the foot of the original he
caught sight of a pencilled note.</p>

<p>'One delivers these letters oneself: on horseback, a black
cravat, a blue greatcoat. One hands the letter to the porter with a
contrite air; profound melancholy in the gaze. If one should see a
lady's maid, wipe the eyes furtively. Address a few words to the
maid.'</p>

<p>All these instructions were faithfully carried out.</p>

<p>'What I am doing is very bold,' thought Julien, as he rode away
from the Hotel de Fervaques, 'but so much the worse for Korasoff.
To dare write to so notorious a prude! I am going to be treated
with the utmost contempt, and nothing will amuse me more. This is,
really, the only form of comedy to which I can respond. Yes, to
cover with ridicule that odious being whom I call myself will amuse
me. If I obeyed my instincts I should commit some crime for the
sake of distraction.'</p>

<p>For a month past, the happiest moment in Julien's day had been
that in which he brought his horse back to the stables. Korasoff
had expressly forbidden him to look, upon any pretext whatsoever,
at the mistress who had abandoned him. But the paces of that horse
which she knew so well, the way in which Julien rapped with his
whip at the stable door to summon a groom, sometimes drew Mathilde
to stand behind her window curtain. The muslin was so fine that
Julien could see through it. By looking up in a certain way from
under the brim of his hat, he caught a glimpse of Mathilde's form
without seeing her eyes. 'Consequently,' he told himself, 'she
cannot see mine, and this is not the same as looking at her.'</p>

<p>That evening, Madame de Fervaques behaved to him exactly as
though she had not received the philosophical, mystical and
religious dissertation which, in the morning, he had handed to her
porter with such an air of melancholy. The evening before, chance
had revealed to Julien the secret springs of eloquence; he arranged
himself so as to be able to see Mathilde's eyes. She, meanwhile,
immediately after the arrival of the Marechale, rose from the blue
sofa: this was a desertion of her regular company. M. de Croisenois
showed consternation at this new caprice; his evident distress
relieved Julien of the keenest pangs of his own sufferings.</p>

<p>This unexpected turn in his affairs made him talk like an angel;
and as self-esteem finds its way even into hearts that serve as
temples to the most august virtue: 'Madame de La Mole is right,'
the Marechale said to herself, as she stepped into her carriage,
'that young priest has distinction. My presence must, at first,
have frightened him. Indeed, everything that one finds in that
house is very frivolous; all the virtue I see there is the result
of age, and stood in great need of the congealing hand of time.
That young man must have seen the difference; he writes well; but I
am much afraid that the request that I should enlighten him with my
advice, which he makes in his letter, is in reality only a
sentiment unaware of itself.</p>

<p>'And yet, how many conversions have begun in this way! What
leads me to augur well of this one is the difference in his style
from that of the young men whose letters I have had occasion to
see. It is impossible not to recognise unction, a profound
earnestness and great conviction in the prose of this young Levite;
he must have the soothing virtue of Massillon.'</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch57" id="ch57"></a>Chapter 57. The Best Positions in
the Church</h2>

<p style="margin-left:10%">Service! talent! merit! bah! belong to a
coterie.<br>
&mdash;TELEMACHUS</p>

<p>Thus the idea of a Bishopric was for the first time blended with
that of Julien in the head of a woman who sooner or later would be
distributing the best positions in the Church of France. This
prospect would have made little difference to him; for the moment,
his thoughts rose to nothing that was alien to his present misery:
everything intensified it; for instance the sight of his bedroom
had become intolerable to him. At night, when he came upstairs with
his candle, each piece of furniture, every little ornament seemed
to acquire the power of speech to inform him harshly of some fresh
detail of his misery.</p>

<p>This evening, 'I am a galley slave,' he said to himself, as he
entered it, with a vivacity long unfamiliar to him: 'let us hope
that the second letter will be as boring as the first.'</p>

<p>It was even more so. What he was copying seemed to him so absurd
that he began to transcribe it line for line, without a thought of
the meaning.</p>

<p>'It is even more emphatic,' he said to himself, 'than the
official documents of the Treaty of Muenster, which my tutor in
diplomacy made me copy out in London.'</p>

<p>It was only then that he remembered the letters from Madame de
Fervaques, the originals of which he had forgotten to restore to
the grave Spaniard, Don Diego Bustos. He searched for them; they
were really almost as fantastic a rigmarole as those of the young
Russian gentleman. They were completely vague. They expressed
everything and nothing. 'It is the Aeolian harp of style,' thought
Julien. 'Amid the most lofty thoughts about annihilation, death,
the infinite, etc., I can see no reality save a shocking fear of
ridicule.'</p>

<p>The monologue which we have here abridged was repeated nightly
for a fortnight. Falling asleep while transcribing a sort of
commentary on the Apocalypse, going next day to deliver a letter
with a melancholy air, leaving his horse in the stable yard with
the hope of catching a glimpse of Mathilde's gown, working, putting
in an appearance in the evening at the Opera when Madame de
Fervaques did not come to the Hotel de La Mole; such were the
monotonous events of Julien's existence. They became more
interesting when Madame de Fervaques paid a visit to the Marquise;
then he could steal a glance at Mathilde's eyes beneath the side of
the Marechale's hat, and would wax eloquent. His picturesque and
sentimental phrases began to assume a turn at once more striking
and more elegant.</p>

<p>He was fully aware that what he was saying seemed absurd to
Mathilde, but he sought to impress her by the elegance of his
diction. 'The falser the things I say, the more I ought to appeal
to her,' thought Julien; and then, with a shocking boldness, he
began to exaggerate certain aspects of nature. He very soon
perceived that, if he were not to appear vulgar in the eyes of the
Marechale, he must above all avoid any simple or reasonable idea.
He continued on these lines, or abridged his amplifications
according as he read success or indifference in the eyes of the two
great ladies to whom he must appeal.</p>

<p>On the whole, his life was less horrible than at the time when
his days passed in inaction.</p>

<p>'But,' he said to himself one evening, 'here I am transcribing
the fifteenth of these abominable dissertations; the first fourteen
have been faithfully delivered to the Marechale's Swiss. I shall
soon have the honour of filling all the pigeonholes in her desk.
And yet she treats me exactly as though I were not writing! What
can be the end of all this? Can my constancy bore her as much as it
bores me? I am bound to say that this Russian, Korasoff's friend,
who was in love with the fair Quakeress of Richmond, must have been
a terrible fellow in his day; no one could be more deadly.'</p>

<p>Like everyone of inferior intelligence whom chance brings into
touch with the operations of a great general, Julien understood
nothing of the attack launched by the young Russian upon the heart
of the fair English maid. The first forty letters were intended
only to make her pardon his boldness in writing. It was necessary
to make this gentle person, who perhaps was vastly bored, form the
habit of receiving letters that were perhaps a trifle less insipid
than her everyday life.</p>

<p>One morning, a letter was handed to Julien; he recognised the
armorial bearings of Madame de Fervaques, and broke the seal with
an eagerness which would have seemed quite impossible to him a few
days earlier: it was only an invitation to dine.</p>

<p>He hastened to consult Prince Korasoff's instructions.
Unfortunately, the young Russian had chosen to be as frivolous as
Dorat, just where he ought to have been simple and intelligible;
Julien could not discover the moral attitude which he was supposed
to adopt at the Marechale's table.</p>

<p>Her drawing-room was the last word in magnificence, gilded like
the Galerie de Diane in the Tuileries, with oil paintings in the
panels. There were blank spaces in these paintings, Julien learned
later on that the subjects had seemed hardly decent to the lady of
the house, who had had the pictures corrected. 'A moral age!' he
thought.</p>

<p>In this drawing-room he remarked three of the gentlemen who had
been present at the drafting of the secret note. One of them, the
Right Reverend Bishop of &mdash;&mdash;, the Marechale's uncle, had
the patronage of benefices, and, it was said, could refuse nothing
to his niece. 'What a vast stride I have made,' thought Julien,
with a melancholy smile, 'and how cold it leaves me! Here I am
dining with the famous Bishop of &mdash;&mdash;.'</p>

<p>The dinner was indifferent and the conversation irritating. 'It
is like the table of contents of a dull book,' thought Julien. 'All
the greatest subjects of human thought are proudly displayed in it.
Listen to it for three minutes, and you ask yourself which is more
striking, the emphasis of the speaker or his shocking
ignorance.'</p>

<p>The reader has doubtless forgotten that little man of letters,
named Tanbeau, the nephew of the Academician and an embryo
professor, who, with his vile calumnies, seemed to be employed in
poisoning the drawing-room of the Hotel de La Mole.</p>

<p>It was from this little man that Julien first gleaned the idea
that it might well be that Madame de Fervaques, while refraining
from answering his letters, looked with indulgence upon the
sentiment that dictated them. The black heart of M. Tanbeau was
torn asunder by the thought of Julien's successes; but inasmuch as,
looking at it from another angle, a deserving man cannot, any more
than a fool, be in two places at once, 'if Sorel becomes the lover
of the sublime Marechale,' the future professor told himself, 'she
will place him in the Church in some advantageous manner, and I
shall be rid of him at the Hotel de La Mole.'</p>

<p>M. l'abbe Pirard also addressed long sermons to Julien on his
successes at the Hotel de Fervaques. There was a sectarian jealousy
between the austere Jansenist and the Jesuitical, regenerative and
monarchical drawing-room of the virtuous Marechale.</p>

<h2><a name="ch58" id="ch58"></a>Chapter 58. Manon Lescaut</h2>

<p style="margin-left:10%">Now once he was fully convinced of the
foolishness and<br>
idiocy of the prior, he succeeded quite straightforwardly<br>
by calling black white, and white black.<br>
&mdash;LICHTENBERG</p>

<p>The Russian instructions laid down categorically that one must
never contradict in speech the person with whom one corresponded.
One must never depart, upon any account, from an attitude of the
most ecstatic admiration; the letters were all based upon this
supposition.</p>

<p>One evening, at the Opera, in Madame de Fervaques's box, Julien
praised to the skies the ballet in <i>Manon Lescaut</i>. [Trans.
footnote: Composed by Halevy upon a libretto by Scribe, and
performed in 1830.] His sole reason for doing so was that he found
it insipid.</p>

<p>The Marechale said that this ballet was greatly inferior to abbe
Prevost's novel.</p>

<p>'What!' thought Julien, with surprise and amusement, 'a person
of such extreme virtue praise a novel!' Madame de Fervaques used to
profess, two or three times weekly, the most utter scorn for the
writers, who, by means of those vulgar works, sought to corrupt a
younger generation only too prone to the errors of the senses.</p>

<p>'In that immoral and pernicious class, <i>Manon Lescaut</i>,'
the Marechale went on, 'occupies, they say, one of the first
places. The frailties and well-merited sufferings of a thoroughly
criminal heart are, they say, described in it with a truth that is
almost profound; which did not prevent your Bonaparte from
declaring on Saint Helena that it was a novel written for
servants.'</p>

<p>This speech restored all its activity to Julien's spirit.
'People have been trying to damage me with the Marechale; they have
told her of my enthusiasm for Napoleon. This intelligence has stung
her sufficiently for her to yield to the temptation to let me feel
her resentment.' This discovery kept him amused for the rest of the
evening and made him amusing. As he was bidding the Marechale good
night in the vestibule of the Opera: 'Bear in mind, Sir,' she said
to him, 'that people must not love Napoleon when they love me; they
may, at the most, accept him as a necessity imposed by Providence.
Anyhow, the man had not a soul pliant enough to feel great works of
art.'</p>

<p>'<i>When they love me</i>!' Julien repeated to himself; 'either
that means nothing at all, or it means everything. There is one of
the secrets of language that are hidden from us poor provincials.'
And he thought incessantly of Madame de Rênal as he copied an
immensely long letter intended for the Marechale.</p>

<p>'How is it,' she asked him the following evening, with an air of
indifference which seemed to him unconvincing, 'that you speak to
me of <i>London</i> and <i>Richmond</i> in a letter which you wrote
last night, it appears, after leaving the Opera?'</p>

<p>Julien was greatly embarrassed; he had copied the letter line
for line, without thinking of what he was writing, and apparently
had forgotten to substitute for the words <i>London</i> and
<i>Richmond</i>, which occurred in the original, <i>Paris</i> and
<i>Saint-Cloud</i>. He began two or three excuses, but found it
impossible to finish any of them; he felt himself on the point of
giving way to an outburst of helpless laughter. At length, in his
search for the right words, he arrived at the following idea:
'Exalted by the discussion of the most sublime, the highest
interests of the human soul, my own, in writing to you, must have
become distracted.</p>

<p>'I am creating an impression,' he said to himself, 'therefore I
can spare myself the tedium of the rest of the evening.' He left
the Hotel de Fervaques in hot haste. That evening, as he looked
over the original text of the letter which he had copied the night
before, he very soon came to the fatal passage where the young
Russian spoke of London and Richmond. Julien was quite surprised to
find this letter almost tender.</p>

<p>It was the contrast between the apparent frivolity of his talk
and the sublime and almost apocalyptic profundity of his letters
that had marked him out. The length of his sentences was especially
pleasing to the Marechale; this was not the cursory style brought
into fashion by Voltaire, that most immoral of men! Although our
hero did everything in the world to banish any suggestion of common
sense from his conversation, it had still an anti-monarchical and
impious colour which did not escape the notice of Madame de
Fervaques. Surrounded by persons who were eminently moral, but who
often had not one idea in an evening, this lady was profoundly
impressed by everything that bore a semblance of novelty; but, at
the same time, she felt that she owed it to herself to be shocked
by it. She called this defect, 'retaining the imprint of the
frivolity of the age'.</p>

<p>But such drawing-rooms are worth visiting only when one has a
favour to ask. All the boredom of this life without interests which
Julien was leading is doubtless shared by the reader. These are the
barren moorlands on our journey.</p>

<p>Throughout the time usurped in Julien's life by the Fervaques
episode, Mademoiselle de La Mole had to make a constant effort not
to think of him. Her heart was exposed to violent combats:
sometimes she flattered herself that she was despising this gloomy
young man; but, in spite of her efforts, his conversation
captivated her. What astonished her most of all was his complete
insincerity; he never uttered a word to the Marechale which was not
a lie, or at least a shocking travesty of his point of view, which
Mathilde knew so perfectly upon almost every subject. This
Machiavellism impressed her. 'What profundity!' she said to
herself; 'how different from the emphatic blockheads or the common
rascals, like M. Tanbeau, who speak the same language!'</p>

<p>Nevertheless, Julien passed some fearful days. It was to perform
the most arduous of his duties that he appeared each evening in the
Marechale's drawing-room. His efforts to play a part ended by
sapping all his spiritual strength. Often, at night, as he crossed
the vast courtyard of the Hotel de Fervaques, it was only by force
of character and reason that he succeeded in keeping himself from
sinking into despair.</p>

<p>'I conquered despair at the Seminary,' he said to himself: 'and
yet what an appalling prospect I had before me then! I stood to
make my fortune or to fail; in either case, I saw myself obliged to
spend my whole life in the intimate society of all that is most
contemptible and disgusting under heaven. The following spring,
when only eleven short months had passed, I was perhaps the
happiest of all the young men of my age.'</p>

<p>But often enough all these fine arguments proved futile when
faced with the frightful reality. Every day he saw Mathilde at
luncheon and at dinner. From the frequent letters which M. de La
Mole dictated to him, he knew her to be on the eve of marrying M.
de Croisenois. Already that amiable young man was calling twice
daily at the Hotel de La Mole: the jealous eye of an abandoned
lover did not miss a single one of his actions.</p>

<p>When he thought he had noticed that Mademoiselle de La Mole was
treating her suitor kindly, on returning to his room, Julien could
not help casting a loving glance at his pistols.</p>

<p>'Ah, how much wiser I should be,' he said to himself, 'to remove
the marks from my linen, and retire to some lonely forest, twenty
leagues from Paris, there to end this accursed existence! A
stranger to the countryside, my death would remain unknown for a
fortnight, and who would think of me after a fortnight had
passed?'</p>

<p>This reasoning was extremely sound. But next day, a glimpse of
Mathilde's arm, seen between her sleeve and her glove, was enough
to plunge our young philosopher in cruel memories, which, at the
same time, made him cling to life. 'Very well!' he would then say
to himself, 'I shall follow out this Russian policy to the end. How
is it going to end?</p>

<p>'As for the Marechale, certainly, after I have copied these
fifty-three letters, I shall write no more.</p>

<p>'As for Mathilde, these six weeks of such painful play-acting,
will either fail altogether to appease her anger, or will win me a
moment of reconciliation. Great God! I should die of joy!' And he
was unable to pursue the idea farther.</p>

<p>When, after a long spell of meditation, he succeeded in
recovering the use of his reason: 'Then,' he said to himself, 'I
should obtain a day's happiness, after which would begin again her
severities, founded, alas, upon the scant power that I have to
please her, and I should be left without any further resource, I
should be ruined, lost for ever...</p>

<p>'What guarantee can she give me, with her character? Alas, my
scant merit is responsible for everything. I must be wanting in
elegance in my manners, my way of speaking must be heavy and
monotonous. Great God! Why am I myself?'</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch59" id="ch59"></a>Chapter 59. Boredom</h2>

<p style="margin-left:10%">Sacrificing oneself to one's passions is
one thing;<br>
but to passions that one doesn't have! O sad nineteenth
century!<br>
&mdash;GIRODET</p>

<p>After having read without pleasure at first Julien's long
letters, Madame de Fervaques began to take an interest in them; but
one thing distressed her: 'What a pity that M. Sorel is not really
a priest! One could admit him to a sort of intimacy: with that
Cross and what is almost a layman's coat, one is exposed to cruel
questions, and how is one to answer them?' She did not complete her
thought: 'some malicious friend may suppose and indeed spread the
report that he is some humble little cousin, one of my father's
family, some tradesman decorated by the National Guard.'</p>

<p>Until the moment of her first meeting Julien, Madame de
Fervaques's greatest pleasure had been to write the word Marechale
before her own name. Thenceforward the vanity of an upstart, morbid
and easily offended, had to fight a nascent interest.</p>

<p>'It would be so easy for me,' the Marechale said to herself, 'to
make a Vicar-General of him in some diocese not far from Paris! But
M. Sorel by itself, and to add to that a mere secretary of M. de La
Mole! It is deplorable.'</p>

<p>For the first time, this spirit which <i>dreaded everything</i>
was stirred by an interest apart from its own pretensions to rank
and to social superiority. Her old porter noticed that, when he
brought her a letter from that handsome young man, who wore such a
melancholy air, he was certain to see vanish the distracted and
irritated expression which the Marechale always took care to assume
when any of her servants entered the room.</p>

<p>The boredom of a mode of life whose sole ambition was to create
an effect on the public, without there being at the bottom of her
heart any real enjoyment of this kind of success, had become so
intolerable since she had begun to think of Julien, that, if her
maids were not to be ill-treated throughout the whole of a day, it
was enough that during the previous evening she should have spent
an hour with this strange young man. His growing credit survived
anonymous letters, very well composed. In vain did little Tanbeau
supply MM. de Luz, de Croisenois, de Caylus, with two or three most
adroit calumnies which those gentlemen took pleasure in spreading
abroad, without stopping to consider the truth of the accusations.
The Marechale, whose mind was not framed to withstand these vulgar
methods, reported her doubts to Mathilde, and was always
comforted.</p>

<p>One day, after having inquired three times whether there were
any letters, Madame de Fervaques suddenly decided to write to
Julien. This was a victory gained by boredom. At the second letter,
the Marechale was almost brought to a standstill by the
unpleasantness of writing with her own hand so vulgar an address
as: 'a M. Sorel, chez M. le Marquis de La Mole'.</p>

<p>'You must,' she said to Julien that evening in the driest of
tones, 'bring me some envelopes with your address written on
them.'</p>

<p>'So now I am to combine the lover and the flunkey,' thought
Julien, and bowed, amusing himself by screwing up his face like
Arsene, the Marquis's old footman.</p>

<p>That same evening he brought a supply of envelopes, and next
day, early in the morning, he received a third letter: he read five
or six lines at the beginning, and two or three towards the end. It
covered four pages in a small and very close script.</p>

<p>Gradually she formed the pleasant habit of writing almost every
day. Julien replied with faithful copies of the Russian letters,
and, such is the advantage of the emphatic style, Madame de
Fervaques was not at all surprised by the want of connection
between the replies and her own letters.</p>

<p>What would have been the irritation to her pride if little
Tanbeau, who had appointed himself a voluntary spy upon Julien's
actions, had been able to tell her that all these letters, with
their seals unbroken, were flung pell-mell into Julien's
drawer!</p>

<p>One morning, the porter brought to him in the library a letter
from the Marechale; Mathilde met the man, saw the letter, and read
the address in Julien's hand. She entered the library as the porter
left it; the letter was still lying on the edge of the table;
Julien, busily engaged in writing, had not placed it in his
drawer.</p>

<p>'This is what I cannot endure,' cried Mathilde, seizing the
letter; 'you are forgetting me entirely, me who am your wife. Your
conduct is appalling, Sir.'</p>

<p>With these words, her pride, astonished by the fearful
impropriety of her action, stifled her; she burst into tears, and a
moment later appeared to Julien to be unable to breathe.</p>

<p>Surprised, confounded, Julien did not clearly distinguish all
the admirable and happy consequences which this scene foreboded for
himself. He helped Mathilde to a seat; she almost abandoned herself
in his arms.</p>

<p>The first instant in which he perceived this relaxation was one
of extreme joy. His second thought was of Korasoff: 'I may ruin
everything by a single word.'</p>

<p>His arms ached, so painful was the effort imposed on him by
policy. 'I ought not even to allow myself to press to my heart this
supple and charming form, or she will despise and abuse me. What a
frightful nature!'</p>

<p>And as he cursed Mathilde's nature, he loved her for it a
hundred times more; he felt as though he were holding a queen in
his arms.</p>

<p>Julien's unfeeling coldness intensified the misery of wounded
pride which was tearing the heart of Mademoiselle de La Mole. She
was far from possessing the necessary coolness to seek to read in
his eyes what he was feeling for her at that moment. She could not
bring herself to look at him; she trembled lest she should meet an
expression of scorn.</p>

<p>Seated on the divan in the library, motionless and with her head
turned away from Julien, she was a prey to the keenest suffering
that pride and love can make a human heart feel. Into what a
frightful course of action had she fallen!</p>

<p>'It was reserved for me, wretch that I am, to see the most
indelicate advances repulsed! And repulsed by whom?' added a pride
mad with suffering, 'by one of my father's servants.</p>

<p>'That is what I will not endure,' she said aloud.</p>

<p>And, rising with fury, she opened the drawer of Julien's table,
which stood a few feet away from her. She remained frozen with
horror on seeing there nine or ten letters unopened, similar in
every respect to the letter which the porter had just brought in.
On all the envelopes, she recognised Julien's hand, more or less
disguised.</p>

<p>'And so,' she cried, beside herself with rage, 'not only have
you found favour with her, but you despise her. You, a man of
nought, to despise Madame la Marechale de Fervaques!</p>

<p>'Ah, forgive me, my dear,' she went on, flinging herself at his
feet, 'despise me if you wish, but love me, I can no longer live
deprived of your love.' And she fell to the ground in a dead
faint.</p>

<p>'So there she is, that proud creature, at my feet!' thought
Julien.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch60" id="ch60"></a>Chapter 60. A Box at the
Bouffes</h2>

<p style="margin-left:10%">As the blackest sky Foretells the
heaviest tempest.<br>
&mdash;<i>Don Juan</i>, I. 73</p>

<p>In the thick of all this great commotion, Julien was more
bewildered than happy. Mathilde's abuse of him showed him how wise
the Russian policy had been. '<i>Say little, do little</i>, that is
my one way of salvation.'</p>

<p>He lifted up Mathilde and without a word laid her down again on
the divan. Gradually she gave way to tears.</p>

<p>To keep herself in countenance, she took Madame de Fervaques's
letters in her hands; she broke the seals slowly. She gave a
nervous start on recognising the Marechale's handwriting. She
turned over the sheets of these letters without reading them; the
majority of them covered six pages.</p>

<p>'Answer me this, at least,' said Mathilde at length in the most
supplicating tone, but without venturing to look at Julien. 'You
know very well that I am proud; it is the misfortune of my
position, and indeed of my nature, I must admit; so Madame de
Fervaques has stolen your heart from me...Has she offered you all
the sacrifices to which that fatal passion led me?'</p>

<p>A grim silence was Julien's only answer. 'By what right,' he
thought, 'does she ask of me an indiscretion unworthy of an
honourable man?'</p>

<p>Mathilde endeavoured to read the letters; the tears that filled
her eyes made it impossible for her to do so.</p>

<p>For a month past she had been miserable, but that proud spirit
was far from confessing its feelings to itself. Chance alone had
brought about this explosion. For an instant jealousy and love had
overcome pride. She was seated upon the divan and in close
proximity to him. He saw her hair and her throat of alabaster; for
a moment he forgot all that he owed to himself; he slipped his arm
round her waist, and almost hugged her to his bosom.</p>

<p>She turned her head towards him slowly: he was astonished at the
intense grief that was visible in her eyes, and made them quite
unrecognisable as hers.</p>

<p>Julien felt his strength begin to fail him, so colossal was the
effort involved in the act of courage which he was imposing on
himself.</p>

<p>'Those eyes will soon express nothing but the coldest disdain,'
he said to himself, 'if I allow myself to be carried away by the
joy of loving her.' Meanwhile, in a faint voice and in words which
she had barely the strength to utter, she was repeating to him at
that moment her assurance of all her regret for the action which an
excessive pride might have counselled her to take.</p>

<p>'I too, have my pride,' Julien said to her in a voice that was
barely articulate, and his features indicated the extreme limit of
physical exhaustion.</p>

<p>Mathilde turned sharply towards him. The sound of his voice was
a pleasure the hope of which she had almost abandoned. At that
moment she recalled her pride only to curse it, she would fain have
discovered some unusual, incredible act to prove to him how greatly
she adored him and detested herself.</p>

<p>'It is probably because of that pride,' Julien went on, 'that
you have singled me out for an instant; it is certainly because of
that courageous firmness, becoming in a man, that you respect me at
this moment. I may be in love with the Marechale...'</p>

<p>Mathilde shuddered; her eyes assumed a strange expression. She
was about to hear her sentence uttered. This movement did not pass
unobserved by Julien; he felt his courage weaken.</p>

<p>'Ah!' he said to himself, listening to the sound of the vain
words that came from his lips, as he might have listened to a noise
from without; 'if I could only cover those pale cheeks with kisses,
and you not feel them!</p>

<p>'I may be in love with the Marechale,' he continued...and his
voice grew fainter and fainter; 'but certainly, of her interest in
myself I have no decisive proof...'</p>

<p>Mathilde gazed at him; he met her gaze, at least he hoped that
his features had not betrayed him. He felt himself penetrated by
love to the innermost recesses of his heart. Never had he adored
her so intensely; he was scarcely less mad than Mathilde. Could she
have found sufficient self-control and courage to manoeuvre, he
would have fallen at her feet, forswearing all idle play-acting. He
had strength enough to be able to continue to speak. 'Ah!
Korasoff,' he exclaimed inwardly, 'why are not you here? How I need
a word of advice to direct my conduct!' Meanwhile his voice was
saying:</p>

<p>'Failing any other sentiment, gratitude would suffice to attach
me to the Marechale; she has shown me indulgence, she has comforted
me when others scorned me...I may perhaps not repose an unbounded
faith in certain signs which are extremely flattering, no doubt,
but also, perhaps, are of very brief duration.'</p>

<p>'Ah! Great God!' cried Mathilde.</p>

<p>'Very well! What guarantee will you give me?' Julien went on in
sharp, firm accents, seeming to abandon for an instant the prudent
forms of diplomacy. 'What guarantee, what god will assure me that
the position which you seem disposed to restore to me at this
moment will last for more than two days?'</p>

<p>'The intensity of my love and of my misery if you no longer love
me,' she said, clasping his hands and turning her face towards
him.</p>

<p>The violent movement which she thus made had slightly displaced
her pelerine: Julien caught a glimpse of her charming shoulders.
Her hair, slightly disordered, recalled to him an exquisite
memory...</p>

<p>He was about to yield. 'An imprudent word,' he told himself,
'and I begin once more that long succession of days passed in
despair. Madame de Rênal used to find reasons for obeying the
dictates of her heart: this young girl of high society allows her
heart to be moved only when she has proved to herself with good
reasons that it ought to be moved.'</p>

<p>He perceived this truth in a flash, and in a flash also regained
his courage.</p>

<p>He freed his hands which Mathilde was clasping in her own, and
with marked respect withdrew a little way from her. Human courage
can go no farther. He then busied himself in gathering together all
Madame de Fervaques's letters which were scattered over the divan,
and it was with a show of extreme politeness, so cruel at that
moment, that he added:</p>

<p>'Mademoiselle de La Mole will deign to permit me to think over
all this.' He withdrew rapidly and left the library; she heard him
shut all the doors in turn.</p>

<p>'The monster is not in the least perturbed,' she said to
herself...</p>

<p>'But what am I saying, a monster! He is wise, prudent, good; it
is I who have done more wrong than could be imagined.'</p>

<p>This point of view persisted. Mathilde was almost happy that
day, for she was altogether in love; you would have said that never
had that heart been stirred by pride&mdash;and such pride!</p>

<p>She shuddered with horror when, that evening in the
drawing-room, a footman announced Madame de Fervaques; the man's
voice seemed to her to have a sinister sound. She could not endure
the sight of the Marechale, and quickly left the room. Julien, with
little pride in his hard-won victory, had been afraid lest his own
eyes should betray him, and had not dined at the Hotel de La
Mole.</p>

<p>His love and his happiness increased rapidly as the hour of
battle receded; he had already begun to find fault with himself.
'How could I resist her?' he asked himself; 'if she was going to
cease to love me! A single moment may alter that proud spirit, and
I must confess that I have treated her scandalously.'</p>

<p>In the evening, he felt that he absolutely must appear at the
Bouffes in Madame de Fervaques's box. She had given him an express
invitation: Mathilde would not fail to hear of his presence there
or of his discourteous absence. Despite the self-evidence of this
argument, he had not the strength, early in the evening, to plunge
into society. If he talked, he would forfeit half his
happiness.</p>

<p>Ten o'clock struck: he must absolutely show his face.</p>

<p>Fortunately he found the Marechale's box filled with women, and
was relegated to a place by the door, and entirely concealed by
their hats. This position saved him from making a fool of himself;
the divine accents of despair of Carolina in <i>Il matrimonio
segreto</i> made him burst into tears. Madame de Fervaques saw
these tears; they were in so marked a contrast to the manly
firmness of his usual appearance, that this spirit of a great lady
long saturated in all the most corrosive elements of the pride of
an upstart was touched by them. What little she had left of a
woman's heart led her to speak. She wished to enjoy the sound of
her own voice at that moment.</p>

<p>'Have you seen the ladies de La Mole,' she said to him, 'they
are in the third tier.' Instantly Julien bent forward into the
house, leaning somewhat rudely upon the ledge of the box: he saw
Mathilde; her eyes were bright with tears.</p>

<p>'And yet it is not their day for the Opera,' thought Julien;
'what eagerness!'</p>

<p>Mathilde had made her mother come to the Bouffes, despite the
inferior position of the box which a sycophant of their circle had
made haste to offer them. She wished to see whether Julien would
spend that evening with the Marechale.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch61" id="ch61"></a>Chapter 61. Making Her Afraid</h2>

<p style="margin-left:10%">So this is the fine miracle of your
civilisation!<br>
You have turned love into an ordinary matter.<br>
&mdash;BARNAVE</p>

<p>Julien hurried to Madame de La Mole's box. His eyes met first
the tearful eyes of Mathilde; she was weeping without restraint,
there was no one present but people of minor importance, the friend
who had lent them the box and some men of her acquaintance.
Mathilde laid her hand upon Julien's; she seemed to have forgotten
all fear of her mother. Almost stifled by her sobs, she said
nothing to him but the single word: 'Guarantees!'</p>

<p>'Whatever I do, I must not speak to her,' thought Julien,
greatly moved himself, and covering his eyes as best he could with
his hand, ostensibly to avoid the lustre that was blazing into the
boxes on the third tier. 'If I speak, she can no longer doubt the
intensity of my emotion, the sound of my voice will betray me, all
may be lost once more.'</p>

<p>His struggles were far more painful than in the morning, his
spirit had had time to grow disturbed. He was afraid of seeing
Mathilde's vanity wounded. Frantic with love and passion, he
pledged himself not to speak to her.</p>

<p>This is, to my mind, one of the finest traits of his character;
a person capable of such an effort to control himself may go far,
<i>si fata sinant</i>.</p>

<p>Mademoiselle de La Mole insisted upon taking Julien home.
Fortunately it was raining in torrents. But the Marquise made him
sit facing herself, talked to him continuously, and prevented his
saying a word to her daughter. One would have thought that the
Marquise was concerned for Julien's happiness; no longer afraid of
destroying everything by the intensity of his emotion, he abandoned
himself to it with frenzy.</p>

<p>Dare I say that on entering his own room Julien threw himself on
his knees and covered with kisses the love letters given him by
Prince Korasoff?</p>

<p>'Oh, you great man! What do I not owe to you?' he cried in his
frenzy.</p>

<p>Gradually a little coolness returned to him. He compared himself
to a general who had just won the first half of a great battle.
'The advantage is certain, immense,' he said to himself; 'but what
is going to happen tomorrow? An instant may ruin everything.'</p>

<p>He opened with a passionate impulse the <i>Memoirs dictated at
Saint Helena by Napoleon</i>, and for two solid hours forced
himself to read them; his eyes alone read the words, no matter, he
forced himself to the task. During this strange occupation, his
head and heart, rising to the level of everything that is most
great, were at work without his knowledge. 'This is a very
different heart from Madame de Rênal's,' he said to himself, but he
went no farther.</p>

<p>'Make her afraid,' he cried of a sudden, flinging the book from
him. 'The enemy will obey me only so long as I make him fear me,
then he will not dare to despise me.'</p>

<p>He paced up and down his little room, wild with joy. To be
frank, this happiness was due to pride rather than love.</p>

<p>'Make her afraid!' he repeated proudly to himself, and he had
reason to be proud. 'Even in her happiest moments, Madame de Rênal
always doubted whether my love were equal to hers. Here, it is a
demon that I am conquering, I must therefore conquer.'</p>

<p>He knew well that next morning, by eight o'clock, Mathilde would
be in the library; he did not appear there until nine, burning with
love, but his head controlled his heart. Not a single minute
passed, perhaps, without his repeating to himself: 'Always keep her
mind occupied with the great uncertainty: "Does he love me?" Her
privileged position, the flattery she receives from all who speak
to her make her a little too much inclined to self-assurance.'</p>

<p>He found her pale, calm, seated upon the divan, but incapable,
apparently, of making any movement. She offered him her hand.</p>

<p>'Dear, I have offended you, it is true; you are perhaps vexed
with me?'</p>

<p>Julien was not expecting so simple a tone. He was on the point
of betraying himself.</p>

<p>'You wish for guarantees, dear,' she went on after a silence
which she had hoped to see broken; 'that is only fair. Carry me
off, let us start for London. I shall be ruined for ever,
disgraced...' She found the courage to withdraw her hand from
Julien so as to hide her eyes with it. All the sentiments of
modesty and feminine virtue had returned to her heart...'Very well!
Disgrace me,' she said at length with a sigh, 'it is a
guarantee.'</p>

<p>'Yesterday I was happy, because I had the courage to be severe
with myself,' thought Julien. After a brief interval of silence, he
gained sufficient mastery over his heart to say in an icy tone:</p>

<p>'Once we are on the road to London, once you are disgraced, to
use your own words, who can promise me that you will love me? That
my company in the post-chaise will not seem to you an annoyance? I
am not a monster, to have ruined your reputation will be to me only
an additional grief. It is not your position in society that is the
obstacle, it is unfortunately your own nature. Can you promise
yourself that you will love me for a week?</p>

<p>'(Ah! Let her love me for a week, for a week only,' Julien
murmured to himself, 'and I shall die of joy. What do I care for
the future, what do I care for life itself? And this divine
happiness may begin at this moment if I choose, it depends entirely
upon myself!)'</p>

<p>Mathilde saw him turn pensive.</p>

<p>'So I am altogether unworthy of you,' she said, clasping his
hand.</p>

<p>Julien embraced her, but at once the iron hand of duty gripped
his heart. 'If she sees how I adore her, then I lose her.' And,
before withdrawing himself from her arms, he had resumed all the
dignity that befits a man.</p>

<p>On that day and the days that followed, he managed to conceal
the intensity of his bliss; there were moments in which he denied
himself even the pleasure of clasping her in his arms.</p>

<p>At other moments, the frenzy of happiness swept aside all the
counsels of prudence.</p>

<p>It was beside a bower of honeysuckle arranged so as to hide the
ladder, in the garden, that he was accustomed to take his stand in
order to gaze at the distant shutters of Mathilde's window and
lament her inconstancy. An oak of great size stood close by, and
the trunk of this tree prevented him from being seen by indiscreet
persons.</p>

<p>As he passed with Mathilde by this spot which recalled to him so
vividly the intensity of his grief, the contrast between past
despair and present bliss was too strong for him; tears flooded his
eyes, and, carrying to his lips the hand of his mistress: 'Here I
lived while I thought of you; from here I gazed at that shutter, I
awaited for hours on end the fortunate moment when I should see
this hand open it...'</p>

<p>He gave way completely. He portrayed to her, in those true
colours which one does not invent, the intensity of his despair at
that time. In spasmodic utterances he spoke of his present
happiness which had put an end to that cruel suffering...</p>

<p>'What am I doing, Great God!' said Julien, coming suddenly to
his senses. 'I am destroying everything.'</p>

<p>In the height of his alarm he thought he already saw less love
in the eyes of Mademoiselle de La Mole. This was an illusion; but
Julien's face changed rapidly and was flooded with a deathly
pallor. His eyes grew dull for a moment, and an expression of
arrogance not devoid of malice succeeded that of the most sincere,
the most whole-hearted love.</p>

<p>'Why, what is the matter with you, dear?' Mathilde tenderly,
anxiously inquired.</p>

<p>'I am lying,' said Julien savagely, 'and I am lying to you. I
reproach myself for it, and yet God knows that I respect you
sufficiently not to lie. You love me, you are devoted to me, and I
have no need to make fine speeches in order to please you.'</p>

<p>'Great God! They were only fine speeches, all the exquisite
things you have been saying to me for the last ten minutes?'</p>

<p>'And I reproach myself for them strongly, dear friend. I made
them up long ago for a woman who loved me and used to bore
me...That is the weak spot in my character, I denounce myself to
you, forgive me.'</p>

<p>Bitter tears streamed down Mathilde's cheeks.</p>

<p>'Whenever some trifle that has shocked me sets me dreaming for a
moment,' Julien went on, 'my execrable memory, which I could curse
at this moment, offers me a way of escape, and I abuse it.'</p>

<p>'So I have unconsciously done something that has displeased
you?' said Mathilde with a charming simplicity.</p>

<p>'One day, I remember, as you passed by these honeysuckles, you
plucked a flower, M. de Luz took it from you, and you let him keep
it. I was close beside you.'</p>

<p>'M. de Luz? It is impossible,' replied Mathilde with the dignity
that came so naturally to her: 'I never behave like that.'</p>

<p>'I am certain of it,' Julien at once rejoined.</p>

<p>'Ah, well! Then it must be true, dear,' said Mathilde, lowering
her eyes sadly. She was positive that for many months past she had
never allowed M. de Luz to take any such liberty.</p>

<p>Julien gazed at her with an inexpressible tenderness:</p>

<p>'No,' he said to himself, 'she does not love me any the
less.'</p>

<p>She rebuked him that evening, with a laugh, for his fondness for
Madame de Fervaques: a <i>bourgeois</i> in love with a
<i>parvenue</i>. 'Hearts of that class are perhaps the only ones
that my Julien cannot inflame. She has turned you into a regular
dandy,' she said, playing with his hair.</p>

<p>During the period in which he supposed himself to be scorned by
Mathilde, Julien had become one of the best-dressed men in Paris.
But he had an additional advantage over the other men of this sort;
once his toilet was performed, he never gave it another
thought.</p>

<p>One thing still vexed Mathilde. Julien continued to copy out the
Russian letters, and to send them to the Marechale.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch62" id="ch62"></a>Chapter 62. The Tiger</h2>

<p style="margin-left:10%">Alas! why these things and not
others!<br>
&mdash;BEAUMARCHAIS</p>

<p>An English traveller relates how he lived upon intimate terms
with a tiger; he had reared it and used to play with it, but always
kept a loaded pistol on the table.</p>

<p>Julien abandoned himself to the full force of his happiness only
at those moments when Mathilde could not read the expression of it
in his eyes. He was punctilious in his performance of the duty of
addressing a few harsh words to her from time to time.</p>

<p>When Mathilde's meekness, which he observed with astonishment,
and the intensity of her devotion came near to destroying all his
self-control, he had the courage to leave her abruptly.</p>

<p>For the first time Mathilde was in love.</p>

<p>Life, which had always crawled for her at a snail's pace, now
flew.</p>

<p>As it was essential, nevertheless, that her pride should find
some outlet, she sought to expose herself with temerity to all the
risks that her love could make her run. It was Julien who showed
prudence; and it was only when there was any question of danger
that she did not comply with his wishes; but, submissive, and
almost humble towards him, she showed all the more arrogance
towards anyone else who came near her in the house, relatives and
servants alike.</p>

<p>In the evenings in the drawing-room, she would summon Julien,
and would hold long conversations with him in private.</p>

<p>Little Tanbeau took his place one evening beside them; she asked
him to go to the library and fetch her the volume of Smollett which
dealt with the Revolution of 1688; and as he seemed to hesitate:
There is no need to hurry,' she went on with an expression of
insulting arrogance, which was balm to Julien's spirit.</p>

<p>'Did you notice the look in that little monster's eyes?' he
asked her.</p>

<p>'His uncle has done ten or twelve years of service in this
drawing-room, otherwise I should have him shown the door this
instant.'</p>

<p>Her behaviour towards MM. de Croisenois, de Luz, and the rest,
perfectly polite in form, was scarcely less provoking in substance.
Mathilde blamed herself severely for all the confidences she had
made to Julien in the past, especially as she did not dare confess
to him that she had exaggerated the almost wholly innocent marks of
interest of which those gentlemen had been the object.</p>

<p>In spite of the most admirable resolutions, her womanly pride
prevented her every day from saying to Julien: 'It was because I
was speaking to you that I found pleasure in the thought of my
weakness in not withdrawing my hand when M. de Croisenois laid his
hand on a marble table beside mine, and managed to touch it.'</p>

<p>Nowadays, whenever one of these gentlemen had spoken to her for
a few moments, she found that she had a question to ask Julien, and
this was a pretext for keeping him by her side.</p>

<p>She found that she was pregnant, and told the news joyfully to
Julien.</p>

<p>'Now will you doubt me? Is not this a guarantee? I am your wife
for ever.'</p>

<p>This announcement filled Julien with profound astonishment. He
was on the point of forgetting his principle of conduct. 'How can I
be deliberately cold and offensive to this poor girl who is ruining
herself for me?' Did she appear at all unwell, even on the days on
which wisdom made her dread accents heard, he no longer found the
courage to address to her one of those cruel speeches, so
indispensable, in his experience, to the continuance of their
love.</p>

<p>'I mean to write to my father,' Mathilde said to him one day;
'he is more than a father to me; he is a friend; and so I should
feel it unworthy of you and of myself to seek to deceive him, were
it only for a moment.'</p>

<p>'Great God! What are you going to do?' said Julien in alarm.</p>

<p>'My duty,' she replied, her eyes sparkling with joy.</p>

<p>She felt herself to be more magnanimous than her lover.</p>

<p>'But he will turn me from the house in disgrace!'</p>

<p>'He is within his rights, we must respect them. I shall give you
my arm, and we shall go out by the front door, in the full light of
day.'</p>

<p>Julien in astonishment begged her to wait for a week.</p>

<p>'I cannot,' she replied, 'the voice of honour speaks. I have
seen what is my duty, I must obey, and at once.'</p>

<p>'Very well! I order you to wait,' said Julien at length. 'Your
honour is covered, I am your husband. This drastic step is going to
alter both our positions. I also am within my rights. Today is
Tuesday; next Tuesday is the day of the Duc de Retz's party; that
evening, when M. de La Mole comes home, the porter shall hand him
the fatal letter...He thinks only of making you a Duchess, of that
I am certain; think of his grief!'</p>

<p>'Do you mean by that: think of his revenge?'</p>

<p>'I may feel pity for my benefactor, distress at the thought of
injuring him; but I do not and never shall fear any man.'</p>

<p>Mathilde submitted. Since she had told Julien of her condition,
this was the first time that he had spoken to her with authority;
never had he loved her so dearly. It was with gladness that the
softer side of his heart seized the pretext of Mathilde's condition
to forgo the duty of saying a few cruel words. The idea of a
confession to M. de La Mole disturbed him greatly. Was he going to
be parted from Mathilde? And, however keen the distress with which
she saw him go, a month after his departure would she give him a
thought?</p>

<p>He felt almost as great a horror of the reproaches which the
Marquis might justly heap upon him.</p>

<p>That evening, he admitted to Mathilde this second cause of his
distress, and then, carried away by love, admitted the other
also.</p>

<p>She changed colour.</p>

<p>'Indeed,' she said, 'six months spent out of my company would be
a grief to you!'</p>

<p>'Immense, the only one in the world on which I look with
terror.'</p>

<p>Mathilde was delighted. Julien had played his part with such
thoroughness that he had succeeded in making her think that of the
two she was the more in love.</p>

<p>The fatal Tuesday came. At midnight, on returning home, the
Marquis found a letter with the form of address which indicated
that he was to open it himself, and only when he was
unobserved.</p>

<p>'MY FATHER,</p>

<p>'Every social tie that binds us is broken, there remain only the
ties of nature. After my husband, you are and will ever be the
dearest person in the world to me. My eyes fill with tears, I think
of the distress that I am causing you, but, that my shame may not
be made public, to give you time to deliberate and act, I have been
unable to postpone any further the confession that I owe you. If
your affection for me, which I know to be extreme, chooses to allow
me a small pension, I shall go and settle myself where you please,
in Switzerland, for instance, with my husband. His name is so
obscuré that no one will recognise your daughter in Madame Sorel,
daughter-in-law of a carpenter of Verrières. There you have the
name I have found it so hard to write. I dread, for Julien, your
anger, apparently so righteous. I shall not be a Duchess, Father;
but I knew it when I fell in love with him; for it was I that fell
in love first, it was I who seduced him. I inherit from you a
spirit too exalted to let my attention be arrested by what is or
seems to me vulgar. It is in vain that with the idea of pleasing
you I have thought of M. de Croisenois. Why did you place real
merit before my eyes? You told me yourself on my return from
Hyeres: "This young Sorel is the only person who amuses me"; the
poor boy is as greatly distressed as myself, if it be possible, by
the pain which this letter must cause you. I cannot prevent your
being angry with me as a father; but care for me still as a
friend.</p>

<p>'Julien respected me. If he spoke to me now and again, it was
solely because of his profound gratitude to you: for the natural
pride of his character leads him never to reply save officially to
anyone who is placed so far above him. He has a strong and inborn
sense of the differences of social position. It was I, I admit,
with a blush, to my best friend, and never shall such an admission
be made to any other, it was I who one day in the garden pressed
his arm.</p>

<p>'In twenty-four hours from now, why should you be angry with
him? My fault is irreparable. If you require it, I shall be the
channel to convey to you the assurances of his profound respect and
of his distress at displeasing you. You will not set eyes on him;
but I shall go and join him wherever he may choose. It is his
right, it is my duty, he is the father of my child. If in your
generosity you are pleased to allow us six thousand francs upon
which to live, I shall accept them with gratitude: otherwise,
Julien intends to settle at Besançon where he will take up the
profession of teacher of Latin and Literature. However low the
degree from which he springs, I am certain that he will rise. With
him, I have no fear of obscurity. If there be a Revolution, I am
sure of a leading part for him. Could you say as much for any of
those who have sought my hand? They have fine estates? I cannot
find in that single circumstance a reason for admiration. My Julien
would attain to a high position even under the present form of
government, if he had a million and were protected by my
father...'</p>

<p>Mathilde, who knew that the Marquis was a man entirely governed
by first impressions, had written eight pages.</p>

<p>'What is to be done?' Julien said to himself while M. de La Mole
was reading this letter; 'where do, first of all, my duty,
secondly, my interest lie? The debt that I owe him is immense: I
should have been, but for him, a rascally understrapper, and not
rascal enough to be hated and persecuted by the rest. He has made
me a man of the world. My necessary rascalities will be, first of
all, rarer, and secondly, less ignoble. That is more than if he had
given me a million. I owe to him this Cross and the record of
so-called diplomatic services which have raised me above my
rank.</p>

<p>'If he were to take his pen to prescribe my conduct, what would
he write?'</p>

<p>Julien was sharply interrupted by M. de La Mole's old valet.</p>

<p>'The Marquis wishes to see you this moment, dressed or
undressed.'</p>

<p>The valet added in an undertone as they were side by side: 'He
is furious, beware.'</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch63" id="ch63"></a>Chapter 63. The Torment of the
Weak</h2>

<p style="margin-left:10%">In cutting this diamond, a clumsy
jeweller removed some<br>
of its brightest sparkles. In the Middle Ages, what am<br>
I saying? even under Richelieu, a Frenchman still had<br>
the power to desire.<br>
&mdash;MIRABEAU</p>

<p>Julien found the Marquis furious: for the first time in his
life, perhaps, this gentleman was guilty of bad taste; he heaped on
Julien all the insults that came to his lips. Our hero was
astonished, irritated, but his sense of gratitude was not shaken.
'How many fine projects long cherished in his secret thoughts, the
poor man sees crumble in an instant. But I owe it to him to answer
him, my silence would increase his rage.' His answer was furnished
for him from the part of Tartuffe.</p>

<p>'<i>I am no angel</i>...I have served you well, you have
rewarded me generously...I was grateful, but I am twenty-two years
old...In this household, my thoughts were intelligible only to
yourself, and to that obliging person...'</p>

<p>'Monster!' cried the Marquis. 'Obliging! Obliging! On the day
when you found her obliging, you ought to have fled.'</p>

<p>'I made an attempt; I asked you if I might go to Languedoc.'</p>

<p>Tired of pacing the room in fury, the Marquis, broken by grief,
threw himself into an armchair; Julien heard him murmur to himself:
'This is no scoundrel.'</p>

<p>'No, I am not one to you,' cried Julien, falling at his feet.
But he felt extremely ashamed of this impulse and rose quickly.</p>

<p>The Marquis was really out of his mind. On seeing this movement
he began again to shower upon Julien atrocious insults worthy of a
cab-driver. The novelty of these oaths was perhaps a
distraction.</p>

<p>'What? My daughter is to be called Madame Sorel! What! My
daughter is not to be a Duchess!' Whenever these two ideas
presented themselves in such clear terms, the Marquis was in
torment, and his impulses were uncontrolled. Julien began to fear a
thrashing.</p>

<p>In his lucid intervals, and when the Marquis began to grow
accustomed to his disgrace, his reproaches became quite
reasonable.</p>

<p>'You ought to have gone, Sir,' he said. 'It was your duty to
go...You are the meanest of mankind...'</p>

<p>Julien went to the table and wrote:</p>

<p>'<i>For a long time my life has been insupportable, I am putting
an end to it. I beg Monsieur le Marquis to accept, with my
expression of a gratitude that knows no bounds, my apologies for
the trouble which my death in his house may cause</i>.'</p>

<p>'Will Monsieur le Marquis deign to peruse this paper...Kill me,'
said Julien, 'or have me killed by your valet. It is one o'clock in
the morning, I am going to stroll in the garden towards the wall at
the far end.'</p>

<p>'Go to the devil,' the Marquis shouted after him as he left the
room.</p>

<p>'I understand,' thought Julien; 'he would not be sorry to see me
spare his valet the responsibility for my death...Let him kill me,
well and good, it is a satisfaction that I am offering him...But,
by Jove, I am in love with life...I owe myself to my child.'</p>

<p>This idea, which for the first time appeared thus clearly before
his imagination, completely absorbed him after the first few
minutes of his stroll had been devoted to the sense of danger.</p>

<p>This entirely novel interest made a prudent creature of him. 'I
need advice to guide me in dealing with that fiery man...He has no
judgment, he is capable of anything. Fouque is too far off, besides
he would not understand the sentiments of a heart like the
Marquis's.</p>

<p>'Conte Altamira...Can I be sure of eternal silence? My request
for advice must not be a definite action, nor complicate my
position. Alas! There is no one left but the sombre abbe
Pirard...His mind is narrowed by Jansenism...A rascally Jesuit
would know the world better, and would be more to my purpose...M.
Pirard is capable of beating me, at the mere mention of my
crime.'</p>

<p>The genius of Tartuffe came to Julien's aid: 'Very well, I shall
go and confess to him.' This was the resolution to which he finally
came in the garden, after pacing it for fully two hours. He no
longer thought that he might be surprised by a gunshot; sleep was
overpowering him.</p>

<p>Next morning, before daybreak, Julien was several leagues from
Paris, knocking at the door of the stern Jansenist. He found,
greatly to his astonishment, that the other was not unduly
surprised at his confession.</p>

<p>'I ought perhaps to blame myself,' the abbe said to himself,
more anxious than angry. 'I had thought that I detected this love
affair. My affection for yourself, you little wretch, restrained me
from warning her father...'</p>

<p>'What will he do?' Julien asked him boldly.</p>

<p>(At that moment, he loved the abbe and a scene would have been
most painful to him.)</p>

<p>'I can see three courses of action,' Julien continued: 'First of
all, M. de La Mole may have me put to death'; and he told the abbe
of the letter announcing his suicide which he had left with the
Marquis; 'secondly, he may have me shot down by Comté Norbert, who
will challenge me to a duel.'</p>

<p>'You would accept?' said the abbe in a fury, rising to his
feet.</p>

<p>'You do not allow me to finish. Certainly I should never fire at
the son of my benefactor.</p>

<p>'Thirdly, he may send me away. If he says to me: "Go to
Edinburgh, to New York," I shall obey. Then they can conceal
Mademoiselle de La Mole's condition; but I shall never allow them
to destroy my child.'</p>

<p>'That, you may be sure, will be the first idea to occur to that
corrupt man...'</p>

<p>In Paris, Mathilde was in despair. She had seen her father about
seven o'clock. He had shown her Julien's letter, she trembled lest
he should have deemed it noble to put an end to his life: 'And
without my permission?' she said to herself with an agony which
partook of anger.</p>

<p>'If he is dead, I shall die,' she said to her father. 'It is you
that will be the cause of my death...You will rejoice at it,
perhaps...But I swear to his ghost that I shall at once put on
mourning, and shall be publicly <i>Madame veuve Sorel</i> [the
widow of M. Sorel], I shall send out the usual announcements, you
may count on that...You will not find me pusillanimous nor a
coward.'</p>

<p>Her love rose to the pitch of madness. It was now M. de La
Mole's turn to be left speechless.</p>

<p>He began to look upon what had happened more reasonably. At
luncheon Mathilde did not put in an appearance. The Marquis was
relieved of an immense burden, and flattered as well, when he
discovered that she had said nothing to her mother.</p>

<p>Julien dismounted from his horse. Mathilde sent for him, and
flung herself into his arms almost in the sight of her maid. Julien
was not unduly grateful for this transport, he had come away most
diplomatic and most calculating from his long conference with the
abbe Pirard. His imagination was extinguished by the calculation of
possibilities. Mathilde, with tears in her eyes, informed him that
she had seen the letter announcing his suicide.</p>

<p>'My father may change his mind; oblige me by setting off
instantly for Villequier. Mount your horse, leave the premises
before they rise from table.'</p>

<p>As Julien did not in any way alter his air of cold astonishment,
she burst into a flood of tears.</p>

<p>'Allow me to manage our affairs,' she cried to him with a
transport, clasping him in her arms. 'You know very well that it is
not of my own free will that I part from you. Write under cover to
my maid, let the address be in a strange hand; as for me, I shall
write you volumes. Farewell! Fly.'</p>

<p>This last word wounded Julien, he obeyed nevertheless. 'It is
fated,' he thought, 'that even in their best moments, these people
must find a way of hurting me.'</p>

<p>Mathilde put up a firm resistance to all her father's prudent
plans. She steadfastly refused to set the negotiation upon any
other basis than this: She was to be Madame Sorel, and would live
in poverty with her husband in Switzerland, or with her father in
Paris. She thrust from her the suggestion of a clandestine
confinement. 'That would pave the way to the possibility of calumny
and dishonour. Two months after our marriage, I shall travel abroad
with my husband, and it will be easy for us to pretend that my
child was born at a suitable date.'</p>

<p>Received at first with transports of rage, this firmness ended
by inspiring the Marquis with doubts.</p>

<p>In a weak moment: 'Here,' he said to his daughter, 'is a
transfer of ten thousand livres a year in the Funds, send it to
your Julien, and let him speedily make it impossible for me to
reclaim it.'</p>

<p>To obey Mathilde, whose love of giving orders he knew, Julien
had made an unnecessary journey of forty leagues: he was at
Villequier, examining the accounts of the agents; this generosity
on the part of the Marquis was the occasion of his return. He went
to seek asylum with the abbe Pirard, who, during his absence, had
become Mathilde's most effective ally. As often as he was
interrogated by the Marquis, he proved to him that any other course
than a public marriage would be a crime in the sight of God.</p>

<p>'And happily,' the abbe added, 'the wisdom of the world is here
in accordance with religion. Could you reckon for an instant,
knowing the fiery character of Mademoiselle de La Mole, upon a
secrecy which she had not imposed on herself? If you do not allow
the frank course of a public marriage, society will occupy itself
for far longer with this strange misalliance. Everything must be
stated at one time, without the least mystery, apparent or
real.'</p>

<p>'It is true,' said the Marquis, growing pensive. 'By this
method, to talk of the marriage after three days becomes the
chatter of a man who lacks ideas. We ought to profit by some great
anti-Jacobin measure by the Government to slip in unobserved in its
wake.'</p>

<p>Two or three of M. de La Mole's friends shared the abbe Pirard's
view. The great obstacle, in their eyes, was Mathilde's decided
nature. But in spite of all these specious arguments, the Marquis
could not grow reconciled to abandoning the hope of a
<i>tabouret</i> for his daughter.</p>

<p>His memory and his imagination were full of all sorts of
trickeries and pretences which had still been possible in his
younger days. To yield to necessity, to go in fear of the law
seemed to him an absurd thing and dishonouring to a man of his
rank. He was paying dearly for those enchanting dreams in which he
had indulged for the last ten years as to the future of his beloved
daughter.</p>

<p>'Who could have foreseen it?' he said to himself. 'A girl of so
haughty a character, so elevated a mind, prouder than myself of the
name she bears! One whose hand had been asked of me in advance by
all the most illustratious blood in France!</p>

<p>'We must abandon all prudence. This age is destined to bring
everything to confusion! We are marching towards chaos.'</p>

<p style="margin-left:10%">The prefect riding along on his horse
thought to himself,<br>
Why should I not be a minister, head of the Cabinet, a duke?<br>
This is how I would wage war...In that way I would have<br>
innovators put in chains.<br>
&mdash;<i>Le Globe</i></p>

<p>No argument is sufficient to destroy the mastery acquired by ten
years of pleasant fancies. The Marquis thought it unreasonable to
be angry, but could not bring himself to forgive. 'If this Julien
could die by accident,' he said to himself at times...Thus it was
that his sorrowful imagination found some relief in pursuing the
most absurd chimeras. They paralysed the influence of the wise
counsels of the abbe Pirard. A month passed in this way without the
slightest advance in the negotiations.</p>

<p>In this family affair, as in affairs of politics, the Marquis
had brilliant flashes of insight which would leave him enthusiastic
for three days on end. At such times a plan of conduct would not
please him because it was backed by sound reasons; the reasons
found favour in his sight only in so far as they supported his
favourite plan. For three days, he would labour with all the ardour
and enthusiasm of a poet, to bring matters to a certain position;
on the fourth, he no longer gave it a thought.</p>

<p>At first Julien was disconcerted by the dilatoriness of the
Marquis; but, after some weeks, he began to discern that M. de La
Mole had, in dealing with this affair, no definite plan.</p>

<p>Madame de La Mole and the rest of the household thought that
Julien had gone into the country to look after the estates; he was
in hiding in the abbe Pirard's presbytery, and saw Mathilde almost
every day; she, each morning, went to spend an hour with her
father, but sometimes they remained for weeks on end without
mentioning the matter that was occupying all their thoughts.</p>

<p>'I do not wish to know where that man is,' the Marquis said to
her one day; 'send him this letter.' Mathilde read:</p>

<p>'The estates in Languedoc bring in 20,600 francs. I give 10,600
francs to my daughter, and 10,000 francs to M. Julien Sorel. I make
over the estates themselves, that is to say. Tell the lawyer to
draft two separate deeds of gift, and to bring me them tomorrow;
after which, no further relations between us. Ah! Sir, how was I to
expect such a thing as this?</p>

<p>'LE MARQUIS DE LA MOLE'</p>

<p>'I thank you very much,' said Mathilde gaily. 'We are going to
settle in the Chateau d'Aiguillon, between Agen and Marmande. They
say that the country there is as beautiful as Italy.'</p>

<p>This donation came as a great surprise to Julien. He was no
longer the severe, cold man that we have known. The destiny of his
child absorbed all his thoughts in anticipation. This unexpected
fortune, quite considerable for so poor a man, made him ambitious.
He now saw, settled on his wife or himself, an income of 30,600
francs. As for Mathilde, all her sentiments were absorbed in one of
adoration of her husband, for thus it was that her pride always
named Julien. Her great, her sole ambition was to have her marriage
recognised. She spent her time in exaggerating the high degree of
prudence that she had shown in uniting her destiny with that of a
superior man. Personal merit was in fashion in her brain.</p>

<p>Their almost continuous separation, the multiplicity of
business, the little time that they had to talk of love, now
completed the good effect of the wise policy adopted by Julien in
the past.</p>

<p>Finally Mathilde grew impatient at seeing so little of the man
whom she had now come to love sincerely.</p>

<p>In a moment of ill humour she wrote to her father, and began her
letter like Othello:</p>

<p>'That I have preferred Julien to the attractions which society
offered to the daughter of M. le Marquis de La Mole, my choice of
him sufficiently proves. These pleasures of reputation and petty
vanity are nothing to me. It will soon be six weeks that I have
lived apart from my husband. That is enough to prove my respect for
you. Before next Thursday, I shall leave the paternal roof. Your
generosity has made us rich. No one knows my secret save the
estimable abbe Pirard. I shall go to him; he will marry us, and an
hour after the ceremony we shall be on our way to Languedoc, and
shall never appear again in Paris save by your order. But what
pierces me to the heart is that all this will furnish a savoury
anecdote at my expense, and at yours. May not the epigrams of a
foolish public oblige our excellent Norbert to seek a quarrel with
Julien? In that event, I know him, I should have no control over
him. We should find in his heart the plebeian in revolt. I implore
you on my knees, O my father, come and attend our wedding, in M.
Pirard's church, next Thursday. The point of the malicious anecdote
will be blunted, and the life of your only son, my husband's life
will be made safe,' etc., etc.</p>

<p>This letter plunged the Marquis in a strange embarrassment. He
must now at length make up his mind. AH his little habits, all his
commonplace friends had lost their influence.</p>

<p>In these strange circumstances, the salient features of his
character, stamped upon it by the events of his younger days,
resumed their full sway. The troubles of the Emigration had made
him a man of imagination. After he had enjoyed for two years an
immense fortune and all the distinctions of the Court, 1790 had
cast him into the fearful hardships of the Emigration. This hard
school had changed the heart of a man of two and twenty. Actually
he was encamped amid his present wealth rather than dominated by
it. But this same imagination which had preserved his soul from the
gangrene of gold, had left him a prey to an insane passion for
seeing his daughter adorned with a fine-sounding title.</p>

<p>During the six weeks that had just elapsed, urged at one moment
by a caprice, the Marquis had decided to enrich Julien; poverty
seemed to him ignoble, dishonouring to himself, M. de La Mole,
impossible in the husband of his daughter; he showered money upon
him. Next day, his imagination taking another direction, it seemed
to him that Julien would hear the silent voice of this generosity
in the matter of money, change his name, retire to America, write
to Mathilde that he was dead to her. M. de La Mole imagined this
letter as written, and traced its effect on his daughter's
character...</p>

<p>On the day on which he was awakened from these youthful dreams
by Mathilde's real letter, after having long thought of killing
Julien or of making him disappear, he was dreaming of building up
for him a brilliant future. He was making him take the name of one
of his properties; and why should he not securé the transmission of
his peerage to him? M. le Duc de Chaulnes, his father-in-law, had
spoken to him several times, since his only son had been killed in
Spain, of wishing to hand on his title to Norbert...</p>

<p>'One cannot deny that Julien shows a singular aptitude for
business, audacity, perhaps even brilliance,' the Marquis said to
himself...'But at the back of that character, I find something
alarming. It is the impression that he produces on everyone,
therefore there must be something real in it' (the more difficult
this reality was to grasp, the more it alarmed the imaginative
spirit of the old Marquis).</p>

<p>'My daughter expressed it to me very cleverly the other day' (in
a letter which we have suppressed): '"Julien belongs to no
drawing-room, to no set." He has not contrived to find any support
against me, not the slightest resource if I abandon him...But is
that due to ignorance of the actual state of society? Two or three
times I have said to him: "There is no real and profitable
candidature save that of the drawing-rooms..."</p>

<p>'No, he has not the adroit and cautious spirit of a pettifogger
who never loses a minute or an opportunity...It is not at all the
character of a Louis XI. On the other hand, I see in him the most
ungenerous maxims...I lose track of him...Does he repeat those
maxims to himself, to serve as a dam to his passions?</p>

<p>'Anyhow, one thing is clear: he cannot endure contempt, in that
way I hold him.</p>

<p>'He has not the religious feeling for high birth, it is true, he
does not respect us by instinct...That is bad; but, after all, the
heart of a seminarist should be impatient only of the want of
pleasure and money. He is very different; he cannot endure contempt
at any price.'</p>

<p>Forced by his daughter's letter, M. de La Mole saw the necessity
of making up his mind: 'Well, here is the great question: has
Julien's audacity gone the length of setting him to make love to my
daughter, because he knows that I love her more than anything in
the world, and that I have an income of a hundred thousand
crowns?</p>

<p>'Mathilde protests the opposite...No, master Julien, that is a
point upon which I wish to be under no illusion.</p>

<p>'Has there been genuine, unpremeditated love? Or rather a vulgar
desire to raise himself to a good position? Mathilde is
perspicacious, she felt from the first that this suspicion might
ruin him with me; hence that admission: it was she who thought
first of loving him...</p>

<p>'That a girl of so lofty a character should so far have
forgotten herself as to make tangible advances!...Press his arm in
the garden, one evening, how horrible! As though she had not had a
hundred less indelicate ways of letting him know that she favoured
him.</p>

<p>'To excuse is to accuse; I distrust Mathilde...' That day, the
Marquis's arguments were more conclusive than usual. Habit,
however, prevailed; he resolved to gain time and to write to his
daughter; for they communicated by letter between different parts
of the house. M. de La Mole dared not discuss matters with Mathilde
and hold out against her. He was afraid of bringing everything to
an end by a sudden concession.</p>

<p>'Take care not to commit any fresh act of folly; here is a
commission as Lieutenant of Hussars for M. le Chevalier Julien
Sorel de La Vernaye. You see what I am doing for him. Do not cross
me, do not question me. He shall start within twenty-four hours,
and report himself at Strasbourg, where his regiment is quartered.
Here is a draft upon my banker; I expect obedience.'</p>

<p>Mathilde's love and joy knew no bounds; she sought to profit by
her victory and replied at once:</p>

<p>'M. de La Vernaye would be at your feet, speechless with
gratitude, if he knew all that you are deigning to do for him. But,
in the midst of this generosity, my father has forgotten me; your
daughter's honour is in danger. A single indiscretion may leave an
everlasting blot, which an income of twenty thousand crowns would
not efface. I shall send this commission to M. de La Vernaye only
if you give me your word that, in the course of the next month, my
marriage shall be celebrated in public, at Villequier. Soon after
that period, which I beg you not to prolong, your daughter will be
unable to appear in public save with the name of Madame de La
Vernaye. How I thank you, dear Papa, for having saved me from the
name of Sorel,' etc., etc.</p>

<p>The reply was unexpected.</p>

<p>'Obey or I retract all. Tremble, rash girl, I do not yet know
what your Julien is, and you yourself know even less than I. Let
him start for Strasbourg, and put his best foot foremost. I shall
make my wishes known in a fortnight's time.'</p>

<p>The firmness of this reply astonished Mathilde. 'I do not know
Julien'; these words plunged her in a day-dream which presently
ended in the most enchanting suppositions; but she believed them to
be the truth. 'My Julien's mind has not donned the tawdry little
uniform of the drawing-rooms, and my father disbelieves in his
superiority because of the very fact which proves it...</p>

<p>'Anyhow, if I do not obey this sudden impulse, I foresee the
possibility of a public scene; a scandal lowers my position in
society, and may make me less attractive in Julien's eyes. After
the scandal...ten years of poverty; and the folly of choosing a
husband on account of his merit can only be saved from ridicule by
the most brilliant opulence. If I live apart from my father, at his
age, he may forget me...Norbert will marry some attractive, clever
woman: the old Louis XIV was beguiled by the Duchesse de
Bourgogne...'</p>

<p>She decided to obey, but refrained from communicating her
father's letter to Julien; his unaccountable nature might lead him
to commit some act of folly.</p>

<p>That evening, when she informed Julien that he was a Lieutenant
of Hussars, his joy knew no bounds. We may form an idea of it from
the ambition that marked his whole life, and from the passionate
love that he now felt for his child. The change of name filled him
with astonishment.</p>

<p>'At last,' he thought, 'the tale of my adventures is finished,
and the credit is all mine. I have contrived to make myself loved
by this monster of pride,' he added, looking at Mathilde; 'her
father cannot live without her, nor she without me.'</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch65" id="ch65"></a>Chapter 65. A Storm.</h2>

<p style="margin-left:10%">My God, give me mediocrity!<br>
&mdash;MIRABEAU</p>

<p>He was completely absorbed; he made only a half-hearted response
to the keen affection that she showed for him. He remained taciturn
and sombre. Never had he appeared so great, so adorable in the eyes
of Mathilde. She feared some subtle refinement of his pride which
would presently upset the whole position.</p>

<p>Almost every morning, she saw the abbe Pirard come to the Hotel.
Through his agency might not Julien have penetrated to some extent
into her father's intentions? Might not the Marquis himself, in a
moment of caprice, have written to him? After so great a happiness,
how was she to account for Julien's air of severity? She dared not
question him.</p>

<p><i>Dared not</i>! She, Mathilde! There was, from that moment, in
her feeling for Julien, something vague, unaccountable, almost akin
to terror. That sere heart felt all the passion that is possible in
one brought up amid all that excess of civilisation which Paris
admires.</p>

<p>Early next morning, Julien was in the abbe Pirard's presbytery.
A pair of post-horses arrived in the courtyard drawing a
dilapidated chaise, hired at the nearest post.</p>

<p>'Such an equipage is no longer in keeping,' the stern abbe told
him, with a cantankerous air. 'Here are twenty thousand francs, of
which M. de La Mole makes you a present; he expects you to spend
them within the year, but to try and make yourself as little
ridiculous as possible.' (In so large a sum, bestowed on a young
man, the priest saw only an occasion of sin.)</p>

<p>'The Marquis adds: "M. Julien de La Vernaye will have received
this money from his father, whom there is no use in my identifying
more precisely. M. de La Vernaye will doubtless think it proper to
make a present to M. Sorel, carpenter at Verrières, who looked
after him in his childhood..." I will undertake this part of the
commission,' the abbe went on; 'I have at last made M. de La Mole
decide to compromise with that abbe de Frilair, who is such a
Jesuit. His position is unquestionably too strong for us. The
implicit recognition of your noble birth by that man who governs
Besançon will be one of the implied conditions of the
arrangement.'</p>

<p>Julien was no longer able to control his enthusiasm, he embraced
the abbe, he saw himself recognised.</p>

<p>'Fie!' said M. Pirard, and thrust him away; 'what is the meaning
of this worldly vanity? As for Sorel and his sons, I shall offer
them, in my name, an annual pension of five hundred francs, which
will be paid to each of them separately, so long as I am satisfied
with them.'</p>

<p>Julien was by this time cold and stiff. He thanked the abbe, but
in the vaguest terms and without binding himself to anything. 'Can
it indeed be possible,' he asked himself, 'that I am the natural
son of some great nobleman, banished among our mountains by the
terrible Napoleon?' Every moment this idea seemed to him less
improbable...'My hatred for my father would be a proof...I should
no longer be a monster!'</p>

<p>A few days after this monologue, the Fifteenth Regiment of
Hussars, one of the smartest in the Army, was drawn up in order of
battle on the parade ground of Strasbourg. M. le Chevalier de La
Vernaye was mounted upon the finest horse in Alsace, which had cost
him six thousand francs. He had joined as Lieutenant, without
having ever been a Second Lieutenant, save on the muster-roll of a
Regiment of which he had never even heard.</p>

<p>His impassive air, his severe and almost cruel eyes, his pallor,
his unalterable coolness won him a reputation from the first day.
In a short time, his perfect and entirely measured courtesy, his
skill with the pistol and sabre, which he made known without undue
affectation, removed all temptation to joke audibly at his expense.
After five or six days of hesitation, the general opinion of the
Regiment declared itself in his favour. 'This young man has
everything,' said the older officers who were inclined to banter,
'except youth.'</p>

<p>&gt;From Strasbourg, Julien wrote to M. Chélan, the former curé
of Verrières, who was now reaching the extreme limits of old
age:</p>

<p>'You will have learned with a joy, of which I have no doubt, of
the events that have led my family to make me rich. Here are five
hundred francs which I beg you to distribute without display, and
with no mention of my name, among the needy, who are poor now as I
was once, and whom you are doubtless assisting as in the past you
assisted me.'</p>

<p>Julien was intoxicated with ambition and not with vanity; he
still applied a great deal of his attention to his outward
appearance. His horses, his uniforms, the liveries of his servants
were kept up with a nicety which would have done credit to the
punctiliousness of a great English nobleman. Though only just a
Lieutenant, promoted by favour and after two days' service, he was
already calculating that, in order to be Commander in Chief at
thirty, at latest, like all the great Generals, he would need at
three and twenty to be something more than Lieutenant. He could
think of nothing but glory and his son.</p>

<p>It was in the midst of the transports of the most frenzied
ambition that he was interrupted by a young footman from the Hotel
de La Mole, who arrived with a letter.</p>

<p>'All is lost,' Mathilde wrote to him; 'hasten here as quickly as
possible, sacrifice everything, desert if need be. As soon as you
arrive, wait for me in a cab, outside the little gate of the
garden, No.&mdash; Rue &mdash;&mdash;. I shall come out to speak to you;
perhaps I may be able to let you into the garden. All is lost, and,
I fear, beyond hope of repair; count upon me, you will find me
devoted and steadfast in adversity. I love you.'</p>

<p>In a few minutes, Julien obtained leave from his Colonel, and
left Strasbourg at a gallop; but the fearful anxiety which was
devouring him did not allow him to continue this method of travel
farther than Metz. He flung himself into a post-chaise; and it was
with an almost incredible rapidity that he arrived at the appointed
place, outside the little gate of the garden of the Hotel de La
Mole. The gate was flung open, and in a moment, Mathilde,
forgetting all self-respect, threw herself into his arms.
Fortunately, it was but five o'clock in the morning and the street
was still deserted.</p>

<p>'All is lost; my father, dreading my tears, went away on
Thursday night. Where? No one knows. Here is his letter; read it.'
And she got into the cab with Julien.</p>

<p>'I could forgive everything, except the plan of seducing you
because you are rich. That, unhappy girl, is the appalling truth. I
give you my word of honour that I will never consent to a marriage
with that man. I promise him an income of ten thousand livres if he
consents to live abroad, beyond the frontiers of France, or better
still in America. Read the letter which I have received in reply to
a request for information. The shameless scoundrel had himself
invited me to write to Madame de Rênal. Never will I read a line
from you about the man. I have a horror of Paris and of you. I
request you to cloak with the greatest secrecy what must shortly
happen. Renounce honestly a vile fellow, and you will regain a
father.'</p>

<p>'Where is Madame de Rênal's letter?' said Julien coldly. 'Here
it is. I did not wish to show it to you until you were
prepared.'</p>

<p>LETTER</p>

<p>'What I owe to the sacred cause of religion and morals obliges
me, Sir, to the painful step which I take in addressing you; a
rule, which admits of no relaxation, orders me at this moment to do
harm to my neighbour, but in order to avoid a greater scandal. The
grief which I feel must be overborne by a sense of duty. It is only
too true, Sir, the conduct of the person with regard to whom you
ask me to tell the whole truth may have seemed inexplicable or
indeed honourable. It may have been thought expedient to conceal or
to disguise a part of the truth, prudence required this as well as
religion. But that conduct, which you desire to know, has been in
fact extremely reprehensible, and more so than I can say. Poor and
avaricious, it is by the aid of the most consummate hypocrisy, and
by the seduction of a weak and unhappy woman, that this man has
sought to make a position for himself and to become somebody. It is
a part of my painful duty to add that I am obliged to believe that
M. J&mdash;&mdash; has no religious principles. I am bound in
conscience to think that one of his avenues to success in a
household is to seek to seduce the woman who has most influence
there. Cloaked by a show of disinterestedness and by phrases from
novels, his great and sole object is to contrive to securé control
over the master of the house and over his fortune. He leaves in his
wake misery and undying regret,' etc., etc., etc.</p>

<p>This letter, extremely long and half obliterated by tears, was
certainly in the hand of Madame de Rênal; it was even written with
greater care than usual.</p>

<p>'I cannot blame M. de La Mole,' said Julien when he had finished
reading it; 'he is just and prudent. What father would give his
beloved daughter to such a man! Farewell!'</p>

<p>Julien sprang out of the cab, and ran to his post-chaise which
had drawn up at the end of the street. Mathilde, whom he seemed to
have forgotten, followed him for a little way; but the sight of the
tradesmen who were coming to the doors of their shops, and to whom
she was known, forced her to retire in haste into the garden.</p>

<p>Julien had set off for Verrières. On this rapid journey, he was
unable to write to Mathilde as he had intended, his hand traced
nothing more than an illegible scrawl on the paper.</p>

<p>He arrived at Verrières on a Sunday morning. He entered the shop
of the local gunsmith, who congratulated him effusively on his
recent access to fortune. It was the talk of the town.</p>

<p>Julien had some difficulty in making him understand that he
required a brace of pistols. The gunsmith, at his request, loaded
the pistols.</p>

<p>The <i>three bells</i> sounded; this is a signal well known in
French villages, which, after the various peals of the morning,
announces that mass is just about to begin.</p>

<p>Julien entered the new church of Verrières. All the tall windows
of the building were screened by crimson curtains. He found himself
standing a few yards behind Madame de Rênal's bench. He had the
impression that she was praying with fervour. The sight of this
woman who had loved him so dearly made Julien's arm tremble so
violently that he could not at first carry out his design. 'I
cannot,' he said to himself; 'I am physically incapable of it.'</p>

<p>At that moment, the young clerk who was serving mass rang the
bell for the Elevation. Madame de Rênal bowed her head which for a
moment was almost entirely concealed by the folds of her shawl. Her
aspect was less familiar to Julien; he fired a shot at her with one
pistol and missed her, he fired a second shot; she fell.</p>

<hr>

avenged myself. I have deserved death, and here<br>
I am. Pray for my soul.<br>
&mdash;SCHILLER</p>

<p>Julien remained motionless, seeing nothing. When he came to
himself a little, he noticed the whole congregation rushing from
the church; the priest had left the altar. Julien set off at a
leisurely pace in the wake of some women who were screaming as they
went. One woman, who was trying to escape faster than the rest,
gave him a violent push; he fell. His feet were caught in a chair
overturned by the crowd; as he rose, he felt himself gripped by the
collar; it was a gendarme in full uniform who was arresting him.
Mechanically Julien's hand went to his pocket pistols; but a second
gendarme seized him by the arms.</p>

<p>He was led away to prison. They took him into a room, put irons
on his wrists, and left him by himself; the door was shut on him
and double-locked; all this was carried out quickly, and he
remained unconscious of it.</p>

<p>'Faith, all is over,' he said aloud on coming to himself...'Yes,
in a fortnight the guillotine...or suicide between now and
then.'</p>

<p>His reasoning went no farther; he felt a pain in his head as
though it had been gripped with violence. He looked round to see if
anyone was holding it. A few moments later, he fell into a deep
slumber.</p>

<p>Madame de Rênal was not mortally wounded. The first bullet had
passed through her hat; as she turned round, the second shot had
been fired. This bullet had struck her in the shoulder, and, what
was surprising, had glanced back from the shoulder-blade, which
nevertheless it shattered, against a gothic pillar, from which it
broke off a huge splinter of stone.</p>

<p>When, after a long and painful examination, the surgeon, a grave
man, said to Madame de Rênal: 'I answer for your life as for my
own,' she was deeply affected.</p>

<p>For a long time she had sincerely longed for death. The letter
which she had been ordered to write by her confessor of the moment,
and had written to M. de La Mole, had dealt the final blow to this
creature weakened by an ever-present sorrow. This sorrow was
Julien's absence; she herself called it remorse. Her director, a
young cleric, virtuous and fervent, recently arrived from Dijon,
was under no illusion.</p>

<p>'To die thus, but not by my own hand, is not a sin,' thought
Madame de Rênal. 'God will pardon me perhaps for rejoicing in my
death.' She dared not add: 'And to die by the hand of Julien is the
acme of bliss.'</p>

<p>As soon as she was rid of the presence of the surgeon, and of
all her friends who had come crowding round her, she sent for
Elisa, her maid.</p>

<p>'The gaoler,' she said to her, blushing deeply, 'is a cruel man.
Doubtless he intends to maltreat him, thinking that by so doing he
will be pleasing me...The thought of such a thing is unendurable.
Could you not go, as though on your own behalf, and give the gaoler
this packet which contains a few louis? You will tell him that
religion does not permit his maltreating him...But on no account
must he mention this gift of money.'</p>

<p>It was to this circumstance that Julien was indebted for the
humanity of the gaoler of Verrières; he was still that M. Noiroud,
the loyal supporter of the government, whom we have seen thrown
into such a panic by the arrival of M. Appert.</p>

<p>A magistrate appeared in the prison. 'I have taken life with
premeditation,' Julien said to him; 'I bought the pistols and had
them loaded by So-and-so, the gunsmith. Article 1342. of the Penal
Code is quite clear, I deserve death and await it.' The magistrate,
surprised by the character of this reply, sought to multiply his
questions so that the accused might contradict himself in his
answers.</p>

<p>'But don't you see,' Julien said to him with a smile, 'that I am
making myself out as guilty as you can wish? Go, Sir, you shall not
lack the quarry that you are pursuing. You shall have the pleasure
of passing sentence. Spare me your presence.</p>

<p>'I have still a tiresome duty to perform,' thought Julien, 'I
must write to Mademoiselle de La Mole.</p>

<p>'I have avenged myself,' he told her. 'Unfortunately, my name
will appear in the newspapers, and I cannot escape from this world
incognito. I shall die within two months. My revenge has been
terrible, like the grief of being parted from you. From this
moment, I forbid myself to write and to utter your name. Never
speak of me, even to my son: silence is the only way of honouring
me. To the average man I shall be a common murderer...Allow me to
tell the truth in this supreme moment: you will forget me. This
great catastrophe, as to which I recommend you never to open your
lips to a living soul, will suppress for some years all the
romantic and unduly adventurous element that I saw in your
character. You were made to live among the heroes of the Middle
Ages; show in this crisis their firmness of character. Let what is
bound to happen be accomplished in secret and without compromising
you. You will take a false name and dispense with a confidant. If
you must absolutely have the assistance of a friend, I bequeath to
you the abbe Pirard.</p>

<p>'Do not speak to anyone else, especially to men of your own
class; de Luz or Caylus.</p>

<p>'A year after my death, marry M. de Croisenois; I order you as
your husband. Do not write to me at all, I should not answer you.
Though far less of a villain than Iago, or so it seems to me, I
shall say like him: <i>From this time forth I never will speak
word</i>.</p>

<p>'No one shall see me either speak or write; you will have had my
last words, with my last adoration.</p>

<p>'J. S.'</p>

<p>It was after he had sent off this letter that for the first
time, Julien, having slightly recovered himself, became extremely
unhappy. One by one, each of the hopes of his ambition must be
wrenched from his heart by those solemn words: 'I am to die.'
Death, in itself, was not <i>horrible</i> in his eyes. His whole
life had been merely a long preparation for misfortune, and he had
certainly never forgotten what is reckoned the greatest misfortune
of all.</p>

<p>'Why!' he said to himself, 'if in sixty days I had to fight a
duel with a man who was a champion fencer, should I be so weak as
to think of it incessantly and with terror in my soul?'</p>

<p>He spent more than an hour in seeking to discover his exact
sentiments in this connection.</p>

<p>When he had seen clearly into his soul, and the truth appeared
before his eyes as sharply defined as one of the pillars of his
prison, he thought of remorse.</p>

<p>'Why should I feel any? I have been outraged in a terrible
manner; I have taken life, I deserve death, but that is all. I die
after having paid my reckoning with humanity. I leave behind me no
unfulfilled obligation, I owe nothing to anyone; there is nothing
shameful in my death but the instrument of it: that by itself, it
is true, will amply suffice to shame me in the eyes of the
townsfolk of Verrières; but, from an intellectual point of view,
what could be more contemptible? There remains one way of acquiring
distinction in their eyes: namely, by scattering gold coins among
the crowd on my way to the scaffold. My memory, linked with the
thought of gold, will then be resplendent to them.'</p>

<p>After this consideration, which at the end of a minute seemed to
him conclusive: 'I have nothing more to do on earth,' Julien said
to himself and fell into a deep slumber.</p>

<p>About nine o'clock in the evening, the gaoler awakened him by
bringing in his supper.</p>

<p>'What are they saying in Verrières?'</p>

<p>'Monsieur Julien, the oath that I took before the Crucifix, in
the King's court, the day I was installed in my post, compels me to
keep silence.'</p>

<p>He was silent, but remained in the room. The spectacle of this
vulgar hypocrisy amused Julien. 'I must,' he thought, 'keep him
waiting a long time for the five francs which he wants as the price
of his conscience.'</p>

<p>When the gaoler saw the meal come to an end without any attempt
at corruption:</p>

<p>'The friendship that I feel for you, Monsieur Julien,' he began,
with a false, winning air, 'obliges me to speak; although they may
say that it is against the interests of justice, because it may
help you to arrange your defence...Monsieur Julien, who has a good
heart, will be glad if I tell him that Madame de Rênal is going on
well.'</p>

<p>'What! She is not dead?' cried Julien, beside himself with
amazement.</p>

<p>'What! Didn't you know?' said the gaoler with an air of
stupidity which presently turned to one of joyful greed. 'It would
only be right for Monsieur to give something to the surgeon who,
according to law and justice, ought not to speak. But, to oblige
Monsieur, I went to his house, and he told me everything...'</p>

<p>'In short, the injury is not mortal,' said Julien, losing
patience, 'you answer for that with your life?'</p>

<p>The gaoler, a giant six feet in stature, took fright and
retreated towards the door. Julien saw that he was going the wrong
way to reach the truth, he sat down again and tossed a napoleon to
M. Noiroud.</p>

<p>As the man's story began to convince Julien that Madame de
Rênal's injury was not mortal, he felt himself overcome by tears.
'Leave me!' he said suddenly.</p>

<p>The gaoler obeyed. As soon as the door was shut: 'Great God! She
is not dead!' exclaimed Julien; and he fell on his knees, weeping
hot tears.</p>

<p>In this supreme moment he was a believer. What matter the
hypocrisies of the priests? Can they destroy anything of the truth
and sublimity of the idea of God?</p>

<p>Only then did Julien begin to repent of the crime that he had
committed. By a coincidence which saved him from despair, at that
moment only had passed away the state of irritation and
semi-insanity in which he had been plunged since leaving Paris for
Verrières.</p>

<p>His tears sprang from a generous source, he had no doubt as to
the sentence that was in store for him.</p>

<p>'And so she will live!' he said to himself...'She will live to
pardon me and to love me.'</p>

<p>Late next morning, when the gaoler awakened him:</p>

<p>'You must have a wonderful heart, Monsieur Julien,' the man said
to him. 'Twice I have come in and did not want to wake you. Here
are two bottles of excellent wine which M. Maslon, our curé, sends
you.'</p>

<p>'What? Is that rascal here still?' said Julien.</p>

<p>'Yes, Sir,' replied the gaoler, lowering his voice, 'but do not
speak so loud, it may damage you.'</p>

<p>Julien laughed heartily.</p>

<p>'At the stage I have reached, my friend, you alone could damage
me, if you ceased to be gentle and human...You shall be well paid,'
Julien broke off, resuming his imperious air. This air was
immediately justified by the gift of a small coin.</p>

<p>M. Noiroud told him once more, going into the fullest detail,
all that he had heard about Madame de Rênal, but he did not mention
Miss Elisa's visit.</p>

<p>This man was as menial and submissive as possible. An idea came
into Julien's head: 'This sort of ungainly giant may earn three or
four hundred francs, for his prison is never crowded; I can
guarantee him ten thousand francs, if he cares to escape to
Switzerland with me...The difficulty will be to persuade him of my
sincerity.' The thought of the long colloquy that he would have to
hold with so vile a creature filled Julien with disgust, he turned
his mind to other things.</p>

<p>That evening, there was no longer time. A post-chaise came to
fetch him at midnight. He was charmed with the gendarmes, his
travelling companions. In the morning, when he arrived at the
prison of Besançon, they were so kind as to lodge him on the upper
floor of a gothic dungeon. He guessed the architecture to date from
the beginning of the fourteenth century; he admired its grace and
pointed airiness. Through a narrow gap between two walls on the
farther side of a deep courtyard, there was a glimpse of a superb
view.</p>

<p>Next day he was examined, after which, for several days, he was
left to himself. His spirit was calm. He could find nothing that
was not quite simple in his case: 'I sought to kill, I must be
killed.'</p>

<p>His thoughts did not linger to consider this argument. The
trial, the annoyance of appearing in public, the defence, he
regarded as so many trifling embarrassments, tiresome ceremonies of
which it would be time to think when the day came. The prospect of
death detained him almost as little: 'I shall think of that after
the sentence.' Life was by no means tedious to him, he looked at
everything in a fresh light. He had no ambition left. He thought
rarely of Mademoiselle de La Mole. His remorse occupied him a great
deal and often called up before him the image of Madame de Rênal,
especially in the silence of the night, disturbed only, in this
lofty dungeon, by the cry of the osprey!</p>

<p>He thanked heaven for not having let him wound her mortally. 'An
astonishing thing!' he said to himself, 'I thought that by her
letter to M. de La Mole she had destroyed my future happiness for
all time, and, in less than a fortnight after the date of that
letter, I no longer think of all that was occupying my mind...Two
or three thousand livres a year to live quietly in a mountain
village like Vergy...I was happy then...I did not recognise my own
happiness!'</p>

<p>At other moments, he would rise with a bound from his chair. 'If
I had wounded Madame de Rênal mortally, I should have killed
myself...I require that certainty to make me feel a horror of
myself. ,,,</p>

<p>'Kill myself! That is the great question,' he said to himself.
Those judges so steeped in formalities, so thirsty for the blood of
the wretched prisoner, who would have the best of citizens hanged
in order to hang a Cross from their own buttonholes...I should
remove myself from their power, from their insults in bad French,
which the local newspaper will proceed to call eloquence.</p>

<p>'I may live for five or six weeks still, more or less...Kill
myself! Faith, no,' he said to himself after a few days, 'Napoleon
lived...</p>

<p>'Besides, life is pleasant to me; this is a quiet spot to stay
in; I have no worries,' he added, laughing, and set to work to make
a list of the books which he wished to have sent to him from
Paris.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch67" id="ch67"></a>Chapter 67. A Dungeon</h2>

<p style="margin-left:10%">The tomb of a friend.<br>
&mdash;STERNE</p>

<p>He heard a great din in the corridor; it was not the hour for
visiting his cell; the osprey flew away screaming, the door opened,
and the venerable curé Chélan, trembling all over and leaning upon
his cane, flung himself into Julien's arms.</p>

<p>'Ah, great God! Is it possible, my child...Monster, I ought to
say.'</p>

<p>And the good old man could not add another word. Julien was
afraid of his falling. He was obliged to lead him to a chair. The
hand of time had fallen heavily upon this man, so vigorous in days
gone by. He appeared to Julien to be only the ghost of his former
self.</p>

<p>When he had recovered his breath: 'Only the day before
yesterday, I received your letter from Strasbourg, with your five
hundred francs for the poor of Verrières; it was brought to me up
in the mountains at Liveru, where I have gone to live with my
nephew Jean. Yesterday, I learned of the catastrophe...Oh, heavens!
Is it possible?' The old man's tears ceased to flow, he seemed
incapable of thought and added mechanically: 'You will need your
five hundred francs, I have brought them back to you.'</p>

<p>'I need to see you, Father!' Julien exclaimed with emotion. 'I
have plenty of money.'</p>

<p>But he could not extract any coherent answer. From time to time,
M. Chélan shed a few tears which rolled in silence down his cheeks;
then he gazed at Julien, and was almost stupefied at seeing him
take his hands and raise them to his lips. That countenance, once
so lively, and so vigorous in its expression of the noblest
sentiments, was no longer to be aroused from a state of apathy. A
sort of peasant came presently to fetch the old man. 'It does not
do to tire him,' he said to Julien, who realised that this was the
nephew. This visit left Julien plunged in bitter grief which
stopped his tears. Everything seemed to him sad and comfortless; he
felt his heart freeze in his bosom.</p>

<p>This was the most cruel moment that he had experienced since the
crime. He had seen death face to face, and in all its ugliness. All
the illusions of greatness of soul and generosity had been
scattered like a cloud before the storm.</p>

<p>This fearful situation lasted for some hours. After moral
poisoning, one requires physical remedies and a bottle of
champagne. Julien would have deemed himself a coward had he had
recourse to them. Towards the end of a horrible day, the whole of
which he had spent in pacing the floor of his narrow dungeon: 'What
a fool I am!' he exclaimed. 'It would be if I expected to die in my
bed that the sight of that poor old man ought to make me so utterly
wretched; but a swift death in the springtide of life is the very
thing to save me from that miserable decrepitude.'</p>

<p>Whatever arguments he might thus advance, Julien found that he
was moved like any pusillanimous creature and made wretched in
consequence by this visit.</p>

<p>There was no longer any trace of rugged grandeur in him, any
Roman virtue; death appeared to him on a higher plane, and as a
thing less easily to be won.</p>

<p>'This shall be my thermometer,' he said to himself. This evening
I am ten degrees below the level of courage that must lead me to
the guillotine. This morning, I had that courage. What does it
matter, after all? Provided that it returns to me at the right
moment.' This idea of a thermometer amused him and succeeded
finally in distracting him.</p>

<p>Next morning, on waking, he was ashamed of his behaviour the day
before. 'My happiness, my tranquillity are at stake.' He almost
made up his mind to write to the Attorney-General to ask that
nobody should be admitted to his cell. 'And Fouque?' he thought.
'If he can manage to come to Besançon, how distressed he will
be.'</p>

<p>It was perhaps two months since he had given Fouque a thought.
'I was an utter fool at Strasbourg, my thoughts never went beyond
my coat collar.' Memories of Fouque kept recurring to his mind and
left him in a more tender mood. He paced the floor with agitation.
'Now I am certainly twenty degrees below the level of death...If
this weakness increases, it will pay me better to kill myself. What
a joy for the abbe Maslons and the Valenods if I die here like a
rat!'</p>

<p>Fouque arrived; the simple, honest fellow was shattered by
grief. His sole idea, if he had one at all, was to sell all that he
possessed in order to corrupt the gaoler and so save Julien's life.
He spoke to him for hours of the escape of M. de Lavalette.</p>

<p>'You distress me,' Julien said to him; 'M. de Lavalette was
innocent, I am guilty. Without meaning to do so, you make me
realise the difference...</p>

<p>'But is it true? What! You would sell all that you have?' said
Julien, suddenly becoming observant and suspicious once more.</p>

<p>Fouque, delighted to see his friend at last responsive to his
dominant idea, explained to him in full detail, and to within a
hundred francs or so, what he expected to receive for each of his
properties.</p>

<p>'What a sublime effort in a small landowner!' thought Julien.
'How many savings, how many little cheese-parings, which made me
blush so when I saw him make them, he is willing to sacrifice for
me! None of those fine young fellows whom I used to see at the
Hotel de La Mole, who read <i>Rene</i>, would have any of his
absurdities; but apart from those of them who are very young and
have inherited fortunes, as well, and know nothing of the value of
money, which of those fine Parisians would be capable of such a
sacrifice?'</p>

<p>All Fouque's mistakes in grammer, all his vulgar mannerisms
vanished, he flung himself into his arms. Never have the provinces,
when contrasted with Paris, received a nobler homage. Fouque,
delighted by the enthusiasm which he read in his friend's eyes,
mistook it for consent to an escape.</p>

<p>This glimpse of the <i>sublime</i> restored to Julien all the
strength of which M. Chélan's visit had robbed him. He was still
very young; but, to my mind, he was a fine plant. Instead of his
advancing from tenderness to cunning, like the majority of men, age
would have given him an easy access to emotion, he would have been
curéd of an insane distrust...But what good is there in these vain
predictions?</p>

<p>The examinations became more frequent, in spite of the efforts
of Julien, whose answers were all aimed at cutting the whole
business short. 'I have taken life, or at least I have sought to
take life, and with premeditation,' he repeated day after day. But
the magistrate was a formalist first and foremost. Julien's
statements in no way cut short the examinations; the magistrate's
feelings were hurt. Julien did not know that they had proposed to
remove him to a horrible cellar, and that it was thanks to Fouque's
intervention that he was allowed to remain in his charming room one
hundred and eighty steps from the ground.</p>

<p>M. l'abbe de Frilair was one of the important persons who
contracted with Fouque for the supply of their firewood. The honest
merchant had access even to the all-powerful Vicar-General. To his
inexpressible delight, M. de Frilair informed him that, touched by
the good qualities of Julien and by the services which he had
rendered in the past to the Seminary, he intended to intervene on
his behalf with the judges. Fouque saw a hope of saving his friend,
and on leaving his presence, bowing to the ground, begged the
Vicar-General to expend upon masses, to pray for the acquittal of
the prisoner, a sum of ten louis.</p>

<p>Fouque was strangely in error. M. de Frilair was by no means a
Valenod. He refused, and even tried to make the worthy peasant
understand that he would do better to keep his money in his pocket.
Seeing that it was impossible to make his meaning clear without
indiscretion, he advised him to distribute the sum in alms, for the
poor prisoners, who, as a matter of fact, were in need of
everything.</p>

<p>'This Julien is a strange creature, his action is inexplicable,'
thought M. de Frilair, 'and nothing ought to be inexplicable to
me...Perhaps it will be possible to make a martyr of him...In any
case, I shall get to the true <i>inwardness</i> of this business
and may perhaps find an opportunity of inspiring fear in that
Madame de Rênal, who has no respect for us, and detests me in her
heart...Perhaps I may even discover in all this some sensational
means of reconciliation with M. de La Mole, who has a weakness for
this little Seminarist.'</p>

<p>The settlement of the lawsuit had been signed some weeks
earlier, and the abbe Pirard had left Besançon, not without having
spoken of the mystery of Julien's birth, on the very day on which
the wretched fellow tried to kill Madame de Rênal in the church of
Verrières.</p>

<p>Julien saw only one disagreeable incident in store for him
before his death, namely a visit from his father. He consulted
Fouque as to his idea of writing to the Attorney-General, asking to
be excused any further visitors. This horror at the sight of a
father, at such a moment, shocked the honest and respectable heart
of the timber-merchant profoundly.</p>

<p>He thought he understood why so many people felt a passionate
hatred of his friend. Out of respect for another's grief, he
concealed his feelings.</p>

<p>'In any case,' he replied coldly, 'an order for solitary
confinement would not apply to your father.'</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch68" id="ch68"></a>Chapter 68. A Man of Power</h2>

<p style="margin-left:10%">But there is such mystery in her
movements,<br>
such elegance in her form. Who can she be?<br>
&mdash;SCHILLER</p>

<p>The doors of the dungeon were thrown open at a very early hour
the next morning. Julien awoke with a start.</p>

<p>'Oh, good God,' he thought, 'here comes my father. What a
disagreeable scene!'</p>

<p>At that moment, a woman dressed as a peasant flung herself into
his arms; he had difficulty in recognising her. It was Mademoiselle
de La Mole.</p>

<p>'Miscreant, it was only from your letter that I learned where
you were. What you call your crime, though it is nothing but a
noble revenge which shows me all the loftiness of the heart that
beats in your bosom, I learned only at Verrières...'</p>

<p>Notwithstanding his prejudices against Mademoiselle de La Mole,
prejudices of which, moreover, he had not himself formed any
definite idea, Julien found her extremely good-looking. How could
he fail to see in all this manner of speech and action a noble,
disinterested sentiment, far above anything that a petty, vulgar
spirit would have dared? He imagined once again that he was in love
with a queen, and after a few moments it was with a rare nobility
of speech and thought that he said to her:</p>

<p>'The future was tracing itself quite clearly before my eyes.
After my death, I married you to Croisenois, who would be marrying
a widow. The noble but slightly romantic spirit of this charming
widow, startled and converted to the service of common prudence by
an event at once singular, tragic and for her momentous, would have
deigned to appreciate the quite genuine merit of the young Marquis.
You would have resigned yourself to enjoying the happiness of the
rest of the world: esteem, riches, high rank...But, dear Mathilde,
your coming to Besançon, if it is suspected, is going to be a
mortal blow to M. de La Mole, and that is what I will never forgive
myself. I have already caused him so much sorrow! The Academician
will say that he has been warming a serpent in his bosom.'</p>

<p>'I must confess that I hardly expected so much cold reasoning,
so much thought for the future,' said Mademoiselle de La Mole, half
annoyed. 'My maid, who is almost as prudent as yourself, procuréd a
passport for herself, and it is in the name of Madame Michelet that
I have travelled post.'</p>

<p>'And Madame Michelet found it so easy to make her way in to
me?'</p>

<p>'Ah! You are still the superior man, the man of my choice! First
of all, I offered a hundred francs to a magistrate's secretary, who
assured me that it was impossible for me to enter this dungeon. But
after taking the money, this honest man made me wait, raised
objections, I thought that he meant to rob me...' She broke
off.</p>

<p>'Well?' asked Julien.</p>

<p>'Do not be angry with me, my little Julien,' she said, embracing
him, 'I was obliged to give my name to this secretary, who took me
for a young milliner from Paris, enamoured of the handsome
Julien...Indeed, those are his very words. I swore to him that I
was your wife, and I am to have permission to see you every
day.'</p>

<p>'That finishes everything,' thought Julien; 'I could not prevent
it. After all, M. de La Mole is so great a nobleman that public
opinion will easily find an excuse for the young Colonel who will
wed this charming widow. My approaching death will cover
everything'; and he abandoned himself with ecstasy to Mathilde's
love; there followed madness, magnanimity, everything that was most
strange. She seriously proposed to him that she should die with
him.</p>

<p>After these first transports, and when she had grown used to the
happiness of seeing Julien, a keen curiosity suddenly took
possession of her soul. She examined her lover, and found him far
superior to what she had imagined. Boniface de La Mole seemed to
her reincarnate in him, but in a more heroic mould.</p>

<p>Mathilde saw the leading counsel of the place, whom she insulted
by offering them gold too crudely; but they ended by accepting.</p>

<p>She speedily came to the conclusion that in doubtful matters of
high import, everything in Besançon depended upon M. l'abbe de
Frilair.</p>

<p>Under the obscuré name of Madame Michelet, she at first found
insuperable obstacles in the way to the presence of the
all-powerful leader of the Congregation. But the rumour of the
beauty of a young milliner, madly in love, who had come from Paris
to Besançon to comfort the young abbe Julien Sorel, began to spread
through the town.</p>

<p>Mathilde went alone and on foot through the streets of Besançon;
she hoped that she might not be recognised. In any event, she
thought that it must help her cause to create a strong impression
upon the populace. In her folly she thought of making them revolt,
to save Julien on his way to the scaffold. Mademoiselle de La Mole
imagined herself to be dressed simply and in a manner becoming a
woman stricken with grief; she was dressed in such a fashion as to
attract every eye.</p>

<p>She was the sole object of attention in Besançon, when, after a
week of solicitation, she obtained an audience of M. Frilair.</p>

<p>Great as her courage might be, the idea of an influential head
of the Congregation and that of a profound and cautious rascality
were so closely associated in her mind that she trembled as she
rang the bell at the door of the Bishop's palace. She could barely
stand when she had to climb the stair that led to the First
Vicar-General's apartment. The loneliness of the episcopal palace
chilled her with fear. 'I may sit down in an armchair, and the
armchair grip me by the arms, I shall have vanished. Of whom can my
maid ask for news of me? The Captain of Police will decline to
interfere...I am all alone in this great town!'</p>

<p>Her first sight of the apartment set Mademoiselle de La Mole's
heart at rest. First of all, it was a footman in the most elegant
livery that had opened the door to her. The parlour in which she
was asked to wait displayed that refined and delicate luxury, so
different from vulgar magnificence, which one finds in Paris only
in the best houses. As soon as she caught sight of M. de Frilair,
who came towards her with a fatherly air, all thoughts of a
dastardly crime vanished. She did not even find on his handsome
countenance the imprint of that energetic, that almost wild virtue,
so antipathetic to Parisian society. The half-smile that animated
the features of the priest who was in supreme control of everything
at Besançon, betokened the man used to good society, the cultured
prelate, the able administrator. Mathilde imagined herself in
Paris.</p>

<p>It needed only a few minutes for M. de Frilair to lead Mathilde
on to admit to him that she was the daughter of his powerful
adversary, the Marquis de La Mole.</p>

<p>'I am not, as a matter of fact, Madame Michelet,' she said,
resuming all the loftiness of her bearing, 'and this admission
costs me little, for I have come to consult you, Sir, as to the
possibility of procuring the escape of M. de La Vernaye. In the
first place he is guilty of nothing worse than a piece of
stupidity; the woman at whom he fired is doing well. In the second
place, to corrupt the subordinates, I can put down here and now
fifty thousand francs, and bind myself to pay double that sum.
Lastly, my gratitude and the gratitude of my family will consider
no request impossible from the person who has saved M. de La
Vernaye.'</p>

<p>M. de Frilair appeared to be surprised at this name. Mathilde
showed him a number of letters from the Ministry of War, addressed
to M. Julien Sorel de La Vernaye.</p>

<p>'You see, Sir, that my father undertook to provide for his
future. I married him secretly, my father wished him to be a senior
officer before making public this marriage, which is a little odd
for a La Mole.'</p>

<p>Mathilde remarked that the expression of benevolence and of a
mild gaiety speedily vanished as M. de Frilair began to arrive at
important discoveries. A subtlety blended with profound insincerity
was portrayed on his features.</p>

<p>The abbe had his doubts, he perused the official documents once
more slowly.</p>

<p>'What advantage can I gain from these strange confidences?' he
asked himself. 'Here I am suddenly brought into close personal
contact with a friend of the famous Marechale de Fervaques, the
all-powerful niece of the Lord Bishop of &mdash;&mdash;, through
whom one becomes a Bishop in France.</p>

<p>'What I have always regarded as hidden in the future suddenly
presents itself. This may lead me to the goal of all my
ambition.'</p>

<p>At first Mathilde was alarmed by the rapid change in the
physiognomy of this powerful man, with whom she found herself shut
up alone in a remote part of the building. 'But why!' she said to
herself presently, 'would it not have been worse to have made no
impression upon the cold egoism of a priest sated with the
enjoyment of power?'</p>

<p>Dazzled by this rapid and unexpected avenue to the episcopate
that was opening before his eyes, astonished at Mathilde's
intelligence, for a moment M. de Frilair was off his guard.
Mademoiselle de La Mole saw him almost at her feet, trembling
nervously with the intensity of his ambition.</p>

<p>'Everything becomes clear,' she thought, 'nothing will be
impossible here for a friend of Madame de Fervaques.' Despite a
sense of jealousy that was still most painful, she found courage to
explain that Julien was an intimate friend of the Marechale, and
almost every evening used to meet, in her house, the Lord Bishop of
&mdash;&mdash;.</p>

<p>'If you were to draw by lot four or five times in succession a
list of thirty-six jurymen from among the principal inhabitants of
this Department,' said the Vicar-General with the harsh glare of
ambition, dwelling upon each of his words, 'I should consider
myself most unfortunate if in each list I did not find eight or
nine friends, and those the most intelligent of the lot. Almost
invariably I should have a majority, more than that, even for a
verdict of guilty; you see, Mademoiselle, with what ease I can
securé an acquittal..."</p>

<p>The abbe broke off suddenly, as though startled by the sound of
his words; he was admitting things which are never uttered to the
profane.</p>

<p>But Mathilde in turn was stupefied when he informed her that
what was most astonishing and interesting to Besançon society in
Julien's strange adventure, was that in the past he had inspired a
grand passion in Madame de Rênal, which he had long reciprocated.
M. de Frilair had no difficulty in perceiving the extreme distress
which his story produced.</p>

<p>'I have my revenge!' he thought. 'Here, at last, is a way of
controlling this decided young person; I was trembling lest I
should not succeed in finding one.' Her distinguished air, as of
one not easily led, intensified in his eyes the charm of the rare
beauty which he saw almost suppliant before him. He recovered all
his self-possession and had no hesitation in turning the knife in
the wound.</p>

<p>'I should not be surprised after all,' he said to her lightly,
'were we to learn that it was from jealousy that M. Sorel fired two
shots at this woman whom once he loved so dearly. She must have had
some relaxation, and for some time past she had been seeing a great
deal of a certain abbe Marquinot of Dijon, a sort of Jansenist,
utterly without morals, like all of them.'</p>

<p>M. de Frilair went on torturing with voluptuous relish and at
his leisure the heart of this beautiful girl, whose weak spot he
had discovered.</p>

<p>'Why,' he said, fixing a pair of burning eyes on Mathilde,
'should M. Sorel have chosen the church, if not because at that
very moment his rival was celebrating mass there? Everyone agrees
in ascribing boundless intelligence and even more prudence to the
man who is so fortunate as to enjoy your protection. What more
simple than to conceal himself in M. de Rênal's gardens, which he
knows so well? There, with almost a certainty of not being seen,
nor caught, nor suspected, he could have inflicted death on the
woman of whom he was jealous.'</p>

<p>These arguments, apparently so well founded, reduced Mathilde to
utter despair. Her spirit, haughty enough but saturated with all
that dry prudence which passes in society as a faithful portrayal
of the human heart, was not made to understand in a moment the joy
of defying all prudence which can be so keen a joy to an ardent
soul. In the upper classes of Parisian society, in which Mathilde
had lived, passion can only very rarely divest itself of prudence,
and it is from the attics on the fifth floor that girls throw
themselves out of windows.</p>

<p>At last the abbe de Frilair was sure of his control. He gave
Mathilde to understand (he was probably lying) that he could
influence as he chose the Crown Counsel, who would have to support
the charge against Julien.</p>

<p>After the names of the thirty-six jurors for the assize had been
drawn by lot, he would make a direct and personal appeal to at
least thirty of them.</p>

<p>If M. de Frilair had not thought Mathilde so good-looking, he
would not have spoken to her in such plain terms until their fifth
or sixth interview.</p>

five hundred ecus to get him off; by their secret distribution,<br>

<p>[Trans. footnote: I am indebted to the patience and ingenuity of
Mr. Vyvyan Holland, who has traced the original text of this motto
in <i>The Life of John Locke, with extracts from his
Correspondence, Journals and Commonplace Books by Lord King</i>

<p>On leaving the Bishop's palace, Mathilde did not hesitate to
send a messenger to Madame de Fervaques; the fear of compromising
herself did not restrain her for a second. She implored her rival
to obtain a letter for M. de Frilair, written throughout in the
hand of the Lord Bishop of &mdash;&mdash;. She even went the length
of beseeching the other to hasten, herself, to Besançon. This was a
heroic measure on the part of a proud and jealous spirit.</p>

<p>On the advice of Fouque, she had taken the precaution of saying
nothing about what she was doing to Julien. Her presence was
disturbing enough in itself. A more honourable man at the approach
of death than he had been during his life, he now felt compunction
at the thought not only of M. de La Mole, but also of Mathilde.</p>

<p>'What is this?' he asked himself, 'I experience in her company
moments of abstraction and even of boredom. She is ruining herself
for me, and it is thus that I reward her. Can I indeed be wicked?'
This question would have troubled him little when he was ambitious;
then, not to succeed in life was the only disgrace in his eyes.</p>

<p>His moral uneasiness, in Mathilde's presence, was all the more
marked, in that he inspired in her at that moment the most
extraordinary and insensate passion. She could speak of nothing but
the strange sacrifices which she was anxious to make to save
him.</p>

<p>Carried away by a sentiment of which she was proud and which
completely overbore her pride, she would have liked not to allow a
moment of her life to pass that was not filled with some
extraordinary action. The strangest plans, the most perilous to
herself, formed the theme of her long conversations with Julien.
His gaolers, well rewarded, allowed her to have her way in the
prison. Mathilde's ideas were not confined to the sacrifice of her
reputation; it mattered nothing to her though she made her
condition known to the whole of society. To fling herself on her
knees to crave pardon for Julien, in front of the King's carriage
as it came by at a gallop, to attract the royal attention, at the
risk of a thousand deaths, was one of the tamest fancies of this
exalted and courageous imagination. Through her friends who held
posts at court, she could count upon being admitted to the reserved
parts of the park of Saint-Cloud.</p>

<p>Julien felt himself to be hardly worthy of such devotion, to
tell the truth he was tired of heroism. It would have required a
simple, artless, almost timid affection to appeal to him, whereas
on the contrary, Mathilde's proud spirit must always entertain the
idea of a public, of what <i>people would say</i>.</p>

<p>In the midst of all her anguish, of all her fears for the life
of this lover, whom she was determined not to outlive, she had a
secret longing to astonish the public by the intensity of her love
and the sublimity of her actions.</p>

<p>He resented the discovery that he was unable to feel at all
touched by all this heroism. What would his resentment have been,
had he known of all the follies with which Mathilde overpowered the
devoted, but eminently reasonable and limited mind of the good
Fouque?</p>

<p>The latter could scarcely find fault with Mathilde's devotion;
for he, too, would have sacrificed his whole fortune and exposed
his life to the greatest risks to save Julien. He was stupefied by
the quantity of gold which Mathilde scattered abroad. At first, the
sums thus spent impressed Fouque, who had for money all the
veneration of a provincial.</p>

<p>Later, he discovered that Mademoiselle de La Mole's plans often
varied, and, to his great relief, found a word with which to
reproach this character which was so exhausting to him: she was
<i>changeable</i>. To this epithet, that of <i>wrongheaded</i>, the
direst anathema in the provinces, is the immediate sequel.</p>

<p>'It is strange,' Julien said to himself one day as Mathilde was
leaving his prison, 'that so warm a passion, and one of which I am
the object, leaves me so unmoved! And I worshipped her two months
ago! I have indeed read that at the approach of death we lose
interest in everything; but it is frightful to feel oneself
ungrateful and to be unable to change. Can I be an egoist?' He
heaped on himself, in this connection, the most humiliating
reproaches.</p>

<p>Ambition was dead in his heart, another passion had risen from
its ashes; he called it remorse for having murdered Madame de
Rênal.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact, he was hopelessly in love with her. He
found a strange happiness when, left absolutely alone and without
any fear of being disturbed, he could abandon himself entirely to
the memory of the happy days which he had spent in the past at
Verrières or at Vergy. The most trifling incidents of that time,
too swiftly flown, had for him a freshness and a charm that were
irresistible. He never gave a thought to his Parisian successes;
they bored him.</p>

<p>This tendency, which grew rapidly stronger, was not entirely
hidden from the jealous Mathilde. She saw quite plainly that she
had to contend with the love of solitude. Now and again, she
uttered with terror in her heart the name of Madame de Rênal. She
saw Julien shudder. From that moment, her passion knew no bounds
nor measure.</p>

<p>'If he dies, I die after him,' she said to herself with absolute
sincerity. 'What would the drawing-rooms of Paris say, to see a
girl of my rank carry to such a point her adoration of a lover
condemned to death? To find such sentiments, we must go back to the
days of the heroes; it was love of this nature that set hearts
throbbing in the age of Charles IX and Henri III.'</p>

<p>Amid the most impassioned transports, when she pressed Julien's
head to her heart: 'What!' she said to herself with horror, 'can
this precious head be doomed to fall? Very well!' she added,
inflamed by a heroism that was not devoid of happiness, 'my lips,
which are now pressed against these dear locks, will be frozen
within twenty-four hours after.'</p>

<p>Memories of these moments of heroism and fearful ecstasy seized
her in an ineluctable grip. The thought of suicide, so absorbing in
itself, and hitherto so remote from that proud spirit, penetrated
its defences and soon reigned there with an absolute sway. 'No, the
blood of my ancestors has not grown lukewarm in its descent to me,'
Mathilde told herself proudly.</p>

<p>'I have a favour to ask you,' her lover said to her one day: Put
your child out to nurse at Verrières, Madame de Rênal will look
after the nurse.'</p>

<p>'That is a very harsh saying...' Mathilde turned pale.</p>

<p>'True, and I ask a thousand pardons,' cried Julien, awakening
from his dream and pressing her to his bosom.</p>

<p>Having dried her tears, he returned to the subject of his
thoughts, but with more subtlety. He had given the conversation a
turn of melancholy philosophy. He spoke of that future which was
soon to close for him. 'You must agree, my dear friend, that the
passions are an accident in life, but this accident is to be found
only in superior beings...The death of my son would be in reality a
relief to the pride of your family, so much the subordinate agents
will perceive. Neglect will be the lot of that child of misery and
shame...I hope that at a date which I do not wish to specify, which
however I have the courage to anticipate, you will obey my final
behest: You will marry the Marquis de Croisenois.'</p>

<p>'What, dishonoured!'</p>

<p>'Dishonour can have no hold over such a name as yours. You will
be a widow, and the widow of a madman, that is all. I shall go
farther: my crime, being free from any pecuniary motive, will be in
no way dishonouring. Perhaps by that time some philosophical
legislator will have securéd, from the prejudices of his
contemporaries, the suppression of capital punishment. Then, some
friendly voice will cite as an instance: "Why, Mademoiselle de La
Mole's first husband was mad, but not a wicked man, he was no
criminal. It was absurd to cut his head off..." Then my memory will
cease to be infamous; at least, after a certain time...Your
position in society, your fortune, and, let me say, your genius
will enable M. de Croisenois to play a part, once he is your
husband, to which by himself he could not hope to attain.</p>

<p>He has only his birth and his gallantry, and those qualities by
themselves, which made a man accomplished in 1729, are an
anachronism a hundred years later, and only give rise to
pretensions. A man must have other things besides if he is to place
himself at the head of the youth of France.</p>

<p>'You will bring the support of a firm and adventurous character
to the political party in which you will place your husband. You
may succeed the Chevreuses and Longuevilles of the Fronde...But by
then, my dear friend, the heavenly fire which animates you at this
moment will have cooled a little.</p>

<p>'Allow me to tell you,' he went on, after many other preliminary
phrases, 'in fifteen years from now you will regard as an act of
folly, pardonable but still an act of folly, the love that you have
felt for me...'</p>

<p>He broke off abruptly and returned to his dreams. He found
himself once again confronted by that idea, so shocking to
Mathilde: 'In fifteen years Madame de Rênal will adore my son, and
you will have forgotten him.'</p>

<h2><a name="ch70" id="ch70"></a>Chapter 70. Tranquillity</h2>

<p style="margin-left:10%">It is because I was foolish then that I
am now wise.<br>
O philosopher who see nothing save in a flash, how<br>
short is your vision! Your eye is not made to follow<br>
the underground working of the passions.<br>
&mdash;FRAU VON GOETHE</p>

<p>This conversation was interrupted by a judicial examination,
followed by a conference with the lawyer retained for the defence.
These were the only absolutely disagreeable moments in a heedless
existence full of tender fantasies.</p>

<p>'It was murder, and premeditated murder,' said Julien to
magistrate and counsel alike. 'I am sorry, gentlemen,' he added,
smiling; 'but this reduces your task to a very small matter.</p>

<p>'After all,' thought Julien, when he had succeeded in ridding
himself of these two persons, 'I must be brave, and braver,
evidently, than these two men. They regard as the worst of evils,
as the <i>king of terrors</i>, this duel to a fatal issue, of which
I shall begin to think seriously only upon the day itself.</p>

<p>'That is because I have known a greater evil,' Julien continued,
philosophising to himself. 'I suffered far more keenly on my first
journey to Strasbourg, when I thought that I had been abandoned by
Mathilde...And to think that I longed with such passion for this
perfect intimacy which today leaves me so unmoved! Indeed, I am
happier by myself than when that lovely girl shares my
solitude...'</p>

<p>The lawyer, a man of rules and formalities, thought him mad, and
supposed, with the rest of the public, that it was jealousy that
had put the pistol in his hand. One day, he ventured to suggest to
Julien that this allegation, whether true or false, would be an
excellent line of defence. But the prisoner became in a flash
passionate and incisive.</p>

<p>'On your life, Sir,' cried Julien beside himself with rage,
'bear in mind never again to utter that abominable falsehood.' The
prudent advocate was afraid for a moment of being murdered
himself.</p>

<p>He prepared his defence, because the decisive moment was rapidly
approaching. Besançon and the whole Department could talk of
nothing but this cause celebre. Julien was in ignorance of this, he
had begged that no one should ever speak to him of such
matters.</p>

<p>That very day, Fouque and Mathilde having sought to inform him
of certain public rumours, which seemed to them to furnish grounds
for hope, Julien had cut them short at the first word.</p>

<p>'Leave me to enjoy my ideal life. Your petty bickerings, your
details of real life, all more or less irritating to me, would
bring me down from heaven. One dies as best one can; as for me, I
wish to think of death only in my own way. What do I care for other
people? My relations with other people are soon to be cut short.
For pity's sake, do not speak to me of them again: it is quite
enough to have to see the magistrate and my counsel.</p>

<p>'Indeed,' he said to himself, 'it appears to be my destiny to
die in a dream. An obscuré creature, like myself, sure of being
forgotten within a fortnight, would indeed be foolish, one must
admit, were he to play a part...</p>

<p>'It is strange, all the same, that I have learned the art of
enjoying life only now that I see its term draw so near.'</p>

<p>He spent these last days in pacing the narrow terrace on the
roof of his dungeon, smoking some excellent cigars for which
Mathilde had sent a courier to Holland, and with no suspicion that
his appearance was daily awaited by all the telescopes in the town.
His thoughts were at Vergy. Never did he speak of Madame de Rênal
to Fouque, but on two or three occasions this friend told him that
she was recovering rapidly, and these words echoed in his
heart.</p>

<p>While Julien's spirit was almost always completely lost in the
world of ideas, Mathilde, occupied with realities, as becomes an
aristocratic heart, had contrived to increase the intimacy of the
direct correspondence between Madame de Fervaques and M. de Frilair
to such a point that already the mighty word Bishopric had been
uttered.</p>

<p>The venerable prelate, in whose hands was the list of benefices,
added as a postscript to one of his niece's letters: 'That poor
Sorel is nothing worse than a fool, I hope that he will be restored
to us.'</p>

<p>At the sight of these lines, M. de Frilair was almost out of his
mind. He had no doubt of his ability to save Julien.</p>

<p>'But for that Jacobinical law which prescribes the registration
of an endless list of jurors, and has no other real object than to
take away all influence from well-born people,' he said to
Mathilde, on the eve of the drawing by lot of the thirty-six jurors
for the assize, 'I could have answered for the verdict. Did I not
securé the acquittal of the curé N&mdash;&mdash; ?'</p>

<p>It was with pleasure that, on the following day, among the names
drawn from the urn, M. de Frilair found those of five members of
the Congregation of Besançon, and, among those who were strangers
to the town, the names of MM. Valenod, de Moirod and de Cholin. 'I
can answer at once for these eight jurors,' he told Mathilde. 'The
first five are <i>machines</i>. Valenod is my agent, Moirod owes
all he has to me, Cholin is an imbecile, who is afraid of
everything.'</p>

<p>The newspaper published throughout the Department the names of
the jurors, and Madame de Rênal, to the inexpressible terror of her
husband, decided to come to Besançon. All that M. de Rênal could
obtain from her was that she would not leave her bed, so that she
might not be exposed to the nuisance of being summoned to give
evidence. 'You do not understand my position,' said the former
Mayor of Verrières. 'I am now a Liberal of the defection, as they
call it; no doubt but that rascal Valenod and M. de Frilair will
easily persuade the Attorney General and the Judges to anything
that can be unpleasant for me.'</p>

<p>Madame de Rênal yielded without protest to her husband's orders,
'ïf I were to appear at the Assize Court,' she told herself, 'I
should seem to be demanding vengeance.'</p>

<p>Notwithstanding all the promises of prudence made to her
spiritual director and to her husband, no sooner had she arrived in
Besançon than she wrote with her own hand to each of the thirty-six
jurors:</p>

<p>'I shall not appear in Court upon the day of the trial, Sir,
because my presence might prejudice M. Sorel's case. I desire but
one thing in the world, and that passionately, namely his
acquittal. Be assured of this, the terrible thought that on my
account an innocent man has been sent to his death would poison the
remainder of my life, and would doubtless shorten it. How could you
sentence him to death, while I still live? No, beyond question,
society has not the right to take life, especially from such a man
as Julien Sorel. Everyone at Verrières has seen him in moments of
distraction. This poor young man has powerful enemies; but, even
among his enemies (and how many they are!) who is there that has
any doubt of his admirable talents and his profound learning? It is
not an ordinary person that you are about to judge, Sir. For nearly
eighteen months we have all known him to be pious, wise, studious;
but, two or three times in the year, he was seized by fits of
melancholy which bordered on insanity. The whole town of Verrières,
all our neighbours at Vergy where we go in the fine weather, all my
family, the Sub-Prefect himself, will bear testimony to his
exemplary piety; he knows by heart the whole of the Holy Bible.
Would an unbeliever have applied himself for years on end to
learning the Holy Scriptures? My sons will have the honour to
present this letter to you: they are children. Deign to question
them, Sir, they will furnish you with all the details relative to
this poor young man that may still be necessary to convince you of
the barbarity of condemning him. Far from avenging me, you would be
sentencing me to death.</p>

<p>'What is there that his enemies can advance in rebuttal of the
following fact? The injury that ensued from one of those moments of
insanity which my children themselves used to remark in their tutor
was so far from dangerous that within less than two months, it has
allowed me to post from Verrières to Besançon. If I learn, Sir,
that you have even the slightest hesitation in saving from the
barbarity of our laws a person who is so little guilty, I shall
leave my bed, to which I am confined solely by my husband's orders,
and shall come to throw myself at your feet.</p>

<p>'Declare, Sir, that the premeditation is not proven, and you
will not have to reproach yourself with the blood of an innocent
man,' etc., etc.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch71" id="ch71"></a>Chapter 71. The Trial</h2>

<p style="margin-left:10%">The country will remember this
celebrated trial for a<br>
long time to come. Interest in the accused reached fever<br>
pitch; this was because his crime was astonishing and yet<br>
not atrocious. Even if it had been, the young man was so<br>
handsome! His great destiny abruptly cut short heightened<br>
the pity felt for him. Will he be condemned? the women<br>
would ask the men of their acquaintance and one could see<br>
them grow pale as they awaited the reply.<br>
&mdash;SAINTE-BEUVE</p>

<p>At length the day dawned so dreaded by Madame de Rênal and
Mathilde.</p>

<p>The strange appearance of the town increased their terror, and
did not leave even Fouque's stout heart unmoved. The whole Province
had swarmed into Besançon to witness the trial of this romantic
case.</p>

<p>For some days past there had not been a bed to be had in the
inns. The President of the Assize Court was assailed with requests
for cards of admission; all the ladies of the town wished to be
present at the trial; Julien's portrait was hawked through the
streets, etc., etc.</p>

<p>Mathilde was keeping in reserve for this supreme moment a letter
written throughout in the hand of the Lord Bishop of
&mdash;&mdash;. This Prelate, who controlled the Church in France
and appointed Bishops, deigned to ask for the acquittal of Julien.
On the eve of the trial, Mathilde took this letter to the
all-powerful Vicar-General.</p>

<p>At the close of the interview, as she was leaving the room in a
flood of tears: 'I answer for the verdict of the jury,' M. de
Frilair told her, emerging at length from his diplomatic reserve,
and almost showing signs of emotion himself. 'Among the twelve
persons charged with the duty of finding whether your protege's
crime is proven, and especially whether there was premeditation, I
number six friends devoted to my welfare, and I have given them to
understand that it rested with them to raise me to the episcopate.
Baron de Valenod, whom I have made Mayor of Verrières, has entire
control over two of his subordinates, MM. de Moirod and de Cholin.
To tell the truth, chance has given us, for dealing with this
affair, two jurors who are extremely disaffected; but, although
Ultra-Liberals, they loyally obey my orders on great occasions, and
I have sent word asking them to vote with M. Valenod. I learn that
a sixth juror of the industrial class, an immensely rich and
garrulous Liberal, is secretly hoping for a contract from the
Ministry of War, and no doubt he would not wish to vex me. I have
let him know that M. Valenod has my last word.'</p>

<p>'And who is this M. Valenod?' said Mathilde, anxiously.</p>

<p>'If you knew him, you would have no doubt of our success. He is
a bold speaker, impudent, coarse, a man made to be the leader of
fools. 1814 raised him from penury, and I am going to make him a
Prefect. He is capable of thrashing the other jurors if they refuse
to vote as he wishes.'</p>

<p>Mathilde was somewhat reassured.</p>

<p>There was another discussion in store for her that evening. In
order not to prolong a painful scene, the outcome of which appeared
to him certain, Julien was determined not to open his mouth.</p>

<p>'My counsel will speak, that is quite sufficient,' he said to
Mathilde. 'As it is, I shall be all too long exposed as a spectacle
to my enemies. These provincials are shocked by the rapid
advancement which I owe to you, and, believe me, there is not one
of them that does not wish for my conviction, except that he will
cry like a fool when I am led to the scaffold.'</p>

<p>'They wish to see you humiliated, it is only too true,' replied
Mathilde, 'but I do not believe that they are cruel. My presence in
Besançon and the spectacle of my grief have interested all the
women; your handsome face will do the rest. If you say but one word
before your judges, the whole court will be on your side,' etc.,
etc.</p>

<p>The following morning at nine o'clock, when Julien came down
from his prison to enter the great hall of the Law Courts, it was
with the utmost difficulty that the gendarmes succeeded in clearing
a passage through the immense crowd that packed the courtyard.
Julien had slept well, he was quite calm, and felt no other
sentiment than one of philosophical piety towards this crowd of
envious persons who, without cruelty, were ready to applaud his
sentence of death. He was quite surprised when, having been
detained for more than a quarter of an hour among the crowd, he was
obliged to admit that his presence was inspiring a tender pity in
the assembly. He did not hear a single unpleasant remark. 'These
provincials are less evil-minded than I supposed,' he said to
himself.</p>

<p>On entering the court, he was struck by the elegance of the
architecture. It was pure gothic, with a number of charming little
pillars carved in stone with the most perfect finish. He imagined
himself in England.</p>

<p>But presently his whole attention was absorbed in twelve or
fifteen pretty women who, seated opposite the dock, filled the
three galleries above the bench and the jurybox. On turning round
towards the public seats, he saw that the circular gallery which
overhung the well of the court was filled with women; most of them
were young and seemed to him extremely pretty; their eyes were
bright and full of interest. In the rest of the court, the crowd
was enormous; people were struggling at the doors, and the sentries
were unable to preserve silence.</p>

<p>When all the eyes that were looking for Julien became aware of
his presence, on seeing him take his place on the slightly raised
bench reserved for the prisoner, he was greeted with a murmur of
astonishment and tender interest.</p>

<p>One would have said that morning that he was not yet twenty; he
was dressed quite simply, but with a perfect grace; his hair and
brow were charming; Mathilde had insisted on presiding in person
over his toilet. His pallor was intense. As soon as he had taken
his seat on the bench, he heard people say on all sides: 'Lord, how
young he is! ...' 'But he is a boy.' 'He is far better looking than
his portrait.'</p>

<p>'Prisoner,' said the gendarme seated on his right, 'do you see
those six ladies who are on that balcony?' The gendarme pointed to
a little gallery which jutted out above the amphitheatre in which
the jury was placed. 'That is the Prefect's lady,' the gendarme
continued; 'next to her, Madame la Marquise de M &mdash;&mdash; ;
that one loves you dearly. I heard her speak to the examining
magistrate. Next to her is Madame Derville.'</p>

<p>'Madame Derville,' exclaimed Julien, and a vivid blush suffused
his brow. 'When she leaves the court,' he thought, 'she will write
to Madame de Rênal.' He knew nothing of Madame de Rênal's arrival
at Besançon.</p>

<p>The witnesses were quickly heard. At the first words of the
speech for the prosecution made by the counsel for the prosecution,
two of the ladies seated on the little balcony burst into tears.
'Madame Derville is not so easily moved,' thought Julien. He
noticed, however, that she was extremely flushed.</p>

<p>The counsel for the prosecution was labouring an emotional point
in bad French about the barbarity of the crime that had been
committed; Julien noticed that Madame Derville's neighbours showed
signs of strong disapproval. Several of the jury, evidently friends
of these ladies, spoke to them and seemed to reassure them. 'That
can only be a good sign,' thought Julien.</p>

<p>Until then he had felt himself penetrated by an unmixed contempt
for all the men who were taking part in this trial. The insipid
eloquence of the counsel for the prosecution increased this sense
of disgust. But gradually the sereneness of Julien's heart melted
before the marks of interest of which he was plainly the
object.</p>

<p>He was pleased with the firm expression of his counsel. 'No fine
language,' he murmured to him as he stood up to speak.</p>

<p>'All the emphasis stolen from Bossuet, which has been displayed
against you, has helped your case,' said the counsel. And indeed,
he had not been speaking for five minutes before almost all the
ladies had their handkerchiefs in their hands. The counsel,
encouraged by this, addressed the jury in extremely strong
language. Julien shuddered, he felt that he was on the point of
bursting into tears. 'Great God! What will my enemies say?'</p>

<p>He was about to yield to the emotion that was overpowering him,
when, fortunately for himself, he caught an insolent glance from M.
Valenod.</p>

<p>'That wretch's eyes are ablaze,' he said to himself; 'what a
triumph for that vile nature! Had my crime led to this alone, I
should be bound to abhor it. Heaven knows what he will say of me to
Madame de Rênal!'</p>

<p>This thought obliterated all the rest. Shortly afterwards,
Julien was recalled to himself by sounds of approval from the
public. His counsel had just concluded his speech. Julien
remembered that it was the correct thing to shake hands with him.
The time had passed quickly.</p>

<p>Refreshments were brought to counsel and prisoner. It was only
then that Julien was struck by a curious circumstance: none of the
women had left the court for dinner.</p>

<p>'Faith, I am dying of hunger,' said his counsel, 'and you?'</p>

<p>'I am also,' replied Julien.</p>

<p>'Look, there is the Prefect's lady getting her dinner, too,' his
counsel said to him, pointing to the little balcony. 'Cheer up,
everything is going well.' The trial was resumed.</p>

<p>As the President was summing up, midnight struck. He was obliged
to pause; amid the silence of the universal anxiety, the echoing
notes of the clock filled the court.</p>

<p>'Here begins the last day of my life,' thought Julien. Presently
he felt himself inflamed by the idea of duty. He had kept his
emotion in check until then, and maintained his determination not
to speak; but when the President of the Assizes asked him if he had
anything to say, he rose. He saw in front of him the eyes of Madame
Derville, which, in the lamplight, seemed to shine with a strange
brilliance. 'Can she be crying, by any chance,' he wondered.</p>

<p>'Gentlemen of the Jury,</p>

<p>'My horror of the contempt which I believed that I could endure
at the moment of my death, impels me to speak. Gentlemen, I have
not the honour to belong to your class, you see in me a peasant who
has risen in revolt against the lowliness of his station.</p>

<p>'I ask you for no mercy,' Julien went on, his voice growing
stronger. 'I am under no illusion; death is in store for me; it
will be a just punishment. I have been guilty of attempting the
life of the woman most worthy of all respect, of all devotion.
Madame de Rênal had been like a mother to me. My crime is
atrocious, and it was <i>premeditated</i>. I have, therefore,
deserved death, Gentlemen of the Jury. But, even were I less
guilty, I see before me men who, without pausing to consider what
pity may be due to my youth, will seek to punish in me and to
discourage forever that class of young men who, born in an inferior
station and in a sense burdened with poverty, have the good fortune
to securé a sound education, and the audacity to mingle with what
the pride of rich people calls society.</p>

<p>'That is my crime, Gentlemen, and it will be punished with all
the more severity inasmuch as actually I am not being tried by my
peers. I do not see, anywhere among the jury, a peasant who has
grown rich, but only indignant bourgeois...'</p>

<p>For twenty minutes Julien continued to speak in this strain; he
said everything that was in his heart; the counsel for the
prosecution, who aspired to the favour of the aristocracy, kept
springing from his seat; but in spite of the somewhat abstract turn
which Julien had given the debate, all the women were dissolved in
tears. Madame Derville herself had her handkerchief pressed to her
eyes. Before concluding, Julien returned to the question of
premeditation, to his repentance, to the respect, the filial and
unbounded adoration which, in happier times, he had felt for Madame
de Rênal...Madame Derville uttered a cry and fainted.</p>

<p>One o'clock struck as the jury retired to their waiting-room.
None of the women had left their seats; several of the men had
tears in their eyes. The general conversation was at first most
lively; but gradually, as the jury delayed their verdict, the
feeling of weariness spread a calm over the assembly. It was a
solemn moment; the lamps burned more dimly. Julien, who was dead
tired, heard them discussing round him whether this delay augured
well or ill. He noticed with pleasure that everyone was on his
side; the jury did not return, and still not a woman left the
court.</p>

<p>Just as two o'clock had struck, a general stir was audible. The
little door of the jury-room opened. M. le Baron de Valenod
advanced with a grave, theatrical step, followed by the rest of the
jury. He coughed, then declared that on his soul and conscience the
unanimous opinion of the jury was that Julien Sorel was guilty of
murder, and of murder with premeditation: this verdict inferred a
sentence of death; it was pronounced a moment later. Julien looked
at his watch, and remembered M. de Lavalette; it was a quarter past
two. Today is Friday,' he thought.</p>

<p>'Yes, but this is a lucky day for Valenod, who is sentencing
me...I am too closely guarded for Mathilde to be able to effect my
escape, like Madame de Lavalette...And so, in three days, at this
same hour, I shall know what to think of the <i>great
hereafter</i>.'</p>

<p>At that moment, he heard a cry and was recalled to the things of
this world. The women round him were sobbing; he saw that every
face was turned towards a little gallery concealed by the capital
of a gothic pilaster. He learned afterwards that Mathilde had been
hidden there. As the cry was not repeated, everyone turned back to
look at Julien, for whom the gendarmes were trying to clear a
passage through the crowd.</p>

<p>'Let us try not to give that rascal Valenod any food for
laughter,' thought Julien. 'With what a contrite and coaxing air he
uttered the verdict that involved the death penalty! Whereas that
poor president, even though he has been a judge for all these
years, had tears in his eyes when he sentenced me. What a joy for
Valenod to have his revenge for our old rivalry for Madame de
Rênal! And so I shall never see her any more! It is all
finished...A last farewell is impossible between us, I feel
it...How happy I should have been to express to her all the horror
I feel for my crime!</p>

<p>'These words only: I feel that I am justly condemned.'</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch72" id="ch72"></a>Chapter 72. In the Prison</h2>

<p>When Julien was lee back to prison he had been put in a cell
reserved for those under sentence of death. He, who, as a rule,
observed the most trifling details, had never noticed that he was
not being taken up to his old dungeon. He was thinking of what he
would say to Madame de Rênal, if, before the fatal moment, he
should have the good fortune to see her. He felt that she would not
allow him to speak, and was seeking a way of expressing his
repentance in the first words he would utter. 'After such an
action, how am I to convince her that I love her and her only? For
after all I sought to kill her either out of ambition or for love
of Mathilde.'</p>

<p>On getting into bed he found himself between sheets of a coarse
cloth. The scales fell from his eyes. 'Ah! I am in the condemned
cell,' he said to himself, 'awaiting my sentence. It is
right...</p>

<p>'Conte Altamira told me once that, on the eve of his death,
Danton said in his loud voice: "It is strange, the verb to
guillotine cannot be conjugated in all its tenses; one can say: I
shall be guillotined, thou shalt be guillotined, but one does not
say: I have been guillotined."</p>

<p>'Why not,' Julien went on, 'if there is another life? Faith, if
I meet the Christian Deity, I am lost: He is a tyrant, and, as
such, is full of ideas of vengeance; His Bible speaks of nothing
but fearful punishments. I never loved Him! I could never even
believe that anyone did love Him sincerely. He is devoid of pity.'
(Here Julien recalled several passages from the Bible.) 'He will
punish me in some abominable manner...</p>

<p>'But if I meet the God of Fenelon! He will say to me perhaps:
"Much shall be pardoned thee, because thou hast loved much..."</p>

<p>'Have I loved much? Ah! I did love Madame de Rênal, but my
conduct has been atrocious. There, as elsewhere, I abandoned a
simple and modest merit for what was brilliant...</p>

<p>'But then, what a prospect! Colonel of Hussars, should we go to
war; Secretary of Legation in time of peace; after that,
Ambassador...for I should soon have learned the business...and had
I been a mere fool, need the son-in-law of the Marquis de La Mole
fear any rival? All my foolish actions would have been forgiven me,
or rather counted to me as merits. A man of distinction, enjoying
the most splendid existence in Vienna or London...</p>

<p>'Not precisely that, Sir, to be guillotined in three days'
time.'</p>

<p>Julien laughed heartily at this sally of his own wit. 'Indeed,
man has two different beings inside him,' he reflected. 'What devil
thought of that malicious touch?</p>

<p>'Very well, yes, my friend, guillotined in three days' time,' he
replied to the interrupter. 'M. de Cholin will hire a window,
sharing the expense with the abbe Maslon. Well, for the cost of
hiring that window, which of those two worthies will rob the
other?'</p>

<p>A passage from Rotrou's <i>Venceslas</i> entered his head
suddenly.</p>

<p><i>Ladislas</i>: My soul is well prepared. <i>The King (his
father)</i>: So is the scaffold; lay your head thereon.</p>

<p>'A good answer,' he thought, and fell asleep. Someone awakened
him in the morning by shaking him violently.</p>

<p>'What, already!' said Julien, opening a haggard eye. He imagined
himself to be in the headsman's hands.</p>

<p>It was Mathilde. 'Fortunately, she did not understand.' This
reflection restored all his presence of mind. He found Mathilde
changed as though after six months of illness: she was positively
unrecognisable.</p>

<p>'That wretch Frilair has betrayed me,' she said to him, wringing
her hands; rage prevented her from speaking.</p>

<p>'Was I not fine yesterday when I rose to speak?' replied Julien.
'I was improvising, and for the first time in my life! It is true
that there is reason to fear it may also be the last.'</p>

<p>At this moment Julien was playing upon Mathilde's nature with
all the calm of a skilled pianist touching the keys of a
piano...'The advantage of noble birth I lack, it is true,' he went
on, 'but the great heart of Mathilde has raised her lover to her
own level. Do you suppose that Boniface de La Mole cut a better
figure before his judges?'</p>

<p>Mathilde, that morning, was tender without affectation, like any
poor girl dwelling in an attic; but she could not win from him any
simpler speech. He paid her back, unconsciously, the torment that
she had often inflicted on him.</p>

<p>'We do not know the source of the Nile,' Julien said to himself;
'it has not been granted to the eye of man to behold the King of
Rivers in the form of a simple rivulet: similarly no human eye
shall ever see Julien weak, if only because he is not weak. But I
have a heart that is easily moved; the most commonplace words, if
they are uttered with an accent of truth, may soften my voice and
even make my tears begin to flow. How often have not the sere
hearts despised me for this defect! They believed that I was
begging for mercy: that is what I cannot endure.</p>

<p>'They say that the thought of his wife overcame Danton at the
foot of the scaffold; but Danton had given strength to a nation of
coxcombs, and prevented the enemy from reaching Paris...I alone
know what I might have managed to do...To others, I am at best only
a might-have-been.</p>

<p>'If Madame de Rênal had been here, in my cell, instead of
Mathilde, should I have been able to control myself? The intensity
of my despair and of my repentance would have appeared in the eyes
of the Valenods, and of all the patricians of the neighbourhood, a
craven fear of death; they are so proud, those feeble hearts, whom
their financial position places out of reach of temptation! "You
see what it is," M. de Moirod and M. de Cholin, who have just
sentenced me to death, would have said, "to be born the son of a
carpenter! One may become learned, clever, but courage!... Courage
is not taught at school." Even this poor Mathilde, who is now
weeping, or rather who can no longer weep,' he said, looking at her
red eyes...and he took her in his arms: the sight of genuine grief
made him forget his syllogism. 'She has been weeping all night,
perhaps,' he said to himself: 'but one day how ashamed she will be
when she remembers! She will regard herself as having been led
astray, in early youth, by the low opinions of a plebeian...
Croisenois is weak enough to marry her, and, i' faith, he will do
well for himself. She will make him play a part,</p>

<p>"By that right<br>
Which a firm spirit planning vast designs<br>
Has o'er the loutish minds of common men."</p>

<p>'Ah, now; here is a pleasant thing: now that I am to die, all
the poetry I ever learned in my life comes back to me. It must be a
sign of decadence...'</p>

<p>Mathilde kept on saying to him in a faint voice: 'He is there,
in the next room.' At length he began to pay attention to her
words. 'Her voice is feeble,' he thought, 'but all her imperious
nature is still in its accents. She lowers her voice in order not
to lose her temper.</p>

<p>'Who is there?' he asked her gently.</p>

<p>'The lawyer, to make you sign your appeal.'</p>

<p>'I shall not appeal.'</p>

<p>'What! You will not appeal,' she said, rising to her feet, her
eyes ablaze with anger, 'and why not, if you please?'</p>

<p>'Because at this moment I feel that I have the courage to die
without exciting undue derision. And who can say that in two
months' time, after a long confinement in this damp cell, I shall
be so well prepared? I foresee interviews with priests, with my
father...I can imagine nothing so unpleasant. Let us die.'</p>

<p>This unexpected obstinacy awoke all the latent pride in
Mathilde's nature. She had not been able to see the abbe de Frilair
before the hour at which the cells in the prison of Besançon were
opened; her anger fell upon Julien. She adored him, and for the
next quarter of an hour he was reminded by her imprecations against
his character, her regrets that she had ever loved him, of that
proud spirit which in the past had heaped such poignant insults
upon him, in the library of the Hotel de La Mole.</p>

<p>'Heaven owed it to the glory of your race to bring you into the
world a man,' he told her.</p>

<p>'But as for myself,' he thought, 'I should be a rare fool to
live two months longer in this disgusting abode, the butt of all
the infamous and humiliating lies that the patrician faction is
capable of inventing, [Footnote: A Jacobin is speaking. (Stendhal's
note.)] my sole comfort the imprecations of this madwoman... Well,
the day after tomorrow, I shall be fighting a duel in the morning
with a man well known for his coolness and for his remarkable
skill...Very remarkable,' whispered Mephistopheles, 'he never
misses his stroke.</p>

<p>'Very well, so be it, all's well that ends well.' (Mathilde's
eloquence continued to flow.) 'Begad, no,' he said to himself, 'I
shall not appeal.'</p>

<p>Having made this decision, he relapsed into his dreams...'The
postman on his rounds will bring the newspaper at six o'clock, as
usual; at eight, after M. de Rênal has read it, Elisa, entering the
room on tiptoe, will lay it down on her bed. Later, she will awake:
suddenly, as she reads, she will grow troubled; her lovely hand
will tremble; she will come to the words: <i>At five minutes past
ten he had ceased to live</i>.</p>

<p>'She will shed hot tears, I know her; in vain did I seek to
murder her, all will be forgotten, and the person whose life I
sought to take will be the only one who will weep sincerely for my
death.</p>

<p>'Ah, this is a paradox!' he thought, and, for the next quarter
of an hour, while Mathilde continued to make a scene, he thought
only of Madame de Rênal. In spite of himself, and albeit frequently
replying to what Mathilde said to him, he could not free his mind
from the memory of that bedroom at Verrières. He saw the <i>Gazette
de Besançon</i> lying on the counterpane of orange taffeta. He saw
that snowy hand clutching it with a convulsive movement; he saw
Madame de Rênal weep ...He followed the course of each tear over
that charming face. Mademoiselle de La Mole, having failed to get
anything out of Julien, made the lawyer come in. He was fortunately
an old Captain of the Army of Italy, of 1796, when he had served
with Manuel.</p>

<p>For the sake of form, he opposed the condemned man's decision.
Julien, wishing to treat him with respect, explained all his
reasons to him.</p>

<p>'Faith, one may think as you do,' M. Felix Vaneau (this was the
lawyer's name) said to him at length. 'But you have three clear
days in which to appeal, and it is my duty to come back each day.
If a volcano opened beneath the prison, in the next two months, you
would be saved. You may die a natural death,' he said, looking at
Julien.</p>

<p>Julien shook his hand. 'I thank you, you are an honest man. I
shall think it over.'</p>

<p>And when Mathilde left him, finally, with the lawyer, he felt
far more affection for the lawyer than for her.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch73" id="ch73"></a>. Chapter 73. Last Adieux</h2>

<p>An hour later, when he was fast asleep, he was awakened by the
tears which he felt trickling over his hand. 'Ah! Mathilde again,'
he thought to himself, half awake. 'She has come, faithful to her
theory, to attack my resolve by force of tender sentiments.'
Irritated by the prospect of this fresh scene in the pathetic
manner, he did not open his eyes. The lines of Belphegor flying
from his wife came into his mind.</p>

<p>He heard a strange sigh; he opened his eyes; it was Madame de
Rênal.</p>

<p>'Ah! Do I see you again before my death? Is it a phantom?' he
cried, as he flung himself at her feet.</p>

<p>'But forgive me, Madame, I am nothing but a murderer in your
eyes,' he at once added, regaining his composure.</p>

<p>'Sir,...I have come to implore you to appeal, I know that you do
not wish to...' She was choked by her sobs; she was unable to
speak.</p>

<p>'Deign to forgive me.'</p>

<p>'If you wish me to forgive you,' she said to him, rising and
throwing herself into his arms, 'appeal at once from the sentence
of death.'</p>

<p>Julien covered her with kisses.</p>

<p>'Will you come and see me every day during the next two
months?'</p>

<p>'I swear it to you. Every day, unless my husband forbids
me.'</p>

<p>'Then I sign!' cried Julien. 'What! You forgive me! Is it
possible?'</p>

<p>He clasped her in his arms; he was mad. She uttered a faint
cry.</p>

<p>'It is nothing,' she told him, 'you hurt me.'</p>

<p>'In your shoulder,' cried Julien, bursting into tears. He
stepped back from her, and covered her hand with burning kisses.
'Who would ever have said, last time I saw you, in your bedroom, at
Verrières...?'</p>

<p>'Who would ever have said then that I should write M. de La Mole
that infamous letter...?'</p>

<p>'Know that I have always loved you, that I have never loved
anyone but you.'</p>

<p>'Is it really possible?' cried Madame de Rênal, equally
enraptured. She bowed herself over Julien, who was kneeling at her
feet, and for a long time they wept in silence.</p>

<p>At no time in his life had Julien experienced such a moment.</p>

<p>After a long interval, when they were able to speak:</p>

<p>'And that young Madame Michele!' said Madame de Rênal, 'or
rather that Mademoiselle de La Mole; for I am beginning really to
believe this strange tale!'</p>

<p>'It is true only in appearance,' replied Julien. 'She is my
wife, but she is not my mistress...'</p>

<p>And, each interrupting the other a hundred times, they managed
with difficulty, each of them, to tell what the other did not know.
The letter sent to M. de La Mole had been written by the young
priest who directed Madame de Rênal's conscience, and then copied
out by her. 'What a terrible crime religion has made me commit!'
she said to him; 'though I did modify the worst passages in the
letter...'</p>

<p>Julien's transports of joy proved to her how completely he
forgave her. Never had he been so madly in love.</p>

<p>'And yet I regard myself as pious,' Madame de Rênal told him in
the course of their conversation. 'I believe sincerely in God; I
believe equally, indeed it has been proved to me, that the crime I
am committing is fearful, and yet, as soon as I set eyes on you,
even after you have fired at me twice with a pistol...' Here, in
spite of her resistance, Julien covered her with kisses.</p>

<p>'Let me alone,' she went on, 'I wish to argue with you, before I
forget... As soon as I set eyes on you, all sense of duty vanishes,
there is nothing left of me but love for you, or rather love is too
feeble a word. I feel for you what I ought to feel only for God: a
blend of respect, love, obedience...In truth, I do not know what
feeling you inspire in me. Were you to bid me thrust a knife into
your gaoler, the crime would be committed before I had had time to
think. Explain this to me in simple terms before I leave you, I
wish to see clearly into my own heart; for in two months we must
part...For that matter, need we part?' she said, with a smile.</p>

<p>'I take back my word,' cried Julien, springing to his feet; 'I
shall not appeal from the sentence of death, if by poison, knife,
pistol, charcoal or any other means whatsoever, you seek to put an
end to, or to endanger your life.'</p>

<p>Madame de Rênal's expression altered suddenly; the warmest
affection gave place to a profound abstraction.</p>

<p>'If we were to die at once?' she said to him at length.</p>

<p>'Who knows what we shall find in our next life?' replied Julien;
'torments perhaps, perhaps nothing at all. Can we not spend two
months together in a delicious manner? Two months, that is ever so
many days. Never shall I have been so happy.'</p>

<p>'You will never have been so happy?'</p>

<p>'Never,' replied Julien with rapture, 'and I am speaking to you
as I speak to myself. Heaven preserve me from exaggeration.'</p>

<p>'To speak so is to command me,' she said with a timid and
melancholy smile.</p>

<p>'Very well! You swear, by the love that you bear me, not to
attempt your life by any direct means, or indirect
means...Remember,' he added, 'that you are compelled to live for my
son, whom Mathilde will abandon to the care of servants as soon as
she is Marquise de Croisenois.'</p>

<p>'I swear,' she replied coldly, 'but I mean to take away with me
your appeal written and signed by your hand. I shall go myself to
the Attorney-General.'</p>

<p>'Take care, you will compromise yourself.'</p>

<p>'After coming publicly to see you in prison, I am for ever, for
Besançon and the whole of the Franche-Comté, a heroine of
anecdotes,' she said with an air of profound distress. 'I have gone
beyond the last limits of modesty...I am a woman who has forfeited
her honour; it is true that it was for your sake...'</p>

<p>Her tone was so melancholy that Julien embraced her with a
happiness that was quite new to him. It was no longer the
intoxication of love, it was extreme gratitude. He had just
realised, for the first time, the full extent of the sacrifice that
she had made for him.</p>

<p>Some charitable soul doubtless informed M. de Rênal of the long
visits which his wife was paying to Julien's prison; for, after
three days, he sent his carriage for her, with express orders that
she was to return immediately to Verrières.</p>

<p>This cruel parting had begun the day ill for Julien. He was
informed, two or three hours later, that a certain intriguing
priest, who for all that had not succeeded in making any headway
among the Jesuits of Besançon, had taken his stand that morning
outside the gate of the prison, in the street. It was raining hard,
and outside there the man was trying to pose as a martyr. Julien
was out of temper, this piece of foolishness moved him
profoundly.</p>

<p>That morning he had already refused a visit from the priest, but
the man had made up his mind to hear Julien's confession, and to
make a name for himself among the young women of Besançon, on the
strength of all the confidences which he would pretend to have
received.</p>

<p>He declared in a loud voice that he was going to remain day and
night at the gate of the prison: 'God has sent me to touch the
heart of this other apostate.' And the lower orders, always curious
spectators of a scene, began to assemble in crowds.</p>

<p>'Yes, my brethren,' he said to them, 'I shall spend the day
here, and the night, and every day and night from now onwards. The
Holy Spirit has spoken to me. I have a mission from on high; it is
I that am to save the soul of young Sorel. Join with me in my
prayers,' etc., etc.</p>

<p>Julien had a horror of scandal, and of anything that might
attract attention to himself. He thought of seizing the opportunity
to escape from the world unknown; but he had still some hope of
seeing Madame de Rênal again, and was desperately in love.</p>

<p>The gate of the prison was situated in one of the most
frequented streets. The thought of that mud-bespattered priest,
drawing a crowd and creating a scandal, was torture to his soul.
'And, without a doubt, at every instant he is repeating my name!'
This moment was more painful than death itself.</p>

<p>He called two or three times, at intervals of an hour, for a
turnkey who was devoted to him, to send him out to see whether the
priest were still at the gate of the prison.</p>

<p>'Sir, he is on both his knees in the mud,' was the turnkey's
invariable answer; 'he is praying aloud, and repeating Litanies for
your soul.' 'The impertinent fellow!' thought Julien. At that
moment, indeed, he heard a dull roar, it was the crowd responding
to the Litany. To increase his impatience, he saw the turnkey move
his lips as he repeated the Latin words. 'They are beginning to
say,' the turnkey added, 'that your heart must indeed be hardened
if you refuse the succour of this holy man.'</p>

<p>'O my country! How barbarous you still are!' cried Julien in a
frenzy of rage. And he continued his reasoning aloud, without a
thought of the turnkey's presence.</p>

<p>'The man wants an article in the paper, and now he is certain of
obtaining it.</p>

<p>'Oh, cursed provincials! In Paris, I should not have been
subjected to all these vexations. They are more adept there in
charlatanism.</p>

<p>'Let this holy priest come in,' he said at length to the
turnkey, and the sweat trickled in great drops from his brow. The
turnkey made the sign of the Cross, and left the cell radiant.</p>

<p>The holy priest proved to be hideously ugly, and was even more
foul with mud. The cold rain outside intensified the darkness and
dampness of the cell. The priest tried to embrace Julien, and began
to show emotion as he spoke to him. The vilest hypocrisy was all
too evident; never in his life had Julien been in such a rage.</p>

<p>A quarter of an hour after the priest had entered, Julien found
himself a complete coward. For the first time death appeared to him
horrible. He thought of the state of putrefaction in which his body
would be two days after his execution, etc., etc.</p>

<p>He was on the point of betraying himself by some sign of
weakness, or of flinging himself upon the priest and strangling him
with his chain, when it occurred to him to beg the holy man to go
and say a good forty-franc mass for him, that very day.</p>

<p>As it was almost midday, the priest decamped.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch74" id="ch74"></a>. Chapter 74. The Shadow of the
Guillotine</h2>

<p>As soon as he had gone, Julien began to weep copiously, at the
thought of dying. After a while he said to himself that, if Madame
de Rênal had been at Besançon, he would have confessed his weakness
to her...</p>

<p>At the moment when he most regretted the absence of that beloved
woman, he heard Mathilde's step.</p>

<p>'The worst drawback of a prison,' he thought, 'is that one can
never close one's door.' All that Mathilde had to say served only
to irritate him.</p>

<p>She informed him that, on the day of the trial, M. de Valenod,
having in his pocket his appointment as Prefect, had ventured to
defy M. de Frilair and indulge himself in the pleasure of
condemning Julien to death.</p>

<p>'"Whatever induced your friend," M. de Frilair said to me just
now, "to go and arouse and attack the petty vanity of that
middle-class aristocracy? Why speak of caste? He showed them what
they ought to do in their own political interest: the fools had
never thought of it, and were ready to cry. This caste interest
blinded their eyes to the horror of condemning a man to death. You
must admit that M. Sorel shows great inexperience. If we do not
succeed in saving him by an appeal to clemency, his death will be a
sort of suicide..."'</p>

<p>Mathilde did not, of course, mention to Julien a thing which she
herself did not yet suspect; namely, that the Abbe de Frilair,
seeing Julien irremediably lost, thought that it would serve his
own ambition to aspire to become his successor.</p>

<p>Almost out of his mind with helpless rage and vexation: 'Go and
hear a mass for me,' he said to Mathilde, 'and leave me a moment's
peace.' Mathilde, who was extremely jealous already at Madame de
Rênal's visits and had just heard of her departure, realised the
cause of Julien's ill humour and burst into tears.</p>

<p>Her grief was genuine, Julien saw this and was all the more
irritated. He felt a compelling need of solitude, and how was he to
securé it?</p>

<p>Finally Mathilde, having tried every argument to soften him,
left him to himself, but almost at that moment Fouque appeared.</p>

<p>'I want to be alone,' he said to this faithful friend. And, as
he saw him hesitate: 'I am composing a memorial for my appeal to
clemency...but anyhow...do me a favour, never to speak to me of
death. If I want any special services on the day, let me be the
first to mention them.'</p>

<p>When Julien had at length securéd solitude, he found himself
more crushed and more of a coward than before. What little strength
remained to his enfeebled spirit had been used up in the effort to
conceal his condition from Mademoiselle de La Mole and Fouque.</p>

<p>Towards evening, a comforting thought came to him:</p>

<p>'If this morning, at the moment when death seemed so ugly, I had
been warned to prepare for execution, <i>the eye of the public
would have been the incentive to glory</i>: my gait might perhaps
have been a little heavy, like that of a timid fop on entering a
drawing-room. A few perspicacious people, if there be any such
among these provincials, might have guessed my weakness...but <i>no
one would have seen it</i>.'</p>

<p>And he felt himself relieved of part of his load of misery. 'I
am a coward at this moment,' he chanted to himself, 'but no one
will know of it.'</p>

<p>An almost more disagreeable incident was in store for him on the
morrow. For a long time past, his father had been threatening a
visit; that morning, before Julien was awake, the white-haired old
carpenter appeared in his cell.</p>

<p>Julien felt utterly weak, he expected the most unpleasant
reproaches. To complete his painful sensation, that morning he felt
a keen remorse at not loving his father.</p>

<p>'Chance has placed us together on this earth,' he said to
himself while the turnkey was making the cell a little tidy, 'and
we have done one another almost all the harm imaginable. He comes
in the hour of my death to deal me his final blow.'</p>

<p>The old man's severe reproaches began as soon as they were left
without a witness.</p>

<p>Julien could not restrain his tears. 'What unworthy weakness!'
he said to himself angrily. 'He will go about everywhere
exaggerating my want of courage; what a triumph for Valenod and for
all the dull hypocrites who reign at Verrières! They are very great
people in France, they combine all the social advantages. Until now
I could at least say to myself: They receive money, it is true, all
the honours are heaped upon them, but I have nobility at heart.</p>

<p>'And here is a witness whom they will all believe, and who will
assure the whole of Verrières, exaggerating the facts, that I have
been weak in the face of death! I shall be said to have turned
coward in this trial which they can all understand!'</p>

<p>Julien was almost in despair. He did not know how to get rid of
his father. And to make-believe in such a way as to deceive this
sharp-witted old man was, for the moment, utterly beyond his
power.</p>

<p>His mind ran swiftly over all the possible ways of escape. 'I
have saved money!' he exclaimed suddenly.</p>

<p>This inspired utterance altered the old man's expression and
Julien's own position.</p>

<p>'How ought I to dispose of it?' he continued, with more calm:
the effect produced by his words had rid him of all sense of
inferiority.</p>

<p>The old carpenter was burning with a desire not to allow any of
this money to escape, a part of which Julien seemed to wish to
leave to his brothers. He spoke at great length and with heat.
Julien managed to tease him.</p>

<p>'Well, the Lord has given me inspiration for making my
testament. I shall give a thousand francs to each of my brothers,
and the remainder to you.'</p>

<p>'Very good,' said the old man, 'that remainder is my due; but
since God has been graciously pleased to touch your heart, if you
wish to die like a good Christian, you ought first to pay your
debts. There is still the cost of your maintenance and education,
which I advanced, and which you have forgotten...'</p>

<p>'So that is a father's love!' Julien repeated to himself with
despair in his heart, when at length he was alone. Soon the gaoler
appeared.</p>

<p>'Sir, after a visit from the family, I always bring my lodgers a
bottle of good champagne. It is a trifle dear, six francs the
bottle, but it rejoices the heart.'</p>

<p>'Bring three glasses,' Julien told him with boyish glee, 'and
send in two of the prisoners whom I hear walking in the
corridor.'</p>

<p>The gaoler brought him in two gaolbirds who had repeated their
offence and were waiting to be sent back to penal servitude. They
were a merry pair of scoundrels and really quite remarkable for
cunning, courage and coolness.</p>

<p>'If you give me twenty francs,' one of them said to Julien, 'I
will tell you the whole story of my life. It is as good as a
play.'</p>

<p>'But you will tell me lies?' said Julien.</p>

<p>'Not at all,' was the answer; 'my friend here, who wants my
twenty francs, will give me away if I don't tell the truth.'</p>

<p>His history was abominable. It revealed a courageous heart, in
which there survived but a single passion, the lust for money.</p>

<p>After they had left him, Julien was no longer the same man. All
his anger with himself had vanished. The piercing grief, envenomed
by cowardice, to which he had been a prey since the departure of
Madame de Rênal, had turned to melancholy.</p>

<p>'If I had only been less taken in by appearance,' he told
himself, 'I should have seen that the drawing-rooms of Paris are
inhabited by honest people like my father, or by able rascals like
these gaolbirds. They are right, the men in the drawing-rooms never
rise in the morning with that poignant thought: "How am I to dine
today?" And they boast of their probity! And, when summoned to a
jury, they proudly condemn the man who has stolen a silver fork
because he felt faint with hunger!</p>

<p>'But when there is a Court, when it is a question of securing or
losing a Portfolio, my honest men of the drawing-rooms fall into
crimes precisely similar to those which the want of food has
inspired in this pair of gaolbirds...</p>

<p>'There is no such thing as <i>natural law</i>: the expression is
merely a hoary piece of stupidity well worthy of the
Advocate-General who hunted me down the other day, and whose
ancestor was made rich by one of Louis XIV's confiscations. There
is no <i>law</i>, save when there is a statute to prevent one from
doing something, on pain of punishment. Before the statute, there
is nothing natural save the strength of the lion, or the wants of
the creature who suffers from hunger, or cold; in a word,
necessity...No, the men whom we honour are merely rascals who have
had the good fortune not to be caught red-handed. The accuser whom
society sets at my heels has been made rich by a scandalous
injustice...I have committed a murderous assault, and I am rightly
condemned, but, short of murder only, the Valenod who condemned me
is a hundred times more injurious to society.</p>

<p>'Ah, well,' Julien added sorrowfully, but without anger, 'for
all his avarice, my father is worth more than any of those men. He
has never loved me. I am now going to fill his cup to overflowing,
in dishonouring him by a shameful death. That fear of being in want
of money, that exaggerated view of the wickedness of mankind which
we call avarice, makes him see a prodigious source of consolation
and security in a sum of three or four hundred louis which I may
leave to him. On Sunday afternoons he will display his gold to all
his envious neighbours in Verrières. "To this tune," his glance
will say to them, "which of you would not be charmed to have a son
guillotined?"'</p>

<p>This philosophy might be true, but it was of a nature to make a
man long for death. In this way passed five endless days. He was
polite and gentle to Mathilde, whom he saw to be exasperated by the
most violent jealousy. One evening Julien thought seriously of
taking his life. His spirit was exhausted by the profound dejection
into which the departure of Madame de Rênal had cast him. Nothing
pleased him any more, either in real life or in imagination. Want
of exercise was beginning to affect his health and to give him the
weak and excitable character of a young German student. He was
losing that manly pride which repels with a forcible oath certain
degrading ideas by which the miserable are assailed.</p>

<p>'I have loved the Truth...Where is it to be found?...Everywhere
hypocrisy, or at least charlatanism, even among the most virtuous,
even among the greatest'; and his lips curled in disgust...'No, man
cannot place any trust in man.</p>

<p>'Madame de &mdash;&mdash;, when she was making a collection for
her poor orphans, told me that some Prince had just given her ten
louis; a lie. But what am I saying? Napoleon at
Saint-Helena!...Pure charlatanism, a proclamation in favour of the
King of Rome.</p>

<p>'Great God! If such a man as he, at a time, too, when misfortune
ought to recall him sternly to a sense of duty, stoops to
charlatanism, what is one to expect of the rest of the species?</p>

<p>'Where is Truth? In religion...Yes,' he added with a bitter
smile of the most intense scorn, 'in the mouths of the Maslons, the
Frilairs, the Castanedes...Perhaps in true Christianity, whose
priests would be no more paid than were the Apostles? But Saint
Paul was paid with the pleasure of commanding, of speaking, of
hearing himself spoken of...</p>

<p>'Ah! If there were a true religion...Idiot that I am! I see a
gothic cathedral, storied windows; my feeble heart imagines the
priest from those windows...My soul would understand him, my soul
has need of him. I find only a fop with greasy hair...little
different, in fact, from the Chevalier de Beauvoisis.</p>

<p>'But a true priest, a Massillon, a Fenelon...Massillon
consecrated Dubois. The <i>Memoires de Saint-Simon</i> have spoiled
Fenelon for me; but still, a true priest...Then the tender hearts
would have a meeting-place in this world...We should not remain
isolated...This good priest would speak to us of God. But what God?
Not the God of the Bible, a petty despot, cruel and filled with a
thirst for vengeance...but the God of Voltaire, just, good,
infinite...'</p>

<p>He was disturbed by all his memories of that Bible which he knew
by heart...'But how, whenever three are gathered together, how is
one to believe in that great name of GOD, after the frightful abuse
that our priests make of it?</p>

<p>'To live in isolation!...What torture!...</p>

<p>'I am becoming foolish and unjust,' said Julien, beating his
brow. 'I am isolated here in this cell; but I have not <i>lived in
isolation</i> on this earth; I had always the compelling idea of
<i>duty</i>. The duty that I had laid down for myself, rightly or
wrongly, was like the trunk of a strong tree against which I leaned
during the storm; I tottered, I was shaken. After all, I was only a
man...but I was not carried away.</p>

<p>'It is the damp air of this cell that makes me think of
isolation...</p>

<p>'And why be a hypocrite still when I am cursing hypocrisy? It is
not death, nor the cell, nor the damp air, it is the absence of
Madame de Rênal that is crushing me. If I were at Verrières, and,
in order to see her, were obliged to live for weeks on end hidden
in the cellars of her house, should I complain?</p>

<p>'The influence of my contemporaries is too strong for me,' he
said aloud and with a bitter laugh. 'Talking alone to myself,
within an inch of death, I am still a hypocrite...Oh, nineteenth
century!</p>

<p>'A hunter fires his gun in a forest, his quarry falls, he runs
forward to seize it. His boot strikes an anthill two feet high,
destroys the habitation of the ants, scatters the ants and their
eggs to the four winds...The most philosophical among the ants will
never understand that black, enormous, fearful body&mdash;the hunter's
boot which all of a sudden has burst into their dwelling with
incredible speed, preceded by a terrifying noise, accompanied by a
flash of reddish flame...</p>

<p>'So it is with death, life, eternity, things that would be quite
simple to anyone who had organs vast enough to conceive them...</p>

<p>'An ephemeral fly is born at nine o'clock in the morning, on one
of the long days of summer, to die at five o'clock in the
afternoon; how should it understand the word <i>night</i>?</p>

<p>'Grant it five hours more of existence, it sees and understands
what night is.</p>

<p>'And so with myself, I am to die at three and twenty. Grant me
five years more of life, to live with Madame de Rênal.'</p>

<p>Here he gave a satanic laugh. What folly to discuss these great
problems!</p>

<p>'<i>Imprimis</i>: I am a hypocrite just as much as if there was
someone in the cell to hear me.</p>

<p>'<i>Item</i>: I am forgetting to live and love, when I have so
few days left of life...Alas! Madame de Rênal is absent; perhaps
her husband will not allow her to come to Besançon again, and
disgrace herself further.</p>

<p>'That is what is isolating me, that and not the absence of a
just, good, all-powerful God, who is not wicked, not hungry for
vengeance...</p>

<p>'Ah! If He existed...Alas! I should fall at His feet. I have
deserved death, I should say to him; but, great God, good God,
indulgent God, restore to me her whom I love!'</p>

<p>The night was by now far advanced. After an hour or two of
peaceful slumber, Fouque arrived.</p>

<p>Julien felt himself to be strong and resolute like a man who
sees clearly into his own heart.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch75" id="ch75"></a>Chapter 75. Exit Julien</h2>

<p>'I will not play that poor abbe Chas-Bernard the unkind trick of
sending for him,' he said to Fouque; 'he would not be able to eat
his dinner for three days afterwards. But try to find me a
Jansenist, a friend of M. Pirard and beyond the reach of
intrigue.'</p>

<p>Fouque had been awaiting this development with impatience.
Julien acquitted himself in a decent fashion of everything that is
due to public opinion in the provinces. Thanks to M. l'abbe de
Frilair, and in spite of his unfortunate choice of a confessor,
Julien, in his cell, was under the protection of the Congregation;
with a little more of the spirit of action, he might have made his
escape. But, as the bad air of the cell produced its effect, his
mental powers dwindled. This made him all the happier on the return
of Madame de Rênal.</p>

<p>'My first duty is towards you,' she said to him as she embraced
him; 'I have fled from Verrières...'</p>

<p>Julien had no petty vanity in his relations with her, he told
her of all his weak moments. She was kind and charming to him.</p>

<p>That evening, immediately upon leaving the prison, she summoned
to her aunt's house the priest who had attached himself to Julien
as to a prey; as he wished only to acquire a reputation among the
young women belonging to the best society of Besançon, Madame de
Rênal easily persuaded him to go and offer a novena at the abbey of
Bray-le-Haut.</p>

<p>No words could express the intensity and recklessness of
Julien's love.</p>

<p>By spending money freely, and by using and abusing the
reputation of her aunt, well known for her piety and riches, Madame
de Rênal obtained permission to see him twice daily.</p>

<p>On hearing this, Mathilde's jealousy rose to the pitch of
insanity. M. de Frilair had assured her that in spite of his
position he dared not flout all the conventions so far as to permit
her to see her friend more than once daily. Mathilde had Madame de
Rênal followed, so as to be kept informed of her most trivial
actions. M. de Frilair exhausted every resource of a most cunning
mind, in trying to prove to her that Julien was unworthy of
her.</p>

<p>In the midst of all these torments, she loved him all the more,
and, almost every day, created a horrible scene in his cell.</p>

<p>Julien wished at all costs to behave like an honourable man
until the end towards this poor girl whom he had so seriously
compromised; but, at every moment, the unbridled passion that he
felt for Madame de Rênal overcame him. When, through some flaw in
his argument, he failed to convince Mathilde of the innocence of
her rival's visits: 'At this stage, the end of the play must be
very near,' he said to himself; 'that is some excuse for me if I
cannot act better.'</p>

<p>Mademoiselle de La Mole learned of the death of M. de
Croisenois. M. de Thaler, that man of boundless wealth, had taken
the liberty of saying unpleasant things about Mathilde's
disappearance; M. de Croisenois called on him with a request that
he would withdraw them: M. de Thaler showed him certain anonymous
letters addressed to himself, and full of details so skilfully put
together that it was impossible for the poor Marquis not to discern
the true facts.</p>

<p>M. de Thaler indulged in pleasantries that were distinctly
broad. Mad with rage and misery, M. de Croisenois insisted upon
reparations so drastic that the millionaire preferred a duel. Folly
proved triumphant; and one of the men in Paris most worthy of a
woman's love met his death in his twenty-fourth year.</p>

<p>This death made a strange and morbid impression on Julien's
weakened spirits.</p>

<p>'Poor Croisenois,' he said to Mathilde, 'did really behave quite
reasonably and honourably towards us; he had every right to hate me
after your imprudent behaviour in your mother's drawing-room, and
to seek a quarrel with me; for the hatred that follows on contempt
is generally furious.'</p>

<p>The death of M. de Croisenois altered all Julien's ideas with
regard to Mathilde's future; he devoted several days to proving to
her that she ought to accept the hand of M. de Luz. 'He is a shy
man, not too much of a Jesuit,' he told her, 'and a man who no
doubt intends to climb. With a more sober and persistent ambition
than poor Croisenois, and with no dukedom in his family, he will
make no difficulty about marrying Julien Sorel's widow.'</p>

<p>'And a widow who scorns grand passions,' replied Mathilde
coldly; 'for she has lived long enough to see, after six months,
her lover prefer another woman, and a woman who was the origin of
all their troubles.'</p>

<p>'You are unjust; Madame de Rênal's visits will furnish the
barrister from Paris, who has been engaged to conduct my appeal,
with some striking phrases; he will describe the murderer honoured
by the attentions of his victim. That may create an effect, and
perhaps one day you will see me the hero of some melodrama,' etc.,
etc.</p>

<p>A furious jealousy and one that was incapable of wreaking
vengeance, the prolongation of a hopeless misery (for, even
supposing Julien to be saved, how was she to recapture his heart?),
the shame and grief of loving more than ever this faithless lover,
had plunged Mademoiselle de La Mole in a grim silence from which
the zealous attentions of M. de Frilair were no more capable than
the rude frankness of Fouque, of making her emerge.</p>

<p>As for Julien, except during the moments usurped by the presence
of Mathilde, he was living upon love and with hardly a thought of
the future. A curious effect of this passion, in its extreme form
and free from all pretence, was that Madame de Rênal almost shared
his indifference and mild gaiety.</p>

<p>'In the past,' Julien said to her, 'when I might have been so
happy during our walks in the woods of Vergy, a burning ambition
led my soul into imaginary tracts. Instead of my pressing to my
heart this lovely arm which was so near to my lips, the thought of
my future tore me away from you; I was occupied with the countless
battles which I should have to fight in order to build up a
colossal fortune...No, I should have died without knowing what
happiness meant, had you not come to visit me in this prison.'</p>

<p>Two incidents occurred to disturb this tranquil existence.
Julien's confessor, for all that he was a Jansenist, was not immune
from an intrigue by the Jesuits, and quite unawares became their
instrument.</p>

<p>He came one day to inform him that if he were not to fall into
the mortal sin of suicide, he must take every possible step to
obtain a reprieve. Now, the clergy having considerable influence at
the Ministry of Justice in Paris, an easy method offered itself: he
must undergo a sensational conversion...</p>

<p>'Sensational!' Julien repeated. 'Ah! I have caught you at the
same game, Father, play-acting like any missionary...'</p>

<p>'Your tender age,' the Jansenist went or gravely, 'the
interesting appearance with which Providence has blessed you, the
motive itself of your crime, which remains inexplicable, the heroic
measures of which Mademoiselle de La Mole is unsparing on your
behalf, everything, in short, including the astonishing affection
that your victim shows for you, all these have combined to make you
the hero of the young women of Besançon. They have forgotten
everything for you, even politics...</p>

<p>'Your conversion would strike an echo in their hearts, and would
leave a profound impression there. You can be of the greatest
service to religion, and am I to hesitate for the frivolous reason
that the Jesuits would adopt the same course in similar
circumstances! And so, even in this particular case which has
escaped their rapacity, they would still be doing harm! Let such a
thing never be said...The tears which will flow at your conversion
will annul the corrosive effect of ten editions of the impious
works of Voltaire.'</p>

<p>'And what shall I have left,' replied Julien coldly, 'if I
despise myself? I have been ambitious, I have no wish to reproach
myself; I acted then according to the expediency of the moment.
Now, I am living from day to day. But, generally speaking, I should
be making myself extremely unhappy, if I gave way to any cowardly
temptation...'</p>

<p>The other incident, which affected Julien far more keenly, arose
from Madame de Rênal. Some intriguing friend or other had managed
to persuade this simple, timid soul that it was her duty to go to
Saint-Cloud, and to throw herself at the feet of King Charles
X.</p>

<p>She had made the sacrifice of parting from Julien, and after
such an effort, the unpleasantness of making a public spectacle of
herself, which at any other time would have seemed to her worse
than death, was no longer anything in her eyes.</p>

<p>'I shall go to the King, I shall confess proudly that you are my
lover: the life of a man, and of such a man as Julien, must
outweigh all other considerations. I shall say that it was out of
jealousy that you attempted my life. There are endless examples of
poor young men who have been saved in such cases by the humanity of
a jury, or by that of the King...'</p>

<p>'I shall cease to see you, I shall bar the door of my prison
against you,' cried Julien, 'and most certainly I shall kill myself
in despair, the day after, unless you swear to me that you will
take no step that will make us both a public spectacle. This idea
of going to Paris is not yours. Tell me the name of the intriguing
woman who suggested it to you...</p>

<p>'Let us be happy throughout the few remaining days of this brief
life. Let us conceal our existence; my crime is only too plain.
Mademoiselle de La Mole has unbounded influence in Paris, you may
be sure that she is doing all that is humanly possible. Here in the
provinces, I have all the wealthy and respectable people against
me. Your action would embitter still further these wealthy and
above all moderate men, for whom life is such an easy matter...Let
us not give food for laughter to the Maslons, the Valenods, and a
thousand people better worth than they.'</p>

<p>The bad air of the cell became insupportable to Julien.
Fortunately on the day on which he was told that he must die, a
bright sun was gladdening the earth, and he himself was in a
courageous mood. To walk in the open air was a delicious sensation
to him, as is treading solid earth to A mariner who has long been
at sea. 'There, all is well,' he said to himself, 'I am not lacking
in courage.'</p>

<p>Never had that head been so poetic as at the moment when it was
about to fall. The most precious moments that he had known in the
past in the woods of Vergy came crowding into his mind with an
extreme vividness.</p>

<p>Everything passed simply, decorously, and without affectation on
his part.</p>

<p>Two days earlier, he had said to Fouque: 'For my emotions I
cannot answer; this damp and hideous cell gives me moments of fever
in which I am not myself; but fear, no; no one shall see me
blench.'</p>

<p>He had made arrangements in advance that on the morning of the
last day, Fouque should carry off Mathilde and Madame de Rênal.</p>

<p>'Take them in the same carriage,' he had told him. 'Arrange that
the post-horses shall gallop all the time. They will fall into one
another's arms, or else will show a deadly hatred for one another.
In either case, the poor women will have some slight distraction
from their terrible grief.'</p>

<p>Julien had made Madame de Rênal swear that she would live to
look after Mathilde's child.</p>

<p>'Who knows? Perhaps we continue to have sensation after our
death,' he said one day to Fouque. 'I should dearly like to repose,
since repose is the word, in that little cave in the high mountain
that overlooks Verrières. Many a time, as I have told you, retiring
by night to that cave, and casting my gaze afar over the richest
provinces of France, I have felt my heart ablaze with ambition: it
was my passion then...Anyhow, that cave is precious to me, and no
one can deny that it is situated in a spot that a philosopher's
heart might envy...Very well! These worthy members of the
Congregation of Besançon make money out of everything; if you know
how to set about it, they will sell you my mortal remains...'</p>

<p>Fouque was successful in this grim transaction. He was spending
the night alone in his room, by the body of his friend, when to his
great surprise, he saw Mathilde appear. A few hours earlier, he had
left her ten leagues from Besançon. There was a wild look in her
eyes.</p>

<p>'I wish to see him,' she said to him.</p>

<p>Fouque had not the courage to speak or to rise. He pointed with
his finger to a great blue cloak on the floor; in it was wrapped
all that remained of Julien.</p>

<p>She fell upon her knees. The memory of Boniface de La Mole and
of Marguerite de Navarre gave her, no doubt, a superhuman courage.
Her trembling hands unfolded the cloak. Fouque turned away his
eyes.</p>

<p>He heard Mathilde walking rapidly about the room. She lighted a
number of candles. When Fouque had summoned up the strength to look
at her, she had placed Julien's head upon a little marble table, in
front of her, and was kissing his brow...</p>

<p>Mathilde followed her lover to the tomb which he had chosen for
himself. A great number of priests escorted the coffin and, unknown
to all, alone in her draped carriage, she carried upon her knees
the head of the man whom she had so dearly loved.</p>

<p>Coming thus near to the summit of one of the high mountains of
the Jura, in the middle of the night, in that little cave
magnificently illuminated with countless candles, a score of
priests celebrated the Office of the Dead. All the inhabitants of
the little mountain villages, through which the procession passed,
had followed it, drawn by the singularity of this strange
ceremony.</p>

<p>Mathilde appeared in their midst in a flowing garb of mourning,
and, at the end of the service, had several thousands of five franc
pieces scattered among them.</p>

<p>Left alone with Fouque, she insisted upon burying her lover's
head with her own hands. Fouque almost went mad with grief.</p>

<p>By Mathilde's orders, this savage grot was adorned with marbles
sculptured at great cost, in Italy.</p>

<p>Madame de Rênal was faithful to her promise. She did not seek in
any way to take her own life; but, three days after Julien, died
while embracing her children.</p>

<p class="cpb">TO THE HAPPY FEW</p>

<p>The drawback of the reign of opinion, which however procurés
<i>liberty</i>, is that it interferes in matters with which it has
no concern; such as private life. Hence the gloom of America and
England. To avoid touching upon private life, the author has
invented a small town, <i>Verrières</i>, and when he required a
Bishop, a jury, an Assize Court, has placed them all in Besançon,
where he has never been.</p>
