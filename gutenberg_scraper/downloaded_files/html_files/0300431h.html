<h1><a name="p01">Preface</a></h1>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>The first performances of this play at home and abroad provoked
several confident anticipations that it would be published with an
elaborate prefatory treatise on Democracy to explain why I, formerly a
notorious democrat, have apparently veered round to the opposite
quarter and become a devoted Royalist. In Dresden the performance was
actually prohibited as a blasphemy against Democracy.</p>

<p>What was all this pother about? I had written a comedy in which a
King defeats an attempt by his popularly elected Prime Minister to
deprive him of the right to influence public opinion through the press
and the platform: in short, to reduce him to a cipher. The King's reply
is that rather than be a cipher he will abandon his throne and take his
obviously very rosy chance of becoming a popularly elected Prime
Minister himself. To those who believe that our system of votes for
everybody produces parliaments which represent the people it should
seem that this solution of the difficulty is completely democratic, and
that the Prime Minister must at once accept it joyfully as such. He
knows better. The change would rally the anti-democratic royalist vote
against him, and impose on him a rival in the person of the only public
man whose ability he has to fear. The comedic paradox of the situation
is that the King wins, not by exercising his royal authority, but by
threatening to resign it and go to the democratic poll.</p>

<p>That so many critics who believe themselves to be ardent democrats
should take the entirely personal triumph of the hereditary king over
the elected minister to be a triumph of autocracy over democracy, and
its dramatization an act of political apostasy on the part of the
author, convinces me that our professed devotion to political
principles is only a mask for our idolatry of eminent persons. The
Apple Cart exposes the unreality of both democracy and royalty as our
idealists conceive them. Our Liberal democrats believe in a figment
called a constitutional monarch, a sort of Punch puppet who cannot move
until his Prime Minister's fingers are in his sleeves. They believe in
another figment called a responsible minister, who moves only when
similarly actuated by the million fingers of the electorate. But the
most superficial inspection of any two such figures shews that they are
not puppets but living men, and that the supposed control of one by the
other and of both by the electorate amounts to no more than a not very
deterrent fear of uncertain and under ordinary circumstances quite
remote consequences. The nearest thing to a puppet in our political
system is a Cabinet minister at the head of a great public office.
Unless he possesses a very exceptional share of dominating ability and
relevant knowledge he is helpless in the hands of his officials. He
must sign whatever documents they present to him, and repeat whatever
words they put into his mouth when answering questions in parliament,
with a docility which cannot be imposed on a king who works at his job;
for the king works continuously whilst his ministers are in office for
spells only, the spells being few and brief, and often occurring for
the first time to men of advanced age with little or no training for
and experience of supreme responsibility. George the Third and Queen
Victoria were not, like Queen Elizabeth, the natural superiors of their
ministers in political genius and general capacity; but they were for
many purposes of State necessarily superior to them in experience, in
cunning, in exact knowledge of the limits of their responsibility and
consequently of the limits of their irresponsibility: in short, in the
authority and practical power that these superiorities produce. Very
clever men who have come into contact with monarchs have been so
impressed that they have attributed to them extraordinary natural
qualifications which they, as now visible to us in historical
perspective, clearly did not possess. In conflicts between monarchs and
popularly elected ministers the monarchs win every time when personal
ability and good sense are at all equally divided.</p>

<p>In The Apple Cart this equality is assumed. It is masked by a strong
contrast of character and methods which has led my less considerate
critics to complain that I have packed the cards by making the King a
wise man and the minister a fool. But that is not at all the relation
between the two. Both play with equal skill; and the King wins, not by
greater astuteness, but because he has the ace of trumps in his hand
and knows when to play it. As the prettier player of the two he has the
sympathy of the audience. Not being as pampered and powerful as an
operatic prima donna, and depending as he does not on some commercially
valuable talent but on his conformity to the popular ideal of dignity
and perfect breeding, he has to be trained, and to train himself, to
accept good manners as an indispensable condition of his intercourse
with his subjects, and to leave to the less highly placed such
indulgences as tempers, tantrums, bullyings, sneerings, swearings,
kickings: in short, the commoner violences and intemperances of
authority.</p>

<p>His ministers have much laxer standards. It is open to them, if it
will save their time, to get their own way by making scenes, flying
into calculated rages, and substituting vulgar abuse for argument. A
clever minister, not having had a royal training, will, if he finds
himself involved in a duel with his king, be careful not to choose the
weapons at which the king can beat him. Rather will he in cold blood
oppose to the king's perfect behavior an intentional misbehavior and
apparently childish petulance which he can always drop at the right
moment for a demeanor as urbane as that of the king himself, thus
employing two sets of weapons to the king's one. This gives him the
advantages of his own training as a successful ambitious man who has
pushed his way from obscurity to celebrity: a process involving a
considerable use of the shorter and more selfish methods of dominating
the feebly recalcitrant, the unreasonable, the timid, and the stupid,
as well as a sharp sense of the danger of these methods when dealing
with persons of strong character in strong positions.</p>

<p>In this light the style of fighting adopted by the antagonists in
the scrap between King Magnus and Mr Joseph Proteus is seen to be a
plain deduction from their relative positions and antecedents, and not
a manufactured contrast between democracy and royalty to the
disadvantage of the former. Those who so mistook it are out of date.
They still regard democracy as the under dog in the conflict. But to me
it is the king who is doomed to be tragically in that position in the
future into which the play is projected: in fact, he is visibly at
least half in it already; and the theory of constitutional monarchy
assumes that he is wholly in it, and has been so since the end of the
seventeenth century.</p>

<p>Besides, the conflict is not really between royalty and democracy.
It is between both and plutocracy, which, having destroyed the royal
power by frank force under democratic pretexts, has bought and
swallowed democracy. Money talks: money prints: money broadcasts: money
reigns; and kings and labor leaders alike have to register its decrees,
and even, by a staggering paradox, to finance its enterprises and
guarantee its profits. Democracy is no longer bought: it is bilked.
Ministers who are Socialists to the backbone are as helpless in the
grip of Breakages Limited as its acknowledged henchmen: from the moment
when they attain to what is with unintentional irony called power
(meaning the drudgery of carrying on for the plutocrats) they no longer
dare even to talk of nationalizing any industry, however socially
vital, that has a farthing of profit for plutocracy still left in it,
or that can be made to yield a farthing for it by subsidies.</p>

<p>King Magnus's little tactical victory, which bulks so largely in the
playhouse, leaves him in a worse plight than his defeated opponent, who
can always plead that he is only the instrument of the people's will,
whereas the unfortunate monarch, making a desperate bid for
dictatorship on the perfectly true plea that democracy has destroyed
all other responsibility (has not Mussolini said that there is a vacant
throne in every country in Europe waiting for a capable man to fill
it?), is compelled to assume full responsibility himself, and face all
the reproaches that Mr Proteus can shirk. In his Cabinet there is only
one friendly man who has courage, principle, and genuine good manners
when he is courteously treated; and that man is an uncompromising
republican, his rival for the dictatorship. The splendidly honest and
devoted Die-hard lady is too scornfully tactless to help much; but with
a little more experience in the art of handling effective men and women
as distinguished from the art of handling mass meetings Mr Bill
Boanerges might surprise those who, because he makes them laugh, see
nothing in him but a caricature.</p>

<p>In short, those critics of mine who have taken The Apple Cart for a
story of a struggle between a hero and a roomful of guys have been
grossly taken in. It is never safe to take my plays at their suburban
face value: it ends in your finding in them only what you bring to
them, and so getting nothing for your money.</p>

<p>On the subject of Democracy generally I have nothing to say that can
take the problem farther than I have already carried it in my
Intelligent Woman's Guide to Socialism and Capitalism. We have to solve
two inseparable main problems: the economic problem of how to produce
and distribute our subsistence, and the political problem of how to
select our rulers and prevent them from abusing their authority in
their own interests or those of their class or religion. Our solution
of the economic problem is the Capitalist system, which achieves
miracles in production, but fails so ludicrously and disastrously to
distribute its products rationally, or to produce in the order of
social need, that it is always complaining of being paralysed by its
"overproduction" of things of which millions of us stand in desperate
want. Our solution of the political problem is Votes for Everybody and
Every Authority Elected by Vote, an expedient originally devised to
prevent rulers from tyrannizing by the very effectual method of
preventing them from doing anything, and thus leaving everything to
irresponsible private enterprise. But as private enterprise will do
nothing that is not profitable to its little self, and the very
existence of civilization now depends on the swift and unhampered
public execution of enterprises that supersede private enterprise and
are not merely profitable but vitally necessary to the whole community,
this purely inhibitive check on tyranny has become a stranglehold on
genuine democracy. Its painfully evolved machinery of parliament and
Party System and Cabinet is so effective in obstruction that we take
thirty years by constitutional methods to do thirty minutes work, and
shall presently be forced to clear up thirty years arrears in thirty
minutes by unconstitutional ones unless we pass a Reform Bill that will
make a complete revolution in our political machinery and procedure.
When we see parliaments like ours kicked into the gutter by dictators,
both in kingdoms and republics, it is foolish to wait until the
dictator dies or collapses, and then do nothing but pick the poor old
things up and try to scrape the mud off them: the only sane course is
to take the step by which the dictatorship could have been anticipated
and averted, and construct a political system for rapid positive work
instead of slow nugatory work, made to fit into the twentieth century
instead of into the sixteenth.</p>

<p>Until we face this task and accomplish it we shall not be able to
produce electorates capable of doing anything by their votes except
pave the way to their own destruction. An election at present,
considered as a means of selecting the best qualified rulers, is so
absurd that if the last dozen parliaments had consisted of the
candidates who were at the foot of the poll instead of those who were
at the head of it there is no reason to suppose that we should have
been a step more or less advanced than we are today. In neither case
would the electorate have had any real choice of representatives. If it
had, we might have had to struggle with parliaments of Titus Oateses
and Lord George Gordons dominating a few generals and artists, with
Cabinets made up of the sort of orator who is said to carry away his
hearers by his eloquence because, having first ascertained by a few
cautious feelers what they are ready to applaud, he gives it to them a
dozen times over in an overwhelming crescendo, and is in effect carried
away by them. As it is, the voters have no real choice of candidates:
they have to take what they can get and make the best of it according
to their lights, which is often the worst of it by the light of heaven.
By chance rather than by judgment they find themselves represented in
parliament by a fortunate proportion of reasonably honest and public
spirited persons who happen to be also successful public speakers. The
rest are in parliament because they can afford it and have a fancy for
it or an interest in it.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Last October (1929) I was asked to address the enormous audience
created by the new invention of Wireless Broadcast on a range of
political and cultural topics introduced by a previous speaker under
the general heading of Points of View. Among the topics was Democracy,
presented, as usual, in a completely abstract guise as an infinitely
beneficent principle in which we must trust though it slay us. I was
determined that this time Votes for Everybody and Every Authority
Elected by Vote should not escape by wearing its imposing mask. I
delivered myself as follows:</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Your Majesties, your Royal Highnesses, your Excellencies, your
Graces and Reverences, my Lords, Ladies and Gentlemen, fellow-citizens
of all degrees: I am going to talk to you about Democracy objectively:
that is, as it exists and as we must all reckon with it equally, no
matter what our points of view may be. Suppose I were to talk to you
not about Democracy, but about the sea, which is in some respects
rather like Democracy! We all have our own views of the sea. Some of us
hate it and are never well when we are at it or on it. Others love it,
and are never so happy as when they are in it or on it or looking at
it. Some of us regard it as Britain's natural realm and surest bulwark:
others want a Channel Tunnel. But certain facts about the sea are quite
independent of our feelings towards it. If I take it for granted that
the sea exists, none of you will contradict me. If I say that the sea
is sometimes furiously violent and always uncertain, and that those who
are most familiar with it trust it least, you will not immediately
shriek out that I do not believe in the sea; that I am an enemy of the
sea; that I want to abolish the sea; that I am going to make bathing
illegal; that I am out to ruin our carrying trade and lay waste all our
seaside resorts and scrap the British Navy. If I tell you that you
cannot breathe in the sea, you will not take that as a personal insult
and ask me indignantly if I consider you inferior to a fish. Well, you
must please be equally sensible when I tell you some hard facts about
Democracy. When I tell you that it is sometimes furiously violent and
always dangerous and treacherous, and that those who are familiar with
it as practical statesmen trust it least, you must not at once denounce
me as a paid agent of Benito Mussolini, or declare that I have become a
Tory Die-hard in my old age, and accuse me of wanting to take away your
votes and make an end of parliament, and the franchise, and free
speech, and public meeting, and trial by jury. Still less must you rise
in your places and give me three rousing cheers as a champion of
medieval monarchy and feudalism. I am quite innocent of any such
extravagances. All I mean is that whether we are Democrats or Tories,
Catholics or Protestants, Communists or Fascists, we are all face to
face with a certain force in the world called Democracy; and we must
understand the nature of that force whether we want to fight it or to
forward it. Our business is not to deny the perils of Democracy, but to
provide against them as far as we can, and then consider whether the
risks we cannot provide against are worth taking.</p>

<p>Democracy, as you know it, is seldom more than a long word beginning
with a capital letter, which we accept reverently or disparage
contemptuously without asking any questions. Now we should never accept
anything reverently until we have asked it a great many very searching
questions, the first two being What are you? and Where do you live?
When I put these questions to Democracy the answer I get is "My name is
Demos; and I live in the British Empire, the United States of America,
and wherever the love of liberty burns in the heart of man. You, my
friend Shaw, are a unit of Democracy: your name is also Demos: you are
a citizen of a great democratic community: you are a potential
constituent of the Parliament of Man, The Federation of the World." At
this I usually burst into loud cheers, which do credit to my
enthusiastic nature. To-night, however, I shall do nothing of the sort:
I shall say "Dont talk nonsense. My name is not Demos: it is Bernard
Shaw. My address is not the British Empire, nor the United States of
America, nor wherever the love of liberty burns in the heart of man: it
is at such and such a number in such and such a street in London; and
it will be time enough to discuss my seat in the Parliament of Man when
that celebrated institution comes into existence. I dont believe your
name is Demos: nobody's name is Demos; and all I can make of your
address is that you have no address, and are just a tramp--if indeed
you exist at all."</p>

<p>You will notice that I am too polite to call Demos a windbag or a
hot air merchant; but I am going to ask you to begin our study of
Democracy by considering it first as a big balloon, filled with gas or
hot air, and sent up so that you shall be kept looking up at the sky
whilst other people are picking your pockets. When the balloon comes
down to earth every five years or so you are invited to get into the
basket if you can throw out one of the people who are sitting tightly
in it; but as you can afford neither the time nor the money, and there
are forty millions of you and hardly room for six hundred in the
basket, the balloon goes up again with much the same lot in it and
leaves you where you were before. I think you will admit that the
balloon as an image of Democracy corresponds to the parliamentary
facts.</p>

<p>Now let us examine a more poetic conception of Democracy. Abraham
Lincoln is represented as standing amid the carnage of the battlefield
of Gettysburg, and declaring that all that slaughter of Americans by
Americans occurred in order that Democracy, defined as government
<i>of</i> the people <i>for</i> the people <i>by</i> the people, should
not perish from the earth. Let us pick this famous peroration to pieces
and see what there really is inside it. (By the way, Lincoln did not
really declaim it on the field of Gettysburg; and the American Civil
War was not fought in defence of any such principle, but, on the
contrary, to enable one half of the United States to force the other
half to be governed as they did not wish to be governed. But never mind
that. I mentioned it only to remind you that it seems impossible for
statesmen to make speeches about Democracy, or journalists to report
them, without obscuring it in a cloud of humbug.)</p>

<p>Now for the three articles of the definition. Number One: Government
<i>of</i> the people: that, evidently, is necessary: a human community
can no more exist without a government than a human being can exist
without a co-ordinated control of its breathing and blood circulation.
Number Two: Government <i>for</i> the people, is most important. Dean
Inge put it perfectly for us when he called Democracy a form of society
which means equal consideration for all. He added that it is a
Christian principle, and that, as a Christian, he believes in it. So do
I. That is why I insist on equality of income. Equal consideration for
a person with a hundred a year and one with a hundred thousand is
impossible. But Number Three: Government <i>by</i> the people, is quite
a different matter. All the monarchs, all the tyrants, all the
dictators, all the Die-hard Tories are agreed that we must be governed.
Democrats like the Dean and myself are agreed that we must be governed
with equal consideration for everybody. But we repudiate Number Three
on the ground that the people cannot govern. The thing is a physical
impossibility. Every citizen cannot be a ruler any more than every boy
can be an engine driver or a pirate king. A nation of prime ministers
or dictators is as absurd as an army of field marshals. Government by
the people is not and never can be a reality: it is only a cry by which
demagogues humbug us into voting for them. If you doubt this--if you
ask me "Why should not the people make their own laws?" I need only ask
you "Why should not the people write their own plays?" They cannot. It
is much easier to write a good play than to make a good law. And there
are not a hundred men in the world who can write a play good enough to
stand daily wear and tear as long as a law must.</p>

<p>Now comes the question, If we cannot govern ourselves, what can we
do to save ourselves from being at the mercy of those who <i>can</i>
govern, and who may quite possibly be thoroughpaced grafters and
scoundrels? The primitive answer is that as we are always in a huge
majority we can, if rulers oppress us intolerably, burn their houses
and tear them to pieces. This is not satisfactory. Decent people never
do it until they have quite lost their heads; and when they have lost
their heads they are as likely as not to burn the wrong house and tear
the wrong man to pieces. When we have what is called a popular movement
very few people who take part in it know what it is all about. I once
saw a real popular movement in London. People were running excitedly
through the streets. Everyone who saw them doing it immediately joined
in the rush. They ran simply because everyone else was doing it. It was
most impressive to see thousands of people sweeping along at full speed
like that. There could be no doubt that it was literally a popular
movement. I ascertained afterwards that it was started by a runaway
cow. That cow had an important share in my education as a political
philosopher; and I can assure you that if you will study crowds, and
lost and terrified animals, and things like that, instead of reading
books and newspaper articles, you will learn a great deal about
politics from them. Most general elections, for instance, are nothing
but stampedes. Our last but one was a conspicuous example of this. The
cow was a Russian one.</p>

<p>I think we may take it that neither mob violence nor popular
movements can be depended on as checks upon the abuse of power by
governments. One might suppose that at least they would act as a last
resort when an autocrat goes mad and commits outrageous excesses of
tyranny and cruelty. But it is a curious fact that they never do. Take
two famous cases: those of Nero and Tsar Paul the First of Russia. If
Nero had been an ordinary professional fiddler he would probably have
been no worse a man than any member of the wireless orchestra. If Paul
had been a lieutenant in a line regiment we should never have heard of
him. But when these two poor fellows were invested with absolute powers
over their fellow-creatures they went mad, and did such appalling
things that they had to be killed like mad dogs. Only, it was not the
people that rose up and killed them. They were dispatched quite
privately by a very select circle of their own bodyguards. For a
genuinely democratic execution of unpopular statesmen we must turn to
the brothers De Witt, who were torn to pieces by a Dutch mob in the
seventeenth century. They were neither tyrants nor autocrats. On the
contrary, one of them had been imprisoned and tortured for his
resistance to the despotism of William of Orange; and the other had
come to meet him as he came out of prison. The mob was on the side of
the autocrat. We may take it that the shortest way for a tyrant to get
rid of a troublesome champion of liberty is to raise a hue and cry
against him as an unpatriotic person, and leave the mob to do the rest
after supplying them with a well tipped ringleader. Nowadays this is
called direct action by the revolutionary proletariat. Those who put
their faith in it soon find that proletariats are never revolutionary,
and that their direct action, when it is controlled at all, is usually
controlled by police agents.</p>

<p>Democracy, then, cannot be government by the people: it can only be
government by consent of the governed. Unfortunately, when democratic
statesmen propose to govern us by our own consent, they find that we
dont want to be governed at all, and that we regard rates and taxes and
rents and death duties as intolerable burdens. What we want to know is
how little government we can get along with without being murdered in
our beds. That question cannot be answered until we have explained what
we mean by getting along. Savages manage to get along. Unruly Arabs and
Tartars get along. The only rule in the matter is that the civilized
way of getting along is the way of corporate action, not individual
action; and corporate action involves more government than individual
action.</p>

<p>Thus government, which used to be a comparatively simple affair,
today has to manage an enormous development of Socialism and Communism.
Our industrial and social life is set in a huge communistic framework
of public roadways, streets, bridges, water supplies, power supplies,
lighting, tramways, schools, dockyards, and public aids and
conveniences, employing a prodigious army of police, inspectors,
teachers, and officials of all grades in hundreds of departments. We
have found by bitter experience that it is impossible to trust
factories, workshops, and mines to private management. Only by stern
laws enforced by constant inspection have we stopped the monstrous
waste of human life and welfare it cost when it was left uncontrolled
by the Government. During the war our attempt to leave the munitioning
of the army to private enterprise led us to the verge of defeat and
caused an appalling slaughter of our soldiers. When the Government took
the work out of private hands and had it done in national factories it
was at once successful. The private firms were still allowed to do what
little they could; but they had to be taught to do it economically, and
to keep their accounts properly, by Government officials. Our big
capitalist enterprises now run to the Government for help as a lamb
runs to its mother. They cannot even make an extension of the Tube
railway in London without Government aid. Unassisted private capitalism
is breaking down or getting left behind in all directions. If all our
Socialism and Communism and the drastic taxation of unearned incomes
which finances it were to stop, our private enterprises would drop like
shot stags, and we should all be dead in a month. When Mr Baldwin tried
to win the last election by declaring that Socialism had been a failure
whenever and wherever it had been tried, Socialism went over him like a
steam roller and handed his office to a Socialist Prime Minister.
Nothing could save us in the war but a great extension of Socialism;
and now it is clear enough that only still greater extensions of it can
repair the ravages of the war and keep pace with the growing
requirements of civilization.</p>

<p>What we have to ask ourselves, then, is not whether we will have
Socialism and Communism or not, but whether Democracy can keep pace
with the developments of both that are being forced on us by the growth
of national and international corporate action.</p>

<p>Now corporate action is impossible without a governing body. It may
be the central Government: it may be a municipal corporation, a county
council, a district council, or a parish council. It may be the board
of directors of a joint stock company, or of a trust made by combining
several joint stock companies. Such boards, elected by the votes of the
shareholders, are little States within the State, and very powerful
ones, too, some of them. If they have not laws and kings, they have
by-laws and chairmen. And you and I, the consumers of their services,
are more at the mercy of the boards that organize them than we are at
the mercy of parliament. Several active politicians who began as
Liberals and are now Socialists have said to me that they were
converted by seeing that the nation had to choose, not between
governmental control of industry and control by separate private
individuals kept in order by their competition for our custom, but
between governmental control and control by gigantic trusts wielding
great power without responsibility, and having no object but to make as
much money out of us as possible. Our Government is at this moment
having much more trouble with the private corporations on whom we are
dependent for our coals and cotton goods than with France or the United
States of America. We are in the hands of our corporate bodies, public
or private, for the satisfaction of our everyday needs. Their powers
are life and death powers. I need not labor this point: we all know
it.</p>

<p>But what we do not all realize is that we are equally dependent on
corporate action for the satisfaction of our religious needs. Dean Inge
tells us that our general elections have become public auctions at
which the contending parties bid against one another for our votes by
each promising us a larger share than the other of the plunder of the
minority. Now that is perfectly true. The contending parties do not as
yet venture to put it exactly in those words; but that is what it comes
to. And the Dean's profession obliges him to urge his congregation,
which is much wider than that of St. Paul's (it extends across the
Atlantic), always to vote for the party which pledges itself to go
farthest in enabling those of us who have great possessions to sell
them and give the price to the poor. But we cannot do this as private
persons. It must be done by the Government or not at all. Take my own
case. I am not a young man with great possessions; but I am an old man
paying enough income tax and surtax to provide doles for some hundreds
of unemployed and old age pensioners. I have not the smallest objection
to this: on the contrary, I advocated it strongly for years before I
had any income worth taxing. But I could not do it if the Government
did not arrange it for me. If the Government ceased taxing my
superfluous money and redistributing it among people who have no
incomes at all, I could do nothing by myself. What could I do? Can you
suggest anything? I could send my war bonds to the Chancellor of the
Exchequer and invite him to cancel the part of the National Debt that
they represent; and he would undoubtedly thank me in the most courteous
official terms for my patriotism. But the poor would not get any of it.
The other payers of surtax and income tax and death duties would save
the interest they now have to pay on it: that is all. I should only
have made the rich richer and myself poorer. I could burn all my share
certificates and inform the secretaries of the companies that they
might write off that much of their capital indebtedness. The result
would be a bigger dividend for the rest of the shareholders, with the
poor out in the cold as before. I might sell my war bonds and share
certificates for cash, and throw the money into the street to be
scrambled for; but it would be snatched up, not by the poorest, but by
the best fed and most able-bodied of the scramblers. Besides, if we all
tried to sell our bonds and shares--and this is what you have to
consider; for Christ's advice was not addressed to me alone but to all
who have great possessions--the result would be that their value would
fall to nothing, as the Stock Exchange would immediately become a
market in which there were all sellers and no buyers. Accordingly, any
spare money that the Government leaves me is invested where I can get
the highest interest and the best security, as thereby I can make sure
that it goes where it is most wanted and gives immediate employment.
This is the best I can do without Government interference: indeed any
other way of dealing with my spare money would be foolish and
demoralizing; but the result is that I become richer and richer, and
the poor become relatively poorer and poorer. So you see I cannot even
be a Christian except through Government action; and neither can the
Dean.</p>

<p>Now let us get down to our problem. We cannot govern ourselves; yet
if we entrust the immense powers and revenues which are necessary in an
effective modern Government to an absolute monarch or dictator, he goes
more or less mad unless he is a quite extraordinary and therefore very
seldom obtainable person. Besides, modern government is not a one-man
job: it is too big for that. If we resort to a committee or parliament
of superior persons, they will set up an oligarchy and abuse their
power for their own benefit. Our dilemma is that men in the lump cannot
govern themselves; and yet, as William Morris put it, no man is good
enough to be another man's master. We need to be governed, and yet to
control our governors. But the best governors will not accept any
control except that of their own consciences; and, as we who are
governed are also apt to abuse any power of control we have, our
ignorance, our passions, our private and immediate interests are
constantly in conflict with the knowledge, the wisdom, and the public
spirit and regard for the future of our best qualified governors.</p>

<p>Still, if we cannot control our governors, can we not at least
choose them and change them if they do not suit?</p>

<p>Let me invent a primitive example of democratic choice. It is always
best to take imaginary examples: they offend nobody. Imagine then that
we are the inhabitants of a village. We have to elect somebody for the
office of postman. There are several candidates; but one stands out
conspicuously, because he has frequently treated us at the
public-house, has subscribed a shilling to our little flower show, has
a kind word for the children when he passes, and is a victim of
oppression by the squire because his late father was one of our most
successful poachers. We elect him triumphantly; and he is duly
installed, uniformed, provided with a red bicycle, and given a batch of
letters to deliver. As his motive in seeking the post has been pure
ambition, he has not thought much beforehand about his duties; and it
now occurs to him for the first time that he cannot read. So he hires a
boy to come round with him and read the addresses. The boy conceals
himself in the lane whilst the postman delivers the letters at the
house, takes the Christmas boxes, and gets the whole credit of the
transaction. In course of time he dies with a high reputation for
efficiency in the discharge of his duties; and we elect another equally
illiterate successor on similar grounds. But by this time the boy has
grown up and become an institution. He presents himself to the new
postman as an established and indispensable feature of the postal
system, and finally becomes recognized and paid by the village as
such.</p>

<p>Here you have the perfect image of a popularly elected Cabinet
Minister and the Civil Service department over which he presides. It
may work very well; for our postman, though illiterate, may be a very
capable fellow; and the boy who reads the addresses for him may be
quite incapable of doing anything more. But this does not always
happen. Whether it happens or not, the system is not a democratic
reality: it is a democratic illusion. The boy, when he has ability to
take advantage of the situation, is the master of the man. The person
elected to do the work is not really doing it: he is a popular humbug
who is merely doing what a permanent official tells him to do. That is
how it comes about that we are now governed by a Civil Service which
has such enormous power that its regulations are taking the place of
the laws of England, though some of them are made for the convenience
of the officials without the slightest regard to the convenience or
even the rights of the public. And how are our Civil Servants selected?
Mostly by an educational test which nobody but an expensively schooled
youth can pass, thus making the most powerful and effective part of our
government an irresponsible class government.</p>

<p>Now, what control have you or I over the Services? We have votes. I
have used mine a few times to see what it is like. Well, it is like
this. When the election approaches, two or three persons of whom I know
nothing write to me soliciting my vote and enclosing a list of
meetings, an election address, and a polling card. One of the addresses
reads like an article in The Morning Post, and has a Union Jack on it.
Another is like The Daily News or Manchester Guardian. Both might have
been compiled from the editorial waste paper baskets of a hundred years
ago. A third address, more up-to-date and much better phrased,
convinces me that the sender has had it written for him at the
headquarters of the Labor Party. A fourth, the most hopelessly out of
date of them all, contains scraps of the early English translations of
the Communist Manifesto of 1848. I have no guarantee that any of these
documents were written by the candidates. They convey nothing whatever
to me as to their character or political capacity. The half-tone
photographic portraits which adorn the front pages do not even tell me
their ages, having been taken twenty years ago. If I go to one of the
meetings I find a schoolroom packed with people who find an election
meeting cheaper and funnier than a theatre. On the platform sit one or
two poor men who have worked hard to keep party politics alive in the
constituency. They ought to be the candidates; but they have no more
chance of such eminence than they have of possessing a Rolls-Royce car.
They move votes of confidence in the candidate, though as the candidate
is a stranger to them and to everybody else present nobody can possibly
feel any such confidence. They lead the applause for him; they prompt
him when questions are asked; and when he is completely floored they
jump up and cry "Let me answer that, Mr Chairman!" and then pretend
that he has answered it. The old shibboleths are droned over; and
nothing has any sense or reality in it except the vituperation of the
opposition party, which is received with shouts of relief by the
audience. Yet it is nothing but an exhibition of bad manners. If I vote
for one of these candidates, and he or she is elected, I am supposed to
be enjoying a democratic control of the government--to be exercising
government <i>of</i> myself, <i>for</i> myself, <i>by</i> myself. Do
you wonder that the Dean cannot believe such nonsense? If I believed it
I should not be fit to vote at all. If this is Democracy, who can blame
Signor Mussolini for describing it as a putrefying corpse?</p>

<p>The candidates may ask me what more they can do for me but present
themselves and answer any questions I may put to them. I quite admit
that they can do nothing; but that does not mend matters. What I should
like is a real test of their capacity. Shortly before the war a doctor
in San Francisco discovered that if a drop of a candidate's blood can
be obtained on a piece of blotting paper it is possible to discover
within half an hour what is wrong with him physically. What I am
waiting for is the discovery of a process by which on delivery of a
drop of his blood or a lock of his hair we can ascertain what is right
with him mentally. We could then have a graded series of panels of
capable persons for all employments, public or private, and not allow
any person, however popular, to undertake the employment of governing
us unless he or she were on the appropriate panel. At the lower end of
the scale there would be a panel of persons qualified to take part in a
parish meeting; at the higher end a panel of persons qualified to act
as Secretaries of State for Foreign Affairs or Finance Ministers. At
present not more than two per thousand of the population would be
available for the highest panel. I should then be in no danger of
electing a postman and finding that he could neither read nor write. My
choice of candidates would be perhaps more restricted than at present;
but I do not desire liberty to choose windbags and nincompoops to
represent me in parliament; and my power to choose between one
qualified candidate and another would give me as much control as is
either possible or desirable. The voting and counting would be done by
machinery: I should connect my telephone with the proper office; touch
a button; and the machinery would do the rest.</p>

<p>Pending such a completion of the American doctor's discovery, how
are we to go on? Well, as best we can, with the sort of government that
our present system produces. Several reforms are possible without any
new discovery. Our present parliament is obsolete: it can no more do
the work of a modern State than Julius Caesar's galley could do the
work of an Atlantic liner. We need in these islands two or three
additional federal legislatures, working on our municipal committee
system instead of our parliamentary party system. We need a central
authority to co-ordinate the federal work. Our obsolete little internal
frontiers must be obliterated, and our units of local government
enlarged to dimensions compatible with the recent prodigious advances
in facility of communication and co-operation. Commonwealth affairs and
super-national activities through the League of Nations or otherwise
will have to be provided for, and Cabinet function to be transformed.
All the pseudo-democratic obstructive functions of our political
machinery must be ruthlessly scrapped, and the general problem of
government approached from a positive viewpoint at which mere anarchic
national sovereignty as distinguished from self-government will have no
meaning.</p>

<p>I must conclude by warning you that when everything has been done
that can be done, civilization will still be dependent on the
consciences of the governors and the governed. Our natural dispositions
may be good; but we have been badly brought up, and are full of
anti-social personal ambitions and prejudices and snobberies. Had we
not better teach our children to be better citizens than ourselves? We
are not doing that at present. The Russians <i>are.</i> That is my last
word. Think over it.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>So much for my broadcast on Democracy! And now a word about
Breakages, Limited. Like all Socialists who know their business I have
an exasperated sense of the mischief done by our system of private
Capitalism in setting up huge vested interests in destruction, waste,
and disease. The armament firms thrive on war; the glaziers gain by
broken windows; the operating surgeons depend on cancer for their
children's bread; the distillers and brewers build cathedrals to
sanctify the profits of drunkenness; and the prosperity of Dives costs
the privation of a hundred Lazaruses.</p>

<p>The title Breakages, Limited, was suggested to me by the fate of
that remarkable genius, the late Alfred Warwick Gattie, with whom I was
personally acquainted. I knew him first as the author of a play. He was
a disturbing man, afflicted--or, as it turned out, gifted--with chronic
hyper&aelig;sthesia, feeling everything violently and expressing his
feelings vehemently and on occasion volcanically. I concluded that he
was not sufficiently cold-blooded to do much as a playwright; so that
when, having lost sight of him for some years, I was told that he had
made an invention of first-rate importance, I was incredulous, and
concluded that the invention was only a Utopian project. Our friend
Henry Murray was so provoked by my attitude that to appease him I
consented to investigate the alleged great invention in person on
Gattie's promising to behave like a reasonable being during the
process, a promise which he redeemed with the greatest dignity,
remaining silent whilst an engineer explained his miracles to me, and
contenting himself with the reading of a brief statement shewing that
the adoption of his plan would release from industry enough men to
utterly overwhelm the Central Empires with whom we were then at
war.</p>

<p>I approached the investigation very sceptically. Our friend spoke of
"the works." I could not believe that Gattie had any works, except in
his fervid imagination. He mentioned "the company." That was more
credible: anyone may form a company; but that it had any resources
seemed to me doubtful. However, I suffered myself to be taken to
Battersea; and there, sure enough, I found a workshop, duly labelled as
the premises of The New Transport Company, Limited, and spacious enough
to accommodate a double railway line with a platform. The affair was
unquestionably real, so far. The platform was not provided with a
station: its sole equipment was a table with a row of buttons on it for
making electrical contacts. Each line of railway had on it a truck with
a steel lid. The practical part of the proceedings began by placing an
armchair on the lid of one of the trucks and seating me in it. A
brimming glass of water was then set at my feet. I could not imagine
what I was expected to do with the water or what was going to happen;
and there was a suggestion of electrocution about the chair which made
me nervous. Gattie then sat down majestically at the table on the
platform with his hand hovering over the buttons. Intimating that the
miracle would take place when my truck passed the other truck, he asked
me to choose whether it should occur at the first passage or later, and
to dictate the order in which it should be repeated. I was by that time
incapable of choosing; so I said the sooner the better; and the two
trucks started. When the other truck had passed mine I found myself
magically sitting on it, chair and all, with the glass of water
unspilled at my feet.</p>

<p>The rest of the story is a tragi-comedy. When I said to Gattie
apologetically (I felt deeply guilty of having underrated him) that I
had never known that he was an engineer, and had taken him to be the
usual amateur inventor with no professional training, he told me that
this was exactly what he was: just like Sir Christopher Wren. He had
been concerned in an electric lighting business, and had been revolted
by the prodigious number of breakages of glass bulbs involved by the
handling of the crates in which they were packed for transport by rail
and road. What was needed was a method of transferring the crates from
truck to truck, and from truck to road lorry, and from road lorry to
warehouse lift without shock, friction, or handling. Gattie, being, I
suppose, by natural genius an inventor though by mistaken vocation a
playwright, solved the mechanical problem without apparent difficulty,
and offered his nation the means of effecting an enormous saving of
labor and smash. But instead of being received with open arms as a
social benefactor he found himself up against Breakages, Limited. The
glass blowers whose employment was threatened, the exploiters of the
great industry of repairing our railway trucks (every time a goods
train is stopped a series of 150 violent collisions is propagated from
end to end of the train, as those who live within earshot know to their
cost), and the railway porters who dump the crates from truck to
platform and then hurl them into other trucks, shattering bulbs,
battering cans, and too often rupturing themselves in the process, saw
in Gattie an enemy of the human race, a wrecker of homes and a starver
of innocent babes. He fought them undauntedly; but they were too strong
for him; and in due time his patents expired and he died almost
unrecognized, whilst Unknown Soldiers were being canonized throughout
the world. So far, The Apple Cart is his only shrine; and as it does
not even bear his name, I have written it here pending its tardy
appearance in the roll of fame.</p>

<p>I must not leave my readers to assume that Gattie was an easy man to
deal with, or that he handled the opposition in a conciliatory manner
with due allowance for the inertia of a somewhat unimaginative
officialdom which had not, like myself, sat on his trucks, and probably
set him down as a Utopian (a species much dreaded in Government
departments) and thus missed the real point, which was that he was an
inventor. Like many men of genius he could not understand why things
obvious to him should not be so at once to other people, and found it
easier to believe that they were corrupt than that they could be so
stupid. Once, after I had urged him to be more diplomatic, he brought
me, with some pride, a letter to the Board of Trade which he considered
a masterpiece of tact and good temper. It contained not a word
descriptive of his invention; and it began somewhat in this fashion:
"Sir: If you are an honest man you cannot deny that among the worst
abuses of this corrupt age is the acceptance of city directorships by
retired members of the Board of Trade." Clearly it was not easy for the
Board of Trade to deal with an inventor who wished to interest them,
not in his new machines, but in the desirability of its abolishing
itself as infamous.</p>

<p>The last time I saw him he called on me to unfold a new scheme of
much greater importance, as he declared, than his trucks. He was very
interesting on that occasion. He began by giving me a vivid account of
the pirates who used to infest the Thames below London Bridge before
the docks were built. He described how the docks had come into
existence not as wharves for loading and unloading but as strongholds
in which ships and their cargoes could be secure from piracy. They are
now, he declared, a waste of fabulously valuable ground; and their work
should be done in quite another way. He then produced plans of a pier
to be built in the middle of the river, communicating directly by rail
and road with the shore and the great main lines. The ships would come
alongside the pier; and by a simple system of hoists the contents of
their holds would be lifted out and transferred (like myself in the
armchair) to railway trucks or motor lorries without being touched by a
human hand and therefore without risk of breakage. It was all so
masterly, so simple in its complexity, so convincing as to its
practicability, and so prodigiously valuable socially, that I, taking
it very seriously, proceeded to discuss what could be done to interest
the proper people in it.</p>

<p>To my amazement Gattie began to shew unmistakeable signs of
disappointment and indignation. "You do not seem to understand me," he
said. "I have shewn you all this mechanical stuff merely by way of
illustration. What I have come to consult you about is a great
melodrama I am going to write, the scene of which will be the Pool of
London in the seventeenth century among the pirates!"</p>

<p>What could I or anyone do with a man like that? He was na&iuml;vely
surprised when I laughed; and he went away only half persuaded that his
scheme for turning the docks into building land; expediting the Thames
traffic; saving much dangerous and demoralizingly casual labor; and
transfiguring the underpaid stevedore into a fullfed electrician, was
stupendously more important than any ridiculous melodrama. He admitted
that there was of course all that in it; but I could see that his heart
was in the melodrama.</p>

<p>As it was evident that officialdom, writhing under his insults and
shocked by his utter lack of veneration for bigwigs, besides being
hampered as all our Government departments are by the vested interests
of Breakages, Limited, would do nothing for him, I induced some less
embarrassed public persons to take a ride in the trucks and be
convinced that they really existed and worked. But here again the
parallel between Gattie and his fellow-amateur Sir Christopher Wren
came in. Wren was not content to redesign and rebuild St Paul's: he
wanted to redesign London as well. He was quite right: what we have
lost by not letting him do it is incalculable. Similarly, Gattie was
not content to improve the luggage arrangements of our railways: he
would not listen to you if your mind was not large enough to grasp the
immediate necessity for a new central clearing house in Farringdon
Market, connected with the existing railways by a system of new tubes.
He was of course right; and we have already lost by sticking to our old
ways more than the gigantic sum his scheme would have cost. But neither
the money nor the enterprise was available just then, with the war on
our hands. The Clearing House, like the Thames pier, remains on paper;
and Gattie is in his grave. But I still hold that there must have been
something great in a man who, having not only imagined them but
invented their machinery, could, far from being crushed by their
rejection, exclaim "Perish all my mechanical trash if only it provides
material for one bad play!"</p>

<p>This little history will explain how it actually did provide
material for Breakages, Limited, and for the bitter cry of the
Powermistress General. Not until Breakages is itself broken will it
cease to have a message for us.</p>

<p>AYOT ST LAWRENCE, <i>March 1930</i></p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<center>
<h1><a name="a01">ACT I</a></h1>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p><i>An office in the royal palace. Two writing-tables face each other
from opposite sides of the room, leaving plenty of room between them.
Each table has a chair by it for visitors. The door is in the middle of
the farthest wall. The clock shews that it is a little past 11;</i>
<i>and the light is that of a fine summer morning.</i></p>

<p><i>Sempronius, smart and still presentably young, shews his right
profile as he sits at one of the tables opening the King's
letters.</i></p>

<p><i>Pamphilius, middle aged, shews his left as he leans back in his
chair at the other table with a pile of the morning papers at his
elbow, reading one of them. This goes on silently for some time. Then
Pamphilius, putting down his paper, looks at Sempronius for a moment
before speaking.</i></p>

<p> </p>

<p>PAMPHILIUS. What was your father?</p>

<p>SEMPRONIUS <i>[startled]</i> Eh?</p>

<p>PAMPHILIUS. What was your father?</p>

<p>SEMPRONIUS. My father?</p>

<p>PAMPHILIUS. Yes. What was he?</p>

<p>SEMPRONIUS. A Ritualist.</p>

<p>PAMPHILIUS. I dont mean his religion. I mean his profession. And his
politics.</p>

<p>SEMPRONIUS. He was a Ritualist by profession, a Ritualist in
politics, a Ritualist in religion: a raging emotional Die Hard
Ritualist right down to his boots.</p>

<p>PAMPHILIUS. Do you mean that he was a parson?</p>

<p>SEMPRONIUS. Not at all. He was a sort of spectacular artist. He got
up pageants and Lord Mayors' Shows and military tattoos and big public
ceremonies and things like that. He arranged the last two coronations.
That was how I got my job here in the palace. All our royal people knew
him quite well: he was behind the scenes with them.</p>

<p>PAMPHILIUS. Behind the scenes and yet believed they were all
real!</p>

<p>SEMPRONIUS. Yes. Believed in them with all his soul.</p>

<p>PAMPHILIUS. Although he manufactured them himself?</p>

<p>SEMPRONIUS. Certainly. Do you suppose a baker cannot believe
sincerely in the sacrifice of the Mass or in holy communion because he
has baked the consecrated wafer himself?</p>

<p>PAMPHILIUS. I never thought of that.</p>

<p>SEMPRONIUS. My father might have made millions in the theatres and
film studios. But he refused to touch them because the things they
represented hadnt really happened. He didnt mind doing the christening
of Queen Elizabeth in Shakespear's Henry the Eighth because that had
really happened. It was a celebration of royalty. But not anything
romantic: not though they offered him thousands.</p>

<p>PAMPHILIUS. Did you ever ask him what he really thought about it
all? But of course you didnt: one cant ask one's father anything about
himself.</p>

<p>SEMPRONIUS. My dear Pam: my father never thought. He didnt know what
thought meant. Very few people do, you know. He had vision: actual
bodily vision, I mean; and he had an oddly limited sort of imagination.
What I mean is that he couldnt imagine anything he didnt see; but he
could imagine that what he did see was divine and holy and omniscient
and omnipotent and eternal and everything that is impossible if only it
looked splendid enough, and the organ was solemn enough, or the
military bands brassy enough.</p>

<p>PAMPHILIUS. You mean that he had to get everything from outside.</p>

<p>SEMPRONIUS. Exactly. He'd never have felt anything if he hadnt had
parents to feel about in his childhood, and a wife and babies to feel
about when he grew up. He'd never have known anything if he hadnt been
taught at school. He couldnt amuse himself: he had to pay oceans of
money to other people to amuse him with all sorts of ghastly sports and
pleasures that would have driven me into a monastery to escape from
them. You see it was all ritual: he went to the Riviera every winter
just as he went to church.</p>

<p>PAMPHILIUS. By the way, is he alive? I should like to know him.</p>

<p>SEMPRONIUS. No. He died in 1962, of solitude.</p>

<p>PAMPHILIUS. What do you mean? of solitude?</p>

<p>SEMPRONIUS. He couldnt bear to be alone for a moment: it was death
to him. Somebody had to be with him always.</p>

<p>PAMPHILIUS. Oh well, come! That was friendly and kindly. It shews he
had something inside him after all.</p>

<p>SEMPRONIUS. Not a bit. He never talked to his friends. He played
cards with them. They never exchanged a thought.</p>

<p>PAMPHILIUS. He must have been a rum old bird.</p>

<p>SEMPRONIUS. Not rum enough to be noticed. There are millions like
him.</p>

<p>PAMPHILIUS. But what about his dying of solitude? Was he
imprisoned?</p>

<p>SEMPRONIUS. No. His yacht struck a reef and sank somewhere off the
north of Scotland; and he managed to swim to an uninhabited island. All
the rest were drowned; and he was not taken off for three weeks. When
they found him he was melancholy mad, poor old boy; and he never got
over it. Simply from having no one to play cards with, and no church to
go to.</p>

<p>PAMPHILIUS. My dear Sem: one isnt alone on an uninhabited island. My
mother used to stand me on the table and make me recite about it.</p>

<p><i>[He declaims]</i></p>

<blockquote>
<p>To sit on rocks; to muse o'er flood and fell;<br>
 To slowly trace the forest's shady scene<br>
 Where things that own not man's dominion dwell<br>
 And mortal foot hath ne'er or rarely been;<br>
 To climb the trackless mountain all unseen<br>
 With the wild flock that never needs a fold;<br>
 Alone o'er steeps and foaming falls to lean:<br>
 This is not solitude: 'tis but to hold<br>
 Converse with Nature's charms, and view her stores unrolled.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>SEMPRONIUS. Now you have hit the really funny thing about my father.
All that about the lonely woods and the rest of it--what you call
Nature--didnt exist for him. It had to be something artificial to get
at him. Nature to him meant nakedness; and nakedness only disgusted
him. He wouldnt look at a horse grazing in a field; but put splendid
trappings on it and stick it into a procession and he just loved it.
The same with men and women: they were nothing to him until they were
dressed up in fancy costumes and painted and wigged and titled. To him
the sacredness of the priest was the beauty of his vestment, the
loveliness of women the dazzle of their jewels and robes, the charm of
the countryside not in its hills and trees, nor in the blue smoke from
its cottages in the winter evenings, but of its temples, palaces,
mansions, park gates, and porticoed country houses. Think of the horror
of that island to him! A void! a place where he was deaf and dumb and
blind and lonely! If only there had been a peacock with its tail in
full bloom it might have saved his reason; but all the birds were
gulls; and gulls are not decorative. Our King could have lived there
for thirty years with nothing but his own thoughts. You would have been
all right with a fishing rod and a golf ball with a bag of clubs. I
should have been as happy as a man in a picture gallery looking at the
dawns and sunsets, the changing seasons, the continual miracle of life
ever renewing itself. Who could be dull with pools in the rocks to
watch? Yet my father, with all that under his nose, was driven mad by
its nothingness. They say that where there is nothing the king loses
his rights. My father found that where there is nothing a man loses his
reason and dies.</p>

<p>PAMPHILIUS. Let me add that in this palace, when the king's letters
are not ready for him at 12 o'clock, a secretary loses his job.</p>

<p>SEMPRONIUS <i>[hastily resuming his work]</i> Yes, devil take you:
why did you start me talking before I had finished my work? You have
nothing to do but pretend to read the newspapers for him; and when you
say "Nothing particular this morning, Sir," all he says is "Thank
Heaven!" But if I missed a note from one of his aunts inviting herself
to tea, or a little line from Orinthia the Beloved marked "Strictly
private and confidential: to be opened by His Majesty alone," I should
never hear the end of it. He had six love letters yesterday; and all he
said when I told him was "Take them to the Queen." He thinks they amuse
her. I believe they make her as sick as they make me.</p>

<p>PAMPHILIUS. Do Orinthia's letters go to the Queen?</p>

<p>SEMPRONIUS. No, by George! Even I dont read Orinthia's letters. My
instructions are to read everything; but I take care to forget to open
hers. And I notice that I am not rebuked for my negligence.</p>

<p>PAMPHILIUS <i>[thoughtfully]</i> I suppose--</p>

<p>SEMPRONIUS. Oh shut up, Pam. I shall never get through if you go on
talking.</p>

<p>PAMPHILIUS. I was only going to say that I suppose--</p>

<p>SEMPRONIUS. Something about Orinthia. Dont. If you indulge in
supposition on that subject, you will lose your job, old chap. So stow
it.</p>

<p>PAMPHILIUS. Dont cry out before Orinthia is hurt, young chap. I was
going to say that I suppose you know that that bull-roarer Boanerges
has just been taken into the Cabinet as President of the Board of
Trade, and that he is coming here today to give the King a piece of his
mind, or what he calls his mind, about the crisis.</p>

<p>SEMPRONIUS. What does the King care about the crisis? There has been
a crisis every two months since he came to the throne; but he has
always been too clever for them. He'll turn Boanerges inside out after
letting him roar the palace down.</p>

<p><i>Boanerges enters, dressed in a Russian blouse and peaked cap,
which he keeps on. He is fifty, heavily built and aggressively
self-assertive.</i></p>

<p>BOANERGES. Look here. The King has an appointment with me at a
quarter to twelve. How long more am I to be kept waiting?</p>

<p>SEMPRONIUS <i>[with cheerful politeness]</i> Good morning. Mr
Boanerges, I think.</p>

<p>BOANERGES <i>[shortly, but a little taken aback]</i> Oh, good
morning to you. They say that politeness is the punctuality of
kings--</p>

<p>SEMPRONIUS. The other way about, Mr Boanerges. Punctuality is the
politeness of kings; and King Magnus is a model in that respect. Your
arrival cannot have been announced to His Majesty. I will see about it.
<i>[He hurries out].</i></p>

<p>PAMPHILIUS. Be seated, Mr Boanerges.</p>

<p>BOANERGES <i>[seating himself by Pamphilius's writing-table]</i> A
nice lot of young upstarts you have in this palace, Mr--?</p>

<p>PAMPHILIUS. Pamphilius is my name.</p>

<p>BOANERGES. Oh yes: Ive heard of you. Youre one of the king's private
secretaries.</p>

<p>PAMPHILIUS. I am. And what have our young upstarts been doing to
you, Mr Boanerges?</p>

<p>BOANERGES. Well, I told one of them to tell the king I was here, and
to look sharp about it. He looked at me as if I was a performing
elephant, and took himself off after whispering to another flunkey.
Then this other chap comes over to me and pretends he doesnt know who I
am! asks me can he have my name! "My lad" I said: "not to know me
argues yourself unknown. You know who I am as well as I do myself. Go
and tell the king I'm waiting for him, d'ye see?" So he took himself
off with a flea in his ear. I waited until I was fed up with it, and
then opened the nearest door and came in here.</p>

<p>PAMPHILIUS. Young rascals! However, my friend Mr Sempronius will
make it all right for you.</p>

<p>BOANERGES. Oh: that was Sempronius, was it. Ive heard of him
too.</p>

<p>PAMPHILIUS. You seem to have heard of all of us. You will be quite
at home in the palace now that you are a Cabinet Minister. By the way,
may I congratulate you on your appointment--or rather congratulate the
Cabinet on your accession?</p>

<p>SEMPRONIUS <i>[returning]</i> The King. <i>[He goes to his table and
takes the visitor's chair in his hand, ready for the king's
instructions as to where to place it].</i></p>

<p><i>Pamphilius rises. Boanerges turns to the door in his chair
without rising. King Magnus, a tallish studious looking gentleman of 45
or thereabouts, enters, and comes quickly down the middle of the room
to Boanerges, proffering his hand cordially.</i></p>

<p>MAGNUS. You are very welcome to my little palace, Mr Boanerges. Wont
you sit down?</p>

<p>BOANERGES. I am sitting down.</p>

<p>MAGNUS. True, Mr Boanerges. I had not noticed it. Forgive me: force
of habit.</p>

<p><i>He indicates to Sempronius that he wishes to sit near Boanerges,
on his right. Sempronius places the chair accordingly.</i></p>

<p>MAGNUS. You will allow me to be seated?</p>

<p>BOANERGES. Oh, sit down, man, sit down. Youre in your own house:
ceremony cuts no ice with me.</p>

<p>MAGNUS <i>[gratefully]</i> Thank you.</p>

<p><i>The King sits. Pamphilius sits. Sempronius returns to his table
and sits.</i></p>

<p>MAGNUS. It is a great pleasure to meet you at last, Mr Boanerges. I
have followed your career with interest ever since you contested
Northampton twenty-five years ago.</p>

<p>BOANERGES <i>[pleased and credulous]</i> I should just think you
have, King Magnus. I have made you sit up once or twice, eh?</p>

<p>MAGNUS <i>[smiling]</i> Your voice has shaken the throne oftener
than that.</p>

<p>BOANERGES <i>[indicating the secretaries with a jerk of his
head]</i> What about these two? Are they to overhear everything that
passes?</p>

<p>MAGNUS. My private secretaries. Do they incommode you?</p>

<p>BOANERGES. Oh, they dont incommode me. I am ready to have our talk
out in Trafalgar Square if you like, or have it broadcast on the
wireless.</p>

<p>MAGNUS. That would be a treat for my people, Mr Boanerges. I am
sorry we have not arranged for it.</p>

<p>BOANERGES <i>[gathering himself together formidably]</i> Yes; but do
you realize that I am going to say things to you that have never been
said to a king before?</p>

<p>MAGNUS. I am very glad indeed to hear it, Mr Boanerges. I thought I
had already heard everything that could be said to a king. I shall be
grateful for the smallest novelty.</p>

<p>BOANERGES. I warn you it wont be agreeable. I am a plain man,
Magnus: a very plain man.</p>

<p>MAGNUS. Not at all, I assure you--</p>

<p>BOANERGES <i>[indignantly]</i> I was not alluding to my personal
appearance.</p>

<p>MAGNUS <i>[gravely]</i> Nor was I. Do not deceive yourself, Mr
Boanerges. You are very far from being a plain man. To me you have
always been an Enigma.</p>

<p>BOANERGES <i>[surprised and enormously flattered; he cannot help
smiling with pleasure]</i> Well, perhaps I am a bit of an enigma.
Perhaps I am.</p>

<p>MAGNUS <i>[humbly]</i> I wish I could see through you, Mr Boanerges.
But I have not your sort of cleverness. I can only ask you to be frank
with me.</p>

<p>BOANERGES <i>[now convinced that he has the upper hand]</i> You mean
about the crisis. Well, frank is just what I have come here to be. And
the first thing I am going to tell you frankly about it is that this
country has got to be governed, not by you, but by your ministers.</p>

<p>MAGNUS. I shall be only too grateful to them for taking a very
difficult and thankless job off my hands.</p>

<p>BOANERGES. But it's not on your hands. It's on your ministers'
hands. You are only a constitutional monarch. Do you know what they
call that in Belgium?</p>

<p>MAGNUS. An indiarubber stamp, I think. Am I right?</p>

<p>BOANERGES. You are, King Magnus. An indiarubber stamp. Thats what
you have got to be; and dont you forget it.</p>

<p>MAGNUS. Yes: thats what we are most of the time: both of us.</p>

<p>BOANERGES <i>[outraged]</i> What do you mean? both of us?</p>

<p>MAGNUS. They bring us papers. We sign. You have no time to read
them, luckily for you. But I am expected to read everything. I do not
always agree; but I must sign: there is nothing else to be done. For
instance, death warrants. Not only have I to sign the death warrants of
persons who in my opinion ought not to be killed; but I may not even
issue death warrants for a great many people who in my opinion ought to
be killed.</p>

<p>BOANERGES <i>[sarcastic]</i> Youd like to be able to say "Off with
his head!" wouldnt you?</p>

<p>MAGNUS. Many men would hardly miss their heads, there is so little
in them. Still, killing is a serious business: at least the person who
is to be killed is usually conceited enough to think so. I think that
if there were a question of killing me--</p>

<p>BOANERGES <i>[grimly]</i> There may be, someday. I have heard it
discussed.</p>

<p>MAGNUS. Oh, quite. I have not forgotten King Charles's head. Well, I
hope it will be settled by a living person and not by an indiarubber
stamp.</p>

<p>BOANERGES. It will be settled by the Home Secretary, your duly
constituted democratic minister.</p>

<p>MAGNUS. Another indiarubber stamp, eh?</p>

<p>BOANERGES. At present, perhaps. But not when I am Home Secretary, by
Jingo! Nobody will make an indiarubber stamp of Bill Boanerges: take
that from me.</p>

<p>MAGNUS. Of course not. Is it not curious how people idealize their
rulers? In the old days the king--poor man!--was a god, and was
actually called God and worshipped as infallible and omniscient. That
was monstrous--</p>

<p>BOANERGES. It was silly: just silly.</p>

<p>MAGNUS. But was it half so silly as our pretence that he is an
indiarubber stamp? The ancient Roman emperor-god had not infinite
wisdom, infinite knowledge, infinite power; but he had some: perhaps
even as much as his ministers. He was alive, not dead. What man has
ever approached either a king or a minister and been able to pick him
up from the table and use him as one picks up and uses a piece of wood
and brass and rubber? Permanent officials of your department will try
to pick you up and use you like that. Nineteen times out of twenty you
will have to let them do it, because you cannot know everything; and
even if you could you cannot do everything and be everywhere. But what
about the twentieth time?</p>

<p>BOANERGES. The twentieth time they will find they are up against
Bill Boanerges, eh?</p>

<p>MAGNUS. Precisely. The indiarubber stamp theory will not work, Mr
Boanerges. The old divine theory worked because there is a divine spark
in us all; and the stupidest or worst monarch or minister, if not
wholly god, is a bit of a god--an attempt at a god--however little the
bit and unsuccessful the attempt. But the indiarubber stamp theory
breaks down in every real emergency, because no king or minister is the
very least little bit like a stamp: he is a living soul.</p>

<p>BOANERGES. A soul, eh? You kings still believe in that, I
suppose.</p>

<p>MAGNUS. I find the word convenient: it is short and familiar. But if
you dislike being called a soul, let us say that you are animate matter
as distinguished from inanimate.</p>

<p>BOANERGES <i>[not quite liking this]</i> I think I'd rather you
called me a soul, you know, if you must call me anything at all. I know
I have too much matter about me: the doctor says I ought to knock off a
stone or two; but there's something more to me than beef. Call it a
soul if you like; only not in a superstitious sense, if you understand
me.</p>

<p>MAGNUS. Perfectly. So you see, Mr Boanerges, that though we have
been dealing with one another for less than ten minutes, you have
already led me into an intellectual discussion which shews that we are
something more than a pair of indiarubber stamps. You are up against my
brains, such as they are.</p>

<p>BOANERGES. And you are up against mine.</p>

<p>MAGNUS <i>[gallantly]</i> There can be no doubt of that.</p>

<p>BOANERGES <i>[grinning]</i> Such as they are, eh?</p>

<p>MAGNUS. It is not for me to make that qualification, except in my
own case. Besides, you have given your proofs. No common man could have
risen as you have done. As for me, I am a king because I was the nephew
of my uncle, and because my two elder brothers died. If I had been the
stupidest man in the country I should still be its king. I have not won
my position by my merits. If I had been born as you were in the--in
the--</p>

<p>BOANERGES. In the gutter. Out with it. Picked up by a policeman at
the foot of Captain Coram's statue. Adopted by the policeman's
grandmother, bless her!</p>

<p>MAGNUS. Where should <i>I</i> have been if the policeman had picked
me up?</p>

<p>BOANERGES. Ah! Where? Not, mind you, that you mightnt have done
pretty well for yourself. Youre no fool, Magnus: I will say that for
you.</p>

<p>MAGNUS. You flatter me.</p>

<p>BOANERGES. Flatter a king! Never. Not Bill Boanerges.</p>

<p>MAGNUS. Yes, yes: everybody flatters the King. But everybody has not
your tact, and, may I say? your good nature.</p>

<p>BOANERGES <i>[beaming with self-satisfaction]</i> Perhaps not.
Still, I am a Republican, you know.</p>

<p>MAGNUS. That is what has always surprised me. Do you really think
that any man should have as much personal power as the presidents of
the republican States have? Ambitious kings envy them.</p>

<p>BOANERGES. What's that? I dont follow that.</p>

<p>MAGNUS <i>[smiling]</i> You cannot humbug me, Mr Boanerges. I see
why you are a Republican. If the English people send me packing and
establish a republic, no man has a better chance of being the first
British president than you.</p>

<p>BOANERGES <i>[almost blushing]</i> Oh! I dont say that.</p>

<p>MAGNUS. Come come! You know it as well as I do. Well, if it happens
you will have ten times more power than I have ever had.</p>

<p>BOANERGES <i>[not quite convinced]</i> How can that be? Youre
King.</p>

<p>MAGNUS. And what is the King? An idol set up by a group of
plutocrats so that they can rule the country with the King as their
scapegoat and puppet. Presidents, now, are chosen by the people, who
always want a Strong Man to protect them against the rich.</p>

<p>BOANERGES. Well, speaking as a bit of a Strong Man myself, there may
be something in that. But honestly, Magnus, as man to man, do you tell
me youd rather be a president than what you are?</p>

<p>MAGNUS. By no means. You wouldnt believe me if I did; and you would
be quite right. You see, my security is very comfortable.</p>

<p>BOANERGES. Security, eh? You admitted just now that even a modest
individual like myself had given your throne a shake or two.</p>

<p>MAGNUS. True. You are quite right to remind me of it. I know that
the monarchy may come to an end at any moment. But while the monarchy
lasts--while it lasts, mark you--I am very secure. I escape the
dreadful and demoralizing drudgery of electioneering. I have no voters
to please. Ministers come and ministers go; but I go on for ever. The
terrible precariousness of your position--</p>

<p>BOANERGES. What's that? How is my position precarious?</p>

<p>MAGNUS. The vote may go against you. Yours is a Trade Union seat, is
it not? If the Hydro-Electric Workers Federation throw you over, where
would you be?</p>

<p>BOANERGES <i>[confidently]</i> They wont throw me over. You dont
know the workers, Magnus: you have never been a worker.</p>

<p>MAGNUS <i>[lifts his eyebrows]</i> !</p>

<p>BOANERGES <i>[continuing]</i> No king on earth is as safe in his job
as a Trade Union Official. There is only one thing that can get him
sacked; and that is drink. Not even that, as long as he doesnt actually
fall down. I talk democracy to these men and women. I tell them that
they have the vote, and that theirs is the kingdom and the power and
the glory. I say to them "You are supreme: exercise your power." They
say, "That's right: tell us what to do"; and I tell them. I say
"Exercise your vote intelligently by voting for me." And they do.
That's democracy; and a splendid thing it is too for putting the right
men in the right place.</p>

<p>MAGNUS. Magnificent! I have never heard it better described. You
certainly have a head on you, Mr Boanerges. You should write an essay
on democracy. But--</p>

<p>BOANERGES. But what?</p>

<p>MAGNUS. Suppose a man with a bigger voice comes along! Some fool!
Some windbag! Some upstart with a platform trick of gulling the
multitude!</p>

<p>BOANERGES. Youre thinking of Iky Jacobus? He is only a talker.
<i>[Snapping his fingers]</i> I dont give that for him.</p>

<p>MAGNUS. I never even heard of Mr Jacobus. But why do you say "only a
talker." Talkers are very formidable rivals for popular favor. The
multitude understands talk: it does not understand work. I mean brain
work, like yours and mine.</p>

<p>BOANERGES. That's true. But I can talk Iky's head off.</p>

<p>MAGNUS. Lucky man: you have all the trumps in your hand. But I, who
cannot pretend to your gifts, am very glad that Iky cannot upset me as
long as I am the nephew of my uncle.</p>

<p><i>A young lady, dressed for walking, rushes in impetuously.</i></p>

<p>THE YOUNG LADY. Papa: I cannot find the address--</p>

<p>MAGNUS <i>[cutting her short]</i> No, no, no, dear: not now. Go
away. Dont you see that I am particularly engaged with the President of
the Board of Trade? You must excuse my unruly daughter, Mr Boanerges.
May I present her to you? Alice, my eldest girl. Mr Boanerges,
dear.</p>

<p>ALICE. Oh! Are you the great Mr Boanerges?</p>

<p>BOANERGES <i>[rising in a glow of gratification]</i> Well, I dont
call myself that, you know. But I believe the expression is in use, as
you might say. I am very pleased indeed to make the acquaintance of the
Princess Royal.</p>

<p><i>They shake hands.</i></p>

<p>ALICE. Why do you wear such awful clothes, Mr Boanerges?</p>

<p>MAGNUS <i>[remonstrating]</i> My dear--!</p>

<p>ALICE <i>[continuing]</i> I cant go out walking with you in that
<i>[pointing to his blouse].</i></p>

<p>BOANERGES. The uniform of Labor, your Royal Highness. I'm proud of
it.</p>

<p>ALICE. Oh yes, I know all that, Mr Boanerges. But you dont look the
part, you know. Anyone can see that you belong naturally to the
governing class.</p>

<p>BOANERGES <i>[struck by this view]</i> In a way, perhaps. But I have
earned my bread by my hands. Not as a laborer, though. I am a skilled
mechanic, or was until my country called on me to lead it.</p>

<p>MAGNUS <i>[to Alice]</i> Well, my dear, you have broken up a most
interesting conversation, and to me a most instructive one. It's no use
our trying to go on, Mr Boanerges: I must go and find what my daughter
wants, though I strongly suspect that what she really came in for was
to see my wonderful new minister. We shall meet again presently: you
know that the Prime Minister is calling on me today with some of his
colleagues--including, I hope, yourself--to discuss the crisis.
<i>[Taking Alice's arm and turning towards the door]</i> You will
excuse us, wont you?</p>

<p>BOANERGES <i>[graciously]</i> Oh, thats all right. Thats quite all
right.</p>

<p><i>The King and the Princess go out, apparently much
pleased.</i></p>

<p>BOANERGES <i>[to Sempronius and Pamphilius comprehensively]</i>
Well, say what you will, the King is no fool. Not when you know how to
handle him.</p>

<p>PAMPHILIUS. Of course, that makes all the difference.</p>

<p>BOANERGES. And the girl hasnt been spoilt. I was glad to see that.
She doesnt seem to know that she is the Princess Royal, eh?</p>

<p>SEMPRONIUS. Well, she wouldnt dream of giving herself any airs with
you.</p>

<p>BOANERGES. What! Isnt she always like that?</p>

<p>SEMPRONIUS. Oh no. It's not everybody who is received as you have
been. I hope you have enjoyed your visit.</p>

<p>BOANERGES. Well, I pulled Magnus through it pretty well: eh? Dont
you think so?</p>

<p>SEMPRONIUS. He was pleased. You have a way with him, Mr
President.</p>

<p>BOANERGES. Well, perhaps I have, perhaps I have.</p>

<p><i>A bevy of five Cabinet Ministers, resplendent in diplomatic
uniforms, enters. Proteus the Prime Minister has on his left, Pliny,
Chancellor of the Exchequer, good-humored and conciliatory, and
Nicobar, Foreign Secretary, snaky and censorious. On his right Crassus,
Colonial Secretary, elderly and anxious, and Balbus, Home Secretary,
rude and thoughtless.</i></p>

<p>BALBUS. Holy snakes! look at Bill. <i>[To Boanerges]</i> Go home and
dress yourself properly, man.</p>

<p>NICOBAR. Where do you think you are?</p>

<p>CRASSUS. Who do you think you are?</p>

<p>PLINY <i>[fingering the blouse]</i> Where did you buy it, Bill?</p>

<p>BOANERGES <i>[turning on them like a baited bear]</i> Well, if you
come to that, who do you think you are, the lot of you?</p>

<p>PROTEUS <i>[conciliatory]</i> Never mind them, Bill: theyre jealous
because they didnt think of it themselves. How did you get on with the
King?</p>

<p>BOANERGES. Right as rain, Joe. You leave the King to me. I know how
to handle him. If I'd been in the Cabinet these last three months
there'd have been no crisis.</p>

<p>NICOBAR. He put you through it, did he?</p>

<p>BOANERGES. What do you mean? put me through it? Is this a police
office?</p>

<p>PLINY. The third degree is not unknown in this palace, my boy.
<i>[To Pamphilius]</i> Did the matron take a hand?</p>

<p>PAMPHILIUS. No. But the Princess Alice happened to drop in. She was
greatly impressed by the President.</p>

<p><i>They all laugh uproariously at Boanerges.</i></p>

<p>BOANERGES. What in hell are you laughing at?</p>

<p>PROTEUS. Take no notice of them, Bill: they are only having their
bit of fun with you as a new comer. Come, lads! enough of fooling: lets
get to business. <i>[He takes the chair vacated by the King].</i></p>

<p><i>Sempronius and Pamphilius at once rise and go out busily, taking
some of their papers with them. Pliny takes Boanerges' chair, Balbus
that of Sempronius, Boanerges that of Pamphilius, whilst Nicobar and
Crassus take chairs from the wall and sit down at the ends of the
writing tables, left and right of the Prime Minister
respectively.</i></p>

<p>PROTEUS. Now to start with, do you chaps all fully realize that
though we wiped out every other party at the last election, and have
been in power for the last three years, this country has been governed
during that time by the King?</p>

<p>NICOBAR. I dont see that. We--</p>

<p>PROTEUS <i>[impatiently]</i> Well, if you dont, then for Heaven's
sake either resign and get out of the way of men who can see facts and
look them in the face, or else take my job and lead the party
yourself.</p>

<p>NICOBAR. The worst of you is that you wont face the fact that though
youre Prime Minister youre not God Almighty. The king cant do anything
except what we advise him to do. How can he govern the country if we
have all the power and he has none?</p>

<p>BOANERGES. Dont talk silly, Nick. This indiarubber stamp theory
doesnt work. What man has ever approached a king or a minister and been
able to pick him up from the table and use him as youd use a bit of
wood and brass and rubber? The King's a live man; and what more are
you, with your blessed advice?</p>

<p>PLINY. Hullo, Bill! You have been having your mind improved by
somebody.</p>

<p>BOANERGES. What do you mean? Isnt it what I have always said?</p>

<p>PROTEUS <i>[whose nerves are on edge]</i> Oh, will you stop
squabbling. What are we going to say to the King when he comes in? If
you will only hold together and say the same thing--or let me say
it--he must give way. But he is as artful as the very devil. He'll have
a pin to stick into the seat of every man of you. If you all start
quarrelling and scolding and bawling, which is just what he wants you
to do, it will end in his having his own way as usual, because one man
that has a mind and knows it can always beat ten men who havnt and
dont.</p>

<p>PLINY. Steady, Prime Minister. Youre overwrought.</p>

<p>PROTEUS. It's enough to drive a man mad. I am sorry.</p>

<p>PLINY <i>[changing the subject]</i> Where's Mandy?</p>

<p>NICOBAR. And Lizzie?</p>

<p>PROTEUS. Late as usual. Come! Business, business, business.</p>

<p>BOANERGES <i>[thunderously]</i> Order order!</p>

<p>PROTEUS. The King is working the Press against us. The King is
making speeches. Things have come to a head. He said yesterday on the
opening of the new Chamber of Commerce building that the king's veto is
the only remaining defence of the people against corrupt
legislation.</p>

<p>BOANERGES. So it is, by Jingo. What other defence is there?
Democracy? Yah! We know what Democracy is worth. What we need is a
Strong Man.</p>

<p>NICOBAR <i>[sneering]</i> Yourself for instance.</p>

<p>BOANERGES. I should stand a better chance than you, my lad, if we
were a Republic, and the people could choose. And let me tell you that
a republican president has more power than a king because the people
know that they need a Strong Man to protect them against the rich.</p>

<p>PROTEUS <i>[flinging himself back in his chair in desperation]</i>
This is a nice thing. Two Labor papers have leading articles this
morning supporting the King; and the latest addition to the Cabinet
here is a King's man. I resign.</p>

<p><i>General consternation except on the part of Nicobar, who displays
cheerful unconcern, and of Boanerges, who squares himself with an iron
face.</i></p>

<p>PROTEUS. No use. <i>[Rising]</i> I resign, I tell you. You can all
go to the devil. I have lost my health, and almost lost my reason,
trying to keep this Cabinet together in the face of the cunningest
enemy popular government has ever had to face. I have had enough of it.
<i>[Sitting down again]</i> I resign.</p>

<p>CRASSUS. But not at such a moment as this. Dont let us swop horses
when crossing a stream.</p>

<p>NICOBAR. Why not, if the horse you have got is subject to
hysterics?</p>

<p>BOANERGES. Not to mention that you may have more than one horse at
your disposal.</p>

<p>PROTEUS. Right you are. Perfectly true. Take my job, Nick. It's
vacant for you, Bill. I wish you joy of it.</p>

<p>PLINY. Now boys, boys, boys: be good. We cant make a new Cabinet
before Magnus comes in. You have something in your pocket, Joe. Out
with it. Read it to them.</p>

<p>PROTEUS <i>[taking a paper from his pocket]</i> What I was going to
propose--and you can take it or leave it--is an ultimatum.</p>

<p>CRASSUS. Good!</p>

<p>PROTEUS. Either he signs this, or--<i>[he pauses
significantly]</i>--!</p>

<p>NICOBAR. Or what?</p>

<p>PROTEUS <i>[disgusted]</i> Oh, you make me sick.</p>

<p>NICOBAR. Youre sick already, by your own account. I only ask,
suppose he refuses to sign your ultimatum?</p>

<p>PROTEUS. You call yourself a Cabinet Minister, and you cant answer
that!</p>

<p>NICOBAR. No I cant. I press my question. You said he must sign, OR.
I ask, or what?</p>

<p>PROTEUS. Or we resign and tell the country that we cant carry on the
King's Government under conditions which destroy our
responsibility.</p>

<p>BALBUS. Thatll do it. He couldnt face that.</p>

<p>CRASSUS. Yes: thatll bunker him.</p>

<p>PROTEUS. Is that agreed?</p>

<p>BOANERGES. I retain an open mind. Let us hear the ultimatum.</p>

<p>NICOBAR. Yes: lets hear it.</p>

<p>PROTEUS. Memorandum of understanding arrived at--</p>

<p><i>The King enters, with Amanda, Postmistress General, a merry lady
in uniform like the men, on his left, and Lysistrata, Powermistress
General, a grave lady in academic robes, on his right. All rise. The
Prime Minister's face darkens.</i></p>

<p>MAGNUS. Welcome, gentlemen. I hope I am not too early. <i>[Noting
the Prime Minister's scowl]</i> Am I intruding?</p>

<p>PROTEUS. I protest. It is intolerable. I call a conference of my
Cabinet to consider our position in regard to the prerogative; and I
find the two lady members, the Postmistress General and the
Powermistress General, closeted with your Majesty instead of being in
their places to confer with me.</p>

<p>LYSISTRATA. You mind your own business, Joe.</p>

<p>MAGNUS. Oh no: really, really, my dear Lysistrata, you must not take
that line. Our business is to meddle in everybody's business. A Prime
Minister is a busybody by profession. So is a monarch. So are we
all.</p>

<p>LYSISTRATA. Well, they say everybody's business is nobody's
business, which is just what Joe is fit for. <i>[She takes a chair from
the wall with a powerful hand, and swings it forward to the inside
corner of Sempronius's table, where she stands waiting for the King to
sit down.]</i></p>

<p>PROTEUS. This is what I have to put up with when I am on the verge
of a nervous breakdown <i>[he sits down distractedly, and buries his
face in his hands].</i></p>

<p>AMANDA <i>[going to him and petting him]</i> Come, Joe! dont make a
scene. You asked for it, you know.</p>

<p>NICOBAR. What do you go provoking Lizzie for like that? You know she
has a temper.</p>

<p>LYSISTRATA. There is nothing whatever wrong with my temper. But I am
not going to stand any of Joe's nonsense; and the sooner he makes up
his mind to that the smoother our proceedings are likely to be.</p>

<p>BOANERGES. I protest. I say, let us be dignified. I say, let us
respect ourselves and respect the throne. All this Joe and Bill and
Nick and Lizzie: we might as well be hobnobbing in a fried fish shop.
The Prime Minister is the prime minister: he isnt Joe. The
Powermistress isnt Lizzie: she's Lysis Traitor.</p>

<p>LYSISTRATA <i>[who has evidently been a schoolmistress]</i>
Certainly not, Bill. She is Ly Sistrata. You had better say Lizzie: it
is easier to pronounce.</p>

<p>BOANERGES <i>[scornfully]</i> Ly Sistrata! A more foolish
affectation I never heard: you might as well call me Bo Annerjeeze
<i>[he flings himself into his chair].</i></p>

<p>MAGNUS <i>[sweetly]</i> Shall we sit, ladies and gentlemen!</p>

<p><i>Boanerges hastily rises and sits down again. The King sits in
Pliny's chair. Lysistrata and the rest of the men resume their seats,
leaving Pliny and Amanda standing. Amanda takes an empty chair in each
hand and plants them side by side between the King and the table of
Pamphilius.</i></p>

<p>AMANDA. There you are, Plin. <i>[She sits next the table].</i></p>

<p>PLINY. Ta ta, Mandy. Pardon me: I should have said Amanda. <i>[He
sits next the King].</i></p>

<p>AMANDA. Don't mention it, darling.</p>

<p>BOANERGES. Order, order!</p>

<p>AMANDA <i>[waves him a kiss]</i>!!</p>

<p>MAGNUS. Prime Minister: the word is with you. Why have you all
simultaneously given me the great pleasure of exercising your
constitutional right of access to the sovereign?</p>

<p>LYSISTRATA. Have I that right, sir; or havnt I?</p>

<p>MAGNUS. Most undoubtedly you have.</p>

<p>LYSISTRATA. You hear that, Joe?</p>

<p>PROTEUS. I--</p>

never get anywhere at this rate. Come to the crisis.</p>

<p>BALBUS. The ultimatum. Lets have the ultimatum.</p>

<p>MAGNUS. Oh, there is an ultimatum! I gathered from yesterday's
evening papers that there is a crisis--another crisis. But the
ultimatum is new to me. <i>[To Proteus]</i> Have you an ultimatum?</p>

<p>PROTEUS. Your Majesty's allusion to the royal veto in a speech
yesterday has brought matters to a head.</p>

<p>MAGNUS. It was perhaps indelicate. But you all allude so freely to
your own powers--to the supremacy of Parliament and the voice of the
people and so forth--that I fear I have lost any little delicacy I ever
possessed. If you may flourish your thunderbolts why may I not shoulder
my little popgun of a veto and strut up and down with it for a
moment?</p>

<p>NICOBAR. This is not a subject for jesting--</p>

<p>MAGNUS <i>[interrupting him quickly]</i> I am not jesting, Mr
Nicobar. But I am certainly trying to discuss our differences in a
good-humored manner. Do you wish me to lose my temper and make
scenes?</p>

<p>AMANDA. Oh please no, your Majesty. We get enough of that from
Joe.</p>

<p>PROTEUS. I pro--</p>

<p>MAGNUS <i>[his hand persuasively on the Prime Minister's arm]</i>
Take care, Prime Minister: take care: do not let your wily Postmistress
General provoke you to supply the evidence against yourself.</p>

<p><i>All the rest laugh.</i></p>

<p>PROTEUS <i>[coolly]</i> I thank your Majesty for the caution. The
Postmistress General has never forgiven me for not making her First
Lady of the Admiralty. She has three nephews in the navy.</p>

<p>AMANDA. Oh you--<i>[She swallows the epithet, and contents herself
with shaking her fist at the Premier].</i></p>

<p>MAGNUS. Tch-tch-tch! Gently, Amanda, gently. Three very promising
lads: they do you credit.</p>

<p>AMANDA. I never wanted them to go to sea. I could have found them
better jobs in the Post Office.</p>

<p>MAGNUS. Apart from Amanda's family relations, am I face to face with
a united Cabinet.</p>

<p>PLINY. No, sir. You are face to face with a squabbling Cabinet; but,
on the constitutional question, united we stand: divided we fall.</p>

<p>BALBUS. That is so.</p>

<p>NICOBAR. Hear hear!</p>

<p>MAGNUS. What is the constitutional question? Do you deny the royal
veto? or do you object only to my reminding my subjects of its
existence?</p>

<p>NICOBAR. What we say is that the king has no right to remind his
subjects of anything constitutional except by the advice of the Prime
Minister, and in words which he has read and approved.</p>

<p>MAGNUS. Which Prime Minister? There are so many of them in the
Cabinet.</p>

<p>BOANERGES. There! Serves you all right! Arnt you ashamed of
yourselves? But I am not surprised, Joseph Proteus. I own I like a
Prime Minister that knows how to be a Prime Minister. Why do you let
them take the word out of your mouth every time?</p>

<p>PROTEUS. If His Majesty wants a Cabinet of dumb dogs he will not get
it from my party.</p>

<p>BALBUS. Hear, hear, Joe!</p>

<p>MAGNUS. Heaven forbid! The variety of opinion in the Cabinet is
always most instructive and interesting. Who is to be its spokesman
today?</p>

<p>PROTEUS. I know your Majesty's opinion of me; but let--</p>

<p>MAGNUS <i>[before he can proceed]</i> Let me state it quite frankly.
My opinion of you is that no man knows better than you when to speak
and when to let others speak for you; when to make scenes and threaten
resignation; and when to be as cool as a cucumber.</p>

<p>PROTEUS <i>[not altogether displeased]</i> Well, sir, I hope I am
not such a fool as some fools think me. I may not always keep my
temper. You would not be surprised at that if you knew how much temper
I have to keep. <i>[He straightens up and becomes impressively
eloquent].</i> At this moment my cue is to shew you, not my own temper,
but the temper of my Cabinet. What the Foreign Secretary and the
Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Home Secretary have told you is
true. If we are to carry on your government we cannot have you making
speeches that express your own opinions and not ours. We cannot have
you implying that everything that is of any value in our legislation is
your doing and not ours. We cannot have you telling people that their
only safeguard against the political encroachments of big business
whilst we are doing nothing but bungling and squabbling is your power
of veto. It has got to stop, once for all.</p>

<p>PROTEUS. Is that clear?</p>

<p>MAGNUS. Far clearer than I have ever dared to make it, Mr Proteus.
Except, by the way, on one point. When you say that all this of which
you complain must cease once for all, do you mean that henceforth I am
to agree with you or you with me?</p>

<p>PROTEUS. I mean that when you disagree with us you are to keep your
disagreement to yourself.</p>

<p>MAGNUS. That would be a very heavy responsibility for me. If I see
you leading the nation over the edge of a precipice may I not warn
it?</p>

<p>BALBUS. It is our business to warn it, not yours.</p>

<p>MAGNUS. Suppose you dont do your business! Suppose you dont see the
danger! That has happened. It may happen again.</p>

<p>CRASSUS <i>[insinuating]</i> As democrats, I think we are bound to
proceed on the assumption that such a thing cannot happen.</p>

<p>BOANERGES. Rot! It's happening all the time until somebody has the
gumption to put his foot down and stop it.</p>

<p>CRASSUS. Yes: I know. But that is not democracy.</p>

<p>BOANERGES. Democracy be--<i>[he leaves the word unspoken]</i>! I
have thirty years experience of democracy. So have most of you. I say
no more.</p>

<p>BALBUS. Wages are too high, if you ask me. Anybody can earn from
five to twenty pounds a week now, and a big dole when there is no job
for him. And what Englishman will give his mind to politics as long as
he can afford to keep a motor car?</p>

<p>NICOBAR. How many voted at the last election? Not seven per cent of
the register.</p>

<p>BALBUS. Yes; and the seven per cent were only a parcel of sillies
playing at ins and outs. To make democracy work in Crassus's way we
need poverty and hardship.</p>

<p>PROTEUS <i>[emphatically]</i> And we have abolished poverty and
hardship. That is why the people trust us. <i>[To the King]</i> And
that is why you will have to give way to us. We have the people of
England in comfort--solid middle class comfort--at our backs.</p>

<p>MAGNUS. No: we have not abolished poverty and hardship. Our big
business men have abolished them. But how? By sending our capital
abroad to places where poverty and hardship still exist: in other
words, where labor is cheap. We live in comfort on the imported profits
of that capital. We are all ladies and gentlemen now.</p>

<p>NICOBAR. Well, what more do you want?</p>

<p>PLINY. You surely dont grudge us our wonderful prosperity, sir.</p>

<p>MAGNUS. I want it to last.</p>

<p>NICOBAR. Why shouldnt it last? <i>[Rising]</i> Own the truth. You
had rather have the people poor, and pose as their champion and savior,
than have to admit that the people are better off under our
government--under our squabbling and bungling, as you call it.</p>

<p>MAGNUS. No: it was the Prime Minister who used those
expressions.</p>

<p>NICOBAR. Dont quibble: he was quoting them from your reptile press.
What I say is that we stand for high wages, and you are always
belittling and opposing the men that pay them. Well, the voters like
high wages. They know when they are well off; and they dont know what
you are grumbling about; and thats what will beat you every time you
try to stir them against us <i>[he resumes his seat].</i></p>

<p>PLINY. There is no need to rub it in like that, Nick. We're all good
friends. Nobody objects to prosperity.</p>

<p>MAGNUS. You think this prosperity is safe?</p>

<p>NICOBAR. Safe!</p>

<p>PLINY. Oh come, sir! Really!</p>

<p>BALBUS. Safe! Look at my constituency: Northeast-by-north
Birmingham, with its four square miles of confectionery works! Do you
know that in the Christmas cracker trade Birmingham is the workshop of
the world?</p>

<p>CRASSUS. Take Gateshead and Middlesbrough alone! Do you know that
there has not been a day's unemployment there for five years past, and
that their daily output of chocolate creams totals up to twenty
thousand tons?</p>

<p>MAGNUS. It is certainly a consoling thought that if we were
peacefully blockaded by the League of Nations we could live for at
least three weeks on our chocolate creams.</p>

<p>NICOBAR. You neednt sneer at the sweets: we turn out plenty of solid
stuff. Where will you find the equal of the English golf club?</p>

<p>BALBUS. Look at the potteries: the new crown Derby! the new Chelsea!
Look at the tapestries! Why, Greenwich Goblin has chased the French
stuff out of the market.</p>

<p>CRASSUS. Dont forget our racing motor boats and cars, sir: the
finest on earth, and all individually designed. No cheap mass
production stuff there.</p>

<p>PLINY. And our live stock! Can you beat the English polo pony?</p>

<p>AMANDA. Or the English parlormaid? She wins in all the international
beauty shows.</p>

<p>PLINY. Now Mandy, Mandy! None of your triviality.</p>

<p>MAGNUS. I am not sure that the British parlormaid is not the only
real asset in your balance sheet.</p>

<p>AMANDA <i>[triumphant]</i> Aha! <i>[To Pliny]</i> You go home to bed
and reflect on that, old man.</p>

<p>PROTEUS. Well, sir? Are you satisfied that we have the best paid
proletariat in the world on our side?</p>

<p>MAGNUS <i>[gravely]</i> I dread revolution.</p>

<p><i>All except the two women laugh uproariously at this.</i></p>

<p>BOANERGES. I must join them there, sir. I am as much against
chocolate creams as you are: they never agree with me. But a revolution
in England!!! Put that out of your head, sir. Not if you were to tear
up Magna Carta in Trafalgar Square, and light the fires of Smithfield
to burn every member of the House of Commons.</p>

<p>MAGNUS. I was not thinking of a revolution in England. I was
thinking of the countries on whose tribute we are living. Suppose it
occurs to them to stop paying it! That has happened before.</p>

<p>PLINY. Oh no, sir: no, no, no. What would become of their foreign
trade with us?</p>

<p>MAGNUS. At a pinch, I think they could do without the Christmas
crackers.</p>

<p>CRASSUS. Oh, thats childish.</p>

<p>MAGNUS. Children in their innocence are sometimes very practical, Mr
Colonial Secretary. The more I see of the sort of prosperity that comes
of your leaving our vital industries to big business men as long as
they keep your constituents quiet with high wages, the more I feel as
if I were sitting on a volcano.</p>

<p>LYSISTRATA <i>[who has been listening with implacable contempt to
the discussion, suddenly breaks in in a sepulchral contralto]</i> Hear
hear! My department was perfectly able and ready to deal with the
supply of power from the tides in the north of Scotland, and you gave
it away, like the boobs you are, to the Pentland Firth Syndicate: a
gang of foreign capitalists who will make billions out of it at the
people's expense while we are bungling and squabbling. Crassus worked
that. His uncle is chairman.</p>

<p>CRASSUS. A lie. A flat lie. He is not related to me. He is only my
stepson's father-in-law.</p>

<p>BALBUS. I demand an explanation of the words bungling and
squabbling. We have had quite enough of them here today. Who are you
getting at? It was not I who bungled the Factory Bill. I found it on my
desk when I took office, with all His Majesty's suggestions in the
margin<i>;</i> and you know it.</p>

<p>PROTEUS. Have you all done playing straight into His Majesty's hand,
and making my situation here impossible?</p>

<p><i>Guilty silence.</i></p>

<p>PROTEUS <i>[proceeding deliberately and authoritatively]</i> The
question before us is not one of our manners and our abilities. His
Majesty will not press that question, because if he did he would oblige
us to raise the question of his own morals.</p>

<p>MAGNUS <i>[starts]</i> What!</p>

<p>BALBUS. Good, Joe!</p>

<p>CRASSUS <i>[aside to Amanda]</i> Thats got him.</p>

<p>MAGNUS. Am I to take that threat seriously, Mr Proteus?</p>

<p>PROTEUS. If you try to prejudice what is a purely constitutional
question by personal scandal, it will be easy enough for us to throw
your mud back. In this conflict we are the challengers. You have the
choice of weapons. If you choose scandal, we'll take you on at that.
Personally I shall deplore it if you do. No good will come of washing
our dirty linen in public. But dont make any mistake as to what will
happen. I will be plain with you: I will dot the Is and cross the Ts.
You will say that Crassus is a jobber.</p>

<p>CRASSUS <i>[springing up]</i> I--</p>

<p>PROTEUS <i>[fiercely crushing him]</i> Sit down. Leave this to
me.</p>

<p>CRASSUS <i>[sits]</i> I a jobber! Well!</p>

<p>PROTEUS <i>[continuing]</i> You will say that I should never have
given the Home Office to a bully like Balbus--</p>

<p>BALBUS <i>[intimidated by the fate of Crassus, but unable to forbear
a protest]</i> Look here, Joe--</p>

<p>PROTEUS. You shut up, Bert. It's true.</p>

<p>BALBUS <i>[subsides with a shrug]!</i></p>

<p>PROTEUS. Well, what will happen? There will be no denials, no
excuses, no vindications. We shall not fall into that trap, clever as
you are at setting it. Crassus will say just simply that you are a
freethinker. And Balbus will say that you are a libertine.</p>

<p>THE MALE CABINET <i>[below their breaths]</i> Aha-a-a-a-h!!!</p>

<p>PROTEUS. Now, King Magnus! Our cards are on the table. What have you
to say?</p>

<p>MAGNUS. Admirably put! People ask how it is that with all these
strong characters around you hold your own as the only possible Prime
Minister, in spite of your hysterics and tantrums, your secretiveness
and your appalling laziness--</p>

<p>BALBUS <i>[delighted]</i> Hear hear! Youre getting it now, Joe.</p>

<p>MAGNUS <i>[continuing]</i> But when the decisive moment comes, they
find out what a wonderful man you are.</p>

<p>PROTEUS. I am not a wonderful man. There is not a man or woman here
whose job I could do as well as they do it. I am Prime Minister for the
same reason that all Prime Ministers have been Prime Ministers: because
I am good for nothing else. But I can keep to the point--when it suits
me. And I can keep you to the point, sir, whether it suits you or
not.</p>

<p>MAGNUS. At all events you do not flatter kings. One of them, at
least, is grateful to you for that.</p>

<p>PROTEUS. Kings, as you and I very well know, rule their ministers by
flattering them; and now that you are the only king left in the
civilized half of Europe Nature seems to have concentrated in you all
the genius for flattery that she used to have to divide between half a
dozen kings, three emperors, and a Sultan.</p>

<p>MAGNUS. But what interest has a king in flattering a subject?</p>

<p>AMANDA. Suppose she's a goodlooking woman, sir!</p>

<p>NICOBAR. Suppose he has a lot of money, and the king's hard up!</p>

<p>PROTEUS. Suppose he is a Prime Minister, and you can do nothing
except by his advice.</p>

<p>MAGNUS <i>[smiling with his utmost charm]</i> Ah, there you have hit
the nail on the head. Well, I suppose I must surrender. I am beaten.
You are all too clever for me.</p>

<p>BOANERGES. Well, nothing can be fairer than that.</p>

<p>PLINY <i>[rubbing his hands]</i> You are a gentleman, sir. We shant
rub it in, you know.</p>

<p>BALBUS. Ever the best of friends. I am the last to kick a man when
he's down.</p>

<p>CRASSUS. I may be a jobber; but nobody shall say that I am an
ungenerous opponent.</p>

<p>BOANERGES <i>[suddenly overwhelmed with emotion, rises and begins
singing in stentorian tones]</i></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Should auld acquaintance be forgot,<br>
 And never brought to mind--</p>
</blockquote>

<p><i>Amanda bursts into uncontrollable laughter. The King looks
reproachfully at her, struggling hard to keep his countenance. The
others are beginning to join in the chorus when Proteus rises in a
fury.</i></p>

<p>PROTEUS. Are you all drunk?</p>

<p><i>Dead silence. Boanerges sits down hastily. The other singers
pretend that they have disapproved of his minstrelsy.</i></p>

<p>PROTEUS. You are at present engaged in a tug of war with the King:
the tug of your lives. You think you have won. You havnt. All that has
happened is that the King has let go the rope. You are sprawling on
your backs; and he is laughing at you. Look at him! <i>[He sits down
contemptuously].</i></p>

<p>MAGNUS <i>[making no further attempt to conceal his merriment]</i>
Come to my rescue, Amanda. It was you who set me off.</p>

<p>AMANDA <i>[wreathed with smiles]</i> You got me so nicely, sir.
<i>[To Boanerges]</i> Bill: you are a great boob.</p>

<p>BOANERGES. I dont understand this, I understood His Majesty to give
way to us in, I must say, the handsomest manner. Cant we take our
victory like gentlemen?</p>

<p>MAGNUS. Perhaps I had better explain. I quite appreciate the frank
and magnanimous spirit--may I say the English spirit?--in which my
little concession has been received, especially by you, Mr Boanerges.
But in truth it leaves matters just where they were; for I should never
have dreamt of entering on a campaign of recrimination such as the
Prime Minister suggested. As he has reminded you, my own character is
far too vulnerable. A king is not allowed the luxury of a good
character. Our country has produced millions of blameless greengrocers,
but not one blameless monarch. I have to rule over more religious sects
than I can count. To rule them impartially I must not belong to any of
them; and they all regard people who do not belong to them as atheists.
My court includes several perfectly respectable wives and mothers whose
strange vanity it is to be talked about as abandoned females. To gain
the reputation of being the king's mistress they would do almost
anything except give the unfortunate monarch the pleasure of
substantiating their claim. Side by side with them are the ladies who
are really unscrupulous. They are so careful of their reputations that
they lose no opportunity of indignantly denying that they have ever
yielded to solicitations which have in fact never been made to them.
Thus every king is supposed to be a libertine; and as, oddly enough, he
owes a great part of his popularity to this belief, he cannot deny it
without deeply disappointing his subjects.</p>

<p><i>There is a rather grim silence, during which the King looks round
in vain for some encouraging response.</i></p>

<p>LYSISTRATA <i>[severely]</i> Your Majesty's private affairs do not
concern us, in any case.</p>

<p>AMANDA <i>[splutters into an irrepressible laugh]</i>!!</p>

<p>MAGNUS <i>[looks reproachfully at Amanda]</i>!</p>

<p>AMANDA <i>[composing her features as best she can]</i> Excuse
me.</p>

<p>CRASSUS. I hope your Majesty recognizes that kings are not the only
people to whom certain sorts of mud always stick, no matter what fool
throws them. Call a minister a jobber--</p>

<p>BALBUS. Or a bungler.</p>

<p>CRASSUS. Yes, or a bungler, and everybody believes it. Jobbery and
incompetence are the two sorts of mud that stick to us, no matter how
honest or capable we are; and we havnt the royal vantage that you
enjoy, that the more the ladies take away your character the better the
people like you.</p>

<p>BOANERGES <i>[suddenly]</i> Prime Minister: will you tell me what
the Postmistress General is sniggering at?</p>

<p>AMANDA. This a free country, Bill. A sense of humor is not a crime.
And when the King is not setting me off, you are.</p>

<p>BOANERGES. Where is the joke? I dont see it.</p>

<p>AMANDA. If you could see a joke, Bill, you wouldnt be the great
popular orator you are.</p>

<p>BOANERGES. Thank Heaven, I am not a silly giggler like some I could
mention.</p>

<p>AMANDA. Thanks, dearest Bill. Now, Joe: dont you think you have let
us run loose long enough? What about that ultimatum?</p>

<p>MAGNUS <i>[shaking his head at her]</i> Traitor!</p>

<p>PROTEUS. I am in no hurry. His Majesty's speeches are very wise and
interesting; and your back chat amuses both you and him. But the
ultimatum is here all the time; and I shall not leave this room until I
have His Majesty's signed pledge that its conditions will be
observed.</p>

<p><i>All become gravely attentive.</i></p>

<p>MAGNUS. What are its terms?</p>

<p>PROTEUS. First, no more royal speeches.</p>

<p>MAGNUS. What! Not even if you dictate them?</p>

<p>PROTEUS. Not even if we dictate them. Your Majesty has a way of
unrolling the manuscript and winking--</p>

<p>MAGNUS. Winking!</p>

<p>PROTEUS. You know what I mean. The best speech in the world can be
read in such a way as to set the audience laughing at it. We have had
enough of that. So, in future, no speeches.</p>

<p>MAGNUS. A dumb king?</p>

<p>PROTEUS. Of course we cannot object to such speeches as "We declare
this foundation stone well and truly laid" and so forth. But
politically, yes: a dumb king.</p>

<p>PLINY <i>[to soften it]</i> A constitutional king.</p>

<p>PROTEUS <i>[implacably]</i> A dumb king.</p>

<p>MAGNUS. Hm! What next?</p>

<p>PROTEUS. The working of the Press from the palace back stairs must
cease.</p>

<p>MAGNUS. You know that I have no control of the Press. The Press is
in the hands of men much richer than I, who would not insert a single
paragraph against their own interests even if it were signed by my own
hand and sent to them with a royal command.</p>

<p>PROTEUS. We know that. But though these men are richer than you,
they are not cleverer. They get amusing articles, spiced with exclusive
backstairs information, that dont seem to them to have anything to do
with politics. The next thing they know is that their pet shares have
dropped fifteen points; that capital is frightened off their best
prospectuses; and that some of the best measures in our party program
are made to look like city jobs.</p>

<p>MAGNUS. Am I supposed to write these articles?</p>

<p>NICOBAR. Your man Sempronius does. I can spot his fist out of fifty
columns.</p>

<p>CRASSUS. So can I. When he is getting at me he always begins the
sentence with "Singularly enough."</p>

<p>PLINY <i>[chuckling]</i> Thats his trademark. "Singularly enough."
Ha! ha!</p>

<p>MAGNUS. Is there to be any restriction on the other side? I have
noticed, for instance, that in a certain newspaper which loses no
opportunity of disparaging the throne, the last sentence of the leading
article almost invariably begins with the words "Once for all." Whose
trademark is that?</p>

<p>PROTEUS. Mine.</p>

<p>MAGNUS. Frank, Mr Proteus.</p>

<p>PROTEUS. I know when to be frank. I learnt the trick from Your
Majesty.</p>

<p>AMANDA <i>[tries not to laugh]</i>!</p>

<p>MAGNUS <i>[gently reproachful]</i> Amanda: what is the joke now? I
am surprised at you.</p>

<p>AMANDA. Joe frank! When I want to find out what he is up to I have
to come and ask your Majesty.</p>

<p>LYSISTRATA. That is perfectly true. In this Cabinet there is no such
thing as a policy. Every man plays for his own hand.</p>

<p>NICOBAR. It's like a game of cards.</p>

<p>BALBUS. Only there are no partners.</p>

<p>LYSISTRATA. Except Crassus and Nicobar.</p>

<p>PLINY. Good, Lizzie! He! he! he!</p>

<p>NICOBAR. What do you mean?</p>

<p>LYSISTRATA. You know quite well what I mean. When will you learn,
Nicobar, that it is no use trying to browbeat me. I began life as a
schoolmistress<i>;</i> and I can browbeat any man in this Cabinet or
out of it if he is fool enough to try to compete with me in that
department.</p>

<p>BOANERGES. Order! order! Cannot the Prime Minister check these
unseemly personalities?</p>

<p>PROTEUS. They give me time to think, Bill. When you have had as much
parliamentary experience as I have you will be very glad of an
interruption occasionally. May I proceed?</p>

<p><i>Silence.</i></p>

<p>PROTEUS. His Majesty asks whether the restriction on press
campaigning is to be entirely onesided. That, I take it, sir, is your
question.</p>

<p>MAGNUS <i>[nods assent]</i>!</p>

<p>PROTEUS. The answer is in the affirmative.</p>

<p>BALBUS. Good!</p>

<p>MAGNUS. Anything more?</p>

<p>PROTEUS. Yes: one thing more. The veto must not be mentioned again.
That can apply to both sides, if you like. The veto is dead.</p>

<p>MAGNUS. May we not make a historical reference to the corpse?</p>

<p>PROTEUS. No. I cannot carry on the King's government unless I can
give pledges and carry them out. What is my pledge worth if our
constituents are reminded every day that the King may veto anything
that Parliament does? Do you expect me to say, when I am asked for a
pledge, "You must ask the King"?</p>

<p>MAGNUS. I have to say "You must ask the Prime Minister."</p>

<p>PLINY <i>[consoling him]</i> Thats the constitution, you know.</p>

<p>MAGNUS. Quite. I only mention it to shew that the Prime Minister
does not really wish to kill the veto. He only wishes to move it next
door.</p>

<p>PROTEUS. The people live next door. The name on the brass plate is
Public Opinion.</p>

<p>MAGNUS <i>[gravely]</i> Admirably turned, Mr Prime Minister; but
unreal. I am far more subject to public opinion than you, because,
thanks to the general belief in democracy, you can always pretend that
what you do is done by the will of the people, who, God knows, never
dreamt of it, and would not have understood it if they had; whereas,
for what a king does, he, and he alone, is held responsible. A
demagogue may steal a horse where a king dare not look over a
hedge.</p>

<p>LYSISTRATA. I doubt if that is any longer true, sir. I know that I
get blamed for everything that goes wrong in my department.</p>

<p>MAGNUS. Ah! But what a despot you are, Lysistrata! Granted, however,
that the people have found out long ago that democracy is humbug, and
that instead of establishing responsible government it has abolished
it, do you not see what this means?</p>

<p>BOANERGES <i>[scandalized]</i> Steady, steady! I cannot sit here and
listen to such a word as humbug being applied to democracy. I am sorry,
sir; but with all respect for you, I really must draw the line at
that.</p>

<p>MAGNUS. You are right, Mr Boanerges, as you always are. Democracy is
a very real thing, with much less humbug about it than many older
institutions. But it means, not that the people govern, but that the
responsibility and the veto now belong neither to kings nor demagogues
as such, but to whoever is clever enough to get them.</p>

<p>LYSISTRATA. Yourself, sir, for example?</p>

<p>MAGNUS. I think I am in the running. That is why I do not feel bound
to accept this ultimatum. By signing it I put myself out of the
running. Why should I?</p>

<p>BALBUS. Because youre the king: thats why.</p>

<p>MAGNUS. Does it follow?</p>

<p>PROTEUS. If two men ride the same horse, one must ride behind.</p>

<p>LYSISTRATA. Which?</p>

<p>PROTEUS <i>[turning to her sharply]</i> What was that you said?</p>

<p>LYSISTRATA <i>[with placid but formidable obstinacy and ironical
explicitness]</i> I said Which? You said that if two men rode the same
horse one of them must ride behind. I said Which?
<i>[Explanatorily]</i> Which man must ride behind?</p>

<p>AMANDA. Got it, Joe?</p>

<p>PROTEUS. That is exactly the question that has to be settled here
and now.</p>

<p>AMANDA. "Once for all."</p>

<p><i>Everybody laughs except Proteus, who rises in a fury.</i></p>

<p>PROTEUS. I will not stand this perpetual tomfooling. I had rather be
a dog than the Prime Minister of a country where the only things the
inhabitants can be serious about are football and refreshments. Lick
the King's boots: that is all you are fit for. <i>[He dashes out of the
room].</i></p>

<p>BALBUS. Youve done it now, Mandy. I hope youre proud of
yourself.</p>

<p>MAGNUS. It is you, Amanda, who should go and coax him back. But I
suppose I must do it myself, as usual. Excuse me, ladies and
gentlemen.</p>

<p><i>He rises. The rest rise. He goes out.</i></p>

<p>BOANERGES. I told you. I told you what would come of conducting a
conference with His Majesty as if it were a smoking concert. I am
disgusted. <i>[He flings himself back into his chair].</i></p>

<p>BALBUS. We'd just cornered the old fox; and then Amanda must have
her silly laugh and lets him out of it <i>[he sits].</i></p>

<p>NICOBAR. What are we to do now? thats what I want to know.</p>

<p>AMANDA <i>[incorrigible]</i> I suggest a little community singing
<i>[she makes conductorlike gestures].</i></p>

<p>NICOBAR. Yah!! <i>[he sits down very sulkily].</i></p>

<p>AMANDA <i>[sits down with a little splutter of laughter]</i>!</p>

<p>CRASSUS <i>[thoughtful]</i> Take it easy, friends. Joe knows what he
is about.</p>

<p>LYSISTRATA. Of course he does. I can excuse you, Bill, because it's
your first day in the Cabinet. But if the rest of you havnt found out
by this time that Joe's rages are invariably calculated, then nothing
will ever teach you anything <i>[she sits down contemptuously].</i></p>

<p>BOANERGES <i>[in his grandest manner]</i> Well, madam, I know I am a
newcomer: everything must have a beginning. I am open to argument and
conviction. The Prime Minister brought this conference, in what I admit
was a very able and resolute manner, to the verge of a decision. Then,
in a fit of childish temper he breaks up the conference, leaving us
looking like fools with nothing done. And you tell me he did it on
purpose! Where was the advantage to him in such a display? answer me
that.</p>

<p>LYSISTRATA. He is settling the whole business with the King behind
our backs. That is what Joe always contrives to do, by hook or
crook.</p>

<p>PLINY. You didnt arrange it with him, Mandy: did you?</p>

<p>AMANDA. There wasnt any need to arrange it. Joe can always depend on
one or other of us saying something that will give him an excuse for
flying out.</p>

<p>CRASSUS. In my opinion, ladies and gentlemen, we have done our bit,
and may leave the rest to Joe. Matters had reached a point at which it
was yes or no between the Cabinet and the Crown. There is only one sort
of committee that is better than a committee of two; and that is a
committee of one. Like the family in Wordsworth's poem, we are
seven--</p>

<p>LYSISTRATA. Eight.</p>

<p>CRASSUS. Well, seven or eight, we were too many for the final
grapple. Two persons sticking to the point are worth eight all over the
shop. So my advice is that we just sit here quietly until Joe comes
back and tells us whats been settled. Perhaps Amanda will oblige with a
song. <i>[He resumes his seat].</i></p>

<p><i>The King returns with Proteus, who looks glum. All rise. The two
resume their seats in silence. The rest sit down.</i></p>

<p>MAGNUS <i>[very grave]</i> The Prime Minister has been good enough
to pursue the discussion with me in private to a point at which the
issue is now clear. If I do not accept the ultimatum I shall receive
your resignations and his; and the country will learn from his
explanatory speech in the House of Commons that it is to choose between
Cabinet government and monarchical government: an issue on which I
frankly say that I should be very sorry to win, as I cannot carry on
without the support of a body of ministers whose existence gives the
English people a sensation of self-government.</p>

<p>AMANDA <i>[splutters]</i>!</p>

<p>CRASSUS <i>[whispers]</i> Shut up, will you?</p>

<p>MAGNUS <i>[continuing]</i> Naturally I want to avert a conflict in
which success would damage me and failure disable me. But you tell me
that I can do so only by signing pledges which would make me a mere
Lord Chamberlain, without even the despotism which he exercises over
the theatre. I should sink below the level of the meanest of my
subjects, my sole privilege being that of being shot at when some
victim of misgovernment resorts to assassination to avenge himself. How
am I to defend myself? You are many: I oppose you single-handed. There
was a time when the king could depend on the support of the aristocracy
and the cultivated bourgeoisie. Today there is not a single aristocrat
left in politics, not a single member of the professions, not a single
leading personage in big business or finance. They are richer than
ever, more powerful than ever, more able and better educated than ever.
But not one of them will touch this drudgery of government, this public
work that never ends because we cannot finish one job without creating
ten fresh ones. We get no thanks for it because ninety-nine hundredths
of it is unknown to the people, and the remaining hundredth is resented
by them as an invasion of their liberty or an increase in their
taxation. It wears out the strongest man, and even the strongest woman,
in five or six years. It slows down to nothing when we are fresh from
our holidays and best able to bear it, and rises in an overwhelming
wave through some unforeseen catastrophe when we are on the verge of
nervous breakdown from overwork and fit for rest and sleep only. And
this drudgery, remember, is a sweated trade, the only one now left in
this country. My civil list leaves me a poor man among
multi-millionaires. Your salaries can be earned ten times over in the
city by anyone with outstanding organizing or administrative ability.
History tells us that the first Lord Chancellor who abandoned the
woolsack for the city boardroom struck the nation with amazement: today
the nation would be equally amazed if a man of his ability thought it
worth his while to prefer the woolsack even to the stool of an office
boy as a jumping-off place for his ambition. Our work is no longer even
respected. It is looked down on by our men of genius as dirty work.
What great actor would exchange his stage? what great barrister his
court? what great preacher his pulpit? for the squalor of the political
arena in which we have to struggle with foolish factions in parliament
and with ignorant voters in the constituencies? The scientists will
have nothing to do with us; for the atmosphere of politics is not the
atmosphere of science. Even political science, the science by which
civilization must live or die, is busy explaining the past whilst we
have to grapple with the present: it leaves the ground before our feet
in black darkness whilst it lights up every corner of the landscape
behind us. All the talent and genius of the country is bought up by the
flood of unearned money. On that poisoned wealth talent and genius live
far more luxuriously in the service of the rich than we in the service
of our country. Politics, once the centre of attraction for ability,
public spirit, and ambition, has now become the refuge of a few
fanciers of public speaking and party intrigue who find all the other
avenues to distinction closed to them either by their lack of practical
ability, their comparative poverty and lack of education, or, let me
hasten to add, their hatred of oppression and injustice, and their
contempt for the chicaneries and false pretences of commercialized
professionalism. History tells us of a gentleman-statesman who declared
that such people were not fit to govern. Within a year it was
discovered that they could govern at least as well as anyone else who
could be persuaded to take on the job. Then began that abandonment of
politics by the old governing class which has ended in all Cabinets,
conservative no less than progressive, being what were called in the
days of that rash statesman Labor Cabinets. Do not misunderstand me: I
do not want the old governing class back. It governed so selfishly that
the people would have perished if democracy had not swept it out of
politics. But evil as it was in many ways, at least it stood above the
tyranny of popular ignorance and popular poverty. Today only the king
stands above that tyranny. You are dangerously subject to it. In spite
of my urgings and remonstrances you have not yet dared to take command
of our schools and put a stop to the inculcation upon your unfortunate
children of superstitions and prejudices that stand like stone walls
across every forward path. Are you well advised in trying to reduce me
to your own slavery to them? If I do not stand above them there is no
longer any reason for my existence at all. I stand for the future and
the past, for the posterity that has no vote and the tradition that
never had any. I stand for the great abstractions: for conscience and
virtue; for the eternal against the expedient; for the evolutionary
appetite against the day's gluttony; for intellectual integrity, for
humanity, for the rescue of industry from commercialism and of science
from professionalism, for everything that you desire as sincerely as I,
but which in you is held in leash by the Press, which can organize
against you the ignorance and superstition, the timidity and credulity,
the gullibility and prudery, the hating and hunting instinct of the
voting mob, and cast you down from power if you utter a word to alarm
or displease the adventurers who have the Press in their pockets.
Between you and that tyranny stands the throne. I have no elections to
fear; and if any newspaper magnate dares offend me, that magnate's
fashionable wife and marriageable daughters will soon make him
understand that the King's displeasure is still a sentence of social
death within range of St James's Palace. Think of the things you dare
not do! the persons you dare not offend! Well, a king with a little
courage may tackle them for you. Responsibilities which would break
your backs may still be borne on a king's shoulders. But he must be a
king, not a puppet. You would be responsible for a puppet: remember
that. But whilst you continue to support me as a separate and
independent estate of the realm, I am your scapegoat: you get the
credit of all our popular legislation whilst you put the odium of all
our resistance to ignorant popular clamor on me. I ask you, before you
play your last card and destroy me, to consider where you will be
without me. Think once: think twice: for your danger is, not that I may
defeat you, but that your success is certain if you insist.</p>

<p>LYSISTRATA. Splendid!</p>

<p>AMANDA. You did speak that piece beautifully, sir.</p>

<p>BALBUS <i>[grumbling]</i> All very well; but what about my
brother-in-law Mike?</p>

<p>LYSISTRATA <i>[maddened]</i> Oh, confound your brother-in-law
Mike!</p>

<p>BOANERGES. Order! order!</p>

<p>LYSISTRATA <i>[to the King]</i> I beg your pardon, sir; but
really--at a moment like this--<i>[words fail her].</i></p>

<p>MAGNUS <i>[to Balbus]</i> If I had not put my foot down, Mr Balbus,
the Prime Minister would have been unable to keep your brother-in-law
out of the Cabinet.</p>

<p>BALBUS <i>[aggressively]</i> And why should he not be in the
Cabinet?</p>

<p>AMANDA. Booze, my Balby: booze. Raising the elbow!</p>

<p>BALBUS <i>[bullying]</i> Who says so?</p>

<p>AMANDA. I do, darling.</p>

<p>BALBUS <i>[subsiding]</i> Well, perhaps it would surprise you all to
know that Mike doesnt drink as much as I do.</p>

<p>AMANDA. You carry it better, Bert.</p>

<p>PLINY. Mike never knows when to stop.</p>

<p>CRASSUS. The time for Mike to stop is before he begins, if you ask
me.</p>

<p>LYSISTRATA <i>[impetuously]</i> What sort of animals are you--you
men? The King puts before us the most serious question of principle we
shall ever have to deal with; and off you start discussing whether this
drunken wretch takes honest whisky like Balbus or methylated spirit or
petrol or whatever he can lay his hands on when the fit takes him.</p>

<p>BALBUS. I agree with that. What does it matter what Mike drinks?
What does it matter whether he drinks or not? Mike would strengthen the
Cabinet because he represents Breakages, Limited, the biggest
industrial corporation in the country.</p>

<p>LYSISTRATA <i>[letting herself go]</i> Just so! Breakages, Limited!
just so! Listen to me, sir; and judge whether I have not reason to feel
everything you have just said to the very marrow of my bones. Here am
I, the Powermistress Royal. I have to organize and administer all the
motor power in the country for the good of the country. I have to
harness the winds and the tides, the oils and the coal seams. I have to
see that every little sewing machine in the Hebrides, every dentist's
drill in Shetland, every carpet sweeper in Margate, has its stream of
driving power on tap from a switch in the wall as punctually as the
great thundering dynamos of our big industrial plants. I do it; but it
costs twice as much as it should. Why? Because every new invention is
bought up and suppressed by Breakages, Limited. Every breakdown, every
accident, every smash and crash, is a job for them. But for them we
should have unbreakable glass, unbreakable steel, imperishable
materials of all sorts. But for them our goods trains could be started
and stopped without battering and tearing the vitals out of every wagon
and sending it to their repair shops once a week instead of once a
year. Our national repair bill runs up to hundreds of millions. I could
name you a dozen inventions within my own term of office which would
have effected enormous economies in breakages and breakdowns; but these
people can afford to pay an inventor more for his machine or his
process or whatever it may be than he could hope to make by a
legitimate use of it; and when they have bought it they smother it.
When the inventor is poor and not good at defending himself they make
bogus trials of his machine and report that it is no use. I have been
shot at twice by inventors driven crazy by this sort of thing: they
blamed me for it--as if I could stand up against this monster with its
millions and its newspapers and its fingers in every pie. It is
heartbreaking. I love my department: I dream of nothing but its
efficiency: with me it comes before every personal tie, every happiness
that common women run after. I would give my right hand to see these
people in the bankruptcy court with half their business abolished and
the other half done in public workshops where public losses are not
private gains. You stand for that, sir; and I would be with you to the
last drop of my blood if I dared. But what can I do? If I said one word
of this in public, not a week would pass in the next two years without
an article on the inefficiency and corruption of all Government
departments, especially departments managed, like mine, by females.
They would dig up the very machines they have buried, and make out that
it is my fault that they have never been brought into use. They would
set their private police to watch me day and night to get something
against my private character. One of their directors told me to my face
that by lifting up his finger he could get my windows broken by the
mob; and that Breakages, Limited, would get the job of putting in new
glass. And it is true. It is infamous; it is outrageous; but if I
attempt to fight them I shall be hounded out of public life, and they
will shove Mouldly Mike into the Cabinet to run my department in their
interests: that is, to make such a failure of it that Joe will have to
sell it to Breakages, Limited, at scrap iron prices. I--I--oh, it is
beyond bearing <i>[she breaks down].</i></p>

<p><i>There is a troubled silence for a moment. Then the voice of the
Prime Minister breaks it impressively as he addresses the King.</i></p>

<p>PROTEUS. You hear that, sir. Your one supporter in the Cabinet
admits that the industrial situation is too strong for her. I do not
pretend to be able to control the women in my Cabinet; but not one of
them dare support you.</p>

<p>AMANDA <i>[springing up]</i> Whats that? Not dare! What do you bet
that I dont go down to Mouldy Mike's constituency and say everything
that Lizzie has said and a lot more too, if I choose? I tell you,
Breakages, Limited, never interferes in my department. I'd like to
catch them at it.</p>

<p>MAGNUS. I am afraid that that is only because the efficiency of the
Post Office is as important to them as to the general public.</p>

<p>AMANDA. Stuff! They could get rid of me without shutting up the Post
Office. Theyre afraid of me--of me, Amanda Postlethwaite.</p>

<p>MAGNUS. You coax them, I am afraid.</p>

<p>AMANDA. Coax! What do you think they care for coaxing? They can have
all the coaxing they want from younger and prettier women than I by
paying for it. No use trying to coax that lot. Intimidate them: thats
the way to handle them.</p>

<p>LYSISTRATA <i>[her voice still broken]</i> I wish I could intimidate
them.</p>

<p>MAGNUS. But what can Amanda do that you cannot do?</p>

<p>AMANDA. I'll tell you. She cant mimic people. And she cant sing
funny songs. I can do both; and that--with all respect, sir--makes me
the real queen of England.</p>

<p>BOANERGES. Oh, come! Disgraceful! Shame!</p>

<p>AMANDA. If you provoke me, Bill, I'll drive you out of your
constituency inside of two months.</p>

<p>BOANERGES. Ho! You will, will you? How?</p>

<p>AMANDA. Just as I drove the Chairman of Breakages out of my own
constituency when he came down there and tried to take my seat from
me.</p>

<p>MAGNUS. I never quite understood why he turned tail. How did you do
it?</p>

<p>AMANDA. I'll tell you. He opened his campaign with a great Saturday
night speech against me in the Home Lovers' Hall to five thousand
people. In that same hall a week later, I faced a meeting of the very
same people. I didnt argue. I mimicked him. I took all the high-falutin
passages in his speech, and repeated them in his best manner until I
had the whole five thousand laughing at him. Then I asked them would
they like me to sing; and their Yes nearly lifted the roof off. I had
two songs. They both had choruses. One went "She lets me go out on
Saturday night, on Saturday night, on Saturday night"--like that. The
other went "Boo! Hoo! I want Amanda's Teddy bear to play with." They
sang it under the windows of his hotel next time he came. He cancelled
his meeting and left. And thats how England is governed by yours truly,
sir. Lucky for England that Queen Amanda is a good sort, in spite of
some surface faults. <i>[She resumes her seat with triumphant
self-satisfaction].</i></p>

<p>BALBUS. Lucky for England theres only one of you: thats what
<i>I</i> say.</p>

<p>AMANDA <i>[wafts him a kiss]</i>!</p>

<p>MAGNUS. Should not the Queen support the King, your Majesty?</p>

<p>AMANDA. Sorry, sir; but there isnt room for two monarchs in my
realm. I am against you on principle because the talent for mimicry
isnt hereditary.</p>

<p>PROTEUS. Now, anybody else? We have heard why the two ladies cannot
support the King. Is there anybody who can?</p>

<p><i>Silence.</i></p>

<p>MAGNUS. I see that my appeal has been in vain. I do not reproach
you, ladies and gentlemen, because I perceive that your situation is a
difficult one. The question is how to change it.</p>

<p>NICOBAR. Sign the ultimatum: that is how.</p>

<p>MAGNUS. I am not quite convinced of that. The Home Secretary's
brother-in-law was quite willing to sign the pledge of total abstinence
if I would admit him to the Cabinet. His offer was not accepted,
because, though none of us doubted that he would sign the pledge, we
were not equally certain that the infirmities of his nature would allow
him to keep it. My nature is also subject to infirmity. Are you
satisfied, Mr Proteus, that if I sign this ultimatum, I shall not
inevitably relapse into the conduct that my nature dictates?</p>

<p>PROTEUS <i>[his patience strained]</i> What is the use of going on
like this? You are a man on the scaffold, spinning out his prayers to
put off the inevitable execution as long as possible. Nothing that you
can say will make any difference. You know you must sign. Why not sign
and have done with it?</p>

<p>NICOBAR. Now youre talking, Joe.</p>

<p>BALBUS. Thats the stuff to give him.</p>

<p>PLINY. Gulp it down, sir. It wont get any sweeter by keeping:
what?</p>

<p>LYSISTRATA. Oh, for God's sake, sign, sir. This is torture to
me.</p>

<p>MAGNUS. I perceive, gentlemen, that I have come to the end of your
patience. I will tax it no further: you have been very forbearing; and
I thank you for it. I will say no more by way of discussion; but I must
have until five o'clock this evening to consider my decision. At that
hour, if I can find no other way out, I will sign without another word.
Meanwhile, ladies and gentlemen, au revoir!</p>

<p><i>He rises. All rise. He marches out.</i></p>

<p>PROTEUS. His last wriggle. Never mind: we have him safe enough. What
about lunch? I am starving. Will you lunch with me, Lizzie.</p>

<p>LYSISTRATA. Dont speak to me. <i>[She rushes out
distractedly].</i></p>

<p>AMANDA. Poor darling Lizzie! She's a regular old true blue Diehard.
If only I had her brains and education! or if she had my variety
talent! what a queen she'd make! Like old Queen Elizabeth, eh? Dont
grieve, Joe: I'll lunch with you since youre so pressing.</p>

<p>CRASSUS. Come and lunch with me--all of you.</p>

<p>AMANDA. What opulence! Can you afford it?</p>

<p>CRASSUS. Breakages will pay. They have a standing account at the
Ritz. Over five thousand a year, it comes to.</p>

<p>PROTEUS. Right. Let us spoil the Egyptians.</p>

<p>BOANERGES <i>[with Roman dignity]</i> My lunch will cost me one and
sixpence; and I shall pay for it myself <i>[he stalks out].</i></p>

<p>AMANDA <i>[calling after him]</i> Dont make a beast of yourself,
Bill. Ta ta!</p>

<p>PROTEUS. Come on, come on: it's ever so late.</p>

<p><i>They all hurry out. Sempronius and Pamphilius, entering, have to
stand aside to let them pass before returning to their desks. Proteus,
with Amanda on his arm, stops in the doorway on seeing them.</i></p>

<p>PROTEUS. Have you two been listening, may I ask?</p>

<p>PAMPHILIUS. Well, it would be rather inconvenient wouldnt it, if we
had to be told everything that passed?</p>

<p>SEMPRONIUS. Once for all, Mr Proteus, the King's private secretaries
must hear everything, see everything, and know everything.</p>

<p>PROTEUS. Singularly enough, Mr Sempronius, I havnt the slightest
objection <i>[he goes].</i></p>

<h1><a name="i01">AN INTERLUDE</a></h1>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p><i>Orinthia's boudoir at half-past fifteen on the same day. She is
at her writing-table scribbling notes. She is romantically beautiful,
and beautifully dressed. As the table is against the wall near a
corner, with the other wall on her left, her back alone is visible from
the middle of the room. The door is near the corner diagonally
opposite. There is a large settee in the middle of the room.</i></p>

<p><i>The King enters and waits on the threshold.</i></p>

<p> </p>

<p>ORINTHIA <i>[crossly, without looking round]</i> Who is that?</p>

<p>MAGNUS. His Majesty the King.</p>

<p>ORINTHIA. I dont want to see him.</p>

<p>MAGNUS. How soon will you be disengaged?</p>

<p>ORINTHIA. I didnt say I was engaged. Tell the king I dont want to
see him.</p>

<p>MAGNUS. He awaits your pleasure <i>[he comes in and seats himself on
the settee].</i></p>

<p>ORINTHIA. Go away. <i>[A pause].</i> I wont speak to you.
<i>[Another pause].</i> If my private rooms are to be broken into at
any moment because they are in the palace, and the king is not a
gentleman, I must take a house outside. I am writing to the agents
about one now.</p>

<p>MAGNUS. What is our quarrel today, belov&eacute;d?</p>

<p>ORINTHIA. Ask your conscience.</p>

<p>MAGNUS. I have none when you are concerned. You must tell me.</p>

<p><i>She takes a book from the table and rises; then sweeps superbly
forward to the settee and flings the book into his hands.</i></p>

<p>ORINTHIA. There!</p>

<p>MAGNUS. What is this?</p>

<p>ORINTHIA. Page 16. Look at it.</p>

<p>MAGNUS <i>[looking at the title on the back of the book]</i> "Songs
of our Great Great Grandparents." What page did you say?</p>

<p>ORINTHIA <i>[between her teeth]</i> Six-teen.</p>

<p>MAGNUS <i>[opening the book and finding the page, his eye lighting
up with recognition as he looks at it]</i> Ah! The Pilgrim of Love!</p>

<p>ORINTHIA. Read the first three words--if you dare.</p>

<p>MAGNUS <i>[smiling as he caresses the phrase]</i> "Orinthia, my
belov&eacute;d".</p>

<p>ORINTHIA. The name you pretended to invent specially for me, the
only women in the world for you. Picked up out of the rubbish basket in
a secondhand bookseller's! And I thought you were a poet!</p>

<p>MAGNUS. Well, one poet may consecrate a name for another. Orinthia
is a name full of magic for me. It could not be that if I had invented
it myself. I heard it at a concert of ancient music when I was a child;
and I have treasured it ever since.</p>

<p>ORINTHIA. You always have a pretty excuse. You are the King of liars
and humbugs. You cannot understand how a falsehood like that wounds
me.</p>

<p>MAGNUS <i>[remorsefully, stretching out his arms towards her]</i>
Belov&eacute;d: I am sorry.</p>

<p>ORINTHIA. Put your hands in your pockets: they shall not touch me
ever again.</p>

<p>MAGNUS <i>[obeying]</i> Dont pretend to be hurt unless you really
are, dearest. It wrings my heart.</p>

<p>ORINTHIA. Since when have you set up a heart? Did you buy that, too,
secondhand?</p>

<p>MAGNUS. I have something in me that winces when you are hurt--or
pretend to be.</p>

<p>ORINTHIA <i>[contemptuously]</i> Yes: I have only to squeal, and you
will take me up and pet me as you would a puppy run over by a car.
<i>[Sitting down beside him, but beyond arm's length]</i> That is what
you give me when my heart demands love. I had rather you kicked me.</p>

<p>MAGNUS. I should like to kick you sometimes, when you are specially
aggravating. But I shouldnt do it well. I should be afraid of hurting
you all the time.</p>

<p>ORINTHIA. I believe you would sign my death warrant without turning
a hair.</p>

<p>MAGNUS. That is true, in a way. It is wonderful how subtle your mind
is, as far as it goes.</p>

<p>ORINTHIA. It does not go as far as yours, I suppose.</p>

<p>MAGNUS. I dont know. Our minds go together half way. Whether it is
that your mind stops there or else that the road forks, and you take
the high road and I take the low road, I cannot say; but somehow after
a certain point we lose one another.</p>

<p>ORINTHIA. And then you go back to your Amandas and Lysistratas:
creatures whose idea of romance is a minister in love with a
department, and whose bedside books are blue books.</p>

<p>MAGNUS. They are not always thinking of some man or other. That is a
rather desirable extension of their interests, in my opinion. If
Lysistrata had a lover I should not be interested in him in the least;
and she would bore me to distraction if she could talk of nothing else.
But I am very much interested in her department. Her devotion to it
gives us a topic of endless interest.</p>

<p>ORINTHIA. Well, go to her: I am not detaining you. But dont tell her
that I have nothing to talk about but men; for that is a lie; and you
know it.</p>

<p>MAGNUS. It is, as you say, a lie; and I know it. But I did not say
it.</p>

<p>ORINTHIA. You implied it. You meant it. When those ridiculous
political women are with us you talk to them all the time, and never
say a word to me.</p>

<p>MAGNUS. Nor you to me. We cannot talk to one another in public: we
have nothing to say that could be said before other people. Yet we find
enough to say to one another when we are alone together. Would you
change that if you could?</p>

<p>ORINTHIA. You are as slippery as an eel; but you shall not slip
through my fingers. Why do you surround yourself with political bores
and frumps and dowdy busybodies who cant talk: they can only debate
about their dull departments and their fads and their election chances.
<i>[Rising impatiently]</i> Who could talk to such people? If it were
not for the nonentities of wives and husbands they drag about with
them, there would be nobody to talk to at all. And even they can talk
of nothing but the servants and the baby. <i>[Suddenly returning to her
seat]</i> Listen to me, Magnus. Why can you not be a real king?</p>

<p>MAGNUS. In what way, belov&eacute;dest?</p>

<p>ORINTHIA. Send all these stupid people packing. Make them do their
drudgeries in their departments without bothering you about it, as you
make your servants sweep the floors and dust the furniture. Live a
really noble and beautiful life--a kingly life--with me. What you need
to make you a real king is a real queen.</p>

<p>MAGNUS. But I have got one.</p>

<p>ORINTHIA. Oh, you are blind. You are worse than blind: you have low
tastes. Heaven is offering you a rose; and you cling to a cabbage.</p>

<p>MAGNUS <i>[laughing]</i> That is a very apt metaphor,
belov&eacute;d. But what wise man, if you force him to choose between
doing without roses and doing without cabbages, would not secure the
cabbages? Besides, all these old married cabbages were once roses; and,
though young things like you dont remember that, their husbands do.
They dont notice the change. Besides, you should know better than
anyone else that when a man gets tired of his wife and leaves her it is
never because she has lost her good looks. The new love is often older
and uglier than the old.</p>

<p>ORINTHIA. Why should I know it better than anyone else?</p>

<p>MAGNUS. Why, because you have been married twice; and both your
husbands have run away from you to much plainer and stupider women.
When I begged your present husband to come back to court for a while
for the sake of appearances he said no man could call his soul his own
in the same house with you. And yet that man was utterly infatuated
with your beauty when he married you. Your first husband actually
forced a good wife to divorce him so that he might marry you; but
before two years were out he went back to her and died in her arms,
poor chap.</p>

<p>ORINTHIA. Shall I tell you why these men could not live with me? It
was because I am a thoroughbred, and they were only hacks. They had
nothing against me: I was perfectly faithful to them. I kept their
houses beautifully: I fed them better than they had ever been fed in
their lives. But because I was higher than they were, and greater, they
could not stand the strain of trying to live up to me. So I let them go
their way, poor wretches, back to their cabbages. Look at the old
creature Ignatius is living with now! She gives you his real
measure.</p>

<p>MAGNUS. An excellent woman. Ignatius is quite happy with her. I
never saw a man so changed.</p>

<p>ORINTHIA. Just what he is fit for. Commonplace. Bourgeoise. She
trots through the streets shopping. <i>[Rising]</i> I tread the plains
of Heaven. Common women cannot come where I am; and common men find
themselves out and slink away.</p>

<p>MAGNUS. It must be magnificent to have the consciousness of a
goddess without ever doing a thing to justify it.</p>

<p>ORINTHIA. Give me a goddess's work to do; and I will do it. I will
even stoop to a queen's work if you will share the throne with me. But
do not pretend that people become great by doing great things. They do
great things because they are great, if the great things come along.
But they are great just the same when the great things do not come
along. If I never did anything but sit in this room and powder my face
and tell you what a clever fool you are, I should still be heavens high
above the millions of common women who do their domestic duty, and
sacrifice themselves, and run Trade departments and all the rest of the
vulgarities. Has all the tedious public work you have done made you any
the better? I have seen you before and after your boasted strokes of
policy; and you were the same man, and would have been the same man to
me and to yourself if you had never done them. Thank God my
self-consciousness is something nobler than vulgar conceit in having
done something. It is what I am, not what I do, that you must worship
in me. If you want deeds, go to your men and women of action, as you
call them, who are all in a conspiracy to pretend that the mechanical
things they do, the foolhardy way they risk their worthless lives, or
their getting up in the morning at four and working sixteen hours a day
for thirty years, like coral insects, make them great. What are they
for? these dull slaves? To keep the streets swept for me. To enable me
to reign over them in beauty like the stars without having anything to
do with their slavery except to console it, to dazzle it, to enable
them to forget it in adoring dreams of me. Am I not worth it? <i>[She
sits, fascinating him].</i> Look into my eyes and tell the truth. Am I
worth it or not?</p>

<p>MAGNUS. To me, who love beauty, yes. But you should hear the
speeches Balbus makes about your pension.</p>

<p>ORINTHIA. And my debts: do not forget my debts, my mortgages, the
bill of sale on my furniture, the thousands I have had from the
moneylenders to save me from being sold up because I will not borrow
from my friends. Lecture me again about them; but do not dare pretend
that the people grudge me my pension. They glory in it, and in my
extravagance, as you call it.</p>

<p>MAGNUS <i>[more gravely]</i> By the way, Orinthia, when your
dressmakers took up that last bill for you, they were speculating, were
they not, in your chances of becoming my queen some day?</p>

<p>ORINTHIA. Well, what if they were?</p>

<p>MAGNUS. They would hardly have ventured on that without a hint from
somebody. Was it from you?</p>

<p>ORINTHIA. You think me capable of that! You have a very low side to
you, Magnus.</p>

<p>MAGNUS. No doubt: like other mortal fabrics I have a wrong side and
a right side. But it is no use your giving yourself airs,
belov&eacute;dest. You are capable of anything. Do you deny that there
was some suggestion of the kind?</p>

<p>ORINTHIA. How dare you challenge me to deny it? I never deny. Of
course there was a suggestion of the kind.</p>

<p>MAGNUS. I thought so.</p>

<p>ORINTHIA. Oh, stupid! stupid! Go keep a grocer's shop: that is what
you are fit for. Do you suppose that the suggestion came from me? Why,
you great oaf, it is in the air: when my dressmaker hinted at it I told
her that if she ever dared to repeat such a thing she should never get
another order from me. But can I help people seeing what is as plain as
the sun in the heavens? <i>[Rising again]</i> Everyone knows that I am
the real queen. Everyone treats me as the real queen. They cheer me in
the streets. When I open one of the art exhibitions or launch a new
ship they crowd the place out. I am one of Nature's queens; and they
know it. If you do not, you are not one of Nature's kings.</p>

<p>MAGNUS. Sublime! Nothing but genuine inspiration could give a woman
such cheek.</p>

<p>ORINTHIA. Yes: inspiration, not cheek. <i>[Sitting as before]</i>
Magnus: when are you going to face my destiny, and your own?</p>

<p>MAGNUS. But my wife? the queen? What is to become of my poor dear
Jemima?</p>

<p>ORINTHIA. Oh, drown her: shoot her: tell your chauffeur to drive her
into the Serpentine and leave her there. The woman makes you
ridiculous.</p>

<p>MAGNUS. I dont think I should like that. And the public would think
it illnatured.</p>

<p>ORINTHIA. Oh, you know what I mean. Divorce her. Make her divorce
you. It is quite easy. That was how Ronny married me. Everybody does it
when they need a change.</p>

<p>MAGNUS. But I cant imagine what I should do without Jemima.</p>

<p>ORINTHIA. Nobody else can imagine what you do with her. But you need
not do without her. You can see as much of her as you like when we are
married. I shall not be jealous and make scenes.</p>

<p>MAGNUS. That is very magnanimous of you. But I am afraid it does not
settle the difficulty. Jemima would not think it right to keep up her
present intimacy with me if I were married to you.</p>

<p>ORINTHIA. What a woman! Would she be in any worse position then than
I am in now?</p>

<p>MAGNUS. No.</p>

<p>ORINTHIA. You mean, then, that you do not mind placing me in a
position that you do not think good enough for her?</p>

<p>MAGNUS. Orinthia: I did not place you in your present position. You
placed yourself in it. I could not resist you. You gathered me like a
daisy.</p>

<p>ORINTHIA. Did you want to resist me?</p>

<p>MAGNUS. Oh no. I never resist temptation, because I have found that
things that are bad for me do not tempt me.</p>

<p>ORINTHIA. Well, then, what are we talking about?</p>

<p>MAGNUS. I forget. I think I was explaining the impossibility of my
wife changing places with you.</p>

<p>ORINTHIA. Why impossible, pray?</p>

<p>MAGNUS. I cannot make you understand: you see you have never been
really married, though you have led two captives to the altar, and
borne children to one of them. Being your husband is only a job for
which one man will do as well as another, and which the last man holds
subject to six months notice in the divorce court. Being my wife is
something quite different. The smallest derogation to Jemima's dignity
would hit me like the lash of a whip across the face. About yours,
somehow, I do not care a rap.</p>

<p>ORINTHIA. Nothing can derogate from my dignity: it is divine. Hers
is only a convention: that is why you tremble when it is
challenged.</p>

<p>MAGNUS. Not a bit. It is because she is a part of my real workaday
self. You belong to fairyland.</p>

<p>ORINTHIA. Suppose she dies! Will you die too?</p>

<p>MAGNUS. Not immediately. I shall have to carry on as best I can
without her, though the prospect terrifies me.</p>

<p>ORINTHIA. Might not carrying on without her include marrying me?</p>

<p>MAGNUS. My dear Orinthia, I had rather marry the devil. Being a wife
is not your job.</p>

<p>ORINTHIA. You think so because you have no imagination. And you dont
know me because I have never let you really possess me. I should make
you more happy than any man has ever yet been on earth.</p>

<p>MAGNUS. I defy you to make me more happy than our strangely innocent
relations have already made me.</p>

<p>ORINTHIA <i>[rising restlessly]</i> You talk like a child or a
saint. <i>[Turning on him]</i> I can give you a new life: one of which
you have no conception. I can give you beautiful, wonderful children:
have you ever seen a lovelier boy than my Basil?</p>

<p>MAGNUS. Your children are beautiful; but they are fairy children;
and I have several very real ones already. A divorce would not sweep
them out of the way of the fairies.</p>

<p>ORINTHIA. In short, when your golden moment comes--when the gates of
heaven open before you, you are afraid to come out of your pigsty.</p>

<p>MAGNUS. If I am a pig, a pigsty is the proper place for me.</p>

<p>ORINTHIA. I cannot understand it. All men are fools and moral
cowards when you come to know them. But you are less of a fool and less
of a moral coward than any man I have ever known. You have almost the
makings of a first rate woman in you. When I leave the earth and soar
up to the regions which are my real eternal home, you can follow me: I
can speak to you as I can speak to no one else; and you can say things
to me that would just make your stupid wife cry. There is more of you
in me than of any other man within my reach. There is more of me in you
than of any other woman within your reach. We are meant for oneanother:
it is written across the sky that you and I are queen and king. How can
you hesitate? What attraction is there for you in your common healthy
jolly lumps of children and your common housekeeper wife and the rabble
of dowdies and upstarts and intriguers and clowns that think they are
governing the country when they are only squabbling with you? Look
again at me, man: again and again. Am I not worth a million such? Is
not life with me as high above them as the sun is above the gutter?</p>

<p>MAGNUS. Yes yes yes yes, of course. You are lovely: you are divine
<i>[she cannot restrain a gesture of triumph].</i> And you are
enormously amusing.</p>

<p><i>This anti-climax is too much for Orinthia's exaltation; but she
is too clever not to appreciate it. With another gesture, this time of
deflation, she sits down at his left hand with an air of suffering
patience, and listens in silence to the harangue which follows.</i></p>

<p>MAGNUS. Some day perhaps Nature will graft the roses on the cabbages
and make every woman as enchanting as you; and then what a glorious
lark life will be! But at present, what I come here for is to enjoy
talking to you like this when I need an hour's respite from royalty:
when my stupid wife has been worrying me, or my jolly lumps of children
bothering me, or my turbulent Cabinet obstructing me: when, as the
doctors say, what I need is a change. You see, my dear, there is no
wife on earth so precious, no children so jolly, no Cabinet so tactful
that it is impossible ever to get tired of them. Jemima has her
limitations, as you have observed. And I have mine. Now if our
limitations exactly corresponded I should never want to talk to anyone
else; and neither would she. But as that never happens, we are like all
other married couples: that is, there are subjects which can never be
discussed between us because they are sore subjects. There are people
we avoid mentioning to oneanother because one of us likes them and the
other doesnt. Not only individuals, but whole sorts of people. For
instance, your sort. My wife doesnt like your sort, doesnt understand
it, mistrusts and dreads it. Not without reason; for women like you are
dangerous to wives. But I dont dislike your sort: I understand it,
being a little in that line myself. At all events I am not afraid of
it; though the least allusion to it brings a cloud over my wife's face.
So when I want to talk freely about it I come and talk to you. And I
take it she talks to friends of hers about people of whom she never
talks to me. She has men friends from whom she can get some things that
she cannot get from me. If she didnt do so she would be limited by my
limitations, which would end in her hating me. So I always do my best
to make her men friends feel at home with us.</p>

<p>ORINTHIA. A model husband in a model household! And when the model
household becomes a bore, I am the diversion.</p>

<p>MAGNUS. Well, what more can you ask? Do not let us fall into the
common mistake of expecting to become one flesh and one spirit. Every
star has its own orbit; and between it and its nearest neighbor there
is not only a powerful attraction but an infinite distance. When the
attraction becomes stronger than the distance the two do not embrace:
they crash together in ruin. We two also have our orbits, and must keep
an infinite distance between us to avoid a disastrous collision.
Keeping our distance is the whole secret of good manners; and without
good manners human society is intolerable and impossible.</p>

<p>ORINTHIA. Would any other woman stand your sermons, and even like
them?</p>

<p>MAGNUS. Orinthia: we are only two children at play; and you must be
content to be my queen in fairyland. And <i>[rising]</i> I must go back
to my work.</p>

<p>ORINTHIA. What work have you that is more important than being with
me?</p>

<p>MAGNUS. None.</p>

<p>ORINTHIA. Then sit down.</p>

<p>MAGNUS. Unfortunately, this silly business of government must be
carried on. And there is a crisis this evening, as usual.</p>

<p>ORINTHIA. But the crisis is not until five: I heard all about it
from Sempronius. Why do you encourage that greedy schemer Proteus? He
humbugs you. He humbugs everybody. He even humbugs himself; and of
course he humbugs that Cabinet which is a disgrace to you: it is like
an overcrowded third class carriage. Why do you allow such riffraff to
waste your time? After all, what are you paid for? To be a king: that
is, to wipe your boots on common people.</p>

<p>MAGNUS. Yes: but this king business, as the Americans call it, has
got itself so mixed up with democracy that half the country expects me
to wipe my perfectly polished boots on the Cabinet, and the other half
expects me to let the Cabinet wipe its muddy boots on me. The Crisis at
five o'clock is to decide which of us is to be the doormat.</p>

<p>ORINTHIA. And you will condescend to fight with Proteus for
power?</p>

<p>MAGNUS. Oh no: I never fight. But I sometimes win.</p>

<p>ORINTHIA. If you let yourself be beaten by that trickster and
poseur, never dare to approach me again.</p>

<p>MAGNUS. Proteus is a clever fellow: even on occasion a fine fellow.
It would give me no satisfaction to beat him: I hate beating people.
But there would be some innocent fun in outwitting him.</p>

<p>ORINTHIA. Magnus: you are a mollycoddle. If you were a real man you
would just delight in beating him to a jelly.</p>

<p>MAGNUS. A real man would never do as a king. I am only an idol, my
love; and all I can do is to draw the line at being a cruel idol.
<i>[He looks at his watch]</i> Now I must really be off. Au revoir.</p>

<p>ORINTHIA <i>[looking at her wrist watch]</i> But it is only
twenty-five minutes past four. You have heaps of time before five.</p>

<p>MAGNUS. Yes; but tea is at half-past four.</p>

<p>ORINTHIA <i>[catching him by the arm with a snakelike dart]</i>
Never mind your tea. I will give you your tea.</p>

<p>MAGNUS. Impossible, belov&eacute;d. Jemima does not like to be kept
waiting.</p>

<p>ORINTHIA. Oh, bother Jemima! You shall not leave me to go to Jemima
<i>[she pulls him back so vigorously that he falls into the seat beside
her].</i></p>

<p>MAGNUS. My dear, I must.</p>

<p>ORINTHIA. No, not today. Listen, Magnus. I have something very
particular to say to you.</p>

<p>MAGNUS. You have not. You are only trying to make me late to annoy
my wife. <i>[He tries to rise, but is pulled back].</i> Let me go,
please.</p>

<p>ORINTHIA <i>[holding on]</i> Why are you so afraid of your wife? You
are the laughing stock of London, you poor henpecked darling.</p>

<p>MAGNUS. Henpecked! What do you call this? At least my wife does not
restrain me by bodily violence.</p>

<p>ORINTHIA. I will not be deserted for your old Dutch.</p>

<p>MAGNUS. Listen, Orinthia. Dont be absurd. You know I must go. Do be
good.</p>

<p>ORINTHIA. Only ten minutes more.</p>

<p>MAGNUS. It is half-past already.</p>

<p><i>He tries to rise; but she holds him back.</i></p>

<p>MAGNUS <i>[pausing for breath]</i> You are doing this out of sheer
devilment. You are so abominably strong that I cannot break loose
without hurting you. Must I call the guard?</p>

<p>ORINTHIA. Do, do. It will be in all the papers tomorrow.</p>

<p>MAGNUS. Fiend. <i>[Summoning all his dignity]</i> Orinthia: I
command you.</p>

<p>ORINTHIA <i>[laughs wildly]</i>!!!</p>

<p>MAGNUS <i>[furious]</i> Very well, then, you she-devil: you shall
let go.</p>

<p><i>He tackles her in earnest. She flings her arms round him and
holds on with mischievous enjoyment. There is a tapping at the door;
they do not hear it. As he is breaking loose she suddenly shifts her
grip to his waist and drags him on to the floor, where they roll over
one another. Sempronius enters. He stares at the scandalous scene for a
moment; then hastily slips out; shuts the door; clears his throat and
blows his nose noisily; and knocks loudly and repeatedly. The two
combatants cease hostilities and scramble hastily to their
feet.</i></p>

<p>MAGNUS. Come in.</p>

<p>SEMPRONIUS <i>[entering]</i> Her Majesty sent me to remind you that
tea is waiting, sir.</p>

<p>MAGNUS. Thank you. <i>[He goes quickly out].</i></p>

<p>ORINTHIA <i>[panting but greatly pleased with herself]</i> The King
forgets everything when he is here. So do I, I am afraid. I am so
sorry.</p>

<p>SEMPRONIUS <i>[stiffly]</i> No explanations are needed. I saw what
happened. <i>[He goes out].</i></p>

<p>ORINTHIA. The beast! He must have looked through the keyhole.
<i>[She throws her hand up with a gesture of laughing defiance, and
dances back to her seat at the writing-table].</i></p>

<h1><a name="a02">ACT II</a></h1>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p><i>Later in the afternoon. The Terrace of the Palace. A low
balustrade separates it from the lawn. Terrace chairs in abundance,
ranged along the balustrade. Some dining room chairs also, not ranged,
but standing about as if they had just been occupied. The terrace is
accessible from the lawn by a central flight of steps.</i></p>

<p><i>The King and Queen are sitting apart near the corners of the
steps, the Queen to the King's right. He is reading the evening paper:
she is knitting. She has a little work table on her right, with a small
gong on it.</i></p>

<p> </p>

<p>THE QUEEN. Why did you tell them to leave the chairs when they took
away the tea?</p>

<p>MAGNUS. I shall receive the Cabinet here.</p>

<p>THE QUEEN. Here! Why?</p>

<p>MAGNUS. Well, I think the open air and the evening light will have a
quieting effect on them. They cannot make speeches at me so easily as
in a room.</p>

<p>THE QUEEN. Are you sure? When Robert asked Boanerges where he learnt
to speak so beautifully, he said "In Hyde Park."</p>

<p>MAGNUS. Yes; but with a crowd to stimulate him.</p>

<p>THE QUEEN. Robert says you have tamed Boanerges.</p>

<p>MAGNUS. No: I have not tamed him. I have taught him how to behave. I
have to valet all the beginners; but that does not tame them: it
teaches them how to use their strength instead of wasting it in making
fools of themselves. So much the worse for me when I have to fight
them.</p>

<p>THE QUEEN. You get no thanks for it. They think you are only
humbugging them.</p>

<p>MAGNUS. Well, so I am, in the elementary lessons. But when it comes
to real business humbug is no use: they pick it up themselves too
quickly.</p>

<p><i>Pamphilius enters along the terrace, from the Queen's
side.</i></p>

<p>MAGNUS <i>[looking at his watch]</i> Good Heavens! They havnt come,
have they? It's not five yet.</p>

<p>PAMPHILIUS. No, sir. It's the American ambassador.</p>

<p>THE QUEEN <i>[resenting this a little]</i> Has he an audience?</p>

<p>PAMPHILIUS. No, maam. He is rather excited about something, I think.
I cant get anything out of him. He says he must see His Majesty at
once.</p>

<p>THE QUEEN. Must!! An American must see the King at once, without an
audience! Well!</p>

<p>MAGNUS <i>[rising]</i> Send him in, Pam.</p>

<p><i>Pamphilius goes out.</i></p>

<p>THE QUEEN. <i>I</i> should have told him to write for an audience,
and then kept him waiting a week for it.</p>

<p>MAGNUS. What! When we still owe America that old war debt. And with
a mad imperialist president like Bossfield! No you wouldnt, my dear:
you would be crawlingly civil to him, as I am going to be, confound
him!</p>

<p>PAMPHILIUS <i>[re-appearing]</i> His Excellency the American
Ambassador. Mr Vanhattan.</p>

<p><i>He retires as Mr Vanhattan enters in an effusive condition, and,
like a man assured of an enthusiastic welcome, hurries to the Queen,
and salutes her with a handshake so prolonged that she stares in
astonishment, first at him, and then appealingly at the King, with her
hands being vigorously wrung and waved up and down all the
time.</i></p>

<p>MAGNUS. What on earth is the matter, Mr Vanhattan? You are shaking
Her Majesty's rings off.</p>

<p>VANHATTAN <i>[desisting]</i> Her Majesty will excuse me when she
learns the nature of my errand here. This, King Magnus, is a great
historic scene: one of the greatest, perhaps, that history has ever
recorded or will ever again record.</p>

<p>MAGNUS. Have you had tea?</p>

<p>VANHATTAN. Tea! Who can think of tea at such a moment as this?</p>

<p>THE QUEEN <i>[rather coldly]</i> It is hard for us to share your
enthusiasm in complete ignorance of its cause.</p>

<p>VANHATTAN. That is true, maam. I am just behaving like a crazy man.
But you shall hear. You shall judge, and then you shall say whether I
exaggerate the importance--the immensity--of an occasion that cannot be
exaggerated.</p>

<p>MAGNUS. Goodness gracious! Wont you sit down?</p>

<p>VANHATTAN <i>[taking a chair and placing it between them]</i> I
thank your Majesty. <i>[He sits].</i></p>

<p>MAGNUS. You have some exciting news for us, apparently. Is it
private or official?</p>

<p>VANHATTAN. Official, sir. No mistake about it. What I am going to
tell you is authentic from the United States of America to the British
Empire.</p>

<p>THE QUEEN. Perhaps I had better go.</p>

<p>VANHATTAN. No, maam: you shall not go. Whatever may be the limits of
your privileges as the consort of your sovereign, it is your right as
an Englishwoman to learn what I have come here to communicate.</p>

<p>MAGNUS. My dear Vanhattan, what the devil is the matter?</p>

<p>VANHATTAN. King Magnus: between your country and mine there is a
debt.</p>

<p>MAGNUS. Does that matter, now that our capitalists have invested so
heavily in American concerns that after paying yourselves the interest
on the debt you have to send us two thousand million dollars a year to
balance the account.</p>

<p>VANHATTAN. King Magnus: for the moment, forget figures. Between your
country and mine there is not only a debt but a frontier: the frontier
that has on it not a single gun nor a single soldier, and across which
the American citizen every day shakes the hand of the Canadian subject
of your throne.</p>

<p>MAGNUS. There is also the frontier of the ocean, which is somewhat
more expensively defended at our joint expense by the League of
Nations.</p>

<p>VANHATTAN <i>[rising to give his words more impressiveness]</i> Sir:
the debt is cancelled. The frontier no longer exists.</p>

<p>THE QUEEN. How can that be?</p>

<p>MAGNUS. Am I to understand, Mr Vanhattan, that by some convulsion of
Nature the continent of North America has been submerged in the
Atlantic?</p>

<p>VANHATTAN. Something even more wonderful than that has happened. One
may say that the Atlantic Ocean has been submerged in the British
Empire.</p>

<p>MAGNUS. I think you had better tell us as succinctly as possible
what has happened. Pray sit down.</p>

<p>VANHATTAN <i>[resuming his seat]</i> You are aware, sir, that the
United States of America at one time formed a part of your empire.</p>

<p>MAGNUS. There is a tradition to that effect.</p>

<p>VANHATTAN. No mere tradition, sir. An undoubted historical fact. In
the eighteenth century--</p>

<p>MAGNUS. That is a long time ago.</p>

<p>VANHATTAN. Centuries count for but little in the lifetimes of great
nations, sir. Let me recall the parable of the prodigal son.</p>

<p>MAGNUS. Oh really, Mr Vanhattan, that was a very very long time ago.
I take it that something important has happened since yesterday.</p>

<p>VANHATTAN. It has. It has indeed, King Magnus.</p>

<p>MAGNUS. Then what is it? I have not time to attend to the eighteenth
century and the prodigal son at this moment.</p>

<p>THE QUEEN. The King has a Cabinet meeting in ten minutes, Mr
Vanhattan.</p>

<p>VANHATTAN. I should like to see the faces of your Cabinet ministers,
King Magnus, when they hear what I have to tell you.</p>

<p>MAGNUS. So should I. But I am not in a position to tell it to them,
because I dont know what it is.</p>

<p>VANHATTAN. The prodigal, sir, has returned to his father's house.
Not poor, not hungry, not ragged, as of old. Oh no. This time he
returns bringing with him the riches of the earth to the ancestral
home.</p>

<p>MAGNUS <i>[starting from his chair]</i> You dont mean to say--</p>

<p>VANHATTAN <i>[rising also, blandly triumphant]</i> I do, sir. The
Declaration of Independence is cancelled. The treaties which endorsed
it are torn up. We have decided to rejoin the British Empire. We shall
of course enjoy Dominion Home Rule under the Presidency of Mr
Bossfield. I shall revisit you here shortly, not as the Ambassador of a
foreign power, but as High Commissioner for the greatest of your
dominions, and your very loyal and devoted subject, sir.</p>

<p>MAGNUS <i>[collapsing into his chair]</i> The devil you will! <i>[He
stares haggardly into futurity, now for the first time utterly at a
loss].</i></p>

<p>THE QUEEN. What a splendid thing, Mr Vanhattan!</p>

<p>VANHATTAN. I thought your Majesty would say so. The most splendid
thing that has ever happened. <i>[He resumes his seat].</i></p>

<p>THE QUEEN <i>[looking anxiously at the King]</i> Dont you think so,
Magnus?</p>

<p>MAGNUS <i>[pulling himself together with a visible effort]</i> May I
ask, Mr Vanhattan, with whom did this--this--this masterstroke of
American policy originate? Frankly, I have been accustomed to regard
your President as a statesman whose mouth was the most efficient part
of his head. He cannot have thought of this himself. Who suggested it
to him?</p>

<p>VANHATTAN. I must accept your criticism of Mr Bossfield with all doo
reserve, but I may mention that we Americans will probably connect the
good news with the recent visit to our shores of the President of the
Irish Free State. I cannot pronounce his name in its official Gaelic
form; and there is only one typist in our bureau who can spell it; but
he is known to his friends as Mick O'Rafferty.</p>

<p>MAGNUS. The rascal! Jemima: we shall have to live in Dublin. This is
the end of England.</p>

<p>VANHATTAN. In a sense that may be so. But England will not perish.
She will merge--merge, sir--into a bigger and brighter concern. Perhaps
I should have mentioned that one of our conditions will be that you
shall be Emperor. King may be good enough for this little island; but
if we come in we shall require something grander.</p>

<p>MAGNUS. This little island! "This little gem set in a silver sea!"
Has it occurred to you, Mr Vanhattan, that rather than be reduced to a
mere appendage of a big American concern, we might raise the old warcry
of Sinn Fein, and fight for our independence to the last drop of our
blood?</p>

<p>VANHATTAN. I should be right sorry to contemplate such a reversion
to a barbarous past. Fortunately, it's impossible--immpawsibl. The old
warcry would not appeal to the cosmopolitan crews of the fleet of the
League of Nations in the Atlantic. That fleet would blockade you, sir.
And I fear we should be obliged to boycott you. The two thousand
million dollars a year would stop.</p>

<p>MAGNUS. But the continental Powers! Do you suppose they would
consent for a moment to such a change in the balance of power?</p>

<p>VANHATTAN. Why not? The change would be only nominal.</p>

<p>MAGNUS. Nominal! You call an amalgamation of the British
Commonwealth with the United States a nominal change! What will France
and Germany call it?</p>

<p>VANHATTAN <i>[shaking his head indulgently]</i> France and Germany?
These queer old geographical expressions which you use here from old
family habit do not trouble us. I suppose you mean by Germany the chain
of more or less Soviet Republics between the Ural Mountains and the
North Sea. Well, the clever people at Moscow and Berlin and Geneva are
trying to federate them; and it is fully understood between us that if
we dont object to their move they will not object to ours. France, by
which I take it you mean the Government at New Timgad, is too busy in
Africa to fuss about what is happening at the ends of your little
Channel Tube. So long as Paris is full of Americans, and Americans are
full of money, all's well in the west from the French point of view.
One of the great attractions of Paris for Americans is the excursion to
Old England. The French want us to feel at home here. And so we do. Why
shouldnt we? After all, we are at home here.</p>

<p>MAGNUS. In what sense, may I ask?</p>

<p>VANHATTAN. Well, we find here everything we are accustomed to: our
industrial products, our books, our plays, our sports, our Christian
Science churches, our osteopaths, our movies and talkies. Put it in a
small parcel and say our goods and our ideas. A political union with us
will be just the official recognition of an already accomplished fact.
A union of hearts, you might call it.</p>

<p>THE QUEEN. You forget, Mr Vanhattan. We have a great national
tradition.</p>

<p>VANHATTAN. The United States, maam, have absorbed all the great
national traditions, and blended them with their own glorious tradition
of Freedom into something that is unique and universal.</p>

<p>THE QUEEN. We have a civilized culture which is peculiar to
ourselves. It may not be better than yours; but it is different.</p>

<p>VANHATTAN. Well, is it? We found that culture enshrined in British
material works of art: in the stately country homes of your nobility,
in the cathedrals our common forefathers built as the country houses of
God. What did you do with them? You sold them to us. I was brought up
in the shade of Ely cathedral, the removal of which from the county of
Cambridge to New Jersey was my dear old father's first big professional
job. The building which stands on its former site is a very fine one:
in my opinion the best example of reinforced concrete of its period;
but it was designed by an American architect, and built by the
Synthetic Building Materials Trust, an international affair. Believe
me, the English people, the real English people who take things as they
come instead of reading books about them, will be more at home with us
than they are with the old English notions which our tourists try to
keep alive. When you find some country gentleman keeping up the old
English customs at Christmas and so forth, who is he? An American who
has bought the place. Your people get up the show for him because he
pays for it, not because it is natural to them.</p>

<p>THE QUEEN <i>[with a sigh]</i> Our own best families go so much to
Ireland nowadays. People should not be allowed to go from England to
Ireland. They never come back.</p>

<p>VANHATTAN. Well, can you blame them, maam? Look at the climate!</p>

<p>THE QUEEN. No: it is not the climate. It is the Horse Show.</p>

<p><i>The King rises very thoughtfully; and Vanhattan follows his
example.</i></p>

<p>MAGNUS. I must think over this. I have known for years past that it
was on the cards. When I was young, and under the influence of our
family tradition, which of course never recognized the rebellion of the
American colonies as valid, I actually dreamt of a reunited English
speaking empire at the head of civilization.</p>

<p>VANHATTAN. Fine! Great! And now come true.</p>

<p>MAGNUS. Not yet. Now that I am older and wiser I find the reality
less attractive than the dream.</p>

<p>VANHATTAN. And is that all I am to report to the President, sir? He
will be disappointed. I am a little taken aback, myself.</p>

<p>MAGNUS. For the present, that is all. This may be a great idea--</p>

<p>VANHATTAN. Surely, surely.</p>

<p>MAGNUS. It may also be a trap in which England will perish.</p>

<p>VANHATTAN <i>[encouragingly]</i> Oh, I shouldnt look at it that way.
Besides, nothing--not even dear old England--can last for ever.
Progress, you know, sir, progress, progress!</p>

<p>MAGNUS. Just so, just so. We may survive only as another star on
your flag. Still, we cling to the little scrap of individuality you
have left us. If we must merge, as you call it--or did you say
submerge?--some of us will swim to the last. <i>[To the Queen]</i> My
dear.</p>

<p><i>The Queen strikes her gong.</i></p>

<p><i>Pamphilius returns.</i></p>

<p>MAGNUS. You shall hear from me after the Cabinet meets. Not tonight:
you must not sit up waiting for a message. Early tomorrow, I hope.
Thank you for bringing me the news before the papers got it: that
seldom happens now. Pamphilius: you will reconduct his Excellency. Good
evening. <i>[He shakes hands].</i></p>

<p>VANHATTAN. I thank your Majesty. <i>[To the Queen]</i> Good evening,
maam. I look forward to presenting myself in court dress soon.</p>

<p>THE QUEEN. You will look very nice in it, Mr Vanhattan. Good
evening.</p>

<p><i>The Ambassador goes out with Pamphilius.</i></p>

<p>MAGNUS <i>[striding grimly to and fro]</i> The scoundrels! That
blackguard O'Rafferty! That booby bullroarer Bossfield! Breakages,
Limited, have taken it into their heads to mend the British
Commonwealth.</p>

<p>THE QUEEN <i>[quietly]</i> I think it is a very good thing. You will
make a very good emperor. We shall civilize these Americans.</p>

<p>MAGNUS. How can we when we have not yet civilized ourselves? They
have come to regard us as a mere tribe of redskins. England will be
just a reservation.</p>

<p>THE QUEEN. Nonsense, dear! They know that we are their natural
superiors. You can see it by the way their women behave at court. They
really love and reverence royalty; while our English peeresses are
hardly civil--when they condescend to come at all.</p>

<p>MAGNUS. Well, my dear, I do many things to please you that I should
never do to please myself; and I suppose I shall end as American
Emperor just to keep you amused.</p>

<p>THE QUEEN. I never desire anything that is not good for you, Magnus.
You do not always know what is good for you.</p>

<p>MAGNUS. Well, well, well, well! Have it your own way, dearest. Where
are these infernal ministers? Theyre late.</p>

<p>THE QUEEN <i>[looking out into the garden]</i> Coming across the
lawn with Sempronius.</p>

<p><i>The Cabinet arrives. The men take off their hats as they come up
the steps. Boanerges has taken advantage of the interval to procure a
brilliant uniform and change into it. Proteus, with Sempronius, heads
the procession, followed immediately by the two lady ministers. The
Queen rises as Proteus turns to her. Sempronius moves the little table
quickly back to the balustrade out of the way, and puts the Queen's
chair in the centre for the King.</i></p>

<p>THE QUEEN <i>[shaking hands]</i> How do you do, Mr Proteus?</p>

<p>PROTEUS. May I present the President of the Board of Trade, Mr
Boanerges?</p>

<p>THE QUEEN. I remember seeing you, Mr Boanerges, at the opening of
the Transport Workers' Summer Palace. You wore a most becoming costume
then. I hope you have not given it up.</p>

<p>BOANERGES. But the Princess told me I looked ridiculous in it!</p>

<p>THE QUEEN. That was very naughty of the Princess. You looked
particularly well in it. However, you look well in anything. And now I
leave you all to your labors.</p>

<p><i>She goes out along the terrace. Sempronius follows with her
knitting.</i></p>

<p>MAGNUS <i>[sitting down]</i> Be seated, ladies and gentlemen.</p>

<p><i>They take chairs of one sort or another where they can find them,
first leaving their hats on the balustrade. When they are seated, their
order from the King's right to his left is Nicobar, Crassus, Boanerges,
Amanda, the King, Proteus, Lysistrata, Pliny, and Balbus.</i></p>

<p><i>A pause, Proteus waiting for the King to begin. He, deep in
thought, says nothing. The silence becomes oppressive.</i></p>

<p>PLINY <i>[chattily]</i> Nice weather we're having, these
evenings.</p>

<p>AMANDA <i>[splutters]</i>!!!</p>

<p>MAGNUS. There is rather a threatening cloud on the western horizon,
Mr Pliny. <i>[To Proteus]</i> Have you heard the news from America?</p>

<p>PROTEUS. I have, sir.</p>

<p>MAGNUS. Am I to be favored with the advice of my ministers on that
subject?</p>

<p>PROTEUS. By your Majesty's leave, we will take the question of the
ultimatum first.</p>

<p>MAGNUS. Do you think the ultimatum will matter much when the capital
of the British Commonwealth is shifted to Washington?</p>

<p>NICOBAR. We'll see it shifted to Melbourne or Montreal or
Johannesburg first.</p>

<p>MAGNUS. It would not stay there. It will stay at a real centre of
gravity only.</p>

<p>PROTEUS. We are agreed about that. If it shifts at all it will shift
either west to Washington or east to Moscow.</p>

<p>BOANERGES. Moscow thinks a lot of itself. But what has Moscow to
teach us that we cannot teach ourselves? Moscow is built on English
history, written in London by Karl Marx.</p>

<p>PROTEUS. Yes; and the English king has sidetracked you again. <i>[To
Magnus]</i> What about the ultimatum, sir? You promised us your
decision at five o'clock. It is now a quarter past.</p>

<p>MAGNUS. Are you inexorably determined to force this issue to its
logical end? You know how unEnglish it is to do that?</p>

<p>PROTEUS. My people came from Scotland.</p>

<p>LYSISTRATA. I wish they had stayed there. I am English: every bone
in my body.</p>

<p>BOANERGES <i>[vociferously]</i> Same here!</p>

<p>PROTEUS. God help England if she had no Scots to think for her!</p>

<p>MAGNUS. What does the Cabinet say to that?</p>

<p>AMANDA. All their people came from Scotland or Ireland or Wales or
Jerusalem or somewhere, sir. It is no use appealing to English
sentiment here.</p>

<p>CRASSUS. Politics are not suited to the English, if you ask me.</p>

<p>MAGNUS. Then I, the only Englishman left in politics, apparently, am
to be reduced to complete nullity?</p>

<p>PROTEUS <i>[bluntly]</i> Yes. You cannot frighten us out of our
position by painting it red. I could paint your position black if I
liked. In plain terms we require from you an unconditional surrender.
If you refuse it then I go to the country on the question whether
England is to be an absolute monarchy or a constitutional one. We are
all agreed on that: there will be no resignations. I have letters from
the absent members of the Government: those present will speak for
themselves.</p>

<p>ALL THE OTHER MEN. Agreed, agreed.</p>

<p>PROTEUS. Now, what is your answer?</p>

<p>MAGNUS. The day for absolute monarchies is past. You think you can
do without me; and I know that I cannot do without you. I decide, of
course, in favor of a constitutional monarchy.</p>

<p>THE MEN <i>[greatly relieved and delighted]</i> Hear! hear!</p>

<p>MAGNUS. Wait a moment.</p>

<p><i>Sudden silence and mistrust.</i></p>

<p>PROTEUS. So! There is a catch in it, is there?</p>

<p>MAGNUS. Not exactly a catch. But you have driven me to face the fact
that I am unfitted to be a constitutional monarch. I am by nature
incapable of the necessary self-effacement.</p>

<p>AMANDA. Well, thats true, at all events. You and I are a pair,
sir.</p>

<p>MAGNUS. Thank you. Therefore, whilst accepting your constitutional
principle without the slightest reserve, I cannot sign your ultimatum,
because by doing so I should be making personal promises which I know I
should break--which in fact I must break because I have forces within
me which your constitutional limits cannot hold in check.</p>

<p>BALBUS. How can you accept our principle if you dont sign the
ultimatum?</p>

<p>MAGNUS. Oh, there is no difficulty about that. When an honest man
finds himself incapable of discharging the duties of a public post, he
resigns.</p>

<p>PROTEUS <i>[alarmed]</i> Resigns! What are you driving at?</p>

<p>CRASSUS. A king cannot resign.</p>

<p>NICOBAR. You might as well talk of beheading yourself. You cant
behead yourself.</p>

<p>BOANERGES. Other people can, though.</p>

<p>MAGNUS. Do not let us quarrel about words, gentlemen. I cannot
resign. But I can abdicate.</p>

<p>ALL THE REST <i>[starting to their feet]</i> Abdicate! <i>[They
stare at him in consternation].</i></p>

<p>AMANDA <i>[whistling a descending minor scale very expressively]</i>
!!!!!!!! <i>[She sits down].</i></p>

<p>MAGNUS. Of course, abdicate. Lysistrata: you have been a teacher of
history. You can assure your colleagues that there is nothing
unprecedented in an abdication. The Emperor Charles the Fifth, for
instance--</p>

<p>LYSISTRATA. Oh, Charles the Fifth be--be bothered! he's not good
enough. Sir: I have stood by you as far as I dared. Dont throw me over.
You must not abdicate. <i>[She sits down, distressed].</i></p>

<p>PROTEUS. You cannot abdicate except by my advice.</p>

<p>MAGNUS. I am acting upon your advice.</p>

<p>PROTEUS. Nonsense! <i>[He sits down].</i></p>

<p>BALBUS. Ridiculous! <i>[He sits down].</i></p>

<p>PLINY. Youre not serious, you know. <i>[He sits down].</i></p>

<p>NICOBAR. You cant upset the apple cart like this. <i>[He sits
down].</i></p>

<p>CRASSUS. I must say this is not playing the game. <i>[He sits
down].</i></p>

<p>BOANERGES <i>[powerfully]</i> Well, why not? Why not? Though as an
old Republican I have no respect for His Majesty as a King, I have a
great respect for him as a Strong Man. But he is not the only pebble on
the beach. Why not have done with this superstition of monarchy, and
bring the British Commonwealth into line with all the other great
Powers today as a republic? <i>[He sits down].</i></p>

<p>MAGNUS. My abdication does not involve that, Mr Boanerges. I am
abdicating to save the monarchy, not to destroy it. I shall be
succeeded by my son Robert, Prince of Wales. He will make an admirable
constitutional monarch.</p>

<p>PLINY. Oh, come! Dont be hard on the lad, sir. He has plenty of
brains.</p>

<p>MAGNUS. Oh yes, yes, yes: I did not mean that he is a nonentity:
quite the contrary: he is much cleverer than I am. But I have never
been able to induce him to take any interest in parliamentary politics.
He prefers intellectual pursuits.</p>

<p>NICOBAR. Dont you believe it. He is up to his neck in business.</p>

<p>MAGNUS. Just so. He asks me why I waste my time with you here
pretending to govern the country when it is really governed by
Breakages, Limited. And really I hardly know how to answer him.</p>

<p>CRASSUS. Things are like that nowadays. My son says just the
same.</p>

<p>LYSISTRATA. Personally I get on very well with the Prince; but
somehow I do not feel that he is interested in what I am doing.</p>

<p>BALBUS. He isnt. He wont interfere with you as long as you dont
interfere with him. Just the right king for us. Not pigheaded. Not
meddlesome. Thinks that nothing we do matters a rap. What do you say,
Joe?</p>

<p>PROTEUS. After all, why not? if your Majesty is in earnest.</p>

<p>MAGNUS. I assure you I am very much in earnest.</p>

<p>PROTEUS. Well, I confess I did not foresee this turn of events. But
I ought to have foreseen it. What your Majesty proposes is the
straightforward, logical, intellectually honest solution of our
difficulty. Consequently it is the last solution I could have expected
in politics. But I reckoned without your Majesty's character. The more
I think of it the more clearly I see that you are right--that you are
taking the only course open to you.</p>

<p>CRASSUS. I never said I was against it, Joe.</p>

<p>BALBUS. Neither did I.</p>

<p>NICOBAR. I think theres a great deal to be said for it. <i>I</i>
have no objection.</p>

<p>PLINY. One king is no worse than another, is he?</p>

<p>BOANERGES. Is he any better? The way you fellows scuttle backward
and forward from one mind to another whenever Joe holds up his finger
is disgusting. This is a Cabinet of sheep.</p>

<p>PROTEUS. Well, give the flock a better lead if you can. Have you
anything else to propose?</p>

<p>BOANERGES. I dont know that I have on the spur of the moment. We
should have had notice of this. But I suppose the King must do as he
thinks right.</p>

<p>PROTEUS. Then the goat goes with the sheep; so thats all right.</p>

<p>BOANERGES. Who are you calling a goat?</p>

<p>NICOBAR. If you come to that, who are you calling sheep?</p>

<p>AMANDA. Steady there, children! steady! steady! <i>[To the King]</i>
You have brought us all round, sir, as usual.</p>

<p>PROTEUS. There is nothing more to be said.</p>

<p>AMANDA. That means another half hour at least.</p>

<p>BOANERGES. Woman: this is not the moment for your tomfooleries.</p>

<p>PROTEUS <i>[impressively]</i> Bill is right, Amanda. <i>[He rises
and becomes the conventional House of Commons orator].</i></p>

<p><i>Ministers compose themselves to listen with grave attention, as
if in church; but Lysistrata is contemptuous and Amanda amused.</i></p>

<p>PROTEUS <i>[continuing]</i> It is a solemn moment. It is a moment in
which an old tie is being broken. I am not ashamed to confess that it
is a tie from which I have learned something.</p>

<p>MALE MINISTERS <i>[murmur]</i> Hear hear! Hear hear!</p>

<p>PROTEUS. For my own part--and I think I may speak for others here as
well--it has been no mere political tie, but a tie of sincere
friendship.</p>

<p><i>Renewed murmurs of sympathy. Increasing emotion.</i></p>

<p>PROTEUS. We have had our disagreements--as which of us has not?--but
they have been family quarrels.</p>

<p>CRASSUS. Thats all. Nothing more.</p>

<p>PROTEUS. May I say lovers' quarrels?</p>

<p>PLINY <i>[wiping his eyes]</i> You may, Joe. You may.</p>

<p>PROTEUS. My friends, we came here to a meeting. We find, alas! that
the meeting is to be a leavetaking. <i>[Crassus sniffs tearfully].</i>
It is a sad leavetaking on our part, but a cordial one. [Hear Hear
<i>from Pliny].</i> We are cast down, but not discouraged. Looking back
to the past with regret, we can still look forward to the future with
hope. That future has its dangers and its difficulties. It will bring
us new problems; and it will bring us face to face with a new king. But
the new problems and the new king will not make us forget our old
counsellor, monarch, and--he will allow me to say--comrade. [Hear Hears
<i>ad libitum</i>]. I know my words will find an echo in all your
hearts when I conclude by saying that whatsoever king shall reign--</p>

<p>AMANDA. Youll be the Vicar of Bray, Joe.</p>

<p><i>Uproar. Proteus flings himself into his chair
indignantly.</i></p>

<p>BALBUS. Shame!</p>

<p>NICOBAR. Shut up, you b--</p>

<p>PLINY. A joke's a joke; but really--</p>

<p>CRASSUS. Too bad, Amanda! Behave yourself.</p>

<p>LYSISTRATA. She has a perfect right to speak. You are a parcel of
sentimental fools.</p>

<p>BOANERGES <i>[rising]</i> Silence. Order.</p>

<p>AMANDA. Sorry.</p>

<p>BOANERGES. So you ought to be. Where's your manners? Where's your
education? King Magnus: we part; but we part as strong men part: as
friends. The Prime Minister has correctly represented the sentiments of
all the men present. I call on them to express those sentiments in the
good old English fashion. <i>[Singing in stentorian tones]</i>
Fo-o-o-o-r-r-r</p>

<p>MALE MINISTERS EXCEPT PROTEUS <i>[rising and singing]</i></p>

<blockquote>
<p>--he's a jolly good fel-low<br>
 For he's a jolly good fel-low<br>
 For he's--</p>
</blockquote>

<p>MAGNUS <i>[peremptorily]</i> Stop. Stop.</p>

<p><i>Sudden silence and misgiving. They sit down furtively.</i></p>

<p>MAGNUS. I thank you with all my heart; but there is a
misapprehension. We are not taking leave of one another. I have no
intention of withdrawing from an active part in politics.</p>

<p>PROTEUS. What!!</p>

<p>MAGNUS. You are looking on me, with an emotion which has deeply
touched me, as a man with a political past. But I look on myself rather
as a man with a political future. I have not yet told you my plans.</p>

<p>NICOBAR. What plans?</p>

<p>BALBUS. A retired king cant have plans and a future.</p>

<p>MAGNUS. Why not? I am looking forward to a most exciting and
enjoyable time. As I shall of course dissolve parliament, the fun will
begin with a general election.</p>

<p>BOANERGES <i>[dismayed]</i> But Ive only just been elected. Do you
mean that I shall have to stand two elections in one month? Have you
thought of the expenses?</p>

<p>MAGNUS. Surely your expenses will be paid by the State.</p>

<p>BOANERGES. Paid by the State! Is that all you know about
electioneering in England?</p>

<p>PROTEUS. You will get your whack out of the party funds, Bill; and
if you cant find the extras you must put up with straight votes. Go on,
sir: we want to hear about those plans of yours.</p>

<p>MAGNUS. My last act of royal authority will be to divest myself of
all titles and dignities; so that I may step down at once into the
position of a commoner.</p>

<p>BOANERGES. Step up, you mean. The common man is the superior, not
the inferior, of the titled man.</p>

<p>MAGNUS. That is why I am going to make myself a common man, Mr
Boanerges.</p>

<p>PLINY. Well, it does you honor.</p>

<p>CRASSUS. Not all of us would be capable of a sacrifice like
that.</p>

<p>BOANERGES. A fine gesture, sir. A fine gesture. I admit it.</p>

<p>PROTEUS <i>[suspicious]</i> And since when, pray, has your Majesty
taken to making gestures? Whats the game this time?</p>

<p>BOANERGES. Shame!</p>

<p>PROTEUS. Shut up, you gaby. <i>[To the King]</i> I say, whats the
game?</p>

<p>MAGNUS. There is no imposing on you, Prime Minister. The game is, of
course, that when I come back into politics I shall be in a better
position as a commoner than as a peer. I shall seek a parliamentary
seat.</p>

<p>PROTEUS. You in the House of Commons!</p>

<p>MAGNUS <i>[blandly]</i> It is my intention to offer myself to the
Royal Borough of Windsor as a candidate at the forthcoming General
Election.</p>

<p><i>All the rest except Boanerges and the ladies rise in
consternation.</i></p>

<p>PROTEUS. This is treachery.</p>

<p>BALBUS. A dirty trick.</p>

<p>NICOBAR. The meanest on record.</p>

<p>PLINY. He'll be at the top of the poll.</p>

<p>CRASSUS. There wont be any poll: it will be a walkover.</p>

<p>BALBUS. This shews what all your fine manners and friendly ways are
worth.</p>

<p>NICOBAR. Hypocrite!</p>

<p>CRASSUS. Humbug!</p>

<p>LYSISTRATA. I wish your Majesty every success.</p>

<p>AMANDA. Hear hear! Fair play, boys. Why shouldnt he go into
parliament with us?</p>

<p>BOANERGES. Well said! well said! Why not?</p>

<p>THE OTHER MALE MINISTERS. Ya-a-a-ah! <i>[They sit down in utter
disgust].</i></p>

<p>PROTEUS <i>[very sullen]</i> And when you are in Parliament, what
then?</p>

<p>MAGNUS. There are several possibilities. I shall naturally endeavor
to form a party. My son King Robert will have to call on some Party
leader who can depend on the support of the House of Commons to form a
Government. He may call on you. He may even call on me.</p>

<p>AMANDA <i>[breaks the glum silence by whistling a bar or two of the
National Anthem]</i>!!</p>

<p>MAGNUS. Whatever happens, it will be a great relief to us to be able
to speak out quite frankly about oneanother in public. You have never
been able to tell the British people what you really think of me: no
real criticism of the King is possible. I have never been able to speak
my mind as to your various capacities and characters. All that reserve,
that tedious affectation, that unwholesome concealment will end. I hope
you look forward to our new footing as pleasurably as I do.</p>

<p>LYSISTRATA. I am delighted, sir. You will fight Breakages for
me.</p>

<p>AMANDA. It will be awful fun.</p>

<p>BOANERGES. Now, Mr Prime Minister, we are waiting for you. What have
you to say about it?</p>

<p>PROTEUS <i>[rising and speaking slowly, with his brows deeply
knitted]</i> Has Your Majesty got that ultimatum on you?</p>

<p>MAGNUS <i>[produces it from his breast pocket and presents it to
him]</i>!</p>

<p>PROTEUS <i>[with measured emphasis, after tearing the paper up into
four pieces at two deliberate strokes, and throwing the pieces
away]</i> There is not going to be any abdication. There is not going
to be any general election. There is not going to be any ultimatum. We
go on as before. The crisis is a washout. <i>[To the King, with deadly
concentration]</i> I will never forgive you for this. You stole your
ace of trumps from the hand I played this morning. <i>[He takes his hat
from the balustrade and goes away through the park].</i></p>

<p>BOANERGES <i>[rising]</i> That was a very deplorable exhibition of
temper on the part of the Prime Minister, sir. It was not the gesture
of a Strong Man. I will remonstrate with him. You may depend on me.
<i>[He takes his hat and follows Proteus in a serious and dignified
manner].</i></p>

<p>NICOBAR <i>[rising]</i> Well, I shall not say what I think. <i>[He
is taking his hat when the King addresses him].</i></p>

<p>MAGNUS. So I have not upset the apple cart after all, Mr
Nicobar.</p>

<p>NICOBAR. You can upset it as soon as you like for all I care. I am
going out of politics. Politics is a mug's game. <i>[He goes].</i></p>

<p>CRASSUS <i>[rising reluctantly and taking his hat]</i> If Nick goes,
I shall have to go too.</p>

<p>MAGNUS. Can you really tear yourself away from politics?</p>

<p>CRASSUS. Only too glad to be well out of them, if Breakages will let
me. They shoved me into it; and I daresay theyll find another job for
me. <i>[He goes].</i></p>

<p>PLINY <i>[cheerful to the last as he, too, goes for his hat]</i>
Well, I am glad nothing's happened. You know, sir, nothing ever really
does happen in the Cabinet. Never mind their bit of temper. Theyll feed
out of your hand tomorrow. <i>[He goes].</i></p>

<p>BALBUS <i>[after taking his hat]</i> Now that theyre all gone I dont
mind saying that if anything should ever happen to the throne, and your
Majesty should become a President with a Cabinet to pick, you might
easily find a worse Home Secretary than me, with all my faults.</p>

<p>MAGNUS. I shall bear it in mind. By the way, if you should happen to
overtake the Prime Minister, will you be so good as to remind him that
we quite forgot to settle that little affair of the proposal of America
to annex the British Commonwealth.</p>

<p>BALBUS. By the Lord, so we did! Well, thats a good one! Ha ha! Ha ha
ha ha ha! <i>[He goes out laughing heartily].</i></p>

<p>MAGNUS. They dont take it in, Lizzie: not one bit. It is as if
another planet were crashing into us. The kingdom and the power and the
glory will pass from us and leave us naked, face to face with our real
selves at last.</p>

<p>LYSISTRATA. So much the better, if by our real selves you mean the
old English stock that was unlike any other. Nowadays men all over the
world are as much alike as hotel dinners. It's no use pretending that
the America of George Washington is going to swallow up the England of
Queen Anne. The America of George Washington is as dead as Queen Anne.
What they call an American is only a wop pretending to be a Pilgrim
Father. He is no more Uncle Jonathan than you are John Bull.</p>

<p>MAGNUS. Yes: we live in a world of wops, all melting into one
another; and when all the frontiers are down London may be outvoted by
Tennessee, and all the other places where we still madly teach our
children the mentality of an eighteenth century village school.</p>

<p>LYSISTRATA. Never fear, sir. It is not the most ignorant national
crowd that will come out on top, but the best power station; for you
cant do without power stations, and you cant run them on patriotic
songs and hatred of the foreigner, and guff and bugaboo, though you can
run nationalism on nothing else. But I am heartbroken at your not
coming into the House with us to keep old England in front and lead a
new Party against Breakages <i>[tears come into her eyes].</i></p>

<p>MAGNUS <i>[patting her consolingly on the back]</i> That would have
been splendid, wouldnt it? But I am too old fashioned. This is a farce
that younger men must finish.</p>

<p>AMANDA <i>[taking her arm]</i> Come home with me, dear. I will sing
to you until you cant help laughing. Come.</p>

<p><i>Lysistrata pockets her handkerchief; shakes the King's hands
impulsively; and goes with Amanda. The King plunges into deep thought.
Presently the Queen comes back.</i></p>

<p>THE QUEEN. Now Magnus: it's time to dress for dinner.</p>

<p>MAGNUS <i>[much disturbed]</i> Oh, not now. I have something very
big to think about. I dont want any dinner.</p>

<p>THE QUEEN <i>[peremptorily]</i> No dinner! Did anyone ever hear of
such a thing! You know you will not sleep if you think after seven
o'clock.</p>

<p>MAGNUS <i>[worried]</i> But really, Jemima--</p>

<p>THE QUEEN <i>[going to him and taking his arm]</i> Now, now, now!
dont be naughty. I musnt be late for dinner. Come on, like a good
little boy.</p>

<p><i>The King, with a grimace of hopeless tenderness, allows himself
to be led away.</i></p>

<h1><a name="e01">Mr Shaw Replies to His Critics</a></h1>
</center>

<p> </p>

<blockquote>
<p>(Written statement, presented as interview, <i>Daily Mail,</i>
London, 21 August 1929)</p>
</blockquote>

<p> </p>

<p><i>Mr Bernard Shaw laughingly declined to discuss the Press notices
of his new play, "The Apple Cart," when I saw him this evening. "Surely
you have formed some opinion about it all?" I asked. He
replied:</i></p>

<p>Well, I am very pleased with the nice notices, but what can I say on
the subject? It is getting an extremely serious matter nowadays.</p>

<p>In the old days one used to write a play and have it produced and
criticised and there was an end of it. But now the Press has been
clamouring throughout the day for a statement of what I think about the
critics' reviews.</p>

<p>One can only say that the people had better read the criticisms of
the play and criticise the critics for themselves.</p>

<p>I am an old dramatic critic so that I know all about it.</p>

<p>Of course I read the criticisms, and if the critics say anything
helpful I should be prepared to make use of it, but that does not
usually happen.</p>

<p>Whatever they said, I should not rewrite the play. When I had
finished writing it I had said exactly what I wanted to say.</p>

<p>Some of the criticisms might have been better done. There are
different sorts.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<h1><a name="e02">A Walk and a Talk with Mr Shaw</a></h1>
</center>

<p> </p>

<blockquote>
<p>(Interview by G. W. Bishop, large portions of which were provided by
Shaw in written statements, <i>The Observer,</i> London, 8 September
1929)</p>
</blockquote>

<p> </p>

<p>No play, not even any other one of Mr. Shaw's, has been talked about
so much as "The Apple Cart"; it is all so like the epilogue to "Fanny's
First Play"! "Shaw--what I've always told you about Shaw." . . . "Let's
talk about Shaw"--for the last three weeks has been the favourite
occupation of everybody who saw the play at Malvern, and of a good many
who didn't.</p>

<p>I enjoyed the play so much that I made a special journey to
Birmingham on Monday last to see it again. I travelled up with Cedric
Hardwicke (who plays King Magnus), and Charles Carson (the Prime
Minister), and on the journey we talked about Shaw; at supper after the
performance we met again and, until the early hours, again talked about
Shaw. At another table there were two other members of the cast--also,
I am certain, talking about Shaw, and when I met Miss Edith Evans, who
takes the part of Orinthia, we plunged at once into the subject of the
moment and started discussing the controversial second act.</p>

<p>Nobody, of course, talks more illuminatingly, more amusingly, more
provocatively or more interestingly about Shaw than G. B. S. himself.
And it was Cedric Hardwicke's idea that we should continue the
discussion the following day at Malvern, where the author of "The Apple
Cart" was staying on for a few days of recuperating from the excitement
of watching his own plays for a fortnight. There was something that
Hardwicke wanted to ask him; I had a hundred things I wanted to talk to
Mr Shaw about.</p>

<center>
<p>* * * * *</p>
</center>

<p>Shaw is, of course, the kindest, gentlest, and most courteous person
living. He finds it difficult to refuse anybody anything--except
newspaper men seeking an interview--and even then, if he is without the
protection of his secretary. . . .</p>

<p>Perhaps it was because I came clinging to Hardwicke's mudguard, as
it were: I like to think, however, that it was for my own sake--sublime
vanity!--that he said when we arrived: "I feel stuffy; will you let me
take you for a walk while Hardwicke entertains Mrs. Shaw!"</p>

<p>Away we strode. With some difficulty I managed to keep up with his
pace; it was with considerably more difficulty that I could keep up
with his talk. We happened to pass a cinema poster and I mentioned the
"talkies." "Of course the 'talkies' have come to stay," he said; "a
producer can spend &pound;50,000 on a talking film, and is often
guaranteed most of what he has spent before it is released, and it is
bound to take the place of an ordinary stage production, upon which
&pound;50 has been spent."</p>

<center>
<p>* * * * *</p>
</center>

<p>"But surely theatre-goers will still demand the three-dimensional
actor?" I suggested.</p>

<p>"Certainly," he replied, "but not the same person. The ordinary
actor--as such--is unsuitable for talking film work. It is an entirely
different technique. I tested that for myself. When I was shown the
first picture I made I said to the producer, 'This is ludicrous; it is
all wrong; it isn't me at all.' He replied: 'The camera cannot lie.' To
which I retorted: 'The camera can lie and it has.' I then realised that
in order to present a talking picture of Shaw I had to master a new
method of moving and talking. If one acts naturally the result is
simply--fussy.</p>

<p>"Look at the pictures taken of street scenes in the animated
gazettes. The people who are walking give the impression of moving
their legs quickly and running like this"--here Mr. Shaw illustrated
what he meant--"whereas a movie actor has to walk in this way"--a few
solemn steps were then "registered" in the middle of Malvern--"and the
result on the screen is the ordinary natural walk. The screen magnifies
and intensifies, and the technique is an entirely different one from
the stage. 'Movie' actresses like Mary Pickford are clever enough not
to appear on the stage without the glorious intensification of the
camera. She knows that her public would consider that the real Mary
Pickford is an insignificant person. She isn't, of course, but having
always seen her magnified it would be like looking at her suddenly
through the wrong end of the telescope.</p>

<center>
<p>* * * * *</p>
</center>

<p>"'Movie' acting is a different art," Mr. Shaw went on; "mainly it is
the art of not moving at all! Then, along came the 'talkies,' and in
rushed the ordinary 'movie' actor, and he has, on the whole, failed
because he knows all about the reproduction of movement, but nothing
about the voice. The stage actor, as such, is no good, and we shall
have to breed a new race of 'talkie' actors and, what is more
important, a race of intelligent producers."</p>

<p>"You will then allow your plays to be made into 'talkies'?"</p>

<p>"I know it is possible to reproduce dialogue, and it is now
established that action can be reproduced on the screen. When it is as
certain that the actual performers have mastered the technique and that
there are some artistic producers who also understand the technique I
shall consent."</p>

<p>"Don't you think that authors will have to write specifically for
the screen?" I asked him as we finished our round and got back to the
hotel.</p>

<p>"Possibly. I may write a 'talkie' myself, but I see no reason, given
the conditions I have mentioned, that 'The Apple Cart' should not be
reproduced exactly as it is written."</p>

<p>We had been out for nearly half an hour and I have only given the
bare bones, a slight impression, of a talk which illuminated the whole
subject as far as I was concerned. It gives little idea of the witty
phrase, the apt illustration and Mr. Shaw's description of the
banalities of the average moving picture.</p>

<center>
<p>* * * * *</p>
</center>

<p>Inside, Mrs. Shaw was waiting for us with tea and we plunged into
the subject of "The Apple Cart" at once. I mentioned the
criticisms.</p>

<p>"Critics rely very much on labels," Mr. Shaw said. "I was not shown
a proof of the programme and therefore the sub-title which will be
printed when the play is seen in London, was omitted. The full title
should have read: 'The Apple Cart--A Political Extravaganza in Two Acts
and an Interlude.' The word 'extravaganza' would have helped them and
they might then have been less worried by the short second act."</p>

<p>"Although it is an 'extravaganza' the play has a serious
background?" I said.</p>

<p>"So serious that I intend to tell Mr. MacDonald when he returns from
Geneva that he must refuse to take any young man into his Cabinet who
hasn't seen 'The Apple Cart' at least six times. It is intended as a
salutary lesson, as I feel it is a state of things into which we could
drift.</p>

<center>
<p>* * * * *</p>
</center>

<p>"Few of the critics have realised that one of the points of the play
is the recognition that there is no governing class. By which I mean
the real governors are not a class, but are members of all classes. The
King sees at once that Boanerges, who was picked out of the gutter by a
policeman, is of the governing class. The great revelation that comes
to Boanerges is that the King is also a member of the governing class.
The 'plain-man' joke between the King and Boanerges has upset one or
two people, but as a matter of fact it is a piece of tactful diplomacy
on the part of the King. 'I'm a plain man,' boasts Boanerges. 'Not at
all,' protests the King--the usual joke, it is asserted--but the King,
after a pause, adds, 'you are anything but plain; in fact, to me, you
have always been an enigma.' This flatters Boanerges, and puts him at
his ease.</p>

<p>"Curiously, too, the Prime Minister has been called a dummy and a
fool. But Proteus is really a very elaborate study of an able man. The
King represents the classical example of the governing type; Proteus
the womanly type--'I use the word woman,' Mr. Shaw added to his wife,
'in the stage sense'. He is hysterical and gets flustered, but he jumps
at the true position of things at once, as I show at the end of the
play, when he immediately grasps the fact that the King has beaten
them. In the first act, too, Proteus and the King, in the two minutes
they have alone together, arrive at a complete understanding. More is
accomplished in that time than in the half an hour's previous
talk."</p>

<center>
<p>* * * * *</p>
</center>

<p>"But the main oversight in the criticism of 'The Apple Cart,'" Mr.
Shaw said, "is the failure to grasp the significance of the fact that
the King wins, not <i>qua</i> King, but <i>qua</i> potential Commoner.
The tearing up of the ultimatum is almost a defeat for him. It is
certainly a defeat for Lysistrata (the Power Mistress), whose
depression the King shares when the shouting is over.</p>

<p>"The critics have also missed the point of Boanerges' refusal to
listen to a word against the Democracy which he himself ridiculed as an
instrument of popular government. The Strong Man is a democrat because
Democracy places power within his reach. As Magnus expressly says,
Democracy has destroyed responsible government and gives the power to
(as Bunyan put it) 'him that can get it.' 'Yourself, sir, for
instance?' says Lysistrata. 'I think I am in the running,' replies the
King.' But the great point is that he thinks he is in the running as
Able Man, not as monarch. Only once in the whole play does Magnus
assume royal authority, and that is in the interlude when he cries,
'Orinthia, I command you.' And then both Orinthia and the audience
laugh him to scorn.</p>

<p>"No serious student of how monarchy and democracy actually work will
demur to my handling of them," Mr. Shaw added.</p>

<p>"The protests that have actually been made sound as if George Odger
had risen from his grave. But you have probably never heard of George
Odger*--"</p>

<p> </p>

<p>* George Odger was born in 1820 and died in 1877. He was one of the
early trade-unionists who exercised remarkable influence on the labour
movement. He became a member of the National Reform League and helped
to organise a popular welcome to Garibaldi in 1862, and the great
meeting in St. James's Hall in support of the Northern States of
America against slavery. He made five unsuccessful attempts to get into
Parliament as an independent labour candidate. His funeral was the
occasion of a great demonstration by the London working men, who
regarded him as their leader. [Note by G. W. Bishop]</p>

<center>
<p>* * * * *</p>
</center>

<p>"Now, about the second act--the interlude?"</p>

<p>"Composers are permitted a slow second movement in their symphony;
why shouldn't I be allowed one in my composition?" Mr. Shaw protested.
"Or, if you prefer it, the second act is a piece of relief, comic
relief, if you like. What has the grave-diggers' scene to do with the
character of Hamlet? But Shakespeare understood what I understand--if
you put humour into a play it must be cheap humour!"</p>

<p>"The second act has, of course, a great dramatic significance, as
great a significance as the porter's scene in 'Macbeth.' It completes
the portrait of the King who in the middle of the crisis is seen, not
merely as a statesman but as a human being with a domestic life."</p>

<p>Here Mr. Hardwicke suggested that the King held the Cabinet in the
third act with some of Orinthia's powder still on his uniform.
"Symbolically, yes," Mr. Shaw said, "nevertheless, Hardwicke, I hope
that you will always brush your coat before the third act. The King
knows that in married life the important thing is the recognition of
the other's limitations. There are some subjects he cannot talk about
to Jemima, his wife, and, on the other hand, the beautiful Orinthia
certainly has <i>her</i> limitations. It is an important scene, and not
there merely to amuse. I can only conclude that the critics who did not
understand it are happily married to wives who combine in themselves
Orinthia and Jemima. The average man is not so fortunate. There are
hundreds of nice middle-class families who do not understand why they
squabble. The scene between the King and Orinthia will serve as a dose
of castor oil. Shakespeare suggested the same idea when Beatrice says,
in reply to Don Pedro's proposal, 'No, my lord, unless I might have
another for workingdays: your grace is too costly to wear every day.'
Jemima, intellectually, is good for every-day wear, and Magnus knows
this; Orinthia is the splendid Sunday relaxation. Married people will
get on better after they have seen the second act of 'The Apple
Cart.'"</p>

<center>
<p>* * * * *</p>
</center>

<p>We might have gone on for hours if Cedric Hardwicke had not suddenly
remembered that in an hour or two he would be acting the King (instead
of talking about him) on the stage of the Birmingham Repertory
Theatre.</p>

<p>After he had waved us farewell it occurred to me that the author of
"The Apple Cart" did not know that he was being "interviewed." When he
sees this totally inadequate account of the talk in print he may blame
Hardwicke for taking me over to Malvern. Mr. Shaw will not be too
severe, I feel, because he admires the actor's performance as King
Magnus tremendously.</p>

<h1><a name="e03">Bernard Shaw's Denial</a></h1>
</center>

<p> </p>

<blockquote>
<p>(Statement to the press, <i>The Star,</i> London, 30 September
1929)</p>
</blockquote>

<p> </p>

<p>The report of a conversation I had with a prominent Polish
journalist which has been sent by Reuter and published in several
papers, makes it necessary for me to offer one or two elucidations.</p>

<p>I seem to have conveyed to my distinguished foreign visitor that the
Prime Minister discussed 'The Apple Cart' with me after the
performance, and that I intended to base King Magnus on the personality
of Marshal Pilsudski, but refrained lest it should be said that the
Marshal had paid me to do so.</p>

<p>I also seem to have conveyed that the play has not been received
here with the enthusiasm it evoked in Poland.</p>

<p>This is not precisely what I meant to say. I have not spoken to the
Prime Minister since he was present on the first night, when we
exchanged a few words before the rise of the curtain.</p>

<p>I cannot claim the privilege of personal acquaintance with Marshal
Pilsudski. I never dreamt of using him, or any other living person, as
a model, though every living ruler in the world will find a melancholy
resemblance between his predicament and that of King Magnus.</p>

<p>I cannot avoid the suggestion that I have been paid by him, because
it has already been made, and will probably be repeated, mutatis
mutandis in every country where the play is produced.</p>

<p>Finally, as to the alleged more enthusiastic reception of 'The Apple
Cart' in Poland than in London, all I can say is that the reception in
London has reached its box-office limit, and that Polish enthusiasm,
however frenzied, can go no further from the author's point of
view.</p>

<p>Naturally I am glad to learn that King Magnus's Crown fits the heads
of all the rulers and that his subjects in all lands vie with one
another in appreciation of my picture of their political situation.
That is all I need say at present.</p>

<i>The Observer,</i> London, 23 March 1930)</p>

<p> </p>

<p>"'The Apple Cart' is laid in the future. There seems to be confusion
about the approximate date. Is it--as was suggested before the play was
produced--at a time when all people now living are dead?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Do you seriously think that democracy may drift into the state of
things shown in the play?"</p>

<p>"It has already drifted into it."</p>

<p>"Is not the tendency in this country towards a bigger percentage of
voting and a more enlightened use of the franchise?"</p>

<p>"The tendency to disuse the franchise is so strong that in some
countries it is a punishable offence not to vote. People vote in times
of great social strain for which the government is blamed. The newly
enfranchised (the women, for instance) vote whilst the novelty lasts.
But in a condition of general satisfaction, or of general disgust at
the failure of political parties to make good their promises, people
will not vote. In the old vestries, for which anybody could vote, a
little ring of men used to meet and elect one another without the
interference of a single general elector. Shareholders' meetings are
very much the same. Do <i>you</i> ever vote?"</p>

<p> </p>

<p>THE IDEAL RULER</p>

<p> </p>

<p>"You do not believe, I assume, that a benevolent monarchy is a
better form of government than a democracy? Do you think the veto of a
hereditary ruler is a valuable safeguard in any self-governing country?
Is the ideal government when the two work smoothly together?"</p>

<p>"Benevolent monarchies and democracies are idealisations which have
never been realised. Even government itself is a very imperfectly
realised ideal. Benevolence is not a qualification for rulership at
all: capable rulers have often been infernal scoundrels, and benevolent
monarchs hopelessly incapable rulers.</p>

<p>"The veto of a hereditary ruler has no value as a safeguard. The
veto of a capable ruler, whether he be hereditary monarch, dictator,
president, prime minister, or chief constable of a county, has the
value of his capacity.</p>

<p>"The desideratum is a method of government in which the governed
choose their rulers and can change them, but in which only capable
persons are eligible for choice or change. Hereditary monarchy
obviously cannot supply this. The notion that adult suffrage can supply
it has been reduced to absurdity by experience. It is worse than
hereditary monarchy, which may accidentally and occasionally produce a
capable ruler, whereas adult suffrage, through the general dislike of
capable rulers, and the popularity of agreeable and extravagant
ne'er-do-weels (compare William the Conqueror with King Stephen),
positively prevents capable rulers from entering politics, and exalts
Titus Oateses to commanding positions."</p>

<p> </p>

<p>THE ENGLISH-SPEAKING PEOPLES</p>

<p> </p>

<p>"Would the United States be better off with a hereditary
monarchy?"</p>

<p>"What sort of monarchy? Constitutional or Autocratic. The question
in a practical form would be, 'Are the United States better off than
the British Commonwealth?' The useless but only possible answer is, 'In
some respects, yes; in others, no.' Evidently the difference is not
great enough to produce a demand in either country for the form of
government used in the other."</p>

<p>"Is America gradually annexing Great Britain? Can you conceive that
a day will come when there will be an Empire of the English--or
American--speaking peoples?"</p>

<p>"America is certainly Americanising Great Britain more than Europe
is Europeanising it. In fact, America is Americanising Europe, whilst
remaining itself blatantly American. Asia and Africa are not in the
running. Russia is America's only rival as a basic civilising
influence.</p>

<p>"Whether the United States will ever include all the States and
Dominions in which English is the language of the people, is still a
matter for speculation. It is not impossible. But, so far, it cannot be
said that the bond of Western European civilisation is weaker than the
bond of language. And do not forget that the Marxian dream of a
world-wide proletarian revolution, though it is not now practical
politics, may yet upset all our conceptions of international relations.
The Reformation did not seem practicable in the Middle Ages; but it
happened for all that."</p>

<p> </p>

<p>GERMAN OBJECTIONS</p>

<p> </p>

<p>"You told me when we met a short time ago that the most violent
objections to 'The Apple Cart' came from the Social Democrats in
Germany. Would you care to reply to those objections?"</p>

<p>"I don't know what they are. The idea seems to be that as a democrat
I should have made the King the villain of the piece. Even if I were a
democrat in the sense of believing that good government is secured by
giving Jack and Jill a vote, which I am not and have never pretended to
be, the idea would still seem childish to me. My business is not to
satirise the vices of an autocracy which does not exist, but those of
the pseudo-democracy which does exist."</p>

<p>"Were the members of the Cabinet dressed in fancy dress in the
English production to meet the requirements of the Lord
Chamberlain?"</p>

<p>"No. The Lord Chamberlain made no requirements. The play was
licensed without demur at the first asking, quite unconditionally. The
fancy dresses, in so far as they are not purely decorative, were
prescribed by the author to remove the play as far as possible from the
Cabinet and Court of to-day."</p>

<p>"When I saw the play for the third time recently, I thought that the
curtain should have come down when the King is left alone on the stage?
I felt that the entrance of the Queen was an anti-climax."</p>

<p>"Max Reinhardt, in Berlin, thought so, too, and did what you in your
masculine idiocy suggest. Ask any woman what she thinks of your brains
and Max's."</p>

<p> </p>

<p>NO NEW PLAY AT PRESENT</p>

<p> </p>

<p>"Is it true that 'The Apple Cart' is the first of a trilogy and that
a new play by you may be seen at the Malvern festival this year?"</p>

<p>"No, there is no question of a trilogy. I will write another play
for Malvern if I can; but as I am under contract to complete certain
literary work involving prolonged labour this spring, it seems almost
impossible that I can be in time for the Festival with a new play this
year. It will have to be a very hasty one, in any case. I have not had
time to give a thought to it yet."</p>

<p>"Has the play a special message for American audiences?"</p>

<p>"It has a special message for all audiences--even American
ones."</p>

<p> </p>

<blockquote>
<p>(Replies to a questionnaire by John Rintoul Hunt, <i>Courier,</i>
London, Autumn 1943)</p>
</blockquote>

<p> </p>

<p><i>In</i> The Apple-Cart, <i>Mr. Shaw, you dramatised in prophetic
fashion the prospect of the British Empire and the United States of
America re-uniting at no very distant date. That was in 1928-9, some
fifteen years ago. Now, under the pressure of world catastrophes, and
in spite of the handicap of a common history and a common language
(more or less), the two countries are closer in spirit as well as in
material matters than they have been for more than a century and a
half. What do you imagine is the likeliest next move?</i></p>

<p>The imagined next move never takes place: so I do not waste my time
imagining it. The situation in The Apple-Cart made a good last act for
a comedy; but if I had wanted one for the first act of a tragedy I
should have made England renew the old alliance with Japan made by the
late Lord Lansdowne, followed by the immediate secession of New
Zealand, Australia, South Africa, and Canada from the British
Commonwealth and their federation with the United States in a defensive
combination against Japan. Nobody who has not been to the Pacific has
the faintest notion of what Japan means there.</p>

<p><i>Of course, as you realised at the time, some pretty
constitutional problems would be set if ever the subject came up for
debate by statesmen and lawyers, those wise but unpractical dreamers.
Your "King Magnus" was put in the very devil of embarrassment when
Vanhattan, the U.S. Ambassador, came bounding in with his demand, or
ultimatum, that the U.S.A. be received back in the Empire and the
Declaration of Independence and the Acts relating thereto be cancelled.
Have you any idea how the lawyers would get round such difficulties as
the American Constitution and the Statute of Westminster?</i></p>

<p>Not at all. There would be no trouble about that if both sides meant
business. If they did not, then of course the lawyers and diplomatists
would have no difficulty in proving that the thing is utterly
impossible, or would take fifty years to work out. But if the two
Governments were in earnest, they would just do it, and leave the
rearrangements to follow the event, as they would have to, difficulties
or no difficulties. The Statute of Westminster and the American
Constitution are only scraps of paper; but facts are facts.</p>

<p><i>On the other hand, Americans--or quite a number of them--might
prefer that the United Kingdom were admitted to the Union as the 49th
State? And the self-governing Dominions as the 50th, 51st, 52nd and so
on. With the Crown Colonies and India given a similar status to that of
the Philippines.</i></p>

<p>The old nomenclatures need not be preserved. Why should they, seeing
that they will only make trouble?</p>

<p><i>Where would you fit Ireland into the new scheme of things, Mr
Shaw? In</i> The Apple-Cart, <i>the Queen was so shocked at the whole
proposal that she could only envisage the Court taking refuge in
Dublin. That, I venture, was not suggested in all seriousness, was it?
Would Belfast take Dublin's place? Or perhaps as a compromise the
ancient glories of Tara or Galway be revived?</i></p>

<p>Eire will have to fit itself into any change as best it can. Its
military forces are too small to be considered by the big powers who
will dominate the situation. It owes its present neutrality to the
Partition, which gives England a foothold in the island, that would
otherwise have had to be taken by force by either England or America.
Ireland must live by her wits, which means that she must have
alliances; but as she cannot ally herself with Japan or Germany her
choice is restricted practically to England and America. And England is
much more easily humbugged or bullied or coaxed than America. As to
Dublin, which is within half an hour of the most enchanting mountain
and seaside scenery, it is in these days of air transit one of the
pleasantest seats of Government in the world. There is nothing wrong
with it except its slums with their shocking vital statistics, and the
perpetual derisive gabble of its inhabitants.</p>

<p><i>There is one aspect, referred to in</i> The Apple-Cart, <i>which
we have not touched on here--the attitude of the British Dominions. On
a Gallup Poll taken in Canada this year slightly more than 20 per cent.
of those canvassed for their views opted for inclusion in the United
States. Opinion in Australia seems to favour closer links with the U.S.
and to feel that Britain is too distant to afford permanent protection
against the Japs. South Africa, after Smuts, may experience a reaction
and desire a change of allegiance. What do you think, Mr. Shaw?</i></p>

<p>These are talking points. The Dominions will have to take what they
can get, which will be by no means all they want.</p>

<p><i>Finally, what of Moscow? This is a little aside from the main
discussion. My excuse for troubling you is not merely that Moscow
cannot be left out of any discussion anyway but also that in your play
Moscow through your character, Boanerges, came prominently into it. Our
statesmen, willy-nilly, have blundered into cooperation with Soviet
Russia as well as perilously close to Anglo-American reunion--ought we
not to see they don't blunder out of it again?</i></p>

<p>When the war is over Moscow will be cock of the walk, but at the
cost of internal damage that will keep her too busy at home to make
trouble for herself abroad, provided always that her Western frontiers
are accepted as they stood before the German attack. Stalin has been
explicit and emphatic about that from the beginning. Moscow will be
strong enough to impose that condition. The question of whether Hong
Kong is to be British or Chinese may prove more troublesome.</p>

<p><i>(Boanerges in the play was not a Russian; he was a vivid
caricature of the late John Burns.)</i></p>

<p><i>Thank you, Mr. Shaw. The world has been transformed in the past
50 years, chiefly through your plays, and perhaps in another 50</i>
<i>years we shall all be good sensible Shavians. Isn't it true that
history is made from the 50-year plans of poets and philosophers rather
than the 5-year plans of sanitary engineers and production
experts?</i></p>

<p>Until the poets know all about sanitary engineering and the sanitary
engineers all about poetry and philosophy neither of them will be of
any use as planners. Our present way of giving votes to ignorance and
calling it democracy will upset any plan. Wisdom, knowledge, and energy
can save civilisation; electioneering can only wreck it.</p>
