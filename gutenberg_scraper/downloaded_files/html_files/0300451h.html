<h3>THE TEMPEST</h3>

<p class="cp"><b>I</b>
</p>

<p>Early in the year 1918 two great storms visited the coast of
North Queensland. One centred off the port of Mackay, four hundred
miles to the south of Dunk Island, on 21st January, and the other
about twenty-five miles to the north, on 10th March.</p>

<p>Forty-eight hours prior to the Mackay storm premonitory effects
were observed here, succeeding a memorable tidal jumble. During a
breathless calm a mysterious northerly swell set in. To ears
accustomed to the silence and the musical whisperings of a
sheltered bay, the roar and burst of the breakers of a
wind-forgotten sea suggested a confused mental picture&mdash;a
blending of black and grey without form.</p>

<p>Heaving, as with deep-drawn breaths, out from the beach the sea
seemed to be both restless and angry, as glistening rollers heaved
themselves on to the strand, to be shattered into spray. They
rifled the Barrier Reef, threw on the sand lumps of coral to which
brown seaweed hung, like the scalps of mermaids, and swept them to
and fro with savage persistency. They brought driftwood from afar,
and claimed all sorts of sun-dried relics from previous depositary
moods.</p>

<p>After a time the sea became silent again, with a sparkling,
wavering ripple, while the noise of its assault on the mainland
beach had the tone of distant, unceasing thunder.</p>

<p>Ten days before the second storm, while the sky was cloudless
and the air serene, a change in the quality of the heat was felt.
During the first three months of the year&mdash;the period of heavy
rainfall&mdash;the temperature is generally humid., Suddenly it
became dry and burning, with a tingling intensity, as rare as
uncomfortable. For the time the moist vapours of a mild steam-bath
were dispersed by scorching breath as from a furnace, to the
discomfort of animal life and the injury of vegetation.</p>

<p>Early on the morning of Sunday, 10th March, the sky became
overcast. A fresh southerly breeze had sprung up during the night.
A short, confused sea tumbled in the channel, and the usually
placid bay mimicked its sport. With fearsome steadiness of purpose,
the wind developed as it veered to the east. At 5 p.m. it was
travelling at furious speed, twisting branches from trees and
thickening the now gloomy skies with leaves. Consistently with the
strength of the wind the barometer fell until between 9 and 10
p.m., when, with a conglomeration of terrifying sounds varying from
falsetto shrieks to thunderous roars, the centre of the cyclone
seemed to bore down on the very vitals of the island.</p>

<p>The devastating assault lasted about half an hour; it was
followed by a lull, succeeded by another attack of violence from
the north and north-west; then, as orderly as the storm had
developed so it subsided.</p>

<p>With the barometer at 29.90 at 9 a.m., who would have
prognosticated a dangerous cyclone within twelve hours? Mark the
regularity of the derisive finger that, having failed to herald the
storm, acted as a servile registrar of its various phases at the
moment of occurrence:&mdash;</p>

<pre>
9 a.m. 29.90  5 p.m. 29.50
Noon   29.40  6 p.m. 29.60
3 p.m. 29.70  7 p.m. 29.30
4 p.m. 29.60  8 p.m. 29.18
</pre>

<p>As the 8 p.m. observation was taken, the unassisted finger
dropped 2-100ths with a jerk, and within a few minutes the demons
of the air were crazy with fury. That was the final reading for the
night, for the crisis came with such ferocity that the wreckage of
parts of the house made the site of the instrument inaccessible;
nor was it possible to consult it again until shortly before nine
o'clock the following morning, when it stood exactly at the point
from which it had begun to move twenty-four hours before.</p>

<p>Only while the core of the storm was passing was lightning seen
or thunder heard. Then the whole mass of tumultuously-racing clouds
and vapour was luminous at frequent intervals, and the rumble of
the thunder almost continuous&mdash;but the glow was weak and
tremulous, and the thunder timorous, as if the electricity was a
cowed captive at the chariot-wheels of triumphing Wind.</p>

<p>Throughout the night rain was incessant; but its torrential
tramplings on the resonant, ceilingless roof were not to be
detached from the discordancies of wind and wave, save only while
breath was held in expectation of whatsoever might happen after the
terrifying lull. The gauge overflowed at 10.50 in., so that the
exact quantity for the twenty-four hours during which all ordinary
concerns and interests were wafted aside cannot be stated; but, by
comparison with results of previously recorded deluges, the fall
must have exceeded 14 in., the greater volume of which should be
ascribed to about five hours.</p>

<p>Being in perfect sympathy with each other's fury, wind, rain and
sea, in a common tongue, spoke threats of ruin and devastation, and
fulfilled them all in more or less degree. And it has to be
confessed that the crash and confusion of the awe-inspiring night,
after three years of healing, still ring in the ears.</p>

<p>While the rage lasted, a slight degree of comfort was attained
from considering the suddenness of the storm and its very violence.
At its lowest the barometer indicated nothing out of the normal;
but its marvellous activity as the wind gathered in force, the
sensational drop immediately prior to the crisis, the recovery as
the depression passed over, and the subsequently revealed fact that
the course of the storm was brief&mdash;little over a hundred
miles&mdash;show that it was home-brewed. Subsequent information
proved that the dangerous phase was not experienced for more than
twenty miles to the south and twenty-four miles to the
south-west.</p>

<p class="cp"><b>II</b>
</p>

<p>Having thus disposed of the formalities of a great occasion, the
pages to follow will be devoted to a review of its consequences,
not to human beings&mdash;and they were sad and disastrous
enough&mdash;but to the natural features of the island, as they
came to be revealed.</p>

<p>At sunrise on Sunday a leafy wilderness; at sunrise on Monday a
leafless wilderness, wanting only grey skies, snow on the hills,
and ice on the pools to suggest an English winter scene. Along the
beach, on the flat, on the spurs of the range, astonishing
transfiguration. The shrub-embroidered strand is now forlorn, its
vegetation, uprooted and down-beaten, naked roots exposed to
critical view. Not a shrub has escaped, and broken and shattered
limbs of tough trees appeal for sympathy. The country is foul with
wreckage.</p>

<p>Rain ceased two days after the storm, giving way to dry air
under a cloudless sky, and the effects of the visitation were
revealed in harsh crudeness and nakedness. Not a single tree
escaped more or less serious injury. Those not uprooted or broken
at the trunk, are almost limbless and entirely leafless. Instead of
a compact mantle in various shades of green, hills and
spurs&mdash;and even valleys and the rims of ravines&mdash;have
assumed a tattered and frayed raiment of brown, as if a mighty
flame had singed the verdure.</p>

<p>All the minor secrets of the land are bare; the "verdurous
glooms" of yesterday are open to the inquisitive sun; the streams,
fair-running but foul-tasting now, are blocked with decaying
vegetation, and the flat lands are strewn with fallen timber.</p>

<p>Ravished by the profligate wind, once tender and lovable scenes
flaunt their wretchedness and woe, and seem to appeal for
consolation. The islet in the bay-hitherto a garden to the water's
edge, offering to the admiration of the sun and sea masses of
golden-brown orchids and red clumps of umbrella-trees, of
incomparable luxuriance and beauty&mdash;is but a bare rock with a
forlorn crest of seared shrubs.</p>

<p>Let the dreary picture be blotted for the time by recollection
of the endearing past.</p>

<p>Huge coco-nut palms, that a few hours ago might have vaunted
their stately straightness, lie uprooted or broken at the base, or
lean at pitiable angles. Some lie fifty yards from the spot where
their fronds saluted Sunday morning's sun, yet still carry
fragments of their burden of nuts. What significant illustration of
the demonism of the wind does a fallen palm present! During
ordinary gales the fronds stream before the wind like the loosened
hair of a woman, offering to it coy resistance; but, subject itself
to the tormenting cyclone as the palm-tree may, lean in obedience
to its will, bow before its strength, sway to its caprices, there
comes a time when graceful acts are of no avail. The wind will have
its savage way. The wailing palm is prostrated, torn and
dishevelled, carried along as if it were a straw, and piled with
other trophies of victory and violation in calamitous heaps.</p>

<p>The veering of the wind to the north-west, since it took place
about the hour of high water, occasioned a tidal wave, evidences of
which strew the green places of yesterday a hundred yards beyond
the strand. Shrubs four feet high are buried in white coral sand.
Here, amidst the desolation, an artificial flower-garden, acres in
extent, has been created by the successive action of wave and rain.
Thousands of small shells from the bleached hordes of the reef are
stranded with the concavity uppermost. Then the nor'-wester swept
the surface of the new sand, leaving each shell resting on the
summit of a sturdy little pinnacle. At first glance the scene is
that of a magically-planted field of strange, white flowers, the
single atonement for the ravages of the dark hours. Here, too,
every exposed rootlet, every twig and fragment of drift-wood, is
the crest of a sand-ridge in miniature, telling the direction
whence came the wind's final onrush.</p>

<p>Forlorn birds, made tamer by one irresistible touch of Nature,
flit mournfully among the battered branches. They are silent. None
of the cheerful jeers and chuckles of the scrub-fowl comes from the
trampled jungle; the great flight of terns, which settled on the
sand-spit on Sunday and sat in a dense crowd, head to sea, has been
dispersed. A solitary, wind-wearied gannet sleeps, head under wing,
in the sun.</p>

<p>Thousands of maritime birds were killed, and those of the land
suffered in like degree. Here the only species which seems to be in
pre-storm numbers is the swiftlet, the home of which, in secret
places among huge granite rocks, was safe against the shake of
anything less than an earthquake.</p>

<p>Some shy birds have been made confiding by the stress of hunger.
This is specially noticeable among the fruit-eating pigeons, which
frequent the jungles. For several days these beautiful birds
swarmed about the ruins of the aboriginal settlement on the
mainland opposite, perching in protected spots at dark after a
great deal of preliminary fluttering. This voluntary faith in the
goodwill of man on the part of a timorous bird shows that the storm
had destroyed its supplies and shelter. Although many species have
been seen since the perfidious date, they have not made free with
the dwelling, possibly because a few acres of jungle still stand,
fresh as ever, at the head of a deep ravine.</p>

<p>The roof being off the store at the settlement, bags of sugar
were soon converted into syrup, which soon attracted swarms of bees
of Italian descent, and for days overindulgence in heady nectar
seemed to be borne without disorderly effect. As time passed,
however, many became bloated, and, being tipsy, passed from the
stage of excited good-humour to almost helpless pugnacity. Unable
to fly, they crawled and staggered and rolled on the ground, and
savagely attacked bare-footed trespassers, illustrating the ease
with which industrious and provident bees fall from grace under the
temptation of a superabundance of stimulating sustenance.</p>

<p>Conversely, there is a change of outlook, equally quaint, among
certain birds. Cockatoos had acquired a taste for the seeds of
citrus fruits, to the dismay of owners of groves, but in
consequence of the loss of the entire crop these birds have not
been able to indulge the habit. Moreover, the figs and the
wattle-seeds generously supplied during normal times being
non-existent, the noisy birds have fared ill. For many weeks after
the disturbing event few cockatoos visited the island. In the past
many reared broods in the security of this sanctuary, making
morning trips to the mainland for food and recreation among the
more numerous communities there, and returning shortly before dusk.
Recently fairly large flocks have resumed their accustomed journeys
to and fro, proclaiming the hour of departure and arrival with
discordant cries.</p>

<p>Many scrub-fowls on the Isle were killed by whirling missiles
from the groaning trees. In two or three instances incubating
mounds of renown, in which chicks had been hatched from periods
traditional to the blacks, were destroyed; and at least one of
recent origin, and under frequent observation, was swept away by
the tidal wave. But after an interlude the industrious birds began
to chuckle and crow in the bedraggled jungle, and to rake over the
thick carpet of fallen leaves in the forest. Now attempts are being
made to gather the material, of which there are superabundant
supplies, for new mounds. All through the forest where the soil is
light and friable the indefatigable birds work with energy, and
with much noise during the evening; for the white ants, having come
to their kingdom, must be kept down, and the capacity of the
scrub-fowl for such food represents a prodigious natural check.</p>

<p>It will be seen, then, that what Shakespeare might have termed
"this great perturbation of nature" had its effects on things small
as well as great, some of which operate generally to man's
disadvantage. It destroyed thousands of molluscs, tore up acres of
what we are satisfied to call seaweed, displaced coral by the ton,
and made in the shallow waters a maze of snags. On land, in common
with distressed birds, millions of insects cast themselves on the
hospitality of human brings, to our dismay and discomfort. Among
the many species came thousands of fruit-moths from the desolated
banana-grove, invading the house after dark and settling on
maturing bunches, until each fruit was covered with living mosaic.
Dusky, greedy, gross of habit, they feasted the whole night, and
with quivering wings deposited their ova, retiring to obscure
places for the day. Their enemies&mdash;bats and
nightjars&mdash;having been decimated, their numbers were almost
overpowering, so that for decency's sake the fruit that attracted
them had to be destroyed. And yet the pomelo and the lemon and lime
trees, broken and crippled, are already displaying flower-buds, and
with the tender green of new leafage emblematize the most alluring
of the cardinal virtues&mdash;Hope.</p>

<p class="cp"><b>III</b>
</p>

<p>The loveliness of the Isle is of the past; but do I love it the
less while it bears the stripes of its chastisement? Shall I not
rather attempt to comfort and soothe it and heal its scars? Behold,
how it blossoms in its distress!</p>

<p>Did I not, years ago, banish certain garden creepers to the
jungle, in the hope that sooner or later they might wrestle
successfully with coarser-fibred natives, that seldom displayed
aught but foliage? Have they not now come to their own, taking
advantage of the downfall of the crude and intolerant rioters which
flourished rampantly when all was calm and well? And are they not
offering tribute of blooms in half-forgotten and unexpected places?
Even a great, bullying, maniacal wind has its compensations. Here
they are presented in masses and garlands of pale lavender.</p>

<p>Much is to be learned from such phenomena. Certain features of
the Isle, often conned but never understood, are invested with
fresh interest, and have become amenable to inquiry. For instance,
cannot it now be anticipated that the effects of the storm, instead
of being inimical to plant-life on a large scale, may prove to be
beneficial in the most sumptuous style?</p>

<p>Many forest trees were uprooted, or broken down, or reduced to a
branchless, leafless, almost limbless state&mdash;forlorn relics,
so that in the despondent phase dismal pictures were evolved. Would
it not take a score of consolatory years to restore the beautiful
foliage and hide the disfigured trees? How soon did Nature begin
her soothing duties!</p>

<p>In the shattered forest the sun searched out spots sheltered
from its rays for many a generation, and germinated seeds of jungle
plants which had been dropped by careless birds or carried by idle
winds. A thick undergrowth is springing up, which from present
appearances may permanently transform the country. Instead of
forest, there will be forest in the process of conversion into
jungle, and in years to come there will be specific jungle
vegetation.</p>

<p>Instead of permanently destroying vegetation, the big wind will
have to its credit denser and more beautiful growths; instead of
grassy glades, an almost impenetrable entanglement; palms will
sprawl over lofty trees; huge vines, with stems as thick as a man's
thigh and bearing pods a yard long, will spread a network over all;
and instead of the forest's comparatively dry surface will be
maintained a moist, sweet-smelling soil, and steamy conditions and
half-lights. In time, too, the gradual accumulation of vegetable
mould must tend inevitably to the enrichment of the land. We
mortals are apt to fly in the face of Providence, to rail against
decrees that cannot be resisted, and bemoan their effects; whereas,
if we were able to look a month or two ahead, and were wise enough
to interpret Nature's laws, we might conclude that the results
would be to our ultimate pleasure and profit.</p>

<p>Occasionally, a single victim presents in its fall a more
striking picture of disaster than a number of others piled up in
hopeless confusion. One such&mdash;a soft-wooded tree which some
call the "sunflower," and the natives "gin-gee"&mdash;lies not far
away. It stood in a hollow some yards from a low gully, so
protected that the insurance of holding-roots seemed, perhaps,
superfluous. Taken at a disadvantage, its collapse is pathetically
complete. Trunk, limbs and branches lie smashed and shattered as if
the tree had been broken on the wheel under the rigour of the
Inquisition, its seemly proportions, huge leaves, and crown of
golden flowers utterly and completely desolated. Yet in other
localities other specimens, tried and toughened by the experience
of many a storm, stand but slightly affected, to the wonder of
those who know of the tenderness of the white wood.</p>

<p>Even in so imperfect and slight a reference to the stability or
otherwise of the trees of the afflicted coast we cannot omit the
hibiscus. In the van of beach vegetation on such occasions, it must
bear the brunt of the attack of the surges. In very few instances
was the tough and pliant wood broken, although twisted into strange
shapes; but the shrubs met the fate of the frontal line, being
uprooted and overturned so that hardly a single specimen escaped.
However, the fact that seeds are produced in great quantity gives
hope that the beach may soon be redecorated with the familiar soft
foliage and the great yellow bells.</p>

<p>After such a visitation, probably the most conspicuous trees of
the coast are the tea-trees, for the lustful wind tore off their
weather-stained layers of bark, revealing naked limbs and branches
of a pale-red tint. The tea-tree's bark is composed of an infinite
number of layers, thin as tissue paper; within a few weeks of its
ravishment, the exterior became white, and, contrasted with the
seared and stricken forest, each looked like an emblem of purity
and an example of strength. How few of these magnificent trees were
overthrown whose roots had obtained secure hold! Few were snapped
below the spring of the branches, or otherwise mutilated. Most were
stripped of foliage, but slender branches and twigs stand out as an
elaborate fretwork against the sombre hue of the battered and
slowly recovering background. Over a fair extent of country not a
single instance of an uprooted tea-tree is to be seen, save where
the tidal surges had attacked its base; and hundreds exultingly
display clean trunks and limbs and all the elaborate and beautiful
complexity of branches and twigs, now glistening with silvery
leaf-buds. Wrong as it would be, on such evidence, to ascribe to
this particular species supremacy on the score of durability, yet
as far as visible signs may give assurance, it makes excellent
claim thereto.</p>

<p>Different, but scarcely less sturdy, stand the bloodwoods. Few
are uprooted, fewer broken at the trunk; but how horribly are most
maimed and disfigured! Limbs lopped off, they stand gaunt and
grotesque, with few evidences of life save a profuse crop of
leaf-buds, soon to develop into what at first glance seem
artificial rosettes of leaves along the stumps of branches. But for
these superabundant buds, the woeful and distorted forest through
which Dante passed in the infernal regions could scarce have
provoked more dismal reflections.</p>

<p>Less at ease under extraordinary conditions, the Moreton Bay
ash-trees suffered greatly. In the thick of the sheltered forest
they lie, scores uprooted, scores severed at the trunk, and most of
them more or less seriously mutilated by loss of limb. This tree is
more susceptible to decay than bloodwood, and offers more inviting
food to white ants, though when seasoned it becomes almost
imperishable. In the general disaster huge trees involve the ruin
of lesser trees of other species; but when the cleansing fire
breaks out Moreton Bay ash will burn, root and branch, to a white
ash.</p>

<p>Forest mahogany, or mess-mate, another eucalypt plentifully
represented, shows contemptible subservience to the will of the
wind in all phases of disastrous ruin; and in its perversity it
will not burn unless logged into masses and heaps. Thousands of
prone trunks will litter the forest until the white ants complete
their office.</p>

<p>Of the wattles, that which is known locally as the
black&mdash;the toughest and the densest&mdash;behaved with the
greatest staunchness, though many were destroyed by the uprooting
and severing force of the wind. It would seem that the weak spot of
many a specimen was about ten or twelve feet from the ground; at
least, thereabouts the trunk was often broken. Another species,
lacking a familiar name, but often more conspicuous because of its
size and the richness and fragrance of its bloom, fell like
ninepins, few being broken. The favourite habitat of this species
is sandy flats, where the foothold is insecure. The storm there
cried "Havoc," and let slip all its dogs of war. The scrub wattle
went down placidly, for in its home the soil is soft of
surface.</p>

<p>Figs, soft-wooded, but willing to bend before the wind, do not
show very serious effects, though many in exposed parts were cast
down. Slim shrubs of upright habit and pithy texture escaped almost
scot-free, being pliable and submissive, and pandanus palms stood
the test bravely in comparison with many trees which vaunt a
tougher nature.</p>

<p>Most of the jungle being in sheltered aspects, it is difficult
to apply the gauge which might serve for forest country; but
elsewhere it is said that the tallest and hardiest trees succumbed.
For the most part the fate would be a common one, since few of the
denizens of the jungle are independent. An entanglement of
serpent-like vines of gigantic strength is over all, binding tree
to tree, and when a single giant falls it may bring ruin to an
acre.</p>

<p>The records of experienced and competent observers preserve
proof that birds and other creatures are endowed with sensibilities
so much more acute than those of human beings as to seem by their
actions to forecast changes of the weather. Gilbert White, of
Selborne, mentions that before the end of an exceptionally severe
frost roosters which had been silent "began to sound their
clarions, and the crows to clamour as prognostic of milder
weather." It may, therefore, be reasonable to attribute to snakes,
as well as to birds, the faculty of prevision of so great a storm
before indications of its approach were given by the barometer or
were perceptible to human beings. Such a theory, indeed, has the
support of facts. Lesser frigate-birds rarely visit this part of
the coast save in advance of foul weather. Ten days prior to the
event a large flock appeared, wheeling high up in the sky. These,
or others of the species, were seen each day until the morning of
the outbreak, and reappeared in diminished numbers the day after.
It may be that, as the storm became localized, the birds fled
before it; they came back when the wind changed to the north, so
battered and dishevelled that the fresh breeze thrummed on taut but
ragged wings, and the confident flight of the past was reduced to
evident efforts to keep on the wing. Several worn-out bodies were
found on the beach.</p>

<p>Unaccustomed silence on the part of swamp pheasants for more
than a week following the black-letter day, led to the conclusion
that many representatives had been exterminated; but it was soon
discovered that, although quiet, the birds were with us, having
been, apparently, frightened and saddened by the storm. Even now
(1918) they seldom tell of their presence; but the time will come
when forest and flat will resound again to their mellow voices.</p>

<p>One, at least, of these birds affords proof of the dispersing
effects of the big wind. So far as years of patient observation are
to be trusted, no swamp pheasants existed on any of the isles of
the Family Group other than this, the largest and best watered. A
few weeks ago, when passing the isle of Timana, three miles to the
south, the happy sound of a contented bird came from it, leaving no
doubt that the bird, slow, weak and clumsy of wing, had been driven
from Dunk Island when the change to the north occurred.</p>

<p>Before the event which brought ruin and dismay to many, no bird
was more frequently seen, more admired, and more welcomed than the
frail little thing which takes its familiar name from the sun. For
many weeks afterwards no sign of it had been seen, nor had its
thin, squeaky note been heard; and it had been regretfully included
in the list of permanent and regretted losses. Then, in the quiet
of a lustrous and lazy afternoon, one of the living jewels came to
feast among the red hibiscus blossoms. It received a joyful though
suppressed greeting. Without its sunbirds the Isle would have lost
no little of its glitter.</p>

<p>This imperfect review of the effects of the storm on bird-life
ought to include brief reference to an element which may have good
results indirectly. Immediately after the storm it was evident that
many land snakes had been killed, bodies being seen among the long
ridges of rubbish on the beaches. For two weeks prior to the event
quite a number of reptiles known to the blacks as "Wat-tam"
congregated about the poultry yard, and it is safe to say that few
escaped the alarmed vigilance of a black boy, who believes in the
legend of the extraordinary viciousness and the venomous qualities
of a snake which men of science hesitate to pronounce dangerous.
About a dozen were shot. Subsequently, reflection on the invasion
provoked the theory that possibly the snakes had an instinctive
premonition of the disturbance. Lesser frigate-birds did give
warning. Is the most subtle of the beasts of the field to be denied
so beneficial a faculty? Not a single specimen has been seen since,
and it is likely that snakes of such habit would be serious
sufferers during a whirl of limbs and branches, and that birds
generally would ultimately benefit by the destruction of many
enemies.</p>

<hr>

<h3>SHORE-LINES</h3>

<p>If in these writings the subject of the March cyclone crops up
with irritating persistency; if, indeed, it becomes as intrusive as
King Charles the First did in the memorials of the famous Mr. Dick,
peradventure pardon may be granted; for, after all the event was
real, and has stamped itself so deeply on the face of the land that
no glance is free from impressive reminders of its hasty coming,
brief term, and boisterous disrespect towards the concerns and
sentiments of human beings.</p>

<p>Yet it may be quite possible to say certain pleasant things
about the event, and to speculate whether it may not have
beneficial results as time passes. Indeed, already incontrovertible
evidence exists on the latter point. Within a few weeks after the
storm two strange grasses appeared in three different
localities&mdash;within a few feet of high-water limit in two
places, and about fifty yards therefrom in another area over which
the tidal wave had romped. Soon the cows showed that the grasses
were good, substantiating the welcome of man. It is safe to say
that these grasses had not previously been included in the island
flora, nor had any of those to whom they were pointed out ever seen
them either. One of the visitors who shrewdly examined both is a
man of wide experience as a grazier in North Queensland, a
cattle-owner, and one who takes more than ordinary interest in the
dietary of his herd. He was unable to identify either, and was
astonished when proof of the cows avidity for them was pointed
out.</p>

<p>My well-informed friend is apt in the opinion of abnormal
developments in various directions traceable to that fateful whirl.
Do they crop up not only in connection with plant and bird life,
but also with the actual life of the island itself? Did not the
storm cut deep furrows here, raise ridges there, amend the
shore-line beyond belief, and subject the mental processes of its
inhabitants to a vigorous but not to be despised treatment which
has brought about subtle changes of temperament&mdash;something
beyond "the immediate material compulsion of life?" Can it be other
than a pleasant and proper duty to register from time to time, as
they become obvious, some of the physical changes due to such an
exhibition of magnificent and supreme force?</p>

<p>Much might be written of the more simple problems which affect
the shore-line. Let it be said that the tidal wave swept over an
isolated rock mass known geographically as "the Forty-foot Rock"
and locally by the less significant but better-sounding title of
"Wolngarin," and it will be the more readily understood how the
shore-line in more impressionable material was cut up and
transfigured. The work of repair began almost with the next high
tide, and has been slowly maintained since; but between the
ordinary tidal range and the limit of the advance of the tidal wave
over the flat shore, raw sand still lies, with here and there
shoots of buried shrubs peering through the repugnant covering. In
this inhospitable element, and just beyond high tide, several
species of plants have shown themselves, inclusive of watermelons,
tomatoes, (not of that degenerate variety which sometimes crops up
in unexpected places, but good, rotund, sweet-flavoured sorts), the
beach hibiscus, the native cabbage, that lovely silvery-leafed
shrub known as <i>Sophora tomentosa</i>, the poona oil tree, with
its coppery new foliage, many small and vigorous plants of the
umbrella-tree, and several varieties of grass.</p>

<p>There is, therefore, actual promise, within seven months from
its desolation, of the restoration of the admirable and lovely
features of the strand-line; but on the weather aspect, where for
the greater extent compact vegetation overhung the sea, the band of
bare, hot rock, forty feet wide, will probably remain until many
wet seasons have encouraged the successive encroachment of
adventurous vegetation.</p>

<p>The "vagrant wheat" which came wellnigh to maturity on the
coarse sand of the spit may be satisfactorily accounted for; but
these plants were not the only ones to sprout. Others sprang up in
other situations, mystifying the observer as to the origin of the
seed, and seeming to establish their right to occupy the barren
margin of the Isle, and to proffer, as did Herrick's, twice ten to
one for each bushel sown.</p>

<p>The most prodigious, if not the most remarkable of the vagrant
plants of the beach was a single specimen of the castor-oil plant,
which on being transplanted into garden soil developed hugely.
Whence did the single seed come? True it is that some years ago
seeds were sown half a mile from the spot where the plant
established itself; but since none came to maturity it would be
vain to look for a local origin for the wanderer.</p>

<p>So far only two of the plants that have undertaken the care of
the shore-line are to be credited with special qualities for the
work, one being the more wiry of the running grasses previously
mentioned. This has already highly commendable results to its
credit; and it is to be noted that, though the seeds must have been
wave-borne, and that all the plants are growing in sand, those
which lie close to high-tide mark show indifferent resistance to
the scalding of sun and sea. What a recent writer on the
entertaining subject of tidal lands terms "vegetable groynes" are
necessary influences in the restoration and maintenance of shore
frontages. It will be interesting to note the part taken by the
self-sown plants in a great natural process, the beginning of which
occurred, as has been said, within a few days after the destruction
of the first and second lines of defence against such assaults of
the sea.</p>

<p>Readers of Rudyard Kipling's <i>Second Jungle Book</i> will
remember with joy and thankfulness how with elephantine vigour the
jungle was let in upon a village, the inhabitants of which had
earned the displeasure of the "man cub." Let the great wind of half
a year ago represent the wild creatures that acted on the
suggestion of Mowgli, and see how true to nature are the writings
of men of genius. Over a considerable extent of this Isle the wind
did uproot and trample down the great crop of trees, so that the
scene was distorted and rumpled; but what is the result? Vitalizing
sunlight was let into many a shadowy spot; seeds from the jungle
which had lain dormant for many a year germinated under its
influence and that of warm rain; and now, instead of a shady
forest, there stands a mutilated one, with an undergrowth of jungle
vegetation which promises to become dominant in the fight for
supremacy. This thick undergrowth excludes grasses and low shrubs,
and is too succulent to burn, so that the promise of the immediate
future is a change from forest to damp jungle with its cooling airs
and earthy scents.</p>

<p>Truly, there are infinite problems to be watched and waited
for.</p>

<hr>

<h3>SOUNDS AND SWEET AIRS</h3>

<p class="cp"><b>I</b>
</p>

<p>During the first month of the present year of grace (1922) rain
occurred on this Isle on seventeen days, mostly between sunset and
sunrise, the heaviest for twenty-four hours being 3.48 in., and the
total 19 inches. Compared with January last year there is an excess
of 7.79 in.; and, since the opening of the wet season, according to
local records, is significant of its character, it may be judicious
to anticipate an average amount of rain during the next three
months.</p>

<p>A friend, whose observations of the weather of the coastal strip
between Hinchinbrook Island and the Johnstone River extend over the
third of a century, asserts that the rains have been unusually
late. With a trifle of mental exertion, a December that gave over
27 in. is recalled. In the succeeding year (1907) the wet season
lasted until the end of May, over 63 in. having been registered by
that date.</p>

<p>My neighbour is of opinion that Providence is too profuse of
watery blessings during the cool season, such as has been our lot
for a season or two, and regards as ideal the good old thumping
downpour, beginning about seven in the evening and ending with a
jerk about eight the next morning, from December to April, and just
occasional and genial showers for the rest of the year. Yes; there
is something to be said in favour of such a season. With a sound
roof over one's head, all neat and secure outside., the boats
housed, the lamp alight, an absorbing book, and what matters the
sound of the rain?</p>

<p>An inch of rain per hour for the best part of the night
contrives changes of the daylight scheme, and sets the miniature
fall half a mile up the ravine, among the palms and tree-ferns,
roaring more truculently than thousands of sucking doves. Having
found its melodious voice, it will continue its refrain for
weeks&mdash;a musical competition with the fluent tones of the sea.
Then there will be shallow swamps on the flat, alive and musical
with frogs&mdash;gruff bass and shrieking treble, and all tones
between, and every frog panting to be heard. All the lagoons will
be full to the brim, and the brown crayfish, with dandy claws of
blue tipped with red, will become busy in a gliding, stealthy way
among the submerged logs where the eels grow fat.</p>

<p>During such a season, too, the rivers of the mainland send out
to sea the makings of many rafts. Unattached, independent, aloof,
the logs lurch and roll in the swell as the current takes them
always, with rare exception, north, and on them journey white,
full-breasted terns, to which one is inclined to say, "Whither
goest? Your home is here."</p>

<p>Every beach of the Isle is transformed. The big rain makes short
cuts to the great sea, and the sea chokes the sluices with weeds
and spoil, from which the sun distils a scent compounded of flotsam
and drift that seems invigorating. At any rate, it may be enjoyed
unrestrictedly, and, with a trifle added by imagination, may
inspire many a romantic theme. As a tickler of the more subtle
qualities of the mind, what is more effective than a
pungency&mdash;agreeable or disagreeable? And can there be anything
to excite unpleasant reminiscences in fresh incense from unpolluted
gatherings of sea and shore? On such grounds is the revel in a
hearty wet season founded.</p>

<p>Sodden to bedrock, the Isle flourishes. Every plant gushes with
excess, and consequently suffers. Long, soft, sapful shoots hang
limp and faint, and seemingly sorrowful, as tipplers from
over-indulgence, when the sun disperses the low-hanging clouds.
Good to behold is the magic of growth. It tells a heartening story.
Untamed, unrestrained, untended&mdash;see what a crop of crudeness
and waste!</p>

<p>The cool breeze blows in through the window. Likely it will be a
night of reading to thunderous rhythm.</p>

<p class="cp"><b>II</b>
</p>

<p>It came after unexampled drought. Far-off thunder had heralded
it the day before; but heavy clouds had so often gathered and had
dispersed without affording the parched soil any refreshment, that
signs which under ordinary conditions would have betokened the
break of the season were frankly discredited.</p>

<p>Filmy, heated vapour tinged the hills. The still, hot air,
saturated with the essence of smoke from many "burnings off" on the
mainland, quivered in response to the swiftly approaching
disturbance. Clouds gathered suddenly. A startling clap of thunder
sounded near by, and big, widely-dispersed drops began to splutter
on the dust and to stutter on the roof. Other sounds were
deadened.</p>

<p>Rain was so eagerly desired that, merely to enhance the pleasure
of anticipation, we preferred to assert that it would not come.
Most of the tall, blady grass had become as yellow as hay, and
there were actually bare patches, revealing bluish-grey soil
whereon the little blue doves squatted and pecked, almost invisible
until sheer nervousness made them rise. Of other grasses and of
herbs many had become crisp underfoot, and brown; but with the
first gentle sprinkling dry soil and faded leafage sent up an
incense as from flowers blossoming in the dust.</p>

<p>Another loud peal from a fast-gathering, ominous cloud&mdash;the
base of which rested on the nearest hill, and began to descend,
fixed and determined of purpose&mdash;and the welcome din began.
All surroundings were blotted out by a grey mantle of warm but
invigorating rain, while lightning played and thunder rattled and
our spirits began to jubilate. The time of doubt was over.</p>

<p>In half an hour the smaller watercourses, where they were not
banked up with leaves, ran headlong races to the flat, spread out
into pools, and gave the soil more than it could gulp. Like a man
rescued at the last moment in a dry and thirsty land, it could not
absorb liberal helpings, but had to be content with trivial doles
until it became accustomed to the effects of long-denied moisture.
Soon the storm travelled across the sea, vapour gathered on the
hills against an inky background, and all the birds began to
call&mdash;the swamp pheasant the loudest and most mellow, the
scrub-fowl the merriest, with its coarse hilarity and contented
chuckles.</p>

<p>To the south the blue-black bank of thunderous cloud rested on
the sea, with never so slight a blur where rain beat on the
lustreless surface. Most of the Isles were hidden; some were mere
misty blots, while those near at hand stood out preternaturally
green and bold, with the slaty sea enveloping their fringe of
mangroves. All this dull shade and breathless calm seemed to exist
for a single purpose&mdash;to intensify the vividness of the nutmeg
pigeons, that trailed in irregular procession from the mainland to
the restful Isles. Snow-white and swift, they flew low over the sea
in companies of ever-changing formation, and the islet near at hand
suddenly seemed transformed&mdash;its almost leafless trees and
shrubs burst in white bloom, and the blending of wing-beats and
coos came as one of the pleasant sounds of early evening.</p>

<p>But sights and sounds do not sum up all the refreshing and
invigorating elements which visit a scene blessed with a soaking
and noisy shower after a period of silent, nerve-agitating drought.
Walk along one of the many cattle-tracks through the forest, where
all the trees are respiring.</p>

<p>Flowers are few, but the freshly-fallen and decaying leaves
underfoot give forth an odour rich and varied; one must stop
occasionally to fill the lungs with so potent and pleasant a
balsam, and to give thanks for enjoying it on such a generous
scale. All the air is saturated with its invigorating principles.
Gums and wattles, the huge-leaved "gin-gee," tea-trees, the ripe,
orange-tinted fruit of the pandanus along the gullies, the big
spreading figs on the edge of the jungle, the pungent native
ginger, the full-fruited nutmeg, the few last flowers of the
milkwood, the resiniferous gum of the "tangebah," the
patchouli-like ixora, and the sodden grass&mdash;all contribute to
the medley of perfumes, and create a longing for some magic art by
which the combination could be fixed, materialized, and sent to
those who may still believe that Australia is a scentless land.</p>

<p>A mile away, the little pool of the jungle-entangled creek,
which was opened up for the sake of our dainty jerseys, is all
thick and brown with the scouring of many a loop and bend, and
gives out a virile smell as of brewery waste; for is it not a
solution of fermenting leaves of scores of different species of
plants? Better so than to be tainted, as it was, with the remains
of an inconsiderate eel, which died therein just when pure water
was greatly to be desired.</p>

<p>But why think of the immediate past and its trivial anxieties
and discomforts and apprehensions? Are not the little creeks
flushed by over two inches of rain descending wilfully in one
riotous half-hour? Is not fresh and juicy herbage springing from
the warm, moist soil? Are not aged and sedate cows behaving like
frisky calves, and calves, full to the lips with mother's milk,
gallivanting with that giddy irresponsibility which nothing but a
calf may assume, and maintain the least pretensions to sanity? The
air is cool and balmy; smoke-stains have been washed out of it, and
the yellow beaches of the mainland and distant hills are as a new
and glistening painting, with slaty clouds as a background.</p>

<p>Compare this mild evening, and all its pleasant pungencies and
its vivid revelations of scenes that were blurred for weeks with
haziness and smoke, with the past drought that is already almost
incredible; and, if you are not harmonic and cannot sing a gladsome
note, leave such gloating to the shrike-thrush, as he makes the
gloomy dome of the mango resound with fluty whistling.</p>

<hr>

<h3>THE WONDERFUL SEASON</h3>

<p>If Gilbert White of Selborne were living to-day, and among us,
he would deem it a duty to record every characteristic and incident
of this wonderful season&mdash;its winds and calms, its rains and
mists and drizzles, its temperatures; the growth of its vegetation;
the condition and conduct of domestic animals; the moods of its
birds, the activities of its insects, baleful as well as
beautiful&mdash;and draw just conclusions therefrom for the
edification of his day and for generations to come. Possibly he
would have referred to it as <i>Annus Mirabilis</i>, not because of
bewildering disasters, such as plagues and fires and floods, and
falling stars, but because of its genialities, its uniform and, so
far, persistent beneficences, and its charms.</p>

<p>Bold in the assurance that no cruel comparisons can be made
between the records of a man of genius who delights hosts of
readers all over the world and the crude, thin observations of a
loving disciple, an attempt herein is made to register, as Gilbert
White would have wished, some of the everyday facts which have been
noted since the beginning of the year. It is understood, of course,
that merely local conditions are to be mentioned, though it is
apparent that similar experiences have been the fortunate lot of
the North, whether along the coastal strip or in the big, open
spaces where conditions are generally quite dissimilar.</p>

<p>What could be more agreeable to the needs, or more in consonance
with the hopes, of those of us who live in direct touch with the
goodwill of Mother Earth than the lasting, artistically modulated
wet season, with naught of excess and but one attempt on the part
of unruly winds to fly in the face of a serene barometer? The sum
of the first three months being much below the average did, it has
to be confessed, seem to signify a shortage of rain throughout the
year; but, just when one was inclined to give way to doubt, came a
series of genial showers, followed by nearly two months of mist and
drizzle, with warm, clear, radiantly blue days. These restored
confidence and that good-humour which is never far below the
surface in the mind of a man who loves land and expects it to
respond to his trivial ticklings. And so the season progresses,
without a single note of disapprobation, save on the part of the
confirmed pessimist who declares it to be too good to last, while
the little creeks babble with assurance, and most of the trees and
plants revel and indicate well-being by the exhibition of glossy
leafage and abundant flower.</p>

<p>There are singular exceptions, however, to the general
appearance of vegetation impudent with fat living, and certain
birds have been wholly misled. The umbrella-trees quite forgot to
flower, and the big tea-trees made but a poor attempt. Both produce
nectar in excess, and expectant birds must have been driven to less
prolific and less tasteful fountains. Two species of birds seem to
regulate their migratory flights in accordance with
food-supplies&mdash;nutmeg pigeons and metallic starlings, and, as
has been recorded, (<i>Confessions of a Beachcomber</i>) the blacks
were wont to foretell their coming by three trees in particular,
one of the palms, the coral-tree, and the nutmeg. The latter was
always specially associated with the pigeons, but since it and the
coral-tree manifest (the one with fruit, the other with flowers)
the advance of the season, the blacks accepted them as calendars.
When the leaves fell, and red flowers began to decorate the
leafless branches of the coral-tree, the blacks knew of the coming
of the pigeons.</p>

<p>This year (1920) the coral-tree has been unusually dilatory, and
it would seem that the theory of the blacks in respect of its
association with the pigeons is established. Records of nigh upon a
quarter of a century show that the pigeons arrive about the 7th of
August, the starlings having preceded them by two or three days.
This season the starlings arrived on the 10th, announcing
themselves, as they invariably do, with the whir of rapid wings,
and acidulous exclamations. Not until the 20th were the first
pigeons seen&mdash;a small flock that seemed to be weary and spent
with travel. When it is said that the local coral-trees have still
to bloom, and that the nutmegs are scarcely edible, from the
pigeons point of appreciation, it will be admitted that the season
has its contradictions, and the birds were in the right in delaying
their arrival.</p>

<p>It has been noted, too, that some of the orchids are later than
usual, and that certain culinary vegetables have been
exasperatingly slow in development. Reports from the immediate
neighbourhood tell of the tardiness of the orange bloom, while the
mango-trees have flowered off and on during the last three months
without establishing hope of fruit, and without that excess of
foliage which often registers a mild and encouraging season. It is
said that sugar-cane is making the heart of the farmer rejoice over
the next year's prospects, that new lands are being cleared and
planted, and that the cultivation of the banana in the North is
about to be revived on a scale worthy of the fruit and the
clime.</p>

<p>See, therefore, the elasticity of the mind of man under the pull
of the weather. Not that in ordinary seasons there is much to
complain about as far as the coastal tract is concerned; but when
all conditions are favourable the stimulus becomes irresistible.
Timely rains, naught of excess in temperature, bright and cloudy
days ideally alternated, wholesome mists which have swathed
mountains and hills in a dripping blanket of grey&mdash;under such
influences hope springs eternal in the breast of that portion of
humanity which gaily gambles with the weather for livelihood.</p>

<p>And that brawny breast, does it not expand with this vitalizing,
tepid air that folk from the chill South hasten to share with the
fortunate North Queenslander? And is he not proud of his country?
And does he not chuckle over the juvenile inconsistencies of those
who cry, tremulously, for a White Australia, while declaring out of
their ignorance or prejudice that the most richly endowed part of
it is fit only for blacks?</p>

<p>Ah! we know-do we not?&mdash;the riddling and the quibbling of
theorists on what they term "climatology," and how they apply their
theories. We know. too, that we have the only part of Australia in
which certain articles of food can be produced to the best
advantage in quality, quantity, and in the shortest space of time,
and that we enjoy a monopoly&mdash;bestowed by climate, and
therefore permanent and superior to the manipulations of the
envious&mdash;over other products essential to the well-being of
the Commonwealth. When we do trouble ourselves to ponder
affectionately over the catalogue of our industries, present,
prospective and possible, we ought to be the most contented of
Australians.</p>

<hr>

<h3>THUNDER SEASON</h3>

<p>Thunder every other day and revivifying showers have
characterized November (1917). Plant-life becomes almost obnoxious
under the stimulus of the heat which precedes the thunder and the
rains which maintain in the soil the dampness of a forcing-house.
Between successive flashes of heat cool and calm days intervene,
deluding the exasperated tiller of the soil with promise of easier
times&mdash;less rain, less heat, and, consequently, less
impertinence on the part of the vegetation he finds it necessary to
repress. When the cycle of change is completed in a single day the
changes are, of course, sudden, and mayhap sensational under given
circumstances.</p>

<p>If the morning promised fair&mdash;agreeable temperature,
cloudless sky, gentle easterly breeze and swell-less sea&mdash;was
it not an invitation to abandon ordinary occupations and start off
to the mainland, with, primarily, the benevolent purpose of
visiting a neighbour six miles away, in a remote nook on the slope
of the blue range across the blue water, and incidentally of
absorbing some of the delicate sensations derivable from perfect
weather and changeful scenes?</p>

<p>Almost insensibly the breeze veered to the north, creating that
gently frolicsome sea in which a little boat seems to be sprightly
with eagerness and vanity and endearing swan-like buoyancy. With
the wind from that quarter there is a cosy cove for her, into which
her betters in size must not intrude; and there was she left,
bowing to each admiring swell that peered over the basaltic
boulders, which form a rude sort of protection even when the
weather comes from open sea.</p>

<p>From the landing a track through jungle leads to a lonesome hut.
No gleam of sunshine penetrates to the red soil; the lofty,
thickly-leaved trees are for the most part the hosts of creepers,
some parasitic, some with huge, independent stems, strangely
twisted and festooned, springing from the ever-damp earth. Their
own leaves, and those of the great burdens imposed on the trees,
create an agreeable shade; but to-day the soft light has a singular
quality, not worth emphasizing but yet perceptible, and the
cassowary after which the dog raced seems to be grumbling and
mumbling in the distance at strangely regular intervals, as if its
hasty flight had carried it a mile ahead.</p>

<p>Emerging from the jungle into the forest, we felt that the wind
had ceased. Few, indeed, of the everyday sort of breezes visit this
sheltered nook; the stillness, therefore, was more of a mental than
a physical sensation, and the mutterings of the nervous,
long-winded cassowary suddenly became transformed to distant
thunder, grumbling behind intervening hills.</p>

<p>Having chatted with the lonesome man, and having eaten
abundantly of the varied and kindly fruits of his well-kept
clearings, it was time to return to the beach through the leafy
tunnel, now gloomy, but richer than before with the scents of
flowers and profuse leaves and wholesome earth. Certain
effects&mdash;an agreeable warmth, a delicate stillness, an
echoless silence&mdash;gave our voices unaccustomed tone; at least,
the listener fancied so. Perhaps the atmosphere was denser than
during the morning, and voices did not carry so far, and appeared
to be abrupt, yet clear. Though scores of nutmeg pigeons were
feeding among the tree-tops, and an occasional displaced fruit fell
with a thud or pattered through the foliage to the ground, no voice
of bird sweetened the air. Nature seemed to be holding herself in
check for some authoritative effect in the way of sound.</p>

<p>From the beach how changed the aspect! Blue-black clouds
overhung distant islands, and draped mainland hills in unbecoming
sombreness. The storm which the morning had heralded with
cassowary-like plaints was gathering fast. Its centre seemed to
rest on the customary pivot&mdash;the always-dark mountain
north-westwards&mdash;and it was wheeling to impose itself between
the anchorage and home. The question of the moment was, Is it
possible to cross the leaden-hued water before thunder-charged
clouds make mischief? Let the risk be taken; at least we shall feel
in half an hour the influence of the Isles, breaking down the angry
seas if the wind veers to that quarter from which it makes the
present spot uncomfortable if not dangerous. So, up and away with
all possible speed!</p>

<p>No sooner was the hurrying boat so far on the way that she would
have been caught as surely in retreat as in advance, than the
thunder spoke in menacing tones; skirmishing drifts flew down the
ridges to the west, and an enveloping movement on a grand scale
began to operate with irresistible vigour and haste. The glassy sea
was ruffled here and there with spear-heads of wind, which subsided
almost as suddenly as they appeared, but became broader every
second; and the sounds of the eager engine, coaxed to emit every
atom of power, were heightened by the quietude. With dramatic
rapidity the black wall to the south changed to grey, the mainland
was smeared out with a similar hue; a vertical flash of lightning
descended, or seemed so to do, on the highest peak of our homeland;
a deafening roar shook the boat, and the wind and rain raced
towards her with a line of foam in straight and unbroken array, as
if both wind and rain stamped to the music of the thunder. In a few
seconds the boat was the centre of a grey blotch a few yards in
diameter., in which furious though not great seas seemed intent
upon tearing her to pieces, while the wind rushed past like a
fiend, angry and searching.</p>

<p>In the brief opening phase of the fight both steersman and
engineer were soaked to the skin. As in a cyclone, the wind brushed
off the crests of the waves, so that the circle in which the boat
was central was a blur of most indefinite outline. For a time the
steersman felt the way by the sting of the mixture of rain and
spray on his right cheek, but presently these uncertain aids to
direction became confusing; however he turned his face, they smote
him on both cheeks at once, and, though it might be safe to assert
from the location of the lightning and thunder-peals that for a
time at least the boat headed across the track of the storm, a very
few minutes elapsed before sense of the course was lost, and all
that could be done was to attempt to dodge the seas that flew at
the bows, three at a time, and sent jagged pieces from stem to
stern, sharp as teeth and cold yet savage.</p>

<p>Faced with an exciting problem which exacted immediate solution,
we drew the waterproof cover over the boat and up to the knees of
the steersman, who had to handle the tiller and keep the pump
going. At all hazards the engine must be kept dry, for who could
guess at the duration of the storm, and how far the boat might be
carried out of her course before a sight of land verified her
whereabouts?</p>

<p>Now the tumult increased, after never so slight a rift directly
overhead. A flash of lightning seemed to hit the sea just ahead;
with but the briefest interval, the thunder crashed and the rain
fell in torrents, so benumbing the anxious crew that it was barely
possible to attend to urgent and essential duties.</p>

<p>An hour earlier the sultry jungle had teemed with pleasantness,
and was pervaded with silence!</p>

<p>In the midst of universal greyness, 'mid lightning and thunder,
the rush of rain and the snap of fierce little seas on bows that
always mounted them, the chill which made teeth chatter and
benumbered fingers, there was time to recollect the calmness, the
stillness, and the warmth of the leafy tunnel through which we had
wandered with light-hearted, time-ignoring carelessness. Not that
the present moments were entirely destitute of pleasure&mdash;for
does it not brace the nerves to be in a sound and worthy boat when
she battles with forces that you are convinced she may overcome,
given some sort of co-operation and guidance? You have seen her
behaviour in all sorts of weathers, and have never known her cause
the slightest apprehension. She accepts the seas, and is still
mistress of her fate; but at the moment there are other
circumstances to be considered. Will the supply of petrol hold out?
What freakish spirit in the engine makes the mixture of petrol and
kerosene, which usually gives pure satisfaction, distasteful?
Charge the repugnance to the thunder-impregnated air, and yet no
practical solution to the doubts of the moment is forthcoming.</p>

<p>Is it not best to conserve the pure spirit and let the boat
drift before the storm? She will do so in safety, but when the
storm ceases where shall we be? Where is the despised compass now?
With the stopping of the engine, strife with the encircling waves
ceases. The boat, an irresponsible chip centralizing the blur,
drives easily, with lightning and thunder and torrents of rain as
startling, loud, uncomfortable, but harmless attendants. Vain are
speculations as to the direction of the drift and its speed. Will
it take the boat on to the rocky point&mdash;or past it&mdash;or to
the neighbourhood of the anchorage left ever so long ago? There is
nothing to be done save to shiver with cold, find comfort in the
heat of the silencer, and watch the edges of the blur for
hope-giving light. The rift overhead was but momentary; but now
along one edge appears a straightened halo, dim at first but
rapidly gleaming through the crest-broken waves and the rain. In
five minutes the sky is clear, with the thunder retiring to the
mountain, which seems its lair, the seas just lively, and the deck
already drying. The boat has drifted in the direction of the cosy
corner wherein she spent the day; but the engine responds to the
first impulse, and she runs home with, as the crew is happy to
reflect, a certain saucy jauntiness, a conscious exultation of
having fought a good fight without the least show of submission,
and now with real joy in the victory.</p>

<p>The sun shines brightly, the air is sprightly, the distances
radiant. The cycle from freshness to sultriness, storm, and
obscurity, and again to freshness and clear sky has been completed
for the edification of two holiday-makers in a single wayward
day.</p>

<h3>A HOMELY GARDEN</h3>

<p>If one wanted proof of the significance of Kipling's saying that
last year's nuts are this year's black earth, it lies at hand. just
before the cyclone a diminutive garden, solely for utilitarian
purposes, was made in sand fronting the beach, and with a short,
narrow, spongy depression, tributary to a little creek, as a
background. Tall tea-trees and many pandanus palms flourished there
in the peaty soil which was never dry, and where the frontal ridge
rose from swampy levels the sand was black with the mouldering
vegetation of centuries.</p>

<p>Adjacent to the crude fence once stood a huge coral-tree which
had had its day and ceased to be, and the soft wood as it decayed
formed heaps of tindery stuff that mingled with the sand, helped to
this end by the industry of scrub-fowls.</p>

<p>For generations before the coming of white men the great
coral-tree, as has been told elsewhere (<i>Confessions of a
Beachcomber</i>) was the centre of activities of the aboriginal
proprietors of the Isle. Some of their dead were buried beneath its
shade. The living feasted there, for have not their stone ovens
been unearthed? Birds lodged in the big tree. Being deciduous and
of succulent foliage, it contributed largely to the enrichment of
the absorbent sand which its roots explored far and near.</p>

<p>When it died it fell silently&mdash;so silently that the few
resident blacks were scared, and began to cast about for some
unlucky chance that ought to follow so unaccountable a fact. Other
forms of vegetation sprang up like magic, to the further sustenance
of the sand, and the spot became a circle of decayed vegetation
with a scrub-fowl's mound about the base of the rotting trunk.</p>

<p>Taking a hint from Nature, it was decided to form a vegetable
garden where water and sandy humus, enriched by the deposition of
the refuse of ages, were available. Tons of vegetable mould were
transferred a few yards; tons of decayed manure from the milking
shed were added as a special stimulant, and to give it body; and
the work was wellnigh completed when the storm and its attendant
tidal wave desolated the scene. The buoyant elements of the soil
were carried off like froth, and deposited in the peaty hollow
where the pandanus palms stood, ever refreshed; little but salt
sand, raw from the beach, remained on the scene which had absorbed
so much enthusiastic labour. The fencing had to be restored, the
beds reformed, and some of the disarray of the spiteful breeze
smoothed with hasty hands, for the season was advancing. The cows
became curious, discovering fencing insecurities, and making havoc
among the irregular plots that were ready for seed.</p>

<p>How speedily, notwithstanding the ruffianly check, did the site
justify itself! It might have been thought that the very heart had
been taken out of the soil, but elements inappreciable to the eye
remained in the seemingly intractable sand, and soon gave positive
evidence of their existence. Seeds germinated with almost magical
spontaneity, and plants of varied character made extraordinary
growth.</p>

<p>In one case another lesson direct from Nature was accepted in
thankful spirit and put into practice. It was seen that vagrant
tomato plants grew among the beach rubbish, until the cows
developed a taste for foliage and fruit alike. Several bags of
decaying leaves, seaweed, sponges, the cases of dead crustaceans
and mummified little fish were dumped beside a huge log, and in
this light stuff young tomato plants were set. The results have
been excellent as to quantity and flavour, though in size the fruit
has much to its discredit. Cabbages, beans, green peas, carrots,
parsnips and radishes, with neglected sunflowers, are giving good
returns, though for several weeks the weather has been by no means
propitious for succulent greens, and oft-times serious affairs have
interfered with regularity in watering the beds.</p>

<p>Let it be remembered that most of the crops in the primitive
garden belong to cool, if not cold, climates, and that
here&mdash;well within the tropics&mdash;in almost pure sand, in
some spots hot enough at noon to blister the feet, no check has
been sustained by plants usually associated with cloudy skies and
dripping mists. On the untended sand-ridge beyond the highest limit
of the tidal wave pumpkins and vegetable marrows have gone on doing
more than justice to themselves, some plants having lived through
two seasons productively. But the particular area occupied by the
rampageous vines was previously covered with wattles and a great
variety of more or less densely-foliaged shrubs, each of which
would add its quota to the accumulation of fallen leaves and
discarded fruit or shelly seed-husks, slow but certain of
decay.</p>

<p>"Alas for human culture!" exclaims Thoreau. "Little is to be
expected of a nation when the vegetable mould is exhausted and it
is compelled to make manure of the bones of its fathers." Was this
thought in the minds of the authorities when the regulations
against the careless use of fire were issued subsequent to the
cyclone? Was it recognized that in the jungle country fire would
destroy not so much fallen timber as the very life of the soil, the
result of ages of vegetable decay? Here in the North lies the
biggest deposit of "last year's nuts." No other area within our
borders possesses such an accumulation of the spoils of the past;
and it is the duty of the individual, if not of the State, to
safeguard the elements of the soil which are liable to destruction
by fire.</p>

<p>Of course, it is true that all jungle lands prior to cultivation
have to undergo the chastisement of fire; but it would be a
calamity if during the dry season now prevailing fires were started
in jungle country which had been subject to the will of the
cyclone. We do not yet make use of the bones of our own ancestors
to enrich our garden plots, but in the primitive spot referred to
the bones of the forefathers of the vanished blacks may have had
their part in its fertilization.</p>

<p>What must not be permitted is the destruction of the soil;
therein lies life not only for the transient individual. but for
the ever-improving race of mankind. If the labour of trivial hands
may produce results such as this ribbon of sand displays, what
might be the result of proper cultivation of the soil in areas
where Time and Nature have performed their offices, unrestrained,
time out of mind?</p>

<hr>

<h3>IN RESERVE</h3>

<p>Though flocks of light-hearted tourists flee from. the searching
cold of the South to bask for a brief season in the genial warmth
of the North, there are scenes of fascination denied them. They may
wander with unquiet haste far and wide to accredited beauty-spots,
but sequestered ones of infinite charm are in reserve for the
permanent dweller, who abhors the misuse of God's good time, and
disdains unholy zeal for quantity rather than quality in his
scenery.</p>

<p>It may be but a proof of conceited simplicity on the part of an
individual to proclaim such a spot or such another as the most
satisfying, since a bare half-dozen people may be capable of
confirming his opinions or confounding them. Yet, if these
little-known charms were to remain uncommended, mischief might be
wrought. Chivalry, too, should compel the fortunate individual who
may have joy, special and peculiar, in a particular scene to give
others pleasure by telling of the combination of blue sea and green
islets and glowing sky which appeals more strongly than other land
and sea scapes.</p>

<p>Among the islets of the Family group, sprinkled between
Hinchinbrook and Dunk islands, not one is denied distinction. All
are, for the most part, rugged on the Pacific slope, though some
decorate even that exposed aspect with vegetation of a
sumptuousness that conceals the crude, confused masses of granite.
Each has a truncated sand-spit jutting out to the north-west, while
two have masses of snow-white coral spoil, which clinks and chinks
underfoot, and upon which shrill-voiced terns scatter, with
careless profusion, daubed and spotted eggs. The waves that break
on it with measured stride, scarcely whiter than the coral, wallow
among its finger-shaped fragments, combing and rustling them, until
all point obediently to the reef whence old Ocean tore them.</p>

<p>But not always does the sea burst roughly on those banks to
overhaul and re-arrange its treasures in severe lines. More often
it sleeps, and smiles in its sleep; and then the lighter and
unconsidered coinage tinkles as it rolls under the impulse of
playfully indifferent touches. Then, too, the hot rocks glisten
with micaceous spangles, and, where the sand is, our toughened and
unworthy feet are dusted with glittering specks. It is all wealth
of a kind&mdash;not material in the accepted sense, but real enough
if you are in the state of mind which is superior to the "toil of
fools."</p>

<p>When one wanders among such scenes, where there is no sign of
traffic save that of his own footprints, no sound save the
confidential whispering of the sea, the thin screams of terns and
the whimsical cackling of scrub-fowl in the jungle, he becomes a
part of the realm of Nature, a trivial and insignificant item soon
to disappear, but for a brief space supreme&mdash;the only part of
teeming Nature capable of disinterested joy in all the other parts.
The sea will quickly smooth away the last trace of his trespassing
feet, and will moan and gurgle in cool crevices whither
bottle-green crabs scurry when the red-backed sea-eagle soars
vigilantly overhead. Yet for a time he has been absorbed into the
scene. He possesses it and is possessed by it, and will bring away
with him a loving remembrance of it which entices beyond power of
abstinence.</p>

<p>There is, of course, one scene which combines more of
excellences than the others, however admirable individually. A
little bay lies open to the turbulent south-easters, yet lacks not
a sheltering cove wherein a small boat may nestle. The cove is
formed by a bold and rounded mass of granite, on which pandanus
palms and straggling shrubs find foothold. The boat glides round
the sturdy rock, revealing a white beach, the sand of which has
been ground to such singular fineness that it feels as silk
underfoot. Where the anchor rests, it is rippled in correspondence
with the gentle heaving of the sea, while patches of golden-brown
weed sway to the same poetic motion. Coarse grass marks time at
high-water limit.</p>

<p>From a low pinnacle of rock, on which an osprey is fond of
perching, the virtues of the wider scene are best revealed. Five
islets, wildernesses of leafage, trip out to the east. A mass of
fantastic rocks, round which confusing currents swill, intercepts
the fairway, and beyond the islets are the Brooke group, with Goold
Island and Hinchinbrook to the right to complete the picture. The
bay beneath is shallow close inshore, for coral is industriously
building substantial domes and fragile lacework in limestone. The
reef gleams dull-red through the blue water, and white and pale
green patches show where sand has occupation of the unallotted
places.</p>

<p>On a very still and clear day you may see turtles browsing on
the weed below, and at any time they may burst upwards through the
surface with splash and bubble for gulps of scented air.</p>

<p>On the rocks, piled high, is a long pencil-cedar log, weathered
almost to the tone of the granite. It has reposed there, with but
slight changes of position, for fifteen years and more, and the
salt spray and the tepid rains have done it but small harm; but the
rocks have fretted its sides as it has rolled uneasily when the
seas have sought to claim it again. The old log is the one relic of
the coarse effects of the hands of man. Few visit the spot. All its
charms are held in reserve.</p>

<hr>

<h3>THE SERENE SEA</h3>

<p>No sort of tedium dulled the too brief trip over the serene sea.
No device for killing time by eating inordinately, or quarrelling,
or flirting, was needed, though we had one custom in common with
life on an East Indiaman before the age of steam&mdash;ceremony was
banished.</p>

<p>Porpoises, snow-white terns sitting on drifting wood,
sea-eagles, ospreys, sea-snakes, sails, the smudge of steamer-smoke
and its ten-mile plume, sunlit isles and speckless sky, with no
sound save the purring of the engine and the prattle of the water
against the bows&mdash;a catalogue of the commonplace, and yet
stimulative of entertainment and content. Not one of the three
would have exchanged places with far more favoured mortals. Here
was, indeed, the freedom of the sea&mdash;the sea in its happiest
and most alluring and loveliest of moods. No restrictions existed.
The little boat sought out ways of her own, nosing shoal-showing
buoys and beacons, and hugging the land whensoever and wheresoever
she chose.</p>

<p>New aspects of familiar scenes thus become revealed. Seen from
such a low level, the heights of Hinchinbrook and all the shoulders
and spurs and ridges of the mountain demand uninterrupted
attention, for are they not transformed? Bold and clean-cut, the
skyline with its abrupt declivities, its peaks and
contours&mdash;here the profile of a giant with beetling brows,
long, slim nose and babyish lips, there a succession of irregular
notches and knolls&mdash;are projected against a perfectly limpid
atmosphere, while in vale and gorge</p>

<p>Just a faint cloud of rose shall appear,<br>
As if in pure water you dropped and let die<br>
A bruised, black-blooded mulberry.</p>

<p>And this tinted haze seems to magnify trees and obtruding rocks,
revealing hitherto well-guarded secrets. The sources of torrents
which in the wet season seam the brown rocks with silver, now
cushioned with moss and islanded with yellowing sedges, are shown
by an occasional flash and glitter as the sun plays upon them at a
reflective angle.</p>

<p>Each time the channel is explored from the deck of a steamer
some new feature stands to the credit of the gaunt hills, and those
who know them best make free to assert that it is beyond the
capabilities of man to carry in mind all their individualities. A
few miles back Leafe Peak was a perfect cone of delicate blue. More
than once it has seemed to change its position, and now it might
stand for a model of Castle Hill, Townsville, as that was wont to
be ere nakedness shamed its base. There is legend extant that the
name is derived from the ribbon of leaves which almost invariably
stretches from the mangroves and jungle at the foot to the
mangroves of the flats of the mainland; and it is further said that
hereabouts the northern and the southern current meet, creating the
watery ridge defined by leafy flotsam. But there exists a
counter-statement to the effect that the name commemorates that of
one of the surveyors of the channel. It is a good name, whatever
its origin; and perhaps the wavering line of yellow leaves, as
permanent in its perpetual renewal as the impassive rocks, will
retain its hold on the imagination as an emblem of unity between
the mountain and the mangroves, when good folks in holiday humour
have ceased to concern themselves about the name of a mere man.</p>

<p>In days that are gone an adventurous black "boy" told of a short
cut from Ramsay Bay, skirting the mangroves of Missionary Bay, to
the channel. No one credited him, though he gave dramatic evidence
in support of his account, describing the manner in which the spurs
and slopes of certain mountains interlocked. Viewing the landscape
from the deck of the hasty little boat, the route taken by the
"boy" was easily discerned, and since the chart shows that the
distance from the mangroves in Missionary Bay to those of the
channel is not more than four miles, the pass ought to be better
known.</p>

<p>In popular imagination the mountains of Hinchinbrook, however
picturesque and grand, are too severe, rugged and precipitous to
tempt any but the boldest and toughest of athletes; but a resident
of the Herbert district undertook many years ago to demonstrate
that from a mountaineering point of view the difficulties of ascent
were not so great as appearances suggested. For the love of the
thing he rowed across the channel from Lucinda Point, fought his
way through the jungle, scaled the shoulders of Mount Diamantina,
and signalled his presence at the great rock on the summit by smoke
in such a short space of time that the Mount might well have felt
humbled. A singular feature of the boulder surmounting the rugged
height is that it seems to be a pivot round which other elevations
swing&mdash;at least, such is the illusion as the boat runs down
the channel and out to sea to the south-east, and from whatsoever
aspect the stern boulders of the mount are viewed, they seem to
express aloofness and disdain. Not so the nooks and coves in the
sheltered parts of the channel, which coax little boats to spend
quiet hours within rocky arms, and promise gurgling lullabies the
livelong night.</p>

<p>Within such a cove the boat lay in silence and serenity. In the
deep shadow of the morning a fast steamer, blurred with mist, came
rushing down the channel&mdash;a white blotch with a
backward-curling smudge of smoke, calling to mind one of Turner's
masterpieces; but that famous picture lacks the foreground of bold
declivities and the distances of hills aglow with the beams of the
rising sun. Thence the course was to the northern extremity of
Pelorus Island, avoiding the shallow shoals opposite Lucinda, and,
when a clearance was made, direct to Pioneer Bay in Orpheus
Island.</p>

<p>Here is good shelter for small boats in all weathers, save the
uncommon and brief winds from the west which seldom raise a sea.
The entrance needs to be known, for it is interlocked by boulders
and blocks of coral. Thence the course lay almost due south, miles
to the westward of the steamer track, close past Dido Rock, with
its outlying sandbank, snow-white in the distance&mdash;not much
larger than, and somewhat of the shape of, an upturned boat. Most
of these islands, rocks and shoals bear the names of men-of-war,
derived in the first instance from the classics. Is it not
possible, then, that the steep-faced, weather-scored rock which
bears the name of Dido caught the fancy of surveyors who had in
mind the citadel that valiant woman built on the African coast,
when a storm drove her fleet there, and she bought of the
inhabitants as much land as could be encompassed by a bull's hide
cut into thongs?</p>

<p>Swarms of welcome swallows issued from the crevices of the red
rock, circled round the boat, twittering greetings, and flew back
to their nests when their invitations to stay were disregarded. At
Herald Island, where anchor was dropped at 4 o'clock in the
afternoon close inshore, flocks of swallows again paid the boat
respect, perching on the rigging and spars, and making themselves
easy and familiar.</p>

<p>Two or three spent the night on board, and the rest of the
colony seemed to have homes among the low granite boulders and
blocks that fringed the shore just above high-water mark. Here, as
elsewhere, the sea was sparklingly clear, so that isolated rocks
crowned with brown, wavy seaweed, rounded masses of coral and dead
shells, gleaming white, were revealed, and the merging tints,
pale-green to deep-blue as the water deepened off-shore where the
sand was soft and pure white, made the heart glad. It was
invigorating, too, to wallow in such stainless water before
sunrise, the air being crisp and the only sound that of the
cheeping of the welcome swallows.</p>

<p>Suddenly clouds gathered in the south-west, and before a moaning
wind the serenity of the sea fled, chased by white horses. The boat
lay snug under the spit until the early snack of coffee and biscuit
was disposed of&mdash;then, rejoicing as a strong man to run a
race, she swept disdainfully round its apex and with frolic and
saucy capers flew homewards.</p>

<hr>

<h3>TROPIC GLORY</h3>

<p>Last evening (March 6, 1921) we saw the very gates of heaven.
Those who live under sullen skies seldom have a chance of seeing
the majestic paintings of the sun; but here, where hills and sea
and sky are the mediums in which a tropical sun plays fantastic
tricks of bewildering variety, you become accustomed to, though
never satiated by, the glories of The Beyond.</p>

<p>All day it had been scorching hot&mdash;that kind of hotness
that tingles the small of the back and adds two shades of brown to
the shoulders during the sun-bath following the noontide wallow in
the sea. I had spent an unclad hour clearing away loose coral from
one of the favourite runs of the little fishing-net, and had cooled
down in the sparkling, noisy streamlet that the wet season
stimulates and freshens. That loll in the fragrant water&mdash;it
comes down the palm- and fern-tree-embowered ravine&mdash;created
an appetite for lunch, and afterwards influenced a dreamy while of
reading.</p>

<p>When I really woke and began to stroll among the mango-trees,
the western half of the sky, or rather a big area of it, was
sullen&mdash;thickly, diabolically blue, as if reeking with fumes
from hell. Beneath was a zone of curry-coloured sky, outlining
ranges almost black in the intensity of blue.</p>

<p>Away aloft, so high that a backward tilt of the head was
necessary, the cloud-bank was edged with light as ineffably
variable as the shadows over a wheat-field on a breezy day. Soon
rainbow tints, appearing, disappearing and reappearing magically in
detached flakes and patches, and severed by purple rays, hovered
and flitted over and along the cloud. Occasionally lightning
zig-zagged horizontally across the densest part, and you could just
catch the mutterings of thunder.</p>

<p>A great patch of yellow light sprang from the middle of the
upper edge of the dusky cloud, like the half of an enormous nimbus,
glowing and glittering. Then, with the gentlest of gradations, its
yellow gave way to other primary colours, delicately displayed and
quivering with fairy-like agitations. A huge ravine opened up, a
valley through rainbow-land, leading to a wall as ruddy as
imagination may paint, and embossed with a pearl as great as a
house.</p>

<p>Twice appeared a strange shape. Picture a bird soaring in a
huge, circling flight from north to south, hidden by the
cloud-screen save for one fully-extended wing, and that wing
displaying bands of blending tints of gold and green and silvery
rose, with feather-tips of sepia, fluffy and breathlessly soft.
Picture the wing wavering and slowly vanishing, until the final
feather seemed the shadow of a golden plume and as slowly
reappearing in all its magnificence&mdash;inspiring the hope that
the glorious bird of Paradise would emerge and be seen soaring in
its proper sphere at the gate of heaven.</p>

<p>All the ships, the ragged remnants, the fragments and frayings
of all the rainbows of the most decorative of wet seasons, skirted
the cloud or were tossed about in luminous heaps; and then the
scene burnt itself out in extravagant redness, leaving the Isle in
a lurid gloom, and its inhabitants stiff-necked, but with a rare
joy at heart.</p>

<hr>

<h2>PART II</h2>

<hr>

<h3>THE PIGLING AND THE PICCANINNY</h3>

<p>Though the piccaninny's arrival had preceded it, the pigling
vanished first, and since this is a record of departures it
deserves prominence in the title.</p>

<p>Both were island bred.</p>

<p>George the Greek, who seldom leaves the vicinity nowadays,
brought the pigling from Goold Island, where there was wont to be
such a superfluity that parents abandoned them on the merest sniff
of danger. Possibly George had murdered one of its able-bodied
relatives, for he had with him a joint of something that bore a
distant resemblance to pork and was so tough and tasteless that
Debil-debil (the authoritative dog now of "that equal sky") and his
consort got it, after apologies to George. Impossible pork, it
looked like a junk out of a newly-felled bloodwood log, but had
naught of the wholesome odour of the fresh red wood.</p>

<p>So much for the pigling's uncle.</p>

<p>George was upbraided because he had inflicted the Isle with a
rest-disturbing orphan, helpless and squeakful. Inspired by hope,
and permitting his imagination to dwell on the attractiveness of a
six weeks' suckling, fat and tender, with a crisp exterior, browned
and glistening, and an interior gushing with gravy and fragrant
with herbs, he proceeded to pet the helpless, lean little creature.
Imprisoned in an improvised hutch, well padded and bedded with
blady grass, the pigling forgot its brief experience of freedom,
finding consolation in a diet of coco-nut milk.</p>

<p>Intent upon giving its flesh a nutty flavour, over which his
eyes twinkled, George, after three or four unsuccessful attempts,
made a huge grater out of a foot square of galvanized iron, and
spent an hour or so every day stuffing his pet with porridge of
shredded coco-nut and milk. As its fat increased the squeaks of the
pigling mellowed into throaty grunts. Was it not living an ideal
life? A luxurious nest, a plethora of squashy food, a foster-parent
who watched over it with stern vigilance. If it had been in the
habit of reflecting, it might have thanked its lucky stars that
fate had brought it to a scene where there was no vociferous
competition for mother's milk, no trapesing through blady grass as
one of a hustling brood, no sort of care or anxiety regarding the
next meal.</p>

<p>About a month before the advent of the pigling, Lucy had made
Ned gloomy and thoughtful by becoming the mother of a piccaninny,
about a span-and-a-half long, the colour of a tan shoe, with
whitish soles to its feet, and hands and fingers so crumpled and
soft, and of such tender hue, that they might have been the
unfolding frond of a tree-fern. About the same age as the pigling
that protested shrilly if George's other duties belated meal-time,
the piccaninny so seldom made a sound that its devoted mother began
to imagine that it never would. Within its tiny hutch it kicked
feebly, grasped at empty nothings with fern-like fingers, grimaced
and writhed in an agonized attempt to cry, and emitted a squeak so
puny and faint that it was hardly worth an effort so painful. But
in its mother's ears that beetle-power sound was as charming as the
din of a corroboree.</p>

<p>George ignored the piccaninny, but took the pigling to his
heart, ever and anon assuring the community that very soon it would
be fat and tender. He hung about its hutch, contemplating its
proportions in the exulting, gruesome mood of that midshipmite who
seasoned the steamy cauldron, and, no doubt, hummed to himself in
Greek, "How very very nice you'll be!"</p>

<p>Both youngsters prospered. The piccaninny began to make her
voice heard. Her fingers unfolded. Her complexion became that of a
new penny and her mother foresaw all sorts of charms in her face.
The pigling squeaked when hungry (which was seldom), grunted when
satisfied, snored when asleep (which was often) and spent all the
time putting on fat; and its foster-parent saw more of beauty in
its rapidly rotunding figure than did Lucy in her wrinkled and
crumpled offspring.</p>

<p>As far as interested observers could judge, both parties were
happy, each tolerant of the other's pet, each anxious to
demonstrate the peculiar fascinations of pigling and piccaninny,
respectively. Interested observers, moreover, came to the
inevitable conclusion that, at this stage, for intelligence and
appreciation of the appropriate benefits of life the pigling had
the advantage. George liked it and in a sense bullied it. It knew
George and liked him and bullied him, and, true to his cast of
mind, George liked the bullying, responding by scratching the
bully's pink-and-white back until it squirmed and wriggled in
ecstasies of delight.</p>

<p>The dogs watched the petting from a distance; for George scowled
fearsomely when they approached the hutch, and promised exquisite
tortures if they dared to sniff. They also pricked their ears when
the piccaninny began to wail above a whisper. It was a foreign
sound to them, impossible, for all their restraint, to ignore. The
conduct of both, however, was admirably discreet. They were
interested. No affectation in that respect could avail. They were
curious, but their curiosity was tempered by wisdom. They were
obviously jealous, but suppressed that emotion under a pose of
austere superiority. How could high-spirited dogs be sincere in
their indifference to two strange animals, one vocal with
assertiveness, the other a mere whimperer? They glared out of the
corner of their eyes while their tails waggled the assurance that
both were quite safe so far as they were concerned. If
Debil-debil's state of mind was interpreted aright, all his
sentiments were humanized by that great gift of his&mdash;humour.
He would direct sudden gleams of actual savagery towards the
grunter's hutch, and then, turning towards his master would, like a
popular actress grinning with her teeth, demonstrate love and
affection and universal peace and goodwill!</p>

<p>Brooking no contrary opinion on the point, George decided the
date of the execution of the pigling, foretelling a rare feast,
and, of course, Ned and Lucy did their share of anticipatory
gloating.</p>

<p>Two days before the fatal date, while the sun was below the
sheltering hill, Ned discovered that during the night the
half-expected had happened. Unable longer to resist temptation, the
dogs had overturned the pigling's hutch, scratched and torn at the
door until it flew open, and the rest was&mdash;!</p>

<p>There sat the upturned hutch, minus its petted occupant, while
the dogs stood by, sniffing and tail-wagging with what appeared to
be a blending of self-accusation and plea for mercy in their faces.
Who could blame dogs for the inability to resist so pleasant a sin?
When George came on the scene, anger and grief made the hills
vocal.</p>

<p>On the assumption that the dogs might have merely chased the
pigling into the jungle and that it might be tracked by them, they
were encouraged to sniff the hutch, which they did joyfully, and
with Ned, experienced tracker, in the lead, all the able-bodied of
the Isle joined in the hunt. The dogs, leading across the paddock
to the ravine, ran, nose to ground, down its steepness and up
through the orange plantation, followed enthusiastically by Ned and
the others, just as the character of country permitted. Early in
the hunt the dogs put up a scrub-fowl, which noisily fluttered and
spluttered through the jungle, and, ending its flight on a lofty
branch, jeered and chuckled as it peered down at the intruders.</p>

<p>Then Debil-debil scented a big brown lizard, cosy in a hollow
log and loudly appealed for help, which Ned gave with a stick; but
Cricket had the best of the luck and made a good catch. Debil-debil
scored with a fat rat which, nosed out of its nest of leaves, had
scampered up a slender sapling. Leaping high, he jostled the rat to
the ground and snapped it up with the alertness of a conjurer.</p>

<p>Being now hot for the chase both dogs ran wild, quartering the
shady places industriously, and soon struck off up the steep slope
on a good scent. In a few minutes they gave tongue, yapping and
yelping with uncontrollable eagerness. Through the undergrowth, Ned
in advance, we struggled as fast as lawyer vines, the prickly
raspberry (almost as obstructive as barbed wire), saplings and
shrubs interwoven with creepers permitted; for did not humanity and
love for delicately-fed pigling demand that the fugitive should not
be altogether wasted on the dogs?</p>

<p>Hot and puffing, with scratched and bleeding hands and arms, and
George anything but poetic in his terms of denunciation, we got up
to the dogs&mdash;to find them frantically trying to unearth a
spiny ant-eater, which was just as frantically but mutely digging
itself in among a mat of roots!</p>

<p>George poked up the animal with a stick as Debil-debil took a
spell, his bleeding muzzle showing that the "porc" had drawn first
blood. Without a pick and shovel, extrication was impossible;
besides, we were after a distressed and homeless pigling, not a
porc disturbed while at home in ease. George wanted to put in
operation tactics he had once applied at Hinchinbrook when his pup
had scented out a porc and fought it for three hours, with claws
and teeth and voice. Night had come on and then George took the
part of the pup. A jamtinful of kerosene was poured on to the
creature's back and touched with a match.</p>

<p>"That pup he work for t'ree hour; he dig out t'ree barrow-load
ground. In t'ree seconds that porc he run feefty yard like star,
that pup biting fire all the time!"</p>

<p>Forbidden to experiment with fire on the pet porcs of this Isle,
George became sulky, and said awful things about Debil-debil, which
the good dog accepted as compliments, no doubt concluding that
George's blistering terms were meant for the porc.</p>

<p>Calling off the dogs, the hunt went farther afield, Ned
exhorting both; but naught was seen save ordinary vermin. In the
afternoon we took a different direction, under the leadership of
Ned, whose theory it was that the pigling was still alive, but too
frightened to respond to affectionate and soothing calls. The dogs
enjoyed themselves, and so, apparently, did the blacks and George.
Alas, results were negative, though Ned skilfully pointed out fresh
tracks and once said that he heard the lost pigling's squeal.</p>

<p>A season of regrets, tempered by philosophy, followed.</p>

<p>George's incessant proclamation of the richness of a roast
sucking-pig crammed with herbs had created imaginary bilious
attacks. Besides, there was far too much of garlic in his scheme of
flavouring for the tastes of those denied more than a strictly
poetic sight of the Levant. He was excitedly, deeply affected by
the loss not only of a pet, but of a prospective feast that would
have smothered the subtle scents of the Isle. Others beheld the
silent hutch without the tribute of a sigh.</p>

<p>Lucy continued to smile as the piccaninny passed from the
squealing to the squalling phase. Even Ned's responsibilities
seemed less tragic.</p>

<p>Just as George had become reconciled to the loss of the pigling
the piccaninny vanished&mdash;not alone either. Both father and
mother accompanied her. The hut on the beach was silent&mdash;and
smellful. On a shelf was half a loaf of bread and half a tin of
jam. Sticking in the roof was an unfinished boomerang. On the walls
were pictures from illustrated papers, and on the floor oddments of
raiment and a mattress of bags. There had also vanished from its
anchorage a big flattie belonging to a fisherman, a countryman of
George's. Two days later the owner came to recover the boat, and
after a week's search found it on the mainland, high and dry.</p>

<p>Three months passed, then George, having occasion to visit the
mainland, discovered something for which he was not looking and has
never been able to see&mdash;a popular joke. It was rife and blithe
in every blacks' camp between the mouth of the Tully and the Tully
Falls up among the ranges, and from the Hull River to Wreck Creek
down by Cardwell. And when the blacks take hold of a joke the birds
of the air hear of it. Cockatoos scream it; scrub-fowls chuckle
over it; honey-eaters make a song about it; the listening lilies
overhear the lotus-birds whispering it, and, nodding, smile.</p>

<p>Every black grinned like "Debil-debil," for there was not one
but knew that the perfidious Ned, and Lucy and the giddy piccaninny
had eaten the pigling.</p>

<hr>

<h3>PETER: A FISHER OF MEN</h3>

<p>Weakly, sedately, yet not lacking mincing precision, Peter
slowly followed the margin of the rippleless sea.</p>

<p>The boys, at the moment busy cleaning and painting the boat
resting on her cradle, knew him and smiled at his pensive progress.
Further, they made jerky remarks about him in their own tongue, one
word of which&mdash;"Ba-bah"&mdash;gave clue to his character.</p>

<p>Approaching the busy scene he slowed down, hesitated, and,
glancing ahead, saw that it was not possible to pass along to the
corner of the Bay, into which the babbling creek flows, without
incurring the derogatory asides of his contemptuous countrymen. His
glance back towards the sand-spit, where the water is deep, was
momentary; with an assumption of friskiness&mdash;too energetic a
term for so mild and transient a mood&mdash;he ventured nearer and
politely greeted me, holding his battered hat abaft his shoulder.
There was such humiliation in his attitude and tones, such
obsequious deference, that a cheery response was necessary to set
him at ease.</p>

<p>Hunger and illness were plainly written in his face; but he
smiled wanly as I intercepted him and gave him the formal freedom
of the Isle,</p>

<p>"Ba-bah" described him.</p>

<p>In his left hand he carried an aggressively sacerdotal book, and
from his arm, in the approved style, hung the crooked handle of an
umbrella of the past, its ferrule shining with the polish of the
sand. His right hand balanced with unstudied ease a long and
slender fish-spear. In the meekest of tones he said that he had
fever&mdash;too many of his fellow exiles were at the moment making
like complaint, but in different terms. His was the voice of the
patient martyr intent upon the edification of the unelect.</p>

<p>"I have had nothing to eat this morning, Mister. I was just
going out to spear some fish. Will you let me go round to the other
little bay? I won't do any harm. I am a very releegious boy,
Mister. I like going by meeself, away from the other boys. I can
read a little of this good book; but not much, Mister. It is the
Bible."</p>

<p>He spoke slowly and with novel inflection, as if understudying
some mouthing pulpiteer, and turning over the leaves of the book,
glanced at the print. It was the <i>Book of Common
Prayer</i>&mdash;held upside down.</p>

<p>"I am very seeek this morning, Mister; but I must not grumble,
for I am a Christian. I am a very releegious boy, Mister. I am
Church of England boy, Mister. This book tells me true. I must be a
good boy."</p>

<p>Tremulously weak and quite beyond the spearing of fish, he
brisked up when told to go to the house for physic and food,
returning in about an hour quite translated, to announce to the
ribald boys that the mistress of the house was also a Christian.
Fish spearing no longer an urgency, he sat in the sun, ignored the
other boys and told of his conversion, of his hatred of bad
language, of playing cards, and prayerless companions. He tried to
do good.</p>

<p>Like others with a mission. he earned jeers. The boys said he
was cranky. Was a man cranky when he tried to stop boys from using
bad language and playing cards? The good book told him he ought to
make Christians.</p>

<p>The paint-besmeared boys giggled.</p>

<p>Peter had his dinner apart at the house, and disappeared.
Referring to him afterwards, the boys said, "Ba-bah!"&mdash;and
giggled.</p>

<p>The natives' camp was on the sand-spit under the shade of the
ever-sighing beach oaks. Most of its occupants were would-be
escapees from the settlement over the water. Some were not quite
virtuous. Indeed, they were rowdy as well, deceitful, and as lazy
as overfed pups. The camp boasted of cards&mdash;a grubby, frowsy,
and incomplete pack; and the boys spent most of the nights playing,
or rather imitating the playing of, euchre, with language of the
strongest type as the chief part of the game.</p>

<p>At daylight next morning one of the truly respectable members of
the camp was at the house, wild-eyed and fear-stricken. He told of
certain nocturnal happenings, and on the strength of his story I
went to the beach. The boat-shed was half full of scared gins and
big-eyed piccaninnies, and thence towards the sand-spit sleepers
were distributed at odd intervals, just above the limit of high
tide. The only occupants of the camp were Peter, his wife and
little boy. They were peacefully asleep.</p>

<p>Dick&mdash;truthful, gentlemanly Dick&mdash;told of the
happenings of the night. The card-players had indulged in imaginary
gambling and real language to the tormenting of the soul of the
righteous Peter, who had exhorted them to give up their bad habits
and become Christians, until, driven to desperation by the jeers
and the taunts of "Ba-bah!" he had let loose all his zeal and
endeavoured to convert the heathen with the fish-spear unused
yesterday, and with the might of a much-refreshed arm.</p>

<p>In the blackness of the night the camp had vanished. Better the
whole scene to his Christian self and family than the presence of
gamblers given to unwholesome phrases. In his exalted mood he had
not discriminated, for unoffending Dick and his family and all the
other quiet folks had been driven into darkness with the
triple-pronged spear, and not one of the crowd, orderly or
disorderly, dared to whisper "Ba-bah!" lest Peter., in his repose,
might hearken and be saucy.</p>

<p>When the Christian family awoke, Peter, without the slightest
taint of exultation, corroborated all that Dick had told, merely
adding that, being a very "releegious" boy, he could not stand the
bad language and bad habits of the gamblers, and had taken the
course of stopping both by hostile demonstrations with his spear
and the repetition of some texts from the Bible.</p>

<p>As he glorified his actions, his wife, Maude, sauntered up and
was presented. She, too, was civil, not to say choice, of speech,
and quickly made proclamation of her Christianity and abhorrence of
evil-speaking and cards.</p>

<p>If there exist social and other grades of society among the
descendants of the original occupants of this favoured land, and if
the hint of such an idea may be carried to finality, then does
Peter stand apart as the representative and exponent of the Oxford
style and air towards his degenerate fellows. In his attitude to
them the grace of humility is abandoned. In demeanour and utterance
he is a class by himself&mdash;superior, convinced of his
superiority, rather disdainful of those who are not such as he.</p>

<p>The last of the family to crawl out of a scanty blue blanket was
a neatly-dressed boy of about eight, who came forward with
assurance. Maude indicated him as "My little boy." Peter referred
to him not as Bill or Billy, or even Will or Willy, but as
"Will-yam," with lofty and dogmatic stress on the "yam." Neither
approved of the society at the settlement. It was rude. Besides,
there was no school, and it was the purpose of his parents that
Will-yam should have the advantages of a superior education. Maude
emphasized the point. Willyam must be sent to a good school. Peter
declared that Will-yam must learn to read the good book and be a
Christian like himself, a very "releegious" boy, and a Church of
England boy. He must never gamble or use bad language. To these
terms Will-yam meekly assented. And there stood on the beach an
elated, happy, self-satisfied family, though it possessed naught
but two thin blankets, a fish-spear, the handle of a discarded
umbrella. and a prayer book, soiled with grease and smoke!</p>

<p>Peter was no longer humble. He had been victorious; he was
proud. Had he not rebuked the scornful, piously burnt the broken
pack, and with a frail weapon scattered a hostile and hideous
crowd?</p>

<p>Exhorted to refrain from violence, however earnest in the spread
of Christian knowledge, and in the suppression of gambling, in
concern for the purity of speech, Peter's eyes flashed with the
inflammable fervour of the fanatic. The coarse-tongued boys were
right. He was in fact "Ba-bah;" but until he was under proper
supervision the derisive word lapsed; the boys kept at a safe
distance and there was not a giggle left in them!</p>

<hr>

<h3>BILLY TOO-GAL'S GHOST</h3>

<p>This story had the chance of being quite true. It would have
been so, but for the denial of certain surly facts. So much the
worse for the story.</p>

<p>As half-forgotten incidents became fixed in mind and were
associated with happenings of the recent past, righteous endeavours
were made to discover corroborative evidence of doubtful points;
but fact and fable had become so blended that little could be done
in the way of sorting out.</p>

<p>Would it not have been satisfactory to all concerned if it could
have been proved that the rusty rifle-barrel lying among odds and
ends in the barn was ever in the possession of Billy Too-gal
(otherwise "Billy of the Leg") and that it had been a serviceable
weapon with carefully polished stock and rather more of brave brass
in its mountings than is the style of the day? History is silent on
this important point, while tradition shouts confidently in the
affirmative. Trust rather to the affirmative of tradition than to
the cheerless negative!</p>

<p>Tradition said that Billy Too-gal had been directly acquainted
with the rifle; that he had treasured it during his day, and that
when he had passed into the land of shades one of the mystery-men
of the time had flung it into the sea because he deemed it uncanny,
dangerous, and like to transcend in direct effect the magic in
which he himself dealt. Years afterwards, "Jack Walk About" found
it&mdash;a shapeless mass of rust&mdash;protruding from the sand at
low water, and having chipped away some of the corrosion, had taken
it to a certain Isle, as evidence, perhaps, of a forgotten
tragedy!</p>

<p>There be some who declare that Billy Too-gal's affection for the
weapon was a grim sort of sentiment, which had germinated in the
idea that he had suffered strange martyrdom through it. They assert
that the bullet fired by the hasty and aggravated white man struck
him on the left knee, giving to his gait that singular lurch or
strut&mdash;almost rollicking in style&mdash;that his phantom
perpetuated. Others, with equal force, and on, perhaps, slightly
sounder evidence, maintained that the bullet shattered his lower
jaw, so that the vestiges thereof hung loose; that he was thereby
deprived of the ability to masticate his food; that he presented a
repulsive, yet affecting, sight when he strove to appease his
hunger; for was he not driven to throw scraps and fragments into
his cavernous mouth and gulp them?</p>

<p>Poor Billy Too-gal may have been cheeky to the nervous and
suspicious white man who had invaded his country; but his
punishment did not fit his fault. It was excessive. It was cruel.
Not only did it inflict lifelong anguish, sentence him to
insatiable hunger, but it also ruined his temper. Behold him,
thenceforward, a fierce-eyed man, tall and very lean, with a strut
that would have been ludicrous on the stage, a wide-open,
slobbering mouth, with portions of a frayed and dangling jaw.</p>

<p>His ghost retained, as ghosts should, the disfigurements of
life&mdash;so the wise old men proclaimed with voices of authority
that brooked no question. Those who were coeval with him had good
cause to recollect his singularities, his eccentricities, his
passionate and explosive moments. Not an infant in many a camp who
did not recognize his phantom when the sages gathered together to
discuss affairs of moment, for prying piccaninnies were kept in
check by threats of the return to life of Billy Too-gal, with his
fearsome, mobile head and the strut that swung his body to the
right at every step. Billy was a "bidg-eroo" (malignant
"debil-debil"), that would still the squeakiest piccaninny, and
make her hide her eyes against her mother's side or on the mangy
coat of the pup she happened to be cuddling.</p>

<p>Boys might assume a tremulous air of bravado; but did ever one
of them venture out on to the beach after dark, where, their elders
declared, Billy of the Leg was wont to spend impatient nights
spearing Too-gan? No; the boys, defiant in a crowd in daylight,
cowered in camp after dark, for Billy's strut as he slid along the
beach gave him the faculty of glaring sideways with paralysing
potency. They knew, too, that from the bark band across his
forehead was slung a dilly-bag big enough to hold a captured
piccaninny for breakfast, if the sleepy Too-gan failed to waver
within range of his spear. For these reasons, the bold-at-daylight
boys kept in the background after dark, glad of the muffling
blankets teeming with fleas.</p>

<p>Old, old men had often told of Billy's pitiful destiny. It was
his to strut tracklessly along the beach every dark night, from the
lonesome camp on the edge of the mangroves at Wongaling Creek to
the intrusive rocks, there to stand, in a furious temper, waiting
the never-to-be-granted chance of spearing a sleepy fish, his body
the while swinging to and fro, and the big dilly-bag swaying
uneasily from shoulder to shoulder.</p>

<p>If, said they, he was ever lucky enough to snap up a plump
piccaninny&mdash;girl preferred&mdash;he would cut her to pieces
with a shell-knife and use her for bait. Then he would be certain
to catch a sleepy fish, and when he had eaten it his hunger would
be appeased, and he would walk the beach no more.</p>

<p>Never was any piccaninny bold enough to think of Billy Too-gal
as other than a terrifying phantom with a yearning for bait of most
distressing kind, until You-an-linga&mdash;a dreamy little
girl&mdash;dreamt a strange dream.</p>

<p>All the kiddies of all the camps knew that even the long-legged,
light-footed little birds that ran trippingly over the sand at the
edge of the blue sea made distinct tracks. You-an-linga dreamt that
she saw Billy Too-gal lurching along the beach, with swinging head
and gaping mouth. So vivid was the dream that she did not regard it
as one. She firmly believed that she had seen the
piccaninny-scaring man in the very flesh, and being, as some
dreamers are, quite practical, she thought of following his tracks
under the assurance and protection of the morning's sun.</p>

<p>Being intuitive by nature, she concluded that Billy Too-gal
would be certain to make a distinctive track, though no one had
ever seen the records in the sand of his passing to and fro. She
knew the track of every one of the denizens of the camps, and read
into each never-failing characteristics. Though she might not have
seen a group straggle off aimlessly along the beach, she could tell
by a glance at the tracks the individuals of the party, where they
had gone, why, and make good guess at what they were doing at the
fleeting moment.</p>

<p>You-an-linga was able so to do because she had a gift. All
enjoyed it in varying degrees; but in her case it was developed so
remarkably and applied so vividly&mdash;recollect that intuition
was also hers&mdash;that some of the crude folks believed her to be
"ba-bah" (cranky). Could she not track the big
"Oo-boo-boo"&mdash;the long-legged wolf-spider&mdash;and tell where
it would be found next day hugging its dilly-bag?</p>

<p>Being thus quite out of the ordinary, You-an-linga was looked
upon despitefully by others of her age, so that she was often
lonely and occupied herself with affairs that had but slight
interest to the swarms of piccaninnies. She likened the dilly-bag
(egg-capsule) of "Oo-boo-boo" to a "chillen," and got one from an
interested white man as a reward for the aptness of the similitude.
It was then that she told the visitor of the passing the previous
night along the beach of Billy Toogal, whose head was loose "all
asame Yam-boo" (praying mantis). She had not seen Billy Too-gal
after the sun came up, but last night she saw him, and he was no
good:</p>

<p>"Me no lik'm that fella. Might be that fella kill'm piccaninny.
Me look out proper. What for that fella no mak'm track?"</p>

<p>You-an-linga's father and mother stood by and smiled. Their
smiles were not quite honest. Did they not implicitly believe that
Billy Too-gal was a snapper-up of such trifles as piccaninnies at
large on the beach after dark? And since, in their way, they loved
You-an-linga, they sought to terrify her with stories of the
nocturnal savage with huge mouth, and were afraid when she did not
betray the slightest apprehension, but rather was eager for
investigation.</p>

<p>The wise-heads in the camps looked upon Billy Too-gal's phantom
as the best item of an excellent stock-in-trade of mysteries, and
would not, without harsh forms of protest, submit to it being set
at naught by a piccaninny. You-an-linga was beginning to talk about
their pet ghost in a familiar strain, and they plotted to get rid
of her, so that their reputation as sorcerers and their rights as
custodians of the mysteries might be strengthened.</p>

<p>Secretly they debated a situation boding little good, and
decided that for three nights in succession Billy Too-gal's ghost
should parade the beach, and that all the camps should have the
chance of witnessing the coming and the passing of the apparition.
On the third night You-an-linga would be picked up and disappear
from the camp forever. Then in a quiet spot they would eat the
piccaninny's vital parts and so assimilate some of the rare
qualities which she had displayed. They would thus confirm their
renown, rid the camp of a disturbing element, and secure for
themselves the singular powers which had been hers.</p>

<p>Too-bee (The Maggot), played the part of the restless phantom on
the first night. More than one quaking individual saw the lop-sided
head, the appalling mouth, the huge dilly-bag dancing from shoulder
to shoulder. You-an-linga heard early of the nerve-shocking
apparition, and sat and shivered, wrapped in her father's blanket.
When the sun rose, she scrambled out and raced with others to the
beach. Never before had Billy Toogal made tracks. His footprints
were plain to be seen, and the children huddled up and scampered
back.</p>

<p>You-an-linga had seen enough. She knew Toobee's tracks as surely
as she knew her own father's. and her gift of intuition caused her
to conclude that he was making a fool. of them all; nor was she
wise enough to keep her own counsel.</p>

<p>Naturally, the old men were vexed, and Too-bee indulged in
demonstrations towards You-an-linga with a weighty waddy. Innocent
enough of any thought of defiance, she boldly said that Too-bee had
been "Play about, all asame gammon; me no 'frait."</p>

<p>Billy Too-gal was next represented by Oon-narra (The Cloud), and
with such realistic effects that the camp buzzed for the rest of
the night. None could now deny the existence of the ghost. Brave
would be the man or woman or piccaninny who would trust to the
beach when it had been announced by the mystery-men that it was
reserved for the ghost. The envious crowd flattered the old men.,
renewed their demonstrations of deference, and contributed all
sorts of fat things, from oysters to scrub-turkey eggs, to their
fires.</p>

<p>Again You-an-linga satisfied herself from the best of all
evidence that, light-footed as The Cloud might be, he had merely
mimicked Billy Too-gal; but she kept her opinion to herself until
the evening when she took her diffident father and mother into her
confidence. She proposed that they should wait on the beach for
Billy Too-gal, and that when he appeared her father should spear
him, and then kill him alonga head with a tomahawk&mdash;"dead
finis"&mdash;and take his dilly-bag and long fishing-line for his
own. The proposal was decidedly obnoxious to Mur-juri (The Cicada),
You-an-linga's father, who being quite commonplace, had never
questioned the authenticity of any ghost; but having only the
fag-end of a fishing-line, and entirely lacking a dilly-bag, he was
tempted. The mother's repugnance was also overcome by the thought
of the huge dilly-bag her husband had actually seen and
described.</p>

<p class="cp"><b>*</b>
</p>

<p>The trio stole quietly out and snuggled into depressions in the
still warm sand.</p>

<p>Nor had they to wait long. The night was cloudy, with a fresh
south-east breeze bearing in from the sea a mist that seemed to be
luminous. The crests of the rustling breakers, blown ashore,
mingled with the mist, making a thin margin of vapour, which
blurred, yet exaggerated, the form of Kurran-doola (the Millepede),
the wiliest and most resourceful of the mystery-men who imitated
Billy Too-gal's lurching gait on the third night.</p>

<p>You-an-linga's mother screeched when the substantial phantom
came abreast of the lair, but at the same moment Murjuri hurled his
dugong spear. The range was short; the aim true. Down went the
phantom with a grunt, and one blow of the tomahawk silenced him for
ever.</p>

<p>Morning revealed naught. The undertow had taken charge of the
bleeding body and the current conducted it out to sea&mdash;a feast
for sharks.</p>

<p>But what had become of Kurran-doola, the oldest of the old men.
the most mysterious of the mystics? No questions were asked. The
other mystery-men knew that they had been trapped by a piccaninny,
and were sage enough to keep silent.</p>

<p>Years afterwards, You-an-linga was wont to smile capaciously as
she told that she really had seen Billy Too-gal, and that he made
tracks "all asame" Too-bee, Oon-narra, and Kurran-doola!</p>

<p>In time the old men, taking up the cue, laid it down
authoritatively that You-an-linga was quite right; and that her
discovery proved that Billy Too-gal still walked the beach on
cloudy nights. Mystery-men, of whatever complexion, are ever artful
in explaining awkward complications by added mystification.</p>

<p>But what became of the hasty white man whose deed had provoked
Billy Too-gal's ghost hungrily to strut the wholesome beach? Billy
Too-gal never actually said; but the old men had so vividly
interpreted his gestures that the younger, in their love of
movement and display, in time embodied them as one of the most
frequent themes of their corroborees. What did this crudest of
dramas, with its beggarly array of sticks and slips of barks as
stage properties, reveal?</p>

<p>A solitary tent. Billy Too-gal, his wound still raw, creeps from
a background of cycads, noiselessly as dew, tomahawk in hand. He
enters. A pause. A thud. A grunt. Several groans. Silence. Billy
Too-gal gropes his way out, carrying a rifle. He looks round.
Putting down the rifle, he picks up two thin sticks and squats, and
holding one with his toes, twirls the other between his palms.
Presently a faint blue smoke arises. A glow appears like a ruby in
a black setting, and is gently flicked on to a leaf. Tenderly he
breathes on it, waves it to and fro, and it flames. With a torch of
grass he fires the tent and watches, and gathers dry cycad fronds
to ignite the smouldering blankets. He seizes the rifle nervously,
carries it to the brink of the lagoon, and, leaning over so that
his footsteps may not impair the muddy margin, drops it so gently
that neither lily leaf nor bud wavers, and&mdash;without once
looking back&mdash;slowly disappears. After an interval he
reappears with wide-open, slobbering mouth and a hooked stick,
fishes for the rifle, and with it&mdash;exit!</p>

<p>Thus, though Billy Too-gal does not nightly walk the beach in
ungovernable, voiceless rage, the camp clatters and chuckles over
the mimicry of his revengeful deed.</p>

<hr>

<h3>THE PASSING OF SAM</h3>

<p>Sam was ever a masterful man. Big and strong, hasty, passionate
to a direful degree when aroused; gentle to his chubby children;
corrective to those whom he deemed to be wrongdoers, he had some of
the essential qualities of the schoolmaster and no little of the
persuasive eloquence of the preacher. It boots not to dwell on his
defects, for Nature has claimed her final penalty; but it may not
be possible to understand his character aright if the
popularly-believed reason for his banishment from his native isle
be not referred to.</p>

<p>He was born on one of the islands of Torres Straits which has
benefited by Papuan influence in many respects. There the type is
far more intelligent than that of the mainland of Australia. Men
and women learn some of the advantages of civilization more
readily, and under judicious training become in some cases quite
worthy of exercising certain of the privileges of self-government.
The late Sir William MacGregor testified to this, and has given
instances of the wisdom and moderation with which the "Councillors"
of the Straits Islands exercise their administrative and judicial
functions.</p>

<p>Born of such a race, it was natural that a big, strong, lusty
man should have opinions of his own, and should be given to
expressing them. Though no positive statement has come to my ears,
it is said that in a fit of justifiable wrath he inflicted
punishment so violent on his wife that she died. He knew something
of the scriptures, and perhaps interpreted all too dreadfully that
injunction to pluck out the offending right eye and cast it away.
Sam's punishment for so wicked an offence against the laws of
humanity was lifelong banishment from the island he called
home.</p>

<p>He married again, and had a family of four round-eyed, happy
children, and at the Settlement his was the first hut to show
regard for the decencies, if not the niceties, of life. He began
his garden with sweet potatoes and taro. The flowers and shrubs
that followed bloom for others. Thanks to the good policy of the
State in respect of the population of the Straits Islands, Sam was
early able to read and write. Several of his pencilled notes prove
that he spelled correctly and wrote neatly.</p>

<p>Being thus, generally, so much superior to the great majority at
the Settlement in type and attainments, Sam became an unofficial
leader&mdash;a tutor and a pastor. He established a night-school in
which the children were taught their alphabet and rudimentary
spelling. He delivered addresses, read the Bible, taught the
singing of hymns, and in other matters endeavoured to persuade
young and old to live decently and in order. His Sunday services
became, for a time, an institution.</p>

<p>Under his directions, and with his thick-voiced., solemn words,
the dead were buried at that spot where, as one epigrammatic native
of the locality said, "Boy he sit down altogether!" They had been
wont to strap their dead, knees to chin, and so to place them in a
shallow grave, until Sam persuaded them to swathe the body in a
blanket and to rest it in the sleeping posture in the sand, with
head to east.</p>

<p>What was in his mind when he forbade the mourners to kill a
death-adder which slowly twisted past an unfilled grave of one who
had died suddenly? Did he look upon the deadly little snake as one
of the emblems of immortality of which he had so often
talked&mdash;living, yet the personification of evil and of
death?</p>

<p>Sam's intellectual qualities were in harmony with his physical
capacity. Like one of Shakespeare's characters, he was in the best
sense "a good man of his hands;" he used edged tools so neatly and
effectively that a professional carpenter regarded him as a useful
and capable assistant.</p>

<p>Such a man among such a community of coloured folks as that of
the Hull River Settlement stood out as an individuality whose
influence tended in the right direction. With his death in his
prime a good element was lost, for he at least was unchartered. He
performed the offices of schoolmaster and of pastor&mdash;he was
wont to call himself "a church worker"&mdash;unofficially and
without money and without price. The unction with which he gave out
a hymn and read the collects showed that in his own estimation he
had a call for the work in which he most delighted. He was no
slovenly pastor, vexing the dull ears of a sleepy and indifferent
congregation; but full of vigour and dramatic gesture, so that
those who gathered on Sundays at the accustomed spot were by his
very earnestness compelled to harken.</p>

<p>It may be that among the more benighted of the community Sam's
untimely death may be attributed to the stings of bees. While
taking honey from a "wild" hive he was stung on arms and chest
severely, suffering considerable pain; while in retreat from such
cause he caught cold, which settled on his lungs, and in a few days
pneumonia developed. The medical officer who periodically visits
the settlement happened to arrive while he lay ill, and prescribed
for him; but Sam's case became so serious that he was taken to
Innisfail in the motor-boat for expert treatment in the hospital.
Death claimed him before he could be landed, and four of his
countrymen, an authorized minister, and one of the officials of the
settlement followed him through the rain to his grave. He lies in
alien soil.</p>

<p>His children watched the boat that carried him away as it
disappeared in the North, and in that direction they look for his
return. That "common theme, the death of fathers," is to them, as
it was to Hamlet, particular and poignant. As she sits on the sand
beside her mother, his pet and fondling&mdash;the chubby,
thumb-sucking "Elizabeth"&mdash;stretches fat and clutching hands
across the sea as she cries "Dada! Dada!" and the disconsolate
mother moans aloud and gives way to unavailing tears.</p>

<hr>

<h3>SAMBO'S STRATEGY</h3>

<p>Not long since a black boy, for whom Sambo may pass as a name,
found himself stranded at Cooktown. He had finished a long
engagement on board a b&ecirc;che-de-mer schooner, had been duly
paid off, had spent his earnings in the off-handed and open-handed
fashion of his race, had loafed until weary of the town camp, and
then suddenly became sick&mdash;violently sick. It was only an
attack of home-sickness, but it took complete possession of
him.</p>

<p>His country was separated from the port by some sixty miles, and
though it was conterminous with the beach, to reach it Sambo would
have to pass through the territory of three or four tribes which,
if not actually on unfriendly terms with his own people, certainly
offered no guarantee for the safety of lone strangers within their
gates. Strangers who came to them were absorbed, and no subsequent
questions revealed trace of them. So Sambo did not care to face the
perils of the journey by land, and of course, no means of reaching
home by sea were within his personal grasp.</p>

<p>To the police authorities he made moan, claiming the right, most
unjustifiably, of being transported thither at the country's
expense. Being scoffed at, he went away, sorrowful, and because of
his sorrow and sickness, his memory became bright.</p>

<p>The day following his unsuccessful appeal for a cheap passage to
his native shore, he mentioned casually to the chief of the police
that during his recent b&ecirc;che-de-mer engagement a wreck had
been discovered. With due formality his statements were taken down
in writing, and in effect were:&mdash;While in the neighbourhood of
No. 1 Howick Group a lugger in distress had been seen; the weather
was very stormy, and after vainly endeavouring to battle through
into shelter, the vessel fell over on one side, and came up again
and again and fell over on the other, and then sank. At low water
the top of the main mast was visible, but high tide covered it up
completely. None of the wreckage had been seen to float; all hands
had been drowned. The lugger was a stranger, white, painted with a
red mark, "very flash."</p>

<p>Sambo mentioned casually that anybody might go to the wreck, for
the top-mast at low water indicated it. An expert in the ways of
the blacks was called in to discuss the matter, which was causing a
sensation in police circles. Cross-examined by the expert, Sambo
elaborated a still more realistic description of the wreck,
minutely locating it in relation to landmarks familiar to the
expert, and intimating his readiness to pilot a boat to the very
spot. In reply to further questioning, Sambo frankly admitted that
he was sick of the joys of town life, that he longed for home, and
that his country was at Red Point, off which was No. 1 Howick
Island. Thereupon the expert came to the conclusion that Sambo had
invented the "wreck" for a sufficiently obvious purpose.</p>

<p>But the statements to the police were so explicit and
circumstantial, and were so consistently supported by
cross-examination, that the expert's opinion was scouted. It was
well known, remarked the chief of police, that Sambo's country was
opposite the scene of the "wreck," and it was notorious that Sambo
wanted to get home. Everybody knew that. The police were not such
simpletons as to be taken in by a black boy, and one, moreover, who
had nothing to gain by telling an ingenious and elaborate lie. An
appeal for instructions from headquarters resulted in an order for
the despatch of a vessel to search the scene of the wreck and the
neighbouring islands. An officer of the police and Sambo took
passage, the latter repeating his statements with a precision which
convinced everyone save the expert, who in fact, was captain of the
vessel.</p>

<p>Arrived at No. 1 Howick, Sambo was asked, "Where wreck sit
down?"</p>

<p>He replied, "'Nother side. Little bit outside, alonga
point."</p>

<p>The little ship sailed jauntily past the point, Sambo being at
the captain's elbow.</p>

<p>"Little bit more keep away," said Sambo, and in a few minutes,
looking over the side, exclaimed, "Wreck he sit down here!"</p>

<p>At the spot the depth of water was 14 fathoms, and Sambo excused
the non-appearance of the top-mast by saying that it was then high
water. The captain, who happened to be a more trustworthy authority
on the constancy of the tides than Sambo, knew that the hour was
that of low water, and moreover, that a lugger which would show her
top-mast from a depth of eighty-four feet was quite out of place in
Barrier Reef waters.</p>

<p>Sambo looked as wise as ever, extremely confident, and taking
his bearing from close-at-hand points, persisted that the wreck was
down below. His bargain thus having been fulfilled to the letter,
he suggested that further search was not needed.</p>

<p>In the presence of the police officer, the captain then took the
boy in hand.</p>

<p>"That your country, Sambo, over there, Red Point?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Sambo.</p>

<p>"You want to go your own country?" asked the captain.</p>

<p>"Yes," replied Sambo. "more better you land me my country. You
close up now!"</p>

<p>"Now," said the captain. "Suppose you tell me true, I land you
your own country. Suppose you humbug me, I take you back alonga
Cooktown."</p>

<p>"No," said Sambo, "I no humbug you. I wan' get alonga my
country."</p>

<p>"Well, what about this yarn you bin tell Sergeant, and tell 'em
all the time?"</p>

<p>Sambo: "I bin humbug that fella proper!"</p>

<p>"What, you no bin see 'em wreck?"</p>

<p>"No, me no bin see 'em. All humbug. I wan' get back my own
country. You close up now. You put 'em boat alonga water, me go
shore!"</p>

<p>"Yes," said the cheerful captain. "You deserve to get home."</p>

<p>And before dark Sambo, no doubt, chuckled over the success of
his strategy among his comrades and friends.</p>

<h3>A BUSH OCULIST</h3>

<p>Among those of the North Queensland blacks who, of self-choice,
were consigned to Providence's care on the transfer of the
Aboriginal Settlement from the Hull River to the Palm Islands, was
a boy known as "Jimmy." A useless, superfluous creature, needing
special consideration and care, from whom no sort of work might be
exacted, who earned the compassion of his fellows, and, for a
season, that of the then superintendent and his staff, Jimmy found
his days dreary; for he was afflicted with progressive failure of
sight. Sent to a hospital for treatment, he returned wearing tinted
glasses, and that despairing mien which lovers of the light assume
upon realization of their denial "ere half their days in this dark
world and wide."</p>

<p>Before the break-up of the Settlement blindness had come upon
him; but he loved even clouded liberty too well to submit to the
isolation of the distant island, and with others of like sentiments
but unimpaired faculties, he took to the bush. For a time then, the
bush kept them in strict seclusion, providing food and shelter.
Most of the little band were old and feeble or maimed. They could
profitably be disregarded and forgotten. Safe from official
interference, they wandered in the dense jungle, timidly
approaching the homes of white settlers under the compulsion of
acquired habits and tastes. According to nature they loved freedom
and their own land; but contact with whites had taught them to long
for such artificialities as tobacco, tea and sugar, as well as
better garments than rough cloaks of beaten bark, such as their
ancestors wore when the weather was cool.</p>

<p>To obtain such things they began to visit settlers from whom
they had been able to purchase them in former days at the cost of
casual labour. Then it was that "Blind Jimmy" came into view again.
It is said that he was the best conditioned of the camp, for, being
unable to seek for food himself, he was accepted as a charge upon
the rest, and they saw that he shared the common lot, with a trifle
more out of sympathy. When camp was shifted he was conducted along
the narrow tracks by a companion who indicated obstructions, roots
and logs and hollows, and with that wonderful gift of perception
that the blind acquire, he began to get about by himself in a
trivial sort of way, tapping the track with a staff, as is the
fashion of the blind.</p>

<p>Thus, Blind Jimmy became one of the notable characters of the
locality, and whites as well as his own fellows expressed their
commiseration with him so heartily that he assumed the air of
prosperity and almost a cheerful cast of countenance. His tapping
staff, the warnings of his guide, and his ready thanks for gifts in
kind, made him popular in a certain sense, and, submissive to his
fate, he found himself lacking nothing in the way of
compensation.</p>

<p>Drifting with his friends into a strange locality, Blind Jimmy
was brought under the notice of an aged black who had the
reputation of being wise in many things&mdash;in medicine and magic
especially.</p>

<p>Rough, dirty, crude, the "Old Man"&mdash;such was his familiar
title&mdash;peered into Blind Jimmy's sightless eyes, and declared
it possible to make him "see good fellow," with or without his
consent, and forthwith sought out his operative accessories. He
ground a rusty nail on a stone to a fairly sharp point, and so
shattered a sea-shell that he had at service a scalpel, the edge of
which was keener than a razor.</p>

<p>As far as information goes, for the story comes second-hand,
Blind Jimmy was a consenting party; but the Old Man knew enough of
animal physiology to realize that in the circumstances all strain
on the patient's part must be prevented. Blind Jimmy was
spread-eagled on the bosom of Mother Earth; a friend knelt on his
forehead; others sat on his chest and on the outlying parts of his
body, as, with a sing-song, the Old Man began his benign work. What
he actually did may never be ascertained, unless the Old Man's work
is verified by some one "who knows a subtler magic than his
own."</p>

<p>The blacks say that the Old Man cut each eye open, the lids
being held apart by an assistant, scraped away some dirt, and poked
out something with the sharp-pointed nail. As it was operated upon,
each eye was blinked with dirty rag, and when all was over, both
were quickly bandaged to obscure the light. For two days the
patient was kept on his back by force, and when the bandages were
removed he was Blind Jimmy no longer!</p>

<p>Many white folk are ready to affirm that before the operation
the boy was stone blind, and many are just as certain that he now
sees well enough to be able to dispense with his guide and to take
part in the affairs of the camp.</p>

<p>Without assuming overmuch, it may be safe to hazard the opinion
that Jimmy had been afflicted with cataract; but how many surgeons
of the day would have ventured to operate with such crude
appliances, and in the absence of all safeguards? The account of
the feat thus related is vouched for by two friends who know the
boy, and had frequently ministered to him during his sightless
period, both of whom have since seen him walking about
independently of aid.</p>

<p>Incredible as it may seem, one is not justified in expressing
disbelief in the performance of the feat, in the execution of which
the specialists of the day are said to demand weeks if not months
of preparation, a germ-proof chamber, antiseptics and an
anaesthetic, an assortment of instruments, and a period of passive
convalescence. Given that the lens of each eye was removed, will it
be credited that, in the absence of rectifying glasses, the boy is
able to take more than a blurred outlook on life?</p>

<p>A report that might have been anticipated is current, to the
effect that Jimmy's blindness was due to a certain native fruit, to
which whites as well as blacks are partial, known by the former as
"the finger cherry," or berry, and by the latter, locally, as
"pool-boo-nong." It is produced by a jungle scrub, one of the rose
myrtles (<i>Rhodomyrtus macrocarpa</i>). In the jungle it is
spindly, but on the edges thereof may branch out into a robust
habit. When ripe the fruit is purple and of a pleasant, acidulous
flavour. In the late F. Manson Bailey's <i>Catalogue of Queensland
Plants</i>, are two notes concerning the alleged evil properties of
the mouldy fruit: "The diseased fruit is supposed to cause
blindness (myopia) and death." "<i>Gloeosporium periculosum</i>"
(scientific title of the fungus): "Very poisonous; it is this
fungus, probably, which causes blindness, and often death, to
persons eating fruit containing it in quantities."</p>

<h3>FRANK EDWARD'S FALL</h3>

<p>Among the pioneers of a North Queensland goldfield were three
mates, whose prospecting experiences had been varied; but they had
not hitherto touched anything like the present&mdash;the matted
vegetation, the close steamy heat, the rank smells of decaying
vegetation, the breathless humidity. Others had made some sort of a
track to the foothills. Thence upwards the adventurers sought out
an acceptable level for a camp.</p>

<p>Rough, hard, incessant work on hastily-prepared food told on
them. Each knew and obeyed the lure which charms prospectors to the
performance of incredible feats, and said naught. It was all in the
game. Time was far too valuable to waste on domestic affairs, for
the auriferous gravel was patchy.</p>

<p>One morning a family of blacks appeared&mdash;an old man, his
gin, two piccaninnies, all shy and nervous, and a youth of sixteen,
who, bubbling with confidence and self-assurance, announced that he
was "Frank Edward." They had come to "sit down" with the white men
and help them, and incidentally to eat of their tucker. So said
Frank Edward with a superior smirk, as he began forthwith to make a
heap of firewood on the ledge close to the mildewed tent. The rest
of the family huddled together, daring not to look straight at the
white men.</p>

<p>Frank Edward told his hosts that he had been at Jerildoun. His
hat and trousers, and his speech betrayed the frayed edges of
civilization. Being hungry, he demanded flour for a damper. He made
one, not such as would appeal even to a hungry prospector, but
which to the father and the rest, eaten with tea profusely sugared,
made a banquet of ambrosia and nectar. Was it not so written on
their otherwise impassive faces? That family was a fixture as long
as such delicacies were current.</p>

<p>It was nerve-destroying work high up, as the camp was on a
terrace that looked over the broad ribbon of blue to the flounce of
surf created by the Great Barrier Reef. Stifling during the dry
infrequent clear days; vaporous, with the heat of a Turkish bath,
when the mists settled on the roof of leaves. Land leeches took
blood tax, transforming themselves from alert, waving threads to
incapable blobs. The almost invisible mite that burrowed into the
skin made scratching one of the most gratifying pleasures of
existence. On the spot for a very definite purpose, the mates did
not spare themselves. They scratched the terrace all day, and in
retaliation Nature gave them the motive for indulgence in a
similar, but purely personal delight at night.</p>

<p>Alec declared that the game was hardly worth the candle. The
gold was good enough, but there was not quite enough of it. There
was the chance of dropping on something good that might spell
fortune. They must not expect a lottery ticket for nothing.</p>

<p>To Douglas's taste the country was decidedly too damp, but
otherwise not too bad. They were paying expenses. There was the
chance of a big dividend.</p>

<p>Rube, as hard-headed as he was fisted, was not going to give the
show away to the next comer. When the fluming across the big gully
was finished they could turn on the water and bring down the wash
dirt in big lumps.</p>

<p>Soon a steep face was cut into the slope of the terrace. Water
gushed out from the lips of the sluice. The soil melted away, while
the gully below ran red with extravagant but superficial wounds.
Alec likened their activities to the scrub itch on themselves. They
pestered the terrace until it bled and broke into sores which
nature decently and promptly swathed with green. Tolerating no
unseemly sights, lank, limp, succulent vegetation sprang up as if
by magic on the mullock heaps, as did grey fluffy fungus on damp
boots and dripping tucker-bags.</p>

<p>The old man and even the gin and piccaninnies had made
themselves useful, Frank Edward bossing them, as a side-show, with
consummate satisfaction to himself and no little advantage to the
mates. Domineering, self-important, as unlike the typical black as
a sunbird to a swamp pheasant, he bullied his father, scoffed at
his mother, and held the piccaninnies in rigorous subjection.</p>

<p>The mates recognized that he was a personality, and were amused
until he began to patronize them. Then they took to watching each
other's demeanour towards him, confident of an outbreak sooner or
later.</p>

<p>Within a month, Frank Edward, in his own estimation, was running
the camp. He had a say in everything, from the best way to stop a
leak in the fluming to the fixing of the day for the trip to the
port for tucker. He worked like a tiger himself, saw that the
family did its full share, fed it to repletion on damper, and
smiled on the mates with the air of an equal.</p>

<p>Splashed with red clay until he looked like a terra-cotta image
restored to light after concealment under rubbish, steaming with
sweat, fluttering with importance, Frank Edward stood still for a
moment beside Alec, shovelling away some mullock. His sharp eyes
detected a slug.</p>

<p>"No good to me, ole man. You flurry fool, Alec! You chuck'm away
slug."</p>

<p>Alec glared at the naked boy; few of his chums would have cared
to address him as this cheeky savage had. He smiled as the boy
handed him a half-ounce nugget; that smile was ominous, if the boy
had but known. He was so genuine in all he did and unconscious of
offence that Alec smiled another sort of smile.</p>

<p>A few muddy minutes passed, and again the boy found a spec in
the mullock heap, and, full of the white man's ways, shouted: "More
better knock off, Alec. Leav'm job to me. You flurry fool.
Look!"</p>

<p>"Good boy, Frank Edward," soothed Alec. "You find plenty that
fella alonga mullock."</p>

<p>"Me fin'm. You lose'm first time. You flurry fool!"</p>

<p>The reiteration of the offensive phrase was almost insufferable.
Still, Alec held his peace, and the work went on during the pelting
rain, Frank Edward becoming streaky instead of patchy. Thanks in
some measure to his unwearying activity and sharpness, the results
were satisfactory.</p>

<p>"That boy's got brain. He's clever enough for a judge. Never saw
a black that was half his match."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Douglas. "He's a wonder. The way he's got the old
man by the throat is a treat. No; he isn't the stuff for a judge.
Let him loose in a Parliament of blacks, and he'd be Premier,
Secretary for Foreign Affairs, Treasurer, and Chief Executioner in
a fortnight, and until a wooden-headed rival silenced him with a
waddy."</p>

<p>Rube, being half asleep, did not say anything much to the point,
and Alec took up his parable&mdash;</p>

<p>"The fact is, Frank Edward's too big a name for the boy. It
makes him gusty. I'll have to take him down a peg or two."</p>

<p>"If you're going to be rough with him he'll scoot, and the
others with him. Leave him alone. He's a good hand, and costs next
to nothing. Didn't he pick up more than a couple of months' keep
this morning, and a man ought to stiffer being called a fool when
he's entitled to it."</p>

<p>"I know all about that," snapped Alec, "but I can't stand being
called a&mdash;&mdash;one by a flash black boy. I suppose it's a
matter of complexion. He'll have to take a hiding. I think I see
how it's going to be done. I'm not going to be what he calls me
over it."</p>

<p>Alec was cook. Damper, salt beef, jam, tea&mdash;what more did
prospectors who carried all their provisions up from the port want?
Cooking was not a strenuous job.</p>

<p>He pannicanned the flour for the blacks on to the bark dish held
by Frank Edward, sprinkled in an extra allowance of salt, and made
a show of adding soda and acid.</p>

<p>While the damper cooked in its bed of ashes the expectant family
sat watching with avaricious eyes. Occasionally the old man flicked
trifling embers on to it, for he was understudying. Frank Edward
flared and frankly referred to his father as "a flurry ole fool,"
and the old man fancied the term was not one of endearment. He sat
back humiliated, but as eager for the dainty as a half-starved calf
for its mother's milk.</p>

<p>Hooked out from the fire, the acme of present hopes was as flat
as a board, sodden, sticky, blistered on the outside, and studded
with half buried cinders. Frank Edward gazed at it in dismay.
Hitherto he had achieved unvarying success.</p>

<p>Anticipatory and now ravenous, the old man tasted and spat. Salt
does not come to blacks naturally. The sharp foreign flavour
excited suspicion of poison. The longed-for food was less palatable
than the leathery mess made from the "koi-ie" nut. There it was, to
be picked at and sampled at all points, and to be proved fearsome
throughout.</p>

<p>The mates listened to the rumbles of disappointment, and to the
confident explanations of Frank Edward, who bustled up to them.</p>

<p>"What for you mak'm flour belonga me no good. You flurry fool,
Alec. Damper him no good. Ole man he mak'm row alonga me."</p>

<p>"Clear out!" shouted Alec. "Suppose you spoil'm damper that way,
me no give flour."</p>

<p>"Me mak'm all asame. You bin mak'm flour no good. You flurry
fool!"</p>

<p>Alec rose, gripping a pick handle.</p>

<p>Frank Edward side-stepped and retreated.</p>

<p>All day the family sat in camp, as sad and sodden as the damper,
hungry yet unwilling to turn out and forage. Frank Edward's zeal
was tempered by sulkiness. He had eaten but little. Detestable
proof of failure in the very highest art was torturing him, and the
shrill scorn of his suffering kin poured contempt on his pride and
distracted him from thinking out a solution of the humiliating
mystery.</p>

<p>Next morning Alec dealt out the flour unsparingly, omitting none
of the prescribed ingredients. The damper rose as a damper of high
principles should, and being ceremoniously dusted by Frank Edward
with his fragmentary hat, was broken with boastful display.</p>

<p>Smiles lit up the gloomy scene. Was ever food sweeter and more
acceptable? Alec had been profuse. All were replete. The waistless
piccaninnies strutted and frolicked, and slept in token of
content.</p>

<p>It was a merry camp up on the misty ridge, for diplomatic Alec
played upon Frank Edward's pride and conceit until the youth's
fussiness and insolencies became comical. His scheme was working
faster than he had anticipated.</p>

<p>He indulged in another of his curious smiles when Frank Edward
presented the bark dish for the customary flour, and ostentatiously
appeared to add the ingredients to complete the ration, which was
borne off triumphantly. The dutiful family watched the
preparations, while the boy savagely scolded whomsoever presented
an interfering finger.</p>

<p>He patted the dough, dusted dry flour on it, slid it off his
hands on to the ashes, covered it and sat back bloated with
vainglory. Under his patronage the old man was permitted to poke
cinders round it; but the old woman and the piccaninnies,
fascinated though they were, had been schooled to look in another
direction. It was big; it was going to be great.</p>

<p>When it was proclaimed to be cooked Frank Edward buffeted the
ashes, blew upon it, and sat down.</p>

<p>Tough, leathery, sodden, and of alarming taste, the damper acted
like magic. The old man stood up. For once his slow mind was
stimulated to fury. Recalling the bullying of yesterday, he
concluded that the repulsive and probably poisonous thing was the
deliberate and intentional consolidation of the ridicule of his
son.</p>

<p>Touched in his most susceptible quarter, he broke it over the
boy's head. The boy sat down, and before he could rise the old man
was belabouring him with the fire-hardened cane with which he had
been permitted to caress the ruined food.</p>

<p>Although officious, the boy was not a fighter. In his day the
old man had been, and two uneatable dampers and the continual jeers
roused the spirit of his prime. The piccaninnies took cover in the
jungle. The gin shrieked, and true to motherhood, sought to shield,
with her lean body, her offspring from the father's wrath. Hitting
when and where he could, the writhing, struggling forms, the old
man's war-cry, "Damper!" might have been mistaken for a
curse&mdash;and peradventure Frank Edward would have better enjoyed
the language unaccompanied.</p>

<p>Not until the boy had been chastened in spirit, as well as in
body, did the mates intervene.</p>

<p>Subdued and stifled with mystery, he sat whimpering, while Alec,
to commemorate peace, presented the material for another damper,
which compounded and cooked under strict scrutiny of the old man,
proved a masterpiece.</p>

<p>Then it was the old man who swaggered. He sat back and surveyed
the scene. But that niggard Nature had scanted him in such respect
he might have tilted his chin. A dominant feature stood to
him&mdash;not his nose, for that, broadening and flattening,
disappeared, leaving but dilated and cavernous nostrils. His
bloodshot eyes bulged and brightened, while his snort, though like
that of an apprehensive goat, proclaimed his triumph&mdash;that he
was a man in his own right, a master in his own domain, a lord of
creation. No more would he live under the domination of his son. He
had resumed filched rights, and his flashing eyes asserted
determination to maintain them.</p>

<p>The silence of the jungle bore witness that he alone was head of
the family.</p>

<p>Frank Edward quailed.</p>

<p>Alec remarked casually next morning, as the meek boy hopped
about under his father's orders:</p>

<p>"You fellows can't say that I put the acid on him, but it's
there all right."</p>

<p>"No; but he'll be off the first chance," asserted Rube.</p>

<p>"Not he. He'll not forsake damper, and he's too frightened of
the old man. He's the best of this crowd. I don't know," continued
Alec, musingly, "that I'd rather be called a 'flurry fool' by a boy
of that stamp than have him say, 'Beg, pardin, boss.' That's the
beginning of servility. It was low to pay him out for being smart.
What do you say if we send him to school? He's got the brains."</p>

<p>Douglas shouted dissent. "I'll be no party to that. He's a fine
boy. Are you for spoiling him?"</p>

<p>"Spoil him!" jeered Alec. "My mean dodgery and the old man's
poker! Wait till he sees through the trick. He'll spoil us!"</p>

<h3>BILLY, THE GUIDE</h3>

<p>An old, lanky blackfellow who, in his short face and habit of
reticence, tallied with Addison's unflattering description of
himself, is old Billy"&mdash;Lazy Billy," as the hustling white
folks call him.</p>

<p>Billy and two gins, two unnamed piccaninnies, and an alien from
the Malay Peninsula occupied three modest dwellings formed of
bushes and palm fronds, on the verge of the sea. Many dogs were of
the family, grotesque caricatures of dogs, lean to emaciation,
hairless, and sorrowful-eyed with mange, and absorbed in the
never-ending pasttime of scratching. They had no more than just
sufficient courage and concern for the sanctity of the camp to make
a whimpering bark at the sudden appearance of a stranger, hours
after dark; and the barking kept time to the scratching. They
scratched till they squealed, and then moaned and whimpered
again.</p>

<p>It was getting late. The occasion was urgent, and the track
through the jungle, scarcely noticeable in broad daylight, was
absolutely undiscernible in the dark. As the dogs whimpered, and
the piccaninnies&mdash;wearing one hat between them, and nothing
more&mdash;blinked at my lantern, I made a bargain with Billy (a
shilling and a stick of tobacco) for his services as guide.</p>

<p>Dolly tells me the news of the camp. She proposes to name one of
her piccaninnies "Tapus" (Topsy), and while Billy dresses and
equips himself, suggests that I "put 'em name belonga little
fella." Uncanonical though the hour, the rite is performed, and the
blinking, shrinking, naked piccaninny will henceforth answer to
Dolly's rendering of "Tawny."</p>

<p>"You no tchul-eep (sleep) first time?" Lazy Billy asks, with a
yawn. "More better first time tchul-eep."</p>

<p>"No, Billy. We go."</p>

<p>"All right. We go. Tchul-eep bime-by plenty."</p>

<p>For a quarter of a mile the track is as wide as the flat beach
at low water, and as compact and smooth and noiseless as only fine
sand packed by the thuds of the sea can be.</p>

<p>Billy indicates the turn-off with a flourish of his flashing
tomahawk. Many an old bushman refrains from taking precedence in a
narrow track, believing that a black boy is subject to an
irresistible impulse for slaughter when occasions so favour. Billy
is docile, and while I am in the lead he is far too seriously
engrossed in keeping me in the right direction to think of
bloodshed. So we blunder along.</p>

<p>"Where track?"</p>

<p>"Hello! Where track sit down? He go 'nother way. He loss."</p>

<p>The lantern confuses Billy; but directly the light is obscured
he calls out, "Ooo! Track sit down. Me bin catch 'em." And off he
goes in advance, and at a pace that I find not easy to
maintain.</p>

<p>As we enter the jungle, the moist air is heavy with the
breathings of a night-flowering plant, almost too sweet and rich to
be pleasant. Outside, the subdued roll of the sea fills the ears.
Here the myriad leaves strain and filter the sound of the sea to a
mere sediment&mdash;a soft, indeterminate minimum, with which the
nocturnal voices of the jungle blend. A tree-frog squeaks and
grunts; some alert insect chirps, loud and clear; another calls
furtively, in a dismal tone, half whisper, half whistle; a wallaby
thuds ahead; a lizard makes a scatter among the leaves; a bird in
fright flutters, blundering, among the leaves high overhead; the
flying-foxes squeak and gibber among the fig-trees, as they say the
ghosts did in the streets of Rome when great Caesar died.</p>

<p>Billy, no longer bewildered by the light, is well in advance
now. A sense of locality and direction, more acute than is given to
white folks, enables him to walk quickly, even where the track is
obscured with weeds shoulder-high, and where scrub trees and shrubs
mingle unceremoniously with neglected mangoes and oranges. I keep
pace, faithfully following Billy's noiseless footsteps.</p>

<p>Suddenly he stops. "Ooo! Look out!" He cautiously turns up his
frayed trousers beyond his knees, "Look out! Se-n-ake sit
down!"</p>

<p>"Se-n-ake, he sit down!" Billy points among an entanglement of
fig-tree roots, which the quivering flashes of the lantern convert
into dozens of writhing serpents.</p>

<p>"Se-n-ake! He bin sit down. Dolly bin kill 'em alonga waddy. Two
fella ki-ki that fella; no more!"</p>

<p>By the precautionary baring of his shrunk shanks, Billy had
prepared for the happy chance of any of the relatives of the
particular "se-n-ake" which Dolly and Rosy had eaten for supper,
being about. He would have attacked the beast to better advantage
bare-legged; but there was nothing worth eating among the roots as
far as we could see, and Billy, grunting with disappointment,
strode on.</p>

<p>Though old and lean, Billy is a high-stepper and quick of foot;
he never trips nor stumbles. This is his country. He knows every
fallen branch, every root athwart the track, the sky-line of every
tree in the open. His small eyes, set in a short, screwed-up,
wrinkled face, are telescopically keen, and seem equally effective
by day or night. Many coastal blacks refuse to wander about after
sundown. Darkness and light are both alike to Billy. There is
nothing to terrify him in the jungle; he sneers at the hint of a
"debil-debil." His ears catch the faintest sound. On the edge of
the mangroves a big water-rat, dazzled by the lantern, skips a few
yards, and halts, dismayed. Billy had heard its first faint
footfalls, and points where it crouches, paralysed momentarily by
fear.</p>

<p>All these acres of garden through which we have passed, once
flourishing and fruitful, are fast relapsing into primitive jungle.
<i>Sida retusa</i>, Bathurst burr, cobbler's peg, and the infamous
"billy-goat" plant, have their unmolested stronghold whence to
invade the whole district. A bamboo&mdash;a dwarf, ornamental plant
in its distant native land&mdash;runs wild in this congenial
region, forming an almost impenetrable brake, a solid base whence
it is striding over the land.</p>

<p>Billy never pauses.</p>

<p>The narrow track runs up among the rocks, fifty feet above the
sea. Only once is there a spasm of excitement during the long,
silent walk. Billy jumps upon a rock, yelling:</p>

<p>"Look out! Look out! Poi-jon! Poi-jon belonga
dingo&mdash;belonga Jack!"</p>

<p>Right in the cleft of the rocks, roughly widened to form a
footway, lies a poison bait. "Jack," who lives in the little house
that he built on the terrace by the sea, paid tribute in the shape
of sixty fowls this season to the cunning of the yellow dingo whose
remains soil the sand below. The brute would not take bait, and
after long waiting Jack shot him. Billy is terrified of the little
piece of meat spiced with strychnine; but a venomous and alert
snake he gladly encounters, for snake is good to eat! Billy is ever
hungry.</p>

<p>A faint movement in the tree-tops, a fainter sensation of
coolness indicate the rising of the land breeze. The tepid silence
of the night is past, though at the bases of these steep spurs
jutting out into the sea little of the refreshment of the night air
is perceptible. The salty odour of the ocean is supreme.</p>

<p>A quarter of an hour more, and the house on the red cliff is
reached. Do you pampered denizens of the town, with such resources
of civilization as medical men, ambulances, telegraphs, telephones
and cabs at command, realize the stress involved in the conveyance
of a few hapless words of urgent news across five miles of sea and
through three miles of lonely bush? My experience, in itself, was
at least instructive, for all went well, the sea, the night, fate
and some benignant star all favouring. Under other conditions and
without Billy, the duty might have been difficult and dangerous, if
not impossible.</p>

<p>Billy thought only of his "schillin'," and having fulfilled his
contract, demanded summary payment. A new set of wrinkles score his
face at the sight of the shilling and tobacco, and, to my
astonishment&mdash;for the night is far spent&mdash;he elects to
get back to his camp. To the suggestion that he should sleep till
the morning, where he sits, he dissents emphatically.</p>

<p>"Too tired! Me go alonga camp tchul-eep plenty;" and off he
starts in the dark on the three-mile return journey.</p>

<h3>CAUSE AND EFFECT</h3>

<p>All that matters has not yet been said about the recent cyclone
which thrilled the people of this coast, threatened more than it
fulfilled, caused much discomfort, did a good deal of unrecorded
mischief, and inflicted real loss and hardship.</p>

<p>Some of the oldest inhabitants of a certain district are well
assured that the big wind and flood were brought about by human
agency for what the majority of us conceive to be a very paltry
purpose. However deplorable some of the results of the disturbance,
students of meteorology are bound to take into consideration every
incidental circumstance, even though it tends in the direction of
what in drama is known as "comic relief." In the spirit, then, of
offering some out-of-the-way information illustrative of the
subject from a standpoint different from that of the ordinary
"weather-prophet" is this story penned.</p>

<p>Those who read newspapers, and who consult and have greater or
less faith in forecasts, official and others, and who find
themselves elated or otherwise in accordance with the slow-moving
finger of the barometer, generally confirm or deny one another's
sage observations after the event. We are all grateful for the
"special warnings," which in some cases (where telegraphic
communication does not exist) seem to embody the spice of irony,
coming as they do in cheerless print a week too late to be
sensational.</p>

<p>Thackeray tells us that yesterday's unfinished champagne is but
a feeble representation of the staleness of written records of
transient hilarity. How "weary, stale, flat and unprofitable" the
"special warnings" which arrive at remote localities many days
after the cyclone has done its worst; and how greatly are those
inhabiting such spots beholden to the individual who not only
boldly foretells such visitations, but sees that they are not only
in accordance with his passing whims, but up to time!</p>

<p>It happens that in this district there is more than one such
important person. They are natives of the soil, whose accumulated
knowledge, handed down from self-confident father to undoubting
son, is certainly (as far as "the long results of time" may avouch)
in advance of such upstarts as the Commonwealth prophet, who relies
upon day to day information. They who will give, on occasion,
practical proof of capability to push back overshadowing clouds,
laugh indecorously at the pretensions of a "doctor" who
acknowledged inability to make commonplace rain during a
superabundant wet season.</p>

<p>Of such class is "Old Billy," who believes in the existence of a
very singular species of debil-debil known as "Bidgeroo," and many
other weird things utterly beyond the comprehension of unromantic
white men. Old Billy's connections with the recent meteorological
disturbance is summed up in a very few words:</p>

<p>"Old Billy, he bin make 'em milgar."</p>

<p>In our arrogant assumption, we may have thought that it was due
to a monsoonal depression. If we had all known that a week
beforehand, Old Billy had performed the rite in which the "milgar"
is the most potent paraphernalia, we might have saved ourselves the
trouble of watching the barometer, and just have sat back and
calmly waited the inevitable.</p>

<p>Old Billy's warning anticipated the cyclone by a week, and as
there are scores of men along this part of the coast still able to
trace connections between cause and effect, Old Billy's reputation
has been triumphantly applauded.</p>

<p>The milgar is simply a spoon-shaped piece of bark which is put
in a waterhole, and generally attached to a convenient root by a
yard or two of twine, made from the bark of a particular species of
fig-tree. A week after Old Billy's deliberate act, the cyclone
swooped down, accompanied by rains which made Old Billy and others
very uncomfortable.</p>

<p>Now, a "doctor" of Old Billy's renown does not resort to such
extremes unless to work off spite or vexation, and as he is a
silent man given to mumbling, it is not always easy to understand
his meaning, though at times his gestures are wonderfully eloquent.
On this occasion, however, there is traceable a reason for the
exercise of his vicarious anger, if not vengeance.</p>

<p>He has a son, Charley, who took as a child-wife a poor slip of a
girl named Mungallo, with whom he lived for some time. Then his
still-wavering fancy was captivated by a young woman, slightly more
mature, known as Nelly, who lived some miles away, being employed
as a domestic servant. These twain practically eloped; but, after
the topsy-turvy fashion of their kind, took up their quarters at an
old-time spot and induced the juvenile Mungallo to live with
them.</p>

<p>Soon Charley wearied of Nelly, and again smiled on his
child-wife. Unhappily, the smiles were reciprocated, and soon the
uproar in Charley's humpy almost crowded him out. He found that if
marriage is on the path to bliss, with just an occasional swerve in
the direction of purgatory, polygamy is right on the track to the
place where the company, if not the climate, must be very
objectionable.</p>

<p>In due time his marital distresses came to the ears of his
sympathetic father, and Old Billy&mdash;never on the side of the
angels, for has he not had three wives?&mdash;forthwith made a
milgar and put it into a very deep hole in the creek, so that the
wilful females who were "too flash belonga Charley" might have
something else to think about for a few days. That the wind and the
tempestuous rain likewise interfered with his own happiness, was of
little concern to Old Billy, who is a philosopher who can bear more
than the toothache philosophically. But he was guilty of
thoughtlessness. He forgot that about the time when the potency of
the milgar would be working up to a climax, the tides would attain
the highest level of the year. The bumptious surges threatened
destruction to his own home and estate; smashed several boats,
destroyed the best part of a laboriously-built jetty; flooded
houses and lands; performed riotous deeds of beachcombing; and
everybody talked weather for a week.</p>

<p>If Nelly had not been quite so pleasing a jade, if Charley had
been less susceptible to feminine charms; if the injured Mungallo
had bestowed her face and fortune on some other boy; if Old Billy
had chanced to remember the incidence of February's spring tide
(which he was not at all likely to do, for he detests the sea
almost as heartily as he does the Bidgeroo) we had lacked all the
recent excitement, and many would have been better off than they
find themselves to-day.</p>

<p>Old Billy, thinking only of Charley and the brawling females,
worked up a compensatory storm. At least, such is the steadfast
belief of scores of serious-minded men who have had yet another
demonstration of Old Billy's success as a rainmaker, who are
consequently assured of the wisdom of refraining from acts likely
to make him peevish, and in whose eyes he is "a prophet and much
more than a prophet."</p>

<hr>

<h3>RESOURCEFULNESS</h3>

<p>As a rule, the Australian aborigines do not get credit for
exhibiting ingenuity, though they have shown by their weapons,
their fire-sticks, nets and other contrivances that they are not
destitute of ideas. Until within recent times the race had to
depend for its existence on its capacity to adapt material fresh
from the hands of Nature to the supplying of its wants; but there
does not seem to have been any marked progress in regard to the
development of its weapons and domestic appliances, the style of
which varies in localities while preserving general
characteristics.</p>

<p>One of the examples about to be described shows very decidedly
the influence of white folks; indeed, it is merely an imitation,
and is mainly worthy of note because of the skilful adaptation of a
gift of nature to a strictly utilitarian purpose.</p>

<p>Being somewhat envious of a stock-whip in the possession of the
"boss," a boy, who had been accustomed to work among cattle and
liked to be duly equipped, appeared with a substitute, which he
cracked with evident pride and to the speeding-up of the
home-returning cows. As the boy is rather shy, and, avoided
inquiry, no particular notice was taken of the whip until it proved
in his hands its practicability. On casual examination, it was
found to be neatly plaited, well-balanced, though light, and
finished quite in accordance with the recognized art of such
things. The wonder was how it could have been made in the entire
lack of prescribed material. The handle and lash were of one piece.
The boy had taken a straight branch of the beach hibiscus, known in
these parts as "manjar," stripped the bark off nine feet of its
length, and cut out the wood, retaining a f oot with bark attached.
He had then split the bark into four sections, scraped away the
outer and inner layers, graduated the width of each strand, and
made a neat plait.</p>

<p>The whip does, for the time being, due service; but the maker
thinks it a bit light, and fears it may not last long. It is a
local product from the butt of the handle to the cracker, and the
latter, under the boy's expert use, makes a sound like a pistol
shot. Effective, neat, cheap and the work of an idle hour, what
more is wanted among tenderly brought up cows? The chief point
about the whip is not, however, its practicability, but the
evidence it affords of the plastic mind of its maker. From
childhood, no doubt, he would be familiar with the use of hibiscus
bark for all sorts of purposes in which white folks would use tough
string. The necessity for a whip arising, good material for its
making was ready at hand, and the imitation of the manufactured
article must be pronounced to be first-class.</p>

<p>The boy owes much, it is certain, to those who brought him up,
and it is further noticeable that the voice of his young
wife&mdash;they do not talk "pidgin" English&mdash;in quality and
intonation is that of a white girl. In each case association with
white people of practical and cultured ways has directly told.</p>

<p>Another proof of the readiness to improvise effective devices
off-hand was directly due to the presence of a bigger school of
mullet than is commonly seen close inshore. No spears were
available, but one of the boys who became excited by the almost
insolent daring of the fish, had a rusty tomahawk. He raced along
the beach until he found a dry branch of the beach oak, about an
inch and a half in diameter. With all possible haste, he cut off
six feet, split one end crosswise, tapered each of the four parts,
roughly pointed them, spread them by the insertion of two chips,
rushed back to the water-line, and secured a couple of the mullet
before the school were flurried into deep water. The fashion of the
crude spear was true to that in general use, but its weight was
much greater, and in the hands of any but a skilful man would have
been quite impracticable. As usual in such circumstances, the boy
took no credit to himself for having obtained at such slight cost a
supplementary meal for three companions and himself. With a couple
of pieces of driftwood one of them made a fire-stick, and within a
few minutes the unlucky fish were broiling.</p>

<p>It had been intended to secure the primitive fish-spear, as a
specimen to illustrate the skill with which blacks are in the habit
of seizing ready-to-hand material to meet the urgency of the
occasion, but it was found that it had been used as part of the
fuel to cook the fish. The fire-stick, which had been carelessly
tossed aside, was found days after and is still preserved&mdash;a
finer example of the appliance than is usually sent, bedaubed with
ochres, to museums.</p>

<p>While on the subject of the ways and means of the original
owners of the land, it is worth while to recollect that there is
reason to believe they were subject to restraints which prevented
any advancement towards civilization. According to one authority,
the country of each clan, or tribe, was subdivided into areas
restricted to families, and weak families were literally eaten out
by the stronger. There was no interchange of ideas, not the
slightest attempt at the cultivation of the soil, and therefore no
possibility of social progress. In one locality in North Queensland
the most admirable and eagerly sought-after food was human flesh,
and perhaps the next best dainty was a python, or the egg of a
scrub-fowl containing a forward chick. It is suggested that even in
districts where food was comparatively plentiful the race, before
the advent of the white usurpers, was gradually dying out, and that
epidemics raged through the continent occasionally, with direful
results.</p>

<p>There are grounds for the belief that the blacks even suffered
from an infectious disease similar to influenza, which they
described as sickness of the mouth and nose. It caused the death of
a great number.</p>

<h2>PART III</h2>

<h3>A SPINNER OF SAND</h3>

<p><i>Human knowledge will be struck off the world's records before
we know all that is to be said about a gnat.</i><br>
&mdash;FABRE.</p>

<p>When the smoke of the belated steamer was a mere smudge in still
air far to the south-west, and there was naught to do but to wait
for tidings, good or bad, from the sick and discomforted
world&mdash;the din of which actually reaches these placid
scenes&mdash;was it not meet to study the sand, a field of intense
though noiseless industry, of edifying determination, of
competitive forces working undesignedly to a common purpose, of
exemplary utility?</p>

<p>In treacherous dimples the ferocious ant-lion, with mandibles
one-third the length of its body, lies in wait for its
prey&mdash;no king of the beasts more alert or more sudden or sure.
Let a wandering ant venture beyond the verge of the trap, and the
loose, fine sand slips under its tread; it slides to the bottom of
the pit; there is a heave of the sand, and the ant disappears. But
ants and their enemies are not the only intelligences in the raw
sand. If that plume of smoke the steamer wears but keeps its
distance, another and more primitive creature may make itself
known.</p>

<p>If you believe that Nature's restorative operations are
performed unceasingly, with never-failing design and often with the
exhibition of wonderful power, you may not be altogether astounded
at the antics of seemingly inanimate things. On this flat a year
ago was a thick sward of grass, perpetually mulched by millions of
needles from the beach oaks. The cyclone buried both the grass and
the mulching, so that the new surface was unprotected from shifting
winds. To encourage the growth of plant-life retentive of sand,
Nature employs certain advance agents, the successive office of
each of which is to create ever so meagre an amelioration of the
harsh conditions. Behold how one of these agents works.</p>

<p>Ordinarily the fallen needle&mdash;or branchlet&mdash;of a beach
oak (<i>Casuarina equisetifolia</i>) is absolutely passive. Like
the tree of the Bible, "In the place that it falleth there shall it
be." But here is one with its terminal spike of withered flowers
that moves, though lacking apparent impulse, with a succession of
jerks. It may be ten inches long, light of course, yet
unaccountably mysterious in its actions. The terminal plume lifts
and sways, as if some unfortunate creature were semaphoring signals
of distress. May these dry things live and brave the light of day
with frolicsome waverings?</p>

<p>Look at the other end, and for a moment the mystery deepens. It
is slowly settling upright in the sand. Was ever conjurer's trick
more entertaining! Take hold of the plume; you will find a weak
resistance to the strain you exert, and then the needle may be
withdrawn. Let it lie for a moment, and again it apparently becomes
invested with life. The plume lifts from the sand, wavers, and
begins to heave itself upright, the frequent pauses in the
operation proving that the task is a mighty one, demanding rests.
Carry investigations a trifle further, and you will discover a
sand-coloured grub, a trifle more robust of figure than the needle,
holding the end with mandibles backed by definite purpose. Not
one-tenth the length of the needle, the insect exerts almost
magical strength, and is, moreover, endowed with determination to
obey the dictates of Nature. Though apparently disliking exposure
to the sunlight, yet, should the needle be withdrawn from its grip,
the insect after an interval slowly and cautiously emerges, hastens
to it, drags it once more to the entrance of its shaft, and
withdraws, the waving plume registering each tug.</p>

<p>It is as if a six-foot man were to take hold of a flagstaff
about a third the circumference of his own body and ten times his
length, and retreat into the sand, dragging the staff with him.
There is a circumstance, however, in favour of the herculean grub.
Its shaft has been dug beforehand, though the entrance closes
automatically and is not discoverable on the surface; further, it
has a casing of web, reinforced with minute grains of sand. The
shaft may be traced down six and eight inches. When you look about,
you will find similar operations in progress by the dozen over
every square yard of the sandy area. Indeed, in some places the
casings of the shafts are so close together that there may be three
or four in the space of a square inch. Some occupants are working
on needles, or portions thereof, three and four inches long. The
higher-minded grubs, those that tend to improve the conditions of
the multitude, try to get ten-inch needles down eight-inch shafts,
and not only try but succeed; for do they not nibble away the
superfluous length, and as they nibble does not the plume tell of
gigantic concentration of effort, crowned with the flourish of
success? Thus do these sober-tinted, scarcely discernible grubs
check the mobility of sand and make loam upon which plants may feed
and be vigorous!</p>

<p>On the brief and hasty excursions of the insect above ground in
search of food in the bulk, the mouth of the shaft closes
automatically, as if controlled by a sphincter muscle. It seems
quite safe to conjecture that it lays an invisible thread of
gossamer thence as far as its quest lies, and that it is provided
with terminal appendages for the opening of the entrance; for, on
seizing the end of a needle, it retreats, with never a glance
behind, as briskly as it advanced and with unhesitating precision
to the spot whence it emerged. Tail first it descends; the mouth of
the shaft closes round the needle, which gradually disappears,
leaving not a trace.</p>

<p>By carefully clawing the sand a section of a shaft may be
exposed, the casing being so frail that it falls away on the
vertical face. The thrifty creature may have stored as many as
twelve pieces of its food, varying in length from a quarter of an
inch to an inch and a half. Here it is revealed, bolt upright, and
so preoccupied with its nibbling that it does not on the instant
seem to be aware of the disturbance of its quarters. When it does,
it slightly curves itself and becomes passive. The bottom of the
shaft is distended into a pocket by the weight of accumulated
pellets of excrement. In some cases the quantity is about half a
thimbleful. However alluring it may be to elaborate this point,
with Darwin's classic chronicles of the operations of earth-worms
in mind, any such attempt would savour of parody. It would appear
that the office of the tender caterpillar is that of a maker of
manure; and it may have to be more highly organized than an
earth-worm so as to perform its special duties in unpromising
circumstances. The loose, recently-driven sand, from which all
salinity can scarcely yet be leached, the dry, harsh needles, the
enormous appetite of the insect&mdash;such are the materials and
such the impulse with which Nature fulfils a magnificent
purpose.</p>

<p>Swift declared that whoever makes two ears of corn, or two
blades of grass, grow upon a spot of ground where only one grew
before does essential service to his country. The sand-caterpillar
and other living instruments of Nature that prepare hostile soil
for the first single blade of grass, are they not entitled, also,
to some sort of recognition?</p>

<p>To deal particularly with the spinner of sand, let it be said
that the few caterpillars sent in spirits to a Museum did not
reveal anything upon which to establish the identity of the perfect
insect. It therefore became necessary to study the history of the
insect throughout its transformations. First attempts to
domesticate the caterpillars were successful beyond expectations.
They were found to be tractable, or indifferent, under restraint,
content and healthful under novel conditions, and submissive to
frequent disturbances.</p>

<p>Disappointment having attended many attempts to discover the
sand-spinner in the pupal state, it was necessary to confine the
larvae and await developments. To this end a dozen were housed in a
capacious tin half filled with damp sand, well supplied with
casuarina needles strewn on the surface, and enclosed with wire
gauze.</p>

<p>The period of the larval stage was not definitely ascertained;
but it is safe to assume that it is limited to a month. In the
course of a fortnight four had passed into pupae, having converted
sections of their silk-lined shafts into cocoons. These were
transferred to a glass jar containing damp sand, over the mouth of
which linen was stretched and secured.</p>

<p>In its early stages the pupa fidgets on the slightest
disturbance; but presently becomes insensible to the lightest
touch. The chrysalis is three-eighths of an inch long and dark
brown in colour.</p>

<p>On the fourteenth day the perfect insect emerged&mdash;a plump
moth, silvery grey with pale brown smears, and apparently more
comfortable in the dark than in daylight. With nothing to commend
it in appearance, the moth is far less engaging than the active,
eager, ever-hungry caterpillar; but it displays one quality that
excites pity&mdash;almost furious resentment of the restraint upon
its liberty. With one exception, the moths emerged from the cocoon
during hours of darkness.</p>

<p>These specimens and observations were duly communicated to Dr.
A. Jefferis Turner, of Brisbane, and from him came an assurance of
new knowledge having been added to entomology.</p>

<p>Since it seemed possible to obtain more intimate knowledge of
the life-story of the humble little stranger which conceals its
doings in the sand, and under the veil of night, further efforts
were made. Two full-grown caterpillars being confined in a glass
jar half filled with sand and rationed with casuarina needles,
both, as fortune would have it, afforded opportunities for the
observation of their secretive ways. For two days each seemed to be
content to lie passive, just covered with sand. Then both excavated
shafts from the surface to the bottom of the jar, one following the
inner surface, and thereby exposing the full depth of the shaft. In
the making of the shaft the sand was displaced, not removed. the
side being compacted until it was firm and smooth.</p>

<p>Food was drawn to the bottom in about half inch lengths. The
insect emerged from the shaft, seized the end of a needle, backed
to the trap-door mouth, descended tail first, bit off a convenient
portion and drew it to the bottom; reascended, drew down a further
length, retired with another convenient piece, and so on, to eat
and repose.</p>

<p>Four days elapsed before the next process towards security and
comfort was undertaken&mdash;the silken lining of the shaft, a slow
work, apparently pursued with that economy of material in which
Nature often rejoices. On the sand-face the shaft in section was
delicately cased, but the glass side was not blurred with a single
thread.</p>

<p>In his first letter on the subject, after receiving specimens of
the moths, Dr. Jefferis Turner remarks that they represent a very
interesting discovery. "Not only is this a new observation, but the
moth is unknown to science, and its larval habits are most
unexpected in the group to which it belongs." He adds that it
belongs to a very large and cosmopolitan family and to the
sub-family of <i>Crambidae</i>, and that he thinks "it is one of
the large genus <i>Crambus</i>, though I will not commit myself to
this absolutely until I have made more detailed examination. The
species of <i>Crambus</i> are mostly grass-feeders, and I believe
none of them has habits anything like those you have discovered.
Perhaps we may name the species <i>Crambus ammonthes</i>&mdash;that
is to say, 'A Spinner of Sand.'"</p>

<p>Though the sand-spit is riddled with silk-lined shafts, each
caterpillar lives a solitary, independent existence. The whole
scheme may be said to represent an organized plan for the
conversion of a waste material into a fertilizer, with but little
loss, as it would seem, either in bulk or weight. So evident is its
singleness of purpose that each humble insect might be deemed to be
capable of realizing that its period of activity is far too brief
for slackness&mdash;that waste of time and opportunities is not to
be tolerated.</p>

<p>It is a beneficial work silently performed, and
unostentatiously, too, save for the flickering here and there of
the disappearing standards; performed, too, without fumbling or
blundering by creatures that most of us regard as composed of
little else than disagreeable "squash."</p>

<p>Under natural conditions, a blank exists in the life-story of
the insect. Though it is quite easy to obtain specimens of the
larvae during a period of six months of the year, and to get them
to pupate in confinement, so far not a single specimen of the pupae
has been found in the sand or elsewhere. Larvae are to be found in
all conditions of size and age, even to the state when they appear
to be on the verge of transformation, the grey tint of the body
changing to ivory yellow; but, though the pupae of other insects
are frequently noticed, this stage is at present a problem except
under artificial conditions.</p>

<h3>METALLIC STARLINGS</h3>

<p>Judging from the alacrity with which metallic starlings begin
building their nests on their advent in August of each year, and
the earnestness of family duties during their sojourn of seven
months, it is conceivable that but for the positive check of the
wet season they might maintain the vigorous fulfilment of these
duties the year round. Early and persistent rain sends them off
with evident reluctance. When a preliminary downpour has rendered
the nests uninhabitable, a fine interval has so far deluded them
that they have started to demolish and rebuild, only to be driven
away by the recurrence of inclement weather. Governed by its
incidence, they seem to detest the rain.</p>

<p>With rare exceptions, the starlings come to this island during
the first ten days of August. Seldom do they shriek and glitter in
forest and jungle after 20th March. In a typical year they appeared
on 5th August, whereas at a locality on the mainland, only seven
miles away, they were noticed a fortnight earlier. A colony which
had established itself, time out of mind, on a slim Moreton Bay
ash-tree (<i>Eucalyptus Tessellaris</i>) in the heart of the
forest, hatched out three, if not four, distinct broods during the
season, which lasted until 30th March following. Originally the
colony was sixty nests strong, and the first brood was hatched out
within twenty-six days, evidence of the fact being given by
portions of stained egg-shells on the ground beneath. In six weeks
the number had been increased by thirty. The second hatching took
place early in December; the third about the middle of January; and
there are indications of a fourth late in February. Rain during
January and February was not sufficient to annoy or embarrass the
birds.</p>

<p>On 30th December three nests were found beneath the overladen
tree. In each were three slightly incubated eggs. Each nest was
carpeted with fragments of fresh green leaves of Moreton Bay ash,
torn and nibbled at the edges. What office do the green leaves
perform? Possibly the pungency, agreeable to the human sense of
smell, may be obnoxious to the insects which fidget adults and
chicks&mdash;in which case the adults may wittingly provide, and,
in a degree, macerate, the leaves for the annoyance of the
lice.</p>

<p>On 4th February the colony numbered 125 nests, and on that date
two more overweighted branches came down. In several of the nests
were fledgelings, all save two of which were killed by the fall or
were worried to death by green ants. One of the survivors died
shortly after discovery of the disaster. The other&mdash;an
independent, self-assertive, ill-mannered imp&mdash;lived in and
about the house for a couple of months.</p>

<p>The adult metallic starling is remarkable for the colour and
lustre of its eyes, which are ruby-red and glitter gem-like. The
eyes of the castaway were deep brown in infancy. Not until a month
after it had become the most noisy, impatient, and impertinent
member of the household did the eyes begin to change; nor was the
reddish tint primarily permanent. In quiet moods the eyes were
washy-red. Excitement and anger deeply tinged them. In fact, the
tints of the iris varied with almost every pulsation, the emotions
of the excitable sprite being expressed in more or less richness of
red.</p>

<p>At the age of six weeks it was estimated that this small orphan
bird, in the care of interested mortals, consumed daily food
sufficient for a human infant. Its menu included oatmeal porridge
and milk, rice, mango, papaw, bread, cake, large white grubs,
caterpillars, mosquitoes bloated with human blood, March and other
flies, grasshoppers and samples of every other edible unprotected
from its raids. It would feast on the scrag end of a neck of a
decapitated fowl with as much apparent relish as on the skin of a
mango!</p>

<p>Having early in life acquired a taste for milk, it declined to
spoil its thirst with water; since, moreover, it was free and was
alert, quick and questioning, it made itself understood, and
generally got that which it wanted at the moment, if not with
goodwill then by force, persistency, or fraud. It took baths
regularly, being especially fond of the "blue" tub of the laundry,
on the edge of which it would perch, to duck and sprawl therein;
and there it would stand to be well soused, screaming with
glee.</p>

<p>Young birds from the same colony were wont to visit chilli
bushes in the garden, but with them the pet did not, for several
weeks, make friends. It soon learned to take chillies, though the
first knowledge of that diverting fruit was disastrous. Instead of
being swallowed whole, it was broken up and deliberately tasted,
and with a shriek of dismay and flooded eyes, sparkling like
embers, it flew to the kitchen, imploring the consolation of milk.
Ever after, chillies were bolted.</p>

<p>Occasionally the orphan would camp on a mango-tree; but its
accustomed bed was in a small basket under cover, the lid of which
was kept open to the extent of half an inch by a chip of wood at
one corner. At dusk the bird would dash across the kitchen, to
disappear beneath the lid like a jack-in-the-box, and if, an
instant later, the lid was lifted, the intruder would be warned off
with an admonitory hiss.</p>

<p>In no sense affectionate or lovable, its departure was at least
consistent with its character. From a convenient mango-tree it
darted on to the edge of a dish being borne to the fowl-yard,
tasted of its quality, and danced on to the shoulder of its
mistress, just as a flock of its own race dashed past. With a
shriek it followed&mdash;never to return.</p>

<p>The history of the little bird was instructive, affording
information as to the variety and quantity of food it consumed.
Perpetual hunger was a marked condition, and the digestive
processes, being very imperfect, demonstrated the value of such an
agent in the distribution of seeds. Millions of seeds with
unaffected germination must be transported hither and thither by
various colonies of starlings every season, to the advantage of the
vegetable kingdom.</p>

<p>A contributor to an English review is inclined to wonder whether
the starlings of the Old Country "do not possess some strange
occult sense of organization which in the long process of evolution
may carry them higher and higher in the scale of creation." That
Australia's native starlings do benefit by the laws of community
there can be little doubt; but their socialistic habits appear to
invite the raids of snakes and hawks. It is not uncommon to find a
grey goshawk in possession of the tree in which a colony is
established, and all the adult birds crowded on another close by,
whence they timidly watch the enemy. The hawk does not appear to
have wit enough to raid the domed nests; but it awaits a chance of
dashing among the alert birds that have exercised themselves in
manoeuvres of evasion.</p>

<p>Late each season the flocks assemble for the performance of
these tactics, in which they act as though the separate entities
had but a single brain. Not only in times of peace, but in the
presence of a baffled and exasperated enemy, they cleave the air in
acute angles with almost instantaneous changes of direction,
shrieking in unison.</p>

<p>The assurance with which snakes raid the nests was illustrated a
few years ago, when notes were being taken of the habits of the
birds. Goshawks had harried the colony so frequently that visits
were made at intervals with the gun, and on one occasion, while I
was waiting for a shot, a big black snake shuffled slowly towards
the trunk of the tree. By its demeanour its very thoughts might
have been read. Cruel, crafty, arrogant, it seemed to assert its
dominion over other beasts of the field and the fowl of the air;
nor did it turn aside though passing within a foot of the watcher.
It wriggled its own length up the smooth trunk&mdash;and fell back
headless on the report of the gun.</p>

<h3>THE SUNBIRD</h3>

<p>Sired by a sunbeam, born of a flower, gaiety its badge, might be
said in fable of the sunbird, as in temperament and tint it parades
its right to such parentage. Sprightly, sudden in many shifts, not
disposed to be over-trustful&mdash;yet for its diminutiveness, gay
colours, habits and inconsequence it is likeable if not lovable, a
gem to be thankful for and to admire. An ornament in the garden, a
shy, fragile habitant of the bush, artificial rather than a work of
unassisted nature, it seems to understand its frailty and to take,
perhaps, unnecessary precautions against the assaults of enemies,
especially during the nesting-season.</p>

<p>Occasionally the nest is built under the verandah. A pair,
bolder than the others, selected the boatshed, where both building
and incubation were subject to many interruptions and yet
successfully concluded. Generally independence is preferred, and in
forest or on the fringe of the jungle or on a branch overhanging
the beach the nest will be found; and always it is so artfully
draped as rarely to be detected, apart from the presence of the
builders. An example may be described.</p>

<p>As it passes from maturity to decay the spathe of the commonest
of the pandanus palms becomes brown and mildewed, and, caught by
the prickle-edged leaves in tufts and shreds, the flowers may hang
loosely in the air. One such dangling plume became a source of
trivial annoyance, for it was suspended over a frequently traversed
path just high enough to flap the face of the heedless passerby.
Other leaves of the palm were similarly decorated all showing the
processes of change and decay more or less conspicuously. In course
of time that which had occasioned many an unconscious swerve
littered the path, still clinging to the sword-shaped leaf, and in
the midst was an unsuspected nest in which a brood had been
reared.</p>

<p>Different in its concealment was a nest woven on the frayed end
of a strip of bark still attached to the trunk of a massive
tea-tree. Threads of the bark were interwoven with the body of the
nest, and a graduated strand was the customary pendant. But for a
chance visit from the male bird, with his yellow chest and blue
bib, the gently swaying nest would never have been noticed.</p>

<p>Do such birds consciously conceal their nests? Are not their
only enemies snakes, which depend on the sense of smell, not of
sight, and are accordingly not subject to illusions which the
elaborate deceptions seem designed to create? As far as outside
show goes, the completed nest is a tattered, tapering remnant of
inanimate nature, with an entrance so secret and downcast that the
parent bird seems to enter from below, while within it is cosy and
softly lined, befitting the occupation of chicks with an inborn
leaning towards comfort and safety.</p>

<p>Though the nest may have no delusive effect on a marauding
snake, its lightness, insecure situation, and the obscurity of the
entrance may in combination afford a fair measure of protection.
So, with or without design, the frivolous sunbird outwits the
reptile which was wont to be emblematic of subtlety and craft.</p>

<p>Nests under the surveillance of human beings are simpler
exteriorly than those of the bush, no trouble being taken to adjust
them in appearance to their surroundings; and not a single local
instance can be cited of an attempt to blur such nests other than
by a trivial tail-piece. Those who scoff at the suggestion that
birds are capable of apprehending the object to be accomplished may
be able to explain why the sunbirds do not blindly obey the laws of
instinct and efface nests under artificial cover with oddments,
making them as usual, things of shreds and patches. Whether they
were aware of the needlessness of concealment, or whether in the
lack of suitable material they abandoned the habit, are questions
for others to discuss. Here is one who, like Rosa Dartle, "wants to
be put right, if wrong" in believing that birds and other creatures
of less mental equipment than ourselves have, at least, the faculty
of varying the habitual performance of an intelligent action in
accordance with necessities and circumstances.</p>

<p>The shrill, small voice of the sunbird is almost
indistinguishable from the stridulation of one of the leaf insects,
which makes its amorous noises in the evening as well as during the
sunny hours. Frequently both sounds are heard in confusing blend.
Many times have the red hibiscus bushes been searched for the
fitful, flittering sunbird in vain, while the red-eyed insect which
hides under the mimicry of a pair of green leaves has proclaimed
its passion with impatient fervour.</p>

<p>The insects were plentiful, but the birds had been rare during a
considerable interval, the cyclone of March, 1918, having destroyed
so many that for a time it was feared they must be counted among
the losses due to one devastating night. During this year (1921)
the birds have shown signs of recovering the lost ground, so far as
numbers are concerned. A family of six on the crown of an
umbrella-tree gave welcome proof of increase; and, though without
appeal to the sensual ear, were not the hasty twitters of the
sprites sounds of triumph over the storm which, having ravaged
beaches, scarred hills, maimed every food-providing plant and
driven strong-winged birds across the sea, had merely checked for a
season the well-being of the weak?</p>

<p>Science does not recognize distinct association between the
sunbird and the humming-bird of America, yet in habits and in
certain poses resemblance may be traced. Both live on minute
flower-frequenting insects, and refresh themselves with nectar.
Both poise over the flowers they visit, though the accomplishments
of the sunbird in the feat are less assured, less frequently
displayed, and of less duration than those of the "miniature
miracle of nature which delights to revel among the honeysuckle
bowers." The ancient Mexicans believed that the humming-bird
suspended its animation and its body during the cold season of the
year; that it drove its long bill into the bark of a tree and thus
spent the rigorous winter, waking at the coming of spring, to feast
on spiders and quaff honey. True to their familiar name, our
sunbirds are silent during the rains of the wet season; but on the
first gleam of sunshine they bustle among the flowers, performing
pretty feats of agility and joining in a musical competition with
their neighbours of the leaf.</p>

<p>Boldly located, but so shaded that it blends with the scene, the
nest of the North Queensland sunbird is artless compared with those
of two relatives native to North Borneo, in which concealment is
exemplified on altogether different principles. Three singular
nests are referred to in <i>A Naturalist in Borneo</i>, by the late
Robert W. C. Shelford. A brief quotation may be pardoned on the
plea of the value of comparisions. One is described as a
hemispherical cup of interwoven fibres covered with skeleton
leaves, slung by silken threads to the under surface of a large
leaf. The suspensory threads (obtained from spiders' webs) "are
passed through holes made in the leaf by the bird's bill, and the
ends are twisted up into knots to prevent slipping." This one is
said to be not only fairly secure from observation but well
protected from snakes. Another, composed of skeleton leaves and
fibres and bast, is placed between two growing leaves pegged
together with bits of stick. A third bears some resemblance of that
of the North Queensland species, being a pear-shaped structure of
bark fibres and cocoons of silk-weaving caterpillars, with entrance
at the side under an overhanging eave. It dangles from the end of a
bough.</p>

<p>In the selection of sites for nests, in style, material and
manipulation, sunbirds must be credited with exceptional skill.
These are external matters from which each species benefits in
accordance with its lights. In proof of regard for general
welfare&mdash;for the preservation of the type&mdash;it may be
pointed out that they adhere to one principle. Though the breasts
of males are vivid, the backs of all conform to the tints of
vegetation, so that during moments of stillness the gift of
invisibility is theirs. They do homage to the sun, glory in its
patronage, mimic its rays as they gleam and flicker among
reflecting leaves, and while at rest simulate shadowed ones.</p>

<p>But what is this? One of the sweet creatures, discovering a tiny
spider lurking in a corner of the window, flutters against the
incomprehensible glass, taps it with pointed bill, and, baffled,
flits off, tittering with vexation. Better its company in the
sunshine than these shady studies of its architectural skill.</p>

<h3>THE SWAMP PHEASANT</h3>

<p><i>Strange ministrant of undescribed sounds.</i><br>
&mdash;KEATS.</p>

<p>Australian, truly; but, unlike the emu, the black swan, the
lyre-bird, the kookaburra, and others, the swamp pheasant is not
exclusively so. Familiarly known as a pheasant, and having one
feature at least in common with the family, it makes no claim to
direct relationship. Science seems somewhat bewildered by its
contrarieties; it is placed among the cuckoos, its formal title
being <i>Centropus phasianinus</i>&mdash;pheasant-like
spur-foot&mdash;while the approved vernacular name is a
combination, pheasant-coucal.</p>

<p>In common with most birds, the swamp pheasant has its
exclamatory season. During the cool months it seldom breaks the
silence; when the leaves of the purple-fruited terminalias begin to
redden and fall, when the native nutmegs are soft, furry and brown,
and before the calophyllums blossom, the pheasants, responding to
the universal thrill, assume their status as the loudest (save the
harsh-voiced channel-billed cuckoos) and most persistent singers of
the forest Perhaps the term "singer," applied to sweet-voiced birds
generally, should not be associated with one of such original and
powerful style. Mellow and fluent though they be, the utterances
are not indicative of gladsomeness nor of a sprightly disposition;
nor are they songs.</p>

<p>Melodious recitatives rather than harmonic themes, such as are
sung by some honey-eaters or by metallic starlings in their rare
intervals of restfulness and communication, the fluencies of this
lover of the moist earth seem to typify favourite resorts&mdash;to
be earthly, not aerial; assertions of the joys of this world rather
than compliments to the skies. And when bird follows bird in
varying keys in the transmission of its sentiments, until the voice
in the distance sounds like a far-away bell, the listener will, if
in harmony, give thanks for a psalm that proclaims happiness, peace
and lively hope.</p>

<p>Has any poet attempted to rhyme its moods and music, any artist
shown it save as a staid creature incapable of frolic and destitute
of fun? Ideally at home on the peaty margins of pandanus swamps,
revelling in seclusion, rejoicing triumphantly in otherwise silent
places, a lover of sunshine as well as of cool shades, the long,
dusky bird, when accustomed to the presence and the ways of man,
surely reveals its gift of humour; else why those pranks, swinging
its tail, ducking its head, ruffling itself to twice its natural
bulk while chortling impertinences? Why, otherwise, does it squat
on the frond of a coco-nut palm, spread out like a remnant of
frayed bark, and, peering down, parody the terrier below?</p>

<p>The mimicry of the lyre-bird, the tinkle of the bell-bird, the
songs of the lark, the warblings of the magpies, the strangulated
paean of the butcher-bird, the melodies of the thrush, the hearty
glee of some honey-eaters, the call of the whip-bird&mdash;all
these find rendering in verse; but the swamp pheasant's melodies,
the richest, the purest, the loudest of all, have they been
immortalized? The bird's most prosperous sphere, the warm, moist
coast, has yet to produce its poet, and southern versifiers may
have ignored it for the reason that few have had the privilege of
listening to it&mdash;also, perhaps, because it is not quite at
home anywhere save in the tropics, and does not give of its best
where least at ease.</p>

<p>This earthly psalmist of rare felicity in the expression of its
emotions seems proud of its gifts and fond of exercising them.
Harken now to the succession of full-sounding, slow, booming notes,
accentuated by balanced rests, as if the vocalist were conscious of
a flawless performance and studied it with the air of a libant,
pausing between sips of the exquisite. Listen again to the quick,
crisp, trippingly airy outbursts of merriment. Are they
improvisations of a thoughtless moment, tossed into space? And how
delicately do a pair in concord harmonize as, perched on a dead
limb, they make musical a square mile of attentive forest!</p>

<p>What is richer, more inspiring to serene and lofty thought, more
soothing, less worldly than the bubbling chant heard on a September
midnight, when the winds are still? Wakened from innocent and happy
dreams, the bird seems to assure its fellows that all is
well&mdash;not boisterously or in loud and authoritative terms, but
in tones bespeaking sympathy and love. It might be repeating that
chiming phrase</p>

<p>He, watching over Israel,<br>
Slumbers not nor sleeps.</p>

<p>A few seconds of thrilling silence, and another organ-voiced
dreamer of all that is consoling takes up the theme, in the same
subdued, hushing, almost apprehensive cadence. It is the warranty
of mutual confidence and hope, blended with supplication for
preservation from the perils of the night. A distant sleeper
responds cautiously, each note distinct and mellow; and so the
sound is borne away until lost in musical throbs, and the whole
Isle has heard the pheasants reassuring each other against the
powers of darkness.</p>

<p>Grand in their solemnity and comfort, the night notes are in
sharp contrast with the varied exclamations and happy calls of the
day. Surely there are but few birds gifted with such a range of
vocabulary. Its undertones, its purlings of satisfaction,
confidences to its mate, harsh protests against the presence of an
enemy, sneers at those of whom it has no fear, joyful performance
of its scales in unison with a lighter-voiced companion, defiant
hoots, each and all explicit and characteristic, provide
never-ceasing entertainment.</p>

<p>Among the many Australian songsters is there one more
accomplished, one that more eloquently extols the sweetness of
freedom, that croons to itself so like a flute in tone with a
zephyr, that scolds a hawk in the sky or a snake in the grass with
such fervour and decision, or unconsciously repeats the echoes from
a belfry in elf-land?</p>

<p>Besides being a chanter of the pleasures of life in the fervent
regions, the good bird is a gallant defender of its home, an
attentive spouse, an industrious provider, a bully, a bombastic
sort of knave, a fighter for its rights; no tremulous socialist too
weak to whisper, but a hearty individualist making the best of
opportunities, with a good and playful word for everyone, no fear
of anyone and some sort of greeting for all.</p>

<p>Careless, happy-go-lucky, unreflective as it may seem, surely in
obedience to the first law of Nature the swamp pheasant displays
high intelligence. Generally the rough, loosely-built nest is
hidden in tall, blady grass a foot or so above the ground, the
grass stems being bent to meet above it in the form of an arch.
Occasionally the site is a low bush, and the grass structure is
then interwoven with twigs and faded leaves. Wherever situated, it
looks like a crude basket with a disproportionate and impracticable
handle; but its design does the builder credit. While the arch
covers the back, neck and head of the brooding bird, the tail
extends beyond, and the greys and browns of the upper feathers
blend with the neutral tints of the withered vegetation, so that
concealment is complete. When the bird is absent, the arch screens
the conspicuous white eggs, and, in due course hides ugly, black,
almost repulsive-looking chicks, each sparsely clad with long,
white, hairlike feathers.</p>

<p>The eggs of most ground birds are, of course, tinted in
accordance with the environment of the nest. White eggs demand
protection, hence the artfulness of the swamp pheasant. Can there
be any doubt that the scheme of disguise is the result of conscious
purpose, and accordingly different from the primal gift of green
backs to gorgeous-breasted fruit-pigeons, birds destitute of
outstanding characteristics and pitifully crude in
nest-building?</p>

<p>An authority on protective coloration says that, in consequence
of all wild creatures being lighted from above, a gradation of
shades from dark on the upper side to light on the lower is the one
great principle running through organic life, and is "exactly what
is needed to render solid objects inconspicuous under descending
light." Aberrant in other respects, the swamp pheasant disobeys
this law, and justifies its disobedience by inconspicuousness. In a
notable habit the bird does seem conscious of the wisdom of
nullifying its appearance. Settling in an exposed position, such as
the top of a stump, the tail is drooped and slightly expanded, and
the wings held loosely and languidly, the effect being that the
black underparts are more or less effectively screened by brown and
neutral tints, so that the bird becomes, though not invisible, an
unattractive item, a blank in the scene not at all likely to arrest
the eye. It is not to be assumed that the listless, helpless
attitude is designed to lure an intruder from the nest, for it is
practised at all seasons.</p>

<p>Except the universal foe&mdash;snakes&mdash;the swamp pheasant
has few, if any enemies. Why then the need of caution during
sunlight, which snakes do not court? There are grounds for the
belief that the bird, confident of general security, braves
possible foes, for as often as not on becoming a blur it repeats a
singularly harsh cry, to the accompaniment of a trick of the body
that flouts the theory of self-protection. At each jeering
exclamation the tail, spread like an open fan, jerks over the back,
and the head ducks, note and action combining in bombastic
self-advertisement.</p>

<p>However vain speculations on the reflective powers of birds in
general may be, the swamp pheasant, possessing original
qualifications as well as oddities, may be studied as a superior to
"lesser breeds without the law;" and if it has also the virtue of
being able to enjoy its own antics, then grant it all possible
goodwill, and interpret its actions in flattering terms.</p>

<p>Few wild birds are less skilled on the wing. Speed and grace in
the air were not considered when its form was in the making; since
most of its living is earned on or close to the ground, little more
than the rudiments of flight have been acquired. Although able to
rise from the ground, its angle of ascent is low, its speed slow
and anxious, if the bird be under the influence of excitement.</p>

<p>Alighting on the branch of a tree it generally loses balance,
almost toppling over; the long, loose-jointed tail then comes into
action as a counterpoise. Having secured foothold, it jumps and
scrambles higher and higher, more like a timid cat than a winged
creature, and from due elevation labours to another and loftier
tree. Even the great gift of effortless descent to Mother Earth is
not exercised with boldness or skill, being undertaken as a
thrilling, adventuresome feat not wholly free from risk; and the
landing is often both awkward and ungraceful.</p>

<p>Neither truly of the ground nor of the trees, the realm of this
exceptional bird is among the shrubs and tall grass, where insects
are abundant and cover convenient. However entangled the
undergrowth, it moves with ease and considerable speed, with
shuffling, almost reptilian wriggle, secreting itself suddenly and
cunningly, and bursting into flustering flight to avert capture by
hand.</p>

<p>On this Isle, where birds are on terms of equality and are
encouraged to exercise their rights, the swamp pheasant has become
a familiar. Does it realize that it may be impudent and scoffing
without forfeiting goodwill? With an air of defiance and bravado it
may sweep along the path to the beach, chuckling and sneering, head
tucked between hunched shoulders, or retreat into the maze of blady
grass, side-glancing invitations to a game of hide and seek in
which it is bound to win. And when, on occasion, one with more than
common effrontery sits on the gate-post as you pass through, is it
not polite to make obeisance, since it represents the community
which had charter of the Isle ages before the intruder made free of
it?</p>

<p>To such a friend you may bow with genuine respect. It has
flattered you with trustfulness; has killed off innumerable
plant-destroying insects; has saluted your ears day and night for
the best part of the year; has exasperated you by the persistent
din of a far-sounding plaint; has taught you that a bird of clumsy
and laggard flight may be the embodiment of good-humour. With organ
voice it has gloated over the joys of the moment, and its intoned
monody on passing woes</p>

<p>Sounds ever as a sullen bell<br>
Remembered knolling a departing friend.</p>

<p>More than a mere bird, it has come to be loved as the good
genius of the Isle, for it typifies many of its features besides
its liberties, humid shades and babble of running water.</p>

<h3>SWIFTS AND SWIFTLETS</h3>

<p>Early on the morning of Sunday, 16th January 1921, for&mdash;as
far as observation goes&mdash;the second time during close on a
quarter of a century, a flock of swifts passed over Dunk
Island.</p>

<p>The species was not definitely ascertained; but it may have been
the spine-tailed, the conspicuous feature of the "white-rumped" not
attracting notice. Some flew so high as scarcely to be visible,
while others hawked, close to the bosom of Mother Earth, in company
with the ever-present swiftlet, in pursuit of termites then issuing
from their dark, moist quarters with agitated haste. For over four
hours the birds partook of the hospitality of the Isle, but when a
gentle north-east breeze sprang up the call of the South became
irresistible; still wheeling lingeringly, they responded, the only
motes in the transparent blueness of the sky.</p>

<p>Whensoever during daylight flying termites emerge from the soil,
they are subject to many perils. Lizards and ants seize them at
their very doors, the former gobbling on the spot, the latter
carrying them off. Among the birds none seems to appreciate the
trifles as keenly as the swiftlets, which become, in so far as such
mild and gentle creatures may, bold and fierce in their raids.
Though showing no fear of human beings, even when the home cave is
visited, swiftlets cannot be considered among the familiars of man.
A bird that rarely rests during daylight, except when brooding, and
is as free as the air, neither fears nor favours its admirers; but
when the wings of ants and termites glitter in the light of the
newly-risen sun they disdain the presence of onlookers.</p>

<p>Shall we stand for a while to watch the varied behaviour of
banqueting birds this steamy morning, when the passing of the wet
season is denoted by the mingling of the fragrance of the last
blossoms of the tea-trees with the sweetness of the first of the
wattles?</p>

<p>Wood-swallows swoop down on the swarms, cut through them time
and again with quick alternations of soaring and fluttering, and
resume their perch on the maimed bloodwood tree, there to vaunt
tense white vests. Always prim and clean, always loving kinship,
there they sit as close together as peas in a pod, and when one
darts out for another mouthful, its relations, complacently
twittering, shuffle away the empty space.</p>

<p>Confident in every movement, beautiful in every aspect, the
rainbow-birds (<i>Merops</i>) circle with sunlit wings among the
small fry in the unruffled style of the adept; but bees and other
prey of like size must be borne to a convenient roost, there to be
battered and swallowed gluttonously, with effort and exertion.
Though the birds journey in companies in open order, meals are
taken independently, each selecting a convenient resting-place and
enjoying its pleasure somewhat sadly.</p>

<p>Clinking and clattering, the spangled drongo, solitary when
family duties are over, scuffles among the crowd in brief raids,
fidgeting and fussing meanwhile, an impatient spectator of more
accomplished fliers, though an alarmist, a scoffer and a bully if a
hawk intrudes.</p>

<p>Meek of voice as well as of demeanour, the leaden fly-catcher
takes toll from the insects that drift nearest its lowly perch,
where, apparently far away in spirit from any sort of adventure, it
twists and turns in agitated expectation.</p>

<p>The rhythmic evolutions of the bolder of the feasters&mdash;a
bewildering succession of curves and undulations&mdash;might be an
unstudied ballet; or they might represent a throng of fairies
weaving, with gossamer imperceptible to mortals, a complicated
design on the blueness of the sky and the greenness of the foliage.
For all the fervency and haste, no jostlings or conflict of claims
to the best share of a profuse gift disturbs the harmony of the
pattern.</p>

<p>On foot a hopeless cripple, on wing the picture of ease and
grace, the swiftlet wheels in circles of varying radii, interrupted
by turns of excelling certainty. Audaciously fearless, it often
passes silently within arm's reach; when on the instant it swerves
within a few inches of your head, then and only then a wisp of
sound may be heard.</p>

<p>Splendid are the gifts bestowed upon the little bird in
compensation for degenerate legs, which, to vary Shakespeare's
phrase, nothing can but cling&mdash;eager, defiant, persistent
flight, as swift almost as light, as silent as dawn, and sight
marvellous in acuteness and adaptability. At one moment it flies as
effortless as the drift of wind-blown thistledown, the next as
unwaveringly as an arrow. Does it not often race the fast-fleeting
light? In company with semi-blind bats it scours the dusk, taking
toll of insects that sport boldly in the dark, and in an instant
shoots over the hill and down through the gloomy jungle to its
quarters, there to thread its way along crevices a hand's breadth
wide, and to alight without hesitation at the edge of its nest
among hundreds of others on the roof of an obscure dormitory.</p>

<p>Swiftlets' nests are unique among those of Australian birds.
Restricted by reason of aerial life in the choice of material, the
bird makes a framework of vegetable substances consolidated with
saliva. In one cave all the birds had used as a base a grey-green
moss, which hangs from trees in specially damp situations and can
be seized during flight. Another and considerably larger colony
favoured what appeared to be the stems of a thin, wiry grass, and
on the only occasion on which they were caught in the act of
nest-building all were filching dried "needles" from beach oaks
(<i>Casuarina equisetifolia</i>), picking and choosing without
slackening speed, each carrying off a single strand.</p>

<p>On a dull day the single white egg seems to glow as if it were
slightly phosphorescent; perhaps that effect is produced by a
slight reflection from the grey gelatine which forms a considerable
part of the nest.</p>

<p>Delicately formed, sober in tint, with a fluff of grey at the
base of the tail, short of beak and woefully lacking in leg, the
swiftlet is well proportioned and planned for its part in the
scheme of Nature; this is to keep in check certain winged insects
of destructive character, that otherwise might make the life of man
miserable and defeat his efforts to become a habitant of lonely
places. What quantity does a single colony dispose of between dawn
and dusk? When the local supply runs short, the daily range for
forage must be considerable; but what is distance to a creature
whose speed may be safely estimated at over a mile a minute? The
rivers of the mainland, the mangrove swamps, the lily lagoons are
pleasant and profitable resorts, and the open spaces miles further
inland are available at the cost of a trifle of time. It is safe to
assume, too, that a bird of such high power must exhaust its vital
force rapidly, and that there must be constant renewal. Two or
three colonies represent, therefore, free agencies operating for
the benefit of man to an extent and worth beyond estimation.</p>

<p>When the homing birds appear at dusk there is no slackening of
wing. They have flown and feasted, probably without cessation, all
the hours of light, and now for rest. Daylight abroad is not for
chatter either; but do they ever shuffle each into a tiny nest or
cling beside a brooding mate, without greeting associates with a
gritty sort of twitter?&mdash;just the sort of sound appropriate to
a home in the hollow heart of a granite boulder, bewilderingly dim
on the brightest noon.</p>

<p>Deprived as it is of the impulse of legs, how does a frail,
light bird, submissive to all the functions of life on the wing,
rest and incubation excepted, rise from a flat surface on the rare
occasions when it alights? Fly-like, it clings to the slanting roof
of its home, thence drops, and is away. That is easy enough. But it
has been seen to rise from unlittered, level sand, and the feat is
performed so quickly that the effect is as if it were tossed upward
by a force foreign to itself. No doubt the instantaneous impact of
both wings against the sand gives the initial impetus. Scores
brooding breast deep, and one after another popping into the air,
present a sight that few have had the privilege of witnessing, and
for that reason a recital of some of the features of the scene in
which the feat is performed may be acceptable.</p>

<p>A few miles from its mouth one of the rivers of the mainland is
constricted by an encroachment of sand which has edged its course
against the opposing side; there a high, muddy bank, reinforced by
the matted roots of water-loving plants and trees, resists erosion.
The swirling stream runs in a sharp curve round the tail of a bank
whereon crocodiles drowse in the sun. If they themselves do not
happen to be apparent, the furrows of hasty launchings are there as
evidence of the presence of ill things in these lovely waters.
There, too, on the sand squat swiftlets, easy of conscience and not
to be flustered by a passing boat. With a flicker, as each wills
and wishes, it is on the wing, to gorge in the teeming air. You
listen for the sound which should accompany so explosive a
movement, and catch merely the melodious calls, the whimpers and
twittering of birds of but trumpery skill in flight; and you wonder
which gets the best out of life&mdash;the pampered dwellers in the
paradise of slim-shanked palms, where swamps and sludge belch
clouds of delicious insects, or the adventurous wanderers that set
distance at naught, that are silent, that share with crocodiles the
comfort of warm sand and rejoice in the liberties of the upper air
with eagles!</p>

<p>Since the swiftlet is among those birds of Australia whose
habits and manners have not yet been studied closely, it is
incumbent on the part of an individual who has opportunities for
observation denied to expert ornithologists, to record trivial and
homely facts illustrative of its life-history, as well as its
conspicuous qualities. In this consideration a cloistered virtue
ought not to be ignored.</p>

<p>From early infancy the chicks observe the most primitive of
sanitary laws, being at pains to avoid the fouling of their own
nests. Though it would, perhaps, be absurd to suggest that they may
be endowed with a special sense of delicacy because of the singular
fabrication of the nests, it may not be beyond reason to assume
that the offspring of creatures that delight in the cleanly air may
manifest instinctive dislike to dirt and discomfort.</p>

<p>Of what are known as "true swifts," four are attributed to
Australia. Two of them breed in Siberia and Japan, and travel as
far south as Tasmania; another, the builder of the edible nest, is
said to be an occasional visitor to the extreme North of our
country. The swiftlet, herein referred to, is the only one of the
family known to breed here; moreover, its breeding-places are
confined to the coastal tracts of the North. It is the duty, and
should be the pleasure, of North Queenslanders to see that so
useful and distinct a bird for ever escapes the penalties of
rarity.</p>

<hr>

<h3>CHARACTER IN BIRDS</h3>

<p>Wild birds play, and in their pastimes show all their beauty and
gracefulness to advantage; the airs often assumed in their ecstasy
are evidence almost of pride in the effect that their antics and
feats produce on the mind of the beholder. In many parts of the
coastal tract of North Queensland a singularly important little
bird&mdash;a member of the crow family&mdash;is fairly plentiful.
To him I would appeal as witness in support of the opinion that
birds gloat over their superiority to man in respect of flight.</p>

<p>The spangled drongo is black, but not so black that a shade of
greenish purple is absent from his shoulders. He has a decidedly
crowish head and bill, brownish-red eyes, and a long, fish-like,
forked tail, which he has the habit of twitching or flicking to
emphasize the meek, clinking tones of his staid and sober moments.
Though a bird of the forest, the drongo chooses resorts adjacent to
the jungle, and, (in my experience) invariably selects the Moreton
Bay ash for nesting. Among the thin, grey-green leaves, far towards
the end of a branch, the nest is fairly safe, though conspicuous.
But if the nest were not easily seen, the drongo is not of a
disposition to allow anyone to pass without noticing his demure
spouse, whose long tail sticks out with matronly pride over the
edge of the nest of twigs in defiance of all conventions. He
"cheeps" and she answers, for she is just as fussy over the
business as he is vain. Most birds are secretive in respect of the
serious occupation of their lives. The drongo and his consort make
as much of it as possible, advertising it far and wide, and they
follow and feed their young, making much noise, long after the nest
has been deserted.</p>

<p>In many ways and attributes the drongo is a character.
Conspicuous, noisy, self-assertive, fussy, and inconsequent, it
might be thought that his duties in the harmony of nature were of
little concern to others. But, as a fact, he is so useful and so
brave that the lives of many others would be attended with greater
risks and be less comfortable and happy if his species were
exterminated. Many other birds he bullies most impudently, for he
has a voice "like Mars, to threaten and command;" but his office is
peaceful; for he is head of the detective department. He owns no
deputy. He glories in his work, which he performs with the utmost
vigilance. The chief enemy of other birds&mdash;domestic as well as
wild&mdash;in this locality is the grey falcon. Whensoever the
falcon comes, the drongo makes proclamation and follows him, using
language calculated to provoke a breach of the peace. Domestic
fowls understand enough of the drongo's dialect to take up the
alarm when he sounds it, and my dogs, well acquainted with the
language of the fowls, fuss in response, so that I am almost
instantly informed of the presence of the falcon. Of the
ruddy-backed sea-eagle, and of the osprey, neither the drongo nor
the much-petted fowls take the slightest notice; but a falcon
cannot escape detection, and, when three or four drongos make
common cause against him, flies away with a sulky air, followed by
volleys of such wrathful, feather-ruffling language that two or
three days may elapse ere the black detective has another case on
his hands.</p>

<p>Shrewd and observant as is the drongo, he does not devote all
his leisure moments to the office he so well fills. When he takes
his pleasure, he throws his whole soul into it. His delight is
triumphant, his ecstasy transcendent. Yet one is inclined to the
belief that he "shows off," conscious of the admiration that is his
due. Since few of the antics of wild creatures so vividly express
frenzied joy and gladness in life, such utter abandonment to the
blissful passion of the moment, an attempt to describe an aerial
feat performed almost daily for my special edification cannot be
foregone.</p>

<p>All birds save the bloodthirsty, sneaking falcon are privileged,
but none understands the rights he enjoys as acutely as the drongo,
and none takes such liberties. So when my ears are assailed by a
hopelessly discordant jangle, I know that my friend the drongo is
ringing his bell as a preliminary advertisement to his superb act.
As he jangles, "out of tune and harsh," he impels himself with all
his might up into the air almost perpendicularly. At the extreme
limit of flight his utterances change, and with stiffened wings,
distended to the utmost vertically over his back, he casts himself
headlong towards the ground, to the accompaniment of a torrent of
twittering, too sharp and rapid and violent for distinct
enunciation.</p>

<p>Has the wilful bird gone mad that he should deliriously dash
himself to death?</p>

<p>Can he possibly check himself?</p>

<p>Just as one feels constrained to rouse him to a sense of the
danger from his giddy feat by a sharp exclamation, the drongo
spreads his wings, and, with an impudent whistle, flies off to a
tree, to "chink" and "clink" as he flirts his tail with
self-satisfaction over the neat performance of an exciting and
incomparable trick.</p>

<p>In the evening, at this season, the drongo makes himself quite
at home. In the soil, in the cleared space about the house, are
thousands of ivory-white grubs which, when they develop into chubby
brown beetles, are regarded as dainties by birds. But the beetles,
realizing in a dim, earth-encumbered, lumbering style that it is
fatal to emerge either in broad daylight, when many enemies are
about, or when night has fallen and the wailing stone curlew and
the sedate mopoke and the noisy "chop chop" (nightjar) are
prowling, choose the few minutes of dusk for their exit from the
moist soil. Then the drongo comes, and, apologizing for his
intrusion with a few meek "cheeps," makes the best use of his time.
Sport being exciting and the game delicious, he swoops and darts
until he is bewildered by the darkness. How intensely human is the
drongo! In his distress he sets up a loud and appealing "jangle;"
this plaint is immediately answered by his home-keeping consort;
off he flutters, guided by her continuous calls, and the
upbraidings and the explanations and consolations continue for
fully five minutes.</p>

<p>A few cute old domestic hens, taught by the drongo, wait up
after the others have gone to roost and hunt the booming beetles in
terrible earnest&mdash;but they sneak off to their perches without
exciting comment. Note the unconcern of the polygamist!</p>

<hr>

<h3>A SANCTUARY PROBLEM</h3>

<p>Lest in time to come statements of the past concerning the
plenitude of bird-life on this island should be discredited, and
the author of them declared to be untrustworthy, it is due that
fairly recent observations, the drift of which is anything but
pleasing, should be placed on record.</p>

<p>When the sanctity of a scene unsoiled by the faintest smear of
civilization was violated by the establishment of a human's home,
the number and variety of its birds formed one of several most
attractive features; and it was resolved to protect them in so far
as the power of a single admirer might be effective. This ordinance
was followed by a suggestion to the Government of the State that
the whole of the group of which Dunk Island is the largest should
be created a sanctuary. The proposal was confirmed forthwith, and
for more than two decades all birds, save two predatory species,
have been unmolested.</p>

<p>It was natural to expect that the result of the policy indicated
would be a progressive increase in species and individuals, until
these islands became the resort of an innumerable concord of happy
birds&mdash;indeed, that as the years passed there would be few
native to North Queensland unrepresented in an undisturbed
community. These anticipations have not only been unrealized, but
hard facts show that, instead of increase, there have been, with
few exceptions, serious decreases in species, and in some instances
absolute loss.</p>

<p>Students of bird-life, while sympathizing with the failure of an
experiment in which Nature was to work her own will in her own way,
may be interested in a brief review of the circumstances. They are
sure to be concerned over the results, for do they not indicate
general as well as local conditions from which it is not possible
to draw consoling conclusions?</p>

<p>Early in the occupation of the island an attempt was made to
compile a list of its birds; and eventually, with the co-operation
of friends possessing exact knowledge, a census was made without
the sacrifice of a single life. It was never expected that a list
so arranged would have the least scientific value. Such a result
was not contemplated, the only objects in view being the welfare of
the birds, a tribute to them, and the presentation of a plea for
those of Australia generally.</p>

<p>To one who disclaims expert knowledge, who regards birds from
the standpoint of aestheticism and sentiment blended with utility,
who fears that Australia as a whole has not yet learned the worth
of many species peculiar to the land, and who cons the
steadily-growing "extinct list" with dismay, local experience might
seem to prove the futility of preservative plans. Though
countenanced officially, the moral influence of individuals is sure
to fail. Moreover in some instances even the authority of the State
is powerless to arrest conditions destructive to birds of
restricted range and secluded habits. Material progress is not to
be checked by a shy bird fluttering across the path; but the stern
reproof, "Too late," may yet be averted in respect of many species
if the community as a whole makes demand.</p>

<p>These reflections, however, stand apart from the present
purpose, which designs to tell in what manner and why a project
that promised much personal satisfaction failed in so many
details.</p>

<p>The bird census of the island comprised every species observed,
even casual and rare visitors, and mere wanderers resting, perhaps
for an hour or so, during continental flights. In one instance a
bird never known to alight was included&mdash;the spine-tailed
swift, which occasionally tarries for a meal in the air. In the
list of disappearances those that came shyly and departed with
haste will find no place; but it will include those whose sojourn
was wont to last for a few days and to be deemed recurrent.</p>

<p>Comparison between the census and the depreciated numbers of
recent years show that from the birds of prey the sparrow-hawk,
kestrel, black-shouldered kite and black-checked falcon have
disappeared.</p>

<p>Out of forty perchers eleven are missing&mdash;yellow oriole,
yellow fig-bird (<i>Sphecotheres</i>), black-backed magpie,
black-headed diamond-bird, helmeted friar-bird, silver-eye, and the
blue, pied, shining, white-eared and spectacled flycatchers.</p>

<p>The purple-breasted and white-headed fruit-pigeons, pied
oyster-catcher, masked and golden plover and the plumed egret have
not been seen for years, and among the sea-birds the lesser
crested, sooty and bridled terns find no place at date. (1921)</p>

<p>With the exception of swiftlets, scrub-fowls, swamp pheasants,
brown-winged terns and pied cormorants, an all-round decrease in
numbers has to be recorded, and no species save the brown-winged
tern has the credit of increase.</p>

<p>Among the more notable species showing decrease
are:&mdash;Nutmeg, red-crowned and little green pigeons, metallic
starlings, rainbow-birds, rainbow lorikeets, white cockatoos and
mistletoe-birds.</p>

<p>Inquiry into the causes for the disappearance of birds from this
sanctuary discloses several interesting facts. Easy as it will be
to demonstrate that destructive agencies range from cyclones
directly to orange-pips indirectly, to specify all will be
impossible; but an undoubted truth emerges upon even a superficial
glance at the subject&mdash;that birds of gregarious habits which
happen to be endowed with the gift of beauty, or are in any way
associated with what is known as sport, are the first to be
doomed.</p>

<p>In the latter category is the nutmeg pigeon, than which no bird
on the coast of North Queensland is better known, more talked
about, or more conspicuous. Because these pigeons congregate in
communities on the smaller islands for breeding purposes, the
casual observer is apt to over-estimate their numbers and imagine
that it would be impossible to exterminate what seems to be one of
the superfluities of nature. The big white birds, hanging in
clusters on low trees bowed and bent by their weight, offer
seductive targets, and on the morning after a raid the sand may be
white with rejected dead, while chicks mumble in hundreds of nests
and the white eggs (one in each nest) begin to decay. Unless
patiently cooked, the birds have no attractive qualities on the
table. Those who shoot them, therefore, cannot reflect with an easy
conscience on their achievement. Neither the "sport" nor the table
has afforded gratification, and the deserted nests and the fate of
the orphan chicks stand to the "sportsmen's" discredit if not
disgrace.</p>

<p>The absolute disappearance of nutmeg pigeons from the more
accessible islands seems as inevitable as the passing of the
blacks, and it may be stupidly sentimental to make lament; but the
process brings into light an unworthy national trait against which
no opportunity of railing should be lost. If it were realized that
it is not only unsportsmanlike to kill nesting birds, but stupid
also and inhumane, clean-minded men would scorn the deed. There are
others who scoff at any appeal to manliness and sense, since they
possess neither, and cannot appreciate those qualities in others,
and that class, mischievous and beyond the reproach of words, ought
to be dealt with roughly.</p>

<p>Pretty to look at, right glorious in the enjoyment of freedom,
harmless in every sense, and without doubt useful and necessary in
the scheme of Nature, cannot such birds, even if otherwise
undesirable, be preserved for all time? Or are we to assent to the
charge of being uncouthly selfish, viciously cruel?</p>

<p>Positive as the causes for the decimation of nutmeg pigeons may
be, it is difficult to account for the like disaster to another
gregarious, migratory bird. Metallic starlings come every season
from regions nearer the equator, arriving with the pigeons. They
are more plentiful on the mainland than on the islands, and
generation after generation nests in the same tree, hatching out
three or four broods between August and March. It is well to
confine consideration of the evil times that have befallen these
handsome and useful birds to circumstances and conditions on this
island.</p>

<p>Twenty years ago there were four populous colonies here, and in
time two others were established. One had existed from time whereof
the memory of man went not to the contrary. It lasted until
overthrown by the cyclone of March, 1918. Another colony, in a
gigantic milk-wood tree, must have had an annual output of over a
thousand birds each season. A summary decrease in population was
noticed, and in two seasons the tree was deserted. Similar
conditions apply to two other colonies in milk-wood trees, and at
date of writing not a single colony exists here, though a small one
is established on an islet a mile away. During the period mentioned
the birds were free from interference. Why the loss?</p>

<p>Birds living in crowded communities may be more susceptible to
epidemics than those that favour isolation; but no sign or evidence
of disease has been noticed. Each succeeding year representatives
of the several colonies returned in fewer numbers until occupation
lapsed, and this fact indicates that the loss is not due to local
causes. Is the ubiquitous collector of bird skins responsible?</p>

<p>White cockatoos, strictly protected here, pay penalty for having
acquired a taste for citrus fruits, especially oranges and
mandarins; they are shot by fruit-growers of the mainland,
exasperated by the slovenly ravages of flying foxes and the
indecencies of fruit-flies. The Dunk Island contingent, which was
wont to fly to and fro daily, suffers with degenerate mates. Since
the temptation is of recent date, the liking of the birds for the
forbidden fruit could not have been in obedience to original sin.
It can be traced to the corruption of good manners by evil
communications. In a district about fifty miles to the south, where
natural food is less abundant, cockatoos began to eat the seeds of
the commonest of the guavas (an introduced shrubby tree which,
having overrun considerable tracts, is now treated as a pest), and
thence to orange-pips was an easy step in wickedness. Gradually the
habit spread north, but it was twelve years ere the innocent birds
of this neighbourhood fell from grace and came under the ban of
outlawry. Now they have passed to another stage of sin. Surfeited
with the superabundance of the orange groves, they nip off the ripe
fruit, apparently for the pleasure of watching it fall, and thus
waste more than they destroy in satisfaction of hunger. Punishment
is off-hand and severe; but the cockatoo is a sly bird, and often
the fury of the fruit-grower expends itself in merely verbal
explosions.</p>

<p>The deplorable scarcity of other species, such as the noisy
pitta, the sunbird and the flycatchers (with one exception to be
referred to), is to be debited to the great cyclone. No sunbird,
one of the daintiest, liveliest and prettiest of the residents, was
seen for about a year after the disaster. White-eared flycatchers
disappeared mysteriously, although they had been strong in numbers,
and had been regarded as one of the permanencies. They ranged from
the tops of the highest trees to the lowest bushes, and during the
flowering season of the tea-trees were particularly conspicuous and
active. Then they could be seen at any hour of the day enjoying
themselves among the bottlebrush flowers, where the buzz of insects
never ceases from dawn to dark. This bird had been first seen by
MacGillivray on this island in the year 1848, being described by
its discoverer as "a new and handsome flycatcher." Neither nest nor
eggs have been found, but no attempt at systematic search therefor
was made here, because our interest in bird-life does not lie in
that direction. If the secret had been casually revealed, well and
good. If not, it was enough that the bluish-grey-and-white bird,
which was wont to choose the topmost twig of a garden shrub whence
to announce its friendly calls and, with fluffy ruffle extended, to
tell of its gladness in fluty chuckles, was one of the special
features of this domain. The chief regret is not that it failed to
give a clue to the solution of an ornithological secret, but that
it departed from the Isle without any apparent cause. Hope of its
return, however, has not been abandoned.</p>

<p>Another and very different class, the terns or sea-swallows,
owes its serious losses to conditions as bold and as inexorable as
fate, and it would be unwise to conclude that the present scarcity
is anything but temporary, while accepting the facts as
illustrative of events that may happen elsewhere. The terns did not
assemble in great numbers until several years after the
establishment of the sanctuary, their coming being attributed to
its existence. Disturbed elsewhere, they had found security within
its borders&mdash;such was the flattering conclusion derived from
the ever-increasing population of Purtaboi, the islet in the bay.
For many seasons it teemed with busy and sportful birds, living and
breeding in such conglomeration of species that, were it not for
extraordinary cuteness, blunders of parentage must have occasioned
riots. The noisy, fussy, smelly community was accepted as a happy
augury of a future when other birds would come to place themselves
under protection.</p>

<p>Then a series of absolute checks was imposed, the final disaster
occurring on 3rd February, 1920. Has it not been common knowledge
from the days of the earliest observers of weather that "the sea
without winde swelleth of himself sometime before the coming of the
tempest," and that, though presaging birds often give to human
beings timely warning of a coming storm in advance of men of
science, they on occasion fail to save themselves from the effects
of an impressive combination of natural phenomena, however
frequently repeated?</p>

<p>It may be presumptuous to assume that birds familiar with all
the moods of the ocean might have anticipated the results of a
heavy swell coincident with high-water spring tides&mdash;full moon
occurred on the 4th&mdash;especially when generation after
generation had suffered under like conditions. Be that as it may,
four species of terns, absorbed in the rearing of the third brood
of the tides, were overwhelmed and practically exterminated.</p>

<p>Above the limit of ordinary high tide half an acre of coral
strand had been strewn with eggs in such profusion as to create the
impression of lavishness and waste. The fledgelings, on the
slightest disturbance, would crowd together like frightened
lambs&mdash;they were, too, lamb-like in colour, in muteness and
obedience to the herd instinct&mdash;while anxious parents directed
them from above with continual cries. Then, in darkness, the surges
swept the strand which had been the birthplace, the feeding and
playground of successive broods, young and old being destroyed by
thousands.</p>

<p>Next morning the beach of this island was strewn with the dead
bodies of chicks. Some few had battled successfully against the
waves, and now, disturbed by a sympathetic observer, waddled to the
"still vex'd" water's edge and, gazing in the direction of their
native islet, made unceasing lamentation. In the mass the tones of
terns are thin and shrill, but the individual voices of the
derelicts&mdash;plaintive, pure and vibrant&mdash;sounded sweet and
touched a tender spot. Not one whimpered, though many staggered
with weakness. Each uttered its grievance against fate vigorously
and with a thrill of passion, as if protesting that it had been
treated callously and against the ethics of Nature. The strong,
insistent, expressive plaints of the birds in their distress and
weakness, and the individuality thereby betokened, contrasted
strongly with common impulses of the crowd in the enjoyment of
comfort at home and its silence.</p>

<p>Now for the effect of this harshest of lessons on the part of
Nature. This year but three species of terns visited the islet. A
few black-naped terns, and fewer ternlets, laid eggs on the strand,
and the brown-winged&mdash;which incubates in miniature caves and
grottoes and under shelving rocks, and is therefore unaffected by
tidal inconstancies&mdash;had a most prosperous season, the colony
dispersing stronger in numbers than ever.</p>

<h3>A JUNGLE FLOWER</h3>

<p>During September, the flowery month, and the early part of
October many parts of the coast of North Queensland are decorated
with a plant of remarkable beauty, which seems to have escaped
general notice, though well deserving the admiration of all who
take pleasure in purity, in simplicity of form, and in rich
perfume.</p>

<p>It is the fate of most flowers that grow in deserts, where no
man abides, to die uncommended; but this delightful shrub,
sometimes developing into a small tree, is a denizen of country
which is desert only in the poetic sense, for the soil is fertile,
the rains frequent and abundant, and (as a consequence of
stimulating natural conditions) given over to glorious vegetation,
varied in character, refreshing to behold in the mass, and teeming
with novelties which make appeal to all lovers of plants; and not
without rarities to those who make even casual study of the science
of botany. Though conspicuous by reason both of flowers and fruit,
this desirable plant has no common or pet name. Botanists have
termed it <i>Randia fitzalana</i>. It belongs to the same family as
the gardenias, and in common with several of its relatives is
endowed with strong and pleasant perfume.</p>

<p>F. M. Bailey describes eight species of <i>Randia</i> native to
Queensland, five of which are confined to the tropical North,
ranging from Cape Upstart to the Gulf of Carpentaria, three being
especially heavily scented. One of these three seems to prefer dry
and barren hills. The word "seems" is used deliberately, for the
stunted tree with its scant, creamy-white flowers has not the habit
of a plant with a real love for soil and sun, though it bestows a
blessing on its surroundings when refreshed with dew. Except in a
botanical sense, there are no features of resemblance between this
hairy-leaved endurer of the drought and the habitant of the jungle
under notice, other than in its perfume.</p>

<p>Just now on this Isle are scores of specimens of the
glossy-foliaged shrub on the very margin of the sea, flowering
profusely. Many of the leaves are about six inches long, smooth and
shining, the flowers of the purest white, and the scent that of the
family in its quality of pervasiveness.</p>

<p><i>Randia Fitzalana</i> seldom flourishes when fully exposed to
the sun. Its place is rather under the shade of taller and sturdier
vegetation, and it finds ideal conditions alike at the mouths of
shrub-obstructed creeks and among boulders overhung with trees and
screening vines, where the struggle for existence always seems
tense and unnecessary. Is it a sort of conscious vanity which
impels the graceful plant to occupy deeply-shadowed, if not gloomy,
spots? There, at least, are its intensely-white starry flowers set
off to the best advantage, and there they last longer and breathe
out becoming odours which for the time being monopolize the
attention of the passerby. Simple in form, the flowers are produced
in loose, irregular groups, and are proportionately thick and
leathery, with less tendency than others of the family to become
brown when fading. Posies of the white flowers appear scattered
among the glossy leaves, looking like patches of enamel, precisely
cut; since there are few winds to disturb such sheltered,
well-embowered scenes, the effect is that of formality and primness
contrasted with the unkempt, disorderly luxuriance of the
jungle.</p>

<p>Large, rotund fruit follows the flowers as a rule, but this
season has been so gracious that some plants are displaying flowers
and fruit simultaneously. The latter, however, may not ripen for
months, and when it does so, though attractive by reason of its
size&mdash;that of an average orange&mdash;and yellowish colour, it
is inedible, being hot, insipid and astringent. Blacks confess that
at times hunger has driven them to it, but many other vegetable
products of repugnant appearance are preferred to this
seductive-looking fruit. One cannot with easy mind complain against
the laws of nature when a plant which gives pleasure to the eye
with its big leaves and white flowers, and ravishes the sense of
smell, yet fails in respect of edible fruit; but it may be quite
within reason, and in no spirit of fault-finding, easy to imagine
that in time to come some ingenious and patient horticulturist will
set to work to improve the fruit&mdash;and so, peradventure, bestow
on the world a novelty which, like the orange, will produce fine
foliage, deliciously perfumed flowers and a something excellent to
eat. When the crude forerunner of the orange is compared with one
or other of the fine species of the day, evolved by restrictions
upon natural laws, it does not seem to be impossible so to develop
the fruit of <i>Randia Fitzalana</i> that the edible qualities not
now easily recognized may become dominant.</p>

<p>The plant produces seeds abundantly, so that experiments might
at least be made on an extensive scale. It belongs to the same
family as the mangosteen, and that relationship is at least in its
favour, though indefinite enough, when its possibilities are
pondered. In the meantime, its fascinating qualities are
conspicuous, and naught but gratitude is herein expressed for its
presence under delightful conditions and under no restraint from
the hand of man.</p>

<p>Though the plant affords abundant evidence of its preference for
shade and comparative coolness, occasionally it is found among huge
granite boulders scorching to the touch on blazing days, and within
reach of sea-spray; but in such situations&mdash;with roots matted
in the coarse crevices&mdash;it may be hardly recognizable. The
leaves are small, scattered and dull, and the solitary flowers make
appeal not for admiration but for pity. Stunted, burnt and scalded,
the plant strives to fulfil the exacting laws of Nature, and in its
extremity solicits sympathy and proffers a mere whiff of attenuated
perfume.</p>

<p>It is a gracious plant, under all conditions and
circumstances</p>

For flowering in the wilderness.</blockquote>

<h3>THE REEF MANTIS</h3>

<p>Low tides occur during July, August and September, and lay bare
to the sun considerable areas of the reefs within the Barrier,
which at the opposing period are revealed only to the gleams of the
moon. Then is it wise to make opportunity and, equipped with a
fish-spear and a canister to contain delicate specimens of marine
fauna, use the two hours of the afternoon in pursuit of novelties.
In the degenerate condition of the corals of the shallows in the
vicinity of this island it is also wise to restrain expectations,
for the marvels of fertile reefs, though represented, are not
common. In the flurry of the receding tide, however, all sorts of
strange creatures are heaped, and, taking refuge under blocks of
dead coral and in isolated pools, may be accepted as typical of the
fauna secure from scrutiny on the deep-water reefs.</p>

<p>Lately three or four species of what are known as mantis-shrimps
have been found and sent to one or other of the museums. These
crustaceans have a range extending throughout the warm waters of
the Pacific, but being of necessity shy and secretive&mdash;for
they have many enemies&mdash;are not often seen, at least in these
parts, where time for investigation is limited. It is found on
inquiry that others who have a much wider range know little or
nothing of a most interesting animal. As the familiar name implies,
the mantis-shrimp has a feature in common with a popular
insect&mdash;the praying mantis, flycatcher and voracious feeder,
which has been known to seize and eat a small frog.</p>

<p>One of the specimens submitted to the Australian Museum at
Sydney is thus described by an expert on the staff:</p>

<p>"The specimen presented is most acceptable, since it is new to
the museum collection. It is a representative of a group of
mantis-shrimps, the members of which possess peculiar claw
appendages in which the last segment shuts down like the blade of a
pocket-knife. These claws form very efficient weapons, and it is
because of their position that the resemblance to the common
praying mantis gives them the popular name applied to the insect.
Mantis-shrimps are generally found in shallow water, burrowing in
the sand or hiding in the crevices in rocks and corals. They are
described as lying in wait at the mouths of their burrows, darting
out on fish and other animals, which are seized with their great
claws, and retreating with great rapidity to the bottom of the
burrow with their prey. They have a long series of larval stages,
and the larvae are all distinguished by the large size of the
carapace (the shield covering the back) which in some cases
envelops the greater portion of the body. In the warm seas some
larvae attain a relatively large size, sometimes exceeding two
inches in length, and the glass-like, transparency gives them a
striking appearance. During the larval stages they swim at the
surface, and the influences of the ocean currents account for their
wide distribution."</p>

<p>Differences in size, appearance and colouring are noticeable
among the representatives of the family, even in a limited area.
One, the most formidable, attains a length of ten inches. It is a
weak, almost broken-backed creature, with a most resentful and
sudden temper. Although its wonderful weapon has been frequently
found on the beach, only one living specimen has been secured, for
its habits appear to be nocturnal. The burrow is in the centre of a
low, flat-topped mound in unctuous mud fortified with sand, and
generally its inhabitant is not at home. One came up on the bait of
a fishing-line at night, and presented such a dazzling effect, as
it was lifted into the boat, absorbed with its prey, that it was
handled rashly. With lightning-like rapidity it struck, and the
biggest and sharpest tooth of its scythe pierced the tip of my
finger. The deed was so sudden that, although the blow was felt,
there was no immediate pain, but blood flowed as from a far bigger
wound.</p>

<p>The weapon resembles a scythe in shape, but is unlike that
implement in that it is fitted with a series of comb-like teeth,
exceedingly sharp and graduated in length. At first glance the limb
supporting it appears to be malformed, for it bulges at the elbow
joint into a "dumb-bell," weighty compared with the size of the
animal. The purpose of this development is obvious. Does it not
correspond to the biceps of human beings, putting wonderful force
into the blow? The creature, trained by nature to defend its life
and secure its prey, uses its weapon with precision and skill. It
kills and at the same time clutches.</p>

<p>One of the family, developing along different lines, is even
better of its hands; remarkable to tell, it carries a cestus of
hardened shell as a means of protection and enforcing its rights.
From the structure of the limbs it is safe to assume that neither
of the species delivers a forward, but rather a descending,
hammer-like blow, and the mimic pugilist's design is, no doubt,
exactly the same as that of the prize-fighter. The twinkling blow
stuns the victim, which probably never has time to come to. As far
as local knowledge goes at present, the boxer is found in these
waters only in a small form, which can deliver but a feeble, almost
affectionate tap; but it seems that its "dumb-bell" elbow joint is
bigger relatively than that of its cousin with the slender-toothed
scythe. Some one has said that nature seems everywhere in advance
of those inventions of which we, as men, are so proud. The
mantis-shrimps, afford two examples of the truth of the saying.</p>

<p>In that fine book, <i>A Naturalist in Borneo</i>, the late
Robert W. C. Shelford describes a giant of the boxer kind, which
when dropped into a glass tube full of spirit shattered it with a
blow. He concludes a detailed description of the animal
thus:&mdash;"The action is as rapid as that of a strong spring, and
the force of the blow has to be felt to be appreciated; I am quite
certain that it is sufficient to stun any small fish or crustacean.
It is conceivable that a stunned animal could be held and quietly
devoured."</p>

<p>No available reference to the mantis-shrimps mentions a most
attractive feature, the lovely and fanciful colouring. Some are
honey-yellow, some moss-green, some drab, some decked out with all
sorts of fringes and finery in delicate and living tints. In the
sunlight the hues change and sparkle with intensity. No jewel
polished by the skill of man flashes forth more vivid and more
varied splendour. Nor is any human acrobat more supple or more
agile, as an incident connected with the preservation of a specimen
for expert examination demonstrated.</p>

<p>Dropped into limpid fluid in a tube so narrow that reversal
seemed impossible, one of the lovely creatures performed a series
of somersaults with rapidity bewildering to sight. For a few
seconds the tube seemed to contain an agitated tumbling mosaic,
compact of all the gems of the world. Was ever a fight for life so
fierce and so futile? Was ever a death scene so gorgeous? It was
glorious. It was shocking. From such another spectacle of
death-agony and brilliancy may the fates protect us! Unlike the
powerful representative of the family in Borneo, it was unable to
shatter its prison walls. There was no possible escape in the
circumstances, and deliverance would have been but added cruelty.
When, at last, it was still, upright in the transparent cell, its
fore-limbs in the posture of supplication, it was not a museum
specimen, but an unspeakably pathetic object appealing for a vow of
abstinence from all investigations involving the sacrifice of life.
Worth such a gallant struggle, its little life seemed too precious
to waste deliberately, even in the cause of science&mdash;and be
sure, had not the experience been exceptional, some drowsy drug
would have eased its pangs. The lesson of that scene, illuminated
in tints unstainable, unfading, will live as long as memory.</p>

<p>In some countries blessed by the living waters of the Pacific
certain species of mantis-shrimps are eaten by the natives, six
making a good meal. Here they do not appear to be plentiful enough
to afford a change of diet. Besides, whose is the haughty stomach
that demands a meal of delicate jewellery? Better perhaps to souse
them in formalin, after a preparatory whiff of chloroform, for the
edification of the learned folks of the museum.</p>

<h3>REEF JEWELLERY</h3>

<p>Among the many living things that contribute to the
never-ceasing attractions of a coral-reef are those which depend
for their existence on association with others remarkably different
in appearance, character and habit. Observers of skill and
experience have proved that the association is for mutual benefit;
but in some cases, and those of the more obvious nature, the
advantages may appear one-sided.</p>

<p>What gain is it to certain species of fish to have a rotund crab
in a cell in close proximity to the eyes&mdash;a phenomenon, it
should be said, by no means confined to the warm waters of the
tropics? And what advantage is it to the shark and turtle and
dugong to have the company of sucker-fish? The latter, of course,
is spared the exertion of self-propulsion through the water, and
the host may not be seriously inconvenienced by the slight
additional tax on its energy; but when, as sometimes, the blacks
use the sucker-fish as a means for the capture of its erstwhile
host, the end is tragedy.</p>

<p>It is easy to appreciate the reasons for association between the
huge, bright-blue anemone, common in tropical waters, and a tiny
fish of wonderfully brilliant tints. The latter hides from its
enemies in the folds of its host, and seems distraught with anxiety
if, as it flits above and around, it is by a sudden manoeuvre
driven a few inches therefrom, to be easily captured. In addition
to a tenant which is believed to be welcome, the blue anemone has
been shown to be troubled by multitudes of small crustaceans, the
colour of which exactly matches that of their host. Authorities
assert that some such crustaceans form the food of the herring,
which is popularly believed to live on water.</p>

<p>Just as terrestrial animals have their parasites and
hyperparasites, so the denizens of the reef may support other
creatures of diverse habits and mode of living. The fleas of the
seas have lesser fleas; but such insignificances are beyond the
notice of the individual who is looking for living jewellery in the
warm waters. Here is something more attractive. Upon a dead bailer
shell stands an anemone about four inches high&mdash;a
neutral-coloured stem surmounted by a head of pink and purple
waving filaments. From the shell is obtruded the head and legs of a
hermit crab, deep red in colour and bristling with repellant
points. The anemone&mdash;delicate feeder&mdash;thrives on the
scraps and shreds scattered by the clumsy and greedy crab. The body
of the crab is soft, and no doubt appetizing to fish that could
draw it from its refuge; but the anemone is armed with irritating
weapons which fish dread. Independently, neither crab nor anemone
would lead a contented life. Together they are fairly safe, and the
picture they present is particularly rich in tint.</p>

<p>In other species the anemone is attached to the back of the
crab, and in the case of a nervous, soft-bodied crab lodging with a
living sponge a third associate is invariably present&mdash;a worm
which acts as scavenger and keeps the hermit's quarters clean. The
reason for the presence of the third and most humble partner is
obvious. Ordinarily, the hermit crab moves to a larger refuge in
accordance with its growth. The elasticity of the sponge renders
the change unnecessary, and the sanitary worker becomes essential.
The provider, the protector and the domestic thus establish an
ordered if unenterprising community, each contributing to the
maintenance according to its aptitudes, each obtaining the
gratification of its needs.</p>

<p>If the brighter and prettier examples of associated lives among
marine creatures are to be contemplated, one must visit the
coral-reefs; even then, if he be untrained and inexpert, he will
see only the more public exponents of a phase of existence of most
varied nature, in some instances edifying, in others bewildering.
There is a slim mollusc never found except in association with a
particular species of sponge. The shells are of social habit,
dozens living in a community, each buried to the extremity of its
valves in the compact mass of the sponge. Some of the living
sponges have the gift of being able to warn off enemies by, it
would seem, the discharge of an irritating fluid. The host of the
present example has no weapon of offence appreciable in its effects
by human beings, whilst the shells are not nearly as frail as
others that lead independent lives.</p>

<p>One of the marvels connected with the jewellike prawns
associated with sea anemones is the power they possess of
controlling their colours to match those of their hosts. Indeed, it
is possible to watch certain degrees of the changes. The phenomena
has been thus described by an expert, Mr. R A. Potts, who studied
the life of the reefs in Torres Straits:&mdash;</p>

<p>"The prawn has the power of forming red, yellow and blue
pigments, and by altering their relative proportions in the
chromatophores it can acquire a green, brown, blue or red
ground-colour, and is thus able to adapt itself to the varied
colours of seaweeds and hydroids. The pigment may be laid down in
longitudinal strips or horizontal bars, and in this way a
colour-scheme can be formed matching whatever seaweed the prawn
shelters in."</p>

<p>Proof of the accuracy of this observation was given when the
tides favoured an investigation of a portion of the reef. As the
tide rose a small anemone emerged from the sand and began to wave
its singular filaments&mdash;dull-yellow in tint and in form not
unlike a cauliflower run to seed. There was nothing out of the
common about the animal; but, the habit of watching such things
having been established, its ordinary movements served for
entertainment. Presently a shadowy form passed slowly over a
portion of the moving filaments, and on close inspection a slender,
almost transparent, prawn was seen. It glided hither and thither
with almost imperceptible motion, now and again being, as it were,
absorbed by its host. Alert, almost, as a sunbeam when aroused, the
little creature would have been safe from capture but for its
attachment to its home.</p>

<p>The general tint was that of the host&mdash;yellowish-green with
white blotches, the main part of the body transparent, the pattern
of the host being duplicated in miniature. The opaque white spots
on each side were not of uniform size nor were they arranged
according to uniform design. Each of the scales at the end of the
tail was ornamented with a circular purple spot, and these spots
not only varied in intensity of tint, but in size and position,
showing that they were under the control of the animal.</p>

<p>Some species sting with more than the intensity of the nettle.
This host did not in any way molest an interfering finger, and its
tender associate seemed to depend for its safety on the fact of
close resemblance. On restoring the prawn, it was noticed that it
had become darker in colour, the transparent parts being slightly
clouded and the purple spots of the tail almost black. In a few
minutes the ordinary tints were resumed and the little creature
moved, spectre-like, over the filaments of its host&mdash;a living
jewel.</p>

<hr>

<h3>AN ISLE AND A REEF</h3>

<p>About fourteen miles north from Dunk Island, and three miles off
the coast of North Queensland, lie the Barnard Islands, so named in
1819 by Captain (afterwards Admiral) Phillip P. King, in honour of
his friend Edward Barnard.</p>

<p>Though condemned to spend most of the time as two isolated,
jungle-covered knolls, the southernmost portion of the group
(generally known as the South Barnards), is a single formation. A
shallow sea separates the detached parts, but low-water spring
tides expose a broad bond of union, an irrefragable proof of their
oneness and indivisibility. The alliance may be secret, but is very
secure. It frets the intemperate sea, and makes it froth and roar
with rage. Outlasting all the blustering fury, it is stolidly
irresponsive, too, when the coiling coquette gently slaps its face
with the softest of white flounces. This rustic bond, defiant to
all the moods of the unstable sea, confirms the legitimacy of the
union of the Isle, and forms an interesting feature in a pretty
scene.</p>

<p>Another reef, or ridge, or causeway, true as a surveyor's line,
juts out from the western point, almost parallel with the main and
complete connecting-link. This smaller spur acts as a break-water,
and the terminus is furnished with a rough T, which, though rather
jumbled and broken seems to indicate that Nature designed, in her
off-hand way, a plan worthy the imitation of man.</p>

<p>The smaller of the ridges is basaltic, and in its ruggedness
resembles the jaw of "some pre-Adamite beast setting its teeth
against the sky;" yet the larger portion of the Isle is coarse
sandstone, or rather conglomerate, with basaltic blocks and
boulders. A miniature bluff, sixty or eighty feet high, accentuates
the south-western aspect, and at the base of it are strewn huge
blocks which the vortices of the sea have torn down. Rather a rich
brown in general tone, the exposed surfaces of the bluff display an
attractive collection of geological fragments, rough and angular
pebbles and sharp chips of speckled granite quartz of the purity of
alabaster, reddish-grey porphyry, with occasional pieces of
brick-red sandstone, nodules of greenish-black basalt, etc.</p>

<p>Under the attacks of the sea, the bluff is being rapidly broken
down. Ledges, niches and hollows have been worn on the precipitous
face. Just out of the reach of the salt surges, the rock is fretted
with the fibrous roots of fig and umbrella-trees, pandanus palm and
hibiscus bushes. The better half of the Isle may be best described
as a mass of conglomerate and basalt resting upon a platform of
basalt of extreme density. At a rough estimate it is less than
twenty acres in area.</p>

<p>Originally, save for two or three of the steeper individual
slopes, the whole surface was covered with jungle. A great part
still remains, the luxuriousness of which seems extraordinary when
one regards the thinness of the soil and apparent sterility of the
rough conglomerate. The vegetation is there, glorious in its
profuseness and healthiness. Very many years ago the islet was the
headquarters of a b&eacute;che-de-mer fisherman. He began the
clearing of the western aspect, where the soil is red and very
fertile. Then another took up his abode, extended the clearing,
planted coco-nut palms, several kinds of fruit trees, sugar-cane,
sweet potatoes, taro, etc., etc., and went his way. The last-comer
revels in the fruits of former industry, for the man who
demonstrated the resources of the soil now resides at Murdering
Point, three miles to the west, and the islet smiles complacently
to itself, except when sportsmen come to do violence to its
birds.</p>

<p>The chief vegetable feature of the islet nowadays is the
marvellous robustness of its papaws. Upon this ideal spot the plant
has set its foot, and is at home. No one who admires the papaw
could, without breach of courtesy, attribute to it the vulgar habit
of crowding upon and elbowing away other vegetation possessing
equal rights to a common plot. But if the papaw is not in this
particular republic of vegetation becoming tyranically rude, it is
at least very boldly asserting its rights. On the slopes, on the
edges of the jungle, among basalt boulders, on the highest
elevation, on rocky terraces, where there is no soil save in cracks
and crevices, deep in the heart of the jungle are self-centred
groves of papaws. At the base of a romantic cliff of basalt reposes
a forest of papaws&mdash;not spindly weaklings, but sturdy plants,
thirty feet high, fruitful and odorous. Up and over the verge of
this little basaltic precipice the facile wind blows from a
befittingly narrow ravine, heavily freighted with perfume of a
whole grove, down upon the lusty heads of which we admiringly
gaze.</p>

<p>It is the very paradise of papaws. They flourish in places, and
situations, and under conditions hitherto considered impossible or
unseemly in such a discreet and orderly plant. They have abandoned
all reserve, submitting to the touch and strong embraces of the
aboriginal plants of the isle, and even stamping them underfoot or
shoving them away from accustomed places.</p>

<p>In genial air, and soil to its liking, the natural habit of the
papaw finds true expression. With its tap-root squeezed and
flattened in the crevice of a rock, it sends its feeders over the
surface, gripping like a parasite, and gathering sustenance from
uncompromising conglomerate. The gale may uproot a seemingly
ambitious plant, but it will not die. It grows as it lies
recumbent, with a kink in its neck, gamely contending for its share
of sunlight, and offering abundant and easily gathered
tribute&mdash;fruit large and without spot or blemish. Tons of
papaws might be gathered where, according to accepted tradition,
the plant could hardly be expected to grow. Is there a satisfactory
reason for the wonderful vigour of the desirable plant among basalt
and conglomerate?</p>

<p>Yes, plainly so.</p>

<p>Possibly for thousands of years this islet has been one of the
"rookeries" of the white nutmeg pigeon. Millions have mated and
reared families here, and thousands do so to this day. On the 11th
August we saw the first flight of the season of nesting birds. So
vast are the flocks that the very rocks must have become saturated
with manure; for the birds breed during the first part of the wet
season, and the average annual rainfall is about 140 inches.</p>

<p>A gardener will tell you that, if you place a quarry at his
disposal and provide him with manure and water, he will convert it
into a garden. Nature on this spot provides an apt illustration,
and this sumptuous display of fruitfulness reacts on the birds. In
spite of the raids of sportsmen, nutmeg pigeons come in thousands,
and are not without company. During a morning's all-too-hasty
exploration I noted also the tranquil dove, rose-crowned
fruit-pigeon, scrub-fowl, brown quail, leaden flycatcher,
black-and-white flycatcher; varied honey-eater, eastern swallow,
white-rumped wood-swallow, silver-eye, black-and-white
caterpillar-eater, nightjar, sacred kingfisher, sordid kingfisher,
black-cheeked falcon, osprey, brown kite, and the shrill tern whose
call has been described as a blending of a cat's mieow with the
squeak of a rusty key.</p>

<p>The bird season is yet at its beginning. No doubt this informal
census might be triplicated if the observation extended over a
week. Of course, it is inevitable that I should urge upon those who
are in closer association with the Isle than myself to strive to
have it proclaimed a sanctuary for birds. Shooting in such a spot
is not sport, and might be described as sacrilege.</p>

<p>Between the South Barnards and the mainland extend King's Reefs,
miles of coral-rock and sandy shallows. There is a passage through
the reefs; but it is so intricate that in default of exact local
knowledge its navigation is dangerous, though at high tides the
smaller coastal steamers may pass in almost any direction without
concern. Though not as fruitful as many a similar area adjacent to
the coast, King's Reefs are decidedly interesting to the observer
of marine fauna. Varied and fantastic forms of coral are not
plentiful, but huge blocks standing on sturdy pedestals, tipsy
toadstools, and irregular mushrooms are common enough. Narrow
fjords, sparkling clear, wind through and intersect the masses of
coral, and fish, bright as butterflies and far more alert, flash in
and out of mazes more bewildering than that in which Rosamund's
bower was secluded.</p>

<p>On the sandy flats, and among corals of less robust habit,
starfish are plentiful, the commonest variety being about a foot in
width, red, with black bosses. Though bright red seemed to be most
fashionable, the colour occurred in all shades, the lowest tone
being a creamy pink. One fish obtained on the main reef was about
eight inches long and, though belonging to the gaily decorated
parrot species, struck quite a superior note, its colours being
alternate bands of vivid vermillion and the boldest blue, the eyes
flame-hued with sapphire-blue pupils, and the prominent teeth like
flawless turquoise.</p>

<p>Two days were spent in exploring the islet and its surroundings,
the last being devoted to the outlying detached portion of the reef
lying to the south about a mile and a half distant from it. This
was found to consist of basalt boulders, of no great size, and
coral, the patch being narrow and about a mile long. Deep water
"docks" occur, and at low tide&mdash;the very lowest of the year
had been availed of&mdash;there are several lagoons more or less
partaking of the nature of coral gardens. Here and there, in the
confusion of oyster-covered basalt, are slight depressions, in
several of which were accumulations of basalt pebbles, oval or
rounded, and about the size of a hen's egg. Many were covered with
a thin scale of lime, and the regularity in size and
shape&mdash;due to attrition, no doubt&mdash;attracted attention.
Strips of muntz metal, three pieces of round iron encrusted with
oysters, and several pieces of thick plate-glass jammed together
between two boulders, provided evidence of the portions of some
forgotten wreck.</p>

<p>From one mass of coral seven varieties of fish were poked, and
the whole lagoon teemed with small and alert creatures with rare
ability for concealing themselves in coral puzzles.
Shells&mdash;clams, cones and cowries&mdash;were plentiful, many
being handsome, if not uncommon. Time did not permit a careful
examination of all parts of the reef, but sufficient was seen to
cause continual pleasure and to excite the wish that just for once
the tide would cease to flow, so that all the hours of daylight
might be spent in observation. Not that the reef is over-rich in
novel forms of life, but the circumstances were exceptionally
favourable for minute investigation. While one admires without
constraint the lustre of living shells, and the remarkable garments
of invisibility which certain species throw over their shoulders,
for richness of colour and diversity of design some of the lowly
corals and sponges, and those inanimate "growths" which fixedly
adhere to the under-surface of stones and blocks of coral, are not
to be surpassed.</p>

<p>These dull stones, partially buried in sand, reveal in blotches,
in daubs and in patches all the extravagancies of a painter's
palate. Are such brilliant colours and tints&mdash;unimaginably
profuse and delicate&mdash;necessary features for animals of such
crude organism, when they appear to be mere disembodied splashes
and drips from the brush of the Great Artist?</p>

<p>Look at this fantastic patchwork brightening the obscurity of an
up-turned stone with glowing orange! In perfectly regular, minute
dots a pattern of squares cut into right-angles by intersecting
lines, and slightly raised in the centre, is being worked out; but
the fabric is ragged on the edges. With miraculous precision the
design is being followed, each stitch the counterpart of the other.
Unless this other formless blotch of sage-green interferes, and by
more robust habit crowds it out, the whole under-surface of the
stone may be covered with a quilt of orange. Why is this particular
miniature dome of coral of so rich a mauve? Why is it bespangled
with millions of snow-white crystals? And why&mdash;where no
appreciative eye sees them&mdash;should parti-coloured algae flaunt
such graceful plumes?</p>

<p>What marvellous fertility of imagination in form and hue is
exhibited in every quiet pool! For the greater part of the year all
this reef is under water, inaccessible to man&mdash;and man alone,
probably, is the one product of Nature gifted with qualities which
enable him to find disinterested pleasure in the parade of
colour.</p>

<p>Until the flowing tide bade us begone we lingered, and as the
lagoons gurglingly filled, we saw ripples from shoals of fish
scurrying back to accustomed haunts as sheep along familiar tracks
to their folds.</p>

<p>And so, up with the little lug-sail. Vagabonds that we were, we
knew not (and the day was far spent) where we should rest that
night. We had slept on a dissolute isle&mdash;the empty bottles and
defilement of battered meat-tins told the tale&mdash;and whither,
on this superb evening, would the breeze condescend to waft us?
Back to the dissolute isle or over the empurpled sea, on to some
clean Australian beach? It mattered not. Ours was a state of
absolute indifference, and as for the zephyrs, they were sweet with
indecision for many minutes.</p>

<p>Then, under indolent easterly airs, across to Nee Morna, and
beneath shady calophyllums, with the harvest moon illuminating the
gloomy headland, to spread our rugs. It would not be seemly to
record how many fish, sniggled from coral recesses and baked on the
embers, were eaten. This, with apologies for its lack of romance,
is not a fish story.</p>

<hr>

<h3>DOGS THAT HAVE BEEN</h3>

<p>It seems to me that the man who walks through the wilderness of
this world unaccompanied by dogs, who has not understood the mind
of the dog, and who has not been the object of the self-denying
devotion of a dog, misses a good deal of the art of living.</p>

<p>Does that "equal sky" exist wherein we shall have the company of
all our dogs? It will be a great pleasure and also a great
embarrassment. With what a composite pack shall I be surrounded!
Indeed, it will be a pack, not a procession, for who would decree
and insist upon any order of precedence among such a multitude of
clamorous pets? Bull-terriers, retrievers, nondescripts&mdash;the
dog-lover abhors the term mongrel&mdash;sheep dogs and cattle dogs,
pointers, and, most beloved of all, Irish terriers. The pack would
include two or three rather uncommon and somewhat foreign
elements&mdash;a red chow from Canton and a dingo from the silent
places of the Star River. But Irish terriers would be the most
conspicuous of the pack.</p>

<p>Everyone knew "Paddy," who came from Melbourne, whose one lop
ear and one erect ear gave him such a leery, devil-may-care air,
who died at an honourable age with a sigh on the verandah here, and
was buried on the bank; and though the bush rats may scamper over
his head "he lies fast asleep."</p>

<p>There was one episode in Paddy's career which has never been
told. His comic aspect and "rakehelly" demeanour belied his lofty
lineage, bestowing the fictitious air of a vagabond and a swaggerer
upon a dandy and a gentleman. In his cunning, courage and
perseverance he not only out-matched rats, lizards and the echidna,
but took his part when the tide ebbed in turning out fish from
coral recesses, or coursing them with great success in the
shallows, and was equally impetuous in the vain attempt to retrieve
a shark, or turtle, or stingray which showed on the surface as we
sailed.</p>

<p>In the days prior to the fall which my haughty spirit merited, I
was vain in the handling of a boat, and my little knowledge proved
most dangersome to Paddy and others. In holiday humour, with
another and two black boys (Willie and Charlie) we drifted out of
Brammo Bay on the ebb with idle sails, all serene and bright.
Mischance surely was never further away as we conferred, saying
that the current and not the breeze was to be depended on this
preoccupied morning. Yet a vagrant and wanton puff skipped on the
hill-top, snoodled between two steep ridges, whisked coyly out of a
bottle-necked gorge, impudently slapped the big jib, and in a trice
the skimming dish-boat had made an unbecoming exhibition. Half a
mile from land&mdash;and not a soul within many miles to send us
aid; clinging to the up-turned boat while contemplating the fact
that the intense calm of the morning was giving way before a stiff
north-easterly breeze&mdash;how grim a transformation to the gay
little scene of a few moments past! The pursuit of pleasure had led
us into dismaying difficulties.</p>

<p>Persuasions, backed by threats of personal violence&mdash;for in
my hand was the ornamental tiller, hard as iron, to which I had
clung while I swam, supporting the passenger who could not
swim&mdash;started Willie for the shore; and as he swam away there
was leisure for a few moments, and we thought of Paddy. Charlie had
not seen him.</p>

<p>"That fella drown&mdash;finish! Him tie up alonga rigging. No
come up one time. My word, poor pfella Paddy; good-bye. Me plenty
sorry."</p>

<p>I argued that the dog must have swam for the shore ahead of
Willie, but Charlie persisted in his theory.</p>

<p>I could not squat idly on the slippery bottom of the boat with
the knowledge that an old and faithful friend was dead as a result
of my vanity and carelessness. So I dived among the tangled
cordage, but found him not. Then Charlie, forcibly persuaded by the
dog-headed tiller, perfunctorily followed my example, also without
result. Perhaps the poor dog was floating in the forepart of the
boat, where she was decked.</p>

<p>Grasping the chaffing-piece and allowing my body to float away
under the boat, I explored with my feet as far as my legs could
stretch. By the same plan other parts of the boat were
investigated, until my toes touched Paddy's feet, working as though
a treadmill. With a shout of joy I dived, seized the dog, drew him
down and past the combing, and in a moment had him safe in the free
air.</p>

<p>Fully a quarter of an hour had elapsed since the mishap, and how
had Paddy escaped? The sudden and complete capsize had imprisoned a
small volume of air against the bottom of the boat. In his game
struggles for liberty Paddy had found the gracious bubble, and had
kept his shrewd nose in it in the dark all those long minutes.</p>

<p>In the meantime Willie had gained the shore, and in due course
paddled out to the scene of the wreck in a frail punt. And the
nerves of one individual of the party have thrilled at the thought
of a sailing-boat ever since!</p>

<p>When Paddy died lamented, there came others.</p>

<p>Among them was "Whirra," excitable, hysterical Whirra, whose
hasty, impetuous career had to be compassionately ended with a
bullet, because of the distressfulness of prolonged attacks of heat
apoplexy. And to Whirra, "Barry" succeeded&mdash;another of the
little red devils of the famous "Towers Lad" strain, and who in
name and voice, a rich baritone, gave perpetual refreshment to
much-prized friendship. Barry, like the Turk, could bear no brother
near the throne of his affections, and yet bore himself
independently, and was for ever vigilant in the protection of his
rights and vociferous concerning them. When we went alongside the
Lass o' Gowrie, good Captain Kerr so often had a plateful of scraps
for Barry that the masterful little dog soon became convinced that
the steamer called in for the special purpose of giving him an
extra meal of tit-bits. One day brought disappointment, however,
and Barry, no great whimperer, proclaimed his wrong and demanded
his right so undeniably that the steamer service was for the moment
thrown out of gear.</p>

<p>It was during the wet season, when the commingled floods from
the Murray and Tully Rivers race past the sand-spit at the rate of
about four miles an hour. Barry stood expectant in the bows of the
boat without remark until the line was cast loose, and the boat
shot astern. Then, lifting his voice in complaint and remonstrance,
he reminded the captain of his presence and rights. And the
captain, shouting impossible instructions to come back, manoeuvred
the Gowrie until the drifting boat was alongside, and the
beseeched-for bones thrown down, and apologized thus: "I'm sorry I
forgot Barry's bones!" But, you see, Captain Kerr (who never forgot
afterwards, whatever hour of night or day the Gowrie came) is a
dog-lover, as well as a large-hearted, unselfish,
fond-of-giving-pleasure-to-others sort of man.</p>

<p>And after Barry came his son "Scoot," who died in his prime
after a week's illness, attributed rightly or wrongly to
tick-fever. There never was a more faithful companion; from his
waddling days until the last he never left me, and the tokens of
his affections were superabundantly manifested. He, too, was
melodiously voiced, and never a steamer nor sailing boat went by
night or day that he did not see and salute tunefully from uplifted
muzzle. The last departed of one's pets is naturally the more
tenderly regarded; yet I am inclined to think that none of my pack
will be more glad to see me in that "equal sky" than Scoot. Though
he had a trace of melancholy in his disposition, on occasion his
joy was exuberant. He knew more of the geography of adjacent coral
reefs than I did, for he covered in his hunting more generous
spaces, and I would not like to confess how many species of fish he
turned out and killed. He has joined the expectant pack, and</p>

<p>I will not think those good brown eyes<br>
Have spent their light of truth so soon,<br>
But in some canine Paradise<br>
Your wraith, I know, rebukes the moon,<br>
And quarters every plain and hill<br>
Seeking its master...As for me<br>
This prayer at least the gods fulfil;<br>
That when I pass the flood, and see<br>
Old Charon of the Stigian coast<br>
Take toll of all the shades who land.<br>
Your little, faithful barking ghost<br>
May leap to lick my phantom hand.</p>

<h3>FACTS AND MUSINGS</h3>

<p>[The accompanying article, written for the North Queensland
Newspaper Company by the late E. J. Banfield, was found on his
office table at Dunk Island, awaiting despatch. It is a
characteristic sketch, embodying the charm of style, the sweet
charity, the playful humour, and the merriment of the man, his
innate diffidence and rare modesty. It is just one of the
Beachcomber's delightful "Homilies," the last from his clever pen,
and in all appreciation and sadness we, with his many readers, must
accept it as his valedictory.&mdash;Editor, Townsville <i>Daily
Bulletin</i>, 25th June, 1923.]</p>

<p>Students of natural history will have read with varying
sentiments two contributions published in the <i>North Queensland
Register</i> of 9th April&mdash;"Marsupial Tiger" and "Nature
Studies"&mdash;each of which contains statements in need of
explanation. The self-imposed duty of correcting misconceptions
therein is undertaken not in a carping or superior spirit, nor with
the idea of showing off a trifle of acquired knowledge; but in
order to put certain matters of general interest on a sound
footing.</p>

<p>As preliminary, a recent incident illustrative of the
desirableness of exact knowledge on the part of those who describe
the wonders of Nature may be told. One of the writer's
correspondents is an expert on the staff of an Australian museum. A
specimen was submitted to him with a somewhat vaunting suggestion
as to its due place in the list of beach curiosities, and with an
invitation to laugh at the pretensions of an amateur in thus
encroaching on the realms of the specialist. He put the lovely
relic in an order quite apart, saying:&mdash;"I don't dare to laugh
at anybody's misidentifications; I make so many myself."</p>

<p>There speaks the knowledgeable man&mdash;the one who knows so
much that he realizes how little he knows. It is not the part of a
mere dabbler to endeavour to take other observers to task; but it
does seem a duty to indicate good-naturedly, and as promptly as
possible, obvious blunders. One likes to repeat a dictum of one of
Old England's greatest statesmen:&mdash;"Don't be too damned surly
about your facts." That may be sound advice in the game of
politics, and surely it is too often put into practice; but natural
history demands of its followers a higher standard, for Mother
Nature is inexorable in demonstrating her truths, to the confusion
of those who take half-views of her everyday mysteries.</p>

<p>About the "marsupial tiger,"&mdash;that blood-thirsty beast
which is said to patrol "the mysterious fastnesses of the
Palmerville Ranges." In the face of evidence of those who have
declared its existence on the strength of actual observation, it
would be silly to assert dogmatically that there is no such animal
in any part of North Queensland. Many a time stories have been told
of the existence of a so-called tiger-cat in the wilds of North
Queensland. In this neighbourhood some "alarming incidents" have
occurred in the vicinity of fowl roosts; and invariably the
blood-thirsty animal has proved to be an overgrown native cat,
which men of science term the North Australian native cat. Not so
very long ago the bones of a cassowary were found on the slope of a
range quite close to the sea, which were declared by the blacks to
be those of a victim of a cat which was wont to pounce on the
shoulders of the great bird as it passed beneath the low-growing
branches of a tree.</p>

<p>It is quite possible that a subtle beast like the native cat
could master a cassowary from such a point of vantage; but the
blacks seem to have had no knowledge of any carnivorous animal of
larger size. They, however, made pets of domesticated cats, the
progeny of which occasionally ran wild, and there are two incidents
on record of the terrifying effects that the animal "that walks by
itself" may assume.</p>

<p>On one occasion a lonesome settler, in broad daylight, came
across the lair of one such "stray," and approaching in a friendly
way, was greeted with such hostility&mdash;blazing eyes,
backward-laid ears and hissing&mdash;that he retired, without risk
of a scratch, feeling sure that, unarmed, he was no match for a
furious beast.</p>

<p>Again, an overgrown "Tom" strolled into a camp with such show of
humility and friendliness that it was welcomed as a possible pet
for a little girl. In a few days it attached itself to the child
with every token of affection, and soon became familiar with all
the members of the temporary home, and an overpowering bully to two
or three masterful dogs. One evening the father of the child saw
her walking away from the cat, which followed in her footsteps.
Suddenly the cat crouched, and springing on to the child's
shoulders, dashed her to the ground, clawing and biting at her
throat. The man ran to the rescue, felled the cat as it fled, and
found the girl so badly mauled and bitten that he believes she
would have been killed but for his intervention. Possibly the
"marsupial tiger" may prove to be a tame cat, improved in ferocity
and size by the climate and fare of North Queensland.</p>

<p>The writer of "Nature Studies" goes slightly astray with
reference to the walking and jumping fish of the mangroves, which,
of course, is quite different from the Queensland lung-fish, termed
by men of science, <i>Neoceratodus forsteri</i>. The latter belongs
to a singularly interesting group, forming a connecting link
between fishes and frogs, and has been referred to as a living
fossil. Two species of the walking fish are known in Queensland
waters, that which is referred to being, probably, <i>Periopthalmus
kolreuteri</i>. Experts tell us that it has gills at the base of
the tail as well as in the ordinary region, which enable it to
breathe moist air when the head is above water&mdash;a common
attitude. Is it true that these creatures feed on crustaceans,
sea-slugs and the like? Perhaps so, in the very early stages of
development.</p>

<p>During recent years a newcomer in the way of ants has been
observed on this Isle, and according to rather indefinite
observations, seems to represent a radical cure for the so-called
"white ants" The majority of the "new" insect in each community are
very small and frail, the colour being a pale watery brown. When
the foragers have found something good to eat&mdash;flesh food
preferred&mdash;within a few minutes a crowd gathers, and if the
object is bulky a few compatriots, more than double in size and
weight of the scouts, and fitted with massive head and jaws to
match, come to the help of the feeble folk.</p>

<p>Fruits, vegetables, nuts, and sweets of all kinds attract the
busy insects, whose sense of discrimination between animal and
vegetable food is so keen that there is reason to believe they are
able to detect animal matter in the smear of a not unclean finger.
When other diets fail they fall back on decayed wood, or rather,
perhaps, the minute forms of life therein, and it has been noticed
that phenomenal activity is aroused when the galleries of white
ants are disturbed, raids of extermination taking place. Several
situations which white ants have been known to retain for years,
the raider now occupies; but it is not an unmixed blessing in a
house, for its bite is hot and continuous. It does not know when to
let go once the tiny mandibles have a good grip.</p>

<p>Bold beyond all reason, the tiny insect does not hesitate to
join issue with interfering man, and occasionally it is prudent for
the flower of creation to retreat.</p>

<p>The other day a bulky rhinoceros beetle, slightly injured by a
bump against a wall, fell on the verandah and lay stunned. The
following morning, near the spot where it lodged stood a mound of
fluff and grains of sand and rubbish, beneath which a horde of ants
worked. In two days all that remained was the shell of the beetle,
which collapsed at the touch! A disabled centipede has no chance
against the hosts of the rovers, and a dog-discarded bone is
whitened in a very brief period.</p>

<p>Such an industrious and thorough scavenger is entitled to some
consideration, though it must be confessed that one would be better
pleased if the little allies in the defence of sweetness kept to
the defence of their wellnigh impregnable native quarters&mdash;the
bush.</p>

<p>Is not life, however, a patchwork of compromises?</p>

<p>And is not the insect that is typical of organized industry
entitled to sufferance, even when it unconsciously mingles pain
with its benefits?</p>
