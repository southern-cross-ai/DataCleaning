<p> </p>

<p>EXTERMINATION</p>

<p> </p>

<p>In this play a reference is made by a Chief of Police to the
political necessity for killing people: a necessity so distressing to
the statesmen and so terrifying to the common citizen that nobody
except myself (as far as I know) has ventured to examine it directly on
its own merits, although every Government is obliged to practise it on
a scale varying from the execution of a single murderer to the
slaughter of millions of quite innocent persons. Whilst assenting to
these proceedings, and even acclaiming and celebrating them, we dare
not tell ourselves what we are doing or why we are doing it; and so we
call it justice or capital punishment or our duty to king and country
or any other convenient verbal whitewash for what we instinctively
recoil from as from a dirty job. These childish evasions are revolting.
We must strip off the whitewash and find out what is really beneath it.
Extermination must be put on a scientific basis if it is ever to be
carried out humanely and apologetically as well as thoroughly.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>KILLING AS A POLITICAL FUNCTION</p>

<p> </p>

<p>That killing is a necessity is beyond question by any thoughtful
person. Unless rabbits and deer and rats and foxes are killed, or "kept
down" as we put it, mankind must perish; and that section of mankind
which lives in the country and is directly and personally engaged in
the struggle with Nature for a living has no sentimental doubts that
they must be killed. As to tigers and poisonous snakes, their
incompatibility with human civilization is unquestioned. This does not
excuse the use of cruel steel traps, agonizing poisons, or packs of
hounds as methods of extermination. Killing can be cruelly or kindly
done; and the deliberate choice of cruel ways, and their organization
as popular pleasures, is sinful; but the sin is in the cruelty and the
enjoyment of it, not in the killing.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>THE SACREDNESS OF HUMAN LIFE</p>

<p> </p>

<p>In law we draw a line between the killing of human animals and
non-human ones, setting the latter apart as brutes. This was founded on
a general belief that humans have immortal souls and brutes none.
Nowadays more and more people are refusing to make this distinction.
They may believe in The Life Everlasting and The Life to Come; but they
make no distinction between Man and Brute, because some of them believe
that brutes have souls, whilst others refuse to believe that the
physical materializations and personifications of The Life Everlasting
are themselves everlasting. In either case the mystic distinction
between Man and Brute vanishes; and the murderer pleading that though a
rabbit should be killed for being mischievous he himself should be
spared because he has an immortal soul and a rabbit has none is as
hopelessly out of date as a gentleman duellist pleading his clergy.
When the necessity for killing a dangerous human being arises, as it
still does daily, the only distinction we make between a man and a
snared rabbit is that we very quaintly provide the man with a minister
of religion to explain to him that we are not killing him at all, but
only expediting his transfer to an eternity of bliss.</p>

<p>The political necessity for killing him is precisely like that for
killing the cobra or the tiger: he is so ferocious or unscrupulous that
if his neighbors do not kill him he will kill or ruin his neighbors; so
that there is nothing for it but to disable him once for all by making
an end of him, or else waste the lives of useful and harmless people in
seeing that he does no mischief, and caging him cruelly like a lion in
a show.</p>

<p>Here somebody is sure to interject that there is the alternative of
teaching him better manners; but I am not here dealing with such cases:
the real necessity arises only in dealing with untameable persons who
are constitutionally unable to restrain their violent or acquisitive
impulses, and have no compunction about sacrificing others to their own
immediate convenience. To punish such persons is ridiculous: we might
as reasonably punish a tile for flying off a roof in a storm and
knocking a clergyman on the head. But to kill them is quite reasonable
and very necessary.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>PRESENT EXTERMINATIONS</p>

<p> </p>

<p>All this so far is mere elementary criminology, already dealt with
very fully by me in my Essay on Prisons, which I recommend to those
readers who may feel impelled to ramble away at this point into the
prosings about Deterrence beloved by our Prison commissioners and
judges. It disposes of the dogma of the unconditional sacredness of
human life, or any other incarnation of life; but it covers only a
corner of the field opened up by modern powers of extermination. In
Germany it is suggested that the Nordic race should exterminate the
Latin race. As both these lingual stocks are hopelessly interbred by
this time, such a sacrifice to ethnological sciolism is not
practicable; but its discussion familiarizes the idea and clears the
way for practicable suggestions. The extermination of whole races and
classes has been not only advocated but actually attempted. The
extirpation of the Jew as such figured for a few mad moments in the
program of the Nazi party in Germany. The extermination of the peasant
is in active progress in Russia, where the extermination of the class
of ladies and gentlemen of so-called independent means has already been
accomplished; and an attempt to exterminate the old Conservative
professional class and the kulak or prosperous farmer class has been
checked only by the discovery that they cannot as yet be done without.
Outside Russia the extermination of Communists is widely advocated; and
there is a movement in the British Empire and the United States for the
extermination of Fascists. In India the impulse of Moslems and Hindus
to exterminate one another is complicated by the impulse of the British
Empire to exterminate both when they happen to be militant
Nationalists.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>PREVIOUS ATTEMPTS MISS THE POINT</p>

<p> </p>

<p>The novelty and significance of these instances consists in the
equal status of the parties. The extermination of what the
exterminators call inferior races is as old as history. "Stone dead
hath no fellow" said Cromwell when he tried to exterminate the Irish.
"The only good nigger is a dead nigger" say the Americans of the
Ku-Klux temperament. "Hates any man the thing he would not kill?" said
Shylock naively. But we white men, as we absurdly call ourselves in
spite of the testimony of our looking glasses, regard all differently
colored folk as inferior species. Ladies and gentlemen class rebellious
laborers with vermin. The Dominicans, the watchdogs of God, regarded
the Albigenses as the enemies of God, just as Torquemada regarded the
Jews as the murderers of God. All that is an old story: what we are
confronted with now is a growing perception that if we desire a certain
type of civilization and culture we must exterminate the sort of people
who do not fit into it. There is a difference between the shooting at
sight of aboriginal natives in the back blocks of Australia and the
massacres of aristocrats in the terror which followed the foreign
attacks on the French Revolution. The Australian gunman pots the
aboriginal natives to satisfy his personal antipathy to a black man
with uncut hair. But nobody in the French Republic had this feeling
about Lavoisier, nor can any German Nazi have felt that way about
Einstein. Yet Lavoisier was guillotined; and Einstein has had to fly
for his life from Germany. It was silly to say that the Republic had no
use for chemists; and no Nazi has stultified his party to the extent of
saying that the new National Socialist Fascist State in Germany has no
use for mathematician-physicists. The proposition is that aristocrats
(Lavoisier's class) and Jews (Einstein's race) are unfit to enjoy the
privilege of living in a modern society founded on definite principles
of social welfare as distinguished from the old promiscuous
aggregations crudely policed by chiefs who had no notion of social
criticism and no time to invent it.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>KING CHARLES'S HEAD</p>

<p> </p>

<p>It was, by the way, the English Revolution which introduced the
category of Malignant or Man of Blood, and killed the King as an
affirmation that even kings must not survive if they are malignant.
This was much more advanced than the execution in the following century
of Louis XVI as an ordinary traitor, or of the Tsar in our own time to
prevent his being captured by the Tchekoslovakian contingent and used
as a standard to rally the royalist reaction. Charles affirmed a divine
personal right to govern as against the parliament and would keep no
bargain with it. Parliament denied his right, and set up against it a
divine right of election winners to govern. They fought it out; and the
victorious election winners exterminated the king, very logically.
Finding that their authority still needed a royal disguise they drove a
hard bargain for a crown with his son, and, after ejecting the next
king who broke it, a still harder one with his Dutch grandson before
they allowed the title of king, with nine tenths of the meaning knocked
out of it, to be used as a matter of convenience again in England.
Nobody had a word to say against Charles's private character. It was
solely for incompatibility of politics that he was eliminated, or
"liquidated" as we say now. There was a real novelty in the
transaction. The Church had for centuries before compelled the secular
State to liquidate heretics; and the slaughter of rebels who tried to
substitute one dynasty for another, or to seize the throne for
themselves, was common routine. But Charles was neither a heretic nor a
rebel. He was the assertor of a divine right to govern without winning
elections; and because that right could not co-exist with the supremacy
of a much richer and more powerful plutocracy off went his head.</p>

<p>Charles was only the first victim. After Culloden the defeated
Highland chiefs and their clansmen were butchered like sheep on the
field. Had they been merely prisoners of war, this would have been
murder. But as they were also Incompatibles with British civilization,
it was only liquidation.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>RIGHT TO EXTERMINATE CONFERRED BY PRIVATE PROPERTY</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Having disposed of the divine right of kings the political
liquidators turned their attention slowly to its derivatory the divine
right of landlords, which had gradually disguised itself as private
property in land. For when a tract of land becomes the private property
of an individual who has to depend on it for his subsistence, the
relation between him and the inhabitants of that tract becomes an
economic one; and if they become economically superfluous or wasteful,
he must exterminate them. This is continually happening wherever
private property in land exists. If I possess land and find it
profitable to grow wheat on it, I need many agricultural laborers to
enable me to do it; and I tolerate their existence accordingly. If I
presently find that it is more profitable to cover my land with sheep
and sell their wool, I have to tolerate the existence of the sheep; but
I no longer need tolerate the existence of the laborers; so I drive
them off my land, which is my legal method of extermination, retaining
only a few to act as shepherds. Later on I find that it is more
profitable to cover my land with wild deer, and collect money from
gentlemen and ladies who enjoy shooting them. I then exterminate my
shepherds and keep only a few gamekeepers. But I may do much better by
letting my land to industrialists for the erection of factories. They
exterminate the sheep and the deer; but they need far more men than I
needed even when I grew wheat. The driven-offs crowd into the factories
and multiply like rabbits; and for the moment population grows instead
of diminishing. But soon machines come along and make millions of
proletarians economically superfluous. The factory owner accordingly
sacks them, which is his legal method of extermination. During these
developments the exterminated, or, as we call them, the evicted and
sacked, try to avoid starvation partly by emigration, but mostly by
offering themselves for all sorts of employment as soldiers, servants,
prostitutes, police officers, scavengers, and operators of the immense
machinery of amusement and protection for the idle rich classes created
by the private property system. By organization in trade unions,
municipal and parliamentary Labor Parties, and the like, and
maintaining a sort of continual civil war consisting of strikes and
riots, they extort from the proprietors enough to reduce the rate of
extermination (shewn by the actuarial expectation of life of the
unpropertied) for periods described as progressive, until the
proprietors, by engaging in suicidal wars, are forced to intensify
their economies, and the rate of extermination rises again.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>DISGUISES UNDER WHICH PRIVATE EXTERMINATION OPERATES</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Note that during all this the Registrar General's returns do not
give us the deaths of the exterminated as such, because the
exterminated do not starve as lost travellers starve in the desert.
Their starvation is more or less protracted; and when the final
catastrophe arrives, it is disguised under an imposing array of
doctors' names for moribundity. The victims die mostly in their first
year, and subsequently at all ages short of the age at which properly
nourished people die. Sometimes they are starved into attaining an age
at which people with well filled pockets eat themselves to death.
Either way and all ways the extermination is a real and permanent
feature of private property civilization, though it is never mentioned
as such, and ladies and gentlemen are carefully educated to be
unconscious of its existence and to talk nonsense about its facts when
they are too obvious or become too scandalous to be ignored, when they
often advocate emigration or Birth Control or war as remedies. And
against the facts there is a chronic humanitarian revolt expressing
itself either underground or overground in revolutionary movements;
making our political constitutions very unstable; and imposing an
habitual disingenuousness on conservative statesmen.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>PRIVATE POWERS OF LIFE AND DEATH</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Now the central fact of all these facts is that the private
proprietors have irresponsible powers of life and death in the State.
Such powers may be tolerated as long as the Government is in effect a
committee of private proprietors; yet if such a committee be widened
into or superseded by a Government acting in the interest of the whole
people, that Government will not suffer any private class to hold the
lives of the citizens at its mercy and thereby become their real
masters. A popular Government, before it fully grasps the situation,
usually begins by attempting to redistribute property in such a manner
as to make everyone a petty proprietor, as in the French Revolution.
But when the impossibility of doing this (except in the special case of
agricultural land) becomes apparent, and the question is probed to the
bottom by unpropertied political philosophers like Proudhon and Marx,
private property is sooner or later excommunicated and abolished; and
what was formerly called "real property" is replaced by ordinary
personal property and common property administrated by the State.</p>

<p>All modern progressive and revolutionary movements are at bottom
attacks on private property. A Chancellor of the Exchequer apologizing
for an increase in the surtax, a Fascist dictator organizing a
Corporate State, a Soviet Commissar ejecting a kulak and adding his
acres to a collective farm, are all running the same race, though all
of them except the Commissar may be extremely reluctant to win it. For
in the long run the power to exterminate is too grave to be left in any
hands but those of a thoroughly Communist Government responsible to the
whole community. The landlord with his writ of ejectment and the
employer with his sack, must finally go the way of the nobleman with
his sword and his benefit of clergy, and of Hannibal Chollop with his
bowie knife and pistol.</p>

<p>Let us then assume that private property, already maimed by factory
legislation, surtax, and a good deal of petty persecution in England,
and in Russia tolerated only provisionally as a disgraceful necessity
pending its complete extirpation, is finally discarded by civilized
communities, and the duty of maintaining it at all costs replaced by
the duty of giving effect to the dogma that every ablebodied and
ableminded and ablesouled person has an absolute right to an equal
share in the national dividend. Would the practice of extermination
thereupon disappear? I suggest that, on the contrary, it might continue
much more openly and intelligently and scientifically than at present,
because the humanitarian revolt against it would probably become a
humanitarian support of it; and there would be an end of the hypocrisy,
the venal special pleading, and the concealment or ignoring of facts
which are imposed on us at present because extermination for the
benefit of a handful of private persons against the interests of the
race is permitted and practised. The old doctrine of the sacredness of
human life, which in our idiot asylums at Darenth and elsewhere still
terrifies us into wasting the lives of capable people in preserving the
lives of monsters, was a crude expedient for beginning civilization. At
present we discard it in dealing with murderers, heretics, traitors,
and (in Scotland) vitriol throwers, who can be legally killed. A
runaway convict can also be summarily shot by a warder to save the
trouble of pursuing and recapturing him; and although the convict is
not under capital sentence and the case is therefore clearly one of
wilful murder, coroners' juries persist in treating it as a harmless
and necessary incident in prison routine.</p>

<p>Unfortunately the whole question is bedevilled by our anti-Christian
vice of punishment, expiation, sacrifice, and all the cognate tribal
superstitions which are hammered into us in our childhood by barbarous
scripturists, irascible or sadist parents, and a hideous criminal code.
When the horrors of anarchy force us to set up laws that forbid us to
fight and torture one another for sport, we still snatch at every
excuse for declaring individuals outside the protection of law and
torturing them to our hearts content.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>CRUELTY'S EXCUSES</p>

<p> </p>

<p>There have been summits of civilization at which heretics like
Socrates, who was killed because he was wiser than his neighbors, have
not been tortured, but ordered to kill themselves in the most painless
manner known to their judges. But from that summit there was a speedy
relapse into our present savagery. For Wallace, whom the Scots adored
as a patriot and the English executed as a traitor, the most cruel and
obscene method of killing that the human imagination could conceive at
its vilest was specially invented to punish him for being a traitor (or
"larn him to be a toad"); and this sentence has been passed, though not
carried out, within the memory of persons now living. John of Leyden,
for being a Communist, was tortured so frightfully before being hung up
in a cage on the church tower to starve to death in sight of all the
citizens and their little children, that the bishop who was officially
obliged to witness it died of horror. Joan of Arc, for wearing men's
clothes and being a Protestant and a witch, was burnt alive, after a
proposal to torture her had been barely defeated. The people who saw
her burnt were quite accustomed to such spectacles, and regarded them
as holiday attractions. A woman's sex was made an excuse for burning
her instead of more mercifully hanging her. Male criminals were broken
on the wheel: that is, battered to death with iron bars, until well
into the nineteenth century. This was a public spectacle; and the
prolongation of the victim's suffering was so elaborately studied and
arranged that Cartouche, one of the kings of scoundrelism, was bribed
to betray his accomplices by the promise that he should be killed by
the sixth blow of the bar. The wheel and the stake have lately gone out
of use; but the Sadist mania for flogging seems ineradicable; for after
a partially successful attempt to discard it in Victorian times it has
revived again with redoubled ferocity: quite recently a criminal was
sentenced to a flogging and ten years penal servitude; and although the
victim escaped his punishment and gave a sensational advertisement to
its savagery by committing suicide, nobody protested, though thirty
years ago there would have been a strenuous outcry against it, raised
by the old Humanitarian League, and voiced in Parliament by the Irish
Nationalists. Alas! the first thing the Irish did when they at last
enjoyed self-government was to get rid of these sentimental
Nationalists and put flogging on their statute book in a series of
Coercion Acts that would have horrified Dublin Castle. In a really
civilized state flogging would cease because it would be impossible to
induce any decent citizen to flog another. Among us a perfectly
respectable official will do it for half a crown, and probably enjoy
the job.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>LEADING CASE OF JESUS CHRIST</p>

<p> </p>

<p>I dislike cruelty, even cruelty to other people, and should
therefore like to see all cruel people exterminated. But I should
recoil with horror from a proposal to punish them. Let me illustrate my
attitude by a very famous, indeed far too famous, example of the
popular conception of criminal law as a means of delivering up victims
to the normal popular lust for cruelty which has been mortified by the
restraint imposed on it by civilization. Take the case of the
extermination of Jesus Christ. No doubt there was a strong case for it.
Jesus was from the point of view of the High Priest a heretic and an
impostor. From the point of view of the merchants he was a rioter and a
Communist. From the Roman Imperialist point of view he was a traitor.
From the commonsense point of view he was a dangerous madman. From the
snobbish point of view, always a very influential one, he was a
penniless vagrant. From the police point of view he was an obstructor
of thoroughfares, a beggar, an associate of prostitutes, an apologist
of sinners, and a disparager of judges; and his daily companions were
tramps whom he had seduced into vagabondage from their regular trades.
From the point of view of the pious he was a Sabbath breaker, a denier
of the efficacy of circumcision and the advocate of a strange rite of
baptism, a gluttonous man and a winebibber. He was abhorrent to the
medical profession as an unqualified practitioner who healed people by
quackery and charged nothing for the treatment. He was not anti-Christ:
nobody had heard of such a power of darkness then; but he was
startlingly anti-Moses. He was against the priests, against the
judiciary, against the military, against the city (he declared that it
was impossible for a rich man to enter the kingdom of heaven), against
all the interests, classes, principalities and powers, inviting
everybody to abandon all these and follow him. By every argument,
legal, political, religious, customary, and polite, he was the most
complete enemy of the society of his time ever brought to the bar. He
was guilty on every count of the indictment, and on many more that his
accusers had not the wit to frame. If he was innocent then the whole
world was guilty. To acquit him was to throw over civilization and all
its institutions. History has borne out the case against him; for no
State has ever constituted itself on his principles or made it possible
to live according to his commandments: those States who have taken his
name have taken it as an alias to enable them to persecute his
followers more plausibly.</p>

<p>It is not surprising that under these circumstances, and in the
absence of any defence, the Jerusalem community and the Roman
government decided to exterminate Jesus. They had just as much right to
do so as to exterminate the two thieves who perished with him. But
there was neither right nor reason in torturing him. He was entitled to
the painless death of Socrates. We may charitably suppose that if the
death could have been arranged privately between Pilate and Caiaphas
Jesus would have been dispatched as quickly and suddenly as John the
Baptist. But the mob wanted the horrible fun of seeing somebody
crucified: an abominably cruel method of execution. Pilate only made
matters worse by trying to appease them by having Jesus flogged. The
soldiers, too, had to have their bit of sport, to crown him with thorns
and, when they buffeted him, challenge him ironically to guess which of
them had struck the blow.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>"CROSSTIANITY"</p>

<p> </p>

<p>All this was cruelty for its own sake, for the pleasure of it. And
the fun did not stop there. Such was and is the attraction of these
atrocities that the spectacle of them has been reproduced in pictures
and waxworks and exhibited in churches ever since as an aid to piety.
The chief instrument of torture is the subject of a special Adoration.
Little models of it in gold and ivory are worn as personal ornaments;
and big reproductions in wood and marble are set up in sacred places
and on graves. Contrasting the case with that of Socrates, one is
forced to the conclusion that if Jesus had been humanely exterminated
his memory would have lost ninetynine per cent of its attraction for
posterity. Those who were specially susceptible to his morbid
attraction were not satisfied with symbolic crosses which hurt nobody.
They soon got busy with "acts of faith" which consisted of great public
shows at which Jews and Protestants or Catholics, and anyone else who
could be caught out on a point of doctrine, were burnt alive. Cruelty
is so infectious that the very compassion it rouses is infuriated to
take revenge by still viler cruelties.</p>

<p>The tragedy of this--or, if you will, the comedy--is that it was his
clearness of vision on this very point that set Jesus so high above his
persecutors. He taught that two blacks do not make a white; that evil
should not be countered by worse evil but by good; that revenge and
punishment only duplicate wrong; that we should conceive God, not as an
irascible and vindictive tyrant but as an affectionate father. No doubt
many private amiabilities have been inspired by this teaching; but
politically it has received no more quarter than Pilate gave it. To all
Governments it has remained paradoxical and impracticable. A typical
acknowledgement of it was the hanging of a crucifix above the seat of
the judge who was sentencing evildoers to be broken on the wheel.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>CHRISTIANITY AND THE SIXTH COMMANDMENT</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Now it is not enough to satirize this. We must examine why it
occurred. It is not enough to protest that evildoers must not be paid
in their own coin by treating them as cruelly as they have treated
others. We still have to stop the mischief they do. What is to be done
with them? It is easy to suggest that they should be reformed by
gentleness and shamed by non-resistance. By all means, if they respond
to that treatment. But if gentleness fails to reform them and
non-resistance encourages them to further aggression, what then? A
month spent in a Tolstoyan community will convince anybody of the
soundness of the nearest police inspector's belief that every normal
human group contains not only a percentage of saints but also a
percentage of irreclaimable scoundrels and good-for-noughts who will
wreck any community unless they are expensively restrained or cheaply
exterminated. Our Mosaic system of vindictive punishment, politely
called "retributory" by Prison Commissioners, disposes of them
temporarily; but it wastes the lives of honest citizens in guarding
them; sets a horrible example of cruelty and malicious injury; costs a
good deal of money that might be better spent; and, after all, sooner
or later lets the scoundrel loose again to recommence his depredations.
It would be much more sensible and less cruel to treat him as we treat
mad dogs or adders, without malice or cruelty, and without reference to
catalogues of particular crimes. The notion that persons should be safe
from extermination as long as they do not commit wilful murder, or levy
war against the Crown, or kidnap, or throw vitriol, is not only to
limit social responsibility unnecessarily, and to privilege the large
range of intolerable misconduct that lies outside them, but to divert
attention from the essential justification for extermination, which is
always incorrigible social incompatibility and nothing else.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>THE RUSSIAN EXPERIMENT</p>

<p> </p>

<p>The only country which has yet awakened to this extension of social
responsibility is Russia. When the Soviet Government undertook to
change over from Capitalism to Communism it found itself without any
instruments for the maintenance of order except a list of crimes and
punishments administered through a ritual of criminal law. And in the
list of crimes the very worst offences against Communist society had no
place: on the contrary they were highly honored and rewarded. As our
English doggerel runs, the courts could punish a man for stealing the
goose from off the common, but not the man who stole the common from
the goose. The idler, that common enemy of mankind who robs everybody
all the time, though he is so carefully protected from having his own
pocket picked, incurred no penalty, and had actually passed the most
severe laws against any interference with his idling. It was the
business of the Soviet to make all business public business and all
persons public servants; but the view of the ordinary Russian citizen
was that a post in a public service was an exceptional stroke of good
luck for the holder because it was a sinecure carrying with it the
privilege of treating the public insolently and extorting bribes from
it. For example, when the Russian railways were communized, some of the
local stationmasters interpreted the change as meaning that they might
now be as lazy and careless as they pleased, whereas in fact it was of
life-or-death importance that they should redouble their activity and
strain every nerve to make the service efficient. The unfortunate
Commissar who was Minister of Transport found himself obliged to put a
pistol in his pocket and with his own hand shoot stationmasters who had
thrown his telegrams into the dustbin instead of attending to them, so
that he might the more impressively ask the rest of the staff whether
they yet grasped the fact that orders are meant to be executed.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>INADEQUACY OF PENAL CODES</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Now being Minister of Transport, or Minister of any other public
service, is a whole time job: it cannot be permanently combined with
that of amateur executioner, carrying with it the reputation in all the
capitalist papers of the west of being a ferocious and coldblooded
murderer. And no conceivable extension of the criminal code nor of the
service disciplines, with their lists of specific offences and specific
penalties, could have provided for instant exemplary exterminations of
this kind, any more than for the growing urgency of how to dispose of
people who would not or could not fit themselves into the new order of
things by conforming to its new morality. It would have been easy to
specify certain offences and certain penalties in the old fashion: as,
for instance, if you hoard money you will be shot; if you speculate in
the difference in purchasing power of the rouble in Moscow and Berlin
you will be shot; if you buy at the Co-operative to sell at the private
trader's shop you will be shot; if you take bribes you will be shot; if
you falsify farm or factory balance sheets you will be shot; if you
exploit labor you will be shot; and it will be useless to plead that
you have been brought up to regard these as normal business activities,
and that the whole of respectable society outside Russia agrees with
you. But the most elaborate code of this sort would still have left
unspecified a hundred ways in which wreckers of Communism could have
sidetracked it without ever having to face the essential questions: are
you pulling your weight in the social boat? are you giving more trouble
than you are worth? have you earned the privilege of living in a
civilized community? That is why the Russians were forced to set up an
Inquisition or Star Chamber, called at first the Cheka and now the Gay
Pay Oo (Ogpu), to go into these questions and "liquidate" persons who
could not answer them satisfactorily. The security against the abuse of
this power of life and death was that the Cheka had no interest in
liquidating anybody who could be made publicly useful, all its
interests being in the opposite direction.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>LIMITED LIABILITY IN MORALS</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Such a novelty is extremely terrifying to us, who are still working
on a system of limited liability in morals. Our "free" British citizens
can ascertain exactly what they may do and what they may not do if they
are to keep out of the hands of the police. Our financiers know that
they must not forge share certificates nor overstate their assets in
the balance sheets they send to their shareholders. But provided they
observe a few conditions of this kind they are free to enter upon a
series of quite legitimate but not the less nefarious operations. For
example, making a corner in wheat or copper or any other cornerable
commodity and forcing up prices so as to make enormous private fortunes
for themselves, or making mischief between nations through the Press to
stimulate the private trade in armaments. Such limited liability no
longer exists in Russia, and is not likely to exist in the future in
any highly civilized state. It may be quite impossible to convict a
forestaller or regrator under a criminal code of having taken a single
illegal step, but quite easy to convince any reasonable body of judges
that he is what the people call "a wrong one." In Russia such a
conviction would lead to his disappearance and the receipt by his
family of a letter to say that they need not wait up for him, as he
would not return home any more.* In our country he would enjoy his
gains in high honor and personal security, and thank his stars that he
lived in a free country and not in Communist Russia.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>* Note, however, that a sentence of extermination should never be so
certain as to make it worth the delinquent's while to avoid arrest by
murdering his or her pursuers.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>But as the new tribunal has been forced on Russia by pressure of
circumstances and not planned and thought out at leisure, the two
institutions, the Ogpu and the ordinary police administering the
criminal code, work side by side, with the odd result that the surest
way to escape the Ogpu is to commit an ordinary crime and take refuge
in the arms of the police and the magistrate, who cannot exterminate
you because capital punishment has been abolished in Russia
(liquidation by the Ogpu is not punishment: it is only "weeding the
garden"); and the sentence of imprisonment, though it may seem severe
to us in view of the cruelty of our treatment of criminals, will be
carried out with comparative leniency, and probably, if the culprit
behaves well be remitted after a while. As four years imprisonment is
considered enough for any reasonable sort of murder, a cornerer who
finds himself in imminent danger of detection and liquidation by the
Ogpu would be well advised to lose his temper and murder his
mother-in-law, thereby securing a lease of life for at least four
years.</p>

<p>Sooner or later this situation will have to be thoroughly studied
and thought out to its logical conclusion in all civilized countries.
The lists of crimes and penalties will obsolesce like the doctors'
lists of diseases and medicines; and it will become possible to be a
judge without ceasing to be a Christian. And extermination, my present
subject, will become a humane science instead of the miserable mixture
of piracy, cruelty, vengeance, race conceit, and superstition it now
is.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>NATURAL LIMIT TO EXTERMINATION</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Fortunately the more frankly and realistically it is faced the more
it detaches itself from the associations with crude slaughter which now
make it terrible. When Charlemagne founded the Holy Roman Empire (as
far as anyone can be said to have founded it) he postulated that all
its subjects must be Catholic Christians, and made an amateurish
attempt to secure this condition of social stability by killing
everyone who fell into his power and refused to be baptized. But he
cannot ever have got very far with it, because there is one sort of
bird you must not kill on any pretext whatever: namely, the goose that
lays the golden eggs. In Russia the Soviet Government began by a
Charlemagnesque attempt to exterminate the bourgeoisie by classing them
as intelligentsia, restricting their rations, and putting their
children at the foot of the overcrowded educational list. They also
proscribed the kulak, the able, hardheaded, hardfisted farmer who was
richer than his neighbors and liked to see them poorer than himself.
Him they rudely took by the shoulders and threw destitute into the
lane. There were plausible reasons for this beginning of selection in
population; for the moral outlook of the bourgeoisie and the kulaks was
dangerously antisocial. But the results were disastrous. The
bourgeoisie contained the professional class and the organizing
business class. Without professional men and business organizers
nothing could be done in the industries; and the hope that picked
members of the proletariat could take up professional and organizing
work on the strength of their native talent in sufficient numbers was
crushingly disappointed. When the kulak was thrown out of his farm, and
his farming ability paralyzed, food ran short. Very soon the kulak had
to be thrown back into his farm and told to carry on until his hour had
come; and a pleasant convention was established whereby all educated
persons, however obviously ladies or gentlemen, who were willing to
assure the authorities that their fathers had "worked on the land with
their hands" were accepted as genuine proletarians, and transferred
from the infamous category of intelligentsia to the honourable one of
"the intellectual proletariat." Even Lenin and his colleagues, all
ultra-bourgeois (otherwise they would never have so absurdly
overestimated the intellectual resources of the proletariat and been so
contemptuous of the pretension of their own class to be indispensable),
allowed their parents to be described as hornyhanded cultivators of the
soil. The pretence has now become a standing joke; but you will still
come up against it if you accuse any Russian of being a lady or
gentleman.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>INCOMPATIBILITY OF PEASANTRY WITH MODERN CIVILIZATION</p>

<p> </p>

<p>These, however, are merely expedients of transition. The Russian
proletariat is now growing its own professional and organizing class;
and the ex-bourgeois is dying out, after seeing his children receive a
sound Communist education and being lectured by them on his
oldfashioned prejudices. And the planners of the Soviet State have no
time to bother about moribund questions; for they are confronted with
the new and overwhelming necessity for exterminating the peasants, who
still exist in formidable numbers. The notion that a civilized State
can be made out of any sort of human material is one of our old Radical
delusions. As to building Communism with such trash as the Capitalist
system produces it is out of the question. For a Communist Utopia we
need a population of Utopians; and Utopians do not grow wild on the
bushes nor are they to be picked up in the slums: they have to be
cultivated very carefully and expensively. Peasants will not do; yet
without the peasants the Communists could never have captured the
Russian Revolution. Nominally it was the Soviets of peasants and
soldiers who backed Lenin and saved Communism when all Western Europe
set on him like a pack of hounds on a fox. But as all the soldiers were
peasants, and all the peasants hungry for property, the military
element only added to the peasants' cry of Give us land, the soldiers'
cry of Give us peace. Lenin said, in effect, Take the land; and if
feudally minded persons obstruct you, exterminate them; but do not burn
their houses, as you will need them to live in. And it was the
resultant legions of petty landed proprietors that made Lenin's
position impregnable, and provided Trotsky and Stalin with the Red
soldiers who defeated the counter-revolutionists of 1918. For the
counter-revolution, in which we, to our eternal shame, took part
(England sets the example of revolution and then attacks all other
countries which presume to follow it), meant bringing the old landlords
back; and the peasant fought against that as the mercenaries and
conscripts of the Capitalist armies would not fight in favour of
it.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>A PEASANT VICTORY IS A VICTORY FOR PRIVATE PROPERTY</p>

<p> </p>

<p>So far so good for Lenin; but the war against the
counter-revolutionists, when it ended in victory for the peasant
proprietor, was really a victory for private property, and was
therefore succeeded by a fiercer struggle between the fanatically
Communist Government and the fiercely individualist peasant proprietor,
who wanted the produce of his plot for himself, and had no notion of
pooling it with anybody, least of all with the urban proletarians who
seemed like another species to him. Left to themselves the moujiks
would have reproduced Capitalist civilization at its American worst in
ten years. Thus the most urgent task before the victorious Communist
Government was the extermination of the moujik; and yet the moujik,
being still the goose that laid the golden eggs, could not be
exterminated summarily without incidentally exterminating the whole
Russian nation.</p>

<p>The way out of this deadlock was obvious enough, though very
expensive and tedious. You can exterminate any human class not only by
summary violence but by bringing up its children to be different. In
the case of the Russian peasantry the father lives in a lousy kennel,
at no man's call but his own, and extracts a subsistence by primitive
methods from a strip of land on which a tractor could hardly turn even
if he could afford such a luxury, but which is his very own. His book
is a book of Nature, from which all wisdom can be gathered by those who
have been taught to read it by due practice on printed books; but he
has not been so practised, and for cultural purposes has to be classed
as ignorant, though he knows things that university professors do not
know. He is brutalized by excessive muscular labor; he is dirty; his
freedom from civilized control leaves him so unprotected from the
tyranny of Nature that it becomes evident to his children that the
highly regulated people in the nearest collectivist farm, where
thousands of acres are cultivated by dozens of tractors, and nobody can
put his foot on one of the acres or his hand on one of the tractors and
say "This is my own to do what I like with," are better fed and housed,
nicer, and much more leisured, and consequently free, than he ever
is.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>PREVENTIVE EXTERMINATION: ITS DIFFICULTIES</p>

<p> </p>

<p>In short, you exterminate the peasant by bringing up his children to
be scientifically mechanized farmers and to live a collegiate life in
cultivated society. It sounds simple; but the process requires better
planning than is always forthcoming (with local famines and revolts as
the penalty); for while the grass grows the steed starves; and when
education means not only schools and teachers, but giant collective
farms equipped with the most advanced agricultural machinery, which
means also gigantic engineering works for the production of the
machinery, you may easily find that you have spent too much on these
forms of capitalization and are running short of immediately consumable
goods, presenting the spectacle of the nation with the highest level of
general culture running short of boots and tightening its belt for lack
of sufficient food.</p>

<p>I must not suggest that this has occurred all over Russia; for I saw
no underfed people there; and the children were remarkably plump. And I
cannot trust the reports; for I have no sooner read in The Times a
letter from Mr Kerensky assuring me that in the Ukraine the starving
people are eating one another, than M. Herriot, the eminent French
statesman, goes to Russia and insists on visiting the Ukraine so that
he may have ocular proof of the alleged cannibalism, but can find no
trace of it. Still, between satiety and starvation mitigated by
cannibalism there are many degrees of shortage; and it is no secret
that the struggle of the Russian Government to provide more collective
farms and more giant factories to provide agricultural machinery for
them has to be carried on against a constant clamor from the workers
for new boots and clothes, and more varied food and more of it: in
short, less sacrifice of the present to the future. As Stalin said
quaintly "They will be demanding silver watches next." The constant
correction of the inevitable swerves towards one extreme or the other,
analogous to the control of the Bank rate by the Bank of England (only
enormously more laborious), strains all the wit and industry of the
Russian rulers; and occasional sideslips must be inevitable during
these years when the ablest and oldest Communists are still
learners.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>TEMPERAMENTAL DIFFICULTIES</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Even when the extinction of the bourgeoisie and the kulaks and the
old aristocracy is complete, and the Russian population consists of
citizens educated as Communists, there will still be questions to
settle which are bottom questions as to the sort of civilization that
is desirable; and this involves a decision as to the sort of people
that are desirable and undesirable. Some of us, believing that a more
primitive life than ours would be happier and better, advocate "a
return to nature." Others dream of a much more mechanized, specialized,
and complicated life. Some of us value machinery because it makes a
shorter working day possible for us: others value it because it
enriches us by increasing the product per hour. Some of us would like
to take things easy and retire at 60: others would like to work their
utmost and retire at 40. Some of us will say Let us be content with
&pound;200 a year: others No: let us live at the rate of &pound;20,000
a year and strain every faculty to earn it. Some of us want a minimum
of necessary work and a maximum of liberty to think and discover and
experiment in the extension of science and art, philosophy and
religion, sport and exploration: others, caring for none of these
things, and desiring nothing more than to be saved the trouble of
thinking and to be told what to do at every turn, would prefer
thoughtless and comfortable tutelage and routine, not knowing what to
do with themselves when at liberty. A life filled with scientific
curiosity would be hell for the people who would not cross the street
to find out whether the earth is flat or round; and a person with no
ear for music would strenuously object to work for the support of
municipal bands, whilst people of Shakespear's tastes would agitate for
the extermination of the unmusical.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>IMPORTANCE OF LAZINESS FOR FALLOWING</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Some of these differences could be settled on give-and-take lines.
The division of society into classes with different tastes and
capacities--different natures, as folks call it--would not shake social
stability provided everyone had an equal share of the national
dividend. It is not true that it takes all sorts to make a world; for
there are some sorts that would destroy any world very soon if they
were suffered to live and have their way; but it is true that in the
generations of men continuous high cultivation is not expedient; there
must be fallows, or at least light croppings, between the intense
cultivations; for we cannot expect the very energetic and vital
Napoleon to be the son of an equally energetic father or the father of
an equally vital son. Nobody has yet calculated how many lazy ancestors
it takes to produce an indefatigable prodigy; but it is certain that
dynasties of geniuses do not occur, and that this is the decisive
objection to hereditary rulers (though not, let me hasten to add, to
hereditary figure heads). There is a large field for toleration here:
the clever people must suffer fools gladly, and the easygoing ones find
out how to keep the energetic ones busy. There may be as good
biological reasons for the existence of the workshy as of the workmad.
Even one and the same person may have spells of intense activity and
slackness varying from weeks to years.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>STANDARD RELIGION INDISPENSABLE</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Nevertheless there will be conflicts to the death in the creation of
artificial humanity. There is nothing that can be changed more
completely than human nature when the job is taken in hand early
enough. Such artificial products as our agricultural laborers and urban
mechanics, our country gentlemen and city plutocrats, though they are
from the same human stock, are so different that they cannot live
together without great discomfort, and are practically not
intermarriageable. It is possible to get rid of their social
incompatibility by giving them all the same education and income, and
ranking them all in the same class. For example, Lord Lonsdale is not
in the least socially incompatible with Dean Inge, though a really
critical naturalist would as soon class Shetland ponies with zebras as
lump these two gentlemen under the same heading. But the question
remains, what is this same education to be? The training of the scholar
and the sportsman may split and diverge as they adolesce; but they must
start from a common training and a common morality as children. And
when the state has to prescribe a uniform moral curriculum the variety
of our temperaments makes it impossible to please everybody. The Quaker
and the Ritualist, the Fundamentalist and the Freethinker, the
Vegetarian and the flesh eater, the missionary and the cannibal, the
humanitarian and the sportsman-hunter, the military terrorist and the
Christian, will not agree as to the faiths and habits to be inculcated
upon the children of the community in order that they may be good
citizens. Each temperament will demand the extermination of the other
through the schools and nurseries, and the establishment of its
temperamental faith and habits as standard in these factories of future
citizens. All will agree to exterminate illiteracy by compulsory
reading, writing, and arithmetic: indeed they have already done so. But
all will not agree on a standard religion. Yet a standard religion is
indispensable, however completely it may shed the old theologies. Every
attempt to banish religion from the schools proves that in this respect
Nature abhors a vacuum, and that the community must make up its mind,
or have its mind made up for it by its official thinkers, as to what
its children are to be taught to believe and how they should be trained
to behave. Compromise is ruled out by the nature of the case. What
compromise is possible between myself, for instance, who believe in the
religion of Creative Evolution, the economics of Socialism, and a diet
from which the dead bodies of men, fish, fowls, and animals are rigidly
excluded, and my Fundamentalist neighbors who believe that all
Evolutionists go to hell; that children languish and die without
beefsteaks; and that without private property civilization must perish?
We cannot exterminate oneanother at present; but the time cannot be
very far off when the education authorities will have to consider which
set of beliefs is the better qualification for citizenship in
Utopia.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>ECLECTIC RELIGIONS</p>

<p> </p>

<p>They will probably pigeon-hole both, and proceed eclectically to
compile several creeds suitable to the several capacities and ages of
the children. For there is clearly no sense in offering the religion of
a mature and scholarly philosopher to a child of five, nor attempting
to bring the cosmogonies of Dante and Aquinas, Hegel and Marx, within
the comprehension of a village dunce. Nurses rule their little charges
by threatening them with bogies in whose existence no nurse believes,
exactly as Mahomet ruled his Arabs by promises of a paradise and
threats of a hell the details of which he must have known to be his own
invention even if he did believe generally in a post mortem life of
rewards and punishments for conduct in this world. Therefore I do not
suggest that the education authorities in Utopia will seek for absolute
truth in order to inculcate it though the heavens fall. Nor do I advise
a return to Queen Elizabeth's plan of 39 Articles to please everybody
by alternately affirming and denying all the disputed beliefs. The
likeliest outcome is an elaborate creed of useful illusions, to be
discarded bit by bit as the child is promoted from standard to standard
or form to form, except such of them as adults may be allowed to
comfort themselves with for the sake of the docility they produce.</p>

<p>There would be nothing new in this: it is what our authorities do at
present, except that they do it unsystematically and unconsciously,
being mostly more or less duped themselves by the illusions.
Unfortunately they allow the illusions to fall behind the times and
become incredible, at which point they become exceedingly dangerous;
for when people are brought up on creeds which they cannot believe,
they are left with no creeds at all, and are apt to buy pistols and
take to banditry bag snatching and racketeering when employment fails
and they find themselves short of money. It is the importance of
keeping our inculcated illusions up to date that throws our higher
professional classes into wild alarm when the individual liberty of
thought, speech, and conscience which they think they possess (this is
one of their inculcated illusions) is threatened by the dictatorships
which are springing up all over the world as our pseudo-democratic
parliamentary institutions reduce themselves more and more disastrously
to absurdity.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>IMPORTANCE OF FREE THOUGHT</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Let me try to straighten this out for them. It was very generally
believed as lately as in Victorian times that religious education
consisted in imparting to children certain eternal, final, and absolute
truths. I, for instance, being the son of an Irish Protestant
gentleman, found myself, at the dawn of my infant conscience,
absolutely convinced that all Roman Catholics go to hell when they die,
a conviction which involved not only a belief in the existence of hell
but a whole series of implications as to the nature and character of
God. Now that I am older I cannot regard this as anything more than a
provisional hypothesis which, on consideration, I must definitely
reject. As the more pious of my uncles would have put it, I have lost
my religious faith and am in peril of damnation as an Apostate. But I
do not present my creed of Creative Evolution as anything more than
another provisional hypothesis. It differs from the old Dublin
brimstone creed solely in its greater credibility: that is, its more
exact conformity to the facts alleged by our scientific workers, who
have somehow won that faith in their infallibility formerly enjoyed by
our priests. No future education authority, unless it is as badly
educated as our present ones, will imagine that it has any final and
eternal truths to inculcate: it can only select the most useful working
hypotheses and inculcate them very much as it inculcates standard
behaviour throughout that vast field of civilized conduct in which it
does not matter in the least how people act in particular situations
provided they all act in the same way, as in the rule of the road. All
the provisional hypotheses may be illusions; but if they conduce to
beneficial conduct they must be inculcated and acted on by Governments
until better ones arrive.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>TOLERATION MOSTLY ILLUSORY</p>

<p> </p>

<p>But, cry the professors, are the hypotheses never to be questioned?
Is disillusion to be punished as a crime? That will always depend a
good deal on circumstances. One of the best religious brains in England
has said that the war of 1914-18 was foolish and unnecessary; and
nobody now dreams of prosecuting him; but he would not have been
allowed to go through the trenches from platoon to platoon saying so
just before zero hour, with or without the addition "Sirs, ye are
brethren: why do ye wrong one to another?" I have no illusion of being
free to say and write what I please. I went round the world lately
preaching that if Russia were thrust back from Communism into
competitive Capitalism, and China developed into a predatory Capitalist
State, either independently or as part of a Japanese Asiatic hegemony,
all the western States would have to quintuple their armies and lie
awake at nights in continual dread of hostile aeroplanes, the obvious
moral being that whether we choose Communism for ourselves or not, it
is our clear interest, even from the point of view of our crudest and
oldest militarist diplomacy, to do everything in our power to sustain
Communism in Russia and extend it in China, where at present provinces
containing at the least of many conflicting estimates eighteen millions
of people, have adopted it. Now I was not physically prevented from
saying this, nor from writing and printing it. But in a western world
suffering badly from Marxphobia, and frantically making itself worse
like a shrew in a bad temper, I could not get a single newspaper to
take up my point or report my utterance. When I say anything silly, or
am reported as saying anything reactionary, it runs like wildfire
through the Press of the whole world. When I say anything that could
break the carefully inculcated popular faith in Capitalism the silence
is so profound as to be almost audible. I do not complain, because I do
not share the professorial illusion that there is any more freedom for
disillusionists in the British Empire and the United States of North
America than in Italy, Germany, and Russia. I have seen too many
newspapers suppressed and editors swept away, not only in Ireland and
India but in London in my time, to be taken in by Tennyson's notion
that we live in a land where a man can say the thing he will. There is
no such country. But this is no excuse for the extravagances of
censorship indulged in by jejune governments of revolutionists, and by
Churches who imagine they possess the eternal truth about everything,
to say nothing of hereditary autocrats who conceive that they are so by
divine right. Our papers are silent about the suppression of liberty in
Imperialist Japan, though in Japan it is a crime to have "dangerous
thoughts." In my native Ireland, now nominally a Free State, one of my
books is on the index; and I have no doubt all the rest will follow as
soon as the clerical censorship discovers their existence. In Austria
my chronicle play St Joan had to be altered to please Catholic
authorities who know much less about Catholicism than I do. In America
books which can be bought anywhere in Europe are forbidden. The
concentration of British and American attention on the intolerances of
Fascism and Communism creates an illusion that they do not exist
elsewhere; but they exist everywhere, and must be met, not with
ridiculous hotheaded attacks on Germany, Italy, and Russia, but by a
restatement of the case for Toleration in general.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>LEADING CASES: SOCRATES AND JESUS</p>

<p> </p>

<p>It is a historical misfortune that the most world-famous victims of
persecution made no valid defence. Socrates and Jesus are the most
talked of in Christian countries. Socrates at his trial was in full
possession of his faculties, and was allowed to say everything he had
to say in his defence; but instead of defending his right to criticize
he infuriated his accusers by launching at them a damning contrast
between their infamous corruption and mendacity and his own upright
disinterestedness and blameless record as citizen and soldier. Jesus
made no defence at all. He did not regard himself as a prisoner being
tried for a vulgar offence and using all his wit to escape
condemnation. He believed that he was going through a sacrificial rite
in which he should be slain, after which he should rise from the dead
and come again in glory to establish his kingdom on earth for ever. It
does not matter to our present purpose whether this was the delusion of
a madman or a hard and holy fact: in either case the question of
toleration was not at issue for him; therefore he did not raise it.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>THE CASE OF GALILEO</p>

<p> </p>

<p>In the epoch which Jesus inaugurated, or at least in which his name
was habitually taken in vain, we have Joan of Arc and John of Leyden,
Giordano Bruno and Galileo, Servetus and John Hus and the heroes of
Foxe's Book of Martyrs standing out in our imagination from thousands
of forgotten martyrdoms. Galileo is a favoured subject with our
scientists; but they miss the point because they think that the
question at issue at his trial was whether the earth went round the sun
or was the stationary centre round which the sun circled. Now that was
not the issue. Taken by itself it was a mere question of physical fact
without any moral significance, and therefore no concern of the Church.
As Galileo was not burnt and certainly not abhorred, it is quite
credible that both his immediate judges and the Pope believed with at
least half their minds that he was right about the earth and the sun.
But what they had to consider was whether the Christian religion, on
which to the best of their belief not only the civilization of the
world but its salvation depended, and which had accepted the Hebrew
scriptures and the Greek testament as inspired revelations, could stand
the shock of the discovery that many of its tales, from the tactics of
Joshua in the battle of Gibeon to the Ascension, must have been written
by somebody who did not know what the physical universe was really
like. I am quite familiar with the pre-Galileo universe of the Bible
and St Augustine. As a child I thought of the earth as being an immense
ground floor with a star studded ceiling which was the floor of heaven,
and a basement which was hell. That Jesus should be taken up into the
clouds as the shortest way to heaven seemed as natural to me as that,
at the Opera, Mephistopheles should come up from hell through a trap in
the floor. But if instead of telling me that Jesus was taken up into
the clouds and that the disciples saw him no more, which still makes me
feel quite holy, you tell me that he went up like a balloon into the
stratosphere, I do not feel holy: I laugh obstreperously. The exalting
vision has suddenly become a ribald joke. That is what the Church
feared; and that is what has actually happened. Is it any wonder that
the Pope told Galileo that he really must keep his discoveries to
himself, and that Galileo consented to deny them? Possibly it was the
Pope who, to console him, whispered "E pur se muove."</p>

<p> </p>

<p>FIGMENT OF THE SELFREGARDING ACTION</p>

<p> </p>

<p>St Joan did not claim toleration: she was so far from believing in
it that she wanted to lead a crusade of extermination against the
Husites, though she was burnt for sharing their heresy. That is how all
the martyrs have missed the point of their defence. They all claimed to
possess absolute truth as against the error of their persecutors, and
would have considered it their duty to persecute for its sake if they
had had the power. Real toleration: the toleration of error and
falsehood, never occurred to them as a principle possible for any sane
government. And so they have left us no model defence. And there is no
modern treatise known to me which quite supplies this need. Stuart
Mill's Essay on Liberty satisfied the nineteenth century, and was my
own first textbook on the subject; but its conclusion that
selfregarding actions should not be interfered with by the authorities
carries very little weight for socialists who perceive that in a
complex modern civilization there are no purely selfregarding actions
in the controversial sphere. The color of a man's braces or a woman's
garters may concern the wearers alone; but people have never been burnt
for wearing black underclothes instead of white; and the notion that
preaching a sermon or publishing a pamphlet can be classed as a
selfregarding action is manifestly absurd. All great Art and Literature
is propaganda. Most certainly the heresies of Galileo were not
selfregarding actions: his feat of setting the earth rolling was as
startling as Joshua's feat of making the sun stand still. The Church's
mistake was not in interfering with his liberty, but in imagining that
the secret of the earth's motion could be kept, and fearing that
religion could not stand the shock of its disclosure, or a thousand
such. It was idiotic to try to adapt Nature to the Church instead of
continually adapting the Church to Nature by changing its teaching on
physical matters with every advance made in our knowledge of Nature. In
treating the legend of Joshua's victory as a religious truth instead of
insisting that it did not make the smallest difference to religion
whether Joshua was any more real than Jack the Giant Killer, and that
Galileo might play skittles with the whole solar system without moving
the Eternal Throne and the Papal Chair which was its visible tangible
symbol on earth a single inch, it lost a great opportunity, as it has
since lost many others, leaving itself open to the reproach of
stupidity in not understanding Galileo's argument, of pride in not
having humility enough to admit that it had been wrong in its
astronomy, and of feebleness of faith and confusion of the temporal
with the spiritual as aforesaid, laying itself open to much damaging
Protestant and scientific disparagement, both mostly open to precisely
the same reproaches.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>INCOMPLETENESS OF THE GREAT TRIALS</p>

<p> </p>

<p>No doubt Galileo missed the real point at issue as completely as
Socrates or Jesus. For this we need not blame him: he was a physicist
and not a politician; and to him the only questions at issue were
whether the earth moved or not, and whether a ten pound cannon ball
would fall twice as fast as a five pound one or only just as fast and
no faster. But Socrates was by vocation and habit a solver of problems
of conduct, both personal and political; and Jesus, who had spent his
life in propounding the most staggering paradoxes on the same subject,
not by any means always in the abstract, but as personal directions to
his followers, must, if he had any sense of moral responsibility, have
been challenged by his own conscience again and again as to whether he
had any right to set men on a path which was likely to lead the best of
them to the cross and the worst of them to the moral destruction
described by St Augustine. No man could expressly admit that his word
would bring not peace but a sword without having satisfied himself that
he was justified in doing so. He must have been told as frequently as I
have been told that he was giving pain to many worthy people; and even
with the fullest allowance for the strain of impishness with which the
Life Force endows those of us who are destined by it to
<i>&eacute;pater le bourgeois,</i> he cannot have believed that the
mere satisfaction of this Punchesque <i>Schadenfreude</i> could justify
him in hurting anyone's feelings. What, then, would have been his
defence if, at his trial, he had been his old self, defending himself
as an accused man threatened with a horrible penalty, instead of a god
going through an inevitable ordeal as a prelude to the establishment of
his kingdom on earth?</p>

<p> </p>

<p>A MODERN PASSION PLAY IMPOSSIBLE</p>

<p> </p>

<p>The question is of such importance at the present crisis, when the
kingdoms are breaking up, and upstart rulers are sowing their wild oats
by such grotesque persecutions that Galileo's great successor Einstein
is a plundered fugitive from officially threatened extermination, that
I must endeavor to dramatize the trial of Jesus as it might have
proceeded had it taken place before Peter uttered his momentous
exclamation "Thou art the Christ." I have been asked repeatedly to
dramatize the Gospel story, mostly by admirers of my dramatization of
the trial of St Joan. But the trial of a dumb prisoner, at which the
judge who puts the crucial question to him remains unanswered, cannot
be dramatized unless the judge is to be the hero of the play. Now
Pilate, though perhaps a trifle above the average of colonial
governors, is not a heroic figure. Joan tackled her judges valiantly
and wittily: her trial was a drama ready made, only needing to be
brought within theatrical limits of time and space to be a thrilling
play. But Jesus would not defend himself. It was not that he had not a
word to say for himself, nor that he was denied the opportunity of
saying it. He was not only allowed but challenged to defend himself. He
was an experienced public speaker, able to hold multitudes with his
oratory, happy and ready in debate and repartee, full of the
illustrative hypothetical cases beloved of lawyers (called parables in
the Gospels), and never at a loss when plied with questions. If ever
there was a full dress debate for the forensic championship to be
looked forward to with excited confidence by the disciples of the
challenged expert it was this trial of Christ. Yet their champion put
up no fight: he went like a lamb to the slaughter, dumb. Such a
spectacle is disappointing on the stage, which is the one thing that a
drama must not be; and when the disappointment is followed by scourging
and crucifixion it is unbearable: not even the genius of our Poet
Laureate, with all the magic of Canterbury Cathedral for scenery, can
redeem it except for people who enjoy horror and catastrophe for their
own sake and have no intellectual expectations to be disappointed.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>DIFFERENCE BETWEEN READER AND SPECTATOR</p>

<p> </p>

<p>It may be asked why the incident of the trial and execution must
fail on the stage, seeing that the gospel narrative is so pathetic, and
so many of us have read it without disappointment. The answer is very
simple: we have read it in childhood; and children go on from horror to
horror breathlessly, knowing nothing of the constitutional questions at
issue. Some of them remain in this condition of intellectual innocence
to the end of their lives, whilst the cleverer ones seldom reconsider
the impressions they have received as little children. Most Christians,
I suspect, are afraid to think about it critically at all, having been
taught to consider criticism blasphemous when applied to Bible stories.
Besides, there are a thousand things that will pass in a well told
story that will not bear being brought to actuality on the stage. The
evangelists can switch off our attention from Jesus to Peter hearing
the cock crow (or the bugle blow) or to Pilate chaffering with the
crowd about Barabbas; but on the stage the dumb figure cannot be got
rid of: it is to him that we look for a speech that will take us up to
heaven, and not to the weeping of Peter and the bawling of the mob,
which become unbearable interruptions instead of skilful
diversions.</p>

<p>For my part, when I read the story over again as an adult and as a
professional critic to boot, I felt the disappointment so keenly that I
have been ever since in the condition of the musician who, when he had
gone to bed, heard somebody play an unresolved discord, and could not
go to sleep until he had risen to play the resolution on his piano.
What follows is my attempt to resolve Pilate's discord. I began with
the narrative of St John, the only one of the four which represents
Jesus as saying anything more than any crazy person might in the same
circumstances.</p>

<p>PILATE. Are you the king of the Jews?</p>

<p>JESUS. Do you really want to know? or have those people outside put
it into your head to ask me?</p>

<p>PILATE. Am I a Jew that I should trouble myself about you? Your own
people and their priests have brought you to me for judgment. What have
you done?</p>

<p>JESUS. My kingdom is not of this world: if it were, my followers
would have fought the police and rescued me. But that sort of thing
does not happen in my kingdom.</p>

<p>PILATE. Then you are a king?</p>

<p>JESUS. You say so. I came into this world and was born a common man
for no other purpose than to reveal the truth. And everyone capable of
receiving the truth recognizes it in my voice.</p>

<p>PILATE. What is truth?</p>

<p>JESUS. You are the first person I have met intelligent enough to ask
me that question.</p>

<p>PILATE. Come on! no flattery. I am a Roman, and no doubt seem
exceptionally intelligent to a Jew. You Jews are always talking about
truth and righteousness and justice: you feed on words when you are
tired of making money, or too poor to have anything else to feed on.
They want me to nail you up on a cross; but as I do not yet see what
particular harm you have done I prefer to nail you down to an argument.
Fine words butter no parsnips in Rome. You say your vocation is to
reveal the truth. I take your word for it; but I ask you what is
truth?</p>

<p>JESUS. It is that which a man must tell even if he be stoned or
crucified for telling it. I am not offering you the truth at a price
for my own profit: I am offering it freely to you for your salvation at
the peril of my own life. Would I do that if I were not driven by God
to do it against all the protests of my shrinking flesh?</p>

<p>PILATE. You Jews are a simple folk. You have found only one god. We
Romans have found many; and one of them is a God of Lies. Even you Jews
have to admit a Father of Lies whom you call the devil, deceiving
yourselves with words as usual. But he is a very potent god, is he not?
And as he delights not only in lies but in all other mischief such as
stonings and crucifixions of innocent men, how am I to judge whether it
is he who is driving you to sacrifice yourself for a lie, or Minerva
driving you to be sacrificed for the truth? I ask you again, what is
truth?</p>

<p>JESUS. It is what you know by your experience to be true or feel in
your soul must be true.</p>

<p>PILATE. You mean that truth is a correspondence between word and
fact. It is true that I am sitting in this chair; but I am not the
truth and the chair is not the truth: we are only the facts. My
perception that I am sitting here may be only a dream; therefore my
perception is not the truth.</p>

<p>JESUS. You say well. The truth is the truth and nothing else. That
is your answer.</p>

<p>PILATE. Aye; but how far is it discoverable? We agree that it is
true that I am sitting in this chair because our senses tell us so; and
two men are not likely to be dreaming the same dream at the same
moment. But when I rise from my chair this truth is no longer true.
Truth is of the present, not of the future. Your hopes for the future
are not the truth. Even in the present your opinions are not the truth.
It is true that I sit in this chair. But is it true that it is better
for your people that I should sit in this chair and impose on them the
peace of Rome than that they should be left to slaughter oneanother in
their own native savagery, as they are now clamoring to me to slaughter
you?</p>

<p>JESUS. There is the peace of God that is beyond our understanding;
and that peace shall prevail over the peace of Rome when God's hour
strikes.</p>

<p>PILATE. Very pretty, my friend; but the hour of the gods is now and
always; and all the world knows what the peace of your Jewish God
means. Have I not read it in the campaigns of Joshua? We Romans have
purchased the <i>pax Romano,</i> with our blood; and we prefer it as a
plain understandable thing which keeps men's knives off oneanother's
throats to your peace which is beyond understanding because it
slaughters man woman and child in the name of your God. But that is
only our opinion. It is not yours. Therefore it is not necessarily the
truth. I must act on it, because a governor must act on something: he
cannot loaf round the roads and talk beautifully as you do. If you were
a responsible governor instead of a poetic vagrant, you would soon
discover that my choice must lie, not between truth and falsehood,
neither of which I can ever ascertain, but between reasonable and well
informed opinion and sentimental and ill informed impulse.</p>

<p>JESUS. Nevertheless, opinion is a dead thing and impulse a live
thing. You cannot impose on me with your reasonable and well informed
opinion. If it is your will to crucify me, I can find you a dozen
reasons for doing so; and your police can supply you with a hundred
facts to support the reasons. If it is your will to spare me I can find
you just as many reasons for that; and my disciples will supply you
with more facts than you will have time or patience to listen to. That
is why your lawyers can plead as well for one side as another, and can
therefore plead without dishonor for the side that pays them, like the
hackney charioteer who will drive you north as readily as south for the
same fare.</p>

<p>PILATE. You are cleverer than I thought; and you are right. There is
my will; and there is the will of Caesar to which my will must give
way; and there is above Caesar the will of the gods. But these wills
are in continual conflict with oneanother; therefore they are not
truth; for truth is one, and cannot conflict with itself. There are
conflicting opinions and conflicting wills; but there is no truth
except the momentary truth that I am sitting in this chair. You tell me
that you are here to bear witness to the truth! You, a vagrant, a
talker, who have never had to pass a sentence nor levy a tax nor issue
an edict! What have you to say that I should not have the presumption
scourged out of you by my executioners?</p>

<p>JESUS. Scourging is not a cure for presumption, nor is it justice,
though you will perhaps call it so in your report to Caesar: it is
cruelty; and that cruelty is wicked and horrible because it is the
weapon with which the sons of Satan slay the sons of God is part of the
eternal truth you seek.</p>

<p>PILATE. Leave out cruelty: all government is cruel; for nothing is
so cruel as impunity. A salutary severity--</p>

<p>JESUS. Oh please! You must excuse me, noble Governor; but I am so
made by God that official phrases make me violently sick. Salutary
severity is ipecacuanha to me. I have spoken to you as one man to
another, in living words. Do not be so ungrateful as to answer me in
dead ones.</p>

<p>PILATE. In the mouth of a Roman words mean something: in the mouth
of a Jew they are a cheap substitute for strong drink. If we allowed
you you would fill the whole world with your scriptures and psalms and
talmuds; and the history of mankind would become a tale of fine words
and villainous deeds.</p>

<p>JESUS. Yet the word came first, before it was made flesh. The word
was the beginning. The word was with God before he made us. Nay, the
word was God.</p>

<p>PILATE. And what may all that mean, pray?</p>

<p>JESUS. The difference between man and Roman is but a word; but it
makes all the difference. The difference between Roman and Jew is only
a word.</p>

<p>PILATE. It is a fact.</p>

<p>JESUS. A fact that was first a thought; for a thought is the
substance of a word. I am no mere chance pile of flesh and bone: if I
were only that, I should fall into corruption and dust before your
eyes. I am the embodiment of a thought of God: I am the Word made
flesh: that is what holds me together standing before you in the image
of God.</p>

<p>PILATE. That is well argued; but what is sauce for the goose is
sauce for the gander; and it seems to me that if you are the Word made
flesh so also am I.</p>

<p>JESUS. Have I not said so again and again? Have they not stoned me
in the streets for saying it? Have I not sent my apostles to proclaim
this great news to the Gentiles and to the very ends of the world? The
Word is God. And God is within you. It was when I said this that the
Jews--my own people--began picking up stones. But why should you, the
Gentile, reproach me for it?</p>

<p>PILATE. I have not reproached you for it. I pointed it out to
you.</p>

<p>JESUS. Forgive me. I am so accustomed to be contradicted--</p>

<p>PILATE. Just so. There are many sorts of words; and they are all
made flesh sooner or later. Go among my soldiers and you will hear many
filthy words and witness many cruel and hateful deeds that began as
thoughts. I do not allow those words to be spoken in my presence. I
punish those deeds as crimes. Your truth, as you call it, can be
nothing but the thoughts for which you have found words which will take
effect in deeds if I set you loose to scatter your words broadcast
among the people. Your own people who bring you to me tell me that your
thoughts are abominable and your words blasphemous. How am I to refute
them? How am I to distinguish between the blasphemies of my soldiers
reported to me by my centurions and your blasphemies reported to me by
your High Priest?</p>

<p>JESUS. Woe betide you and the world if you do not distinguish!</p>

<p>PILATE. So you think. I am not frightened. Why do you think so?</p>

<p>JESUS. I do not think: I know. I have it from God.</p>

<p>PILATE. I have the same sort of knowledge from several gods.</p>

<p>JESUS. In so far as you know the truth you have it from my God, who
is your heavenly father and mine. He has many names and his nature is
manifold. Call him what you will: he is still Our Father. Does a father
tell his children lies?</p>

<p>PILATE. Yes: many lies. You have an earthly father and an earthly
mother. Did they tell you what you are preaching?</p>

<p>JESUS. Alas! no.</p>

<p>PILATE. Then you are defying your father and mother. You are defying
your Church. You are breaking your God's commandments, and claiming a
right to do so. You are pleading for the poor, and declaring that it is
easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle than for a rich
man to enter your God's paradise. Yet you have feasted at the tables of
the rich, and encouraged harlots to spend on perfume for your feet
money that might have been given to the poor, thereby so disgusting
your treasurer that he has betrayed you to the High Priest for a
handful of silver. Well, feast as much as you please: I do not blame
you for refusing to play the fakir and make yourself a walking
exhibition of silly austerities; but I must draw the line at your
making a riot in the temple and throwing the gold of the moneychangers
to be scrambled for by your partizans. I have a law to administer. The
law forbids obscenity, sedition, and blasphemy. You are accused of
sedition and blasphemy. You do not deny them: you only talk about the
truth, which turns out to be nothing but what you like to believe. Your
blasphemy is nothing to me: the whole Jewish religion is blasphemy from
beginning to end from my Roman point of view; but it means a great deal
to the High Priest; and I cannot keep order in Jewry except by dealing
with Jewish fools according to Jewish folly. But sedition concerns me
and my office very closely; and when you undertook to supersede the
Roman Empire by a kingdom in which you and not Caesar are to occupy the
throne, you were guilty of the uttermost sedition. I am loth to have
you crucified; for though you are only a Jew, and a half baked young
one at that, yet I perceive that you are in your Jewish way a man of
quality; and it makes me uneasy to throw a man of quality to the mob,
even if his quality be only a Jewish quality. For I am a patrician and
therefore myself a man of quality; and hawks should not pick out hawks'
eyes. I am actually condescending to parley with you at this length in
the merciful hope of finding an excuse for tolerating your blasphemy
and sedition. In defence you offer me nothing but an empty phrase about
the truth, I am sincere in wishing to spare you; for if I do not
release you I shall have to release that blackguard Barabbas, who has
gone further than you and killed somebody, whereas I understand that
you have only raised a Jew from the dead. So for the last time set your
wits to work, and find me a sound reason for letting a seditious
blasphemer go free.</p>

<p>JESUS. I do not ask you to set me free; nor would I accept my life
at the price of Barabbas's death even if I believed that you could
countermand the ordeal to which I am predestined. Yet for the
satisfaction of your longing for the truth I will tell you that the
answer to your demand is your own argument that neither you nor the
prisoner whom you judge can prove that he is in the right; therefore
you must not judge me lest you be yourself judged. Without sedition and
blasphemy the world would stand still and the Kingdom of God never be a
stage nearer. The Roman Empire began with a wolf suckling two human
infants. If these infants had not been wiser than their fostermother
your empire would be a pack of wolves. It is by children who are wiser
than their fathers, subjects who are wiser than their emperors, beggars
and vagrants who are wiser than their priests, that men rise from being
beasts of prey to believing in me and being saved.</p>

<p>PILATE. What do you mean by believing in you?</p>

<p>JESUS. Seeing the world as I do. What else could it mean?</p>

<p>PILATE. And you are the Christ, the Messiah, eh?</p>

<p>JESUS. Were I Satan, my argument would still hold.</p>

<p>PILATE. And I am to spare and encourage every heretic, every rebel,
every lawbreaker, every rapscallion lest he should turn out to be wiser
than all the generations who made the Roman law and built up the Roman
Empire on it?</p>

<p>JESUS. By their fruits ye shall know them. Beware how you kill a
thought that is new to you. For that thought may be the foundation of
the kingdom of God on earth.</p>

<p>PILATE. It may also be the ruin of all kingdoms, all law, and all
human society. It may be the thought of the beast of prey striving to
return.</p>

<p>JESUS. The beast of prey is not striving to return: the kingdom of
God is striving to come. The empire that looks back in terror shall
give way to the kingdom that looks forward with hope. Terror drives men
mad: hope and faith give them divine wisdom. The men whom you fill with
fear will stick at no evil and perish in their sin: the men whom I fill
with faith shall inherit the earth. I say to you Cast out fear. Speak
no more vain things to me about the greatness of Rome. The greatness of
Rome, as you call it, is nothing but fear: fear of the past and fear of
the future, fear of the poor, fear of the rich, fear of the High
Priests, fear of the Jews and Greeks who are learned, fear of the Gauls
and Goths and Huns who are barbarians, fear of the Carthage you
destroyed to save you from your fear of it and now fear worse than
ever, fear of imperial Caesar, the idol you have yourself created, and
fear of me, the penniless vagrant, buffeted and mocked, fear of
everything except the rule of God: faith in nothing but blood and iron
and gold. You, standing for Rome, are the universal coward: I, standing
for the kingdom of God, have braved everything, lost everything, and
won an eternal crown.</p>

<p>PILATE. You have won a crown of thorns; and you shall wear it on the
cross. You are a more dangerous fellow than I thought. For your
blasphemy against the god of the high priests I care nothing: you may
trample their religion into hell for all I care; but you have
blasphemed against Caesar and against the Empire; and you mean it, and
have the power to turn men's hearts against it as you have half turned
mine. Therefore I must make an end of you whilst there is still some
law left in the world.</p>

<p>JESUS. Law is blind without counsel. The counsel men agree with is
vain: it is only the echo of their own voices. A million echoes will
not help you to rule righteously. But he who does not fear you and
shews you the other side is a pearl of the greatest price. Slay me and
you go blind to your damnation. The greatest of God's names is
Counsellor; and when your Empire is dust and your name a byword among
the nations the temples of the living God shall still ring with his
praise as Wonderful! Counsellor! the Everlasting Father, the Prince of
Peace.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>THE SACREDNESS OF CRITICISM</p>

<p> </p>

<p>And so the last word remains with Christ and Handel; and this must
stand as the best defence of Tolerance until a better man than I makes
a better job of it.</p>

<p>Put shortly and undramatically the case is that a civilization
cannot progress without criticism, and must therefore, to save itself
from stagnation and putrefaction, declare impunity for criticism. This
means impunity not only for propositions which, however novel, seem
interesting, statesmanlike, and respectable, but for propositions that
shock the uncritical as obscene, seditious, blasphemous, heretical, and
revolutionary. That sound Catholic institution, the Devil's Advocate,
must be privileged as possibly the Herald of the World to Come. The
difficulty is to distinguish between the critic and the criminal or
lunatic, between liberty of precept and liberty of example. It may be
vitally necessary to allow a person to advocate Nudism; but it may not
be expedient to allow that person to walk along Piccadilly stark naked.
Karl Marx writing the death warrant of private property in the reading
room of the British Museum was sacred; but if Karl Marx had sent the
rent of his villa in Maitland Park to the Chancellor of the Exchequer,
and shot the landlord's agents when they came to distrain on his
furniture or execute a writ of ejectment, he could hardly have escaped
hanging by pleading his right to criticize. Not until the criticism
changes the law can the magistrate allow the critic to give effect to
it. We are so dangerously uneducated in citizenship that most of us
assume that we have an unlimited right to change our conduct the moment
we have changed our minds. People who have a vague notion that
Socialism is a state of society in which everyone gives away everything
he possesses to everybody else occasionally reproach me because I,
being a Socialist, do not immediately beggar myself in this fashion.
People who imagined, more specifically, that a Socialist could not
consistently keep a motor car, almost succeeded in making a public
question of the possession of such a vehicle by a Prime Minister who at
that time professed Socialism. But even if these idiots had really
understood what they were talking about, they would have been wrong in
supposing that a hostile critic of the existing social order either
could or should behave as if he were living in his own particular
Utopia. He may, at most, be a little eccentric at the cost of being
indulged as slightly cracked.</p>

<p>On the other hand the Government, too, has not only a right but a
duty of criticism. If it is to abandon once for all its savage
superstition that whoever breaks the law is fair game for the
torturers, and that the wrong wrought by the evildoer can be expiated
and undone by a worse wrong done to him by judges and priests: if it is
to substitute the doctrine of Jesus that punishment is only a senseless
attempt to make a white out of two blacks, and to abolish the monstrous
list of crimes and punishments by which these superstitions have been
reduced to practice for routine officials, then there must be a
stupendous extension of governmental criticism; for every crime will
raise the essential critical question whether the criminal is fit to
live at all, and if so whether he is fit to live under more or less
tutelage and discipline like a soldier, or at normal liberty under an
obligation to make good the damage he has cost.</p>

<p>For such functions as these we shall need critics educated otherwise
than our judges of today; but the same may be said of all whose public
functions transcend the application of a routine.</p>

<p>I have no doubt that the eradication of malice, vindictiveness, and
Sadist libido on these terms from the personal contacts of citizens
with their rulers, far from having a reassuring effect, is likely to be
rather terrifying at first, as all people with any tenderness of
conscience will feel the deepest misgivings as to whether they are
really worth keeping alive in a highly civilized community; but that
will wear off as standards of worth get established and known by
practice. In the meantime the terror will act as a sort of social
conscience which is dangerously lacking at present and which none of
our model educational establishments ever dreams of inculcating.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><i>The Cabinet Room in number ten Downing Street, Westminster, the
official residence of the British Prime Minister. The illustrious
holder of that office, Sir Arthur Chavender, is reading The Times on
the hearth under the portrait of Walpole. The fireplace wall is covered
with bookshelves; but one bit of it, on Walpole's right, is a masked
door, painted with sham books and shelves, leading to the Minister's
private apartments; and in the end of the same wall, on Walpole's left,
is a door leading to the office of Sir Arthur's private secretary Miss
Hilda Hanways. The main door is in the side wall on Walpole's right. In
the opposite wall on his left are the spacious windows. Everything is
on an imposing scale, including an oblong table across the middle of
the room, with fourteen leather upholstered chairs, six at each side
and one at each end, pushed in all along it. The presidential chair is
the central one next the cold fireplace (it is mid-July); and there is
a telephone and a switchboard on the table within reach of it.</i></p>

<p><i>Sir Arthur has pulled it round and is making himself comfortable
in it as he reads. At the end of the table nearest the window a silver
tray, with coffee and milk for one person, indicates Sir Arthur's
unofficial seat. In the corner farthest from Walpole, on his right, is
a writing bureau and chair for the secretary. In the corresponding
corner on his left, an armchair. There is a bluebook lying, neglected
and dusty, on a half empty shelf of the bookcase within reach of the
Prime Minister's seat.</i></p>

<p><i>Sir Arthur can hardly be much less than fifty; but his natural
buoyancy makes him look younger. He has an orator's voice of pleasant
tone; and his manners are very genial. In oldish clothes he has the
proper aristocratic air of being carelessly but well dressed, an easy
feat for him, as he is so trimly built that any clothes would look well
cut on him. On the whole, a very engaging personality.</i></p>

<p><i>He reads The Times until his secretary hurries in from her
office, with her notebook and a sheaf of letters in her hand. Her age
is unknown; but she is made up to pass as reasonably young and
attractive. She looks capable; but she does not carry the burden of
State affairs as easily as the Prime Minister. Both are worried; but
with a difference. She is worried not only by an excess of business but
a sense of responsibility. He is equally worried by the excess of
business; but in him enjoyment of his position leaves no doubt in his
mind as to his own entire adequacy to it.</i></p>
</blockquote>

<p> </p>

<p>HILDA. I hear you have been asking for me, Sir Arthur. I'm so sorry
to be late; but really the streets are becoming quite impassable with
the crowds of unemployed. I took a taxi; but it was no use: we were
blocked by a procession; and I had to get out and push my way through.
<i>[She goes to her bureau].</i></p>

<p>SIR ARTHUR <i>[rising]</i> What on earth good do they think they can
do themselves by crowding aimlessly about Westminster and the public
offices?</p>

<p>HILDA. Thank Goodness the police wont let them into Downing Street.
<i>[She sits down].</i> They would be all over the doorstep.</p>

<p>SIR ARTHUR. It's all so foolish--so ignorant, poor chaps! <i>[He
throws The Times on the table and moves to the end chair, where his
coffee is].</i> They think because I'm Prime Minister I'm Divine
Providence and can find jobs for them before trade revives. <i>[He sits
down and fidgets with his papers].</i></p>

<p>HILDA. Trafalgar Square's full. The Horse Guards parade is full. The
Mall is full all the way down to Marlborough House and Buckingham
Palace.</p>

<p>SIR ARTHUR. They have no right to be there. Trafalgar Square is not
a public place: it belongs to the Commissioner of Woods and Forests.
The Horse Guards parade is reserved for the military. The Mall is a
thoroughfare: anyone stopping there is guilty of obstruction. What are
the police thinking of? Why dont they clear them out?</p>

<p>HILDA. I asked the policeman who got me through to the gates why
they didnt. He said "We're only too glad to have them where they cant
break any windows, and where the mounted men can have a fair whack at
the Hooligan Fringe when they get too obstreperous."</p>

<p>SIR ARTHUR. Hooligan Fringe! He got that out of the papers. It only
encourages them to write them up like that.</p>

<p>HILDA. Sir Broadfoot Basham has come over from Scotland Yard. He is
talking to Lady Chavender.</p>

<p>SIR ARTHUR <i>[rising and making for the telephone]</i> Yes: I
telephoned for him. He really must do something to stop these meetings.
It was a mistake to make a man with a name like that Chief Commissioner
of Police. People think him a trampling, bashing, brutal terrorist no
matter how considerately the police behave. What we need is a
thoroughly popular figure. <i>[He takes up the telephone]</i> Ask Sir
Broadfoot Basham to come up.</p>

<p>HILDA. I dont think any chief of police could be popular at present.
Every day they are bludgeoning deputations of the unemployed. <i>[She
sits down and busies herself with letters].</i></p>

<p>SIR ARTHUR. Poor devils! I hate that part of the business. But what
are the police to do? We cant have the sittings of the local
authorities threatened by deputations. Deputations are frightful
nuisances even in the quietest times; but just now they are a public
danger.</p>

<p><i>The Chief Commissioner of Police enters by the main door. A
capable looking man from the military point of view. He is a gentleman:
and his manners are fairly pleasant; but they are not in the least
conciliatory.</i></p>

<p><i>Hilda rises and pulls out a chair for him at the end of the table
nearest to her and farthest from Sir Arthur; then returns to her work
at her desk. Sir Arthur comes round to his side of the table.</i></p>

<p>SIR ARTHUR. Morning, Basham. Sit down. I'm devilishly busy; but you
are always welcome to your ten minutes.</p>

<p>BASHAM <i>[coolly, sitting down]</i> Thank you. You sent for me.
<i>[Anxiously]</i> Anything new?</p>

<p>SIR ARTHUR. These street corner meetings are going beyond all
bounds.</p>

<p>BASHAM <i>[relieved]</i> What harm do they do? Crowds are dangerous
when theyve nothing to listen to or look at. The meetings keep them
amused. They save us trouble.</p>

<p>SIR ARTHUR. Thats all very well for you, Basham; but think of the
trouble they make for me! Remember: this is a National Government, not
a party one. I am up against my Conservative colleagues all the time;
and they cant swallow the rank sedition that goes on every day at these
meetings. Sir Dexter Rightside--you know what a regular old Diehard he
is--heard a speaker say that if the police used tear gas the unemployed
would give old Dexy something to cry for without any tear gas. That has
brought matters to a head in the Cabinet. We shall make an Order in
Council to enable you to put a stop to all street meetings and
speeches.</p>

<p>BASHAM <i>[unimpressed</i>--<i>slowly]</i> If you dont mind, P.M., I
had rather you didnt do that.</p>

<p>SIR ARTHUR. Why not?</p>

<p>BASHAM. Crowd psychology.</p>

<p>SIR ARTHUR. Nonsense! Really, Basham, if you are going to come this
metaphysical rot over me I shall begin to wonder whether your
appointment wasnt a mistake.</p>

<p>BASHAM. Of course it was a mistake. Dealing with the unemployed is
not a soldier's job; and I was a soldier. If you want these crowds
settled on soldierly lines, say so; and give me half a dozen machine
guns. The streets will be clear before twelve o'clock.</p>

<p>SIR ARTHUR. Man: have you considered the effect on the
bye-elections?</p>

<p>BASHAM. A soldier has nothing to do with elections. You shew me a
crowd and tell me to disperse it. All youll hear is a noise like a
watchman's rattle. Quite simple.</p>

<p>SIR ARTHUR. Far too simple. You soldiers never understand the
difficulties a statesman has to contend with.</p>

<p>BASHAM. Well, whats your alternative?</p>

<p>SIR ARTHUR. I have told you. Arrest the sedition mongers. That will
shut old Dexy's mouth.</p>

<p>BASHAM. So that Satan may find mischief still for idle hands to do.
No, P.M.: the right alternative is mine: keep the crowd amused. You
ought to know that, I think, better than most men.</p>

<p>SIR ARTHUR. I! What do you mean?</p>

<p>BASHAM. The point is to prevent the crowd doing anything, isnt
it?</p>

<p>SIR ARTHUR. Anything mischievous: I suppose so. But--</p>

<p>BASHAM. An English crowd will never do anything, mischievous or the
reverse, while it is listening to speeches. And the fellows who make
the speeches can be depended on never to do anything else. In the first
place, they dont know how. In the second, they are afraid. I am
instructing my agents to press all the talking societies, the Ethical
Societies, the Socialist societies, the Communists, the Fascists, the
Anarchists, the Syndicalists, the official Labor Party, the Independent
Labor Party, the Salvation Army, the Church Army and the Atheists, to
send their best tub-thumpers into the streets to seize the
opportunity.</p>

<p>SIR ARTHUR. What opportunity?</p>

<p>BASHAM. They dont know. Neither do I. It's only a phrase that means
nothing: just what they are sure to rise at. I must keep Trafalgar
Square going night and day. A few Labor M.P.s would help. You have a
rare lot of gasbags under your thumb in the House. If you could send
half a dozen of them down to the Yard, I could plant them where they
would be really useful.</p>

<p>SIR ARTHUR <i>[incensed]</i> Basham: I must tell you that we are
quite determined to put a stop to this modern fashion of speaking
disrespectfully of the House of Commons. If it goes too far we shall
not hesitate to bring prominent offenders to the bar of the House, no
matter what their position is.</p>

<p>BASHAM. Arthur: as responsible head of the police, I am up against
the facts all day and every day; and one of the facts is that nowadays
nobody outside the party cliques cares a brass button for the House of
Commons. <i>[Rising]</i> You will do what I ask you as to letting the
speaking go on, wont you?</p>

<p>SIR ARTHUR. Well, I--er--</p>

<p>BASHAM. Unless you are game to try the machine guns.</p>

<p>SIR ARTHUR. Oh do drop that, Basham <i>[he returns to his chair and
sits moodily].</i></p>

<p>BASHAM. Righto! We'll let them talk. Thanks ever so much. Sorry to
have taken up so much of your time: I know it's priceless. <i>[He
hurries to the door; then hesitates and adds]</i> By the way, I know
it's asking a lot; but if you could give us a turn in Trafalgar Square
yourself--some Sunday afternoon would be best--it--</p>

<p>SIR ARTHUR <i>[springing up, thoroughly roused]</i> I!!!!</p>

<p>BASHAM <i>[hurriedly]</i> No: of course you couldnt. Only, it would
do such a lot of good--keep the crowd quiet talking about it for a
fortnight. However, of course it's impossible: say no more: so long.
<i>[He goes out].</i></p>

<p>SIR ARTHUR <i>[collapsing into his chair]</i> Well, really! Basham's
losing his head. I wonder what he meant by saying that I ought to know
better than most men. What ought I to know better than most men?</p>

<p>HILDA. I think he meant that you are such a wonderful speaker you
ought to know what a magical effect a fine speech has on a crowd.</p>

<p>SIR ARTHUR <i>[musing]</i> Do you know, I am not at all sure that
there is not something in his idea of my making a speech in Trafalgar
Square. I have not done such a thing for many many years; but I have
stood between the lions in my time; and I believe that if I were to
tackle the unemployed face to face, and explain to them that I intend
to call a conference in March next on the prospects of a revival of
trade, it would have a wonderfully soothing effect.</p>

<p>HILDA. But it's impossible. You have a conference every month until
November. And think of the time taken by the travelling! One in Paris!
Two in Geneva! One in Japan! You cant possibly do it: you will break
down.</p>

<p>SIR ARTHUR. And shall I be any better at home here leading the
House? sitting up all night in bad air listening to fools insulting me?
I tell you I should have been dead long ago but for the relief of these
conferences: the journeys and the change. And I look forward to Japan.
I shall be able to pick up some nice old bric-a-brac there.</p>

<p>HILDA. Oh well! You know best.</p>

<p>SIR ARTHUR <i>[energetically]</i> And now to work. Work! work! work!
<i>[He rises and paces the floor in front of the table].</i> I want you
to take down some notes for my speech this afternoon at the Church
House. The Archbishop tells me that the Anglo-Catholics are going mad
on what they call Christian Communism, and that I must head them
off.</p>

<p>HILDA. There are those old notes on the economic difficulties of
Socialism that you used at the British Association last year.</p>

<p>SIR ARTHUR. No: these parsons know too much about that. Besides,
this is not the time to talk about economic difficulties: we're up to
the neck in them. The Archbishop says "Avoid figures; and stick to the
fact that Socialism would break up the family." I believe he is right:
a bit of sentiment about the family always goes down well. Just jot
this down for me. <i>[Dictating]</i> Family. Foundation of
civilization. Foundation of the empire.</p>

<p>HILDA. Will there be any Hindus or Mahometans present?</p>

<p>SIR ARTHUR. No. No polygamists at the Church House. Besides,
everybody knows that The Family means the British family. By the way, I
can make a point of that. Put down in a separate line, in red capitals,
"One man one wife." Let me see now: can I work that up? "One child one
father." How would that do?</p>

<p>HILDA. I think it would be safer to say "One child one mother."</p>

<p>SIR ARTHUR. No: that might get a laugh--the wrong sort of laugh. I'd
better not risk it. Strike it out. A laugh in the wrong place in the
Church House would be the very devil. Where did you get that necklace?
it's rather pretty. I havnt seen it before.</p>

<p>HILDA. Ive worn it every day for two months. <i>[Striking out the
"one child" note]</i> Yes?</p>

<p>SIR ARTHUR. Then--er--what subject are we on? <i>[Testily]</i> I
wish you wouldnt interrupt me: I had the whole speech in my head
beautifully; and now it's gone.</p>

<p>HILDA. Sorry. The family.</p>

<p>SIR ARTHUR. The family? Whose family? What family? The Holy Family?
The Royal Family? The Swiss Family Robinson? Do be a little more
explicit, Miss Hanways.</p>

<p>HILDA <i>[gently insistent]</i> Not any particular family. THE
family. Socialism breaking up the family. For the Church House speech
this afternoon.</p>

<p>SIR ARTHUR. Yes yes yes, of course. I was in the House yesterday
until three in the morning; and my brains are just so much tripe.</p>

<p>HILDA. Why did you sit up? The business didnt matter.</p>

<p>SIR ARTHUR <i>[scandalized]</i> Not matter! You really must not say
these things, Miss Hanways. A full dress debate on whether Jameson or
Thompson was right about what Johnson said in the Cabinet!</p>

<p>HILDA. Ten years ago.</p>

<p>SIR ARTHUR. What does that matter? The real question: the question
whether Jameson or Thompson is a liar, is a vital question of the first
importance.</p>

<p>HILDA. But theyre both liars.</p>

<p>SIR ARTHUR. Of course they are; but the division might have affected
their inclusion in the next Cabinet. The whole House rose at it. Look
at the papers this morning! Full of it.</p>

<p>HILDA. And three lines about the unemployed, though I was twenty
minutes late trying to shove my way through them. Really, Sir Arthur,
you should have come home to bed. You will kill yourself if you try to
get through your work and attend so many debates as well: you will
indeed.</p>

<p>SIR ARTHUR. Miss Hanways: I wish I could persuade you to remember
occasionally that I happen to be the leader of the House of
Commons.</p>

<p>HILDA. Oh, what is the use of leading the House if it never goes
anywhere? It just breaks my heart to see the state you come home in.
You are good for nothing next morning.</p>

<p>SIR ARTHUR <i>[yelling at her]</i> Dont remind me of it: do you
think I dont know? My brain is overworked: my mental grasp is stretched
and strained to breaking point. I shall go mad. <i>[Pulling himself
together]</i> However, it's no use grousing about it: I shall have a
night off going to Geneva, and a week-end at Chequers. But it is hard
to govern a country and do fifty thousand other things every day that
might just as well be done by the Beadle of Burlington Arcade. Well,
well, we mustnt waste time. Work! work! work! <i>[He returns to his
chair and sits down resolutely].</i> Get along with it. What were we
talking about?</p>

<p>HILDA. The family.</p>

<p>SIR ARTHUR <i>[grasping his temples distractedly]</i> Oh dear! Has
Lady Chavender's sister-in-law been making a fuss again?</p>

<p>HILDA. No, no. The family. Not any real family. THE family.
Socialism breaking up the family. Your speech this afternoon at the
Church House.</p>

<p>SIR ARTHUR. Ah, of course. I am going dotty. Thirty years in
Parliament and ten on the Front Bench would drive any man dotty. I have
only one set of brains and I need ten. I--</p>

<p>HILDA <i>[urgently]</i> We must get on with the notes for your
speech, Sir Arthur. The morning has half gone already; and weve done
nothing.</p>

<p>SIR ARTHUR <i>[again infuriated]</i> How can the busiest man in
England find time to do anything? It is you who have wasted the morning
interrupting me with your silly remarks about your necklace. What do I
care about your necklace?</p>

<p>HILDA. You gave it to me, Sir Arthur.</p>

<p>SIR ARTHUR. Did I? Ha ha ha! Yes: I believe I did. I bought it in
Venice. But come along now. What about that speech?</p>

<p>HILDA. Yes. The family. It was about the family.</p>

<p>SIR ARTHUR. Well, I know that: I have not yet become a complete
idiot. You keep saying the family, the family, the family.</p>

<p>HILDA. Socialism and the family. How Socialism will break up the
family.</p>

<p>SIR ARTHUR. Who says Socialism will break up the family? Dont be a
fool.</p>

<p>HILDA. The Archbishop wants you to say it. At the Church House.</p>

<p>SIR ARTHUR. Decidedly I am going mad.</p>

<p>HILDA. No: you are only tired. You were getting along all right. One
man one wife: that is where you stopped.</p>

<p>SIR ARTHUR. One man one wife is one wife too many, if she has a lot
of brothers who cant get on with the women they marry. Has it occurred
to you, Miss Hanways, that the prospect of Socialism destroying the
family may not be altogether unattractive?</p>

<p>HILDA <i>[despairingly]</i> Oh, Sir Arthur, we must get on with the
notes: we really must. I have all the letters to do yet. Do try to pick
up the thread. The family the foundation of the empire. The foundation
of Christianity. Of civilization. Of human society.</p>

<p>SIR ARTHUR. Thats enough about the foundation: it wont bear any
more. I must have another word to work up. Let me see. I have it.
Nationalization of women.</p>

<p>HILDA <i>[remonstrating]</i> Oh, Sir Arthur!</p>

<p>SIR ARTHUR. Whats the matter now?</p>

<p>HILDA. Such bunk!</p>

<p>SIR ARTHUR. Miss Hanways: when a statesman is not talking bunk he is
making trouble for himself; and Goodness knows I have trouble enough
without making any more. Put this down. <i>[He rises and takes his
platform attitude at the end of the table].</i> "No, your Grace, my
lords and gentlemen. Nationalize the land if you will; nationalize our
industries if we must; nationalize education, housing, science, art,
the theatre, the opera, even the cinema; but spare our women."</p>

<p>HILDA <i>[having taken it down]</i> Is that the finish?</p>

<p>SIR ARTHUR <i>[abandoning the attitude and pacing about]</i> No:
write in red capitals under it "Rock of Ages."</p>

<p>HILDA. I think Rock of Ages will be rather a shock unless in
connexion with something very sincere. May I suggest "The Church's One
Foundation"?</p>

<p>SIR ARTHUR. Yes. Much better. Thank you. The family the Church's one
foundation. Splendid.</p>

<p><i>Miss Flavia Chavender, 19, bursts violently into the room through
the masked door and dashes to her father.</i></p>

<p>FLAVIA. Papa: I will not stand Mamma any longer. She interferes with
me in every possible way out of sheer dislike of me. I refuse to live
in this house with her a moment longer.</p>

<p><i>Lady Chavender follows her in, speaking as she enters, and comes
between the Prime Minister and his assailant.</i></p>

<p>LADY CHAVENDER. I knew you were coming here to make a scene and
disturb your father, though he has had hardly six hours sleep this
week, and was up all night. I am so sorry, Arthur: she is
uncontrollable.</p>

<p><i>David Chavender, 18, slight, refined, rather small for his age,
charges in to the table.</i></p>

<p>DAVID <i>[in a childish falsetto]</i> Look here, Mamma. Cant you let
Flavia alone? I wont stand by and see her nagged at and treated like a
child of six. Nag! nag! nag! everything she does.</p>

<p>LADY CHAVENDER. Nag!! I control myself to the limit of human
endurance with you all. But Flavia makes a study of annoying me.</p>

<p>FLAVIA. It's not true: I have considered you and given up all the
things I wanted for you until I have no individuality left. If I take
up a book you want me to read something else. If I want to see anybody
you want me to see somebody else. If I choose the color of my own dress
you want something different and dowdy. I cant sit right nor stand
right nor do my hair right nor dress myself right: my life here is a
hell.</p>

<p>LADY CHAVENDER. Flavia!!</p>

<p>FLAVIA <i>[passionately]</i> Yes, hell.</p>

<p>DAVID. Quite true. <i>[Fortissimo]</i> Hell.</p>

<p>LADY CHAVENDER <i>[quietly]</i> Miss Hanways: would you mind--</p>

<p>HILDA. Yes, Lady Chavender <i>[she rises to go].</i></p>

<p>FLAVIA. You neednt go, Hilda. You know what I have to endure.</p>

<p>DAVID. Damn all this paralyzing delicacy! Damn it!</p>

<p>LADY CHAVENDER. Arthur--</p>

<p>SIR ARTHUR <i>[patting her]</i> Never mind, dear. They must be let
talk. <i>[He returns placidly to his chair].</i> It's just like the
House of Commons, except that the speeches are shorter.</p>

<p>FLAVIA. Oh, it's no use trying to make papa listen to anything.
<i>[She throws herself despairingly into Basham's chair and
writhes].</i></p>

<p>DAVID <i>[approaching Sir Arthur with dignity]</i> I really think,
father, you might for once in a way take some slight interest in the
family.</p>

<p>SIR ARTHUR. My dear boy, at this very moment I am making notes for a
speech on the family. Ask Miss Hanways.</p>

<p>HILDA. Yes. Mr Chavender: Sir Arthur is to speak this afternoon on
the disintegrating effect of Socialism on family life.</p>

<p>FLAVIA <i>[irresistible amusement struggling with hysterics and
getting the better of them]</i> Ha ha! Ha ha ha!</p>

<p>DAVID <i>[retreating]</i> Ha ha! Haw! Thats the best--ha ha ha!</p>

<p>SIR ARTHUR. I dont see the joke. Why this hilarity?</p>

<p>DAVID. Treat the House to a brief description of this family; and
you will get the laugh of your life.</p>

<p>FLAVIA. Damn the family!</p>

<p>LADY CHAVENDER. Flavia!</p>

<p>FLAVIA <i>[bouncing up]</i> Yes: there you go. I mustnt say damn. I
mustnt say anything I feel and think, only what you feel and think.
Thats family life. Scold, scold, scold!</p>

<p>DAVID. Squabble, squabble, squabble!</p>

<p>FLAVIA. Look at the unbearable way you treat me! Look at the
unbearable way you treat Papa!</p>

<p>SIR ARTHUR <i>[rising in flaming wrath]</i> How dare you? Silence.
Leave the room.</p>

<p><i>After a moment of awestruck silence Flavia, rather dazed by the
avalanche she has brought down on herself, looks at her father in a
lost way; then bursts into tears and runs out through the masked
door.</i></p>

<p>SIR ARTHUR <i>[quietly]</i> Youd better go too, my boy.</p>

<p><i>David, also somewhat dazed, shrugs his shoulders and goes out.
Sir Arthur looks at Hilda. She hurries out almost on tiptoe.</i></p>

<p>SIR ARTHUR <i>[taking his wife in his arms affectionately]</i> Treat
me badly! You!! I could have killed her, poor little devil.</p>

<p><i>He sits down; and she passes behind him and takes the nearest
chair on his right.</i></p>

<p><i>She is a nice woman, and goodlooking; but she is bored; and her
habitual manner is one of apology for being not only unable to take an
interest in people, but even to pretend that she does.</i></p>

<p>LADY CHAVENDER. It serves us right, dear, for letting them bring
themselves up in the post-war fashion instead of teaching them to be
ladies and gentlemen. Besides, Flavia was right. I do treat you
abominably. And you are so good!</p>

<p>SIR ARTHUR. Nonsense! Such a horrid wicked thing to say. Dont you
know, my love, that you are the best of wives? the very best as well as
the very dearest?</p>

<p>LADY CHAVENDER. You are certainly the best of husbands, Arthur. You
are the best of everything. I dont wonder at the country adoring you.
But Flavia was quite right. It is the first time I have ever known her
to be right about anything. I am a bad wife and a bad mother. I dislike
my daughter and treat her badly. I like you very much; and I treat you
abominably.</p>

<p>SIR ARTHUR. No; no.</p>

<p>LADY CHAVENDER. Yes, yes. I suppose it's something wrong in my
constitution. I was not born for wifing and mothering. And yet I am
very very fond of you, as you know. But I have a grudge against your
career.</p>

<p>SIR ARTHUR. My career! <i>[Complacently]</i> Well, theres not much
wrong with that, is there? Of course I know it keeps me too much away
from home. That gives you a sort of grudge against it. All the wives of
successful men are a bit like that. But it's better to see too little
of a husband than too much of him, isnt it?</p>

<p>LADY CHAVENDER. I am so glad that you really feel successful.</p>

<p>SIR ARTHUR. Well, it may sound conceited and all that; but after all
a man cant be Prime Minister and go about with a modest cough
pretending to be a nobody. Facts are facts; and the facts in my case
are that I have climbed to the top of the tree; I am happy in my work;
and--</p>

<p>LADY CHAVENDER. Your what?</p>

<p>SIR ARTHUR. You are getting frightfully deaf, dear. I said "my
work."</p>

<p>LADY CHAVENDER. You call it work?</p>

<p>SIR ARTHUR. Brain work, dear, brain work. Do you really suppose that
governing the country is not work, but a sort of gentlemanly
diversion?</p>

<p>LADY CHAVENDER. But you dont govern the country, Arthur. The country
isnt governed: it just slummocks along anyhow.</p>

<p>SIR ARTHUR. I have to govern within democratic limits. I cannot go
faster than our voters will let me.</p>

<p>LADY CHAVENDER. Oh, your voters! What do they know about government?
Football, prizefighting, war: that is what they like. And they like war
because it isnt real to them: it's only a cinema show. War is real to
me; and I hate it, as every woman to whom it is real hates it. But to
you it is only part of your game: one of the regular moves of the
Foreign Office and the War Office.</p>

<p>SIR ARTHUR. My dear, I hate war as much as you do. It makes a Prime
Minister's job easy because it brings every dog to heel; but it
produces coalitions; and I believe in party government.</p>

<p>LADY CHAVENDER <i>[rising]</i> Oh, it's no use talking to you,
Arthur. <i>[She comes behind him and plants her hands on his
shoulders].</i> You are a dear and a duck and a darling; but you live
in fairyland and I live in the hard wicked world. Thats why I cant be a
good wife and take an interest in your career.</p>

<p>SIR ARTHUR. Stuff! Politics are not a woman's business: thats all it
means. Thank God I have not a political wife. Look at Higginbotham! He
was just ripe for the Cabinet when his wife went into Parliament and
made money by journalism. That was the end of him.</p>

<p>LADY CHAVENDER. And I married a man with a hopelessly parliamentary
mind; and that was the end of me.</p>

<p>SIR ARTHUR. Yes, yes, my pettums. I know that you have sacrificed
yourself to keeping my house and sewing on my buttons; and I am not
ungrateful. I am sometimes remorseful; but I love it. And now you must
run away, I am very very very busy this morning.</p>

<p>LADY CHAVENDER. Yes, yes, very very busy doing nothing. And it wears
you out far more than if your mind had something sensible to work on!
Youll have a nervous breakdown if you go on like this. Promise me that
you will see the lady I spoke to you about--if you wont see a proper
doctor.</p>

<p>SIR ARTHUR. But you told me this woman is a doctor! <i>[He rises and
breaks away from her].</i> Once for all, I wont see any doctor. I'm old
enough to do my own doctoring; and I'm not going to pay any doctor,
male or female, three guineas to tell me what I know perfectly well
already: that my brain's overworked and I must take a fortnight off on
the links, or go for a sea voyage.</p>

<p>LADY CHAVENDER. She charges twenty guineas, Arthur.</p>

<p>SIR ARTHUR <i>[shaken]</i> Oh! Does she? What for?</p>

<p>LADY CHAVENDER. Twenty guineas for the diagnosis and twelve guineas
a week at her sanatorium in the Welsh mountains, where she wants to
keep you under observation for six weeks. That would really rest you;
and I think you would find her a rather interesting and attractive
woman.</p>

<p>SIR ARTHUR. Has she a good cook?</p>

<p>LADY CHAVENDER. I dont think that matters.</p>

<p>SIR ARTHUR. Not matter!</p>

<p>LADY CHAVENDER. No. She makes her patients fast.</p>

<p>SIR ARTHUR. Tell her I'm not a Mahatma. If I pay twelve guineas a
week I shall expect three meals a day for it.</p>

<p>LADY CHAVENDER. Then you will see her?</p>

<p>SIR ARTHUR. Certainly not, if I have to pay twenty guineas for
it.</p>

<p>LADY CHAVENDER. No, no. Only a social call, not a professional
visit. Just to amuse you, and gratify her curiosity. She wants to meet
you.</p>

<p>SIR ARTHUR. Very well, dear, very well, very well. This woman has
got round you, I see. Well, she shant get round me; but to please you
I'll have a look at her. And now you really must run away. I have a
frightful mass of work to get through this morning.</p>

<p>LADY CHAVENDER. Thank you, darling. <i>[She kisses him]</i> May I
tell Flavia she is forgiven?</p>

<p>SIR ARTHUR. Yes. But I havnt really forgiven her. I'll never forgive
her.</p>

<p>LADY CHAVENDER <i>[smiling]</i> Dearest. <i>[She kisses his fingers
and goes out, giving him a parting smile as she goes through the masked
door].</i></p>

<p><i>Sir Arthur, left alone, looks inspired and triumphant. He
addresses an imaginary assembly.</i></p>

<p>SIR ARTHUR. "My lords and gentlemen: you are not theorists. You are
not rhapsodists. You are no longer young"--no, damn it, old Middlesex
wont like that. "We have all been young. We have seen visions and
dreamt dreams. We have cherished hopes and striven towards ideals. We
have aspired to things that have not been realized. But we are now
settled experienced men, family men. We are husbands and fathers. Yes,
my lords and gentlemen: husbands and fathers. And I venture to claim
your unanimous consent when I affirm that we have found something in
these realities that was missing in the ideals. I thank you for that
burst of applause: which I well know is no mere tribute to my poor
eloquence, but the spontaneous and irresistible recognition of the
great natural truth that our friends the Socialists have left out of
their fancy pictures of a mass society in which regulation is to take
the place of emotion and economics of honest human passion." Whew! that
took a long breath. "They never will, gentlemen, I say they never will.
They will NOT <i>[he smites the table and pauses, glaring round at his
imaginary hearers].</i> I see that we are of one mind, my lords and
gentlemen. I need not labor the point." Then labor it for the next ten
minutes. That will do. That will do. <i>[He sits down; rings the
telephone bell; and seizes the milk jug, which he empties at a single
draught].</i></p>

<p><i>Hilda appears at the main door.</i></p>

<p>HILDA. Did you say you would receive a deputation from the Isle of
Cats this morning? I have no note of it.</p>

<p>SIR ARTHUR. Oh, confound it, I believe I did. I totally forgot
it.</p>

<p>HILDA. Theyve come.</p>

<p>SIR ARTHUR. Bother them!</p>

<p>HILDA. By all means. But how am I to get rid of them? What am I to
say?</p>

<p>SIR ARTHUR <i>[resignedly]</i> Oh, I suppose I must see them. Why do
I do these foolish things? Tell Burton to shew them in.</p>

<p>HILDA. Burton is in his shirt sleeves doing something to the
refrigerator. I'd better introduce them.</p>

<p>SIR ARTHUR. Oh, bundle them in anyhow. And tell them I am
frightfully busy.</p>

<p><i>She goes out, closing the door softly behind her. He pushes away
the breakfast tray and covers it with The Times, which he opens out to
its fullest extent for that purpose. Then he collects his papers into
the vacant space, and takes up a big blue one, in the study of which he
immerses himself profoundly.</i></p>

<p>HILDA <i>[flinging the door open]</i> The worshipful the Mayor of
the Isle of Cats.</p>

<p><i>The Mayor, thick and elderly, enters, a little shyly, followed by
(a) an unladylike but brilliant and very confident young woman in smart
factory-made clothes after the latest Parisian models, (b) a powerfully
built loud voiced young man fresh from Oxford University, defying
convention in corduroys, pullover, and unshaven black beard, (c) a
thin, undersized lower middle class young man in an alderman's gown,
evidently with a good conceit of himself, and (d) a sunny comfortable
old chap in his Sunday best, who might be anything from a working man
with a very sedentary job (say a watchman) to a city missionary of
humble extraction. He is aggressively modest, or pretends to be, and
comes in last with a disarming smile rather as a poor follower of the
deputation than as presuming to form part of it. They group themselves
at the door behind the Mayor, who is wearing his chain of
office.</i></p>

<p>SIR ARTHUR <i>[starting from his preoccupation with important State
documents, and advancing past the fireplace to greet the Mayor with
charming affability]</i> What! My old friend Tom Humphries! How have
you been all these years? Sit down. <i>[They shake hands, whilst Hilda
deftly pulls out a chair from the end of the table nearest the
door].</i></p>

<p><i>The Mayor sits down, rather overwhelmed by the cordiality of his
reception.</i></p>

<p>SIR ARTHUR <i>[continuing]</i> Well, well! fancy your being Mayor
of--of--</p>

<p>HILDA <i>[prompting]</i> The Isle of Cats.</p>

<p>THE YOUNG WOMAN <i>[brightly, helping her out]</i> Down the river,
Sir Arthur. Twenty minutes from your door by Underground.</p>

<p>THE OXFORD YOUTH <i>[discordantly]</i> Oh, he knows as well as you
do, Aloysia. <i>[He advances offensively on Sir Arthur, who declines
the proximity by retreating a step or two somewhat haughtily].</i> Stow
all this fo bunnum business, Chavender.</p>

<p>SIR ARTHUR. This what?</p>

<p>OXFORD YOUTH. Oh, chuck it. You know French as well as I do.</p>

<p>SIR ARTHUR. Oh, faux bonhomme, of course, yes. <i>[Looking him up
and down].</i> I see by your costume that you represent the upper
classes in the Isle of Cats.</p>

<p>OXFORD YOUTH. There are no upper classes in the Isle of Cats.</p>

<p>SIR ARTHUR. In that case, since it is agreed that there is to be no
fo bunnum nonsense between us, may I ask what the dickens you are doing
here?</p>

<p>OXFORD YOUTH. I am not here to bandy personalities. Whatever the
accident of birth and the humbug of rank may have made me I am here as
a delegate from the Borough Council and an elected representative of
the riverside proletariat.</p>

<p>SIR ARTHUR <i>[suddenly pulling out a chair from the middle of the
table--peremptorily]</i> Sit down. Dont break the chair. <i>[The Youth
scowls at him and flings himself into the chair like a falling
tree].</i> You are all most welcome. Perhaps, Tom, you will introduce
your young friends.</p>

<p>THE MAYOR <i>[introducing]</i> Alderwoman Aloysia Brollikins.</p>

<p>SIR ARTHUR <i>[effusively shaking her hand]</i> How do you do, Miss
Brollikins? <i>[He pulls out a chair for her on the Oxford Youth's
right].</i></p>

<p>ALOYSIA. Nicely, thank you. Pleased to meet you, Sir Arthur. <i>[She
sits].</i></p>

<p>THE MAYOR. Alderman Blee.</p>

<p>SIR ARTHUR <i>[with flattering gravity, pressing his hand]</i> Ah,
we have all heard of you, Mr Blee. Will you sit here? <i>[He indicates
the presidential chair on the Oxford Youth's left].</i></p>

<p>BLEE. Thank you. I do my best. <i>[He sits].</i></p>

<p>THE MAYOR. Viscount Barking.</p>

<p>SIR ARTHUR <i>[triumphantly]</i> Ah! I thought so. A red Communist:
what!</p>

<p>OXFORD YOUTH. Red as blood. Same red as the people's.</p>

<p>SIR ARTHUR. How did you get the blue out of it? The Barkings came
over with the Conqueror.</p>

<p>OXFORD YOUTH <i>[rising]</i> Look here. The unemployed are starving.
Is this a time for persiflage?</p>

<p>SIR ARTHUR. Camouflage, my lad, camouflage. Do you expect me to take
you seriously in that get-up?</p>

<p>OXFORD YOUTH <i>[hotly]</i> I shall wear what I damn well please.
I--</p>

<p>ALOYSIA. Shut up, Toffy. You promised to behave yourself. Sit down;
and lets get to business.</p>

<p>BARKING <i>[subsides into his chair with a grunt of
disgust]</i>!</p>

<p>SIR ARTHUR <i>[looking rather doubtfully at the old man, who is
still standing]</i> Is this gentleman a member of your deputation?</p>

<p>THE MAYOR. Mr Hipney. Old and tried friend of the working class.</p>

<p>OXFORD YOUTH. Old Hipney. Why dont you call him by the name the East
End knows him by? Old Hipney. Good old Hipney.</p>

<p>OLD HIPNEY <i>[slipping noiselessly into the secretary's chair at
the bureau]</i> Dont mind me, Sir Arthur. I dont matter.</p>

<p>SIR ARTHUR. At such a crisis as the present, Mr Hipney, every
public-spirited man matters. Delighted to meet you. <i>[He returns to
his own chair and surveys them now that they are all seated, whilst
Hilda slips discreetly out into her office].</i> And now, what can I do
for you, Miss Brollikins? What can I do for you, gentlemen?</p>

<p>THE MAYOR <i>[slowly]</i> Well, Sir Arthur, as far as I can make it
out the difficulty seems to be that you cant do anything. But
something's got to be done.</p>

<p>SIR ARTHUR <i>[stiffening suddenly]</i> May I ask why, if everything
that is possible has already been done?</p>

<p>THE MAYOR. Well, the unemployed are--well, unemployed, you know.</p>

<p>SIR ARTHUR. We have provided for the unemployed. That provision has
cost us great sacrifices; but we have made the sacrifices without
complaining.</p>

<p>THE OXFORD YOUTH <i>[scornfully]</i> Sacrifices! What sacrifices?
Are you starving? Have you pawned your overcoat? Are you sleeping ten
in a room?</p>

<p>SIR ARTHUR. The noble lord enquires--</p>

<p>OXFORD YOUTH <i>[furiously]</i> Dont noble lord me: you are only
doing it to rattle me. Well, you cant rattle me. But it makes me sick
to see you rolling in luxury and think of what these poor chaps and
their women folk are suffering.</p>

<p>SIR ARTHUR. I am not rolling, Toffy--I think that is what Miss
Brollikins called you. <i>[To Aloysia]</i> Toffy is a diminutive of
Toff, is it not, Miss Brollikins?</p>

<p>OXFORD YOUTH. Yah! Now you have something silly to talk about, youre
happy. But I know what would make you sit up and do something.</p>

<p>SIR ARTHUR. Indeed? Thats interesting. May I ask what?</p>

<p>OXFORD YOUTH. Break your bloody windows.</p>

<p>THE MAYOR. Order! order!</p>

<p>ALOYSIA. Come, Toffy! you promised not to use any of your West End
language here. You know we dont like it.</p>

<p>SIR ARTHUR. Thats right, Miss Brollikins: snub him. He is disgracing
his class. As a humble representative of that class I apologize for him
to the Isle of Cats. I apologize for his dress, for his manners, for
his language. He must shock you every time he opens his mouth.</p>

<p>BLEE. We working folks know too much of bad language and bad manners
to see any fun in them or think they can do any good.</p>

<p>THE MAYOR. Thats right.</p>

<p>ALOYSIA. We are as tired of bad manners as Toffy is tired of good
manners. We brought Toffy here, Sir Arthur, because we knew he'd speak
to you as a dock laborer would speak to you if his good manners would
let him. And he's right, you know. He's rude; but he's right.</p>

<p>OXFORD YOUTH. Yours devotedly, Brolly. And what has his Right
Honorable nibs to say to that?</p>

<p>SIR ARTHUR <i>[concentrating himself on his adversary in the House
of Commons manner]</i> I will tell the noble lord what I have to say.
He may marshal his friends the unemployed and break every window in the
West End, beginning with every pane of glass in this house. What will
he gain by it? Next day a score or so of his followers will be in
prison with their heads broken. A few ignorant and cowardly people who
have still any money to spare will send it to the funds for the relief
of distress, imagining that they are ransoming their riches. You,
ladies and gentlemen, will have to put your hands in your pockets to
support the wives and children of the men in prison, and to pay cheap
lawyers to put up perfectly useless defences for them in the police
courts. And then, I suppose, the noble lord will boast that he has made
me do something at last. What can I do? Do you suppose that I care less
about the sufferings of the poor than you? Do you suppose I would not
revive trade and put an end to it all tomorrow if I could? But I am
like yourself: I am in the grip of economic forces that are beyond
human control. What mortal men could do this Government has done. We
have saved the people from starvation by stretching unemployment
benefit to the utmost limit of our national resources. We--</p>

<p>OXFORD YOUTH. You have cut it down to fifteen bob a week and shoved
every man you could off it with your beastly means test.</p>

<p>SIR ARTHUR <i>[fiercely]</i> What do you propose? Will you take my
place and put the dole up to five pounds a week without any means
test?</p>

<p>THE MAYOR. Order! order! Why are we here? We are here because we are
all sick of arguing and talking, and we want something doing. And here
we are arguing and talking just as if it was an all night sitting of
the Borough Council about an item of three-and-six for refreshments. If
you, Sir Arthur, tell us that you cant find work for our people we are
only wasting your time and our own, sitting here.</p>

<p><i>He rises. The rest, except Hipney, follow his example. Sir Arthur
is only too glad to rise too.</i></p>

<p>SIR ARTHUR. At least I hope I have convinced you about the windows,
Mr Mayor.</p>

<p>THE MAYOR. We needed no convincing. More crockery than windows will
have to be broken if you gentlemen can do nothing to get us out of our
present mess. But some people will say that a few thousand more to the
relief funds is better than nothing. And some of the unemployed are
glaziers.</p>

<p>SIR ARTHUR. Let us close our little talk on a more hopeful note. I
assure you it has been intensely interesting to me; and I may tell you
that signs of a revival of trade are not wholly wanting. Some of the
best informed city authorities are of opinion that this year will see
the end of the crisis. Some of them even hold that trade is already
reviving. By the last returns the export of Spanish onions has again
reached the 1913 level.</p>

<p>OXFORD YOUTH. Holy Jerusalem! Spanish onions! Come on, Brolly.
<i>[He goes out].</i></p>

<p>THE MAYOR. Weve got nothing out of this. We dont run to Spanish in
the Isle. <i>[Resignedly]</i> Good morning. <i>[He goes out].</i></p>

<p>SIR ARTHUR <i>[winningly]</i> And do you, Miss Brollikins, feel that
you have got nothing?</p>

<p>ALOYSIA. I feel what they feel. And I dont believe you feel anything
at all. <i>[She goes out, followed by Blee].</i></p>

<p>BLEE <i>[turning at the door]</i> The Mayor's wrong. Weve got
something all right.</p>

<p>SIR ARTHUR <i>[brightening]</i> Indeed? What is it?</p>

<p>BLEE <i>[with intense contempt]</i> Your measure. <i>[He goes
out].</i></p>

<p><i>The Prime Minister, nettled by this gibe, resumes his seat
angrily and pushes the bluebook out of his way. Then he notices that
old Hipney has not budged from his seat at the secretary's
bureau.</i></p>

<p>SIR ARTHUR. The deputation has withdrawn. Mr Hipney.</p>

<p>HIPNEY <i>[rising and coming to a chair at Sir Arthur's elbow, in
which he makes himself comfortable with a disarmingly pleasant air of
beginning the business instead of ending it]</i> Yes: now we can talk a
bit. I been at this game now for fifty year.</p>

<p>SIR ARTHUR <i>[interested in spite of himself]</i> What game?
Deputations?</p>

<p>HIPNEY. Unemployed deputations. This is my twelfth.</p>

<p>SIR ARTHUR. As many as that! But these crises dont come oftener than
every ten years, do they?</p>

<p>HIPNEY. Not what you would call a crisis, perhaps. But unemployment
is chronic.</p>

<p>SIR ARTHUR. It always blows over, doesnt it? Trade revives.</p>

<p>HIPNEY. It used to. We was the workshop of the world then. But you
gentlemen went out of the workshop business to make a war. And while
that was going on our customers had to find out how to make things for
themselves. Now we shall have to be their customers when weve any money
to buy with.</p>

<p>SIR ARTHUR. No doubt that has occurred to some extent; but there is
still an immense fringe of the human race growing up to a sense of the
necessity for British goods.</p>

<p>HIPNEY. All goods is alike to that lot provided theyre the cheapest.
They tell me the Italians are tapping their volcanoes for cheap power.
We dont seem able to tap nothing. The east is chock full of volcanoes:
they think no more of an earthquake there than you would of a
deputation. A Chinese coolie can live on a penny a day. What can we do
against labor at a penny a day and power for next to nothing out of the
burning bowels of the earth?</p>

<p>SIR ARTHUR. Too true, Mr Hipney. Our workers must make
sacrifices.</p>

<p>HIPNEY. They will if you drive em to it, Srarthur. But it's you
theyll sacrifice.</p>

<p>SIR ARTHUR. Oh come, Mr Hipney! you are a man of sense and
experience. What good would it do them to sacrifice me?</p>

<p>HIPNEY. Not a bit in the world, sir. But that wont stop them. Look
at your self. Look at your conferences! Look at your debates! They dont
do no good. But you keep on holding them. It's a sort of satisfaction
to you when you feel helpless. Well, sir, if you come to helplessness
there isnt on God's earth a creature more helpless than what our
factories and machines have made of an English working man when nobody
will give him a job and pay him to do it. And when he gets it what does
he understand of it? Just nothing. Where did the material that he does
his little bit of a job on come from? He dont know. What will happen to
it when it goes out of the factory after he and his like have all done
their little bits of jobs on it? He dont know. Where could he buy it if
it stopped coming to him? He dont know. Where could he sell it if it
was left on his hands? He dont know. He dont know nothing of the
business that his life depends on. Turn a cat loose and itll feed
itself. Turn an English working man loose and he'll starve. You have to
buy him off with a scrap of dole to prevent him saying "Well, if I'm to
die I may as well have the satisfaction of seeing you die first."</p>

<p>SIR ARTHUR. But--I really must press the point--what good will that
do him?</p>

<p>HIPNEY. What good does backing horses do him? What good does
drinking do him? What good does going to political meetings do him?
What good does going to church do him? Not a scrap. But he keeps on
doing them all the same.</p>

<p>SIR ARTHUR. But surely you recognize, Mr Hipney, that all this is
thoroughly wrong--wrong in feeling--contrary to English instincts--out
of character, if I may put it that way.</p>

<p>HIPNEY. Well, Srarthur, whatever's wrong you and your like have
taken on yourselves the job of setting it right. I havnt: I'm only a
poor man: a nobody, as you might say.</p>

<p>SIR ARTHUR. I have not taken anything on myself, Mr Hipney. I have
chosen a parliamentary career, and found it, let me tell you, a very
arduous and trying one: I might almost say a heartbreaking one. I have
just had to promise my wife to see a doctor for brain fag. But that
does not mean that I have taken it on myself to bring about the
millennium.</p>

<p>HIPNEY <i>[soothingly]</i> Just so, Srarthur: just so. It tries you
and worries you, and breaks your heart and does no good; but you keep
on doing it. Theyve often wanted me to go into Parliament. And I could
win the seat. Put up old Hipney for the Isle of Cats and your best man
wouldnt have a chance against him. But not me: I know too much. It
would be the end of me, as it's been the end of all the Labor men that
have done it. The Cabinet is full of Labor men that started as red-hot
Socialists; and what change has it made except that theyre in and out
at Bucknam Palace like peers of the realm?</p>

<p>SIR ARTHUR. You ought to be in Parliament, Mr Hipney. You have the
making of a first-rate debater in you.</p>

<p>HIPNEY. Psha! An old street corner speaker like me can debate the
heads off you parliamentary gentlemen. You stick your thumbs in your
waistcoat holes and wait half an hour between every sentence to think
of what to say next; and you call that debating. If I did that in the
Isle not a man would stop to listen to me. Mind you, I know you mean it
as a compliment that I'd make a good parliamentary debater. I
appreciate it. But people dont look to Parliament for talk nowadays:
that game is up. Not like it was in old Gladstone's time, eh?</p>

<p>SIR ARTHUR. Parliament, Mr Hipney, is what the people of England
have made it. For good or evil we have committed ourselves to
democracy. I am here because the people have sent me here.</p>

<p>HIPNEY. Just so. Thats all the use they could make of the vote when
they got it. Their hopes was in you; and your hopes is in Spanish
onions. What a world it is, aint it, Srarthur?</p>

<p>SIR ARTHUR. We must educate our voters, Mr Hipney. Education will
teach them to understand.</p>

<p>HIPNEY. Dont deceive yourself, Srarthur: you cant teach people
anything they dont want to know. Old Dr Marx--Karl Marx they call him
now--my father knew him well--thought that when he'd explained the
Capitalist System to the working classes of Europe theyd unite and
overthrow it. Fifty years after he founded his Red International the
working classes of Europe rose up and shot one another down and blew
one another to bits, and turned millions and millions of their infant
children out to starve in the snow or steal and beg in the sunshine, as
if Dr Marx had never been born. And theyd do it again tomorrow if they
was set on to do it. Why did you set them on? All they wanted was to be
given their job, and fed and made comfortable according to their notion
of comfort. If youd done that for them you wouldnt be having all this
trouble. But you werent equal to it; and now the fat's in the fire.</p>

<p>SIR ARTHUR. But the Government is not responsible for that. The
Government cannot compel traders to buy goods that they cannot sell.
The Government cannot compel manufacturers to produce goods that the
traders will not buy. Without demand there can be no supply.</p>

<p>HIPNEY. Theres a powerful demand just now, if demand is what you are
looking for.</p>

<p>SIR ARTHUR. Can you point out exactly where, Mr Hipney?</p>

<p>HIPNEY. In our children's bellies, Srarthur. And in our own.</p>

<p>SIR ARTHUR. That is not an effective demand, Mr. Hipney. I wish I
had time to explain to you the inexorable laws of political economy.
I--</p>

<p>HIPNEY <i>[interrupting him confidentially]</i> No use, Srarthur.
That game is up. That stuff you learnt at college, that gave you such
confidence in yourself, wont go down with my lot.</p>

<p>SIR ARTHUR <i>[smiling]</i> What is the use of saying that economic
science and natural laws wont go down, Mr Hipney? You might as well say
that the cold of winter wont go down.</p>

<p>HIPNEY. You see, you havnt read Karl Marx, have you?</p>

<p>SIR ARTHUR. Mr Hipney, when the Astronomer Royal tells me that it is
twelve o'clock by Greenwich time I do not ask him whether he has read
the nonsense of the latest flat earth man. I have something better to
do with my time than to read the ravings of a half-educated German
Communist. I am sorry you have wasted your own time reading such
stuff.</p>

<p>HIPNEY. Me read Marx! Bless you, Srarthur, I am like you: I talk
about the old doctor without ever having read a word of him. But I know
what that man did for them as did read him.</p>

<p>SIR ARTHUR. Turned their heads, eh?</p>

<p>HIPNEY. Just that, Srarthur. Turned their heads. Turned them right
round the other way to yours. I dont know whether what Marx said was
right or wrong, because I dont know what he said. But I know that he
puts into every man and woman that does read him a conceit that they
know all about political economy and can look down on the stuff you
were taught at college as ignorant oldfashioned trash. Look at that
girl Aloysia Brollikins! Her father was a basket maker in Spitalfields.
She's full of Marx. And as to examinations and scholarships and
certificates and gold medals and the like, she's won enough of them to
last your whole family for two generations. She can win them in her
sleep. Look at Blee! His father was a cooper. But he managed to go
through Ruskin College. You start him paying out Marx, and proving by
the materialist theory of history that Capitalism is bound to develop
into Communism, and that whoever doesnt know it is an ignorant nobody
or a half-educated college fool; and youll realize that your college
conceit is up against a Marxist conceit that beats anything you ever
felt for cocksureness and despising the people that havnt got it. Look
across Europe if you dont believe me. It was that conceit, sir, that
nerved them Russians to go through with their Communism in 1917.</p>

<p>SIR ARTHUR. I must read Marx, Mr Hipney. I knew I had to deal with a
sentimental revolt against unemployment. I had no idea that it had
academic pretensions.</p>

<p>HIPNEY. Lord bless you, Srarthur, the Labor movement is rotten with
book learning; and your people dont seem ever to read anything. When
did an undersecretary ever sit up half the night after a hard day's
work to read Karl Marx or anyone else? No fear. Your hearts are not in
your education; but our young people lift themselves out of the gutter
with it. Thats how you can shoot and you can ride and you can play
golf; and some of you can talk the hind leg off a donkey; but when it
comes to book learning Aloysia and Blee can wipe the floor with
you.</p>

<p>SIR ARTHUR. I find it hard to believe that the Mayor ever burnt the
midnight oil reading Marx.</p>

<p>HIPNEY. No more he didnt. But he has to pretend to, same as your
people have to pretend to understand the gold standard.</p>

<p>SIR ARTHUR <i>[laughing frankly]</i> You have us there, Mr Hipney. I
can make neither head nor tail of it; and I dont pretend to.</p>

<p>HIPNEY. Did you know the Mayor well, Srarthur? You called him your
old friend Tom.</p>

<p>SIR ARTHUR. He took the chair for me once at an election meeting. He
has an artificial tooth that looks as if it were made of zinc. I
remembered him by that. <i>[Genially--rising].</i> What humbugs we
Prime Ministers have to be, Mr Hipney! You know: dont you? <i>[He
offers his hand to signify that the conversation is over].</i></p>

<p>MR HIPNEY <i>[rising and taking it rather pityingly]</i> Bless your
innocence, Srarthur, you dont know what humbug is yet. Wait til youre a
Labor leader. <i>[He winks at his host and makes for the door].</i></p>

<p>SIR ARTHUR. Ha ha! Ha ha ha! Goodbye, Mr Hipney: goodbye. Very good
of you to have given me so much of your time.</p>

<p>HIPNEY. Youre welcome to it, Srarthur. Goodbye. <i>[He goes
out].</i></p>

<p><i>Sir Arthur presses a button to summon Hilda. Then he looks at his
watch, and whistles, startled to find how late it is. Hilda comes in
quickly through the masked door.</i></p>

<p>SIR ARTHUR. Do you know how late it is? To work! work! work! work!
Come along.</p>

<p>HILDA. I am afraid you cant do any work before you start for the
Church House lunch. The whole morning is gone with those people from
the Isle of Cats.</p>

<p>SIR ARTHUR. But I have mountains of work to get through. With one
thing and another I havnt been able to do a thing for the last three
weeks; and it accumulates and accumulates. It will crush me if I dont
clear it off before it becomes impossible.</p>

<p>HILDA. But I keep telling you, Sir Arthur, that if you will talk to
everybody for half an hour instead of letting me get rid of them for
you in two minutes, what can you expect? You say you havent attended to
anything for three weeks; but really you havnt attended to anything
since the session began. I hate to say anything; but really, when those
Isle of Cats people took themselves off your hands almost
providentially, to let that ridiculous old man talk to you for an
hour--! <i>[She sits down angrily].</i></p>

<p>SIR ARTHUR. Nonsense! he didnt stay two minutes; and I got a lot out
of him. What about the letters this morning?</p>

<p>HILDA. I have dealt with them: you neednt bother. There are two or
three important ones that you ought to answer: I have put them aside
for you when you have time.</p>

<p><i>Flavia and David dash into the room through the masked door even
more excited and obstreperous than before, Flavia to her father's
right, David to his left.</i></p>

<p>FLAVIA. Papa: weve been to a meeting of the unemployed with Aloysia
and Toffy.</p>

<p>DAVID. Such a lark!</p>

<p>FLAVIA. We saw a police charge. David was arrested.</p>

<p>SIR ARTHUR. Do you mean to say that you went with those people who
were here?</p>

<p>FLAVIA. Yes: theyve come back to lunch with us.</p>

<p>SIR ARTHUR. To lunch!!!</p>

<p>DAVID. Yes. I say: Aloysia's a marvellous girl.</p>

<p>SIR ARTHUR <i>[determinedly]</i> I dont mind the girl; but if that
young whelp is coming to lunch here he must and shall change his
clothes.</p>

<p>DAVID. He's gone home to change and shave: he's dotty on Flavia.</p>

<p>SIR ARTHUR. Why am I afflicted with such children? Tell me at once
what you have been doing. What happened?</p>

<p>DAVID. The police brought the Chancellor of the Exchequer to make a
speech to the unemployed to quiet them. The first thing we heard him
say was "Gentlemen: be patient. I promise you you will soon see the one
thing that can revive our industries and save our beloved country: a
rise in prices." The mob just gave one howl and went for him. Then the
police drew their batons and charged.</p>

<p>FLAVIA. Davy couldnt stand the way the people were knocked about. He
screamed to them to stand. The inspector collared him.</p>

<p>SIR ARTHUR. Of course he did. Quite right. Such folly! <i>[To
David]</i> How do you come to be here if you were arrested? Who bailed
you?</p>

<p>DAVID. I asked the inspector who in hell he thought he was talking
to. Then Flavia cut in and told him who we were and that old Basham was
like a father to us. All he said was "You go home, sir; and take your
sister with you. This is no place for you." So as I was rather in a
funk by that time we collected Aloysia and Toffy and bunked for
home.</p>

<p>SIR ARTHUR. I have a great mind to have that inspector severely
reprimanded for letting you go. Three months would have done you a lot
of good. Go back to the drawing room, both of you, and entertain your
new friends. You know you are not allowed to come in here when I am at
work. Be off with you. <i>[He goes back to his seat].</i></p>

<p>FLAVIA. Well, what are we to do? Mamma sends us in on purpose to
interrupt you when she thinks you have done enough.</p>

<p>DAVID. She says it's all we're good for.</p>

<p>SIR ARTHUR. A Prime Minister should have no children. Will you get
out, both of you; or must I ring for Burton to throw you out?</p>

<p>FLAVIA. Mamma says you are to lunch, Hilda. She wants another woman
to make up the party.</p>

<p>HILDA. Oh dear! <i>[rising]</i> You must excuse me, Sir Arthur: I
must telephone to put off some people who were coming to lunch with me
at The Apple Cart. And I must change my frock.</p>

<p>FLAVIA <i>[squabbling]</i> You neednt dress up for Brollikins, need
you?</p>

<p>DAVID. You let Aloysia alone. You dont want Hilda to dress up for
Barking, I suppose.</p>

<p>SIR ARTHUR <i>[out of patience]</i> Get out. Do you hear? Get out,
the lot of you.</p>

<p>HILDA. Do come, Miss Chavender. Your father is very busy.</p>

<p>SIR ARTHUR <i>[furious]</i> Get OUT.</p>

<p><i>They retreat precipitately through the masked door. Sir Arthur,
left alone, rests his wearied head on the table between his
arms.</i></p>

<p>SIR ARTHUR. At last, a moment's peace.</p>

<p><i>The word rouses the orator in him. He raises his head and repeats
it interrogatively; then tries its effect sweetly and solemnly again
and again.</i></p>

<p>SIR ARTHUR. Peace? . . . Peace. Peace. Peace. Peace. Peace. <i>[Now
perfectly in tune]</i> "Yes, your Grace, my lords and gentlemen, my
clerical friends. We need peace. We English are still what we were when
time-honored Lancaster described us as 'This happy breed of men.' We
are above all a domestic nation. On occasion we can be as terrible in
war as we have always been wise and moderate in counsel. But here, in
this Church House, under the banner of the Prince of Peace, we know
that the heart of England is the English home. Not the battlefield but
the fireside--yes, your Grace, yes, my lords and gentlemen, yes, my
clerical friends, the fire--"</p>

<p><i>He starts violently as his eye, sweeping round the imaginary
assembly, lights on a woman in grey robes contemplating him gravely and
pityingly. She has stolen in noiselessly through the masked
door.</i></p>

<p>SIR ARTHUR. Ffffff!!! Who is that? Who are you? Oh, I beg your
pardon. You gave me such a--Whew!! <i>[He sinks back into his
chair]</i> I didnt know there was anyone in the room.</p>

<p><i>The lady neither moves nor speaks. She looks at him with
deepening pity. He looks at her, still badly scared. He rubs his eyes;
shakes himself; looks again.</i></p>

<p>SIR ARTHUR. Excuse me; but are you real?</p>

<p>THE LADY. Yes.</p>

<p>SIR ARTHUR. I wish youd do something real. Wont you sit down?</p>

<p>THE LADY. Thank you. <i>[She sits down, very uncannily as it seems
to him, in Basham's chair].</i></p>

<p>SIR ARTHUR. Will you be so good as to introduce yourself? Who are
you?</p>

<p>THE LADY. A messenger.</p>

<p>SIR ARTHUR. Please do not be enigmatic. My nerves are all in rags. I
did not see you come in. You appeared there suddenly looking like a
messenger of death. And now you tell me you are a messenger.</p>

<p>THE LADY. Yes: a messenger of death.</p>

<p>SIR ARTHUR. I thought so. <i>[With sudden misgiving]</i> You mean my
death, I hope. Not my wife nor any of the children?</p>

<p>THE LADY <i>[smiling kindly]</i> No. Your death.</p>

<p>SIR ARTHUR <i>[relieved]</i> Well, thats all right.</p>

<p>THE LADY. You are going to die.</p>

<p>SIR ARTHUR. So are we all. The only question is, how soon?</p>

<p>THE LADY. Too soon. You are half dead already. You have been dying a
long time.</p>

<p>SIR ARTHUR. Well, I knew I was overworking: burning the candle at
both ends: killing myself. It doesnt matter. I have made my will.
Everything is provided for: my wife will be comfortably off; and the
children will have as much as is good for them.</p>

<p>THE LADY. You are resigned?</p>

<p>SIR ARTHUR. No; but I cannot help myself.</p>

<p>THE LADY. Perhaps I can help you. I am not only a messenger. I am a
healer.</p>

<p>SIR ARTHUR. A what?</p>

<p>THE LADY. A healer. One who heals the sick. One who holds off death
until he is welcome in his proper time.</p>

<p>SIR ARTHUR. You cannot help me. I am caught in the wheels of a
merciless political machine. The political machine will not stop for
you. It has ground many men to pieces before their time; and it will
grind me.</p>

<p>THE LADY. My business is with life and death, not with political
machinery.</p>

<p>SIR ARTHUR. In that case I am afraid you can be of no use to me; so
will you think it very uncivil of me if I go on with my work?</p>

<p>THE LADY. Shall I vanish?</p>

<p>SIR ARTHUR. Not unless you have something else to do. As you are a
ghost, and therefore not in time but in eternity, another ten minutes
or so wont cost you anything. Somehow, your presence is helping me. A
presence is a wonderful thing. Would you mind sitting there and reading
The Times while I work?</p>

<p>THE LADY. I never read the newspapers. I read men and women. I will
sit here and read you. Or will that make you self-conscious?</p>

<p>SIR ARTHUR. My dear ghost, a public man is so accustomed to people
staring at him that he very soon has no self to be conscious of. You
wont upset me in the least. You may even throw in a round of applause
occasionally; so that I may find out the effective bits to work up.</p>

<p>THE LADY. Go on. I will wait as long as you like.</p>

<p>SIR ARTHUR. Thank you. Now let me see where I was when you appeared.
<i>[He takes up a scrap of paper on which he has made a
memorandum].</i> Ah yes: Ive got it. Peace. Yes: peace. <i>[Trying to
make out a word]</i> Ence--ence--what? Oh, ensue! Of course: a good
word. "My friends, lay and clerical, we must ensue peace. Yes, ensue
peace. Peace. Disarmament." A burst of Pacifist applause there,
perhaps. "Who says that we need a hundred battleships, gentlemen?
Christian brotherhood is a safer defence than a thousand battleships.
You have my pledge that the Government will be quite content
with--with--" oh, well, my secretary will fill that in with whatever
number of ships the Japanese are standing out for. By the way, do you
think battleships are any real use now? Kenworthy says theyre not: and
he was in the navy. It would be such a tremendous score for us at
Geneva if we offered to scrap all our battleships. We could make up for
them in aeroplanes and submarines. I should like to have the opinion of
an impartial and disinterested ghost.</p>

<p>THE LADY. As I listen to you I seem to hear a ghost preparing a
speech for his fellow ghosts, ghosts from a long dead past. To me it
means nothing, because I am a ghost from the future.</p>

<p>SIR ARTHUR. Thats a curious idea. Of course if there are ghosts from
the past there must be ghosts from the future.</p>

<p>THE LADY. Yes: women and men who are ahead of their time. They alone
can lead the present into the future. They are ghosts from the future.
The ghosts from the past are those who are behind the times, and can
only drag the present back.</p>

<p>SIR ARTHUR. What an excellent definition of a Conservative! Thank
Heaven I am a Liberal!</p>

<p>THE LADY. You mean that you make speeches about Progress and Liberty
instead of about King and Country.</p>

<p>SIR ARTHUR. Of course I make speeches: that is the business of a
politician. Dont you like speeches?</p>

<p>THE LADY. On the Great Day of Judgment the speech-makers will stand
with the seducers and the ravishers, with the traffickers in maddening
drugs, with those who make men drunk and rob them, who entice children
and violate them.</p>

<p>SIR ARTHUR. What nonsense! Our sermons and speeches are the glories
of our literature, and the inspired voices of our religion, our
patriotism, and--of course--our politics.</p>

<p>THE LADY. Sermons and speeches are not religion, not patriotism, not
politics: they are only the gibbering of ghosts from the past. You are
a ghost from a very dead past. Why do you not die your bodily death? Is
it fair for a ghost to go about with a live body?</p>

<p>SIR ARTHUR. This is too personal. I am afraid I cannot get on with
my speech while you are there ordering my funeral. Oblige me by
vanishing. Go. Disappear. Shoo!</p>

<p>THE LADY. I cannot vanish. <i>[Merrily changing her attitude].</i>
Shall we stop playing at ghosts, and accept one another for convenience
sake as real people?</p>

<p>SIR ARTHUR <i>[shaking off his dreaminess]</i> Yes, lets. <i>[He
rises and comes to her].</i> We have been talking nonsense. <i>[He
pulls out a chair. They sit close together].</i> You had me half
hypnotized. But first, shake hands. I want to feel that you are
real.</p>

<p><i>He offers his right hand. She seizes both his hands and holds
them vigorously, looking straight into his eyes.</i></p>

<p>SIR ARTHUR <i>[brightening]</i> Well, I dont know whether this is
real or not; but it's electric, and very soothing and jolly. Ah-a-a-ah!
<i>[a deep sighing breath].</i> And now my dear lady, will you be good
enough to tell me who the devil you are?</p>

<p>THE LADY <i>[releasing him]</i> Only your wife's lady doctor. Did
she not tell you to expect me?</p>

<p>SIR ARTHUR. Of course, of course. How stupid of me! Yes, yes, yes,
yes, yes, to be sure. And now I am going to be frank with you. I dont
believe in doctors. Neither does my wife; but her faith in quacks is
unlimited. And as I am on the verge of a nervous breakdown, she is
planting every possible variety of quack on me--you will excuse the
expression?--</p>

<p>THE LADY. I excuse everything from my patients. Go on.</p>

<p>SIR ARTHUR. Well, I receive them all as I am receiving you, just to
gratify her, or rather to prevent her from making my life miserable.
They all say the same obvious thing; and they are none of them of the
slightest use. You are going to say it all over again. Can you forgive
me for saying flatly that I will not pay you twenty guineas for saying
it: not if you said it twenty times over?</p>

<p>THE LADY. Not even if I shew you how to cure yourself? The twenty
guineas is an important part of the cure. It will make you take it
seriously.</p>

<p>SIR ARTHUR. I know perfectly well how to cure myself. The cure is as
simple as abc. I am Prime Minister of Great Britain. That is, I am an
overworked, overworried, overstrained, overburdened, overdriven man,
suffering from late hours, irregular snatched meals, no time for
digestion nor for enough sleep, and having to keep my mind at full
stretch all the time struggling with problems that are no longer
national problems but world problems. In short, I am suffering acutely
from brain fag.</p>

<p>THE LADY. And the cure?</p>

<p>SIR ARTHUR. A fortnight's golf: thats the cure. I know it all by
heart. So suppose we drop it, and part friends. You see, I am really
frightfully busy.</p>

<p>THE LADY. That is not my diagnosis. <i>[She rises].</i> Goodbye.</p>

<p>SIR ARTHUR <i>[alarmed]</i> Diagnosis! Have you been diagnosing me?
Do you mean that there is something else the matter with me?</p>

<p>THE LADY. Not something else. Something different.</p>

<p>SIR ARTHUR. Sit down, pray: I can spare another two minutes. Whats
wrong?</p>

<p>THE LADY <i>[resuming her seat]</i> You are dying of an acute want
of mental exercise.</p>

<p>SIR ARTHUR <i>[unable to believe his ears]</i> Of--of--of WHAT, did
you say?</p>

<p>THE LADY. You are suffering from that very common English complaint,
an underworked brain. To put it in one word, a bad case of frivolity,
possibly incurable.</p>

<p>SIR ARTHUR. Frivolity! Did I understand you to say that frivolity is
a common English failing?</p>

<p>THE LADY. Yes. Terribly common. Almost a national
characteristic.</p>

<p>SIR ARTHUR. Do you realize that you are utterly mad?</p>

<p>THE LADY. Is it you or I who have piloted England on to the
rocks?</p>

<p>SIR ARTHUR. Come come! No politics. What do you prescribe for
me?</p>

<p>THE LADY. I take my patients into my retreat in the Welsh mountains,
formerly a monastery, now much stricter and perfectly sanitary. No
newspapers, no letters, no idle ladies. No books except in the
afternoon as a rest from thinking.</p>

<p>SIR ARTHUR. How can you think without books?</p>

<p>THE LADY. How can you have thoughts of your own when you are reading
other people's thoughts?</p>

<p>SIR ARTHUR <i>[groaning]</i> Oh, do talk sense. What about golf?</p>

<p>THE LADY. Games are for people who can neither read nor think. Men
trifle with their business and their politics; but they never trifle
with their games. Golf gives them at least a weekend of earnest
concentration. It brings truth home to them. They cannot pretend that
they have won when they have lost, nor that they made a magnificent
drive when they foozled it. The Englishman is at his best on the links,
and at his worst in the Cabinet. But what your country needs is not
your body but your mind. And I solemnly warn you that unless you
exercise your mind you will lose it. A brain underexercised is far more
injurious to health than an underexercised body. You know how men
become bone lazy for want of bodily exercise. Well, they become brain
lazy for want of mental exercise; and if nature meant them to be
thinkers the results are disastrous. All sorts of bodily diseases are
produced by half used minds; for it is the mind that makes the body:
that is my secret, and the secret of all the true healers. I am sorry
you will not allow me to take you a little on the way back to health
with me. Good morning. <i>[She rises].</i></p>

<p>SIR ARTHUR. Must you go?</p>

<p>THE LADY. Well, you are so busy--</p>

<p>SIR ARTHUR <i>[rising]</i> Ah yes: I forgot. I am frightfully busy.
Still, if you could spare another minute--</p>

<p>THE LADY. If you wish. <i>[She sits down].</i></p>

<p>SIR ARTHUR <i>[sitting down]</i> You see, what makes your diagnosis
so pricelessly funny to me is that as a matter of fact my life has been
a completely intellectual life, and my training the finest intellectual
training in the world. First rate preparatory school. Harrow. Oxford.
Parliament. An Undersecretaryship. The Cabinet. Finally the Leadership
of the House as Prime Minister. Intellect, intellect, all the time.</p>

<p>THE LADY. At Harrow you wrote Latin verses, did you not?</p>

<p>SIR ARTHUR. Yes, of Course.</p>

<p>THE LADY. Do you write any now?</p>

<p>SIR ARTHUR. No, of course not. You dont understand. We learnt to
write Latin verses not because the verses are any good--after all, it's
only a trick of stringing old tags together--but because it's such a
splendid training for the mind.</p>

<p>THE LADY. Have all the boys who made Latin verses at Harrow
splendidly trained minds?</p>

<p>SIR ARTHUR. Yes. I unhesitatingly say yes. I dont mean, of course,
that they are all geniuses; but if you go into the best society you
will see that their minds are far superior to those of persons who have
had no classical training.</p>

<p>THE LADY. You mean that they can all be trusted to say the same
thing in the same way when they discuss public affairs.</p>

<p>SIR ARTHUR. Precisely. They are an educated class, you see.</p>

<p>THE LADY <i>[coldly, rising]</i> Yes: I see. I have really nothing
more to say, Sir Arthur. <i>[She takes a card from her bag and puts it
on the table]</i> That is the address of my retreat in Wales.</p>

<p>SIR ARTHUR <i>[rising, rather disappointed at having produced no
effect]</i> But surely you cannot deny that a man is the better for
having been put through the mill of our great educational system.</p>

<p>THE LADY. If a man is born with a hopelessly bad set of teeth I
think it is better for him, and kinder to him, to pull them all out and
replace them with a good set of artificial teeth. If some of your
political colleagues had not been provided with artificial political
minds in the manner you described they would have been left without any
political minds at all. But in that case they would not have meddled in
politics; and that, I think, would have been a public advantage. May I
reserve a bedroom and a private study for you?</p>

<p>SIR ARTHUR. Pooh! I am not going to your retreat.</p>

<p>THE LADY <i>[steadfastly]</i> I think you are.</p>

<p>SIR ARTHUR. I give you up. You are factproof. I am lazy; I am idle;
and I am breaking down from overwork. How logical!</p>

<p>THE LADY. All the idlest and laziest of my patients slave from
morning to midnight trifling and tittle-tattling about great things. To
a retreat, Sir Arthur: get thee to a retreat. I am never mistaken in my
diagnosis. I shall telephone to ask whether my number one suite, with
private bath and meditation parlor, is vacant.</p>

<p>SIR ARTHUR. No: I wont be rushed. Do you hear? I wont be rushed.
<i>[She is quite unshaken; and he proceeds, much less resolutely]</i>
Of course I shall have to go somewhere for a rest; and if you could
really recommend it as a bracing place--</p>

<p>THE LADY. Bracing? What for?</p>

<p>SIR ARTHUR. Well, bracing, you know. Bracing.</p>

<p>THE LADY. Curious, how idle people are always clamouring to be
braced! Like trousers.</p>

<p>SIR ARTHUR. Idle people! How you stick to your point! And what a
humbug you are! Dont think you can impose on me with your meditation
parlor and your dignified airs: I do that sort of thing myself
occasionally; and you know it's no use giving tracts to a missionary.
But I feel somehow that you are good for me. You are a dear delightful
bighearted wrong-headed half-educated crazyboots; but a woman may be
all that and yet have the right instinct as to how to flirt
intellectually with a tired thinker. Will you promise to talk to me if
I come?</p>

<p>THE LADY. I will even let you talk to me. I guarantee that in a
fortnight you will begin to think before you talk. Your dead mind will
come to life. I shall make a man of you. Goodbye. <i>[She goes out
quickly through the main door].</i></p>

<p>SIR ARTHUR <i>[calling after her gaily]</i> Ha ha! Incorrigible,
incorrigible. <i>[He takes her card from the table, and contemplates
it].</i> Oh! I forgot to ask her how much a week she wants for that
meditation parlor. <i>[He looks tragic].</i></p>

<p>HILDA <i>[emerging from her office]</i> Anything the matter, Sir
Arthur?</p>

<p>SIR ARTHUR. I am going into a retreat. Because my brain is
underworked. Do you grasp that idea? Have you ever heard of a retreat
for the mentally underworked?</p>

<p>HILDA. There is a very nice one at Sevenoaks that my aunt was sent
to. But that is for inebriates.</p>

<p>SIR ARTHUR. The one I'm going to is for the mentally underworked,
the thoughtless and brainless, the inveterately lazy and frivolous.
Yes; the frivolous: your ears do not deceive you.</p>

<p>HILDA <i>[going to her desk]</i> Oh, well, theyll amuse you: you
always get on well with people of that sort. Shall I pack your usual
holiday books? some detective stories and Wordsworth?</p>

<p>SIR ARTHUR. No. You will procure all the books you can find by a
revolutionary German Jew named Harry Marks--</p>

<p>HILDA. Dont you mean Karl Marx?</p>

<p>SIR ARTHUR. Thats the man. Karl Marx. Get me every blessed book by
Karl Marx that you can find translated into English; and have them
packed for the retreat.</p>

<p>HILDA. There are much newer books by Marxists: Lenin and Trotsky and
Stalin and people like that.</p>

<p>SIR ARTHUR. Get them all. Pack the lot. By George, I'll teach
Alderwoman Aloysia Brollikins to give herself airs. I'll teach her and
her rabble of half-baked half-educated intellectual
beggars-on-horseback that any Oxford man can beat them at their own
silly game. I'll just turn Karl Marx inside-out for them. <i>[The
household gong sounds].</i> Lunch! Come on: that woman's given me an
appetite. <i>[He goes out impetuously through the masked door].</i></p>

<p>HILDA <i>[rushing after him]</i> No, no, Sir Arthur: the Church
House! the Church House! youve forgotten that you have to lunch at
<i>[her voice is lost in the distance].</i></p>

<h1><a name="a02">ACT II</a></h1>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p><i>The same scene on the 10th November at 9.30 in the morning. There
is a generous fire in the grate; and the visitors wear winter clothes.
Basham is on the hearthrug, warming his back and reading The Daily
Herald.</i></p>

<p> </p>

<p>BASHAM <i>[amazed by what he reads]</i> Gosh! <i>[He reads
further]</i> Wh-e-e-ew!! <i>[He reads still further]</i> Well I'll be
dashed!!!</p>

<p><i>Hilda enters through the main door, and announces an explosive
elderly gentleman, evidently a person of consequence, who follows
her.</i></p>

<p>HILDA. Sir Dexter Rightside.</p>

<p>SIR DEXTER <i>[joining Basham on the hearth]</i> Ah! That you,
Basham? Have you come to arrest him?</p>

<p>BASHAM. You may well ask. He isnt up yet. Miss Hanways: is there any
sign of his getting a move on?</p>

<p>HILDA <i>[much worried]</i> Lady Chavender wont allow him to be
disturbed. She says his speech last night at the Guildhall banquet
quite tired him out. People have been ringing up and calling all the
morning; but she just puts her back to his door and says that anyone
who makes noise enough to waken him leaves her service that minute.</p>

<p>SIR DEXTER. Nonsense! He must see me. Does Lady Chavender suppose
that a Prime Minister can stand the country on its head without a word
of warning to his colleagues and then go to bed as if he was tired out
by a day's fishing?</p>

<p>HILDA <i>[desperate]</i> Well, what can <i>I</i> do, Sir Dexter?
<i>[She goes to her bureau].</i></p>

<p>SIR DEXTER. Basham: go and break open his bedroom door.</p>

<p>BASHAM. I cant. I'm a policeman: I mustnt do it without a warrant.
Go and do it yourself.</p>

<p>SIR DEXTER. I have a devilish good mind to. Can you conceive
anything more monstrous, Basham? <i>[He sits down in the chair next the
end chair].</i> But I said that this would happen. I said so. When we
made this damned coalition that they call a National Government I was
entitled to the Prime Ministership. I was the Leader of the
Conservative Party. I had an enormous majority in the country: the
election proved that we could have done quite well without Chavender.
But I had to give way. He humbugged us. He pretended that without his
old guard of Liberals and his ragtag and bobtail of Labor men and
Socialists and lawyers and journalists-on-the-make and used-up trade
union secretaries, and all the rest of the democratic dregs of human
society, we couldnt be sure of a majority. His golden voice was to do
the trick. He was the popular man, the safe man: I was the unpopular
Die Hard who couldnt be trusted to keep my temper. So I stood down. I
sacrificed myself. I took the Foreign Secretaryship. Well, what price
your safe man now? How do you like your Bolshy Premier? Who was right?
the funkers and compromisers or the old Die Hard?</p>

<p>BASHAM. It's amazing. I could have sworn that if there was a safe
man in England that could be trusted to talk and say nothing, to thump
the table and do nothing, Arthur Chavender was that man. Whats happened
to him? What does it mean? Did he go mad at the sanatorium, do you
think? Or was he mad before that woman took him there?</p>

<p>SIR DEXTER. Mad! Not a bit of it. But you had better look up that
woman's record: there may be money from Moscow behind this.</p>

<p>BASHAM. Arthur take money! Thats going too far.</p>

<p>SIR DEXTER. The woman took the money. It would be waste of money to
bribe Chavender: you could always trust him to say whatever he thought
would please his audience without being paid for it: damned
mountebank.</p>

<p>BASHAM. But he didnt try to please his audience at the Guildhall.
They wanted some of his best soothing syrup about law and order after
the attack on the Lord Mayor's Show in the afternoon by the unemployed;
but according to The Daily Herald here he gave them a dose of boiling
Socialism instead.</p>

<p>SIR DEXTER <i>[nervously]</i> By the way, Basham, I hope you have
the unemployed well in hand today.</p>

<p>BASHAM. Quiet as lambs. Theyre all reading the papers. New editions
every half-hour. Like 1914 over again.</p>

<p><i>Sir Arthur's voice is heard, singing scales. Hilda looks
in.</i></p>

<p>HILDA. I think I hear Sir Arthur singing. He must have got up.</p>

<p>SIR DEXTER. Singing! Is this a moment for minstrelsy?</p>

<p>HILDA. He always sings scales after his bath <i>[she
vanishes].</i></p>

<p><i>After a final burst of solfeggi the masked door is opened
vigorously and Chavender enters beaming.</i></p>

<p>SIR ARTHUR. Ah, here you are, Dexy <i>[he proffers his
hand].</i></p>

<p>SIR DEXTER <i>[like a baited bull]</i> Dont attempt to shake hands
with me. Dont dare call me Dexy.</p>

<p>SIR ARTHUR. What on earth's the matter? Got out at the wrong side of
the bed this morning, eh? Frightfully sorry to have kept you waiting,
Basham. Whats wrong with the Foreign Secretary this time?</p>

<p>SIR DEXTER. This time! What do you mean by this time?</p>

<p>SIR ARTHUR. Well theres nothing very novel about your turning up
before breakfast in a blazing rage, is there? What is it, Basham?</p>

<p>BASHAM. Oh come, P.M.! If you were too drunk last night at the
Guildhall to know what you were saying, youd better read the papers
<i>[he offers his paper].</i></p>

<p>SIR ARTHUR <i>[keeping his hands behind his back to warm them]</i> I
remember perfectly well what I said last night. And I drank nothing but
barley water.</p>

<p>BASHAM <i>[insisting]</i> But look at it man. <i>[Quoting the
headlines]</i> New program for winter session. Nationalization of
ground rents. Nationalization of banks. Nationalization of collieries.
Nationalization of transport.</p>

<p>SIR DEXTER <i>[moaning]</i> Nationalization of women. Why omit it?
Why omit it?</p>

<p>BASHAM. No: nothing about women. Municipalization of urban land and
the building trade, and consequent extinction of rates.</p>

<p>SIR DEXTER. Apostate!</p>

<p>BASHAM. No: nothing about the Church. Abolition of tariffs and
substitution of total prohibition of private foreign trade in protected
industries. State imports only, to be sold at State regulated
prices.</p>

<p>SIR DEXTER. Rot! Incomprehensible and unheard-of rot.</p>

<p>BASHAM. Compulsory public service for all, irrespective of income,
as in war time.</p>

<p>SIR DEXTER. Slavery. Call it by its proper name. Slavery.</p>

<p>BASHAM. Restoration of agriculture. Collective farming.
Nationalization of fertilizer industries. Nitrogen from the air. Power
from the tides. Britain self-supporting and blockade proof.</p>

<p>SIR DEXTER. Madness. Ruin to our foreign trade.</p>

<p>BASHAM. Ruthless extinction of parasitism.</p>

<p>SIR DEXTER. You dont even know the present law. You have the
Verminous Persons Act. What more do you want?</p>

<p>BASHAM. Doubling of the surtax on unearned incomes.</p>

<p>SIR DEXTER. Yes: take our last penny! And when the little that the
present ruinous taxation has left us is gone; when we have closed our
accounts with the last tradesman and turned the last servant into the
streets, where are they to find employment? Who is to pay their wages?
What is to become of religion when nobody can afford pewrents or a
penny to put in the plate? Even sport will not be safe: our breed of
horses will be doomed; our packs of hounds sold or slaughtered; and our
masters of hounds will be caddies on motor bicycles. That is to be
England's future!</p>

<p>SIR ARTHUR. But is that all the papers have reported?</p>

<p>SIR DEXTER. All!!!</p>

<p>BASHAM. Oh come! All! Isnt that about enough?</p>

<p>SIR ARTHUR. But have they said nothing about our promise to restore
the cuts made in the pay of the army and navy and police?</p>

<p>SIR DEXTER. Our promise! Whose promise?</p>

<p>BASHAM <i>[interested]</i> What was that you said? Are you going to
put my men's wages up to the old figure?</p>

<p>SIR ARTHUR. We shall give you another five thousand men; pay the old
wages with a rise of ten per cent; and double your salary.</p>

<p>BASHAM. Whew! That alters the case a bit.</p>

<p>SIR DEXTER <i>[rising]</i> Basham: you are not going to allow
yourself to be corrupted like this! Are you such a dupe as to imagine
that free Englishmen will tolerate such a monstrous waste of public
money?</p>

<p>BASHAM. If I have another five thousand men and a rise on the old
wages, I'll answer for the free Englishmen. If they dont like it they
can lump it.</p>

<p>SIR DEXTER. You really believe he can keep all the monstrous
promises he has made?</p>

<p>BASHAM. No: of course he cant. But he can keep this one. He can
raise the pay of the ranks and double my salary; and that is all that
concerns me. I'm a policeman, not a politician.</p>

<p>SIR DEXTER. Youre a mercenary gangster and a damned fool: thats what
you are. <i>[He flings himself into the end chair].</i></p>

<p>BASHAM <i>[calmly]</i> You seem ruffled, Sir Dexter.</p>

<p><i>Before Sir Dexter can reply, Hilda returns and announces a new
visitor.</i></p>

<p>HILDA. Admiral Sir Bemrose Hotspot. <i>[She goes out].</i></p>

<p><i>Sir Bemrose is a halfwitted admiral; but the half that has not
been sacrificed to his profession is sound and vigorous.</i></p>

<p>SIR BEMROSE <i>[in the breeziest spirits]</i> Morning, Dexy.
Morning, Basham. <i>[Slapping Sir Arthur on the back]</i> Splendid,
Arthur! Never heard you in better form. Thats the stuff to give em.
<i>[They shake hands cordially].</i></p>

<p>SIR DEXTER <i>[sobered by his astonishment]</i> Rosy: have you gone
mad too? Have you forgotten that you are a Conservative, and that it
was as a Conservative that you were made First Lord of the Admiralty,
at my personal suggestion and insistence, in this so-called National
Government, which now, thank Heaven, wont last one day after the next
meeting of Parliament?</p>

<p>SIR BEMROSE. Wont it, by Jove! It's safe for the next five years.
What the country wants is straight orders, discipline, character,
pluck, a big navy, justice for the British sailor, no sham
disarmaments, and absolute command of the sea. If that isnt
Conservatism what is Conservatism? But mind, Arthur, I must have twelve
new aeroplane-carrying battleships. I have my eye on Japan. And theres
America. And, of course, Russia.</p>

<p>SIR ARTHUR. You shall have them, Rosy. Twenty-four if you say the
word.</p>

<p>SIR BEMROSE. Good! Then I'll answer for the House of Commons.</p>

<p>SIR DEXTER. Dont be silly. What can you do with the House of
Commons, except empty it whenever you get up to speak?</p>

<p>SIR BEMROSE. I leave the speaking to Arthur: it's his job, not mine.
But if there is any further attempt to starve the navy it can give you
a little surprise at Westminster. How will you feel when you see a
submarine come to the surface off the terrace, and the commander sends
in word that he gives you just five minutes before he torpedoes the
whole damned Front Bench?</p>

<p>SIR DEXTER. You are talking ridiculous nonsense. Do you suppose for
a moment that the navy would be allowed to interfere in politics?</p>

<p>SIR BEMROSE. Who's to stop it? Where would Lenin and Stalin and
Trotsky and all that Bolshy lot have been without the Baltic fleet and
the Kronstadt sailors? Do you suppose the British navy, with its
discipline and its respectable Conservative commanders, couldnt do what
these Communist scoundrels did?</p>

<p>SIR DEXTER. How long would the British navy survive the abolition of
property in this country? tell me that.</p>

<p>SIR BEMROSE. Dont talk to the navy about property. We dont live by
property: we live by service. <i>[He takes the chair next to the
presidential one, and pursues his personal grievance angrily].</i> You
and your confounded property owners grudge us a clerk's salary for
commanding a battleship, and then dock a quarter off it for income tax.
We cant set foot on shore without being rented and rated until we can
hardly afford to educate our children. Thanks to Arthur, you are
pledged now to give us our pay honestly free of income tax and make
these lazy idle lubbers of landlords sweat for it. I call that the
essence of Conservatism. Thats the way to dish these Labor chaps and
Red flaggers and all the rest of the scum you have been pandering to
ever since you gave them the vote. Give them whats good for
them<i>;</i> and put their ballot papers behind the fire: thats what
this country needs.</p>

<p>SIR ARTHUR. You see, Dexy: we have the navy and the police on our
side.</p>

<p>SIR DEXTER. May I ask who are "we"?</p>

<p>SIR ARTHUR. Why, the National Government, of course. You and I,
Dexy: you and I.</p>

<p>SIR DEXTER. It makes me sick to hear you couple my name with yours.
It always did.</p>

<p>HILDA <i>[announcing]</i> The President of the Board of Trade. Mr
Glenmorison.</p>

<p><i>Glenmorison is an easy mannered Scottish gentleman, distinctly
the youngest of the party.</i></p>

<p>SIR ARTHUR. Hallo, Sandy. Sit down. Lets all sit down and have it
out.</p>

<p><i>They settle themselves at the table with their backs to the fire,
Sir Arthur in the middle, Glenmorison on his left, Sir Bemrose on his
right, and Sir Dexter and Basham right and left respectively.</i></p>

<p>GLENMORISON. Well, Sir Arthur, when you were letting yourself go so
recklessly you might have said a word about Home Rule for Scotland. We
may as well be hanged for a sheep as for a lamb.</p>

<p>SIR DEXTER. We! we! we! Who are we? If you mean the Cabinet, it is
not responsible for the Prime Minister's frantic proceedings. He acted
without consulting us. Do you suppose that if I had heard a word of
this outburst of Bolshevism I should have consented to it?</p>

<p>SIR ARTHUR. That was why I didnt consult you.</p>

<p>SIR DEXTER. Psha!</p>

<p>SIR ARTHUR. The responsibility is mine and mine alone.</p>

<p>SIR BEMROSE. Not at all. I claim my share, Arthur. You got the part
about the navy from me.</p>

<p>GLENMORISON. Same here, Sir Dexter. I claim at least two items.</p>

<p>SIR DEXTER. Much good may they do you. Arthur's seat is safe:
anybody named Chavender can get in unopposed in this constituency
because his cunning old father-in-law has every voter in the place
bribed up to the neck. But your majority at the last election was
seventeen: there were three recounts. Your seat's gone, anyhow.</p>

<p>GLENMORISON. On the contrary, Sir Dexter, it's safe for the first
time in the history of Scotland.</p>

<p>SIR DEXTER. Safe! How? You will get the boot as a crazy Bolshevik
unless you come out with me and repudiate Chavender promptly and
decisively.</p>

<p>GLENMORISON. Oh, I'm afraid I cant do that, Sir Dexter. You see, the
balance is held in my constituency by the tradesmen and shopkeepers.
Their great grievance is the heavy rates. And though they are all doing
middling well they think they could do better if they could raise
enough capital to extend their businesses a bit. But the financiers and
promoters wont look at small businesses. They are thinking in millions
while my people are thinking in thousands, and mostly in only four
figures at that. It's easy enough to get a couple of hundred thousand
pounds if you are willing to call it a quarter of a million and pay
interest on that sum. But what good is that to a man in the High Street
in my constituency who wants from five to twenty thousand to extend his
little business?</p>

<p>SIR DEXTER. Nonsense! The bank will give him an overdraft if his
credit is good.</p>

<p>GLENMORISON. Yes; and call it in at the next slump and panic on the
Stock Exchange. I can shew you half a dozen men who were forced into
bankruptcy in the last panic, though they were as solvent as you or I.
But Sir Arthur's proposal of panic-proof national and municipal banks,
as ready and eager to find five thousand for the five thousand man as
the financiers are to find a million on condition that enough of it
sticks to their own fingers, is just the thing for my people. I darent
say a word against it. It's an inspiration as far as my constituents
are concerned. Theyre a canny lot, my people: theyd vote for the devil
if he'd promise to abolish the rates and open a municipal bank. My
majority fell to seventeen last time because I went to them with empty
hands and a bellyful of advice to economize and make sacrifices. This
bank nationalization is good business for them: theyll just jump at
it.</p>

<p>SIR DEXTER. In short, you will make Utopian promises that you know
very well will never be carried out.</p>

<p>GLENMORISON. You made a lot of Utopian promises, Sir Dexter, when
you formed this National Government. Instead of carrying them out you
told the voters to tighten their belts and save the Bank of England.
They tightened their belts; and now the Bank of England is paying
twelve and sixpence in the pound. Still, I admit, you pulled down my
Liberal majority over my Conservative opponent from four thousand to
seventeen. Ive got to pull that up again. I say nothing about the rest
of the program; but I represent the small man; and on this bank
business I am with Sir Arthur all the time.</p>

<p>HILDA <i>[announcing]</i> Sir Jafna Pandranath. <i>[She
withdraws].</i></p>

<p><i>This announcement creates a marked sensation. All five gentlemen
rise as if to receive a royal personage. Sir Jafna is an elderly
Cingalese plutocrat, small and slender to the verge of emaciation,
elegantly dressed, but otherwise evidently too much occupied and
worried by making money to get any fun out of spending it. One guesses
that he must make a great deal of it; for the reverence with which he
is received by the five Britons, compared with their unceremonious
handling of one another, is almost sycophantic.</i></p>

<p>SIR JAFNA. Hallo! Am I breaking into a Cabinet meeting?</p>

<p>SIR ARTHUR. No: not a bit. Only a few friendly callers. Pray sit
down.</p>

<p>SIR DEXTER <i>[offering the end chair to the visitor]</i> You are
welcome, Sir Jafna: most welcome. You represent money; and money brings
fools to their senses.</p>

<p>SIR JAFNA. Money! Not at all. I am a poor man. I never know from one
moment to another whether I am worth thirteen millions or only three.
<i>[He sits down. They all sit down].</i></p>

<p>SIR BEMROSE. I happen to know, Sir Jafna, that your enterprises
stand at twenty millions today at the very least.</p>

<p>GLENMORISON. Fifty.</p>

<p>SIR JAFNA. How do you know? How do you know? The way I am plundered
at every turn! <i>[To Sir Dexter]</i> Your people take the shirt off my
back.</p>

<p>SIR DEXTER. My people! What on earth do you mean?</p>

<p>SIR JAFNA. Your land monopolists. Your blackmailers. Your robber
barons. Look at my Blayport Docks reconstruction scheme! Am I a public
benefactor or am I not? Have I not enough to live on and die on without
troubling myself about Blayport? Shall I be any the happier when it has
ten square miles of docks instead of a tuppeny-hapeny fishing harbor?
What have I to gain except the satisfaction of seeing a big publicly
useful thing well done, and the knowledge that without me it could not
be done? Shall I not be half ruined if it fails?</p>

<p>SIR BEMROSE. Well, whats wrong with it, old chap?</p>

<p>SIR JAFNA. Rosy: you make me puke. What is wrong with it is that the
owners of all the miles of land that are indispensable to my scheme,
and that without it would not be worth fifteen pounds an acre, are
opening their mouths so wide that they will grab sixty per cent of the
profit without lifting a finger except to pocket the wealth that I
shall create. I live, I work, I plan, I shatter my health and risk all
I possess only to enrich these parasites, these vampires, these vermin
in the commonwealth. <i>[Shrieking]</i> Yes: vermin! <i>[Subsiding]</i>
You were quite right at the Guildhall last night, Arthur: you must
nationalize the land and put a stop to this shameless exploitation of
the financiers and entrepreneurs by a useless, idle, and predatory
landed class.</p>

<p>SIR ARTHUR <i>[chuckling].</i> Magnificent! I have the support of
the City.</p>

<p>SIR JAFNA. To the last vote, to the last penny. These pirates think
nothing of extorting a million an acre for land in the city. A man
cannot have an address in London for his letters until he has agreed to
pay them from five hundred to a thousand a year. He cant even die
without paying them for a grave to lie in. Make them disgorge, Arthur.
Skin them alive. Tax them twenty shillings in the pound. Make them earn
their own living, damn them. <i>[He wipes his brow and adds, rather
hysterically]</i> Excuse me, boys; but if you saw the Blayport
estimates--! <i>[he can no more].</i></p>

<p>SIR DEXTER. May I ask you to address yourself to this question not
as an emotional oriental <i>[Sir Jafna chokes convulsively]</i> but as
a sane man of business. If you destroy the incomes of our landed gentry
where will you find the capital that exists solely through their
prudent saving--their abstinence?</p>

<p>SIR JAFNA. Bah pooh! Pooh bah! I will find it where they find it, in
the product of the labor I employ. At present I have to pay exorbitant
and unnecessary wages. Why? Because out of those wages the laborer has
to pay half or quarter as rent to the landlord. The laborer is
ignorant: he thinks he is robbed by the landlord; but the robbed victim
is me--ME! Get rid of the landlord and I shall have all the capital he
now steals. In addition I shall have cheap labor. That is not oriental
emotion: it is British Commonsense. I am with you, Arthur, to the last
drop of my oriental blood. Nationalized land: compulsory labor:
abolition of rates: strikes made criminal: I heartily endorse them all
in the name of Capital and private enterprise. I say nothing about the
rest of your program, Arthur; but on these points no true Liberal can
question your magnificent statesmanship.</p>

<p>SIR ARTHUR <i>[delighted]</i> You hear that, Dexy. Put that in your
pipe and smoke it.</p>

<p>HILDA <i>[announcing]</i> His Grace the Duke of Domesday. <i>[She
goes out].</i></p>

<p><i>An elderly delicately built aristocrat comes in. Well preserved,
but nearer 70 than 60.</i></p>

<p>THE DUKE <i>[surprised to see so many people]</i> Do I intrude,
Arthur? I thought you were disengaged.</p>

<p>SIR ARTHUR. Not at all. Only a talk over last night. Make yourself
at home.</p>

<p>SIR DEXTER. You come in the nick of time. Sir Jafna here has just
been qualifying you as a bloodsucker, a pirate, a parasite, a robber
baron and finally as vermin. Vermin! How do you like it?</p>

<p>THE DUKE <i>[calmly taking the end chair nearest the window, on
Basham's left]</i> I wonder why the epithet robber is applied only to
barons. You never hear of robber dukes; yet my people have done plenty
of robbery in their time. <i>[With a sigh of regret]</i> Ah, thats all
over now. The robbers have become the robbed. I wish you would create
some immediate class of honest folk. I dislike your calling me vermin,
Arthur.</p>

<p>SIR ARTHUR. I didnt. It was Jafna.</p>

<p>THE DUKE. Ungrateful Jafna! He is buying up my Blayport estate for
next to nothing.</p>

<p>SIR JAFNA. Next to nothing! Holy Brahma!</p>

<p>THE DUKE <i>[continuing]</i> He will make millions out of it. After
paying off the mortgages I shall get three and a half per cent on what
is left to me out of the beggarly price he offers; and on that three
and a half I shall be income-taxed and surtaxed. Jafna's grandsons will
go to Eton. Mine will go to a Polytechnic.</p>

<p>SIR BEMROSE. Send them to Dartmouth, old chap. Theres a career for
them in the navy now that Arthur is at the helm.</p>

<p>SIR DEXTER. A lieutenant's pay and pension for the future Duke of
Domesday! Thats the proposition, is it?</p>

<p>THE DUKE. He will be lucky to have any pay at all. But I shall
support you in any case, Arthur. You have at last publicly admitted
that the death duties are unsound in principle, and promised to abolish
them. That will save us from utter extinction in three generations; and
the landed classes are with you to the last man for it. Accept the
humble gratitude of a pauperized duke.</p>

<p>SIR DEXTER. And the rest of the program. Do you swallow that
too?</p>

<p>THE DUKE. I doubt if the rest of the program will come off. Besides,
I dont pretend to understand it. By the way, Sir Jafna, I wish you
would take Domesday Towers off my hands for a while. I cant afford to
live in it. I cant afford even to keep it dusted. You can have it for a
hundred a year.</p>

<p>SIR JAFNA. Too far from town.</p>

<p>THE DUKE. Not by aeroplane. Do think it over.</p>

<p><i>Sir Jafna shrugs his shoulders and intimates that it is hopeless.
The Duke resigns himself to the expected.</i></p>

<p>SIR ARTHUR. Dexy: you are in a minority of one. The landlords are on
my side. The capitalists, big and little, are on my side. The fighting
services are on my side. The police are on my side. If you leave us you
go out into the wilderness alone. What have you to say?</p>

<p>SIR DEXTER. I have to say that you are a parcel of blind fools. You
are trying to scuttle the ship on the chance of each of you grabbing a
share of the insurance money. But the Country will deal with you. The
Country does not want change. The Country never has wanted change. The
Country never will want change. And because I will resist change while
I have breath in my body I shall not be alone in England. You have all
deserted me and betrayed your party; but I warn you that though I am
utterly alone in this room . . .</p>

<p>HILDA <i>[reappearing]</i> The deputation, Sir Arthur. Theyve come
back. <i>[She vanishes].</i></p>

<p><i>The deputation enters. Hipney is not with them. Barking shaved,
brilliantly dressed, and quite transfigured, is jubilant. Aloysia glows
indignation. Blee and the Mayor, doggedly wearing their hats and
overcoats, are gloomy, angry, and resolute. They group themselves just
inside the door, glowering at the Prime Minister and his
colleagues.</i></p>

<p>SIR ARTHUR <i>[beaming]</i> Gentlemen: a Labor deputation from the
Isle of Cats. The one element that was lacking in our councils. You
have heard the voice of the peerage, of the city, of the King's forces.
You will now hear the voice of the proletariat. Sit down, ladies and
gentlemen.</p>

<p>THE MAYOR <i>[rudely]</i> Who are you calling the proletariat? Do
you take us for Communists? <i>[He remains standing].</i></p>

<p>ALOYSIA. What you are going to hear, Sir Arthur, is the voice of
Labor. <i>[She remains standing].</i></p>

<p>BLEE. The verdict of democracy. <i>[He remains standing].</i></p>

<p>EARL OF BARKING. The bleating of a bloody lot of fools. I am with
you, Chavender. <i>[He detaches himself from the group and flings
himself into Hilda' s chair with intense disgust].</i></p>

<p>SIR ARTHUR <i>[surprised]</i> Am I to understand that your
colleagues are against me?</p>

<p>THE MAYOR. Of course we're against you. Do you expect me to go back
to my people and tell them they should vote for compulsory labor and
doing away with strikes?</p>

<p>BLEE. Arnt the workers enslaved enough already without your
depriving them of that last scrap of their liberty? the only weapon
they have against the capitalists?</p>

<p>SIR ARTHUR. My dear Mr Mayor, what is the right to strike? The right
to starve on your enemy's doorstep and set the whole public against
you. Which of you starves first when it comes to the point?</p>

<p>THE MAYOR. I am not going to argue. You can beat me at that. But if
you think that the British working-man will listen to compulsory labor
and putting down strikes you dont know the world youre living in; and
thats all about it.</p>

<p>SIR ARTHUR. But we need not compel the workers to work: they are
working already. We shall compel the idlers. Not only your idlers but
our idlers: all the idle young gentlemen who do nothing but waste their
own time and your labor.</p>

<p>BLEE. We know. Keep all the soft jobs for your lot and the hard ones
for us. Do you take us for fools?</p>

<p>BARKING. He does. And you are fools.</p>

<p>SIR ARTHUR. I am glad to have your lordship's support.</p>

<p>ALOYSIA. Support your grandparents! He wants to marry your
daughter.</p>

<p>BARKING <i>[springing up]</i> Oh! You can hit below the belt,
Aloysia. But as a matter of fact, I do want to marry your daughter,
Chavender.</p>

<p>SIR ARTHUR. Hardly the moment to go into that now, is it?</p>

<p>BARKING. It was Aloysia and not I who let the cat out of the bag.
Being a cat herself she had a fellow-feeling for the animal. <i>[He
resumes his seat].</i></p>

<p>BLEE. Youre an aristocrat, young-fellow-me-lad. I always said that
when things got serious youd turn on us and side with your own.</p>

<p>BARKING. Rot! Youre always bragging that you are descended from the
Blee of Blayport, whoever he may have been. I shouldnt have tuppence in
my pocket if my grandfather hadnt made a fortune in pork pies and
bought my father's Norman title for his daughter with it. The blue
blood is in your skimpy little veins: the proletarian red's in
mine.</p>

<p>ALOYSIA. Youve too much money, Toffy.</p>

<p>BARKING. I havnt had all the pluck taken out of me by poverty, like
you chaps. And what good will it do me to have a lot of money when I
have to work like anyone else?</p>

<p>SIR DEXTER. Why should a man work like anyone else if he has
money?</p>

<p>BARKING. My brother had heaps of money; but he had to go into the
trenches and fight like anyone else in the war. Thats how I came into
the property.</p>

<p>BLEE. So we're all to be slaves for the sake of setting a few
loafers to work. The workers will die sooner than put up with it. I
want my liberty--</p>

<p>BARKING. Liberty to work fourteen hours a day and bring up three
children on thirtyfour shillings a week, like your brother the shopman.
To hell with your filthy liberty!</p>

<p>BLEE <i>[hotly]</i> I--</p>

<p>THE MAYOR. Order! order! Dont argue with him, Blee. No good ever
comes of arguing with college men. I'm not arguing with Sir Arthur: I'm
telling him. The long and the short of it is that if he dont withdraw
that silly new program he'll lose every vote in the Isle of Cats. And
what the Isle of Cats thinks today, all England thinks tomorrow.</p>

<p>SIR JAFNA. May I speak to this gentleman? Will you introduce me,
Arthur?</p>

<p>SIR ARTHUR <i>[introducing]</i> Sir Jafna Pandranath. The Mayor of
the Isle of Cats.</p>

<p>SIR JAFNA. You have heard of me, Mr Mayor. You know that I am a man
who knows what he is talking about. Well, I tell you that the
fundamental question is not the Labor question but the Land
Question.</p>

<p>THE MAYOR. Yes: we all know that.</p>

<p>SIR JAFNA. Then you will vote for Sir Arthur because he will
nationalize the land for you.</p>

<p>BLEE <i>[scornfully]</i> Yes, with compensation! Take the land with
one hand and give back its cash value to the landlords with the other!
Not likely. I ask again, do you take us for fools?</p>

<p>SIR ARTHUR <i>[introducing]</i> Mr Alderman Blee.</p>

<p>THE DUKE. Enchanted. I happen to be a landlord--a duke, in fact--and
I can assure you, Mr Alderman, that as the compensation will come out
of my own pocket and that of my unfortunate fellow landlords in the
form of income tax, surtax, and estate duties--what you call death
duties--you will get all your cash back and the land as well.</p>

<p>THE MAYOR. Blee: I tell you, dont argue. Stick to your point. No
compensation.</p>

<p>BLEE. Not a penny, by God.</p>

<p>THE DUKE. You believe in God, Mr Alderman. I am charmed to hear
it.</p>

<p><i>Here the Duke is astonished to find Aloysia towering over him and
pointing an accusing finger at him. At the moment of his introduction
of himself as a duke, her eyes lighted up; and she has moved menacingly
across the hearth towards him until she is now standing behind the
vacant chair between him and Basham.</i></p>

<p>ALOYSIA. Have you ever heard of the Domesday clearances?</p>

<p>THE DUKE. Clearances? Which clearances do you refer to? The latest
cleared me out of Domesday Towers. I can no longer afford to live
there.</p>

<p>ALOYSIA. Dont prevaricate. You know very well what I mean. It is
written in blood and tears on the pages of working class history.</p>

<p>SIR ARTHUR <i>[introducing]</i> Alderwoman Aloysia Brollikins. The
Duke of Domesday.</p>

<p>THE DUKE <i>[rising courteously]</i> Wont you sit down?</p>

<p>ALOYSIA <i>[sternly]</i> You shall not put me out by these tricks
and ceremonies. My Lord Duke: I would rather touch the hand of the most
degraded criminal in London than touch yours.</p>

<p>THE DUKE <i>[collapsing into his chair]</i> Great heavens! Why?</p>

<p>ALOYSIA. Do you forget how your family drove a whole countryside of
honest hardworking Scotch crofters into the sea, and turned their
little farms into deer forests because you could get more shooting
rents out of them in that way? Do you forget that women in childbirth
were carried out by your bailiffs to die by the roadside because they
clung to their ancient homesteads and ignored your infamous notices to
quit? Would it surprise you to learn that I am only one of thousands of
young women who have read the hideous story of this monstrous orgy of
house-breaking and murder, and sworn to ourselves that never, if we can
help it, will it again be possible for one wicked rich man to say to a
whole population "Get off the earth."</p>

<p>SIR JAFNA. Admirable! What did I tell you? Hear hear!</p>

<p>ALOYSIA. I thank you, Sir Jafna, for shewing this man that even
hardened capitalist millionaires shudder when that story is told. You
will not find it in your school histories; but in the new histories,
the histories of the proletariat, it has been written, not by the venal
academic triflers you call historians, but by the prophets of the new
order: the men in whom the word is like a burning fire shut up in their
bones so that they are weary of forbearing and must speak.</p>

<p>THE MAYOR. Aye: in the Bible, that is.</p>

<p>ALOYSIA. The Domesday Clearances filled your pockets with gold to
console you for the horror and remorse of your dreams: but the
vengeance they cried to God for in vain is upon you now that Labor is
coming to its own; and it is your turn now to get off the earth.</p>

<p>BLEE. And in the face of all this, you come whining for
compensation! Compensation!! Compensation from us to you! From the
oppressed to the oppressor! What a mockery!</p>

<p>ALOYSIA. It is from you that we shall exact compensation: aye, to
the uttermost farthing. You are conspiring here with these capitalist
bloodsuckers to rob us again of the value of what you have already
stolen--to make us give you gilt edged securities in exchange for the
land that no longer brings you in shooting rents; and you think we
cannot see through the plot. But in vain is the net spread in sight of
the bird. We shall expose you. We shall tell the story of the Domesday
Clearances until the country rings with it if you dare to lift your
dishonored head again in English politics. Your demand for compensation
is dismissed, turned down: we spit it back in your face. The crofters
whom you drove from their country to perish in a foreign land would
turn in their graves at the chink of a single penny of public money in
your hungry pocket. <i>[She tears out a chair from under the table and

<p>THE DUKE <i>[very appreciative]</i> What a magnificent speech, Miss
Brollikins! I really must insist on your shaking hands with me before
we part.</p>

<p>ALOYSIA. Never. How dare you ask me? <i>[She sweeps away from him
and sits down in the opposite chair at the other side of the
table].</i></p>

<p>THE DUKE <i>[taking the armchair]</i> May I not have the privilege
of telling my grandchildren how I once met and shook hands with the
greatest orator of my time? I assure you all these shocking things
happened before I was born.</p>

<p>BLEE <i>[bawling at him]</i> Yes; but you still pocket the shooting
rents.</p>

<p>THE DUKE <i>[brusquely]</i> Of course I do; and so would you too if
you were in my place. <i>[Tenderly, to Aloysia]</i> I assure you, Miss
Brollikins, the people make much more money out of my shooting tenants
than they could as crofters: they would not go back to croftering for
worlds. Wont you let bygones be bygones--except when you are exercising
your wonderful gift of eloquence on the platform? Think of what your
ancestors were doing in those ruthless old days!</p>

<p>BARKING. Grabbing all they could get, like yours or mine. Whats the
good of tubthumping at these johnnies, Brolly? Theyve been doing it
themselves all their lives. Cant you see that compensation makes them
share the loss fairly between them?</p>

<p>SIR BEMROSE. It's no use. These damned Liberals cant understand
anything but virtuous indignation.</p>

<p>THE MAYOR. Who are you calling a Liberal? I represent the Labor
Party.</p>

<p>SIR BEMROSE. Youre a No Compensation man, arnt you?</p>

<p>THE MAYOR. Of course I am.</p>

<p>SIR BEMROSE. Then youre a Liberal.</p>

<p>THE MAYOR. Call me what you like. I'm not arguing. I'm telling you
that the Labor Party of the Isle of Cats puts down its foot and says No
Compensation. Is that plain?</p>

<p>SIR DEXTER. I am glad we have arrived at the same conclusion from
our opposite points of view, Mr Mayor. The Party I represent, the
Conservative Party, will withdraw from the Coalition if there is the
slightest wobbling on this point. We shall defend our property--and
yours: yours, Mr Mayor, to the last drop of our blood.</p>

<p>BASHAM <i>[incisively re-entering the conversation; they had
forgotten him, and now turn to him in some surprise]</i> Our blood, you
mean, dont you?</p>

<p>SIR DEXTER <i>[puzzled]</i> Whose blood?</p>

<p>BASHAM. The police's blood. You landed gentlemen never do a thing
yourselves: you only call us in. I have twenty thousand constables, all
full of blood, to shed it in defence of whatever the Government may
decide to be your property. If Sir Arthur carries his point theyll shed
it for land nationalization. If you carry yours theyll stand by your
rent collectors as usual.</p>

<p>BLEE. The police come from the ranks of labor: dont forget that.</p>

<p>BASHAM. Thats not how they look at it, Blee. They feel that theyve
escaped from the ranks of labor; and theyre proud of it. They have a
status which they feel to be a part of the status of the Duke here.</p>

<p>THE DUKE. I suppose that is why they are always so civil to me.</p>

<p>BASHAM. In short, Mister Blee, the police are what you Socialists
call class-conscious. You will find that out if you are foolish enough
to fall out with them.</p>

<p>BLEE. Who cut their pay? Tell me that.</p>

<p>SIR ARTHUR. I shall restore the cuts, Mr Alderman, with a
premium.</p>

<p>THE MAYOR. There! Now you see what comes of arguing, Blee. It only
gives him his chance.</p>

<p>ALOYSIA. You need not warn us, Sir Broadfoot Basham, D.S.O.,
K.C.M.G., O.B.E. In the Class War your myrmidons will be well paid.</p>

<p>THE DUKE. Myrmidons!</p>

<p>ALOYSIA. We know too well what we have to expect from your
Janissaries.</p>

<p>BLEE. Your bludgeoning Bashi-Bazouks.</p>

<p>ALOYSIA. The Class War is a fact. We face it. What we want we shall
have to take; and we know it. The good of the community is nothing to
you: you care only for surplus value. You will never give up your
privileges voluntarily. History teaches us that: the history you never
read.</p>

<p>THE DUKE. I assure you, my dear H&eacute;loise?</p>

<p>ALOYSIA. H&eacute;loise! Who are you calling H&eacute;loise?</p>

<p>THE DUKE. Pardon. I could not resist the French form of your
charming name.</p>

<p>ALOYSIA <i>[interjects]</i> The cheek!</p>

<p>THE DUKE <i>[continuing]</i> I was merely going to point out, as
between one student of history and another, that in the French
Revolution it was the nobility who voluntarily abolished all their own
privileges at a single sitting, on the sentimental principles they had
acquired from reading the works of Karl Marx's revolutionary
predecessor Rousseau. That bit of history is repeating itself today.
Here is Sir Arthur offering us a program of what seems to me to be
first rate Platonic Communism. I, a Conservative Duke, embrace it. Sir
Jafna Pandranath here, a Liberal capitalist whose billions shame my
poverty, embraces it. The Navy embraces it with the sturdy arms of Sir
Bemrose Hotspot. The police are enthusiastic. The Army will be with Sir
Arthur to the last man. He has the whole propertied class on his side.
But the proletariat rises against him and spews out his Socialism
through the eloquent lips of its Aloysia. I recall the warning my dear
old father gave me when I was five years old. Chained dogs are the
fiercest guardians of property; and those who attempt to unchain them
are the first to be bitten.</p>

<p>ALOYSIA. Your Grace calls us dogs. We shall not forget that.</p>

<p>THE DUKE. I have found no friends better than faithful dogs, Miss
Brollikins. But of course I spoke figuratively. I should not dream of
calling you a dog.</p>

<p>ALOYSIA. No. As I am a female dog I suppose you will call me
something shorter when my back is turned.</p>

<p>THE DUKE. Oh! Think of the names you have called me!</p>

<p>THE MAYOR. Well, if you will argue, Alderwoman Brollikins, there's
no use my staying here. I wish I could stop your mouth as easy as I can
stop my ears. Sir Arthur: youve planked down your program and weve
planked down our answer. Either you drop compulsory labor and drop
compensation or never shew your face in the Isle of Cats again. <i>[He
goes out resolutely].</i></p>

<p>BLEE. Take this from me. I am no Communist: I am a respectable Labor
man, as law abiding as any man here. I am what none of you has
mentioned yet: a democrat. I am just as much against Cabinet
dictatorship as individual dictatorship. What I want done is the will
of the people. I am for the referendum. I am for the initiative. When a
majority of the people are in favour of a measure then I am for that
measure.</p>

<p>SIR BEMROSE. Rot! The majority is never in favour of any measure.
They dont know what a measure is. What they want is their orders, and
as much comfort as they are accustomed to. The lower deck doesnt want
to give orders, it looks to the bridge for them. If I asked my men to
do my job theyd chuck me overboard; and serve me jolly well right! You
just know nothing about it, because youve never had to command; and you
havnt sense enough to obey and be thankful to those who have saved you
the trouble of thinking for yourself and keeping you off the rocks.</p>

<p>BLEE. You havnt kept us off the rocks. We're on the rocks, the whole
lot of us. So long, Rosy. <i>[He goes out].</i></p>

<p>BARKING. Silly swine! When they are offered what they want they wont
have it just because you fellows want it too. They think there must be
a catch in it somewhere.</p>

<p>THE DUKE. There generally is. That is how you feel, Miss Brollikins,
isnt it?</p>

<p>ALOYSIA. You dont know how I feel; and you never will. We are going
to save ourselves and not be saved by you and your class. And I prefer
Sir Dexter Rightside's downright outspoken opposition to your
silly-clever cynicism and your sickening compliments.</p>

<p>THE DUKE. It is only in middle class books, Miss Brollikins, that
noblemen are always cynical and insincere. I find you a most brilliant
and delightful woman. May I not tell you so? And WHAT a speaker! Will
you spend a quiet week-end with me in some out-of-the-way place in the
country, and let me try to convince you that a duke is a human being
like yourself?</p>

<p>ALOYSIA <i>[rearing]</i> Are you trying to seduce me?</p>

<p>THE DUKE. That would be exquisite, Miss Brollikins; but I am an old
and very poor man. You are young, beautiful, and probably opulent. Can
you find anything seductive about me?</p>

<p>ALOYSIA. Yes. Youre a duke. And you have the charm of a majestic
ruin, if you understand me.</p>

<p>BARKING <i>[rising]</i> Come on out of this, Brolly: youre only
making a fool of yourself listening to that old bird buttering you up.
You just dont know when to go.</p>

<p>ALOYSIA <i>[moving to the hearthrug, behind Sir Arthur]</i> You can
go if you like. I have some business with Sir Arthur that doesnt
concern you. Get out.</p>

<p>SIR ARTHUR. Some business with me! Public business?</p>

<p>ALOYSIA. Not exactly.</p>

<p>SIR ARTHUR. Oh! Private business?</p>

<p>ALOYSIA. I dont care who knows it. But perhaps you would.</p>

<p>BARKING. She means to marry your son David. One below the belt for
you, Brolly. Ha ha! Ha ha ha ha ha! <i>[He goes out roaring with
laughter].</i></p>

<p>SIR ARTHUR <i>[after a moment of shock]</i> I congratulate David,
Miss Brollikins. Have you arranged the date?</p>

<p>ALOYSIA. I havnt mentioned it to him yet. I hope all you gentlemen
will remember that I was not the one that blurted this out: it was your
noble viscount. However, now it's out, I stand by it: David is a good
boy; and his class is not his fault. Goodbye all. <i>[She goes to the
door].</i></p>

<p>THE DUKE <i>[rising]</i> And that week-end, Miss Brollikins? Or has
David cut me out?</p>

<p>ALOYSIA. Right you are. Your Grace! I will call for you at Domesday
House on Friday at half past four. As I shall bring a few friends we
shall hire an omnibus from the London Transport; so you neednt trouble
about a car. You wont mind my publishing an account of what happens as
a special interview: you know that we Labor intelligentsia have to live
by our brains. Au revoir. <i>[She goes out].</i></p>

<p>THE DUKE. There is a frightful unexpectedness about these people.
Where on earth shall I borrow the money to pay for the omnibus and
entertain them all? <i>[He goes back to his chair at the end of the
table and sits down].</i></p>

<p>BASHAM. Your share will only be a few shillings, Duke; and she will
reckon on having to pay for you. What girl in her class wouldnt foot
the bill if she had a duke to walk out with?</p>

<p>THE DUKE. You reassure me, Sir Broadfoot. Thank you.</p>

<p>SIR DEXTER <i>[triumphant]</i> Well, Chavender? What have you to say
now? When these people came in I was saying that though I was alone in
this room, the people of England were on my side and always would be
when it came to the point. Was I right or wrong?</p>

<p>SIR BEMROSE. We never meant to desert you, Dexy. You mustnt think
that.</p>

<p>SIR ARTHUR. As you have no more intention of consulting the people
of England than I have, the situation is unaltered.</p>

<p>SIR DEXTER. Than you have! What do you mean? Do you think you can
govern in this country without the consent of the English people?</p>

<p>SIR ARTHUR. No country has ever been governed by the consent of the
people, because the people object to be governed at all. Even you, who
ought to know better, are always complaining of the income tax.</p>

<p>THE DUKE. But five shillings in the pound, Arthur! Five shillings in
the pound!!</p>

<p>SIR DEXTER. Never mind my income tax. If what you said just now
means anything it means that you are going to play fast and loose with
democracy: that is, you think you are going to do something that both
the people and the governing class of this country are determined you
shall not do. The Conservative Party, which is ten times more really
democratic than you Liberals have ever been, will carry the people with
it against you. How do you propose to get over that? What are you
banking on? Put your cards on the table if you really have any.</p>

<p>SIR ARTHUR. Well, here is my ace of trumps. The people of this
country, and of all the European countries, and of America, are at
present sick of being told that, thanks to democracy, they are the real
government of the country. They know very well that they dont govern
and cant govern and know nothing about Government except that it always
supports profiteering, and doesnt really respect anything else, no
matter what party flag it waves. They are sick of twaddle about liberty
when they have no liberty. They are sick of idling and loafing about on
doles when they are not drudging for wages too beggarly to pay the
rents of anything better than overcrowded one-room tenements. They are
sick of me and sick of you and sick of the whole lot of us. They want
to see something done that will give them decent employment. They want
to eat and drink the wheat and coffee that the profiteers are burning
because they cant sell it at a profit. They want to hang people who
burn good food when people are going hungry. They cant set matters
right themselves; so they want rulers who will discipline them and make
them do it instead of making them do the other thing. They are ready to
go mad with enthusiasm for any man strong enough to make them do
anything, even if it is only Jew baiting, provided it's something
tyrannical, something coercive, something that we all pretend no
Englishman would submit to, though weve known ever since we gave them
the vote that theyd submit to anything.</p>

<p>SIR DEXTER <i>[impatiently]</i> Yes, yes: we know the cant of all
the tuppeny-hapeny dictators who think themselves Mussolinis. Come down
to tin tacks. How are you going to get it through Parliament?</p>

<p>SIR ARTHUR. I am not going to get it through Parliament: I am going
to prorogue Parliament and then do it. When it is done I shall call a
meeting of Parliament to pass an Act of Indemnity for all my
proceedings.</p>

<p>SIR DEXTER. You cannot prorogue Parliament. Only the King can
prorogue Parliament.</p>

<p>SIR ARTHUR. Precisely. Kings always have prorogued Parliament and
governed without them until money ran short.</p>

<p>GLENMORISON. But, man alive, it is not His Majesty alone that you
have to consider. The law courts will not enforce your decisions if
they are illegal. The civil servants will sabotage you even if they
dont flatly disobey you.</p>

<p>SIR ARTHUR. We shall sidetrack them quite easily by setting up new
tribunals and special commissions manned by officials we can depend
on.</p>

<p>SIR DEXTER. That was how Cromwell cut off King Charles's head. His
commissioners found out afterwards that they were doing it with ropes
round their rascally necks.</p>

<p>SIR ARTHUR. A rope round a statesman's neck is the only
constitutional safeguard that really safeguards. But never fear the
rope. As long as we give the people an honest good time we can do just
what seems good to us. The proof of the pudding will be in the eating.
That will be really responsible government at last.</p>

<p>SIR DEXTER. So that is your game, is it? Has it occurred to you that
two can play at it? What can you do that I cannot do if you drive me to
it: tell me that.</p>

<p>SIR ARTHUR. Nothing, if you are willing to take on my job. Are
you?</p>

<p>SIR DEXTER. The job of ruining the country and destroying the
empire? My job is to prevent you from doing that. And I will prevent
you.</p>

<p>SIR ARTHUR. Your job is to prevent me or anybody else from doing
anything. Your job is to prevent the world from moving. Well, it is
moving; and if you dont get out of the way something will break; and it
wont be the world.</p>

<p>SIR DEXTER. Nothing has broken so far except the heads of the
unemployed when they are encouraged by your seditious rot to rebel
against the laws of nature. England is not breaking. She stands
foursquare where she always stood and always will stand: the strongest
and greatest land, and the birthplace of the noblest imperial race,
that ever God created.</p>

<p>SIR ARTHUR. Loud and prolonged cheering. Come! let us both stop tub
thumping and talk business. The real master of the situation is Basham
here, with his fifteen thousand police.</p>

<p>BASHAM. Twenty thousand.</p>

<p>SIR ARTHUR. Well, twenty thousand. They dont stop functioning when
Parliament is prorogued, do they?</p>

<p>BASHAM. No. At Scotland Yard we look to the Home Secretary as far as
we look to anybody.</p>

<p>SIR ARTHUR. I can make myself Home Secretary. So that will be all
right.</p>

<p>SIR DEXTER. Will it, by George? If you and Basham dare to try your
twenty thousand police on me, do you know what I will do?</p>

<p>SIR ARTHUR. What?</p>

<p>SIR DEXTER. I will put fifty thousand patriotic young Londoners into
Union Jack shirts. You say they want discipline and action. They shall
have them. They shall have machine guns and automatic pistols and tear
gas bombs. My Party has the money. My Party has the newspapers. My
Party has the flag, the traditions, the glory that is England, the
pluck, the breed, the fighting spirit. One of us is worth ten of your
half starved guttersnipes and their leaders that never could afford
more than a shilling for a dinner until they voted themselves four
hundred a year out of our pockets.</p>

<p>SIR BEMROSE <i>[carried away]</i> Thats the stuff, Dexy. Now you are
talking, by Jiminy.</p>

<p>BASHAM <i>[taking command of the discussion coolly]</i> You are all
talking through your hats. The police can do nothing unless the people
are on the side of the police. The police cant be everywhere: there
arnt enough of them. As long as the people will call the police when
anything goes wrong, and stop the runaway criminal and give evidence
against him, then twenty thousand constables can keep eight million
citizens in order. But if the citizens regard the policeman as their
enemy--if the man who snipes a policeman in the back is not given in
charge by the bystanders--if he is helped to get away--if the police
cannot get a single citizen to go into the box and witness against him,
where are you then? You have to double your force because the police
must patrol in pairs: otherwise the men will be afraid to patrol at
all. Your twenty thousand have to be reinforced up to forty thousand
for their own protection; but that doesnt protect you. You would have
to put two policemen standing over every ablebodied man and woman in
the town to see that they behaved themselves as you want them to
behave. You would need not thousands of constables but millions.</p>

<p>SIR DEXTER. My Union Jack men would keep order, or theyd know the
reason why.</p>

<p>BASHAM. And who would keep them in order, I should like to know:
silly amateurs. And let me remind you of one thing. It seems easy to
buy a lot of black shirts, or brown shirts, or red shirts, and give one
to every hooligan who is out for any sort of mischief and every
suburban out-of-work who fancies himself a patriot. But dont forget
that the colored shirt is a uniform.</p>

<p>GLENMORISON. What harm is there in that? It enables a man to
recognize his friends.</p>

<p>BASHAM. Yes; but it marks him out as an enemy in uniform; and to
kill an enemy in uniform at sight is not murder: it's legitimate
warfare.</p>

<p>SIR DEXTER. Monstrous! I should give no quarter to such an
outrageous piece of sophistry.</p>

<p>BASHAM. In war you have to give quarter because you have to ask for
it as often as to give it. It's easy to sit here and think of
exterminating your opponents. But a war of extermination is a massacre.
How long do you think a massacre would last in England today? Just as
long as it takes a drunken man to get sick and sober.</p>

<p>GLENMORISON. Easy, Sir Broadfoot, easy, easy. Who is talking of
extermination? I dont think you will ever induce respectable Britons to
wear red-white-and-blue shirts; but surely you can have volunteers,
special constables, auxiliary forces--</p>

<p>BASHAM <i>[flinching violently]</i> Auxiliary forces! I was in
command of them in Ireland when you tried that game on the Irish, who
were only a little handful of peasants in their cabbage patch. I have
seen these things. I have done them. I know all about it: you know
nothing about it. It means extermination; and when it comes to the
point you cant go through with it. I couldnt. I resigned. You couldnt:
you had to back down. And I tell you, Dexy, if you try any colored
shirt hooliganism on me, I'll back the P.M. and shew you what Scotland
Yard can do when it's put to it.</p>

<p>SIR DEXTER. Traitor!</p>

<p>BASHAM. Liar! Now weve called one another names how much farther has
it got us?</p>

<p>GLENMORISON. Easy, easy: dont let us quarrel. I must support the
Prime Minister, Sir Dexter, to secure my seat in Parliament. But I am a
Liberal, and, as such, bound by Liberal principles. Whatever we do must
be done through Parliament if I am to be a party to it. I am all for
the new program; but we must draw up a parliamentary timetable for it.
To carry out the program will involve the introduction of at least
twelve bills. They are highly controversial bills: everyone of them
will be resisted and obstructed to the very last clause. You may have
to go to the country on several of them. The committee stages will last
for weeks and weeks, no matter how hard you work the guillotine: there
will be thousands of amendments. Then, when you have got through what
is left of your Bill and carried it, the House of Lords will turn it
down; and you will have to wait two years and go through the whole job
again before you can get your Bill on the statute book as an Act of
Parliament. This program is not a matter of today or tomorrow. I
calculate that at the very least it will take fifty years to get it
through.</p>

<p>SIR ARTHUR. And you think the world will wait for that, Sandy?</p>

<p>GLENMORISON <i>[na&iuml;vely]</i> What else can it do?</p>

<p>SIR ARTHUR. It wont wait. Unless we can find a shorter way, the
program will be fought out in the streets.</p>

<p>SIR DEXTER. And you think that in the streets you will win? You
think the mob will be on your side? "Ye are many: they are few" eh? The
Class War! Well, you will find out your mistake.</p>

<p>SIR ARTHUR. I dont believe in the Class War any more than you do,
Dexy. I know that half the working class is slaving away to pile up
riches, only to be smoked out like a hive of bees and plundered of
everything but a bare living by our class. But what is the other half
doing? Living on the plunder at second hand. Plundering the plunderers.
As fast as we fill our pockets with rent and interest and profits
theyre emptied again by West End tradesmen and hotel keepers,
fashionable doctors and lawyers and parsons and fiddlers and portrait
painters and all sorts, to say nothing of huntsmen and stablemen and
gardeners, valets and gamekeepers and jockeys, butlers and housekeepers
and ladies' maids and scullery maids and deuce knows who not.</p>

<p>THE DUKE. How true, Arthur! how profoundly true! I am with you there
to the last drop of my blood.</p>

<p>SIR ARTHUR. Well, these parasites will fight for the rights of
property as they would fight for their own skins. Can you get a Labor
member into Parliament in the places where they are in a majority? No:
there is no class war: the working class is hopelessly divided against
itself. But I will tell you what there is. There is the gulf between
Dexy's view of the world and mine. There is the eternal war between
those who are in the world for what they can get out of it and those
who are in the world to make it a better place for everybody to live
in.</p>

<p>SIR DEXTER <i>[rising]</i> I will not sit here listening to this
disgusting ungentlemanly nonsense. Chavender: the coalition is
dissolved. I resign. I shall take with me three quarters of the
Cabinet. I shall expose the shamelessly corrupt motives of those who
have supported you here today. Basham: you will get the sack the day
after the King sends for me. Domesday: you have gone gaga: go home to
bed and drivel where your dotage can do no harm. Rosy: you are a damned
fool; and you ought to know it by this time. Pandranath: you are only a
silly nigger pretending to be an English gentleman: you are found out.
Good afternoon, gentlemen.</p>

<p><i>He goes out, leaving an atmosphere of awe behind him, in which
the Indian is choking with indignation, and for the moment
inarticulate.</i></p>

<p>SIR BEMROSE. This is awful. We cannot do without him.</p>

<p>SIR JAFNA <i>[finding his tongue]</i> I am despised. I am called
nigger by this dirty faced barbarian whose forefathers were naked
savages worshipping acorns and mistletoe in the woods whilst my people
were spreading the highest enlightenment yet reached by the human race
from the temples of Brahma the thousandfold who is all the gods in one.
This primitive savage dares to accuse me of imitating him: me, with the
blood in my veins of conquerors who have swept through continents
vaster than a million dogholes like this island of yours. They founded
a civilization compared to which your little kingdom is no better than
a concentration camp. What you have of religion came from the east; yet
no Hindu, no Parsee, no Jain, would stoop to its crudities. Is there a
mirror here? Look at your faces and look at the faces of my people in
Ceylon, the cradle of the human race. There you see Man as he came from
the hand of God, who has left on every feature the unmistakeable stamp
of the great original creative artist. There you see Woman with eyes in
her head that mirror the universe instead of little peepholes filled
with faded pebbles. Set those features, those eyes, those burning
colors beside the miserable smudged lumps of half baked dough, the
cheap commercial copies of a far away gallery of masterpieces that you
call western humanity, and tell me, if you dare, that you are the
original and I the imitation. Do you not fear the lightning? the
earthquake? the vengeance of Vishnu? You call me nigger, sneering at my
color because you have none. The jackdaw has lost his tail and would
persuade the world that his defect is a quality. You have all cringed
to me, not for my greater nearness to God, but for my money and my
power of making money and ever more money. But today your hatred, your
envy, your insolence has betrayed itself. I am nigger. I am bad
imitation of that eater of unclean foods, never sufficiently washed in
his person or his garments, a British islander. I will no longer bear
it. The veil of your hypocrisy is rent by your own mouths: I should
dishonor my country and my race by remaining here where both have been
insulted. Until now I have supported the connection between India and
England because I knew that in the course of nature and by the justice
of Brahma it must end in India ruling England just as I, by my wealth
and my brains, govern this roomful of needy imbeciles. But I now cast
you off. I return to India to detach it wholly from England, and leave
you to perish in your ignorance, your vain conceit, and your abominable
manners. Good morning, gentlemen. To hell with the lot of you. <i>[He
goes out and slams the door].</i></p>

<p>SIR ARTHUR. That one word nigger will cost us India. How could Dexy
be such a fool as to let it slip!</p>

<p>SIR BEMROSE <i>[very serious--rising solemnly]</i> Arthur: I feel I
cannot overlook a speech like that. After all, we are white men.</p>

<p>SIR ARTHUR. You are not, Rosy, I assure you. You are walnut color,
with a touch of claret on the nose. Glenmorison is the color of his
native oatmeal: not a touch of white on him. The fairest man present is
the Duke. He's as yellow as a Malayan headhunter. The Chinese call us
Pinks. They flatter us.</p>

<p>SIR BEMROSE. I must tell you, Arthur, that frivolity on a vital
point like this is in very bad taste. And you know very well that the
country cannot do without Dexy. Dexy was at school with me before I
went to Dartmouth. To desert him would be for me not only an act of
political bad faith but of personal bad feeling. I must go and see him
at once. <i>[He goes very sadly to the door].</i></p>

<p>SIR ARTHUR. Make my apologies to Sir Jafna if you overtake him. How
are we to hold the empire together if we insult a man who represents
nearly seventy per cent of its population?</p>

<p>SIR BEMROSE. I dont agree with you, Arthur. It is for Pandy to
apologize. Dexy really shares the premiership with you; and if a
Conservative Prime Minister of England may not take down a heathen
native when he forgets himself there is an end of British
supremacy.</p>

<p>SIR ARTHUR. For Heaven's sake dont call him a native. You are a
native.</p>

<p>SIR BEMROSE <i>[very solemnly]</i> Of Kent, Arthur: of Kent. Not of
Ceylon. <i>[He goes out].</i></p>

<p>GLENMORISON. I think I'd better clear out too. I can make allowances
for Sir Dexter: he is an Englishman, and has not been trained to use
his mind like us in Scotland. But that is just what gives him such a
hold on the Country. We must face it: he's indispensable. I'll just go
and assure him that we have no intention of breaking with him. Ta ta.
Good morning, Duke. <i>[He goes out].</i></p>

<p>SIR ARTHUR <i>[rising and strolling round to the other side of the
table like a cleaned-out gambler]</i> That finishes me, I'm afraid.</p>

<p><i>He throws himself into the middle chair. Basham rises moodily and
goes to the window to contemplate the street. The Duke comes
sympathetically to Sir Arthur and sits down beside him.</i></p>

<p>THE DUKE. Oh Arthur, my dear Arthur, why didnt you play golf on your
holiday instead of thinking? Didnt you know that English politics wont
bear thinking about? Didnt you know that as a nation we have lost the
trick of thinking? Hadnt you noticed that though in our great British
Constitution there is a department for everything else in the world
almost--for agriculture and health and fisheries, for home affairs and
foreign affairs and education, for the exchequer and the Treasury and
even the Chiltern Hundreds and the Duchy of Lancaster--we have no
department for thinking? The Russians have a special Cabinet for it;
and it has knocked the whole place to pieces. Where should you and I be
in Russia today? <i>[He resumes his seat with a hopeless
shrug].</i></p>

<p>SIR ARTHUR. In our proper place, the dustbin. Yet they got their
ideas from us. Karl Marx thought it all out in Bloomsbury. Lenin learnt
his lesson in Holford Square, Islington. Why can we never think out
anything, nor learn any lessons? I see what has to be done now; but I
dont feel that I am the man to do it.</p>

<p>THE DUKE. Of course not. Not a gentleman's job.</p>

<p>SIR ARTHUR. It might be a duke's job, though. Why not have a try at
it?</p>

<p>THE DUKE. For three reasons, Arthur. First, I'm not built that way.
Second, I'm so accustomed as a duke to be treated with the utmost
deference that I simply dont know how to assert myself and bully
people. Third, I'm so horribly hard up for pocket money without knowing
how to do without it that Ive lost all my self-respect. This job needs
a man with nothing to lose, plenty of hard driving courage, and a
complete incapacity for seeing any side of a question but his own. A
mere hereditary duke would be no use. When Domesday Towers is sold to
an American I shall have no family seat left, and must fall back on my
political seat, which is at present on the fence. From that eminence I
shall encourage the dictator when he arrives as far as I can without
committing myself dangerously. Sorry I can be of no use to you, my dear
Arthur.</p>

<p>SIR ARTHUR. What about you, Basham? You are a man of action.</p>

<p>BASHAM. I have a jolly good mind to go to the King and make him take
the bit between his teeth and arrest the lot of you.</p>

<p>SIR ARTHUR. Do, Basham, do. You couldnt make a worse hash of things
than we have.</p>

<p>THE DUKE. Theres nothing to prevent you. Look at Kemal Pasha! Look
at Mussolini! Look at Hitler! Look at De Valera! Look at Franklin
Roosevelt!</p>

<p>BASHAM. If only I had ambition enough I'd think very seriously over
it. As it is, I'll go back quietly to Scotland Yard. <i>[He is going
out when he is confronted in the doorway by Hipney]</i> Hallo! What the
devil are you doing here?</p>

<p>SIR ARTHUR. I am afraid you are late, Mr Hipney. The deputation has
been here. They have all gone.</p>

<p>HIPNEY <i>[seating himself beside Sir Arthur with his usual
calm]</i> I came with them, Srarthur. I been listening on the quiet as
you might say. I just came in to tell you not to mind that
parliamentary lot. Theyre all the same, west end or east end, parkside
or riverside. Theyll never do anything. They dont want to do
anything.</p>

<p>BASHAM <i>[sitting down again in Hilda's chair]</i> Hipney: I may as
well tell you that I have had my eye on you for some time. Take care I
have no objection to your calling yourself a revolutionary Socialist:
they all do that. But I suspect you of really meaning business.</p>

<p>HIPNEY. I do, Sir Broadfoot: I do. And if Srarthur means business,
then let him come out of Parliament and keep out. It will take the life
out of him and leave him a walking talking shell of a man with nothing
inside. The only man that ever had a proper understanding of Parliament
was old Guy Fawkes.</p>

<p>SIR ARTHUR. But even if he had blown that Parliament up, they would
just have elected another.</p>

<p>HIPNEY. Yes; but it was a sort of gesture as you might say.
Symbolic, I call it. Mark my words: some day there will be a statue to
old Guy in Westminster on the site of the present House of Commons.</p>

<p>THE DUKE. Democracy, Arthur, democracy. This is what it ends in.</p>

<p>SIR ARTHUR <i>[introducing]</i> His Grace the Duke of Domesday, Mr
Hipney.</p>

<p>HIPNEY. Bless you, I know his Grace. About town, as you might say,
though weve never been introduced.</p>

<p>THE DUKE. Very much honored, Mr Hipney.</p>

<p>HIPNEY. No great honor, your Grace. But old Hipney can tell you
something about Democracy at first hand. Democracy was a great thing
when I was young and we had no votes. We talked about public opinion
and what the British people would stand and what they wouldnt stand.
And it had weight, I tell you, sir: it held Governments in check: it
frightened the stoutest of the tyrants and the bosses and the police:
it brought a real reverence into the voices of great orators like
Bright and Gladstone. But that was when it was a dream and a vision, a
hope and a faith and a promise. It lasted until they dragged it down to
earth, as you might say, and made it a reality by giving everybody
votes. The moment they gave the working men votes they found that theyd
stand anything. They gave votes to the women and found they were worse
than the men; for men would vote for men--the wrong men, but men all
the same--but the women wouldnt even vote for women. Since then
politics have been a laughing stock. Parliamentary leaders say one
thing on Monday and just the opposite on Wednesday; and nobody notices
any difference. They put down the people in Egypt, in Ireland, and in
India with fire and sword, with floggings and hangings, burning the
houses over their heads and bombing their little stores for the winter
out of existence; and at the next election theyd be sent back to
Parliament by working class constituencies as if they were plaster
saints, while men and women like me, that had spent their lives in the
service of the people, were booted out at the polls like convicted
criminals. It wasnt that the poor silly sheep did it on purpose. They
didnt notice: they didnt remember: they couldnt understand: they were
taken in by any nonsense they heard at the meetings or read in the
morning paper. You could stampede them by crying out that the Russians
were coming, or rally them by promising them to hang the Kaiser, or
Lord knows what silliness that shouldnt have imposed on a child of
four. That was the end of democracy for me; though there was no man
alive that had hoped as much from it, nor spoke deeper from his heart
about all the good things that would happen when the people came to
their own and had votes like the gentry. Adult suffrage: that was what
was to save us all. My God! It delivered us into the hands of our
spoilers and oppressors, bound hand and foot by our own folly and
ignorance. It took the heart out of old Hipney; and now I'm for any
Napoleon or Mussolini or Lenin or Chavender that has the stuff in him
to take both the people and the spoilers and oppressors by the scruffs
of their silly necks and just sling them into the way they should go
with as many kicks as may be needful to make a thorough job of it.</p>

<p>BASHAM. A dictator: eh? Thats what you want.</p>

<p>HIPNEY. Better one dictator standing up responsible before the world
for the good and evil he does than a dirty little dictator in every
street responsible to nobody, to turn you out of your house if you dont
pay him for the right to exist on the earth, or to fire you out of your
job if you stand up to him as a man and an equal. You cant frighten me
with a word like dictator. Me and my like has been dictated to all our
lives by swine that have nothing but a snout for money, and think the
world is coming to an end if anybody but themselves is given the power
to do anything.</p>

<p>SIR ARTHUR. Steady, Mr Hipney, steady! Dont empty the baby out with
the bath. If the people are to have no voice in the government and no
choice of who is to govern them, it will be bad for the people.</p>

<p>HIPNEY. Let em have a voice. Let em have a choice. Theyve neither at
present. But let it be a voice to squeal with when theyre hurt, and not
to pretend they know more than God Almighty does. Give em a choice
between qualified men: there's always more than one pebble on the
beach; but let them be qualified men and not windbags and movie stars
and soldiers and rich swankers and lawyers on the make. How are they to
tell the difference between any cheap Jack and Solomon or Moses? The
Jews didnt elect Moses: he just told them what to do and they did it.
Look at the way they went wrong the minute his back was turned! If you
want to be a leader of the people, Srarthur, youve got to elect
yourself by giving us a lead. Old Hipney will follow anyone that will
give him a good lead; and to blazes with your elections and your
Constitution and your Democracy and all the rest of it!</p>

<p>THE DUKE. The police wont let him, Mr Hipney.</p>

<p>BASHAM <i>[rising and planting himself between Hipney and Sir
Arthur]</i> Ha ha ha! Dont be too sure of that. I might come down on
your side, Arthur, if I spotted you as a winner. Meanwhile, Hipney, I
have my eye on you as a dangerous character.</p>

<p>SIR ARTHUR. And on me?</p>

<p>BASHAM. You dont matter: he does. If the proletariat comes to the
top things will be more comfortable for Hipney; but they wont be more
comfortable for you. His heart is in the revolution: you have only your
head in it. Your wife wouldnt like it: his would, if he has one.</p>

<p>HIPNEY. Not me. I'm under no woman's thumb. She's dead; and the
children are grown up and off my hands. I'm free at last to put my neck
in a noose if I like.</p>

<p>BASHAM. I wonder should I find any bombs in your house if I searched
it.</p>

<p>HIPNEY. You would if you put them there first, Sir Broadfoot. What
good would a police chief be if he couldnt find anything he wanted to
find?</p>

<p>BASHAM. Thats a suggestion, Hipney, certainly. Isnt it rather rash
of you to put it into my head?</p>

<p>HIPNEY. There's plenty to put it into your head if I didnt. You
could do it if you liked; and you know it, Sir Broadfoot. But perhaps
your conscience wouldnt let you.</p>

<p>BASHAM. Perhaps.</p>

<p>HIPNEY <i>[rising with a chuckle]</i> Aha! <i>[Impressively]</i> You
take it from me, you three gentlemen: all this country or any country
has to stand between it and blue hell is the consciences of them that
are capable of governing it.</p>

<p>THE DUKE <i>[rising]</i> Mr Hipney: I find myself in complete
agreement with you. Will you lunch with me at the Carlton?</p>

<p>HIPNEY. No: them big clubs is too promiscuous for the like of you
and me. You come and lunch with me: I know a nice little place where
the cooking's good and the company really select. You wont regret it:
come along. Morning, Srarthur. Morning, Boss. <i>[He goes out, greatly
pleased].</i></p>

<p>SIR ARTHUR AND BASHAM <i>[simultaneously]</i> Morning. Morning.</p>

<p>THE DUKE. You would never have got rid of him, Arthur, if I hadnt
made that move. Goodbye. Goodbye, Sir Broadfoot. <i>[He goes to the
door]</i> Basham, Goodbye. I wish you joy of your host.</p>

<p>THE DUKE. You dont appreciate him. He is absolutely unique.</p>

<p>BASHAM. In what way, pray?</p>

<p>THE DUKE. He is the only politician I ever met who had learnt
anything from experience <i>[he goes out].</i></p>

<p>BASHAM <i>[making for the door]</i> Well, I must be off to the Yard.
The unemployed are going to have a general election to amuse them. I
suppose youll be off to your constituency right away.</p>

<p>SIR ARTHUR <i>[rising]</i> No. I am not going to stand.</p>

<p>BASHAM <i>[returning to him in amazement]</i> Not stand! What do you
mean? You cant chalk up a program like that and then run away.</p>

<p>SIR ARTHUR. I am through with parliament. It has wasted enough of my
life.</p>

<p>BASHAM. Dont tell me you are going to take your politics into the
street. You will only get your head broken.</p>

<p>SIR ARTHUR. Never fear: your fellows wont break my head: they have
too much respect for an ex-Prime Minister. But I am not going into the
streets. I am not a man of action, only a talker. Until the men of
action clear out the talkers we who have social consciences are at the
mercy of those who have none; and that, as old Hipney says, is blue
hell. Can you find a better name for it?</p>

<p>BASHAM. Blackguardocracy. I should call it.</p>

<p>SIR ARTHUR. Do you believe in it? I dont.</p>

<p>BASHAM. It works all right up to a point. Dont run your head against
it until the men of action get you past that point. Bye bye.</p>

<p>SIR ARTHUR. Bye bye. I wont.</p>

<p><i>Basham goes out through the main door. Sir Arthur drops into his
chair again and looks rather sick, with his elbows on his knees and his
temples on his fists. Barking and Miss Brollikins break into the room
simultaneously by the private door, struggling for precedence, Sir
Arthur straightens up wearily.</i></p>

<p>BARKING. I was here first. You get out and wait for your turn.</p>

<p>ALOYSIA. Ladies first, if you please. Sir Arthur--</p>

<p>BARKING <i>[barring her way with an arm of iron]</i> Ladies be
damned! youre no lady. <i>[He comes past the table to Sir Arthur's
right].</i></p>

<p>SIR ARTHUR: I have proposed for the hand of your daughter Flavia;
and all I can get out of her is that she is not a gold digger, and
wouldnt be seen at a wedding with a lousy viscount. She wants to marry
a poor man. I said I'd go over her head straight to you. You cant let
her miss so good a match. Exert your authority. Make her marry me.</p>

<p>SIR ARTHUR. Certainly. I'll order her to marry you if you think that
will get you any further. Go and tell her so, like a good boy. I'm
busy.</p>

<p>BARKING. Righto! <i>[He dashes out through the masked door].</i></p>

<p>SIR ARTHUR. Sit down, Miss Brollikins. <i>[She comes round to
Hipney's chair; and Sir Arthur takes the Duke's chair].</i> Have you
consulted David?</p>

<p>ALOYSIA <i>[sitting down rather forlornly]</i> Of course I have. But
he's obstinate. He wont look at it the right way.</p>

<p>SIR ARTHUR. Did he object? He should have jumped at it.</p>

<p>ALOYSIA. Its very nice of you to say so if you really mean it, Sir
Arthur. But he has no sense. He objects to my name. He says it's
ridiculous.</p>

<p>SIR ARTHUR. But your marriage will change it.</p>

<p>ALOYSIA. Yes; but he says it would be in The Times in the births
marriages and deaths: Chavender and Brollikins. My name's not good
enough for him. You should have heard what he said about it.</p>

<p>SIR ARTHUR. I hope he did not use the adjective his sister applied
to poor young Barking's title.</p>

<p>ALOYSIA. Yes he did. The language you West End people use! I'm sure
I dont know where you pick it up.</p>

<p>SIR ARTHUR. It doesnt mean anything, Miss Brollikins. You mustnt
mind.</p>

<p>ALOYSIA. Would you mind calling me Aloysia, Sir Arthur? You can call
me Brolly if you like; but I prefer Aloysia.</p>

<p>SIR ARTHUR. Certainly, Aloysia.</p>

<p>ALOYSIA. Thank you. I wish I could get rid of Brollikins. I'd never
stoop to be ashamed of my name; but I cant deny there's something funny
about it. I'm not to blame for that, am I?</p>

<p>SIR ARTHUR. But you can get rid of it quite easily. You can take a
new name: any name you like, by deed poll. It costs only ten pounds;
and David would have to pay it if it was on his account you changed.
What about Bolingbroke <i>[he pronounces it Bullingbrook]?</i>
Bolingbroke would be rather a nice name for The Times; and you wouldnt
have to change your initials. No bother about your clothes at the
laundry, for instance.</p>

<p>ALOYSIA. Thank you, Sir Arthur: thats a practical suggestion. At any
rate it will shut David up if he talks about my name again.</p>

<p>SIR ARTHUR. Well, now you can run off and marry him.</p>

<p>ALOYSIA. But thats not all, Sir Arthur. He's such a queer boy. He
says he's never loved anyone but his sister, and that he hates his
mother.</p>

<p>SIR ARTHUR. He had no right to tell you that he hates his mother,
because as a matter of fact he doesnt. Young people nowadays read books
about psycho-analysis and get their heads filled with nonsense.</p>

<p>ALOYSIA. Of course I know all about psycho-analysis. I explained to
him that he was in love with his mother and was jealous of you. The
Edipus complex, you know.</p>

<p>SIR ARTHUR. And what did he say to that?</p>

<p>ALOYSIA. He told me to go to Jericho. But I shall teach him
manners.</p>

<p>SIR ARTHUR. Do, Aloysia. Did he make any further objection?</p>

<p>ALOYSIA. Well, he says his people couldnt stand my relatives.</p>

<p>SIR ARTHUR. Tut! the young snob! Still, snobbery is a very real
thing: he made a point there, Aloysia. How did you meet it?</p>

<p>ALOYSIA. I said my people couldnt stand his relatives; and no more
they could. I said I wasnt asking him to marry my relatives; nor was I
proposing to marry his.</p>

<p>SIR ARTHUR. And what did he say to that?</p>

<p>ALOYSIA. He told me to go to hell. He's like that, you know.</p>

<p>SIR ARTHUR. Yes, a hasty boy.</p>

<p>ALOYSIA. He is, just that. But I shall cure him of it.</p>

<p>SIR ARTHUR <i>[gravely]</i> Take care, Aloysia. All young women
begin by believing they can change and reform the men they marry. They
cant. If you marry David he will remain David and nobody else til death
do you part. If he tells you to go to hell today instead of trying to
argue with you, he will do the same on the morning of your silver
wedding.</p>

<p>ALOYSIA <i>[grimly]</i> We shall see.</p>

<p>SIR ARTHUR. May I ask whether this match is your idea or David's? So
far I do not gather that he has expressed any strong feeling
of--of--shall I say devotion?--to you.</p>

<p>ALOYSIA. We have discussed all that.</p>

<p>SIR ARTHUR. Satisfactorily?</p>

<p>ALOYSIA. I suppose so. You see, Sir Arthur, I am not like David. I
am a reading thinking modern woman; and I know how to look at these
things objectively and scientifically. You know the way you meet
thousands of people and they mean nothing to you sexually: you wouldnt
touch one of them with a barge pole. Then all of a sudden you pick out
one, and feel sexy all over. If he's not nice you feel ashamed of
yourself and run away. But if he is nice you say "Thats the man for
me." You have had that experience yourself, havnt you?</p>

<p>SIR ARTHUR. Quite. The moment I saw Lady Chavender I said "Thats the
woman for me."</p>

<p>ALOYSIA. Well, the moment I laid eyes on David I went all over like
that. You cant deny that he is a nice boy in spite of his awful
language. So I said--</p>

<p>SIR ARTHUR. "David's the man for me"?</p>

<p>ALOYSIA. No. I said "Evolution is telling me to marry this youth."
That feeling is the only guide I have to the evolutionary appetite.</p>

<p>SIR ARTHUR. The what??</p>

<p>ALOYSIA. The evolutionary appetite. The thing that wants to develop
the race. If I marry David we shall develop the race. And thats the
great thing in marriage, isnt it?</p>

<p>SIR ARTHUR. My dear Aloysia, the evolutionary appetite may be a
guide to developing the race; but it doesnt care a rap for domestic
happiness. I have known the most remarkable children come of the most
dreadfully unsuitable and unhappy marriages.</p>

<p>ALOYSIA. We have to take our chance of that, Sir Arthur. Marriage is
a lottery. I think I can make David as happy as anybody ever is in
this--</p>

<p>SIR ARTHUR. In this wicked world. Ah yes. Well, I wont press
that.</p>

<p>ALOYSIA. I was about to say "in the capitalist phase of social
development." I dont talk like your grandmother, if you will excuse me
saying so.</p>

<p>SIR ARTHUR. I beg your pardon. I suppose I do. Have you explained
this evolutionary view of the situation to David?</p>

<p>ALOYSIA. Of course I have. I dont treat him as a child.</p>

<p>SIR ARTHUR. And what did he say?</p>

<p>ALOYSIA. He told me to go and--Oh, I really cannot repeat what he
told me to go and do. But you see how familiar we are together. I
couldnt bear his being distant with me. He talks just as if we were
married already.</p>

<p>SIR ARTHUR. Quite. But does he feel about you as you feel about him?
Has he picked you out from among the thousand ladies to whom he is
indifferent? To use your own expression, does he come all over like
that in your presence?</p>

<p>ALOYSIA. He does when I get hold of him. He needs educating in these
matters. I have to awaken David. But he's coming along nicely.</p>

<p>SIR ARTHUR. Well, if it must be it must be. I shall not withhold my
blessing. That is all I can say. <i>[He rises: she does the same and
prepares to go].</i> You see, Aloysia, the effete society in which I
move is based on the understanding that we shall speak and behave in
the manner in which we are expected to behave. We are hopeless when
this understanding is violated. We dont know what to say or what to do.
Well, you have violated it recklessly. What you have said has been
unexpected to the last possible degree--</p>

<p>ALOYSIA. It has been true.</p>

<p>SIR ARTHUR. That is the climax of unexpectedness in polite society.
Therefore I am at a loss. Apparently my son was not at a loss. He knows
how to deal with you: I do not. I must really refer you back to him for
further consideration and report.</p>

<p><i>They are about to shake hands when Lady Chavender comes in
through the masked door.</i></p>

<p>LADY CHAVENDER. Still here, Miss Brollikins! I thought you had gone.
<i>[She comes past the table to Sir Arthur's right].</i></p>

<p>SIR ARTHUR. She wants to marry David, my dear.</p>

<p>LADY CHAVENDER <i>[calmly]</i> Very naturally. I think if I were in
Miss Brollikins' position I should want to marry David.</p>

<p>ALOYSIA. I know your class point of view, Lady Chavender. You think
it would be a big catch for me and a come-down for him.</p>

<p>LADY CHAVENDER. We both know that point of view, Miss Brollikins;
but it is you, not I, that have mentioned it. Wont you sit down?
<i>[She sits down herself in the nearest chair].</i></p>

<p>ALOYSIA <i>[murmurs]</i> I was just going. <i>[She resumes her
seat].</i></p>

<p><i>Sir Arthur also sits.</i></p>

<p>LADY CHAVENDER. I daresay a match with you might be a very good
thing for David. You seem to have all the qualities in which he is
deficient. And he has been declaring for some months past that if he
ever marries he will marry a factory girl.</p>

<p>ALOYSIA. Well, I have been a factory girl. I started as a school
teacher; but when they cut my salary I went into the factory. I
organized the girls there, and became a trade union secretary. Wherever
I went I rose because I couldnt keep down. But I am proletarian, bone
and blood, if thats what David wants.</p>

<p>LADY CHAVENDER. Nobody is that in England, Miss Brollikins. We have
never had a noble caste: our younger sons have always been
commoners.</p>

<p>SIR ARTHUR. Yes, Aloysia: all British blood is blue.</p>

<p>ALOYSIA. Well, call it what you like. All I say is that I belong to
the common working people and am proud of it; and that is what David
wants, isnt it?</p>

<p>LADY CHAVENDER. What I said was that he wants to marry a factory
girl. But I do not know what his attitude will be when a factory girl
wants to marry him. Have you proposed to him?</p>

<p>SIR ARTHUR. Yes. He told her to go to hell.</p>

<p>LADY CHAVENDER. David has rather a habit of telling people to go to
hell when he is too lazy to think of anything better to say. Miss
Brollikins is a resolute and successful young woman. David is an
irresolute and unsuccessful young man. If she has made up her mind to
marry him she will probably succeed. She will have to support him; but
I daresay she can do that as easily as she can support herself.</p>

<p>ALOYSIA. I shall expect him to work for his living.</p>

<p>LADY CHAVENDER. Marriage seldom fulfils all our expectations. You
dont know David yet.</p>

<p>ALOYSIA. I will find him a job and see that he does it. I will
interest him in it.</p>

<p>SIR ARTHUR. Splendid!</p>

<p>ALOYSIA <i>[puzzled]</i> But I cant make out you two. You havnt
flared up as I thought you might; but are you for me or against me?</p>

<p>LADY CHAVENDER. Miss Brollikins: I am sorry; but there are two
things that I cannot bring myself to take the smallest interest in:
parliamentary affairs and love affairs. They both bore me to
distraction.</p>

<p>ALOYSIA <i>[to Sir Arthur]</i> Well, dont you take an interest in
David?</p>

<p>SIR ARTHUR. David is at the age at which young men have to break
loose from their fathers. They are very sensitive about being
interfered with at that age. He would regard my taking an interest in
him as parental tyranny. Therefore I am particularly careful not to
take any interest in him.</p>

<p>ALOYSIA <i>[rising]</i> Well, you preach at me because my
conversation is unexpected; but you two are the most unexpected lot I
have ever been up against. What am I to understand? Will you play fair
and let David take his own way?</p>

<p>SIR ARTHUR <i>[rising]</i> We will even let him take your way if he
wishes, Aloysia.</p>

<p>LADY CHAVENDER <i>[rising]</i> You may leave me out of the question,
Miss Brollikins. It is not my business, but my son's. I am neither his
enemy nor yours.</p>

<p>ALOYSIA <i>[perplexed]</i> But do you think I ought to marry
him?</p>

<p>LADY CHAVENDER. Nobody ought to marry anybody, Aloysia. But they
do.</p>

<p>ALOYSIA. Well, thank you for calling me Aloysia, anyhow. It's about
all the satisfaction I have got here.</p>

<p><i>She is about to go when David breaks in obstreperously through
the masked door, and strides between the table and the window to
Aloysia's left.</i></p>

<p>DAVID. Look here, Aloysia. What are you up to here? If you think you
can get round me by getting round my parents, youre very much mistaken.
My parents dont care a damn what I do as long as I take myself off
their hands. And I wont be interfered with. Do you hear? I wont be
interfered with.</p>

<p>ALOYSIA. Your parents are too good for you, you uncivilized lout.
Youve put me right off it by talking that way in front of your mother.
If I was your mother I'd smack some manners into you.</p>

<p>DAVID <i>[appalled and imploring]</i> Aloysia! <i>[He tries to take
her in his arms].</i></p>

<p>ALOYSIA. Take your dirty hands off me <i>[she flings him off].</i>
It's off, I tell you, off. Goodbye all. <i>[She storms out through the
main door].</i></p>

<p>DAVID <i>[in loud lament to his mother]</i> Youve ruined my whole
life. <i>[He goes in pursuit, crying]</i> Aloysia, Aloysia, wait a
moment. <i>[With anguished intensity]</i> Aloysia. <i>[His cries recede
in the distance].</i></p>

<p>LADY CHAVENDER. I beg your pardon. What did you say?</p>

<p>SIR ARTHUR. I said he might do worse.</p>

<p>LADY CHAVENDER. That is what I said. David is overbred: he is so
fine-drawn that he is good for nothing; and he is not strong enough
physically. Our breed needs to be crossed with the gutter or the soil
once in every three or four generations. Uncle Theodore married his
cook on principle; and his wife was my favourite aunt. Brollikins may
give me goose flesh occasionally; but she wont bore me as a lady
daughter-in-law would. I shall be always wondering what she will say or
do next. If she were a lady I'd always know. I am so tired of wellbred
people, and party politics, and the London season, and all the rest of
it.</p>

<p>SIR ARTHUR. I sometimes think you are the only really revolutionary
revolutionist I have ever met.</p>

<p>LADY CHAVENDER. Oh, lots of us are like that. We were born into good
society; and we are through with it: we have no illusions about it,
even if we are fit for nothing better. I dont mind Brollikins one
bit.</p>

<p>SIR ARTHUR. What about Barking?</p>

<p>LADY CHAVENDER. I--</p>

<p><i>Barking enters through the masked door, jubilant. He comes
between the pair as they rise, and claps them both on the shoulders
right and left simultaneously. They flinch violently, and stare at him
in outraged amazement.</i></p>

<p>BARKING. Good news, old dears! It's all right about Flavia. We may
put up the banns. Hooray! <i>[He rubs hands gleefully].</i></p>

<p>SIR ARTHUR. May I ask how you have got over her craze for marrying a
poor man?</p>

<p>BARKING. Oh, that was a girlish illusion. You see, she had a glimpse
today, at the unemployment meeting, of what poor men are really like.
They were awfully nice to her. That did the trick. You see, what she
craved for before was their rough manners, their violence, their
brutality and filthy language, their savage treatment of their women
folk. That was her ideal of a delightful husband. She found today that
the working man doesnt realize it. I do. I am a real he-man. I called
her the foulest names until she gave in. She's a dear. We shall be
perfectly happy. Good old mother-in-law. <i>[He kisses Lady Chavender,
who is too astounded to resist or speak].</i> Tootle loo, Chavender.
<i>[He slaps him on the shoulder].</i> I am off to buy her a lot of
presents. <i>[He dashes out through the main door].</i></p>

<p>SIR ARTHUR. So thats that.</p>

<p>LADY CHAVENDER. The brute! How dare he kiss me? <i>[She rubs the
place with her handkerchief].</i></p>

<p>SIR ARTHUR. Do you realize that we two are free at last? Free,
dearest: think of that! No more children. Free to give up living in a
big house and to spend the remainder of our lives as we please. A
cottage near a good golf links seems to be indicated. What would you
like?</p>

<p>LADY CHAVENDER. But your political career? Are you really going to
give up that?</p>

<p>SIR ARTHUR. It has given me up, dearest. Arnt you glad?</p>

<p>LADY CHAVENDER. Arthur: I cant bear this.</p>

<p>SIR ARTHUR. Cant bear what?</p>

<p>LADY CHAVENDER. To see you discouraged. You have never been
discouraged before: you have always been so buoyant. If this new
departure is to do nothing for you but take away your courage and high
spirits and selfconfidence, then in Heaven's name go back to your old
way of life. I will put up with anything rather than see you unhappy.
That sort of unhappiness kills; and if you die I'll die too. <i>[She
throws herself into a chair and hides her face on the table].</i></p>

<p>SIR ARTHUR. Dont fuss, dearest: I'm not unhappy. I am enjoying the
enormous freedom of having found myself out and got myself off my mind.
That looks like despair; but it is really the beginning of hope, and
the end of hypocrisy. Do you think I didnt know, in the days of my
great speeches and my roaring popularity, that I was only whitewashing
the slums? I did it very well--I dont care who hears me say so--and
there is always a sort of artistic satisfaction in doing a thing very
well, whether it's getting a big Bill through the House, or carrying a
big meeting off its feet, or winning a golf championship. It was all
very jolly; and I'm still a little proud of it. But even if I had not
had you here to remind me that it was all hot air, I couldnt help
knowing as well as any of those damned Socialists that though the West
End of London was chockful of money and nice people all calling one
another by their Christian names, the lives of the millions of people
whose labor was keeping the whole show going were not worth living. I
knew it quite well; but I was able to put it out of my mind because I
thought it couldnt be helped and I was doing the best that could be
done. I know better now: I know that it can be helped, and how it can
be helped. And rather than go back to the old whitewashing job, I'd
seize you tight round the waist and make a hole in the river with
you.</p>

<p>LADY CHAVENDER <i>[rising]</i> Then why, dearest love, dont
you--</p>

<p>SIR ARTHUR. Why dont I lead a revolt against it all? Because I'm not
the man for the job, darling; and nobody knows that better than you.
And I shall hate the man who will carry it through for his cruelty and
the desolation he will bring on us and our like.</p>

<p><i>Shouting, as of an excited mob suddenly surging into the street;
and a sound of breaking glass and police whistling.</i></p>

<p>LADY CHAVENDER. What on earth is that?</p>

<p><i>Hilda comes from her office and runs to the window.</i></p>

<p>LADY CHAVENDER <i>[joining her]</i> What is going on, Hilda?</p>

<p>HILDA. The unemployed have broken into Downing Street; and theyre
breaking the windows of the Colonial Office. They think this side is
only private houses.</p>

<p>SIR ARTHUR <i>[going to see]</i> Yes: they always break the wrong
windows, poor devils!</p>

<p>HILDA. Oh! here come the mounted police.</p>

<p>SIR ARTHUR. Theyve splendid horses, those fellows.</p>

<p>HILDA. The people are all running away. And they cant get out:
theyre in a cul-de-sac. Oh, why dont they make a stand, the
cowards?</p>

<p>LADY CHAVENDER. Indeed I hope they wont. What are you thinking of,
Hilda?</p>

<p>SIR ARTHUR. Men are like that, Hilda. They always run away when they
have no discipline and no leader.</p>

<p>HILDA. Well, but cant the police let them run away without breaking
their heads? Oh look: that policeman has just clubbed a quite old
man.</p>

<p>SIR ARTHUR. Come away: it's not a nice sight. <i>[He draws her away,
placing himself between her and the window].</i></p>

<p>HILDA. It's all right when you only read about it in the papers; but
when you actually see it you want to throw stones at the police.</p>

<p><i>Defiant singing through the tumult.</i></p>

<p>LADY CHAVENDER <i>[looking out]</i> Someone has opened the side gate
and let them through into the Horse Guards Parade. They are trying to
sing.</p>

<p>SIR ARTHUR. What are they singing? The Red Flag?</p>

<p>LADY CHAVENDER. No. I dont know the tune. I caught the first two
words. "England, arise."</p>

<p>HILDA <i>[suddenly hysterical]</i> Oh, my God! I will go out and
join them <i>[she rushes out through the main door].</i></p>

<p>LADY CHAVENDER. Hilda! Hilda!</p>

<p>SIR ARTHUR. Never mind, dear: the police all know her: she'll come
to no harm. She'll be back for tea. But what she felt just now other
girls and boys may feel tomorrow. And just suppose--!</p>

<p>LADY CHAVENDER. What?</p>

<p>SIR ARTHUR. Suppose England really did arise!</p>

<p><i>Unemployed England, however, can do nothing but continue to sing,
as best it can to a percussion accompaniment of baton thwacks, Edward
Carpenter's verses</i></p>

<blockquote>
<p>(Replies to a questionnaire by Andrew E. Malone, from the holograph
manuscript in the Humanities Research Center of the University of Texas
at Austin. Published as an interview in the <i>Sunday Chronicle,</i>
Manchester, 19 August 1934)</p>
</blockquote>

<p> </p>

<p><i>In</i> On The Rocks, <i>which was staged a few weeks ago at the
Abbey Theatre, The Prime Minister capitulates when he had, apparently,
won over all his more important colleagues in the Cabinet to his
programme. If Prime Ministers consistently behaved like this
government, as we know it now, political power must inevitably pass to
militant Dictators everywhere. Do you believe that Militant
Dictatorship is the only form of government which will get the nations
off the rocks?</i></p>

<p>The P.M. in On the Rocks did not win over anybody. The proletarians
attacked and repudiated him at once; and the Conservatives, though
quite approving of the items in his program which favored their private
affairs, deserted him and followed their Die Hard leader the moment he
called them to heel.</p>

<p>As to militant Dictatorship, it means no more than Gas and Gaiters.
At present all the countries which are not, like England, merely
sticking in the mud, are dominated by dictators: Stalin, Hitler,
Mussolini, Kemal, Roosevelt, Pilsudski, and De Valera. But none of
these dictatorships is like any of the others. The only feature they
have in common is the abolition of party government and of Oppositions.
The notion that the only alternative to the party system is a Tsardom
masquerading as a Republican Dictatorship is only a symptom of
political ignorance and thoughtlessness, which is unfortunately an
almost universal disease at present.</p>

<p> </p>

<p><i>Do you believe that your stage Prime Minister's way, of conceding
everything to the powerful ones, or that of your King Magnus, of
threatening to make an appeal to the country, is the better way of
preserving and continuing the system of Representative
Government?</i></p>

<p>A Prime Minister cannot help himself within the limits of the
Constitution. Power is to the powerful. King Magnus outwitted his
ministers at the party game, but was left entirely helpless in the face
of Big Business and the threatened absorption of England by the United
States under cover of Re-Union. Representative government is not at
stake. It existed before party government (a dodge hit upon by a
Scottish adviser of William III of glorious, pious and immortal memory)
existed; and it will exist long after party government has ceased in
England as completely as in Russia.</p>

<p> </p>

<p><i>Do you think that a limitation of the franchise to those who
really desire it, and take some trouble to secure it, would be of
assistance in making parliamentary government really effective?</i></p>

<p>There should be no limitation of the franchise. Everybody who is
capable of suffering by misgovernment must have a means of squealing
loudly when he is hurt. Otherwise the Government cannot possibly tell
whether it is doing harm or good. It is only when fools and robbers
pretend that the man in the street can legislate and administer and
govern that it becomes necessary to bind the man in the street hand and
foot and gag him, which is exactly what the robbers want. Parliament is
for the ventilation of grievances. An organ for that purpose is an
indispensable part of any stable political structure; and it should be
available for everybody, even for children--perhaps especially for
children.</p>

<p> </p>

<p><i>F. S. Oliver holds that a parliament "Where none was for a party,
But all were for the State" would be "no more than an impotent Babel of
virtuous voices." What is your opinion on the subject?</i></p>

<p>What is wanted is a parliament in which no one is for a party and
everyone for his own fireside. Then the Government will be able to find
out what is wrong with the firesides. If it is an honest Government it
will set its wits to work to right the wrong. If it is a Gombeen
Government it will study to maintain the wrong and, if possible, to
intensify it.</p>

<p> </p>

<p><i>In Ireland Mr. de Valera has expressed the opinion that when once
the electorate has given a decision by electing a majority of any party
to be the government all opposition to the policy of the victorious
party should cease. All vocal opposition is then merely factious, and
all active opposition treachery. Would you agree that this should be
so?</i></p>

<p>Of course Mr de Valera is only talking the plainest common sense. He
is exactly and finally right. The business of an Opposition is to
oppose, even when it is opposing measures of the desirability of which
it is so convinced that it passes them itself when it gets into power.
How could any sane business be conducted on such a principle? Let the
Irish people by all means choose whether they will be governed by Mr A
or Mr B, or if you prefer it, by Mr de V. or Mr O'D (or their wives);
but to ask Mr A to govern the country and then send in Mr B to prevent
his doing it is an act of political lunacy which can be advocated by
people who want to prevent the country being governed at all. Mr de
Valera is forced by the very nature of things to refuse to govern under
such impossible conditions.</p>

<p> </p>

<p><i>Do</i> <i>you think that Ireland, or the Irish Free State, is on
the rocks? Or, Is it heading for the rocks? Or, Do you think that it
has escaped the rocks?</i></p>

<p>Yes: of course she is on the rocks, the same old rocks. And when a
Catholic Irishman tries to get her off, a Protestant Irishman
immediately tries to keep her on; and <i>vice versa.</i> Contrairyness
is the curse of Ireland, as fatheaded snobbery is the curse of
England.</p>

<p> </p>

<p><i>If</i> <i>we are on the rocks, with most of the world, do you
think we are on the same rocks? Or, Have we struck a specially national
reef of our own?</i></p>

<p>Just the same old rock, on which idleness and parasitism are
idolized, subsidized, and glorified, whilst useful labor and honest
self-support are starved and despised. . . .</p>

<p> </p>

<p><i>If</i> <i>we are all on the rocks--What must we do to get
refloated? What must we do to be saved? You cannot, like your Prime
Minister, just wave your hands ineffectively and vanish from the
stage.</i></p>

<p>My Prime Minister vanished because he was fit for nothing but being
Prime Minister in a party government. But his program remains. There is
no longer any doubt or obscurity or indefiniteness as to what needs to
be done. Of course it is not clear to muddleheads: nothing is clear to
muddleheads. And it is not known to invincible ignorance. But the
muddleheads and incurable ignoramuses will have to do just what they
are told or they will be the ruin of us. Good morning.</p>
