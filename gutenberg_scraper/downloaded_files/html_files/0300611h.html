<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>

<p>Books have been written on the Natural History of the Bible, on
that of Shakespeare, of Homer, Virgil and so forth: why not a
similar one on the fauna of the Greek Anthology--though the flora,
perhaps, would be even more interesting? So I often thought, while
reading and re-reading this marvellous collection which had been my
companion for many months past. Three years, I finally concluded,
might suffice for the venture. Three years, under some
vine-wreathed arbour, with the necessary books at one's elbow, and
one's soul at ease...Such a thing, it is obvious, should be a
holiday performance; written <i>con amor</i>e and not otherwise; in
reverential, playfully-erudite fashion. Three years or even more;
for I soon realized that the enterprise might well blossom--why
not?--into a general treatise on ancient Natural History and the
changes in animal economy which have occurred in the interval
between then and now; that it would open up, incidentally, a number
of questions social, aesthetic and humanitarian, showing how the
attitude of mankind towards birds and beasts has altered since
those days. Three years, I kept on saying to myself--where shall
they be found?</p>

<p>I shall not find them.</p>

<p>Be that a pretext for putting together the following notes which
may serve as material for some one more fortunately situated. The
pencillings then scrawled in my Anthology are fast fading; I
amplified them later with references to such authorities as were
accessible, but a good many others would have to be consulted if
the undertaking were to be brought up to date, such as, for
instance, von der M&auml;hle's book on the Birds of Greece, which I
have not been able to procure.</p>

<p>An undertaking, for the rest, of the gentlemanly kind; quite
useless. No doubt an interesting little paper might be written,
were we to investigate nothing but the Natural History of a single
period or of a single poet, such as Meleager; or that of a
well-marked group of them, like Lucilius and those other wits who
introduced the animal world chiefly for the sake of the amusing
similes they could extract therefrom; or if we devoted ourselves to
one particular beast, say, the lion or the bee, and traced its
progress through the Anthology from the earliest to the latest
references. A monograph of this kind would be brief indeed but not
without a certain value from a scientific point of view. To
compile, on the other hand, a long list of creatures mentioned only
at hazard (some of the most conspicuous animals are not so much as
named in this collection); a list of creatures mentioned by poets
good and bad, poets of divers nationalities, poets scattered over a
large geographical area and over a period of fifteen hundred years
of time--to compile such a list: what more exquisitely
unprofitable?</p>

<p>Nevertheless, now that the thing is done, it strikes me that
these utterances of a considerable section--segment, rather--of the
ancient world present, for all their variety, a certain inner
coherence. That must be because the writers happened to be poets,
who view life from more or less the same angle through all the
ages; poets, whose observations of natural phenomena were casual
and unsystematic, whose interpretation of such things shifts more
slowly than that of the scientists, and shifts, when it does so,
along a plane different from theirs. Not one of them can be called
a poet-naturalist in the sense of some half-dozen English ones;
Aristotle is modern, compared to the latest of them; indeed, he
belongs to another world of thought. How birds and beasts affect
these men, what they say about them and what they fail to say,
reveal, when taken as a whole, an outlook that is well riveted
together--an outlook harmonious, and yet, with a faint persistence,
dissimilar to that of the present day; it is as if we were glancing
from a window upon some unfamiliar landscape.</p>

<p>Like our own poets, they are quite ready to introduce the animal
creation into their pages, and in so doing they often register what
seem to be the most irrelevant and wearisome trivialities; some of
their lines are sheer doggerel. But these trivialities, I think,
have their significance. That is why the reader of the following
pages cannot but notice that I have chronicled them one after the
other with pedantic deliberation, to the verge of tediousness and
possibly beyond it. My reason is this: it is trivialities, mere
trivialities, which betray them in the long run; nothing but the
cumulative weight of trifles can turn the scale and demonstrate the
particular detail wherein our point of view has come to change from
that of their time. For we find no Natural History, properly
speaking, in the Greek Anthology; what its authors say about
animals constitutes a human rather than a scientific document; it
is a minute but clearly demarcated province in the history of
feeling--which is only another way of saying once more that its
writers were poets. All such history changes slowly,, since,
unconcerned with political or social or scientific movements, it
can but reflect the almost imperceptible interaction between
nature, a relatively stable environment, and that old and yet
relatively unstable heart of man.</p>

<p>Glancing in cursory fashion through the Anthology, one might be
tempted to formulate some theory such as this: that the poets'
interest in--or at least mention of--wild animals is not constant
in its intensity but follows, rather, a curved line: low at first,
in the grand era, and confined chiefly to decorative ones such as
lions, it rises high, declines awhile, rises again in the
Hellenistic and rhetorical period, drops almost to zero towards the
close (Byzantinism). The theory will not hold water. Though none of
its writers is preeminent as an observer of wild creatures, there
is also no gulf in the long stretch of years; every single century,
from Anyte to Agathias, produces its crop.</p>

<p>It was my intention to include the domestic animals in this
survey. The project has been abandoned not without reluctance,
because a mass of material had already been accumulated, and
because, as a matter of fact, a study of this group would throw
more intimate side-lights upon the lore and home life of the
ancients than does the other; it would have an ethical import of
its own. The wild animals must suffice for the moment; there are
some hundred and fifty-three of them, and the references to them
amount to close upon six hundred.</p>

<p>I had intended also to give, in the shape of footnotes, proper
references to Aristotle and so forth, and had actually proceeded
awhile with the ponderous task before realizing that such a method
would be like attaching a lump of lead to a soap-bubble. For it
became more and more evident that the notes were going to outweigh
my text in sheer bulk, besides giving to this trifle an
insupportable air of documentation, of Teutonic Gediegenheit. Hence
their omission from the pages which follow. I content myself with
giving most of the Anthology references, and even them I have quite
omitted in three little sections (on the dolphin, bee, and cicada);
they run more pleasantly without the distracting numerals in
brackets. The reader who distrusts my statements about these
animals can verify them by going through the text himself, and I
wish him joy of his labours.</p>

<p>A short bibliography is added; it avoids the repetition of long
book-titles. <a name="ch-2" id="ch-2"></a></p>

<h2>MAMMALS</h2>

<p>Many are the references to lions; they were slain with lances
and spears, as they are to this day by the natives of Africa. A
poem (6,217) relates how a eunuch priest of Cybele, sheltering
during a snowstorm in a cave, saves himself from a lion's attack by
beating the great kettle-drum which was used in the worship of that
goddess and which scares it away; perhaps the strange sight of this
fellow helped to discomfit the monster. Here we have one of
numerous cases where a single story has appealed to several
writers, who paraphrase it with variations and elaborations of
their own: Alcaeus, Simonides, Dio-scorides, Antipater and
Antistius all dwell upon the same theme. Another poem (6,221) tells
of an old and decrepit lion seeking refuge on a rough night with
some shepherds and their flock, and leaving them next morning
unharmed. That particular lion, at his time of life, should have
been a man-eater--a variety already known to Aristotle, who rightly
remarks that it is a question of age.</p>

<p>An Arab dedicates to Pan the skin of a lion, together with the
lance that slew it, which still bears the marks of its teeth
(6,57). Panopeus, hunter of lions and leopards, dies from the sting
of a scorpion (7,578); the accident is not impossible, though this
may be merely a rhetorical exercise, showing how the boldest man
may be overcome by the most ignoble of beasts:</p>

<pre>
'Tis in this tomb strong Panopeus rests,
Lion-hunter, piercer of rough panthers' breasts.
On the hills a scorpion from earth issuing
Wounded his heel with its death-giving sting.
Upon the ground lie his poor darts and spear,
Alas!--the playthings of audacious deer.
</pre>

<p>Other lion-killers are named--such as in 6,262.</p>

<p>Hercules, slayer of the Nemean lion, is frequently hymned; so
are the lions associated with Cybele; brave men like Leonidas have
lions sculptured on their tombs (in this case there is also a play
on the name); oracles refer to the beast more than once, as does a
problem (14,7) about a lion of brass which spouted water from its
eyes and from other parts of its body; we have the well-known lines
from Aristophanes comparing Alcibiades to a lion-cub which should
not have been reared in the city; a figure of Eros, driving a
chariot drawn by lions--a favourite motif--is noted by Marcus
Argentarius (9,221) as forming the device on a ring--</p>

<pre>
Upon this seal Love whom none e'er withstands
I see, guiding strong lions with his hands;
One flaunts o'er them a whip, the other holds
The reins; and grace abundant him enfolds.
I fear this bane of men; he who wild beast
Can tame won't pity mortals in the least.
</pre>

<p>Besides these, there is an anonymous poem (7,626) praising the
Roman Emperor because he emptied Libya of her lions and other
prowling monsters, and sent them to Rome to fight in the Circus.
Such beast-fights are alluded to more than once in the Anthology,
and we have a noteworthy epigram (9,581) put into the mouth of a
Byzantine Emperor, deprecating the bloodshed connected with these
shows. I find no reference to performing animals, to lions jumping
through hoops or elephants on tight ropes: it may be that the poets
were sensible of the ineptitude of such exhibitions. Nor is there
mention of menageries, of those <i>paradises</i> or <i>vivaria</i>
for which men like Lucullus and Hortensius were famous, and
concerning which Aulus Gellius has left us one of his usual dry
dissertations.</p>

<p>I cannot say when the lion became extinct in Europe, Herodotus
speaks of the lions and wild bulls in his description of Xerxes'
march through Macedonia; he says the former were ferociously
destructive to the camels that carried the army provisions, and
then proceeds to give other details about them and to note the
exact geographical range to which they were then confined. How like
Herodotus! Aristotle and Xenophon both confirm the existence of
these Macedonian lions. There seems to be little doubt that they
also existed in Greece at an early period, on Mount Olympus,
Cithaeron and Parnassus; Pau-sanias gives some information on this
subject, and the Nemean lion's den is pointed out to this day. A
well-known scholar denies that lions were ever found in the
Peloponnese: he regards the Nemean story as an importation. But if
the beast inhabited Thessaly, there is no reason why it should not
have spread southward; indeed, I fail to see by what means it could
have been kept out of the Morea. Dion Chry-sostom speaks of it as
extinct in Europe. Three hundred years later, at the tail end of
antiquity, Them-istius regrets that Thessaly can furnish no more
lions for beast-shows.<br>
<br></p>

<p>Besides the previously-mentioned leopard-killer another one is
named (Didot III, 2, 565). And No. 633 of the same section consists
of a two-line epitaph on a boxer who was killed in a fight with a
leopard, which shared the same fate--</p>

<pre>
See me, Lascepius, a boxer, who
Was slain by the same leopard that I slew.
</pre>

<p>So far as I can discover, the only other mention of this animal
is in the inscription over the gateway of Smyrna citadel (Jacobs'
Appendix, 336) which speaks of the cruel hand of time devouring
this once famous city even as a leopard devours a fawn. The beast
may perhaps be found, as in the days of Spratt and Forbes
(<i>Travels in Lycia</i>, 1858), in the Lycian mountains, where it
is known by the Turkish name of <i>kaplan</i>. There is a hint of
the leopard, as "panther" in an enigma (14,24). Erhard (p. 79) says
"On Samos a panther was shot"--he gives no further details.<br>
<br></p>

<p>The lynx, enemy of goats, occurs in a ten-line address to Eros
(5, 179) by Meleager, who refuses the God of Love a dwelling near
his heart; it would be, he says, like keeping a lynx beside the
goats. The lynx's eye is also mentioned (Didot III, 3, 79); that is
all.</p>

<p>I have never heard of lynxes in Greece proper, and doubt whether
they still exist anywhere, although their reputation for keen sight
survives as a. proverb. The Athens Museum contains a woefully
stuffed specimen which was killed on the Parnes, a few hours from
the capital, on the 18 March, 1862, and Heldreich (p. 11) mentions
one or two localities.<br>
<br></p>

<p>A bear-hunter is named (Didot III, 2, 565). There is no other
mention of the bear--Homer also has only a single reference to
it--save in a punning epigram by Ammianus (i i, 23 i) on a certain
objectionable person called Markos, the first letter of whose name,
he suggests, should be taken away, leaving <i>Arkos</i>, a bear,
"of which he deserves many" (to tear him in pieces).</p>

<p>I know nothing of the present distribution of bears in the
Anthology regions; a few were still to be found on Pindus and
Olympus in 1844, and there is a Macedonian proverb to the effect
that "once you catch your bear, it will dance for you". As to the
Peloponnesus, Leake says that the occasional appearance of bears in
the mountains both of Arcadia and Laconia is "generally attested by
the inhabitants" and they are now "seldom seen in any part of the
Morea" (1833). I have enquired about them, but could elicit
nothing; they have doubtless been driven out by this time, although
Arcadia derives its name from them. The Morea, being now turned
into an island, would in any case not harbour such monsters for
long. They were common in the days of Pausa-nias; Taygetus, he
says, was full of them. Tristram is therefore mistaken when he
tells us that bears became extinct early in the historic period in
southern Greece.</p>

<p>The Emperor Hadrian killed a bear, and hung its skin in the
temple of Eros at Thespiae with a dedication by himself which in
still extant (Kaibel, 811).<br>
<br></p>

<p>The ravening wolf, on the other hand, was a popular subject as
he continues to be. So in the lines (9, 432) by Theocritus,
consoling poor Thyrsis for the loss of a kid, which has been laid
hold of by the wolf in its claws (in its claws: how unlike
Theocritus! It has been proposed to substitute the word gnathos,
jaw)--</p>

<pre>
What use, poor Thyrsis, to cry out thine eyes
And to consume thyself with doleful sighs?
The pretty kid in Hades found her bourne,
For with his claws a rough wolf has her torn.
The dogs bay, now she's dead, but bay in vain,
Since bone nor vestige more of her remain.
</pre>

<p>Crooked claws are attributed to the wolf in an oracle (Didot
III, 6, 217), but only for the sake of symmetry; the lion, a few
lines earlier, having set the example of being <i>gampsonyx</i>,
crook-clawed. In _the same oracle occurs the compound
<i>ainolykos</i>, dreadful-wolf.</p>

<p>There is also an epitaph on the shipwrecked mariner who,
swimming ashore and thinking himself safe at last, is slain by a
wolf as he sets foot on land--a poem of which there is an
imitation. Both of them perhaps were exercises, since a single wolf
could hardly overpower the weakest man (7, 289 and 550).</p>

<p>We have further an anonymous quatrain, supposed to be spoken by
a goat which has been compelled by a foolish shepherd to suckle a
young wolf, to its own future detriment; and a strange account of
how a pack of wolves, pursuing a traveller into the Nile, formed a
bridge across the river by holding each others' tails in their
mouths. The same unlikely yarn is told about wolves, and also about
mice, by Aelian. The she-wolf that nursed Romulus and Remus is
commemorated in the last of the Cyzicene epigrams, and Ion mentions
the wolf-hounds which were traditionally, responsible for the death
of Euripides. Two dedicatory poems (6, 35 and 106) describe hunters
suspending on a wild plane tree, in honour of Pan, a skin and the
stout crook-handed staff used for throwing at wolves; Phaedimus
hymns Apollo's wolf-slaying quiver; Meleager talks of "sheep
catching a wolf" and Strato, on a certain disreputable occasion,
compares himself to a wolf that finds a lamb standing at the door
and waiting for him. As to its voracity, Diphilus, an early comic
poet, calls the inhabitants of Argos wolves; Lucilius accuses one
Gamus of having the appetite of five wolves.</p>

<p>There is no reference to werewolves, for which Arcadia was
famous.<br>
<br></p>

<p>Strange that the fox should barely be mentioned by name, since
the ancients knew its habits so well, and contrived many stories
about it, and valued its skin and ate its flesh, and protected
their vineyards against its attacks. The word occurs in an oracle
(Didot III, 6, 132) that mentions the hill Orchalides "which the
fox never leaves". Little foxes or fox-cubs, <i>alopekideus</i>,
are named elsewhere (<i>ibid</i>. 6, 277) as gaining the confidence
of doves, and the opprobrious term <i>kynalopex</i>, dog-fox, is
found more than once.</p>

<p>There is little doubt, mereover, that the robber beast which
Anyte describes as stealing upon a cock in his sleep (7, 202) was a
fox--</p>

<pre>
No longer as of old shalt thou so early stir
And rouse me from my bed with thy wings' rapid whirr;
For on thy sleep soft crept the Spoiler and thus slew
Thee as across thy throat his claws he sudden drew.
</pre>

<p>The bird's throat, she says, was rent by its talons; an odd
little blunder for the wise and tuneful Anyte to make, unless the
animal in question was something of the cat species. This is
doubtful, for she calls it <i>sinis</i>, the destroyer (there was a
legendary robber called Sinis); and it is a singular coincidence
that the Greek word for fox, <i>alopex</i>, should be derived from
the Sanscrit <i>lopakas</i>, which is taken to mean "the destroyer"
(A. de Gubernatis, vol. II, p. 122).</p>

<p>The cat, <i>ailouros</i>, hardly appears at all--a good deal of
the mouse-catching in ancient households being done by tame ferrets
or weasels as late, at least, as the days of Petronius (Satyricon,
46). Some prince is accused of stealing gold like a cat (11, 359).
A fatal accident is recorded as happening to a partridge which had
left its native rocks--<i>perdix graeca</i> therefore, a prettier
but less well flavoured fowl than ours--to become the property, the
pet, of Agathias Scholasticus. Its head was bitten off by the cat.
Both master and a disciple of his bewail the sad event and hurl
imprecations upon the assassin, whom Agathias vows he will solemnly
slaughter over the mangled corpse of his victim. Here (7, 206) is
what Damo-charis, the disciple, has to say--</p>

<pre>
Companion thou of the man-eating horde;
One of Actaeon's hounds, cat most abhorred!
Eating Agathias' partridge thou at least
Hurt him, thy lord, as if he'd been thy feast.
Thy whim's now partridges! Meanwhile the mice
Dance, and run off with all thy dainties nice.
</pre>

<p>They seem to have made no pet of this <i>ailouros</i>, a name
derived from its wavy tail, a name which, if not puzzling, would
perhaps, be more appropriate for the dog than for our modern cat.
Their cats may have resembled the Angora or Persian breed; they
were obviously not of the Manx variety. These men kept their eye on
caudal appendages: witness the fish <i>silouros</i>, from its habit
of shaking its tail as it moves along; the crab (also a kind of
fish) <i>pagouros</i>, because its tail is fast; <i>hippouros</i>,
the horse-tail fish; <i>irachouros</i> and <i>melanouros</i>, the
rough and black tail; <i>lampcuros</i>, the fox with shining tail;
<i>skiouros</i> and <i>kampsiourus</i>, the squirrel, the
shadytailed one...Arcturus is hardly to the point, nor the pilot
Palinurus, nor the thorny plant Paliouros, nor the town Kerkesoura
mentioned by Strabo (now Aksas) on the West bank of the Nile.</p>

<p>My friend D. P. Petrocochino of Athens, who kindly encourages
such fancies of mine, has collected, with the help of Mr. Philintas
(a well-known linguist and contributor to the new Greek
encyclopedia), some more of these tail-words, mostly
non-zoological, ancient and modern, substantives and adjectives:
kynosoura, kolouros, kolobouros, seiouros, kountouros, leukouros,
malouros, meiouros, lykoura, lykosoura, ankhouros, sainouros,
ouragos, ouriachos, ourakos, ouraios, triko-louros, ouropygion,
ophiouros or ophisouros, kakouros, seisoura, platyouros, diouros.
The Greek family of Coundoariotis derives its name from a postal
service they had, in which short-tailed horses--kountoura
aloga--were used.</p>

<p>Modern zoology has invented a few more, such as brachyurus which
would correspond to the last-named, and panurus (all-tail: the
bearded tit)...</p>

<p>The cat's other name <i>gattos</i> or <i>katta</i>, of Nubian
origin like our "cat", does not occur in the Anthology. The modern
gatta is still no great favourite in Greek households. But I am
encroaching on the province of domestic animals.<br>
<br></p>

<p>Erymanthus was famous for its deer, likewise the Arcadian forest
region of Maenalus--the district beloved of Apollo and Pan, now
bleak save on the North side, which in the days of our fathers
became celebrated for something else as well: the Maenalus fir,
that interesting growth which aptly bears the name of the
tree-loving Queen Amalia under whose reign it was discovered. There
is no mention of Actaeon, but we have an anonymous epigram on a
statue of the slaughter by Hercules of the fabled Maenalian hind;
Perses tells of the three doughty sons of Leontiades, each of whom
shot a stag from horseback in Maenalus and hung up its head in the
temple of Apollo.</p>

<p>According to these poets--Xenophon gives more details--deer were
hunted with hounds, and killed with spears and arrows, or driven
into nets. They were also tracked by their slots in winter, as
appears from the following poem by Callimachus (12, 102) which
contains a considerable amount of truth--</p>

<pre>
O Epicedes, through the frost and snow
The hunter follows where the hares' runs go,
And tracks the slot of hinds. But should one say:
"Look! there's one wounded!" for it he'll not stay.
Thus too my love. The fleeing he pursues,
And that which lies before him he eschews.
</pre>

<p>Their antlers, like the trophies of other wild animals, were
suspended on trees, on the pine, beech, plane, and the juniper
"sacred among hunters" (6, 253). This last gives some food for
reflection. The tree is called <i>arkeuthos</i>--a name which
occurs more than once in these pages; and Theophrastus, our first
authority, has described it so well that there can be little chance
of identifying it with anything save the modern <i>kentros</i>,
<i>juniperus phoenicia</i>, as was done long ago. Now, firstly, I
do not remember seeing a juniper of this species--the Syrian
<i>juniperus excelsa</i> grows taller--more than thirty feet in
height and that not in Greece (one I planted myself, under
favourable conditions of soil and exposure, is now nearly twenty),
and the trunk is so relatively slender that a stag's head nailed
against it would present an absurd spectacle. Not that there is any
mention in these poems of a stag's head actually attached to one of
them; but this animal constituting the sportsman's greatest prize,
it would follow that the favourite juniper was preferred to all
other trees. Secondly, I should not call it a forest
growth--Theophrastus himself insists upon its fondness for rocks;
it avoids those wooded and shady regions which the deer loves.
Thirdly, so far as I can recollect, I have never yet seen the
natural stump of a juniper--if the poet meant its stump rather than
its trunk--great or small. They seem to be not only of uncommonly
tough texture, but of uncommonly long life.</p>

<p>I cannot guess the size of the "high-stemmed junipers" mentioned
by Philippson (p. 282); my friend Mr. Shirley Atchley of Athens,
who has walked over most parts of Greece, tells me that the tallest
juniper of this kind which he has ever seen may have been fifteen
feet high (some on Parnassus struck me as higher); that, for
example, on the foothills of Aigalion opposite Salamis something
like a wood of them might spring up, if the plants were left
undisturbed; and that Thompson, in his "Flowering Plants of the
Riviera" gives twenty feet as its greatest height, and refers to an
unusually large -specimen with a trunk three feet in circumference.
Both Thisleton Dyer and Sir A. Hort maintain the old identification
of <i>arkeu-thos</i> with <i>juniperus Phoenicia</i>.</p>

<p>There, I suppose, we must leave the matter, unless--unless these
writers were alluding not to the juniper but to one of the six
larger conifers of Greece: <i>abies cephalonica, panachaica</i> and
<i>R-Amaliae</i>, and <i>pinus halepensis</i>, <i>laricio</i> and
<i>pinea</i> (the former of which were, and still are, known as
elate, whereas their other ancient name, peuke, is now applied to
the pine--called <i>pitys</i> in antiquity). Firs would be
appropriate in relation to the stag, which is the most fir-haunting
beast in Europe; they are liable to mortal accidents from snow and
wind and--owing to their height--from lightning, when they leave a
slowly decaying trunk such as hunters might find convenient for
their purpose.</p>

<p>The hunters, yes; the poets, perhaps no; and that is why I dwell
on this trifle. We must be on our guard with these poets, and not
only in the matter of plants. Exigencies of versification are
responsible for some little botanical and zoological confusion in
nearly all poetry, and one really cannot expect these charming
people to be meticulous about such trifles; they have enough to do
avoiding hiatuses and minding their quantities. So one of these
epigrams (10, 12) bids the weary wanderer rest his limbs under a
juniper, where there was a bench. It is not the kind of tree I
should choose for a siesta or under which I should place a bench;
its limbs are often so low that one would have to crawl there on
all fours. Enough of junipers.</p>

<p>Old huntsmen, grown weary of the chase, dedicate the manifold
implements of their calling, including the dogs' collars, to some
appropriate deity, as do fishermen and fowlers and other
craftsmen--cooks and sailors and schoolmasters and musicians and
prostitutes and farmers and blacksmiths and carpenters and eunuchs
and soldiers and several more--under the same conditions.
Significant reading they make, these little catalogues, for the
social history of their day.</p>

<p>The poets of the Anthology draw no clearer distinction as to
species than do some of ours. <i>Elaphos</i> = red deer (<i>cervus
elaphus</i>); so much is certain. But when (6,336) it receives the
epithet <i>balios</i>, dappled, we are to understand, I think, the
fallow-deer. This was the common stag of Western Asia and,
according to Keller, not found wild in Greece or any other part of
Europe in historical times, though it may have existed there
previously (Forsyth Major, in his "Tyr-rhenis", marks it down as
occurring in Sardinia, Heldreich in Akarnania).</p>

<p>Seeing that a certain proportion of the Anthology poets, some of
the best, came from regions East of Greece, we may take it for
granted that <i>cervus damn</i> was the deer they had in mind.
Indeed, it must have been this species in the case of Phalaecus,
unless he was indulging in poetic licence. He speaks (6, 165) of
the "spotted (<i>stiktos</i>) skin of a completely flayed
<i>achaines</i>". This animal, according to the dictionaries, is
the young of the deer at a life-period when it has single points to
its horns. Now these points in <i>cervus elephus</i> are not there
until the beast is a brocket, in its third year; the spots, on the
other hand, disappear in the fourth month after birth. If
<i>achaines</i>, therefore, has horns and is still spotted, it must
be <i>cervus dama</i> and cannot be the red deer. Sundevall, on the
other hand, supported by the evidence of various ancient writers,
says that the word <i>achaines</i> applies to the red deer and to
no other kind; that it was the deer "common to the Greek landscape
of Achaia" (whence the name of that province); and Sundevall's
authority counts for much. This is tedious to read, and still more
tedious to unravel, but I am going through with it.</p>

<p>The term <i>prox</i> is found, I believe, only once in the
Anthology (14, 24). It is taken to mean "Gazelle, or roe". One
cannot decide from the context which of these is intended; I should
say the latter, or possibly the fawn. The word is allied to
prokas.</p>

<p><i>Dorkas</i>, again (a girl's name in more than one poem), is
the gazelle or antelope; and in the case of Nikis the Lybian
(Isopsepha of Leonidas of Alexandria), who dedicates to Artemis the
weapons wherewith he killed such animals, the gazelle, native of
Lybia, may be intended. In most instances <i>dorkas</i> can mean
nothing but roe or fawn, although, firstly, it is impossible in any
one case to say which of the two is signified, and although,
secondly, the correct terms for young deer, <i>nebros</i> and
<i>kemas</i> (not <i>hellos</i>), both occur, and will allow
conversely of being rendered as roe (<i>cervus capreolus</i>] or
even as full-grown red deer. A <i>nebros</i> is described as
spotted, <i>stiktos</i>(\\, 40): what are we to make of this? The
skins of young deer were often worn, but they are of uniform colour
save in those first four months. The passage in question may refer
to the fallow-deer--</p>

<pre>
Cleodemus is still small, albeit this tiny son
Of Eumenes to dance with the young boys has begun.
Look! Even a dappled fawn's skin has he girded on,
And nodding ivy sits his yellow curls upon.
Big make him, Theban King, that this wee acolyte
May soon the full-grown youths lead in the holy rite!
</pre>

<p>In short, we cannot definitely say of any of the six names here
given to deer (<i>daphos, achaines, prox, dorkas, nebros</i> and
<i>kemas</i>) that they apply to one animal and to no other--which
is a record in the matter of poetical confusion; a confusion, for
the rest, that repeats itself among prose writers, who have no
pretext for being inexact in such matters. So Strabo, in speaking
of the <i>dorkades</i> as one of the great rarities of Spain, can
have been thinking not of the roe nor of the fawn, both of which
were common, nor yet of antelopes or gazelles, neither of which
existed there, but of the Pyrenean ibex; the "wild goats" of
Taygetus mentioned by Pausanias were probably chamois; and Aelian,
when he talks of the straight horns which the <i>kemas</i> uses for
attacking hunters, must have meant a species of antelope rather
than a deer-calf, which has no horns at all.</p>

<p>There are two epigrams about the death of deer, one more strange
than the other. The first, by Apol-lonides (9, 244), relates how a
herd of deer sought refuge from their snow-clad mountains in the
moist warmth of a river and were held fast there, to the delight of
the country-folk, by a sudden frost which covered the river with
ice. Tiberius Illustrius (9, 370) tells the fate of a <i>dorkas</i>
which, escaping from hounds into the sea, is drawn to land by
fishermen in their nets; and in Didot III (2, 387) is an epitaph on
a hind which was captured in similar fashion. Xeno-phon says that
one can sometimes drive stags into the sea, an occurence which is
frequently observed, since deer are excellent swimmers. Macedonius
has a quatrain (9, 275) about a certain Codrus who caught a swift
deer out of the waves of the sea. The myth of Saron is connected
with a stag which took to the water of what was afterwards the
Saronic Gulf; he pursued it into the waves and was drowned. Neither
stags nor hinds are so lucky nowadays, as can be seen from the
following newspaper account (14 November, 1926) which deserves to
be rescued from oblivion, testifying, as it does, to the
sportsmanlike instincts for which some Englishmen are famed.
"Residents at Minehead witnessed a thrilling scene yesterday, when
a hind entered the sea near Warren Point, hotly pursued by
followers of the Devon and Somerset staghounds. An exciting chase
in the surf followed, the huntsmen pursuing the deer in two motor
boats. The pursuit continued for nearly a mile before the animal
was caught. Ultimately it was landed on the quay and there killed.
Many hundreds of people watched the proceedings".</p>

<p>The deer's fleetness of foot is often commemorated; also its
longevity, which was supposed to be four times that of the crow,
which was nine times that of man. As a matter of fact, forty years
appears to be the age-limit of a stag. Out of the shin-bone of the
fawn they made flutes, <i>tibiae</i>, which seem to have given
forth feeble sounds--whereas Sardinians used to make particularly
good ones out of the leg-bones of flamingoes; Pindar's lyre is
described (App. Plan. 305) as outringing all the others, even as
the Etruscan trumpet outblares this flute--flageolet or pipe, I
should say. The skins of deer were worn at Bacchic festivals, and
one of the five performers thereat is pictured (9, 603) as holding
aloft the body of a stag--rather a cumbrous partner for a dance,
since a warrantable English stag weighs, according to the Master of
the Devon and Somerset staghounds, between 530 and 580 pounds, and
continental ones are a good deal heavier.</p>

<p>Rufinus, alluding to his sudden and almost incredible change of
taste in matters erotical, talks of dolphins browsing on the slopes
of Erymanthus and deer in the grey billowy ocean (5, 19). Rhianus,
like some English poets, uses the word <i>nebros</i>, fawn, in a
prettily metaphorical sense (12, 146), while Agathias does the same
with <i>dorkas</i>; and Antipater of Sidon credits the hind with
horns (6, ni), which would be correct only if he referred to the
female reindeer. Of the ordinary stag species, none save the
Maenalian hind can lay claim to such an ornament; antlers of gold,
into the bargain. The modern Cypriote peasant still has a song
about a stag with golden horns (<i>Neo. kellenica</i>, by Prof. M.
Constantinides). It is a popular motif--<i>cf</i>. the Golden Ass,
the Goose with Golden Eggs, etc. All folklore is saturated with
lust of gold and earthly possessions, like the talk of common
people in every part of the world.</p>

<p>We might note, since we are on this horny subject, that a
couplet of Callicter (11, 5) contains what may be the first
allusion in literature to the emblem of complacent husbands, though
I cannot guess which animal he had in mind. Moderns prefer the
stag; the horns of the goat being already marked down, by
Christianity, as a diabolical symbol. Yet the goat was, known in
this character to antiquity (<i>aix</i> = a woman of loose life),
and this at first sight is odd, considering the strong sexual
passions of the male, which suggest jealousy of rivals on his part.
Colu-mella clears up the difficulty when he says that the he-goat,
by reason of its very amorousness, exhausts its powers at an early
age and becomes a spectator of the wife's faithlessness from
impotence rather than from indifference. This means nothing more
than that it wears its horns, like certain other creatures, not
unconsciously, but with open-eyed resignation.</p>

<p>The red deer is now extinct in the Peloponnesus.</p>

<p>There is no mention of the elk, which has been well described by
several Greek writers.</p>

<p>Strange that the ibex, a beast famous in antiquity, should be so
little noticed by these poets. We have a sepulchral epigram by
Erycius (7,397) on a-certain Satyrus who was drowned in a northerly
gale off the rocky promontory of Mycale (the mainland opposite
Samos, famous for a battle between Greeks and Persians)--Mycale,
"where the goats browse"; he uses the term applied to tame goats,
but the ibex may be meant, in view of the facts that ancient
writers frequently confused the two animals or at least their
names, that the district was rugged and wild, and that the ibex is
known to have existed all along this coast of Asia Minor, as it
still does in parts of the interior--</p>

<pre>
Poor Satyrus lies not in this tomb, nor yet below
  This pyre sleeps he, although men may say so.
But if you've heard tell of a sea, a bitter sea,
  Which breaks upon goat-feeding Mycale,
'Tis in that sterile swirl of waters yet I 'm laid,
  And I there raging Boreas upbraid.
</pre>

<p>A quatrain by Callimachus (6, 121) may also refer to this beast,
since the Cretan archer in question would hardly amuse himself
shooting tame goats; it is thus translated in the Loeb
Callimachus--</p>

<p>Ye goats of Cynthus, be of good cheer! for now the bow of Cretan
Echemmas is laid up in Ortygia in the temple of Artemis--the bow
wherewith he made the great hill empty of you. But now he hath
ceased, ye goats, since the goddess hath wrought a truce.</p>

<p>His Hymn to Apollo also mentions these Cynthian goats, whose
horns were employed for the foundations of Delos.</p>

<p>An indubitable ibex is named only in a quatrain by Simmias (6,
113) relative to an ibex horn which, after being used as a hook for
suspending fresh wreaths or some such purpose, was fashioned into a
bow by having the tendon of an ox stretched across it. The beast is
here given the old name of <i>ixalos</i>, by reason of its almost
unbelievable jumping powers (a young one can leap from the ground,
without any run, on to a man's head, and stand there fast; old o
nes stand fast on four legs, on the upper ledge of an open door).
Simmias may have remembered that passage in Homer describing a
similar transformation--a passage which led to an excellent little
commentary on the part of de Quincey (in <i>Homer and the
Homeridae</i>)--</p>

<pre>
Being one horn of a long-haired
  Wild ibex, double-horned,
With festoons of leafed greenery
  Was I at first adorned.

But fitted by a craftsman's skill
  For Nichomachus I now
Bear the strong sinews on me strung
Of a crook-horned cow.
</pre>

<p>It seems, then, that these cumbersome-looking horns of the ibex
were not without their uses. We have already seen them employed in
the foundations of an island, as something in the nature of a
hat-rack, and as bows. Oppian, furthermore, tells us that the
animal breathes through them, and that if you close their orifices
with wax, it is suffocated (Archelaus, quoted by Varro, says that
goats respire through their ears). They are useful, fifthly, as an
aid to locomotion; according to Pliny, the ibex throws itself on
its horns which, being elastic, enable it to hop about from place
to place:--a performance that must be pretty to watch. They were
also considered valuable, even in antiquity, as a protection
against evil influences. Seventhly, Conrad Gesner says that the
animal employs them to ward off falling stones. This is not as
unlikely as it sounds.</p>

<p>The ibex seems never to have been an inhabitant of Greece
proper, though there is some confusion between it and the chamois,
which still lives in parts of that country (Heldreich) such as
Parnassus and Olympus. Crete was, and is, famous for the beast, and
here the old belief of the wounded ibex curing itself with the
juice of a certain herb has not yet died out. It lingers also on
certain of the islands--lingered, at least, in the days of Erhard
who has a lengthy disquisition on the subject and found, in the
islet of Antimelos, a new variety which he called <i>Aegocerus
pictus</i>.</p>

<p>As this animal, soon to be extinct in Europe, played such an
important role in the decorative art not only of the Anthology
regions but of countries further east, I will draw attention to
what may be a plastic representation of it which, by some chance or
other, has survived to this day in the potteries--established God
knows when--of the little town of Vietri near Salerno. The very
name of this place (<i>vetus, cf</i>. Orvieto) testifies to its
antiquity; its historian Casaburi has unearthed an authority who
claims that it was founded in 1243 B. C.; seven hundred years later
may be the approximate date, and here is what Cluver has to say:
<i>Marcinae oppidum illud est quod nunc Veteri diciiur ipso nomine
antiqui-tatem suam indicans</i>. Veteri or Vietri lies on an old, a
prehistoric, trade-route; its glazed tiles etc. have always been in
highest repute. Among the animal forms still manufactured there may
be found also the sag, a beast which has not been heard of in those
regions for many long centuries--for a thousand years, I should
say.</p>

<p>This figure of an ibex, conventionalized and indeed comical as
it is, and measuring only 8 1/2, centrimetres from nose to tail,
bears a sufficiently close resemblance to some that were done in
antiquity (see, for example, Imhoof-Blumer, Plate XVIII. 22). It is
here modelled in the act of sniffing the wind--a characteristic
pose, according to observers; I will add, as a curious coincidence
and as nothing more, that on its horns are painted eighteen rings,
which happens to be the precise number of those on a full-grown
ibex whether from Crete or from the Alps. (Scaliger says their
number sometimes reaches twenty-four, but I have never heard this
corroborated).</p>

<p>Now there are no ancient or mediaeval references whatever, not a
single one, to the occurrence of this beast in Italy south of the
Alps--though it was i mported in large quantities for beast-shows:
200 at a time, by Gordian--and therefore, while it may be
gratifying to re-discover an animal in a country where it never
existed, it would be more to the point if one could elucidate how
this traditional image of it came to reach Vietri. O. Keller (p.
48) tells us that the ibex found its way, as vase-decoration, "a
hundred and a thousand times" from the Phoenician factories into
Western Europe, to Veji and other places. This may supply a key. Or
the figure may represent the bezoar-goat, which lived even on Mount
Soracte (Varro).</p>

<p>I observe that the Vietri caricature--such it almost
is--possesses no beard; in ancient art the animal is sometimes
portrayed thus, though the Alpine ibex alone lacks, or nearly
lacks, this ornamental distinction. The horns are made to touch the
tail; this is likewise no novelty in art, and in the present case,
without a doubt, is the potter's device for diminishing risk of
breakage. For the same reason the two horns both of ibex and stag
are merged together so as to form a single one.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="0300611h-images/0300611h-02.jpg" alt=
"0300611h-02.jpg" style=" width:200pt; height:160pt;">
</p>

<p>Far from quarrelling with any one who prefers to interpret the
figure as that of a common goat, I will present him with the
information that old Mar-cina seems to have been famous for a
sanctuary of Priapus. There may be some connection between the two;
there ought to be. No self-respecting goat, however, would be seen
in public without its beard; and I should add that among the Vietri
figurines are orthodox goats in various poses, with truthfully
fashioned horns.</p>

<p>Wild boars were a nuisance to the crops and vineyards, as they
still are in regions where they abound; nuisance, indeed, is an
inadequate term, seeing that they can annihilate in a single night
all the work of the farmer and his hopes for the whole year. Their
numbers in Greece proper must have shrunk conside-rably; I have
heard of them in the lonely Geranean mountains, and a few are said
to survive in Euboea; lack of water and thickets sends them in
search of new quarters. The best time for destroying the boar
singly--that is, unless they are driven--is in earliest morning,
"fresh from its lair in the thick undergrowth", as Paulus
Silentiarius says; German sportsmen know well the importance of
encountering the beast in the timid stage, that is, before it has
had time to void its bladder.</p>

<p>There is mention of a boar striking its tusks into a ram which
was about to butt a child with its twisted horns (9, 240). Then, as
now, boars were renowned for their savage and reckless bravery; a
special breed of hounds--it is mentioned by Philippus--was employed
against them, since they put to flight the ordinary
sheep-dogs--which, by the way, cannot have been of the Molossian
race, as they should. Xenophon names four different breeds of boar
hounds, and it is sad to think that the last boar, and the last
deer, have now been extirpated in Elis, his home. We read of a live
boar sacrificed to Artemis the huntress; I see no mention of boar's
flesh as an article of diet, excellent food as it is, when prepared
according to my recipe. In later times, under the Romans, these
animals were kept in parks for the sake of their flesh; they came
to be fed to the sound of a trumpet, as I have seen done in
India.</p>

<p>Famous boar-hunters, such as Polyaenus and Xe-nophilus, dedicate
to sylvan gods the trophies of their chase, the animal's feet or
its hide (6, 34)--</p>

<p>This club, this bow, and these boar's feet here now Polyaenus as
a gift to Pan doth vow;</p>

<pre>
Quiver, dog-collar, to the mountain's lord,
His thanks for good boar-hunting to record.
Hill-scouting Pan! To Symylas' son this grace
In future grant, of good luck in the chase.
</pre>

<p>These trophies were suspended on appropriate trees, like deers'
antlers; and Lucilius (ir, 194) contrives a solemn skit after this
fashion about a certain boar-hunter who, enraged at being
unsuccessful with both hounds and spear, hangs up, as an offering
to the woodland deities, the hounds themselves--</p>

<pre>
To the hill-haunting Nymphs,cave-loving Pan,
The grot's blest Hamadryads, Satyr clan,
Having no luck with either hound or spear,
Marcus the dogs themselves hath hung up here.
</pre>

<p>We have the unavoidable reference to Hercules and the
Erymanthian boar. The feat of Admetus in yoking a lion and boar to
his chariot is alluded to (9, 466); there is also a poem by Archias
describing a bronze effigy of the CalydonSan boar, that monster
large as a bull and with tusks like those of an elephant, which
ravaged the land till Meleager and a chosen company of heroes and
heroines put an end to it. The tusks and skin were at first
preserved, like any other precious relic, in the shrine of Artemis
at Tegea; then Augustus, who had a weakness for such curiosities,
caused one of the teeth--the other was broken--to be transported
into a temple of Bacchus at Rome. Pausanias tells us that its
length was half a fathom. The hide, meanwhile, remained in the
museum-shrine at Tegea, where that traveller saw it in a sadly
decayed condition and deprived of all its bristles, as it may well
have been after a thousand years or more.</p>

<p>Now had this skin been a saintly relic deposited in some Roman
Catholic church, it would have been kept up to date and
periodically renewed--a system which is more spectacular but less
conformable to reason, and which therefore furnishes a microscopic
illustration of the difference between the religion of Hellas and
that of Saint Peter.</p>

<p>POSTSCRIPT. A friend who has glanced through the MS of what has
gone before, writes to say that the allusion to my recipe for
boar's flesh is "tantalizing"; he would like to know "more
details". The dish is not likely to appear on an English table, but
it is no professional secret. Of course you can make an appetizing
ragout of boar in almost any way: preferably salmi. What I was
thinking about, however, was something distinguished:</p>

<p>Trim a saddle of boar and give it a good shape; salt and pepper
it, and steep it for 12--14 hours in one litre of dry white wine,
together with the following seasoning:</p>

<p>100 grammes chopped onions<br>
<i>idem</i>............................carrots<br>
2 heads of garlic<br>
1 head of celery cut in slices<br>
1 bay leaf<br>
2 cloves<br>
10 grammes black pepper<br>
a pinch of parsley and thyme.<br></p>

<p>The saddle should be turned at frequent intervals, to absorb the
ingredients.</p>

<p>Now braise it in a stewpan over a slow fire together with the
above vegetable seasoning, adding 100 grammes of butter. Baste the
saddle with the liquor in which it was lying, and, when this is at
an end, with jus de viande. The operation should take about two
hours, according to the size of the saddle. Then remove from the
fire and strain through a sieve the liquor in which it was
lying.</p>

<p>The following hot and thick sauce must meanwhile be held in
readiness:</p>

<p>Put 30 grammes of sugar into a saucepan and melt brown over the
fire; then add a claret-glass of wine-vinegar and bring to the
boil. Now add the above strained liquor, together with 25 grammes
of roasted pine nuts, 20 grammes each of dried raisins, candied
citron peel cut into small squares, and currants (the latter having
previously been soaked in water), and 100 grammes of best powdered
chocolate. Stir well over the fire. If not sufficiently thick, a
little potato flour should be added.</p>

<p>Serve both as hot as may be. The saddle must be cut in slices
immediately, and the sauce poured over the whole. A single
non-assertive vegetable, such as puree of chestnuts or lentils--not
mashed potatoes: they have no cachet--should be served with this,
and a rough red wine will be found to marry well with the rather
cloying sauce.</p>

<p>"Not a dish for every day", some one may remark. Assuredly not.
The longer one lives, the more one realizes that nothing is a dish
for every day. And if anybody will take the trouble to dress a
saddle of mutton in the same manner, he will be pleasantly
surprised at the result. But I fear we shall go on roasting the
beast to the end of time.</p>

<p>The wild bull, the largest European animal, the urus of Caesar,
and possibly the bison as well, are referred to more than once--in
some noteworthy lines (6, 332) by the Emperor Hadrian, for
instance, which recount how Trajan offered to Zeus part of the
booty he won from the Getae in Hungary, including the horn of a
wild bull, <i>bous ouros</i>, artfully wrought about with
glittering gold.</p>

<p>And three poets--Antipater, Samus, and Philip of
Thessalonica--sing the praises of the King of Macedon, who killed a
monster of this kind by transfixing its forehead with his spear in
the mountain range of Orbelus, now Perim Dagh; the monarch
dedicated its hide and vast horns to Hercules, aptly enough, since
he traced his own descent from that heroic race. They speak of it
as <i>bous</i>, an ox; and Philip says that the horns measured
fourteen palms in length.</p>

<p>Addaeus, furthermore, tells of a certain brave Peukestes who, in
the same geographical region, at Doberus, encountered on horseback
a wild bull--he calls it <i>tauros</i>, a bull--which hurled itself
at him like a mass of rock. He drove his spear into the soft
temples; and ever afterwards, in memory of this exploit, "quaffs
wine out of its horns" (9, 300)--'</p>

<pre>
On horseback stout Peucestes the bull met
As from Doberus glen in wild onset
It crashed its bulk. Quick his Paeonian spear
He hurtled through its tender temples sheer.
Taking the horns as trophy, from out them he
Quaffs wine, and vaunts o'er his dead enemy.

<p>This last is quite a Nordic touch. It also suggests, though it
does not prove, that the beast in question was not the bison but
once more the <i>urus</i>, whose horns were of great length and are
described by Caesar as being encircled with silver at the rim and
used at drinking-bouts instead of tankards; an inference which is
supported by a passage in Herodotus, to the effect that the horns
of Macedonian wild bulls were exported to Greece. But the European
bison, the <i>bonasos</i> of Aristotle and <i>vison</i> of Latin
writers and <i>Wisent</i> of Germans, whose horns were so short
that nobody would think of exporting them, though it boasted of a
shaggy mane, occurred likewise in these same regions--occurred so
frequently that they were called "Paeonian oxen" according to
Pau-sanias, who adds that they are the most difficult of all
animals to take alive, because no net is strong enough to withstand
their charge. The Bistonian district of Thrace (= Bisontonian)
derives its name from them, as does the modern town of Besanaon and
several others. Oppian describes this Bistonian race as terrible
beasts resembling oxen, with manes like lions, and pointed, crooked
horns wherewith they toss men and animals into the air; and Solinus
contradistinguishes them from the <i>urus</i>. Homer's
<i>boagrios</i> seems to have been a bison rather than a
<i>urus</i>.</p>

<p>These two species, spread over a considerable part of ancient
Europe, were in great request at beast-fights. There is an
inscription in three Greek hexameters still extant--not in the
Anthology--on the death of some toreador of antiquity who, after
killing many wild bulls in the stadium, at last fell a victim to
one of them. The Planudean Appendix contains an anonymous epigram
on a statue depicting the combat of Theseus and the Bull of
Marathon--a dim memory, maybe, of pre-historic days when these
animals were still to be found in Greece itself. This is likely
enough, since remains of their ancestor, <i>bos primigenius</i>,
have actually been found in that country, near Megalopolis
(Heldreich p. 6). I cannot guess whether wild or tame bulls are
intended in that poem (9, 543) on the mounted Thessalian
bull-fighters who used no weapons save their hands; probably the
latter. In this case, it is the same exhibition as the "rodeo"
recently produced in London--</p>

<pre>
The Thessalian bull-fighters' well-mounted bands
Go out to meet the beasts with no arms in their hands,
But spurring on beside the coursing bull they bend
Over, and round his head like noose their arms protend;
With this their supple grasp they bring his high crest low,
And even such a mighty brute upon the ground they throw.
</pre>

<p>O. Keller has gone into the question of these two races of wild
cattle with his usual heart-rending thoroughness. He gives
documentary evidence to show that both of them lingered up to the
tenth century and later, their flesh being eaten as late as the
eleventh; then the urus became gradually absorbed into the
descendants of its own ancestors, namely, into tame cattle (it was
the link between them and <i>bos primigenius</i>); while the bison,
less tractable, died out everywhere save in the Causasus and the
Lithuanian forest of Bialystock where, to my own knowledge, it was
protected thirty years ago.</p>

<p>Fired by Keller's example, I have collected the following
further notes on these beasts, which may be of use to some student.
As more of a curiosity than anything else may be mentioned the fact
that Olaus Magnus, who died in 1558, names the "black urus"--it was
not black--among the animals of Scandinavia. That is in the
Introduction to his seventeenth chapter. He seems to have thought
better of it, for in the following chapter, where the description
ought to come, there is no mention of the animal. He is not always
reliable.</p>

<p>According to Gasparus Schottus' <i>Physica Curiosa</i>, 1667, p.
807, descriptions both of urus and bison are to be found in
Laurentius Surius (better known as Lipomanus) who is said to
contradistinguish between them and to declare that both still occur
in Lithuania. I leave it to others to go through the ponderous
folios of this hagiologist.</p>

<p>Prof. Sernander of Upsala kindly tells me that one of the latest
reliable accounts of the urus living in Poland is to be found in
Sigismund Heberstein's <i>Moscoviter wunderbare Historien</i>,
Bale, 1567; that Mr. N. O. Hoist, writing in the Proceedings of the
Stockholm Geological Society in 1889, mentions a specimen of the
urus--perhaps the last--which was shot in Masovia in 1620; and that
Adam of Bremen's account of both these species living in Sweden,
regarded as trustworthy by Keller (p. 60), is open to grave
question. In this he is supported by the well-known zoologist W.
Leche, whose article in the Swedish encyclopedia runs to the effect
that big herds of uruses arrived in the Scandinavian peninsula
after the end of the ice age, but did not survive there up to the
bronze or even later stone ages, though their bones have been found
together with flint implements of earlier periods.</p>

<p>The present South European buffalo has nothing to do with either
of these. It came to us from the East about 600 A. D. But it was
known already to Aristotle, if Aubert and Wimmer are right (as I
think they are) in identifying his <i>bous agrios</i> with this
buffalo.</p>

<p>Since we are in relatively boreal regions, what of the Scythian
Ass (Jacobs' Appendix, 324) whose marvellous horn, a godlike
ornament, was dedicated to Paian by Alexander of Macedon? Have we
here a fragment of a unicorn such as, in England, the tusk of the
narwhal, known as <i>monoceros</i> to mediaeval writers, was
thought to be? <i>Keras</i> is the word used; an uncompromising
one; it means a horn; indeed, the Greek and English words are
etymologically one and the same. And if it could be tortured into
signifying the horny substance of the hoof, such as every ass may
be supposed to possess--well, then the article in question, a
donkey's hoof, whether Scythian or not, would hardly constitute a
decorous gift for a reigning monarch to present to the Physician of
the Gods.</p>

<p>And the word employed for ass is equally unequivocal:
<i>kanthon</i>, that is a common pack ass. A horned pack ass, in
short. Or a unicorn?</p>

<p>There is a good deal of ancient unicorn-literature extant: I
will try to sum it up in a few words. The horse or ass element of
this beast is almost submerged in some old writers, who overload
their <i>monoceros</i> under a mass of fantastic items as to its
moral and physical attributes. Others, such as Phi-lostratus, seem
to have had the rhinoceros in mind, whereas Solinus distinguishes
one from the other. Two of the best describers of antiquity or of
any age, Herodotus and Aristotle, have left us the most convincing
and the simplest statements as to the <i>mono-ceros</i>. The former
locates its home in Africa; he has been followed by many others,
such as John Leo; the latest reliable account of its existence in
that continent dating from 1849 (see P. H. Gosse, <i>The Romance of
Natural History</i>, p. 289). Aristotle and his Indian Ass, and
Aelian and his Scythian Ass (which holds in its horn the water of
the Styx), followed by the trustworthy Abbe Hue and a good many
more recent writers--Prejevalski has a questionable
reference--speak of it as inhabiting not Africa but Asia; that is,
China, Tartary, Thibet and "India", which used to be a much looser
term that it now is, almost as loose as " Scythia " itself.</p>

<p>Perhaps European Scythia is here meant. In t hat case, it is
gratifying to find this splendid and u ncommon beast so near
home.</p>

<p>I must leave the reader of the epigram to decide for himself
whether it be a question of a genuine <i>monoceros</i>, or of an
"honest Indian ass, going for a u nicorn"; he can take his choice
of entering the domain of mythological (or extinct, or yet
undiscovered) animals, or of domestic ones. The following is the
close Latin rendering in Didot (III, 1, 99):</p>

<p>Tibi hocce Alekander Macedo cornu dedicavit, Paean,<br>
asini Scythici, rem quamdam mirabilem,<br>
quod Stygis puro Luseidis non domitum est<br>
liquore, sustinuitque aquae robur.</p>

<p>The mention of unicorns reminds me that there are singularly few
epigrams dealing with fabulous creatures of this kind and their
histories and transformations, which are such a charming ingredient
of Greek mythology. And those we have--on the Centaur, Minotaur and
suchlike--are devoted for the most part to describing works of art.
Here is a whole world of wonder left unexploited. The tragela-phos
is once named (Didot III, 5, 65).</p>

<p>The hare, <i>lagos</i> or <i>plox</i> (because it cowers), is
often named as one of the chief objects of the sportsman. It was
tracked with hounds--of two kinds, says Xenophon; a farmer knocks
out its brains with a stone, because it was seen nibbling his
grapes; hunters caught it in snares and complicated nets; they also
had a special staffer club for throwing at hares, the so-called
<i>lagobolon</i>. We have a reference (App. Plan. 358) to a bronze
statue of Pan, patron of hunters, clothed in a skin--he preferred
that of the lynx--and holding in his hand two of these
throw-sticks, an important missile once upon a time. The invention
of gunpowder has sent them out of fashion, and I, for one, should
be glad to know what the precise shape of such implements used to
be. Xenophon only mentions the weapon without describing either it
or the method of throwing; he says it should be held high.</p>

<p>Any stick, may be good enough to beat a dog with, but some
sticks are obviously better than others for casting at hares with
intent to kill or wound them. What kind of stick? Scholars have
presumably thrashed the matter out; by no means to my satisfaction,
if we are to take as an example Smith's <i>Dictionary of Classical
Antiquities</i> which tells us that this <i>lagobolon</i> was the
same as the Greek <i>korune</i>. and the Latin <i>pedum</i>, a
shepherd's crook. Rich's <i>Antiquities</i> is somewhat more
explicit and convincing; Dar-ernberg and Saglio's dictionary does
not contain the word.</p>

<p>The <i>korune</i>, like the Arab <i>matraque</i> of today and
the <i>kalaurops</i> of Homer (which is mentioned at least twice in
the Anthology, 6, 106 and App. Plan. 74, whereas the word
<i>chaios</i> does not occur) seems to have served three purposes:
as a weapon of offence, for throwing at sheep etc. with a view to
guiding them, and for catching them by the leg or the neck. While
therefore such a contrivance might be preferable to no stick at
all, the experience not of Theocritan neatherds but of professional
sportsmen must have suggested something more adapted for the
particular purpose of killing hares. They are easily disabled, once
hit; and whoever wishes to manufacture a serviceable
<i>lagobolon</i> will perhaps begin by shortening the <i>korune</i>
and making it lighter, so that two or more can be conveniently
carried about by one person. He will also place the curve nearer
the centre; <i>see</i> 6, 296, where it is called <i>gyron</i>,
rounded; Theocritus calls it <i>rhoikon</i>, crooked, and Oppian
<i>har-palagon</i>, which seems to mean the same thing. I daresay
he would give the missile a flattened construction on the principle
of the boomerang or maple seed, in order to facilitate that
whirling motion on which its success would largely depend, and
which seems to have been in the mind of Agis (6, 152) when he calls
the <i>lagobolon</i> winged or feathered, <i>ptenon</i>. I should
be inclined to stain it to a bright colour; this would minimize the
chance of loss among thick grass or brushwood. In any case, no
attention need be paid, I think, to the fact that <i>korune</i> and
<i>lagobolon</i> are actually treated as synonyms on occasion,
since we may take it for granted that the latter began by being a
specialized variety of the former, fashioned to a certain end--that
of killing hares, for which the <i>korune</i> was found to be
relatively unfitted. A modern instance: golfers might have
something to say if one gave them an instrument like the "club" of
Hercules to play with.</p>

<p>Canon Tristram describes the throw-stick still used in the East
as "about eighteen inches long and half an inch in diameter, which
is hurled with a revolving motion so as to strike the legs of a
bird as it runs, or, more frequently, at a little higher elevation,
so that when the game, alarmed at the approach of the missile,
begins to take wing, it is struck and slightly disabled. The
pursuers let fly a rapid succession of sticks"...My friend Mr.
Atchley writes: "I have never heard of any one's using a
<i>lagobolon</i>. I agree that a shepherd's crook would have small
chance against a hare. Possibly the crooks were shorter and heavier
in those days, something more like the cudgels or hockey-sticks
shown in the recently discovered hockey relief in the museum here.
They are there represented as knotted crooked cudgels, and
personally I should prefer such a weapon for use if my dinner
depended on my first catching my hare and then cooking him". So
much for <i>lagobolon</i>. I find no record here of that artful
method of calling up the hare by means of a special whistle, which
I have seen practised in some of the islands and which was in use
round Athens in the days of Chandler.</p>

<p>There is an epigram by Philippus of Thessalonica (6, 92) on a
certain goldsmith who, grown shortsighted with age, dedicates to
Hermes the implements of his calling, among them being the hares'
pads with which he was wont to gather up the shavings. And
Me-leager (7, 207) has written a lament on a pet leveret which the
fair-skinned Phanion cherished in her bosom and reared so lovingly
that it died of over-eating, fattened by too many dainties, and was
buried close to her couch in order that, dreaming, she might always
think of its grave close at hand--</p>

<pre>
Me yet a baby leveret did they wrest
Swift-footed, long-eared, from my mother's breast;
In her sweet bosom Phanion sheltering
Reared me on all the flowerets of the spring.
No more I wept my mother, yet I died
From surfeit of the too rich feast supplied.
Beside her couch I'm buried, so that she
Ever in dreams my grave near by may see.
</pre>

<p>The wounded Hector is made to compare himself to a dead lion
insulted by hares; he was thinking of the Latin proverb "mortuo
leoni lepores insultant". Rabbits or "Spanish hares" are not
mentioned, although they were well known, Polybius having left us
an adequate description of them which takes note of their burrowing
propensities. These propensities gave rise to a notable
rabbit-plague in antiquity; Pliny and Strabo tell of an embassy
sent to the Emperor Augustus by the Balearic islanders complaining
that the beasts undermined houses and trees till they fell down,
and asking for the help of the military to cope with them. Ferrets
were employed against them, as today.</p>

<p>Erhard gives a coloured map which shows the singular
distribution of hares and rabbits throughout the Cyclades. Strange
that he should have overlooked the existence of the latter
quadruped on Santorin; perhaps the pest was introduced on that
island after his death. He says that the Cyclades rabbits sometimes
surpass in size the average hare, and that the natives prefer their
flesh to that of the other. <i>De gustibus...</i></p>

<p>The word <i>dasypous</i> is not found in the Anthology.</p>

<p>The treatise on Hunting ascribed to the Oppian of the Halieutica
tells us a good deal about hares; among other things, that they run
faster in winter than in summer. We have an eight-line poem in
honour of this book (Didot III, 3, 142).</p>

<p>The list of the remaining wild animals is not a long one, for
the Anthology poets have found no occasion to mention many other
common or conspicuous ones, such as the weasel, fish otter, mole,
jackal, or the beaver, well known to the ancients and found at one
time on the banks of the Alpheus, or the dormouse--a table
delicacy--or that strange hooded seal which attracted much
attention in their day.</p>

<p>They did not always distinguish between porcupine and hedgehog,
and the pig-element in both these words will demonstrate that
moderns are also prone to connect, if not confuse, one with the
other. Yet two anonymous epigrams about Comaulus presumably refer
to the latter, the true echinos. In the first one (6, 45) he hangs
up alive, in honour of Bacchus, a bristling hedgehog which he
caught, rolled in a ball, sphairedon, while it was attaching his
grapes--</p>

<pre>
This hedgehog bristling with its pointed spines,
Gatherer of grapes and spoiler of the vines,
Having caught rolled like a ball his grapes among,
Comaulus has alive here up to Bacchus hung.
</pre>

<p>In the second (6, 169) he detects the beast carrying off grapes
on its spines, slays it, and dedicates it once more to Bacchus,
because it was stealing his gift to mankind. These are queer
statements. I should doubt whether a hedgehog ever ate grapes, even
if they grew within its reach, though it may well devour the
insects which cluster round the ripe ones. But Pliny repeats the
story and, what is more to the point, Lenz adduces modern evidence
to the same effect.</p>

<p>There is no reference in the Anthology to the porcupine under
its name of <i>hystrix</i> or <i>akanthion</i> (which corresponds
to the Italian vernacular substantive "spinoso") or
<i>akanthochoiros</i> (pricklepig). Both the latter, by the w.ay,
apply likewise to the hedgehog, and the modern Greek
<i>skantzohoiros</i> is a corruption of the last of these words.
Tristram says that the porcupine exists in Greece. I have never
heard of it there, nor does Heldreich include it in his list of
native mammals.</p>

<p>"You will never give the prickly hedgehog a smooth coat" (Didot
III, 6, 277).</p>

<p>Mice are often named; they are greedy, omnivorous, lovers of
darkness, of cheese and figs and bread and meal. They were caught
in traps. Ariston (6, 303) accuses them of gnawing his books--a
habit of theirs which has been responsible for a good deal of
mischief and for the loss of countless valuable documents in days
gone by--</p>

<pre>
Be it for bread, ye mice, you come, elsewhere
Then go (my hut houses but scanty fare)
Where you shall gnaw fat cheese and dried figs find,
Full satisfied when on these scraps you've dined.
If on my books again your teeth you whet,
Poor feast you'll have, and one you will regret.
</pre>

<p>There is also a poem (9, 310) about a mouse eating gold-dust--a
dinner which proved indigestible and too heavy for its stomach. It
was caught and cut open, and the stolen gold recovered, which
enables the writer to say that "even to dumb brutes is gold a cause
of evil". Theophrastus tells the same story of mice which live in
gold mines. And Tullius Sabinus (9, 410) records the impudence of a
mouse which gnawed through the string of a lyre. The strained chord
rebounded, throttling the mouse; plainly at the inspiration of
Apollo, to whom the lyre was sacred. The Anthology contains a
goodly number of these elaborate and insipid trivialities,
generally with a moral purpose in the background; there seems to
have been a craze for them at a certain period.</p>

<p>Lucilius has two mouse-pieces. Macron, a tiny little man, while
fast asleep, is dragged by a mouse into its hole. He wakes up and,
<i>though unarmed</i>, strangles his enemy, saying: "Father Zeus,
here you behold a second Hercules". The other (11, 391) is about a
miser--</p>

<pre>
Miser Asclepiades seeing in his house
A mouse, said "Dearest friend, what dost thou here
   by me?"
"Friend, fear thou nothing", smiling sweet replied
   the mouse,
"Not board, but only lodging 'tis, I seek by thee".
</pre>

<p>We have an enigma (Didot III, 7, 70) on the mouse--an uneatable
little beast whose name is formed of three letters; take away the
first of them, and you obtain a big eatable one (a pig).</p>

<p>The rat is not alluded to, which need not surprise us, since the
popular and poetic mind of Mediterranean countries contents itself
with observing the genera of animals; besides, their rat was a
small beast. The Italians of today do not distinguish between a
mouse and the imposing Norway rat except in scientific treatises,
and their word "topo" testifies to a further confusion, being
derived from <i>talpa</i>--a mole. So the modern Greek
<i>pontikos</i> signifies both mouse and rat.</p>

<p>Bats are twice mentioned; once in a feeble enigma about a "bird
which is not a bird, etc.", and again by Nicarchus (n, 96) who
complains bitterly at having to eat a dish of ten lean thrushes,
which he calls skeletons, bats of the field--</p>

<pre>
The woes that from Stymphalian Birds Arcadians knew
I feel, when these dead thrushes' bones I chew:
Like ten dry harpies they, an arid drachma's worth.
Out on you, wretched things! Field bats were you by birth.
</pre>

<p>He seems to have shared the taste of Horace and Martial, both of
whom declare thrushes to be a favourite dish of theirs. The birds
were fattened in cages by the ancients, and Columella gives the
little detail that their food, pounded figs and flour, was
sometimes chewed in the human mouth to make it more palatable to
them, and that many thrush-owners did this chewing themselves,
because men, whom one hired for the purpose, not only charged
exorbitant prices, but swallowed a good deal of the birds' sweet
food during the operation.</p>

<p>Of exotics, the monkey, <i>pithekos</i>, is named by Lucilius,
making fun of a woman called Bito with a snout three times as
hideous as that of a monkey, and who is therefore so unutterably
chaste that she dare not call herself a virgin; by Palladas, when
he tells of a woman that married a great monkey or ape--an ugly and
hirsute man, apparently--and produced a numerous brood of little
apes; and by Rufinus (5, 76) who talks of an old woman with false
hair and a face wrinkled like a monkey's--</p>

<pre>
Once full like spring her breasts and fair her face,
Ankles, height, brow, and hair, all full of grace:
But time, old age, grey locks, such change have wrought
That of her former self remains now naught.
Her hair is false, her face of wrinkles full,
No ancient ape could look so horrible.
</pre>

<p>Elephants (several references) are turreted for warlike purposes
and draw the Emperor's chariot; the rhetor Maurus has a proboscis
like an elephant.(11, 204). Ivory takes the place of our vulcanite;
so in a very curious enigma (14, 55) about a clyster.</p>

<p>There is an allusion (i, 69) to the camel's "not clean body" in
a Christian epigram about Rebecca. This has led us to domestic
animals once more. <a name="ch-3" id="ch-3"></a></p>

<h2>BIRDS</h2>

<p>Eagles, the creature of Zeus, the only bird which dwells in
Heaven (9, 223), are named in the Anthology over and over again. As
emblematic of bravery, this bird, like the lion, was sculptured on
the tombs of brave men; its figure on that of Plato (6, 229)
represented the aspiring element of his soul, that gazed into the
starry home of the gods. This poem has been translated several
times--by Shelley, among others. Here is a new rendering--</p>

<pre>
(a) Eagle! Whose is this tomb, why o'er it hoverest?
Why to the gods' starred home is thus thy gaze addressed?

(b) I'm Plato's imaged soul, which to Olympus flies,
While still in Attic soil his earth-born body lies.
</pre>

<p>Apollonides hymns the "holy eagle", that fowl of good omen,
which perched on the house of Tiberius just before he was recalled
from Rhodes; and two epigrams tell of an eagle which, pierced by an
arrow from a Cretan archer, fell upon the destroyer in its descent
to earth and killed him as well: such was the justice of Zeus. A
famous race-horse called "Eagle", which had won many prizes, is
described by Archias as now, in old age, fettered with a collar and
condemned to turn the rough stone which grinds the corn. There are
three oracles which play upon the word Eetion (<i>aietos</i>, an
eagle) and foretell what will happen to Corinth when Cypselus, son
of Eetion, becomes its tyrant.</p>

<p>The Ganymede escapade is worthily commemorated (12, 221)--</p>

<pre>
Soar, eagle, soar, to holy heaven convey
The boy upon thy pinions twain away:
Soar with soft Ganymede, nor let him fall,
Page of Jove's sweetest nectared carnival.
And, lest the god be grieved, do thou take heed
That thy bent claws make not the young lad bleed.
</pre>

<p>Crinagoras, who always does the right thing, whether he sends
flowers with his compliments to the ladies, or flasks of Indian
workmanship to gentlemen friends, or pen-nibs to industrious
schoolboys, has a polite effusion (6, 229) which accompanies a
little Sift of another kind, to wit, a toothpick--a noble
toothpick, fashioned from an eagle's quill and dyed to a lordly
purple colour: an attractive and efficient implement, very
different from what nowadays goes under the name of toothpick in
the Mediterranean basin--</p>

<pre>
This crook-beaked eagle's quill, sharpened by steel,
Stained with blue lacquer, which, after a meal,
Will deftly with its gentle point remove
The fragments that remain in a tooth's groove,
Your friend Crinagoras sends, Lucius, to you,
Trite festal token, sign of much love too.
</pre>

<p>The queer word <i>bytsaetos</i>, leather-eagle, is applied to
Kleon the tanner in a spurious oracle (Didot III, 6, 208) which
tells what will happen when the crook-heaked leather-eagle shall
seize the stupid dragon, the blood-drinker, etc.</p>

<p>Nothing of importance is said of vultures. The word
<i>aigypios</i> occurs, I think, only once, in an oracle (Didot
III, 6, 167) about the <i>aigypios</i> "with bent claws"--its old
Homeric epithet--snatching up the cricket, <i>akris</i>, and what
will then happen. Aristotle, speaking of this bird, says nothing
more than that it fights with the <i>aisalon</i>, falcon, and with
the eagle. <i>Aigypios</i> does not represent any particular
species. The etymology is doubtful; the word old and poetic, and
sometimes applied to the eagle (Thompson).</p>

<p><i>Gyps</i> is the term generally used for this fowl; it stands
for all kinds of vultures, which were commoner in Greece both then
and under the rule of the Turks, who appreciated, and doubtless
required, their services as scavengers. Lindermayer (1860) says of
<i>vullur fulvus</i> that it is so common a summer bird in that
country that one can see 20-25 of them sailing about the sky
together. Those days are over. Vultures are called eaters of
carrion in the Anthology, which is not surprising; there is a
flabby enigma about the <i>gyps</i> and its one-syllable name
(Didot III, 7, 59); the bird is also hinted at in some lines by
Julianus describing a statue of Prometheus. Strato suggests (12,
185) that vultures can eat figs:</p>

<pre>
Those youths who purple-clad so proud appear,
Whom, Diphilus, none of us can get near,
Are like ripe figs that on the high cliffs grow,
Devoured by vulture only or by crow--
</pre>

<p>and Lucilius, depicting the shop of a clumsy barber who hacks
his clients about with the razor, says that the establishment is
already full of flies, and, if he persists at the business, the
ravens and vultures will presently arrive.</p>

<p>There is no mention of the lammergeier, whose fateful blunder in
mistaking the bald head of Aeschylus for a stone and dropping a
tortoise on it, to break the shell, might have appealed to one or
the other of these poets. It is still to be seen in Greece, and one
of the minor griefs of my life is the loss of a lammergeier's egg
from Parnassus which Dr. Kriiper gave me long years ago.</p>

<p>The kite, <i>iktinos</i>, is barely named in Didot III (6, 277)
and again by Automedon (u, 324) when he compares to its rapacious
claws the hands of a certain Arrius who carries off all the food he
can snatch. Some of the qualities attributed by ancient writers to
the <i>iktinos</i> seem to me to apply with more propriety to the
goshawk or harrier species. Aristotle's <i>iklinos</i> is not
described with sufficient clearness to enable us to identify it for
certain with the kite. Two other hawks are named, each in a single
passage. The <i>kirkos</i> is found in an oracular reply to those
who asked concerning Aurelian's expedition against Palmyra (Didot
III, 6, 142). They were told that "the kirkos brings vast grief to
the doves, one to many; and they shudder at the murderer".
<i>Kirkos</i> is a poetic word, applicable to no particular
species; the root might lie in the onomatopoeic <i>krizo</i>--from
the peculiar cry of certain hawks. The falcon <i>hierax</i> occurs
in another oracle (Didot III, 6, 284). This is a generic term and
includes all the lesser birds of prey, even as does its modern form
<i>geraki</i>.</p>

<p>We have no allusion to other hawk-like birds. Yet all of them
must have been commoner in olden times, their rapid flight
protecting them against sling-stones and arrows--though not against
traps nor yet against birdlime which, according to Demetrius of
Constantinople (1270), was employed for catching hawks by the Greek
fowlers of his time; so common, maybe, that one took no particular
notice of them, as happens in the East today.</p>

<p>Nor is there any mention of falconry, a pastime familiar to
Aristotle and others.</p>

<p>I fail to discover more than a single reference (9, 380) to the
owl as <i>shops</i> ("if owls can sing like nightingales", etc.)
and only one to its other name of <i>glaux</i>, in a sepulchral
epigram by Dionysius (7, 716) who says that even this "tearless"
bird, the <i>glaux</i>, cannot but lament over the grave of a
certain Phaen-ocritus: which is disheartening, when one considers
the fame of the owl, past and present--</p>

<pre>
Too soon, Phaenocritus, and much desired of all
Who in Ialysus do sojourn, did'st thou fall
In Lethe's sea, after lettered harvesting so brief.
Even the tearless owls over thy tomb showed grief.
No singer's voice again new races e'er will greet
As sweet as thine has done, while men walk on their feet.
</pre>

<p><i>Glaux</i> is the little owl, <i>Athene noctua</i>, emblem of
old and new Athens; the other, the still smaller <i>Ephialtes
scops</i>. The word <i>nykteris</i>, in the sense of owl, occurs is
one passage (Didot III. 2, 234).</p>

<p>The little owl has become far rarer on the Akro-polis of Athens
than it used to be; and so has the lesser kestrel--both charming
and characteristic birds. Perhaps the place is once more accessible
to sportsmen like Lindermayer, who tells us that in the space of
two hours, and without changing position, he shot fourteen of the
latter at its entrance.</p>

<p>Ravens and crows, on the other hand, are frequently named. I
take <i>korax</i> to be the former and <i>korone</i> the latter;
they are the words applied to these respective fowl in Greece
today, and that should suffice; though which of the crow tribe is
meant by <i>korone</i> may be left undecided; all or any of them, I
should say--not excluding either the hooded crow, a common
Mediterranean bird, which seems to be slowly supplanting the
carrion crow, or even the raven itself, since the terms are apt to
be used indiscriminately by poets, according to the requirements of
their metre. They are well defined, however, in the ancient
Precepts of Chiron, which lay it down that a crow, <i>korone</i>,
lives for nine generations of old men; a stag for four generations
of crows; a raven, <i>korax</i>, for three of stags; and the
phoenix for nine of ravens. Supposing a man to be old at sixty, the
phoenix would therefore--if I can still multiply correctly--live
for 58,320 years. Ovid and others cut this figure down
considerably.</p>

<p>The old belief that the cawing of crows portends rain is
expressed in the epithet <i>ombrophoros</i> (Didot III, 6, 167)
applied to them; another epithet <i>is polios</i> (ibid. 6, 278)
which, taken in its primary colour-signification of grey, would
point to the hooded crow.</p>

<p>The word <i>korakinos</i> occurs once, in a three-line oracle
(Didot, III, 6, 284). It means either a young raven or a small
black fish of which I have spoken elsewhere (<i>Siren Land</i>, 2nd
Edition, p. 167); it may also signify the same as <i>korakias</i>,
a chough, alpine or marine. I should think the word, as used in
this oracle, might be translated "raven-brood". Didot gives two
Latin versions, in the second of which it is rendered as "fish";
here are both of them, and the reader can take his choice:</p>

<pre>
Ne credas: invidae enim cornices crocitant:
at tu accipitrem amare memento, qui tibi
adduxit vinctos Lacedaemoniorum coracinos.

Ne credas, odio crocitat quae percita cornix:
accipitrem sed ama, memor ut Lacedaemone multos
egerit ille tibi captos indagine pisces.
</pre>

<p>We have several jokes about old people living to thrice a crow's
age, <i>trikoronos</i>, and two references to white ravens, that
is, a prodigy (as we used to talk, in pre-Australian days, of black
swans), e.g. in the following anonymous lines (11, 417) in which an
elderly woman, who endeavours to gain the favour of a young man, is
compared to some one trying to do what is out of the question:
discover a white crow--</p>

<pre>
Acorns from other oaks, Menesthion, go and shake,
For wrinkled apples past their season I'll not take.
My fruit I've always liked in its best prime to be,
As I'm myself: why then a white crow try to see?
</pre>

<p>Albino ravens were known to Aristotle. White, the original
colour of this bird, was changed into black by Apollo, because he
was annoyed with it for bringing him some unsatisfactory news about
a girl called Koronis, in whom he had taken more interest than may
have been needful. Little of note is here said about either raven
or crow. Dioscorides applies the term <i>paidokorax</i>, boy-raven,
to a shameless youth; Korax was the name of a slave-child, possibly
a negro, which broke its neck falling down from a ladder (7, 632).
The name Korax was also given--not in the Anthology--to black
horses.</p>

<p>The raven is called a devourer of carrion, and Bianor (9, 272)
speaks of it as the servant of Phoebus (it afterwards became that
of Saint Oswald) in some lines which relate the fable of how a
thirsty raven filled up with pebbles a pitcher half full of rain
water, till the liquid could be reached by its beak--a proceeding
which would surpass the ingenuity of any bird. I daresay this
epigram is connected with a pretty old legend to the effect that
the raven was condemned by Phoebus, for dawdling on some errand, to
everlasting thirst. The origin of the legend may lie in the
fact--Oppian gives another explanation--that it likes living in
stony, waterless regions; and it requires little sagacity to
perceive that such a mode of life proves, not that it is always
thirsty, but that it is never thirsty.</p>

<p>With the exception of the Rhodian eagle above-named, I find no
reference here to those bird-omens in which the flight of crows
figured largely. The Greeks outgrew the augury-nonsense--it is
already derided by one character in Homer--more quickly than did
the Romans, whose cast of religion was sterner and accordingly less
reasonable; the practice was kept up by temple priests whenever
possible, as a source of revenue.</p>

<p>Nor is there any hint of those fables wherein the raven also
plays a conspicuous part--those fables, I mean, which consist in
making birds or beasts talk and act as if they were human beings: a
poor form of literature, which crept into Europe from the East
where it might well have remained, and whose antiquity is its sole
recommendation. Rutherford claims for the fables of Babrius that
they are not an importation, but indigenous to Greece. I am sorry
to hear it. In this connexion may be mentioned a curious Greek
bird-poem in 650 verses by an anonymous writer, presumably of the
fourteenth century, to which my friend D. P. Petrocochino has drawn
my attention. It is called Poulologos--a talking of birds, a
"bird-parliament", and sets forth the tale of a festival given by
the eagle in honour of his son's wedding, to which all the birds,
about forty in number, are invited. While feasting, they begin to
quarrel and abuse each other, till the eagle threatens to send the
falcon and the vulture to punish them; they finish proceedings in
peace and good humour. The poem, which contains many allusions to
contemporary life and events, was first published by W. Wagner with
other mediaeval Greek poems in 1874 (<i>Carmina Graeca Medii
Aevi</i>. Leipzig, p. 195-198); afterwards in Athens (1897) in the
annual of the literary association "Par-nassos", with notes by N.
X. Apostolides, Professor of Natural History in the Athens
University, who identifies all the birds named and says that the
poem reveals a close observation of nature. Among these fowls is
included the bat (<i>poutiki</i>).</p>

<p>As to the jackdaw, <i>koloios</i>--it is mentioned in an oracle
(Didot, III, 6, 281) and again by Antipater of Sidon (7, 713) who
contrasts unfavourably its multitudinous aerial cawing (no
unpleasant sound, to my ears) with the soft murmur of the swan;
even as the legions of contemporary poets, he adds, are not worth
remembering when compared with the scanty but inspired utterances
of Erinna. This poem about a muse among the jackdaws may have been
suggested by the Greek proverb "jackdaw among the Muses"--</p>

<pre>
Few are Erinna's lays, nor wordy are her songs,
But this her little work unto the Muse belongs.
Thus in remembrance she is held, no hidden thing,
That the black night conceals beneath its shadowy wing.

But we, the countless bards, O stranger, of today--
Our heaped-up myriads in oblivion pass away.
The low croon of the swan is better than in crowds
The jackdaws cawing far and wide through spring-time's clouds.
</pre>

<p>The talkativeness of the jay, <i>kissa</i> or <i>kitta</i>, and
its gift of imitating human or animal voices, is noted on three
occasions, one of them being a lament by Archias (7, 191) over a
dead bird of this garrulous kind--</p>

<pre>
To shepherds, woodmen and to fishers I
Of old would often, screeching loud, reply;
Oft like some Echo, many-voiced, again,
I'd strike with answering bill a mocking strain.
Me, tongueless, speechless, on the ground now see,
Having renounced my zeal for mimicry.
</pre>

<p><i>Kissa</i> is also translated as magpie in the dictionaries,
and the modern word <i>karakaxa</i> is similarly applied to both of
them on occasion, unlike as they are to each other. A plausible
solution of this difficulty is given on p. XLII of B. J. Rogers'
<i>Birds of Aristophanes</i>. The jay is the better mimic of
outdoor animal voices; in fact, I have never heard a wild magpie,
the most familiar of Greek birds, imitate them at all. Plutarch
who, like Cicero and other moralists, was not above telling a tall
story now and then, relates that a certain barber in Rome owned an
unusually intelligent jay, capable of imitating even the sound of
musical instruments. Once, during the funeral of a rich man, the
procession had a band which included trumpets; they were admirably
blown and remained for some little time in the barber's square.
From that moment onward the jay was stricken dumb. Neighbours
imagined that it had been bewitched by an envious trade-rival of
its owner, or that the resounding notes of the trumpets had
temporarily deafened it. They were mistaken. The bird was
practicing trumpet-notes all by itself. As soon as it had become
proficient it gave a perfect reproduction of them in public.</p>

<p>Starlings are the "devourers of seeds", the farmer's curse,
pilferers of the country's wealth; they are twice named as such,
and they share this distinction with the crane, blackbird and
thrush (wild geese might have been included), the crops being
protected against their inroads by a man armed with a sling, as in
some Oriental regions today. Babrius hints at this custom: "And a
lad ran at his heels with a sling. But the starlings from long use
would listen if he ever asked for the sling, and made oft before he
ever had it in his hand". A certain Alcimenes, while thus engaged,
with his eyes in the air rather than on the ground, was bitten
about the ankle by a dipsas viper, and perished miserably (7,
172).</p>

<p>The Anthology poets make a clear distinction between the songs
blackbird and of thrush; they attach much importance to the
former's music and none to that of the thrush which, indeed, is
rather a noisy and spasmodic rhapsody. Marcus Argentarius warns the
blackbird not to sing on an oak, because it bears the mistletoe,
whence they made birdlime; Theocritus hits upon an epithet worthy
of himself, <i>poikilotraulos</i>, to describe its variously
modulated notes (9, 437), and Rhianus (12, 143) wishes he were that
blackbird which, loudly complaining, was held in the hand of one of
his favourites--</p>

<pre>
Dexionicus, grasping blackbird he
Had limed and taken in a green plane-tree,
Made the holy bird shrill wail and piercing cry.
Know, Eros and ye Graces fair, that I
A thrush or blackbird in his hand were fain
To be, and ease with tearful voice my pain.
</pre>

<p>He calls the bird <i>hieros</i>, sacred, and a modern
commentator suggests that this should read <i>ammoros</i>,
luckless. The emendation might be happy, but for the fact that the
same adjective is applied to singing birds in two other epigrams as
well, by Archias and Antipater of Sidon; and also in the epitaph on
the fowler of Melos (see later). The blackbird was doubtless holy,
or consecrated to the gods, by reason of its sweet voice. We have
no exact equivalent for the word <i>hieros</i>; it is a more
cordial term than <i>holy</i> or <i>sacred</i>. In many cases
<i>blessed</i> comes nearest to the idea.</p>

<p>Pausanias, who mentions white deer, eagles, hares, bears and
even white boars, speaks of a race of white blackbirds on Mt.
Kyllene. Strange to say, Lindermayer (p. 86) confirms this. He says
"Albino blackbirds are pretty common on the Kyllene range in the
Peloponnese, a fact which Aristotle already noticed".</p>

<p>The above-named two poems by Archias and Antipater, as well as a
third by Paul the Silentiary, tell how a blackbird escapes
miraculously out of a snare, while thrushes are held fast--even
dumb traps showing their reverence for songsters. The fact that the
voice of the <i>kichle</i>, thrush, was not appreciated at all, and
that it seems to have appeared in numbers, offers some ground for
the suspicion that these writers may have been speaking of the
fieldfare--dictionaries give both meanings--or possibly of the
missel thrush, which also moves flockwise and whose song is an
indifferent performance. Aristotle has a separate word,
<i>trichas</i>, to denote what is unquestionably the song thrush.
There is a delightful account of thrush-catching, with snares and
birdlime, in the <i>Daphnis and Chloe of Longus</i>. The sport was
known to Homer.</p>

<p>Such birds, with us, might be called plunderers of fruit; were
we asked to name seed-destroyers we should probably call to mind
the finch tribe and the sparrow. Only three finchlike birds are
named in the whole Anthology, each of them only in a single
passage; and their three names may well stand for a single species,
namely, the goldfinch, which eats not seeds but thistle-down and
suchlike. This corroborates so far as it goes (it is not far) a
theory of mine to the effect that seed-eating' birds have increased
of late both in actual numbers and in breadth of range: the
Southern ones, like the serin, spreading to the North, and certain
others, like the redpoll, southwards.</p>

<p>The first of these three birds is the <i>akanthis</i>. It is
mentioned in a. poem (5, 292) to which I shall recur later, when
speaking of the tree-frog; it "twitters shrilly". <i>Akanthis</i>
is generally rendered as goldfinch; Didot translates it thus
(<i>carduelis</i>]; Sundevall suggests the linnet, and modern
naturalists have given the name <i>akanthis</i> to the whole
linnet-tribe. It seems to me that Bikelas is right in identifying
the <i>akanthis</i> with the siskin, still called <i>skathi</i>--a
noticeable little spring visitor, more noticeable than the linnet.
The ahanthis of Aristotle is "poorly coloured"; it cannot therefore
be the goldfinch, which also does not "twitter shrilly", whereas
the siskin does.</p>

<p>The second of them is the <i>akanthylis</i>. "The
<i>akanthylis</i> sings more sweetly": this occurs in a summer-song
(Didot III, 3, 189) written in imitation of those earlier ones by
Meleager and others. D'Arcy Thompson takes it to be the goldfinch
in all probability; Didot once more renders <i>carduelis</i>. What
Aristotle says as to its nest, however, inclines others to believe
it may be the long-tailed tit. These are his words: "The nest of
the <i>akanthyllis</i> is artfully constructed, for it is woven
together like a flaxen globe (<i>sphaira</i>), having a small
entrance".</p>

<p>The third is the mythical <i>akalanthis</i> (Didot III, 6, 277).
It figures in some lines from Aristophanes' <i>Peace</i> which are
full of zoological conundrums, and that particular line is pure
nonsense: "When the bell-akalanthis (? bell-voiced) in a hurry
brings forth a blind brood". Dictionaries render <i>akalanthis</i>
as synonymous with <i>akanthis</i>, that is, goldfinch or linnet.
The word is found in Vergil's <i>Georgics</i> and is usually
translated as goldfinch.</p>

<p>Be these three birds what they may--and Warde Fowler is inclined
to identify all of them with the warbler rather than the finch
tribe--it is certainly surprising that a species so common as the
goldfinch, of such bright coloration and pronounced habits, so
marked and popular a bird, in short, should be not clearly defined
by Aristotle. Two vague ones of his suggest the goldfinch, and not
only by reason of their significant names: the <i>poikilis</i>
which is at enmity with the lark (? because both goldfinch and lark
are lovers of open spaces), and the <i>chrysometris</i> which lives
on thistledown.</p>

<p>And although the early-chattering swallow is more than once
alluded to, there is no talk whatever of that pest, the
early-chattering sparrow. Yet they ate the sparrow and studied its
habits; they noted its amorous propensities and distinguished
between the house and the tree sparrow (Alexander the Myn-dian,
quoted by Athenaeus). One would like to know when this horrible
little fowl began to attach itself to mankind, ousting, with its
pertinacious vulgarity, so many more attractive ones. Some of those
mentioned in early literature, beginning with the Bible, may not
have been sparrows at all but the <i>passer solitaries</i>, the
rock thrush. Homer's "sparrow" was any species of small bird, even
as modern Italians speak of "passerotti" in exactly the same sense.
I shall risk no opinion as to the species of Lesbia's pet; certain
it is that sparrows are reared in cages to this day for the sake of
their song. And when taken young out of the nest and so kept apart
from the crowd of their fellows--and not over-fed, else they burst
inside--they do begin to strike up a little tune of their own (I
have heard it) and to conduct themselves after the reasonable
fashion of other birds; they unlearn their gregariously screeching
habits, even as men might do, if they were brought up among
surroundings that foster more self-respect.</p>

<p>Though the ancients had a great affection for both nightingale
and swallow, and bound one to the other by a complicated and tragic
association, I find nothing here of outstanding merit on either of
these birds. Northern poets have sung of the former with more depth
of feeling than have those of the Anthology, who content themselves
for the most part with similes, or with references to the tale of
Procne and Philomela (such as 9, 451 and 452)--a domestic scandal
which puts the claim of these birds to our sympathy on a broader
and, so to speak, humanitarian basis; it would have us love their
music not for its sound alone but for its sad legendary memories as
well.</p>

<p>Christodorus says that a nightingale settled on the lips of
Stesichorus at birth (to explain the melodiousness of his verse);
Herodotus is described as the "inspired nightingale of
Halicarnassus"; Alcman is also compared to this bird; Nossis speaks
of the comic writer Rhintho as a "small nightingale of the Muses";
a mother too bereaved of her six children mourns like a
"nightingale on the grave-stones"; in the well-known lines by
Callimachus the poems of Heraclitus are called "Nightingales", and
Marianus Scholasticus tells of the nightingales and cicadas
answering each other in a famous pleasaunce called Eros.</p>

<p>The song of this bird, as well as that of the swallow, is
likened (for instance, in 6, 247) to something not very
intelligible--the regular noise made in weaving by the
<i>kerkis</i>, which small dictionaries translate as "the weaver's
comb, the shuttle containing the spindle". I should observe that
these are two quite different objects, and that with old-fashioned
looms, whether high-warp or low-warp, I have never heard any noise
save the irregular creaking of the woodwork. Be that as it may, no
modern poet would contrive such a metaphor, nor dream of bringing
what seems to have been a purely mechanical sound into connection
with the music of any song-bird. That the nightingale's voice, in
spite of its beauty, can become a source of annoyance by driving
away sleep, is discovered--not for the first time, I should
think--by an anonymous writer (12, 136); he inveighs against the
nocturnal concert of these birds, which he calls "talkative women"
in allusion to Philomela, and in disregard of the fact that the
male alone is responsible for the uproar--</p>

<pre>
Ye chattering birds, why clamour so? Don't vex
Me as I lie warmed by my love's soft skin:
Leaf-loving nightingales, loquacious sex,
Sleep quietly, I beg, and cease your din!
</pre>

<p>I delay a moment, to refer to what might be said of the danger
of diluting the "epigraphical flavour" of such poems. In the
version just quoted the quatrain is translated as I think it should
be. Here is another rendering, printed some twelve years ago in
London, in which that pitfall of redundancy has not been
avoided--</p>

<pre>
Ye chattering birds, O why disturb my rest,
AVhile I am lying nigh the tender breast
Of my dear lad? I pray ye cease to vex:
Though, songsters by the ivy hid, the female sex
May always chatter loud, 1 pray that ye
Will cease your song and bring back peace to me.
</pre>

<p>If Simmias of Rhodes be author of the lines known as the "Dorian
Nightingale's Egg" (15, 27) and others of that kind, he is a
literary phenomenon; the precursor of those later poets who
indulged in similar <i>vers figures</i>. He cut his poems into the
shape of what they described, besides inventing other complexities
which make them read like nonsense until you hit upon the key. This
particular freak of his imitates with success the form of a
nightingale's egg; it contains approximately the same amount of
substance.</p>

<p>The swallow was to the ancients what the robin is to us. Its
friendliness to man, its graceful shape and movement, its
cleverness at nest-building and charming home life--they were all
lovingly observed; besides and beyond all this, it was the herald
of spring. The swallow-song preserved by Athenaeus is among the
happiest inspirations of bird-poetry. Here, in the Anthology, there
is nothing like this, save the playful and neatly turned lines (4,
122) to a swallow which are attributed to Evenus--</p>

<pre>
Child of Athens, honey-nurtured, wouldst thou for thy feathered brood
A prattling cicada capture, feasting them upon such food?
Shall garrulous on garrulous, winged on the winged prey,
And shall the guest of summertime be summer-guest's purvey? (<i>A new substantive</i>. No matter!)
Wil'st thou not drop it instantly? Neither just nor meet this wrong
That singer's mouth should swallow up another skilled in song.
</pre>

<p>This poem has been happily paraphrased by William Cowper. I
prefer the above version; it is closer to the original. We have a
fine quatrain, moreover, by Mnasalcas on that deplorable little
affair of Tereus, and another (9, 57) by Pamphilus--</p>

<pre>
Why all day long, Pandion's ill-starred child,
Dost twitter mournfully? Is this thy plaint
Grief which thou feelest that thou wert defiled
By Thracian Tereus, using dire constraint?
</pre>

<p>Two other poets, Leonidas of Alexandria and Philippus, write of
a swallow which has dared to build its house in the corner of a
picture of Medea, murderess of her children; they warn it to
forsake the accursed spot. Agathias, in some tearful lines about
his beloved Rhodanthe (5, 237), complains, like the writer in the
Anacreontea, of the chatter of these birds which keeps him awake in
the early dawn.</p>

<p>The ancients seem to have taken little account of the swallow's
value as insect-destroyer.</p>

<p>Turning to other birds, we find the conspicuous hoopoe not
exalted as it is elsewhere. Its rocky abode is mentioned (it nests
in crevices and tree-holes) by Agathias, in the tearful verses
above referred to; and the bird re-appears in a ten-line poem about
two men who consult it in its human character of Epops (Didot III,
3, 89). I can find nothing more about the hoopoe.</p>

<p>There is an interesting epigram (5, 205) on the figure of a
wryneck, <i>jynx</i>, engraved upon an amethyst and set in gold as
a love-charm. The real bird was subjected to this indignity, and
the charm became operative when it was spread out upon a wheel so
that its wings and feet should form the four spokes; this was the
magical wheel which, on being spun round to an incantatory song,
had compelling powers and was employed for recovering unfaithful
lovers. The practice, for which there was a technical expression,
is mentioned more than once in ancient literature; for the first
time, I believe, by Pindar: "And there the Queen of keenest darts,
the Cyprus-born, first brought to men from Olympus the frenzied
bird, the speckled wryneck, binding it to a four-spoked wheel
without deliverance, and taught the son of Aison to be wise in
prayers and charms etc." I am not sure whether the writer of this
poem was referring in line 2 to boys or girls; the potency of the
charm may have been such as to lure brides from their nuptial
chambers, or little children out of the women's apartments, or as
translated here (Didot's Latin version has <i>putros</i>)--</p>

<pre>
Niko's wryneck, which can draw from over-sea
A man, or boys from their shy privacy,
Carved in clear amethyst, with a gold border round,
And in soft flocks of purple lamb's wool bound,
The witch of Larissa to thee, Kypris, presents,
To be one of thy treasured ornaments.
</pre>

<p>According to Kruper, the wryneck is a rare bird in Greece and
Asia Minor. I have seen it on the islands during migration, but not
on the continent. "Not rare in olive groves", says Lindermayer.</p>

<p>The woodpecker, under the somewhat unusual appelation of
<i>dryokolaptes</i>, figures in an oracle (Didot III, 6, 278).</p>

<p>Both the cuckoo and the lark are described as poor songsters (9,
380), which sounds less strange when we realize that the commonest
Greek lark is the crested kind. Aesop credits this bird with
cunning, and Antiphilus in the following lines with simplicity (5,
307): neither of them is wrong--</p>

<pre>
By Sparta's stream, the Eurotas, with naught on
Stands Leda, near her Zeus disguised as swan.
Love-laggard I, what bird must I change to,
With Zeus a swan? Perhaps a lark would do.
</pre>

<p>A parrot is hymned in some fulsome verses (9, 562) by the
courtly Crinagoras--so loyal a parrot that, having learnt to say
"Hail" to the Emperor, it taught the wild woodland fowls to do the
same--</p>

<pre>
A parrot, bird that can
Talk with the voice of man,
Leaving his wicker cage
Spread out towards the woods his gay plumage.

And as he'd always been
Assiduously keen
To greet great Caesar's name,
Upon the hills he did it just the same.

The birds, anxious to learn,
With rivalry then burn,
Striving who first should be
To cry "Hail" unto the deity.

Orpheus on the mountains wild
The animals made mild,
But now, unbidden, all
The birds on thee, Caesar, melodious call.
</pre>

<p>There was a fashionable cult of parrots in Imperial Rome; both
Ovid and Statius have written poems on the death of parrots, and
Apicius gives an appetizing recipe for cooking them. This concludes
the list of birds mentioned in the Anthology, save such as are
noticed hereafter.</p>

<p>We have a number of allusions, however, to fowling, to snares of
various kinds for feet and necks of birds, to traps and nets, and
to birdlime which the fowler carried about with him, spread on
canes--canes that could be fitted into each other and so lengthened
out after the manner (says Mr. W. R. Paton) of a fishing-rod. The
practice is referred to in Bion's idyll of Love and the boy-fowler.
The invention of gunpowder has brought most of these implements
into disuse, besides making the birds both shyer and scarcer.
Decoy-birds and birdlime, for which the old name ixos has been
revived, though prohibited, are still used in Greece to catch
chiefly goldfinches, and also chaffinches and green linnets.</p>

<p>The reader will find some notes on modern Greek fowling in
Macpherson, pp. 22, 248, 309, 377, and 393. A great destruction of
bird life now goes on in Greece, and one wonders what percentage of
the 354 species claimed for that country by Lindermayer in 1860 are
still to be found. He, by the way, describes (p. i6c) how they used
to catch duck in what was then the Kopais lake, and was a miserable
sinner himself in this respect. Of the lovely whiskered tern he
writes: "They take not the slightest notice of the sportsman; if he
keeps quiet, they will fly right over his head. When the first shot
is fired and the bird drops into the water or on the ground, the
whole flock of them draw near with lamentable cries, and bewail the
unhappy fate of their comrade. In such moments one can fire off
fifty shots, and each shot will bring down one or two or three of
them".</p>

<p>There is an epigram by Isidorus of Aegae (7, 156) on a
bird-catcher called Eumelus who, well supported by his craft, died
at the patriarchal age of ninety after a life of happy freedom. An
anonymous poem is in the shape of a pretty address by a fowler to
some bird (9, 209). Two other writers have done epitaphs on a
famous fowler, Poernander of Melos. This is what Mnasalcas (7, 171)
says of him, in the free version of my friend Dr. F. W. Mann, to
whom I am also indebted for the invocation to Pan on the
title-page--</p>

<pre>
Amid the foliage of this solemn plane
The holy bird now rests his rapid wing.
Hark, how they all in merry tumult sing:
"Poemander's dead! Harmless his fowling-cane!"
</pre>

<p>We find epitaphs on the following birds: a cock, a decoy
partridge, jay, sweillow, and elaios. The last-named, a quatrain by
Tymnes (7, 199), in the rendering of the friend I have just
mentioned, will give some idea of their quality--</p>

<pre>
Elaios bird, on whom the Graces dote,
Thou who didst modulate thy tender note
To wail of Halcyon--
Among the pathways of the star-strewn skies
Linger sweet echoes of thy lullabies,
But thou, dear bird, hast gone!
</pre>

<p>I pause again, to say that this is what one might call a
"transfusion" rather than a translation: a method that has perils
of its own, as can be seen by the following colourless lines on the
same theme which were printed in America some years ago--</p>

<pre>
Thou favourite of the Graces,
Who into air did send
Glad carols without end,
Now thou art snatched away,

All the dear sunlit places
That were thy haunts of old,
And thy sweet roundelay,
The paths of darkness hold.
</pre>

<p>The names <i>elaios, eleia, eleas</i> and <i>elea</i> represent,
I think, two separate birds. The last-named, described by
Aristotle, has been identified by Sundevall and other scholars as a
kind of reed-warbler--rightly, I should say. Aristotle notes, among
other things, that it is small but has a good voice, which is
exactly what Callimachus says of his <i>eleia</i>. The reedwarbler
is common in Anthology regions, but I question whether its voice
deserves the unusual praise given to it in this particular poem; a
pleasantly scolding little song, I call it, which you can imitate
fairly well by writing with an old-fashioned quill pen. It is not
the <i>elaios</i> of these verses.</p>

<p>What that bird was, comes out clearly in a statement quoted by
Athenaeus from Alexander the Myndian, who tells us that the
<i>elaios</i> is the same as the <i>sykalis</i>, the fig-pecker or
beccafico. Now the fig-pecker is the garden warbler, whose lay is
without a question superior to that of the reed-warbler. The
passage runs to this effect: "One of the tits is called by some
people elaios and by others pirrias; but when the figs become ripe,
it gets the name of sykalis (<i>sykos</i>, a fig.). And there are
two species of this bird, the sykalis and the
<i>melankoryphos</i>". This, in my opinion, should settle the
question, besides testifying to the intelligence of him who
realized the close relationship between the garden warbler and the
blackcap (melankoryphos: a name which was certainly also applied to
some species of blackheaded titmouse). The blackcap in movement
might well be mistaken for a kind of tit; not when it sings its
exquisite melody.</p>

<p>Martial calls the <i>elaios</i> by its Latin name of ficedula,
fig-eater. It is still known as "<i>fucetola</i>" in South Italy,
and Linneaus introduced <i>ficedula</i> into scientific
nomenclature. Martial says that because the bird eats also grapes,
it should rather be known as <i>uvedula</i>, grapes being the
worthier food. This statement is founded on bad observation. The
bird devours neither figs nor grapes, but only the insects which
cluster round them when they are ripe. It was a great table
delicacy, and the only fowl which the epicures considered should be
eaten bones and all (Aulus Gellius, quoting old Favorinus). As a
curiosity may be mentioned that an English translator renders
<i>elaios</i> "sea-mew".</p>

<p>One point is worth noting. Be the <i>elaios</i> reed-warbler or
garden warbler, the song here commemorated must have been listened
to in the open country, since (unless I am mistaken) neither of
these birds can be kept in cages. Indeed, the Anthology contains no
reference to the custom of keeping birds in ca'ges for the sake of
their song, much as its poets delighted in their music out of
doors. Yet aviaries were well known to antiquity, and the cult of
tame song birds, chiefly nightingales, grew to a mania under the
Roman Empire. Nor is there mention here of birds' plumage being
used for any kind of ornament. Cleopatra wore a few peacocks'
feathers as a state robe. Perhaps she wore something else as
well.</p>

<p>When one considers its poetic nature and the other qualities
which endeared it to the ancients of various nationalities, it is
surprising to find the turtle dove, <i>trygon</i>, barely mentioned
in the Anthology. It occurs, as a symbol of chastity, in a
Christian epitaph (Didot III, 2, 734); in a spurious oracle
(<i>ibid</i>. 6, 278); and again in the diminutive form
<i>trygonion</i>--the pet name, here, of a dancing eunuch, votary
of Cybele, whose death is commemorated by Philodemus in some
strangely touching lines, which compare his charms to those of Lais
(7, 222). That is all I have been able to discover.</p>

<p><i>Peleia</i> might be either the wild rock dove or its tame
descendant. There are two sepulchral epigrams (Didot III, 2, 669
and 670) which tell of pigeon-lofts that were built on the summit
of high tombs, presumably for the sake of security. The bird is
called the "well-winged peleia". It was also an emblem of timidity
(7. 161).</p>

<p>The same bird is mentioned twice under its other name of
<i>treron</i>; it is the prey of hawks, and of foxes (Didot III, 6,
142 and 277).</p>

<p>Here is also the woodpigeon, <i>phassa</i>, which makes its home
in the leafy foliage of the oak (9, 71). It is translated as "dove"
in Goldwin Smith's version of this poem,.which I will quote by way
of a change: its succinctness is not its only charm--</p>

<pre>
Aerial branches of tall oak, retreat
Of loftiest shade for those who shun the heat,
With foliage full, more close than tiling, where
Dove and cicada dwell aloft in air,
Me too, that thus my head beneath you lay,
Protect, a fugitive from noon's fierce ray.
</pre>

<p>The <i>oinas</i>, which is generally taken to be <i>columba
oenas</i>, though Thompson prefers to identify it with the
rock-pigeon, does not occur in these pages, nor yet
<i>peristera</i>, save as the name of a little girl who died at the
age of seven, lamented by Leonidas of Tarentum (7, 662).</p>

<p>Of game birds proper, we have three kinds here. Quails were
given as presents to boys (like geese or nightingales or doves or
fighting cocks or other birds), with the alleged object, I
imagine--whatever the real one may have been--of their figuring in
the then popular quail-fights, nowthe delight of the Chinese, which
young people were encouraged and even obliged by law to attend, in
order to learn plucky habits; though nowadays, adds the poet
Glaucus (12, 44), youngsters have grown too sophisticated and
rapacious for such simple gifts. They were appreciated as food,
after being lured by means of a special whistle towards the fowler
who then threw his net over them, as he does to this day. These
whistles are often used in the South, although the call-note of the
quail is so easy to imitate after a little practice that they are
scarcely required. There is no reference to blinded decoy-birds, a
system which is still common in the case of quails. The ancients
blinded pigeons for this purpose, and Arabs of today sew together
the eyelids of their decoy-doves (Tristram).</p>

<p>As to partridges, Simmias has an epitaph (7,203) on the death of
his favourite decoy partridge--</p>

<pre>
No longer, my decoy wild partridge, from thy throat
Rings through the umbrageous wood that resonant clear note,
Luring thy pencilled mates that feed beneath the glade;
For thy last journey thou to Acheron hast made.
</pre>

<p>I have already referred to the death of another pet partridge,
that of Agathias, which was devoured by a cat.</p>

<p>Pheasants--<i>phasianos</i>: the word <i>tetrax</i> does not
occur--are only once mentioned, their digested remains figuring
among the human excreta of a public convenience near Smyrna (9,
642). I doubt whether pheasants still occur wild in Greece, as they
did in the days of Lindermayer (p. 123).</p>

<p>Strange that the woodcock should not be named, nor even
peacocks, in view of their manifold uses to the poets, such as in
the tale of Argos. They were introduced into Athens from Samos, and
people came all the way from Sparta and Thessaly to look at them.
While still uncommon, says Aelian, a pair was exhibited at the
beginning of each month to Athenian lovers of beauty, and the
charge for admission was a considerable source of gain.</p>

<p>The ostrich, on the other hand, is noted several times; somebody
is accused by Julian Antecessor (u, 367) of having a face like an
ostrich. It must have been a face worth looking at, for this bird
has certainly the most brainless expression of any on earth--</p>

<pre>
Like ostrich's thy face! Has Circe stirred
For thee some potion, which made thee a bird?
</pre>

<p>Ducks, which were kept tame and eaten, are not mentioned here;
we have water-loving geese, however, with the unfortunate epithets
of <i>polios</i> and <i>charopos</i>, which give no sure clue to
their colour. Their fat, which was used as an aphrodisiac--it is an
emetic to me--is here described as a delicacy (9, 377). There are
no references to <i>foie gras</i>, although it was so fashionable
at one time that the Romans went to the trouble of importing it
from Germany, because that country produced larger livers than
their own_</p>

<p>The ancients never shared our notion as to the stupidity of the
goose, which is not only a most affectionate bird but an unusually
intelligent one as well. Ovid calls it wiser than the dog. On the
tomb of a certain house-wife (7, 425) was figured a goose, as
symbol of her careful guardianship. Those that were viewed as
"protectors of the house" or sacrificed to the gods must have been
of the tame kind; from the epitaph on a fowler called Ariston (7,
546) we also learn that the greylag1, or perhaps the bean goose,
was stalked while feeding warily, and then shot with a sling--an
undertaking which would require no little patience and cunning
nowadays; would be, in fact, a hopeless business, a wild-goose
chase. It makes one realize that certain birds were either more
abundant than they are at present, or more confiding, or both--</p>

<pre>
Sling had Ariston, furnishing scant food.
Wherewith to shoot wild geese through the devise
Of stealing by hid way, and thus elude
Them as they fed with sidelong-glancing eyes.
Now he is in Hades; unhandled his sling
Hangs mute, and o'er his tomb the game takes wing.
</pre>

<p>There is no word in the Anthology about pelican or ibis or
flamingoes, noticeable waterfowl though they be.</p>

<p>The crane is mentioned several times. We have the inevitable
reference to Ibycus and his cranes, and to the battles between
cranes and pigmies; we learn that the bird was trapped in nooses
which caught it by the neck. Macpherson alludes to this system (p.
444): "Another ruse of Greek origin was that of baiting a snare
with a bean placed on some straw at the top of a reed. The crane
endeavoured to appropriate this morsel of food and unwittingly
thrust its head into the noose, which, by the way, was weighted
with a stone, so that the bird might not fly away".</p>

<p>The crane was called Bistonian, from its home about the lake of
that name, now Burughiul; its habits of plundering the crops, of
screaming loud, of moving its head from side to side as it walks,
and of flying at a great height, are noticed by these writers; not
so the curious triangular formation while in flight, nor its
qualities as an article of food.</p>

<p>As in England under Henry VIII, it was appreciated by both
Greeks and Romans who kept it in aviaries for the market, and
sometimes sewed up its eyes to fatten it better (Plutarch), though
it is difficult to understand why those from Melos (Varro) should
taste better than others. Apicius gives the recipe of one or two
sauces for roasted cranes. I suspect that fowls of this kind were
eaten, like swans or peacocks, rather on account of their imposing
size than for any flavour which their flesh might possess. The bird
must have been far commoner than it is now, to judge by the many
allusions to it in older literature. It used, for instance, to be a
regular spring visitor to Italy; Redi (1671) notes the
extraordinary punctuality with which the flocks arrived year after
year in the plain of Pisa, where nowadays nobody has ever heard of
such a fowl.</p>

<p>I hesitate what to think of the anonymous sepulchral epigram (7,
543) which recounts the fate of sea-faring Theogenes whose ship,
while in the Libyan sea, was sent to the bottom by an immense flock
of tired cranes alighting on her "like a cloud". What were the crew
about? Rather than be drowned by the weight of these birds, they
should have wrung their necks and thrown them overboard. It is
difficult to conceive a flock of cranes grown weary from flying;
they move like clockwork and know to an inch the distance they have
to traverse. A persistent gale of wind may have driven these out of
their course, and tired them out at sea. Once on the ship, if it
was a small one, the disaster is within range of possibility. The
passenger pigeon weighs far less than the crane, and Alexander
Wilson (quoted in Wallace's <i>Darwinism</i>) says of a
breeding-place of these birds in Kentucky that "it was dangerous to
walk under these flying and fluttering millions, from the frequent
fall of large branches, broken down by the weight of the multitudes
above, and which in their descent often destroyed numbers of the
birds themselves". Audubon gives a similar account of the.
passenger pigeon. And Pliny says that quails migrating by night
sometimes rush in such quantities into ships' sails as to cause
them to sink.</p>

<p>Antiphilus has the only reference to the heron, erodios, which I
can discover (9, 551). It tells how the bird came to be unpopular
at Chalcedon--opposite Byzantium--and to earn the epithet of
traitor; because by standing in the shallow part of the sea and
fishing there it showed to some enemies of the town where the water
could be forded. Whatever this water was, it cannot have been the
deep Bos-phorus. The ancients often speak of the heron as a
sea-bird; it certainly has a fondness for salt lagoons connected
with the sea. This poem is not altogether intelligible, and there
is a formidable note on it in the Didot edition of the
Anthology--</p>

<pre>
The ill-omened heron doth Chalcedon scourge with hate:
Why always traitor-bird 'tis called, let Phoebus state.
When in the shallow sea, standing on its slim legs
And pecking up the food from out the sandy dregs,
There to the city crossed from opposite the foe,
Having seen that through the shoal 'twas possible to go.
Stone the bad bird, for it from the enemy full meed
Obtained, the traitor-fowl--both conches and sea-weed.
</pre>

<p>There is only one mention, too, of the stork, <i>pelargos</i>, a
bird to which I shall return when speaking of the lizard. This is
in a derisively humorous and obscure epigram addressed to a certain
Metrophanes and calling him, among other things, an exquisite stork
(n, 345). He may have been a long-legged dandy of some kind--</p>

<pre>
A stork divine art thou, Metrophanes, swan-face,
Shock-head, waggling thy pate around with crane-like grace,
And letting thy long hood trail all about the place.
</pre>

<p>And the same with the night raven, <i>nycticorax griseus</i>. It
is once named, but it gives Nicarchus (11, 186) occasion for an
excellent couplet:</p>

<p>The night raven's song bodes death, but when Demophilus sings,
the night raven itself dies.</p>

<p>I am aware that this <i>nycticorax</i> has been identified with
the eagle owl. The eagle owl, however, does not croak like a
raven--not at all; it says "Oohoo" in deep and solemn tones;
whereas the note of <i>nycticorax</i> is almost undistinguishable
from that of the raven, and disquieting music in the darkness. (Of
course it never "sings", as Milton makes it do, any more than does
the common raven). For the rest, the bird is still held to be of
bad omen, and is called <i>nyktokorax</i> in Greece to this day;
<i>cf</i>. also the German <i>Nachtrabe</i>. I think any one who
has heard the nocturnal cry of this fowl, and been in a position to
compare it with the diurnal one of the raven, will discard the owl
theory, which began, I think, with Aldrovandus. Like all waders,
the night raven must have been far commoner in days when there were
so many undrained swamps and lakes, and when rivers were allowed to
flow as they pleased.</p>

<p>Posidippus (Jacobs' Appendix, 68) falls into an odd error. He
speaks of a glutton who engulfs his food like a night crow--the
words used being <i>korone</i> (crow), and <i>pannychike</i> (fit
for a night festival): an expression which is used, according to
the dictionaries, of a "greedy night reveller" . Neither the crow
nor the night raven is famous for its appetite. The poet, I take
it, had in mind the cormorant, whose resemblance to a crow or raven
is borne out not only by its English name (cormorant = <i>corvus
marinus</i>: Olaus Magnus has a dissertation <i>de Corvis
Marinis</i>) but also by its scientific one of
<i>phalacrocorax</i>, and whose devouring capacities are proverbial
to this day. It is known as "water-crow" in parts of the English
coast. Aristotle calls it <i>korax kaloumenos</i>, and it is fairly
common in Greece and other parts of the Anthology regions.
<i>Korone</i>, in Homer, was a kind of sea-bird.</p>

<p>The gulls, <i>aithyia</i>, haunt spray-beaten promontories or
rest, carelessly floating, upon the waves; there is also
<i>laros</i>, still called <i>glaros</i>, which, for the sake of
variety, might be rendered as sea-mew or tern; a third kind is
alluded to in that noble epitaph by Leonidas of Tarentum (7, 652)
on the drowned Teleutagoras whose body, he says, is now stranded on
some desert beach and bemoaned by <i>kauexin</i> and
<i>laridessin</i>. The first of these terms is rare; it occurs, for
instance, in a (non-Anthology) fragment of Cal-limachus, where,
from the context, it would seem to signify a kind of diver. To my
way of thinking the word is onomatopoeic, like <i>jynx</i> and
<i>glaux</i> and others: it reproduces pretty accurately the note
of the Mediterranean herring gull, <i>larus cachinnans</i>.</p>

<p>Tha name <i>Aithyia</i> was given to a swift-footed mare
commemorated by Mnasalcas--not very appositely, if one considers
the wayward and flapping flight of this bird (7, 212). I should not
back "Gull" for the Derby--</p>

<pre>
Stranger, of Aithya, whose feet as swift wind sped
Say this the tomb is. Horse none fleeter earth e'er bred;
Like her namesake the gull, oft o'er the long course she
Equalled in tireless sweep the ships upon the sea.
</pre>

<p>The poet, therefore, alluded to her tirelessness rather than to
her speed. Indeed, a friend suggests that the mare's name was
probably connected with the obscure word <i>aitho</i>, either from
her sleek (or flaming sorrel) coat, or from her fierce movements,
and that the homonymous gull was dragged in by way of a pun.</p>

<p>The word <i>brenthos</i> is not found in the Anthology.</p>

<p><i>Kepthos</i> is an unidentified sea-bird mentioned by a good
many writers; like our "gull" or "noddy", it had a reputation for
simplicity. In Didot III (6, 277) it is applied in adjectival form
to doves which allow themselves to be deceived by foxes.</p>

<p>Swans are frequently mentioned, and a good deal of fun is
extracted out of the adventure of Jupiter and Leda--legitimate fun.
Here is what Bassus (6, 125) says--</p>

<pre>
I'll never turn to gold; let some one else become
A bull, or a shore-haunting swan that tuneful sings;
Such tricks I leave to Zeus: two obols is the sum
Corinna I will give, instead of sprouting wings.
</pre>

<p>And this anonymous couplet (9, 108) strikes me as still
better--</p>

<pre>
Said Zeus to Love: "Thy darts from thee shall all be ta'en".
The Winged One: "Thunder once, and swan you are again!"
</pre>

<p>What of those allusions to the song of the swan, which is
described sometimes as loud (by Antipater of Thessalonica),
sometimes as soft (by Antipater of Sidon), and always as beautiful?
For the music of this bird is here treated not as a poetic fable,
but as a bald fact. Many poets--Pindar, Erinna, Alcman, Anacreon,
Virgil--are likened to swans, by reason of their sweet voices; Zeno
the philosopher, is a "learned swan"; Dioscorides mocks the song of
the lark, when compared to that of the swan. "If larks can sing
like swans, and owls like nightingales--" (a simile which occurs
more than once, and shows how poetic imagery tends to become
stereotyped)--what can the poet have meant by this seeming
disregard for truth? I hold no brief for the song of the lark, a
brain-feverish utterance, enjoyable chiefly because of the
associations it conjures up: is that of the swan so immeasurably
superior?</p>

<p>Dioscorides may have meant the same as Meleager and others when
they praised the voice of the halcyon. The halcyon is generally
taken to be the kingfisher, and kingfishers have no voice at all:
just a squeak or whistle. So far as I know, there is only one
species of singing kingfisher, and Meleager is not likely to have
known this bird, since it lives in South America. The blunder is
all the more difficult to explain, because Meleager and the rest of
them were pretty close observers, full of impartial sympathy for
birds and beasts. Perhaps there is no blunder at all. Perhaps we
find ourselves here face to face with a change in literary taste.
Swans and kingfishers--always supposing halcyon to represent the
kingfisher--being birds of beautiful plumage were credited with
voices to match.</p>

<p>Athenaeus has a good deal to say on the subject of the "swan
song", and he quotes Alexander the Myndian as declaring^ that he
has followed many dying swans, but never heard one sing. Alexander
was a naturalist, a remarkable one--not a poet. Lucian also pokes
fun at this swan song. Says his countryman: "We have worked all our
lives on the Eridanus (Po); well, we do see a swan now and again in
the marshes; and a harsh feeble croak their note is; crows or
jackdaws are sirens to it; as for sweet singing such as you tell
of, not a ghost of it". (Translation of E. W. Fowler and F. G.
Fowler).</p>

<p>Doubtless the whooper or whistling swan, cygnus musieus, has a
voice of a kind. It is often lauded in Russian popular poetry, and
Pallas says the bird is kept tame in that country on account of its
song which has a sweet tone like silver bells. My old friend J. E.
Harting wrote that its note is "soft and plaintive, monotonous, but
not disagreeable". Lenz has devoted seventeen pages to the subject
of the swan-song, wherein the reader will find all the old lore and
much of the modern. Kriiper describes <i>cygnus musicus</i> as a
winter visitor. According to Lindermayer it was fairly common on
the Kopais and other lakes, where he found it breeding. Certain it
is that swans of every kind have grown much scarcer in the whole
Mediterranean basin. A flock of them such as Diodorus Siculus
describes alighting on the public fishpond at Girgenti, where they
gave "a most pleasant and delightful prospect to the eye", is never
heard of nowadays. Were they foolish enough to alight in Sicily,
they would not be encouraged to prolong their stay. And who would
believe that they were found in olden days on Lake Avernus?</p>

<p>As regards to the songs of halcyon and swan, we shall perhaps
come round to Prof. D'Arcy Thompson's view that both of them
"veiled, and still hide, some mystical allusion". It is a puzzling
chapter in birdlore.</p>

<p>This is noticeable:---on the one hand, the halcyon described by
Aristotle, whom Pliny copies almost literally, can be nothing but
the common kingfisher, in spite of one or two fanciful details;
were we to judge, on the other, by the ten odd references to this
bird which are contained in the Anthology, we could not but agree
with a recent editor of Theocritus, Kynaston, when he says that the
halcyon is "certainly not the kingfisher": a singular state of
affairs, which would make two or more birds out of a single one.
What do these Anthology references tell us? Nothing in regard to
its size, but only this: it sips running water with its beak; its
note is beautiful and generally plaintive, resembling, if Phalaecus
(13, 27) means the halcyon--the human wail "ai, ai"; there is a
suggestion of a certain aloofness from man and his ways wherein it
differs from favourites like the swallow; it is both a river and a
sea bird; and its colour, according to Mnasalcas--an excellent
poet--is <i>xouthos</i>, a tint which, however rendered in English,
cannot fairly be twisted into the blue of the kingfisher (9, 333).
This word, <i>xouthos</i>, may be allied to <i>xanthos:</i> it
seems to represent every gradation of brown--russet or tawny or dun
or suchlike; the colour of the fawn, in the Anthology, or of the
nightingale, or of a boy's hair. It is also here applied to the
cicada, and, by quite a number of poets--Diodorus Zonas, Antipater
of Sidon, Plato, Nicias and others--to the bee; one might call it a
stock epithet of the bee. Could it be interpreted, therefore, as
flashing or gleaming or -burnished or glossy, it might possibly
pass for a bright bird like the kingfisher, besides adding another
item to various indications which suggest, firstly, that the
ancients had eyes that saw differently from ours--eyes that
sometimes failed to distinguish between lustre and tint--and,
secondly, that being unprovided with the many colour-epithets of
today, they made a single one do the work of several. A debatable
passage in 6, 160, <i>halkyon histon</i>, if it referred to the
swift glint of the shuttle as if passes through the warp, would
have some bearing on this point, besides being an outrageous
metaphor.</p>

<p><i>Xouthos</i> has also been translated as signifying shrill, of
sounds; we pursue an analogous train of thought when we speak of
"screaming colours". Shrill would never fit the bee, but could
reasonably be applied to the cicada. Another (non-Anthology) writer
talks of the swallow as <i>xouthos</i>. Here the word is
inappropriate both as a sound and a colour epithet, unless he was
referring to the swift, in which case "shrill" would be quite in
its place. Perhaps this term was conferred on the swallow because
the nightingale, to which it was bound in a mystical union, is also
<i>xouthos</i>. I see that Dr. W. H. D. Rouse, in his version of
the above-named quatrain by Mnasalcas (<i>An Echo of Greek
Song</i>, p. 50), has rendered <i>xouthos</i> in the sense of
shrill, and that should be good enough for the rest of us--</p>

<pre>
Upon the low brine-sprinkled shore stand we,
Beside the shrine of Cypris of the Sea,
And poplar-shaded spring, whence piping shrill,
The kingfisher draws water with its bill.
</pre>

<p>There is doubtless a difference between shrillness and the
plaintive mournfulness attributed to the halcyon, but it may be
observed that Mediterranean people are apt to mourn in quite a
shrill fashion. Oppian says that the halcyon ends its song by
crying out its former human name--Ceyx! Ceyx!--which sounds rather
shrill than otherwise.</p>

<p>So far these are passably a-vian features, though I can think of
no living fowl which possesses all of them together. A halcyon
built on these lines, if it ever existed, may have died out like
the Great Auk, or like the mysterious Liver from which Liverpool is
said to derive its name. In every case it is reasonable to infer
that, were the bird a creation of fancy from beginning to end, the
poet would have chosen for it some colour other than <i>xouthos</i>
which, in its ordinary interpretation, is neither a startling nor a
lovely one, such as we might expect a fabulous creature to display.
<i>Xouthos</i>, in my opinion, would point to a prototype in
nature, if it pointed to anything definite at all.</p>

<p>Does it? For the word presents peculiarities to which I have not
alluded. It contains, for example, an obscure ingredient suggestive
of motion; and one scholar (Rutherford), confronted by difficulties
such as these, solves them, perhaps rightly, by saying that the
word <i>xouthos</i> long ago lost its precise signification, and
was thereafter used by writers in that sense which seemed to them
most suited to certain classical passages, regardless of whether it
really fitted them or not; while D'Arcy Thompson tells us that the
meaning of <i>xouthos</i> is "quite unknown". This, when one comes
to think of it, is a most desirable state of affairs for the
translator of Greek adjectives, who can make them say what he
pleases. I wish there were many more of the same kind, and a few
dozen verbs into the bargain.</p>

<p>Be <i>xouthos</i> what it may, it is curious to observe that
these modern birdlike attributes have been grafted in the Anthology
upon that earlier and mythical conception of the halcyon with which
we are Jill familiar--or rather, not grafted upon it but only
scored, so to speak, over its surface: to what end? In order,
maybe, to give to that other one, that old and hazy one, an air of
probability, of tangibility, of modernity. If this be correct, we
have in the non-Aristotelean halcyon of the Anthology an
interesting phenomenon. It is a kind of palimpsest; or a composite
fowl into which the tern-element (Tristram) has been made to enter;
a fowl which these poets were determined should be alive, in order
that they might project into it certain fond dreams and aspirations
of their own. They seem to have argued that such a creature, if it
did not exist in nature, ought to be made to exist. Hence its
resuscitation from the shadowy realms of legend; hence those
flesh-and-blood characteristics. And we cannot but agree with the
poets, supposing this to have been their intention. To invest a
dream with life, with actuality, has always been their privilege.
Here is an epitaph (7, 292) on a drowned man by Theon, father of
Hypatia:</p>

<pre>
Lenaeus! Thee perhaps the halcyons cherished keep,
But mute o'er a dank tomb thy mother tears doth weep.
</pre>

<p>In another passage (Didot III, 2, 634) a mother deprived by
death of her children is pictured as lamenting like a "halcyon by
the shore"; see also 9, 262.</p>

<p>Macpherson (p. 152) says that the halcyon was "well known to the
people of Etruria, who figured its graceful form upon their coins".
This is a blunder; he means Eretria, which is not the same thing.
The coin in question is one portraying a bird on the back of a cow,
a bird which Canon Tristram in an article I have not seen
(<i>Ibis</i>, 1893; <i>see</i> Warde Fowler, p. 241) identified
with a tern: Tristram's contention being that the halcyon of the
ancients was not a kingfisher but a tern. Here is a reproduction,
natural size, of the coin in question, which D'Arcy Thompson (p.
31) explains in an astronomical sense. I confess that both its
relative size, and its peculiar pose, remind me strongly of the
tern. The British Museum authorities tell me it is generally taken
to be a swallow or a starling (the latter of which is often seen in
company of cows). What mitigates against Tristram's tern-theory is
that the halcyon has been described by ancient writers--by most of
them; but see, for instance, 9 151--as rare, and of lonely habits.
Both these attributes apply to the kingfisher; neither to the tern.
It should be remembered that the kingfisher, in these regions, is
nearly always seen on or near the sea.</p>

<h2>REPTILES AND BATRACHIANS</h2>

<p>The list of reptiles and batrachians mentioned in the Anthology
is fajrly extensive: fourteen in all, not including the term
<i>herpeton</i> which occurs in a passage (Didot III, 6, 264) about
the "arrow-darting brood of reptiles", that is, poisonous snakes.
There are three kinds of vipers: the <i>echis</i> or
<i>echidna</i>, to begin with. Its venom was considered dangerous
to man. Such is the noisome blood of the Cappadocians, however,
that the <i>echis</i> is described as dying if it bites one of them
(u, 237). Anyte has a lament, charmingly rendered by Dr. Rouse
(<i>An Echo of Greek Song</i>, p. 60), on the death of her Locrian
hound called Maera, which was killed by one of these reptiles--</p>

<pre>
Thou'rt dead then, Locrian Maera, by the brake,
Swiftest of all the belling pack, dear hound!
For there a pitiless and spotted snake
Bit thy light heel, and poisoned all the wound.
</pre>

<p>This animal doubtless corresponds to the <i>Vipera
ammodyles</i>. It is the most poisonous of European snakes and well
known all over these regions. It was called <i>Echidna
ammodyles</i> by Merrem in 1820.</p>

<p>I will delay a moment to advert to a passage in Pausanias, who
tells how a certain Aipytus was killed in Arcadia by a snake which
he calls <i>seps</i>--a snake identified with <i>Vipera
ammodytes</i>--and of which he writes (Frazer's translation): "I
have myself seen this species of snake (<i>ophis</i>). It is like a
very small adder (<i>echis</i>), is ash-coloured and spotted
irregularly: its head is flat, neck thin, belly large, tail short.
Like the crested snake (<i>kerastes</i>), it moves with a sidelong
motion, crab-fashion". This description has been highly praised,
and I admit that, apart from the crab-like movement of which no
snake is capable, it wears an insidious air of scientific
precision. Two points, however, should be noted: the beast in
question is said to be like an echis but smaller--it is therefore
not an <i>echis</i>; secondly, it is contradistinguished from the
crested (<i>keras</i> = a horn) snake; it is therefore not the
horned snake. Only two horned snakes can come under consideration:
the Egyptian two-horned (Solinus calls it four horned)
<i>cerastes</i> which is not found in Europe, and the European
one-horned <i>ammodytes</i>.</p>

<p>The <i>seps</i> of Pausanias is therefore, according to his
definition, neither of these two. Had it been the latter, he could
never have avoided mentioning its characteristic feature, the nasal
projection--quite apart from the fact that in excluding the
<i>echis</i> he has already excluded the ammodytes. What snake,
then, could it be? For the latest authorities concur in saying that
there can be only one other poisonous species in the Peloponnesus,
namely the <i>Vipera eiiphratica</i>. which is sometimes, and
perhaps rightly, identified with <i>V. Redi</i> (<i>V. aspis</i>).
Now this viper, if it exists in Greece, is scarcer and more local
than the horned one. It is not at all "small" , but of
approximately the same length as the other. Lastly, its poison is
so weak that fatal accidents are rare; Redi, who made the classical
experiments with it, declares that no man dies from its bite, six
or seven of these reptiles being requisite to kill him. It follows
that if the description of Pausanias is to be regarded as a
strictly scientific one, it applies to neither of the two poison
snakes at present living in Southern Greece, if indeed there be two
of them; for Bedriaga doubts whether the mainland possesses more
than the single <i>V. ammodytes</i>. I observe that in a passage
later on he gives us the name of the mountain where Aipytus was
bitten by the <i>seps</i>; the place was called Mount Sepia.
Students may draw what inferences they please from this verbal
coincidence. It is worth remembering that the word <i>seps</i>,
which does not occur in the Anthology (the creature was known as
<i>seps</i> because the wounds it made were liable to fester: see
Lucan's <i>Pharsalia</i> for a blood-curdling account of it) might
give rise to some confusion, since later Roman writers applied the
same name to a pretty reptile of the blindworm type which the
Greeks called <i>chaikis</i>--there was also a fish of that
name--from its glittering bronze colour. This is the <i>Seps
chalcides</i> of our naturalists--quite a harmless animal, though
furiously persecuted, both in antiquity and now, on account of its
fabled venom. The innocuous seps happens not to occur in Greece,
where its place is taken by the allied species <i>Ablepharus
pannonicus</i>; the seps in the Athens Museum are, or were, all
wrongly named (J. v. Bedriaga).</p>

<p>So much for Pausanias. I think his <i>seps</i> and the
<i>echis</i> of the Anthology will be found to be one and the same
beast. If he had given it a horn and the correct length, and taken
away that crab-like gait, he would have left us a creditable and
even admirable description of <i>Vipera ammodyles</i>.</p>

<p>Then there is asp, <i>aspis</i>. Its venom was held to be
invariably fatal. This is not the <i>Vipera aspis</i> of modern
zoologists, whose bite is no worse than that of our adder, but in
every probability the Egyptian cobra which then, as now, was often
displayed by snake-charmers and under their influence seemed to
grow more gentle than its savage nature led one to expect. Maecius
may have had this trait in mind (5, 114) when he wrote of a certain
girl--</p>

<pre>
Philistion, the ever hard, who suffered not
A lover if he had not money got,
Seems more amenable than formerly.
No miracle! Her nature changed can't be.
The cruel asp at times may grow more tame,
But when it bites, death follows just the same.
</pre>

<p>Among the sepulchral epigrams of Diogenes Laertius is one on
Demetrius Phalereus (7, 113) who died from the bite of an
asp--Cicero had already told this story; whereas that Alcimenes,
whom I have previously mentioned as scaring away birds from the
crops (7, 172), was bitten to death by the third kind of viper, the
mysterious dipsas or thirst-snake, a reptile which appears for the
second and last time in an anonymous epigram in Jacobs' Appendix
(No. 350). The thirst of its victim is there compared to that of
Tantalus--</p>

<pre>
I deem with like hot poison's pain was Tantalus cursed,
Which in no wise would let him slake his thirst;
And Danaus' daughters in like jar could never pour
Water enough to fill, but there was room for more.
</pre>

<p>Aelian tells us that the dipsas is "smaller than the viper, but
more dangerous. Those who have been bitten suffer from dreadful
thirst, and drink and drink till they burst". I cannot say whether
the attempt has been made to identify the dipsas of the ancients
with any existing species. It would be a difficult task, if one
followed Lucian's wonderful account of the beast --or Lucan's, for
that matter. A snake common in Greece, <i>Tarbophis vivax</i>, used
to be known as <i>Dipsas fallax</i>, and a nocturnal tree-snake of
the East Indies now bears the name (<i>Dipsas dendrophild</i>).
This reminds me that Antiphilus (n, 348) talks of a tree-climbing
asp--an asp "in the branches overhead"--waiting to destroy the
parricide even if he mounts into the highest trees to escape his
fate. There are no poisonous tree-climbing snakes in the Anthology
regions.</p>

<p>For the rest, these terms are used indiscriminately, as they are
in England. So Bianor warns the fowler not to walk with bare feet
among the forests of Egypt on account of the snakes, <i>ophis</i>,
which, in general, signifies the harmless kind. In a poem by
Statylius Flaccus a shipwrecked sailor is described as being
killed, while he lies fast asleep on the Libyan sands, by an
<i>echis</i>: asp would have been a little more appropriate; and
still more appropriate the <i>cerastes</i> viper, a nocturnal and
sand-loving horror, common in North Africa, which may also be
responsible for the death of Cleopatra, since an asp, an Egyptian
cobra, would hardly allow-itself to be hidden in a basket of
flowers. The whole episode may be apocryphal.</p>

<p>We have also two poems (9, 1 and 2) alluding to the belief that
a viper's poison, injected into the udder of a doe or cow, can kill
her suckling offspring; it sounds unlikely, but is doubtless
correct. "A mother, even if suffering in a slight degree from snake
poison, should not attempt to suckle her infant, else it may die in
convulsions. The reason is, that the digestive fluids of an infant
have not the power of chemically changing the venom" (T. W.
Fitzsimons: <i>The Snakes of South Africa</i>).</p>

<p>The bitterness of "vipers' gall" is ascribed to the poems of
Archilochus (7, 71)--</p>

<pre>
This sea-shore tomb is of Archilochus, who made first
Mordant the Muse, and her in vipers' gall immersed,
Bloodstaining thus mild Helicon. Lycambes he
Well knows it, and doth mourn for his hanged daughters three.
Pass light, O wayfarer, lest thou by chance awake
The wasps that on his tomb their habitation make.
</pre>

<p>There are allusions to Philoctetes and his putrefying snake
wound in two or three epigrams which deal with statues and pictures
of that tiresome hero. His wound was caused, according to the
<i>Cyprian Lays</i>, by a <i>hydros</i> or water-snake. Pliny, who
may have heard of, or even seen, certain Eastern water-snakes,
declares the <i>hydros</i> to be the most beautiful and baneful
snake on earth, which, when applied to some of these, is not very
far from the truth. But there are no poisonous water-snakes in the
Anthology regions, although a harmless one, <i>Tropidonotus
viperinus</i>, bears so close a resemblance to the viper that it is
still called <i>oichendra</i> (= <i>echidna:</i> sometimes used as
a generic term for all snakes) and considered to be highly
venomous. Archelaus (Didot III, 3, 52) tells us that serpents are
generated out of the spinal cord of a corpse. It is a pity he has
left us no larger treatise on Natural History, to judge by the few
samples of his learning which are preserved in the Anthology.
Serpents in general, <i>ophis</i>, are named more than once. A
four-coiled one is accused of devouring a nestful of young
swallows--an event which has been known to occur. We find
commemorated the story of Apollo and the Python, of Ammon and
Olympias, Hercules and the Hydra. That of the baby Hercules and his
serpents is told by Gaetulicus of another child as well--Cicero
tells it of the actor Roscius--and may have some foundation in
fact, since these animals are sufficiently confiding and like the
warmth of the human body; it may even explain what John Lithgow
(1632) wrote of the island of Cos: "There is a kind of Serpent said
to be in it, so friendly unto the Inhabitants, that when the men
are sleeping under the shadow of trees, they come cralling, and
will lincke or clasp themselves about their necks and bodies,
without doing any harm, neither when they wake are the beasts
affraid". A water-snake, <i>hydros</i>, is mentioned on one
occasion (in the Cyzicene epigrams). Serpents of gold were worn as
anklets, as they have been from time immemorial in many parts of
the world (6, 207).</p>

<p>The Anthology and other Greek literature is apt to treat the
dragon as synonymous with <i>ophis</i>, which is not surprising,
seeing that both words are derived from stems which mean the same
thing; in an epigram (7, 114) on Heraclides Ponticus, for example,
who told his friends to put a snake, <i>drakon</i>, into his bed
after death, in order to convince the world that his soul had taken
this form; or in Strato's scandalous distich (u, 22) on a youth
called Drako. No authentic dragon is named save in a fragment of
Nestor of Laranda--how a thirsty dragon engulfed the whole Kephisus
brook, to the disgust of its nymphs. Here is another fragment of
his (9, 128), presumably from the same lost poem--</p>

<pre>
Creeping down the dragon drank. The sources were all dried.
To dust the river turned. The brute for drink still cried.
</pre>

<p>Lysander is warned in a Dephic oracle (Didot III, 6, 72; for
another dragon oracle see 6, 253) to beware of the dragon,
treacherous son of earth, coming up from behind (it was the device
on a man's shield). As symbol of evil, the dragon occurs in a
Christian epigram on baptism (<i>ibid</i>. 3, 346); and Posidippus
(<i>ibid</i>. 3, 79) has eight lines on the dragon-stone,
<i>drakontia</i> or <i>drakontitis</i>, which exercised the
ingenuity of many enquiring minds down to the days--and probably
later--of the grave Marsilius Ficinus, who claims to have handled
the authentic article but was taken to task in 1636 by Boetius de
Boot or his editor Toll for confusing it with the <i>lapis
slellaris</i>. I shall resist the temptation of quoting from
Albertus Magnus or any of them.</p>

<p>Posidippus may be the earliest writer to mention this
much-discussed product of nature. As his lines are very forced and
altogether too tough for me, my friend Dr. Rouse has kindly stepped
into the breach--</p>

<p>Not a river roaring upon its banks once held this stone, but the
bearded head of a dragon. See it speckled with white! but the
chariot graven on it was engraved by the eye of a lynx, like
mimicry of man's handiwork: for when impressed, the engraving can
be seen, but over the flat projection you could not see it (i. e.
there must be a projection with a flat top). Truly it is a great
miracle of labour, how the lapidary did not hurt his straining
eyes.</p>

<p>One of the problems arising out of this epigram is: how could a
lynx-eye carve? Enough of Posidippus.</p>

<p>The pottery of the island of Skyros is embellished by a graceful
dragon-design--white figures on red ground. One would like to know
its origin.</p>

<p>The crocodile is mentioned, though its hypocritical tears, an
ancient conceit, are not alluded to. It is credited with a sense of
justice (n, 348). Archelaus, who lived in Egypt, describes in one
of his epigrams (Didot III, 3, 50) the fabulous metamorphosis, that
a dead crocodile, dissolving away, changes itself into
scorpions--</p>

<pre>
Life-giving Nature, which works over everything,
From out dead crocodiles live scorpions doth bring.
</pre>

<p>The tortoise is not commemorated in a manner worthy of so
legendary a beast. All that we find is a reference to the lyre--the
shell of a tortoise, and, in a couplet by Lucian (u, 436), to a
flying tortoise, a phenomenon which is never seen.</p>

<p><i>Poikilos</i>, many-hued or changeful, is the epithet applied
to the chameleon in an oracle (Didot III, 6, 274) about Andronicus
Comnenus, "livid man, fierce of temper, hateful, grey-haired,
variable chameleon", which ends by saying that whoso bears the
sword shall not escape the sword. It is the only passage in which
this interesting beast is named, though Andronicus comes in for
more hard words in the next oracle, and Joannes, a little earlier,
is to be "food for horrid ravens". The chameleon occurs on European
soil nowhere save in South Spain, which it reached, presumably, in
company with the Gibraltar apes. It has been said to exist both in
Greece and in Sicily, but these reports are based on error.</p>

<p>Strange, that there should be no word about the lizard--not
until the age of Hadrian, when it is introduced (11, 21; and 12, 3
and 207) in a metaphorical and equivocal, not to say improper,
sense. It was of course observed and described and sometimes used
in the concoction of drugs, and pictured on gems, but one or two
indications lead me to believe that this animal was less common
than it is to-day. Aristotle has only one name for all the
lizard-species, some of which differ vastly from others. And there
are at present certain Mediterranean regions, such as Asia Minor,
where reptiles in general are surprisingly scarce--many species,
but few individuals--owing to the abundance of birds which feed on
them, chiefly storks, but also the crow tribe and kestrels and
other hawks.</p>

<p>The same applies in a lesser sense to Greece. You will see more
lizards round Naples in a week than round Athens in a year, and
certainly not from lack of food in the shape of flies etc.; those
you do see are far shyer. (We have an exception--the emerald
lizard, which in Greece has been known to attain the enormous
length of sixty-three centimetres. This creature, more often heard
than seen, is secure from attacks, because it seldom quits the
precincts of its fixed abode, its fortress--the tangled roots of
some tree or a thorny shrub inaccessible to birds of any kind, into
which it dashes with noisy rustle on the approach of an enemy. It
can also put up a good fight when cornered).</p>

<p>The abundance of lizards in Italy, when compared to Greece, is
explained by the fact that the lizard-eating birds above named are
not allowed to survive among Italians--merciless enemies, as they
are, of all living beauty other than human.</p>

<p>It is probable, I think certain, that birds of this kind used to
be more frequent in the Apennine peninsula, before its inhabitants
had grown as brutal as they now are towards the animal creation.
The inference is obvious: lizards and other reptiles must then have
been scarcer, as scarce as they are in Asia Minor to-day. Pliny
notes that the Italian countrymen regulated certain agricultural
operations according to the departure of the storks in autumn (even
as Hesiod gives the "voice of the crane, crying year after year
from the clouds above" as the signal for ploughing to begin), which
implies that they bred numerously in that country. Warde Fowler (p.
231) has some further confirmatory evidence on this head. Owing to
persecution, there is not a single resident stork in Italy at this
moment; hence, no doubt, the present relative abundance of lizards.
Such birds do not seem to have been persecuted in any manner during
the long stretch of time covered by the Greek Anthology, nor in any
of its countries (Romans after the days of Horace took to eating
young storks); hence, I take it, the former relative scarcity of
lizards. This is one of several cases in which a certain shifting
in the economy of nature can be presumed to have taken place.</p>

<p>In Greece proper the stork has grown much rarer of late; it used
to nest both on the Akropolis and on the columns of the Jupiter
temple. Tristram writes: "It has also been nearly extirpated in
Greece, where the Christians have not the reverence for it which is
maintained by the Turks. Before the war of Independence it was as
common in Greece as in the neighbouring- countries" . According- to
Aristotle storks were protected by law in Thessaly, on account of
their reptile-destroying propensities (Solinus copies this
information, as he does a good many other things). In
Imhoof-Blumer--plate XXII--can be seen reproductions of gems
portraying a stork with a lizard in its beak, a crane with a
lizard, another stork with a snake, and a heron attacking a snake.
Protestants alone, among Christians, now cherish the stork, and we
had better not labour this point, since it has been driven likewise
out of England. Whoso does wilful bodily injury to a stork is
liable to a fine in Germany; to take young storks out of their nest
is "verboten". As to the kestrels, I admit that it is invidious to
say unkind things about them. Yet a town like Argos, which is
infested with these elegant birds, cannot derive as much benefit
from them as it would from the swallows, for kestrels devour the
useful lizards, if any of them are left, whereas swallows would
content themselves with the worse than useless mosquito. The lesser
kestrel, equally abundant in Argos, is said to eat nothing but
insects: "sometimes small lizards", says Lindermayer.</p>

<p>In this connexion a certain work of art should not be
overlooked: the Apollo Sauroctonus, the Lizard-Slayer, known to
most people as a graceful statue in Rome and in the Louvre, which
differs, they say, from the earlier and harsher Praxitelean
conception of the scene. Apollo, as Lord and Destroyer of vermin
like locusts or field mice, is supposed to have acted in the same
capacity towards another summer scourge--lizards. (Hercules,
Inspector-General of Nuisances, was figured on coins and statues of
Thasos with a lizard). Such is the conventional explanation of this
piece; and it does not strike me as convincing. The Louvre statue
certainly admits af another interpretation; a German naturalist,
Th. Eimer, offers a suggestive one in his book on the wall
lizard.</p>

<p>There is also to be noted that a spotted lizard called
<i>galeotes</i> was useful for divination, and thus came to be
associated with Apollo. I am not sure whether this animal has been
identified. It is said to correspond to the Greek
<i>askalabotes</i> and the Latin <i>stellio</i>. The <i>Slellio
vulgaris</i> of modern science, though speckled, does not occur in
continental Greece. It may, and I think must, be one of the geckos,
preferably the <i>hemidactylus</i> (called <i>gekko ascalabotes</i>
by Merrem in 1820), which is found in houses all over South
Europe--a spectral little beast that has a voice of its own,
maculated like a corpse, fond of dark places, with translucent
flesh and glassy eyes, and altogether so strange of aspect as to be
a fit object for magical practices: as can be seen from this oracle
of Hecate (Didot III, 6, 198): "Build a pure wooden image; make the
body of wild rue, and adorn it with live, small, house-dwelling
<i>skalabotais</i> (a rare form of the word); make a pounded
mixture of myrrh, storax and frankincense together with those
animals, and gathered when the moon is waxing; and yourself pray
over it the following prayer, etc.". The epithet "house-dwelling"
shows that in this case the animal was a gecko and not a modern
<i>stellio</i>, which, by the way, is anything but "small". It is
one of many cases of science taking over an ancient word
(<i>stellio</i>) and applying it to a beast for which the ancients
did not intend it.</p>

<p>Here lie the germs of another possible explanation of Apollo
Sauroctonus.</p>

<p>If, on the other hand, the conventional one be correct, it would
prove that lizards were then common enough to be regarded as a
plague, and this would invalidate my theory as to their relative
scarcity. My theory might go by the board, if the conventional one
did not prove something else as well--something which is more
important and more difficult to prove, namely, that these men were
guilty of a deplorable lack of observation when they mistook for a
pest the lizard, whose insect-destroying utility is manifest to the
eyes of a child.</p>

<p>There we may leave the matter, for little is to be learnt from
the ancients; their accounts of this statue present such
discrepancies as to make it questionable whether the writers could
be referring to one and the same work of art. Says Pliny:
"Praxiteles wrought in metal a youthful Apollo lying in wait with
an arrow for a creeping lizard near at hand, which they call
Sauroctonus". Martial's epigram on the <i>Sauroctonus of Corinthian
Metal</i> contains no hint of a divine personality engaged nor of
the beast's (therefore) inevitable destruction; nor yet of an
arrow; the lines might have been addressed to any lad of the
countryside--</p>

<pre>
Ad te reptanti, puer insidiose, lacertae
Parce; cupit <i>digitis</i> ilia perire tuis.
</pre>

<p>The toad is mentioned but once, in an anonymous distich (Jacobs'
Appendix, 132) which bids us avoid the asp, the toad--</p>

<pre>
Of asps, toads, snakes, Laodiceans be shy,
Mad dogs; but most from Laodiceans fly!
</pre>

<p>Little lore seems to have gathered about it in those days,
although Apuleius perpetrates some rich nonsense anent its uses to
the farmer, and Pliny recommends the chopped-up fragments of a
river-crab as an antidote to its poison. It was also used in the
manufacture of charms. Phile, who drew a good deal from Aelian and
deserves a mellow English translation, has a poem on the toad, and
another on the lizard.</p>

<p>Those friendly lines (4, 292) addressed by Agathias to Paulus
Silentiarius, whose reply is very much to the point, contain the
only discoverable reference to <i>ololygon</i>, the tree-frog.
Cicero, in a youthful performance, started a little confusion by
translating the "solitary and matutinal ololygon" of Aratus
(<i>Phaeno-mena</i>, 948) as <i>acredula</i>, an unknown kind of
bird, whose name was picked up by Koch in 1816 and given to the
long-tailed titmouse, which has since retained it. Others--for
reasons of poetic propriety, I suppose--render <i>ololygon</i> as
thrush or turtle-dove. It is the latter in Butler's flowing version
of this poem by Agathias, which I will take the liberty to
transcribe, while noting that the "dear gazelle" is in reality a
"sweet heifer", a term of affection not so consonant to English
taste, though it has a pleasantly Biblical aroma--</p>

<pre>
The grass is green, buds on the bushes throng,
  The glory of the leaf is on the wood:
Birds in the shady cypress ply their song,
  Tending the dewy nestlings of their brood:
The finches twitter shrill: the <i>turtle dove</i>
  Coos from the shelter of his leafy choir.
Yet what avail these charms? For I would love
  To hear your voice far more than Delos' lyre.
Two loves there are upon me. Would I saw
  You once again, you and my dear gazelle
Sad thoughts of whom devour me; but the law
  Constrains me far from my two loves to dwell.
</pre>

<p>The same word <i>ololygon</i> has given trouble to translators
of the famous seventh idyll of Theocritus (line 139). Calverley
renders it as "tree-frog", Way as "dwarf owl" and Andrew Lang as
"little owl"--the two latter following, no doubt, the London
Theocritus of 1829 (Vol. I. p. 376). A recent editor of that poet,
Kynaston, likewise remarks that "it is difficult to imagine that a
tree-frog can be meant by <i>ololygon</i>". Difficult to imagine,
perhaps; especially for Englishmen unfamiliar with its music or for
those who would draw hasty conclusions from the family likeness
between <i>ololygon</i> and <i>ulula</i> (cf. the English "owl")
and who know that the Scops owl often cries by day. The mention of
a humble but melodious batrachian adds, I should say, an ingenuous
and naturalistic touch to Agathias' letter.</p>

<p>It is clear, at all events, that in this letter to his friend he
meant by <i>ololygon</i> whatever Theocritus meant in that idyll,
be it dove or owl or frog. For, like all sensible people, he had
just been reading it; among other things, he borrowed there from
also the bird <i>akanthis</i> of which I have already spoken, and
which is translated in the previous rendering as "finches".</p>

<p>Aristotle employs the substantive <i>ololygon</i> specifically
to denote the croaking of frogs; he goes on to tell us how the
noise is produced. Its root applies to cries of several kinds; so
in Didot III (2, 234) the <i>ololygaia nykteris</i> cannot mean a
bat, but the screeching or hooting owl. Now if <i>nykteris</i>
signifies anything that flies by night, bat or owl, then
<i>ololygon</i>, in a secondary and generic sense, might be
interpreted to stand for anything that cries loudly or
persistently, frog or bird or other creature. I have not, however,
come across it in a passage where "tree-frog" would be obviously
inappropriate, and the word, a rare one, has no place in Thompson's
<i>Glossary of Greek Birds</i>.</p>

<p>Its verb is of wider interest as hinting at the difference which
existed between the ears of the ancients and ours. It was used for
that human joy-cry which may have resembled the "lullilooing" of
Arab women--a cheery sound; it denoted also the owl's hoot, which
we consider anything but cheery. We should not think of employing
the same term for both these cries; the Greeks did so. On the other
hand, moderns detect a similarity between the note of the frog and
that of the raven; \ve talk of the croaking of both. No Greek, I
fancy, would have used the verb <i>ololyzo</i> in connexion with
the raven, yet it was Aristotle's term for the croaking of
frogs.</p>

<p>Two poems deal with the common frog--<i>Rana ridibunda</i>, in
all probability. One of them, attributed to Plato, speaks of a
bronze model of a frog set up as a dedicatory offering at some
fountain by a thirsty traveller, whom the croaking of this
"rain-lover and devotee of the Nymphs" had led to the water's edge
(6, 43): the last couplet being considered an interpolation
(Didot)--</p>

<pre>
One who his raging thirst quenched in the heat,
Moulded in bronze and set this offering here
To the Nymphs' slave, that Muse of damp retreat,
The frog, lover of rain and fountains clear.
His strayed steps to the pool had turned, when so
Timely uprose its song from the dank (lit: <i>sunk</i>) ground;
(Nor did the traveller that guiding voice forego
Till he the sweet and longed-for water found).
</pre>

<p>The other, by Antigonus the Carystian (9, 406), commemorates the
figure of a frog which was carved on the inside of a <i>bowl</i>
for mixing wine and water; of a frog, therefore, a natural lover of
the Nymphs, of water, who became a wine-lover, a votary of Lyaius,
<i>too late in life</i>. It gives the poet an occasion for hinting
that he also writes better verses now that he has taken to Bacchus,
and can "rage" with a less genteel madness.</p>

<p>The idea of this carved frog recalls those English beer-mugs of
the eighteenth or early nineteenth century which likewise had a
frog adhering to the inside of the vessel, near the bottom, to the
surprise of the drinker when he emptied his mug. A note to a French
edition of the Anthology (Hachette, 1863) talks here of a
"grenouille tombe dans un cratere ou il y avait de 1'eau et du vin
praepares", as though it were a question of a live frog, and
proceeds to suggest that this epigram may have been in Gray's mind
when he wrote of the cat which was drowned in a basin of goldfish.
Gray knew his Anthology too well to take a hint where no hint is
given. I detect no suggestion of a live frog. Here is the close
Latin rendering of the first two lines:</p>

<pre>
<i>Argenteus fons me, jam non longum clamentem
ranam, vinariis habuit sub guttis.</i>
</pre>

<p>And here is the looser one in verse by Grotius:</p>

<pre>
Factus ab argento saliens, sina more tacentem,
Me ranam genito vitibus imbre rigat.
</pre>

<p>The croaking of frogs, that classical symphony, was heard also
in the swamps of the Underworld (Didot III, 3, 84). <a name="ch-5"

<h2>SEA-BEASTS</h2>

<p>Small, relatively small, is the list of fishes and sea-beasts
enumerated in the Anthology. Of fishes proper, if I have counted
rightly, twenty-two are mentioned by their names, which are the
following: <i>skombros, glaukiskos, phykis, maine, melanouros,
mormyros, kichle, spares, ellops, smaris, chalkis, thrissa, trigle,
thynnos, skaros, perke, kallichthys, ioulis, boax, gongros</i> and
<i>kyon halos</i> (or <i>enalios</i>). There is also <i>ketos</i>
which generally means a whale or seal, but in its Anthology context
can only be a shark. Not all of these are identifiable. The
ancients were sufficiently vague, and modern scientists, adopting
the old Greek names into their nomenclature and applying them to
any species which took their fancy, made confusion worse
confounded.</p>

<p>Were it not for men like Aristotle, what should our
ichthyologists do? They would hardly be able to identify a single
one of them. Take, for instance, the <i>skaros</i>, the oft-named
<i>shares</i>, declared by Pliny to be the most savoury of all of
them, and held to be the modern <i>Scarus creticus</i>, the parrot
wrasse. Here are some of the data which they, our zoologists, would
have to face if Aristotle were non-existent: the <i>skaros</i> is
carnivorous; it is a vegetable feeder; it chews the cud like a
sheep; it is the only fish which has a voice (the above-named
<i>boax</i>, a fish sacred to Hermes, was so called from its cry);
it is the only fish which never sleeps; it sleeps at night; it
pulls its companions out of nets and bites through the line which
holds them fast; it is difficult to catch; it is caught with a
piece of sea-weed, etc. etc. What would they make of this
beast?</p>

<p>Monsieur M. D. Bikelas has gone to much trouble in this matter,
and gives the scientific equivalents of about half the fishes
mentioned in the Anthology. We can rely on those whose names (some
are lost in modern Greek) have elsewhere remained unchanged to this
day. Certain are therefore the following: <i>perke</i>, the perch;
<i>gongros</i>, the conger; <i>trigle</i> with the delightful
epithet <i>anthemoessa</i>, the Italian "triglia" or red mullet;
<i>thynnos</i>, the tunny--then caught, as today, by means of a
look-out man whose business it was to signal the approach of a
shoal, which is driven into a complicated system of nets resembling
a house with its different chambers (Oppian has left us a
description of this) whence the struggling masses are dragged into
shallow water and killed; <i>skombros</i>, the mackerel or perhaps
the allied <i>Trachurus trachurus</i> (Casteln.), known as
<i>skoumpri</i> both by modern Greeks and Turks, the latter of whom
stuff it with raisins and pine nuts and suchlike, which greatly
improve such flavour' as its ligneous flesh may possess, though the
stuffing always remains the best part of the fish (Apicius gives a
recipe for stuffed mackerel of which this may be the descendant:
Mrs. Beeton's method of stuffing mackerel with veal forcemeat does
not, <i>a priori</i>, appeal to me).</p>

<p><i>Melanouros</i> is the <i>Oblata mdanura</i>, common in the
Mediterranean; <i>mormyros</i> the modern Greek
mour-mourion.themormillo of the Italians (<i>Pagellus
mormyrus</i>); smarts the maridaor smarida of to-day (<i>Smarts
vulgaris</i>); <i>maine</i> or <i>mainis</i>, a sprat; <i>kuon
halos</i> a shark of one kind or another.</p>

<p><i>Kallichthys</i>, according to Lenz (p. 515) might be the
sterlet. The word means beauty-fish--a term which I, at least,
would not think of applying to the sterlet. Some identify the
<i>kallichthys</i> with the ancient <i>anthias</i> or
<i>ellops</i>, the first of which is not mentioned in the
Anthology. In Didot III, (5, 17) this beauty-fish in its Latin form
is <i>anthias</i>, whose name also hints at pretty coloration; but
Athenaeus says that Dorion, in his treatise on fish, declares the
two to be different from each other. <i>Kallichthys</i> does not
occur in Aristotle, and his <i>anthias</i> and <i>ellops</i> are
beyond identification; he speaks of a certain aulopias-fish (?
ellops-fish) "which some call anthias". The <i>ellops</i> is barely
named in an enigma (Didot III, 7, 28) that plays upon its
speechlessness; <i>ellops</i> meaning dumb. Gratius Faliscus, in
his <i>Halieutica</i>, sings of "et pre-tiosus Helops, nostris
incognitus undis" (line 120). This, so far as it goes, would do for
the sterlet, since it can hardly be called a Mediterranean fish and
is still, and rightly, considered to be "precious".</p>

<p>I suspect <i>kichle</i>, the sea-thrush--Doric
<i>kichela</i>--may have survived in the South Italian "cicella" ,
one of the brown-tinted <i>ophidiidae</i>, though Aubert and Wimmer
suggest a species of <i>labrus</i>, and others render it by wrasse.
I shall touch upon <i>ioulis</i> and <i>phykis</i> later.</p>

<p>Twenty-two is a comparatively small list, to be sure, and not
what we might have expected of a maritime and ichthyophagous
people. Maybe the tribe of fishes does not lend itself readily to
the purposes of the Anthology. It would be difficult to write a
lament on the death of a favourite herring, or to compose a
love-poem which should include an appropriate reference to fried
soles. Other ancient sources amply atone for this deficiency. To
read them, one would think that fish were the only things worth
eating; a noteworthy change since the days of Homer whose heroes,
if I remember rightly, ate them only out of necessity. (Homer
mentions both fishing boats and various methods of catching fish).
The unbelievable trouble and expense to which the Romans went with
their <i>piscinae</i> rouses old Varro to a pitch of humorous
indignation.</p>

<p>Yet Hedylus wrote one or two good epigrams about fish. "Have a
good time, Clio; we'll wink at it, and, if you like, eat everything
yourself; the whole conger costs only a drachma..." or the next
one: "This kallichthys is done to perfection. Now quick! Bolt the
door, for fear Agis should drop in..." (Didot III, 5, 16 and 17).
Judging by his poems, he seems to have been something of a
man-about-town, not only in the matter of turbots, and to have paid
for his excesses, if a certain couplet of his in the Anthology
applies to himself. "The daughter of limb-loosening Bacchus and
limb-loosening Venus is limb-loosening Gouts. That was 300 B. C.
How near they were to us, these men...</p>

<p>At the same time, one or the other of these poets might have
found occasion to tell us something about conspicuous Mediterranean
sea-creatures like whale, sea-turtle, torpedo, saw-fish, flying
fish, the much-bepraised lamprey, or the wonder of the echineis or
remora, with its fabled power of arresting the motion of ships.
There is not a word of any kind of freshwater fish save in Bianor
(7, 388), and in an epigram of Nicarchus (11, 405) making fun of a
certain Nicon who has a wonderful nose for wine, though he cannot
quickly pronounce upon its flavour, since it takes three long hours
for the bouquet to mount up his proboscis--a nose, in short, of
such formidable dimensions that when crossing a river he often
catches little fish with it. Leonidas of Alexandria has another
quatrain (n, 199) on a fish-catching nose--</p>

<pre>
Hook-nosed Sosiptolis need never buy his fish;
The sea gives him good fare, according to his wish;
Bringing no line or rod, with hook fixed to his nose,
He pulls out everything that therein swimming goes.
</pre>

<p>Nor is there mention of sea-serpents or those many other
monsters of the deep--Gaetulicus talks of "sea-beasts" devouring a
drowned man (7, 275)--wherewith the water was peopled in our own
mediaeval, and later, days. That is not hard to understand. For
though Hellenic sea-deities are. remarkable, unique, for the
radiant splendour of their conception, yet the ancients themselves,
their creators, had a knack of keeping the sea, as such, in its
proper place. They were indifferent to its mysteries. The poets of
the Anthology, a dozen of whom represent the flowering of the
finest civilization yet known on earth, had little of our sense of
the wonder or beauty of this useless and monotonous mass of water.
It was never "dear" to them save as a symbol of their sea-girt home
(7, 256). The average of ail the epithets applied to it may be
summed up in the word <i>perfidious</i>, Theirs was not Swinburne's
point of view, but that of the British sailor of to day, who
regards it solely in its relation to mankind; that is to say,
either as a means of livelihood or as a menace to life--if we
except some sporadic references in a choice spirit like Meleager,
who has a place apart from the rest of them and may well compare
the blue, or bright, eyes of Asclepias to the glad summer calm of
Ocean, tempting the mariner to set forth on his love-voyage; or
those memorable lines by Antiphilus (9, 546) which exhale such a
breezy love of sea-faring that one marvels how sentiments like
these came to find themselves in the Greek Anthology--</p>

<pre>
On a ship's poop I'd like to lie, if I could have my way,
With over it the weather-cloths, thumped loudly by the spray;
A sputtering fire between two stones, edging it like a mound,
A pot perched on them, boiling brisk, with bubbling empty sound;

An unwashed cabin-boy to serve; for table I would make
Use of some handy plank; maybe a game of give-and-take
With sailors gossiping around...Lately this chanced to me,
Who always find myself at home in simple company.
</pre>

<p>Leonidas of Tarentum has left us two interesting epitaphs
concerning fish. The first of them (7, 504) deals with a certain
Parmis who had not his like among fishermen and who, while biting
to death a ioulis-fish, allows it to slip down his throat and is
choked. This creature is generally taken to be one of the modern
<i>iulis</i> race, the most brilliantly tinted of all of them: no
wonder Germans call it "Junker-fisch" or rainbow-fish, and North
Italians "donzella" , and Neapolitans by a name which I should
blush to print--</p>

<pre>
Fisher like Parmis, Callignotus' son,
For wrasse or scarus was there few or none,
Or greedy perch, or any fish that moves
On rocky bottoms or in creviced grooves.
But he, one day's first catch, drew from the sea
His bane, when a rock-haunting ioulis he
Biting to kill, let slip his fingers through,
And wriggling down his narrow throat it flew.
Then near where he his line, rod, hooks had cast,
Rolling in agony he breathed his last,
And, as the Fates had spun it, found his doom.
Gripo, the fisher, built for him this tomb.
</pre>

<p>About four hundred years later Apollonides (7, 702) tells the
same story of another man and another kind of fish, the
<i>phykis</i>. He calls this fish red; others call it spotted;
Aristotle says it is many-coloured in spring and white the rest of
the year. The only modern <i>phycis</i> I know, <i>P.
blennoides</i>, is silvery grey. The name (<i>phykon</i>, sea-weed)
was taken from the Greek by Cuvier. Pliny, copying Aristotle,
wrongly says that the <i>phykis</i> is the only fish that builds a
nest. Lenz (p. 492) therefore inclines to identify it with a
species of <i>gobius</i> which does build nests; Aubert and Wimmer,
hesitatingly, with one of the sticklebacks which also build nests;
Tristram translates it as hake. Hedylus names the <i>phykis</i> as
being commended by an epicure (Didot III, 5, 18). This would hardly
be the case with sticklebacks or even hakes.</p>

<p>Our fishermen generally avoid the risk of being choked in this
fashion, because they allow the beasts to die of their own accord.
Yet the Didot edition of the Anthology contains this note (to 7,
504) about an even stranger case in England: "Pari casu periit, sub
finem Augusti mensis a. 1836, Errisii in Anglia piscator. Quum
jaceret exanimis juxta arundines et situlam piscium plenam, qui
cadaver inspexerunt ut mortis quae fuisset causa cognoscerent,
repererunt pharyngi hominis inhaerentem pisciculum, quem opinati
sunt propius piscatum considerantis in os insiluisse ac faucium
aditum penitus obturasse".</p>

<p>The other of these epitaphs by Leonidas (7, 506) recounts the
sad end of Tharsys the diver, who is "buried both on land and in
the sea". He has descended into the depths of the Ionian to loosen
an anchor, and is already rising to the surface again and holding
out one hand to grasp his companions in the boat, when a terrible
sea-monster--a "ketos", a shark rather than whale or seal--snaps
him clean in two, and gulps down his lower half as far as the
navel. The sailors, bringing to land the other half, a chill
burden, bury it on the beach, and, adds the good Leonidas,
"nevermore returned I to my country".</p>

<p>There are three more shark-poems, variants of each other, one
anonymous (9, 371) and two by Ger-manicus Caesar (9, 17 and 18),
which tell how a hare, escaping from the jaws of a land-dog, makes
for the sea (Xenophon already noticed that pursued hares will cross
a river, as I have seen rabbits do)--makes for the sea, only to
find itself in those of a sea-dog, a shark; a most improbable state
of affairs, although one of the authors has a neat point when he
says that, earth and water being hostile to hares, the sky alone
still seems to be open to them; there, too, lurks a dog (Sirius)
among the stars.</p>

<p>We have still another shark story, equally absurd, with a moral
attached to it (9, 269).</p>

<p>Then, as now, fishes were devourers of drowned men; so in three
realistic epigrams by Hegesippus, Tullius Laureas, and Philippus
(7, 276, 294 and 383). And the implements of this venerable calling
have not greatly changed. There are pliant cane rods and lines of
horse hair, and spears and tridents and fish-traps and curved
hooks, and nets weighted with lead, nets for drawing and for
casting, and creels of wicker, and floats. From poems by Satyrius
and others it is clear that they practised the lucrative method of
fishing by night, when the flare of pine torches which they lighted
with flints--the "friend of mariners ", the "fire-producing stone
of night-rowers" (acetylene lamps are now coming into
fashion)--draws the inquisitive creatures to the surface. From one
poem (9, 299) we learn that the seine was hauled ashore by means of
ropes attached to oxen, an operation which is generally performed
by a company of men and boys. The cattle are pictured as grumbling
at their unaccustomed task.</p>

<p>An interesting expression occurs in the above-named verses by
Satyrius (6, 11). He mentions the "mullet-catching tunic" of
Kleitor, who fished by night. This might be either an additional
garment worn as a safe-guard against the damp, or, were it not
doing violence to a respectable word, a kind of overall such as is
still worn to protect the ordinary clothing from the torch which,
being fixed in the bow, sends its black and greasy fumes over the
inmates of the boat. I daresay, however, that the fisher of those
days went naked but for a loin-cloth; he would don a tunic only at
night, and so become what was known as a <i>monochiton</i>.</p>

<p>And then, as now, the profession claimed its victims.
Apollonides (7, 693) tells of a heap of stones, raised by his
fellows, whereunder lies the body of sea-angling Glenis, who was
swept off his rock and engulfed by the bitter swirl of a wave.
Strange, too, is the death of fisherman Pyrrhus (7, 637). He was
struck by lightning out at sea, and his boat drifted home of its
own accord, bearing the news of his fate by sulphur and murky
flame. Yet sometimes their end was peaceful. Andrew Lang's version
of the poem on an old fisherman (7, 295) has the rare merit of
possessing no more lines than the original by Leonidas--</p>

<pre>
Theris the old, the waves that harvested
More keen than birds that labour in the sea,
With spear and net, by shore and rocky bed,
Not with the well-manned galley laboured he;
Him not the star of storms, rior sudden sweep
Of wind with all his years hath smitten and bent,
But in his hut of reeds he fell asleep,
As fades a lamp when all the oil is spent:
This tomb nor wife nor children raised, but we
His fellow-toilers, fishers of the sea.
</pre>

<p>Then too, as not now, appropriate offerings were made by the
fisher-folk to render favourable their protecting divinities, as in
6, 33; or 6, 105--</p>

<pre>
This grilled red mullet I, fisher Menis, offering make,
O Artemis of the Creeks, to thee; also this hake,
And this wine-cup brimful, wherein there crumbled lies
A bit of crusty bread. A meagre sacrifice!
Grant in return my nets the fish may never shun,
For all the nets are in thy keeping, Blessed One.
</pre>

<p>An anonymous author in the Planudean Appendix (311) contributes
a couplet in praise of Oppian's Halieutics, wherein the reader of
to-day will find as much ancient fish-lore as is good for him.
There are three more lines on this book in Didot III, (3, 141).</p>

<p>Of those sauces and pickles for fish so beloved of antiquity
there is no mention save in two enigmas (14, 23 and 36), and who
would guess that the following means a fish served up in a sauce
consisting of the blood of other fish? "Bitter is my life, my death
is sweet, and both are water. I die pierced by bloodless spears.
But if any one will cover me, dead, in a living tomb, I am first
drenched in the blood of kinsmen". This strange and excellent
recipe survives to-day in the islands where, if the fishermen are
in a good humour and have made a good catch, they will cook a
number of common fish together, squeeze the juice out of their
bodies and then boil you, in this liquid, a red mullet.</p>

<p>Philodemus (n, 35) speaks of <i>tarichos</i>, smoked or dried or
salted fish, as an article of diet. The word still means to dry or
to embalm, and fish are still treated in this manner at Missolonghi
and other places. You can buy as much as you please in the Athens
market. It is a cheap and nasty product, which sounds a little more
appetizing when translated as caviare in Philodemus' noteworthy
menu of what is called, I believe, a Dutch picnic--</p>

<pre>
A kail Artemidorus gives, Aristarchus caviare,
Philodemus a small liver, while little onions are
The scot of Athenagoras; Apollophanes he may
Two pounds of pork bring, though three remain from yesterday.
Buy garlands, sandals and an egg, some perfume and, what's more,
Say that I want them all to be here punctually at four.
</pre>

<p>Fine long names these epicures have; and their accents must be
the joy of a versifying translator.</p>

<p>Wishing to learn more of <i>tarichos</i> and its possible
connexion with <i>avgotaraho</i>, an expression which modern Greeks
jokingly apply to two inseparable companions, I wrote to Mr. John
Mavrogordato, a much-tried friend whose learning is only equalled
by his affability. The reply will interest those who are curious in
such matters:</p>

<p>"As far as I know there is no modern Greek word <i>taraho</i>
meaning caviare or anything like it. The Greek for caviare is
<i>chaviari</i>, and the word for dried or salted stuff (salume) is
<i>tarihos</i>, which is not modern but ancient Greek. I doubt
whether you would ever hear <i>tarihos</i> in genuine modern Greek;
they would probably use some word like <i>mpakala</i>
(baccala).</p>

<p>But <i>avgotaraho</i> is a very well known delicacy, not
caviare, but the salted and dried roe of grey mullet or tunny or
some other fish. Coated in wax, it looks rather like a dark brown
banana, but much thinner, and when you have peeled off the wax, you
cut the roe in very thin slices--it is about as hard as a plug of
tobacco--and it has a delicious flavour of salt and smoke and
beeswax. This is known as botargo. I had always believed that this
word was a corruption of <i>avgotaraho</i>; the Oxford Dictionary,
however, gives a plausible derivation from the Coptic
<i>outarakhon</i>.</p>

<p>In any case <i>avgotarahon</i> obviously means pickled
eggs--i.e. salted roe, and it shows that the correct modern form of
the ancient <i>tarihos</i> would be <i>taraho</i>, if it were found
uncompounded, but it isn't. This is confirmed by Ducange, who
gives:</p>

<p>Augo tariho, Ova piscis condita, in Turcogr. Crusii, apud
Hieron. Germanum, augotarahon (leg. tarihon) exponitur, ovum
piscis. Italis Botarga.</p>

<p>This shows of course that his text read quite correctly the then
as now <i>avgotaraho</i>, and that he wanted to correct it to the
classical <i>tariho</i>, besides making it into two words.</p>

<p>Brigheriti's dictionary, by the way, gives <i>augotarahon</i>:
bottarga.</p>

<p>So much for the ordinary meaning of <i>avgotaraho</i>, which you
probably knew already. Now whether it has a figurative use denoting
"two inseparable friends" I can't honestly say, but I think I have
heard it; and it is a very possible expression, not from the grains
of roe sticking together but because, now I come to think of it,
botargo is always made in pairs like a twin banana, only flatter.
They tell me that the botargo sold in England is made from the
complete roe of the grey mullet and that consequently the pieces
vary a good deal in size; and that all of it comes from
Greece--usually from Preveza, at the mouth of the Gulf of
Arta".</p>

<p>Thus far my friend. Botargo is also made in Tunis and doubtless
elsewhere; I have heard that it was originally a Jewish
invention.</p>

<p>The fish as a Christian symbol crops up in Di-dot III, (2,
718).</p>

<p>Grammarians are derided (11, 20) for using pompous and
old-fashioned words like <i>kamasenes</i> (fish).</p>

<p>The ancients, although they knew the facts and classified the
dolphin as half-way between mammal and fish, preferred to speak of
it as wholly a fish--Bianor, recounting the story of how Arion,
thrown overboard by pirates, was saved from a watery death by a
dolphin, marvels that the sea should contain fishes which are
juster than men. And he echoes this astonishment in a second poem,
which describes a statue erected to commemorate this event (this
may be the statue of Arion at Taenarus which is mentioned by
Herodotus. The event is also recorded on certain coins of Lesbos;
indeed the dolphin, in one shape or another, will be found engraved
on the coins of at least forty different cities. A crowned dolphin
represents the arms of the London Fishmon-gers' Compauy).</p>

<p>Christodorus tells of another statue which portrayed Poseidon in
the act of giving a dolphin to his beloved Amymone. Yet another
such work is hymned by Palladas: it figured the god of Love
unarmed, and holding in his hands a dolphin and a flower--emblems
of his dominion over earth and sea. Sometimes the same deity is
discovered riding on a dolphin, a beast whose shape lends itself
admirably to plastic represe n-tation.</p>

<p>Meleager has six dainty lines, wishing he were a dolphin, that
he might carry through the waves his boy-friend Andragathus, his
"soul's half", to Rhodes, whither the lad was bound. There is also
a queer verse about a dog losing its life because it jumped into
the sea to catch the dolphins, and Lucilius, in his best hyperbolic
vein, tells the skipper of a boat which lets in a good deal of
water that dolphins and Nereids are already sporting about inside
her saloon and that, if she continues to leak after this fashion,
there will soon be no sea left in the sea--</p>

<pre>
O Diophantes, the sides of the ship
Leak, and through the port-holes the sea doth slip:
Dolphins in schools, and Nereus' children bright
Are swimming in thy ship before our sight.
If we delay, soon men in it will sail,
For water in the sea begins to fail.
</pre>

<p>Three poets, Anyte, Archias and Antipater, lament the fate of a
dolphin which was cast on land during a tempest and then (says one
of them) reverently buried by the country-folk. Another such
creature is praised for having conveyed a weary, storm-tossed
nightingale, friend of man, from the ocean to the beach; a third
for performing the same humanitarian office to a dripping corpse
and thereby losing its life, since it was left stranded high and
dry on the shore. The most famous of corpse-transporting dolphins
was probably that which brought to land the body of Hesiod, thrown
into the sea by the sons of Phegeus, who suspected him of seducing
their sister (<i>Contest of Homer and Hesiod</i>). According to
a--non-Anthology--Greek legend, a certain of these officious
sea-beasts on one occasion made a lamentable <i>gaffe</i>. It
picked up, in mistake for a man, a living monkey which had been
washed overboard near the Attic coast, and only discovered its
error at the last moment, when, disgusted with the blunder, it left
the poor monkey to drown within a few yards of the shore. The souls
of the human dead, in the form of butterflies, were borne to the
Elysian Fields on the back of a dolphin.</p>

<p>Dolphins were originally men; the transformation was performed
by Bacchus.</p>

<p>From these and many other sources, we may gather that there was
supposed to exist an obscure but powerful bond of affection between
this asimal and humanity, and that it was endowed with a certain
kindheartedness and man-loving propensity. This is obviously not
the case; the dolphin cares no more a bout us than cares the
haddock. What is the origin of this belief? I conjecture that the
beast was credited with these social sentiments out of what may be
called poetic reciprocation. Mankind, loving the merry gambols and
other endearing characteristics of the dolphin, which has a playful
trick of escorting vessels for its own amusement, whose presence
signified fair weather, and whose parental attachment to its
offspring won their esteem--quite apart from its fabled, perhaps
real, love of music or at least of noisy sounds--were pleased to
invest it with feelings akin to their own. They were fond of the
dolphin; what more natural and becoming than that the dolphin
should be fond of them? A sympathy for man, equally charming and
equally fanciful, was attributed to other creatures as well; to the
nightingale, for instance, or to the swallow, which profits by our
hospitality solely in order to satisfy its personal nesting
instincts; and long may it do so.</p>

<p>There is no reference in the Anthology to the play of colours on
the dying dolphin, a subject that might have appealed to some of
its poets. "We got aboard a coryphene, the dolphin of sailors. It
gave us in its death agony the famous display, beautiful, but
rather painful to watch, for the wonderful hues, as they changed,
stayed in the eye, and sent to the mind only a message of a
creature in a violent death struggle" (H. M. Tomlinson: <i>The Sea
and the Jungle</i>).</p>

<p>Four kinds of crustaceans are named, and they are not easy to
disentangle. We have the <i>karis</i> (5, 185) which is presumably
the langouste (<i>Palinurus vulgaris</i>), and may sometimes be
applied to prawns or shrimps--</p>

<pre>
Demetrius, to market! And from Amyntas buy
Three graylings and ten soles, and also don't forget
Two dozen wriggly prawns--he'll count the right supply--
Then bring them home, but six rose garlands also get
From Theuborius and--well! in passing, perhaps you might
Step in and Tryphera ask to join us in a bite.
</pre>

<p>This sounds as if the beasts were prawns; two dozen shrimps is
not enough for such a party, and two dozen langoustes almost too
much.</p>

<p>These crustaceans were generally roasted by the ancients, since
it was considered unhealthy to eat them boiled. Athenaeus quotes
one old poet saying:</p>

<p>"I'll make them redder than a roasted <i>karis</i>" and
another:</p>

<pre>
"And then they danced like crook-limbed karides
Dance on the glowing embers".
</pre>

<p>On the islands they still roast the flesh of the langouste after
removing its head, and preserve it pickled in brine. <i>Karides
(karidia)</i> signifies shrimps nowadays; "bent karides" and "the
small race of karides" were the shrimps of Aristotle. The word
<i>karis</i>, in the singular, does not occur in his writings.
There is a seven-line enigma on the <i>karis</i> (Didot III, 7,
54)-</p>

<p>Next, there is mention of a <i>karabos</i>, a spiky crab,
Maecius Quintus (6, 8g) tells of a <i>karabos</i>, which was caught
with a rod and eaten roasted by a certain old fisherman, who
dedicated its empty shell to Priapus of the beach, in the hope of
winning his good will. The <i>karabos</i> of Aristotle has been
identified with the langouste (Aubert and Wimmer); that of Oppian
with the <i>Cancer elephas</i> of Herbst (Lenz).</p>

<p>Another crab, <i>pagouros</i>, is commemorated by Statylius
Flaccus (6, 196) in some quaint lines--</p>

<pre>
This sand-diver, crook-legged, with two-clawed gear,
Neckless, eight-footed, who can backward steer,
This strong-crouped swimmer, that hard shell doth wear,
This crab, Copasus, a line-fisher, here
To Pan doth as his catch's first fruits bear.
</pre>

<p>This species is said to be the <i>Eriphia spinifrons</i> of
Herbst. According to Lenz, the <i>pagouros</i> of Oppian is
probably Linne's <i>Cancer maenas</i>. Aubert and Wimmer despair of
throwing any light upon the <i>pagouroi</i> of Aristotle. It is
characteristic of the confusing ways of modern nomenclature that
the name <i>pagurus</i> should now be given to the following
species, the hermit-crab, which has been clearly described by the
ancients; a doubly stupid proceeding, since the hermit-crab's tail
is certainly not "fast".</p>

<p>Simonides has also the <i>karkinos</i>, which corresponds to
Oppian's and Aristotle's description of the hermit-crab (I have
lost the reference). It was the <i>karkinos</i> to whom fell the
honour of putting an end to the battle of the Frogs and the Mice.
Its flesh is described (not in the Anthology) as heavy and
indigestible. "You will never make the <i>karkinos</i> walk
straight" (Didot III, 6, 277).</p>

<p>I find no reference to fresh-water crayfish, nor yet to another
species which must have struck the ancients--the land-crab,
<i>thelphusa</i>, the fearsome creature that you will encounter
chiefly in the serpentine districts, where moisture is more easily
retained than on the limestone. Philippson (p. 558) says that this
crab is a favourite Lenten dish. And, talking of crabs, an
altogether new species will strike the modern traveller in the
country districts of Greece--tinned ones bearing a label which
speaks highly for Japanese enterprise: "These crabs are taken frota
the cold water of the North Sea. Packed with greatest care in Japan
by an improved process".</p>

<p>I am relieved to say that the old word <i>astakos</i> does not
occur in the Anthology. The <i>astakos</i> of Aristotle is clearly
a lobster, and a friend tells me that in modern Greece it still
means the same. So it may do, and so it does. At the same time, if
you ask for an <i>astako</i>, as I never fail to do when there is
any chance of getting it, they will probably give you a langouste.
And thank God for that. Far be it from me to say a word against any
of the recipes, hot or cold, for dressing a langouste; in the long
run, I think, the simple Greek method is the most appetizing--cold,
with olive oil and lemon juice and herbs of different kinds. Here
is a more Sybaritic one, which I owe to the kindness of my
long-suffering friend in Athens:</p>

<pre>
For 1/2 oke of langouste, take:

100 drames of onions
200    "    " tomatoes.
100    "    " white wine
50     "    " butter
Salt, pepper, and a spoonful of chopped parsley.

Cut the onions very fine and put them in a saucepan with
the butter. Put the saucepan on the fire till the onions
get a light brown colour. Then throw in the tomatoes,
after having them cleaned and cut into fine slices, or
made into a pulp. Mix the contents of the saucepan on
the fire for a few minutes and add the wine, a little
water, salt, pepper and the chopped parsley. Let the whole
boil for a short time and then throw in the langouste
after having removed with scissors the end of the feet
and the horns, and let the langouste and the feet boil
for 18-20 minutes.

In case the sauce does not become thick enough, increase
the intensity of the fire and let the contents boil till
the sauce becomes sufficiently thick.

If oil instead of butter be used, the dish can also be
served cold.

Here are the metrical values of Greek weights and measures:
English ones are beyond me:

1 oke = 1,420 kilo,
50 drames = 0,133 kilo.
</pre>

<p>Cephalopods. There are two epigrams on a fragment of a
scolopendra--probably, thinks Prof. Mackail, the tentacle of some
huge squid--which was tossed ashore in a storm and hung up as a
gift to the deities of Ocean. The following is one of them (6,
223)--</p>

<pre>
This broken body of sea-roaming beast,
A scolopendra, on the sandy shore,
Torn by the rocks, all fouled by the foam's yeast,
And lengthened out to twice four poles or more,
Hermonax found, as in his fisher's trade
He drew the deep. This offering now hath he
To Ino and her son Palaemon made,
The sea-gods' due--a monster of the sea.
</pre>

<p>The sea-scolopendra of Aristotle seems to have been a worm of
the <i>Nereidae</i>-family (bait-worm).</p>

<p>The ordinary cuttle-fish (<i>teuthis</i>; whence, I suppose, the
Italian <i>totano</i>) is named (10, 16), as well as the octopus,
whose colour changes have been admirably described by Aristotle and
are also noticed by a couple of these Anthology poets. Of this
animal two fantastic stories are told: how an eagle, pouncing upon
an octopus, becomes entangled in its limbs and falls into the sea
with its prey (9, 10), and how another octopus, thrown into the air
by Phaedo the fisherman, accidentally alights upon a sleeping hare
and holds it fast, whereby Phaedo gains one prize from the sea and
another from the land. There are three variants of this last and
peculiarly inept yarn (9, 14 and 94 and 227). The Greek word sepia
is not found in the Anthology, nor is there any mention of
sea-products like urchins or anemones or coral. I will mention
later the argonaut, which Aristotle rightly classed among the
cephalopods.</p>

<p>Sponges, "blossoms of the sea", the "watery couch of sea-roving
Triton", are named about four times; there is a dedicatory epigram
by Ariston (6, 306) showing that cooks used them for cleaning up,
and three others, one by Phanias and two by Paul, in which sponges
figure among the implements necessary to scribes of their period.
Here is one of the latter's (6, 65) pedestrian but otherwise
interesting poems, the "rough stone" in question being pumice--</p>

<pre>
Lead disk that, following the ruler straight,
  Correct its measured track can indicate;
Hard steel that cuts the pens; the ruler too,
  Whose guiding keeps the line exactly true;
And the rough stone which, when dulled by long use,
  The split-toothed reed with sharpened point renews;
The sponge, whereon sea-roving Triton makes
  His submerged bed, which mends the pen's mistakes;
The ink-box, whose pigeon-holes in one unite
  For the art of writing all that's requisite--
Callimenes to Hermes gives, now he
  Rests his worn hand, weak from senility.
</pre>

<p>Land-shells will have to find a place here. From an epigram of
one of the poets called Automedon we learn that snails were eaten
(11, 319). He is laughing at the ease with which Athenian
citizenship was granted to outsiders--</p>

<pre>
Charcoal in sacks if you bring ten
They'll make you straight a citizen,
But if a pig, one so magnanimous
Will then even be dubbed Triptolemus.
Also your backer Heraclides
With quite a small bribe satisfied is,
   Be it some cabbage kails,
   Lentils, or little snails.
Furnished with some such bakshish small,
Yourself Erechtheus, Cecrops, call,
Or Codrus p'rhaps--that's your affair--
No one an obol's damn will care.
</pre>

<p>Crates of Thebes wishes to regulate his life accor-ding to the
"humility of the snail and the economy of the ant"; he was a Cynic
philosopher. There is a childishly simple enigma on the snail in
Didot III (7, 17). The Romans had a cult of snails, and Varro
describes how to set up a profitable snail-garden.</p>

<p>The purple dye of the murex is named four or five times; it was
used for tinting hair-nets and suchlike. The only mollusc mentioned
as being eaten is the <i>ous</i>, the ormer (= <i>auris maris</i>)
or ear-shell (5, 181). Oysters were relished by men of antiquity,
but the Anthology contains no reference to them from this point of
view. Antiphilus (9, 86) describes how a greedy mouse, nibbling at
an open oyster, is forthwith clapped up and entombed in its shell;
the pearl is named in Christian times both by Saint Gregory and
Paulus Silentiarius, the latter of whom has an elegant effusion
addressed to a lady (5, 301), offering her the gift of a pearl. Its
eight lines have been translated by J. A. Pott, and not badly, into
sixteen English ones.</p>

<p>The portrait of Aphrodite is engraved on a sea. shell; another
such cameo represents a sleeping Eros (9, 325)--</p>

<pre>
Of old on sea-washed rock my home was in the deep,
With the luxuriance of sea-weed clad:
But in my bosom now that winsome one doth sleep,
Eros, the well-crowned Cyprian's dainty lad.
</pre>

<p>Shells of the paper nautilus, <i>argonauta</i>, served as
ornaments for young girls who, when they were married, consecrated
them to Venus together with their other childish toys. This comes
out in some lines by Callimachus (Jacobs' Appendix, 45) which
figure a nautilus telling its own history: how, after a seamanlike
(<i>nautilos</i>) life on the waves--sailing with the breeze, or
rowing in calm weather--it is shipwrecked on the shore of lulis
(home of the great Simonides, in the island of Ceos) and, no longer
a companion of water-loving halcyons, is given by Selenaea of
Smyrna, on her marriage, to Venus Arsinoe, with a prayer for
favours.</p>

<p>In the twenty-line version by Merivale of this twelve-line poem,
I should have preferred if, instead of "polished shell", which
suggests nothing, he had stuck to the original <i>nautilus</i>,
since the point of the poem turns on it. I also think that this old
name should have been retained by Linne for the beast--it is a
Greek word for a Greek animal--instead of being conferred on an
exotic (of however reputable lineage) that frequents the Indian and
Pacific Oceans.</p>

<p>Other shells were offered to other deities; one of the
many-winding, labyrinthine species was dedicated by Dionysus, son
of Protarchus, as a plaything to the nymphs of a certain sea-cave
(6, 224); while a second, of the hard and trumpet-shaped variety,
is given to the Phoebus of some cape in Bithynia by Damis the old
fisherman, who, with this "humble offering from pious heart",
implores the god that lie may encounter death without suffering
disease (6, 230). One would like to linger over this aspect of
ancient life, so different from that of our own day. <a name="ch-6"

<h2>CREEPING THINGS</h2>

<p>The catalogue of insects and creeping things mentioned in the
Anthology is relatively long; longer than that of the mammals; some
thirty in all. There was a notable accession to its numbers in
Graeco-Roman days, when poets like Lucilius used these small deer
for similes which to-day sound rather jejune. Yes; it must be
confessed that Lucilius is not up to his usual mark in these
particular epigrams; they would naturally have more point if, like
his contemporaries, we knew something about the people whom he was
caricaturing.</p>

<p>Here, meanwhile, is the list: ant and flying ant, spider,
scorpion, wasp, beetle (<i>kantharos</i> and <i>sphondyle</i>),
caterpillar, worm, maggot, silkworm (<i>ser</i> and <i>bombyx</i>),
bookworm (<i>ses</i> and <i>silphe</i>), woodworm (<i>thrips</i>
and <i>teredon</i>}, leech, bee, cricket, cicada, locust
(<i>attelabos</i>), another such animal called <i>kalamitis</i>,
fly, dogfly, gadfly, gnat, mosquito, tick, flea, louse, bug.</p>

<p>Philippus (g, 438) notes the cunning of ants who made a bridge
of straw in order to reach some honey which had been placed out of
their reach safely, as the owner thought, in a dish of water.
Lucilius describes Menestratus astride upon an ant as if it were an
elephant, and Adrastus, another little man, seated on a flying ant
and addressing it in grandiloquent style as "Pegasus". He continues
this kind of joke with spiders. Tiny Chaeremon was lifted up by the
breeze and would have been blown away, had his foot not caught in a
spider's web--again, the same person was knocked down by a poplar
leaf and now lies flat on the ground "like Tityus" (the son of
Earth, whose body covered nine furlongs) or rather, adds the poet,
"like a caterpillar". Nicarchus is in the same vein. A spider spins
Demas into its web and holds him fast; Diophantes, weary of life,
hangs himself with the thread of a spider; another of these heroes
(n, 407) is snatched up by a fly, dropped once more, and now hangs
by his eyelids from a spider's web.</p>

<p>The cleverness of spiders at weaving is praised more than once.
Young girls, on the occasion of their marriage, dedicate to
Aphrodite, among other things, their face-veils "fine as spiders'
webs". Erycius (9, 233) tells of a woodcutter called Mindon who was
bitten by a spider (? a solpuga) in the left foot. The limb began
to fester and was amputated at the knee; now he hobbles about on
one leg with the help of a stick--</p>

<pre>
As thou, poor Mindon, wert cutting dry trees,
A spider, hid there, did thy left foot seize
And bit it from beneath. The venom spread,
Eating the fresh flesh under the heel's tread;
Then thy strong leg was cut off at the knee,
And a wild olive staff now carries thee.
</pre>

<p>I have already mentioned Panopeus the lion-hunter, who was
killed by a scorpion. A raven is described (9&gt; 339) as swooping
down on a scorpion and allowing itself to be stung by the beast. No
raven would be such a fool. "Scorpion" was also used as a term of
reproach; Ammianus (11, 227) thus addresses some unpleasant
person--</p>

<pre>
Sooner beetles (<i>kantharos</i>) honey, mosquitoes milk supply
Than, scorpion, an act of thine could edify:
Doing no good thyself, others thou dost debar
From doing it: thou'rt loathed by all, like Saturn's star.
</pre>

<p>The wasp was regarded as a symbol of malignity. Poets like
Hipponax and Archilochus are compared to wasps for the cruelty of
their verses. According to Archelaus (Didot III, 3, 51), this
insect issued out of the dead body of a horse--</p>

<pre>
Out from the carcase of a horse engendered were
These wasps. Note thus what things from what
nature can rear.
</pre>

<p>There is only one reference to the moth, though not by name, in
a pretty couplet by Meleager (5, 57), and none at all to the
butterfly, not even the time-honoured metaphor likening its escape
from the chrysalis to the flight of the human soul from earth.
Ancient literature is somewhat niggard in its mention of the poetic
butterfly. Regarding caterpillars, Anti-phanes is furious (9, 256),
and rightly furious, with a certain hairy-backed caterpillar,
because it devoured the last remaining apple on the highest branch
of a half-dead tree--an apple on which he had set his heart.</p>

<p>The worm, <i>skolex</i>, and maggot, <i>eule</i>, are associated
with the dead; so in two sepulchral epigrams by Leonidas of
Tarentum (7, 472 and 480). The use of maggots which drop from the
head of goats is explained in an oracle (14, 149) given to
Timocrates of Athens, who went to enquire about epilepsy. Gregory
(8, 105) mentions silk, the "delicate threads of the <i>seres</i>",
the Seric--Indian or Chinese--worms; silkworms. The other word for
silkworm, <i>bombyx</i>, is applied in the compound
<i>goniobombykes</i> (Didot III, 5, 25) to bookworms, human ones,
that labour or spin webs in dark corners. This particular poem is
by Herodi-cus. In a similar one by Philippus (u, 321) the same
grammarians are called <i>setes akanthon</i>, thorn-moths or
thorn-worms, because they browse on thorny passages in books; in
the following epigram they are <i>setes akanthobatai</i>,
clambering about thorns; and elsewhere (IT, 347)
<i>akanthologoi</i>, fond of thorny questions. So bookworm then had
the same sense as to-day--those who feed on recondite learning. The
ses of Aristotle, however, can be nothing but the clothes-moth,
<i>Tinea pellionella</i>.</p>

<p>The Aristotelean <i>silphe</i> is not to be identified, though
some think it may mean the cockroach. But <i>silphe</i> in the
Anthology is again the bookworm, and one of the five poets called
Evenus has a violent outburst against this pest, cursing the
"bitterest enemy of the Muses" for his mischief (9, 251); the last
line, still defective, has been slightly emended by Jacobs--</p>

<pre>
Page-eater thou, the Muses' bitterest foe,
Hidden destroyer, feeding constantly
On stolen wisdom, why, black worm, lurk low
In holy works, emblem of jealousy?
Far from the Muses fly! And do not show
The envious tip of thy sharp probe to me--
</pre>

<p>to which the following is the obvious reply:</p>

<pre>
Quoth the bookworm "I don't care a bit
If the writer has wisdom or wit.
A volume must be Pretty tough to bore me
As completely as I can bore it".
</pre>

<p>Lucilius remarks of a popular boxer (n, 78) that his head is so
bashed about as to resemble a sieve or the lower part of a
worm-eaten book; he is to go on boxing, none the less, for even if
hit on the head again, he can only be hit in the same old dents;
there is no room for any fresh ones. Still more far-fetched is the
conceit of Strato who, viewing the portrait on wood of one of his
many loves, wishes for nothing better than to be able to turn into
a woodworm, <i>thrips</i>, or a crawling <i>teredon</i>, in order
that he might eat it up (12, 190). <i>Thrips</i> seems to signify
the larvae of moths that feed on wood, while <i>teredon</i> applies
to any kind of boring worm.</p>

<p>The <i>spondyle</i> or <i>sphondyle</i> of Aristotle is also not
to be identified; dictionaries call it an insect which lives on the
roots of plants and has a strong smell when attacked. The word
occurs once in Didot III (6, 277), in whose Latin version it
figures as <i>blatta</i>; its evil smell is noted. <i>Blatta</i> in
most cases signifies a cockroach. Here is the line: Donee blatta
fugiendo pessimum flatum emittit; and a variant: Namque ut blatta
jacit fugiens inamabile virus. Some cockroaches are found on
plants; but so are also certain of the Heteroptera, of the shield
bugs, which emit a far more pungent and offensive odour. The Keeper
of the Insects in the British Museum tells me that the larvae of
the modern genus <i>spondylis</i> live in old fir-stumps, but that
the beetle does not seem to be characterized by any particular
smell, although one of the Longicorns, to which this genus
belongs--the musk beetle, <i>Aromia moschata</i>--has a fairly
strong odour.</p>

<p>We have two mentions of the leech. A certain ruler is likened to
a "cruel leech" (n, 359), and Flaccus (6, 193) talks of an old
fisherman as a "leech of the sea-crags", presumably because he sat
with his line day and night on a rock, as if glued to it.</p>

<p>There are fifty or more references in the Anthology to the bee
and its products--no disproportionate-number, when one considers
that, from time immemorial, men have held in veneration this
cantankerous and fussy insect which, by dint of specializing in
communistic habits, has lost every shred of individuality.</p>

<p>A swarm of bees settled upon the mouth of Pindar at birth,
foretelling the sweetness of his verse--likewise on that of
Menander. Plato writes of Love asleep, while bees sprinkle honey
upon his divine lips--Cicero tells the same story of Plato himself,
and perhaps (who knows?) somebody else has told it of Cicero by
this time. Sappho and Erinna are likened to bees that gather honey
from many blossoms; as to Nossis--Eros himself has melted the wax
upon which her poems are inscribed. There are sundry metaphors on
these lines. Oribasius the physician, a most learned person, is
compared to a bee for his zeal in hiving the wisdom of
predecessors. The poet Cyrus, exiled by his Emperor, talks of
himself as a bee persecuted by drones; Lucian, always sensible,
suggests that a man intent upon acquiring riches is like a bee
whose honey will in due course be devoured by others: a sound
parallel, which a good many p eople fail to take to heart. "To
speak ill of others is Attic honey"--so ends a quatrain by
Palladas. This looks as if he had been reading La
Rochefoucauld.</p>

<p>There is a description of a primitive form of candle made with
beeswax, which clients gave to their patrons at the Saturnalia
festival; and the old belief that these creatures are "oxborn",
that is, generated in the carcase of a bull, crops up more than
once, in spite of the fact that the ancients themselves, beginning
with Aristotle, noticed the dislike of the bee to any kind of
strong smell. They were confusing the bee with the drone-fly,
<i>Eristalis tenax</i>, to which it bears a close resemblance (T.
F. Royds: <i>The Beasts, Birds and Bees of Virgil</i>, 1918).</p>

<p>Two sad accidents are recorded in connexion with this insect.
Both Bianor and Antipater of Thessalonica lament the fate of baby
Hermonax who, innocently toddling or crawling too near to the
hives, was massacred by their inmates, that drove into him their
wretched stings, more savage that those of vipers. The death of a
certain rustic, mourned by Antiphilus, is more singular; so
singular as to verge on the improbable. He had climbed a precipice
with a rope after wild honey, and, while hanging there, was sent
rolling down to death by his own dog, which bit through the rope
because of the honey that trickled down it.</p>

<p>This same Antiphilus has also a neat poem in praise of the bee
and its works; Nicias, friend of Theocritus, another; two more, by
Meleager and Strato, warning the bee not to trouble their
respective loves, are of unusual finish and charm. Marcus
Ar-gentarius, in a different vein, has four lines about a girl
called Melissa ("Bee") who, like her namesake, drops sweet honey
when she gives her kisses, and then stings murderously (when it
conies to paying for them). Statues of Pan were set up, as guardian
of the hives. Cliton, the bee-keeper, is described as dedicating to
the gods a honeycomb in place of the usual warm-blooded sacrifice;
Diodorus Zonas, in some delightful lines, refers to the custom of
smoking out the bees with deft hand. There is also an anonymous
sepulchral epigram on an old bee-keeper who lived all by himself
among the mountains--a poem remarkable from more than one point of
view. I doubt whether it can be made to read better, more stonily,
than in Mackail's prose translation--</p>

<p>Naiads and chill cattle-pastures, tell to the bees when they
come on their springtide way, that old Leucippus perished on a
winter's night, setting snares for scampering hares, and no longer
is the tending of the hives dear to him; but the pastoral dells
mourn sore for him who dwelt with the mountain peak for
neighbour.</p>

<p>All this encroaches, I fear, upon the category of domestic
animals. For the rest, I cannot say when bees were first
domesticated--if such a word is applicable to them--in these
regions. There are passages in Homer showing that honey was
appreciated, as when Achilles deposes some on the pyre of Patroclus
in accordance, I suppose, with the Eastern belief that the bee,
descended from Heaven, is immortal and a symbol of immortality. His
heroes also mixed it with wine, which is said to be an
Indo-Germanic custom, though it may well have grown up in
independent fashion all over the ancient world wherever the
ingredients were simultaneously procurable. The compound, which the
Romans called <i>mulsum</i> and which may be taken to be
unfermented mead, is named by Diogenes Laertius and again in a
felicitous quatrain by Strato, likening a friendship between two
young boys to this <i>oinomeli</i>, this lovely union of twc lovely
things, wine and honey--</p>

<pre>
'Tis sweet in undiluted wine bees' honeyed stream to pour,
And sweet, while beautiful oneself, some young friend to adore,
Even as curled Cleobulus is now Alexis' care:
The immortal mead of Kypris--the blending of this pair!
</pre>

<p>A mixture of honey and wine and pepper named <i>conditum</i> is
required for his stomach-trouble by Palladas, who peevishly asks
what the word can mean, and, although a schoolmaster by trade,
professes to be unaware of its derivation from the Latin
<i>condio</i>. Whether Homer's countrymen built hives for the bees
is not clear to me. In the Odyssey there is mention of a cavern of
the Nymphs which contained marble amphoras and urns wherein the
bees made their home: were the vessels specially constructed for
this purpose? Wild honey must certainly have been commoner than at
present, as common as it is in India or Africa to-day.</p>

<p>Indeed, the literature of the bee, even in olden days, is not
easily exhausted. These men required wax for their tablets and
statuary models and encaustic painting and what not, as did the
Christians of later days for their church candles--whence those
pious conjurations in mediaeval Latin (possibly reproduced from
early heathen originals) imploring the mother of the bees not to
fly far away, but to settle with her swarm on the tree prepared for
her, where she may do her work <i>in the name of the Lord</i>.
Furthermore, they thought mighty well of the bee's industry and of
its orderly habits, and drew many edifying parables therefrom,
forgetful of the fact that it loafs for nearly half the year and is
orderly only because it lacks such independence of character and
imagination as even a louse possesses.</p>

<p>Having no sugar--they knew sugar; it was called <i>sakhar</i> or
<i>meli to kalaminon</i>, cane-honey, and is first mentioned by
Theophrastus, later on by Strabo, Aelian, Seneca, Lucan and others;
it came from India and was used, according to Pliny, for medicinal
purposes; one of the Anthology poets, Ammianus, has a couplet about
"licking the sugar-cane"--having no sugar worth speaking of, they
also needed honey up to a recent period. The Romans actually
imported it from north of the Alps, and that bee-maniac
Charlemagne, later on, had sixty hives of his own. It is not
surprising, therefore, that their poets from earliest to latest
days should sing the praises of honey, an overrated article of diet
which ruins with its perfumery flavour whatever it is used for
sweetening, be it liquid or solid. An anonymous writer in the
Planudean Appendix records that "too much of honey is gall". He had
perhaps been living in Greece, like myself.</p>

<p>The ancients had a peculiar fondness for the cicada,
<i>fettix</i>, and for the cricket, <i>akris</i>; it was a
veritable cult, the fairest expression of which I take to be the
well-known poem in the Anacreontea. Glyptic art also abounds in
gracious images of them; one need only glance into works like those
of Furtwangler and Imhoof-Blumer. The Anthology contains a great
number of references to both, although Agathias, when he speaks of
the <i>akris</i> as destructive to the harvest (11,365) must have
had some other species in mind, since crickets are not likely to
injure plants. He errs in good company, if he errs at all, for
Theocritus--whom he copied closely, as we have seen in the case of
the tree-frog--uses the same word in the sense, possibly, of locust
(<i>Idyll</i> V, 108). Kynaston, therefore, commenting on another
passage in Theocritus where the word akris occurs again
(<i>Idyll</i> I, 52) calls <i>akridoihera</i> a
"locust-trap"--because locusts may injure the vines. This strikes
me as a scholarly misreading. The child in this Idyll is not
building a trap for locusts (what bait could he use?); he is
weaving a cage to contain crickets which he means to keep as
pets.</p>

<p>In saying this, I know I have weighty authority against me, and
as the matter concerns no less a person than Theocritus, I will go
into it a little more carefully. I admit, then, that (1) the
suspicious word <i>akridothera</i> means, literally translated, a
contrivance for catching <i>akrides</i>, and that (2) in
<i>Idyll</i> V. 108 it looks as if the <i>akris</i> were not a
cricket but a grasshopper or locust of some species which may leap
over a hedge and, for all I know, damage the vines--while not
forgetting (a) that a cricket can, and does, leap too, and could
likewise cross a hedge in a series of two or three jumps, and (b)
that Theocritus may have shared the common opinion as to crickets
injuring plants, and (c) that, as the keeper of the insects in the
British Museum informs me, the large green or long-horned
grasshopper, which one would suppose to be the plant-destroying
insect in question, "prefers an animal diet", and (d) that the
requirements of verse or common usage may have suggested to
Theocritus the employment of the word <i>akris</i> in preference to
something like <i>mastax</i> or <i>parnops</i> or <i>achetas</i> or
whatever else insects of this tribe were called, and (e) that
<i>akris</i> is elsewhere used to designate what is unquestionably
the locust, as in Diodorus' account (III, 2) of the akridophagi of
the desert and their woeful deaths, and (f) that akris, nowadays at
least, is the correct term for the destructive locust--witness the
current modern proverb: "San na perasane akridhes", as if locusts
had passed by.</p>

<p>Up to this point there may be room for dispute. But the learned
author of the Doric lexicon (<i>Theocritus</i>, London, 1829) whom
Kynaston followed in his interpretation of <i>akridothera</i>
("<i>decipula ad locustas capiendas</i>", that is, a locust-trap)
goes further than I care to go. He says "akris enim locustam
significat, quam Galli a saltando vocant Sauterelle". In this he
has all antiquity against him; to say nothing of common sense. To
begin with: the French for <i>akris</i> is grillon rather than
sauterelle; and then, although the Greeks may have had some queer
sports and hobbies, I feel sure that none of them ever indulged in
the nightmarish pastime of trying to catch grasshoppers
(sauterelles) in traps. The boy who in <i>Idyll</i> I. 52 plaits
the <i>akridothera</i> is doubtless plaiting what other boys or
other poets would call by the ordinary word <i>akridotheke</i>.</p>

<p>No importance need be attached to the fact that Heredia, in one
of his <i>Trophees</i>, renders cricket or cicada as "verte
sauterelle"--</p>

<pre>
Ici gaet, Etranger, la verte sauterelle
Que durant deux saisons nourrit la jeune Hellae, etc.
</pre>

<p>--such accidents are liable to happen to the best of us, when we
try to stretch Natural History upon the Procrustean couch of the
sonnet-form.</p>

<p>A third insect of the same class is once named, the
<i>attelabos</i>, a kind of wingless grasshopper, according to the
dictionaries. It seems to have appeared in multitudes, and was
possibly the young of the true locust, whose unformed wings allow
them only to hop about. Grotius has rendered it in this passage as
<i>bruchus</i>, equivalent to the Greek <i>brouchos</i>, and the
poem in question, by Lucilius (n, 265), runs as follows--</p>

<pre>
If against locusts or dogflies there be crusade,
Or against mice, or frogs, or the fleas' horse brigade,
Fear, Caius, lest some one should come and enlist thee,
As being fit to fight against such enemy.
But if 'tis question of brave men--keep on thy games;
'Tis not a Pigmies' war on cranes that Rome proclaims
</pre>

<p><i>Bruco</i>, nowadays, is the Italian for caterpillar, which
shows how the meanings of these words shift about.</p>

<p>These creatures, <i>attelaboi</i>, are mentioned by Herodotus
when he says that a certain Libyan tribe dries them, reduces them
to powder, and, sprinkling their, in milk, drinks them. I fail to
see why his description should not apply to the full-grown locust,
which unfortunately is not wingless. Sundevall identifies the
<i>attelabos</i> of Aristotle with the true locust (<i>Gryllus
migratorius</i>). Be that as it may, such customs are wondrously
slow to change. Here is Doughty, more than two thousand years
later, writing of the Bedouin women of Arabia, with their dried
locust meat stived in sacks--"they mingle this, brayed small, with
their often only liquid diet of sour buttermilk. Locust powder is
not victual to set before guests".</p>

<p>The word <i>kalamitis</i> is used by Leonidas of Tar-entum (7,
198) as synonymous with akris. Perhaps it is the same as
<i>kalamaia</i> which, from its colour and slender form, may stand
for the praying mantis. Or perhaps it means something else, for
Didot's Latin rendering of the passage in which the word occurs
(<i>Ephilato kalamitiri</i>) is "dilexit me
in-culmis-degentem".</p>

<p>The <i>tettix</i> and the <i>akris</i>, then, were kept in cages
as pets and fed on moist green stuff, which is not their natural
food, since the former lives on the juice it obtains by boring into
tree-branches, and the latter prefers an animal to a vegetable
diet. They were thus kept for the sake of their "music". Now the
song of the cicada is as nerve-racking to most English people as
that of the canary bird, or more so. Other facts point in the same
direction, to wit, that the ancients possessed ears different from
our own, ears both coarser and more refined. For they claim to
detect subtle modulations in the cicada's melody, which they call
sweeter than that of the cuckoo and which was supposed to provoke
noonday sleep (the cicada, unlike the cricket, is silent at
night--with the rarest exceptions). I can perceive at the utmost
two variants in that song which, needless to say, is no song at all
but a loud and persistent, though to me not disagreeable, rasping
sound; the idea of keeping one of these ear-splitting musicians
caged in his room will not occur to everybody. We are delighted to
hear them out of doors, not so much for the sake of their chant
itself as because it proclaims the plenitude, the full summer
glory, of earth and sky; what memories of other summers, long gone
by, does not that first cicada's chirp evoke! None the less one
calls to mind, even on such occasions, another saying of the
ancients: "Happy are the cicadas, for they have voiceless wives",
since, were the ladies gifted with the strident notes of their
husbands, many districts would be almost uninhabitable after
June.</p>

<p>There is no doubt about it: these men of antiquity, like their
modern descendants, loved noise as such--it is one aspect of a
rowdy-dowdy element which interpenetrates even the best period of
Greek history; and not only that. As Professor Mahaffy and others
have pointed out, they could no more bear solitude and silence than
can any Mediterranean race of today. The cicada made a cheerful
din, and kept it up without a moment's respite; it gave them what
they craved for--company; and they were duly grateful to that beast
which, although consecrated to Apollo, became at the same time the
emblem of bad poets, by reason of its ceaseless chatter. So Plato
tells us somewhere that those men who preferred singing even to
food and drink--and there are such men in the South--were changed
by the Muses into cicadas. Shepherds are credited in the Anthology
with preferring its music to that of the lyre. These writers hold
it to be the "nightingale of the Muses" striking sweet melody from
its wings or back (chirping with tongueless mouth, says one of
them; with two-tongued mouth, says another); in fact, so many
polite things are said that it is quite a relief to find Meleager
begging the cicada to "sing a new song" by way of a change.</p>

<p>It is otherwise with the <i>akris</i> race, those terrestrial
crickets, the "Muses of the fields" whose note, however monotonous,
is softer and has a clear ring, like metal or glass--according to
the species--that is struck, besides being broken by more or less
regular pauses. They are still kept as pets in many countries; the
Chinese, for instance, match them for money against each other, the
Japanese cult of them has been described by Hearn, and the festival
of the crickets on Ascension Day at Florence is known to all
visitors. There is an enigmatical couplet by Simonides about the
cicada's contest in Athenaeus, who, after saying that it gives
trouble to those not conversant with history, proceeds to explain
it. The same verse figures twice in Didot, who supplies a note.</p>

<p>A cicada, according to Leonidas, was figured on the spear of
Athene. In an epigram by Theodoridas the lad Charixenos dedicates
to the Nymphs his childish locks together with a pretty hair-pin
shaped like a cicada--the old Athenians, before the Persian War,
wore golden cicadas in their bonnets--and two other poems tell how
a cicada of brass was offered to Apollo by the winner in a
lyre-playing contest, because such a creature happened to alight on
his instrument at the moment when one of ths strings snapped, and,
miraculously carrying on with its tender voice the interrupted
note--rather a miraculous affair altogether--enabled him to win the
prize. Here is Paul's version of this incident in the shape of an
English sonnet--</p>

<pre>
Hear me my match with Parthes now repeat!
Lo! scarce my Locrian strain began to ring,
When, 'neath the plectrum, jangling, snapped a string,
And my sure triumph menaced a defeat;

Yet ere the wanting notes failed incomplete
I on the bridge saw a cicada spring,
Who, with the other chords alternating,
Added his rustic voice in measured beat.

To thee, Apollo, blest Latona's son,
I, Locrian Eunomos, this offering made
In memory of the victory I won;
And that my debt to him be also paid,
See on my lyre in bronze the singer done,
Who brought me at my need such tuneful aid.
</pre>

<p>Another two poems speak of a certain hunter to whom no game came
amiss, and who was punished for catching a cicada with birdlime by
having bad luck for the rest of his life. Boys are sternly
admonished for the same offense, and an inconsiderate swallow which
had captured a cicada as food for its young--a thing no swallow in
its senses would dream of doing, though several ancient writers
accuse it of this crime (Plutarch writes the same of a sparrow,
which is more probable)--is bidden to let it drop again, since it
is not right for one songster to prey on another. There is also a
lament for a cicada which has entangled itself in a spider's web.
Now this may be a strain on the imagination of any one who has e
xperienced the bullet-like impact of a flying cicada in his face,
but some of these southern spiders' webs are of such a texture that
a friend of mine rescued not a cicada, but a titmouse, out of their
tough and sticky strands. One modern author, whose name I have
forgotten to note, speaks of a lizard held fast by a spider's
web.</p>

<p>In short, the cicada has this in common with the dolphin that
both creatures are supposed to be endowed with sentiments towards
humanity of the same nature as those which humanity cherished for
them. There was a link of affection between the two. Men loved the
cicada; what more reasonable than that it should requite the
feeling? They loved it; and they ate it. Aristotle says that early
in the season the males are the most savoury; afterwards, the
females; and that the larva of the cicada tastes best before it has
burst its covering. A disgusting banqviet...Suggestive are the
epitaphs on these little favourites. We read of a pet cricket
buried in a coffin of clay; another, after being kept tame for two
years, has a small monument erected over its grave. Archias writes
a lament about a cricket which was devoured by ants; Anyte tells of
a beloved cricket and cicada which were interred in the same
tomb--</p>

<pre>
For her cicada, who the oaks clung near,
And the fields' nightingale, her cricket, here
   One common grave
   Maid Myrto gave.
And with young girlish tears her
eyes grew dim,
When both her pets were snatched by Hades grim.
</pre>

<p>Such verses are by writers of standing, writers like Leonidas of
Tarentum, who has an individual note and never says anything which
another poet could have expressed more happily. They betray both
intensity and diversity of feeling, and are no more to be regarded
as rhetorical exercises than our own epitaphs on pet dogs or birds,
heartfelt to the verge of absurdity as some of them are. Even
supposing them to be such, even supposing them to be artificial, it
would not alter the fact that we are confronted by a change in
literary taste. For rhetoric must approximate to reality, even as
imagination must have its roots in fact. Rhetoric serves as a
sign-post to true sentiment; it corresponds to some underlying
state of mind and dare not express; what is palpably incongruous or
inept.</p>

<p>Here, for example, among the rest of such epitaphs, is a
significant one by no mean poet--on what? On an ant. Who would
compose such an inscrip-tion nowadays? The proceeding would
overstep that limit of quaintness which is a legitimate and often
delectable ingredient in lyric poetry. It would verge on the inane;
I think we should fail to see the point. Antipater of Sidon's
farewell verses to an ant prove that his readers must have seen
some point. A good many of them, and a good many of us moderns,
might be glad to be commemorated after life in so worthy a fashion
as this minute' insect, which may have been crushed to death by the
poet's foot while busily carrying away the grains of corn from some
threshing area--</p>

<pre>
Here by this threshing floor, ant of much toil,
A mound I build thee of the thirsty soil,
That even in death Demeter's furrowed grain
May cheer thee in the glebe where housed thou'rt lain.
(Should perhaps be <i>laid</i>; but what does it matter?)
</pre>

<p>These Anthology people, like most of us, were bothered by flies;
they used fly-traps and kept special slaves to drive away the
nuisance, as do the sensible Orientals of to-day. Nicarchus tells
of that uncommonly lean person Menestratus that he was carried off
by a fly after the fashion of Ganymede and his eagle; Lucilius
makes a mosquito do the same with a child called Erotion, A
dog-fly, <i>kynomyia</i>, is also named; Lucilius (n, 265) mentions
it, and an anonymous couplet in the Planudean Appendix (9) alludes
to its pestering habits. There is mention of the gadfly,
<i>myops</i>, in one of the many epigrams (9, 739) on Myron's
bronze statue of a heifer, which was so wonderfully true to nature
that even herdsmen mistook it for a live one--</p>

<pre>
Myron duped thee, gadfly, that thou dost thrust
Thy sting against his heifer's brazen crust.
No fault the gadfly's, that! Since Myron knew
How to deceive the eyes of herdsmen too.
</pre>

<p>None of these poets seem to make a distinction between a gnat
and a mosquito, <i>konops</i>--none save Palladas (10, 49) who
refers to the belief that "even ants and gnats (<i>serphos</i>)
have bile". Yet the mosquitoes which Dionysius (12, 108) describes
as buzzing about the vinegar jar must have been either gnats or
else the little <i>Drosophila ampelophila</i> whose name testifies
to its bibulous habits, and which drowns itself with gusto in
whatever vinegar or wine--or whisky and soda--is left uncovered.
Meleager addresses the mosquito in some of his best lines about
Zenophila (5, 151 and 152). We have also three epigrams (9,
764-766) anent the blessings of mosquito nets that permit sound
slumber; they are of a late period (Paulus and Agathias); here is
one of the former's--</p>

<pre>
Not net of Artemis am I. I screen
Fair bridal beds for the soft Paphian Queen.
Covered by my webbed mesh the sleepers feel
Still the life-giving breezes o'er them steal.
</pre>

<p><i>A propos</i> of mosquitoes--hints of malaria are scattered
about the Anthology, as about many other old writings. The
following are what I have noted: Antipater of Sidon speaks of it as
coming in waves (6, 291), and this poet himself, according to
Pliny, was subject to recurrent attacks of fever that began every
year on his birthday. Ammianus (11, 13) tells of sick men who die
from being roasted (by fevers); Agathias (it, 382) mentions the
disease in some heavily jocular lines about a doctor; the physician
Praxagoras is praised (App. Plan. 273) for his skill in dealing
with fevers, and the next epigram deals with Oribasius, another and
more famous doctor, some of whose writings on malaria are still
extant (a second mention of Oribasius in 9, 199). Palladas reads
malarious or at least atrobilious at times, and in one of his
verses (9, 503) talks of administering a certain kind of fruit (?)
to a patient suffering from a quartan--</p>

<pre>
I was not wrong when I the virtue cried
Divine of jujubes. For late I applied
One to a man with quartan ague sick,
And straight was he as fit as a dog-tick.
</pre>

<p>The gay Lucilius also talks of fever in a quatrain on
Pantaenetus (11, 311), and Callicter, who can squeeze as much fun
into a couplet as most of them, has one (11, 118) after this
fashion: "Feeling slightly feverish, I happened to remember the
name of Doctor Pheidon; and straightway died". In Didot III (2,
588) is an eight-line epitaph on a boy of thirteen called Cladus
who died of fever, and whose tomb, adorned with a bust of him, was
erected by Apphia his nurse.</p>

<p>Then comes the tick, <i>kroton</i>, whose healthiness is noted
in the above lines by Palladas. There is a play on words here, the
town of Kroton, the modern Cotrone, being also famous for a good
climate and its inhabitants a proverbially healthy race. That was
because, long ago, one of them told the oracle at Delphi that he
preferred health to riches, whereas his companion from Syracuse was
in favour of riches; both got what they wanted.</p>

<p>We have also two references to fleas, one by Lucian (i i, 432)
about a man who, tortured by fleas at night, puts out the lamp,
saying "Now you cannot see me any more". It will go into an English
limerick, a verse-form that would have appealed to Lucian--</p>

<pre>
A philosopher called Stesichore
Was bitten by fleas till he swore.
So he put out the light,
And said: "Now you won't bite,
Because you can't see me no more".
</pre>

<p>Lice of one kind or another are named more frequently in the
Anthology; they seem, indeed, to have been something of a plague in
antiquity, and to have caused the death of several eminent
men--Alcman, Pherecides, Sulla and others. Ammianus (ii, 156) tells
a sophist to shave his beard, since it generates not wisdom but
lice--</p>

<pre>
Thou think'st that beard of thine brains can create,
And so that fly-flapper dost cultivate.
Shave it off quick, dear maa, is my advice;
A beard like that creates not brains, but lice.
</pre>

<p>There are also a couple of riddles about lice, one being the
venerable conundrum of Homer: "Hunters of Arcadia (or of deep sea
prey), have we caught anything?" To which they reply: "All that we
caught we left behind, and all that we did no't catch we carry
home"--namely, lice.</p>

<p>As to bugs, Antiphanes (n, 322) likens the grammarians to a race
of bugs that with their criticisms secretly bite good writers, and
Parmenio (9, 113) has a punning epigram on this beast which a
translator would be puzzled to render into English verse. Here is
Mr. Paton's version in the Loeb Anthology--</p>

<p>The bugs fed on me with gusto till they were disgusted, but I
myself laboured till I was disgusted, dislodging the bugs.</p>

<p>Unlike the bear, the bug has not yet been driven out of the
Peloponnese--a region which is apt to <i>pue-la-punaise</i>, as
some Frenchman may have said: far from it. If they had only left
the bear, and driven out the bug! It also takes us back once more
into the category of domestic animals; never with greater regret.
