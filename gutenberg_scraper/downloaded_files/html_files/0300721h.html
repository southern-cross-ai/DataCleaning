<h2>TO THE READER</h2>
<p>This is a first book, and in it the author has written of
experience which is now far and lost, but which was once part of
the fabric of his life. If any reader, therefore, should say that
the book is "autobiographical" the writer has no answer for him:
it seems to him that all serious work in fiction is
autobiographical&mdash;that, for instance, a more
autobiographical work than "Gulliver's Travels" cannot easily be
imagined.</p>
<p>This note, however, is addressed principally to those persons
whom the writer may have known in the period covered by these
pages. To these persons, he would say what he believes they
understand already: that this book was written in innocence and
nakedness of spirit, and that the writer's main concern was to
give fulness, life, and intensity to the actions and people in
the book he was creating. Now that it is to be published, he
would insist that this book is a fiction, and that he meditated
no man's portrait here.</p>
<p>But we are the sum of all the moments of our lives&mdash;all
that is ours is in them: we cannot escape or conceal it. If the
writer has used the clay of life to make his book, he has only
used what all men must, what none can keep from using. Fiction is
not fact, but fiction is fact selected and understood, fiction is
fact arranged and charged with purpose. Dr. Johnson remarked that
a man would turn over half a library to make a single book: in
the same way, a novelist may turn over half the people in a town
to make a single figure in his novel. This is not the whole
method but the writer believes it illustrates the whole method in
a book that is written from a middle distance and is without
rancour or bitter intention.</p>
<h2>PART ONE</h2>
<p>...a stone, a leaf, an unfound door; of a stone, a leaf, a
door. And of all the forgotten faces.</p>
<p>Naked and alone we came into exile. In her dark womb we did
not know our mother's face; from the prison of her flesh have we
come into the unspeakable and incommunicable prison of this
earth.</p>
<p>Which of us has known his brother? Which of us has looked into
his father's heart? Which of us has not remained forever
prison-pent? Which of us is not forever a stranger and alone?</p>
<p>O waste of loss, in the hot mazes, lost, among bright stars on
this most weary unbright cinder, lost! Remembering speechlessly
we seek the great forgotten language, the lost lane-end into
heaven, a stone, a leaf, an unfound door. Where? When?</p>
<p>O lost, and by the wind grieved, ghost, come back again.</p>
<h3>1</h3>
<p>A destiny that leads the English to the Dutch is strange
enough; but one that leads from Epsom into Pennsylvania, and
thence into the hills that shut in Altamont over the proud coral
cry of the cock, and the soft stone smile of an angel, is touched
by that dark miracle of chance which makes new magic in a dusty
world.</p>
<p>Each of us is all the sums he has not counted: subtract us
into nakedness and night again, and you shall see begin in Crete
four thousand years ago the love that ended yesterday in
Texas.</p>
<p>The seed of our destruction will blossom in the desert, the
alexin of our cure grows by a mountain rock, and our lives are
haunted by a Georgia slattern, because a London cut-purse went
unhung. Each moment is the fruit of forty thousand years. The
minute-winning days, like flies, buzz home to death, and every
moment is a window on all time.</p>
<p>This is a moment:</p>
<p>An Englishman named Gilbert Gaunt, which he later changed to
Gant (a concession probably to Yankee phonetics), having come to
Baltimore from Bristol in 1837 on a sailing vessel, soon let the
profits of a public house which he had purchased roll down his
improvident gullet. He wandered westward into Pennsylvania, eking
out a dangerous living by matching fighting cocks against the
champions of country barnyards, and often escaping after a night
spent in a village jail, with his champion dead on the field of
battle, without the clink of a coin in his pocket, and sometimes
with the print of a farmer's big knuckles on his reckless face.
But he always escaped, and coming at length among the Dutch at
harvest time he was so touched by the plenty of their land that
he cast out his anchors there. Within a year he married a rugged
young widow with a tidy farm who like all the other Dutch had
been charmed by his air of travel, and his grandiose speech,
particularly when he did Hamlet in the manner of the great Edmund
Kean. Every one said he should have been an actor.</p>
<p>The Englishman begot children&mdash;a daughter and four
sons&mdash;lived easily and carelessly, and bore patiently the
weight of his wife's harsh but honest tongue. The years passed,
his bright somewhat staring eyes grew dull and bagged, the tall
Englishman walked with a gouty shuffle: one morning when she came
to nag him out of sleep she found him dead of an apoplexy. He
left five children, a mortgage and&mdash;in his strange dark eyes
which now stared bright and open&mdash;something that had not
died: a passionate and obscure hunger for voyages.</p>
<p>So, with this legacy, we leave this Englishman and are
concerned hereafter with the heir to whom he bequeathed it, his
second son, a boy named Oliver. How this boy stood by the
roadside near his mother's farm, and saw the dusty Rebels march
past on their way to Gettysburg, how his cold eyes darkened when
he heard the great name of Virginia, and how the year the war had
ended, when he was still fifteen, he had walked along a street in
Baltimore, and seen within a little shop smooth granite slabs of
death, carved lambs and cherubim, and an angel poised upon cold
phthisic feet, with a smile of soft stone idiocy&mdash;this is a
longer tale. But I know that his cold and shallow eyes had
darkened with the obscure and passionate hunger that had lived in
a dead man's eyes, and that had led from Fenchurch Street past
Philadelphia. As the boy looked at the big angel with the carved
stipe of lilystalk, a cold and nameless excitement possessed him.
The long fingers of his big hands closed. He felt that he wanted,
more than anything in the world, to carve delicately with a
chisel. He wanted to wreak something dark and unspeakable in him
into cold stone. He wanted to carve an angel's head.</p>
<p>Oliver entered the shop and asked a big bearded man with a
wooden mallet for a job. He became the stone cutter's apprentice.
He worked in that dusty yard five years. He became a stone
cutter. When his apprenticeship was over he had become a man.</p>
<p>He never found it. He never learned to carve an angel's head.
The dove, the lamb, the smooth joined marble hands of death, and
letters fair and fine&mdash;but not the angel. And of all the
years of waste and loss&mdash;the riotous years in Baltimore, of
work and savage drunkenness, and the theatre of Booth and
Salvini, which had a disastrous effect upon the stone cutter, who
memorized each accent of the noble rant, and strode muttering
through the streets, with rapid gestures of the enormous talking
hands&mdash;these are blind steps and gropings of our exile, the
painting of our hunger as, remembering speechlessly, we seek the
great forgotten language, the lost lane-end into heaven, a stone,
a leaf, a door. Where? When?</p>
<p>He never found it, and he reeled down across the continent
into the Reconstruction South&mdash;a strange wild form of six
feet four with cold uneasy eyes, a great blade of nose, and a
rolling tide of rhetoric, a preposterous and comic invective, as
formalized as classical epithet, which he used seriously, but
with a faint uneasy grin around the corners of his thin wailing
mouth.</p>
<p>He set up business in Sydney, the little capital city of one
of the middle Southern states, lived soberly and industriously
under the attentive eye of a folk still raw with defeat and
hostility, and finally, his good name founded and admission won,
he married a gaunt tubercular spinstress, ten years his elder,
but with a nest egg and an unshakable will to matrimony. Within
eighteen months he was a howling maniac again, his little
business went smash while his foot stayed on the polished rail,
and Cynthia, his wife&mdash;whose life, the natives said, he had
not helped to prolong&mdash;died suddenly one night after a
hemorrhage.</p>
<p>So, all was gone again&mdash;Cynthia, the shop, the
hard-bought praise of soberness, the angel's head&mdash;he walked
through the streets at dark, yelling his pentameter curse at
Rebel ways, and all their indolence; but sick with fear and loss
and penitence, he wilted under the town's reproving stare,
becoming convinced, as the flesh wasted on his own gaunt frame,
that Cynthia's scourge was doing vengeance now on him.</p>
<p>He was only past thirty, but he looked much older. His face
was yellow and sunken; the waxen blade of his nose looked like a
beak. He had long brown mustaches that hung straight down
mournfully.</p>
<p>His tremendous bouts of drinking had wrecked his health. He
was thin as a rail and had a cough. He thought of Cynthia now, in
the lonely and hostile town, and he became afraid. He thought he
had tuberculosis and that he was going to die.</p>
<p>So, alone and lost again, having found neither order nor
establishment in the world, and with the earth cut away from his
feet, Oliver resumed his aimless drift along the continent. He
turned westward toward the great fortress of the hills, knowing
that behind them his evil fame would not be known, and hoping
that he might find in them isolation, a new life, and recovered
health.</p>
<p>The eyes of the gaunt spectre darkened again, as they had in
his youth.</p>
<p>All day, under a wet gray sky of October, Oliver rode westward
across the mighty state. As he stared mournfully out the window
at the great raw land so sparsely tilled by the futile and
occasional little farms, which seemed to have made only little
grubbing patches in the wilderness, his heart went cold and
leaden in him. He thought of the great barns of Pennsylvania, the
ripe bending of golden grain, the plenty, the order, the clean
thrift of the people. And he thought of how he had set out to get
order and position for himself, and of the rioting confusion of
his life, the blot and blur of years, and the red waste of his
youth.</p>
<p>By God! he thought. I'm getting old! Why here?</p>
<p>The grisly parade of the spectre years trooped through his
brain. Suddenly, he saw that his life had been channelled by a
series of accidents: a mad Rebel singing of Armageddon, the sound
of a bugle on the road, the mule-hoofs of the army, the silly
white face of an angel in a dusty shop, a slut's pert wiggle of
her hams as she passed by. He had reeled out of warmth and plenty
into this barren land: as he stared out the window and saw the
fallow unworked earth, the great raw lift of the Piedmont, the
muddy red clay roads, and the slattern people gaping at the
stations&mdash;a lean farmer gangling above his reins, a dawdling
negro, a gap-toothed yokel, a hard sallow woman with a grimy
baby&mdash;the strangeness of destiny stabbed him with fear. How
came he here from the clean Dutch thrift of his youth into this
vast lost earth of rickets?</p>
<p>The train rattled on over the reeking earth. Rain fell
steadily. A brakeman came draftily into the dirty plush coach and
emptied a scuttle of coal into the big stove at the end. High
empty laughter shook a group of yokels sprawled on two turned
seats. The bell tolled mournfully above the clacking wheels.
There was a droning interminable wait at a junction-town near the
foot-hills. Then the train moved on again across the vast rolling
earth.</p>
<p>Dusk came. The huge bulk of the hills was foggily emergent.
Small smoky lights went up in the hillside shacks. The train
crawled dizzily across high trestles spanning ghostly hawsers of
water. Far up, far down, plumed with wisps of smoke, toy cabins
stuck to bank and gulch and hillside. The train toiled sinuously
up among gouged red cuts with slow labor. As darkness came,
Oliver descended at the little town of Old Stockade where the
rails ended. The last great wall of the hills lay stark above
him. As he left the dreary little station and stared into the
greasy lamplight of a country store, Oliver felt that he was
crawling, like a great beast, into the circle of those enormous
hills to die.</p>
<p>The next morning he resumed his journey by coach. His
destination was the little town of Altamont, twenty-four miles
away beyond the rim of the great outer wall of the hills. As the
horses strained slowly up the mountain road Oliver's spirit
lifted a little. It was a gray-golden day in late October, bright
and windy. There was a sharp bite and sparkle in the mountain
air: the range soared above him, close, immense, clean, and
barren. The trees rose gaunt and stark: they were almost
leafless. The sky was full of windy white rags of cloud; a thick
blade of mist washed slowly around the rampart of a mountain.</p>
<p>Below him a mountain stream foamed down its rocky bed, and he
could see little dots of men laying the track that would coil
across the hill toward Altamont. Then the sweating team lipped
the gulch of the mountain, and, among soaring and lordly ranges
that melted away in purple mist, they began the slow descent
toward the high plateau on which the town of Altamont was
built.</p>
<p>In the haunting eternity of these mountains, rimmed in their
enormous cup, he found sprawled out on its hundred hills and
hollows a town of four thousand people.</p>
<p>There were new lands. His heart lifted.</p>
<p>This town of Altamont had been settled soon after the
Revolutionary War. It had been a convenient stopping-off place
for cattledrovers and farmers in their swing eastward from
Tennessee into South Carolina. And, for several decades before
the Civil War, it had enjoyed the summer patronage of fashionable
people from Charleston and the plantations of the hot South. When
Oliver first came to it it had begun to get some reputation not
only as a summer resort, but as a sanitarium for tuberculars.
Several rich men from the North had established hunting lodges in
the hills, and one of them had bought huge areas of mountain land
and, with an army of imported architects, carpenters and masons,
was planning the greatest country estate in
America&mdash;something in limestone, with pitched slate roofs,
and one hundred and eighty-three rooms. It was modelled on the
chateau at Blois. There was also a vast new hotel, a sumptuous
wooden barn, rambling comfortably upon the summit of a commanding
hill.</p>
<p>But most of the population was still native, recruited from
the hill and country people in the surrounding districts. They
were Scotch-Irish mountaineers, rugged, provincial, intelligent,
and industrious.</p>
<p>Oliver had about twelve hundred dollars saved from the
wreckage of Cynthia's estate. During the winter he rented a
little shack at one edge of the town's public square, acquired a
small stock of marbles, and set up business. But he had little to
do at first save to think of the prospect of his death. During
the bitter and lonely winter, while he thought he was dying, the
gaunt scarecrow Yankee that flapped muttering through the streets
became an object of familiar gossip to the townspeople. All the
people at his boarding-house knew that at night he walked his
room with great caged strides, and that a long low moan that
seemed wrung from his bowels quivered incessantly on his thin
lips. But he spoke to no one about it.</p>
<p>And then the marvellous hill Spring came, green-golden, with
brief spurting winds, the magic and fragrance of the blossoms,
warm gusts of balsam. The great wound in Oliver began to heal.
His voice was heard in the land once more, there were purple
flashes of the old rhetoric, the ghost of the old eagerness.</p>
<p>One day in April, as with fresh awakened senses, he stood
before his shop, watching the flurry of life in the square,
Oliver heard behind him the voice of a man who was passing. And
that voice, flat, drawling, complacent, touched with sudden light
a picture that had lain dead in him for twenty years.</p>
<p>"Hit's a comin'! Accordin' to my figgers hit's due June 11,
1886."</p>
<p>Oliver turned and saw retreating the burly persuasive figure
of the prophet he had last seen vanishing down the dusty road
that led to Gettysburg and Armageddon.</p>
<p>"Who is that?" he asked a man.</p>
<p>The man looked and grinned.</p>
<p>"That's Bacchus Pentland," he said. "He's quite a character.
There are a lot of his folks around here."</p>
<p>Oliver wet his great thumb briefly. Then, with a grin, he
said:</p>
<p>"Has Armageddon come yet?"</p>
<p>"He's expecting it any day now," said the man.</p>
<p>Then Oliver met Eliza. He lay one afternoon in Spring upon the
smooth leather sofa of his little office, listening to the bright
piping noises in the Square. A restoring peace brooded over his
great extended body. He thought of the loamy black earth with its
sudden young light of flowers, of the beaded chill of beer, and
of the plumtree's dropping blossoms. Then he heard the brisk
heel- taps of a woman coming down among the marbles, and he got
hastily to his feet. He was drawing on his well brushed coat of
heavy black just as she entered.</p>
<p>"I tell you what," said Eliza, pursing her lips in reproachful
banter, "I wish I was a man and had nothing to do but lie around
all day on a good easy sofa."</p>
<p>"Good afternoon, madam," said Oliver with a flourishing bow.
"Yes," he said, as a faint sly grin bent the corners of his thin
mouth, "I reckon you've caught me taking my constitutional. As a
matter of fact I very rarely lie down in the daytime, but I've
been in bad health for the last year now, and I'm not able to do
the work I used to."</p>
<p>He was silent a moment; his face drooped in an expression of
hangdog dejection. "Ah, Lord! I don't know what's to become of
me!"</p>
<p>"Pshaw!" said Eliza briskly and contemptuously. "There's
nothing wrong with you in my opinion. You're a big strapping
fellow, in the prime of life. Half of it's only imagination. Most
of the time we think we're sick it's all in the mind. I remember
three years ago I was teaching school in Hominy Township when I
was taken down with pneumonia. Nobody ever expected to see me
come out of it alive but I got through it somehow; I well
remember one day I was sitting down&mdash;as the fellow says, I
reckon I was convalescin'; the reason I remember is Old Doctor
Fletcher had just been and when he went out I saw him shake his
head at my cousin Sally. 'Why Eliza, what on earth,' she said,
just as soon as he had gone, 'he tells me you're spitting up
blood every time you cough; you've got consumption as sure as you
live.' 'Pshaw,' I said. I remember I laughed just as big as you
please, determined to make a big joke of it all; I just thought
to myself, I'm not going to give into it, I'll fool them all yet;
'I don't believe a word of it' (I said)," she nodded her head
smartly at him, and pursed her lips, "'and besides, Sally' (I
said) 'we've all got to go some time, and there's no use worrying
about what's going to happen. It may come tomorrow, or it may
come later, but it's bound to come to all in the end'."</p>
<p>"Ah Lord!" said Oliver, shaking his head sadly. "You bit the
nail on the head that time. A truer word was never spoken."</p>
<p>Merciful God! he thought, with an anguished inner grin. How
long is this to keep up? But she's a pippin as sure as you're
born. He looked appreciatively at her trim erect figure, noting
her milky white skin, her black-brown eyes, with their quaint
child's stare, and her jet black hair drawn back tightly from her
high white forehead. She had a curious trick of pursing her lips
reflectively before she spoke; she liked to take her time, and
came to the point after interminable divagations down all the
lane-ends of memory and overtone, feasting upon the golden
pageant of all she had ever said, done, felt, thought, seen, or
replied, with egocentric delight. Then, while he looked, she
ceased speaking abruptly, put her neat gloved hand to her chin,
and stared off with a thoughtful pursed mouth.</p>
<p>"Well," she said after a moment, "if you're getting your
health back and spend a good part of your time lying around you
ought to have something to occupy your mind." She opened a
leather portmanteau she was carrying and produced a visiting card
and two fat volumes. "My name," she said portentously, with slow
emphasis, "is Eliza Pentland, and I represent the Larkin
Publishing Company."</p>
<p>She spoke the words proudly, with dignified gusto. Merciful
God! A book agent! thought Gant.</p>
<p>"We are offering," said Eliza, opening a huge yellow book with
a fancy design of spears and flags and laurel wreaths, "a book of
poems called Gems of Verse for Hearth and Fireside as well as
Larkin's Domestic Doctor and Book of Household Remedies, giving
directions for the cure and prevention of over five hundred
diseases."</p>
<p>"Well," said Gant, with a faint grin, wetting his big thumb
briefly, "I ought to find one that I've got out of that."</p>
<p>"Why, yes," said Eliza, nodding smartly, "as the fellow says,
you can read poetry for the good of your soul and Larkin for the
good of your body."</p>
<p>"I like poetry," said Gant, thumbing over the pages, and
pausing with interest at the section marked Songs of the Spur and
Sabre. "In my boyhood I could recite it by the hour."</p>
<p>He bought the books. Eliza packed her samples, and stood up
looking sharply and curiously about the dusty little shop.</p>
<p>"Doing any business?" she said.</p>
<p>"Very little," said Oliver sadly. "Hardly enough to keep body
and soul together. I'm a stranger in a strange land."</p>
<p>"Pshaw!" said Eliza cheerfully. "You ought to get out and meet
more people. You need something to take your mind off yourself.
If I were you, I'd pitch right in and take an interest in the
town's progress. We've got everything here it takes to make a big
town&mdash;scenery, climate, and natural resources, and we all
ought to work together. If I had a few thousand dollars I know
what I'd do,"&mdash;she winked smartly at him, and began to speak
with a curiously masculine gesture of the hand&mdash;forefinger
extended, fist loosely clenched. "Do you see this corner
here&mdash;the one you're on? It'll double in value in the next
few years. Now, here!" she gestured before her with the loose
masculine gesture. "They're going to run a street through there
some day as sure as you live. And when they do&mdash;" she pursed
her lips reflectively, "that property is going to be worth
money."</p>
<p>She continued to talk about property with a strange meditative
hunger. The town seemed to be an enormous blueprint to her: her
head was stuffed uncannily with figures and estimates&mdash;who
owned a lot, who sold it, the sale-price, the real value, the
future value, first and second mortgages, and so on. When she had
finished, Oliver said with the emphasis of strong aversion,
thinking of Sydney:</p>
<p>"I hope I never own another piece of property as long as I
live&mdash;save a house to live in. It is nothing but a curse and
a care, and the tax-collector gets it all in the end."</p>
<p>Eliza looked at him with a startled expression, as if he had
uttered a damnable heresy.</p>
<p>"Why, say! That's no way to talk!" she said. "You want to lay
something by for a rainy day, don't you?"</p>
<p>"I'm having my rainy day now," he said gloomily. "All the
property I need is eight feet of earth to be buried in."</p>
<p>Then, talking more cheerfully, he walked with her to the door
of the shop, and watched her as she marched primly away across
the square, holding her skirts at the curbs with ladylike nicety.
Then he turned back among his marbles again with a stirring in
him of a joy he thought he had lost forever.</p>
<p>The Pentland family, of which Eliza was a member, was one of
the strangest tribes that ever came out of the hills. It had no
clear title to the name of Pentland: a Scotch-Englishman of that
name, who was a mining engineer, the grandfather of the present
head of the family, had come into the hills after the Revolution,
looking for copper, and lived there for several years, begetting
several children by one of the pioneer women. When he disappeared
the woman took for herself and her children the name of
Pentland.</p>
<p>The present chieftain of the tribe was Eliza's father, the
brother of the prophet Bacchus, Major Thomas Pentland. Another
brother had been killed during the Seven Days. Major Pentland's
military title was honestly if inconspicuously earned. While
Bacchus, who never rose above the rank of Corporal, was
blistering his hard hands at Shiloh, the Major, as commander of
two companies of Home Volunteers, was guarding the stronghold of
the native hills. This stronghold was never threatened until the
closing days of the war, when the Volunteers, ambuscaded behind
convenient trees and rocks, fired three volleys into a detachment
of Sherman's stragglers, and quietly dispersed to the defense of
their attendant wives and children.</p>
<p>The Pentland family was as old as any in the community, but it
had always been poor, and had made few pretenses to gentility. By
marriage, and by intermarriage among its own kinsmen, it could
boast of some connection with the great, of some insanity, and a
modicum of idiocy. But because of its obvious superiority, in
intelligence and fibre, to most of the mountain people it held a
position of solid respect among them.</p>
<p>The Pentlands bore a strong clan-marking. Like most rich
personalities in strange families their powerful group-stamp
became more impressive because of their differences. They had
broad powerful noses, with fleshy deeply scalloped wings, sensual
mouths, extraordinarily mixed of delicacy and coarseness, which
in the process of thinking they convolved with astonishing
flexibility, broad intelligent foreheads, and deep flat cheeks, a
trifle hollowed. The men were generally ruddy of face, and their
typical stature was meaty, strong, and of middling height,
although it varied into gangling cadaverousness.</p>
<p>Major Thomas Pentland was the father of a numerous family of
which Eliza was the only surviving girl. A younger sister had
died a few years before of a disease which the family identified
sorrowfully as "poor Jane's scrofula." There were six boys:
Henry, the oldest, was now thirty, Will was twenty-six, Jim was
twenty-two, and Thaddeus, Elmer and Greeley were, in the order
named, eighteen, fifteen, and eleven. Eliza was twenty-four.</p>
<p>The four oldest children, Henry, Will, Eliza, and Jim, had
passed their childhood in the years following the war. The
poverty and privation of these years had been so terrible that
none of them ever spoke of it now, but the bitter steel had
sheared into their hearts, leaving scars that would not heal.</p>
<p>The effect of these years upon the oldest children was to
develop in them an insane niggardliness, an insatiate love of
property, and a desire to escape from the Major's household as
quickly as possible.</p>
<p>"Father," Eliza had said with ladylike dignity, as she led
Oliver for the first time into the sitting-room of the cottage,
"I want you to meet Mr. Gant."</p>
<p>Major Pentland rose slowly from his rocker by the fire, folded
a large knife, and put the apple he had been peeling on the
mantel. Bacchus looked up benevolently from a whittled stick, and
Will, glancing up from his stubby nails which he was paring as
usual, greeted the visitor with a birdlike nod and wink. The men
amused themselves constantly with pocket knives.</p>
<p>Major Pentland advanced slowly toward Gant. He was a stocky
fleshy man in the middle fifties, with a ruddy face, a
patriarchal beard, and the thick complacent features of his
tribe.</p>
<p>"It's W. O. Gant, isn't it?" he asked in a drawling unctuous
voice.</p>
<p>"Yes," said Oliver, "that's right."</p>
<p>"From what Eliza's been telling me about you," said the Major,
giving the signal to his audience, "I was going to say it ought
to be L. E. Gant."</p>
<p>The room sounded with the fat pleased laughter of the
Pentlands.</p>
<p>"Whew!" cried Eliza, putting her hand to the wing of her broad
nose. "I'll vow, father! You ought to be ashamed of
yourself."</p>
<p>Gant grinned with a thin false painting of mirth.</p>
<p>The miserable old scoundrel, he thought. He's had that one
bottled up for a week.</p>
<p>"You've met Will before," said Eliza.</p>
<p>"Both before and aft," said Will with a smart wink.</p>
<p>When their laughter had died down, Eliza said: "And
this&mdash;as the fellow says&mdash;is Uncle Bacchus."</p>
<p>"Yes, sir," said Bacchus beaming, "as large as life an' twice
as sassy."</p>
<p>"They call him Back-us everywhere else," said Will, including
them all in a brisk wink, "but here in the family we call him
Behind- us."</p>
<p>"I suppose," said Major Pentland deliberately, "that you've
served on a great many juries?"</p>
<p>"No," said Oliver, determined to endure the worst now with a
frozen grin. "Why?"</p>
<p>"Because," said the Major looking around again, "I thought you
were a fellow who'd done a lot of COURTIN'."</p>
<p>Then, amid their laughter, the door opened, and several of the
others came in&mdash;Eliza's mother, a plain worn Scotchwoman,
and Jim, a ruddy porcine young fellow, his father's beardless
twin, and Thaddeus, mild, ruddy, brown of hair and eye, bovine,
and finally Greeley, the youngest, a boy with lapping idiot
grins, full of strange squealing noises at which they laughed. He
was eleven, degenerate, weak, scrofulous, but his white moist
hands could draw from a violin music that had in it something
unearthly and untaught.</p>
<p>And as they sat there in the hot little room with its warm
odor of mellowing apples, the vast winds howled down from the
hills, there was a roaring in the pines, remote and demented, the
bare boughs clashed. And as they peeled, or pared, or whittled,
their talk slid from its rude jocularity to death and burial:
they drawled monotonously, with evil hunger, their gossip of
destiny, and of men but newly lain in the earth. And as their
talk wore on, and Gant heard the spectre moan of the wind, he was
entombed in loss and darkness, and his soul plunged downward in
the pit of night, for he saw that he must die a
stranger&mdash;that all, all but these triumphant Pentlands, who
banqueted on death&mdash;must die.</p>
<p>And like a man who is perishing in the polar night, he thought
of the rich meadows of his youth: the corn, the plum tree, and
ripe grain. Why here? O lost!</p>
<h3>2</h3>
<p>Oliver married Eliza in May. After their wedding trip to
Philadelphia, they returned to the house he had built for her on
Woodson Street. With his great hands he had laid the foundations,
burrowed out deep musty cellars in the earth, and sheeted the
tall sides over with smooth trowellings of warm brown plaster. He
had very little money, but his strange house grew to the rich
modelling of his fantasy: when he had finished he had something
which leaned to the slope of his narrow uphill yard, something
with a high embracing porch in front, and warm rooms where one
stepped up and down to the tackings of his whim. He built his
house close to the quiet hilly street; he bedded the loamy soil
with flowers; he laid the short walk to the high veranda steps
with great square sheets of colored marble; he put a fence of
spiked iron between his house and the world.</p>
<p>Then, in the cool long glade of yard that stretched four
hundred feet behind the house he planted trees and grape vines.
And whatever he touched in that rich fortress of his soul sprang
into golden life: as the years passed, the fruit trees&mdash;the
peach, the plum, the cherry, the apple&mdash;grew great and bent
beneath their clusters. His grape vines thickened into brawny
ropes of brown and coiled down the high wire fences of his lot,
and hung in a dense fabric, upon his trellises, roping his domain
twice around. They climbed the porch end of the house and framed
the upper windows in thick bowers. And the flowers grew in
rioting glory in his yard&mdash;the velvet-leaved nasturtium,
slashed with a hundred tawny dyes, the rose, the snowball, the
redcupped tulip, and the lily. The honeysuckle drooped its heavy
mass upon the fence; wherever his great hands touched the earth
it grew fruitful for him.</p>
<p>For him the house was the picture of his soul, the garment of
his will. But for Eliza it was a piece of property, whose value
she shrewdly appraised, a beginning for her hoard. Like all the
older children of Major Pentland she had, since her twentieth
year, begun the slow accretion of land: from the savings of her
small wage as teacher and book-agent, she had already purchased
one or two pieces of earth. On one of these, a small lot at the
edge of the public square, she persuaded him to build a shop.
This he did with his own hands, and the labor of two negro men:
it was a two-story shack of brick, with wide wooden steps,
leading down to the square from a marble porch. Upon this porch,
flanking the wooden doors, he placed some marbles; by the door,
he put the heavy simpering figure of an angel.</p>
<p>But Eliza was not content with his trade: there was no money
in death. People, she thought, died too slowly. And she foresaw
that her brother Will, who had begun at fifteen as helper in a
lumber yard, and was now the owner of a tiny business, was
destined to become a rich man. So she persuaded Gant to go into
partnership with Will Pentland: at the end of a year, however,
his patience broke, his tortured egotism leaped from its
restraint, he howled that Will, whose business hours were spent
chiefly in figuring upon a dirty envelope with a stub of a
pencil, paring reflectively his stubby nails, or punning
endlessly with a birdlike wink and nod, would ruin them all. Will
therefore quietly bought out his partner's interest, and moved on
toward the accumulation of a fortune, while Oliver returned to
isolation and his grimy angels.</p>
<p>The strange figure of Oliver Gant cast its famous shadow
through the town. Men heard at night and morning the great
formula of his curse to Eliza. They saw him plunge to house and
shop, they saw him bent above his marbles, they saw him mould in
his great hands&mdash;with curse, and howl, with passionate
devotion&mdash;the rich texture of his home. They laughed at his
wild excess of speech, of feeling, and of gesture. They were
silent before the maniac fury of his sprees, which occurred
almost punctually every two months, and lasted two or three days.
They picked him foul and witless from the cobbles, and brought
him home&mdash;the banker, the policeman, and a burly devoted
Swiss named Jannadeau, a grimy jeweller who rented a small fenced
space among Gant's tombstones. And always they handled him with
tender care, feeling something strange and proud and glorious
lost in that drunken ruin of Babel. He was a stranger to them: no
one&mdash;not even Eliza&mdash;ever called him by his first name.
He was&mdash;and remained thereafter&mdash;"Mister" Gant.</p>
<p>And what Eliza endured in pain and fear and glory no one knew.
He breathed over them all his hot lion-breath of desire and fury:
when he was drunk, her white pursed face, and all the slow
octopal movements of her temper, stirred him to red madness. She
was at such times in real danger from his assault: she had to
lock herself away from him. For from the first, deeper than love,
deeper than hate, as deep as the unfleshed bones of life, an
obscure and final warfare was being waged between them. Eliza
wept or was silent to his curse, nagged briefly in retort to his
rhetoric, gave like a punched pillow to his lunging
drive&mdash;and slowly, implacably had her way. Year by year,
above his howl of protest, he did not know how, they gathered in
small bits of earth, paid the hated taxes, and put the money that
remained into more land. Over the wife, over the mother, the
woman of property, who was like a man, walked slowly forth.</p>
<p>In eleven years she bore him nine children of whom six lived.
The first, a girl, died in her twentieth month, of infant
cholera; two more died at birth. The others outlived the grim and
casual littering. The oldest, a boy, was born in 1885. He was
given the name of Steve. The second, born fifteen months later,
was a girl&mdash;Daisy. The next, likewise a
girl&mdash;Helen&mdash;came three years later. Then, in 1892,
came twins&mdash;boys&mdash;to whom Gant, always with a zest for
politics, gave the names of Grover Cleveland and Benjamin
Harrison. And the last, Luke, was born two years later, in
1894.</p>
<p>Twice, during this period, at intervals of five years, Gant's
periodic spree lengthened into an unbroken drunkenness that
lasted for weeks. He was caught, drowning in the tides of his
thirst. Each time Eliza sent him away to take a cure for
alcoholism at Richmond. Once, Eliza and four of her children were
sick at the same time with typhoid fever. But during a weary
convalescence she pursed her lips grimly and took them off to
Florida.</p>
<p>Eliza came through stolidly to victory. As she marched down
these enormous years of love and loss, stained with the rich dyes
of pain and pride and death, and with the great wild flare of his
alien and passionate life, her limbs faltered in the grip of
ruin, but she came on, through sickness and emaciation, to
victorious strength. She knew there had been glory in it:
insensate and cruel as he had often been, she remembered the
enormous beating color of his life, and the lost and stricken
thing in him which he would never find. And fear and a speechless
pity rose in her when at times she saw the small uneasy eyes grow
still and darken with the foiled and groping hunger of old
frustration. O lost!</p>
<h3>3</h3>
<p>In the great processional of the years through which the
history of the Gants was evolving, few years had borne a heavier
weight of pain, terror, and wretchedness, and none was destined
to bring with it more conclusive events than that year which
marked the beginning of the twentieth century. For Gant and his
wife, the year 1900, in which one day they found themselves,
after growing to maturity in another century&mdash;a transition
which must have given, wherever it has happened, a brief but
poignant loneliness to thousands of imaginative people&mdash;had
coincidences, too striking to be unnoticed, with other boundaries
in their lives.</p>
<p>In that year Gant passed his fiftieth birthday: he knew he was
half as old as the century that had died, and that men do not
often live as long as centuries. And in that year, too, Eliza,
big with the last child she would ever have, went over the final
hedge of terror and desperation and, in the opulent darkness of
the summer night, as she lay flat in her bed with her hands upon
her swollen belly, she began to design her life for the years
when she would cease to be a mother.</p>
<p>In the already opening gulf on whose separate shores their
lives were founded, she was beginning to look, with the infinite
composure, the tremendous patience which waits through half a
lifetime for an event, not so much with certain foresight, as
with a prophetic, brooding instinct. This quality, this almost
Buddhistic complacency which, rooted in the fundamental structure
of her life, she could neither suppress nor conceal, was the
quality he could least understand, that infuriated him most. He
was fifty: he had a tragic consciousness of time&mdash;he saw the
passionate fulness of his life upon the wane, and he cast about
him like a senseless and infuriate beast. She had perhaps a
greater reason for quietude than he, for she had come on from the
cruel openings of her life, through disease, physical weakness,
poverty, the constant imminence of death and misery: she had lost
her first child, and brought the others safely through each
succeeding plague; and now, at forty-two, her last child stirring
in her womb, she had a conviction, enforced by her Scotch
superstition, and the blind vanity of her family, which saw
extinction for others but not for itself, that she was being
shaped to a purpose.</p>
<p>As she lay in her bed, a great star burned across her vision
in the western quarter of the sky; she fancied it was climbing
heaven slowly. And although she could not have said toward what
pinnacle her life was moving, she saw in the future freedom that
she had never known, possession and power and wealth, the desire
for which was mixed inextinguishably with the current of her
blood. Thinking of this in the dark, she pursed her lips with
thoughtful satisfaction, unhumorously seeing herself at work in
the carnival, taking away quite easily from the hands of folly
what it had never known how to keep.</p>
<p>"I'll get it!" she thought, "I'll get it. Will has it! Jim has
it. And I'm smarter than they are." And with regret, tinctured
with pain and bitterness, she thought of Gant:</p>
<p>"Pshaw! If I hadn't kept after him he wouldn't have a stick to
call his own to-day. What little we have got I've had to fight
for; we wouldn't have a roof over our heads; we'd spend the rest
of our lives in a rented house"&mdash;which was to her the final
ignominy of shiftless and improvident people.</p>
<p>And she resumed: "The money he squanders every year in licker
would buy a good lot: we could be well-to-do people now if we'd
started at the very beginning. But he's always hated the very
idea of owning anything: couldn't bear it, he told me once, since
he lost his money in that trade in Sydney. If I'd been there, you
can bet your bottom dollar there'd been no loss. Or, it'd be on
the other side," she added grimly.</p>
<p>And lying there while the winds of early autumn swept down
from the Southern hills, filling the black air with dropping
leaves, and making, in intermittent rushes, a remote sad thunder
in great trees, she thought of the stranger who had come to live
in her, and of that other stranger, author of so much woe, who
had lived with her for almost twenty years. And thinking of Gant,
she felt again an inchoate aching wonder, recalling the savage
strife between them, and the great submerged struggle beneath,
founded upon the hatred and the love of property, in which she
did not doubt of her victory, but which baffled her, foiled
her.</p>
<p>"I'll vow!" she whispered. "I'll vow! I never saw such a
man!"</p>
<p>Gant, faced with the loss of sensuous delight, knowing the
time had come when all his Rabelaisian excess in eating,
drinking, and loving must come under the halter, knew of no gain
that could compensate him for the loss of libertinism; he felt,
too, the sharp ache of regret, feeling that he had possessed
powers, had wasted chances, such as his partnership with Will
Pentland, that might have given him position and wealth. He knew
that the century had gone in which the best part of his life had
passed; he felt, more than ever, the strangeness and loneliness
of our little adventure upon the earth: he thought of his
childhood on the Dutch farm, the Baltimore days, the aimless
drift down the continent, the appalling fixation of his whole
life upon a series of accidents. The enormous tragedy of accident
hung like a gray cloud over his life. He saw more clearly than
ever that he was a stranger in a strange land among people who
would always be alien to him. Strangest of all, he thought, was
this union, by which he had begotten children, created a life
dependent on him, with a woman so remote from all he
understood.</p>
<p>He did not know whether the year 1900 marked for him a
beginning or an ending; but with the familiar weakness of the
sensualist, he resolved to make it an ending, burning the spent
fire in him down to a guttering flame. In the first half of the
month of January, still penitently true to the New Year's
reformation, he begot a child: by Spring, when it was evident
that Eliza was again pregnant, he had hurled himself into an orgy
to which even a notable four months' drunk in 1896 could offer no
precedent. Day after day he became maniacally drunk, until he
fixed himself in a state of constant insanity: in May she sent
him off again to a sanitarium at Piedmont to take the "cure,"
which consisted simply in feeding him plainly and cheaply, and
keeping him away from alcohol for six weeks, a regime which
contributed no more ravenously to his hunger than it did to his
thirst. He returned, outwardly chastened, but inwardly a raging
furnace, toward the end of June: the day before he came back,
Eliza, obviously big with child, her white face compactly set,
walked sturdily into each of the town's fourteen saloons, calling
up the proprietor or the bar- man behind his counter, and
speaking clearly and loudly in the sodden company of bar
clientry:</p>
<p>"See here: I just came in to tell you that Mr. Gant is coming
back to-morrow, and I want you all to know that if I hear of any
of you selling him a drink, I'll put you in the
penitentiary."</p>
<p>The threat, they knew, was preposterous, but the white
judicial face, the thoughtful pursing of the lips, and the right
hand, which she held loosely clenched, like a man's, with the
forefinger extended, emphasizing her proclamation with a calm,
but somehow powerful gesture, froze them with a terror no amount
of fierce excoriation could have produced. They received her
announcement in beery stupefaction, muttering at most a startled
agreement as she walked out.</p>
<p>"By God," said a mountaineer, sending a brown inaccurate
stream toward a cuspidor, "she'll do it, too. That woman means
business."</p>
<p>"Hell!" said Tim O'Donnel, thrusting his simian face comically
above his counter, "I wouldn't give W.O. a drink now if it was
fifteen cents a quart and we was alone in a privy. Is she gone
yet?"</p>
<p>There was vast whisky laughter.</p>
<p>"Who is she?" some one asked.</p>
<p>"She's Will Pentland's sister."</p>
<p>"By God, she'll do it then," cried several; and the place
trembled again with their laughter.</p>
<p>Will Pentland was in Loughran's when she entered. She did not
greet him. When she had gone he turned to a man near him,
prefacing his remark with a birdlike nod and wink: "Bet you can't
do that," he said.</p>
<p>Gant, when he returned, and was publicly refused at a bar, was
wild with rage and humiliation. He got whisky very easily, of
course, by sending a drayman from his steps, or some negro, in
for it; but, in spite of the notoriety of his conduct, which had,
he knew, become a classic myth for the children of the town, he
shrank at each new advertisement of his behaviour; he became,
year by year, more, rather than less, sensitive to it, and his
shame, his quivering humiliation on mornings after, product of
rasped pride and jangled nerves, was pitiable. He felt bitterly
that Eliza had with deliberate malice publicly degraded him: he
screamed denunciation and abuse at her on his return home.</p>
<p>All through the summer Eliza walked with white boding
placidity through horror&mdash;she had by now the hunger for it,
waiting with terrible quiet the return of fear at night. Angered
by her pregnancy, Gant went almost daily to Elizabeth's house in
Eagle Crescent, whence he was delivered nightly by a band of
exhausted and terrified prostitutes into the care of his son
Steve, his oldest child, by now pertly free with nearly all the
women in the district, who fondled him with good-natured
vulgarity, laughed heartily at his glib innuendoes, and suffered
him, even, to slap them smartly on their rumps, making for him
roughly as he skipped nimbly away.</p>
<p>"Son," said Elizabeth, shaking Gant's waggling head
vigorously, "don't you carry on, when you grow up, like the old
rooster here. But he's a nice old boy when he wants to be," she
continued, kissing the bald spot on his head, and deftly slipping
into the boy's hand the wallet Gant had, in a torrent of
generosity, given to her. She was scrupulously honest.</p>
<p>The boy was usually accompanied on these errands by Jannadeau
and Tom Flack, a negro hack-man, who waited in patient constraint
outside the latticed door of the brothel until the advancing
tumult within announced that Gant had been enticed to depart. And
he would go, either struggling clumsily and screaming eloquent
abuse at his suppliant captors, or jovially acquiescent,
bellowing a wanton song of his youth along the latticed crescent,
and through the supper-silent highways of the town.</p>
<blockquote>"Up in that back room, boys,<br>
Up in THAT back room,<br>
All among the fleas and bugs,<br>
I pit-tee your sad doom."</blockquote>
<p>Home, he would be cajoled up the tall veranda stairs, enticed
into his bed; or, resisting all compulsion, he would seek out his
wife, shut usually in her room, howling taunts at her, and
accusations of unchastity, since there festered in him dark
suspicion, fruit of his age, his wasting energy. Timid Daisy,
pale from fright, would have fled to the neighboring arms of
Sudie Isaacs, or to the Tarkintons; Helen, aged ten, even then
his delight, would master him, feeding spoonfuls of scalding soup
into his mouth, and slapping him sharply with her small hand when
he became recalcitrant.</p>
<p>"You DRINK this! You better!"</p>
<p>He was enormously pleased: they were both strung on the same
wires.</p>
<p>Again, he was beyond all reason. Extravagantly mad, he built
roaring fires in his sitting-room, drenching the leaping fire
with a can of oil; spitting exultantly into the answering roar,
and striking up, until he was exhausted, a profane chant, set to
a few recurrent bars of music, which ran, for forty minutes,
somewhat like this:</p>
<blockquote>"O-ho&mdash;Goddam,<br>
Goddam, Goddam,<br>
O-ho&mdash;Goddam,<br>
Goddam&mdash;Goddam."</blockquote>
<p>&mdash;adopting usually the measure by which clock-chimes
strike out the hour.</p>
<p>And outside, strung like apes along the wide wires of the
fence, Sandy and Fergus Duncan, Seth Tarkinton, sometimes Ben and
Grover themselves, joining in the glee of their friends, kept up
an answering chant:</p>
<blockquote>"Old man Gant<br>
Came home drunk!<br>
Old man Gant<br>
Came home drunk!"</blockquote>
<p>Daisy, from a neighbor's sanctuary, wept in shame and fear.
But Helen, small thin fury, held on relentlessly: presently he
would subside into a chair, and receive hot soup and stinging
slaps with a grin. Upstairs Eliza lay, white-faced and
watchfully.</p>
<p>So ran the summer by. The last grapes hung in dried and rotten
clusters to the vines; the wind roared distantly; September
ended.</p>
<p>One night the dry doctor, Cardiac, said: "I think we'll be
through with this before to-morrow evening." He departed, leaving
in the house a middle-aged country woman. She was a hard-handed
practical nurse.</p>
<p>At eight o'clock Gant returned alone. The boy Steve had stayed
at home for ready dispatch at Eliza's need; for the moment the
attention was shifted from the master.</p>
<p>His great voice below, chanting obscenities, carried across
the neighborhood: as she heard the sudden wild roar of flame up
the chimney, shaking the house in its flight, she called Steve to
her side, tensely: "Son, he'll burn us all up!" she
whispered.</p>
<p>They heard a chair fall heavily below, his curse; they heard
his heavy reeling stride across the dining-room and up the hall;
they heard the sagging creak of the stair-rail as his body swung
against it.</p>
<p>"He's coming!" she whispered. "He's coming! Lock the door,
son!"</p>
<p>The boy locked the door.</p>
<p>"Are you there?" Gant roared, pounding the flimsy door heavily
with his great fist. "Miss Eliza: are you there?" howling at her
the ironical title by which he addressed her at moments like
this.</p>
<p>And he screamed a sermon of profanity and woven
invective:&mdash;</p>
<p>"Little did I reck," he began, getting at once into the swing
of preposterous rhetoric which he used half furiously, half
comically, "little did I reck the day I first saw her eighteen
bitter years ago, when she came wriggling around the corner at me
like a snake on her belly&mdash;[a stock epithet which from
repetition was now heart- balm to him]&mdash;little did I reck
that&mdash;that&mdash;that it would come to this," he finished
lamely. He waited quietly, in the heavy silence, for some answer,
knowing that she lay in her white-faced calm behind the door, and
filled with the old choking fury because he knew she would not
answer.</p>
<p>"Are you there? I say, are you there, woman?" he howled,
barking his big knuckles in a furious bombardment.</p>
<p>There was nothing but the white living silence.</p>
<p>"Ah me! Ah me!" he sighed with strong self-pity, then burst
into forced snuffling sobs, which furnished a running
accompaniment to his denunciation. "Merciful God!" he wept, "it's
fearful, it's awful, it's croo-el. What have I ever done that God
should punish me like this in my old age?"</p>
<p>There was no answer.</p>
<p>"Cynthia! Cynthia!" he howled suddenly, invoking the memory of
his first wife, the gaunt tubercular spinstress whose life, it
was said, his conduct had done nothing to prolong, but whom he
was fond of supplicating now, realizing the hurt, the anger he
caused to Eliza by doing so. "Cynthia! O Cynthia! Look down upon
me in my hour of need! Give me succour! Give me aid! Protect me
against this fiend out of Hell!"</p>
<p>And he continued, weeping in heavy snuffling burlesque:
"O-boo- hoo-hoo! Come down and save me, I beg of you, I entreat
you, I implore you, or I perish."</p>
<p>Silence answered.</p>
<p>"Ingratitude, more fierce than brutish beasts," Gant resumed,
getting off on another track, fruitful with mixed and mangled
quotation. "You will be punished, as sure as there's a just God
in heaven. You will all be punished. Kick the old man, strike
him, throw him out on the street: he's no good any more. He's no
longer able to provide for the family&mdash;send him over the
hill to the poorhouse. That's where he belongs. Rattle his bones
over the stones. Honor thy father that thy days may be long. Ah,
Lord!</p>
<blockquote>"'Look, in this place ran Cassius' dagger
through;<br>
See what a rent the envious Casca made;<br>
Through this the well-beloved Brutus stabbed;<br>
And, as he plucked his curs&egrave;d steel away,<br>

it&mdash;'"</blockquote>
<p>"Jeemy," said Mrs. Duncan at this moment to her husband, "ye'd
better go over. He's loose agin, an' she's wi' chile."</p>
<p>The Scotchman thrust back his chair, moved strongly out of the
ordered ritual of his life, and the warm fragrance of new-baked
bread.</p>
<p>At the gate, outside Gant's, he found patient Jannadeau,
fetched down by Ben. They spoke matter-of-factly, and hastened up
the steps as they heard a crash upstairs, and a woman's cry.
Eliza, in only her night-dress, opened the door.</p>
<p>"Come quick!" she whispered. "Come quick!"</p>
<p>"By God, I'll kill her," Gant screamed, plunging down the
stairs at greater peril to his own life than to any other. "I'll
kill her now, and put an end to my misery."</p>
<p>He had a heavy poker in his hand. The two men seized him; the
burly jeweller took the poker from his hand with quiet
strength.</p>
<p>"He cut his head on the bed-rail, mama," said Steve
descending. It was true: Gant bled.</p>
<p>"Go for your Uncle Will, son. Quick!" He was off like a
hound.</p>
<p>"I think he meant it that time," she whispered.</p>
<p>Duncan shut the door against the gaping line of neighbors
beyond the gate.</p>
<p>"Ye'll be gettin' a cheel like that, Mrs. Gant."</p>
<p>"Keep him away from me! Keep him away!" she cried out
strongly.</p>
<p>"Aye, I will that!" he answered in quiet Scotch.</p>
<p>She turned to go up the stairs, but on the second step she
fell heavily to her knees. The country nurse, returning from the
bathroom, in which she had locked herself, ran to her aid. She
went up slowly then between the woman and Grover. Outside Ben
dropped nimbly from the low eave on to the lily beds: Seth
Tarkinton, clinging to fence wires, shouted greetings.</p>
<p>Gant went off docilely, somewhat dazed, between his two
guardians: as his huge limbs sprawled brokenly in his rocker,
they undressed him. Helen had already been busy in the kitchen
for some time: she appeared now with boiling soup.</p>
<p>Gant's dead eyes lit with recognition as he saw her.</p>
<p>"Why baby," he roared, making a vast maudlin circle with his
arms, "how are you?" She put the soup down; he swept her thin
body crushingly against him, brushing her cheek and neck with his
stiff- bristled mustache, breathing upon her the foul rank odor
of rye whisky.</p>
<p>"Oh, he's cut himself!" The little girl thought she was going
to cry.</p>
<p>"Look what they did to me, baby," he pointed to his wound and
whimpered.</p>
<p>Will Pentland, true son of that clan who forgot one another
never, and who saw one another only in times of death,
pestilence, and terror, came in.</p>
<p>"Good evening, Mr. Pentland," said Duncan.</p>
<p>"Jus' tolable," he said, with his bird-like nod and wink,
taking in both men good-naturedly. He stood in front of the fire,
paring meditatively at his blunt nails with a dull knife. It was
his familiar gesture when in company: no one, he felt, could see
what you thought about anything, if you pared your nails.</p>
<p>The sight of him drew Gant instantly from his lethargy: he
remembered the dissolved partnership; the familiar attitude of
Will Pentland, as he stood before the fire, evoked all the
markings he so heartily loathed in the clan&mdash;its pert
complacency, its incessant punning, its success.</p>
<p>"Mountain Grills!" he roared. "Mountain Grills! The lowest of
the low! The vilest of the vile!"</p>
<p>"Mr. Gant! Mr. Gant!" pleaded Jannadeau.</p>
<p>"What's the matter with you, W. O.?" asked Will Pentland,
looking up innocently from his fingers. "Had something to eat
that didn't agree with you?"&mdash;he winked pertly at Duncan,
and went back to his fingers.</p>
<p>"Your miserable old father," howled Gant, "was horsewhipped on
the public square for not paying his debts." This was a purely
imaginative insult, which had secured itself as truth, however,
in Gant's mind, as had so many other stock epithets, because it
gave him heart-cockle satisfaction.</p>
<p>"Horsewhipped upon his public square, was he?" Will winked
again, unable to resist the opening. "They kept it mighty quiet,
didn't they?" But behind the intense good-humored posture of his
face, his eyes were hard. He pursed his lips meditatively as he
worked upon his fingers.</p>
<p>"But I'll tell you something about him, W. O.," he continued
after a moment, with calm but boding judiciousness. "He let his
wife die a natural death in her own bed. He didn't try to kill
her."</p>
<p>"No, by God!" Gant rejoined. "He let her starve to death. If
the old woman ever got a square meal in her life she got it under
my roof. There's one thing sure: she could have gone to Hell and
back, twice over, before she got it from old Tom Pentland, or any
of his sons."</p>
<p>Will Pentland closed his blunt knife and put it in his
pocket.</p>
<p>"Old Major Pentland never did an honest day's work in his
life," Gant yelled, as a happy afterthought.</p>
<p>"Come now, Mr. Gant!" said Duncan reproachfully.</p>
<p>"Hush! Hush!" whispered the girl fiercely, coming before him
closely with the soup. She thrust a smoking ladle at his mouth,
but he turned his head away to hurl another insult. She slapped
him sharply across the mouth.</p>
<p>"You DRINK this!" she whispered. And grinning meekly as his
eyes rested upon her, he began to swallow soup.</p>
<p>Will Pentland looked at the girl attentively for a moment,
then glanced at Duncan and Jannadeau with a nod and wink. Without
saying another word, he left the room, and mounted the stairs.
His sister lay quietly extended on her back.</p>
<p>"How do you feel, Eliza?" The room was heavy with the rich
odor of mellowing pears; an unaccustomed fire of pine sticks
burned in the grate: he took up his place before it, and began to
pare his nails.</p>
<p>"Nobody knows&mdash;nobody knows," she began, bursting quickly
into a rapid flow of tears, "what I've been through." She wiped
her eyes in a moment on a corner of the coverlid: her broad
powerful nose, founded redly on her white face, was like
flame.</p>
<p>"What you got good to eat?" he said, winking at her with a
comic gluttony.</p>
<p>"There are some pears in there on the shelf, Will. I put them
there last week to mellow."</p>
<p>He went into the big closet and returned in a moment with a
large yellow pear; he came back to the hearth and opened the
smaller blade of his knife.</p>
<p>"I'll vow, Will," she said quietly after a moment. "I've had
all I can put up with. I don't know what's got into him. But you
can bet your bottom dollar I won't stand much more of it. I know
how to shift for myself," she said, nodding her head smartly. He
recognized the tone.</p>
<p>He almost forgot himself: "See here, Eliza," he began, "if you
were thinking of building somewhere, I"&mdash;but he recovered
himself in time&mdash;"I'll make you the best price you can get
on the material," he concluded. He thrust a slice of pear quickly
into his mouth.</p>
<p>She pursed her mouth rapidly for some moments.</p>
<p>"No," she said. "I'm not ready for that yet, Will. I'll let
you know." The loose wood-coals crumbled on the hearth.</p>
<p>"I'll let you know," she said again. He clasped his knife and
thrust it in a trousers pocket.</p>
<p>"Good night, Eliza," he said. "I reckon Pett will be in to see
you. I'll tell her you're all right."</p>
<p>He went down the stairs quietly, and let himself out through
the front door. As he descended the tall veranda steps, Duncan
and Jannadeau came quietly down the yard from the
sitting-room.</p>
<p>"How's W. O.?" he asked.</p>
<p>"Ah, he'll be all right now," said Duncan cheerfully. "He's
fast asleep."</p>
<p>"The sleep of the righteous?" asked Will Pentland with a
wink.</p>
<p>The Swiss resented the implied jeer at his Titan. "It is a
gread bitty," began Jannadeau in a low guttural voice, "that Mr.
Gant drinks. With his mind he could go far. When he's sober a
finer man doesn't live."</p>
<p>"When he's sober?" said Will, winking at him in the dark.
"What about when he's asleep."</p>
<p>"He's all right the minute Helen gets hold of him," Mr. Duncan
remarked in his rich voice. "It's wonderful what that little girl
can do to him."</p>
<p>"Ah, I tell you!" Jannadeau laughed with guttural pleasure.
"That little girl knows her daddy in and out."</p>
<p>The child sat in the big chair by the waning sitting-room
fire: she read until the flames had died to coals&mdash;then
quietly she shovelled ashes on them. Gant, fathoms deep in
slumber, lay on the smooth leather sofa against the wall. She had
wrapped him well in a blanket; now she put a pillow on a chair
and placed his feet on it. He was rank with whisky stench; the
window rattled as he snored.</p>
<p>Thus, drowned in oblivion, ran his night; he slept when the
great pangs of birth began in Eliza at two o'clock; slept through
all the patient pain and care of doctor, nurse, and wife.</p>
<h3>4</h3>
<p>The baby was, to reverse an epigram, an unconscionable time in
getting born; but when Gant finally awoke just after ten o'clock
next morning, whimpering from tangled nerves, and the quivering
shame of dim remembrance, he heard, as he drank the hot coffee
Helen brought to him, a loud, long lungy cry above.</p>
<p>"Oh, my God, my God," he groaned. And he pointed toward the
sound. "Is it a boy or a girl?"</p>
<p>"I haven't seen it yet, papa," Helen answered. "They won't let
us in. But Doctor Cardiac came out and told us if we were good he
might bring us a little boy."</p>
<p>There was a terrific clatter on the tin roof, the scolding
country voice of the nurse: Steve dropped like a cat from the
porch roof to the lily bed outside Gant's window.</p>
<p>"Steve, you damned scoundrel," roared the manor-lord with a
momentary return to health, "what in the name of Jesus are you
doing?"</p>
<p>The boy was gone over the fence.</p>
<p>"I seen it! I seen it!" his voice came streaking back.</p>
<p>"I seen it too!" screamed Grover, racing through the room and
out again in simple exultancy.</p>
<p>"If I catch you younguns on this roof agin," yelled the
country nurse aloft, "I'll take your hide off you."</p>
<p>Gant had been momentarily cheered when he heard that his
latest heir was a male; but he walked the length of the room now,
making endless plaint.</p>
<p>"Oh my God, my God! Did this have to be put upon me in my old
age? Another mouth to feed! It's fearful, it's awful, it's
croo-el," and he began to weep affectedly. Then, realizing
presently that no one was near enough to be touched by his
sorrow, he paused suddenly and precipitated himself toward the
door, crossing the dining-room, and, going up the hall, making
loud lament:</p>
<p>"Eliza! My wife! Oh, baby, say that you forgive me!" He went
up the stairs, sobbing laboriously.</p>
<p>"Don't you let him in here!" cried the object of this prayer
sharply with quite remarkable energy.</p>
<p>"Tell him he can't come in now," said Cardiac, in his dry
voice, to the nurse, staring intently at the scales. "We've
nothing but milk to drink, anyway," he added.</p>
<p>Gant was outside.</p>
<p>"Eliza, my wife! Be merciful, I beg of you. If I had
known&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Yes," said the country nurse opening the door rudely, "if the
dog hadn't stopped to lift his leg he'd a-caught the rabbit! You
get away from here!" And she slammed it violently in his
face.</p>
<p>He went downstairs with hang-dog head, but he grinned slyly as
he thought of the nurse's answer. He wet his big thumb quickly on
his tongue.</p>
<p>"Merciful God!" he said, and grinned. Then he set up his caged
lament.</p>
<p>"I think this will do," said Cardiac, holding up something
red, shiny, and puckered by its heels, and smacking it briskly on
its rump, to liven it a bit.</p>
<p>The heir apparent had, as a matter of fact, made his debut
completely equipped with all appurtenances, dependences, screws,
cocks, faucets, hooks, eyes, nails, considered necessary for
completeness of appearance, harmony of parts, and unity of effect
in this most energetic, driving, and competitive world. He was
the complete male in miniature, the tiny acorn from which the
mighty oak must grow, the heir of all ages, the inheritor of
unfulfilled renown, the child of progress, the darling of the
budding Golden Age and, what's more, Fortune and her Fairies, not
content with well-nigh smothering him with these blessings of
time and family, saved him up carefully until Progress was
rotten-ripe with glory.</p>
<p>"Well, what are you going to call it?" inquired Dr. Cardiac,
referring thus, with shocking and medical coarseness, to this
most royal imp.</p>
<p>Eliza was better tuned to cosmic vibrations. With a full, if
inexact, sense of what portended, she gave to Luck's Lad the
title of Eugene, a name which, beautifully, means "well born,"
but which, as any one will be able to testify, does not mean, has
never meant, "well bred."</p>
<p>This chosen incandescence, to whom a name had already been
given, and from whose centre most of the events in this chronicle
must be seen, was borne in, as we have said, upon the very
spear-head of history. But perhaps, reader, you have already
thought of that? You HAVEN'T? Then let us refresh your historical
memory.</p>
<p>By 1900, Oscar Wilde and James A. McNeill Whistler had almost
finished saying the things they were reported as saying, and that
Eugene was destined to hear, twenty years later; most of the
Great Victorians had died before the bombardment began; William
McKinley was up for a second term, the crew of the Spanish navy
had returned home in a tugboat.</p>
<p>Abroad, grim old Britain had sent her ultimatum to the South
Africans in 1899; Lord Roberts ("Little Bobs," as he was known
affectionately to his men) was appointed commander-in-chief after
several British reverses; the Transvaal Republic was annexed to
Great Britain in September 1900, and formally annexed in the
month of Eugene's birth. There was a Peace Conference two years
later.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, what was going on in Japan? I will tell you: the
first parliament met in 1891, there was a war with China in
1894-95, Formosa was ceded in 1895. Moreover, Warren Hastings had
been impeached and tried; Pope Sixtus the Fifth had come and
gone; Dalmatia had been subdued by Tiberius; Belisarius had been
blinded by Justinian; the wedding and funeral ceremonies of
Wilhelmina Charlotte Caroline of Brandenburg-Ansbach and King
George the Second had been solemnized, while those of Berengaria
of Navarre to King Richard the First were hardly more than a
distant memory; Diocletian, Charles the Fifth, and Victor Amadeus
of Sardinia, had all abdicated their thrones; Henry James Pye,
Poet Laureate of England, was with his fathers; Cassiodorus,
Quintilian, Juvenal, Lucretius, Martial, and Albert the Bear of
Brandenburg had answered the last great roll-call; the battles of
Antietam, Smolensko, Drumclog, Inkerman, Marengo, Cawnpore,
Killiecrankie, Sluys, Actium, Lepanto, Tewkesbury, Brandywine,
Hohenlinden, Salamis, and the Wilderness had been fought both by
land and by sea; Hippias had been expelled from Athens by the
Alc&aelig;monid&aelig; and the Laced&aelig;monians; Simonides,
Menander, Strabo, Moschus, and Pindar had closed their earthly
accounts; the beatified Eusebius, Athanasius, and Chrysostom had
gone to their celestial niches; Menkaura had built the Third
Pyramid; Aspalta had led victorious armies; the remote Bermudas,
Malta, and the Windward Isles had been colonized. In addition,
the Spanish Armada had been defeated; President Abraham Lincoln
assassinated, and the Halifax Fisheries Award had given
$5,500,000 to Britain for twelve-year fishing privileges.
Finally, only thirty or forty million years before, our earliest
ancestors had crawled out of the primeval slime; and then, no
doubt, finding the change unpleasant, crawled back in again.</p>
<p>Such was the state of history when Eugene entered the theatre
of human events in 1900.</p>
<p>We would give willingly some more extended account of the
world his life touched during the first few years, showing, in
all its perspectives and implications, the meaning of life as
seen from the floor, or from the crib, but these impressions are
suppressed when they might be told, not through any fault of
intelligence, but through lack of muscular control, the powers of
articulation, and because of the recurring waves of loneliness,
weariness, depression, aberration, and utter blankness which war
against the order in a man's mind until he is three or four years
old.</p>
<p>Lying darkly in his crib, washed, powdered, and fed, he
thought quietly of many things before he dropped off to
sleep&mdash;the interminable sleep that obliterated time for him,
and that gave him a sense of having missed forever a day of
sparkling life. At these moments, he was heartsick with weary
horror as he thought of the discomfort, weakness, dumbness, the
infinite misunderstanding he would have to endure before he
gained even physical freedom. He grew sick as he thought of the
weary distance before him, the lack of co-ordination of the
centres of control, the undisciplined and rowdy bladder, the
helpless exhibition he was forced to give in the company of his
sniggering, pawing brothers and sisters, dried, cleaned, revolved
before them.</p>
<p>He was in agony because he was poverty-stricken in symbols:
his mind was caught in a net because he had no words to work
with. He had not even names for the objects around him: he
probably defined them for himself by some jargon, reinforced by
some mangling of the speech that roared about him, to which he
listened intently day after day, realizing that his first escape
must come through language. He indicated as quickly as he could
his ravenous hunger for pictures and print: sometimes they
brought him great books profusely illustrated, and he bribed them
desperately by cooing, shrieking with delight, making extravagant
faces, and doing all the other things they understood in him. He
wondered savagely how they would feel if they knew what he really
thought: at other times he had to laugh at them and at their
whole preposterous comedy of errors as they pranced around for
his amusement, waggled their heads at him, tickled him roughly,
making him squeal violently against his will. The situation was
at once profoundly annoying and comic: as he sat in the middle of
the floor and watched them enter, seeing the face of each
transformed by a foolish leer, and hearing their voices become
absurd and sentimental whenever they addressed him, speaking to
him words which he did not yet understand, but which he saw they
were mangling in the preposterous hope of rendering intelligible
that which has been previously mutilated, he had to laugh at the
fools, in spite of his vexation.</p>
<p>And left alone to sleep within a shuttered room, with the
thick sunlight printed in bars upon the floor, unfathomable
loneliness and sadness crept through him: he saw his life down
the solemn vista of a forest aisle, and he knew he would always
be the sad one: caged in that little round of skull, imprisoned
in that beating and most secret heart, his life must always walk
down lonely passages. Lost. He understood that men were forever
strangers to one another, that no one ever comes really to know
any one, that imprisoned in the dark womb of our mother, we come
to life without having seen her face, that we are given to her
arms a stranger, and that, caught in that insoluble prison of
being, we escape it never, no matter what arms may clasp us, what
mouth may kiss us, what heart may warm us. Never, never, never,
never, never.</p>
<p>He saw that the great figures that came and went about him,
the huge leering heads that bent hideously into his crib, the
great voices that rolled incoherently above him, had for one
another not much greater understanding than they had for him:
that even their speech, their entire fluidity and ease of
movement were but meagre communicants of their thought or
feeling, and served often not to promote understanding, but to
deepen and widen strife, bitterness, and prejudice.</p>
<p>His brain went black with terror. He saw himself an
inarticulate stranger, an amusing little clown, to be dandled and
nursed by these enormous and remote figures. He had been sent
from one mystery into another: somewhere within or without his
consciousness he heard a great bell ringing faintly, as if it
sounded undersea, and as he listened, the ghost of memory walked
through his mind, and for a moment he felt that he had almost
recovered what he had lost.</p>
<p>Sometimes, pulling himself abreast the high walls of his crib,
he glanced down dizzily at the patterns of the carpet far below;
the world swam in and out of his mind like a tide, now printing
its whole sharp picture for an instant, again ebbing out dimly
and sleepily, while he pieced the puzzle of sensation together
bit by bit, seeing only the dancing fire-sheen on the poker,
hearing then the elfin clucking of the sun-warm hens, somewhere
beyond in a distant and enchanted world. Again, he heard their
morning-wakeful crowing dear and loud, suddenly becoming a
substantial and alert citizen of life; or, going and coming in
alternate waves of fantasy and fact, he heard the loud, faery
thunder of Daisy's parlor music. Years later, he heard it again,
a door opened in his brain: she told him it was Paderewski's
"Minuet."</p>
<p>His crib was a great woven basket, well mattressed and
pillowed within; as he grew stronger, he was able to perform
extraordinary acrobatics in it, tumbling, making a hoop of his
body, and drawing himself easily and strongly erect: with patient
effort he could worm over the side on to the floor. There, he
would crawl on the vast design of the carpet, his eyes intent
upon great wooden blocks piled chaotically on the floor. They had
belonged to his brother Luke: all the letters of the alphabet, in
bright multi-colored carving, were engraved upon them.</p>
<p>Holding them clumsily in his tiny hands, he studied for hours
the symbols of speech, knowing that he had here the stones of the
temple of language, and striving desperately to find the key that
would draw order and intelligence from this anarchy. Great voices
soared far above him, vast shapes came and went, lifting him to
dizzy heights, depositing him with exhaustless strength. The bell
rang under the sea.</p>
<p>One day when the opulent Southern Spring had richly unfolded,
when the spongy black earth of the yard was covered with sudden,
tender grass, and wet blossoms, the great cherry tree seethed
slowly with a massive gem of amber sap, and the cherries hung
ripening in prodigal clusters, Gant took him from his basket in
the sun on the high front porch, and went with him around the
house by the lily bed, taking him back under trees singing with
hidden birds, to the far end of the lot.</p>
<p>Here the earth was unshaded, dry, clotted by the plough.
Eugene knew by the stillness that it was Sunday: against the high
wire fence there was the heavy smell of hot dock-weed. On the
other side, Swain's cow was wrenching the cool coarse grass,
lifting her head from time to time, and singing in her strong
deep voice her Sunday exuberance. In the warm washed air, Eugene
heard with absolute clearness all the brisk backyard sounds of
the neighborhood, he became acutely aware of the whole scene, and
as Swain's cow sang out again, he felt the flooded gates in him
swing open. He answered "Moo!" phrasing the sound timidly but
perfectly, and repeating it confidently in a moment when the cow
answered.</p>
<p>Gant's delight was boundless. He turned and raced back toward
the house at the full stride of his legs. And as he went, he
nuzzled his stiff mustache into Eugene's tender neck, mooing
industriously and always getting an answer.</p>
<p>"Lord a' mercy!" cried Eliza, looking from the kitchen window
as he raced down the yard with breakneck strides, "He'll kill
that child yet."</p>
<p>And as he rushed up the kitchen steps&mdash;all the house,
save the upper side was off the ground&mdash;she came out on the
little latticed veranda, her hands floury, her nose
stove-red.</p>
<p>"Why, what on earth are you doing, Mr. Gant?"</p>
<p>"Moo-o-o! He said 'Moo-o-o!' Yes he did!" Gant spoke to Eugene
rather than to Eliza.</p>
<p>Eugene answered him immediately: he felt it was all rather
silly, and he saw he would be kept busy imitating Swain's cow for
several days, but he was tremendously excited, nevertheless,
feeling now that that wall had been breached.</p>
<p>Eliza was likewise thrilled, but her way of showing it was to
turn back to the stove, hiding her pleasure, and saying: "I'll
vow, Mr. Gant. I never saw such an idiot with a child."</p>
<p>Later, Eugene lay wakefully in his basket on the sitting-room
floor, watching the smoking dishes go by in the eager hands of
the combined family, for Eliza at this time cooked magnificently,
and a Sunday dinner was something to remember. For two hours
since their return from church, the little boys had been prowling
hungrily around the kitchen: Ben, frowning proudly, kept his
dignity outside the screen, making excursions frequently through
the house to watch the progress of cookery; Grover came in and
watched with frank interest until he was driven out; Luke, his
broad humorous little face split by a wide exultant smile, rushed
through the house, squealing exultantly:</p>
<blockquote>"Weenie, weedie, weeky,<br>
Weenie, weedie, weeky,<br>
Weenie, weedie, weeky,<br>
Wee, Wee, Wee."</blockquote>
<p>He had heard Daisy and Josephine Brown doing C&aelig;sar
together, and his chant was his own interpretation of
C&aelig;sar's brief boast: "Veni, Vidi, Vici."</p>
<p>As Eugene lay in his crib, he heard through the open door the
dining-room clatter, the shrill excitement of the boys, the
clangor of steel and knife as Gant prepared to carve the roast,
the reception of the morning's great event told over and over
without variation, but with increasing zest.</p>
<p>"Soon," he thought, as the heavy food fragrance floated in to
him, "I shall be in there with them." And he thought lusciously
of mysterious and succulent food.</p>
<p>All through the afternoon upon the veranda Gant told the
story, summoning the neighbors and calling upon Eugene to
perform. Eugene heard clearly all that was said that day: he was
not able to answer, but he saw now that speech was imminent.</p>
<p>Thus, later, he saw the first two years of his life in
brilliant and isolated flashes. His second Christmas he
remembered vaguely as a period of great festivity: it accustomed
him to the third when it came. With the miraculous habitude
children acquire, it seemed that he had known Christmas
forever.</p>
<p>He was conscious of sunlight, rain, the leaping fire, his
crib, the grim jail of winter: the second Spring, one warm day,
he saw Daisy go off to school up the hill: it was the end of the
noon recess, she had been home for lunch. She went to Miss Ford's
School For Girls; it was a red brick residence on the corner at
the top of the steep hill: he watched her join Eleanor Duncan
just below. Her hair was braided in two long hanks down her back:
she was demure, shy, maidenly, a timid and blushing girl; but he
feared her attentions to him, for she bathed him furiously,
wreaking whatever was explosive and violent beneath her placidity
upon his hide. She really scrubbed him almost raw. He howled
piteously. As she climbed the hill, he remembered her. He saw she
was the same person.</p>
<p>He passed his second birthday with the light growing. Early in
the following Spring he became conscious of a period of neglect:
the house was deadly quiet; Gant's voice no longer roared around
him, the boys came and went on stealthy feet. Luke, the fourth to
be attacked by the pestilence, was desperately ill with typhoid:
Eugene was intrusted almost completely to a young slovenly
negress. He remembered vividly her tall slattern figure, her
slapping lazy feet, her dirty white stockings, and her strong
smell, black and funky. One day she took him out on the side
porch to play: it was a young Spring morning, bursting moistly
from the thaw of the earth. The negress sat upon the side-steps
and yawned while he grubbed in his dirty little dress along the
path, and upon the lily bed. Presently, she went to sleep against
the post. Craftily, he wormed his body through the wide wires of
the fence, into the cindered alley that wound back to the
Swains', and up to the ornate wooden palace of the Hilliards.</p>
<p>They were among the highest aristocracy of the town: they had
come from South Carolina, "near Charleston," which in itself gave
them at that time a commanding prestige. The house, a huge gabled
structure of walnut-brown, which gave the effect of many angles
and no plan, was built upon the top of the hill which sloped down
to Gant's; the level ground on top before the house was tenanted
by lordly towering oaks. Below, along the cindered alley,
flanking Gant's orchard, there were high singing pines.</p>
<p>Mr. Hilliard's house was considered one of the finest
residences in the town. The neighborhood was middle-class, but
the situation was magnificent, and the Hilliards carried on in
the grand manner, lords of the castle who descended into the
village, but did not mix with its people. All of their friends
arrived by carriage from afar; every day punctually at two
o'clock, an old liveried negro drove briskly up the winding alley
behind two sleek brown mares, waiting under the carriage entrance
at the side until his master and mistress should come out. Five
minutes later they drove out, and were gone for two hours.</p>
<p>This ritual, followed closely from his father's sitting-room
window, fascinated Eugene for years after: the people and the
life next door were crudely and symbolically above him.</p>
<p>He felt a great satisfaction that morning in being at length
in Hilliard's alley: it was his first escape, and it had been
made into a forbidden and enhaloed region. He grubbed about in
the middle of the road, disappointed in the quality of the
cinders. The booming courthouse bell struck eleven times.</p>
<p>Now, exactly at three minutes after eleven every morning, so
unfailing and perfect was the order of this great establishment,
a huge gray horse trotted slowly up the hill, drawing behind him
a heavy grocery wagon, musty, spicy, odorous with the fine smells
of grocery-stores and occupied exclusively by the Hilliard
victuals, and the driver, a young negro man who, at three minutes
past eleven every morning, according to ritual, was comfortably
asleep. Nothing could possibly go wrong: the horse could not have
been tempted even by a pavement of oats to betray his sacred
mission. Accordingly he trotted heavily up the hill, turned
ponderously into the alley ruts, and advanced heavily until,
feeling the great circle of his right forefoot obstructed by some
foreign particle, he looked down and slowly removed his hoof from
what had recently been the face of a little boy.</p>
<p>Then, with his legs carefully straddled, he moved on, drawing
the wagon beyond Eugene's body, and stopping. Both negroes awoke
simultaneously; there were cries within the house, and Eliza and
Gant rushed out of doors. The frightened negro lifted Eugene, who
was quite unconscious of his sudden return to the stage, into the
burly arms of Doctor McGuire, who cursed the driver eloquently.
His thick sensitive fingers moved swiftly around the bloody
little face and found no fracture.</p>
<p>He nodded briefly at their desperate faces: "He's being saved
for Congress," said he. "You have bad luck and hard heads, W.
O."</p>
<p>"You Goddamned black scoundrel," yelled the master, turning
with violent relief upon the driver. "I'll put you behind the
bars for this." He thrust his great length of hands through the
fence and choked the negro, who mumbled prayers, and had no idea
what was happening to him, save that he was the centre of a wild
commotion.</p>
<p>The negro girl, blubbering, had fled inward.</p>
<p>"This looks worse than it is," observed Dr. McGuire, laying
the hero upon the lounge. "Some hot water, please." Nevertheless,
it took two hours to bring him round. Every one spoke highly of
the horse.</p>
<p>"He had more sense than the nigger," said Gant, wetting his
thumb.</p>
<p>But all this, as Eliza knew in her heart, was part of the plan
of the Dark Sisters. The entrails had been woven and read long
since: the frail shell of skull which guarded life, and which
might have been crushed as easily as a man breaks an egg, was
kept intact. But Eugene carried the mark of the centaur for many
years, though the light had to fall properly to reveal it.</p>
<p>When he was older, he wondered sometimes if the Hilliards had
issued from their high place when he had so impiously disturbed
the order of the manor. He never asked, but he thought not: he
imagined them, at the most, as standing superbly by a drawn
curtain, not quite certain what had happened, but feeling that it
was something unpleasant, with blood in it.</p>
<p>Shortly after this, Mr. Hilliard had a "No-Trespassing" sign
staked up in the lot.</p>
<h3>5</h3>
<p>Luke got well after cursing doctor, nurse, and family for
several weeks: it was stubborn typhoid.</p>
<p>Gant was now head of a numerous family, which rose ladderwise
from infancy to the adolescent Steve&mdash;who was
eighteen&mdash;and the maidenly Daisy. She was seventeen and in
her last year at high school. She was a timid, sensitive girl,
looking like her name&mdash;Daisy-ish industrious and thorough in
her studies: her teachers thought her one of the best students
they had ever known. She had very little fire, or denial in her;
she responded dutifully to instructions; she gave back what had
been given to her. She played the piano without any passionate
feeling for the music; but she rendered it honestly with a
beautiful rippling touch. And she practised hours at a time.</p>
<p>It was apparent, however, that Steve was lacking in
scholarship. When he was fourteen, he was summoned by the school
principal to his little office, to take a thrashing for truancy
and insubordination. But the spirit of acquiescence was not in
him: he snatched the rod from the man's hand, broke it, smote him
solidly in the eye, and dropped gleefully eighteen feet to the
ground.</p>
<p>This was one of the best things he ever did: his conduct in
other directions was less fortunate. Very early, as his truancy
mounted, and after he had been expelled, and as his life hardened
rapidly in a defiant viciousness, the antagonism between the boy
and Gant grew open and bitter. Gant recognized perhaps most of
his son's vices as his own: there was little, however, of his
redeeming quality. Steve had a piece of tough suet where his
heart should have been.</p>
<p>Of them all, he had had very much the worst of it. Since his
childhood he had been the witness of his father's wildest
debauches. He had not forgotten. Also, as the oldest, he was left
to shift for himself while Eliza's attention focussed on her
younger children. She was feeding Eugene at her breast long after
Steve had taken his first two dollars to the ladies of Eagle
Crescent.</p>
<p>He was inwardly sore at the abuse Gant heaped on him; he was
not insensitive to his faults, but to be called a
"good-for-nothing bum," "a worthless degenerate," "a pool-room
loafer," hardened his outward manner of swagger defiance. Cheaply
and flashily dressed, with peg-top yellow shoes, flaring striped
trousers, and a broad- brimmed straw hat with a colored band, he
would walk down the avenue with a preposterous lurch, and a smile
of strained assurance on his face, saluting with servile
cordiality all who would notice him. And if a man of property
greeted him, his lacerated but overgrown vanity would seize the
crumb, and he would boast pitifully at home: "They all know
Little Stevie! He's got the respect of all the big men in this
town, all right, all right! Every one has a good word for Little
Stevie except his own people. Do you know what J. T. Collins said
to me to-day?"</p>
<p>"What say? Who's that? Who's that?" asked Eliza with comic
rapidity, looking up from her darning.</p>
<p>"J. T. Collins&mdash;that's who! He's only worth about two
hundred thousand. 'Steve,' he said, just like that, 'if I had
your brains'"&mdash;He would continue in this way with moody
self- satisfaction, painting a picture of future success when all
who scorned him now would flock to his standard.</p>
<p>"Oh, yes," said he, "they'll all be mighty anxious then to
shake Little Stevie's hand."</p>
<p>Gant, in a fury, gave him a hard beating when he had been
expelled from school. He had never forgotten. Finally, he was
told to go to work and support himself: he found desultory
employment as a soda-jerker, or as delivery boy for a morning
paper. Once, with a crony, Gus Moody, son of a foundry-man, he
had gone off to see the world. Grimy from vagabondage they had
crawled off a freight-train at Knoxville, Tennessee, spent their
little money on food, and in a brothel, and returned, two days
later, coal-black but boastful of their exploit.</p>
<p>"I'll vow," Eliza fretted, "I don't know what's to become of
that boy." It was the tragic flaw of her temperament to get to
the vital point too late: she pursed her lips thoughtfully,
wandered off in another direction, and wept when misfortune came.
She always waited. Moreover, in her deepest heart, she had an
affection for her oldest son, which, if it was not greater, was
at least different in kind from what she bore for the others. His
glib boastfulness, his pitiable brag, pleased her: they were to
her indications of his "smartness," and she often infuriated her
two studious girls by praising them. Thus, looking at a specimen
of his handwriting, she would say:</p>
<p>"There's one thing sure: he writes a better hand than any of
the rest of you, for all your schooling."</p>
<p>Steve had early tasted the joys of the bottle, stealing,
during the days when he was a young attendant of his father's
debauch, a furtive swallow from the strong rank whisky in a
half-filled flask: the taste nauseated him, but the experience
made good boasting for his fellows.</p>
<p>At fifteen, he had found, while smoking cigarettes with Gus
Moody, in a neighbor's barn, a bottle wrapped in an oats sack by
the worthy citizen, against the too sharp examination of his
wife. When the man had come for secret potation some time later,
and found his bottle half-empty, he had grimly dosed the
remainder with Croton oil: the two boys were nauseously sick for
several days.</p>
<p>One day, Steve forged a check on his father. It was some days
before Gant discovered it: the amount was only three dollars, but
his anger was bitter. In a pronouncement at home, delivered
loudly enough to publish the boy's offense to the neighborhood,
he spoke of the penitentiary, of letting him go to jail, of being
disgraced in his old age&mdash;a period of his life at which he
had not yet arrived, but which he used to his advantage in times
of strife.</p>
<p>He paid the check, of course, but another name&mdash;that of
"forger"&mdash;was added to the vocabulary of his abuse. Steve
sneaked in and out of the house, eating his meals alone for
several days. When he met his father little was said by either:
behind the hard angry glaze of their eyes, they both looked
depthlessly into each other; they knew that they could withhold
nothing from each other, that the same sores festered in each,
the same hungers and desires, the same crawling appetites
polluted their blood. And knowing this, something in each of them
turned away in grievous shame.</p>
<p>Gant added this to his tirades against Eliza; all that was bad
in the boy his mother had given him.</p>
<p>"Mountain Blood! Mountain Blood!" he yelled. "He's Greeley
Pentland all over again. Mark my words," he continued, after
striding feverishly about the house, muttering to himself and
bursting finally into the kitchen, "mark my words, he'll wind up
in the penitentiary."</p>
<p>And, her nose reddened by the spitting grease, she would purse
her lips, saying little, save, when goaded, to make some return
calculated to infuriate and antagonize him.</p>
<p>"Well, maybe if he hadn't been sent to every dive in town to
pull his daddy out, he would turn out better."</p>
<p>"You lie, Woman! By God, you lie!" he thundered magnificently
but illogically.</p>
<p>Gant drank less: save for a terrifying spree every six or
eight weeks, which bound them all in fear for two or three days,
Eliza had little to complain of on this score. But her enormous
patience was wearing very thin because of the daily cycle of
abuse. They slept now in separate rooms upstairs: he rose at six
or six-thirty, dressed and went down to build the fires. As he
kindled a blaze in the range, and a roaring fire in the
sitting-room, he muttered constantly to himself, with an
occasional oratorical rise and fall of his voice. In this way he
composed and polished the flood of his invective: when the
demands of fluency and emphasis had been satisfied he would
appear suddenly before her in the kitchen, and deliver himself
without preliminary, as the grocer's negro entered with pork
chops or a thick steak:</p>
<p>"Woman, would you have had a roof to shelter you to-day if it
hadn't been for me? Could you have depended on your worthless old
father, Tom Pentland, to give you one? Would Brother Will, or
Brother Jim give you one? Did you ever hear of them giving any
one anything? Did you ever hear of them caring for anything but
their own miserable hides? DID you? Would any of them give a
starving beggar a crust of bread? By God, no! Not even if he ran
a bakery shop! Ah me! 'Twas a bitter day for me when I first came
into this accursed country: little did I know what it would lead
to. Mountain Grills! Mountain Grills!" and the tide would reach
its height.</p>
<p>At times, when she tried to reply to his attack, she would
burst easily into tears. This pleased him: he liked to see her
cry. But usually she made an occasional nagging retort: deep
down, between their blind antagonistic souls, an ugly and
desperate war was being waged. Yet, had he known to what lengths
these daily assaults might drive her, he would have been
astounded: they were part of the deep and feverish discontent of
his spirit, the rooted instinct to have an object for his
abuse.</p>
<p>Moreover, his own feeling for order was so great that he had a
passionate aversion for what was slovenly, disorderly, diffuse.
He was goaded to actual fury at times when he saw how carefully
she saved bits of old string, empty cans and bottles, paper,
trash of every description: the mania for acquisition, as yet an
undeveloped madness in Eliza, enraged him.</p>
<p>"In God's name!" he would cry with genuine anger. "In God's
name! Why don't you get rid of some of this junk?" And he would
move destructively toward it.</p>
<p>"No you don't, Mr. Gant!" she would answer sharply. "You never
know when those things will come in handy."</p>
<p>It was, perhaps, a reversal of custom that the deep-hungering
spirit of quest belonged to the one with the greatest love of
order, the most pious regard for ritual, who wove into a pattern
even his daily tirades of abuse, and that the sprawling blot of
chaos, animated by one all-mastering desire for possession,
belonged to the practical, the daily person.</p>
<p>Gant had the passion of the true wanderer, of him who wanders
from a fixed point. He needed the order and the dependence of a
home&mdash;he was intensely a family man: their clustered warmth
and strength about him was life. After his punctual morning
tirade at Eliza, he went about the rousing of the slumbering
children. Comically, he could not endure feeling, in the morning,
that he was the only one awake and about.</p>
<p>His waking cry, delivered by formula, with huge comic
gruffness from the foot of the stairs, took this form:</p>
<p>"Steve! Ben! Grover! Luke! You damned scoundrels: get up! In
God's name, what will become of you! You'll never amount to
anything as long as you live."</p>
<p>He would continue to roar at them from below as if they were
wakefully attentive above.</p>
<p>"When I was your age, I had milked four cows, done all the
chores, and walked eight miles through the snow by this
time."</p>
<p>Indeed, when he described his early schooling, he furnished a
landscape that was constantly three feet deep in snow, and frozen
hard. He seemed never to have attended school save under polar
conditions.</p>
<p>And fifteen minutes later, he would roar again: "You'll never
amount to anything, you good-for-nothing bums! If one side of the
wall caved in, you'd roll over to the other."</p>
<p>Presently now there would be the rapid thud of feet upstairs,
and one by one they would descend, rushing naked into the
sitting-room with their clothing bundled in their arms. Before
his roaring fire they would dress.</p>
<p>By breakfast, save for sporadic laments, Gant was in something
approaching good humor. They fed hugely: he stoked their plates
for them with great slabs of fried steak, grits fried in egg, hot
biscuits, jam, fried apples. He departed for his shop about the
time the boys, their throats still convulsively swallowing hot
food and coffee, rushed from the house at the warning signal of
the mellow-tolling final nine-o'clock school bell.</p>
<p>He returned for lunch&mdash;dinner, as they called
it&mdash;briefly garrulous with the morning's news; in the
evening, as the family gathered in again, he returned, built his
great fire, and launched his supreme invective, a ceremony which
required a half hour in composition, and another three-quarters,
with repetition and additions, in delivery. They dined then quite
happily.</p>
<p>So passed the winter. Eugene was three; they bought him
alphabet books, and animal pictures, with rhymed fables below.
Gant read them to him indefatigably: in six weeks he knew them
all by memory.</p>
<p>Through the late winter and spring he performed numberless
times for the neighbors: holding the book in his hands he
pretended to read what he knew by heart. Gant was delighted: he
abetted the deception. Every one thought it extraordinary that a
child should read so young.</p>
<p>In the Spring Gant began to drink again; his thirst withered,
however, in two or three weeks, and shamefacedly he took up the
routine of his life. But Eliza was preparing for a change.</p>
<p>It was 1904; there was in preparation a great world's
exposition at Saint Louis: it was to be the visual history of
civilization, bigger, better, and greater than anything of its
kind ever known before. Many of the Altamont people intended to
go: Eliza was fascinated at the prospect of combining travel with
profit.</p>
<p>"Do you know what?" she began thoughtfully one night, as she
laid down the paper, "I've a good notion to pack up and go."</p>
<p>"Go? Go where?"</p>
<p>"To Saint Louis," she answered. "Why, say&mdash;if things work
out all right, we might simply pull out and settle down there."
She knew that the suggestion of a total disruption of the
established life, a voyage to new lands, a new quest of fortune
fascinated him. It had been talked of years before when he had
broken his partnership with Will Pentland.</p>
<p>"What do you intend to do out there? How are the children
going to get along?"</p>
<p>"Why, sir," she began smugly, pursing her lips thoughtfully,
and smiling cunningly, "I'll simply get me a good big house and
drum up a trade among the Altamont people who are going."</p>
<p>"Merciful God, Mrs. Gant!" he howled tragically, "you surely
wouldn't do a thing like that. I beg you not to."</p>
<p>"Why, pshaw, Mr. Gant, don't be such a fool. There's nothing
wrong in keeping boarders. Some of the most respectable people in
this town do it." She knew what a tender thing his pride was: he
could not bear to be thought incapable of the support of his
family&mdash;one of his most frequent boasts was that he was "a
good provider." Further, the residence of any one under his roof
not of his blood and bone sowed the air about with menace,
breached his castle walls. Finally, he had a particular revulsion
against lodgers: to earn one's living by accepting the contempt,
the scorn, and the money of what he called "cheap boarders" was
an almost unendurable ignominy.</p>
<p>She knew this but she could not understand his feeling. Not
merely to possess property, but to draw income from it was part
of the religion of her family, and she surpassed them all by her
willingness to rent out a part of her home. She alone, in fact,
of all the Pentlands was willing to relinquish the little moated
castle of home; the particular secrecy and privacy of their walls
she alone did not seem to value greatly. And she was the only one
of them that wore a skirt.</p>
<p>Eugene had been fed from her breast until he was more than
three years old: during the winter he was weaned. Something in
her stopped; something began.</p>
<p>She had her way finally. Sometimes she would talk to Gant
thoughtfully and persuasively about the World's Fair venture.
Sometimes, during his evening tirades, she would snap back at him
using the project as a threat. Just what was to be achieved she
did not know. But she felt it was a beginning for her. And she
had her way finally.</p>
<p>Gant succumbed to the lure of new lands. He was to remain at
home: if all went well he would come out later. The prospect,
too, of release for a time excited him. Something of the old
thrill of youth touched him. He was left behind, but the world
lurked full of unseen shadows for a lonely man. Daisy was in her
last year at school: she stayed with him. But it cost him more
than a pang or two to see Helen go. She was almost fourteen.</p>
<p>In early April, Eliza departed, bearing her excited brood
about her, and carrying Eugene in her arms. He was bewildered at
this rapid commotion, but he was electric with curiosity and
activity.</p>
<p>The Tarkintons and Duncans streamed in: there were tears and
kisses. Mrs. Tarkinton regarded her with some awe. The whole
neighborhood was a bit bewildered at this latest turn.</p>
<p>"Well, well&mdash;you never can tell," said Eliza, smiling
tearfully and enjoying the sensation she had provided. "If things
go well we may settle down out there."</p>
<p>"You'll come back," said Mrs. Tarkinton with cheerful loyalty.
"There's no place like Altamont."</p>
<p>They went to the station in the street-car: Ben and Grover
gleefully sat together, guarding a big luncheon hamper. Helen
clutched nervously a bundle of packages. Eliza glanced sharply at
her long straight legs and thought of the half-fare.</p>
<p>"Say," she began, laughing indefinitely behind her hand, and
nudging Gant, "she'll have to scrooch up, won't she? They'll
think you're mighty big to be under twelve," she went on,
addressing the girl directly.</p>
<p>Helen stirred nervously.</p>
<p>"We shouldn't have done that," Gant muttered.</p>
<p>"Pshaw!" said Eliza. "No one will ever notice her."</p>
<p>He saw them into the train, disposed comfortably by the
solicitous Pullman porter.</p>
<p>"Keep your eye on them, George," he said, and gave the man a
coin. Eliza eyed it jealously.</p>
<p>He kissed them all roughly with his mustache, but he patted
his little girl's bony shoulders with his great hand, and hugged
her to him. Something stabbed sharply in Eliza.</p>
<p>They had an awkward moment. The strangeness, the absurdity of
the whole project, and the monstrous fumbling of all life, held
them speechless.</p>
<p>"Well," he began, "I reckon you know what you're doing."</p>
<p>"Well, I tell you," she said, pursing her lips, and looking
out the window, "you don't know what may come out of this."</p>
<p>He was vaguely appeased. The train jerked, and moved off
slowly. He kissed her clumsily.</p>
<p>"Let me know as soon as you get there," he said, and he strode
swiftly down the aisle.</p>
<p>"Good-by, good-by," cried Eliza, waving Eugene's small hand at
the long figure on the platform. "Children," she said, "wave
good-by to your papa." They all crowded to the window. Eliza
wept.</p>
<p>Eugene watched the sun wane and redden on a rocky river, and
on the painted rocks of Tennessee gorges: the enchanted river
wound into his child's mind forever. Years later, it was to be
remembered in dreams tenanted with elvish and mysterious beauty.
Stilled in great wonder, he went to sleep to the rhythmical
pounding of the heavy wheels.</p>
<p>They lived in a white house on the corner. There was a small
plot of lawn in front, and a narrow strip on the side next to the
pavement. He realized vaguely that it was far from the great
central web and roar of the city&mdash;he thought he heard some
one say four or five miles. Where was the river?</p>
<p>Two little boys, twins, with straight very blond heads, and
thin, mean faces, raced up and down the sidewalk before the house
incessantly on tricycles. They wore white sailor-suits, with blue
collars, and he hated them very much. He felt vaguely that their
father was a bad man who had fallen down an elevator shaft,
breaking his legs.</p>
<p>The house had a back yard, completely enclosed by a red board
fence. At the end was a red barn. Years later, Steve, returning
home, said: "That section's all built up out there now."
Where?</p>
<p>One day in the hot barren back yard, two cots and mattresses
had been set up for airing. He lay upon one luxuriously,
breathing the hot mattress, and drawing his small legs up lazily.
Luke lay upon the other. They were eating peaches.</p>
<p>A fly grew sticky on Eugene's peach. He swallowed it. Luke
howled with laughter.</p>
<p>"Swallowed a fly! Swallowed a fly!"</p>
<p>He grew violently sick, vomited, and was unable to eat for
some time. He wondered why he had swallowed the fly when he had
seen it all the time.</p>
<p>The summer came down blazing hot. Gant arrived for a few days,
bringing Daisy with him. One night they drank beer at the Delmar
Gardens. In the hot air, at a little table, he gazed thirstily at
the beaded foaming stein: he would thrust his face, he thought,
in that chill foam and drink deep of happiness. Eliza gave him a
taste; they all shrieked at his bitter surprised face.</p>
<p>Years later he remembered Gant, his mustache flecked with
foam, quaffing mightily at the glass: the magnificent gusto, the
beautiful thirst inspired in him the desire for emulation, and he
wondered if all beer were bitter, if there were not a period of
initiation into the pleasures of this great beverage.</p>
<p>Faces from the old half-forgotten world floated in from time
to time. Some of the Altamont people came and stayed at Eliza's
house. One day, with sudden recollective horror he looked up into
the brutal shaven face of Jim Lyda. He was the Altamont sheriff;
he lived at the foot of the hill below Gant. Once, when Eugene
was past two, Eliza had gone to Piedmont as witness in a trial.
She was away two days; he was left in care of Mrs. Lyda. He had
never forgotten Lyda's playful cruelty the first night.</p>
<p>Now, one day, this monster appeared again, by devilish
sleight, and Eugene looked up into the heavy evil of his face.
Eugene saw Eliza standing near Jim; and as the terror in the
small face grew, Jim made as if to put his hand violently upon
her. At his cry of rage and fear, they both laughed: for a blind
moment or two Eugene for the first time hated her: he was mad,
impotent with jealousy and fear.</p>
<p>At night the boys, Steve, Ben, and Grover, who had been sent
out at once to seek employment by Eliza, returned from the Fair
Grounds, chattering with the lively excitement of the day's
bustle. Sniggering furtively, they talked suggestively about the
Hoochy- Koochy: Eugene understood it was a dance. Steve hummed a
monotonous, suggestive tune, and writhed sensually. They sang a
song; the plaintive distant music haunted him. He learned it:</p>
<blockquote>"Meet me in Saint&mdash;Lou&mdash;iss,
loo&mdash;ee,<br>
Meet me at the Fair,<br>
If you see the boys and girlies,<br>
Tell them I'll be there.<br>
We will dance the Hoochy-Koochy&mdash;"</blockquote>
<p>and so on.</p>
<p>Sometimes, lying on a sunny quilt, Eugene grew conscious of a
gentle peering face, a soft caressing voice, unlike any of the
others in kind and quality, a tender olive skin, black hair,
sloeblack eyes, exquisite, rather sad, kindliness. He nuzzled his
soft face next to Eugene's, fondled and embraced him. On his
brown neck he was birth-marked with a raspberry: Eugene touched
it again and again with wonder. This was Grover&mdash;the
gentlest and saddest of the boys.</p>
<p>Eliza sometimes allowed them to take him on excursions. Once,
they made a voyage on a river steamer: he went below and from the
side- openings looked closely upon the powerful yellow snake,
coiling slowly and resistlessly past.</p>
<p>The boys worked on the Fair Grounds. They were call-boys at a
place called the Inside Inn. The name charmed him: it flashed
constantly through his brain. Sometimes his sisters, sometimes
Eliza, sometimes the boys pulled him through the milling jungle
of noise and figures, past the rich opulence and variety of the
life of the Fair. He was drugged in fantasy as they passed the
East India tea-house, and as he saw tall turbaned men who walked
about within and caught for the first time, so that he never
forgot, the slow incense of the East. Once in a huge building
roaring with sound, he was rooted before a mighty locomotive, the
greatest monster he had ever seen, whose wheels spun terrifically
in grooves, whose blazing furnaces, raining hot red coals into
the pit beneath, were fed incessantly by two grimed fire-painted
stokers. The scene burned in his brain like some huge splendor
out of Hell: he was appalled and fascinated by it.</p>
<p>Again, he stood at the edge of the slow, terrific orbit of the
Ferris Wheel, reeled down the blaring confusion of the midway,
felt his staggering mind converge helplessly into all the mad
phantasmagoria of the carnival; he heard Luke's wild story of the
snake-eater, and shrieked in agony when they threatened to take
him in.</p>
<p>Once Daisy, yielding to the furtive cat-cruelty below her mild
placidity, took him with her through the insane horrors of the
scenic railway; they plunged bottomlessly from light into roaring
blackness, and as his first yell ceased with a slackening of the
car, rolled gently into a monstrous lighted gloom peopled with
huge painted grotesques, the red maws of fiendish heads, the
cunning appearances of death, nightmare, and madness. His
unprepared mind was unrooted by insane fear: the car rolled
downward from one lighted cavern to another, and as his heart
withered to a pea, he heard from the people about him loud gusty
laughter, in which his sister joined. His mind, just emerging
from the unreal wilderness of childish fancy, gave way completely
in this Fair, and he was paralyzed by the conviction, which often
returned to him in later years, that his life was a fabulous
nightmare and that, by cunning and conspirate artifice, he had
surrendered all his hope, belief, and confidence to the lewd
torture of demons masked in human flesh. Half-sensible, and
purple with gasping terror, he came out finally into the warm and
practical sunlight.</p>
<p>His last remembrance of the Fair came from a night in early
autumn: with Daisy again he sat upon the driver's seat of a motor
bus, listening for the first time to the wonder of its labored
chugging, as they rolled, through ploughing sheets of rain,
around the gleaming roads, and by the Cascades, pouring their
water down before a white building jewelled with ten thousand
lights.</p>
<p>The summer had passed. There was the rustling of autumn winds,
a whispering breath of departed revelry: carnival was almost
done.</p>
<p>And now the house grew very still: he saw his mother very
little, he did not leave the house, he was in the care of his
sisters, and he was constantly admonished to silence.</p>
<p>One day Gant came back a second time. Grover was down with
typhoid.</p>
<p>"He said he ate a pear at the Fair grounds," Eliza repeated
the story for the hundredth time. "He came home and complained of
feeling sick. I put my hand on his head and he was burning up.
'Why, child,' I said, 'what on earth&mdash;?'"</p>
<p>Her black eyes brightened in her white face: she was afraid.
She pursed her lips and spoke hopefully.</p>
<p>"Hello, son," said Gant, casually entering the room; his heart
shrivelled as he saw the boy.</p>
<p>Eliza pursed her lips more and more thoughtfully after each
visit the doctor made; she seized every spare crumb of
encouragement and magnified it, but her heart was sick. Then one
night, tearing away the mask suddenly, she came swiftly from the
boy's room.</p>
<p>"Mr. Gant," she said in a whisper, pursing her lips. She shook
her white face at him silently as if unable to speak. Then,
rapidly, she concluded: "He's gone, he's gone, he's gone!"</p>
<p>Eugene was deep in midnight slumber. Some one shook him,
loosening him slowly from his drowsiness. Presently he found
himself in the arms of Helen, who sat on the bed holding him, her
morbid stricken little face fastened on him. She spoke to him
distinctly and slowly in a subdued voice, charged somehow with a
terrible eagerness:</p>
<p>"Do you want to see Grover?" she whispered. "He's on the
cooling board."</p>
<p>He wondered what a cooling board was; the house was full of
menace. She bore him out into the dimly lighted hall, and carried
him to the rooms at the front of the house. Behind the door he
heard low voices. Quietly she opened it; the light blazed
brightly on the bed. Eugene looked, horror swarmed like poison
through his blood. Behind the little wasted shell that lay there
he remembered suddenly the warm brown face, the soft eyes, that
once had peered down at him: like one who has been mad, and
suddenly recovers reason, he remembered that forgotten face he
had not seen in weeks, that strange bright loneliness that would
not return. O lost, and by the wind grieved, ghost, come back
again.</p>
<p>Eliza sat heavily on a chair, her face bent sideways on her
rested hand. She was weeping, her face contorted by the comical
and ugly grimace that is far more terrible than any quiet
beatitude of sorrow. Gant comforted her awkwardly but, looking at
the boy from time to time, he went out into the hall and cast his
arms forth in agony, in bewilderment.</p>
<p>The undertakers put the body in a basket and took it away.</p>
<p>"He was just twelve years and twenty days old," said Eliza
over and over, and this fact seemed to trouble her more than any
other.</p>
<p>"You children go and get some sleep now," she commanded
suddenly and, as she spoke, her eye fell on Ben who stood puzzled
and scowling, gazing in with his curious old-man's look. She
thought of the severance of the twins; they had entered life
within twenty minutes of each other; her heart was gripped with
pity at the thought of the boy's loneliness. She wept anew. The
children went to bed. For some time Eliza and Gant continued to
sit alone in the room. Gant leaned his face in his powerful
hands. "The best boy I had," he muttered. "By God, he was the
best of the lot."</p>
<p>And in the ticking silence they recalled him, and in the heart
of each was fear and remorse, because he had been a quiet boy,
and there were many, and he had gone unnoticed.</p>
<p>"I'll never be able to forget his birthmark," Eliza whispered,
"Never, never."</p>
<p>Then presently each thought of the other; they felt suddenly
the horror and strangeness of their surroundings. They thought of
the vine-wound house in the distant mountains, of the roaring
fires, the tumult, the cursing, the pain, of their blind and
tangled lives, and of blundering destiny which brought them here
now in this distant place, with death, after the carnival's
close.</p>
<p>Eliza wondered why she had come: she sought back through the
hot and desperate mazes for the answer:</p>
<p>"If I had known," she began presently, "if I had known how it
would turn out&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Never mind," he said, and he stroked her awkwardly. "By God!"
he added dumbly after a moment. "It's pretty strange when you
come to think about it."</p>
<p>And as they sat there more quietly now, swarming pity rose in
them&mdash;not for themselves, but for each other, and for the
waste, the confusion, the groping accident of life.</p>
<p>Gant thought briefly of his four and fifty years, his vanished
youth, his diminishing strength, the ugliness and badness of so
much of it; and he had the very quiet despair of a man who knows
the forged chain may not be unlinked, the threaded design
unwound, the done undone.</p>
<p>"If I had known. If I had known," said Eliza. And then: "I'm
sorry." But he knew that her sorrow at that moment was not for
him or for herself, or even for the boy whom idiot chance had
thrust in the way of pestilence, but that, with a sudden inner
flaming of her clairvoyant Scotch soul, she had looked cleanly,
without pretense for the first time, upon the inexorable tides of
Necessity, and that she was sorry for all who had lived, were
living, or would live, fanning with their prayers the useless
altar flames, suppliant with their hopes to an unwitting spirit,
casting the tiny rockets of their belief against remote eternity,
and hoping for grace, guidance, and delivery upon the spinning
and forgotten cinder of this earth. O lost.</p>
<p>They went home immediately. At every station Gant and Eliza
made restless expeditions to the baggage-car. It was gray
autumnal November: the mountain forests were quilted with dry
brown leaves. They blew about the streets of Altamont, they were
deep in lane and gutter, they scampered dryly along before the
wind.</p>
<p>The car ground noisily around the curve at the hill-top. The
Gants descended: the body had already been sent on from the
station. As Eliza came slowly down the hill, Mrs. Tarkinton ran
from her house sobbing. Her eldest daughter had died a month
before. The two women gave loud cries as they saw each other, and
rushed together.</p>
<p>In Gant's parlor, the coffin had already been placed on
trestles, the neighbors, funeral-faced and whispering, were
assembled to greet them. That was all.</p>
<h3>6</h3>
<p>The death of Grover gave Eliza the most terrible wound of her
life: her courage was snapped, her slow but powerful adventure
toward freedom was abruptly stopped. Her flesh seemed to turn
rotten when she thought of the distant city and the Fair: she was
appalled before the hidden adversary who had struck her down.</p>
<p>With her desperate sadness she encysted herself within her
house and her family, reclaimed that life she had been ready to
renounce, lived laborious days and tried to drink, in toil,
oblivion. But the dark lost face gleamed like a sudden and
impalpable faun within the thickets of memory: she thought of the
mark on his brown neck and wept.</p>
<p>During the grim winter the shadows lifted slowly. Gant brought
back the roaring fires, the groaning succulent table, the lavish
and explosive ritual of the daily life. The old gusto surged back
in their lives.</p>
<p>And, as the winter waned, the interspersed darkness in
Eugene's brain was lifted slowly, days, weeks, months began to
emerge in consecutive brightness; his mind came from the
confusion of the Fair: life opened practically.</p>
<p>Secure and conscious now in the guarded and sufficient
strength of home, he lay with well-lined belly before the
roasting vitality of the fire, poring insatiably over great
volumes in the bookcase, exulting in the musty odor of the
leaves, and in the pungent smell of their hot hides. The books he
delighted in most were three huge calf-skin volumes called
Ridpath's History of the World. Their numberless pages were
illustrated with hundreds of drawings, engravings, wood-cuts: he
followed the progression of the centuries pictorially before he
could read. The pictures of battle delighted him most of all.
Exulting in the howl of the beaten wind about the house, the
thunder of great trees, he committed himself to the dark storm,
releasing the mad devil's hunger all men have in them, which
lusts for darkness, the wind, and incalculable speed. The past
unrolled to him in separate and enormous visions; he built
unending legends upon the pictures of the kings of Egypt,
charioted swiftly by soaring horses, and something infinitely old
and recollective seemed to awaken in him as he looked on fabulous
monsters, the twined beards and huge beast-bodies of Assyrian
kings, the walls of Babylon. His brain swarmed with
pictures&mdash;Cyrus directing the charge, the spear-forest of
the Macedonian phalanx, the splintered oars, the numberless
huddle of the ships at Salamis, the feasts of Alexander, the
terrific melee of the knights, the shattered lances, the axe and
the sword, the massed pikemen, the beleaguered walls, the scaling
ladders heavy with climbing men hurled backward, the Swiss who
flung his body on the lances, the press of horse and foot, the
gloomy forests of Gaul and C&aelig;sarian conquests. Gant sat
farther away, behind him, swinging violently back and forth in a
stout rocker, spitting clean and powerful spurts of tobacco-juice
over his son's head into the hissing fire.</p>
<p>Or again, Gant would read to him with sonorous and florid
rhetoric passages from Shakespeare, among which he heard most
often Marc Antony's funeral oration, Hamlet's soliloquy, the
banquet scene in Macbeth, and the scene between Desdemona and
Othello before he strangles her. Or, he would recite or read
poetry, for which he had a capacious and retentive memory. His
favorites were: "O why should the spirit of mortal be proud"
("Lincoln's favorite poem," he was fond of saying); "'We are
lost,' the captain shouted, As he staggered down the stairs"; "I
remember, I remember, the house where I was born"; "Ninety and
nine with their captain, Rode on the enemy's track, Rode in the
gray light of morning, Nine of the ninety came back"; "The boy
stood on the burning deck"; and "Half a league, half a league,
half a league onward."</p>
<p>Sometimes he would get Helen to recite "Still sits the
schoolhouse by the road, a ragged beggar sunning; Around it still
the sumachs grow, and blackberry vines are running."</p>
<p>And when she had told how grasses had been growing over the
girl's head for forty years, and how the gray-haired man had
found in life's harsh school how few hated to go above him,
because, you see, they love him, Gant would sigh heavily, and say
with a shake of his head:</p>
<p>"Ah me! There was never a truer word spoken than that."</p>
<p>The family was at the very core and ripeness of its life
together. Gant lavished upon it his abuse, his affection, and his
prodigal provisioning. They came to look forward eagerly to his
entrance, for he brought with him the great gusto of living, of
ritual. They would watch him in the evening as he turned the
corner below with eager strides, follow carefully the
processional of his movements from the time he flung his
provisions upon the kitchen table to the re-kindling of his fire,
with which he was always at odds when he entered, and on to which
he poured wood, coal and kerosene lavishly. This done, he would
remove his coat and wash himself at the basin vigorously, rubbing
his great hands across his shaven, tough-bearded face with the
cleansing and male sound of sandpaper. Then he would thrust his
body against the door jamb and scratch his back energetically by
moving it violently to and fro. This done, he would empty another
half can of kerosene on the howling flame, lunging savagely at
it, and muttering to himself.</p>
<p>Then, biting off a good hunk of powerful apple tobacco, which
lay ready for his use on the mantel, he would pace back and forth
across his room fiercely, oblivious of his grinning family who
followed these ceremonies with exultant excitement, as he
composed his tirade. Finally, he would burst in on Eliza in the
kitchen, plunging to the heart of denunciation with a mad
howl.</p>
<p>His turbulent and undisciplined rhetoric had acquired, by the
regular convention of its usage, something of the movement and
directness of classical epithet: his similes were preposterous,
created really in a spirit of vulgar mirth, and the great comic
intelligence that was in the family&mdash;down to the
youngest&mdash;was shaken daily by it. The children grew to await
his return in the evening with a kind of exhilaration. Indeed,
Eliza herself, healing slowly and painfully her great hurt, got a
certain stimulation from it; but there was still in her a fear of
the periods of drunkenness, and latently, a stubborn and
unforgiving recollection of the past.</p>
<p>But, during that winter, as death, assaulted by the quick and
healing gaiety of children, those absolute little gods of the
moment, lifted itself slowly out of their hearts, something like
hopefulness returned to her. They were a life unto
themselves&mdash;how lonely they were they did not know, but they
were known to every one and friended by almost no one. Their
status was singular&mdash;if they could have been distinguished
by caste, they would probably have been called middle-class, but
the Duncans, the Tarkintons, all their neighbors, and all their
acquaintances throughout the town, never drew in to them, never
came into the strange rich color of their lives, because they had
twisted the design of all orderly life, because there was in them
a mad, original, disturbing quality which they did not suspect.
And companionship with the elect&mdash;those like the
Hilliards&mdash;was equally impossible, even if they had had the
gift or the desire for it. But they hadn't.</p>
<p>Gant was a great man, and not a singular one, because
singularity does not hold life in unyielding devotion to it.</p>
<p>As he stormed through the house, unleashing his gathered
bolts, the children followed him joyously, shrieking exultantly
as he told Eliza he had first seen her "wriggling around the
corner like a snake on her belly," or, as coming in from freezing
weather he had charged her and all the Pentlands with malevolent
domination of the elements.</p>
<p>"We will freeze," he yelled, "we will freeze in this hellish,
damnable, cruel and God-forsaken climate. Does Brother Will care?
Does Brother Jim care? Did the Old Hog, your miserable old
father, care? Merciful God! I have fallen into the hands of
fiends incarnate, more savage, more cruel, more abominable than
the beasts of the field. Hellhounds that they are, they will sit
by and gloat at my agony until I am done to death."</p>
<p>He paced rapidly about the adjacent wash-room for a moment,
muttering to himself, while grinning Luke stood watchfully
near.</p>
<p>"But they can eat!" he shouted, plunging suddenly at the
kitchen door. "They can eat&mdash;when some one else will feed
them. I shall never forget the Old Hog as long as I live.
Cr-unch, Cr-unch, Cr-unch,"&mdash;they were all exploded with
laughter as his face assumed an expression of insane gluttony,
and as he continued, in a slow, whining voice intended to
represent the speech of the late Major: "'Eliza, if you don't
mind I'll have some more of that chicken,' when the old scoundrel
had shovelled it down his throat so fast we had to carry him away
from the table."</p>
<p>As his denunciation reached some high extravagance the boys
would squeal with laughter, and Gant, inwardly tickled, would
glance around slyly with a faint grin bending the corners of his
thin mouth. Eliza herself would laugh shortly, and then exclaim
roughly: "Get out of here! I've had enough of your goings-on for
one night."</p>
<p>Sometimes, on these occasions, his good humor grew so
victorious that he would attempt clumsily to fondle her, putting
one arm stiffly around her waist, while she bridled, became
confused, and half-attempted to escape, saying: "Get away! Get
away from me! It's too late for that now." Her white embarrassed
smile was at once painful and comic: tears pressed closely behind
it. At these rare, unnatural exhibitions of affection, the
children laughed with constraint, fidgeted restlessly, and said:
"Aw, papa, don't."</p>
<p>Eugene, when he first noticed an occurrence of this sort, was
getting on to his fifth year: shame gathered in him in tangled
clots, aching in his throat; he twisted his neck about
convulsively, smiling desperately as he did later when he saw
poor buffoons or mawkish scenes in the theatre. And he was never
after able to see them touch each other with affection, without
the same inchoate and choking humiliation: they were so used to
the curse, the clamor, and the roughness, that any variation into
tenderness came as a cruel affectation.</p>
<p>But as the slow months, gummed with sorrow, dropped more
clearly, the powerful germinal instinct for property and freedom
began to reawaken in Eliza, and the ancient submerged struggle
between their natures began again. The children were growing
up&mdash;Eugene had found playmates&mdash;Harry Tarkinton and Max
Isaacs. Her sex was a fading coal.</p>
<p>Season by season, there began again the old strife of
ownership and taxes. Returning home, with the tax-collector's
report in his hand, Gant would be genuinely frantic with
rage.</p>
<p>"In the name of God, Woman, what are we coming to? Before
another year we'll all go to the poorhouse. Ah, Lord! I see very
well where it will all end. I'll go to the wall, every penny
we've got will go into the pockets of those accursed swindlers,
and the rest will come under the sheriff's hammer. I curse the
day I was ever fool enough to buy the first stick. Mark my words,
we'll be living in soup-kitchens before this fearful, this awful,
this hellish and damnable winter is finished."</p>
<p>She would purse her lips thoughtfully as she went over the
list, while he looked at her with a face of strained agony.</p>
<p>"Yes, it does look pretty bad," she would remark. And then:
"It's a pity you didn't listen to me last summer, Mr. Gant, when
we had a chance of trading in that worthless old Owenby place for
those two houses on Carter Street. We could have been getting
forty dollars a month rent on them ever since."</p>
<p>"I never want to own another foot of land as long as I live,"
he yelled. "It's kept me a poor man all my life, and when I die
they'll have to give me six feet of earth in Pauper's Field." And
he would grow broodingly philosophic, speaking of the vanity of
human effort, the last resting-place in earth of rich and poor,
the significant fact that we could "take none of it with us,"
ending perhaps with "Ah me! It all comes to the same in the end,
anyway."</p>
<p>Or, he would quote a few stanzas of Gray's Elegy, using that
encyclop&aelig;dia of stock melancholy with rather indefinite
application:</p>
<blockquote>"&mdash;Await alike th' inevitable hour,<br>
The paths of glory lead but to the grave."</blockquote>
<p>But Eliza sat grimly on what they had.</p>
<p>Gant, for all his hatred of land ownership, was proud of
living under his own shelter, and indeed proud in the possession
of anything that was sanctified by his usage, and that gave him
comfort. He would have liked ready and unencumbered
affluence&mdash;the possession of huge sums of money in the bank
and in his pocket, the freedom to travel grandly, to go before
the world spaciously. He liked to carry large sums of money in
his pocket, a practice of which Eliza disapproved, and for which
she reprimanded him frequently. Once or twice, when he was drunk,
he had been robbed: he would brandish a roll of bills about under
the stimulation of whisky, and dispense large sums to his
children&mdash;ten, twenty, fifty dollars to each, with maudlin
injunctions to "take it all! Take it all, God damn it!" But next
day he was equally assiduous in his demands for its return: Helen
usually collected it from the sometimes unwilling fingers of the
boys. She would give it to him next day. She was fifteen or
sixteen years old, and almost six feet high: a tall thin girl,
with large hands and feet, big-boned, generous features, behind
which the hysteria of constant excitement lurked.</p>
<p>The bond between the girl and her father grew stronger every
day: she was nervous, intense, irritable, and abusive as he was.
She adored him. He had begun to suspect that this devotion, and
his own response to it, was a cause more and more of annoyance to
Eliza, and he was inclined to exaggerate and emphasize it,
particularly when he was drunk, when his furious distaste for his
wife, his obscene complaint against her, was crudely balanced by
his maudlin docility to the girl.</p>
<p>And Eliza's hurt was deeper because she knew that just at this
time, when her slightest movement goaded him, did what was most
rawly essential in him reveal itself. She was forced to keep out
of his way, lock herself in her room, while her young daughter
victoriously subdued him.</p>
<p>The friction between Helen and Eliza was often acute: they
spoke sharply and curtly to each other, and were painfully aware
of the other's presence in cramped quarters. And, in addition to
the unspoken rivalry over Gant, the girl was in the same way,
equally, rasped by the temperamental difference of
Eliza&mdash;driven to fury at times by her slow, mouth-pursing
speech, her placidity, the intonations of her voice, the deep
abiding patience of her nature.</p>
<p>They fed stupendously. Eugene began to observe the food and
the seasons. In the autumn, they barrelled huge frosty apples in
the cellar. Gant bought whole hogs from the butcher, returning
home early to salt them, wearing a long work-apron, and rolling
his sleeves half up his lean hairy arms. Smoked bacons hung in
the pantry, the great bins were full of flour, the dark recessed
shelves groaned with preserved cherries, peaches, plums, quinces,
apples, pears. All that he touched waxed in rich pungent life:
his Spring gardens, wrought in the black wet earth below the
fruit trees, flourished in huge crinkled lettuces that wrenched
cleanly from the loamy soil with small black clots stuck to their
crisp stocks; fat red radishes; heavy tomatoes. The rich plums
lay bursted on the grass; his huge cherry trees oozed with heavy
gum jewels; his apple trees bent with thick green clusters. The
earth was spermy for him like a big woman.</p>
<p>Spring was full of cool dewy mornings, spurting winds, and
storms of intoxicating blossoms, and in this enchantment Eugene
first felt the mixed lonely ache and promise of the seasons.</p>
<p>In the morning they rose in a house pungent with breakfast
cookery, and they sat at a smoking table loaded with brains and
eggs, ham, hot biscuit, fried apples seething in their gummed
syrups, honey, golden butter, fried steak, scalding coffee. Or
there were stacked batter-cakes, rum-colored molasses, fragrant
brown sausages, a bowl of wet cherries, plums, fat juicy bacon,
jam. At the mid-day meal, they ate heavily: a huge hot roast of
beef, fat buttered lima- beans, tender corn smoking on the cob,
thick red slabs of sliced tomatoes, rough savory spinach, hot
yellow corn-bread, flaky biscuits, a deep-dish peach and apple
cobbler spiced with cinnamon, tender cabbage, deep glass dishes
piled with preserved fruits&mdash;cherries, pears, peaches. At
night they might eat fried steak, hot squares of grits fried in
egg and butter, pork-chops, fish, young fried chicken.</p>
<p>For the Thanksgiving and Christmas feasts four heavy turkeys
were bought and fattened for weeks: Eugene fed them with cans of
shelled corn several times a day, but he could not bear to be
present at their executions, because by that time their cheerful
excited gobbles made echoes in his heart. Eliza baked for weeks
in advance: the whole energy of the family focussed upon the
great ritual of the feast. A day or two before, the auxiliary
dainties arrived in piled grocer's boxes&mdash;the magic of
strange foods and fruits was added to familiar fare: there were
glossed sticky dates, cold rich figs, cramped belly to belly in
small boxes, dusty raisins, mixed nuts&mdash;the almond, pecan,
the meaty nigger-toe, the walnut, sacks of assorted candies,
piles of yellow Florida oranges, tangerines, sharp, acrid,
nostalgic odors.</p>
<p>Seated before a roast or a fowl, Gant began a heavy clangor on
his steel and carving knife, distributing thereafter Gargantuan
portions to each plate. Eugene feasted from a high chair by his
father's side, filled his distending belly until it was
drum-tight, and was permitted to stop eating by his watchful sire
only when his stomach was impregnable to the heavy prod of Gant's
big finger.</p>
<p>"There's a soft place there," he would roar, and he would
cover the scoured plate of his infant son with another heavy slab
of beef. That their machinery withstood this hammer-handed
treatment was a tribute to their vitality and Eliza's
cookery.</p>
<p>Gant ate ravenously and without caution. He was immoderately
fond of fish, and he invariably choked upon a bone while eating
it. This happened hundreds of times, but each time he would look
up suddenly with a howl of agony and terror, groaning and crying
out strongly while a half-dozen hands pounded violently on his
back.</p>
<p>"Merciful God!" he would gasp finally, "I thought I was done
for that time."</p>
<p>"I'll vow, Mr. Gant," Eliza was vexed. "Why on earth don't you
watch what you're doing? If you didn't eat so fast you wouldn't
always get choked."</p>
<p>The children, staring, but relieved, settled slowly back in
their places.</p>
<p>He had a Dutch love of abundance: again and again he described
the great stored barns, the groaning plenty of the
Pennsylvanians.</p>
<p>On his journey to California, he had been charmed in New
Orleans by the cheapness and profusion of tropical fruits: a
peddler offered him a great bunch of bananas for twenty-five
cents, and Gant had taken them at once, wondering desperately
later, as they moved across the continent, why, and what he was
going to do with them.</p>
<h3>7</h3>
<p>This journey to California was Gant's last great voyage. He
made it two years after Eliza's return from St. Louis, when he
was fifty-six years old. In the great frame was already stirring
the chemistry of pain and death. Unspoken and undefined there was
in him the knowledge that he was at length caught in the trap of
life and fixity, that he was being borne under in this struggle
against the terrible will that wanted to own the earth more than
to explore it. This was the final flare of the old hunger that
had once darkened in the small gray eyes, leading a boy into new
lands and toward the soft stone smile of an angel.</p>
<p>And he returned from nine thousand miles of wandering, to the
bleak bare prison of the hills on a gray day late in winter.</p>
<p>In the more than eight thousand days and nights of this life
with Eliza, how often had he been wakefully, soberly and
peripatetically conscious of the world outside him between the
hours of one and five A.M.? Wholly, for not more than nineteen
nights&mdash;one for the birth of Leslie, Eliza's first daughter;
one for her death twenty- six months later, cholera infantis; one
for the death of Major Tom Pentland, Eliza's father, in May,
1902; one for the birth of Luke; one, on the train westbound to
Saint Louis, en route to Grover's death; one for the death in the
Playhouse (1893) of Uncle Thaddeus Evans, an aged and devoted
negro; one, with Eliza, in the month of March, 1897, as
deathwatch to the corpse of old Major Isaacs; three at the end of
the month of July, 1897, when it was thought that Eliza, withered
to a white sheeting of skin upon a bone frame, must die of
typhoid; again in early April, 1903, for Luke, typhoid death
near; one for the death of Greeley Pentland, aged twenty-six,
congenial scrofulous tubercular, violinist, Pentlandian punster,
petty check-forger, and six weeks' jailbird; three nights, from
the eleventh to the fourteenth of January, 1905, by the rheumatic
crucifixion of his right side, participant in his own grief,
accuser of himself and his God; once in February, 1896, as death-
watch to the remains of Sandy Duncan, aged eleven; once in
September, 1895, penitentially alert and shamefast in the City
"calaboose"; in a room of the Keeley Institute at Piedmont, North
Carolina, June 7, 1896; on March 17, 1906, between Knoxville,
Tennessee, and Altamont, at the conclusion of a seven weeks'
journey to California.</p>
<p>How looked the home-earth then to Gant the Far-Wanderer? Light
crept grayly, melting on the rocky river, the engine smoke
streaked out on dawn like a cold breath, the hills were big, but
nearer, nearer than he thought. And Altamont lay gray and
withered in the hills, a bleak mean wintry dot. He stepped
carefully down in squalid Toytown, noting that everything was
low, near, and shrunken as he made his Gulliverian entry. He had
a roof-and-gulley high conviction; with careful tucked-in elbows
he weighted down the heated Toytown street-car, staring painfully
at the dirty pasteboard pebbledash of the Pisgah Hotel, the brick
and board cheap warehouses of Depot Street, the rusty clapboard
flimsiness of the Florence (Railway Men's) Hotel, quaking with
beef-fed harlotry.</p>
<p>So small, so small, so small, he thought. I never believed it.
Even the hills here. I'll soon be sixty.</p>
<p>His sallow face, thin-flanked, was hang-dog and afraid. He
stared wistful-sullenly down at the rattan seat as the car
screeched round into the switch at the cut and stopped; the
motorman, smoke- throated, slid the door back and entered with
his handle. He closed the door and sat down yawning.</p>
<p>"Where you been, Mr. Gant?"</p>
<p>"California," said Gant.</p>
<p>"Thought I hadn't seen you," said the motorman.</p>
<p>There was a warm electric smell and one of hot burnt
steel.</p>
<p>But two months dead! But two months dead! Ah, Lord! So it's
come to this. Merciful God, this fearful, awful, and damnable
climate. Death, death! Is it too late? A land of life, a flower
land. How clear the green clear sea was. And all the fishes
swimming there. Santa Catalina. Those in the East should always
go West. How came I here? Down, down&mdash;always down, did I
know where? Baltimore, Sydney&mdash;In God's name, why? The
little boat glass-bottomed, so you could look down. She lifted up
her skirts as she stepped down. Where now? A pair of pippins.</p>
<p>"Jim Bowles died while you were gone, I reckon," said the
motorman.</p>
<p>"What!" howled Gant. "Merciful God!" he clucked mournfully
downward. "What did he die of?" he asked.</p>
<p>"Pneumonia," said the motorman. "He was dead four days after
he was took down."</p>
<p>"Why, he was a big healthy man in the prime of life," said
Gant. "I was talking to him the day before I went away," he lied,
convincing himself permanently that this was true. "He looked as
if he had never known a day's sickness in his life."</p>
<p>"He went home one Friday night with a chill," said the
motorman, "and the next Tuesday he was gone."</p>
<p>There was a crescent humming on the rails. With his thick
glove finger he pushed away a clearing in the window-coated ice
scurf and looked smokily out on the raw red cut-bank. The other
car appeared abruptly at the end of the cut and curved with a
skreeking jerk into the switch.</p>
<p>"No, sir," said the motorman, sliding back the door, "you
never know who'll go next. Here to-day and gone to-morrow. Hit
gits the big 'uns first sometimes."</p>
<p>He closed the door behind him and jerkily opened three notches
of juice. The car ground briskly off like a wound toy.</p>
<p>In the prime of life, thought Gant. Myself like that some day.
No, for others. Mother almost eighty-six. Eats like a horse,
Augusta wrote. Must send her twenty dollars. Now in the cold
clay, frozen. Keep till Spring. Rain, rot, rain. Who got the job?
Brock or Saul Gudger? Bread out of my mouth. Do me to
death&mdash;the stranger. Georgia marble, sandstone base, forty
dollars.</p>
<blockquote>"A gracious friend from us is gone,<br>
A voice we loved is fled,<br>
But faith and memory lead us on:<br>
He lives; he is not dead."</blockquote>
<p>Four cents a letter. Little enough, God knows, for the work
you do. My letters the best. Could have been a writer. Like to
draw too. And all of mine! I would have heard if
anything&mdash;he would have told me. I'll never go that way. All
right above the waist. If anything happens it will be down below.
Eaten away. Whisky holes through all your guts. Pictures in
Cardiac's office of man with cancer. But several doctors have to
agree on it. Criminal offense if they don't. But, if worst comes
to worst&mdash;all that's outside. Get it before it gets up in
you. Still live. Old man Haight had a flap in his belly. Ladled
it out in a cup. McGuire&mdash;damned butcher. But he can do
anything. Cut off a piece here, sew it on there. Made the Hominy
man a nose with a piece of shinbone. Couldn't tell it. Ought to
be possible. Cut all the strings, tie them up again. While you
wait. Sort of job for McGuire&mdash;rough and ready. They'll do
it some day. After I'm gone. Things standing thus,
unknown&mdash;but kill you maybe. Bull's too big. Soon now the
Spring. You'd die. Not big enough. All bloody in her brain. Full
filling fountains of bull-milk. Jupiter and what's-her-name.</p>
<p>But westward now he caught a glimpse of Pisgah and the western
range. It was more spacious there. The hills climbed sunward to
the sun. There was width to the eye, a smoking sun-hazed
amplitude, the world convoluting and opening into the world, hill
and plain, into the west. The West for desire, the East for home.
To the east the short near mile-away hills reeked protectively
above the town. Birdseye, Sunset. A straight plume of smoke
coiled thickly from Judge Buck Sevier's smut-white clapboard
residence on the decent side of Pisgah Avenue, thin smoke-wisps
rose from the nigger shacks in the ravine below. Breakfast. Fried
brains and eggs with streaky rashers of limp bacon. Wake, wake,
wake, you mountain grills! Sleeps she yet, wrapped dirtily in
three old wrappers in stale, airless yellow-shaded cold. The
chapped hands sick-sweet glycerined. Gum-headed bottles,
hairpins, and the bits of string. No one may enter now.
Ashamed.</p>
<p>A paper-carrier, number 7, finished his route on the corner of
Vine Street, as the car stopped, turned eastwards now from Pisgah
Avenue toward the town core. The boy folded, bent, and flattened
the fresh sheets deftly, throwing the block angularly thirty
yards upon the porch of Shields the jeweller; it struck the
boarding and bounded back with a fresh plop. Then he walked off
with fatigued relief into time toward the twentieth century,
feeling gratefully the ghost-kiss of absent weight upon his now
free but still leaning right shoulder.</p>
<p>About fourteen, thought Gant. That would be Spring of 1864.
The mule camp at Harrisburg. Thirty a month and keep. Men stank
worse than mules. I was in third bunk on top. Gil in second. Keep
your damned dirty hoof out of my mouth. It's bigger than a
mule's. That was the man. If it ever lands on you, you bastard,
you'll think it is a mule's, said Gil. Then they had it. Mother
made us go. Big enough to work, she said. Born at the heart of
the world, why here? Twelve miles from Gettysburg. Out of the
South they came. Stove-pipe hats they had stolen. No shoes. Give
me a drink, son. That was Fitzhugh Lee. After the third day we
went over. Devil's Den. Cemetery Ridge. Stinking piles of arms
and legs. Some of it done with meat-saws. Is the land richer now?
The great barns bigger than the houses. Big eaters, all of us. I
hid the cattle in the thicket. Belle Boyd, the Beautiful Rebel
Spy. Sentenced to be shot four times. Took the despatches from
his pocket while they danced. Probably a little chippie.</p>
<p>Hog-chitlins and hot cracklin' bread. Must get some. The whole
hog or none. Always been a good provider. Little I ever had done
for me.</p>
<p>The car still climbing, mounted the flimsy cheap-boarded
brown-gray smuttiness of Skyland Avenue.</p>
<p>America's Switzerland. The Beautiful Land of the Sky. Jesus
God! Old Bowman said he'll be a rich man some day. Built up all
the way to Pasadena. Come on out. Too late now. Think he was in
love with her. No matter. Too old. Wants her out there. No fool
like&mdash;White bellies of the fish. A spring somewhere to wash
me through. Clean as a baby once more. New Orleans, the night Jim
Corbett knocked out John L. Sullivan. The man who tried to rob
me. My clothes and my watch. Five blocks down Canal Street in my
nightgown. Two A.M. Threw them all in a heap&mdash;watch landed
on top. Fight in my room. Town full of crooks and pickpockets for
prizefight. Make good story. Policeman half hour later. They come
out and beg you to come in. Frenchwomen. Creoles. Beautiful
Creole heiress. Steamboat race. Captain, they are gaining. I will
not be beaten. Out of wood. Use the bacon she said proudly. There
was a terrific explosion. He got her as she sank the third time
and swam to shore. They powder in front of the window, smacking
their lips at you. For old men better maybe. Who gets the
business there? Bury them all above ground. Water two feet down.
Rots them. Why not? All big jobs. Italy. Carrara and Rome. Yet
Brutus is an hon-or-able man. What's a Creole? French and
Spanish. Has she any nigger blood? Ask Cardiac?</p>
<p>The car paused briefly at the car-shed, in sight of its
stabled brothers. Then it moved reluctantly past the dynamic
atmosphere of the Power and Light Company, wheeling bluntly into
the gray frozen ribbon of Hatton Avenue, running gently up hill
near its end into the frore silence of the Square.</p>
<p>Ah, Lord! Well do I remember. The old man offered me the whole
piece for $1,000 three days after I arrived. Millionaire to-day
if&mdash;</p>
<p>The car passed the Tuskegee on its eighty-yard climb into the
Square. The fat slick worn leather-chairs marshalled between a
fresh-rubbed gleaming line of brass spittoons squatted massively
on each side of the entry door, before thick sheets of
plate-glass that extended almost to the sidewalks with indecent
nearness.</p>
<p>Many a fat man's rump upon the leather. Like fish in a glass
case. Travelling man's wet chewed cigar, spit-limp on his greasy
lips. Staring at all the women. Can't look back long. Gives
advantage.</p>
<p>A negro bellboy sleepily wafted a gray dust-cloth across the
leather. Within, before the replenished crackle-dance of the
wood- fire, the nightclerk sprawled out in the deep receiving
belly of a leather divan.</p>
<p>The car reached the Square, jolted across the netting of
north- south lines, and came to a halt on the north side, facing
east. Scurfing a patch away from the glazed window, Gant looked
out. The Square in the wan-gray frozen morning walled round him
with frozen unnatural smallness. He felt suddenly the cramped
mean fixity of the Square: this was the one fixed spot in a world
that writhed, evolved, and changed constantly in his vision, and
he felt a sick green fear, a frozen constriction about his heart
because the centre of his life now looked so shrunken. He got
very definitely the impression that if he flung out his arms they
would strike against the walls of the mean three-and-four-story
brickbuilt buildings that flanked the Square raggedly.</p>
<p>Anchored to earth at last, he was hit suddenly by the whole
cumulation of sight and movement, of eating, drinking, and acting
that had gathered in him for two months. The limitless land,
wood, field, hill, prairie, desert, mountain, the coast rushing
away below his eyes, the ground that swam before his eyes at
stations, the remembered ghosts of gumbo, oysters, huge Frisco
seasteaks, tropical fruits swarmed with the infinite life, the
ceaseless pullulation of the sea. Here only, in his
unreal-reality, this unnatural vision of what he had known for
twenty years, did life lose its movement, change, color.</p>
<p>The Square had the horrible concreteness of a dream. At the
far southeastern edge he saw his shop: his name painted hugely in
dirty scaly white across the brick near the roof: W. O.
Gant&mdash;Marbles, Tombstones, Cemetery Fixtures. It was like a
dream of hell, when a man finds his own name staring at him from
the Devil's ledger; like a dream of death, when he who comes as
mourner finds himself in the coffin, or as witness to a hanging,
the condemned upon the scaffold.</p>
<p>A sleepy negro employed at the Manor Hotel clambered heavily
up and slumped into one of the seats reserved for his race at the
back. In a moment he began to snore gently through his blubbered
lips.</p>
<p>At the east end of the Square, Big Bill Messler, with his vest
half-unbuttoned over his girdled paunch-belly, descended slowly
the steps of the City Hall, and moved soundingly off with country
leisure along the cold-metallic sidewalk. The fountain, ringed
with a thick bracelet of ice, played at quarter-strength a
sheening glut of ice-blue water.</p>
<p>Cars droned separately into their focal positions; the carmen
stamped their feet and talked smokily together; there was a
breath of beginning life. Beside the City Hall, the firemen slept
above their wagons: behind the bolted door great hoofs drummed
woodenly.</p>
<p>A dray rattled across the east end of the Square before the
City Hall, the old horse leaning back cautiously as he sloped
down into the dray market by the oblique cobbled passage at the
southeast that cut Gant's shop away from the market and
"calaboose." As the car moved eastward again, Gant caught an
angular view of Niggertown across this passage. The settlement
was plumed delicately with a hundred tiny fumes of smoke.</p>
<p>The car sloped swiftly now down Academy Street, turned, as the
upper edge of the negro settlement impinged steeply from the
valley upon the white, into Ivy Street, and proceeded north along
a street bordered on one side by smutty pebble-dash cottages, and
on the other by a grove of lordly oaks, in which the large
quaking plaster pile of old Professor Bowman's deserted School
for Young Ladies loomed desolately, turning and stopping at the
corner, at the top of the Woodson Street hill, by the great
wintry, wooden, and deserted barn of the Ivy Hotel. It had never
paid.</p>
<p>Gant kneed his heavy bag before him down the passage,
depositing it for a moment at the curbing before he descended the
hill. The unpaved frozen clay fell steeply and lumpily away. It
was steeper, shorter, nearer than he thought. Only the trees
looked large. He saw Duncan come out on his porch, shirtsleeved,
and pick up the morning paper. Speak to him later. Too long now.
As he expected, there was a fat coil of morning smoke above the
Scotchman's chimney, but none from his own.</p>
<p>He went down the hill, opening his iron gate softly, and going
around to the side entrance by the yard, rather than ascend the
steep veranda steps. The grape vines, tough and barren, writhed
about the house like sinewy ropes. He entered the sitting-room
quietly. There was a strong odor of cold leather. Cold ashes were
strewn thinly in the grate. He put his bag down and went back
through the wash-room into the kitchen. Eliza, wearing one of his
old coats, and a pair of fingerless woollen gloves, poked among
the embers of a crawling little fire.</p>
<p>"Well, I'm back," Gant said.</p>
<p>"Why, what on earth!" she cried as he knew she would, becoming
flustered and moving her arms indeterminately. He laid his hand
clumsily on her shoulder for a moment. They stood awkwardly
without movement. Then he seized the oil-can, and drenched the
wood with kerosene. The flame roared up out of the stove.</p>
<p>"Mercy, Mr. Gant," cried Eliza, "you'll burn us up!"</p>
<p>But, seizing a handful of cut sticks and the oil-can, he
lunged furiously toward the sitting-room.</p>
<p>As the flame shot roaring up from the oiled pine sticks, and
he felt the fire-full chimney-throat tremble, he recovered joy.
He brought back the width of the desert; the vast yellow serpent
of the river, alluvial with the mined accretions of the
continent; the rich vision of laden ships, masted above the
sea-walls, the world- nostalgic ships, bearing about them the
filtered and concentrated odors of the earth, sensual negroid rum
and molasses, tar, ripening guavas, bananas, tangerines,
pineapples in the warm holds of tropical boats, as cheap, as
profuse, as abundant as the lazy equatorial earth and all its
women; the great names of Louisiana, Texas, Arizona, Colorado,
California; the blasted fiend-world of the desert, and the
terrific boles of trees, tunnelled for the passage of a coach;
water that fell from a mountain-top in a smoking noiseless coil,
internal boiling lakes flung skywards by the punctual respiration
of the earth, the multitudinous torture in form of granite
oceans, gouged depthlessly by canyons, and iridescent with the
daily chameleon-shift beyond man, beyond nature, of terrific
colors, below the un-human iridescence of the sky.</p>
<p>Eliza, still excited, recovering speech, followed him into the
sitting-room, holding her chapped gloved hands clasped before her
stomach while she talked.</p>
<p>"I was saying to Steve last night, 'It wouldn't surprise me if
your papa would come rolling in at any minute now'&mdash;I just
had a feeling, I don't know what you'd call it," she said, her
face plucked inward by the sudden fabrication of legend, "but
it's pretty strange when you come to think of it. I was in
Garret's the other day ordering some things, some vanilla
extract, soda and a pound of coffee when Aleck Carter came up to
me. 'Eliza,' he said, 'when's Mr. Gant coming back&mdash;I think
I may have a job for him?' 'Why, Aleck,' I said, 'I don't much
expect him before the first of April.' Well, sir, what do you
know&mdash;I had no sooner got out on the street&mdash;I suppose
I must have been thinking of something else, because I remember
Emma Aldrich came by and hollered to me and I didn't think to
answer her until she had gone on by, so I called out just as big
as you please to her, 'Emma!'&mdash;the thing flashed over me all
of a sudden&mdash;I was just as sure of it as I'm standing
here&mdash;'what do you think? Mr. Gant's on his way back
home'."</p>
<p>Jesus God! thought Gant. It's begun again.</p>
<p>Her memory moved over the ocean-bed of event like a great
octopus, blindly but completely feeling its way into every
seacave, rill, and estuary, focussed on all she had done, felt
and thought, with sucking Pentlandian intentness, for whom the
sun shone, or grew dark, rain fell, and mankind came, spoke, and
died, shifted for a moment in time out of its void into the
Pentlandian core, pattern and heart of purpose.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, as he laid big gleaming lumps of coal upon the
wood, he muttered to himself, his mind ordering in a mounting
sequence, with balanced and climactic periods, his carefully
punctuated rhetoric.</p>
<p>Yes, musty cotton, bated and piled under long sheds of railway
sidings; and odorous pine woodlands of the level South, saturated
with brown faery light, and broken by the tall straight leafless
poles of trees; a woman's leg below an elegantly lifted skirt
mounting to a carriage in Canal Street (French or Creole
probably); a white arm curved reaching for a window shade,
French-olive faces window-glimmering, the Georgia doctor's wife
who slept above him going out, the unquenchable fish-filled
abundance of the unfenced, blue, slow cat-slapping lazy Pacific;
and the river, the all- drinking, yellow, slow-surging snake that
drained the continent. His life was like that river, rich with
its own deposited and onward-borne agglutinations, fecund with
its sedimental accretions, filled exhaustlessly by life in order
to be more richly itself, and this life, with the great purpose
of a river, he emptied now into the harbor of his house, the
sufficient haven of himself, for whom the gnarled vines wove
round him thrice, the earth burgeoned with abundant fruit and
blossom, the fire burnt madly.</p>
<p>"What have you got for breakfast?" he said to Eliza.</p>
<p>"Why," she said, pursing her lips meditatively, "would you
like some eggs?"</p>
<p>"Yes," said he, "with a few rashers of bacon and a couple of
pork sausages."</p>
<p>He strode across the dining-room and went up the hall.</p>
<p>"Steve! Ben! Luke! You damned scoundrels!" he yelled. "Get
up!"</p>
<p>Their feet thudded almost simultaneously upon the floor.</p>
<p>"Papa's home!" they shrieked.</p>
<p>Mr. Duncan watched butter soak through a new-baked roll. He
looked through his curtain angularly down, and saw thick acrid
smoke biting heavily into the air above Gant's house.</p>
<p>"He's back," said he, with satisfaction.</p>
<p>So, at the moment looking, Tarkinton of the paints said: "W.
O.'s back."</p>
<p>Thus came he home, who had put out to land westward, Gant the
Far- Wanderer.</p>
<h3>8</h3>
<p>Eugene was loose now in the limitless meadows of sensation:
his sensory equipment was so complete that at the moment of
perception of a single thing, the whole background of color,
warmth, odor, sound, taste established itself, so that later, the
breath of hot dandelion brought back the grass-warm banks of
Spring, a day, a place, the rustling of young leaves, or the page
of a book, the thin exotic smell of tangerine, the wintry bite of
great apples; or, as with Gulliver's Travels, a bright windy day
in March, the spurting moments of warmth, the drip and reek of
the earth-thaw, the feel of the fire.</p>
<p>He had won his first release from the fences of home&mdash;he
was not quite six, when, of his own insistence, he went to
school. Eliza did not want him to go, but his only close
companion, Max Isaacs, a year his senior, was going, and there
was in his heart a constricting terror that he would be left
alone again. She told him he could not go: she felt, somehow,
that school began the slow, the final loosening of the cords that
held them together, but as she saw him slide craftily out the
gate one morning in September and run at top speed to the corner
where the other little boy was waiting, she did nothing to bring
him back. Something taut snapped in her; she remembered his
furtive backward glance, and she wept. And she did not weep for
herself, but for him: the hour after his birth she had looked in
his dark eyes and had seen something that would brood there
eternally, she knew, unfathomable wells of remote and intangible
loneliness: she knew that in her dark and sorrowful womb a
stranger had come to life, fed by the lost communications of
eternity, his own ghost, haunter of his own house, lonely to
himself and to the world. O lost.</p>
<p>Busy with the ache of their own growing pains, his brothers
and sisters had little time for him: he was almost six years
younger than Luke, the youngest of them, but they exerted over
him the occasional small cruelties, petty tormentings by elder
children of a younger, interested and excited by the brief
screaming insanity of his temper when, goaded and taunted from
some deep dream, he would seize a carving knife and pursue them,
or batter his head against the walls.</p>
<p>They felt that he was "queer"&mdash;the other boys preached
the smug cowardice of the child-herd, defending themselves, when
their persecutions were discovered, by saying they would make a
"real boy" of him. But there grew up in him a deep affection for
Ben who stalked occasionally and softly through the house,
guarding even then with scowling eyes, and surly speech, the
secret life. Ben was a stranger: some deep instinct drew him to
his child-brother, a portion of his small earnings as a
paper-carrier he spent in gifts and amusement for Eugene,
admonishing him sullenly, cuffing him occasionally, but defending
him before the others.</p>
<p>Gant, as he watched his brooding face set for hours before a
firelit book of pictures, concluded that the boy liked books,
more vaguely, that he would make a lawyer of him, send him into
politics, see him elected to the governorship, the Senate, the
presidency. And he unfolded to him time after time all the rude
American legendry of the country boys who became great men
because they were country boys, poor boys, and hard-working farm
boys. But Eliza thought of him as a scholar, a learned man, a
professor, and with that convenient afterthought that annoyed
Gant so deeply, but by which she firmly convinced herself, she
saw in this book-brooder the fruit of her own deliberate
design.</p>
<p>"I read every moment I could get the chance the summer before
he was born," she said. And then, with a complacent and
confidential smile which, Gant knew, always preceded some
reference to her family, she said: "I tell you what: it may all
come out in the Third Generation."</p>
<p>"The Third Generation be Goddamned!" answered Gant
furiously.</p>
<p>"Now, I want to tell you," she went on thoughtfully, speaking
with her forefinger, "folks have always said that his grandfather
would have made a fine scholar if&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Merciful God!" said Gant, getting up suddenly and striding
about the room with an ironical laugh. "I might have known that
it would come to this! You may be sure," he exclaimed in high
excitement, wetting his thumb briefly on his tongue, "that if
there's any credit to be given I won't get it. Not from you!
You'd rather die than admit it! No, but I'll tell you what you
will do! You'll brag about that miserable old freak who never did
a hard day's work in his life."</p>
<p>"Now, I wouldn't be so sure of that if I were you," Eliza
began, her lips working rapidly.</p>
<p>"Jesus God!" he cried, flinging about the room with his
customary indifference to reasoned debate. "Jesus God! What a
travesty! A travesty on Nature! Hell hath no fury like a woman
scorned!" he exclaimed, indefinitely but violently, and then as
he strode about, he gave way to loud, bitter, forced
laughter.</p>
<p>Thus, pent in his dark soul, Eugene sat brooding on a fire-lit
book, a stranger in a noisy inn. The gates of his life were
closing him in from their knowledge, a vast aerial world of
fantasy was erecting its fuming and insubstantial fabric. He
steeped his soul in streaming imagery, rifling the book-shelves
for pictures and finding there such treasures as With Stanley in
Africa, rich in the mystery of the jungle, alive with combat,
black battle, the hurled spear, vast snake-rooted forests,
thatched villages, gold and ivory; or Stoddard's Lectures, on
whose slick heavy pages were stamped the most-visited scenes of
Europe and Asia; a Book of Wonder, with enchanting drawings of
all the marvels of the age&mdash;Santos Dumont and his balloon,
liquid air poured from a kettle, all the navies of the earth
lifted two feet from the water by an ounce of radium (Sir William
Crookes), the building of the Eiffel Tower, the Flatiron
Building, the stick-steered automobile, the submarine. After the
earthquake in San Francisco there was a book describing it, its
cheap green cover lurid with crumbling towers, shaken spires,
toppling many-storied houses plunging into the splitting
flame-jawed earth. And there was another called Palaces of Sin,
or The Devil in Society, purporting to be the work of a pious
millionaire, who had drained his vast fortune in exposing the
painted sores that blemish the spotless-seeming hide of great
position, and there were enticing pictures showing the author
walking in a silk hat down a street full of magnificent palaces
of sin.</p>
<p>Out of this strange jumbled gallery of pictures the pieced-out
world was expanding under the brooding power of his imagination:
the lost dark angels of the Dor&eacute; "Milton" swooped into
cavernous Hell beyond this upper earth of soaring or toppling
spires, machine wonder, maced and mailed romance. And, as he
thought of his future liberation into this epic world, where all
the color of life blazed brightest far away from home, his heart
flooded his face with lakes of blood.</p>
<p>He had heard already the ringing of remote church bells over a
countryside on Sunday night; had listened to the earth steeped in
the brooding of dark, and the million-noted little night things;
and he had heard thus the far retreating wail of a whistle in a
distant valley, and faint thunder on the rails; and he felt the
infinite depth and width of the golden world in the brief
seductions of a thousand multiplex and mixed mysterious odors and
sensations, weaving, with a blinding interplay and aural
explosions, one into the other.</p>
<p>He remembered yet the East India Tea House at the Fair, the
sandalwood, the turbans, and the robes, the cool interior and the
smell of India tea; and he had felt now the nostalgic thrill of
dew-wet mornings in Spring, the cherry scent, the cool clarion
earth, the wet loaminess of the garden, the pungent breakfast
smells and the floating snow of blossoms. He knew the inchoate
sharp excitement of hot dandelions in young Spring grass at noon;
the smell of cellars, cobwebs, and built-on secret earth; in
July, of watermelons bedded in sweet hay, inside a farmer's
covered wagon; of cantaloupe and crated peaches; and the scent of
orange rind, bittersweet, before a fire of coals. He knew the
good male smell of his father's sitting-room; of the smooth worn
leather sofa, with the gaping horse-hair rent; of the blistered
varnished wood upon the hearth; of the heated calf-skin bindings;
of the flat moist plug of apple tobacco, stuck with a red flag;
of wood-smoke and burnt leaves in October; of the brown tired
autumn earth; of honey-suckle at night; of warm nasturtiums; of a
clean ruddy farmer who comes weekly with printed butter, eggs and
milk; of fat limp underdone bacon and of coffee; of a bakery-oven
in the wind; of large deep-hued stringbeans smoking-hot and
seasoned well with salt and butter; of a room of old pine boards
in which books and carpets have been stored, long closed; of
Concord grapes in their long white baskets.</p>
<p>Yes, and the exciting smell of chalk and varnished desks; the
smell of heavy bread-sandwiches of cold fried meat and butter;
the smell of new leather in a saddler's shop, or of a warm
leather chair; of honey and of unground coffee; of barrelled
sweet-pickles and cheese and all the fragrant compost of the
grocer's; the smell of stored apples in the cellar, and of
orchard-apple smells, of pressed-cider pulp; of pears ripening on
a sunny shelf, and of ripe cherries stewing with sugar on hot
stoves before preserving; the smell of whittled wood, of all
young lumber, of sawdust and shavings; of peaches stuck with
cloves and pickled in brandy; of pine-sap, and green
pine-needles; of a horse's pared hoof; of chestnuts roasting, of
bowls of nuts and raisins; of hot cracklin, and of young roast
pork; of butter and cinnamon melting on hot candied yams.</p>
<p>Yes, and of the rank slow river, and of tomatoes rotten on the
vine; the smell of rain-wet plums and boiling quinces; of rotten
lily-pads; and of foul weeds rotting in green marsh scum; and the
exquisite smell of the South, clean but funky, like a big woman;
of soaking trees and the earth after heavy rain.</p>
<p>Yes, and the smell of hot daisy-fields in the morning; of
melted puddling-iron in a foundry; the winter smell of horse-warm
stables and smoking dung; of old oak and walnut; and the
butcher's smell of meat, of strong slaughtered lamb, plump gouty
liver, ground pasty sausages, and red beef; and of brown sugar
melted with slivered bitter chocolate; and of crushed mint
leaves, and of a wet lilac bush; of magnolia beneath the heavy
moon, of dogwood and laurel; of an old caked pipe and Bourbon
rye, aged in kegs of charred oak; the sharp smell of tobacco; of
carbolic and nitric acids; the coarse true smell of a dog; of old
imprisoned books; and the cool fern- smell near springs; of
vanilla in cake-dough; and of cloven ponderous cheeses.</p>
<p>Yes, and of a hardware store, but mostly the good smell of
nails; of the developing chemicals in a photographer's dark-room;
and the young-life smell of paint and turpentine; of buckwheat
batter and black sorghum; and of a negro and his horse, together;
of boiling fudge; the brine smell of pickling vats; and the lush
undergrowth smell of southern hills; of a slimy oyster-can, of
chilled gutted fish; of a hot kitchen negress; of kerosene and
linoleum; of sarsaparilla and guavas; and of ripe autumn
persimmons; and the smell of the wind and the rain; and of the
acrid thunder; of cold starlight, and the brittle-bladed frozen
grass; of fog and the misted winter sun; of seed-time, bloom, and
mellow dropping harvest.</p>
<p>And now, whetted intemperately by what he had felt, he began,
at school, in that fecund romance, the geography, to breathe the
mixed odors of the earth, sensing in every squat keg piled on a
pier-head a treasure of golden rum, rich port, fat Burgundy;
smelling the jungle growth of the tropics, the heavy odor of
plantations, the salt-fish smell of harbors, voyaging in the
vast, enchanting, but unperplexing world.</p>
<p>Now the innumerable archipelago had been threaded, and he
stood, firm-planted, upon the unknown but waiting continent.</p>
<p>He learned to read almost at once, printing the shapes of
words immediately with his strong visual memory; but it was weeks
later before he learned to write, or even to copy, words. The
ragged spume and wrack of fantasy and the lost world still
floated from time to time through his clear school-day morning
brain, and although he followed accurately all the other
instruction of his teacher, he was walled in his ancient
unknowing world when they made letters. The children made their
sprawling alphabets below a line of models, but all he
accomplished was a line of jagged wavering spear-points on his
sheet, which he repeated endlessly and rapturously, unable to see
or understand the difference.</p>
<p>"I have learned to write," he thought.</p>
<p>Then, one day, Max Isaacs looked suddenly, from his exercise,
on Eugene's sheet, and saw the jagged line.</p>
<p>"That ain't writin'," said he.</p>
<p>And clubbing his pencil in his waited grimy hand, he scrawled
a copy of the exercise across the page.</p>
<p>The line of life, that beautiful developing structure of
language that he saw flowing from his comrade's pencil, cut the
knot in him that all instruction failed to do, and instantly he
seized the pencil, and wrote the words in letters fairer and
finer than his friend's. And he turned, with a cry in his throat,
to the next page, and copied it without hesitation, and the next,
the next. They looked at each other a moment with that clear
wonder by which children accept miracles, and they never spoke of
it again.</p>
<p>"That's writin' now," said Max. But they kept the mystery
caged between them.</p>
<p>Eugene thought of this event later; always he could feel the
opening gates in him, the plunge of the tide, the escape; out it
happened like this one day at once. Still midget-near the live
pelt of the earth, he saw many things that he kept in fearful
secret, knowing that revelation would be punished with ridicule.
One Saturday in Spring, he stopped with Max Isaacs above a deep
pit in Central Avenue where city workmen were patching a broken
watermain. The clay walls of their pit were much higher than
their heads; behind their huddled backs there was a wide fissure,
a window in the earth which opened on some dark subterranean
passage. And as the boys looked, they gripped each other
suddenly, for past the fissure slid the flat head of an enormous
serpent; passed, and was followed by a scaled body as thick as a
man's; the monster slid endlessly on into the deep earth and
vanished behind the working and unwitting men. Shaken with fear
they went away, they talked about it then and later in hushed
voices, but they never revealed it.</p>
<p>He fell now easily into the School-Ritual; he choked his
breakfast with his brothers every morning, gulped scalding
coffee, and rushed off at the ominous warning of the final bell,
clutching a hot paper-bag of food, already spattered hungrily
with grease blots. He pounded along after his brothers, his heart
hammering in his throat with excitement and, as he raced into the
hollow at the foot of the Central Avenue hill, grew weak with
nervousness, as he heard the bell ringing itself to sleep,
jerking the slatting rope about in its dying echoes.</p>
<p>Ben, grinning evilly and scowling, would thrust his hand
against the small of his back and rush him screaming, but unable
to resist the plunging force behind, up the hill.</p>
<p>In a gasping voice he would sing the morning song, coming in
pantingly on the last round of a song the quartered class took up
at intervals:</p>
<blockquote>"&mdash;Merrily, merrily, merrily, merrily,<br>
Life is but a dream."</blockquote>
<p>Or, in the frosty Autumn mornings:</p>
<blockquote>"Waken, lords and ladies gay,<br>
On the mountain dawns the day."</blockquote>
<p>Or the Contest of the West Wind and the South Wind. Or the
Miller's Song:</p>
<blockquote>"I envy no man, no, not I,<br>
And no one envies me."</blockquote>
<p>He read quickly and easily; he spelled accurately. He did well
with figures. But he hated the drawing lesson, although the boxes
of crayons and paints delighted him. Sometimes the class would go
into the woods, returning with specimens of flowers and
leaves&mdash;the bitten flaming red of the maple, the brown pine
comb, the brown oak leaf. These they would paint; or in Spring a
spray of cherry- blossom, a tulip. He sat reverently before the
authority of the plump woman who first taught him: he was
terrified lest he do anything common or mean in her eyes.</p>
<p>The class squirmed: the little boys invented tortures or
scrawled obscenities to the little girls. And the wilder and more
indolent seized every chance of leaving the room, thus: "Teacher,
may I be excused?" And they would go out into the lavatory,
sniggering and dawdling about restlessly.</p>
<p>He could never say it, because it would reveal to her the
shame of nature.</p>
<p>Once, deathly sick, but locked in silence and dumb nausea, he
had vomited finally upon his cupped hands.</p>
<p>He feared and hated the recess periods, trembled before the
brawling confusion of the mob and the playground, but his pride
forbade that he skulk within, or secrete himself away from them.
Eliza had allowed his hair to grow long; she wound it around her
finger every morning into fat Fauntleroy curls; the agony and
humiliation it caused him was horrible, but she was unable or
unwilling to understand it, and mouth-pursingly thoughtful and
stubborn to all solicitation to cut it. She had the garnered
curls of Ben, Grover, and Luke stored in tiny boxes: she wept
sometimes when she saw Eugene's, they were the symbol of his
babyhood to her, and her sad heart, so keen in marking
departures, refused to surrender them. Even when his thick locks
had become the luxuriant colony of Harry Tarkinton's lice, she
would not cut them: she held his squirming body between her knees
twice a day and ploughed his scalp with a fine-toothed comb.</p>
<p>As he made to her his trembling passionate entreaties, she
would smile with an affectation of patronizing humor, make a
bantering humming noise in her throat, and say: "Why,
say&mdash;you can't grow up yet. You're my baby." Suddenly
baffled before the yielding inflexibility of her nature, which
could be driven to action only after incessant and maddening
prods, Eugene, screaming-mad with helpless fury, would understand
the cause of Gant's frenzy.</p>
<p>At school, he was a desperate and hunted little animal. The
herd, infallible in its banded instinct, knew at once that a
stranger had been thrust into it, and it was merciless at the
hunt. As the lunch-time recess came, Eugene, clutching his big
grease-stained bag, would rush for the playground pursued by the
yelping pack. The leaders, two or three big louts of advanced age
and deficient mentality, pressed closely about him, calling out
suppliantly, "You know me, 'Gene. You know me"; and still racing
for the far end, he would open his bag and hurl to them one of
his big sandwiches, which stayed them for a moment, as they fell
upon its possessor and clawed it to fragments, but they were upon
him in a moment more with the same yelping insistence, hunting
him down into a corner of the fence, and pressing in with
outstretched paws and wild entreaty. He would give them what he
had, sometimes with a momentary gust of fury, tearing away from a
greedy hand half of a sandwich and devouring it. When they saw he
had no more to give, they went away.</p>
<p>The great fantasy of Christmas still kept him devout. Gant was
his unwearied comrade; night after night in the late autumn and
early winter, he would scrawl petitions to Santa Claus, listing
interminably the gifts he wanted most, and transmitting each,
with perfect trust, to the roaring chimney. As the flame took the
paper from his hand and blew its charred ghost away with a howl,
Gant would rush with him to the window, point to the stormy
northern sky, and say: "There it goes! Do you see it?"</p>
<p>He saw it. He saw his prayer, winged with the stanch convoying
winds, borne northward to the rimed quaint gabels of Toyland,
into frozen merry Elfland; heard the tiny silver anvil-tones, the
deep- lunged laughter of the little men, the stabled cries of
aerial reindeer. Gant saw and heard them, too.</p>
<p>He was liberally dowered with bright-painted gimcracks upon
Christmas Day; and in his heart he hated those who advocated
"useful" gifts. Gant bought him wagons, sleds, drums,
horns&mdash;best of all, a small fireman's ladder wagon: it was
the wonder, and finally the curse, of the neighborhood. During
his unoccupied hours, he lived for months in the cellar with
Harry Tarkinton and Max Isaacs: they strung the ladders on wires
above the wagon, so that, at a touch, they would fall in accurate
stacks. They would pretend to doze in their quarters, as firemen
do, would leap to action suddenly, as one of them imitated the
warning bell: "Clang- a-lang-a-lang." Then, quite beyond reason,
Harry and Max yoked in a plunging team, Eugene in the driver's
seat, they would leap out through the narrow door, gallop
perilously to a neighbor's house, throw up ladders, open windows,
effect entries, extinguish imaginary flames, and return oblivious
to the shrieking indictment of the housewife.</p>
<p>For months they lived completely in this fantasy, modelling
their actions on those of the town's firemen, and on Jannadeau,
who was the assistant chief, child-proud over it: they had seen
him, at the sound of the alarm, rush like a madman from his
window in Gant's shop, leaving the spattered fragments of a watch
upon his desk, and arriving at his duty just as the great wagon
hurtled at full speed into the Square. The firemen loved to stage
the most daring exhibitions before the gaping citizenry; helmeted
magnificently, they hung from the wagons in gymnastic postures,
one man holding another over rushing space, while number two
caught in mid-air the diving heavy body of the Swiss, who
deliberately risked his neck as he leaped for the rail. Thus, for
one rapturous moment they stood poised triangularly over rocking
speed: the spine of the town was chilled ecstatically.</p>
<p>And when the bells broke through the drowning winds at night,
his demon rushed into his heart, bursting all cords that held him
to the earth, promising him isolation and dominance over sea and
land, inhabitation of the dark: he looked down on the whirling
disk of dark forest and field, sloped over singing pines upon a
huddled town, and carried its grated guarded fires against its
own roofs, swerving and pouncing with his haltered storm upon
their doomed and flaming walls, howling with thin laughter above
their stricken heads and, fiend-voiced, calling down the bullet
wind.</p>
<p>Or, holding in fief the storm and the dark and all the black
powers of wizardry, to gaze, ghoul-visaged, through a
storm-lashed windowpane, briefly planting unutterable horror in
grouped and sheltered life; or, no more than a man, but holding,
in your more than mortal heart, demoniac ecstasy, to crouch
against a lonely storm-swept house, to gaze obliquely through the
streaming glass upon a woman, or your enemy, and while still
exulting in your victorious dark all-seeing isolation, to feel a
touch upon your shoulder, and to look, haunter-haunted,
pursuer-pursued, into the green corrupted hell-face of malignant
death.</p>
<p>Yes, and a world of bedded women, fair glimmers in the panting
darkness, while winds shook the house, and he arrived across the
world between the fragrant columns of delight. The great mystery
of their bodies groped darkly in him, but he had found there, at
the school, instructors to desire&mdash;the hair-faced louts of
Doubleday. They struck fear and wonder into the hearts of the
smaller, gentler boys, for Doubleday was that infested region of
the town-grown mountaineers, who lurked viciously through the
night, and came at Hallowe'en to break the skulls of other gangs
in rock warfare.</p>
<p>There was a boy named Otto Krause, a cheese-nosed, hair-faced,
inch-browed German boy, lean and swift in the legs, hoarse-voiced
and full of idiot laughter, who showed him the gardens of
delight. There was a girl named Bessie Barnes, a black-haired,
tall, bold- figured girl of thirteen years who acted as model.
Otto Krause was fourteen, Eugene was eight: they were in the
third grade. The German boy sat next to him, drew obscenities on
his books, and passed his furtive scrawled indecencies across the
aisle to Bessie.</p>
<p>And the nymph would answer with a lewd face, and a
contemptuous blow against her shapely lifted buttock, a gesture
which Otto considered as good as a promise, and which tickled him
into hoarse sniggers.</p>
<p>Bessie walked in his brain.</p>
<p>In their furtive moments at school, he and Otto amused each
other by drawing obscenities in their geographies, bestowing on
the representations of tropical natives sagging breasts and huge
organs. And they composed on tiny scraps of paper dirty little
rhymes about teachers and principal. Their teacher was a gaunt
red-faced spinster, with fierce glaring eyes: Eugene thought
always of the soldier and the tinder and the dogs he had to pass,
with eyes like saucers, windmills, the moon. Her name was Miss
Groody, and Otto, with the idiot vulgarity of little boys, wrote
of her:</p>
<blockquote>"Old Miss Groody<br>
Has Good Toody."</blockquote>
<p>And Eugene, directing his fire against the principal, a plump,
soft, foppish young man whose name was Armstrong, and who wore
always a carnation in his coat, which, after whipping an
offending boy, he was accustomed to hold delicately between his
fingers, sniffing it with sensitive nostrils and lidded eyes,
produced in the first rich joy of creation scores of rhymes, all
to the discredit of Armstrong, his parentage, and his relations
with Miss Groody.</p>
<p>He was obsessed; he spent the entire day now in the
composition of poetry&mdash;all bawdy variations of a theme. And
he could not bring himself to destroy them. His desk was stuffed
with tiny crumpled balls of writing: one day, during the
geography lesson, the woman caught him. His bones turned to
rubber as she bore down on him glaring, and took from the
concealing pages of his book the paper on which he had been
writing. At recess she cleared his desk, read the sequence, and,
with boding quietness, bade him to see the principal after
school.</p>
<p>"What does it mean? What do you reckon it means?" he whispered
dryly to Otto Krause.</p>
<p>"Oh, you'll ketch it now!" said Otto Krause, laughing
hoarsely.</p>
<p>And the class tormented him slily, rubbing their bottoms when
they caught his eye, and making grimaces of agony.</p>
<p>He was sick through to his guts. He had a loathing of physical
humiliation which was not based on fear, from which he never
recovered. The brazen insensitive spirit of the boys he envied
but could not imitate: they would howl loudly under punishment,
in order to mitigate it, and they were vaingloriously unconcerned
ten minutes later. He did not think he could endure being whipped
by the fat young man with the flower: at three o'clock,
white-faced, he went to the man's office.</p>
<p>Armstrong, slit-eyed and thin lipped, began to swish the cane
he held in his hand through the air as Eugene entered. Behind
him, smoothed and flatted on his desk, was stacked the damning
pile of rhymed insult.</p>
<p>"Did you write these?" he demanded, narrowing his eyes to
little points in order to frighten his victim.</p>
<p>"Yes," said Eugene.</p>
<p>The principal cut the air again with his cane. He had visited
Daisy several times, had eaten at Gant's plenteous board. He
remembered very well.</p>
<p>"What have I ever done to you, son, that you should feel this
way?" he said, with a sudden change of whining magnanimity.</p>
<p>"N-n-nothing," said Eugene.</p>
<p>"Do you think you'll ever do it again?" said he, becoming
ominous again.</p>
<p>"N-no, sir," Eugene answered, in the ghost of a voice.</p>
<p>"All right," said God, grandly, throwing away his cane. "You
can go."</p>
<p>His legs found themselves only when he had reached the
playground.</p>
<p>But oh, the brave autumn and the songs they sang; harvest, and
the painting of a leaf; and "half-holiday to-day"; and "up in the
air so high"; and the other one about the train&mdash;"the
stations go whistling past"; the mellow days, the opening gates
of desire, the smoky sun, the dropping patter of dead leaves.</p>
<p>"Every little snowflake is different in shape from every
other."</p>
<p>"Good grashus! ALL of them, Miss Pratt?"</p>
<p>"All of the little snowflakes that ever were. Nature never
repeats herself."</p>
<p>"Aw!"</p>
<p>Ben's beard was growing: he had shaved. He tumbled Eugene on
the leather sofa, played with him for hours, scraped his stubble
chin against the soft face of his brother. Eugene shrieked.</p>
<p>"When you can do that you'll be a man," said Ben.</p>
<p>And he sang softly, in his thin humming ghost's voice:</p>
<blockquote>"The woodpecker pecked at the schoolhouse door,<br>
He pecked and he pecked till his pecker got sore.<br>
The woodpecker pecked at the schoolhouse bell,<br>
He pecked and he pecked till his pecker got well."</blockquote>
<p>They laughed&mdash;Eugene with rocking throatiness, Ben with a
quiet snicker. He had aqueous gray eyes, and a sallow bumpy skin.
His head was shapely, the forehead high and bony. His hair was
crisp, maple-brown. Below his perpetual scowl, his face was
small, converging to a point: his extraordinarily sensitive mouth
smiled briefly, flickeringly, inwardly&mdash;like a flash of
light along a blade. And he always gave a cuff instead of a
caress: he was full of pride and tenderness.</p>
<h3>9</h3>
<p>Yes, and in that month when Prosperpine comes back, and Ceres'
dead heart rekindles, when all the woods are a tender smoky blur,
and birds no bigger than a budding leaf dart through the singing
trees, and when odorous tar comes spongy in the streets, and boys
roll balls of it upon their tongues, and they are lumpy with tops
and agated marbles; and there is blasting thunder in the night,
and the soaking millionfooted rain, and one looks out at morning
on a stormy sky, a broken wrack of cloud; and when the mountain
boy brings water to his kinsmen laying fence, and as the wind
snakes through the grasses hears far in the valley below the long
wail of the whistle, and the faint clangor of a bell; and the
blue great cup of the hills seems closer, nearer, for he had
heard an inarticulate promise: he has been pierced by Spring,
that sharp knife.</p>
<p>And life unscales its rusty weathered pelt, and earth wells
out in tender exhaustless strength, and the cup of a man's heart
runs over with dateless expectancy, tongueless promise,
indefinable desire. Something gathers in the throat, something
blinds him in the eyes, and faint and valorous horns sound
through the earth.</p>
<p>The little girls trot pigtailed primly on their dutiful way to
school; but the young gods loiter: they hear the reed, the
oatenstop, the running goathoofs in the spongy wood, here, there,
everywhere: they dawdle, listen, fleetest when they wait, go
vaguely on to their one fixed home, because the earth is full of
ancient rumor and they cannot find the way. All of the gods have
lost the way.</p>
<p>But they guarded what they had against the barbarians. Eugene,
Max, and Harry ruled their little neighborhood: they made war
upon the negroes and the Jews, who amused them, and upon the
Pigtail Alley people, whom they hated and despised. Catlike they
prowled about in the dark promise of night, sitting at times upon
a wall in the exciting glare of the corner lamp, which flared
gaseously, winking noisily from time to time.</p>
<p>Or, crouched in the concealing shrubbery of Gant's yard, they
waited for romantic negro couples climbing homewards, jerking by
a cord, as their victims came upon the spot, a stuffed black
snake- appearing stocking. And the dark was shrill with laughter
as the loud rich comic voices stammered, stopped, and
screamed.</p>
<p>Or they stoned the cycling black boy of the markets, as he
swerved down gracefully into an alley. Nor did they hate them:
clowns are black. They had learned, as well, that it was proper
to cuff these people kindly, curse them cheerfully, feed them
magnanimously. Men are kind to a faithful wagging dog, but he
must not walk habitually upon two legs. They knew that they must
"take nothin' off a nigger," and that the beginnings of argument
could best be scotched with a club and a broken head. Only, you
couldn't break a nigger's head.</p>
<p>They spat joyously upon the Jews. Drown a Jew and hit a
nigger.</p>
<p>The boys would wait on the Jews, follow them home shouting
"Goose Grease! Goose Grease!" which, they were convinced, was the
chief staple of Semitic diet; or with the blind acceptance of
little boys of some traditional, or mangled, or imaginary
catchword of abuse, they would yell after their muttering and
tormented victim: "Veeshamadye Veeshamadye!" confident that they
had pronounced the most unspeakable, to Jewish ears, of
affronts.</p>
<p>Eugene had no interest in pogroms, but it was a fetich with
Max. The chief object of their torture was a little furtive-faced
boy, whose name was Isaac Lipinski. They pounced cattishly at him
when he appeared, harried him down alleys, over fences, across
yards, into barns, stables, and his own house; he moved with
amazing speed and stealth, escaping fantastically, teasing them
to the pursuit, thumbing his fingers at them, and grinning with
wide Kike constant derision.</p>
<p>Or, steeped catlike in the wickedness of darkness, adrift in
the brooding promise of the neighborhood, they would cluster
silently under a Jew's home, grouped in a sniggering huddle as
they listened to the rich excited voices, the throaty
accentuation of the women; or convulsed at the hysterical
quarrels which shook the Jew-walls almost nightly.</p>
<p>Once, shrieking with laughter, they followed a running fight
through the streets between a young Jew and his father-in-law, in
which each was pursued and pummelled, or pursuing and pummelling;
and on the day when Louis Greenberg, a pale Jew returned from
college, had killed himself by drinking carbolic acid, they stood
curiously outside the dingy wailing house, shaken by sudden glee
as they saw his father, a bearded orthodox old Jew, clothed in
rusty, greasy black, and wearing a scarred derby, approach
running up the hill to his home, shaking his hands in the air,
and wailing rhythmically:</p>
<blockquote>"Oi, yoi yoi yoi yoi,<br>
Oi yoi yoi yoi yoi,<br>
Oi yoi yoi yoi yoi."</blockquote>
<p>But the whiteheaded children of Pigtail Alley they hated
without humor, without any mitigation of a most bitter and
alienate hate. Pigtail Alley was a muddy rut which sprawled down
hill off the lower end of Woodson Street, ending vaguely in the
rank stench of a green-scummed marsh bottom. On one side of this
vile road there was a ragged line of whitewashed shacks,
inhabited by poor whites, whose children were almost always
whitehaired, and who, snuff- mouthed bony women, and
tobacco-jawed men, sprawled stupidly in the sun-stench of their
rude wide-boarded porches. At night a smoky lamp burned dismally
in the dark interiors, there was a smell of frying cookery and of
unclean flesh, strident rasping shrews' cries, the drunken
maniacal mountain drawl of men: a scream and a curse.</p>
<p>Once, in the cherry time, when Gant's great White Wax was
loaded with its clusters, and the pliant and enduring boughs were
dotted thickly by the neighbor children, Jews and Gentiles alike,
who had been herded under the captaincy of Luke, and picked one
quart of every four for their own, one of these whitehaired
children had come doubtfully, mournfully, up the yard.</p>
<p>"All right, son," Luke, who was fifteen, called out in his
hearty voice. "Get a basket and come on up."</p>
<p>The child came up the gummed trunk like a cat: Eugene rocked
from the slender spiral topmost bough, exulting in his lightness,
the tree's resilient strength, and the great morning-clarion
fragrant backyard world. The Alley picked his bucket with
miraculous speed, skinned spryly to the ground and emptied it
into the heaping pan, and was halfway up the trunk again when his
gaunt mother streaked up the yard toward him.</p>
<p>"You, Reese," she shrilled, "what're you doin' hyar?" She
jerked him roughly to the ground and cut across his brown legs
with a switch. He howled.</p>
<p>"You git along home," she ordered, giving him another cut.</p>
<p>She drove him along, upbraiding him in her harsh voice,
cutting him sharply with the switch from moment to moment when,
desperate with pride and humiliation, he slackened his retreat to
a slow walk, or balked mulishly, howling again, and speeding a
few paces on his short legs, when cut by the switch.</p>
<p>The treed boys sniggered, but Eugene, who had seen the pain
upon the gaunt hard face of the woman, the furious pity of her
blazing eyes, felt something open and burst stabbingly in him
like an abscess.</p>
<p>"He left his cherries," he said to his brother.</p>
<p>Or, they jeered Loney Shytle, who left a stale sharp odor as
she passed, her dirty dun hair covered in a wide plumed hat, her
heels out of her dirty white stockings. She had caused incestuous
rivalry between her father and her brother, she bore the scar of
her mother's razor in her neck, and she walked, in her rundown
shoes, with the wide stiff-legged hobble of disease.</p>
<p>One day as they pressed round a trapped alley boy, who backed
slowly, fearfully, resentfully into a reeking wall, Willie
Isaacs, the younger brother of Max, pointing with sniggering
laughter, said:</p>
<p>"His mother takes in washin'."</p>
<p>And then, almost bent double by a soaring touch of humor, he
added:</p>
<p>"His mother takes in washin' from an ole nigger."</p>
<p>Harry Tarkinton laughed hoarsely. Eugene turned away
indefinitely, craned his neck convulsively, lifted one foot
sharply from the ground.</p>
<p>"She don't!" he screamed suddenly into their astounded faces.
"She don't!"</p>
<p>Harry Tarkinton's parents were English. He was three or four
years older than Eugene, an awkward, heavy, muscular boy,
smelling always of his father's paints and oils, coarse-featured,
meaty sloping jaw and a thick catarrhal look about his nose and
mouth. He was the breaker of visions; the proposer of iniquities.
In the cool thick evening grass of Gant's yard one sunset, he
smashed forever, as they lay there talking, the enchantment of
Christmas; but he brought in its stead the smell of paint, the
gaseous ripstink, the unadorned, sweating, and imageless passion
of the vulgar. But Eugene couldn't follow his barn-yard passion:
the strong hen- stench, the Tarkintonian paint-smell, and the
rank-mired branch- smell which mined under the filthy shambles of
the backyard, stopped him.</p>
<p>Once, in the deserted afternoon, as he and Harry plundered
through the vacant upper floor of Gant's house, they found a
half-filled bottle of hair-restorer.</p>
<p>"Have you any hairs on your belly?" said Harry.</p>
<p>Eugene hemmed; hinted timidly at shagginess; confessed. They
undid their buttons, smeared oily hands upon their bellies, and
waited through rapturous days for the golden fleece.</p>
<p>"Hair makes a man of you," said Harry.</p>
<p>More often, as Spring deepened, he went now to Gant's shop on
the Square. He loved the scene: the bright hill-cooled sun, the
blown sheets of spray from the fountain, the garrulous firemen
emerging from the winter, the lazy sprawling draymen on his
father's wooden steps, snaking their whips deftly across the
pavement, wrestling in heavy horseplay, Jannadeau in his dirty
fly-specked window prying with delicate monocled intentness into
the entrails of a watch, the reeking mossiness of Gant's
fantastical brick shack, the great interior dustiness of the main
room in front, sagging with gravestones&mdash;small polished
slabs from Georgia, blunt ugly masses of Vermont granite, modest
monuments with an urn, a cherub figure, or a couchant lamb,
ponderous fly-specked angels from Carrara in Italy which he
bought at great cost, and never sold&mdash;they were the joy of
his heart.</p>
<p>Behind a wooden partition was his ware-room, layered with
stonedust&mdash;coarse wooden trestles on which he carved
inscriptions, stacked tool-shelves filled with chisels, drills,
mallets, a pedalled emery wheel which Eugene worked furiously for
hours, exulting in its mounting roar, piled sandstone bases, a
small heat- blasted cast-iron stove, loose piled coal and
wood.</p>
<p>Between the workroom and the ware-room, on the left as one
entered, was Gant's office, a small room, deep in the dust of
twenty years, with an old-fashioned desk, sheaves of banded dirty
papers, a leather sofa, a smaller desk layered with round and
square samples of marble and granite. The sloping market Square,
pocketed obliquely off the public Square, and filled with the
wagons of draymen and county peddlers, and on the lower side on a
few Poor White houses and on the warehouse and office of Will
Pentland.</p>
<p>Eugene would find his father, leaning perilously on
Jannadeau's dirty glass showcase, or on the creaking little fence
that marked him off, talking politics, war, death, and famine,
denouncing the Democrats, with references to the bad weather,
taxation, and soup- kitchens that attended their administration,
and eulogizing all the acts, utterances, and policies of Theodore
Roosevelt. Jannadeau, guttural, judiciously reasonable,
statistically argumentative, would consult, in all disputed
areas, his library&mdash;a greasy edition of the World Almanac,
three years old, saying, triumphantly, after a moment of dirty
thumbing: "Ah&mdash;just as I thought: the muni-CIP-al taxation
of Milwaukee under De-MO-cratic administration in 1905 was $2.25
the hundred, the lowest it had been in years. I cannot ima-GINE
why the total revenue is not given." And he would argue with
animation, picking his nose with his blunt black fingers, his
broad yellow face breaking into flaccid creases, as he laughed
gutturally at Gant's unreason.</p>
<p>"And you may mark my words," proceeded Gant, as if he had
never been interrupted, and had heard no dissenting judgment, "if
they get in again we'll have soup-kitchens, the banks will go to
the wall, and your guts will grease your backbone before another
winter's over."</p>
<p>Or, he would find his father in the workroom, bending over a
trestle, using the heavy wooden mallet with delicate care, as he
guided the chisel through the mazes of an inscription. He never
wore work-clothes; he worked dressed in well brushed garments of
heavy black, his coat removed, and a long striped apron covering
all his front. As Eugene saw him, he felt that this was no common
craftsman, but a master, picking up his tools briefly for a chef-
d'oeuvre.</p>
<p>"He is better at this than any one in all the world," Eugene
thought, and his dark vision burned in him for a moment, as he
thought that his father's work would never, as men reckon years,
be extinguished, but that when that great skeleton lay powdered
in earth, in many a tangled undergrowth, in the rank wilderness
of forgotten churchyards, these letters would endure.</p>
<p>And he thought with pity of all the grocers and brewers and
clothiers who had come and gone, with their perishable work a
forgotten excrement, or a rotted fabric; or of plumbers, like
Max's father, whose work rusted under ground, or of painters,
like Harry's, whose work scaled with the seasons, or was
obliterated with newer brighter paint; and the high horror of
death and oblivion, the decomposition of life, memory, desire, in
the huge burial-ground of the earth stormed through his heart. He
mourned for all the men who had gone because they had not scored
their name upon a rock, blasted their mark upon a cliff, sought
out the most imperishable objects of the world and graven there
some token, some emblem that utterly they might not be
forgotten.</p>
<p>Again, Eugene would find Gant moving with bent strides across
the depth of the building, tearing madly along between the
sentinel marbles that aisled the ware-room, muttering, with hands
gripped behind him, with ominous ebb and flow. Eugene waited.
Presently, when he had shuttled thus across his shop some eighty
times, he would leap, with a furious howl, to his front door,
storming out upon the porch, and delivering his Jeremiad to the
offending draymen:</p>
<p>"You are the lowest of the low, the vilest of the vile. You
lousy good-for-nothing bums: you have brought me to the verge of
starvation, you have frightened away the little business that
might have put bread in my mouth, and kept the wolf from my door.
By God, I hate you, for you stink a mile off. You low
degenerates, you accursed reprobates; you would steal the pennies
from a dead man's eyes, as you have from mine, fearful, awful,
and bloodthirsty mountain grills that you are!"</p>
<p>He would tear back into the shop muttering, to return almost
at once, with a strained pretense at calmness, which ended in a
howl:</p>
<p>"Now I want to tell you: I give you fair warning once and for
all. If I find you on my steps again, I'll put you all in
jail."</p>
<p>They would disperse sheepishly to their wagons, flicking their
whips aimlessly along the pavements.</p>
<p>"By God, somethin's sure upset the ole man."</p>
<p>An hour later, like heavy buzzing flies, they would drift back
settling from nowhere on the broad steps.</p>
<p>As he emerged from the shop into the Square, they would greet
him cheerfully, with a certain affection.</p>
<p>"'Day, Mr. Gant."</p>
<p>"Good day, boys," he would answer kindly, absently. And he
would be away with his gaunt devouring strides.</p>
<p>As Eugene entered, if Gant were busy on a stone, he would say
gruffly, "Hello, son," and continue with his work, until he had
polished the surface of the marble with pumice and water. Then he
would take off his apron, put on his coat, and say, to the
dawdling, expectant boy: "Come on. I guess you're thirsty."</p>
<p>And they would go across the Square to the cool depth of the
drugstore, stand before the onyx splendor of the fountain, under
the revolving wooden fans, and drink chill gaseous beverages,
limeade so cold it made the head ache, or foaming ice-cream soda,
which returned in sharp delicious belches down his tender
nostrils.</p>
<p>Eugene, richer by twenty-five cents, would leave Gant then,
and spend the remainder of the day in the library on the Square.
He read now rapidly and easily; he read romantic and adventurous
novels, with a tearing hunger. At home he devoured Luke's piled
shelves of five-cent novels: he was deep in the weekly adventures
of Young Wild West, fantasied in bed at night of virtuous and
heroic relations with the beautiful Arietta, followed Nick
Carter, through all the mazes of metropolitan crime, Frank
Merriwell's athletic triumphs, Fred Fearnot, and the interminable
victories of The Liberty Boys of '76 over the hated Redcoats.</p>
<p>He cared not so much for love at first as he did for material
success: the straw figures of women in boys' books, something
with hair, dancing eyes, and virtuous opinions, impeccably good
and vacant, satisfied him completely: they were the guerdon of
heroism, something to be freed from villainy on the nick by a
blow or a shot, and to be enjoyed along with a fat income.</p>
<p>At the library he ravaged the shelves of boys' books, going
unweariedly through all the infinite monotony of the
Algers&mdash;Pluck and Luck, Sink or Swim, Grit, Jack's Ward, Jed
the Poor-house Boy&mdash;and dozens more. He gloated over the fat
money-getting of these books (a motif in boys' books that has
never been sufficiently recognized); all of the devices of
fortune, the loose rail, the signalled train, the rich reward for
heroism; or the full wallet found and restored to its owner; or
the value of the supposedly worthless bonds; or the discovery of
a rich patron in the city, sunk so deeply into his desires that
he was never after able to quench them.</p>
<p>And all the details of money&mdash;the value of the estate
usurped by the scoundrelly guardian and his caddish son, he
feasted upon, reckoning up the amount of income, if it were not
given, or if it were, dividing the annual sum into monthly and
weekly portions, and dreaming on its purchasing power. His
desires were not modest&mdash;no fortune under $250,000 satisfied
him: the income of $100,000 at six per cent would pinch one, he
felt, from lavishness; and if the reward of virtue was only
twenty thousand dollars, he felt bitter chagrin, reckoning life
insecure, and comfort a present warmth.</p>
<p>He built up a constant exchange of books among his companions,
borrowing and lending in an intricate web, from Max Isaacs, from
"Nosey" Schmidt, the butcher's son, who had all the rich
adventures of the Rover Boys; he ransacked Gant's shelves at
home, reading translations of the Iliad and the Odyssey at the
same time as Diamond Dick, Buffalo Bill, and the Algers, and for
the same reason; then, as the first years waned and the erotic
gropings became more intelligible, he turned passionately to all
romantic legendry, looking for women in whom blood ran hotly,
whose breath was honey, and whose soft touch a spurting train of
fire.</p>
<p>And in this pillage of the loaded shelves, he found himself
wedged firmly into the grotesque pattern of Protestant fiction
which yields the rewards of Dionysus to the loyal disciples of
John Calvin, panting and praying in a breath, guarding the
plumtree with the altar fires, outdoing the pagan harlot with the
sanctified hussy.</p>
<p>Aye, thought he, he would have his cake and eat it
too&mdash;but it would be a wedding-cake. He was devout in his
desire to be a good man; he would bestow the accolade of his love
upon nothing but a Virgin; he would marry himself to none but a
Pure Woman. This, he saw from the books, would cause no
renunciation of delight, for the good women were physically the
most attractive.</p>
<p>He had learned unknowingly what the exquisite voluptuary
finds, after weary toil, much later&mdash;that no condition of
life is so favorable to his enjoyment as that one which is
rigidly conventionalized. He had all the passionate fidelity of a
child to the laws of the community: all the filtered deposit of
Sunday Morning Presbyterianism had its effect.</p>
<p>He entombed himself in the flesh of a thousand fictional
heroes, giving his favorites extension in life beyond their
books, carrying their banners into the gray places of actuality,
seeing himself now as the militant young clergyman, arrayed, in
his war on slum conditions, against all the moneyed hostility of
his fashionable church, aided in his hour of greatest travail by
the lovely daughter of the millionaire tenement owner, and
winning finally a victory for God, the poor, and himself.</p>
<p>...They stood silently a moment in the vast deserted nave of
Saint Thomas'. Far in the depth of the vast church Old Michael's
slender hands pressed softly on the organ-keys. The last rays of
the setting sun poured in a golden shaft down through the western
windows, falling for a moment, in a cloud of glory, as if in
benediction, on Mainwaring's tired face.</p>
<p>"I am going," he said presently.</p>
<p>"Going?" she whispered. "Where?"</p>
<p>The organ music deepened.</p>
<p>"Out there," he gestured briefly to the West. "Out
there&mdash;among His people."</p>
<p>"Going?" She could not conceal the tremor of her voice.
"Going? Alone?"</p>
<p>He smiled sadly. The sun had set. The gathering darkness hid
the suspicious moisture in his gray eyes.</p>
<p>"Yes, alone," he said. "Did not One greater than I go out
alone some nineteen centuries ago?"</p>
<p>"Alone? Alone?" A sob rose in her throat and choked her.</p>
<p>"But before I go," he said, after a moment, in a voice which
he strove in vain to render steady, "I want to tell you&mdash;"
He paused for a moment, struggling for mastery of his
feelings.</p>
<p>"Yes?" she whispered.</p>
<p>"&mdash;That I shall never forget you, little girl, as long as
I live. Never." He turned abruptly to depart.</p>
<p>"No, not alone! You shall not go alone!" she stopped him with
a sudden cry.</p>
<p>He whirled as if he had been shot.</p>
<p>"What do you mean? What do you mean?" he cried hoarsely.</p>
<p>"Oh, can't you see! Can't you see!" She threw out her little
hands imploringly, and her voice broke.</p>
<p>"Grace! Grace! Dear heaven, do you mean it!"</p>
<p>"You silly man! Oh, you dear blind foolish boy! Haven't you
known for ages&mdash;since the day I first heard you preach at
the Murphy Street settlement?"</p>
<p>He crushed her to him in a fierce embrace; her slender body
yielded to his touch as he bent over her; and her round arms
stole softly across his broad shoulders, around his neck, drawing
his dark head to her as he planted hungry kisses on her closed
eyes, the column of her throat, the parted petal of her fresh
young lips.</p>
<p>"Forever," he answered solemnly. "So help me God."</p>
<p>The organ music swelled now into a triumphant p&aelig;an,
filling with its exultant melody that vast darkness of the
church. And as Old Michael cast his heart into the music, the
tears flowed unrestrained across his withered cheeks, but
smilingly happily through his tears, as dimly through his old
eyes he saw the two young figures enacting again the age-old tale
of youth and love, he murmured,</p>
<p>"I am the resurrection and the life, Alpha and Omega, the
first and the last, the beginning and the end"...</p>
<p>Eugene turned his wet eyes to the light that streamed through
the library windows, winked rapidly, gulped, and blew his nose
heavily. Ah, yes! Ah, yes!</p>
<p>...The band of natives, seeing now that they had no more to
fear, and wild with rage at the losses they had suffered, began
to advance slowly toward the foot of the cliff, led by Taomi,
who, dancing with fury, and hideous with warpaint, urged them on,
exhorting them in a shrill voice.</p>
<p>Glendenning cursed softly under his breath as he looked once
more at the empty cartridge belts, then grimly, as he gazed at
the yelling horde below, slipped his two remaining cartridges
into his Colt.</p>
<p>"For us?" she said, quietly. He nodded.</p>
<p>"It is the end?" she whispered, but without a trace of
fear.</p>
<p>Again he nodded, and turned his head away for a moment.
Presently he lifted his gray face to her.</p>
<p>"It is death, Veronica," he said, "and now I may speak."</p>
<p>"Yes, Bruce," she answered softly.</p>
<p>It was the first time he had ever heard her use his name, and
his heart thrilled to it.</p>
<p>"I love you, Veronica," he said. "I have loved you ever since
I found your almost lifeless body on the beach, during all the
nights I lay outside your tent, listening to your quiet breathing
within, love you most of all now in this hour of death when the
obligation to keep silence no longer rests upon me."</p>
<p>"Dearest, dearest," she whispered, and he saw her face was wet
with tears. "Why didn't you speak? I have loved you from the
first."</p>
<p>She leaned toward him, her lips half-parted and tremulous, her
breathing short and uncertain, and as his bare arms circled her
fiercely their lips met in one long moment of rapture, one final
moment of life and ecstasy, in which all the pent longing of
their lives found release and consummation now at this triumphant
moment of their death.</p>
<p>A distant reverberation shook the air. Glendenning looked up
quickly, and rubbed his eyes with astonishment. There, in the
island's little harbor were turning slowly the lean sides of a
destroyer, and even as he looked, there was another burst of
flame and smoke, and a whistling five-inch shell burst forty
yards from where the natives had stopped. With a yell of mingled
fear and baffled rage, they turned and fled off toward their
canoes. Already, a boat, manned by the lusty arms of a
blue-jacketed crew, had put off from the destroyer's side, and
was coming in toward shore.</p>
<p>"Saved! We are saved!" cried Glendenning, and leaping to his
feet he signalled the approaching boat. Suddenly he paused.</p>
<p>"Damn!" he muttered bitterly. "Oh, damn!"</p>
<p>"What is it, Bruce?" she asked.</p>
<p>He answered her in a cold harsh voice.</p>
<p>"A destroyer has just entered the harbor. We are saved, Miss
Mullins. Saved!" And he laughed bitterly.</p>
<p>"Bruce! Dearest! What is it? Aren't you glad? Why do you act
so strangely? We shall have all our life together."</p>
<p>"Together?" he said, with a harsh laugh. "Oh no, Miss Mullins.
I know my place. Do you think old J. T. Mullins would let his
daughter marry Bruce Glendenning, international vagabond, jack of
all trades, and good at none of them? Oh no. That's over now, and
it's good-by. I suppose," he said, with a wry smile, "I'll hear
of your marriage to some Duke or Lord, or some of those
foreigners some day. Well, good-by, Miss Mullins. Good luck.
We'll both have to go our own way, I suppose." He turned
away.</p>
<p>"You foolish boy! You dear bad silly boy!" She threw her arms
around his neck, clasped him to her tightly, and scolded him
tenderly. "Do you think I'll ever let you leave me now?"</p>
<p>"Veronica," he gasped. "Do you MEAN it?"</p>
<p>She tried to meet his adoring eyes, but couldn't: a rich wave
of rosy red mantled her cheek, he drew her rapturously to him
and, for the second time, but this time with the prophecy of
eternal and abundant life before them, their lips met in sweet
oblivion....</p>
<p>Ah, me! Ah, me! Eugene's heart was filled with joy and
sadness&mdash;with sorrow because the book was done. He pulled
his clotted handkerchief from his pocket and blew the contents of
his loaded heart into it in one mighty, triumphant and ecstatic
blast of glory and sentiment. Ah, me! Good old Bruce-Eugene.</p>
<p>Lifted, by his fantasy, into a high interior world, he scored
off briefly and entirely all the grimy smudges of life: he
existed nobly in a heroic world with lovely and virtuous
creatures. He saw himself in exalted circumstances with Bessie
Barnes, her pure eyes dim with tears, her sweet lips tremulous
with desire: he felt the strong handgrip of Honest Jack, her
brother, his truehearted fidelity, the deep eternal locking of
their brave souls, as they looked dumbly at each other with misty
eyes, and thought of the pact of danger, the shoulder-to-shoulder
drive through death and terror which had soldered them silently
but implacably.</p>
<p>Eugene wanted the two things all men want: he wanted to be
loved, and he wanted to be famous. His fame was chameleon, but
its fruit and triumph lay at home, among the people of Altamont.
The mountain town had for him enormous authority: with a child's
egotism it was for him the centre of the earth, the small but
dynamic core of all life. He saw himself winning Napoleonic
triumphs in battle, falling, with his fierce picked men, like a
thunderbolt upon an enemy's flank, trapping, hemming, and
annihilating. He saw himself as the young captain of industry,
dominant, victorious, rich; as the great criminal-lawyer bending
to his eloquence a charmed court&mdash;but always he saw his
return from the voyage wearing the great coronal of the world
upon his modest brows.</p>
<p>The world was a phantasmal land of faery beyond the misted hem
of the hills, a land of great reverberations, of genii-guarded
orchards, wine-dark seas, chasmed and fantastical cities from
which he would return into this substantial heart of life, his
native town, with golden loot.</p>
<p>He quivered deliciously to temptation&mdash;he kept his
titillated honor secure after subjecting it to the most trying
inducements: the groomed beauty of the rich man's wife, publicly
humiliated by her brutal husband, defended by Bruce-Eugene, and
melting toward him with all the pure ardor of her lonely and
womanly heart, pouring the sad measure of her life into his
sympathetic ears over the wineglasses of her candled, rich, but
intimate table. And as, in the shaded light, she moved yearningly
toward him, sheathed plastically in her gown of rich velvet, he
would detach gently the round arms that clung about his neck, the
firm curved body that stuck gluily to his. Or the blonde princess
in the fabulous Balkans, the empress of gabled Toyland, and the
Doll Hussars&mdash;he would renounce, in a great scene upon the
frontiers, her proffered renunciation, drinking eternal farewell
on her red mouth, but wedding her to himself and to the
citizenship of freedom when revolution had levelled her fortune
to his own.</p>
<p>But, steeping himself in ancient myths, where the will and the
deed were not thought darkly on, he spent himself, quilted in
golden meadows, or in the green light of woods, in pagan love. Oh
to be king, and see a fruity wide-hipped Jewess bathing on her
roof, and to possess her; or a cragged and castled baron, to
execute le droit de seigneur upon the choicest of the enfeoffed
wives and wenches, in a vast chamber loud with the howling winds
and lighted by the mad dancing flames of great logs!</p>
<p>But even more often, the shell of his morality broken to
fragments by his desire, he would enact the bawdy fable of
school-boys, and picture himself in hot romance with a handsome
teacher. In the fourth grade his teacher was a young,
inexperienced, but well-built woman, with carrot-colored hair,
and full of reckless laughter.</p>
<p>He saw himself, grown to the age of potency, a strong, heroic,
brilliant boy, the one spot of incandescence in a backwoods
school attended by snag-toothed children and hair-faced louts.
And, as the mellow autumn ripened, her interest in him would
intensify, she would "keep him in" for imaginary offenses,
setting him, in a somewhat confused way, to do some task, and
gazing at him with steady yearning eyes when she thought he was
not looking.</p>
<p>He would pretend to be stumped by the exercise: she would come
eagerly and sit beside him, leaning over so that a few fine
strands of carrot-colored hair brushed his nostrils, and so that
he might feel the firm warmth of her white-waisted arms, and the
swell of her tight-skirted thighs. She would explain things to
him at great length, guiding his fingers with her own warm,
slightly moist hand, when he pretended not to find the place;
then she would chide him gently, saying tenderly:</p>
<p>"Why are you such a bad boy?" or softly: "Do you think you're
going to be better after this?"</p>
<p>And he, simulating boyish, inarticulate coyness, would say:
"Gosh, Miss Edith, I didn't mean to do nothin'."</p>
<p>Later, as the golden sun was waning redly, and there was
nothing in the room but the smell of chalk and the heavy buzz of
the old October flies, they would prepare to depart. As he
twisted carelessly into his overcoat, she would chide him, call
him to her, arrange the lapels and his necktie, and smooth out
his tousled hair, saying:</p>
<p>"You're a good-looking boy. I bet all the girls are wild about
you."</p>
<p>He would blush in a maidenly way and she, bitten with
curiosity, would press him:</p>
<p>"Come on, now. Who's your girl?"</p>
<p>"I haven't got one, honest, Miss Edith."</p>
<p>"You don't want one of these silly little girls, Eugene," she
would say, coaxingly. "You're too good for them&mdash;you're a
great deal older than your years. You need the understanding a
mature woman can give you."</p>
<p>And they would walk away in the setting sun, skirting the
pine- fresh woods, passing along the path red with maple leaves,
past great ripening pumpkins in the fields, and under the golden
autumnal odor of persimmons.</p>
<p>She would live alone with her mother, an old deaf woman, in a
little cottage set back from the road against a shelter of lonely
singing pines, with a few grand oaks and maples in the
leaf-bedded yard.</p>
<p>Before they came to the house, crossing a field, it would be
necessary to go over a stile; he would go over first, helping her
down, looking ardently at the graceful curve of her long,
deliberately exposed, silk-clad leg.</p>
<p>As the days shortened, they would come by dark, or under the
heavy low-hanging autumnal moon. She would pretend to be
frightened as they passed the woods, press in to him and take his
arm at imaginary sounds, until one night, crossing the stile,
boldly resolved upon an issue, she would pretend difficulty in
descending, and he would lift her down in his arms. She would
whisper:</p>
<p>"How strong you are, Eugene." Still holding her, his hand
would shift under her knees. And as he lowered her upon the
frozen clotted earth, she would kiss him passionately, again and
again, pressing him to her, caressing him, and under the frosted
persimmon tree fulfilling and yielding herself up to his maiden
and unfledged desire.</p>
<p>"That boy's read books by the hundreds," Gant boasted about
the town. "He's read everything in the library by now."</p>
<p>"By God, W. O., you'll have to make a lawyer out of him.
That's what he's cut out for." Major Liddell spat accurately, out
of his high cracked voice, across the pavement, and settled back
in his chair below the library windows, smoothing his stained
white pointed beard with a palsied hand. He was a veteran.</p>
<h3>10</h3>
<p>But this freedom, this isolation in print, this dreaming and
unlimited time of fantasy, was not to last unbroken. Both Gant
and Eliza were fluent apologists for economic independence: all
the boys had been sent out to earn money at a very early age.</p>
<p>"It teaches a boy to be independent and self-reliant," said
Gant, feeling he had heard this somewhere before.</p>
<p>"Pshaw!" said Eliza. "It won't do them a bit of harm. If they
don't learn now, they won't do a stroke of work later on.
Besides, they can earn their own pocket money." This,
undoubtedly, was a consideration of the greatest importance.</p>
<p>Thus, the boys had gone out to work, after school hours, and
in the vacations, since they were very young. Unhappily, neither
Eliza nor Gant were at any pains to examine the kind of work
their children did, contenting themselves vaguely with the
comfortable assurance that all work which earned money was
honest, commendable, and formative of character.</p>
<p>By this time Ben, sullen, silent, alone, had withdrawn more
closely than ever into his heart: in the brawling house he came
and went, and was remembered, like a phantom. Each morning at
three o'clock, when his fragile unfurnished body should have been
soaked in sleep, he got up under the morning stars, departed
silently from the sleeping house, and went down to the roaring
morning presses and the inksmell that he loved, to begin the
delivery of his route. Almost without consideration by Gant and
Eliza he slipped quietly away from school after the eighth grade,
took on extra duties at the paper's office and lived, in
sufficient bitter pride, upon his earnings. He slept at home, ate
perhaps one meal a day there, loping home gauntly at night, with
his father's stride, thin long shoulders, bent prematurely by the
weight of the heavy paper bag, pathetically, hungrily
Gantian.</p>
<p>He bore encysted in him the evidence of their tragic fault: he
walked alone in the darkness, death and the dark angels hovered,
and no one saw him. At three-thirty in the morning, with his
loaded bag beside him, he sat with other route boys in a lunch
room, with a cup of coffee in one hand and a cigarette in the
other, laughing softly, almost noiselessly, with his flickering
exquisitely sensitive mouth, his scowling gray eyes.</p>
<p>At home he spent hours quietly absorbed in his life with
Eugene, playing with him, cuffing him with his white hard hands
from time to time, establishing with him a secret communication
to which the life of the family had neither access nor
understanding. From his small wages he gave the boy sums of
spending-money, bought him expensive presents on his birthdays,
at Christmas, or some special occasion, inwardly moved and
pleased when he saw how like M&aelig;cenas he seemed to Eugene,
how deep and inexhaustible to the younger boy were his meagre
resources. What he earned, all the history of his life away from
home, he kept in jealous secrecy.</p>
<p>"It's nobody's business but my own. By God, I'm not asking any
of you for anything," he said, sullenly and irritably, when Eliza
pressed him curiously. He had a deep scowling affection for them
all: he never forgot their birthdays, he always placed where they
might find it, some gift, small, inexpensive, selected with the
most discriminating taste. When, with their fervent
over-emphasis, they went through long ecstasies of admiration,
embroidering their thanks with florid decorations, he would jerk
his head sideways to some imaginary listener, laughing softly and
irritably, as he said:</p>
<p>"Oh for God's sake! Listen to this, won't you!"</p>
<p>Perhaps, as pigeon-toed, well creased, brushed,
white-collared, Ben loped through the streets, or prowled softly
and restlessly about the house, his dark angel wept, but no one
else saw, and no one knew. He was a stranger, and as he sought
through the house, he was always aprowl to find some entrance
into life, some secret undiscovered door&mdash;a stone, a
leaf,&mdash;that might admit him into light and fellowship. His
passion for home was fundamental, in that jangled and clamorous
household his sullen and contained quiet was like some soothing
opiate on their nerves: with quiet authority, white-handed skill,
he sought about repairing old scars, joining with delicate
carpentry old broken things, prying quietly about a
short-circuited wire, a defective socket.</p>
<p>"That boy's a born electrical engineer," said Gant. "I've a
good notion to send him off to school." And he would paint a
romantic picture of the prosperity of Mr. Charles Liddell, the
Major's worthy son, who earned thousands by his electrical
wizardry, and supported his father. And he would reproach them
bitterly, as he dwelt on his own merit and the worthlessness of
his sons:</p>
<p>"Other men's sons support their fathers in their old
age&mdash;not mine! Not mine! Ah Lord&mdash;it will be a bitter
day for me when I have to depend on one of mine. Tarkinton told
me the other day that Rafe has given him five dollars a week for
his food ever since he was sixteen. Do you think I could look for
such treatment from one of mine? Do you? Not until Hell freezes
over&mdash;and not then!" And he would refer to the hardships of
his own youth, cast out, so he said, to earn his living, at an
age which varied, according to his temper, at from six to eleven
years, contrasting his poverty to the luxury in which his own
children wallowed.</p>
<p>"No one ever did anything for me," he howled. "But
everything's been done for you. And what gratitude do I get from
you? Do you ever think of the old man who slaves up there in his
cold shop in order to give you food and shelter? Do you?
Ingratitude, more fierce than brutish beasts!" Remorseful food
stuck vengefully in Eugene's throat.</p>
<p>Eugene was initiated to the ethics of success. It was not
enough that a man work, though work was fundamental; it was even
more important that he make money&mdash;a great deal if he was to
be a great success&mdash;but at least enough to "support
himself." This was for both Gant and Eliza the base of worth. Of
so and so, they might say:</p>
<p>"He's not worth powder enough to kill him. He's never been
able to support himself," to which Eliza, but not Gant, might
add:</p>
<p>"He hasn't a stick of property to his name." This crowned him
with infamy.</p>
<p>In the fresh sweet mornings of Spring now, Eugene was howled
out of bed at six-thirty by his father, descended to the cool
garden, and there, assisted by Gant, filled small strawberry
baskets with great crinkled lettuces, radishes, plums, and green
apples&mdash;somewhat later, with cherries. With these packed in
a great hamper, he would peddle his wares through the
neighborhood, selling them easily and delightfully, in a world of
fragrant morning cookery, at five or ten cents a basket. He would
return home gleefully with empty hamper in time for breakfast: he
liked the work, the smell of gardens, of fresh wet vegetables; he
loved the romantic structure of the earth which filled his pocket
with chinking coins.</p>
<p>He was permitted to keep the money of his sales, although
Eliza was annoyingly insistent that he should not squander it,
but open a bank account with it with which, one day, he might
establish himself in business, or buy a good piece of property.
And she bought him a little bank, into which his reluctant
fingers dropped a portion of his earnings, and from which he got
a certain dreary satisfaction from time to time by shaking it
close to his ear and dwelling hungrily on all the purchasable
delight that was locked away from him in the small heavy
bullion-clinking vault. There was a key, but Eliza kept it.</p>
<p>But, as the months passed, and the sturdy child's body of his
infancy lengthened rapidly to some interior chemical expansion,
and he became fragile, thin, pallid, but remarkably tall for his
age, Eliza began to say: "That boy's big enough to do a little
work."</p>
<p>Every Thursday afternoon now during the school months, and
thence until Saturday, he was sent out upon the streets to sell
The Saturday Evening Post, of which Luke held the local agency.
Eugene hated the work with a deadly sweltering hatred; he watched
the approach of Thursday with sick horror.</p>
<p>Luke had been the agent since his twelfth year: his reputation
for salesmanship was sown through the town; he came with wide
grin, exuberant vitality, wagging and witty tongue, hurling all
his bursting energy into an insane extraversion. He lived
absolutely in event: there was in him no secret place, nothing
withheld and guarded&mdash;he had an instinctive horror of all
loneliness. He wanted above all else to be esteemed and liked by
the world, and the need for the affection and esteem of his
family was desperately essential. The fulsome praise, the
heartiness of hand and tongue, the liberal display of sentiment
were as the breath of life to him: he was overwhelmingly
insistent in the payment of drinks at the fountain, the
bringer-home of packed ice-cream for Eliza, and of cigars to Gant
and, as Gant gave publication to his generosity, the boy's need
for it increased&mdash;he built up an image of himself as the
Good Fellow, witty, unselfish, laughed at but liked by
all&mdash;as Big- Hearted Unselfish Luke. And this was the
opinion people had of him.</p>
<p>Many times in the years that followed, when Eugene's pockets
were empty, Luke thrust a coin roughly and impatiently in them,
but, hard as the younger boy's need might be, there was always an
awkward scene&mdash;painful, embarrassed protestations, a
distressful confusion because Eugene, having accurately and
intuitively gauged his brother's hunger for gratitude and esteem,
felt sharply that he was yielding up his independence to a
bludgeoning desire.</p>
<p>He had never felt the slightest shame at Ben's bounty: his
enormously sensitized perception had told him long since that he
might get the curse of annoyance, the cuff of anger, from his
brother, but that past indulgences would not be brandished over
him, and that even the thought of having bestowed gifts would
give Ben inward shame. In this, he was like Ben: the thought of a
gift he made, with its self-congratulatory implications, made him
writhe.</p>
<p>Thus, before he was ten, Eugene's brooding spirit was nettled
in the complexity of truth and seeming. He could find no words,
no answers to the puzzles that baffled and maddened him: he found
himself loathing that which bore the stamp of virtue, sick with
weariness and horror at what was considered noble. He was hurled,
at eight years, against the torturing paradox of the ungenerous-
generous, the selfish-unselfish, the noble-base, and unable to
fathom or define those deep springs of desire in the human spirit
that seek public gratification by virtuous pretension, he was
made wretched by the conviction of his own sinfulness.</p>
<p>There was in him a savage honesty, which exercised an
uncontrollable domination over him when his heart or head were
deeply involved. Thus, at the funeral of some remote kinsman, or
of some acquaintance of the family, for whom he had never
acquired any considerable affection, he would grow bitterly
shamefast if, while listening to the solemn drone of the
minister, or the sorrowful chanting of the singers, he felt his
face had assumed an expression of unfelt and counterfeited grief:
as a consequence he would shift about matter- of-factly, cross
his legs, gaze indifferently at the ceiling, or look out of the
window with a smile, until he was conscious his conduct had
attracted the attention of people, and that they were looking on
him with disfavor. Then, he felt a certain grim satisfaction as
if, although having lost esteem, he had recorded his life.</p>
<p>But Luke flourished hardily in all the absurd mummery of the
village: he gave heaping weight to every simulation of affection,
grief, pity, good-will, and modesty&mdash;there was no excess
that he did not underscore heavily, and the world's dull eye read
him kindly.</p>
<p>He spun himself outward with ceaseless exuberance: he was
genuinely and whole-heartedly involved. There was in him no
toilsome web that might have checked him, no balancing or
restraining weight&mdash;he had enormous energy, hungry
gregariousness, the passion to pool his life.</p>
<p>In the family, where a simple brutal tag was enough for the
appraisal of all fine consciences, Ben went simply as "the quiet
one," Luke as the generous and unselfish one, Eugene as the
"scholar." It served. The generous one, who had never in all his
life had the power to fasten his mind upon the pages of a book,
or the logic of number, for an hour together, resented, as he
see- sawed comically from one leg to another, stammering
quaintly, whistling for the word that stuck in his throat, the
brooding abstraction of the youngest.</p>
<p>"Come on, this is no time for day-dreaming," he would stammer
ironically. "The early bird catches the worm&mdash;it's time we
went out on the street."</p>
<p>And although his reference to day-dreams was only part of the
axiomatic mosaic of his speech, Eugene was startled and confused,
feeling that his secret world, so fearfully guarded, had been
revealed to ridicule. And the older boy, too, smarting from his
own dismal performances at school, convinced himself that the
deep inward turning of the spirit, the brooding retreat into the
secret place, which he recognized in the mysterious hypnotic
power of language over Eugene, was not only a species of
indolence, for the only work he recognized was that which
strained at weight or sweated in the facile waggery of the
tongue, but that it was moreover the indulgence of a "selfish"
family-forgetting spirit. He was determined to occupy alone the
throne of goodness.</p>
<p>Thus, Eugene gathered vaguely but poignantly, that other boys
of his age were not only self-supporting, but had for years kept
their decrepit parents in luxury by their earnings as electrical
engineers, presidents of banks, or members of Congress. There
was, in fact, no excess of suggestion that Gant did not use upon
his youngest son&mdash;he had felt, long since, the vibration to
every tremor of feeling of the million-noted little instrument,
and it pleased him to see the child wince, gulp, tortured with
remorse. Thus, while he piled high with succulent meat the boy's
platter, he would say sentimentally:</p>
<p>"I tell you what: there are not many boys who have what you
have. What's going to become of you when your old father's dead
and gone?" And he would paint a ghastly picture of himself lying
cold in death, lowered forever into the damp rot of the earth,
buried, forgotten&mdash;an event which, he hinted sorrowfully,
was not remote.</p>
<p>"You'll remember the old man, then," he would say. "Ah, Lord!
You never miss the water till the well goes dry," noting with
keen pleasure the inward convulsion of the childish throat, the
winking eyes, the tense constricted face.</p>
<p>"I'll vow, Mr. Gant," Eliza bridled, also pleased, "you
oughtn't to do that to the child."</p>
<p>Or, he would speak sadly of "Little Jimmy," a legless little
boy whom he had often pointed out to Eugene, who lived across the
river from Riverside, the amusement park, and around whom he had
woven a pathetic fable of poverty and orphanage which was
desperately real now to his son. When Eugene was six, Gant had
promised him carelessly a pony for Christmas, without any
intention of fulfilling his promise. As Christmas neared he had
begun to speak touchingly of "Little Jimmy," of the countless
advantages of Eugene's lot and, after a mighty struggle, the boy
had renounced the pony, in a scrawled message to Elfland, in
favor of the cripple. Eugene never forgot: even when he had
reached manhood the deception of "Little Jimmy" returned to him,
without rancor, without ugliness, only with pain for all the
blind waste, the stupid perjury, the thoughtless dishonor, the
crippling dull deceit.</p>
<p>Luke parroted all of his father's sermons, but earnestly and
witlessly, without Gant's humor, without his chicanery, only with
his sentimentality. He lived in a world of symbols, large, crude,
and gaudily painted, labelled "Father," "Mother," "Home,"
"Family," "Generosity," "Honor," "Unselfishness," made of sugar
and molasses, and gummed glutinously with tear-shaped syrup.</p>
<p>"He's one good boy," the neighbors said.</p>
<p>"He's the cutest thing," said the ladies, who were charmed by
his stutter, his wit, his good nature, his devout attendance on
them.</p>
<p>"That boy's a hustler. He'll make his mark," said all the men
in town.</p>
<p>And it was as the smiling hustler that he wanted to be known.
He read piously all the circulars the Curtis Publishing Company
sent to its agents: he posed himself in the various descriptive
attitudes that were supposed to promote business&mdash;the proper
manner of "approach," the most persuasive manner of drawing the
journal from the bag, the animated description of its contents,
in which he was supposed to be steeped as a result of his
faithful reading&mdash;"the good salesman," the circulars said,
"should know in and out the article he is selling"&mdash;a
knowledge that Luke avoided, but which he replaced with eloquent
invention of his own.</p>
<p>The literal digestion of these instructions resulted in one of
the most fantastical exhibitions of print-vending ever seen:
fortified by his own unlimited cheek, and by the pious axioms of
the exhortations that "the good salesman will never take no for
his answer," that he should "stick to his prospect" even if
rebuffed, that he should "try to get the customer's psychology,"
the boy would fall into step with an unsuspecting pedestrian,
open the broad sheets of The Post under the man's nose, and in a
torrential harangue, sown thickly with stuttering speech,
buffoonery, and ingratiation, delivered so rapidly that the man
could neither accept nor reject the magazine, hound him before a
grinning public down the length of a street, backing him
defensively into a wall, and taking from the victim's eager
fingers the five-cent coin that purchased his freedom.</p>
<p>"Yes, sir. Yes, sir," he would begin in a sonorous voice,
dropping wide-leggedly into the "prospect's" stride. "This week's
edition of The Saturday Evening Post, five cents, only a nickel,
p-p-p- purchased weekly by t-t-two million readers. In this
week's issue you have eighty-six pages of f-f-fact and fiction,
to say n-n- nothing of the advertisements. If you c-c-c-can't
read you'll get m-m-more than your money's worth out of the
p-p-pictures. On page 13 this week, we have a very fine article,
by I-I-I-Isaac F. Marcosson, the f-f-f-famous traveller and
writer on politics; on page 29, you have a story by Irvin S.
Cobb, the g-g-g-greatest living humorist, and a new story of the
prize-ring by J-J-Jack London. If you b-b-bought it in a book,
it'd c-c-cost you a d-d- dollar-and-a-half."</p>
<p>He had, besides these chance victims, an extensive clientry
among the townsfolk. Swinging briskly and cheerily down the
street, full of greetings and glib repartee, he would accost each
of the grinning men by a new title, in a rich stammering tenor
voice:</p>
<p>"Colonel, how are you! Major&mdash;here you are, a week's
reading hot off the press. Captain, how's the boy?"</p>
<p>"How are you, son?"</p>
<p>"Couldn't be better, General&mdash;slick as a puppy's
belly!"</p>
<p>And they would roar with wheezing, red-faced, Southern
laughter:</p>
<p>"By God, he's a good 'un. Here, son, give me one of the damn
things. I don't want it, but I'll buy it just to hear you
talk."</p>
<p>He was full of pungent and racy vulgarity: he had, more than
any of the family, a Rabelaisian earthiness that surged in him
with limitless energy, charging his tongue with unpremeditated
comparisons, Gargantuan metaphors. Finally, he wet the bed every
night in spite of Eliza's fretting complaints: it was the final
touch of his stuttering, whistling, cheerful, vital, and comic
personality&mdash;he was Luke, the unique, Luke, the
incomparable: he was, in spite of his garrulous and fidgeting
nervousness, an intensely likable person&mdash;and he really had
in him a bottomless well of affection. He wanted bounteous praise
for his acts, but he had a deep, genuine kindliness and
tenderness.</p>
<p>Every week, on Thursday, in Gant's dusty little office, he
would gather the grinning cluster of small boys who bought The
Post from him, and harangue them before he sent them out on their
duties:</p>
<p>"Well, have you thought of what you're going to tell them yet?
You know you can't sit around on your little tails and expect
them to look you up. Have you got a spiel worked out yet? How do
you approach 'em, eh?" he said, turning fiercely to a stricken
small boy. "Speak up, speak up, G-G-G-God-damn it&mdash;don't
s-s-stand there looking at me. Haw!" he said, laughing with
sudden wild idiocy, "look at that face, won't you?"</p>
<p>Gant surveyed the proceedings from afar with Jannadeau,
grinning.</p>
<p>"All right, Christopher Columbus," continued Luke,
good-humoredly. "What do you tell 'em, son?"</p>
<p>The boy cleared his throat timidly: "Mister, do you want to
buy a copy of The Saturday Evening Post?"</p>
<p>"Oh, twah-twah," said Luke, with mincing delicacy, as the boys
sniggered, "sweet twah-twah! Do you expect them to buy with a
spiel like that? My God, where are your brains? Sail into them.
Tackle them, and don't take no for an answer. Don't ask them if
they WANT to buy. Dive into them: 'Here you are, sir&mdash;hot
off the press.' Jesus Christ," he yelled, looking at the distant
court- house clock with sudden fidget, "we should have been out
an hour ago. Come on&mdash;don't stand there: here are your
papers. How many do you want, you little Kike?"&mdash;for he had
several Jews in his employ: they worshipped him and he was very
fond of them&mdash;he liked their warmth, richness, humor.</p>
<p>"Twenty."</p>
<p>"Twenty!" he yelled. "You little loafer&mdash;you'll t-t-take
fifty. G-g-go on, you c-c-can sell 'em this afternoon. By
G-G-God, papa," he said, pointing to the Jews, as Gant entered
the office, "it l-l- looks like the Last S-S-Supper, don't it?
All right!" he said, smacking across the buttocks a small boy who
had bent for his quota. "Don't stick it in my face." They
shrieked with laughter. "Dive in to them now. Don't let 'em get
away from you." And, laughing and excited, he would send them out
into the streets.</p>
<p>To this land of employment and this method of exploitation
Eugene was now initiated. He loathed the work with a deadly, an
inexplicable loathing. But something in him festered deeply at
the idea of disposing of his wares by the process of making such
a wretched little nuisance of himself that riddance was purchased
only at the price of the magazine. He writhed with shame and
humiliation, but he stuck desperately to his task, a queer curly-
headed passionate little creature, who raced along by the side of
an astonished captive, pouring out of his dark eager face a
hurricane of language. And men, fascinated somehow by this
strange eloquence from a little boy, bought.</p>
<p>Sometimes the heavy paunch-bellied Federal judge, sometimes an
attorney, a banker would take him home, bidding him to perform
for their wives, the members of their families, giving him
twenty-five cents when he was done, and dismissing him. "What do
you think of that!" they said.</p>
<p>His first and nearest sales made, in the town, he would make
the long circle on the hills and in the woods along the
outskirts, visiting the tubercular sanitariums, selling the
magazines easily and quickly&mdash;"like hot cakes" as Luke had
it&mdash;to doctors and nurses, to white unshaven,
sensitive-faced Jews, to the wisp of a rake, spitting his rotten
lungs into a cup, to good-looking young women who coughed
slightly from time to time, but who smiled at him from their
chairs, and let their warm soft hands touch his slightly as they
paid him.</p>
<p>Once, at a hillside sanitarium, two young New York Jews had
taken him to the room of one of them, closed the door behind him,
and assaulted him, tumbling him on the bed, while one drew forth
a pocket knife and informed him he was going to perform a
caponizing operation on him. They were two young men bored with
the hills, the town, the deadly regime of their treatment, and it
occurred to him years later that they had concocted the business,
days ahead, in their dull lives, living for the excitement and
terror they would arouse in him. His response was more violent
than they had bargained for: he went mad with fear, screamed, and
fought insanely. They were weak as cats, he squirmed out of their
grasp and off the bed cuffing and clawing tigerishly, striking
and kicking them with blind and mounting rage. He was released by
a nurse who unlocked the door and led him out into the sunlight,
the two young consumptives, exhausted and frightened, remaining
in their room. He was nauseated by fear and by the impacts of his
fists on their leprous bodies.</p>
<p>But the little mound of nickels and dimes and quarters chinked
pleasantly in his pockets: leg-weary and exhausted he would stand
before a gleaming fountain burying his hot face in an iced drink.
Sometimes conscience-tortured, he would steal an hour away from
the weary streets and go into the library for a period of
enchantment and oblivion: he was often discovered by his watchful
and bustling brother, who drove him out to his labor again,
taunting and spurring him into activity.</p>
<p>"Wake up! You're not in Fairyland. Go after them."</p>
<p>Eugene's face was of no use to him as a mask: it was a dark
pool in which every pebble of thought and feeling left its
circle&mdash;his shame, his distaste for his employment was
obvious, although he tried to conceal it: he was accused of false
pride, told that he was "afraid of a little honest work," and
reminded of the rich benefits he had received from his
big-hearted parents.</p>
<p>He turned desperately to Ben. Sometimes Ben, loping along the
streets of the town, met him, hot, tired, dirty, wearing his
loaded canvas bag, scowled fiercely at him, upbraided him for his
unkempt appearance, and took him into a lunch-room for something
to eat&mdash;rich foaming milk, fat steaming kidney-beans, thick
apple-pie.</p>
<p>Both Ben and Eugene were by nature aristocrats. Eugene had
just begun to feel his social status&mdash;or rather his lack of
one; Ben had felt it for years. The feeling at bottom might have
resolved itself simply into a desire for the companionship of
elegant and lovely women: neither was able, nor would have dared,
to confess this, and Eugene was unable to confess that he was
susceptible to the social snub, or the pain of caste inferiority:
any suggestion that the companionship of elegant people was
preferable to the fellowship of a world of Tarkintons, and its
blousy daughters, would have been hailed with heavy ridicule by
the family, as another indication of false and undemocratic
pride. He would have been called "Mr. Vanderbilt" or "the Prince
of Wales."</p>
<p>Ben, however, was not to be intimidated by their cant, or
deceived by their twaddle. He saw them with bitter clarity,
answered their pretensions with soft mocking laughter, and a
brief nod upwards and to the side of the companion to whom he
communicated all his contemptuous observation&mdash;his dark
satiric angel: "Oh, my God! Listen to that, won't you?"</p>
<p>There was behind his scowling quiet eyes, something strange
and fierce and unequivocal that frightened them: besides, he had
secured for himself the kind of freedom they valued
most&mdash;the economic freedom&mdash;and he spoke as he felt,
answering their virtuous reproof with fierce quiet scorn.</p>
<p>One day, he stood, smelling of nicotine, before the fire,
scowling darkly at Eugene who, grubby and tousled, had slung his
heavy bag over his shoulder, and was preparing to depart.</p>
<p>"Come here, you little bum," he said. "When did you wash your
hands last?" Scowling fiercely, he made a sudden motion as if to
strike the boy, but he finished instead by re-tying, with his
hard delicate hands, his tie.</p>
<p>"In God's name, mama," he burst out irritably to Eliza,
"haven't you got a clean shirt to give him? You know, he ought to
have one every month or so."</p>
<p>"What do you mean? What do you mean?" said Eliza with comic
rapidity, looking up from a basket of socks she was darning. "I
gave him that one last Tuesday."</p>
<p>"You little thug!" he growled, looking at Eugene with a fierce
pain in his eyes. "Mama, for heaven's sake, why don't you send
him to the barber's to get that lousy hair cut off? By God, I'll
pay for it, if you don't want to spend the money."</p>
<p>She pursed her lips angrily and continued to darn. Eugene
looked at him dumbly, gratefully. After Eugene had gone, the
quiet one smoked moodily for a time, drawing the fragrant smoke
in long gulps down into his thin lungs. Eliza, recollective and
hurt at what had been said, worked on.</p>
<p>"What are you trying to do with your kid, mama?" he said in a
hard quiet voice, after a silence. "Do you want to make a tramp
out of him?"</p>
<p>"What do you mean? What do you mean?"</p>
<p>"Do you think it's right to send him out on the streets with
every little thug in town?"</p>
<p>"Why, I don't know what you're talking about, boy," she said
impatiently. "It's no disgrace for a boy to do a little honest
work, and no one thinks so."</p>
<p>"Oh, my God," he said to the dark angel. "Listen to that!"</p>
<p>Eliza pursed her lips without speaking for a time.</p>
<p>"Pride goeth before a fall," she said after a moment. "Pride
goeth before a fall."</p>
<p>"I can't see that that makes much difference to us," said he.
"We've got no place to fall to."</p>
<p>"I consider myself as good as any one," she said, with
dignity. "I hold my head up with any one I meet."</p>
<p>"Oh, my God," Ben said to his angel. "You don't meet any one.
I don't notice any of your fine brothers or their wives coming to
see you."</p>
<p>This was true, and it hurt. She pursed her lips.</p>
<p>"No, mama," he continued after a moment's pause, "you and the
Old Man have never given a damn what we've done so long as you
thought you might save a nickel by it."</p>
<p>"Why, I don't know what you're talking about, boy," she
answered. "You talk as if you thought we were Rich Folks. Beggars
can't be choosers."</p>
<p>"Oh, my God," he laughed bitterly. "You and the Old Man like
to make out you're paupers, but you've a sock full of money."</p>
<p>"I don't know what you mean," she said angrily.</p>
<p>"No," he said, with his frequent negative beginning, after a
moody silence, "there are people in this town without a fifth
what we've got who get twice as much out of it. The rest of us
have never had anything, but I don't want to see the kid made
into a little tramp."</p>
<p>There was a long silence. She darned bitterly, pursing her
lips frequently, hovering between quiet and tears.</p>
<p>"I never thought," she began after a long pause, her mouth
tremulous with a bitter hurt smile, "that I should live to hear
such talk from a son of mine. You had better watch out," she
hinted darkly, "a day of reckoning cometh. As sure as you live,
as sure as you live. You will be repaid threefold for your
unnatural," her voice sank to a tearful whisper, "your UNNATURAL
conduct!" She wept easily.</p>
<p>"Oh, my God," answered Ben, turning his lean, gray, bitter,
bumpy face up toward his listening angel. "Listen to that, won't
you?"</p>
<h3>11</h3>
<p>Eliza saw Altamont not as so many hills, buildings, people:
she saw it in the pattern of a gigantic blueprint. She knew the
history of every piece of valuable property&mdash;who bought it,
who sold it, who owned it in 1893, and what it was now worth. She
watched the tides of traffic cannily; she knew by what corners
the largest number of people passed in a day or an hour; she was
sensitive to every growing-pain of the young town, gauging from
year to year its growth in any direction, and deducing the
probable direction of its future expansion. She judged distances
critically, saw at once where the beaten route to an important
centre was stupidly circuitous, and looking in a straight line
through houses and lots, she said:</p>
<p>"There'll be a street through here some day."</p>
<p>Her vision of land and population was clear, crude,
focal&mdash;there was nothing technical about it: it was
extraordinary for its direct intensity. Her instinct was to buy
cheaply where people would come; to keep out of pockets and culs
de sac, to buy on a street that moved toward a centre, and that
could be given extension.</p>
<p>Thus, she began to think of Dixieland. It was situated five
minutes from the public square, on a pleasant sloping
middle-class street of small homes and boarding-houses. Dixieland
was a big cheaply constructed frame house of eighteen or twenty
drafty high- ceilinged rooms: it had a rambling, unplanned,
gabular appearance, and was painted a dirty yellow. It had a
pleasant green front yard, not deep but wide, bordered by a row
of young deep-bodied maples: there was a sloping depth of one
hundred and ninety feet, a frontage of one hundred and twenty.
And Eliza, looking toward the town, said: "They'll put a street
behind there some day."</p>
<p>In winter, the wind blew howling blasts under the skirts of
Dixieland: its back end was built high off the ground on wet
columns of rotting brick. Its big rooms were heated by a small
furnace which sent up, when charged with fire, a hot dry
enervation to the rooms of the first floor, and a gaseous but
chill radiation to those upstairs.</p>
<p>The place was for sale. Its owner was a middle-aged
horse-faced gentleman whose name was the Reverend Wellington
Hodge: he had begun life favorably in Altamont as a Methodist
minister, but had run foul of trouble when he began to do double
service to the Lord God of Hosts and John Barleycorn&mdash;his
evangelical career came to an abrupt ending one winter's night
when the streets were dumb with falling snow. Wellington, clad
only in his winter heavies, made a wild sortie from Dixieland at
two in the morning, announcing the kingdom of God and the
banishment of the devil, in a mad marathon through the streets
that landed him panting but victorious in front of the Post
Office. Since then, with the assistance of his wife, he had eked
out a hard living at the boarding-house. Now, he was spent,
disgraced, and weary of the town.</p>
<p>Besides, the sheltering walls of Dixieland inspired him with
horror&mdash;he felt that the malign influence of the house had
governed his own disintegration. He was a sensitive man, and his
promenades about his estate were checked by inhibited places: the
cornice of the long girdling porch where a lodger had hanged
himself one day at dawn, the spot in the hall where the
consumptive had collapsed in a hemorrhage, the room where the old
man cut his throat. He wanted to return to his home, a land of
fast horses, wind-bent grass, and good whisky&mdash;Kentucky. He
was ready to sell Dixieland.</p>
<p>Eliza pursed her lips more and more thoughtfully, went to town
by way of Spring Street more and more often.</p>
<p>"That's going to be a good piece of property some day," she
said to Gant.</p>
<p>He made no complaint. He felt suddenly the futility of
opposing an implacable, an inexorable desire.</p>
<p>"Do you want it?" he said.</p>
<p>She pursed her lips several times: "It's a good buy," she
said.</p>
<p>"You'll never regret it as long as you live, W. O.," said Dick
Gudger, the agent.</p>
<p>"It's her house, Dick," said Gant wearily. "Make out the
papers in her name."</p>
<p>She looked at him.</p>
<p>"I never want to own another piece of property as long as I
live," said Gant. "It's a curse and a care, and the tax-collector
gets all you have in the end."</p>
<p>Eliza pursed her lips and nodded.</p>
<p>She bought the place for seventy-five hundred dollars. She had
enough money to make the first payment of fifteen hundred. The
balance was to be paid in installments of fifteen hundred dollars
a year. This she knew she had to pay chiefly from the earnings of
the house.</p>
<p>In the young autumn when the maples were still full and green,
and the migratory swallows filled secretly the trees with clamor,
and swooped of an evening in a black whirlwind down, drifting at
its funnel end, like dead leaves, into their chosen chimney,
Eliza moved into Dixieland. There was clangor, excitement, vast
curiosity in the family about the purchase, but no clear
conception of what had really happened. Gant and Eliza, although
each felt dumbly that they had come to a decisive boundary in
their lives, talked vaguely about their plans, spoke of Dixieland
evasively as "a good investment," said nothing clearly. In fact,
they felt their approaching separation instinctively: Eliza's
life was moving by a half-blind but inevitable gravitation toward
the centre of its desire&mdash;the exact meaning of her venture
she would have been unable to define, but she had a deep
conviction that the groping urge which had led her so blindly
into death and misery at Saint Louis had now impelled her in the
right direction. Her life was on the rails.</p>
<p>And however vaguely, confusedly, and casually they approached
this complete disruption of their life together, the rooting up
of their clamorous home, when the hour of departures came, the
elements resolved themselves immutably and without
hesitation.</p>
<p>Eliza took Eugene with her. He was the last tie that bound her
to all the weary life of breast and cradle; he still slept with
her of nights; she was like some swimmer who ventures out into a
dark and desperate sea, not wholly trusting to her strength and
destiny, but with a slender cord bound to her which stretches
still to land.</p>
<p>With scarcely a word spoken, as if it had been known anciently
and forever, Helen stayed with Gant.</p>
<p>The time for Daisy's marriage was growing near: she had been
sought by a tall middle-aged shaven life-insurance agent, who
wore spats, collars of immaculate starchiness five inches in
height, who spoke with an unctuous and insane croon, chortling
gently in his throat from time to time for no reason at all. His
name was Mr. McKissem, and she had screwed up enough courage,
after an arduous siege, to refuse him, upon the private grounds
of insanity.</p>
<p>She had promised herself to a young South Carolinian, who was
connected rather vaguely with the grocery trade. His hair was
parted in the middle of his low forehead, his voice was soft,
drawling, amiable, his manner hearty and insistent, his habits
large and generous. He brought Gant cigars on his visits, the
boys large boxes of assorted candies. Every one felt that he had
favorable prospects.</p>
<p>As for the others&mdash;Ben and Luke only&mdash;they were left
floating in limbo; for Steve, since his eighteenth year, had
spent most of his life away from home, existing for months by
semi-vagabondage, scrappy employment, and small forgeries upon
his father, in New Orleans, Jacksonville, Memphis, and
reappearing to his depressed family after long intervals by
telegraphing that he was desperately sick or, through the
intermediacy of a crony who borrowed the title of "doctor" for
the occasion, that he was dying, and would come home in a box if
he was not sent for in the emaciated flesh.</p>
<p>Thus, before he was eight, Eugene gained another roof and lost
forever the tumultuous, unhappy, warm centre of his home. He had
from day to day no clear idea where the day's food, shelter,
lodging was to come from, although he was reasonably sure it
would be given: he ate wherever he happened to hang his hat,
either at Gant's or at his mother's; occasionally, although
infrequently, he slept with Luke in the sloping, alcoved, gabled
back room, rude with calcimine, with the high drafty steps that
slanted to the kitchen porch, with the odor of old stacked books
in packing-cases, with the sweet orchard scents. There were two
beds; he exulted in his unaccustomed occupancy of an entire
mattress, dreaming of the day of manlike privacy. But Eliza did
not allow this often: he was riven into her flesh.</p>
<p>Forgetful of him during the day's press, she summoned him at
night over the telephone, demanding his return, and upbraiding
Helen for keeping him. There was a bitter submerged struggle over
him between Eliza and her daughter: absorbed in the management of
Dixieland for days, she would suddenly remember his absence from
meals, and call for him angrily across the phone.</p>
<p>"Good heavens, mama," Helen would answer irritably. "He's your
child, not mine. I'm not going to see him starve."</p>
<p>"What do you mean? What do you mean? He ran off while dinner
was on the table. I've got a good meal fixed for him here. H-m! A
GOOD meal."</p>
<p>Helen put her hand over the mouthpiece, making a face at him
as he stood catlike and sniggering by, burlesquing the Pentland
manner, tone, mouthing.</p>
<p>"H-m! Why, law me, child, yes&mdash;it's GOOD soup."</p>
<p>He was convulsed silently.</p>
<p>And then aloud: "Well, it's your own lookout, not mine. If he
doesn't want to stay up there, I can't help it."</p>
<p>When he returned to Dixieland, Eliza would question him with
bitter working lips; she would prick at his hot pride in an
effort to keep him by her.</p>
<p>"What do you mean by running off to your papa's like that? If
I were you, I'd have too much pride for that. I'd be
a-sha-a-med!" Her face worked with a bitter hurt smile. "Helen
can't be bothered with you. She doesn't want you around."</p>
<p>But the powerful charm of Gant's house, of its tacked and
added whimsy, its male smell, its girdling rich vines, its great
gummed trees, its roaring internal seclusiveness, the blistered
varnish, the hot calfskin, the comfort and abundance, seduced him
easily away from the great chill tomb of Dixieland, particularly
in winter, since Eliza was most sparing of coal.</p>
<p>Gant had already named it "The Barn"; in the morning now,
after his heavy breakfast at home, he would swing gauntly toward
town by way of Spring Street, composing en route the invective
that he had formerly reserved to his sitting-room. He would
stride through the wide chill hall of Dixieland, bursting in upon
Eliza, and two or three negresses, busy preparing the morning
meal for the hungry boarders who rocked energetically upon the
porch. All of the objections, all of the abuse that had not been
uttered when she bought the place, were vented now.</p>
<p>"Woman, you have deserted my bed and board, you have made a
laughing stock of me before the world, and left your children to
perish. Fiend that you are, there is nothing that you would not
do to torture, humiliate and degrade me. You have deserted me in
my old age; you have left me to die alone. Ah, Lord! It was a
bitter day for us all when your gloating eyes first fell upon
this damnable, this awful, this murderous and bloody Barn. There
is no ignominy to which you will not stoop if you think it will
put a nickel in your pocket. You have fallen so low not even your
own brothers will come near you. 'Nor beast, nor man hath fallen
so far.'"</p>
<p>And in the pantries, above the stove, into the dining-room,
the rich voices of the negresses chuckled with laughter.</p>
<p>"Dat man sho' can tawk!"</p>
<p>Eliza got along badly with the negroes. She had all the
dislike and distrust for them of the mountain people. Moreover,
she had never been used to service, and she did not know how to
accept or govern it graciously. She nagged and berated the sullen
negro girls constantly, tortured by the thought that they were
stealing her supplies and her furnishings, and dawdling away the
time for which she paid them. And she paid them reluctantly,
dribbling out their small wages a coin or two at a time, nagging
them for their laziness and stupidity.</p>
<p>"What have you been doing all this time? Did you get those
back rooms done upstairs?"</p>
<p>"No'm," said the negress sullenly, slatting flatfootedly down
the kitchen.</p>
<p>"I'll vow," Eliza fretted. "I never saw such a
good-for-nothing shiftless darkey in my life. You needn't think
I'm going to pay you for wasting your time."</p>
<p>This would go on throughout the day. As a result, Eliza would
often begin the day without a servant: the girls departed at
night muttering sullenly, and did not appear the next morning.
Moreover, her reputation for bickering pettiness spread through
the length and breadth of Niggertown. It became increasingly
difficult for her to find any one at all who would work for her.
Completely flustered when she awoke to find herself without help,
she would immediately call Helen over the telephone, pouring her
fretful story into the girl's ear and entreating assistance:</p>
<p>"I'll declare, child, I don't know what I'm going to do. I
could wring that worthless nigger's neck. Here I am left all
alone with a house full of people."</p>
<p>"Mama, in heaven's name, what's the matter? Can't you keep a
nigger in the house? Other people do. What do you do to them,
anyway?"</p>
<p>But, fuming and irritable, she would leave Gant's and go to
her mother's, serving the tables with large heartiness, nervous
and animated good-humor. All the boarders were very fond of her:
they said she was a fine girl. Every one did. There was a
spacious and unsparing generosity about her, a dominant consuming
vitality, which ate at her poor health, her slender supply of
strength, so that her shattered nerves drew her frequently toward
hysteria, and sometimes toward physical collapse. She was almost
six feet tall: she had large hands and feet, thin straight legs,
a big-boned generous face, with the long full chin slightly
adroop, revealing her big gold-traced upper teeth. But, in spite
of this gauntness, she did not look hard-featured or raw-boned.
Her face was full of heartiness and devotion, sensitive,
whole-souled, hurt, bitter, hysterical, but at times
transparently radiant and handsome.</p>
<p>It was a spiritual and physical necessity for her to exhaust
herself in service for others, and it was necessary for her to
receive heavy slatherings of praise for that service, and
especially necessary that she feel her efforts had gone
unappreciated. Even at the beginning, she would become almost
frantic reciting her grievances, telling the story of her service
to Eliza in a voice that became harsh and hysterical:</p>
<p>"Let the least little thing go wrong and she's at the phone.
It's not my place to go up there and work like a nigger for a
crowd of old cheap boarders. You know that, don't you? DON'T
you?"</p>
<p>"Yes'm," said Eugene, meekly serving as audience.</p>
<p>"But she'd die rather than admit it. Do you ever hear her say
a word of thanks? Do I get," she said laughing suddenly, her
hysteria crossed for the moment with her great humor, "do I get
so much as 'go-to-hell' for it?"</p>
<p>"NO!" squealed Eugene, going off in fits of idiot
laughter.</p>
<p>"Why, law me, child. H-m! Yes. It's GOOD soup," said she,
touched with her great earthy burlesque.</p>
<p>He tore his collar open, and undid his trousers, sliding to
the floor in an apoplexy of laughter.</p>
<p>"Sdop! Sdop! You're g-g-gilling me!"</p>
<p>"H-m! Why, law me! Yes," she continued, grinning at him as if
she hoped to succeed.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, whether Eliza was servantless or not, she went
daily at dinner, the mid-day meal, to help at table, and
frequently at night when Gant and the boys ate with Eliza instead
of at home. She went because of her deep desire to serve, because
it satisfied her need for giving more than was returned, and
because, in spite of her jibes, along with Gant, at the Barn, and
the "cheap boarders," the animation of feeding, the clatter of
plates, the braided clamor of their talk, stimulated and excited
her.</p>
<p>Like Gant, like Luke, she needed extension in life, movement,
excitement: she wanted to dominate, to entertain, to be the life
of the party. On small solicitation, she sang for the boarders,
thumping the cheap piano with her heavy accurate touch, and
singing in her strong, vibrant, somewhat hard soprano a repertory
of songs classical, sentimental, and comic. Eugene remembered the
soft cool nights of summer, the assembled boarders and "I Wonder
Who's Kissing Her Now," which Gant demanded over and over; "Love
Me and the World Is Mine"; "Till the Sands of the Desert Grow
Cold"; "Dear Old Girl, the Rob-BIN Sings Above You"; "The End of
a Perfect Day"; and "Alexander's Rag-Time Band," which Luke had
practised in a tortured house for weeks, and sung with thunderous
success in the High School Minstrels.</p>
<p>Later, in the cool dark, Gant, rocking violently, would hold
forth on the porch, his great voice carrying across the quiet
neighborhood, as he held the charmed boarders by his torrential
eloquence, his solution of problems of state, his prejudiced but
bold opinion upon current news.</p>
<p>"&mdash;And what did WE do, gentlemen? We sank their navy in
an action that lasted only twenty minutes, stormed at by shot and
shell, Teddy and his Rough Riders took the hill at
Santiago&mdash;it was all over, as you well know, in a few
months. We had declared war with no thought of ulterior gain; we
came because the indignation of a GREAT people had been aroused
at the oppression of a smaller one, and then, with a magnanimity
well worthy the greatest people of the face of the earth, we paid
our defeated enemy twenty millions of dollars. Ah, Lord! That was
magnanimity indeed! You don't think any other nation would have
done that, do you?"</p>
<p>"No, sir," said the boarders emphatically.</p>
<p>They didn't always agree with his political
opinions&mdash;Roosevelt was the faultless descendant of Julius
C&aelig;sar, Napoleon Bonaparte, and Abraham Lincoln&mdash;but
they felt he had a fine head and would have gone far in
politics.</p>
<p>"That man should have been a lawyer," said the boarders.</p>
<p>And yet, there was surging into these chosen hills the strong
thrust of the world, like a kissing tide, which swings lazily in
with a slapping glut of waters, and recoils into its parent
crescent strength, to be thrown farther inward once again.</p>
<p>It was an element of Eliza's primitive and focal reasoning
that men and women withered by the desert would seek an oasis,
that those who were thirsty would seek water, and that those
panting on the plains would look into the hills for comfort and
relief. She had that bull's-eye accuracy which has since been
celebrated, when plum-picking's over, under the name of
"vision."</p>
<p>The streets, ten years before raw clay, were being paved: Gant
went into frenzies over the paving assessments, cursed the land,
the day of his birth, the machinations of Satan's children. But
Eugene followed the wheeled casks of boiling tar; watched the
great roller, a monster that crushed him in night-mares, powder
the layered rock; felt, as he saw the odorous pressed tongue of
pavement lengthen out, a swelling ecstasy.</p>
<p>From time to time, a stilted Cadillac gasped cylindrically up
the hill past Dixieland: Eugene said a spell, as it faltered, for
its success&mdash;Jim Sawyer, a young blood, came for Miss
Cutler, the Pittsburgh beauty: he opened a door behind in the fat
red belly. They got in.</p>
<p>Sometimes, when Eliza awoke to find her servants gone, he was
sent down into Niggertown to capture a new one: in that city of
rickets he searched into their fetid shacks, past the slow stench
of little rills of mire and sewage, in fetid cellars, through all
the rank labyrinth of the hill-sprawled settlement. He came, in
the hot sealed dungeons of their rooms, to know the wild grace of
their bodies, thrown upon a bed, their rich laughter, their smell
of the jungle tropics stewed in with frying cookery and a boiling
wash.</p>
<p>"Do you want a job?"</p>
<p>"Whose little boy are you?"</p>
<p>"Mrs. Eliza Gant's."</p>
<p>Silence. Presently: "Dere's a gal up de street at Mis'
Cawpening's who's lookin' fo' wuk. YOU go see HUH."</p>
<p>Eliza watched them with a falcon's eye for thefts. Once, with
a detective, she searched a departed girl's room in Niggertown,
finding there sheets, towels, spoons that had been stolen from
her. The girl went to the penitentiary for two years. Eliza loved
the commotion of law, the smell and tension of the courts.
Whenever she could go to law she did so: she delighted in
bringing suit against people, or in having suit brought against
her. She always won.</p>
<p>When her boarders defaulted payments she seized their
belongings triumphantly, delighting particularly in eleventh-hour
captures at the railway station, with the aid of an obedient
constabulary, and ringed by the attentive offal of the town.</p>
<p>Eugene was ashamed of Dixieland. And he was again afraid to
express his shame. As with The Post, he felt thwarted, netted,
trapped. He hated the indecency of his life, the loss of dignity
and seclusion, the surrender to the tumultuous rabble of the four
walls which shield us from them. He felt, rather than understood,
the waste, the confusion, the blind cruelty of their
lives&mdash;his spirit was stretched out on the rack of despair
and bafflement as there came to him more and more the conviction
that their lives could not be more hopelessly distorted,
wrenched, mutilated, and perverted away from all simple comfort,
repose, happiness, if they set themselves deliberately to tangle
the skein, twist the pattern. He choked with fury: he thought of
Eliza's slow speech, her endless reminiscence, her maddening
lip-pursing, and turned white with constricted rage.</p>
<p>He saw plainly by this time that their poverty, the threat of
the poorhouse, the lurid references to the pauper's grave,
belonged to the insensate mythology of hoarding; anger smouldered
like a brand in him at their sorry greed. There was no place
sacred unto themselves, no place fixed for their own
inhabitation, no place proof against the invasion of the
boarders.</p>
<p>As the house filled, they went from room to little room, going
successively down the shabby scale of their lives. He felt it
would hurt them, coarsen them: he had even then an intense faith
in food, in housing, in comfort&mdash;he felt that a civilized
man must begin with them; he knew that wherever the spirit had
withered, it had not withered because of food and plumbing.</p>
<p>As the house filled, in the summer season, and it was
necessary to wait until the boarders had eaten before a place
could be found for him, he walked sullenly about beneath the
propped back porch of Dixieland, savagely exploring the dark
cellar, or the two dank windowless rooms which Eliza rented, when
she could, to negresses.</p>
<p>He felt now the petty cruelty of village caste. On Sunday for
several years, he had bathed, brushed, arrayed his anointed body
in clean underwear and shirting and departed, amid all the
pleasurable bustle of Sunday morning, for the Presbyterian Sunday
School. He had by this time been delivered from the instruction
of the several spinsters who had taught his infant faith the
catechism, the goodness of God, and the elements of celestial
architecture. The five-cent piece which formerly he had yielded
up reluctantly, thinking of cakes and ale, he now surrendered
more gladly, since he usually had enough left over for cold
gaseous draughts at the soda- fountain.</p>
<p>In the fresh Sunday morning air he marched off with brisk
excitement to do duty at the altars, pausing near the church
where the marshalled ranks of the boys' military school split
cleanly into regimented Baptists, Methodists, Presbyterians.</p>
<p>The children assembled in a big room adjacent to the church,
honey- combed to right and left with small classrooms, which they
entered after the preliminary service was finished. They were
exhorted from the platform by the superintendent, a Scotch
dentist with a black-gray beard, fringed by a small area of
embalmed skin, whose cells, tissues, and chemical juices seemed
to have been fixed in a state of ageless suspension, and who
looked no older from one decade to another.</p>
<p>He read the text, or the parable of the day's study, commented
on it with C&aelig;sarean dryness and concision, and surrendered
the service to his assistant, a shaven, spectacled,
Wilsonian-looking man, also Scotch, who smiled with cold
affection at them over his high shiny collar, and led them
through the verses of a hymn, heaving up his arms and leering at
them encouragingly, as they approached the chorus. A sturdy
spinstress thumped heavily upon a piano which shook like a
leaf.</p>
<p>Eugene liked the high crystal voices of the little children,
backed by the substantial marrow of the older boys and girls, and
based on the strong volume of the Junior and Senior Baraccas and
Philatheas. They sang:</p>
<blockquote>"Throw out the lifeline, throw out the lifeline,<br>
Someone is sinking to-day-ee"&mdash;</blockquote>
<p>on the mornings when the collection went for missionary work.
And they sang:</p>
<blockquote>"Shall we gather at the river,<br>
The bew-tee-ful, the bew-tee-ful r-hiver."</blockquote>
<p>He liked that one very much. And the noble surge of "Onward,
Christian Soldiers."</p>
<p>Later, he went into one of the little rooms with his class.
The sliding doors rumbled together all around; presently there
was a quiet drone throughout the building.</p>
<p>He was now in a class composed entirely of boys. His teacher
was a tall white-faced young man, bent and thin, who was known to
all the other boys as secretary of the Y.M.C.A. He was
tubercular; but the boys admired him because of his former skill
as a baseball and basketball player. He spoke in a sad, sugary,
whining voice; he was oppressively Christ-like; he spoke to them
intimately about the lesson of the day, asking them what it might
teach them in their daily lives, in acts of obedience and love to
their parents and friends, in duty, courtesy, and Christian
charity. And he told them that when they were in doubt about
their conduct they should ask themselves what Jesus would say: he
spoke of Jesus often in his melancholy, somewhat discontented
voice&mdash;Eugene became vaguely miserable as he talked,
thinking of something soft, furry, with a wet tongue.</p>
<p>He was nervous and constrained: the other boys knew one
another intimately&mdash;they lived on, or in the neighborhood
of, Montgomery Avenue, which was the most fashionable street in
town. Sometimes, one of them said to him, grinning: "Do you want
to buy The Saturday Evening Post, Mister?"</p>
<p>Eugene, during the week, never touched the lives of any of
them, even in a remote way. His idea of their eminence was
grossly exaggerated; the town had grown rapidly from a straggling
village&mdash;it had few families as old as the Pentlands, and,
like all resort towns, its caste system was liquidly variable,
depending chiefly upon wealth, ambition, and boldness.</p>
<p>Harry Tarkinton and Max Isaacs were Baptists, as were most of
the people, the Scotch excepted, in Gant's neighborhood. In the
social scale the Baptists were the most populous and were
considered the most common: their minister was a large plump man
with a red face and a white vest, who reached great oratorical
effects, roaring at them like a lion, cooing at them like a dove,
introducing his wife into the sermon frequently for purposes of
intimacy and laughing, in a programme which the Episcopalians,
who held the highest social eminence, and the Presbyterians, less
fashionable, but solidly decent, felt was hardly chaste. The
Methodists occupied the middle ground between vulgarity and
decorum.</p>
<p>This starched and well brushed world of Sunday morning
Presbyterianism, with its sober decency, its sense of restraint,
its suggestion of quiet wealth, solid position, ordered ritual,
seclusive establishment, moved him deeply with its tranquillity.
He felt concretely his isolation from it, he entered it from the
jangled disorder of his own life once a week, looking at it, and
departing from it, for years, with the sad heart of a stranger.
And from the mellow gloom of the church, the rich distant organ,
the quiet nasal voice of the Scotch minister, the interminable
prayers, and the rich little pictures of Christian mythology
which he had collected as a child under the instruction of the
spinsters, he gathered something of the pain, the mystery, the
sensuous beauty of religion, something deeper and greater than
this austere decency.</p>
<h3>12</h3>
<p>It was the winter, and the sullen dying autumn that he hated
most at Dixieland&mdash;the dim fly-specked lights, the wretched
progress about the house in search of warmth, Eliza untidily
wrapped in an old sweater, a dirty muffler, a cast-off man's
coat. She glycerined her cold-cracked hands. The chill walls
festered with damp: they drank in death from the atmosphere: a
woman died of typhoid, her husband came quickly out into the hall
and dropped his hands. They were Ohio people.</p>
<p>Upstairs, upon a sleeping porch, a thin-faced Jew coughed
through the interminable dark.</p>
<p>"In heaven's name, mama," Helen fumed, "why do you take them
in? Can't you see he's got the bugs?"</p>
<p>"Why, no-o," said Eliza, pursing her lips. "He said he only
had a little bronchial trouble. I asked him about it, and he
laughed just as big as you please: 'Why, Mrs. Gant,' he
said&mdash;" and there would follow an endless anecdote,
embellished with many a winding rivulet. The girl raged: it was
one of Eliza's basic traits to defend blindly whatever brought
her money.</p>
<p>The Jew was a kind man. He coughed gently behind his white
hand and ate bread fried in battered egg and butter. Eugene
developed a keen appetite for it: innocently he called it "Jew
Bread" and asked for more. Lichenfels laughed gently,
coughed&mdash;his wife was full of swart rich laughter. The boy
did small services for him: he gave him a coin from week to week.
He was a clothier from a New Jersey town. In the Spring he went
to a sanitarium; he died there later.</p>
<p>In the winter a few chill boarders, those faces, those
personalities which become mediocre through repetition, sat for
hours before the coals of the parlor hearth, rocking
interminably, dull of voice and gesture, as hideously bored with
themselves and Dixieland, no doubt, as he with them.</p>
<p>He liked the summers better. There came slow-bodied women from
the hot rich South, dark-haired white-bodied girls from New
Orleans, corn-haired blondes from Georgia, nigger-drawling desire
from South Carolina. And there was malarial lassitude, tinged
faintly with yellow, from Mississippi but with white biting
teeth. A red-faced South Carolinian, with nicotined fingers, took
him daily to the baseball games; a lank yellow planter, malarial
from Mississippi, climbed hill, and wandered through the fragrant
mountain valleys with him; of nights he heard the rich laughter
of the women, tender and cruel, upon the dark porches, heard the
florid throat-tones of the men; saw the yielding stealthy
harlotry of the South&mdash;the dark seclusion of their midnight
bodies, their morning innocence. Desire, with bloody beak, tore
at his heart like jealous virtue: he was moral for that which was
denied him.</p>
<p>Of mornings he stayed at Gant's with Helen playing ball with
Buster Isaacs, a cousin of Max, a plump jolly little boy who
lived next door; summoned later by the rich incense of Helen's
boiling fudge. She sent him to the little Jewish grocery down the
street for the sour relishes she liked so well: tabled in
mid-morning they ate sour pickles, heavy slabs of ripe tomatoes,
coated with thick mayonnaise, amber percolated coffee,
fig-newtons and ladyfingers, hot pungent fudge pebbled with
walnuts and coated fragrantly with butter, sandwiches of tender
bacon and cucumber, iced belchy soft- drinks.</p>
<p>His trust in her Gantian wealth was boundless: this rich store
of delight came from inexhaustible resources. Warm lively hens
cackled cheerfully throughout the morning neighborhood; powerful
negroes brought dripping ice in iron talons from their smoking
wagons; he stood beneath their droning saws and caught the flying
ice-pulp in his hands; he drank in the combined odor of their
great bodies together with the rich compost of the refrigeration,
and the sharp oiliness of the dining-room linoleum; and in the
horsehair walnut parlor at mid-day, good with the mellow
piano-smell and the smell of stale varnished wood, she played for
him, and made him sing: "William Tell," "My Heart at Thy Sweet
Voice," "The Song Without Words," "Celeste A&iuml;da," "The Lost
Chord," her long throat lean and tendoned as her vibrant voice
rang out.</p>
<p>She took insatiable delight in him, stuffing him with sour and
sugared relishes, tumbling him, in a random moment of her
restless activity, upon Gant's lounge, and pinioning him while
she slapped his squirming face sharply with her big hand.</p>
<p>Sometimes, frantic with some swift tangle of her nerves, she
would attack him viciously, hating him for his dark brooding
face, his full scalloped underlip, his deep absorption in a
dream. Like Luke, and like Gant, she sought in the world
ceaseless entertainment for her restless biting vitality; it
infuriated her to see other people seek absorption within
themselves&mdash;she hated him at times when, her own wires
strumming, she saw his dark face brooding over a book or on some
vision. She would tear the book from his hands, slap him, and
stab him with her cruel savage tongue. She would pout out her
lip, goggle her face about stupidly on a drooping neck, assume an
expression of dopey idiocy, and pour out on him the horrible
torrent of her venom.</p>
<p>"You little freak&mdash;wandering around with your queer dopey
face. You're a regular little Pentland&mdash;you funny little
freak, you. Everybody's laughing at you. Don't you know that?
Don't you? We're going to dress you up as a girl, and let you go
around like that. You haven't got a drop of Gant blood in
you&mdash;papa's practically said as much&mdash;you're Greeley
all over again; you're queer. Pentland queerness sticking out all
over you."</p>
<p>Sometimes her sweltering and inchoate fury was so great that
she threw him on the floor and stamped on him.</p>
<p>He did not mind the physical assault so much as he did the
poisonous hatred of her tongue, insanely clever in fashioning the
most wounding barbs. He went frantic with horror, jerked
unexpectedly from Elfland into Hell, he bellowed madly, saw his
bountiful angel change in a moment to a snake-haired fury, lost
all his sublime faith in love and goodness. He rushed at the wall
like an insane little goat, battered his head screaming again and
again, wished desperately that his constricted and overloaded
heart would burst, that something in him would break, that
somehow, bloodily, he might escape the stifling prisonhouse of
his life.</p>
<p>This satisfied her desire; it was what deeply she had
wanted&mdash;she had found purging release in her savage attack
upon him, and now she could drain herself cleanly in a wild
smother of affection. She would seize him, struggling and
screaming, in her long arms, plaster kisses all over his red mad
face, soothing him with hearty flattery addressed in the third
person:</p>
<p>"Why, he didn't think I meant it, did he? Didn't he know I was
only joking? Why, he's strong as a little bull, isn't he? He's a
regular little giant, that's what he is. Why, he's perfectly
wild, isn't he? His eyes popping out of his head. I thought he
was going to knock a hole in the wall.&mdash;Yes, ma'am. Why, law
me, yes, child. It's GOOD soup," resorting to her broad mimicry
in order to make him laugh. And he would laugh against his will
between his sobs, in a greater torture because of this agony of
affection and reconciliation than because of the abuse.</p>
<p>Presently, when he had grown quiet, she would send him off to
the store for pickles, cakes, cold bottled drinks; he would
depart with red eyes, his cheeks furrowed dirtily by his tears,
wondering desperately as he went down the street why the thing
had happened, and drawing his foot sharply off the ground and
craning his neck convulsively as shame burnt in him.</p>
<p>There was in Helen a restless hatred of dullness,
respectability. Yet she was at heart a severely conventional
person, in spite of her occasional vulgarity, which was merely a
manifestation of her restless energy, a very na&iuml;ve, a
childishly innocent person about even the simple wickedness of
the village. She had several devoted young men on her
list&mdash;plain, hard-drinking country types: one, a native,
lean, red-faced, alcoholic, a city surveyor, who adored her;
another, a strapping florid blond from the Tennessee coal fields;
another, a young South Carolinian, townsman of her older sister's
fianc&eacute;.</p>
<p>These young men&mdash;Hugh Parker, Jim Phelps, and Joe
Cathcart, were innocently devoted; they liked her tireless and
dominant energy, the eager monopoly of her tongue, her big
sincerity and deep kindliness. She played and sang for
them&mdash;threw all her energy into entertaining them. They
brought her boxes of candy, little presents, were divided
jealously among themselves, but united in their affirmation that
she was "a fine girl."</p>
<p>And she would get Jim Phelps and Hugh Parker to bring her a
drink of whisky as well: she had begun to depend on small
potations of alcohol for the stimulus it gave her fevered
body&mdash;a small drink was enough to operate electrically in
her blood: it renewed her, energized her, gave her a temporary
and hectic vitality. Thus, although she never drank much at a
time and showed, beyond the renewed vitality and gaiety, no sign
of intoxication, she nibbled at the bottle.</p>
<p>"I'll take a drink whenever I can get it," she said.</p>
<p>She liked, almost invariably, young fast women. She liked the
hectic pleasure of their lives, the sense of danger, their humor
and liberality. She was drawn magnetically to all the wedded
harlotry, which, escaping the Sunday discipline of a Southern
village, and the Saturday lust of sodden husbands, came gaily to
Altamont in summer. She liked people who, as she said, "didn't
mind taking a little drink now and then."</p>
<p>She liked Mary Thomas, a tall jolly young prostitute who came
from Kentucky: she was a manicurist in an Altamont Hotel.</p>
<p>"There are two things I want to see," said Mary, "a rooster's
you- know-what and a hen's what-is-it." She was full of loud
compelling laughter. She had a small room with a sleeping porch,
at the front of the house upstairs. Eugene brought her some
cigarettes once: she stood before the window in a thin petticoat,
her feet wide apart, her long sensual legs outlined against the
light.</p>
<p>Helen wore her dresses, hats, and silk stockings. Sometimes
they drank together. And, with humorous sentimentality, she
defended her.</p>
<p>"Well, she's no hypocrite. That's one thing sure. She doesn't
care who knows it." Or,</p>
<p>"She's no worse than a lot of your little goody-goodies, if
the truth's known. She's only more open about it."</p>
<p>Or again, irritated at some implied criticism of her own
friendliness with the girl, she would say angrily:</p>
<p>"What do you know about her? You'd better be careful how you
talk about people. You'll get into trouble about it some
day."</p>
<p>Nevertheless, she was scrupulous in her public avoidance of
the girl and, illogically, in a moment of unreasoning annoyance
she would attack Eliza:</p>
<p>"Why do you keep such people in your house, mama? Every one in
town knows about her. Your place is getting the reputation of a
regular chippyhouse all over town."</p>
<p>Eliza pursed her lips angrily:</p>
<p>"I don't pay any attention to them," she said. "I consider
myself as good as any one. I hold my head up, and I expect every
one else to do likewise. You don't catch me associating with
them."</p>
<p>It was part of her protective mechanism. She pretended to be
proudly oblivious to any disagreeable circumstance which brought
her in money. As a result, by that curious impalpable
advertisement which exists among easy women, Dixieland became
known to them&mdash;they floated casually in&mdash;the
semi-public, clandestine prostitutes of a tourist town.</p>
<p>Helen had drifted apart from most of her friends of high
school days&mdash;the hard-working plain-faced Genevieve Pratt,
daughter of a schoolmaster, "Teeney" Duncan, Gertrude Brown. Her
companions now were livelier, if somewhat more vulgar, young
women&mdash;Grace Deshaye, a plumber's daughter, an opulent
blonde; Pearl Hines, daughter of a Baptist saddlemaker: she was
heavy of body and face, but she had a powerful rag-time singing
voice.</p>
<p>Her closest companion, however, was a girl whose name was Nan
Gudger: she was a brisk, slender, vital girl, with a waist so
tightly corsetted that a man's hands might go around it. She was
the trusted, accurate, infallible bookkeeper of a grocery store.
She contributed largely to the support of her family&mdash;a
mother whom Eugene looked upon with sick flesh, because of the
heavy goitre that sagged from her loose neck; a crippled sister
who moved about the house by means of crutches and the propulsive
strength of her powerful shoulders; and two brothers, hulking
young thugs of twenty and eighteen years, who always bore upon
their charmed bodies fresh knife-wounds, blue lumps and
swellings, and other marks of their fights in poolroom and
brothel. They lived in a two-story shack of rickety lumber on
Clingman Street: the women worked uncomplainingly in the support
of the young men. Eugene went here with Helen often: she liked
the vulgarity, the humor, the excitement of their lives&mdash;and
it amused her particularly to listen to Mary's obscene earthy
conversation.</p>
<p>Upon the first of every month, Nan and Mary gave to the boys a
portion of their earnings, for pocket money and for their monthly
visit to the women of Eagle Crescent.</p>
<p>"Oh, SURELY not, Mary? Good heavens!" said Helen with eager
unbelief.</p>
<p>"Why, hell yes, honey," said Mary, grinning her coarse drawl,
taking her snuff-stick out of the brown corner of her mouth, and
holding it in her strong hand. "We always give the boys money fer
a woman once a month."</p>
<p>"Oh, NO! You're joking," Helen said, laughing.</p>
<p>"Good God, child, don't you know THAT?" said Mary, spitting
inaccurately at the fire. "Hit's good for their health. They'd
git sick if we didn't."</p>
<p>Eugene began to slide helplessly toward the floor. He got an
instant panorama of the whole astonishing picture of humor and
solemn superstition&mdash;the women contributing their money, in
the interests of sanitation and health, to the debauches of the
two grinning hairy nicotined young louts.</p>
<p>"What're you laughin' at, son?" said Mary, gooching him
roughly in the ribs, as he lay panting and prostrate. "You ain't
hardly out of didies yet."</p>
<p>She had all the savage passion of a mountaineer: crippled, she
lived in the coarse heat of her brothers' lust. They were crude,
kindly, ignorant, and murderous people. Nan was scrupulously
respectable and well-mannered: she had thick negroid lips that
turned outward, and hearty tropical laughter. She replaced the
disreputable furniture of the house by new shiny Grand Rapids
chairs and tables. There was a varnished bookcase, forever
locked, stored with stiff sets of unread books&mdash;The Harvard
Classics, and a cheap encyclop&aelig;dia.</p>
<p>When Mrs. Selborne first came to Dixieland from the hot South
she was only twenty-three but she looked older. Ripeness with her
was all: she was a tall heavy-bodied blonde, well kept and
elegant. She moved leisurely with a luxurious sensual swing of
the body: her smile was tender and full of vague allurement, her
voice gentle, her sudden laughter, bubbling out of midnight
secrecy, rich and full. She was one of several handsome and
bacchic daughters of a depleted South Carolinian of good family;
she had married at sixteen a red heavy man who came and went from
her incomparable table, eating rapidly and heartily, muttering,
when pressed, a few shy-sullen words, and departing to the closed
leather-and-horse smell of his little office in the livery-stable
he owned. She had two children by him, both girls: she moved with
wasted stealth around all the quiet slander of a South Carolina
mill-town, committing adultery carefully with a mill owner, a
banker, and a lumber man, walking circumspectly with her tender
blonde smile by day past all the sly smiles of town and trade,
knowing that the earth was mined below her feet, and that her
name, with clerk and merchant, was a sign for secret laughter.
The natives, the men in particular, treated her with even more
elaborate respect than a woman is usually given in a Southern
town, but their eyes, behind the courteous unctions of their
masks, were shiny with invitation.</p>
<p>Eugene felt when he first saw her, and knew about her, that
she would never be caught and always known. His love for her was
desperate. She was the living symbol of his desire&mdash;the dim
vast figure of love and maternity, ageless and autumnal, waiting,
corn- haired, deep-breasted, blonde of limb, in the ripe fields
of harvest&mdash;Demeter, Helen, the ripe exhaustless and
renewing energy, the cradling nurse of weariness and
disenchantment. Below the thrust of Spring, the sharp knife, the
voices of the young girls in the darkness, the sharp inchoate
expectancies of youth, his deep desire burned inextinguishably:
something turned him always to the older women.</p>
<p>When Mrs. Selborne first came to Dixieland her oldest child
was seven years old, her youngest five. She received a small
check from her husband every week, and a substantial one from the
lumber man. She brought a negro girl with her: she was lavish in
her dispensations to the negress, and to her children: this
wastefulness, ease of living, and her rich seductive laughter
fascinated Helen, drew her to the older woman.</p>
<p>And, at night, as Eugene listened to the low sweet voice of
the woman, heard the rich sensual burst of her laughter, as she
sat in the dark porch with a commercial traveller or some
merchant in the town, his blood grew bitter with the morality of
jealousy: he withered with his hurt, thought of her little
sleeping children, and, with a passionate sense of fraternity, of
her gulled husband. He dreamed of himself as the redemptive hero,
saving her in an hour of great danger, making her penitent with
grave reproof, accepting purely the love she offered.</p>
<p>In the morning, he breathed the seminal odor of her fresh
bathed body as she passed him, gazed desperately into the tender
sensuality of her face and, with a sense of unreality, wondered
what change darkness wrought in this untelling face.</p>
<p>Steve returned from New Orleans after a year of vagabondage.
The old preposterous swagger, following the ancient whine,
reappeared as soon as he felt himself safely established at home
again.</p>
<p>"Stevie doesn't have to work," said he. "He's smart enough to
make the others work for him." This was his defiance to his
record of petty forgeries against Gant: he saw himself as a
clever swindler although he had never had courage to swindle any
one except his father. People were reading the Get-Rich-Quick
Wallingford stories: there was an immense admiration for this
romantic criminal.</p>
<p>Steve was now a young man in the first twenties. He was
somewhat above the middle height, bumpy of face and sallow of
skin, with a light pleasing tenor voice. Eugene had a feeling of
disgust and horror whenever his oldest brother returned: he knew
that those who were physically least able to defend themselves,
which included Eliza and himself, would bear the brunt of his
whining, petty bullying, and drunken obscenity. He did not mind
the physical abuse so much as he did its cowardly stealth,
weakness, and slobbering reconciliations.</p>
<p>Once, Gant, making one of his sporadic efforts to get his son
fixed in employment, had sent him out to a country graveyard to
put up a small monument. Eugene was sent along. Steve worked
steadily in the hot sun for an hour, growing more and more
irritable because of the heat, the rank weedy stench of the
graveyard, and his own deep antipathy to work. Eugene waited
intensely for the attack he knew was coming.</p>
<p>"What are you standing there for?" screamed Big Brother at
length, looking up in an agony of petulance. He struck sharply at
the boy's shin with a heavy wrench he held in his hand, knocking
him to the ground, and crippling him for the moment. Immediately,
he was palsied, not with remorse, but with fear that he had
injured him badly and would be discovered.</p>
<p>"You're not hurt, are you, buddy? You're not hurt?" he began
in a quivering voice, putting his unclean yellow hands upon
Eugene. And he made the effort at reconciliation Eugene so
dreaded, whimpering, blowing his foul breath upon his brother's
cringing flesh, and entreating him to say nothing of the
occurrence when he went home. Eugene became violently nauseated:
the stale odor of Steve's body, the clammy and unhealthy sweat
that stank with nicotine, the touch of his tainted flesh filled
him with horror.</p>
<p>There still remained, however, in the cast and carriage of his
head, in his swagger walk, the ghost of his ruined boyishness:
women were sometimes attracted to him. It was his fortune,
therefore, to secure Mrs. Selborne for his mistress the first
summer she came to Dixieland. At night her rich laughter welled
up from the dark porch, they walked through the quiet leafy
streets, they went to Riverside together, walking beyond the
lights of the carnival into the dark sandy paths by the
river.</p>
<p>But, as her friendship with Helen ripened, as she saw the
revulsion of the Gants against their brother, and as she began to
see what damage she had already done to herself by her union with
this braggart who had brandished her name through every poolroom
in town as a tribute to his own power, she cast him off, quietly,
implacably, tenderly. When she returned now, summer by summer,
she met with her innocent and unwitting smile all of his obscene
innuendoes, his heavily suggestive threats, his bitter
revelations behind her back. Her affection for Helen was genuine,
but it was also, she felt, strategic and useful. The girl
introduced her to handsome young men, gave parties and dances at
Gant's and Eliza's for her, was really a partner in her
intrigues, assuring her of privacy, silence, and darkness, and
defending her angrily when the evil whispering began.</p>
<p>"What do you know about her? You don't know what she does.
You'd better be careful how you talk about her. She's got a
husband to defend her, you know. You'll get your head shot off
some day." Or, more doubtfully:</p>
<p>"Well, I don't care what they say, I like her. She's mighty
sweet. After all, what can we say about her for sure? No one can
PROVE anything on her."</p>
<p>And in the winters now she made short visits to the South
Carolina town where Mrs. Selborne lived, returning with an
enthusiastic description of her reception, the parties "in her
honor," the food, the lavish entertainment. Mrs. Selborne lived
in the same town as Joe Gambell, the young clerk to whom Daisy
was engaged. He was full of sly hints about the woman, but before
her his manner was obsequious, confused, reverential, and he
accepted without complaint the presents of food and clothing
which she sent him after their marriage.</p>
<p>Daisy had been married in the month of June following Eliza's
purchase of Dixieland: the wedding was arranged on a lavish
scale, and took place in the big dining-room of the house. Gant
and his two older sons grinned sheepishly in unaccustomed evening
dress, the Pentlands, faithful in their attendance at weddings
and funerals, sent gifts and came. Will and Pett gave a heavy set
of carving steels.</p>
<p>"I hope you always have something to use them on," said Will,
flensing his hand, and winking at Joe Gambell.</p>
<p>Eugene remembered weeks of frantic preparation, dress
fittings, rehearsals, the hysteria of Daisy, who stared at her
nails until they went blue, and the final splendor of the last
two days&mdash;the arriving gifts, the house, unnaturally
cheerful with rich carpets and flowers, the perilous moment when
their lives joined, the big packed dining-room, the droning
interminable Scotch voice of the Presbyterian minister, the
mounting triumph of the music when the grocery clerk got his
bride. Later, the confusion, the greetings, the hysteria of the
women. Daisy sobbing uncontrollably in the arms of a distant
cousin, Beth Pentland, who had come up with her hearty red
husband, the owner of a chain of small groceries in a South
Carolina town, bringing gifts and a giant watermelon, and whose
own grief was enhanced by the discovery, after the wedding, that
the dress she had worked on weeks in advance she had put on, in
her frenzy, wrong side out.</p>
<p>Thus Daisy passed more or less definitely out of Eugene's
life, although he was to see her briefly on visits, but with
decreasing frequency, in the years that followed. The grocery
clerk was making the one daring gesture of his life: he was
breaking away from the cotton town, in which all the years of his
life had been passed, and from the long lazy hours of grocery
clerks, the languorous gossip of lank cotton farmers and
townsmen, to which he had been used. He had found employment as a
commercial traveller for a food products company: his
headquarters was to be in Augusta, Georgia, but he was to travel
into the far South.</p>
<p>This rooting up of his life, this adventure into new lands,
the effort to improve his fortune and his state, was his wedding
gift to his wife&mdash;a bold one, but imperilled already by
distrust, fear, and his peasant suspicion of new scenes, new
faces, new departures, of any life that differed from that of his
village.</p>
<p>"There's no place like Henderson," said he, with complacent
and annoying fidelity, referring to that haven of enervation, red
clay, ignorance, slander, and superstition, in whose effluent
rays he had been reared.</p>
<p>But he went to Augusta, and began his new life with Daisy in a
lodging house. She was twenty-one, a slender, blushing girl who
played the piano beautifully, accurately, academically, with a
rippling touch, and no imagination. Eugene could never remember
her very well.</p>
<p>In the early autumn after her marriage, Gant made the journey
to Augusta, taking Eugene with him. The inner excitement of both
was intense; the hot wait at the sleepy junction of Spartanburg,
the ride in the dilapidated day coaches of the branch line that
ran to Augusta, the hot baked autumnal land, rolling piedmont and
pine woods, every detail of the landscape they drank in with
thirsty adventurous eyes. Gant's roving spirit was parched for
lack of travel: for Eugene, Saint Louis was a faint unreality,
but there burned in him a vision of the opulent South, stranger
even than his passionate winter nostalgia for the snow-bound
North, which the drifted but short-lived snows in Altamont, the
seizure of the unaccustomed moment for sledding and skating on
the steep hills awakened in him with a Northern desire, a desire
for the dark, the storm, the winds that roar across the earth and
the triumphant comfort of warm walls which only a Southerner
perhaps can know.</p>
<p>And he saw the town of Augusta first not in the drab hues of
reality, but as one who bursts a window into the faery pageant of
the world, as one who has lived in prison, and finds life and the
earth in rosy dawn, as one who has lived in all the fabulous
imagery of books, and finds in a journey only an extension and
verification of it&mdash;so did he see Augusta, with the fresh
washed eyes of a child, with glory, with enchantment.</p>
<p>They were gone two weeks. He remembered chiefly the brown
stains of the recent flood, which had flowed through the town and
inundated its lower floors, the broad main street, the odorous
and gleaming drugstore, scented to him with all the spices of his
fancy, the hills and fields of Aiken, in South Carolina, where he
sought vainly for John D. Rockefeller, a legendary prince who, he
heard, went there for sport, marvelling that two States could
join imperceptibly, without visible markings, and the cotton gin
where he saw the great press mash the huge raw bales cleanly into
tight bundles half their former size.</p>
<p>Once, some children on the street had taunted him because of
his long hair, and he had fallen into a cursing fury; once, in a
rage at some quarrel with his sister, he set off on a world
adventure, walking furiously for hours down a country road by the
river and cotton fields, captured finally by Gant who sought for
him in a hired rig.</p>
<p>They went to the theatre: it was one of the first plays he had
seen. The play was a biblical one, founded on the story of Saul
and Jonathan, and he whispered to Gant from scene to scene the
trend of coming events&mdash;a precocity which pleased his father
mightily, and to which he referred for months.</p>
<p>Just before they came home, Joe Gambell, in a fit of concocted
petulance, resigned his position, and announced that he was
returning to Henderson. His adventure had lasted three
months.</p>
<h3>13</h3>
<p>In the years that followed, up to his eleventh or twelfth year
when he could no longer travel on half fares, Eugene voyaged year
by year into the rich mysterious South. Eliza, who, during her
first winter at Dixieland, had been stricken by severe attacks of
rheumatism, induced partly by kidney trouble, which caused her
flesh to swell puffily, and which was diagnosed by the doctor as
Blight's Disease, began to make extensive, although economical,
voyages into Florida and Arkansas in search of health and, rather
vaguely, in search of wealth.</p>
<p>She always spoke hopefully of the possibility of opening a
boarding-house at some tropical winter resort, during the seasons
there and in Altamont. In winter now, she rented Dixieland for a
few months, sometimes for a year, although she really had no
intention of allowing the place to slip through her fingers
during the profitable summer season: usually, she let the place
go, more or less deliberately, to some unscrupulous adventuress
of lodging houses, good for a month's or two months' rent, but
incapable of the sustained effort that would support it for a
longer time. On her return from her journey, with rents in
arrears, or with some other violation of the contract as an
entering wedge, Eliza would surge triumphantly into battle,
making a forced entrance with police, plain-clothes men,
warrants, summonses, writs, injunctions, and all the other
artillery of legal warfare, possessing herself forcibly, and with
vindictive pleasure, of her property.</p>
<p>But she turned always into the South&mdash;the North for her
was a land which she threatened often to explore, but which
secretly she held in suspicion: there was in her no deep
animosity because of an old war, her feeling was rather one of
fear, distrust, alienation&mdash;the "Yankee" to whom she
humorously referred was foreign and remote. So, she turned always
into the South, the South that burned like Dark Helen in Eugene's
blood, and she always took him with her. They still slept
together.</p>
<p>His feeling for the South was not so much historic as it was
of the core and desire of dark romanticism&mdash;that unlimited
and inexplicable drunkenness, the magnetism of some men's blood
that takes them into the heart of the heat, and beyond that, into
the polar and emerald cold of the South as swiftly as it took the
heart of that incomparable romanticist who wrote The Rime of the
Ancient Mariner, beyond which there is nothing. And this desire
of his was unquestionably enhanced by all he had read and
visioned, by the romantic halo that his school history cast over
the section, by the whole fantastic distortion of that period
where people were said to live in "mansions," and slavery was a
benevolent institution, conducted to a constant banjo-strumming,
the strewn largesses of the colonel and the shuffle-dance of his
happy dependents, where all women were pure, gentle, and
beautiful, all men chivalrous and brave, and the Rebel horde a
company of swagger, death-mocking cavaliers. Years later, when he
could no longer think of the barren spiritual wilderness, the
hostile and murderous intrenchment against all new
life&mdash;when their cheap mythology, their legend of the charm
of their manner, the aristocratic culture of their lives, the
quaint sweetness of their drawl, made him writhe&mdash;when he
could think of no return to their life and its swarming
superstition without weariness and horror, so great was his fear
of the legend, his fear of their antagonism, that he still
pretended the most fanatic devotion to them, excusing his
Northern residence on grounds of necessity rather than
desire.</p>
<p>Finally, it occurred to him that these people had given him
nothing, that neither their love not their hatred could injure
him, that he owed them nothing, and he determined that he would
say so, and repay their insolence with a curse. And he did.</p>
<p>So did his boundaries stretch into enchantment&mdash;into
fabulous and solitary wonder broken only by Eliza's stingy
practicality, by her lack of magnificence in a magnificent world,
by the meals of sweet rolls and milk and butter in an untidy
room, by the shoe boxes of luncheon carried on the trains and
opened in the diner, after a lengthy inspection of the menu had
led to the ordering of coffee, by the interminable quarrels over
price and charges in almost every place they went, by her
commands to him to "scrooch up" when the conductor came through
for the tickets, for he was a tall lank boy, and his half-fare
age might be called to question.</p>
<p>She took him to Florida in the late winter following Gant's
return from Augusta: they went to Tampa first, and, a few days
later, to Saint Petersburg. He plowed through the loose deep sand
of the streets, fished interminably with jolly old men at the end
of the long pier, devoured a chest full of dime novels that he
found in the rooms she had rented in a private house. They left
abruptly, after a terrific quarrel with the old Cracker who ran
the place, who thought himself tricked out of the best part of a
season's rent, and hurried off to South Carolina on receipt of a
hysterical message from Daisy which bade her mother to "come at
once." They arrived in the dingy little town, which was sticky
with wet clay, and clammy with rain, in late March: Daisy's first
child, a boy, had been born the day before. Eliza, annoyed at
what she considered the useless disruption of her holiday,
quarrelled bitterly with her daughter a day or two after her
arrival, and departed for Altamont with the declaration, which
Daisy ironically applauded, that she would never return again.
But she did.</p>
<p>The following winter she went to New Orleans at the season of
the Mardi Gras, taking her youngest with her. Eugene remembered
the huge cisterns for rain-water, in the back yard of Aunt Mary's
house, the heavy window-rattling thunder of Mary's snores at
night, and the vast pageantry of carnival on Canal Street: the
storied floats, the smiling beauties, the marching troops, the
masks grotesque and fantastical. And once more he saw ships at
anchor at the foot of Canal Street; and their tall keels looked
over on the street behind the sea walls; and in the cemeteries
all the graves were raised above the ground "because," said Oll,
Gant's nephew, "the water rots 'em."</p>
<p>And he remembered the smells of the French market, the heavy
fragrance of the coffee he drank there, and the foreign Sunday
gaiety of the city's life&mdash;the theatres open, the sound of
hammer and saw, the gay festivity of crowds. He visited the
Boyles, old guests at Dixieland, who lived in the old French
quarter, sleeping at night with Frank Boyle in a vast dark room
lighted dimly with tapers: they had as cook an ancient negress
who spoke only French, and who returned from the Market early in
the morning bearing a huge basket loaded with vegetables,
tropical fruits, fowls, meats. She cooked strange delicious food
that he had never tasted before&mdash;heavy gumbo, garnished
steaks, sauced fowls.</p>
<p>And he looked upon the huge yellow snake of the river,
dreaming of its distant shores, the myriad estuaries lush with
tropical growth that fed it, all the romantic life of plantation
and canefields that fringed it, of moonlight, of dancing darkies
on the levee, of slow lights on the gilded river boat, and the
perfumed flesh of black-haired women, musical wraiths below the
phantom drooping trees.</p>
<p>They had but shortly returned from Mardi Gras when, one
howling night in winter, as he lay asleep at Gant's, the house
was wakened by his father's terrible cries. Gant had been
drinking heavily, day after fearful day. Eugene had been sent in
the afternoons to his shop to fetch him home, and at sundown,
with Jannadeau's aid, had brought him, behind the negro's
spavined horse, roaring drunk to his house. There followed the
usual routine of soup-feeding, undressing, and holding him in
check until Doctor McGuire arrived, thrust his needle deeply into
Gant's stringy arm, left sleeping- powders, and departed. The
girl was exhausted: Gant himself had ravaged his strength, and
had been brought down by two or three painful attacks of
rheumatism.</p>
<p>Now, he awoke in the dark, possessed by his terror and agony,
for the whole right side of his body was paralyzed by such pain
as he did not know existed. He cursed and supplicated God
alternately in his pain and terror. For days doctor and nurse
strove with him, hoping that the leaping inflammation would not
strike at his heart. He was gnarled, twisted, and bent with a
savage attack of inflammatory rheumatism. As soon as he had
recovered sufficiently to travel, he departed, under Helen's
care, for Hot Springs. Almost savagely, she drove all other
assistance from him, devoting every minute of the day to his
care: they were gone six weeks&mdash;occasionally post-cards and
letters describing a life of hotels, mineral baths, sickness and
lameness, and the sport of the blooded rich, came to add new
colors to Eugene's horizon: when they returned Gant was able
again to walk, the rheumatism had been boiled from his limbs, but
his right hand, gnarled and stiff, was permanently crippled. He
was never again able to close it, and there was something
strangely chastened in his manner, a gleam of awe and terror in
his eyes.</p>
<p>But the union between Gant and his daughter was finally
consummated. Before Gant lay, half-presaged, a road of pain and
terror which led on to death, but as his great strength dwindled,
palsied, broke along that road, she went with him inch by inch,
welding beyond life, beyond death, beyond memory, the bond that
linked them.</p>
<p>"I'd have died if it hadn't been for that girl," he said over
and over. "She saved my life. I couldn't get along without her."
And he boasted again and again of her devotion and loyalty, of
the expenses of his journey, of the hotels, the wealth, the life
they both had seen.</p>
<p>And, as the legend of Helen's goodness and devotion grew, and
his dependence upon her got further advertisement, Eliza pursed
her lips more and more thoughtfully, wept sometimes into the
spitting grease of a pan, smiled, beneath her wide red nose, a
smile tremulous, bitter, terribly hurt.</p>
<p>"I'll show them," she wept. "I'll show them." And she rubbed
thoughtfully at a red itching patch that had appeared during the
year upon the back of her left hand.</p>
<p>She went to Hot Springs in the winter that followed. They
stopped at Memphis for a day or two: Steve was at work there in a
paint store; he slipped quickly in and out of saloons, as he took
Eugene about the city, leaving the boy outside for a moment while
he went "in here to see a fellow"&mdash;a "fellow" who always
sent him forth, Eugene thought, with an added impetuosity to his
swagger.</p>
<p>Dizzily they crossed the river: at night he saw the small
bleared shacks of Arkansas set in malarial fields.</p>
<p>Eliza sent him to one of the public schools of Hot Springs: he
plunged heavily into the bewildering new world&mdash;performed
brilliantly, and won the affection of the young woman who taught
him, but paid the penalty of the stranger to all the hostile and
banded little creatures of the class. Before his first month was
out, he had paid desperately for his ignorance of their
customs.</p>
<p>Eliza boiled herself out at the baths daily; sometimes, he
went along with her, leaving her with a sensation of drunken
independence, while he went into the men's quarters, stripping
himself in a cool room, entering thence a hot one lined with
couches, shutting himself in a steam-closet where he felt himself
momentarily dwindling into the raining puddle of sweat at his
feet, to emerge presently on trembling legs and to be rolled and
kneaded about magnificently in a huge tub by a powerful grinning
negro. Later, languorous, but with a feeling of deep
purification, he lay out on one of the couches, victoriously his
own man in a man's world. They talked from couch to couch, or
walked pot-belliedly about, sashed coyly with bath
towels&mdash;malarial Southerners with malarial drawls,
paunch-eyed alcoholics, purple-skinned gamblers, and broken down
prize-fighters. He liked the smell of steam and of the sweaty
men.</p>
<p>Eliza sent him out on the streets at once with The Saturday
Evening Post.</p>
<p>"It won't hurt you to do a little light work after school,"
said she. And as he trudged off with his sack slung from his
neck, she would call after him:</p>
<p>"Spruce up, boy! Spruce up! Throw your shoulders back. Make
folks think you're somebody." And she gave him a pocketful of
printed cards, which bore this inscription:</p>
<blockquote>SPEND YOUR SUMMERS AT<br>
DIXIELAND<br>
In Beautiful Altamont,<br>
America's Switzerland.<br>
Rates Reasonable&mdash;Both Transient and Tourist.<br>
Apply Eliza E. Gant, Prop.</blockquote>
<p>"You've got to help me drum up some trade, if we're to live,
boy," she said again, with the lip-pursing, mouth-tremulous
jocularity that was coming to wound him so deeply, because he
felt it was only an obvious mask for a more obvious
insincerity.</p>
<p>He writhed as he saw himself finally a toughened pachyderm in
Eliza's world&mdash;sprucing up confidently, throwing his
shoulders back proudly, making people "think he was somebody" as
he cordially acknowledged an introduction by producing a card
setting forth the joys of life in Altamont and at Dixieland, and
seized every opening in social relations for the purpose of
"drumming up trade." He hated the jargon of the profession, which
she had picked up somewhere long before, and which she used
constantly with such satisfaction&mdash;smacking her lips as she
spoke of "transients," or of "drumming up trade." In him, as in
Gant, there was a silent horror of selling for money the bread of
one's table, the shelter of one's walls, to the guest, the
stranger, the unknown friend from out the world; to the sick, the
weary, the lonely, the broken, the knave, the harlot, and the
fool.</p>
<p>Thus, lost in the remote Ozarks, he wandered up Central
Avenue, fringed on both sides by the swift-sloping hills, for
him, by the borders of enchantment, the immediate portals of a
land of timeless and never-ending faery. He drank endlessly the
water that came smoking from the earth, hoping somehow to wash
himself clean from all pollution, beginning his everlasting
fantasy of the miraculous spring, or the bath, neck-high, of
curative mud, which would draw out of a man's veins each drop of
corrupted blood, dry up in him a cancerous growth, dwindle and
absorb a cyst, remove all scorbutic blemishes, scoop and suck and
thread away the fibrous slime of all disease, leaving him again
with the perfect flesh of an animal.</p>
<p>And he gazed for hours into the entrances of the fashionable
hotels, staring at the ladies' legs upon the verandas, watching
the great ones of the land at their recreations, thinking, with a
pang of wonder, that here were the people of Chambers, of
Phillips, of all the society novelists, leading their godlike
lives in flesh, recording their fiction. He was deeply
reverential before the grand manner of these books, particularly
before the grand manner of the English books: there people loved,
but not as other people, elegantly; their speech was subtle,
delicate, exquisite; even in their passions there was no gross
lust or strong appetite&mdash;they were incapable of the vile
thoughts or the meaty desire of common people. As he looked at
the comely thighs of the young women on horses, fascinated to see
their shapely legs split over the strong good smell of a horse,
he wondered if the warm sinuous vibration of the great horse-back
excited them, and what their love was like. The preposterous
elegance of their manner in the books awed him: he saw seduction
consummated in kid gloves, to the accompaniment of subtle
repartee. Such thoughts, when he had them, filled him with shame
at his own baseness&mdash;he imagined for these people a love
conducted beyond all the laws of nature, achieving the delight of
animals or of common men by the electrical touch of a finger, the
flicker of an eye, the intonation of a phrase&mdash;exquisitely
and incorruptibly.</p>
<p>And as they looked at his remote fabulous face, more strange
now that its thick fringing curls had been shorn, they bought of
him, paying him several times his fee, with the lazy penitence of
wasters.</p>
<p>Great fish within the restaurant windows swam in glass
wells&mdash;eels coiled snakily, white-bellied trout veered and
sank: he dreamed of strange rich foods within.</p>
<p>And sometimes men returned in carriages from the distant
river, laden with great fish, and he wondered if he would ever
see that river. All that lay around him, near but unexplored,
filled him with desire and longing.</p>
<p>And later, again, along the sandy coast of Florida, with
Eliza, he wandered down the narrow lanes of Saint Augustine,
raced along the hard packed beach of Daytona, scoured the green
lawns of Palm Beach, before the hotels, for cocoanuts, which
Eliza desired as souvenirs, filling a brown tow sack with them
and walking, with the bag hung from his shoulders, down the
interminable aisles of the Royal Poinciana or the Breakers,
target of scorn, and scandal, and amusement from slave and
prince; or traversed the spacious palm- cool walks that cut the
peninsula, to see, sprawled in the sensual loose sand the ladies'
silken legs, the brown lean bodies of the men, the long
seaplunges in the unending scroll-work of the emerald and
infinite sea, which had beat in his brain from his father's
shells, which had played at his mountain heart, but which never,
until now, had he seen. Through the spattered sunlight of the
palms, in the smooth walks, princess and lord were wheeled: in
latticed bar-rooms, droning with the buzzing fans, men drank from
glac&eacute;d tall glasses.</p>
<p>Or again, they came to Jacksonville, lived there for several
weeks near Pett and Greeley; he studied under a little crippled
man from Harvard, going to lunch with his teacher at a buffet,
where the man consumed beer and pretzels. Eliza protested the
tuition when she left: the cripple shrugged his shoulders, took
what she had to offer. Eugene twisted his neck about, and lifted
his foot from the ground.</p>
<p>Thus did he see first, he the hill-bound, the sky-girt, of
whom the mountains were his masters, the fabulous South. The
picture of flashing field, of wood, and hill, stayed in his heart
forever: lost in the dark land, he lay the night-long through
within his berth, watching the shadowy and phantom South flash
by, sleeping at length, and waking suddenly, to see cool lakes in
Florida at dawn, standing quietly as if they had waited from
eternity for this meeting; or hearing, as the train in the dark
hours of morning slid into Savannah, the strange quiet voices of
the men upon the platform, the boding faint echoes of the
station, or seeing, in pale dawn, the phantom woods, a rutted
lane, a cow, a boy, a drab, dull-eyed against a cottage door,
glimpsed, at this moment of rushing time, for which all life had
been aplot, to flash upon the window and be gone.</p>
<p>The commonness of all things in the earth he remembered with a
strange familiarity&mdash;he dreamed of the quiet roads, the
moonlit woodlands, and he thought that some day he would come to
them on foot, and find them there unchanged, in all the wonder of
recognition. They had existed for him anciently and forever.</p>
<p>Eugene was almost twelve years old.</p>
<h2>PART TWO</h2>
<h3>14</h3>
<p>The plum-tree, black and brittle, rocks stiffly in winter
wind. Her million little twigs are frozen in spears of ice. But
in the Spring, lithe and heavy, she will bend under her great
load of fruit and blossoms. She will grow young again. Red plums
will ripen, will be shaken desperately upon the tiny stems. They
will fall bursted on the loamy warm wet earth; when the wind
blows in the orchard the air will be filled with dropping plums;
the night will be filled with the sound of their dropping, and a
great tree of birds will sing, burgeoning, blossoming richly,
filling the air also with warm-throated plum-dropping
bird-notes.</p>
<p>The harsh hill-earth has moistly thawed and softened, rich
soaking rain falls, fresh-bladed tender grass like soft hair
growing sparsely streaks the land.</p>
<p>My Brother Ben's face, thought Eugene, is like a piece of
slightly yellow ivory; his high white head is knotted fiercely by
his old man's scowl; his mouth is like a knife, his smile the
flicker of light across a blade. His face is like a blade, and a
knife, and a flicker of light: it is delicate and fierce, and
scowls beautifully forever, and when he fastens his hard white
fingers and his scowling eyes upon a thing he wants to fix, he
sniffs with sharp and private concentration through his long
pointed nose. Thus women, looking, feel a well of tenderness for
his pointed, bumpy, always scowling face: his hair shines like
that of a young boy&mdash;it is crinkled and crisp as
lettuce.</p>
<p>Into the April night-and-morning streets goes Ben. The night
is brightly pricked with cool and tender stars. The orchard stirs
leafily in the short fresh wind. Ben prowls softly out of the
sleeping house. His thin bright face is dark within the orchard.
There is a smell of nicotine and shoe leather under the young
blossoms. His pigeon-toed tan shoes ring musically up the empty
streets. Lazily slaps the water in the fountain on the Square;
all the firemen are asleep&mdash;but Big Bill Merrick, the brave
cop, hog- jowled and red, leans swinishly over mince-pie and
coffee in Uneeda Lunch. The warm good ink-smell beats in rich
waves into the street: a whistling train howls off into the
Springtime South.</p>
<p>By the cool orchards in the dark the paper-carriers go. The
copper legs of negresses in their dark dens stir. The creek
brawls cleanly.</p>
<p>A new one, Number 6, heard boys speak of Foxy:</p>
<p>"Who's Foxy?" asked Number 6.</p>
<p>"Foxy's a bastard, Number 6. Don't let him catch you."</p>
<p>"The bastard caught me three times last week. In the Greek's
every time. Why can't they let us eat?"</p>
<p>Number 3 thought of Friday morning&mdash;he had the Niggertown
route.</p>
<p>"How many&mdash;3?"</p>
<p>"One hundred and sixty-two."</p>
<p>"How many Dead Heads you got, son?" said Mr. Randall
cynically. "Do you ever try to collect from them?" he added,
thumbing through the book.</p>
<p>"He takes it out in Poon-Tang," said Foxy, grinning, "A week's
subscription free for a dose."</p>
<p>"What you got to say about it?" asked Number 3 belligerently.
"You've been knocking down on them for six years."</p>
<p>"Jazz 'em all if you like," said Randall, "but get the money.
Ben, I want you to go round with him Saturday."</p>
<p>Ben laughed silently and cynically into the air:</p>
<p>"Oh, my God!" he said. "Do you expect me to check up on the
little thug? He's been knocking down on you for the last six
months."</p>
<p>"All right! All right!" said Randall, annoyed. "That's what I
want you to find out."</p>
<p>"Oh, for God's sake, Randall," said Ben contemptuously, "he's
got niggers on that book who've been dead for five years. That's
what you get for keeping every little crook that comes
along."</p>
<p>"If you don't get a move on, 3, I'll give your route to
another boy," said Randall.</p>
<p>"Hell, get another boy. I don't care," said Number 3,
toughly.</p>
<p>"Oh, for God's sake! Listen to this, won't you?" said Ben,
laughing thinly and nodding to his angel, indicating Number 3
with a scowling jerk of his head.</p>
<p>"Yes, listen to this, won't you! That's what I said," Number 3
answered pugnaciously.</p>
<p>"All right, little boy. Run on and deliver your papers now,
before you get hurt," said Ben, turning his scowl quietly upon
him and looking at him blackly for a moment. "Ah, you little
crook," he said with profound loathing, "I have a kid brother
who's worth six like you."</p>
<p>Spring lay strewn lightly like a fragrant gauzy scarf upon the
earth; the night was a cool bowl of lilac darkness, filled with
fresh orchard scents.</p>
<p>Gant slept heavily, rattling the loose window-sash with deep
rasping snores; with short explosive thunders, ripping the lilac
night, 36 began to climb Saluda. She bucked helplessly like a
goat, her wheels spun furiously on the rails, Tom Cline stared
seriously down into the milky boiling creek, and waited. She
slipped, spun, held, ploughed slowly up, like a straining mule,
into the dark. Content, he leaned far out the cab and looked: the
starlight glimmered faintly on the rails. He ate a thick sandwich
of cold buttered fried meat, tearing it raggedly and glueily
staining it under his big black fingers. There was a smell of
dogwood and laurel in the cool slow passage of the world. The
cars clanked humpily across the spur; the switchman, bathed
murkily in the hot yellow light of his perilous bank-edged hut,
stood sullen at the switch.</p>
<p>Arms spread upon his cab-sill, chewing thoughtfully, Tom,
goggle- eyed, looked carefully down at him. They had never
spoken. Then in silence he turned and took the milk-bottle, half
full of cold coffee, that his fireman offered him. He washed his
food down with the large easy gurgling swallows of a bishop.</p>
<p>At 18 Valley Street, the red shack-porch, slime-scummed with a
greasy salve of yellow negroid mud, quaked rottenly. Number 3's
square-folded ink-fresh paper struck flat against the door,
falling on its edge stiffly to the porch like a block of light
wood. Within, May Corpening stirred nakedly, muttering as if
doped and moving her heavy copper legs, in the fetid bed-warmth,
with the slow noise of silk.</p>
<p>Harry Tugman lit a Camel, drawing the smoke deep into his
powerful ink-stained lungs as he watched the press run down. His
bare arms were heavy-muscled as his presses. He dropped
comfortably into his pliant creaking chair and tilted back,
casually scanning the warm pungent sheet. Luxurious smoke steamed
slowly from his nostrils. He cast the sheet away.</p>
<p>"Christ!" he said. "What a makeup!"</p>
<p>Ben came down stairs, moody, scowling, and humped over toward
the ice-box.</p>
<p>"For God's sake, Mac," he called out irritably to the Make-up
Man, as he scowled under the lifted lid, "don't you ever keep
anything except root-beer and sour milk?"</p>
<p>"What do you want, for Christ's sake?"</p>
<p>"I'd like to get a Coca-Cola once in a while. You know," he
said bitingly, "Old Man Candler down in Atlanta is still making
it."</p>
<p>Harry Tugman cast his cigarette away.</p>
<p>"They haven't got the news up here yet, Ben," said he. "You'll
have to wait till the excitement over Lee's surrender has died
down. Come on," he said abruptly, getting up, "let's go over to
the Greasy Spoon."</p>
<p>He thrust his big head down into the deep well of the sink,
letting the lukewarm water sluice refreshingly over his broad
neck and blue-white sallow night-time face, strong, tough, and
humorous. He soaped his hands with thick slathering suds, his
muscles twisting slowly like big snakes.</p>
<p>He sang in his powerful quartette baritone:</p>
<blockquote>"Beware! Beware! Beware!<br>
Many brave hearts lie asleep in the deep,<br>
So beware! Bee-WARE!"</blockquote>
<p>Comfortably they rested in the warm completed exhaustion of
the quiet press-room: upstairs the offices, bathed in
green-yellow light, sprawled like men relaxed after work. The
boys had gone to their routes. The place seemed to breathe slowly
and wearily. The dawn-sweet air washed coolly over their faces.
The sky was faintly pearled at the horizon.</p>
<p>Strangely, in sharp broken fragments, life awoke in the lilac
darkness. Clop-clopping slowly on the ringing street, Number Six,
Mrs. Goulderbilt's powerful brown mare, drew inevitably on the
bottle-clinking cream-yellow wagon, racked to the top with creamy
extra-heavy high-priced milk. The driver was a fresh-skinned
young countryman, richly odorous with the smell of fresh sweat
and milk. Eight miles, through the starlit dewy fields and
forests of Biltburn, under the high brick English lodgegate, they
had come into the town.</p>
<p>At the Pisgah Hotel, opposite the station, the last door
clicked softly; the stealthy footfalls of the night ceased; Miss
Bernice Redmond gave the negro porter eight one-dollar bills and
went definitely to bed with the request that she be not disturbed
until one o'clock; a shifting engine slatted noisily about in the
yard; past the Biltburn crossing Tom Cline whistled with even,
mournful respirations. By this time Number 3 had delivered 142 of
his papers; he had only to ascend the rickety wooden stairs of
the Eagle Crescent bank to finish the eight houses of the
Crescent. He looked anxiously across the hill-and-dale-sprawled
negro settlement to the eastern rim: behind Birdseye Gap the sky
was pearl-gray&mdash;the stars looked drowned. Not much time
left, he thought. He had a blond meaty face, pale-colored and
covered thickly with young blond hair. His jaw was long and
fleshy: it sloped backward. He ran his tongue along his full
cracked underlip.</p>
<p>A 1910 model, four-cylinder, seven-passenger Hudson, with
mounting steady roar, shot drunkenly out from the station
curbing, lurched into the level negro-sleeping stretch of South
End Avenue, where the firemen had their tournaments, and zipped
townward doing almost fifty. The station quietly stirred in its
sleep: there were faint reverberating noises under the empty
sheds; brisk hammer-taps upon car wheels, metallic heel-clicks in
the tiled waiting-room. Sleepily a negress slopped water on the
tiles, with languid sullen movement pushing a gray sopping rag
around the floor.</p>
<p>It was now five-thirty. Ben had gone out of the house into the
orchard at three twenty-five. In another forty minutes Gant would
waken, dress, and build the morning fires.</p>
<p>"Ben," said Harry Tugman, as they walked out of the relaxed
office, "if Jimmy Dean comes messing around my press-room again
they can get some one else to print their lousy sheet. What the
hell! I can get a job on the Atlanta Constitution whenever I want
it."</p>
<p>"Did he come down to-night?" asked Ben.</p>
<p>"Yes," said Harry Tugman, "and he got out again. I told him to
take his little tail upstairs."</p>
<p>"Oh, for God's sake!" said Ben. "What did he say?"</p>
<p>"He said, 'I'M the editor! I'm the editor of this paper!' 'I
don't give a good goddam,' I said, 'if you're the President's
snotrag. If you want any paper to-day keep out of the pressroom.'
And believe me, he went!"</p>
<p>In cool blue-pearl darkness they rounded the end of the Post
Office and cut diagonally across the street to Uneeda Lunch No.
3. It was a small beanery, twelve feet wide, wedged in between an
optician's and a Greek shoe parlor.</p>
<p>Within, Dr. Hugh McGuire sat on a stool patiently impaling
kidney beans, one at a time, upon the prongs of his fork. A
strong odor of corn whisky soaked the air about him. His thick
skilful butcher's hands, hairy on the backs, gripped the fork
numbly. His heavy-jowled face was blotted by large brown patches.
He turned round and stared owlishly as Ben entered, fixing the
wavering glare of his bulbous red eyes finally upon him.</p>
<p>"Hello, son," he said in his barking kindly voice, "what can I
do for you?"</p>
<p>"Oh, for God's sake," said Ben laughing contemptuously, and
jerking his head toward Tugman. "Listen to this, won't you?"</p>
<p>They sat down at the lower end. At this moment, Horse Hines,
the undertaker, entered, producing, although he was not a thin
man, the effect of a skeleton clad in a black frock coat. His
long lantern mouth split horsily in a professional smile
displaying big horse teeth in his white heavily starched
face.</p>
<p>"Gentlemen, gentlemen," he said for no apparent reason,
rubbing his lean hands briskly as if it was cold. His palm-flesh
rattled together like old bones.</p>
<p>Coker, the Lung Shark, who had not ceased to regard McGuire's
bean- hunt with sardonic interest, now took the long cigar out of
his devil's head and held it between his stained fingers as he
tapped his companion.</p>
<p>"Let's get out," he grinned quietly, nodding toward Horse
Hines. "It will look bad if we're seen together here."</p>
<p>"Good morning, Ben," said Horse Hines, sitting down below him.
"Are all the folks well?" he added, softly.</p>
<p>Sideways Ben looked at him scowling, then jerked his head back
to the counterman, with a fast bitter flicker of his lips.</p>
<p>"Doctor," said Harry Tugman with servile medicine-man respect,
"what do you charge to operate?"</p>
<p>"Operate what?" McGuire barked presently, having pronged a
kidney bean.</p>
<p>"Why&mdash;appendicitis," said Harry Tugman, for it was all he
could think of.</p>
<p>"Three hundred dollars when we go into the belly," said
McGuire. He coughed chokingly to the side.</p>
<p>"You're drowning in your own secretions," said Coker with his
yellow grin. "Like Old Lady Sladen."</p>
<p>"My God!" said Harry Tugman, thinking jealously of lost news.
"When did she go?"</p>
<p>"To-night," said Coker.</p>
<p>"God, I'm sorry to hear that," said Harry Tugman, greatly
relieved.</p>
<p>"I've just finished laying the old lady out," said Horse Hines
gently. "A bundle of skin and bones." He sighed regretfully, and
for a moment his boiled eye moistened.</p>
<p>Ben turned his scowling head around with an expression of
nausea.</p>
<p>"Joe," said Horse Hines with merry professionalism, "give me a
mug of that embalming fluid." He thrust his horsehead
indicatively at the coffee urn.</p>
<p>"Oh, for God's sake," Ben muttered in terms of loathing. "Do
you ever wash your damned hands before you come in here?" he
burst out irritably.</p>
<p>Ben was twenty. Men did not think of his age.</p>
<p>"Would you like some cold pork, son?" said Coker, with his
yellow malicious grin.</p>
<p>Ben made a retching noise in his throat, and put his hand upon
his stomach.</p>
<p>"What's the matter, Ben?" Harry Tugman laughed heavily and
struck him on the back.</p>
<p>Ben got off the stool, took his coffee mug and the piece of
tanned mince pie he had ordered, and moved to the other side of
Harry Tugman. Every one laughed. Then he jerked his head toward
McGuire with a quick frown.</p>
<p>"By God, Tug," he said. "They've got us cornered."</p>
<p>"Listen to him," said McGuire to Coker. "A chip off the old
block, isn't he? I brought that boy into the world, saw him
through typhoid, got the old man over seven hundred drunks, and
I've been called eighteen different kinds of son of a bitch for
my pains ever since. But let one of 'em get a belly ache," he
added proudly, "and you'll see how quick they come running to me.
Isn't that right, Ben?" he said, turning to him.</p>
<p>"Oh, listen to this!" said Ben, laughing irritably and burying
his peaked face in his coffee mug. His bitter savor filled the
place with life, with tenderness, with beauty. They looked on him
with drunken, kindly eyes&mdash;at his gray scornful face and the
lonely demon flicker of his smile.</p>
<p>"And I tell you something else," said McGuire, ponderously
wheeling around on Coker, "if one of them's got to be cut open,
see who gets the job. What about it, Ben?" he asked.</p>
<p>"By God, if you ever cut me open, McGuire," said Ben, "I'm
going to be damned sure you can walk straight before you do."</p>
<p>"Come on, Hugh," said Coker, prodding McGuire under his
shoulder. "Stop chasing those beans around the plate. Crawl off
or fall off that damned stool&mdash;I don't care which."</p>
<p>McGuire, drunkenly lost in revery, stared witlessly down at
his bean plate and sighed.</p>
<p>"Come on, you damned fool," said Coker, getting up, "you've
got to operate in forty-five minutes."</p>
<p>"Oh, for God's sake," said Ben, lifting his face from the
stained mug, "who's the victim? I'll send flowers."</p>
<p>"...all of us sooner or later," McGuire mumbled puffily
through his puff-lips. "Rich and poor alike. Here to-day and gone
to- morrow. Doesn't matter...doesn't matter at all."</p>
<p>"In heaven's name," Ben burst out irritably to Coker. "Are you
going to let him operate like that? Why don't you shoot them
instead?"</p>
<p>Coker plucked the cigar from his long malarial grinning
face:</p>
<p>"Why, he's just getting hot, son," said he.</p>
<p>Nacreous pearl light swam faintly about the hem of the lilac
darkness; the edges of light and darkness were stitched upon the
hills. Morning moved like a pearl-gray tide across the fields and
up the hill-flanks, flowing rapidly down into the soluble
dark.</p>
<p>At the curb now, young Dr. Jefferson Spaugh brought his Buick
roadster to a halt, and got out, foppishly drawing off his gloves
and flicking the silk lapels of his dinner jacket. His face,
whisky-red, was highboned and handsome; his mouth was
straightlipped, cruel, and sensual. An inherited aura of
mountain-cornfield sweat hung scentlessly but telepathically
about him; he was a smartened-up mountaineer with country-club
and University of Pennsylvania glossings. Four years in Philly
change a man.</p>
<p>Thrusting his gloves carelessly into his coat, he entered.
McGuire slid bearishly off his stool and gazed him into focus.
Then he made beckoning round-arm gestures with his fat hands.</p>
<p>"Look at it, will you," he said. "Does any one know what it
is?"</p>
<p>"It's Percy," said Coker. "You know Percy Van der Gould, don't
you?"</p>
<p>"I've been dancing all night at the Hilliards," said Spaugh
elegantly. "Damn! These new patent-leather pumps have ruined my
feet." He sat upon a stool, and elegantly displayed his large
country feet, indecently broad and angular in the shoes.</p>
<p>"What's he been doing?" said McGuire doubtfully, turning to
Coker for enlightenment.</p>
<p>"He's been dancing all night at the Hilliards," said Coker in
a mincing voice.</p>
<p>McGuire shielded his bloated face coyly with his hand.</p>
<p>"O crush me!" he said, "I'm a grape! Dancing at the Hilliards,
were you, you damned Mountain Grill. You've been on a Poon-Tang
Picnic in Niggertown. You can't load that bunk on us."</p>
<p>Bull-lunged, their laughter filled the nacreous dawn.</p>
<p>"Patent-leather pumps!" said McGuire. "Hurt his feet. By God,
Coker, the first time he came to town ten years ago he'd never
been curried above the knees. They had to throw him down to put
shoes on him."</p>
<p>Ben laughed thinly to the Angel.</p>
<p>"A couple of slices of buttered toast, if you please, not too
brown," said Spaugh delicately to the counterman.</p>
<p>"A mess of hog chitlings and sorghum, you mean, you bastard.
You were brought up on salt pork and cornbread."</p>
<p>"We're getting too low and coarse for him, Hugh," said Coker.
"Now that he's got drunk with some of the best families, he's in
great demand socially. He's so highly thought of that he's become
the official midwife to all pregnant virgins."</p>
<p>"Yes," said McGuire, "he's their friend. He helps them out. He
not only helps them out, he helps them in again."</p>
<p>"What's wrong with that?" said Spaugh. "We ought to keep it in
the family, oughtn't we?"</p>
<p>Their laughter howled out into the tender dawn.</p>
<p>"This conversation is getting too rough for me," said Horse
Hines banteringly as he got off his stool.</p>
<p>"Shake hands with Coker before you go, Horse," said McGuire.
"He's the best friend you've ever had. You ought to give him
royalties."</p>
<p>The light that filled the world now was soft and otherworldly
like the light that fills the sea-floors of Catalina where the
great fish swim. Flatfootedly, with kidney-aching back, Patrolman
Leslie Roberts all unbuttoned slouched through the submarine
pearl light and paused, gently agitating his club behind him, as
he turned his hollow liverish face toward the open door.</p>
<p>"Here's your patient," said Coker softly, "the Constipated
Cop."</p>
<p>Aloud, with great cordiality, they all said: "How are you,
Les?"</p>
<p>"Oh, tolable, tolable," said the policeman mournfully. As
draggled as his mustaches, he passed on, hocking into the gutter
a slimy gob of phlegm.</p>
<p>"Well, good morning, gentlemen," said Horse Hines, making to
go.</p>
<p>"Remember what I told you, Horse. Be good to Coker, your best
friend." McGuire jerked a thumb toward Coker.</p>
<p>Beneath his thin joviality Horse Hines was hurt.</p>
<p>"I do remember," said the undertaker gravely. "We are both
members of honorable professions: in the hour of death when the
storm- tossed ship puts into its haven of rest, we are the
trustees of the Almighty."</p>
<p>"Why, Horse!" Coker exclaimed, "this is eloquence!"</p>
<p>"The sacred rites of closing the eyes, of composing the limbs,
and of preparing for burial the lifeless repository of the
departed soul is our holy mission; it is for us, the living, to
pour balm upon the broken heart of Grief, to soothe the widow's
ache, to brush away the orphan's tears; it is for us, the living,
to highly resolve that&mdash;"</p>
<p>"&mdash;Government of the people, for the people, and by the
people," said Hugh McGuire.</p>
<p>"Yes, Horse," said Coker, "you are right. I'm touched. And
what's more, we do it all for nothing. At least," he added
virtuously, "I never charge for soothing the widow's ache."</p>
<p>"What about embalming the broken heart of Grief?" asked
McGuire.</p>
<p>"I said BALM," Horse Hines remarked coldly.</p>
<p>"Stay, Horse," said Harry Tugman, who had listened with great
interest, "didn't you make a speech with all that in it last
summer at the Undertakers' Convention?"</p>
<p>"What's true then is true now," said Horse Hines bitterly, as
he left the place.</p>
<p>"Jesus!" said Harry Tugman, "we've got him good and sore. I
thought I'd bust a gut, doc, when you pulled that one about
embalming the broken heart of Grief."</p>
<p>At this moment Dr. Ravenel brought his Hudson to a halt across
the street before the Post Office, and walked over rapidly,
drawing his gauntlets off. He was bareheaded; his silver
aristocratic hair was thinly rumpled; his surgical gray eyes
probed restlessly below the thick lenses of his spectacles. He
had a famous, calm, deeply concerned face, shaven, ashen, lean,
lit gravely now and then by humor.</p>
<p>"Oh Christ!" said Coker. "Here comes Teacher!"</p>
<p>"Good morning, Hugh," he said as he entered. "Are you going
into training again for the bughouse?"</p>
<p>"Look who's here!" McGuire roared hospitably. "Dead-eye Dick,
the literary sawbones, whose private collection of gallstones is
the finest in the world. When d'jew get back, son?"</p>
<p>"Just in time, it seems," said Ravenel, holding a cigarette
cleanly between his long surgical fingers. He looked at his
watch. "I believe you have a little engagement at the Ravenel
hospital in about half an hour. Is that right?"</p>
<p>"By God, Dick, you're always right," McGuire yelled
enthusiastically. "What'd you tell 'em up there, boy?"</p>
<p>"I told them," said Dick Ravenel, whose affection was like a
flower that grew behind a wall, "that the best surgeon in America
when he was sober was a lousy bum named Hugh McGuire who was
always drunk."</p>
<p>"Now wait, wait. Hold on a minute!" said McGuire, holding up
his thick hand. "I protest, Dick. You meant well, son, but you
got that mixed up. You mean the best surgeon in America when he's
not sober."</p>
<p>"Did you read one of your papers?" said Coker.</p>
<p>"Yes," said Dick Ravenel. "I read one on carcinoma of the
liver."</p>
<p>"How about one on pyorrhea of the toe-nails?" said McGuire.
"Did you read that one?"</p>
<p>Harry Tugman laughed heavily, not wholly knowing why. McGuire
belched into the silence loudly and was witlessly adrift for a
moment.</p>
<p>"Literature, literature, Dick," he returned portentously.
"It's been the ruin of many a good surgeon. You read too much,
Dick. Yon Cassius hath a lean and hungry look. You know too much.
The letter killeth the spirit, you know. Me&mdash;Dick, did you
ever know me to take anything out that I didn't put back? Anyway,
don't I always leave 'em something to go on with? I'm no scholar,
Dick. I've never had your advantages. I'm a self-made butcher.
I'm a carpenter, Dick. I'm an interior decorator. I'm a mechanic,
a plumber, an electrician, a butcher, a tailor, a jeweller. I'm a
jewel, a gem, a diamond in the rough, Dick. I'm a practical man.
I take out their works, spit upon them, trim off the dirty edges,
and send them on their way again. I economize, Dick; I throw away
everything I can't use, and use everything I throw away. Who made
the Pope a tailbone from his knuckle? Who made the dog howl?
Aha&mdash;that's why the governor looks so young. We are filled
up with useless machinery, Dick. Efficiency, economy, power! Have
you a Little Fairy in your Home? You haven't! Then let the Gold
Dust Twins do the work! Ask Ben&mdash;he knows!"</p>
<p>"O my God!" laughed Ben thinly, "listen to that, won't
you?"</p>
<p>Two doors below, directly before the Post Office, Pete Mascari
rolled upward with corrugated thunder the shutters of his fruit
shop. The pearl light fell coolly upon the fruity architecture,
on the pyramided masonry of spit-bright wine-saps, the thin sharp
yellow of the Florida oranges, the purple Tokays, sawdust-bedded.
There was a stale fruity odor from the shop of ripening bananas,
crated apples, and the acrid tang of powder; the windows are
filled with Roman candles, crossed rockets, pinwheels, squat
green Happy Hooligans, and multilating Jack Johnsons, red
cannoncrackers, and tiny acrid packets of crackling spattering
firecrackers. Light fell a moment on the ashen corpsiness of his
face and on the liquid Sicilian poison of his eyes.</p>
<p>"Don' pincha da grape. Pinch da banan'!"</p>
<p>A street-car, toy-green with new Spring paint, went
squareward.</p>
<p>"Dick," said McGuire more soberly, "take the job, if you
like."</p>
<p>Ravenel shook his head.</p>
<p>"I'll stand by," said he. "I won't operate. I'm afraid of one
like this. It's your job, drunk or sober."</p>
<p>"Removing a tumor from a woman, ain't you?" said Coker.</p>
<p>"No," said Dick Ravenel, "removing a woman from a tumor."</p>
<p>"Bet you it weighs fifty pounds, if it weighs an ounce," said
McGuire with sudden professional interest.</p>
<p>Dick Ravenel winced ever so slightly. A cool spurt of young
wind, clean as a kid, flowed by him. McGuire's meaty shoulders
recoiled burlily as if from the cold shock of water. He seemed to
waken.</p>
<p>"I'd like a bath," he said to Dick Ravenel, "and a shave." He
rubbed his hand across his blotched hairy face.</p>
<p>"You can use my room, Hugh, at the hotel," said Jeff Spaugh,
looking at Ravenel somewhat eagerly.</p>
<p>"I'll use the hospital," he said.</p>
<p>"You'll just have time," said Ravenel.</p>
<p>"In God's name, let's get a start on," he cried
impatiently.</p>
<p>"Did you see Kelly do this one at Hopkins?" asked McGuire.</p>
<p>"Yes," said Dick Ravenel, "after a very long prayer. That's to
give power to his elbow. The patient died."</p>
<p>"Damn the prayers!" said McGuire. "They won't do much good to
this one. She called me a low-down lickered-up whisky-drinking
bastard last night: if she still feels like that she'll get
well."</p>
<p>"These mountain women take a lot of killing," said Jeff Spaugh
sagely.</p>
<p>"Do you want to come along?" McGuire asked Coker.</p>
<p>"No, thanks. I'm getting some sleep," he answered. "The old
girl took a hell of a time. I thought she'd never get through
dying."</p>
<p>They started to go.</p>
<p>"Ben," said McGuire, with a return to his former manner, "tell
the Old Man I'll beat hell out of him if he doesn't give Helen a
rest. Is he staying sober?"</p>
<p>"In heaven's name, McGuire, how should I know?" Ben burst out
irritably. "Do you think that's all I've got to do&mdash;watching
your licker-heads?"</p>
<p>"That's a great girl, boy," said McGuire sentimentally. "One
in a million."</p>
<p>"Hugh, for God's sake, come on," cried Dick Ravenel.</p>
<p>The four medical men went out into the pearl light. The town
emerged from the lilac darkness with a washed renascent
cleanliness. All the world seemed as young as Spring. McGuire
walked across to Ravenel's car, and sank comfortably with a sense
of invigoration into the cool leathers. Jeff Spaugh plunged off
violently with a ripping explosion of his engine and a cavalier
wave of his hand.</p>
<p>Admiringly Harry Tugman's face turned to the slumped burly
figure of Hugh McGuire.</p>
<p>"By God!" he boasted, "I bet he does the damnedest piece of
operating you ever heard of."</p>
<p>"Why, hell," said the counterman loyally, "he ain't worth a
damn until he's got a quart of corn licker under his belt. Give
him a few drinks and he'll cut off your damned head and put it on
again without your knowing it."</p>
<p>As Jeff Spaugh roared off Harry Tugman said jealously: "Look
at that bastard. Mr. Vanderbilt. He thinks he's hell, don't he? A
big pile of bull. Ben, do you reckon he was really out at the
Hilliards to-night?"</p>
<p>"Oh for God's sake," said Ben irritably, "how the hell should
I know! What difference does it make?" he added furiously.</p>
<p>"I guess Little Maudie will fill up the column to-morrow with
some of her crap," said Harry Tugman. "'The Younger Set,' she
calls it! Christ! It goes all the way from every little bitch old
enough to wear drawers, to Old Man Redmond. If Saul Gudger
belongs to the Younger Set, Ben, you and I are still in the third
grade. Why, hell, yes," he said with an air of conviction to the
grinning counterman, "he was bald as a pig's knuckle when the
Spanish American War broke out."</p>
<p>The counterman laughed.</p>
<p>Foaming with brilliant slapdash improvisation Harry Tugman
declaimed:</p>
<p>"Members of the Younger Set were charmingly entertained last
night at a dinner dance given at Snotwood, the beautiful
residence of Mr. and Mrs. Clarence Firkins, in honor of their
youngest daughter, Gladys, who made her debut this season. Mr.
and Mrs. Firkins, accompanied by their daughter, greeted each of
the arriving guests at the threshhold in a manner reviving the
finest old traditions of Southern aristocracy, while Mrs.
Firkins' accomplished sister, Miss Catherine Hipkiss,
affectionately known to members of the local younger set as
Roaring Kate, supervised the checking of overcoats, evening
wraps, jock-straps, and jewelry.</p>
<p>"Dinner was served promptly at eight o'clock, followed by
coffee and Pluto Water at eight forty-five. A delicious
nine-course collation had been prepared by Artaxerxes
Papadopolos, the well- known confectioner and caterer, and
proprietor of the Bijou Caf&eacute; for Ladies and Gents.</p>
<p>"After first-aid and a thorough medical examination by Dr.
Jefferson Reginald Alfonso Spaugh, the popular GIN-ecologist, the
guests adjourned to the Ball Room where dance music was provided
by Zeke Buckner's Upper Hominy Stringed Quartette, Mr. Buckner
himself officiating at the trap drum and tambourine.</p>
<p>"Among those dancing were the Misses Aline Titsworth, Lena
Ginster, Ophelia Legg, Gladys Firkins, Beatrice Slutsky, Mary
Whitesides, Helen Shockett, and Lofta Barnes.</p>
<p>"Also the Messrs. I. C. Bottom, U. B. Freely, R. U. Reddy, O.
I. Lovett, Cummings Strong, Sansom Horney, Preston Updyke, Dows
Wicket, Pettigrew Biggs, Otis Goode, and J. Broad Stem."</p>
<p>Ben laughed noiselessly, and bent his pointed face into the
mug again. Then, he stretched his thin arms out, extending his
body sensually upward, and forcing out in a wide yawn the
night-time accumulation of weariness, boredom, and disgust.</p>
<p>"Oh-h-h-h my God!"</p>
<p>Virginal sunlight crept into the street in young moteless
shafts. At this moment Gant awoke.</p>
<p>He lay quietly on his back for a moment in the pleasant
yellow- shaded dusk of the sitting-room, listening to the
rippling flutiness of the live piping birdy morning. He yawned
cavernously and thrust his right hand scratching into the dense
hairthicket of his breast.</p>
<p>The fast cackle-cluck of sensual hens. Come and rob us. All
through the night for you, master. Rich protesting yielding
voices of Jewesses. Do it, don't it. Break an egg in them.</p>
<p>Sleepless, straight, alert, the counterpane moulded over his
gaunt legs, he listened to the protesting invitations of the
hens.</p>
<p>From the warm dust, shaking their fat feathered bodies,
protesting but satisfied they staggered up. For me. The earth too
and the vine. The moist new earth cleaving like cut pork from the
plough. Or like water from a ship. The spongy sod spaded cleanly
and rolled back like flesh. Or the earth loosened and hoed gently
around the roots of the cherry trees. The earth receives my seed.
For me the great lettuces. Spongy and full of sap now like a
woman. The thick grapevine&mdash;in August the heavy clustered
grapes&mdash;How there? Like milk from a breast. Or blood through
a vein. Fattens and plumps them.</p>
<p>All through the night the blossoms dropping. Soon now the
White Wax. Green apples end of May. Isaacs' June Apple hangs half
on my side. Bacon and fried green apples.</p>
<p>With sharp whetted hunger he thought of breakfast. He threw
the sheet back cleanly, swung in an orbit to a sitting position
and put his white somewhat phthisic feet on the floor. Standing
up tenderly, he walked over to his leather rocker and put on a
pair of clean white-footed socks. Then he pulled his nightgown
over his head, looking for a moment in the dresser mirror at his
great boned structure, the long stringy muscles of his arms, and
his flat- meated hairy chest. His stomach sagged paunchily. He
thrust his white flaccid calves quickly through the shrunken legs
of a union suit, stretched it out elasticly with a comfortable
widening of his shoulders and buttoned it. Then he stepped into
his roomy sculpturally heavy trousers and drew on his
soft-leathered laceless shoes. Crossing his suspender braces over
his shoulders, he strode into the kitchen and had a brisk fire of
oil and pine snapping in the range within three minutes. He was
stimulated and alive in all the fresh wakefulness of the Spring
morning.</p>
<p>Through Birdseye Gap, in the dewy richness of Lunn's Cove,
Judge Webster Tayloe, the eminent, prosperous, and aristocratic
corporation counsel (retired, but occasional consultations), rose
in the rich walnut twilight of his bedchamber, noted approvingly,
through the black lenses of the glasses that gave his long,
subtle, and contemptuous face its final advantage over the
rabble, that one of his country bumpkins was coming from the
third pasture with a slopping pail of new milk, another was
sharpening a scythe in the young glint of the sun, and another,
emulating his more intelligent fellow, the horse, was backing a
buggy slowly under the carriage shed.</p>
<p>Approvingly he watched his young mulatto son come over the
lawn with lazy cat-speed, noting with satisfaction the grace and
quickness of his movements, the slender barrel strength of his
torso, his smallboned resiliency. Also the well-shaped
intelligent head, the eager black eyes, the sensitive oval face,
and the beautiful coprous olive of the skin. He was very like a
better- class Spaniard. Quod potui perfeci. By this fusion,
perhaps, men like men.</p>
<p>By the river the reed-pipes, the muse's temple, the sacred
wood again. Why not? As in this cove. I, too, have lived in
Arcady.</p>
<p>He took off his glasses for a moment and looked at the ptotic
malevolence of his left eye, and the large harlequinesque wart in
the cheek below it. The black glasses gave the suggestion that he
was half-masked; they added a touch of unsearchable mystery to
the subtle, sensual and disquieting intelligence of his face. His
negro man appeared at this moment and told him his bath was
ready. He drew the long thin nightgown over his freckled
Fitzsimmons body and stepped vigorously into tepid water. Then
for ten minutes he was sponged, scraped, and kneaded, upon a long
table by the powerful plastic hands of the negro. He dressed in
fresh laundered underwear and newly pressed clothes of black. He
tied a black string carelessly below the wide belt of starched
collar and buttoned across his straight long figure a frock coat
that reached his knees. He took a cigarette from a box on his
table and lighted it.</p>
<p>Bouncing tinnily down the coiling road that came through the
Gap from the town, a flivver glinted momently through the trees.
Two men were in it. His face hardened against it, he watched it
go by his gates on the road with a scuffle of dust. Dimly he saw
their lewd red mountain faces, and completed the image with sweat
and corduroy. And in the town their city cousins. Brick, stucco,
the white little eczema of Suburbia. Federated Half-Breeds of the
World.</p>
<p>Into my Valley next with lawnmowers and front lawns. He ground
out the life of the cigarette against an ashtray, and began a
rapid window calculation of his horses, asses, kine, swine, and
hens; the stored plenitude of his great barn, the heavy fruitage
of his fields and orchards. A man came toward the house with a
bucket of eggs in one hand and a bucket of butter in the other;
each cake was stamped with a sheaf of wheat and wrapped loosely
in clean white linen cloths. He smiled grimly: if attacked he
could withstand a prolonged siege.</p>
<p>At Dixieland, Eliza slept soundly in a small dark room with a
window opening on the uncertain light of the back porch. Her
chamber was festooned with a pendant wilderness of cord and
string; stacks of old newspapers and magazines were piled in the
corners; and every shelf was loaded with gummed, labelled,
half-filled medicine bottles. There was a smell in the air of
mentholatum, Vick's Pneumonia Cure, and sweet glycerine. The
negress arrived, coming under the built-up house and climbing
lazily the steep tunnel of back steps. She knocked at the
door.</p>
<p>"Who's there!" cried Eliza sharply, waking at once, and coming
forward to the door. She wore a gray flannel nightgown over a
heavy woollen undershirt that Ben had discarded: the pendant
string floated gently to and fro as she opened the door, like
some strange seamoss floating below the sea. Upstairs, in the
small front room with the sleeping-porch, slept Miss Billie
Edwards, twenty-four, of Missouri, the daring and masterful
liontamer of Johnny L. Jones Combined Shows, then playing in the
field on the hill behind the Plum Street School. Next to her, in
the large airy room at the corner, Mrs. Marie Pert, forty-one,
the wife of an itinerant and usually absent drug salesman, lay
deep in the pit of alcoholic slumber. Upon each end of the mantel
was a small snapshot in a silver frame&mdash;one of her absent
daughter, Louise, eighteen, and one of Benjamin Gant, lying on
the grass-bank in front of the house, propped on his elbow and
wearing a wide straw hat that shaded all his face except his
mouth. Also, in other chambers, front and back, Mr. Conway
Richards, candy-wheel concessionaire with the Johnny L. Jones
Combined Shows, Miss Lily Mangum, twenty-six, trained nurse, Mr.
William H. Baskett, fifty-three, of Hattiesburg, Mississippi,
cotton grower, banker, and sufferer from malaria, and his wife;
in the large room at the head of the stairs Miss Annie Mitchell,
nineteen, of Valdosta, Georgia, Miss Thelma Cheshire, twenty-one,
of Florence, South Carolina, and Mrs. Rose Levin, twenty-eight,
of Chicago, Illinois, all members of the chorus of "Molasses"
Evans and His Broadway Beauties, booked out of Atlanta, Georgia,
by the Piedmont Amusement Agency.</p>
<p>"O G-hirls! The Duke of Gorgonzola and the Count of Limburger
are on their way here now. I want all you girls to be nice to
them and to show them a good time when they arrive."</p>
<p>"You BET we will."</p>
<p>"And keep your eye on the little one&mdash;he's the one with
all the money."</p>
<p>"I'll SAY we will. Hurrah, Hurrah, Hurrah!"</p>
<blockquote>"We are the girls that have the fun,<br>
We're snappy and happy every one;<br>
We're jolly and gay<br>
And ready to play,<br>
And that is why we say-ee&mdash;"</blockquote>
<p>Behind a bill-plastered fence-boarding on upper Valley Street,
opposite the Y. M. I. (colored), and in the very heart of the
crowded amusement and commercial centre of Altamont's colored
population, Moses Andrews, twenty-six, colored, slept the last
great sleep of white and black. His pockets, which only the night
before had been full of the money Saul Stein, the pawnbroker, had
given him in exchange for certain articles which he had taken
from the home of Mr. George Rollins, the attorney (as an 18-carat
Waltham gold watch with a heavy chain of twined gold, the diamond
engagement ring of Mrs. Rollins, three pairs of the finest silk
stockings, and two pairs of gentlemen's under-drawers), were now
empty, a half-filled bottle of Cloverleaf Bonded Kentucky Rye,
with which he had retired behind the boards to slumber, lay
unmolested in the flaccid grip of his left hand, and his broad
black throat gaped cleanly open from ear to ear, as a result of
the skilled razor-work of his hated and hating rival, Jefferson
Flack, twenty- eight, who now lay peacefully, unsuspected and
unsought, with their mutual mistress, Miss Molly Fiske, in her
apartment on east Pine Street. Moses had been murdered in
moonlight.</p>
<p>A starved cat walked softly along by the boards on Upper
Valley: as the courthouse bell boomed out its solid six strokes,
eight negro laborers, the bottoms of their overalls stiff with
agglutinated cement, tramped by like a single animal, in a wedge,
each carrying his lunch in a small lard bucket.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the following events occurred simultaneously
throughout the neighborhood.</p>
<p>Dr. H. M. McRae, fifty-eight, minister of the First
Presbyterian Church, having washed his lean Scotch body, arrayed
himself in stiff black and a boiled white shirt, and shaved his
spare clean un-aging face, descended from his chamber in his
residence on Cumberland Avenue, to his breakfast of oatmeal, dry
toast, and boiled milk. His heart was pure, his mind upright, his
faith and his life like a clean board scrubbed with sandstone. He
prayed in thirty-minute prayers without impertinence for all men
and the success of all good ventures. He was a white unwasting
flame that shone through love and death; his speech rang out like
steel with a steady passion.</p>
<p>In Dr. Frank Engel's Sanitarium and Turkish Bath Establishment
on Liberty Street, Mr. J. H. Brown, wealthy sportsman and
publisher of the Altamont Citizen, sank into dreamless sleep,
after five minutes in the steam-closet, ten in the tub, and
thirty in the dry-room, where he had submitted to the expert
osteopathy of "Colonel" Andrews (as Dr. Engel's skilled negro
masseur was affectionately known), from the soles of his gouty
feet to the veinous silken gloss of his slightly purple face.</p>
<p>Across the street, at the corner of Liberty and Federal, and
at the foot of Battery Hill, a white-jacketed negro sleepily
restacked in boxes the scattered poker-chips that covered the
centre table in the upstairs centre room of the Altamont City
Club. The guests, just departed, were Mr. Gilbert Woodcock, Mr.
Reeves Stikeleather, Mr. Henry Pentland, Jr., Mr. Sidney Newbeck,
of Cleveland, Ohio (retired), and the aforementioned Mr. J. H.
Brown.</p>
<p>"And, Jesus, Ben!" said Harry Tugman, emerging at this moment
from Uneeda No. 3. "I thought I'd have a hemorrhage when they
pulled the Old Man out of the closet. After all the stuff he
printed about cleaning up the town, too."</p>
<p>"It wouldn't surprise me if Judge Sevier had them raid him,"
said Ben.</p>
<p>"Why certainly, Ben," said Harry Tugman impatiently, "that's
the idea, but Queen Elizabeth was behind it. You don't think
there's anything she doesn't hear about, do you? So help me
Jesus, you never heard a yap out of him for a week. He was afraid
to show his face out of the office."</p>
<p>At the Convent School of Saint Catherine's on Saint Clement's
Road, Sister Theresa, the Mother Superior, walked softly through
the dormitory lifting the window-shade beside each cot, letting
the orchard cherry-apple bloom come gently into the long cool
glade of roseleaf sleeping girls. Their breath expired gently
upon their dewy half-opened mouths, light fell rosily upon the
pillowed curve of their arms, their slender young sides, and the
crisp pink buds of their breasts. At the other end of the room a
fat girl lay squarely on her back, her arms and legs outspread,
and snored solidly through blubbering lips. They had yet an hour
of sleep.</p>
<p>From one of the little white tables between the cots Theresa
picked up an opened book incautiously left there the night
before, read below her gray mustache with the still inward smile
of her great- boned face, its title&mdash;The Common Law, by
Robert W. Chambers&mdash;and gripping a pencil in her broad
earthstained hand, scrawled briefly in jagged male letters:
"Rubbish, Elizabeth&mdash;but see for yourself." Then, on her
soft powerful tread, she went downstairs, and entered her study,
where Sister Louise (French), Sister Mary (History), and Sister
Bernice (Ancient Languages) were waiting for the morning
consultation. When they had gone, she sat down to her desk and
worked for an hour on the manuscript of that book, modestly
intended for school children, which has since celebrated her name
wherever the noble architecture of prose is valued&mdash;the
great Biology.</p>
<p>Then the gong rang in the dormitory, she heard the high
laughter of young maidens, and rising saw, coming from the
plum-tree by the wall, a young nun, Sister Agnes, with blossoms
in her arms.</p>
<p>Below, tree-hidden, in the Biltburn bottom, there was a
thunder on the rails, a wailing whistle cry.</p>
<p>Beneath the City Hall, in the huge sloping cellar, the market
booths were open. The aproned butchers swung their cleavers down
on fresh cold joints, slapping the thick chops on heavy sheets of
mottled paper, and tossing them, roughly tied, to the waiting
negro delivery-boys.</p>
<p>The self-respecting negro, J. H. Jackson, stood in his square
vegetable-stall, attended by his two grave-faced sons, and his
spectacled businesslike daughter. He was surrounded by wide
slanting shelves of fruit and vegetables, smelling of the earth
and morning&mdash;great crinkled lettuces, fat radishes still
clotted damply with black loam, quill-stemmed young onions newly
wrenched from gardens, late celery, spring potatoes, and the thin
rinded citrous fruits of Florida.</p>
<p>Above him, Sorrell, the fish and oyster man, drew up from the
depths of an enamelled ice-packed can dripping ladlefuls of
oysters, pouring them into thick cardboard cartons. Wide-bellied
heavy seafish&mdash;carp, trout, bass, shad&mdash;lay gutted in
beds of ice.</p>
<p>Mr. Michael Walter Creech, the butcher, having finished his
hearty breakfast of calves' liver, eggs and bacon, hot biscuits
and coffee, made a sign to one of the waiting row of negro boys.
The line sprang forward like hounds; he stopped them with a curse
and a lifted cleaver. The fortunate youth who had been chosen
then came forward and took the tray, still richly morselled with
food and a pot half full of coffee. As he had to depart at this
moment on a delivery, he put it down in the sawdust at the end of
the bench and spat copiously upon it in order to protect it from
his scavenging comrades. Then he wheeled off, full of rich
laughter and triumphant malice. Mr. Creech looked at his niggers
darkly.</p>
<p>The town had so far forgotten Mr. Creech's own African blood
(an eighth on his father's side, old Walter Creech, out of Yellow
Jenny) that it was about ready to offer him political preferment;
but Mr. Creech himself had not forgotten. He glanced bitterly at
his brother, Jay, who, happily ignorant of hatred, that fanged
poison which may taint even a brother's heart, was
enthusiastically cleaving spare-ribs on the huge bole of his own
table, singing meanwhile in a rich tenor voice the opening bars
of "The Little Gray Home In The West":</p>
<blockquote>"...there are blue eyes that shine<br>
Just because they meet mine ..."</blockquote>
<p>Mr. Creech looked venomously at Jay's yellow jowls, the fat
throbbing of his jaundiced throat, the crisp singed whorl of his
hair.</p>
<p>By God, he thought in his anguish of spirit, he might be taken
for a Mexican.</p>
<p>Jay's golden voice neared its triumph, breaking with delicate
restraint, on the last note, into a high sweet falsetto which he
maintained for more than twenty seconds. All of the butchers
stopped working, several of them, big strong men with grown-up
families dashed a tear out of their eyes.</p>
<p>The great audience was held spellbound. Not a soul stirred.
Not even a dog or a horse stirred. As the last sweet note melted
away in a gossamer tremolo, a silence profound as that of the
tombs, nay, of death itself, betokened the highest triumph the
artist is destined to know upon this earth. Somewhere in the
crowd a woman sobbed and collapsed in a faint. She was
immediately carried out by two Boy Scouts who happened to be
present, and who administered first aid to her in the rest-room,
one of them hastily kindling a crackling fire of pine boughs by
striking two flints together, while the other made a tourniquet,
and tied several knots in his handkerchief. Then pandemonium
broke loose. Women tore the jewels from their fingers, ropes of
pearls from their necks, chrysanthemums, hyacinths, tulips and
daisies from their expensive corsages, while the
fashionably-dressed men in the near-by stalls kept up a constant
bombardment of tomatoes, lettuces, new potatoes, beef-tallow,
pigs' knuckles, fishheads, clams, loin-chops, and
pork-sausages.</p>
<p>Among the stalls of the market, the boarding-house keepers of
Altamont walked with spying bargain-hunting eyes and inquisitive
nose. They were of various sizes and ages, but they were all
stamped with the print of haggling determination and a pugnacious
closure of the mouth. They pried in among the fish and
vegetables, pinching cabbages, weighing onions, exfoliating
lettuce-heads. You've got to keep your eye on people or they'll
skin you. And if you leave things to a lazy shiftless nigger
she'll waste more than she cooks. They looked at one another
hardfaced&mdash;Mrs. Barrett of the Grosvenor at Mrs. Neville of
Glen View; Mrs. Ambler of the Colonial at Miss Mamie Featherstone
of Ravencrest; Mrs. Ledbetter of the Belvedere&mdash;</p>
<p>"I hear you're full up, Mrs. Coleman," said she
inquiringly.</p>
<p>"O, I'm full up all the time," said Mrs. Coleman. "My people
are all permanents, I don't want to fool with transients," she
said loftily.</p>
<p>"Well," said Mrs. Ledbetter acidly, "I could fill my house up
at any time with lungers who call themselves something else, but
I won't have them. I was saying the other day&mdash;"</p>
<p>Mrs. Michalove of Oakwood at Mrs. Jarvis of The Waverly; Mrs.
Cowan of Ridgmont at&mdash;</p>
<p>The city is splendidly equipped to meet the demands of the
great and steadily growing crowd of tourists that fill the
Mountain Metropolis during the busy months of June, July, and
August. In addition to eight hotels de luxe of the highest
quality, there were registered at the Board of Trade in 1911 over
250 private hotels, boarding-houses and sanitariums all catering
to the needs of those who come on missions of business, pleasure,
or health.</p>
<p>Stop their baggage at the station.</p>
<p>At this moment Number 3, having finished his route, stepped
softly on to the slime-scummed porch of the house on Valley
Street, rapped gently at the door, and opened it quietly, groping
his way through black miasmic air to the bed in which May
Corpening lay. She muttered as if drugged as he touched her,
turned toward him, and sleepily awakened, drew him down to her
with heavied and sensual caress, yoked under her big coppery
arms. Tom Cline clumped greasily up the steps of his residence on
Barlett Street, swinging his tin pail; Ben returned to the paper
office with Harry Tugman; and Eugene, in the back room on Woodson
Street, waking suddenly to Gant's powerful command from the foot
of the stairs, turned his face full into a momentary vision of
rose-flushed blue sky and tender blossoms that drifted slowly
earthward.</p>
<h3>15</h3>
<p>The mountains were his masters. They rimmed in life. They were
the cup of reality, beyond growth, beyond struggle and death.
They were his absolute unity in the midst of eternal change. Old
haunt- eyed faces glimmered in his memory. He thought of Swain's
cow, St. Louis, death, himself in the cradle. He was the haunter
of himself, trying for a moment to recover what he had been part
of. He did not understand change, he did not understand growth.
He stared at his framed baby picture in the parlor, and turned
away sick with fear and the effort to touch, retain, grasp
himself for only a moment.</p>
<p>And these bodiless phantoms of his life appeared with terrible
precision, with all the mad nearness of a vision. That which was
five years gone came within the touch of his hand, and he ceased
at that moment to believe in his own existence. He expected some
one to wake him; he would hear Gant's great voice below the laden
vines, would gaze sleepily from the porch into the rich low moon,
and go obediently to bed. But still there would be all that he
remembered before that and what if&mdash;Cause flowed ceaselessly
into cause.</p>
<p>He heard the ghostly ticking of his life; his powerful
clairvoyance, the wild Scotch gift of Eliza, burned inward back
across the phantom years, plucking out of the ghostly shadows a
million gleams of light&mdash;a little station by the rails at
dawn, the road cleft through the pineland seen at twilight, a
smoky cabin-light below the trestles, a boy who ran among the
bounding calves, a wisp-haired slattern, with snuff-sticked
mouth, framed in a door, floury negroes unloading sacks from
freight-cars on a shed, the man who drove the Fair Grounds bus at
Saint Louis, a cool-lipped lake at dawn.</p>
<p>His life coiled back into the brown murk of the past like a
twined filament of electric wire; he gave life, a pattern, and
movement to these million sensations that Chance, the loss or
gain of a moment, the turn of the head, the enormous and aimless
impulsion of accident, had thrust into the blazing heat of him.
His mind picked out in white living brightness these pinpoints of
experience and the ghostliness of all things else became more
awful because of them. So many of the sensations that returned to
open haunting vistas of fantasy and imagining had been caught
from a whirling landscape through the windows of the train.</p>
<p>And it was this that awed him&mdash;the weird combination of
fixity and change, the terrible moment of immobility stamped with
eternity in which, passing life at great speed, both the observer
and the observed seem frozen in time. There was one moment of
timeless suspension when the land did not move, the train did not
move, the slattern in the doorway did not move, he did not move.
It was as if God had lifted his baton sharply above the endless
orchestration of the seas, and the eternal movement had stopped,
suspended in the timeless architecture of the absolute. Or like
those motion- pictures that describe the movements of a swimmer
making a dive, or a horse taking a hedge&mdash;movement is
petrified suddenly in mid-air, the inexorable completion of an
act is arrested. Then, completing its parabola, the suspended
body plops down into the pool. Only, these images that burnt in
him existed without beginning or ending, without the essential
structure of time. Fixed in no-time, the slattern vanished,
fixed, without a moment of transition.</p>
<p>His sense of unreality came from time and movement, from
imagining the woman, when the train had passed, as walking back
into the house, lifting a kettle from the hearth embers. Thus
life turned shadow, the living lights went ghost again. The boy
among the calves. Where later? Where now?</p>
<p>I am, he thought, a part of all that I have touched and that
has touched me, which, having for me no existence save that which
I gave to it, became other than itself by being mixed with what I
then was, and is now still otherwise, having fused with what I
now am, which is itself a cumulation of what I have been
becoming. Why here? Why there? Why now? Why then?</p>
<p>The fusion of the two strong egotisms, Eliza's inbrooding and
Gant's expanding outward, made of him a fanatical zealot in the
religion of Chance. Beyond all misuse, waste, pain, tragedy,
death, confusion, unswerving necessity was on the rails; not a
sparrow fell through the air but that its repercussion acted on
his life, and the lonely light that fell upon the viscous and
interminable seas at dawn awoke sea-changes washing life to him.
The fish swam upward from the depth.</p>
<p>The seed of our destruction will blossom in the desert, the
alexin of our cure grows by a mountain rock, and our lives are
haunted by a Georgia slattern because a London cut-purse went
unhung. Through Chance, we are each a ghost to all the others,
and our only reality; through Chance, the huge hinge of the
world, and a grain of dust; the stone that starts an avalanche,
the pebble whose concentric circles widen across the seas.</p>
<p>He believed himself thus at the centre of life; he believed
the mountains rimmed the heart of the world; he believed that
from all the chaos of accident the inevitable event came at the
inexorable moment to add to the sum of his life.</p>
<p>Against the hidden other flanks of the immutable hills the
world washed like a vast and shadowy sea, alive with the great
fish of his imagining. Variety, in this unvisited world, was
unending, but order and purpose certain: there would be no
wastage in adventure&mdash;courage would be regarded with beauty,
talent with success, all merit with its true deserving. There
would be peril, there would be toil, there would be struggle. But
there would not be confusion and waste. There would not be
groping. For collected Fate would fall, on its chosen moment,
like a plum. There was no disorder in enchantment.</p>
<p>Spring lay abroad through all the garden of this world. Beyond
the hills the land bayed out to other hills, to golden cities, to
rich meadows, to deep forests, to the sea. Forever and
forever.</p>
<p>Beyond the hills were the mines of King Solomon, the toy
republics of Central America, and little tinkling fountains in a
court; beyond, the moonlit roofs of Bagdad, the little grated
blinds of Samarkand, the moonlit camels of Bythinia, the Spanish
ranch-house of the Triple Z, and J. B. Montgomery and his lovely
daughter stepping from their private car upon a western track;
and the castle-haunted crags of Graustark; the fortune-yielding
casino of Monte Carlo; and the blue eternal Mediterranean, mother
of empires. And instant wealth ticked out upon a tape, and the
first stage of the Eiffel Tower where the restaurant was, and
Frenchmen setting fire to their whiskers, and a farm in Devon,
white cream, brown ale, the winter's chimney merriment, and Lorna
Doone; and the hanging gardens of Babylon, and supper in the
sunset with the queens, and the slow slide of the barge upon the
Nile, or the wise rich bodies of Egyptian women couched on
moonlit balustrades, and the thunder of the chariots of great
kings, and tomb-treasure sought at midnight, and the wine-rich
chateau land of France, and calico warm legs in hay.</p>
<p>Upon a field in Thrace Queen Helen lay, her lovely body
dappled in the sun.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, business had been fairly good. Eliza's earning
power the first few years at Dixieland had been injured by her
illnesses. Now, however, she had recovered, and had paid off the
last installment on the house. It was entirely hers. The property
at this time was worth perhaps $12,000. In addition she had
borrowed $3,500 on a twenty-year $5,000 life insurance policy
that had only two years more to run, and had made extensive
alterations: she had added a large sleeping-porch upstairs,
tacked on two rooms, a bath, and a hallway on one side, and
extended a hallway, adding three bedrooms, two baths, and a
water-closet, on the other. Downstairs she had widened the
veranda, put in a large sun-parlor under the sleeping-porch,
knocked out the archway in the dining-room, which she prepared to
use as a big bedroom in the slack season, scooped out a small
pantry in which the family was to eat, and added a tiny room
beside the kitchen for her own occupancy.</p>
<p>The construction was after her own plans, and of the cheapest
material: it never lost the smell of raw wood, cheap varnish, and
flimsy rough plastering, but she had added eight or ten rooms at
a cost of only $3,000. The year before she had banked almost
$2,000&mdash;her bank account was almost $5,000. In addition, she
owned jointly with Gant the shop on the Square, which had thirty
feet of frontage, and was valued at $20,000, from which he got
$65 a month in rent; $20 from Jannadeau, $25 from the McLean
Plumbing Company in the basement, and $20 from the J. N.
Gillespie Printing Co., which occupied all of the second story.
There were, besides, three good building-lots on Merrion Avenue
valued at $2,000 apiece, or at $5,500 for all three; the house on
Woodson Street valued at $5,000; 110 acres of wooded mountainside
with a farm-house, several hundred peach, apple and cherry trees,
and a few acres of arable ground for which Gant received $120 a
year in rent, and which they valued at $50 an acre, $5,500; two
houses, one on Carter Street, and one on Duncan, rented to
railway people, for which they received $25 a month apiece, and
which they valued together at $4,500; forty-eight acres of land
two miles above Biltburn, and four from Altamont, upon the
important Reynoldsville Road, which they valued at $210 an acre,
or $10,000; three houses in Niggertown&mdash;one on lower Valley
Street, one on Beaumont Crescent, just below the negro Johnson's
big house, and one on Short Oak, valued at $600, $900, and $1,600
respectively, and drawing a room-rental of $8, $12, and $17 a
month (total: $3,100 and $37 rental); two houses across the
river, four miles away in West Altamont, valued at $2,750 and at
$3,500, drawing a rental of $22 and $30 a month; three lots, lost
in the growth of a rough hillside, a mile from the main highway
through West Altamont, $500; and a house, unoccupied, object of
Gantian anathema, on Lower Hatton Avenue, $4,500.</p>
<p>In addition, Gant held 10 shares, which were already worth
$200 each ($2,000), in the newly organized Fidelity Bank; his
stock of stones, monuments, and fly-specked angels represented an
investment of $2,700, although he could not have sold them
outright for so much; and he had about $3,000 deposited in the
Fidelity, the Merchants, and the Battery Hill banks.</p>
<p>Thus, at the beginning of 1912, before the rapid and intensive
development of Southern industry, and the consequent tripling of
Altamont's population, and before the multiplication of her land
values, the wealth of Gant and Eliza amounted to about $100,000,
the great bulk of which was solidly founded in juicy well chosen
pieces of property of Eliza's selection, yielding them a monthly
rental of more than $200, which, added to their own earning
capacities at the shop and Dixieland, gave them a combined yearly
income of $8,000 or $10,000. Although Gant often cried out
bitterly against his business and declared, when he was not
attacking property, that he had never made even a bare living
from his tombstones, he was rarely short of ready money: he
usually had one or two small commissions from country people, and
he always carried a well-filled purse, containing $150 or $200 in
five- and ten-dollar bills, which he allowed Eugene to count out
frequently, enjoying his son's delight, and the feel of
abundance.</p>
<p>Eliza had suffered one or two losses in her investments, led
astray by a strain of wild romanticism which destroyed for the
moment her shrewd caution. She invested $1,200 in the Missouri
Utopia of a colonizer, and received nothing for her money but a
weakly copy of the man's newspaper, several beautiful
prospectuses of the look of things when finished, and a piece of
clay sculpture, eight inches in height, showing Big Brother with
his little sisters Jenny and Kate, the last with thumb in her
mouth.</p>
<p>"By God," said Gant, who made savage fun of the proceeding,
"she ought to have it on her nose."</p>
<p>And Ben sneered, jerking his head toward it, saying:</p>
<p>"There's her $1,200."</p>
<p>But Eliza was preparing to go on by herself. She saw that co-
operation with Gant in the purchase of land was becoming more
difficult each year. And with something like pain, something
assuredly like hunger, she saw various rich plums fall into other
hands or go unbought. She realized that in a very short time land
values would soar beyond her present means. And she proposed to
be on hand when the pie was cut.</p>
<p>Across the street from Dixieland was the Brunswick, a
well-built red brick house of twenty rooms. The marble facings
had been done by Gant himself twenty years before, the hardwood
floors and oak timbering by Will Pentland. It was an ugly gabled
Victorian house, the marriage gift of a rich Northerner to his
daughter, who died of tuberculosis.</p>
<p>"Not a better built house in town," said Gant.</p>
<p>Nevertheless he refused to buy it with Eliza, and with an
aching heart she saw it go to St. Greenberg, the rich junk-man,
for $8,500. Within a year he had sold off five lots at the back,
on the Yancy Street side, for $1,000 each, and was holding the
house for $20,000.</p>
<p>"We could have had our money back by now three times over,"
Eliza fretted.</p>
<p>She did not have enough money at the time for any important
investment. She saved and she waited.</p>
<p>Will Pentland's fortune at this time was vaguely estimated at
from $500,000 to $700,000. It was mainly in property, a great
deal of which was situated&mdash;warehouses and
buildings&mdash;near the passenger depot of the railway.</p>
<p>Sometimes Altamont people, particularly the young men who
loafed about Collister's drug-store, and who spent long dreamy
hours estimating the wealth of the native plutocracy, called Will
Pentland a millionaire. At this time it was a distinction in
American life to be a millionaire. There were only six or eight
thousand. But Will Pentland wasn't one. He was really worth only
a half million.</p>
<p>Mr. Goulderbilt was a millionaire. He was driven into town in
a big Packard, but he got out and went along the streets like
other men.</p>
<p>One time Gant pointed him out to Eugene. He was about to enter
a bank.</p>
<p>"There he is," whispered Gant. "Do you see him?"</p>
<p>Eugene nodded, wagging his head mechanically. He was unable to
speak. Mr. Goulderbilt was a small dapper man, with black hair,
black clothes, and a black mustache. His hands and feet were
small.</p>
<p>"He's got over $50,000,000," said Gant. "You'd never think it
to look at him, would you?"</p>
<p>And Eugene dreamed of these money princes living in a princely
fashion. He wanted to see them riding down a street in a crested
coach around which rode a teetering guard of liveried outriders.
He wanted their fingers to be heavily gemmed, their clothes
trimmed with ermine, their women coroneted with flashing mosaics
of amethyst, beryl, ruby, topaz, sapphire, opal, emerald, and
wearing thick ropes of pearls. And he wanted to see them living
in palaces of alabaster columns, eating in vast halls upon an
immense creamy table from vessels of old silver&mdash;eating
strange fabulous foods&mdash;swelling unctuous paps of a fat
pregnant sow, oiled mushrooms, calvered salmon, jugged hare, the
beards of barbels dressed with an exquisite and poignant sauce,
carps' tongues, dormice and camels' heels, with spoons of amber
headed with diamond and carbuncle, and cups of agate, studded
with emeralds, hyacinths, and rubies&mdash;everything, in fact,
for which Epicure Mammon wished.</p>
<p>Eugene met only one millionaire whose performances in public
satisfied him, and he, unhappily, was crazy. His name was
Simon.</p>
<p>Simon, when Eugene first saw him, was a man of almost fifty
years. He had a strong, rather heavy figure of middling height, a
lean brown face, with shadowy hollows across the cheeks, always
closely shaven, but sometimes badly scarred by his gouging
fingernails, and a long thin mouth that curved slightly downward,
subtle, sensitive, lighting his whole face at times with blazing
demoniac glee. He had straight abundant hair, heavily grayed,
which he kept smartly brushed and flattened at the sides. His
clothing was loose and well cut: he wore a dark coat above baggy
gray flannels, silk shirt rayed with broad stripes, a collar to
match, and a generous loosely knotted tie. His waistcoats were of
a ruddy-brown chequered pattern. He had an appearance of great
distinction.</p>
<p>Simon and his two keepers first came to Dixieland when
difficulties with several of the Altamont hotels forced them to
look for private quarters. The men took two rooms and a
sleeping-porch, and paid generously.</p>
<p>"Why, pshaw!" said Eliza persuasively to Helen. "I don't
believe there's a thing wrong with him. He's as quiet and
well-behaved as you please."</p>
<p>At this moment there was a piercing yell upstairs, followed by
a long peal of diabolical laughter. Eugene bounded up and down
the hall in his exultancy and delight, producing little squealing
noises in his throat. Ben, scowling, with a quick flicker of his
mouth, drew back his hard white hand swiftly as if to cuff his
brother. Instead, he jerked his head sideways to Eliza, and said
with a soft, scornful laugh: "By God, mama, I don't see why you
have to take them in. You've got enough of them in the family
already."</p>
<p>"Mama, in heaven's name&mdash;" Helen began furiously. At this
moment Gant strode in out of the dusk, carrying a mottled package
of pork chops, and muttering rhetorically to himself. There was
another long peal of laughter above. He halted abruptly,
startled, and lifted his head. Luke, listening attentively at the
foot of the stairs, exploded in a loud boisterous guffaw, and the
girl, her annoyance changing at once to angry amusement, walked
toward her father's inquiring face, and prodded him several times
in the ribs.</p>
<p>"Hey?" he said startled. "What is it?"</p>
<p>"Miss Eliza's got a crazy man upstairs," she sniggered,
enjoying his amazement.</p>
<p>"Jesus God!" Gant yelled frantically, wetting his big thumb
swiftly on his tongue, and glancing up toward his Maker with an
attitude of exaggerated supplication in his small gray eyes and
the thrust of his huge bladelike nose. Then, letting his arms
slap heavily at his sides, in a gesture of defeat, he began to
walk rapidly back and forth, clucking his deprecation loudly.
Eliza stood solidly, looking from one to another, her lips
working rapidly, her white face hurt and bitter.</p>
<p>There was another long howl of mirth above. Gant paused,
caught Helen's eye, and began to grin suddenly in an unwilling
sheepish manner.</p>
<p>"God have mercy on us," he chuckled. "She'll have the place
filled with all of Barnum's freaks the next thing you know."</p>
<p>At this moment, Simon, self-contained, distinguished and grave
in his manner, descended the steps with Mr. Gilroy and Mr.
Flannagan, his companions. The two guards were red in the face,
and breathed stertorously as if from some recent exertion. Simon,
however, preserved his habitual appearance of immaculate and
well-washed urbanity.</p>
<p>"Good evening," he remarked suavely. "I hope I have not kept
you waiting long." He caught sight of Eugene.</p>
<p>"Come here, my boy," he said very kindly.</p>
<p>"It's all right," remarked Mr. Gilroy, encouragingly. "He
wouldn't hurt a fly."</p>
<p>Eugene moved into the presence.</p>
<p>"And what is your name, young man?" said Simon with his
beautiful devil's smile.</p>
<p>"Eugene."</p>
<p>"That's a very fine name," said Simon. "Always try to live up
to it." He thrust his hand carelessly and magnificently into his
coat pocket, drawing out under the boy's astonished eyes, a
handful of shining five- and ten-cent pieces.</p>
<p>"Always be good to the birds, my boy," said Simon, and he
poured the money into Eugene's cupped hands.</p>
<p>Every one looked doubtfully at Mr. Gilroy.</p>
<p>"Oh, that's all right!" said Mr. Gilroy cheerfully. "He'll
never miss it. There's lots more where that came from."</p>
<p>"He's a mul-tye-millionaire," Mr. Flannagan explained proudly.
"We give him four or five dollars in small change every morning
just to throw away."</p>
<p>Simon caught sight of Gant for the first time.</p>
<p>"Look out for the Stingaree," he cried. "Remember the
Maine."</p>
<p>"I tell you what," said Eliza laughing. "He's not so crazy as
you think."</p>
<p>'That's right," said Mr. Gilroy, noting Gant's grin. "The
Stingaree's a fish. They have them in Florida."</p>
<p>"Don't forget the birds, my friends," said Simon, going out
with his companions. "Be good to the birds."</p>
<p>They became very fond of him. Somehow he fitted into the
pattern of their life. None of them was uncomfortable in the
presence of madness. In the flowering darkness of Spring,
prisoned in a room, his satanic laughter burst suddenly out:
Eugene listened, thrilled, and slept, unable to forget the smile
of dark flowering evil, the loose pocket chinking heavily with
coins.</p>
<p>Night, the myriad rustle of tiny wings. Heard lapping water of
the inland seas.</p>
<p>&mdash;And the air will be filled with warm-throated
plum-dropping bird- notes. He was almost twelve. He was done with
childhood. As that Spring ripened he felt entirely, for the first
time, the full delight of loneliness. Sheeted in his thin
nightgown, he stood in darkness by the orchard window of the back
room at Gant's, drinking the sweet air down, exulting in his
isolation in darkness, hearing the strange wail of the whistle
going west.</p>
<p>The prison walls of self had closed entirely round him; he was
walled completely by the esymplastic power of his
imagination&mdash;he had learned by now to project mechanically,
before the world, an acceptable counterfeit of himself which
would protect him from intrusion. He no longer went through the
torment of the recess flight and pursuit. He was now in one of
the upper grades of grammar school, he was one of the Big Boys.
His hair had been cut when he was nine years old, after a bitter
siege against Eliza's obstinacy. He no longer suffered because of
the curls. But he had grown like a weed, he already topped his
mother by an inch or two; his body was big-boned but very thin
and fragile, with no meat on it; his legs were absurdly long,
thin, and straight, giving him a curious scissored look as he
walked with long bounding strides.</p>
<p>Stuck on a thin undeveloped neck beneath a big wide-browed
head covered thickly by curling hair which had changed, since his
infancy, from a light maple to dark brown-black, was a face so
small, and so delicately sculptured, that it seemed not to belong
to its body. The strangeness, the remote quality of this face was
enhanced by its brooding fabulous concentration, by its
passionate dark intensity, across which every splinter of thought
or sensation flashed like a streak of light across a pool. The
mouth was full, sensual, extraordinarily mobile, the lower lip
deeply scooped and pouting. His rapt dreaming intensity set the
face usually in an expression of almost sullen contemplation; he
smiled, oftener than he laughed, inwardly, at some extravagant
invention, or some recollection of the absurd, now fully
appreciated for the first time. He did not open his lips to
smile&mdash;there was a swift twisted flicker across his mouth.
His thick heavily arched eyebrows grew straight across the base
of his nose.</p>
<p>That Spring he was more alone than ever. Eliza's departure for
Dixieland three or four years before, and the disruption of
established life at Gant's, had begun the loosening of his first
friendships with the neighborhood boys, Harry Tarkinton, Max
Isaacs, and the others, and had now almost completely severed
them. Occasionally he saw these boys again, occasionally he
resumed again, at sporadic intervals, his association with them,
but he now had no steady companionship, he had only a series of
associations with children whose parents stayed for a time at
Dixieland, with Tim O'Doyle, whose mother ran the Brunswick, with
children here and there who briefly held his interest.</p>
<p>But he became passionately bored with them, plunged into a
miasmic swamp of weariness and horror, after a time, because of
the dullness and ugliness of their lives, their minds, their
amusements. Dull people filled him with terror: he was never so
much frightened by tedium in his own life as in the lives of
others&mdash;his early distaste for Pett Pentland and her grim
rusty aunts came from submerged memories of the old house on
Central Avenue, the smell of mellow apples and medicine in the
hot room, the swooping howl of the wind outside, and the endless
monotone of their conversation on disease, death, and misery. He
was filled with terror and anger against them because they were
able to live, to thrive, in this horrible depression that
sickened him.</p>
<p>Thus, the entire landscape, the whole physical background of
his life, was now dappled by powerful prejudices of liking and
distaste formed, God knows how, or by what intangible affinities
of thought, feeling and connotation. Thus, one street would seem
to him to be a "good street"&mdash;to exist in the rich light of
cheerful, abundant, and high-hearted living; another,
inexplicably, a "bad street," touching him somehow with fear,
hopelessness, depression.</p>
<p>Perhaps the cold red light of some remembered winter's
afternoon, waning pallidly over a playing-field, with all its
mockery of Spring, while lights flared up smokily in houses, the
rabble-rout of children dirtily went in to supper, and men came
back to the dull but warm imprisonment of home, oil lamps (which
he hated), and bedtime, clotted in him a hatred of the place
which remained even when the sensations that caused it were
forgotten.</p>
<p>Or, returning from some country walk in late autumn, he would
come back from Cove or Valley with dewy nose, clotted boots, the
smell of a mashed persimmon on his knee, and the odor of wet
earth and grass on the palms of his hands, and with a stubborn
dislike and suspicion of the scene he had visited, and fear of
the people who lived there.</p>
<p>He had the most extraordinary love of incandescence. He hated
dull lights, smoky lights, soft, or sombre lights. At night he
wanted to be in rooms brilliantly illuminated with beautiful,
blazing, sharp, poignant lights. After that, the dark.</p>
<p>He played games badly, although he took a violent interest in
sports. Max Isaacs continued to interest him as an athlete long
after he had ceased to interest him as a person. The game Max
Isaacs excelled in was baseball. Usually he played one of the
outfield positions, ranging easily about in his field, when a
ball was hit to him, with the speed of a panther, making
impossible catches with effortless grace. He was a terrific
hitter, standing at the plate casually but alertly, and meeting
the ball squarely with a level swinging smack of his heavy
shoulders. Eugene tried vainly to imitate the precision and power
of this movement, which drove the ball in a smoking arc out of
the lot, but he was never able: he chopped down clumsily and
blindly, knocking a futile bounder to some nimble baseman. In the
field he was equally useless: he never learned to play in a team,
to become a limb of that single animal which united
telepathically in a concerted movement. He became nervous, highly
excited, and erratic in team- play, but he spent hours alone with
another boy, or, after the mid- day meal, with Ben, passing a
ball back and forth.</p>
<p>He developed blinding speed, bending all the young suppleness
of his long thin body behind the ball, exulting as it smoked into
the pocket of the mitt with a loud smack, or streaked up with a
sharp dropping curve. Ben, taken by surprise by a fast drop,
would curse him savagely, and in a rage hurl the ball back into
his thin gloved hand. In the Spring and Summer he went as often
as he could afford it, or was invited, to the baseball games in
the district league, a fanatic partisan of the town club and its
best players, making a fantasy constantly of himself in a heroic
game-saving r&ocirc;le.</p>
<p>But he was in no way able to submit himself to the discipline,
the hard labor, the acceptance of defeat and failure that make a
good athlete; he wanted always to win, he wanted always to be the
general, the heroic spear-head of victory. And after that he
wanted to be loved. Victory and love. In all of his swarming
fantasies Eugene saw himself like this&mdash;unbeaten and
beloved. But moments of clear vision returned to him when all the
defeat and misery of his life was revealed. He saw his gangling
and absurd figure, his remote unpractical brooding face, too like
a dark strange flower to arouse any feeling among his companions
and his kin, he thought, but discomfort, bitterness, and mockery;
he remembered, with a drained sick heart, the countless
humiliations, physical and verbal, he had endured, at the hands
of school and family, before the world, and as he thought, the
horns of victory died within the wood, the battle-drums of
triumph stopped, the proud clangor of the gongs quivered away in
silence. His eagles had flown; he saw himself, in a moment of
reason, as a madman playing C&aelig;sar. He craned his head aside
and covered his face with his hand.</p>
<h3>16</h3>
<p>The Spring grew ripe. There was at mid-day a soft drowsiness
in the sun. Warm sporting gusts of wind howled faintly at the
eaves; the young grass bent; the daisies twinkled.</p>
<p>He pressed his high knees uncomfortably against the bottom of
his desk, grew nostalgic on his dreams. Bessie Barnes scrawled
vigorously two rows away, displaying her long full silken leg.
Open for me the gates of delight. Behind her sat a girl named
Ruth, dark, with milk-white skin, eyes as gentle as her name, and
thick black hair, parted in middle. He thought of a wild life
with Bessie and of a later resurrection, a pure holy life, with
Ruth.</p>
<p>One day, after the noon recess, they were marshalled by the
teachers&mdash;all of the children in the three upper
grades&mdash;and marched upstairs to the big assembly hall. They
were excited, and gossiped in low voices as they went. They had
never been called upstairs at this hour. Quite often the bells
rang in the halls: they sprang quickly into line and were marched
out in double files. That was fire drill. They liked that. Once
they emptied the building in four minutes.</p>
<p>This was something new. They marched into the big room and sat
down in blocks of seats assigned to each class: they sat with a
seat between each of them. In a moment the door of the
principal's office on the left&mdash;where little boys were
beaten&mdash;was opened, and the principal came out. He walked
around the corner of the big room and stepped softly up on the
platform. He began to talk.</p>
<p>He was a new principal. Young Armstrong, who had smelled the
flower so delicately, and who had visited Daisy, and who once had
almost beaten Eugene because of the smutty rhymes, was gone. The
new principal was older. He was about thirty-eight years old. He
was a strong rather heavy man a little under six feet tall; he
was one of a large family who had grown up on a Tennessee farm.
His father was poor but he had helped his children to get an
education. All this Eugene knew already, because the principal
made long talks to them in the morning and said he had never had
their advantages. He pointed to himself with some pride. And he
urged the little boys, playfully but earnestly, to "be not like
dumb, driven cattle, be a hero in the strife." That was poetry,
Longfellow.</p>
<p>The principal had thick powerful shoulders; clumsy white arms,
knotted with big awkward country muscles. Eugene had seen him
once hoeing in the schoolyard; each of them had been given a
plant to set out. He got those muscles on the farm. The boys said
he beat very hard. He walked with a clumsy stealthy
tread&mdash;awkward and comical enough, it is true, but he could
be up at a boy's back before you knew it. Otto Krause called him
Creeping Jesus. The name stuck, among the tough crowd. Eugene was
a little shocked by it.</p>
<p>The principal had a white face of waxen transparency, with
deep flat cheeks like the Pentlands, a pallid nose, a trifle
deeper in its color than his face, and a thin slightly-bowed
mouth. His hair was coarse, black, and thick, but he never let it
grow too long. He had short dry hands, strong, and always coated
deeply with chalk. When he passed near by, Eugene got the odor of
chalk and of the schoolhouse: his heart grew cold with excitement
and fear. The sanctity of chalk and school hovered about the
man's flesh. He was the one who could touch without being
touched, beat without being beaten. Eugene had terrible fantasies
of resistance, shuddering with horror as he thought of the awful
consequences of fighting back: something like God's fist in
lightning. Then he looked around cautiously to see if any one had
noticed.</p>
<p>The principal's name was Leonard. He made long speeches to the
children every morning, after a ten-minute prayer. He had a high
sonorous countrified voice which often trailed off in a comical
drawl; he got lost very easily in revery, would pause in the
middle of a sentence, gaze absently off with his mouth half-open
and an expression of stupefaction on his face, and return
presently to the business before him, his mind still loose, with
witless distracted laugh.</p>
<p>He talked to the children aimlessly, pompously, dully for
twenty minutes every morning: the teachers yawned carefully
behind their hands, the students made furtive drawings, or passed
notes. He spoke to them of "the higher life" and of "the things
of the mind." He assured them that they were the leaders of
to-morrow and the hope of the world. Then he quoted
Longfellow.</p>
<p>He was a good man, a dull man, a man of honor. He had a broad
streak of coarse earthy brutality in him. He loved a farm better
than anything in the world except a school. He had rented a big
dilapidated house in a grove of lordly oaks on the outskirts of
town: he lived there with his wife and his two children. He had a
cow&mdash;he was never without a cow: he would go out at night
and morning to milk her, laughing his vacant silly laugh, and
giving her a good smacking kick in the belly to make her come
round into position.</p>
<p>He was a heavy-handed master. He put down rebellion with good
cornfield violence. If a boy was impudent to him he would rip him
powerfully from his seat, drag his wriggling figure into his
office, breathing stertorously as he walked along at his clumsy
rapid gait, and saying roundly, in tones of scathing contempt:
"Why, you young upstart, we'll just see who's master here. I'll
show you, my sonny, if I'm to be dictated to by every two-by-four
whippersnapper who comes along." And once within the office, with
the glazed door shut, he published the stern warning of his
justice by the loud exertion of his breathing, the cutting swish
of his rattan, and the yowls of pain and terror that he exacted
from his captive.</p>
<p>He had called the school together that day to command it to
write him a composition. The children sat, staring dumbly up at
him as he made a rambling explanation of what he wanted. Finally
he announced a prize. He would give five dollars from his own
pocket to the student who wrote the best paper. That aroused
them. There was a rustle of interest.</p>
<p>They were to write a paper on the meaning of a French picture
called The Song of the Lark. It represented a French peasant
girl, barefooted, with a sickle in one hand, and with face
upturned in the morning-light of the fields as she listened to
the bird-song. They were asked to describe what they saw in the
expression of the girl's face. They were asked to tell what the
picture meant to them. It had been reproduced in one of their
readers. A larger print was now hung up on the platform for their
inspection. Sheets of yellow paper were given them. They stared,
thoughtfully masticating their pencils. Finally, the room was
silent save for a minute scratching on paper.</p>
<p>The warm wind spouted about the eaves; the grasses bent,
whistling gently.</p>
<p>Eugene wrote: "The girl is hearing the song of the first lark.
She knows that it means Spring has come. She is about seventeen
or eighteen years old. Her people are very poor, she has never
been anywhere. In the winter she wears wooden shoes. She is
making out as if she was going to whistle. But she doesn't let on
to the bird that she has heard him. The rest of her people are
behind her, coming down the field, but we do not see them. She
has a father, a mother, and two brothers. They have worked hard
all their life. The girl is the youngest child. She thinks she
would like to go away somewhere and see the world. Sometimes she
hears the whistle of a train that is going to Paris. She has
never ridden on a train in her life. She would like to go to
Paris. She would like to have some fine clothes, she would like
to travel. Perhaps she would like to start life new in America,
the Land of Opportunity. The girl has had a hard time. Her people
do not understand her. If they saw her listening to the lark they
would poke fun at her. She has never had the advantages of a good
education, her people are so poor, but she would profit by her
opportunity if she did, more than some people who have. You can
tell by looking at her that she's intelligent."</p>
<p>It was early in May; examinations came in another two weeks.
He thought of them with excitement and pleasure&mdash;he liked
the period of hard cramming, the long reviews, the delight of
emptying out abundantly on paper his stored knowledge. The big
assembly room had about it the odor of completion, of sharp
nervous ecstasy. All through the summer it would be drowsy-warm;
if only here, alone, with the big plaster cast of Minerva,
himself and Bessie Barnes, or Miss&mdash;Miss&mdash;</p>
<p>"We want this boy," said Margaret Leonard. She handed Eugene's
paper over to her husband. They were starting a private school
for boys. That was what the paper had been for.</p>
<p>Leonard took the paper, pretended to read half a page, looked
off absently into eternity, and began to rub his chin
reflectively, leaving a slight coating of chalk-dust on his face.
Then, catching her eye, he laughed idiotically, and said: "Why,
that little rascal! Huh? Do you suppose&mdash;?"</p>
<p>Feeling delightfully scattered, he bent over with a long
suction of whining laughter, slapping his knee and leaving a
chalk print, making a slobbering noise in his mouth.</p>
<p>"The Lord have mercy!" he gasped.</p>
<p>"Here! Never you mind about that," she said, laughing with
tender sharp amusement. "Pull yourself together and see this
boy's people." She loved the man dearly, and he loved her.</p>
<p>A few days later Leonard assembled the children a second time.
He made a rambling speech, the purport of which was to inform
them that one of them had won the prize, but to conceal the
winner's name. Then, after several divagations, which he
thoroughly enjoyed, he read Eugene's paper, announced his name,
and called him forward.</p>
<p>Chalkface took chalkhand. The boy's heart thundered against
his ribs. The proud horns blared, he tasted glory.</p>
<p>Patiently, all through the summer, Leonard laid siege to Gant
and Eliza. Gant fidgeted, spoke shiftily, finally said:</p>
<p>"You'll have to see his mother." Privately he was bitterly
scornful, roared the merits of the public school as an incubator
of citizenship. The family was contemptuous. Private school! Mr.
Vanderbilt! Ruin him for good!</p>
<p>Which made Eliza reflective. She had a good streak of
snobbism. Mr. Vanderbilt? She was as good as any of them. They'd
just see.</p>
<p>"Who are you going to have?" she asked. "Have you drummed any
one up yet?"</p>
<p>Leonard mentioned the sons of several fashionable and wealthy
people,&mdash;of Dr. Kitchen, the eye, ear, nose and throat man,
Mr. Arthur, the corporation lawyer, and Bishop Raper, of the
Episcopal diocese.</p>
<p>Eliza grew more reflective. She thought of Pett. She needn't
give herself airs.</p>
<p>"How much are you asking?" she said.</p>
<p>He told her the tuition was one hundred dollars a year. She
pursed her lips lingeringly before she answered.</p>
<p>"Hm-m!" she began, with a bantering smile, as she looked at
Eugene. "That's a whole lot of money. You know," she continued
with her tremulous smile, "as the darkey says, we're
pore-folks."</p>
<p>Eugene squirmed.</p>
<p>"Well what about it, boy?" said Eliza banteringly. "Do you
think you're worth that much money?"</p>
<p>Mr. Leonard placed his white dry hand upon Eugene's shoulders,
affectionately sliding it down his back and across his kidneys,
leaving white chalk prints everywhere. Then he clamped his meaty
palm tightly around the slender bracelet of boy-arm.</p>
<p>"That boy's worth it," he said, shaking him gently to and fro.
"Yes, sir!"</p>
<p>Eugene smiled painfully. Eliza continued to purse her lips.
She felt a strong psychic relation to Leonard. They both took
time.</p>
<p>"Say," she said, rubbing her broad red nose, and smiling
slyly, "I used to be a school-teacher. You didn't know that, did
you? But I didn't get any such prices as you're asking," she
added. "I thought myself mighty lucky if I got my board and
twenty dollars a month."</p>
<p>"Is that so, Mrs. Gant?" said Mr. Leonard with great interest.
"Well, sir!" He began to laugh in a vague whine, pulling Eugene
about more violently and deadening his arm under his crushing
grip.</p>
<p>"Yes," said Eliza, "I remember my father&mdash;it was long
before you were born, boy," she said to Eugene, "for I hadn't
laid eyes on your papa&mdash;as the feller says, you were nothing
but a dish-rag hanging out in heaven&mdash;I'd have laughed at
any one who suggested marriage then&mdash;Well, I tell you what
[she shook her head with a sad pursed deprecating mouth], we were
mighty poor at the time, I can tell you.&mdash;I was thinking
about it the other day&mdash;many's the time we didn't have food
in the house for the next meal.&mdash;Well, as I was saying, your
grandfather [addressing Eugene] came home one night and
said&mdash;Look here, what about it?&mdash;Who do you suppose I
saw to- day?&mdash;I remember him just as plain as if I saw him
standing here&mdash;I had a feeling&mdash;[addressing Leonard
with a doubtful smile] I don't know what you'd call it but it's
pretty strange when you come to think about it, isn't it?&mdash;I
had just finished helping Aunt Jane set the table&mdash;she had
come all the way from Yancey County to visit your
grandmother&mdash;when all of a sudden it flashed over
me&mdash;mind you [to Leonard] I never looked out the window or
anything but I knew just as well as I knew anything that he was
coming&mdash;mercy I cried&mdash;here comes&mdash;why what on
earth are you talking about, Eliza? said your grandma&mdash;I
remember she went to the door and looked out down the
path&mdash;there's no one there&mdash;He's acoming, I
said&mdash;wait and see&mdash;Who? said your
grandmother&mdash;Why, father, I said&mdash;he's carrying
something on his shoulder&mdash;and sure enough&mdash;I had no
sooner got the words out of my mouth than there he was just
acoming it for all he was worth, up the path, with a tow-sack
full of apples on his back&mdash;you could tell by the way he
walked that he had news of some sort&mdash;well&mdash;sure
enough&mdash;without stopping to say howdy-do&mdash;I remembered
he began to talk almost before he got into the house&mdash;O
father, I called out&mdash;you've brought the apples&mdash;it was
the year after I had almost died of pneumonia&mdash;I'd been
spitting up blood ever since&mdash;and having
hemorrhages&mdash;and I asked him to bring me some
apples&mdash;Well sir, mother said to him, and she looked mighty
queer, I can tell you&mdash;that's the strangest thing I ever
heard of&mdash;and she told him what had happened&mdash;Well, he
looked pretty serious and said&mdash;Yes, I'll never forget the
way he said it&mdash;I reckon she saw me. I wasn't there but I
was thinking of being there and coming up the path at that very
moment&mdash;I've got news for you he said&mdash;who do you
suppose I saw to-day&mdash;why, I've no idea, I said&mdash;why
old Professor Truman&mdash;he came rushing up to me in town and
said, see here: where's Eliza&mdash;I've got a job for her if she
wants it, teaching school this winter out on Beaverdam&mdash;why,
pshaw, said your grandfather, she's never taught school a day in
her life&mdash;and Professor Truman laughed just as big as you
please and said never you mind about that&mdash;Eliza can do
anything she sets her mind on&mdash;well sir, that's the way it
all came about." High-sorrowful and sad, she paused for a moment,
adrift, her white face slanting her life back through the aisled
grove of years.</p>
<p>"Well, sir!" said Mr. Leonard vaguely, rubbing his chin. "You
young rascal, you!" he said, giving Eugene another jerk, and
beginning to laugh with narcissistic pleasure.</p>
<p>Eliza pursed her lips slowly.</p>
<p>"Well," she said, "I'll send him to you for a year." That was
the way she did business. Tides run deep in Sargasso.</p>
<p>So, on the hairline of million-minded impulse, destiny bore
down on his life again.</p>
<p>Mr. Leonard had leased an old pre-war house, set on a hill
wooded by magnificent trees. It faced west and south, looking
toward Biltburn, and abruptly down on South End, and the negro
flats that stretched to the depot. One day early in September he
took Eugene there. They walked across town, talking weightily of
politics, across the Square, down Hatton Avenue, south into
Church, and southwesterly along the bending road that ended in
the schoolhouse on the abutting hill. The huge trees made sad
autumn music as they entered the grounds. In the broad hall of
the squat rambling old house Eugene for the first time saw
Margaret Leonard. She held a broom in her hands, and was aproned.
But his first impression was of her shocking fragility.</p>
<p>Margaret Leonard at this time was thirty-four years old. She
had borne two children, a son who was now six years old, and a
daughter who was two. As she stood there, with her long slender
fingers splayed about the broomstick, he noted, with a momentary
cold nausea, that the tip of her right index finger was flattened
out as if it had been crushed beyond healing by a hammer. But it
was years before he knew that tuberculars sometimes have such
fingers.</p>
<p>Margaret Leonard was of middling height, five feet six inches
perhaps. As the giddiness of his embarrassment wore off he saw
that she could not weigh more than eighty or ninety pounds. He
had heard of the children. Now he remembered them, and Leonard's
white muscular bulk, with a sense of horror. His swift vision
leaped at once to the sexual relation, and something in him
twisted aside, incredulous and afraid.</p>
<p>She had on a dress of crisp gray gingham, not loose or lapping
round her wasted figure, but hiding every line in her body, like
a draped stick.</p>
<p>As his mind groped out of the pain of impression he heard her
voice and, still feeling within him the strange convulsive shame,
he lifted his eyes to her face. It was the most tranquil and the
most passionate face he had ever seen. The skin was sallow with a
dead ashen tinge; beneath, the delicate bone-carving of face and
skull traced itself clearly: the cadaverous tightness of those
who are about to die had been checked. She had won her way back
just far enough to balance carefully in the scales of disease and
recovery. It was necessary for her to measure everything she
did.</p>
<p>Her thin face was given a touch of shrewdness and decision by
the straight line of her nose, the fine long carving of her chin.
Beneath the sallow minute pitted skin in her cheeks, and about
her mouth, several frayed nerve-centres twitched from moment to
moment, jarring the skin slightly without contorting or
destroying the passionate calm beauty that fed her inexhaustibly
from within. This face was the constant field of conflict, nearly
always calm, but always reflecting the incessant struggle and
victory of the enormous energy that inhabited her, over the
thousand jangling devils of depletion and weariness that tried to
pull her apart. There was always written upon her the epic poetry
of beauty and repose out of struggle&mdash;he never ceased to
feel that she had her hand around the reins of her heart, that
gathered into her grasp were all the straining wires and sinews
of disunion which would scatter and unjoint her members, once she
let go. Literally, physically, he felt that, the great tide of
valiance once flowed out of her, she would immediately go to
pieces. She was like some great general, famous, tranquil,
wounded unto death, who, with his fingers clamped across a
severed artery, stops for an hour the ebbing of his
life&mdash;sends on the battle.</p>
<p>Her hair was coarse and dull-brown, fairly abundant, tinged
lightly with gray: it was combed evenly in the middle and bound
tightly in a knot behind. Everything about her was very clean,
like a scrubbed kitchen board: she took his hand, he felt the
firm nervous vitality of her fingers, and he noticed how clean
and scrubbed her thin somewhat labor-worn hands were. If he
noticed her emaciation at all now, it was only with a sense of
her purification: he felt himself in union not with disease, but
with the greatest health he had ever known. She made a high music
in him. His heart lifted.</p>
<p>"This," said Mr. Leonard, stroking him gently across the
kidneys, "is Mister Eugene Gant."</p>
<p>"Well, sir," she said, in a low voice, in which a vibrant wire
was thrumming, "I'm glad to know you." The voice had in it that
quality of quiet wonder that he had sometimes heard in the voices
of people who had seen or were told of some strange event, or
coincidence, that seemed to reach beyond life, beyond
nature&mdash;a note of acceptance; and suddenly he knew that all
life seemed eternally strange to this woman, that she looked
directly into the beauty and the mystery and the tragedy in the
hearts of men, and that he seemed beautiful to her.</p>
<p>Her face darkened with the strange passionate vitality that
left no print, that lived there bodiless like life; her brown
eyes darkened into black as if a bird had flown through them and
left the shadow of its wings. She saw his small remote face
burning strangely at the end of his long unfleshed body, she saw
the straight thin shanks, the big feet turned awkwardly inward,
the dusty patches on his stockings at the knees, and his thin
wristy arms that stuck out painfully below his cheap ill-fitting
jacket; she saw the thin hunched line of his shoulders, the
tangled mass of hair&mdash;and she did not laugh.</p>
<p>He turned his face up to her as a prisoner who recovers light,
as a man long pent in darkness who bathes himself in the great
pool of dawn, as a blind man who feels upon his eyes the white
core and essence of immutable brightness. His body drank in her
great light as a famished castaway the rain: he closed his eyes
and let the great light bathe him, and when he opened them again,
he saw that her own were luminous and wet.</p>
<p>Then she began to laugh. "Why, Mr. Leonard," she said, "what
in the world! He's almost as tall as you. Here, boy. Stand up
here while I measure." Deft-fingered, she put them back to back.
Mr. Leonard was two or three inches taller than Eugene. He began
to whine with laughter.</p>
<p>"Why, the rascal," he said. "That little shaver."</p>
<p>"How old are you, boy?" she asked.</p>
<p>"I'll be twelve next month," he said.</p>
<p>"Well, what do you know about that!" she said wonderingly. "I
tell you what, though," she continued. "We've got to get some
meat on those bones. You can't go around like that. I don't like
the way you look." She shook her head.</p>
<p>He was uncomfortable, disturbed, vaguely resentful. It
embarrassed and frightened him to be told that he was "delicate";
it touched sharply on his pride.</p>
<p>She took him into a big room on the left that had been fitted
out as a living-room and library. She watched his face light with
eagerness as he saw the fifteen hundred or two thousand books
shelved away in various places. He sat down clumsily in a wicker
chair by the table and waited until she returned, bringing him a
plate of sandwiches and a tall glass full of clabber, which he
had never tasted before.</p>
<p>When he had finished, she drew a chair near to his, and sat
down. She had previously sent Leonard out on some barnyard
errands; he could be heard from time to time shouting in an
authoritative country voice to his live stock.</p>
<p>"Well, tell me boy," she said, "what have you been
reading?"</p>
<p>Craftily he picked his way across the waste land of printery,
naming as his favorites those books which he felt would win her
approval. As he had read everything, good and bad, that the town
library contained, he was able to make an impressive showing.
Sometimes she stopped him to question about a book&mdash;he
rebuilt the story richly with a blazing tenacity of detail that
satisfied her wholly. She was excited and eager&mdash;she saw at
once how abundantly she could feed this ravenous hunger for
knowledge, experience, wisdom. And he knew suddenly the joy of
obedience: the wild ignorant groping, the blind hunt, the
desperate baffled desire was now to be ruddered, guided,
controlled. The way through the passage to India, that he had
never been able to find, would now be charted for him. Before he
went away she had given him a fat volume of nine hundred pages,
shot through with spirited engravings of love and battle, of the
period he loved best.</p>
<p>He was drowned deep at midnight in the destiny of the man who
killed the bear, the burner of windmills and the scourge of
banditry, in all the life of road and tavern in the Middle Ages,
in valiant and beautiful Gerard, the seed of genius, the father
of Erasmus. Eugene thought The Cloister and the Hearth the best
story he had ever read.</p>
<p>The Altamont Fitting School was the greatest venture of their
lives. All the delayed success that Leonard had dreamed of as a
younger man he hoped to realize now. For him the school was
independence, mastership, power, and, he hoped, prosperity. For
her, teaching was its own exceeding great reward&mdash;her lyric
music, her life, the world in which plastically she built to
beauty what was good, the lord of her soul that gave her spirit
life while he broke her body.</p>
<p>In the cruel volcano of the boy's mind, the little brier moths
of his idolatry wavered in to their strange marriage and were
consumed. One by one the merciless years reaped down his gods and
captains. What had lived up to hope? What had withstood the
scourge of growth and memory? Why had the gold become so dim? All
of his life, it seemed, his blazing loyalties began with men and
ended with images; the life he leaned on melted below his weight,
and looking down, he saw he clasped a statue; but enduring, a
victorious reality amid his shadow-haunted heart, she remained,
who first had touched his blinded eyes with light, who nested his
hooded houseless soul. She remained.</p>
<p>O death in life that turns our men to stone! O change that
levels down our gods! If only one lives yet, above the cinders of
the consuming years, shall not this dust awaken, shall not dead
faith revive, shall we not see God again, as once in morning, on
the mountain? Who walks with us on the hills?</p>
<h3>17</h3>
<p>Eugene spent the next four years of his life in Leonard's
school. Against the bleak horror of Dixieland, against the dark
road of pain and death down which the great limbs of Gant had
already begun to slope, against all the loneliness and
imprisonment of his own life which had gnawed him like hunger,
these years at Leonard's bloomed like golden apples.</p>
<p>From Leonard he got little&mdash;a dry campaign over an arid
waste of Latin prose: first, a harsh, stiff, unintelligent
skirmishing among the rules of grammar, which frightened and
bewildered him needlessly, and gave him for years an unhealthy
dislike of syntax, and an absurd prejudice against the laws on
which the language was built. Then, a year's study of the lean,
clear precision of C&aelig;sar, the magnificent structure of the
style&mdash;the concision, the skeleton certainty, deadened by
the disjointed daily partition, the dull parsing, the lumbering
clich&eacute; of pedantic translation:</p>
<p>"Having done all things that were necessary, and the season
now being propitious for carrying on war, C&aelig;sar began to
arrange his legions in battle array."</p>
<p>All the dark pageantry of war in Gaul, the thrust of the Roman
spear through the shield of hide, the barbaric parleys in the
forests, and the proud clangor of triumph&mdash;all that might
have been supplied in the story of the great realist, by one
touch of the transforming passion with which a great teacher
projects his work, was lacking.</p>
<p>Instead, glibly, the wheels ground on into the hard rut of
method and memory. March 12, last year&mdash;three days late.
Cogitata. Neut. pl. of participle used as substantive. Quo used
instead of ut to express purpose when comparative follows. Eighty
lines for to-morrow.</p>
<p>They spent a weary age, two years, on that dull dog, Cicero.
De Senectute. De Amicitia. They skirted Virgil because John
Dorsey Leonard was a bad sailor&mdash;he was not at all sure of
Virgilian navigation. He hated exploration. He distrusted
voyages. Next year, he said. And the great names of Ovid, lord of
the elves and gnomes, the Bacchic piper of Amores, or of
Lucretius, full of the rhythm of tides. Nox est perpetua.</p>
<p>"Huh?" drawled Mr. Leonard, vacantly beginning to laugh. He
was fingermarked with chalk from chin to crotch. Stephen ("Pap")
Rheinhart leaned forward gently and fleshed his penpoint in
Eugene Gant's left rump. Eugene grunted painfully.</p>
<p>"Why, no," said Mr. Leonard, stroking his chin. "A different
sort of Latin."</p>
<p>"What sort?" Tom Davis insisted. "Harder than Cicero?"</p>
<p>"Well," said Mr. Leonard, dubiously, "different. A little
beyond you at present."</p>
<p>"&mdash;est perpetua. Una dormienda. Luna dies et nox."</p>
<p>"Is Latin poetry hard to read?" Eugene said.</p>
<p>"Well," said Mr. Leonard, shaking his head. "It's not easy.
Horace&mdash;" he began carefully.</p>
<p>"He wrote Odes and Epodes," said Tom Davis. "What is an Epode,
Mr. Leonard?"</p>
<p>"Why," said Mr. Leonard reflectively, "it's a form of
poetry."</p>
<p>"Hell!" said "Pap" Rheinhart in a rude whisper to Eugene. "I
knew that before I paid tuition."</p>
<p>Smiling lusciously, and stroking himself with gentle fingers,
Mr. Leonard turned back to the lesson.</p>
<p>"Now let me see," he began.</p>
<p>"Who was Catullus?" Eugene shouted violently. Like a flung
spear in his brain, the name.</p>
<p>"He was a poet," Mr. Leonard answered thoughtlessly, quickly,
startled. He regretted.</p>
<p>"What sort of poetry did he write?" asked Eugene.</p>
<p>There was no answer.</p>
<p>"Was it like Horace?"</p>
<p>"No-o," said Mr. Leonard reflectively. "It wasn't exactly like
Horace."</p>
<p>"What was it like?" said Tom Davis. "Like your granny's gut,"
"Pap" Rheinhart toughly whispered.</p>
<p>"Why&mdash;he wrote on topics of general interest in his day,"
said Mr. Leonard easily.</p>
<p>"Did he write about being in love?" said Eugene in a quivering
voice.</p>
<p>Tom Davis turned a surprised face on him. "Gre-a-at Day!" he
exclaimed, after a moment. Then he began to laugh.</p>
<p>"He wrote about being in love," Eugene cried with sudden
certain passion. "He wrote about being in love with a lady named
Lesbia. Ask Mr. Leonard if you don't believe me."</p>
<p>They turned thirsty faces up to him.</p>
<p>"Why&mdash;no&mdash;yes&mdash;I don't know about all that,"
said Mr. Leonard, challengingly, confused. "Where'd you hear all
this, boy?"</p>
<p>"I read it in a book," said Eugene, wondering where. Like a
flung spear, the name.</p>
<p>&mdash;Whose tongue was fanged like a serpent, flung spear of
ecstasy and passion.</p>
<p>Odi et amo: quore id faciam...</p>
<p>"Well, not altogether," said Mr. Leonard. "Some of them," he
conceded.</p>
<p>...fortasse requiris. Nescio, sed fieri sentio et
excrucior.</p>
<p>"Who was she?" said Tom Davis.</p>
<p>"Oh, it was the custom in those days," said Mr. Leonard
carelessly. "Like Dante and Beatrice. It was a way the poet had
of paying a compliment."</p>
<p>The serpent whispered. There was a distillation of wild
exultancy in his blood. The rags of obedience, servility,
reverential awe dropped in a belt around him.</p>
<p>"She was a man's wife!" he said loudly. "That's who she
was."</p>
<p>Awful stillness.</p>
<p>"Why&mdash;here&mdash;who told you that?" said Mr. Leonard,
bewildered, but considering matrimony a wild and possibly
dangerous myth. "Who told you, boy?"</p>
<p>"What was she, then?" said Tom Davis pointedly.</p>
<p>"Why&mdash;not exactly," Mr. Leonard murmured, rubbing his
chin.</p>
<p>"She was a Bad Woman," said Eugene. Then, most desperately, he
added: "She was a Little Chippie."</p>
<p>"Pap" Rheinhart drew in his breath sharply.</p>
<p>"What's that, what's that, what's that?" cried Mr. Leonard
rapidly when he could speak. Fury boiled up in him. He sprang
from his chair. "What did you say, boy?"</p>
<p>But he thought of Margaret and looked down, with a sudden
sense of palsy, into the white ruination of boy-face. Too far
beyond. He sat down again, shaken.</p>
<p>&mdash;Whose foulest cry was shafted with his passion, whose
greatest music flowered out of filth&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"Nulla potest mulier tantum se dicere amatam<br>
Vere, quantum a me Lesbia amata mea es."</blockquote>
<p>"You should be more careful of your talk, Eugene," said Mr.
Leonard gently.</p>
<p>"See here!" he exclaimed suddenly, turning with violence to
his book. "This is getting no work done. Come on, now!" he said
heartily, spitting upon his intellectual hands. "You rascals
you!" he said, noting Tom Davis' grin. "I know what you're
after&mdash;you want to take up the whole period."</p>
<p>Tom Davis' hearty laughter boomed out, mingling with his own
whine.</p>
<p>"All right, Tom," said Mr. Leonard briskly, "page 43, section
6, line 15. Begin at that point."</p>
<p>At this moment the bell rang and Tom Davis' laughter filled
the room.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, in charted lanes of custom, he gave competent
instruction. He would perhaps have had difficulty in constructing
a page of Latin prose and verse with which he had not become
literally familiar by years of repetition. In Greek, certainly,
his deficiency would have been even more marked, but he would
have known a second aorist or an optative in the dark (if he had
ever met it before). There were two final years of precious
Greek: they read the Anabasis.</p>
<p>"What's the good of all this stuff?" said Tom Davis
argumentatively.</p>
<p>Mr. Leonard was on sure ground here. He understood the value
of the classics.</p>
<p>"It teaches a man to appreciate the Finer Things. It gives him
the foundations of a liberal education. It trains his mind."</p>
<p>"What good's it going to do him when he goes to work?" said
"Pap" Rheinhart. "It's not going to teach him how to grow more
corn."</p>
<p>"Well&mdash;I'm not so sure of that," said Mr. Leonard with a
protesting laugh. "I think it does."</p>
<p>"Pap" Rheinhart looked at him with a comical cock of the head.
He had a wry neck, which gave his humorous kindly face a sidelong
expression of quizzical maturity.</p>
<p>He had a gruff voice; he was full of rough kindly humor, and
chewed tobacco constantly. His father was wealthy. He lived on a
big farm in the Cove, ran a dairy and had a foundry in the town.
They were unpretending people&mdash;German stock.</p>
<p>"Pshaw, Mr. Leonard," said "Pap" Rheinhart. "Are you going to
talk Latin to your farmhands?"</p>
<p>"Egibus wantibus a peckibus of cornibus," said Tom Davis with
sounding laughter. Mr. Leonard laughed with abstracted
appreciation. The joke was his own.</p>
<p>"It trains the mind to grapple with problems of all sorts," he
said.</p>
<p>"According to what you say," said Tom Davis, "a man who has
studied Greek makes a better plumber than one who hasn't."</p>
<p>"Yes, sir," said Mr. Leonard, shaking his head smartly, "you
know, I believe he does." He joined, pleased, with their pleasant
laughter, a loose slobbering giggle.</p>
<p>He was on trodden ground. They engaged him in long debates: as
he ate his lunch, he waved a hot biscuit around, persuasive,
sweetly reasonable, exhaustively minute in an effort to prove the
connection of Greek and groceries. The great wind of Athens had
touched him not at all. Of the delicate and sensuous intelligence
of the Greeks, their feminine grace, the constructive power and
subtlety of their intelligence, the instability of their
character, and the structure, restraint and perfection of their
forms, he said nothing.</p>
<p>He had caught a glimpse, in an American college, of the great
structure of the most architectural of languages: he felt the
sculptural perfection of such a word as [Greek word], but his
opinions smelled of chalk, the classroom, and a very bad
lamp&mdash;Greek was good because it was ancient, classic, and
academic. The smell of the East, the dark tide of the Orient that
flowed below, touched the lives of poet and soldier, with
something perverse, evil, luxurious, was as far from his life as
Lesbos. He was simply the mouthpiece of a formula of which he was
assured without having a genuine belief.</p>
<p>[Greek phrase]</p>
<p>The mathematics and history teacher was John Dorsey's sister
Amy. She was a powerful woman, five feet ten inches tall, who
weighed 185 pounds. She had very thick black hair, straight and
oily, and very black eyes, giving a heavy sensuousness to her
face. Her thick forearms were fleeced with light down. She was
not fat, but she corsetted tightly, her powerful arms and heavy
shoulders bulging through the cool white of her shirtwaists. In
warm weather she perspired abundantly: her waists were stained
below the arm- pits with big spreading blots of sweat; in the
winter, as she warmed herself by the fire, she had about her the
exciting odor of chalk, and the strong good smell of a healthy
animal. Eugene, passing down the wind-swept back porch one day in
winter, looked in on her room just as her tiny niece opened the
door to come out. She sat before a dancing coal-fire, after her
bath, drawing on her stockings. Fascinated, he stared at her
broad red shoulders, her big body steaming cleanly like a
beast.</p>
<p>She liked the fire and the radiance of warmth: sleepily alert
she sat by the stove, with her legs spread, sucking in the heat,
her large earth strength more heavily sensuous than her
brother's. Stroked by the slow heat-tingle she smiled slowly with
indifferent affection on all the boys. No men came to see her:
like a pool she was thirsty for lips. She sought no one. With
lazy cat-warmth she smiled on all the world.</p>
<p>She was a good teacher of mathematics: number to her was
innate. Lazily she took their tablets, worked answers lazily,
smiling good- naturedly with contempt. Behind her, at a desk,
Durand Jarvis moaned passionately to Eugene, and writhed
erotically, gripping the leaf of his desk fiercely.</p>
<p>Sister Sheba arrived with her consumptive husband at the end
of the second year&mdash;cadaver, flecked lightly on the lips
with blood, seventy-three years old. They said he was
forty-nine&mdash;sickness made him look old. He was a tall man,
six feet three, with long straight mustaches, waxen and emaciated
as a mandarin. He painted pictures&mdash;impressionist
blobs&mdash;sheep on a gorsey hill, fishboats at the piers, with
a warm red jumble of brick buildings in the background.</p>
<p>Old Gloucester Town, Marblehead, Cape Cod Folks, Captains
Courageous&mdash;the rich salty names came reeking up with a
smell of tarred rope, dry codheads rotting in the sun, rocking
dories knee- deep in gutted fish, the strong loin-smell of the
sea in harbors, and the quiet brooding vacancy of a seaman's
face, sign of his marriage with ocean. How look the seas at dawn
in Spring? The cold gulls sleep upon the wind. But rose the
skies.</p>
<p>They saw the waxen mandarin walk shakily three times up and
down the road. It was Spring, there was a south wind high in the
big trees. He wavered along on a stick, planted before him with a
blue phthisic hand. His eyes were blue and pale as if he had been
drowned.</p>
<p>He had begotten two children by Sheba&mdash;girls. They were
exotic tender blossoms, all black and milky white, as strange and
lovely as Spring. The boys groped curiously.</p>
<p>"He must be a better man than he looks yet," said Tom Davis.
"The little 'un's only two or three years old."</p>
<p>"He's not as old as he looks," said Eugene. "He looks old
because he's been sick. He's only forty-nine."</p>
<p>"How do you know?" said Tom Davis.</p>
<p>"Miss Amy says so," said Eugene innocently.</p>
<p>"Pap" Rheinhart cocked his head on Eugene and carried his quid
deftly on the end of his tongue to the other cheek.</p>
<p>"Forty-nine!" he said, "you'd better see a doctor, boy. He's
as old as God."</p>
<p>"That's what she said," Eugene insisted doggedly.</p>
<p>"Why, of course she said it!" "Pap" Rheinhart replied. "You
don't think they're going to let it out, do you? When they're
running a school here."</p>
<p>"Son, you must be simple!" said Jack Candler who had not
thought of it up to now.</p>
<p>"Hell, you're their Pet. They know you'll believe whatever
they tell you," said Julius Arthur. "Pap" Rheinhart looked at him
searchingly, then shook his head as if a cure was impossible.
They laughed at his faith.</p>
<p>"Well, if he's so old," said Eugene, "why did old Lady
Lattimer marry him?"</p>
<p>"Why, because she couldn't get any one else, of course," said
"Pap" Rheinhart, impatient at this obtuseness.</p>
<p>"Do you suppose she has had to keep him up?" said Tom Davis
curiously. Silently they wondered. And Eugene, as he saw the two
lovely children fall like petals from their mother's heavy
breast, as he saw the waxen artist faltering his last steps to
death, and heard Sheba's strong voice leveling a conversation at
its beginning, expanding in violent burlesque all of her
opinions, was bewildered again before the unsearchable
riddle&mdash;out of death, life, out of the coarse rank earth, a
flower.</p>
<p>His faith was above conviction. Disillusion had come so often
that it had awakened in him a strain of bitter suspicion, an
occasional mockery, virulent, coarse, cruel, and subtle, which
was all the more scalding because of his own pain. Unknowingly,
he had begun to build up in himself a vast mythology for which he
cared all the more deeply because he realized its untruth.
Brokenly, obscurely, he was beginning to feel that it was not
truth that men live for&mdash;the creative men&mdash;but for
falsehood. At times his devouring, unsated brain seemed to be
beyond his governance: it was a frightful bird whose beak was in
his heart, whose talons tore unceasingly at his bowels. And this
unsleeping demon wheeled, plunged, revolved about an object,
returning suddenly, after it had flown away, with victorious
malice, leaving stripped, mean, and common all that he had
clothed with wonder.</p>
<p>But he saw hopefully that he never learned&mdash;that what
remained was the tinsel and the gold. He was so bitter with his
tongue because his heart believed so much.</p>
<p>The merciless brain lay coiled and alert like a snake: it saw
every gesture, every quick glance above his head, the shoddy
scaffolding of all reception. But these people existed for him in
a world remote from human error. He opened one window of his
heart to Margaret, together they entered the sacred grove of
poetry; but all dark desire, the dream of fair forms, and all the
misery, drunkenness, and disorder of his life at home he kept
fearfully shut. He was afraid they would hear. Desperately he
wondered how many of the boys had heard of it. And all the facts
that levelled Margaret down to life, that plunged her in the
defiling stream of life, were as unreal and horrible as a
nightmare.</p>
<p>That she had been near death from tuberculosis, that the
violent and garrulous Sheba had married an old man, who had
begotten two children and was now about to die, that the whole
little family, powerful in cohesive fidelity, were nursing their
great sores in privacy, building up before the sharp eyes and
rattling tongues of young boys a barrier of flimsy pretense and
evasion, numbed him with a sense of unreality.</p>
<p>Eugene believed in the glory and the gold.</p>
<p>He lived more at Dixieland now. He had been more closely bound
to Eliza since he began at Leonard's. Gant, Helen, and Luke were
scornful of the private school. The children were resentful of
it&mdash;a little jealous. And their temper was barbed now with a
new sting. They would say:</p>
<p>"You've ruined him completely since you sent him to a private
school." Or, "He's too good to soil his hands now that he's quit
the public school."</p>
<p>Eliza herself kept him sufficiently reminded of his
obligation. She spoke often of the effort she had to make to pay
the tuition fee, and of her poverty. She said, he must work hard,
and help her all he could in his spare hours. He should also help
her through the summer and "drum up trade" among the arriving
tourists at the station.</p>
<p>"For God's sake! What's the matter with you?" Luke jeered.
"You're not ashamed of a little honest work, are you?"</p>
<p>This way, sir, for Dixieland. Mrs. Eliza E. Gant, proprietor.
Just A Whisper Off The Square, Captain. All the comforts of the
Modern Jail. Biscuits and home-made pies just like mother should
have made but didn't.</p>
<p>That boy's a hustler.</p>
<p>At the end of Eugene's first year at Leonard's, Eliza told
John Dorsey she could no longer afford to pay the tuition. He
conferred with Margaret and, returning, agreed to take the boy
for half price.</p>
<p>"He can help you drum up new prospects," said Eliza.</p>
<p>"Yes," Leonard agreed, "that's the very thing."</p>
<p>Ben bought a new pair of shoes. They were tan. He paid six
dollars for them. He always bought good things. But they burnt
the soles of his feet. In a scowling rage he loped to his room
and took them off.</p>
<p>"Goddam it!" he yelled, and hurled them at the wall. Eliza
came to the door.</p>
<p>"You'll never have a penny, boy, as long as you waste money
the way you do. I tell you what, it's pretty bad when you think
of it." She shook her head sadly with puckered mouth.</p>
<p>"O for God's sake!" he growled. "Listen to this! By God, you
never hear me asking any one for anything, do you?" he burst out
in a rage.</p>
<p>She took the shoes and gave them to Eugene.</p>
<p>"It would be a pity to throw away a good pair of shoes," she
said. "Try 'em on, boy."</p>
<p>He tried them on. His feet were already bigger than Ben's. He
walked about carefully and painfully a few steps.</p>
<p>"How do they feel?" asked Eliza.</p>
<p>"All right, I guess," he said doubtfully. "They're a little
tight."</p>
<p>He liked their clean strength, the good smell of leather. They
were the best shoes he had ever had.</p>
<p>Ben entered the kitchen.</p>
<p>"You little brute!" he said. "You've a foot like a mule."
Scowling, he knelt and touched the straining leather at the toes.
Eugene winced.</p>
<p>"Mama, for God's sake," Ben cried out irritably, "don't make
the kid wear them if they're too small. I'll buy him a pair
myself if you're too stingy to spend the money."</p>
<p>"Why, what's wrong with these?" said Eliza. She pressed them
with her fingers. "Why, pshaw!" she said. "There's nothing wrong
with them. All shoes are a little tight at first. It won't hurt
him a bit."</p>
<p>But he had to give up at the end of six weeks. The hard
leather did not stretch, his feet hurt more every day. He limped
about more and more painfully until he planted each step woodenly
as if he were walking on blocks. His feet were numb and dead,
sore on the palms. One day, in a rage, Ben flung him down and
took them off. It was several days before he began to walk with
ease again. But his toes that had grown through boyhood straight
and strong were pressed into a pulp, the bones gnarled, bent and
twisted, the nails thick and dead.</p>
<p>"It does seem a pity to throw those good shoes away," sighed
Eliza.</p>
<p>But she had strange fits of generosity. He didn't
understand.</p>
<p>A girl came down to Altamont from the west. She was from
Sevier, a mountain town, she said. She had a big brown body, and
black hair and eyes of a Cherokee Indian.</p>
<p>"Mark my words," said Gant. "That girl's got Cherokee blood in
her somewhere."</p>
<p>She took a room, and for days rocked back and forth in a chair
before the parlor fire. She was shy, frightened, a little
sullen&mdash;her manners were country and decorous. She never
spoke unless she was spoken to.</p>
<p>Sometimes she was sick and stayed in bed. Eliza took her food
then, and was extremely kind to her.</p>
<p>Day after day the girl rocked back and forth, all through the
stormy autumn. Eugene could hear her large feet as rhythmically
they hit the floor, ceaselessly propelling the rocker. Her name
was Mrs. Morgan.</p>
<p>One day as he laid large crackling lumps upon the piled
glowing mass of coals, Eliza entered the room. Mrs. Morgan rocked
away stolidly. Eliza stood by the fire for a moment, pursing her
lips reflectively, and folding her hands quietly upon her
stomach. She looked out the window at the stormy sky, the swept
windy bareness of the street.</p>
<p>"I tell you what," she said, "it looks like a hard winter for
the poor folks."</p>
<p>"Yes'm," said Mrs. Morgan sullenly. She kept on rocking.</p>
<p>Eliza was silent a moment longer.</p>
<p>"Where's your husband?" she asked presently.</p>
<p>"In Sevier," Mrs. Morgan said. "He's a railroad man."</p>
<p>"What's that, what's that?" said Eliza quickly, comically. "A
railroad man, you say?" she inquired sharply.</p>
<p>"Yes'm."</p>
<p>"Well, it looks mighty funny to me he hasn't been in to see
you," said Eliza, with enormous accusing tranquillity. "I'd call
it a pretty poor sort of man who'd act like that."</p>
<p>Mrs. Morgan said nothing. Her tar-black eyes glittered in
fireflame.</p>
<p>"Have you got any money?" said Eliza.</p>
<p>"No'm," said Mrs. Morgan.</p>
<p>Eliza stood solidly, enjoying the warmth, pursing her lips.
"When do you expect to have your baby?" said Eliza suddenly.</p>
<p>Mrs. Morgan said nothing for a moment. She kept on
rocking.</p>
<p>"In less'n a month now, I reckon," she answered.</p>
<p>She had been getting bigger week after week.</p>
<p>Eliza bent over and pulled her skirt up, revealing her leg to
the knee, cotton-stockinged and lumpily wadded over with her
heavy flannels.</p>
<p>"Whew!" she cried out coyly, noticing that Eugene was staring.
"Turn your head, boy," she commanded, snickering and rubbing her
finger along her nose. The dull green of rolled banknotes shone
through her stockings. She pulled the bills out.</p>
<p>"Well, I reckon you'll have to have a little money," said
Eliza, peeling off two tens, and giving them to Mrs. Morgan.</p>
<p>"Thank you, ma'am," said Mrs. Morgan, taking the money.</p>
<p>"You can stay here until you're able to work again," said
Eliza. "I know a good doctor."</p>
<p>"Mama, in heaven's name," Helen fumed. "Where on earth do you
get these people?"</p>
<p>"Merciful God!" howled Gant, "you've had 'em all&mdash;blind,
lame, crazy, chippies and bastards. They all come here."</p>
<p>Nevertheless, when he saw Mrs. Morgan now, he always made a
profound bow, saying with the most florid courtesy:</p>
<p>"How do you do, madam?" Aside, to Helen, he said:</p>
<p>"I tell you what&mdash;she's a fine-looking girl."</p>
<p>"Hahahaha," said Helen, laughing in an ironic falsetto, and
prodding him, "you wouldn't mind having her yourself, would
you?"</p>
<p>"B'God," he said humorously, wetting his thumb, and grinning
slyly at Eliza, "she's got a pair of pippins."</p>
<p>Eliza smiled bitterly into popping grease.</p>
<p>"Hm!" she said disdainfully. "I don't care how many he goes
with. There's no fool like an old fool. You'd better not be too
smart. That's a game two can play at."</p>
<p>"Hahahahaha!" laughed Helen thinly, "she's mad now."</p>
<p>Helen took Mrs. Morgan often to Gant's and cooked great meals
for her. She also brought her presents of candy and scented soap
from town.</p>
<p>They called in McGuire at the birth of the child. From below
Eugene heard the quiet commotion in the upstairs room, the low
moans of the woman, and finally a high piercing wail. Eliza,
greatly excited, kept kettles seething with hot water constantly
over the gas flames of the stove. From time to time she rushed
upstairs with a boiling kettle, descending a moment later more
slowly, pausing from step to step while she listened attentively
to the sounds in the room.</p>
<p>"After all," said Helen, banging kettles about restlessly in
the kitchen, "what do we know about her? Nobody can say she
hasn't got a husband, can they? They'd better be careful! People
have no right to say those things," she cried out irritably
against unknown detractors.</p>
<p>It was night. Eugene went out on to the veranda. The air was
frosty, clear, not very cool. Above the black bulk of the eastern
hills, and in the great bowl of the sky, far bright stars were
scintillant as jewels. The light burned brightly in neighborhood
houses, as bright and as hard as if carved from some cold gem.
Across the wide yard-spaces wafted the warm odor of hamburger
steak and fried onions. Ben stood at the veranda rail, leaning
upon his cocked leg, smoking with deep lung inhalations. Eugene
went over and stood by him. They heard the wail upstairs. Eugene
snickered, looking up at the thin ivory mask. Ben lifted his
white hand sharply to strike him, but dropped it with a growl of
contempt, smiling faintly. Far before them, on the top of
Birdseye, faint lights wavered in the rich Jew's castle. In the
neighborhood there was a slight mist of supper, and frost-far
voices.</p>
<p>Deep womb, dark flower. The Hidden. The secret fruit,
heart-red, fed by rich Indian blood. Womb-night brooding darkness
flowering secretly into life.</p>
<p>Mrs. Morgan went away two weeks after her child was born. He
was a little brown-skinned boy, with a tuft of elvish black hair,
and very black bright eyes. He was like a little Indian. Before
she left Eliza gave her twenty dollars.</p>
<p>"Where are you going?" she asked.</p>
<p>"I've got folks in Sevier," said Mrs. Morgan.</p>
<p>She went up the street carrying a cheap imitation-crocodile
valise. At her shoulder the baby waggled his head, and looked
merrily back with his bright black eyes. Eliza waved to him and
smiled tremulously; she turned back into the house sniffling,
with wet eyes.</p>
<p>Why did she come to Dixieland, I wonder? Eugene thought.</p>
<p>Eliza was good to a little man with a mustache. He had a wife
and a little girl nine years old. He was a hotel steward; he was
out of work and he stayed at Dixieland until he owed her more
than one hundred dollars. But he split kindling neatly, and
carried up coal; he did handy jobs of carpentry, and painted up
rusty places about the house.</p>
<p>She was very fond of him; he was what she called "a good
family man." She liked domestic people; she liked men who were
house- broken. The little man was very kind and very tame. Eugene
liked him because he made good coffee. Eliza never bothered him
about the money. Finally, he got work at the Inn, and quarters
there. He paid Eliza all he owed her.</p>
<p>Eugene stayed late at the school, returning in the afternoon
at three or four o'clock. Sometimes it was almost dark when he
came back to Dixieland. Eliza was fretful at his absences, and
brought him his dinner crisped and dried from its long heating in
the oven. There was a heavy vegetable soup thickly glutinous with
cabbage, beans, and tomatoes, and covered on top with big grease
blisters. There would also be warmed-over beef, pork or chicken,
a dish full of cold lima beans, biscuits, slaw, and coffee.</p>
<p>But the school had become the centre of his heart and
life&mdash;Margaret Leonard his spiritual mother. He liked to be
there most in the afternoons when the crowd of boys had gone, and
when he was free to wander about the old house, under the singing
majesty of great trees, exultant in the proud solitude of that
fine hill, the clean windy rain of the acorns, the tang of
burning leaves. He would read wolfishly until Margaret discovered
him and drove him out under the trees or toward the flat court
behind Bishop Raper's residence at the entrance, which was used
for basketball. Here, while the western sky reddened, he raced
down toward the goal, passing the ball to a companion, exulting
in his growing swiftness, agility, and expertness in shooting the
basket.</p>
<p>Margaret Leonard watched his health jealously, almost
morbidly, warning him constantly of the terrible consequences
that followed physical depletion, the years required to build
back what had once been thrown carelessly away.</p>
<p>"Look here, boy!" she would begin, stopping him in a quiet
boding voice. "Come in here a minute. I want to talk to you."</p>
<p>Somewhat frightened, extremely nervous, he would sit down
beside her.</p>
<p>"How much sleep have you been getting?" she asked.</p>
<p>Hopefully, he said nine hours a night. That should be about
right.</p>
<p>"Well, make it ten," she commanded sternly. "See here, 'Gene,
you simply can't afford to take chances with your health. Lordy,
boy, I know what I'm talking about. I've had to pay the price, I
tell you. You can't do anything in this world without your
health, boy."</p>
<p>"But I'm all right," he protested desperately, frightened.
"There's nothing wrong with me."</p>
<p>"You're not strong, boy. You've got to get some meat on your
bones. I tell you what, I'm worried by those circles under your
eyes. Do you keep regular hours?"</p>
<p>He did not: he hated regular hours. The excitement, the
movement, the constant moments of crisis at Gant's and Eliza's
had him keyed to their stimulation. The order and convention of
domestic life he had never known. He was desperately afraid of
regularity. It meant dullness and inanition to him. He loved the
hour of midnight.</p>
<p>But obediently he promised her that he would be
regular&mdash;regular in eating, sleeping, studying, and
exercising.</p>
<p>But he had not yet learned to play with the crowd. He still
feared, disliked and distrusted them.</p>
<p>He shrank from the physical conflict of boy life, but knowing
her eye was upon him he plunged desperately into their games, his
frail strength buffeted in the rush of strong legs, the heavy jar
of strong bodies, picking himself up bruised and sore at heart to
follow and join again the mill of the burly pack. Day after day
to the ache of his body was added the ache and shame of his
spirit, but he hung on with a pallid smile across his lips, and
envy and fear of their strength in his heart. He parroted
faithfully all that John Dorsey had to say about the "spirit of
fair play," "sportsmanship," "playing the game for the game's
sake," "accepting defeat or victory with a smile," and so on, but
he had no genuine belief or understanding. These phrases were
current among all the boys at the school&mdash;they had been made
somewhat too conscious of them and, as he listened, at times the
old, inexplicable shame returned&mdash;he craned his neck and
drew one foot sharply off the ground.</p>
<p>And Eugene noted, with the old baffling shame again, as this
cheap tableau of self-conscious, robust, and raucously aggressive
boyhood was posed, that, for all the mouthing of phrases, the
jargon about fair play and sportsmanship, the weaker, at
Leonard's, was the legitimate prey of the stronger. Leonard,
beaten by a boy in a play of wits, or in an argument for justice,
would assert the righteousness of his cause by physical violence.
These spectacles were ugly and revolting: Eugene watched them
with sick fascination.</p>
<p>Leonard himself was not a bad man&mdash;he was a man of
considerable character, kindliness, and honest determination. He
loved his family, he stood up with some courage against the
bigotry in the Methodist church, where he was a deacon, and at
length had to withdraw because of his remarks on Darwin's theory.
He was, thus, an example of that sad liberalism of the
village&mdash;an advanced thinker among the Methodists, a bearer
of the torch at noon, an apologist for the toleration of ideas
that have been established for fifty years. He tried faithfully
to do his duties as a teacher. But he was of the earth&mdash;even
his heavy-handed violence was of the earth, and had in it the
unconscious brutality of nature. Although he asserted his
interest in "the things of the mind," his interest in the soil
was much greater, and he had added little to his stock of
information since leaving college. He was slow-witted and quite
lacking in the sensitive intuitions of Margaret, who loved the
man with such passionate fidelity, however, that she seconded all
his acts before the world. Eugene had even heard her cry out in a
shrill, trembling voice against a student who had answered her
husband insolently: "Why, I'd slap his head off! That's what I'd
do!" And the boy had trembled, with fear and nausea, to see her
so. But thus, he knew, could love change one. Leonard thought his
actions wise and good: he had grown up in a tradition that
demanded strict obedience to the master, and that would not brook
opposition to his rulings. He had learned from his father, a
Tennessee patriarch who ran a farm, preached on Sundays, and put
down rebellion in his family with a horse-whip and pious prayers,
the advantages of being God! He thought little boys who resisted
him should be beaten.</p>
<p>Upon the sons of his wealthiest and most prominent clients, as
well as upon his own children, Leonard was careful to inflict no
chastisement, and these young men, arrogantly conscious of their
immunity, were studious in their insolence and disobedience. The
son of the Bishop, Justin Raper, a tall thin boy of thirteen,
with black hair, a thin dark bumpy face, and absurdly petulant
lips, typed copies of a dirty ballad and sold them among the
students at five cents a copy.</p>
<blockquote>"Madam, your daughter looks very fine,<br>
Slapoon!<br>
Madam, your daughter looks very fine,<br>
Slapoon!"</blockquote>
<p>Moreover, Leonard surprised this youth one afternoon in Spring
on the eastern flank of the hill, in the thick grass beneath a
flowering dogwood, united in sexual congress with Miss Hazel
Bradley, the daughter of a small grocer who lived below on
Biltburn Avenue, and whose lewdness was already advertised in the
town. Leonard, on second thought, did not go to the Bishop. He
went to the Grocer.</p>
<p>"Well," said Mr. Bradley, brushing his long mustache
reflectively away from his mouth, "you ought to put up a
no-trespassin' sign."</p>
<p>The target of concentrated abuse, both for John Dorsey and the
boys, was the son of a Jew. The boy's name was Edward Michalove.
His father was a jeweller, a man with a dark, gentle floridity of
manner and complexion. He had white delicate fingers. His
counters were filled with old brooches, gemmed buckles, ancient
incrusted watches. The boy had two sisters&mdash;large handsome
women. His mother was dead. None of them looked Jewish: they all
had a soft dark fluescence of appearance.</p>
<p>At twelve, he was a tall slender lad, with dark amber
features, and the mincing effeminacy of an old maid. He was
terrified in the company of other boys, all that was sharp,
spinsterly, and venomous, would come protectively to the surface
when he was ridiculed or threatened, and he would burst into
shrill unpleasant laughter, or hysterical tears. His mincing
walk, with the constant gesture of catching maidenly at the
fringe of his coat as he walked along, his high husky voice, with
a voluptuous and feminine current playing through it, drew upon
him at once the terrible battery of their dislike.</p>
<p>They called him "Miss" Michalove; they badgered him into a
state of constant hysteria, until he became an unpleasant
snarling little cat, holding up his small clawed hands to scratch
them with his long nails whenever they approached; they made him
detestable, master and boys alike, and they hated him for what
they made of him.</p>
<p>Sobbing one day when he had been kept in after school hours,
he leaped up and rushed suddenly for the doors. Leonard,
breathing stertorously, pounded awkwardly after him, and returned
in a moment dragging the screaming boy along by the collar.</p>
<p>"Sit down!" yelled John Dorsey, hurling him into a desk. Then,
his boiling fury unappeased, and baffled by fear of inflicting
some crippling punishment on the boy, he added illogically:
"Stand up!" and jerked him to his feet again.</p>
<p>"You young upstart!" he panted. "You little two-by-two
whippersnapper! We'll just see, my sonny, if I'm to be dictated
to by the like of you."</p>
<p>"Take your hands off me!" Edward screamed, in an agony of
physical loathing. "I'll tell my father on you, old man Leonard,
and he'll come down here and kick your big fat behind all over
the lot. See if he don't."</p>
<p>Eugene closed his eyes, unable to witness the snuffing out of
a young life. He was cold and sick about his heart. But when he
opened his eyes again Edward, flushed and sobbing, was standing
where he stood. Nothing had happened.</p>
<p>Eugene waited for God's visitation upon the unhappy
blasphemer. He gathered, from the slightly open paralysis that
had frozen John Dorsey's and Sister Amy's face, that they were
waiting too.</p>
<p>Edward lived. There was nothing beyond this&mdash;nothing.</p>
<p>Eugene thought of this young Jew years later with the old
piercing shame, with the riving pain by which a man recalls the
irrevocable moment of some cowardly or dishonorable act. For not
only did he join in the persecution of the boy&mdash;he was also
glad at heart because of the existence of some one weaker than
himself, some one at whom the flood of ridicule might be
directed. Years later it came to him that on the narrow shoulders
of that Jew lay a burden he might otherwise have borne, that that
overladen heart was swollen with a misery that might have been
his.</p>
<p>Mr. Leonard's "men of to-morrow" were doing nicely. The spirit
of justice, of physical honor was almost unknown to them, but
they were loud in proclaiming the letter. Each of them lived in a
fear of discovery; each of them who was able built up his own
defenses of swagger, pretense, and loud assertion&mdash;the great
masculine flower of gentleness, courage, and honor died in a foul
tangle. The great clan of go-getter was emergent in young
boys&mdash;big in voice, violent in threat, withered and pale at
heart&mdash;the "He-men" were on the rails.</p>
<p>And Eugene, encysted now completely behind the walls of his
fantasy, hurled his physical body daily to defeat, imitated, as
best he could, the speech, gesture, and bearing of his fellows,
joined, by act or spirit, in the attack on those weaker than
himself, and was compensated sometimes for his bruises when he
heard Margaret say that he was "a boy with a fine spirit." She
said it very often.</p>
<p>He was, fortunately, thanks to Gant and Eliza, a creature that
was dominantly masculine in its sex, but in all his life, either
at home or in school, he had seldom known victory. Fear he knew
well. And so incessant, it seemed to him later, had been this
tyranny of strength, that in his young wild twenties when his
great boneframe was powerfully fleshed at last, and he heard
about him the loud voices, the violent assertion, the empty
threat, memory would waken in him a maniacal anger, and he would
hurl the insolent intruding swaggerer from his path, thrust back
the jostler, glare insanely into fearful surprised faces and
curse them.</p>
<p>He never forgot the Jew; he always thought of him with shame.
But it was many years before he could understand that that
sensitive and feminine person, bound to him by the secret and
terrible bonds of his own dishonor, had in him nothing perverse,
nothing unnatural, nothing degenerate. He was as much like a
woman as a man. That was all. There is no place among the Boy
Scouts for the androgyne&mdash;it must go to Parnassus.</p>
<h3>18</h3>
<p>In the years that had followed Eliza's removal to Dixieland,
by a slow inexorable chemistry of union and repellence, profound
changes had occurred in the alignment of the Gants. Eugene had
passed away from Helen's earlier guardianship into the keeping of
Ben. This separation was inevitable. The great affection she had
shown him when he was a young child was based not on any deep
kinship of mind or body or spirit, but on her vast maternal
feeling, something that poured from her in a cataract of
tenderness and cruelty upon young, weak, plastic life.</p>
<p>The time had passed when she could tousle him on the bed in a
smother of slaps and kisses, crushing him, stroking him, biting
and kissing his young flesh. He was not so attractive
physically&mdash;he had lost the round contours of infancy, he
had grown up like a weed, his limbs were long and gangling, his
feet large, his shoulders bony, and his head too big and heavy
for the scrawny neck on which it sagged forward. Moreover, he
sank deeper year by year into the secret life, a strange wild
thing bloomed darkly in his face, and when she spoke to him his
eyes were filled with the shadows of great ships and cities.</p>
<p>And this secret life, which she could never touch, and which
she could never understand, choked her with fury. It was
necessary for her to seize life in her big red-knuckled hands, to
cuff and caress it, to fondle, love, and enslave it. Her boiling
energy rushed outward on all things that lived in the touch of
the sun. It was necessary for her to dominate and enslave, all
her virtues&mdash;her strong lust to serve, to give, to nurse, to
amuse&mdash;came from the imperative need for dominance over
almost all she touched.</p>
<p>She was herself ungovernable; she disliked whatever did not
yield to her governance. In his loneliness he would have yielded
his spirit into bondage willingly if in exchange he might have
had her love which so strangely he had forfeited, but he was
unable to reveal to her the flowering ecstasies, the dark and
incommunicable fantasies in which his life was bound. She hated
secrecy; an air of mystery, a crafty but knowing reticence, or
the unfathomable depths of other-wordliness goaded her to
fury.</p>
<p>Convulsed by a momentary rush of hatred, she would caricature
the pout of his lips, the droop of his head, his bounding
kangaroo walk.</p>
<p>"You little freak. You nasty little freak. You don't even know
who you are&mdash;you little bastard. You're not a Gant. Any one
can see that. You haven't a drop of papa's blood in you. Queer
one! Queer one! You're Greeley Pentland all over again."</p>
<p>She always returned to this&mdash;she was fanatically
partisan, her hysterical superstition had already lined the
family in embattled groups of those who were Gant and those who
were Pentland. On the Pentland side, she placed Steve, Daisy, and
Eugene&mdash;they were, she thought, the "cold and selfish ones,"
and the implication of the older sister and the younger brother
with the criminal member of the family gave her an added
pleasure. Her union with Luke was now inseparable. It had been
inevitable. They were the Gants&mdash;those who were generous,
fine, and honorable.</p>
<p>The love of Luke and Helen was epic. They found in each other
the constant effervescence, the boundless extraversion, the
richness, the loudness, the desperate need to give and to serve
that was life to them. They exacerbated the nerves of each other,
but their love was beyond grievance, and their songs of praise
were extravagant.</p>
<p>"I'll criticise him if I like," she said pugnaciously. "I've
got the right to. But I won't hear any one else criticise him.
He's a fine generous boy&mdash;the finest one in this family.
That's one thing sure."</p>
<p>Ben alone seemed to be without the grouping. He moved among
them like a shadow&mdash;he was remote from their passionate
fullblooded partisanship. But she thought of him as
"generous"&mdash;he was, she concluded, a "Gant."</p>
<p>In spite of this violent dislike for the Pentlands, both Helen
and Luke had inherited all Gant's social hypocrisy. They wanted
above all else to put a good face on before the world, to be well
liked and to have many friends. They were profuse in their
thanks, extravagant in their praise, cloying in their flattery.
They slathered it on. They kept their ill-temper, their
nervousness, and their irritability for exhibition at home. And
in the presence of any members of Jim or Will Pentland's family
their manner was not only friendly, it was even touched slightly
with servility. Money impressed them.</p>
<p>It was a period of incessant movement in the family. Steve had
married a year or two before a woman from a small town in lower
Indiana. She was thirty-seven years old, twelve years his senior,
a squat heavy German with a big nose and a patient and ugly face.
She had come to Dixieland one summer with another woman, a
spinster of lifelong acquaintance, and allowed him to seduce her
before she left. The winter following, her father, a small
manufacturer of cigars, had died, leaving her $9,000 in
insurance, his home, a small sum of money in the bank, and a
quarter share in his business, which was left to the management
of his two sons.</p>
<p>Early in Spring the woman, whose name was Margaret Lutz,
returned to Dixieland. One drowsy afternoon Eugene found them at
Gant's. The house was deserted save for them. They were sprawled
out face downward, with their hands across each other's hips, on
Gant's bed. They lay there silently, while he looked, in an ugly
stupor. Steve's yellow odor filled the room. Eugene began to
tremble with insane fury. The Spring was warm and lovely, the air
brooded slightly in a flowering breeze, there was a smell of soft
tar. He had come down to the empty house exultantly, tasting its
delicious silence, the cool mustiness of indoors, and a solitary
afternoon with great calf volumes. In a moment the world turned
hag.</p>
<p>There was nothing that Steve touched that he did not
taint.</p>
<p>Eugene hated him because he stunk, because all that he touched
stunk, because he brought fear, shame, and loathing wherever he
went; because his kisses were fouler than his curses, his whines
nastier than his threats. He saw the woman's hair blown gently by
the blubbered exhalations of his brother's foul breath.</p>
<p>"What are you doing there on papa's bed?" he screamed.</p>
<p>Steve rose stupidly and seized him by the arm. The woman sat
up, dopily staring, her short legs widened.</p>
<p>"I suppose you're going to be a little Tattle-tale," said
Steve, bludgeoning him with heavy contempt. "You're going to run
right up and tell mama, aren't you?" he said. He fastened his
yellow fingers on Eugene's arm.</p>
<p>"Get off papa's bed," said Eugene desperately. He jerked his
arm away.</p>
<p>"You're not going to tell on us, buddy, are you?" Steve
wheedled, breathing pollution in his face.</p>
<p>He grew sick.</p>
<p>"Let me go," he muttered. "No."</p>
<p>Steve and Margaret were married soon after. With the old sense
of physical shame Eugene watched them descend the stairs at
Dixieland each morning for breakfast. Steve swaggered absurdly,
smiled complacently, and hinted at great fortune about the town.
There was rumor of a quarter-million.</p>
<p>"Put it there, Steve," said Harry Tugman, slapping him
powerfully upon the shoulder. "By God, I always said you'd get
there."</p>
<p>Eliza smiled at swagger and boast, her proud, pleased,
tremulous sad smile. The first-born.</p>
<p>"Little Stevie doesn't have to worry any longer," said he.
"He's on Easy Street. Where are all the Wise Guys now who said 'I
told you so'? They're all mighty glad to give Little Stevie a Big
Smile and the Glad Hand when he breezes down the street. Every
Knocker is a Booster now all right, all right."</p>
<p>"I tell you what," said Eliza with proud smiles, "he's no
fool. He's as bright as the next one when he wants to be."
Brighter, she thought.</p>
<p>Steve bought new clothes, tan shoes, striped silk shirts, and
a wide straw hat with a red, white and blue band. He swung his
shoulders in a wide arc as he walked, snapped his fingers
nonchalantly, and smiled with elaborate condescension on those
who greeted him. Helen was vastly annoyed and amused; she had to
laugh at his absurd strut, and she had a great rush of feeling
for Margaret Lutz. She called her "honey," felt her eyes mist
warmly with unaccountable tears as she looked into the patient,
bewildered, and slightly frightened face of the German woman. She
took her in her arms and fondled her.</p>
<p>"That's all right, honey," she said, "you let us know if he
doesn't treat you right. We'll fix him."</p>
<p>"Steve's a good boy," said Margaret, "when he isn't drinking.
I've nothing to say against him when he's sober." She burst into
tears.</p>
<p>"That awful, that awful curse," said Eliza, shaking her head
sadly, "the curse of licker. It's been responsible for the
ruination of more homes than anything else."</p>
<p>"Well, she'll never win any beauty prizes, that's one thing
sure," said Helen privately to Eliza.</p>
<p>"I'll vow!" said Eliza.</p>
<p>"What on earth did he mean by doing such a thing!" she
continued. "She's ten years older than he if she's a day."</p>
<p>"I think he's done pretty well, if you ask me," said Helen,
annoyed. "Good heavens, mama! You talk as if he's some sort of
prize. Every one in town knows what Steve is." She laughed
ironically and angrily. "No, indeed! He got the best of the
bargain. Margaret's a decent girl."</p>
<p>"Well," said Eliza hopefully, "maybe he's going to brace up
now and make a new start. He's promised that he'd try."</p>
<p>"Well, I should hope so," said Helen scathingly. "I should
hope so. It's about time."</p>
<p>Her dislike for him was innate. She had placed him among the
tribe of the Pentlands. But he was really more like Gant than any
one else. He was like Gant in all his weakness, with none of his
cleanliness, his lean fibre, his remorse. In her heart she knew
this and it increased her dislike for him. She shared in the
fierce antagonism Gant felt toward his son. But her feeling was
broken, as was all her feeling, by moments of friendliness,
charity, tolerance.</p>
<p>"What are you going to do, Steve?" she asked. "You've got a
family now, you know."</p>
<p>"Little Stevie doesn't have to worry any longer," he said,
smiling easily. "He lets the others do the worrying." He lifted
his yellow fingers to his mouth, drawing deeply at a
cigarette.</p>
<p>"Good heavens, Steve," she burst out angrily. "Pull yourself
together and try to be a man for once. Margaret's a woman. You
surely don't expect her to keep you up, do you?"</p>
<p>"What business is that of yours, for Christ's sake?" he said
in a high ugly voice. "Nobody's asked your advice, have they? All
of you are against me. None of you had a good word for me when I
was down and out, and now it gets your goat to see me make good."
He had believed for years that he was persecuted&mdash;his
failure at home he attributed to the malice, envy, and disloyalty
of his family, his failure abroad to the malice and envy of an
opposing force that he called "the world."</p>
<p>"No," he said, taking another long puff at the moist
cigarette, "don't worry about Stevie. He doesn't need anything
from any of you, and you don't hear him asking for anything. You
see that, don't you?" he said, pulling a roll of banknotes from
his pocket and peeling off a few twenties. "Well, there's lots
more where that came from. And I'll tell you something else:
Little Stevie will be right up there among the Big Boys soon.
He's got a couple of deals coming off that'll show the pikers in
this town where to get off. You get that, don't you?" he
said.</p>
<p>Ben, who had been sitting on the piano stool all this time,
scowling savagely at the keys, and humming a little recurrent
tune to himself while he picked it out with one finger, turned
now to Helen, with a sharp flicker of his mouth, and jerked his
head sideways.</p>
<p>"I hear Mr. Vanderbilt's getting jealous," he said.</p>
<p>Helen laughed ironically, huskily.</p>
<p>"You think you're a pretty wise guy, don't you?" said Steve
heavily. "But I don't notice it's getting you anywhere."</p>
<p>Ben turned his scowling eyes upon him, and sniffed sharply,
unconsciously.</p>
<p>"Now, I hope you're not going to forget your old friends, Mr.
Rockefeller," he said in his subdued, caressing ominous voice.
"I'd like to be vice-president if the job's still open." He
turned back to the keyboard&mdash;and searched with a hooked
finger.</p>
<p>"All right, all right," said Steve. "Go ahead and laugh, both
of you, if you think it's funny. But you notice that Little
Stevie isn't a fifteen-dollar clerk in a newspaper office, don't
you? And he doesn't have to sing in moving-picture shows,
either," he added.</p>
<p>Helen's big-boned face reddened angrily. She had begun to sing
in public with the saddlemaker's daughter.</p>
<p>"You'd better not talk, Steve, until you get a job and quit
bumming around," she said. "You're a fine one to talk, hanging
around pool-rooms and drug-stores all day on your wife's money.
Why, it's absurd!" she said furiously.</p>
<p>"Oh for God's sake!" Ben cried irritably, wheeling around.
"What do you want to listen to him for? Can't you see he's
crazy?"</p>
<p>As the summer lengthened, Steve began to drink heavily again.
His decayed teeth, neglected for years, began to ache
simultaneously: he was wild with pain and cheap whisky. He felt
that Eliza and Margaret were in some way responsible for his
woe&mdash;he sought them out day after day when they were alone,
and screamed at them. He called them foul names and said they had
poisoned his system.</p>
<p>In the early hours of morning, at two or three o'clock, he
would waken, and walk through the house weeping and entreating
release. Eliza would send him to Spaugh at the hotel or to
McGuire, at his residence, in Eugene's charge. The doctors, surly
and half-awake, peeled back his shirtsleeve and drove a needle
with morphine deep in his upper arm. After that, he found relief
and sleep again.</p>
<p>One night, at the supper hour, he returned to Dixieland,
holding his tortured jaws between his hands. He found Eliza
bending over the spitting grease of the red-hot stove. He cursed
her for bearing him, he cursed her for allowing him to have
teeth, he cursed her for lack of sympathy, motherly love, human
kindliness.</p>
<p>Her white face worked silently above the heat.</p>
<p>"Get out of here," she said. "You don't know what you're
talking about. It's that accursed licker that makes you so mean."
She began to weep, brushing at her broad red nose with her
hand.</p>
<p>"I never thought I'd live to hear such talk from a son of
mine," she said. She held out her forefinger with the old
powerful gesture.</p>
<p>"Now, I want to tell you," she said, "I'm not going to put up
with you any longer. If you don't get out of here at once I'm
going to call 38 and let them take you." This was the police
station. It awoke unpleasant memories. He had spent the day in
jail on two similar occasions. He became more violent than
before, screamed a vile name at her, and made a motion to strike
her. At this moment, Luke entered; he was on his way to
Gant's.</p>
<p>The antagonism between the boy and his older brother was deep
and deadly. It had lasted for years. Now, trembling with anger,
Luke came to his mother's defense.</p>
<p>"You m-m-m-miserable d-d-degenerate," he stuttered,
unconsciously falling into the swing of the Gantian rhetoric.
"You ought to b-b- b-be horsewhipped."</p>
<p>He was a well grown and muscular young fellow of nineteen
years, but too sensitive to all the taboos of brotherhood to be
prepared for the attack Steve made on him. Steve drove at him
viciously, smashing drunkenly at his face with both hands. He was
driven gasping and blinded across the kitchen.</p>
<p>Wrong forever on the throne.</p>
<p>Somewhere, through fear and fury, Eugene heard Ben's voice
humming unconcernedly, and the slow picked tune on the piano.</p>
<p>"Ben!" he screamed, dancing about and grasping a hammer.</p>
<p>Ben entered like a cat. Luke was bleeding warmly from the
nose.</p>
<p>"Come on, come on, you big bastard," said Steve, exalted by
his success, throwing himself into a fancy boxing posture. "I'll
take you on now. You haven't got a chance, Ben," he continued,
with elaborate pity. "You haven't got a chance, boy. I'll tear
your head off with what I know."</p>
<p>Ben scowled quietly at him for a moment while he pranced
softly about, proposing his fists in Police Gazette attitudes.
Then, exploding suddenly in maniacal anger, the quiet one sprang
upon the amateur pugilist with one bound, and flattened him with
a single blow of his fist. Steve's head bounced upon the floor in
a most comforting fashion. Eugene gave a loud shriek of ecstasy
and danced about, insane with joy, while Ben, making little
snarling noises in his throat, leaped on his brother's prostrate
body and thumped his bruised skull upon the boards. There was a
beautiful thoroughness about his wakened anger&mdash;it never
made inquiries till later.</p>
<p>"Good old Ben," screamed Eugene, howling with insane laughter.
"Good old Ben."</p>
<p>Eliza, who had been calling out loudly for help, the police,
and the interference of the general public, now succeeded, with
Luke's assistance, in checking Ben's assault, and pulling him up
from his dazed victim. She wept bitterly, her heart laden with
pain and sadness, while Luke, forgetful of his bloody nose,
sorrowful and full of shame only because brother had struck
brother, assisted Steve to his feet and brushed him off.</p>
<p>A terrible shame started up in each of them&mdash;they were
unable to meet one another's gaze. Ben's thin face was very
white; he trembled violently and, catching sight of Steve's
bleared eyes for a moment, he made a retching noise in his
throat, went over to the sink, and drank a glass of cold
water.</p>
<p>"A house divided against itself cannot stand," Eliza wept.</p>
<p>Helen came in from town with a bag of warm bread and
cakes.</p>
<p>"What's the matter?" she said, noting at once all that had
happened.</p>
<p>"I don't know," said Eliza, her face working, shaking her head
for several moments before she spoke. "It seems that the judgment
of God is against us. There's been nothing but misery all my
life. All I want is a little peace." She wept softly, wiping her
weak bleared eyes with the back of her hand.</p>
<p>"Well, forget about it," said Helen quietly. Her voice was
casual, weary, sad. "How do you feel, Steve?" she asked.</p>
<p>"I wouldn't make any trouble for any one, Helen," he said,
with a maudlin whimper. "No! No!" he continued in a brooding
voice. "They've never given Steve a chance. They're all down on
him. They jumped on me, Helen. My own brothers jumped on me, sick
as I am, and beat me up. It's all right. I'm going away somewhere
and try to forget. Stevie doesn't hold any grudge against any
one. He's not built that way. Give me your hand, buddy," he said,
turning to Ben with nauseous sentimentality and extending his
yellow fingers, "I'm willing to shake your hand. You hit me to-
night, but Steve's willing to forget."</p>
<p>"Oh my God," said Ben, grasping his stomach. He leaned weakly
across the sink and drank another glass of water.</p>
<p>"No. No." Steve began again. "Stevie isn't built&mdash;"</p>
<p>He would have continued indefinitely in this strain, but Helen
checked him with weary finality.</p>
<p>"Well, forget about it," she said, "all of you. Life's too
short."</p>
<p>Life was. At these moments, after battle, after all the
confusion, antagonism, and disorder of their lives had exploded
in a moment of strife, they gained an hour of repose in which
they saw themselves with sad tranquillity. They were like men
who, driving forward desperately at some mirage, turn, for a
moment, to see their footprints stretching interminably away
across the waste land of the desert; or I should say, they were
like those who have been mad, and who will be mad again, but who
see themselves for a moment quietly, sanely, at morning, looking
with sad untroubled eyes into a mirror.</p>
<p>Their faces were sad. There was great age in them. They felt
suddenly the distance they had come and the amount they had
lived. They had a moment of cohesion, a moment of tragic
affection and union, which drew them together like small jets of
flame against all the senseless nihilism of life.</p>
<p>Margaret came in fearfully. Her eyes were red, her broad
German face white and tearful. A group of excited boarders
whispered in the hall.</p>
<p>"I'll lose them all now," Eliza fretted. "The last time three
left. Over twenty dollars a week and money so hard to get. I
don't know what's to become of us all." She wept again.</p>
<p>"Oh, for heaven's sake," said Helen impatiently. "Forget about
the boarders once in a while."</p>
<p>Steve sank stupidly into a chair by the long table. From time
to time he muttered sentimentally to himself. Luke, his face
sensitive, hurt, ashamed around his mouth, stood by him
attentively, spoke gently to him, and brought him a glass of
water.</p>
<p>"Give him a cup of coffee, mama," Helen cried irritably. "For
heaven's sake, you might do a little for him."</p>
<p>"Why here, here," said Eliza, rushing awkwardly to the gas
range and lighting a burner. "I never thought&mdash;I'll have
some in a minute."</p>
<p>Margaret sat in a chair on the other side of the disorderly
table, leaning her face in her hand and weeping. Her tears
dredged little gulches through the thick compost of rouge and
powder with which she coated her rough skin.</p>
<p>"Cheer up, honey," said Helen, beginning to laugh. "Christmas
is coming." She patted the broad German back comfortingly.</p>
<p>Ben opened the torn screen door and stepped out on the back
porch. It was a cool night in the rich month of August; the sky
was deeply pricked with great stars. He lighted a cigarette,
holding the match with white trembling fingers. There were faint
sounds from summer porches, the laughter of women, a distant
throb of music at a dance. Eugene went and stood beside him: he
looked up at him with wonder, exultancy, and with sadness. He
prodded him half with fear, half with joy.</p>
<p>Ben snarled softly at him, made a sudden motion to strike him,
but stopped. A swift light flickered across his mouth. He
smoked.</p>
<p>Steve went away with the German woman to Indiana, where, at
first, came news of opulence, fatness, ease, and furs (with
photographs), later of brawls with her honest brothers, and talk
of divorce, reunion and renascence. He gravitated between the two
poles of his support, Margaret and Eliza, returning to Altamont
every summer for a period of drugs and drunkenness that ended in
a family fight, jail, and a hospital cure.</p>
<p>"Hell commences," howled Gant, "as soon as he comes home. He's
a curse and a care, the lowest of the low, the vilest of the
vile. Woman, you have given birth to a monster who will not rest
until he has done me to death, fearful, cruel, and accursed
reprobate that he is!"</p>
<p>But Eliza wrote her oldest son regularly, enclosed sums of
money from time to time, and revived her hopes incessantly,
against nature, against reason, against the structure of life.
She did not dare to come openly to his defense, to reveal frankly
the place he held in her heart's core, but she would produce each
letter in which he spoke boastfully of his successes, or
announced his monthly resurrection, and read them to an unmoved
family. They were florid, foolish letters, full of quotation
marks and written in a large fancy hand. She was proud and
pleased at all their extravagances; his flowery illiteracy was
another proof to her of his superior intelligence.</p>
<p>Dear Mama:</p>
<p>Yours of the 11th to hand and must say I was glad to know you
were in "the land of the living" again as I had begun to feel it
was a "long time between drinks" since your last. ("I tell you
what," said Eliza, looking up and sniggering with pleasure, "he's
no fool." Helen, with a smile that was half ribald, half annoyed,
about her big mouth, made a face at Luke, and lifted her eyes
patiently upward to God as Eliza continued. Gant leaned forward
tensely with his head craned upward, listening carefully with a
faint grin of pleasure.) Well, mama, since I last wrote you
things have been coming my way and it now looks as if the
"Prodigal Son" will come home some day in his own private car.
("Hey, what's that?" said Gant, and she read it again for him. He
wet his thumb and looked about with a pleased grin. "Wh-wh-what's
the matter?" asked Luke. "Has he b-b-bought the railroad?" Helen
laughed hoarsely. "I'm from Missouri," she said.) It took me a
long time to get started, mama, but things were breaking against
me and all that little Stevie has ever asked from any one in this
"vale of tears" is a fair chance. (Helen laughed her ironical
husky falsetto. "All that little S-S-Stevie has ever asked," said
Luke, reddening with annoyance, "is the whole g-g-g-goddam world
with a few gold mines thrown in.") But now that I'm on my feet at
last, mama, I'm going to show the world that I haven't forgotten
those who stood by me in my "hour of need," and that the best
friend a man ever had is his mother. ("Where's the shovel?" said
Ben, snickering quietly.)</p>
<p>'That boy writes a good letter," said Gant appreciatively.
"I'm damned if he's not the smartest one of the lot when he wants
to be."</p>
<p>"Yes," said Luke angrily, "he's so smart that you'll
b-b-be-lieve any fairy tale he wants to tell you. B-b-b-but the
one who's stuck by you through thick and thin gets no c-c-credit
at all." He glanced meaningly at Helen. "It's a d-d-damn
shame."</p>
<p>"Forget about it," she said wearily.</p>
<p>"Well," said Eliza thoughtfully, holding the letter in her
folded hands and gazing away, "perhaps he's going to turn over a
new leaf now. You never know." Lost in pleased revery she looked
into vacancy, pursing her lips.</p>
<p>"I hope so!" said Helen wearily. "You've got to show me."</p>
<p>Privately: "You see how it is, don't you?" she said to Luke,
mounting to hysteria. "Do I get any credit? Do I? I can work my
fingers to the bone for them, but do I get so much as Go to Hell
for my trouble? Do I?"</p>
<p>In these years Helen went off into the South with Pearl Hines,
the saddlemaker's daughter. They sang together at moving-picture
theatres in country towns. They were booked from a theatrical
office in Atlanta.</p>
<p>Pearl Hines was a heavily built girl with a meaty face and
negroid lips. She was jolly and vital. She sang ragtime and
nigger songs with a natural passion, swinging her hips and
shaking her breasts erotically.</p>
<blockquote>"Here comes my da-dad-dy now<br>
O pop, O pop, O-o pop."</blockquote>
<p>They earned as much as $100 a week sometimes. They played in
towns like Waycross, Georgia; Greenville, South Carolina;
Hattiesburg, Mississippi, and Baton Rouge, Louisiana.</p>
<p>They brought with them the great armor of innocency. They were
eager and decent girls. Occasionally the village men made
cautious explorative insults, relying on the superstition that
lives in small towns concerning "show girls." But generally they
were well treated.</p>
<p>For them, these ventures into new lands were eager with
promise. The vacant idiot laughter, the ribald enthusiasm with
which South Carolina or Georgia countrymen, filling a theatre
with the strong smell of clay and sweat, greeted Pearl's songs,
left them unwounded, pleased, eager. They were excited to know
that they were members of the profession; they bought Variety
regularly, they saw themselves finally a celebrated high-salaried
team on "big time" in great cities. Pearl was to "put over" the
popular songs, to introduce the rag melodies with the vital
rhythm of her dynamic meatiness, Helen was to give operatic
dignity to the programme. In a respectful hush, bathed in a pink
spot, she sang ditties of higher quality&mdash;Tosti's "Goodbye,"
"The End of a Perfect Day," and "The Rosary." She had a big,
full, somewhat metallic voice: she had received training from her
Aunt Louise, the splendid blonde who had lived in Altamont for
several years after her separation from Elmer Pentland. Louise
gave music lessons and enjoyed her waning youth with handsome
young men. She was one of the ripe, rich, dangerous women that
Helen liked. She had a little girl and went away to New York with
the child when tongues grew fanged.</p>
<p>But she said: "Helen, that voice ought to be trained for grand
opera."</p>
<p>Helen had not forgotten. She fantasied of France and Italy:
the big crude glare of what she called "a career in opera," the
florid music, the tiered galleries winking with gems, the
torrential applause directed toward the full-blooded, dominant
all-shadowing songsters struck up great anthems in her. It was a
scene, she thought, in which she was meant to shine. And as the
team of Gant and Hines (The Dixie Melody Twins) moved on their
jagged circuit through the South, this desire, bright, fierce,
and formless, seemed, in some way, to be nearer realization.</p>
<p>She wrote home frequently, usually to Gant. Her letters beat
like great pulses; they were filled with the excitement of new
cities, presentiments of abundant life. In every town they met
"lovely people"&mdash;everywhere, in fact, good wives and
mothers, and nice young men, were attracted hospitably to these
two decent, happy, exciting girls. There was a vast decency, an
enormous clean vitality about Helen that subjugated good people
and defeated bad ones. She held under her dominion a score of
young men&mdash;masculine, red-faced, hard-drinking and shy. Her
relation to them was maternal and magistral, they came to listen
and to be ruled; they adored her, but few of them tried to kiss
her.</p>
<p>Eugene was puzzled and frightened by these lamb-like lions.
Among men, they were fierce, bold, and combative; with her,
awkward and timorous. One of them, a city surveyor, lean,
highboned, alcoholic, was constantly involved in police-court
brawls; another, a railroad detective, a large fair young man,
split the skulls of negroes when he was drunk, shot several men,
and was himself finally killed in a Tennessee gun-fight.</p>
<p>She never lacked for friends and protectors wherever she went.
Occasionally, Pearl's happy and vital sensuality, the innocent
gusto with which she implored</p>
<blockquote>"Some sweet old daddy<br>
Come make a fuss over me."</blockquote>
<p>drew on village rakedom to false conjectures. Unpleasant men
with wet cigars would ask them to have a convivial drink of corn
whisky, call them "girley," and suggest a hotel room or a
motorcar as a meeting-place. When this happened, Pearl was
stricken into silence; helpless and abashed, she appealed to
Helen.</p>
<p>And she, her large loose mouth tense and wounded at the
corners, her eyes a little brighter, would answer:</p>
<p>"I don't know what you mean by that remark. I guess you've
made a mistake about us." This did not fail to exact stammering
apologies and excuses.</p>
<p>She was painfully innocent, temperamentally incapable of
wholly believing the worst about any one. She lived in the
excitement of rumor and suggestion: it never seemed to her
actually possible that the fast young women who excited her had,
in the phrase she used, "gone the limit." She was skilled in
gossip, and greedily attentive to it, but of the complex
nastiness of village life she had little actual knowledge. Thus,
with Pearl Hines, she walked confidently and joyously over
volcanic crust, scenting only the odor of freedom, change, and
adventure.</p>
<p>But this partnership came to an end. The intention of Pearl
Hines' life was direct and certain. She wanted to get married,
she had always wanted to get married before she was twenty-five.
For Helen, the singing partnership, the exploration of new lands,
had been a gesture toward freedom, an instinctive groping toward
a centre of life and purpose to which she could fasten her
energy, a blind hunger for variety, beauty, and independence. She
did not know what she wanted to do with her life; it was probable
that she would never control even partially her destiny: she
would be controlled, when the time came, by the great necessity
that lived in her. That necessity was to enslave and to
serve.</p>
<p>For two or three years Helen and Pearl supported themselves by
these tours, leaving Altamont during its dull winter lassitude,
and returning to it in Spring, or in Summer, with money enough to
suffice them until their next season.</p>
<p>Pearl juggled carefully with the proposals of several young
men during this period. She had the warmest affection for a ball-
player, the second baseman and manager of the Altamont team. He
was a tough handsome young animal, forever hurling his glove down
in a frenzy of despair during the course of a game, and rushing
belligerently at the umpire. She liked his hard assurance, his
rapid twang, his tanned lean body.</p>
<p>But she was in love with no one&mdash;she would never
be&mdash;and caution told her that the life-risk on bush-league
ball-players was very great. She married finally a young man from
Jersey City, heavy of hand, hoof, and voice, who owned a young
but flourishing truck and livery business.</p>
<p>Thus, the partnership of the Dixie Melody Twins was dissolved.
Helen, left alone, turned away from the drear monotony of the
small towns to the gaiety, the variety, and the slaking
fulfilment of her desires, which she hoped somehow to find in the
cities.</p>
<p>She missed Luke terribly. Without him she felt incomplete,
unarmored. He had been enrolled in the Georgia School of
Technology in Atlanta for two years. He was taking the course in
electrical engineering, the whole direction of his life had been
thus shaped by Gant's eulogies, years before, of the young
electrical expert, Liddell. He was failing in his work&mdash;his
mind had never been forced to the discipline of study. All
purpose with him was broken by a thousand impulses: his brain
stammered as did his tongue, and as he turned impatiently and
irritably to the logarithm tables, he muttered the number of the
page in idiot repetition, keeping up a constant wild vibration of
his leg upon the ball of his foot.</p>
<p>His great commercial talent was salesmanship; he had
superlatively that quality that American actors and men of
business call "personality"&mdash;a wild energy, a Rabelaisian
vulgarity, a sensory instinct for rapid and swinging repartee,
and a hypnotic power of speech, torrential, meaningless, mad, and
evangelical. He could sell anything because, in the jargon of
salesmen, he could sell himself; and there was a fortune in him
in the fantastic elasticity of American business, the club of all
the queer trades, of wild promotions, where, amok with zealot
rage, he could have chanted the yokels into delirium, and cut the
buttons from their coats, doing every one, everything, and
finally himself. He was not an electrical engineer&mdash;he was
electrical energy. He had no gift for study&mdash;he gathered his
unriveted mind together and bridged with it desperately, but
crumpled under the stress and strain of calculus and the
mechanical sciences.</p>
<p>Enormous humor flowed from him like crude light. Men who had
never known him seethed with strange internal laughter when they
saw him, and roared helplessly when he began to speak. Yet, his
physical beauty was astonishing. His head was like that of a wild
angel&mdash;coils and whorls of living golden hair flashed from
his head, his features were regular, generous, and masculine,
illuminated by the strange inner smile of idiot ecstasy.</p>
<p>His broad mouth, even when stammering irritably or when
nervousness clouded his face, was always cocked for
laughter&mdash;unearthly, exultant, idiot laughter. There was in
him demonic exuberance, a wild intelligence that did not come
from the brain. Eager for praise, for public esteem, and expert
in ingratiation, this demon possessed him utterly at the most
unexpected moments, in the most decorous surroundings, when he
was himself doing all in his power to preserve the good opinion
in which he was held.</p>
<p>Thus, listening to an old lady of the church, who with all her
power of persuasion and earnestness was unfolding the dogmas of
Presbyterianism to him, he would lean forward in an attitude of
exaggerated respectfulness and attention, one broad hand clinched
about his knee, while he murmured gentle agreement to what she
said:</p>
<p>"Yes?...Ye-e-es?...Ye-e-e-es?...Ye-e-es?...Is that
right?...Ye-e-es?"</p>
<p>Suddenly the demonic force would burst in him. Insanely
tickled at the cadences of his agreement, the earnest placidity
and oblivion of the old woman, and the extravagant pretense of
the whole situation, his face flooded with wild exultancy, he
would croon in a fat luscious bawdily suggestive voice:</p>
<p>"Y-ah-s?...Y-a-h-s?...Y-a-h-s?...Y-ah-s?"</p>
<p>And when at length too late she became aware of this drowning
flood of demonic nonsense, and paused, turning an abrupt startled
face to him, he would burst into a wild "Whah-whah-whah-whah" of
laughter, beyond all reason, with strange throat noises, tickling
her roughly in the ribs.</p>
<p>Often Eliza, in the midst of long, minutely replenished
reminiscence, would grow conscious, while she was purse-lipped in
revery, of this annihilating mockery, would slap at his hand
angrily as he gooched her, and shake a pursed piqued face at him,
saying, with a heavy scorn that set him off into fresh "whah-
whahs": "I'll declare, boy! You act like a regular idiot," and
then shaking her head sadly, with elaborate pity: "I'd be ash-a-
amed! A-sha-a-med."</p>
<p>His quality was extraordinary; he had something that was a
great deal better than most intelligence; he saw the world in
burlesque, and his occasional answer to its sham, hypocrisy, and
intrigue was the idiot devastation of "whah-whah!" But he did not
possess his demon; it possessed him from time to time. If it had
possessed him wholly, constantly, his life would have prevailed
with astonishing honesty and precision. But when he reflected, he
was a child&mdash;with all the hypocrisy, sentimentality and
dishonest pretense of a child.</p>
<p>His face was a church in which beauty and humor were
married&mdash;the strange and the familiar were at one in him.
Men, looking at Luke, felt a start of recognition as if they saw
something of which they had never heard, but which they had known
forever.</p>
<p>Once or twice, during the Winter and Spring, while she was
touring with Pearl Hines, Helen got into Atlanta to see him. In
Spring they attended the week of Grand Opera. He would find
employment for one night as a spearman in A&iuml;da and pass the
doorman for the remainder of the week with the assurance that he
was "a member of the company&mdash;Lukio Gantio."</p>
<p>His large feet spread tightly out in sandals; behind the
shingreaves his awkward calves were spined thickly with hair; a
thick screw of hair writhed under the edge of his tin helmet, as
he loafed in the wings, leaning comically on his spear, his face
lit with exultancy.</p>
<p>Caruso, waiting his entrance, regarded him from time to time
with a wide Wop smile.</p>
<p>"Wotta you call yourself, eh?" asked Caruso, approaching and
looking him over.</p>
<p>"W-w-w-why," he said, "d-don't you know one of your
s-s-s-soldiers when you see him?"</p>
<p>"You're one hell of a soldier," said Caruso.</p>
<p>"Whah-whah-whah!" Luke answered. With difficulty he restrained
his prodding fingers.</p>
<p>In the summer now he returned to Altamont, finding employment
with a firm of land-auctioneers, and assisting them at the sale
of a tract or a parcel of lots. He moved about above the crowd in
the bed of a wagon, exhorting them to bid, with his hand at the
side of his mouth, in a harangue compounded of frenzy, passionate
solicitation, and bawdry. The work intoxicated him. With wide
grins of expectancy they crowded round the spokes. In a high
throaty tenor he called to them:</p>
<p>"Step right up, gentlemen, lot number 17, in beautiful
Homewood&mdash;we furnish the wood, you furnish the home. Now
gentlemen, this handsome building-site has a depth of 179 feet,
leaving plenty of room for garden and backhouse (grow your own
corn cobs in beautiful Homewood) with a frontage of 114 feet on a
magnificent new macadam road."</p>
<p>"Where is the road?" some one shouted.</p>
<p>"On the blueprint, of course, Colonel. You've got it all in
black and white. Now, gentlemen, the opportunity of your lives is
kicking you in the pants. Are you men of vision? Think what Ford,
Edison, Napoleon Bonaparte, and Julius Caesar would do. Obey that
impulse. You can't lose. The town is coming this way. Listen
carefully. Do you hear it? Swell. The new courthouse will be
built on yonder hill, the undertaker and the village bakery will
occupy handsome edifices of pressed brick just above you. Oyez,
oyez, oyez. What am I offered? What am I offered? Own your own
home in beautiful Homewood, within a cannonshot of all railway,
automobile, and airplane connections. Running water abounds
within a Washingtonian stone's throw and in all the pipes. Our
caravans meet all trains. Gentlemen, here's your chance to make a
fortune. The ground is rich in mineral resources&mdash;gold,
silver, copper, iron, bituminous coal and oil, will be found in
large quantities below the roots of all the trees."</p>
<p>"What about the bushes, Luke?" yelled Mr. Halloran, the
dairy-lunch magnate.</p>
<p>"Down in the bushes, that is where she gushes," Luke answered
amid general tumult. "All right, Major. You with the face. What
am I offered? What am I offered?"</p>
<p>When there was no sale, he greeted incoming tourists at the
station-curbing with eloquent invitations to Dixieland, rich,
persuasive, dominant above all the soliciting babel of the car-
drivers, negro hotel-porters, and boarding-house husbands.</p>
<p>"I'll give you a dollar apiece for every one you drum up,"
said Eliza.</p>
<p>"O that's all right." O modestly. Generously.</p>
<p>"He'd give you the shirt off his back," said Gant.</p>
<p>A fine boy. As she cooled from her labors in the summer night,
he brought her little boxes of ice-cream from town.</p>
<p>He was a hustler: he sold patent washboards, trick
potato-peelers, and powdered cockroach-poison from house to
house. To the negroes he sold hair-oil guaranteed to straighten
kinky hair, and religious lithographs, peopled with flying
angels, white and black, and volant cherubs, black and white,
sailing about the knees of an impartial and crucified Saviour,
and subtitled "God Loves Them Both."</p>
<p>They sold like hot cakes.</p>
<p>Otherwise, he drove Gant's car&mdash;a 1913 five-passenger
Ford, purchase of an inspired hour of madness, occupant now of
half Gant's conversation, object of abuse, boast, and anathema.
It was before every one owned a car. Gant was awed and terrified
by his rash act, exalted at the splendor of his chariot, appalled
at its expense. Each bill for gasoline, repairs, or equipment
brought a howl of anguish from him; a puncture, a breakdown, a
minor disorder caused him to circle about in maddened strides,
cursing, praying, weeping.</p>
<p>"I've never had a moment's peace since I bought it," he
howled. "Accursed and bloody monster that it is, it will not be
content until it has sucked out my life-blood, sold the roof over
my head, and sent me out to the pauper's grave to perish.
Merciful God," he wept, "it's fearful, it's awful, it's cruel
that I should be afflicted thus in my old age." Turning to his
constrained and apologetic son abruptly, he said: "How much is
the bill? Hey?" His eyes roved wildly in his head.</p>
<p>"D-d-d-don't get excited, papa," Luke answered soothingly,
teetering from foot to foot, "it's only $8.92."</p>
<p>"Jesus God!" Gant screamed. "I'm ruined." Sobbing in loud
burlesque sniffles, he began his caged pacing.</p>
<p>But it was pleasant at dusk or in the cool summer nights, with
Eliza or one of his daughters beside him, and a fragrant weed
between his pallid lips, to hinge his long body into the back
seat, and ride out into the fragrant countryside, or through the
long dark streets of town. At the approach of another car he
cried out in loud alarm, by turns cursing and entreating his son
to caution. Luke drove nervously, erratically, wildly&mdash;his
stammering impatient hands and knees communicated their uneven
fidget to the flivver. He cursed irritably, plunged in
exacerbated fury at the brake, and burst out in an annoyed
"tuh-tuh-tuh-tuh," when the car stalled.</p>
<p>As the hour grew late, and the streets silent, his madness
swelled in him. Lipping the rim of a long hill street,
tree-arched and leafy and shelving in even terraces, he would
burst suddenly into insane laughter, bend over the wheel, and
pull the throttle open, his idiot "whah-whahs" filling the
darkness as Gant screamed curses at him. Down through the night
they tore at murderous speed, the boy laughing at curse and
prayer alike as they shot past the blind menace of
street-crossings.</p>
<p>"You Goddamned scoundrel!" Gant yelled. "Stop, you mountain
grill, or I'll put you in jail."</p>
<p>"Whah-whah."&mdash;His laughter soared to a crazy
falsetto.</p>
<p>Daisy, arrived for a few weeks of summer coolness, quite blue
with terror, would clutch the most recent of her annual arrivals
to her breast, melodramatically, and moan:</p>
<p>"I beg of you, for the sake of my family, for the sake of my
innocent motherless babes&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Whah-whah-whah!"</p>
<p>"He's a fiend out of hell," cried Gant, beginning to weep.
"Cruel and criminal monster that he is, he will batter our brains
out against a tree, before he's done." They whizzed with a
perilous swerve by a car that, with a startled screech of its
brakes, balked at the corner like a frightened horse.</p>
<p>"You damned thug!" Gant roared, plunging forward and fastening
his great hands around Luke's throat. "Will you stop?"</p>
<p>Luke added another notch of blazing speed. Gant fell backward
with a howl of terror.</p>
<p>On Sunday they made long tours into the country. Often they
drove to Reynoldsville, twenty-two miles away. It was an ugly
little resort, noisy with arriving and departing cars, with a
warm stench of oil and gasoline heavy above its broad main
street. But people were coming and going from several States:
Southward they came up from South Carolina and Georgia,
cotton-farmers, small tradesmen and their families in battered
cars coated with red sandclay dust. They had a heavy afternoon
dinner of fried chicken, corn, string- beans, and sliced
tomatoes, at one of the big wooden boarding-house hotels, spent
another hour in a drugstore over a chocolate nut- sundae, watched
the summer crowd of fortunate tourists and ripe cool-skinned
virgins flow by upon the wide sidewalk in thick pullulation, and
returned again, after a brief tour of the town, on the winding
immediate drop to the hot South. New lands.</p>
<p>Fluescent with smooth ripe curves, the drawling virgins of the
South filled summer porches.</p>
<p>Luke was a darling. He was a dear, a fine boy, a big-hearted
generous fellow, and just the cutest thing. Women liked him,
laughed at him, pulled fondly the thick golden curls of his hair.
He was sentimentally tender to children&mdash;girls of fourteen
years. He had a grand romantic feeling for Delia Selborne, the
oldest daughter of Mrs. Selborne. He bought her presents, was
tender and irritable by turns. Once, at Gant's, on the porch
under an August moon and the smell of ripening grapes, he
caressed her while Helen sang in the parlor. He caressed her
gently, leaned his head over her, and said he would like to lay
it on her b-b-b-b-breast. Eugene watched them bitterly, with an
inch of poison round his heart. He wanted the girl for himself:
she was stupid, but she had the wise body and faint hovering
smile of her mother. He wanted Mrs. Selborne more, he fantasied
passionately about her yet, but her image lived again in Delia.
As a result, he was proud, cold, scornful and foolish before
them. They disliked him.</p>
<p>Enviously, with gnawn heart, he observed Luke's ministrations
to Mrs. Selborne. His service was so devout, so extravagant that
even Helen grew annoyed and occasionally jealous. And nightly,
from a remote corner at Gant's or Eliza's, or from a parked
automobile before the house, he heard her rich welling laughter,
full of tenderness, surrender, and mystery. Sometimes, waiting in
pitch darkness on the stairs at Eliza's, at one or two o'clock in
the morning, he felt her pass him. As she touched him in the
dark, she gave a low cry of terror; with an uncivil grunt he
reassured her, and descended to bed with a pounding heart and
burning face.</p>
<p>Ah, yes, he thought, with green morality, observing his
brother throned in laughter and affection, you Big Fool,
you&mdash;you're just a sucker! You show off and act big, my
sonny, and spend your money bringing ice-cream for them&mdash;but
what do you get out of it? How do you feel when she gets out of
an automobile at two o'clock in the morning after grunting in the
dark with some damned travelling-man, or with old Poxy Logan
who's been keeping a nigger woman up for years. "May I p-p-p-put
my head on your breast?" You make me sick, you damned fool. SHE'S
no better, only you don't know beans. She'll let you spend all
your money on her and then she'll run off with some little pimp
in an automobile for the rest of the night. Yes, that's so. Do
you want to make anything out of it? You big bluff. Come out into
the back yard....I'll show you...take that...and that...and
that...</p>
<p>Pumping his fists wildly, he fought his phantom into defeat
and himself into exhaustion.</p>
<p>Luke had several hundred dollars saved from The Saturday
Evening Post days, when he went off to school. He accepted very
little money from Gant. He waited on tables, he solicited for
college boarding-houses, he was the agent for a tailor who made
Kippy Kampus Klothes. Gant boasted of these efforts. The town
shifted its quid, nodded pertly, and spat, saying:</p>
<p>"That boy'll make his mark."</p>
<p>Luke worked as hard for an education as any other self-made
man. He made every sacrifice. He did everything but study.</p>
<p>He was an immense popular success, so very extra, so very
Luky. The school sought and adored him. Twice, after football
games, he mounted a hearse and made funeral orations over the
University of Georgia.</p>
<p>But, in spite of all his effort, toward the end of his third
year he was still a sophomore, with every prospect of remaining
one. One day in Spring he wrote the following letter to Gant:</p>
<p>"The b-b-b-bastards who r-r-run this place have it in for me.
I've been c-c-c-crooked good and proper. They take your
hard-earned m- m-money here and skin you. I'm g-g-g-going to a
real school."</p>
<p>He went to Pittsburgh and found work with the Westinghouse
Electric Company. Three times a week at night he attended courses
at the Carnegie Institute of Technology. He made friends.</p>
<p>The war had come. After fifteen months in Pittsburgh he moved
on to Dayton where he got employment at a boiler factory engaged
in the fabrication of war materials.</p>
<p>From time to time, in summer for a few weeks, at Christmas for
a few days, he returned to celebrate his holidays with his
family. Always he brought Gant a suitcase stocked with beer and
whisky. That boy was "good to his father."</p>
<h3>19</h3>
<p>One afternoon in the young summer, Gant leaned upon the rail,
talking to Jannadeau. He was getting on to sixty-five, his erect
body had settled, he stooped a little. He spoke of old age often,
and he wept in his tirades now because of his stiffened hand.
Soaked in pity, he referred to himself as "the poor old cripple
who has to provide for them all."</p>
<p>The indolence of age and disintegration was creeping over him.
He now rose a full hour late, he came to his shop punctually, but
he spent long hours of the day extended on the worn leather couch
of his office, or in gossip with Jannadeau, bawdy old Liddell,
Cardiac, and Fagg Sluder, who had salted away his fortune in two
big buildings on the Square and was at the present moment tilted
comfortably in a chair before the fire department, gossiping
eagerly with members of the ball club, whose chief support he
was. It was after five o'clock, the game was over.</p>
<p>Negro laborers, grisly with a white coating of cement, sloped
down past the shop on their way home. The draymen dispersed
slowly, a slouchy policeman loafed down the steps of the city
hall picking his teeth, and on the market side, from high grilled
windows, there came the occasional howls of a drunken negress.
Life buzzed slowly like a fly.</p>
<p>The sun had reddened slightly, there was a cool flowing breath
from the hills, a freshening relaxation over the tired earth, the
hope, the ecstasy of evening in the air. In slow pulses the thick
plume of fountain rose, fell upon itself, and slapped the pool in
lazy rhythms. A wagon rattled leanly over the big cobbles; beyond
the firemen, the grocer Bradley wound up his awning with slow
creaking revolutions.</p>
<p>Across the Square, at its other edge, the young virgins of the
eastern part of town walked lightly home in chattering groups.
They came to town at four o'clock in the afternoon, walked up and
down the little avenue several times, entered a shop to purchase
small justifications, and finally went into the chief drugstore,
where the bucks of the town loafed and drawled in lazy alert
groups. It was their club, their brasserie, the forum of the
sexes. With confident smiles the young men detached themselves
from their group and strolled back to booth and table.</p>
<p>"Hey theah! Wheahd you come from?"</p>
<p>"Move ovah theah, lady. I want to tawk to you."</p>
<p>Eyes as blue as Southern skies looked roguishly up to laughing
gray ones, the winsome dimples deepened, and the sweetest little
tail in dear old Dixie slid gently over on the polished
board.</p>
<p>Gant spent delightful hours now in the gossip of dirty old
men&mdash;their huddled bawdry exploded in cracked high wheezes
on the Square. He came home at evening stored with gutter
tidings, wetting his thumb and smiling slyly as he questioned
Helen hopefully:</p>
<p>"She's no better than a regular little chippie&mdash;eh?"</p>
<p>"Ha-ha-ha-ha," she laughed mockingly. "Don't you wish you
knew?"</p>
<p>His age bore certain fruits, emoluments of service. When she
came home in the evening with one of her friends, she presented
the girl with jocose eagerness to his embrace. And, crying out
paternally, "Why, bless her heart! Come kiss the old man," he
planted bristling mustache kisses on their white throats, their
soft lips, grasping the firm meat of one arm tenderly with his
good hand and cradling them gently. They shrieked with throaty
giggle-twiddles of pleasure because it tuh-tuh-tuh-tuh-TICKLED
so.</p>
<p>"Ooh! Mr. Gant! Whah-whah-whah!"</p>
<p>"Your father's such a nice man," they said. "Such lovely
manners."</p>
<p>Helen's eyes fed fiercely on them. She laughed with
husky-harsh excitement.</p>
<p>"Hah-ha-ha! He likes that, doesn't he? It's too bad, old boy,
isn't it? No more monkey business."</p>
<p>He talked with Jannadeau, while his fugitive eyes roved over
the east end of the Square. Before the shop the comely matrons of
the town came up from the market. From time to time they smiled,
seeing him, and he bowed sweepingly. Such lovely manners.</p>
<p>"The King of England," he observed, "is only a figurehead. He
doesn't begin to have the power of the President of the United
States."</p>
<p>"His power is severely li-MIT-ed," said Jannadeau gutturally,
"by custom but not by statute. In actua-LITY he is still one of
the most powerful monarchs in the world." His thick black fingers
probed carefully into the viscera of a watch.</p>
<p>"The late King Edward for all his faults," said Gant, wetting
his thumb, "was a smart man. This fellow they've got now is a
nonentity and a nincompoop." He grinned faintly, craftily, with
pleasure at the big words, glancing slily at the Swiss to see if
they had told.</p>
<p>His uneasy eyes followed carefully the stylish carriage of
"Queen" Elizabeth's well clad figure as she went down by the
shop. She smiled pleasantly, and for a moment turned her candid
stare upon smooth marble slabs of death, carved lambs and
cherubim. Gant bowed elaborately.</p>
<p>"Good-evening, madam," he said.</p>
<p>She disappeared. In a moment she came back decisively and
mounted the broad steps. He watched her approach with quickened
pulses. Twelve years.</p>
<p>"How's the madam?" he said gallantly. "Elizabeth, I was just
telling Jannadeau you were the most stylish woman in town."</p>
<p>"Well, that's mighty sweet of you, Mr. Gant," she said in her
cool poised voice. "You've always got a word for every one."</p>
<p>She gave a bright pleasant nod to Jannadeau, who swung his
huge scowling head ponderously around and muttered at her.</p>
<p>"Why, Elizabeth," said Gant, "you haven't changed an inch in
fifteen years. I don't believe you're a day older."</p>
<p>She was thirty-eight and pleasantly aware of it.</p>
<p>"Oh, yes," she said laughing. "You're only saying that to make
me feel good. I'm no chicken any more."</p>
<p>She had a pale clear skin, pleasantly freckled, carrot-colored
hair, and a thin mouth live with humor. Her figure was trim and
strong&mdash;no longer young. She had a great deal of energy,
distinction, and elegance in her manner.</p>
<p>"How are all the girls, Elizabeth?" he asked kindly.</p>
<p>Her face grew sad. She began to pull her gloves off.</p>
<p>"That's what I came to see you about," she said. "I lost one
of them last week."</p>
<p>"Yes," said Gant gravely, "I was sorry to hear of that."</p>
<p>"She was the best girl I had," said Elizabeth. "I'd have done
anything in the world for her. We did everything we could," she
added. "I've no regrets on that score. I had a doctor and two
trained nurses by her all the time."</p>
<p>She opened her black leather handbag, thrust her gloves into
it, and pulling out a small bluebordered handkerchief, began to
weep quietly.</p>
<p>"Huh-huh-huh-huh-huh," said Gant, shaking his head. "Too bad,
too bad, too bad. Come back to my office," he said. They went
back and sat down. Elizabeth dried her eyes.</p>
<p>"What was her name?" he asked.</p>
<p>"We called her Lily&mdash;her full name was Lillian Reed."</p>
<p>"Why, I knew that girl," he exclaimed. "I spoke to her not
over two weeks ago."</p>
<p>"Yes," said Elizabeth, "she went like that&mdash;one
hemorrhage right after another, down here." She tapped her
abdomen. "Nobody ever knew she was sick until last Wednesday.
Friday she was gone." She wept again.</p>
<p>"T-t-t-t-t-t," he clucked regretfully. "Too bad, too bad. She
was pretty as a picture."</p>
<p>"I couldn't have loved her more, Mr. Gant," said Elizabeth,
"if she had been my own daughter."</p>
<p>"How old was she?" he asked.</p>
<p>"Twenty-two," said Elizabeth, beginning to weep again.</p>
<p>"What a pity! What a pity!" he agreed. "Did she have any
people?"</p>
<p>"No one who would do anything for her," Elizabeth said. "Her
mother died when she was thirteen&mdash;she was born out here on
the Beetree Fork&mdash;and her father," she added indignantly,
"is a mean old bastard who's never done anything for her or any
one else. He didn't even come to her funeral."</p>
<p>"He will be punished," said Gant darkly.</p>
<p>"As sure as there's a God in heaven," Elizabeth agreed, "he'll
get what's coming to him in hell. The old bastard!" she continued
virtuously, "I hope he rots!"</p>
<p>"You can depend upon it," he said grimly. "He will. Ah, Lord."
He was silent a moment while he shook his head with slow
regret.</p>
<p>"A pity, a pity," he muttered. "So young." He had the moment
of triumph all men have when they hear some one has died. A
moment, too, of grisly fear. Sixty-four.</p>
<p>"I couldn't have loved her more," said Elizabeth, "if she'd
been one of my own. A young girl like that, with all her life
before her."</p>
<p>"It's pretty sad when you come to think of it," he said. "By
God, it is."</p>
<p>"And she was such a fine girl, Mr. Gant," said Elizabeth,
weeping softly. "She had such a bright future before her. She had
more opportunities than I ever had, and I suppose you
know"&mdash;she spoke modestly&mdash;"what I've done."</p>
<p>"Why," he exclaimed, startled, "you're a rich woman,
Elizabeth&mdash;damned if I don't believe you are. You own
property all over town."</p>
<p>"I wouldn't say that," she answered, "but I've got enough to
live on without ever doing another lick of work. I've had to work
hard all my life. From now on I don't intend to turn my hand
over."</p>
<p>She regarded him with a shy pleased smile, and touched a coil
of her fine hair with a small competent hand. He looked at her
attentively, noting with pleasure her firm uncorseted hips,
moulded compactly into her tailored suit, and her cocked comely
legs tapering to graceful feet, shod in neat little slippers of
tan. She was firm, strong, washed, and elegant&mdash;a faint
scent of lilac hovered over her: he looked at her candid eyes,
lucently gray, and saw that she was quite a great lady.</p>
<p>"By God, Elizabeth," he said, "you're a fine-looking
woman."</p>
<p>"I've had a good life," she said. "I've taken care of
myself."</p>
<p>They had always known each other&mdash;since first they met.
They had no excuses, no questions, no replies. The world fell
away from them. In the silence they heard the pulsing slap of the
fountain, the high laughter of bawdry in the Square. He took a
book of models from the desk, and began to turn its slick pages.
They showed modest blocks of Georgia marble and Vermont
granite.</p>
<p>"I don't want any of those," she said impatiently. "I've
already made up my mind. I know what I want."</p>
<p>He looked up surprised. "What is it?"</p>
<p>"I want the angel out front."</p>
<p>His face was shocked and unwilling. He gnawed the corner of
his thin lip. No one knew how fond he was of the angel. Publicly
he called it his White Elephant. He cursed it and said he had
been a fool to order it. For six years it had stood on the porch,
weathering, in all the wind and the rain. It was now brown and
fly-specked. But it had come from Carrara in Italy, and it held a
stone lily delicately in one hand. The other hand was lifted in
benediction, it was poised clumsily upon the ball of one phthisic
foot, and its stupid white face wore a smile of soft stone
idiocy.</p>
<p>In his rages, Gant sometimes directed vast climaxes of abuse
at the angel. "Fiend out of Hell!" he roared. "You have
impoverished me, you have ruined me, you have cursed my declining
years, and now you will crush me to death, fearful, awful, and
unnatural monster that you are."</p>
<p>But sometimes when he was drunk he fell weeping on his knees
before it, called it Cynthia, and entreated its love,
forgiveness, and blessing for its sinful but repentant boy. There
was laughter from the Square.</p>
<p>"What's the matter?" said Elizabeth. "Don't you want to sell
it?"</p>
<p>"It will cost you a good deal, Elizabeth," he said
evasively.</p>
<p>"I don't care," she answered, positively. "I've got the money.
How much do you want?"</p>
<p>He was silent, thinking for a moment of the place where the
angel stood. He knew he had nothing to cover or obliterate that
place&mdash;it left a barren crater in his heart.</p>
<p>"All right," he said. "You can have it for what I paid for
it&mdash;$420."</p>
<p>She took a thick sheaf of banknotes from her purse and counted
the money out for him. He pushed it back.</p>
<p>"No. Pay me when the job's finished and it has been set up.
You want some sort of inscription, don't you?"</p>
<p>"Yes. There's her full name, age, place of birth, and so on,"
she said, giving him a scrawled envelope. "I want some poetry,
too&mdash;something that suits a young girl taken off like
this."</p>
<p>He pulled his tattered little book of inscriptions from a
pigeonhole, and thumbed its pages, reading her a quatrain here
and there. To each she shook her head. Finally, he said:</p>
<p>"How's this one, Elizabeth?" He read:</p>
<blockquote>She went away in beauty's flower,<br>
Before her youth was spent;<br>
Ere life and love had lived their hour<br>
God called her, and she went.<br>
<br>
Yet whispers Faith upon the wind:<br>
No grief to her was given.<br>
She left YOUR love and went to find<br>
A greater one in heaven.</blockquote>
<p>"Oh, that's lovely&mdash;lovely," she said. "I want that
one."</p>
<p>"Yes," he agreed, "I think that's the best one."</p>
<p>In the musty cool smell of his little office they got up. Her
gallant figure reached his shoulder. She buttoned her kid gloves
over the small pink haunch of her palms and glanced about her.
His battered sofa filled one wall, the line of his long body was
printed in the leather. She looked up at him. His face was sad
and grave. They remembered.</p>
<p>"It's been a long time, Elizabeth," he said.</p>
<p>They walked slowly to the front through aisled marbles.
Sentinelled just beyond the wooden doors, the angel leered
vacantly down. Jannadeau drew his great head turtlewise a little
further into the protective hunch of his burly shoulders. They
went out on to the porch.</p>
<p>The moon stood already, like its own phantom, in the clear
washed skies of evening. A little boy with an empty
paper-delivery bag swung lithely by, his freckled nostrils
dilating pleasantly with hunger and the fancied smell of supper.
He passed, and for a moment, as they stood at the porch edge, all
life seemed frozen in a picture: the firemen and Fagg Sluder had
seen Gant, whispered, and were now looking toward him; a
policeman, at the high side- porch of the Police Court, leaned on
the rail and stared; at the near edge of the central grass-plot
below the fountain, a farmer bent for water at a bubbling jet,
rose dripping, and stared; from the Tax Collector's office, City
Hall, upstairs, Yancey, huge, meaty, shirtsleeved, stared. And in
that second the slow pulse of the fountain was suspended, life
was held, like an arrested gesture, in photographic abeyance, and
Gant felt himself alone move deathward in a world of seemings as,
in 1910, a man might find himself again in a picture taken on the
grounds of the Chicago Fair, when he was thirty and his mustache
black, and, noting the bustled ladies and the derbied men fixed
in the second's pullulation, remember the dead instant, seek
beyond the borders for what was there (he knew); or as a veteran
who finds himself upon his elbow near Ulysses Grant, before the
march, in pictures of the Civil War, and sees a dead man on a
horse; or I should say, like some completed Don, who finds
himself again before a tent in Scotland in his youth, and notes a
cricket-bat long lost and long forgotten, the face of a poet who
has died, and young men and the tutor as they looked that Long
Vacation when they read nine hours a day for "Greats."</p>
<p>Where now? Where after? Where then?</p>
<h3>20</h3>
<p>Gant, during these years in which Helen and Luke, the two for
whom he felt the deepest affection, were absent a large part of
the time, lived a splintered existence at home and at Eliza's. He
feared and hated a lonely life, but habit was deeply rooted in
him, and he was unwilling to exchange the well-used comfort of
his own home for the bald wintriness of Eliza's. She did not want
him. She fed him willingly enough, but his tirades and his
nightly sojourns, both longer and more frequent now that his
daughter was absent, annoyed her more than they ever had
before.</p>
<p>"You have a place of your own," she cried fretfully. "Why
don't you stay in it? I don't want you around making
trouble."</p>
<p>"Send him on," he moaned bitterly. "Send him on. Over the
stones rattle his bones, he's only a beggar that nobody owns. Ah,
Lord! The old drayhorse has had its day. Its race is run. Kick
him out: the old cripple can no longer provide them with
victuals, and they will throw him on the junkheap, unnatural and
degenerate monsters that they are."</p>
<p>But he remained at Dixieland as long as there was any one to
listen to him, and to the bleak little group of winter boarders
he brought magic. They fed hungrily on all the dramatic gusto
with which, lunging back and forth in the big rocker, before the
blazing parlor fire, he told and retold the legends of his
experience, taking, before their charmed eyes, an incident that
had touched him romantically, and embellishing, weaving and
building it up. A whole mythology grew up as, goggle-eyed, they
listened:</p>
<p>General Fitzhugh Lee, who had reined up before the farmer boy
and asked for a drink of water, now tossed off an oaken
bucketful, questioned him closely concerning the best roads into
Gettysburg, asked if he had seen detachments of the enemy, wrote
his name down in a small book, and went off saying to his staff:
"That boy will make his mark. It is impossible to defeat an enemy
which breeds boys like that."</p>
<p>The Indians, whom he had passed amicably as he rode out into
the New Mexican desert on a burro, seeking the ancient fort, now
spurred after him with fell intent and wild scalping whoops. He
rode furiously through muttering redskin villages, and found the
protection of two cattlemen in the nick of time. The thief who
had entered his room at dead of night in New Orleans, and picked
up his clothes, and whom he had fought desperately upon the
floor, he now pursued naked for seventeen blocks (not five) down
Canal Street.</p>
<p>He went several times a week to the moving-picture shows,
taking Eugene, and sitting, bent forward in hunched absorption,
through two full performances. They came out at ten-thirty or
eleven o'clock, on cold ringing pavements, into a world frozen
bare&mdash;a dead city of closed shops, dressed windows,
milliners' and clothiers' models posturing with waxen gaiety at
congealed silence.</p>
<p>On the Square the slackened fountain dropped a fat spire of
freezing water into its thickening rim of ice. In summer, a tall
spire blown in blue sheets of spray. When they turned it down it
wilted&mdash;that was like a fountain, too. No wind blew.</p>
<p>His eyes fixed on the clean concrete walk, Gant strode on,
muttering dramatically, composing a narrative of the picture. The
cold steel of new sewing-machines glinted in dim light. The
Singer building. Tallest in the world. The stitching hum of
Eliza's machine. Needle through your finger before you know it.
He winced. They passed the Sluder Building at the corner of the
Square and turned left. Gets over $700 a month in office-rent
from this alone. The window on the corner was filled with rubber
syringes and thermos bottles. Drink Coca Cola. They say he stole
the formula from old mountain woman. $50,000,000 now. Rats in the
vats. Dope at Wood's better. Too weak here. He had recently
acquired a taste for the beverage and drank four or five glasses
a day.</p>
<p>D. Stern had his old shack on that corner twenty years before
Fagg bought it. Belonged to Paston estate. Could have bought it
for a song. Rich man now. D. moved to North Main now. The Jew's
rich. Fortune out of winnies. They're hot, they're hot. In a
broken pot. If I had a little time I'd make a little rhyme.
Thirteen kids&mdash;she had one every year. As broad as she's
long. They all get fat. Every one works. Sons pay father board.
None of mine, I can assure you. The Jews get there.</p>
<p>The hunchback&mdash;what did they call him? One of Nature's
Cruel Jests. Ah, Lord! What's become of old John Bunny? I used to
like his pictures. Oh yes. Dead.</p>
<p>That pure look they have, at the end, when he kisses her,
mused Eugene. Later&mdash;A Warmer Clime. Her long lashes curled
down over her wet eyes, she was unable to meet his gaze. The
sweet lips trembled with desire as, clasping her in a grip of
steel, he bent down over her yielding body and planted hungry
kisses on her mouth. When the purple canopy of dawn had been reft
asunder by the rays of the invading sun. The Stranger. It
wouldn't do to say the next morning. They have a thick coat of
yellow paint all over their face. Meanwhile, in Old England. I
wonder what they say to each other. They're a pretty tough lot, I
suppose.</p>
<p>A swift thrust of conviction left him unperturbed. The other
was better.</p>
<p>He thought of the Stranger. Steel-gray eyes. A steady face. An
eighth of a second faster on the draw than any one else. Two-gun
Bill Hart. Anderson of the Essanay. Strong quiet men.</p>
<p>He clapped his hand against his buttock with a sharp smack and
shot the murderous forefinger at an ashcan, a lamp-post, and a
barber- pole, with a snapping wrist. Gant, startled in
composition, gave him a quick uneasy look. They walked on.</p>
<p>Came a day when Spring put forth her blossoms on the earth
again. No, no&mdash;not that. Then all grew dark. Picture of a
lily trampled on the earth. That means he bigged her. Art. Filled
her with thee a baby fair. You can't go away now. Why?
Because&mdash;because&mdash;her eyes dropped shyly, a slow flush
mantled her cheek. He stared at her blankly for a moment, then
his puzzled gaze&mdash;(O good!)&mdash;fell to the tiny object
she was fingering nervously, with dawning comprehension. Blushing
rosily, she tried to conceal the little jacket behind her. Grace!
A great light broke on him! Do you mean it? She went to him with
a cry, half laugh, half sob, and buried her burning face in his
neck. You silly boy. Of course I mean it (you bastard!). The
little dance girl. Smiling with wet lechery and manipulating his
moist rope of cigar, Faro Jim shuffled a pack of cards slowly and
fixed on her his vulturesque eye. A knife in his shiny boots, a
small derringer and three aces up his ruffled sleeve, and suave
murder in his heart. But the cold gray eyes of the Stranger
missed nothing. Imperturbably he drank his Scotch, wheeled from
the mirror with barking Colt just one-sixth of a second before
the gambler could fire. Faro coughed and slid forward slowly upon
the floor.</p>
<p>There was no sound now in the crowded room of the Triple Y.
Men stood petrified. The face of Bad Bill and the two Mexicans
had turned a dirty gray. Finally, the sheriff spoke, turning with
awe from the still figure on the sawdust floor.</p>
<p>"By God, stranger!" he ejaculated, "I never knew the man lived
who could beat Faro to the draw. What's yore name?"</p>
<p>"In the fam'ly Bible back home, pardner," the Stranger
drawled, "it's Eugene Gant, but folks out here generally calls me
The Dixie Ghost."</p>
<p>There was a slow gasp of wonder from the crowd.</p>
<p>"Gawd!" some one whispered. "It's the Ghost!"</p>
<p>As the Ghost turned coolly back to finish his interrupted
drink, he found himself face to face with the little dancing
girl. Two smoking globes of brine welled from the pellucid depths
of her pure eyes and fell with a hot splash on his bronzed
hand.</p>
<p>"How can I ever thank you!" she cried. "You have saved me from
a fate far worse than death."</p>
<p>But the Ghost, who had faced death many times without a
flicker of a lash, was unable to face something he saw now in a
pair of big brown eyes. He took off his sombrero and twisted it
shyly in his big hands.</p>
<p>"Why, that's all right, ma'am," he gulped awkwardly. "Glad to
be of service to a lady any time."</p>
<p>By this time the two bartenders had thrown a table-cloth over
Faro Bill, carried the limp body into the back room, and returned
to their positions behind the bar. The crowd clustered about in
little groups, laughing and talking excitedly, and in a moment,
as the pianist began to hammer out a tune on the battered piano,
broke into the measures of a waltz.</p>
<p>In the wild West of those days, passions were primitive,
vengeance sudden, and retribution immediate.</p>
<p>Two dimples sentinelled a platoon of milk-white teeth.</p>
<p>"Won't you dance with me, Mr. Ghost?" she coaxed.</p>
<p>Thoughtfully he pondered on love's mystery. Pure but
passionate. Appearances against her, 'tis true. The foul breath
of slander. She worked in a bawdy-house but her heart was clean.
Outside of that, what can one say against her? He thought
pleasantly of murder. With child's eyes he regarded his extinct
enemies. Men died violently but cleanly, in the movies.
Bang-bang. Good-by, boys, I'm through. Through the head or
heart&mdash;a clean hole, no blood. He had kept innocency. Do
their guts or their brains come spilling out? Currant jelly where
a face was, the chin shot off. Or down there that other&mdash;His
arm beat the air like a wing: he writhed. If you lose that? Done,
die. He clutched his throat in his anguish.</p>
<p>They bent down eastward along Academy Street, having turned
right from the little caudal appendage that gave on the
northeastern corner of the Square. The boy's mind flamed with
bright streaming images, sharp as gems, mutable as chameleons.
His life was the shadow of a shadow, a play within a play. He
became the hero- actor-star, the lord of the cinema, and the
lover of a beautiful movie-queen, as heroic as his postures, with
a superior actuality for every make-believe. He was the Ghost and
he who played the Ghost, the cause that minted legend into
fact.</p>
<p>He was those heroes whom he admired, and the victor, in
beauty, nobility, and sterling worth, over those whom he despised
because they always triumphed and were forever good and pretty
and beloved of women. He was chosen and beloved of a bevy of
internationally renowned beauties, vampires and pure sweet girls
alike, with fruity blondes in the lead, all contesting for his
favors, and some of the least scrupulous resorting to underhand
practices in order to win him. Their pure eyes turned up to him
in everlasting close-ups: he feasted virtuously upon their
proffered lips and, conflict over, murder sanctified, and virtue
crowned, walked away with his siren into the convenient blaze of
a constantly setting sun.</p>
<p>With burning sidelong face he looked quickly up at Gant,
twisting his convulsive neck.</p>
<p>Across the street, a calcium glare from the corner light
bathed coldly the new brick facade of the Orpheum Theatre. All
This Week Gus Nolan and His Georgia Peaches. Also the Piedmont
Comedy Four and Miss Bobbie Dukane.</p>
<p>The theatre was dark, the second show was over. They stared
curiously across the street at the posters. In this cold silence
where were the Peaches? At the Athens now, upon the Square. They
always went there after. Gant looked at his watch. 11:12. Big
Bill Messier outside swinging his club and watching them. On the
counter stools a dozen bucks and ogling rakehells. I've got a car
outside. Dalliance under difficulties. Later, the Genevieve on
Liberty Street. They all stay there. Whisperings. Footfalls.
Raided.</p>
<p>Girls from good families, some of them, I suppose, Gant
thought.</p>
<p>Opposite the Baptist Church a hearse was drawn up before
Gorham's Undertaking Parlors. A light burned dimly through the
ferns. Who can that be? he wondered. Miss Annie Patton critically
ill. She's past eighty. Some lunger from New York. A little Jew
with a peaked face. Some one all the time. Await alike th'
inevitable hour. Ah, Lord!</p>
<p>With loss of hunger, he thought of undertaking and
undertakers, and in particular of Mr. Gorham. He was a man with
blond hair and white eyebrows.</p>
<p>Waited to marry her when that rich young Cuban died, so they
could take honeymoon to Havana.</p>
<p>They turned down Spring Street by the Baptist Church. This is
really like a city of the dead, Eugene thought. The town, rimmed
with frost, lay frozen below the stars in a cataleptic trance.
The animacy of life hung in abeyance. Nothing grew old, nothing
decayed, nothing died. It was triumph over time. If a great demon
snapped his fingers and stopped all life in the world for an
instant that should be a hundred years, who would know the
difference? Every man a Sleeping Beauty. If you're waking call me
early, call me early, mother dear.</p>
<p>He tried to see life and movement behind the walls, and
failed. He and Gant were all that lived. For a house betrays
nothing: there may be murder behind its very quiet face. He
thought that Troy should be like this&mdash;perfect, undecayed as
the day when Hector died. Only they burned it. To find old cities
as they were, unruined&mdash;the picture charmed him. The Lost
Atlantis. Ville d'Ys. The old lost towns, seasunken. Great vacant
ways, unrusted, echoed under his lonely feet; he haunted vast
arcades, he pierced the atrium, his shoes rang on the temple
flags.</p>
<p>Or to be, he lusciously meditated, left alone with a group of
pretty women in a town whence all the other people had fled from
some terror of plague, earthquake, volcano, or other menace to
which he, quite happily, was immune. Lolling his tongue
delicately, he saw himself loafing sybaritically through first-
class confectioners' and grocers' shops, gorging like an anaconda
on imported dainties: exquisite small fish from Russia, France,
and Sardinia; coal-black hams from England; ripe olives, brandied
peaches, and liqueur chocolates. He would loot old cellars for
fat Burgundies, crack the gold necks of earth-chilled bottles of
Pol Roger against the wall, and slake his noonday thirst at the
spouting bung of a great butt of M&uuml;nchener dunkels. When his
linen was soiled he would outfit himself anew with silk underwear
and the finest shirtings; he would have a new hat every day in
the week and new suits whenever he pleased.</p>
<p>He would occupy a new house every day, and sleep in a
different bed every night, selecting the most luxurious residence
ultimately for permanent occupancy, and bringing together in it
the richest treasures of every notable library in the city.
Finally, when he wanted a woman from the small group that
remained and that spent its time in weaving new enticements for
him, he would summons her by ringing out the number he had given
her on the Court House bell.</p>
<p>He wanted opulent solitude. His dark vision burned on kingdoms
under the sea, on windy castle crags, and on the deep elf
kingdoms at the earth's core. He groped for the doorless land of
faery, that illimitable haunted country that opened somewhere
below a leaf or a stone. And no birds sing.</p>
<p>More practically, he saw for himself great mansions in the
ground, grottoes buried in the deep heart of a hill, vast
chambers of brown earth, sumptuously appointed with his bee-like
plunder. Cool hidden cisterns would bring him air; from a
peephole in the hillside he could look down on a winding road and
see armed men seeking for him, or hear their thwarted gropings
overhead. He would pull fat fish from subterranean pools, his
great earth cellars would be stocked with old wine, he could loot
the world of its treasures, including the handsomest women, and
never be caught.</p>
<p>King Solomon's mines. She. Proserpine. Ali Baba. Orpheus and
Eurydice. Naked came I from my mother's womb. Naked shall I
return. Let the mothering womb of earth engulf me. Naked, a
valiant wisp of man, in vast brown limbs engulfed.</p>
<p>They neared the corner above Eliza's. For the first time the
boy noted that their pace had quickened, and that he had almost
broken into a trot in order to keep up with Gant's awkward
plunging strides.</p>
<p>His father was moaning softly with long quivering exhalations
of breath, and he had one hand clasped over his pain. The boy
spluttered idiotically with laughter. Gant turned a glance full
of reproach and physical torture upon him.</p>
<p>"Oh-h-h-h-h! Merciful God," he whined, "it's hurting me."</p>
<p>Abruptly, Eugene was touched with pity. For the first time he
saw plainly that great Gant had grown old. The sallow face had
yellowed and lost its sinew. The thin mouth was petulant. The
chemistry of decay had left its mark.</p>
<p>No, there was no return after this. Eugene saw now that Gant
was dying very slowly. The vast resiliency, the illimitable power
of former times had vanished. The big frame was breaking up
before him like a beached ship. Gant was sick. He was old.</p>
<p>He had a disease that is very common among old men who have
lived carelessly and lustily&mdash;enlargement of the prostate
gland. It was not often in itself a fatal disease&mdash;it was
more often one of the flags of age and death, but it was ugly and
uncomfortable. It was generally treated successfully by
surgery&mdash;the operation was not desperate. But Gant hated and
feared the knife: he listened eagerly to all persuasions against
it.</p>
<p>He had no gift for philosophy. He could not view with
amusement and detachment the death of the senses, the waning of
desire, the waxing of physical impotence. He fed hungrily,
lewdly, on all news of seduction: his amusement had in it the
eyes of eagerness, the hot breath of desire. He was incapable of
the pleasant irony by which the philosophic spirit mocks that
folly it is no longer able to enjoy.</p>
<p>Gant was incapable of resignation. He had the most burning of
all lusts&mdash;the lust of memory, the ravenous hunger of the
will which tries to waken what is dead. He had reached the time
of life when he read the papers greedily for news of death. As
friends and acquaintances died he shook his head with the
melancholy hypocrisy of old men, saying: "They're all going, one
by one. Ah, Lord! The old man will be the next." But he did not
believe it. Death was still for the others, not for himself.</p>
<p>He grew old very rapidly. He began to die before their
eyes&mdash;a quick age, and a slow death, impotent,
disintegrating, horrible because his life had been so much
identified with physical excess&mdash;huge drinking, huge eating,
huge rioting debauchery. It was fantastic and terrible to see the
great body waste. They began to watch the progress of his disease
with something of the horror with which one watches the movements
of a dog with a broken leg, before he is destroyed&mdash;a horror
greater than that one feels when a man has a similar hurt,
because a man may live without legs. A dog is all included in his
hide.</p>
<p>His wild bombast was tempered now by senile petulance. He
cursed and whined by intervals. At the dead of night he would
rise, full of pain and terror, blaspheming vilely against his God
at one moment, and frantically entreating forgiveness at the
next. Through all this tirade ran the high quivering exhalation
of physical pain&mdash;actual and undeniable.</p>
<p>"Oh-h-h-h! I curse the day I was born!...I curse the day I was
given life by that bloodthirsty Monster up above...Oh-h-h- h-h!
Jesus! I beg of you. I know I've been bad. Forgive me. Have mercy
and pity upon me! Give me another chance, in Jesus'
name...Oh-h-h-h-h!"</p>
<p>Eugene had moments of furious anger because of these
demonstrations. He was angry that Gant, having eaten his cake,
now howled because he had stomach-ache and at the same time
begged for more. Bitterly he reflected that his father's life had
devoured whatever had served it, and that few men had had more
sensuous enjoyment, or had been more ruthless in their demands on
others. He found these exhibitions, these wild denunciations and
cowardly grovellings in propitiation of a God none of them paid
any attention to in health, ugly and abominable. The constant
meditation of both Gant and Eliza on the death of others, their
morbid raking of the news for items announcing the death of some
person known to them, their weird absorption with the death of
some toothless hag who, galled by bedsores, at length found
release after her eightieth year, while fire, famine, and
slaughter in other parts of the world passed unnoticed by them,
their extravagant superstition over what was local and
unimportant, seeing the intervention of God in the death of a
peasant, and the suspension of divine law and natural order in
their own, filled him with choking fury.</p>
<p>But Eliza was in splendid condition now to ponder upon the
death of others. Her health was perfect. She was in her
middle-fifties: she had grown triumphantly stronger after the
diseases of the middle years. White, compact, a great deal
heavier now than she had ever been, she performed daily tasks of
drudgery in the maintenance of Dixieland, that would have floored
a strong negro. She hardly ever got to bed before two o'clock in
the morning, and was up again before seven.</p>
<p>She admitted her health grudgingly. She made the most of every
ache, and she infuriated Gant by meeting every complaint with a
corresponding account of her own disorders. When badgered by
Helen because of her supposed neglect of the sick man or when the
concentration of attention upon the invalid piqued her jealousy,
she smiled with white tremulous bitterness, hinting darkly:</p>
<p>"He may not be the first to go. I had a premonition&mdash;I
don't know what else you'd call it&mdash;the other day. I tell
you what&mdash;it may not be long now&mdash;" Her eyes bleared
with pity&mdash;shaking her puckered mouth, she wept at her own
funeral.</p>
<p>"Good heavens, mama!" Helen burst out furiously. "There's
nothing wrong with you. Papa's a sick man! Don't you realize
that?"</p>
<p>She didn't.</p>
<p>"Pshaw!" she said. "There's nothing much wrong with him.
McGuire told me two men out of three have it after they're
fifty."</p>
<p>His body as it sickened distilled a green bile of hatred
against her crescent health. It made him mad to see her stand so
strong. Murderous impotent, baffled&mdash;a maniacal anger
against her groped for an outlet in him, sometimes exploding in a
wild inchoate scream.</p>
<p>He yielded weakly to invalidism, he became tyrannous of
attention, jealous of service. Her indifference to his health
maddened him, created a morbid hunger for pity and tears. At
times he got insanely drunk and tried to frighten her by feigning
death, one time so successfully that Ben, bending over his rigid
form in the hallway, was whitened with conviction.</p>
<p>"I can't feel his heart, mama," he said, with a nervous
whicker of his lips.</p>
<p>"Well," she said, picking her language with deliberate
choosiness, "the pitcher went to the well once too often. I knew
it would happen sooner or later."</p>
<p>Through a slotted eye he glared murderously at her.
Judicially, with placid folded hands, she studied him. Her calm
eye caught the slow movement of a stealthy inhalation.</p>
<p>"You get his purse, son, and any papers he may have," she
directed. "I'll call the undertaker."</p>
<p>With an infuriate scream the dead awakened.</p>
<p>"I thought that would bring you to," she said
complacently.</p>
<p>He scrambled to his feet.</p>
<p>"You hell-hound!" he yelled. "You would drink my heart's
blood. You are without mercy and without pity&mdash;inhuman and
bloody monster that you are."</p>
<p>"Some day," Eliza observed, "you'll cry wolf-wolf once too
often."</p>
<p>He went three times a week to Cardiac's office for treatment.
The dry doctor had grown old; behind his dusty restraint, the
prim authority of his manner, there was a deepening well of
senile bawdry. He had a comfortable fortune, he cared little for
his dwindling practice. He was still a brilliant bacteriologist:
he spent hours over slides etched in flowering patterns of
bacilli, and he was sought after by diseased prostitutes, to whom
he rendered competent service.</p>
<p>He dissuaded the Gants from surgery. He was jealously absorbed
in the treatment of Gant's disease, scoffed at operations, and
insisted he could give adequate relief by manipulation of the
affected parts and the use of the catheter.</p>
<p>The two men became devoted friends. The doctor gave up entire
mornings to the treatment of Gant's disease. The consulting-room
was filled with their sly laughter while scrofulous mountaineers
glared dully at the pages of Life in the antechamber. As Gant
sprawled out voluptuously on the table after his masseur had
finished his work, he listened appreciatively to the secrets of
light women, or to tidbits from books of pseudoscientific
pornography, of which the doctor had a large number.</p>
<p>"You say," he demanded eagerly, "that the monks petitioned the
archbishop?"</p>
<p>"Yes," said the doctor. "They suffered during the hot weather.
He wrote 'granted' across the petition. Here's a photograph of
the document." He held the book open in his clean parched
fingers.</p>
<p>"Merciful God!" said Gant, staring. "I suppose it's pretty bad
in those hot countries."</p>
<p>He licked his thumb, smiling lewdly to himself. The late Oscar
Wilde, for instance.</p>
<h3>21</h3>
<p>During the first years of this illness Gant showed a
diminished, but not a seriously impaired, energy. At first he
had, under the doctor's treatment, periods of tranquillity when
he almost believed himself well. There were also times when he
became a whining dotard over night, lay indolently abed for days,
and was flabbily acquiescent to his disorder. These climaxes
usually came on the heels of a roaring spree. The saloons had
been closed for years: the town had been one of the first to vote
on "local option."</p>
<p>Gant had piously contributed his vote for purity. Eugene
remembered the day, years before, when he went proudly with his
father to the polls. The militant "drys" had agreed to advertise
their vote by wearing a scrap of white silk in their lapels. That
was for purity. The defiant wets wore "red."</p>
<p>Announced by violent trumpetings in the Protestant churches,
the day of atonement dawned on a seasoned army of well drilled
teetotalers. Those wets who had victoriously withstood the
pressure of hearth and pulpit&mdash;their number (ai&euml;,
ai&euml;,) was small&mdash;went to their death with the gallant
swagger, and with the gleam of purloined honor, of men who are to
die fighting most desperately against the engulfing mob.</p>
<p>They did not know how gallant was their cause: they knew only
that they had stood against the will of a priest-ridden
community&mdash;the most annihilating force in the village. They
had never been told they stood for liberty; they stood rubily,
stubbornly, with the strong brown smell of shame in their
nostrils, for the bloodshot, malt-mouthed, red-nosed,
loose-pursed Demon Rum. So, they came down with vine leaves in
their hair, and a good fog of rye upon their breaths, and with
brave set smiles around their determined mouths.</p>
<p>As they approached the polls, glancing, like surrounded
knights, for an embattled brother, the church women of the town,
bent like huntresses above the straining leash, gave the word to
the eager children of the Sunday schools. Dressed all in white,
and clutching firmly in their small hands the tiny stems of
American flags, the pigmies, monstrous as only children can be
when they become the witless mouths of slogans and crusades,
charged hungrily, uttering their shrill cries, upon their
Gulliver.</p>
<p>"There he is, children. Go get him."</p>
<p>Swirling around the marked man in wild elves' dance, they sang
with piping empty violence:</p>
<blockquote>"We are some fond mother's treasure,<br>
Men and women of to-morrow,<br>
For a moment's empty pleasure<br>
Would you give us lifelong sorrow?<br>
<br>
Think of sisters, wives, and mothers,<br>
Of helpless babes in some low slum,<br>
Think not of yourself, but others,<br>
Vote against the Demon Rum."</blockquote>
<p>Eugene shuddered, and looked up at Gant's white emblem with
coy pride. They walked happily by unhappy alcoholics, deltaed in
foaming eddies of innocence, and smiling murderously down at some
fond mother's treasure.</p>
<p>If they were mine I'd warm their little tails, they
thought&mdash;privately.</p>
<p>Outside the corrugated walls of the warehouse, Gant paused for
a moment to acknowledge the fervent congratulation of a group of
ladies from the First Baptist Church: Mrs. Tarkinton, Mrs. Fagg
Sluder, Mrs. C. M. McDonnel, and Mrs. W. H. (Pert) Pentland, who,
heavily powdered, trailed her long skirt of gray silk with a
musty rustle, and sneered elegantly down over her whaleboned
collar. She was very fond of Gant.</p>
<p>"Where's Will?" he asked.</p>
<p>"Feathering the pockets of the licker interests, when he ought
to be down here doing the Lord's Work," she replied with
Christian bitterness. "Nobody but you knows what I've had to put
up with, Mr. Gant. You've had to put up with the queer Pentland
streak, in your own home," she added with lucid significance.</p>
<p>He shook his head regretfully, and stared sorrowfully at the
gutter.</p>
<p>"Ah, Lord, Pett! We've been through the mill&mdash;both of
us."</p>
<p>A smell of drying roots and sassafras twisted a sharp spiral
from the warehouse into the thin slits of his nostrils.</p>
<p>"When the time comes to speak up for the right," Pett
announced to several of the ladies, "you'll always find Will Gant
ready to do his part."</p>
<p>With far-seeing statesmanship he looked westward toward
Pisgah.</p>
<p>"Licker," he said, "is a curse and a care. It has caused the
sufferings of untold millions&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Amen, Amen," Mrs. Tarkinton chanted softly, swaying her wide
hips rhythmically.</p>
<p>"&mdash;it has brought poverty, disease, and suffering to
hundreds of thousands of homes, broken the hearts of wives and
mothers, and taken bread from the mouths of little orphaned
children."</p>
<p>"Amen, brother."</p>
<p>"It has been," Gant began, but at this moment his uneasy eye
lighted upon the broad red face of Tim O'Doyle and the fierce
whiskered whiskiness of Major Ambrose Nethersole, two prominent
publicans, who were standing near the entrance not six feet away
and listening attentively.</p>
<p>"Go on!" Major Nethersole urged, with the deep chest notes of
a bullfrog. "Go on, W. O., but for God's sake, don't belch!"</p>
<p>"Begod!" said Tim O'Doyle, wiping a tiny rill of tobacco juice
from the thick simian corner of his mouth, "I've seen him start
for the door and step through the windey. When we see him coming
we hire two extra bottle openers. He used to give the barman a
bonus to get up early."</p>
<p>"Pay no attention to them, ladies, I beg of you," said Gant
scathingly. "They are the lowest of the low, the whisky-besotted
dregs of humanity, who deserve to bear not even the name of men,
so far have they retrograded backwards."</p>
<p>With a flourishing sweep of his slouch hat he departed into
the warehouse.</p>
<p>"By God!" said Ambrose Nethersole approvingly. "It takes W. O.
to tie a knot in the tail of the English language. It always
did."</p>
<p>But within two months he moaned bitterly his unwetted thirst.
For several years he ordered, from time to time, the alloted
quota&mdash;a gallon of whisky every two weeks&mdash;from
Baltimore. It was the day of the blind tiger. The town was mined
thickly with them. Bad rye and moonshine corn were the prevailing
beverages. He grew old, he was sick, he still drank.</p>
<p>A slow trickle of lust crawled painfully down the parched
gulley of desire, and ended feebly in dry fumbling lechery. He
made pretty young summer widows at Dixieland presents of money,
underwear, and silk stockings, which he drew on over their
shapely legs in the dusty gloom of his little office. Smiling
with imperturbable tenderness, Mrs. Selborne thrust out her heavy
legs slowly to swell with warm ripe smack his gift of flowered
green-silk garters. Wetting his thumb with sly thin aftersmile,
he told.</p>
<p>A grass widow, forty-nine, with piled hair of dyed henna,
corseted breasts and hips architecturally protuberant in a sharp
diagonal, meaty mottled arms, and a gulched face of leaden
flaccidity puttied up brightly with cosmetics, rented the
upstairs of Woodson Street while Helen was absent.</p>
<p>"She looks like an adventuress, hey?" said Gant hopefully.</p>
<p>She had a son. He was fourteen, with a round olive face, a
soft white body, and thin legs. He bit his nails intently. His
hair and eyes were dark, his face full of sad stealth. He was
wise and made himself unobtrusively scarce at proper times.</p>
<p>Gant came home earlier. The widow rocked brightly on the
porch. He bowed sweepingly, calling her Madam. Coy-kittenish, she
talked down at him, slogged against the creaking stair rail. She
leered cosily at him. She came and went freely through his
sitting-room, where he now slept. One evening, just after he had
entered, she came in from the bathroom, scented lightly with the
best soap, and beefily moulded into a flame-red kimono.</p>
<p>A handsome woman yet, he thought. Good evening, madam.</p>
<p>He got up from his rocker, put aside the crackling sheets of
the evening paper (Republican), and undipped his steel-rimmed
glasses from the great blade of his nose.</p>
<p>She came over with sprightly gait to the empty hearth,
clasping her wrapper tightly with veinous hands.</p>
<p>Swiftly, with a gay leer, she opened the garment, disclosing
her thin legs, silkshod, and her lumpy hips, gaudily clothed in
ruffled drawers of blue silk.</p>
<p>"Aren't they pretty?" she twittered invitingly but obscurely.
Then, as he took an eager stride forward, she skipped away like a
ponderous maenad soliciting Bacchic pursuit.</p>
<p>"A pair of pippins," he agreed, inclusively.</p>
<p>After this, she prepared breakfast for him. From Dixieland,
Eliza surveyed them with a bitter eye. He had no talent for
concealment. His visits morning and evening were briefer, his
tongue more benevolent.</p>
<p>"I know what you're up to down there," she said. "You needn't
think I don't."</p>
<p>He grinned sheepishly and wet his thumb. Her mouth worked
silently at attempted speech for a moment. She speared a frying
steak and flipped it over on its raw back, smiling vengefully in
a mounting column of greasy blue vapor. He poked her clumsily
with his stiff fingers; she shrieked a protest mixed of anger and
amusement, and moved awkwardly out of his reach with bridling
gait.</p>
<p>"Get away! I don't want you round me! It's too late for that."
She laughed with nagging mockery.</p>
<p>"Don't you wish you could, though? I'll vow!" she continued,
kneading her lips for several seconds in an effort to speak. "I'd
be ashamed. Every one's laughing at you behind your back."</p>
<p>"You lie! By God, you lie!" he thundered magnificently,
touched. Hammer-hurling Thor.</p>
<p>But he tired very quickly of his new love. He was weary, and
frightened by his depletion. For a time he gave the widow small
sums of money, and forgot the rent. He transferred to her his
storming abuse, muttered ominously to himself in long
aisle-pacings at his shop, when he saw that he had lost the
ancient freedom of his house and saddled himself with a tyrannous
hag. One evening he returned insanely drunk, routed her out of
her chamber and pursued her unfrocked, untoothed, unputtied, with
a fluttering length of kimono in her palsied hand, driving her
finally into the yard beneath the big cherry tree, which he
circled, howling, making frantic lunges for her as she twittered
with fear, casting splintered glances all over the listening
neighborhood as she put on the crumpled wrapper, hid partially
the indecent jigging of her breasts, and implored succor. It did
not come.</p>
<p>"You bitch!" he screamed. "I'll kill you. You have drunk my
heart's-blood, you have driven me to the brink of destruction,
and you gloat upon my misery, listening with fiendish delight to
my death-rattle, bloody and unnatural monster that you are."</p>
<p>She kept the tree deftly between them and, when his attention
was diverted for a moment to the flood of anathema, tore off on
fear- quick feet, streetward to the haven of the Tarkintons'
house. As she rested there, in Mrs. Tarkinton's consolatory arms,
weeping hysterically and dredging gullies in her poor painted
face, they heard his chaotic footsteps blundering within his
house, the heavy crash of furniture, and his fierce curses when
he fell.</p>
<p>"He'll kill himself! He'll kill himself!" she cried. "He
doesn't know what he's doing. Oh, my God!" she wept. "I've never
been talked to that way by any man in my life!"</p>
<p>Gant fell heavily within his house. There was silence. She
rose fearfully.</p>
<p>"He's not a bad man," she whispered.</p>
<p>One morning in early summer, after Helen had returned, Eugene
was wakened by scuffling feet and excited cries along the small
boardwalk that skirted the house on its upper side and led to the
playhouse, a musty little structure of pine with a single big
room, which he could almost touch from the sloping roof that
flowed about his gabled backroom window. The playhouse was
another of the strange extravagancies of Gantian fancy: it had
been built for the children when they were young. It had been for
many years closed, it was a retreat of delight; its imprisoned
air, stale and cool, was scented permanently with old pine
boards, cased books, and dusty magazines.</p>
<p>For some weeks now it had been occupied by Mrs. Selborne's
South Carolina cook, Annie, a plump comely negress of
thirty-five, with a rich coppery skin. The woman had come into
the mountains for the summer: she was a good cook and expected
work at hotels or boarding-houses. Helen engaged her for five
dollars a week. It was an act of pride.</p>
<p>That morning, Gant had wakened earlier and stared at his
ceiling thoughtfully. He had risen, dressed, and wearing his
leather slippers, walked softly back, along the boards, to the
playhouse. Helen was roused by Annie's loud protests. Tingling
with premonition she came down stairs, and found Gant wringing
his hands and moaning as he walked up and down the washroom.
Through the open doors she heard the negress complaining loudly
to herself as she banged out drawers and slammed her belongings
together.</p>
<p>"I ain't used to no such goins-on. I'se a married woman, I is.
I ain't goin' to say in dis house anothah minnit."</p>
<p>Helen turned furiously upon Gant and shook him.</p>
<p>"You rotten old thing, you!" she cried. "How dare you!"</p>
<p>"Merciful God!" he whined, stamping his foot like a child, and
pacing up and down. "Why did this have to come upon me in my old
age!" He began to sniffle affectedly. "Boo-hoo-hoo! O Jesus, it's
fearful, it's awful, it's cruel that you should put this
affliction on me." His contempt for reason was Parnassian. He
accused God for exposing him; he wept because he had been
caught.</p>
<p>Helen rushed out to the playhouse and with large gesture and
hearty entreaty strove to appease outraged Annie.</p>
<p>"Come on, Annie," she coaxed. "I'll give you a dollar a week
more if you stay. Forget about it!"</p>
<p>"No'm," said Annie stubbornly. "I cain't stay heah any longer.
I'se afraid of dat man."</p>
<p>Gant paused in his distracted pacing from time to time long
enough to cock an eager ear. At each iteration of Annie's firm
refusals, he fetched out a deep groan and took up his lament
again.</p>
<p>Luke, who had descended, had fidgeted about in a nervous
prance from one large bare foot to another. Now he went to the
door and looked out, bursting suddenly into a large Whah-Whah as
he caught sight of the sullen respectability of the negress'
expression. Helen came back into the house with an angry
perturbed face.</p>
<p>"She'll tell this all over town," she announced.</p>
<p>Gant moaned in lengthy exhalations. Eugene, shocked at first,
and frightened, flung madly across the kitchen linoleum in
twisting leaps, falling catlike on his bare soles. He squealed
ecstatically at Ben who loped in scowling, and began to snicker
in short contemptuous fragments.</p>
<p>"And of course she'll tell Mrs. Selborne all about it, as soon
as she goes back to Henderson," Helen continued.</p>
<p>"O my God!" Gant whined, "why was this put on me&mdash;"</p>
<p>"O gotohell! Gotohell!" she said comically, her wrath loosened
suddenly by a ribald and exasperated smile. They howled.</p>
<p>"I shall dy-ee."</p>
<p>Eugene choked in faint hiccoughs and began to slide gently
down the kitchen-washroom door jamb.</p>
<p>"Ah! you little idiot!" Ben snarled, lifting his white hand
sharply. He turned away quickly with a flickering smile.</p>
<p>At this moment, Annie appeared on the walk outside the door,
with a face full of grieved decorum.</p>
<p>Luke looked nervously and gravely from his father to the
negress, fidgeting from one big foot to the other.</p>
<p>"I'se a married woman," said Annie. "I ain't used to nothin'
like dis. I wants my money."</p>
<p>Luke blew up in an explosion of wild laughter.</p>
<p>"Whah-whah!" He pronged her larded ribs with scooped fingers.
She moved away angrily, muttering.</p>
<p>Eugene lolled about feebly on the floor, kicking one leg out
gently as if he had just been decapitated, and fumbling blindly
at the neckband of his nightshirt. A faint clucking sound came at
intervals from his wide-open mouth.</p>
<p>They laughed wildly, helplessly, draining into mad laughter
all the welled and agglutinated hysteria that had gathered in
them, washing out in a moment of fierce surrender all the fear
and fatality of their lives, the pain of age and death.</p>
<p>Dying, he walked among them, whining his lament against God's
lidless stare, gauging their laughter cautiously with uneasy
prying eyes, a faint tickled grin playing craftily about his
wailing mouth.</p>
<p>Roofing the deep tides, swinging in their embrace, rocked
Eliza's life Sargassic, as when, at morning, a breath of kitchen
air squirmed through her guarded crack of door, and fanned the
pendant clusters of old string in floating rhythm. She rubbed the
sleep gently from her small weak eyes, smiling dimly as she
thought, unwakened, of ancient losses. Her worn fingers still
groped softly in the bed beside her, and when she found it
vacant, she awoke. Remembered. My youngest, my oldest, final
bitter fruit, O dark of soul, O far and lonely, where? Remembered
O his face! Death-son, partner of my peril, last coinage of my
flesh, who warmed my flanks and nestled to my back. Gone? Cut off
from me? When? Where?</p>
<p>The screen slammed, the market boy dumped ground sausage on
the table, a negress fumbled at the stove. Awake now.</p>
<p>Ben moved quietly, but not stealthily, about, confessing and
denying nothing. His thin laughter pierced the darkness softly
above the droning creak of the wooden porch-swing. Mrs. Pert
laughed gently, comfortingly. She was forty-three: a large woman
of gentle manners, who drank a great deal. When she was drunk,
her voice was soft, low, and fuzzy, she laughed uncertainly,
mildly, and walked with careful alcoholic gravity. She dressed
well: she was well fleshed, but not sensual-looking. She had good
features, soft oaken hair, blue eyes, a little bleared. She
laughed with a comfortable, happy chuckle. They were all very
fond of her. Helen called her "Fatty."</p>
<p>Her husband was a drug salesman: he travelled through
Tennessee, Arkansas, and Mississippi, and returned to Altamont
for a fortnight every four months. Her daughter, Catherine, who
was almost Ben's age, came to Dixieland for a few weeks each
summer. She was a school-teacher in a public school in a
Tennessee village. Ben squired both.</p>
<p>Mrs. Pert chuckled softly when she spoke to him, and called
him "Old Ben." In the darkness he sat, talking a little, humming
a little, laughing occasionally in his thin minor key, quietly,
with a cigarette between his forked ivory fingers, drawing
deeply. He would buy a flask of whisky and they would drink it
very quietly. Perhaps they talked a little more. But they were
never riotous. Occasionally, they would rise at midnight from the
swing, and go out into the street, departing under leafy trees.
They would not return during the night. Eliza, ironing out a
great pile of rumpled laundry in the kitchen, would listen.
Presently, she would mount the stairs, peer carefully into Mrs.
Pert's room, and descend, her lips thoughtfully kneaded.</p>
<p>She had to speak these things to Helen. There was a strange
defiant communion between them. They laughed or were bitter
together.</p>
<p>"Why, of course," said Helen, impatiently, "I've known it all
along." But she looked beyond the door curiously, her big gold-
laced teeth half-shown in her open mouth, the child look of
belief, wonder, skepticism, and hurt innocency in her big
highboned face.</p>
<p>"Do you suppose he really does? Oh surely not mama. She's old
enough to be his mother."</p>
<p>Across Eliza's white puckered face, thoughtful and reproving,
a sly smile broke. She rubbed her finger under the broad wings of
her nose to conceal it, and snickered.</p>
<p>"I tell you what!" she said. "He's a chip off the old block.
His father over again," she whispered. "It's in the blood."</p>
<p>Helen laughed huskily, picking vaguely at her chin, and gazing
out across the weedy garden.</p>
<p>"Poor old Ben!" she said, and her eyes, she did not know why,
were sheeted with tears. "Well, 'Fatty's' a lady. I like
her&mdash;I don't care who knows it," she added defiantly. "It's
their business anyway. They're quiet about it. You've got to say
that much for them."</p>
<p>She was silent a moment.</p>
<p>"Women are crazy about him," she said. "They like the quiet
ones, don't they? He's a gentleman."</p>
<p>Eliza shook her head portentously for several moments.</p>
<p>"What do you think!" she whispered, and shook her pursed lips
again. "Always ten years older at least."</p>
<p>"Poor old Ben!" Helen said again.</p>
<p>"The quiet one, the sad one. I tell you what!" Eliza shook her
head, unable to speak. Her eyes too were wet.</p>
<p>They thought of sons and lovers: they drew closer in their
communion, they drank the cup of their twin slavery as they
thought of the Gant men who would always know hunger, the
strangers on the land, the unknown farers who had lost their way.
O lost!</p>
<p>The hands of women were hungry for his crisp hair. When they
came to the paper office to insert advertisements they asked for
him. Frowning gravely, he leaned upon the counter with feet
crossed, reading, in a somewhat illiterate monotone, what they
had written. His thin hairy wrists slatted leanly against his
starched white cuffs, his strong nervous fingers, ivoried by
nicotine, smoothed out the crumples. Scowling intently, he bent
his fine head, erasing, arranging. Emphatic lady-fingers
twitched. "How's that?" Answers vague-voiced, eyes tangled in
crisp hair. "Oh, much better, thank you."</p>
<p>Wanted: frowning boy-man head for understanding fingers of
mature and sympathetic woman. Unhappily married. Address Mrs. B.
J. X., Box 74. Eight cents a word for one insertion. "Oh,
[tenderly] thank you, Ben."</p>
<p>"Ben," said Jack Eaton, the advertising manager, thrusting his
plump face into the city editor's office, "one of your harem's
out there. She wanted to murder me when I tried to take it. See
if she's got a friend."</p>
<p>"Oh, listen to this, won't you?" Ben snickered fiercely to the
City Editor. "You missed your calling, Eaton. What you want is
the endman's job with Honeyboy Evans."</p>
<p>Scowling, he cast the cigarette from his ivory hand, and loped
out into the office. Eaton remained a moment to laugh with the
City Editor. O rare Ben Gant!</p>
<p>Sometimes, returning late at night to Woodson Street, in the
crowded summer season, he slept with Eugene in the front room
upstairs where they had all been born. Propped high on pillows in
the old cream-colored bed, painted gaily at head and foot with
round medals of clustering fruit, he read aloud in a quiet
puzzled voice, fumbling over pronunciation, the baseball stories
of Ring Lardner. "You know me, Al." Just outside the windows the
flat veranda roof was still warm from its daytime exhalations of
tar- calked tin. Rich cob-webbed grapes hung in packed clusters
among the broad leaves. "I didn't raise my boy to be a southpaw.
I've a good mind to give Gleason a sock in the eye."</p>
<p>Ben read painfully, pausing a moment later to snicker. Thus,
like a child, he groped intently at all meanings, with scowling
studiousness. Women liked to see him scowl and study so. He was
sudden only in anger, and in his quick communications with his
angel.</p>
<h3>22</h3>
<p>Toward the beginning of Eugene's fourteenth year, when he had
been a student at Leonard's for two years, Ben got work for him
as a paper carrier. Eliza grumbled at the boy's laziness. She
complained that she could get him to do little or nothing for
her. In fact, he was not lazy, but he hated all the dreariness of
boarding-house routine. Her demands on him were not heavy, but
they were frequent and unexpected. He was depressed at the
uselessness of effort in Dixieland, at the total erasure of all
daily labor. If she had given him position, the daily
responsibility of an ordered task, he could have fulfilled it
with zeal. But her own method was much too random: she wanted to
keep him on tap for an occasional errand, and he did not have her
interest.</p>
<p>Dixieland was the heart of her life. It owned her. It appalled
him. When she sent him to the grocer's for bread, he felt wearily
that the bread would be eaten by strangers, that nothing out of
the effort of their lives grew younger, better, or more
beautiful, that all was erased in a daily wash of sewage. She
sent him forth in the rank thicket of her garden to hoe out the
swarming weeds that clustered about her vegetables, which
flourished, as did all the earth, under her careless touch. He
knew, as he chopped down in a weary frenzy, that the weeds would
grow again in the hot sun- stench, that her
vegetables&mdash;weeded or not&mdash;would grow fat and be fed to
her boarders, and that her life, hers alone, would endure to
something. As he looked at her, he felt the weariness and horror
of time: all but her must die in a smothering Sargasso. Thus,
flailing the clotted earth drunkenly, he would be brought to
suddenly by her piercing scream from the high back porch, and
realize that he had destroyed totally a row of young bladed
corn.</p>
<p>"Why, what on earth, boy!" she fretted angrily, peering down
at him through a shelving confusion of wash-tubs, limp drying
stockings, empty milk-bottles, murky and unwashed, and rusty
lard-buckets. "I'll vow!" she said, turning to Mr. Baskett, the
Hattiesburg cotton merchant, who grinned down malarially through
his scraggly mustaches, "what am I going to do with him? He's
chopped down every stock of corn in the row."</p>
<p>"Yes," Mr. Baskett said, peering over, "and missed every weed.
Boy," he added judicially, "you need two months on a farm."</p>
<p>The bread that I fetch will be eaten by strangers. I carry
coal and split up wood for fires to warm them. Smoke. Fuimas
fumus. All of our life goes up in smoke. There is no structure,
no creation in it, not even the smoky structure of dreams. Come
lower, angel; whisper in our ears. We are passing away in smoke
and there is nothing to-day but weariness to pay for yesterday's
toil. How may we save ourselves?</p>
<p>He was given the Niggertown route&mdash;the hardest and least
profitable of all. He was paid two cents a copy for weekly
deliveries, given ten per cent of his weekly collections, and ten
cents for every new subscription. Thus, he was able to earn four
or five dollars a week. His thin undeveloped body drank sleep
with insatiable thirst, but it was now necessary for him to get
up at half-past three in the morning with darkness and silence
making an unreal humming in his drugged ears.</p>
<p>Strange aerial music came fluting out of darkness, or over his
slow-wakening senses swept the great waves of symphonic
orchestration. Fiend-voices, beautiful and sleep-loud, called
down through darkness and light, developing the thread of ancient
memory.</p>
<p>Staggering blindly in the whitewashed glare, his eyes,
sleep-corded opened slowly as he was born anew, umbilically cut,
from darkness.</p>
<p>Waken, ghost-eared boy, but into darkness. Waken, phantom, O
into us. Try, try, O try the way. Open the wall of light. Ghost,
ghost, who is the ghost? O lost. Ghost, ghost, who is the ghost?
O whisper-tongued laughter. Eugene! Eugene! Here, O here, Eugene.
Here, Eugene. The way is here, Eugene. Have you forgotten? The
leaf, the rock, the wall of light. Lift up the rock, Eugene, the
leaf, the stone, the unfound door. Return, return.</p>
<p>A voice, sleep-strange and loud, forever far-near, spoke.</p>
<p>Eugene!</p>
<p>Spoke, ceased, continued without speaking, to speak. In him
spoke. Where darkness, son, is light. Try, boy, the word you know
remember. In the beginning was the logos. Over the border the
borderless green-forested land. Yesterday, remember?</p>
<p>Far-forested, a horn-note wound. Sea-forested, water-far, the
grotted coral sea-far horn-note. The pillioned ladies witch-faced
in bottle-green robes saddle-swinging. Merwomen unsealed and
lovely in sea-floor colonnades. The hidden land below the rock.
The flitting wood-girls growing into bark. Far-faint, as he
wakened, they besought him with lessening whir. Then deeper song,
fiend-throated, wind-shod. Brother, O brother! They shot down the
brink of darkness, gone on the wind like bullets. O lost, and by
the wind grieved, ghost, come back again.</p>
<p>He dressed and descended the stairs gently to the back porch.
The cool air, charged with blue starlight, shocked his body into
wakefulness, but as he walked townward up the silent streets, the
strange ringing in his ears persisted. He listened like his own
ghost, to his footsteps, heard from afar the winking flicker of
the street-lamps, saw, from sea-sunk eyes, the town.</p>
<p>There sounded in his heart a solemn music. It filled the
earth, the air, the universe; it was not loud, but it was
omnipresent, and it spoke to him of death and darkness, and of
the focal march of all who lived or had lived, converging on a
plain. The world was filled with silent marching men: no word was
spoken, but in the heart of each there was a common knowledge,
the word that all men knew and had forgotten, the lost key
opening the prison gates, the lane-end into heaven, and as the
music soared and filled him, he cried: "I will remember. When I
come to the place, I shall know."</p>
<p>Hot bands of light streamed murkily from the doors and windows
of the office. From the press-room downstairs there was an
ascending roar as the big press mounted to its capacity. As he
entered the office and drank in the warm tides of steel and ink
that soaked the air, he awoke suddenly, his light-drugged limbs
solidifying with a quick shock, as would some aerial spirit,
whose floating body corporealizes the instant it touches earth.
The carriers, waiting in a boisterous line, filed up to the
circulation manager's desk, depositing their collections, cold
handfuls of greasy coin. Seated beneath a green-shaded light, he
ran swiftly down their books, totalling up their figures and
counting nickels, dimes, and pennies into little spooned trays of
a drawer. Then he gave to each a scrawled order for his morning
quota.</p>
<p>They ran downstairs, eager as whippets to be off, brandishing
their slips at a sullen counter whose black fingers galloped
accurately across the stiff ridges of a great sheaf. He allowed
them two "extras." If the carrier was not scrupulous, he
increased his number of spare copies by keeping on his book the
names of a half- dozen discontinued subscribers. These surplus
copies were always good for coffee and pie with the lunchman, or
as tribute to a favorite policeman, fireman, or motorman.</p>
<p>In the press-pit Harry Tugman loafed under their stare
comfortably, a fat trickle of cigarette smoke coiling from his
nostrils. He glanced over the press with professional
carelessness, displaying his powerful chest with its thick bush,
which lay a dark blot under his sweat-wet under-shirt. An
assistant pressman climbed nimbly among roaring pistons and
cylinders, an oil-can and a bunch of waste in his hand. A broad
river of white paper rushed constantly up from the cylinder and
leaped into a mangling chaos of machinery whence it emerged a
second later, cut, printed, folded and stacked, sliding along a
board with a hundred others in a fattening sheaf.</p>
<p>Machine-magic! Why not men, like that? Doctor, surgeon, poet,
priest&mdash;stacked, folded, printed.</p>
<p>Harry Tugman cast away his wet fragment of cigarette with a
luxurious grimace. The carriers eyed him reverently. Once he had
knocked a sub-pressman down for sitting in his chair. He was
Boss. He got $55 a week. If he was not pleased he could get work
at any time on the New Orleans Times-Picayune, the Louisville
Courier Journal, the Atlanta Constitution, the Knoxville
Sentinel, the Norfolk Pilot. He could travel.</p>
<p>In a moment more they were out on the streets, hobbling along
rapidly under the accustomed weight of the crammed canvas
bags.</p>
<p>He was most desperately afraid of failure. He listened with
constricted face to Eliza's admonition.</p>
<p>"Spruce up, boy! Spruce up! Make them think you are
somebody!"</p>
<p>He had little confidence in himself; he recoiled in advance
from the humiliation of dismissal. He feared the sabre-cut of
language, and before his own pride he drew back and was
afraid.</p>
<p>For three mornings he accompanied the retiring carrier,
gathering his mind to focal intensity while he tried to memorize
each stereotyped movement of the delivery, tracing again and
again the labyrinthine web of Niggertown, wreaking his plan out
among the sprawled chaos of clay and slime, making incandescent
those houses to which a paper was delivered, and forgetting the
others. Years later, alone in darkness, when he had forgotten the
twisted anarchy of that pattern, he still remembered a corner
where he left his bag while he climbed a spur of hill, a bank
down which he clambered to three rotting shacks, a high porched
house into which accurately he shot his folded block of news.</p>
<p>The retiring carrier was a robust country boy of seventeen who
had been given better employment at the paper office. His name
was Jennings Ware. He was tough, good-humored, a little cynical,
and he smoked a great many cigarettes. He was clothed in vitality
and comfort. He taught his pupil when and where to expect the
prying face of "Foxy," how to escape discovery under the
lunchroom counter, and how to fold a paper and throw it with the
speed and accuracy of a ball.</p>
<p>In the fresh pre-natal morning they began their route, walking
down the steep hill of Valley Street into tropical sleep, past
the stabled torpor of black sleepers, past all the illicit loves,
the casual and innumerable adulteries of Niggertown. As the stiff
block of paper thudded sharply on the flimsy porch of a shack, or
smacked the loose boarding of a door, they were answered by a
long sullen moan of discontent. They sniggered.</p>
<p>"Check this one off," said Jennings Ware, "if you can't
collect next time. She owes for six weeks now."</p>
<p>"This one," he said, flipping a paper quietly on a door mat,
"is good pay. They're good niggers. You'll get your money every
Wednesday."</p>
<p>"There's a High Yaller in here," he said, hurling the paper
against the door with a whizzing smack and smiling, as a young
full-meated woman's yell of indignation answered, a thin devil's
grin. "You can have that if you want it."</p>
<p>A wan smile of fear struggled across Eugene's mouth. Jennings
Ware looked at him shrewdly, but did not press him. Jennings Ware
was a good-hearted boy.</p>
<p>"She's a pretty good old girl," he said. "You've got a right
to a few dead-heads. Take it out in trade."</p>
<p>They walked on down the dark unpaved street, folding papers
rapidly during the intervals between delivery.</p>
<p>"It's a hell of a route," said Jennings Ware. "When it rains
it's terrible. You'll go into mud up to your knees. And you can't
collect from half the bastards." He hurled a paper viciously.</p>
<p>"But, oh man," he said, after a moment. "If you want Jelly
Roll you've come to the right place. I ain't kidding you!"</p>
<p>"With&mdash;with niggers?" Eugene whispered, moistening his
dry lips.</p>
<p>Jennings Ware turned his red satirical face on him.</p>
<p>"You don't see any Society Belles around here, do you?" he
said.</p>
<p>"Are niggers good?" Eugene asked in a small dry voice.</p>
<p>"Boy!" The word blew out of Jennings Ware's mouth like an
explosion. He was silent a moment.</p>
<p>"There ain't nothing better," he said.</p>
<p>At first, the canvas strap of the paper-bag bit cruelly across
his slender shoulders. He strained against the galling weight
that pulled him earthwards. The first weeks were like a warring
nightmare: day after day he fought his way up to liberation. He
knew all the sorrow of those who carry weight; he knew, morning
by morning, the aerial ecstasy of release. As his load lightened
with the progress of his route, his leaning shoulder rose with
winged buoyancy, his straining limbs grew light: at the end of
his labor his flesh, touched sensuously by fatigue, bounded
lightly from the earth. He was Mercury chained by fardels, Ariel
bent beneath a pack: freed, his wingshod feet trod brightness. He
sailed in air. The rapier stars glinted upon his serfdom: dawn
reddened on release. He was like a sailor drowned within the
hold, who gropes to life and morning through a hatch; a diver
twined desperately in octopal feelers, who cuts himself from
death and mounts slowly from the sea-floor into light.</p>
<p>Within a month a thick hummock of muscle hardened on his
shoulder: he bent jubilantly into his work. He had now no fear of
failure. His heart lifted like a proud crested cock. He had been
dropped among others without favor, and he surpassed them. He was
a lord of darkness; he exulted in the lonely sufficiency of his
work. He walked into the sprawled chaos of the settlement, the
rifleman of news for sleeping men. His fast hands blocked the
crackling sheet, he swung his lean arm like a whip. He saw the
pale stars drown, and ragged light break open on the hills.
Alone, the only man alive, he began the day for men, as he walked
by the shuttered windows and heard the long denned snore of the
tropics. He walked amid this close thick sleep, hearing again the
ghostly ring of his own feet, and the vast orchestral music of
darkness. As the gray tide of morning surged westward he
awoke.</p>
<p>And Eugene watched the slow fusion of the seasons; he saw the
royal processional of the months; he saw the summer light eat
like a river into dark; he saw dark triumph once again; and he
saw the minute-winning days, like flies, buzz home to death.</p>
<p>In summer, full day had come before he finished: he walked
home in a world of wakenings. The first cars were grouped on the
Square as he passed, their new green paint giving them the
pleasant appearance of fresh toys. The huge battered cans of the
milkmen glinted cleanly in the sun. Light fell hopefuly upon the
swarthy greasiness of George Chakales, nightman of the Athens
Cafe. The Hellenic Dawn. And in Uneeda No. 1, upon the Square,
Eugene sat, washing an egg-sandwich down with long swallows of
pungent coffee, stooled in a friendly company of motormen,
policemen, chauffeurs, plasterers, and masons. It was very
pleasant, he felt, to complete one's work when all the world was
beginning theirs. He went home under singing trees of birds.</p>
<p>In autumn, a late red moon rode low in the skies till morning.
The air was filled with dropping leaves, there was a solemn
thunder of great trees upon the hills; sad phantasmal whisperings
and the vast cathedral music deepened in his heart.</p>
<p>In winter, he went down joyously into the dark howling wind,
leaning his weight upon its advancing wall as it swept up a hill;
and when in early Spring the small cold rain fell from the
reeking sky he was content. He was alone.</p>
<p>He harried his deficient subscribers for payment, with a wild
tenacity. He accepted their easy promises without question; he
hunted them down in their own rooms, or in the rooms of a
neighbor, he pressed so doggedly that, at length, sullenly or
good-humoredly, they paid a part of their debt. This was more
than any of his predecessors had accomplished, but he fretted
nervously over his accounts until he found that he had become,
for the circulation manager, the exemplar for indolent boys. As
he dumped his desperately gathered pile of "chicken feed" upon
the man's desk, his employer would turn accusingly to a
delinquent boy, saying:</p>
<p>"Look at that! He does it every week! Niggers, too!"</p>
<p>His pallid face would flame with joy and pride. When he spoke
to the great man his voice trembled. He could hardly speak.</p>
<p>As the wind yelled through the dark, he burst into maniacal
laughter. He leaped high into the air with a scream of insane
exultancy, burred in his throat idiot animal-squeals, and shot
his papers terrifically into the flimsy boarding of the shacks.
He was free. He was alone. He heard the howl of a train-whistle,
and it was not so far away. In the darkness he flung his arm out
to the man on the rails, his goggled brother with steel-steady
rail-fixed eyes.</p>
<p>He did not shrink so much, beneath the menace of the family
fist. He was more happily unmindful of his own unworthiness.</p>
<p>Assembled with three or four of the carriers in the lunchroom,
he learned to smoke: in the sweet blue air of Spring, as he
sloped down to his route, he came to know the beauty of Lady
Nicotine, the delectable wraith who coiled into his brain, left
her poignant breath in his young nostrils, her sharp kiss upon
his mouth.</p>
<p>He was a sharp blade.</p>
<p>The Spring drove a thorn into his heart, it drew a wild cry
from his lips. For it, he had no speech.</p>
<p>He knew hunger. He knew thirst. A great flame rose in him. He
cooled his hot face in the night by bubbling water jets. Alone,
he wept sometimes with pain and ecstasy. At home the frightened
silence of his childhood was now touched with savage restraint.
He was wired like a race-horse. A white atom of inchoate fury
would burst in him like a rocket, and for a moment he would be
cursing mad.</p>
<p>"What's wrong with him? Is it the Pentland crazy streak coming
out?" Helen asked, seated in Eliza's kitchen.</p>
<p>Eliza moulded her lips portentously for some time, shaking her
head slowly.</p>
<p>"Why," she said, with a cunning smile, "don't you know,
child?"</p>
<p>His need for the negroes had become acute. He spent his
afternoons after school combing restlessly through the celled
hive of Niggertown. The rank stench of the branch, pouring its
thick brown sewage down a bed of worn boulders, the smell of
wood-smoke and laundry stewing in a black iron yard-pot, and the
low jungle cadences of dusk, the forms that slid, dropped, and
vanished, beneath a twinkling orchestration of small sounds. Fat
ropes of language in the dusk, the larded sizzle of frying fish,
the sad faint twanging of a banjo, and the stamp, far-faint, of
heavy feet; voices Nilotic, river-wailing, and the greasy light
of four thousand smoky lamps in shack and tenement.</p>
<p>From the worn central butte round which the colony swarmed,
the panting voices of the Calvary Baptist Church mounted, in an
exhausting and unceasing frenzy, from seven o'clock until two in
the morning, in their wild jungle wail of sin and love and death.
The dark was hived with flesh and mystery. Rich wells of laughter
bubbled everywhere. The catforms slid. Everything was immanent.
Everything was far. Nothing could be touched.</p>
<p>In this old witch-magic of the dark, he began to know the
awful innocence of evil, the terrible youth of an ancient race;
his lips slid back across his teeth, he prowled in darkness with
loose swinging arms, and his eyes shone. Shame and terror,
indefinable, surged through him. He could not face the question
in his heart.</p>
<p>A good part of his subscription list was solidly founded among
decent and laborious darkies&mdash;barbers, tailors, grocers,
pharmacists, and ginghamed black housewives, who paid him
promptly on a given day each week, greeting him with warm smiles
full of teeth, and titles of respect extravagant and kindly:
"Mister," "Colonel," "General," "Governor," and so on. They all
knew Gant.</p>
<p>But another part&mdash;the part in which his desire and wonder
met&mdash;were "floaters," young men and women of precarious
means, variable lives, who slid mysteriously from cell to cell,
who peopled the night with their flitting stealth. He sought
these phantoms fruitlessly for weeks, until he discovered that he
might find them only on Sunday morning, tossed like heavy sacks
across one another, in the fetid dark of a tenement room, a
half-dozen young men and women, in a snoring exhaustion of
whisky-stupor and sexual depletion.</p>
<p>One Saturday evening, in the fading red of a summer twilight,
he returned to one of these tenements, a rickety three-story
shack, that cropped its two lower floors down a tall clay bank at
the western ledge, near the whites. Two dozen men and women lived
here. He was on the search for a woman named Ella Corpening. He
had never been able to find her: she was weeks behind in her
subscriptions. But her door stood open to-night: a warm waft of
air and cooking food came up to him. He descended the rotten
steps that climbed the bank.</p>
<p>Ella Corpening sat facing the door in a rocking chair, purring
lazily in the red glow of a little kitchen range, with her big
legs stretched comfortably out on the floor. She was a mulatto of
twenty-six years, a handsome woman of Amazonian proportions, with
smooth tawny skin.</p>
<p>She was dressed in the garments of some former mistress: she
wore a brown woollen skirt, patent-leather shoes with high suede
tops pearl-buttoned, and gray silk hose. Her long heavy arms
shone darkly through the light texture of a freshly laundered
white shirtwaist. A lacing of cheap blue ribbon gleamed across
the heavy curve of her breasts.</p>
<p>There was a bubbling pot of cabbage and sliced fat pork upon
the stove.</p>
<p>"Paper boy," said Eugene. "Come to collect."</p>
<p>"Is you de boy?" drawled Ella Corpening with a lazy movement
of her arm. "How much does I owe?"</p>
<p>"$1.20," he answered. He looked meaningfully at one extended
leg, where, thrust in below the knee, a wadded bank-note gleamed
dully.</p>
<p>"Dat's my rent money," she said. "Can't give you dat. Dollah-
twenty!" She brooded. "Uh! Uh!" she grunted pleasantly. "Don't
seem lak it ought to be dat much."</p>
<p>"It is, though," he said, opening his account book.</p>
<p>"It mus' is," she agreed, "if de book say so."</p>
<p>She meditated luxuriously for a moment.</p>
<p>"Does you collec' Sunday mawnin'?" she asked.</p>
<p>"Yes," he said.</p>
<p>"You come roun' in de mawnin'," she said hopefully. "I'll have
somethin' fo' yuh, sho. I'se waitin' fo' a white gent'man now.
He's goin' gib me a dollah."</p>
<p>She moved her great limbs slowly, and smiled at him. Forked
pulses beat against his eyes. He gulped dryly: his legs were
rotten with excitement.</p>
<p>"What's&mdash;what's he going to give you a dollar for?" he
muttered, barely audible.</p>
<p>"Jelly Roll," said Ella Corpening.</p>
<p>He moved his lips twice, unable to speak. She got up from her
chair.</p>
<p>"What yo' want?" she asked softly. "Jelly Roll?"</p>
<p>"Want to see&mdash;to see!" he gasped.</p>
<p>She closed the door opening on the bank and locked it. The
stove cast a grated glow from its open ashpan. There was a
momentary rain of red cinders into the pit.</p>
<p>Ella Corpening opened the door beyond that, leading to another
room. There were two dirty rumpled beds; the single window was
bolted and covered by an old green shade. She lit a smoky little
lamp, and turned the wick low.</p>
<p>There was a battered little dresser with a mottled glass, from
which the blistered varnish was flaking. Over the screened
hearth, on a low mantel, there was a Kewpie doll, sashed with
pink ribbon, a vase with fluted edges and gilt flowers, won at a
carnival, and a paper of pins. A calendar, also, by courtesy of
the Altamont Coal and Ice Company, showing an Indian maid
paddling her canoe down an alley of paved moonlight, and a
religious motto in flowered scrollwork, framed in walnut: God
Loves Them Both.</p>
<p>"What yo' want?" she whispered, facing him.</p>
<p>Far off, he listened to the ghost of his own voice.</p>
<p>"Take off your clothes."</p>
<p>Her skirt fell in a ring about her feet. She took off her
starched waist. In a moment, save for her hose, she stood naked
before him.</p>
<p>Her breath came quickly, her full tongue licked across her
mouth.</p>
<p>"Dance!" he cried. "Dance!"</p>
<p>She began to moan softly, while an undulant tremor flowed
through her great yellow body; her hips and her round heavy
breasts writhed slowly in a sensual rhythm.</p>
<p>Her straight oiled hair fell across her neck in a thick shock.
She extended her arms for balance, the lids closed over her large
yellow eyeballs. She came near him. He felt her hot breath on his
face, the smothering flood of her breasts. He was whirled like a
chip in the wild torrent of her passion. Her powerful yellow
hands gripped his slender arms round like bracelets. She shook
him to and fro slowly, fastening him tightly against her
pelt.</p>
<p>He strained back desperately against the door, drowning in her
embrace.</p>
<p>"Get-'way nigger. Get-'way," he panted thickly.</p>
<p>Slowly she released him: without opening her eyes, moaning,
she slid back as if he had been a young tree. She sang, in a
wailing minor key, with unceasing iteration:</p>
<blockquote>"Jelly Roll! Je-e-e-ly Roll!"&mdash;</blockquote>
<p>her voice falling each time to a low moan.</p>
<p>Her face, the broad column of her throat, and her
deep-breasted torso were rilled with sweat. He fumbled blindly
for the door, lunged across the outer room and, gasping, found
his way into the air. Her chant, unbroken and undisturbed by his
departure, followed him up the flimsy steps. He did not pause to
get his breath until he came to the edge of the market square.
Below him in the valley, across on the butte, the smoky lamps of
Niggertown flared in the dusk. Faint laughter, rich, jungle-wild,
welled up from hived darkness. He heard lost twangling notes, the
measured thump of distant feet; beyond, above, more thin, more
far than all, the rapid wail of sinners in a church.</p>
<h3>23</h3>
<p>[Greek text]</p>
<p>He did not tell the Leonards that he was working in the early
morning. He knew they would oppose his employment, and that their
opposition would manifest itself in the triumphant argument of
lowered grades. Also, Margaret Leonard, he knew, would talk
ominously of health undermined, of the promise of future years
destroyed, of the sweet lost hours of morning sleep that could
never be regained. He was really more robust now than he had ever
been. He was heavier and stronger. But he sometimes felt a
gnawing hunger for sleep: he grew heavy at mid-day, revived in
the afternoon, but found it difficult to keep his sleepy brain
fixed on a book after eight o'clock in the evening.</p>
<p>He learned little of discipline. Under the care of the
Leonards he came even to have a romantic contempt for it.
Margaret Leonard had the marvelous vision, of great people, for
essences. She saw always the dominant color, but she did not
always see the shadings. She was an inspired sentimentalist. She
thought she "knew boys": she was proud of her knowledge of them.
In fact, however, she had little knowledge of them. She would
have been stricken with horror if she could have known the wild
confusion of adolescence, the sexual nightmares of puberty, the
grief, the fear, the shame in which a boy broods over the dark
world of his desire. She did not know that every boy, caged in
from confession by his fear, is to himself a monster.</p>
<p>She did not have knowledge. But she had wisdom. She found
immediately a person's quality. Boys were her heroes, her little
gods. She believed that the world was to be saved, life redeemed,
by one of them. She saw the flame that burns in each of them, and
she guarded it. She tried somehow to reach the dark gropings
toward light and articulation, of the blunt, the stolid, the
shamefast. She spoke a calm low word to the trembling racehorse,
and he was still.</p>
<p>Thus, he made no confessions. He was still prison-pent. But he
turned always to Margaret Leonard as toward the light: she saw
the unholy fires that cast their sword-dance on his face, she saw
the hunger and the pain, and she fed him&mdash;majestic
crime!&mdash;on poetry.</p>
<p>Whatever of fear or shame locked them in careful silence,
whatever decorous pretense of custom guarded their tongues, they
found release in the eloquent symbols of verse. And by that sign,
Margaret was lost to the good angels. For what care the
ambassadors of Satan, for all the small fidelities of the letter
and the word, if from the singing choir of earthly methodism we
can steal a single heart&mdash;lift up, flame-tipped, one great
lost soul to the high sinfulness of poetry?</p>
<p>The wine of the grape had never stained her mouth, but the
wine of poetry was inextinguishably mixed with her blood,
entombed in her flesh.</p>
<p>By the beginning of his fifteenth year Eugene knew almost
every major lyric in the language. He possessed them to their
living core, not in a handful of scattered quotations, but almost
line for line. His thirst was drunken, insatiate: he added to his
hoard entire scenes from Schiller's Wilhelm Tell, which he read
by himself in German; the lyrics of Heine, and several folk
songs. He committed to memory the entire passage in the Anabasis,
the mounting and triumphal Greek which described the moment when
the starving remnant of the Ten Thousand had come at length to
the sea, and sent up their great cry, calling it by name. In
addition, he memorized some of the sonorous stupidities of
Cicero, because of the sound, and a little of Caesar, terse and
lean.</p>
<p>The great lyrics of Burns he knew from music, from reading, or
from hearing Gant recite them. But "Tam O'Shanter" Margaret
Leonard read to him, her eyes sparkling with laughter as she
read:</p>
<blockquote>"In hell they'll roast thee like a
herrin'."</blockquote>
<p>The shorter Wordsworth pieces he had read at grammar school.
"My heart leaps up," "I wandered lonely as a cloud," and "Behold
her, single in the field," he had known for years; but Margaret
read him the sonnets and made him commit "The world is too much
with us" to memory. Her voice trembled and grew low with passion
when she read it.</p>
<p>He knew all the songs in Shakespeare's plays, but the two that
moved him most were: "O mistress mine, where are you roaming?"
which blew a far horn in his heart, and the great song from
Cymbeline: "Fear no more the heat o' the sun." He had tried to
read all the sonnets, and failed, because their woven density was
too much for his experience, but he had read, and forgotten,
perhaps half of them, and remembered a few which burned up from
the page, strangely, immediately, like lamps for him.</p>
<p>Those that he knew were: "When, in the chronicle of wasted
time," "To me, fair friend, you never can be old," "Let me not to
the marriage of true minds," "The expense of spirit in a waste of
shame," "When to the sessions of sweet silent thought," "Shall I
compare thee to a summer's day?" "From you have I been absent in
the spring," and "That time of year thou mayest in me behold,"
the greatest of all, which Margaret brought him to, and which
shot through him with such electric ecstasy when he came to "Bare
ruined choirs, where late the sweet birds sang," that he could
hardly hold his course unbroken through the rest of it.</p>
<p>He read all the plays save Timon, Titus Andronicus,
Coriolanus, and King John, but the only play that held his
interest from first to last was King Lear. With most of the
famous declamatory passages he had been familiar, for years, by
Gant's recitation, and now they wearied him. And all the wordy
pinwheels of the clowns, which Margaret laughed at dutifully, and
exhibited as specimens of the master's swingeing wit, he felt
vaguely were very dull. He never had any confidence in
Shakespeare's humor&mdash;his Touchstones were not only windy
fools, but dull ones.</p>
<p>"For my part I had rather bear with you than bear you; yet I
should bear no cross if I did bear you, for I think you have no
money in your purse."</p>
<p>This sort of thing reminded him unpleasantly of the Pentlands.
The Fool in "Lear" alone he thought admirable&mdash;a sad,
tragic, mysterious fool. For the rest, he went about and composed
parodies, which, with a devil's grin, he told himself would split
the sides of posterity. Such as: "Aye, nuncle, an if Shrove
Tuesday come last Wednesday, I'll do the capon to thy cock, as
Tom O'Ludgate told the shepherd when he found the cowslips gone.
Dost bay with two throats, Cerberus? Down, boy, down!"</p>
<p>The admired beauties he was often tired of, perhaps because he
had heard them so often, and it seemed to him, moreover, that
Shakespeare often spoke absurdly and pompously when he might
better have spoken simply, as in the scene where, being informed
by the Queen of the death of his sister by drowning, Laertes
says:</p>
<blockquote>"Too much of water hast thou, poor Ophelia,<br>
And therefore I forbid my tears."</blockquote>
<p>You really can't beat that (he thought). Aye, Ben! Would he
had blotted a hundred! A thousand!</p>
<p>But he was deep in other passages which the elocutionist
misses, such as the terrible and epic invocation of Edmund, in
King Lear, drenched in evil, which begins:</p>
<blockquote>"Thou, Nature, art my goddess,"</blockquote>
<p>and ends,</p>
<blockquote>"Now, gods, stand up for bastards."</blockquote>
<p>It was as dark as night, as evil as Niggertown, as vast as the
elemental winds that howled down across the hills: he chanted it
in the black hours of his labor, into the dark and the wind. He
understood; he exulted in its evil&mdash;which was the evil of
earth, of illicit nature. It was a call to the unclassed; it was
a cry for those beyond the fence, for rebel angels, and for all
of the men who are too tall.</p>
<p>He knew nothing of the Elizabethan drama beyond Shakespeare's
plays. But he very early came to know a little of the poetry of
Ben Jonson, whom Margaret looked on as a literary Falstaff,
condoning, with the familiar weakness of the schoolmarm, his
Gargantuan excess as a pardonable whimsy of genius.</p>
<p>She was somewhat academically mirthful over the literary
bacchanalia, as a professor in a Baptist college smacks his lips
appetizingly and beams ruddily at his classes when he reads of
sack and porter and tankards foaming with the musty ale. All this
is part of the liberal tradition. Men of the world are
broadminded. Witness Professor Albert Thorndyke Firkins, of the
University of Chicago, at the Falcon in Soho. Smiling bravely, he
sits over a half-pint of bitter beer, in the company of a racing
tout, a sway- backed barmaid, broad in the stern, with adjustable
teeth, and three companionable tarts from Lisle street, who are
making the best of two pints of Guinness. With eager impatience
he awaits the arrival of G. K. Chesterton and E. V. Lucas.</p>
<p>"O rare Ben Jonson!" Margaret Leonard sighed with gentle
laughter. "Ah, Lord!"</p>
<p>"My God, boy!" Sheba roared, snatching the suggested motif of
conversation out of the air, and licking her buttered fingers
noisily as she stormed into action. "God bless him!" Her hairy
red face burned like clover, her veinous eyes were tearful
bright. "God bless him, 'Gene! He was as English as roast beef
and a tankard of musty ale!"</p>
<p>"Ah, Lord!" sighed Margaret. "He was a genius if ever there
was one." With misty eyes she gazed far off, a thread of laughter
on her mouth. "Whee!" she laughed gently. "Old Ben!"</p>
<p>"And say, 'Gene!" Sheba continued, bending forward with a fat
hand gripped upon her knee. "Do you know that the greatest
tribute to Shakespeare's genius is from his hand?"</p>
<p>"Ah, I tell you, boy!" said Margaret, with darkened eyes. Her
voice was husky. He was afraid she was going to weep.</p>
<p>"And yet the fools!" Sheba yelled. "The mean little two-by-two
pusillanimous swill-drinking fools&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Whee!" gently Margaret moaned. John Dorsey turned his
chalk-white face to the boy and whined with vacant appreciation,
winking his head pertly. Ah absently!</p>
<p>"&mdash;for that's all they are, have had the effrontery to
suggest that he was jealous."</p>
<p>"Pshaw!" said Margaret impatiently. "There's nothing in
that."</p>
<p>"Why, they don't know what they're talking about!" Sheba
turned a sudden grinning face upon him. "The little upstarts! It
takes us to tell 'em, 'Gene," she said.</p>
<p>He began to slide floorwards out of the wicker chair. John
Dorsey slapped his meaty thigh, and bent forward whining
inchoately, drooling slightly at the mouth.</p>
<p>"The Lord a' mercy!" he wheezed, gasping.</p>
<p>"I was talking to a feller the other day," said Sheba, "a
lawyer that you'd think might know a LITTLE something, and I used
a quotation out of The Merchant of Venice that every schoolboy
knows&mdash;'The quality of mercy is not strained.' The man
looked at me as if he thought I was crazy!"</p>
<p>"Great heavens!" said Margaret in a still voice.</p>
<p>"I said, 'Look here, Mr. So-and-so, you may be a smart lawyer,
you may have your million dollars that they say you have, but
there are a lot of things you don't know yet. There are a lot of
things money can't buy, my sonny, and one of them is the society
of cult- shered men and women.'"</p>
<p>"Why, pshaw!" said Mr. Leonard. "What do these little whipper-
snappers know about the things of the mind? You might as well
expect some ignorant darky out in the fields to construe a
passage in Homer." He grasped a glass half full of clabber, on
the table, and tilting it intently in his chalky fingers, spooned
out a lumpy spilth of curds which he slid, quivering, into his
mouth. "No, sir!" he laughed. "They may be Big Men on the tax
collector's books, but when they try to associate with educated
men and women, as the feller says, 'they&mdash;they&mdash;'" he
began to whine, "'why, they just ain't nothin'.'"</p>
<p>"What shall it profit a man," said Sheba, "if he gain the
whole world, and lose&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Ah, Lord!" sighed Margaret, shaking her smoke-dark eyes. "I
tell you!"</p>
<p>She told him. She told him of the Swan's profound knowledge of
the human heart, his universal and well-rounded characterization,
his enormous humor.</p>
<p>"Fought a long hour by Shrewsbury clock!" She laughed. "The
fat rascal! Imagine a man keeping the time!"</p>
<p>And, carefully: "It was the custom of the time, 'Gene. As a
matter of fact, when you read some of the plays of his
contemporaries you see how much purer he is than they are." But
she avoided a word, a line, here and there. The slightly spotty
Swan&mdash;muddied a little by custom. Then, too, the Bible.</p>

<p>"And observe, Eugene," she said, "he never made vice
attractive."</p>
<p>"Why didn't he?" he asked. "There's Falstaff."</p>
<p>"Yes," she replied, "and you know what happened to him, don't
you?"</p>
<p>"Why," he considered, "he died!"</p>
<p>"You see, don't you?" she concluded, with triumphant
warning.</p>
<p>I see, don't I? The wages of sin. What, by the way, are the
wages of virtue? The good die young.</p>
<blockquote>Boo-hoo! Boo-hoo! Boo-hoo!<br>
I really feel so blue!<br>
I was given to crime,<br>
And cut off in my prime<br>
When only eighty-two.</blockquote>
<p>"Then, note," she said, "how none of his characters stand
still. You can see them grow, from first to last. No one is the
same at the end as he was in the beginning."</p>
<p>In the beginning was the word. I am Alpha and Omega. The
growth of Lear. He grew old and mad. There's growth for you.</p>
<p>This tin-currency of criticism she had picked up in a few
courses at college, and in her reading. They were&mdash;are,
perhaps, still&mdash;part of the glib jargon of pedants. But they
did her no real injury. They were simply the things people said.
She felt, guiltily, that she must trick out her teaching with
these gauds: she was afraid that what she had to offer was not
enough. What she had to offer was simply a feeling that was so
profoundly right, so unerring, that she could no more utter great
verse meanly than mean verse well. She was a voice that God
seeks. She was the reed of demonic ecstasy. She was possessed,
she knew not how, but she knew the moment of her possession. The
singing tongues of all the world were wakened into life again
under the incantation of her voice. She was inhabited. She was
spent.</p>
<p>She passed through their barred and bolted boy-life with the
direct stride of a spirit. She opened their hearts as if they had
been lockets. They said: "Mrs. Leonard is sure a nice lady."</p>
<p>He knew some of Ben Jonson's poems, including the fine Hymn to
Diana, "Queen and huntress, chaste and fair," and the great
tribute to Shakespeare which lifted his hair at</p>
<blockquote>"...But call forth thundering Aeschylus,<br>
Euripides and Sophocles to us."&mdash;</blockquote>
<p>and caught at his throat at:</p>
<blockquote>"He was not for an age, but for all time!<br>
And all the Muses still were in their prime..."</blockquote>
<p>The elegy to little Salathiel Pavy, the child actor, was honey
from the lion's mouth. But it was too long.</p>
<p>Of Herrick, sealed of the tribe of Ben, he knew much more. The
poetry sang itself. It was, he thought later, the most perfect
and unfailing lyrical voice in the language&mdash;a clean, sweet,
small, unfaltering note. It is done with the incomparable ease of
an inspired child. The young men and women of our century have
tried to recapture it, as they have tried to recapture Blake and,
a little more successfully, Donne.</p>
<blockquote>Here a little child I stand<br>
Heaving up my either hand;<br>
Cold as paddocks though they be,<br>
<br>
Here I lift them up to Thee,<br>
For a benison to fall<br>
On our meat and on us all. Amen.</blockquote>
<p>There was nothing beyond this&mdash;nothing that surpassed it
in precision, delicacy, and wholeness.</p>
<p>Their names dropped musically like small fat bird-notes
through the freckled sunlight of a young world: prophetically he
brooded on the sweet lost bird-cries of their names, knowing they
never would return. Herrick, Crashaw, Carew, Suckling, Campion,
Lovelace, Dekker. O sweet content, O sweet, O sweet content!</p>
<p>He read shelves of novels: all of Thackeray, all the stories
of Poe and Hawthorne, and Herman Melville's Omoo and Typee, which
he found at Gant's. Of Moby Dick he had never heard. He read a
half-dozen Coopers, all of Mark Twain, but failed to finish a
single book of Howells or James.</p>
<p>He read a dozen of Scott, and liked best of all Quentin
Durward, because the descriptions of food were as beautiful and
appetizing as any he had ever read.</p>
<p>Eliza went to Florida again during his fourteenth year and
left him to board with the Leonards. Helen was drifting, with
crescent weariness and fear, through the cities of the East and
Middle-West. She sang for several weeks in a small cabaret in
Baltimore, she moved on to Philadelphia and thumped out popular
tunes on a battered piano at the music counter of a five and ten
cent store, with studious tongue out-thrust as she puzzled
through new scores.</p>
<p>Gant wrote her faithfully twice a week&mdash;a blue but
copious log of existence. Occasionally he enclosed small checks,
which she saved, uncashed.</p>
<p>"Your mother," he wrote, "has gone off on another wild-goose
chase to Florida, leaving me here alone to face the music,
freeze, or starve. God knows what we'll all come to before the
end of this fearful, hellish, and damnable winter, but I predict
the poorhouse and soup-kitchens like we had in the Cleveland
administration. When the Democrats are in, you may as well begin
to count your ribs. The banks have no money, people are out of
work. You can mark my words everything will go to the
tax-collector under the hammer before we're done. The temperature
was 7 above when I looked this morning, coal has gone up
seventy-five cents a ton. The Sunny South. Keep off the grass
said Bill Nye. Jesus God! I passed the Southern Fuel Co.
yesterday and saw old Wagner at the window with a fiendish smile
of gloatation on his face as he looked out on the sufferings of
the widows and orphans. Little does he care if they all freeze.
Bob Grady dropped dead Tuesday morning as he was coming out of
the Citizen's Bank. I had known him twenty- five years. He'd
never been sick a day in his life. All, all are gone, the old
familiar faces. Old Gant will be the next. I have been eating at
Mrs. Sales' since your mother went away. You've never seen such a
table as she keeps in your life&mdash;a profusion of fruits piled
up in pyramids, stewed prunes, peaches, and preserves, big roasts
of pork, beef, lamb, cold cuts of ham and tongue, and a half
dozen vegetables in an abundance that beggars description. How in
God's name she does it for thirty-five cents I don't know. Eugene
is staying with the Leonards while your mother's away. I take him
up to Sales' with me once or twice a week and give him a square
meal. They look mighty serious when they see those long legs
coming. God knows where he puts it all&mdash;he can eat more than
any three people I ever saw. I suppose he gets pretty lean
pickings at the school. He's got the lean and hungry Gant look.
Poor child. He has no mother any more. I'll do the best I can for
him until the smash comes. Leonard comes and brags about him
every week. He says his equal is not to be found anywhere. Every
one in town has heard of him. Preston Carr (who's sure to be the
next governor) was talking to me about him the other day. He
wants me to send him to the State university law school where he
will make lifelong friends among the people of his own State, and
then put him into politics. It's what I should have done. I'm
going to give him a good education. The rest is up to him.
Perhaps he'll be a credit to the name. You haven't seen him since
he put on long pants. His mother picked out a beautiful suit at
Moale's Christmas. He went down to Daisy's for Christmas and put
them on. I bought him a cheap pair at the Racket Store for
every-day wear. He can save the good ones for Sunday. Your mother
has let the Old Barn to Mrs. Revell until she gets back. I went
in the other day and found it warm for the first time in my life.
She keeps the furnace going and she's not afraid to burn coal. I
hardly ever see Ben from one week to another. He comes in and
prowls around in the kitchen at one and two o'clock in the
morning and I'm up and gone hours before he's awake. You can get
nothing out of him&mdash;he never says a half-dozen words and if
you ask him a civil question he cuts you off short. I see him
down-town late at night sometimes with Mrs. P. They're thick as
thieves together. I guess she's a bad egg. This is all for this
time. John Duke was shot and killed by the house detective at the
Whitstone hotel Sunday night. He was drunk and threatening to
shoot every one. It's a sad thing for his wife. He left three
children. She was in to see me to-day. He was well-liked by every
one but a terror when he drank. My heart bled for her. She's a
pretty little woman. Liquor has caused more misery than all the
other evils in the world put together. I curse the day it was
first invented. Enclosed find a small check to buy yourself a
present. God knows what we're coming to. Aff. Your Father, W. O.
Gant."</p>
<p>She saved carefully all his letters&mdash;written on his heavy
slick business stationery in the huge Gothic sprawl of his
crippled right hand.</p>
<p>In Florida, meanwhile, Eliza surged up and down the coast,
stared thoughtfully at the ungrown town of Miami, found prices
too high at Palm Beach, rents too dear at Daytona, and turned
inland at length to Orlando, where, groved round with linked
lakes and citrous fruits, the Pentlands waited her approach,
Pett, with a cold lust of battle on her face, Will with a grimace
of itching nervousness while he scaled stubbily at the flaky
tetter of his hand.</p>
<h3>24</h3>
<p>With thick chalked fingers John Dorsey thoughtfully massaged
his torso from loin to chin.</p>
<p>"Now, let me see," he whined with studious deliberation, "what
he gives on this." He fumbled for the notes.</p>
<p>Tom Davis turned his reddening cheeks toward the window, a low
sputter of laughter escaping from his screwed lips.</p>
<p>Guy Doak gazed solemnly at Eugene, with a forked hand stroking
his grave pallid face.</p>
<p>"Entgegen," said Eugene, in a small choked voice, "follows its
object."</p>
<p>John Dorsey laughed uncertainly, and shook his head, still
searching the notes.</p>
<p>"I'm not so sure of that," he said.</p>
<p>Their wild laughter leaped like freed hounds. Tom Davis hurled
himself violently downward over his desk. John Dorsey looked up,
adding uncertainly his absent falsetto mirth.</p>
<p>From time to time, in spite of himself, they taught him a
little German, a language of which he had been quite happily
ignorant. The lesson had become for them a daily hunger: they
worked it over with mad intensity, speeding and polishing their
translation in order to enjoy his bewilderment. Sometimes,
deliberately, they salted their pages with glib false readings,
sometimes they interpolated passages of wild absurdity, waiting
exultantly for his cautious amendment of a word that did not
exist.</p>
<p>"Slowly the moonlight crept up the chair in which the old man
was sitting, reaching his knees, his breast, and
finally,"&mdash;Guy Doak looked up slyly at his tutor, "giving
him a good punch in the eye."</p>
<p>"No-o," said John Dorsey, rubbing his chin, "not exactly.
'Catching him squarely in the eye' gets the idiom better, I
think."</p>
<p>Tom Davis thrust a mouthful of strange gurgling noises into
his desk, and waited for the classic evasion. It came at
once.</p>
<p>"Let me see," said John Dorsey, turning the pages, "what he
gives on this."</p>
<p>Guy Doak scrawled a brief message across a crumpled wad and
thrust it on Eugene's desk. Eugene read:</p>
<blockquote>"Gebe mir ein Stuck Papier,<br>
Before I bust you on the ear."</blockquote>
<p>He detached two slick sheets from his tablet, and wrote in
answer:</p>
<blockquote>"Du bist wie eine bum-me."</blockquote>
<p>They read sweet gluey little stories, fat German tear-gulps:
Immensee, H&ouml;her als die Kirche, Der Zerbrochene Krug. Then,
Wilhelm Tell. The fine lyrical measure of the opening song, the
unearthly siren song to the fisher-boy, haunted them with its
faery music. The heavy melodrama of some of the scenes was
unhackneyed to them: they bent eagerly to the apple-shooting
scene, and the escape by boat. As for the rest, it was, they
wearily recognized, Great Literature. Mr. Schiller, they saw, was
religiously impressed, like Patrick Henry, George Washington, and
Paul Revere, with the beauties of Liberty. His embattled Swiss
bounded ponderously from crag to crag, invoking it in windy
speeches.</p>
<p>"The mountains," observed John Dorsey, touched, in a happy
moment, by the genius of the place, "have been the traditional
seat of Liberty."</p>
<p>Eugene turned his face toward the western ranges. He heard,
far off, a whistle, a remote, thunder on the rails.</p>
<p>During this season of Eliza's absence he roomed with Guy
Doak.</p>
<p>Guy Doak was five years his senior. He was a native of Newark,
New Jersey: his speech was touched with Yankee nasality, his
manner with Yankee crispness. His mother, a boarding-house
mistress, had come to Altamont a year or two before to retrieve
her health: she was tubercular, and spent part of the winter in
Florida.</p>
<p>Guy Doak had a trim cocky figure of medium height, black hair,
bright dark eyes, a pale, very smooth oval face, somehow
suggestive, Eugene thought, of a fish's belly, with somewhat
unhappily full jaws which made his lower features seem larger
than his upper. He was foppishly neat in his dress. People called
him a good-looking boy.</p>
<p>He made few friends. To the boys at Leonard's this Yankee was
far more remote than the rich Cuban boy, Manuel Quevado, whose
fat dark laughter and broken speech was all for girls. He
belonged to a richer South, but they knew him.</p>
<p>Guy Doak had none of their floridity. He was lacking in their
hearty violence. He did not laugh loudly. He had a sharp, bright,
shallow mind, inflexibly dogmatic. His companions were bad
Southern romantics, he was a false Yankee realist. They arrived,
thus, by different means, at a common goal of superstition. Guy
Doak had already hardened into the American city-dweller's mould
of infantile cynicism. He was occasionally merry with the other
boys in the classic manner of the city fellow with the yokels. He
was wise. Above all, he was wise. It was safe to assume, he felt,
that Truth was always on the scaffold, and Wrong forever on the
throne. So far from being depressed by the slaughter of the
innocents, the spectacle gave him much bitter amusement.</p>
<p>Outside of this, Guy Doak was a very nice fellow&mdash;sharp,
obstinate, unsubtle, and pleased with his wit. They lived on the
first floor at Leonard's: at night, by a roaring wood fire, they
listened carefully to the great thunder of the trees, and to the
stealthy creaking foot-steps of the master as he came softly down
the stairs, and paused by their door. They ate at table with
Margaret, John Dorsey, Miss Amy, the two children, John Dorsey,
junior, nine, and Margaret, five, and two of Leonard's Tennessee
nephews&mdash;Tyson Leonard, a ferret-faced boy of eighteen,
foulmouthed and sly, and Dirk Barnard, a tall slender boy,
seventeen, with a bumpy face, brown merry eyes, and a quick
temper. At table they kept up a secret correspondence of innuendo
and hidden movement, fleshing a fork in a grunting neighbor as
John Dorsey said the blessing, and choking with smothered
laughter. At night, they tapped messages on floor and ceiling,
crept out for sniggering conventions in the windy dark hall, and
fled to their innocent beds as John Dorsey stormed down on
them.</p>
<p>Leonard was fighting hard to keep his little school alive. He
had less than twenty students the first year, and less than
thirty the second. From an income of not more than $3,000 he had
to pay Miss Amy, who had left a high school position to help him,
a small salary. The old house on its fine wooded hill was full of
outmoded plumbing and drafty corridors: he had leased it at a
small rental. But the rough usage of thirty boys demanded a
considerable yearly restoration. The Leonards were fighting very
stubbornly and courageously for their existence.</p>
<p>The food was scant and poor: at breakfast, a dish of blue,
watery oatmeal, eggs and toast; at lunch, a thin soup, hot sour
cornbread, and a vegetable boiled with a piece of fat pork; at
dinner, hot biscuits, a small meat loaf, and creamed or boiled
potatoes. No one was permitted coffee or tea, but there was an
abundance of fresh creamy milk. John Dorsey always kept and
milked his own cow. Occasionally there was a deep, crusted pie,
hot, yolky muffins, or spicy gingerbread of Margaret's make. She
was a splendid cook.</p>
<p>Often, at night, Guy Doak slid quietly out through the window
on to the side porch, and escaped down the road under the
concealing roar of the trees. He would return from town within
two hours, crawling in exultantly with a bag full of hot
frankfurter sandwiches coated thickly with mustard, chopped
onion, and a hot Mexican sauce. With a crafty grin he unfoiled
two five-cent cigars, which they smoked magnificently, with a
sharp tang of daring, blowing the smoke up the chimney in order
to thwart a possible irruption by the master. And Guy brought
back, from the wind and the night, the good salt breath of gossip
in street and store, news of the town, and the brave swagger of
the drugstore gallants.</p>
<p>As they smoked and stuffed fat palatable bites of sandwich
into their mouths, they would regard each other with pleased
sniggers, carrying on thus an insane symphony of laughter:</p>
<p>"Chuckle, chuckle!&mdash;laugh of gloatation."</p>
<p>"Tee-hee, tee-hee, tee-hee! . . laugh of titterosity."</p>
<p>"Snuh-huh, snuh-huh, snuh-huh! . . laugh of
gluttonotiousness."</p>
<p>The vigorous warmth of burning wood filled their room
pleasantly: over their sheltered heads the dark gigantic wind
howled through the earth. O sheltered love, nooked warmly in
against this winter night. O warm fair women, whether within a
forest hut, or by the town ledged high above the moaning seas,
shot upon the wind, I come.</p>
<p>Guy Doak toyed gently at his belly with his right hand, and
stroked his round chin slowly with his left.</p>
<p>"Now let me see," he whined, "what he gives on this."</p>
<p>Their laughter rang around the walls. Too late, they heard the
aroused stealthy foot-falls of the master, creaking down the
hall. Later&mdash;silence, the dark, the wind.</p>
<p>Miss Amy closed her small beautifully kept grade book, thrust
her great arms upward, and yawned. Eugene looked hopefully at her
and out along the playing court, reddened by the late sun. He was
wild, uncontrollable, erratic. His mad tongue leaped out in
class. He could never keep peace a full day. He amazed them. They
loved him, and they punished him piously, affectionately. He was
never released at the dismissal hour. He was always "kept
in."</p>
<p>John Dorsey noted each whisper of disorder, or each failure in
preparation, by careful markings in a book. Each afternoon he
read the names of delinquents, amid a low mutter of sullen
protest, and stated their penalties. Once Eugene got through an
entire day without a mark. He stood triumphantly before Leonard
while the master searched the record.</p>
<p>John Dorsey began to laugh foolishly; he gripped his hand
affectionately around the boy's arm.</p>
<p>"Well, sir!" he said. "There must be a mistake. I'm going to
keep you in on general principles."</p>
<p>He bent to a long dribbling suction of laughter. Eugene's wild
eyes were shot with tears of anger and surprise. He never
forgot.</p>
<p>Miss Amy yawned, and smiled on him with slow powerful
affectionate contempt.</p>
<p>"Go on!" she said, in her broad, lazy accent. "I don't want to
fool with you any more. You're not worth powder enough to blow
you up."</p>
<p>Margaret came in, her face furrowed deeply between smoke-dark
eyes, full of tender sternness and hidden laughter.</p>
<p>"What's wrong with the rascal?" she asked. "Can't he learn
algebra?"</p>
<p>"He can learn!" drawled Miss Amy. "He can learn anything. He's
lazy&mdash;that's what it is. Just plain lazy."</p>
<p>She smacked his buttock smartly with a ruler.</p>
<p>"I'd like to warm you a bit with this," she laughed, slowly
and richly. "You'd learn then."</p>
<p>"Here!" said Margaret, shaking her head in protest. "You leave
that boy alone. Don't look behind the faun's ears. Never mind
about algebra, here. That's for poor folks. There's no need for
algebra where two and two make five."</p>
<p>Miss Amy turned her handsome gypsy eyes on Eugene.</p>
<p>"Go on. I've seen enough of you." She made a strong weary
gesture of dismissal.</p>
<p>Hatless, with a mad whoop, he plunged through the door and
leaped the porch rail.</p>
<p>"Here, boy!" Margaret called. "Where's your hat?"</p>
<p>Grinning, he galloped back, picked up a limp rag of dirty
green felt, and pulled it over his chaotic hair. Curly tufts
stuck through the gaping crease-holes.</p>
<p>"Come here!" said Margaret gravely. Her nervous fingers pulled
his frayed necktie around to the front, tugged down his vest, and
buttoned his coat over tightly, while he peered at her with his
strange devil's grin. Suddenly she trembled with laughter.</p>
<p>"Good heavens, Amy," she said. "Look at that hat."</p>
<p>Miss Amy smiled at him with indifferent sleepy cat-warmth.</p>
<p>"You want to fix yourself up, 'Gene," she said, "so the girls
will begin to notice you."</p>
<p>He heard the strange song of Margaret's laughter.</p>
<p>"Can you see him out courting?" she said. "The poor girl would
think she had a demon lover, sure."</p>
<blockquote>"As e'er beneath a waning moon was haunted<br>
By woman wailing for her demon lover."</blockquote>
<p>His eyes burned on her face, flowing with dark secret
beauty.</p>
<p>"Get along, you scamp!" she ordered.</p>
<p>He turned, and, crying fiercely in his throat, tore down the
road with bounding strides.</p>
<p>All the dusk blurred in her eyes.</p>
<p>"Leave him alone!" she whispered to no one. "Leave him
alone!"</p>
<p>A light wind of April fanned over the hill. There was a smell
of burning leaves and rubble around the school. In the field on
the hill flank behind the house a plowman drove his big horse
with loose clanking traces around a lessening square of dry
fallow earth. Gee, woa. His strong feet followed after. The big
share bit cleanly down, cleaving a deep spermy furrow of moist
young earth along its track.</p>
<p>John Dorsey Leonard stared fascinated out the window at the
annual rejuvenation of the earth. Before his eyes the emergent
nymph was scaling her hard cracked hag's pelt. The golden age
returned.</p>
<p>Down the road a straggling queue of boys were all gone into
the world of light. Wet with honest sweat, the plowman paused at
the turn, and wiped the blue shirting of his forearm across his
beaded forehead. Meanwhile, his intelligent animal, taking
advantage of the interval, lifted with slow majesty a proud
flowing tail, and added his mite to the fertility of the soil
with three moist oaty droppings. Watching, John Dorsey grunted
approvingly. They also serve who only stand and wait.</p>
<p>"Please, Mr. Leonard," said Eugene, carefully choosing his
moment, "can I go?"</p>
<p>John Dorsey Leonard stroked his chin absently, and stared
sightlessly at his book. Others abide our question, thou art
free.</p>
<p>"Huh?" he purred vaguely. Then, with a high vacant snigger he
turned suddenly, and said:</p>
<p>"You rascal, you! See if Mrs. Leonard wants you." He fastened
his brutal grip with keen hunger into the boy's thin arm. April
is the cruellest of months. Eugene winced, moved away, and then
stood quietly, checked by memory of the old revolt from awe.</p>
<p>He found Margaret in the library reading to the children from
The Water Babies.</p>
<p>"Mr. Leonard says to ask you if I can go?" he said.</p>
<p>And her eyes were darkened wholly.</p>
<p>"Yes, you scamp. Go on," she said. "Tell me, boy," she coaxed,
softly, "can't you be a little bit better?"</p>
<p>"Yes'm," he promised, easily. "I'll try." Say not the struggle
naught availeth.</p>
<p>She smiled at his high mettled prancing nervousness.</p>
<p>"In hell they'll roast thee like a herrin'," she said gently.
"Get out of here."</p>
<p>He bounded away from the nunnery of the chaste breast and
quiet mind.</p>
<p>As he leaped down the stairs into the yard he heard Dirk
Barnard's lusty splashing bathtub solo. Sweet Thames, run softly
till I end my song. Tyson Leonard, having raked into every slut's
corner of nature with a thin satisfied grin, emerged from the
barn with a cap full of fresh eggs. A stammering cackle of
protest followed him from angry hens who found too late that men
betray. At the barnside, under the carriage shed, "Pap" Rheinhart
tightened the bellyband of his saddled brown mare, swinging
strongly into the saddle, and with a hard scramble of hoofs, came
up the hill, wheeled in behind the house, and drew up by
Eugene.</p>
<p>"Jump on, 'Gene," he invited, patting the mare's broad rump.
"I'll take you home."</p>
<p>Eugene looked up at him grinning.</p>
<p>"You'll take me nowhere," he said. "I couldn't sit down for a
week last time."</p>
<p>"Pap" boomed with laughter.</p>
<p>"Why, pshaw, boy!" he said. "That was nothing but a gentle
little dog-trot."</p>
<p>"Dog-trot your granny," said Eugene. "You tried to kill
me."</p>
<p>"Pap" Rheinhart turned his wry neck down on the boy with grave
dry humor.</p>
<p>"Come on," he said gruffly. "I'm not going to hurt you. I'll
teach you how to ride a horse."</p>
<p>"Much obliged, Pap," said Eugene ironically. "But I'm thinking
of using my tail a good deal in my old age. I don't want to wear
it out while I'm young."</p>
<p>Pleased with them both, "Pap" Rheinhart laughed loud and deep,
spat a brown quid back over the horse's crupper, and, digging his
heels in smartly, galloped away around the house, into the road.
The horse bent furiously to his work, like a bounding dog. With
four- hooved thunder he drummed upon the sounding earth.
Quadrupedante putrem sonitu quatit ungula campum.</p>
<p>At the two-posted entry, by the bishop's boundary, the
departing students turned, split quickly to the sides, and urged
the horseman on with shrill cries. "Pap" bent low, with
loose-reined hands above the horse-mane, went through the gate
like the whiz of a cross-bow. Then, he jerked the mare back on
her haunches with a dusty skid of hoofs, and waited for the boys
to come up.</p>
<p>"Hey!" With high bounding exultancy Eugene came down the road
to join them. Without turning, stolid Van Yeats threw up his hand
impatiently and greeted the unseen with a cheer. The others
turned, welcoming him with ironical congratulation.</p>
<p>"'Highpockets,'" said "Doc" Hines, comically puckering his
small tough face, "how'd you happen to git out on time?" He had
an affected, high-pitched nigger drawl. When he spoke he kept one
hand in his coat pocket, fingering a leather thong loaded with
buckshot.</p>
<p>"J. D. had to do his spring plowing," said Eugene.</p>
<p>"Well, if it ain't ole Handsome," said Julius Arthur. He
grinned squintily, revealing a mouthful of stained teeth screwed
in a wire clamp. His face was covered with small yellow pustulate
sores. How begot, how nourished?</p>
<p>"Shall we sing our little song for Handsome Hal?" said Ralph
Rolls to his copesmate Julius. He wore a derby hat jammed over
his pert freckled face. As he spoke he took a ragged twist of
tobacco from his pocket and bit off a large chew with a rough air
of relish.</p>
<p>"Want a chew, Jule?" he said.</p>
<p>Julius took the twist, wiped off his mouth with a loose male
grin, and crammed a large quid into his cheek.</p>
<p>He brought me roots of relish sweet.</p>
<p>"Want one, Highpockets?" he asked Eugene, grinning.</p>
<p>I hate him that would upon the rack of this tough world
stretch me out longer.</p>
<p>"Hell," said Ralph Rolls. "Handsome would curl up and die if
he ever took a chew."</p>
<p>In Spring like torpid snakes my enemies awaken.</p>
<p>At the corner of Church Street, across from the new imitation
Tudor of the Episcopal church, they paused. Above them, on the
hill, rose the steeples of the Methodist and Presbyterian
churches. Ye antique spires, ye distant towers!</p>
<p>"Who's going my way?" said Julius Arthur. "Come on, 'Gene. The
car's down here. I'll take you home."</p>
<p>"Thanks, but I can't," said Eugene. "I'm going up-town." Their
curious eyes on Dixieland when I get out.</p>
<p>"You going home, Villa?"</p>
<p>"No," said George Graves.</p>
<p>"Well, keep Hal out of trouble," said Ralph Rolls.</p>
<p>Julius Arthur laughed roughly and thrust his hand through
Eugene's hair. "Old Hairbreadth Hal," he said. "The cutthroat
from Saw- Tooth Gap!"</p>
<p>"Don't let 'em climb your frame, son," said Van Yeats, turning
his quiet pleasant face on Eugene. "If you need help, let me
know."</p>
<p>"So long, boys."</p>
<p>"So long."</p>
<p>They crossed the street, mixing in nimble horse-play, and
turned down past the church along a sloping street that led to
the garages. George Graves and Eugene continued up the hill.</p>
<p>"Julius is a good boy," said George Graves. "His father makes
more money than any other lawyer in town."</p>
<p>"Yes," said Eugene, still brooding on Dixieland and his clumsy
deceptions.</p>
<p>A street-sweeper walked along slowly uphill, beside his deep
wedge- bodied cart. From time to time he stopped the big
slow-footed horse and, sweeping the littered droppings of street
and gutter into a pan, with a long-handled brush, dumped his
collections into the cart. Let not Ambition mock their useful
toil.</p>
<p>Three sparrows hopped deftly about three fresh smoking globes
of horse-dung, pecking out tidbits with dainty gourmandism.
Driven away by the approaching cart, they skimmed briskly over to
the bank, with bright twitters of annoyance. One too like thee,
tameless, and swift, and proud.</p>
<p>George Graves ascended the hill with a slow ponderous rhythm,
staring darkly at the ground.</p>
<p>"Say, 'Gene!" he said finally. "I don't believe he makes that
much."</p>
<p>Eugene thought seriously for a moment. With George Graves, it
was necessary to resume a discussion where it had been left off
three days before.</p>
<p>"Who?" he said, "John Dorsey? Yes, I think he does," he added,
grinning.</p>
<p>"Not over $2,500, anyway," said George Graves gloomily.</p>
<p>"No&mdash;three thousand, three thousand!" he said, in a
choking voice.</p>
<p>George Graves turned to him with a sombre, puzzled smile.
"What's the matter?" he asked.</p>
<p>"O you fool! You damn fool!" gasped Eugene. "You've been
thinking about it all this time."</p>
<p>George Graves laughed sheepishly, with embarrassment,
richly.</p>
<p>From the top of the hill at the left, the swelling unction of
the Methodist organ welled up remotely from the choir,
accompanied by a fruity contralto voice, much in demand at
funerals. Abide with me.</p>
<p>Most musical of mourners, weep again!</p>
<p>George Graves turned and examined the four large black houses,
ascending on flat terraces to the church, of Paston Place.</p>
<p>"That's a good piece of property, 'Gene," he said. "It belongs
to the Paston estate."</p>
<p>Fast falls the even-tide. Heaves the proud harlot her
distended breast, in intricacies of laborious song.</p>
<p>"It will all go to Gil Paston some day," said George Graves
with virtuous regret. "He's not worth a damn."</p>
<p>They had reached the top of the hill. Church Street ended
levelly a block beyond, in the narrow gulch of the avenue. They
saw, with quickened pulse, the little pullulation of the
town.</p>
<p>A negro dug tenderly in the round loamy flowerbeds of the
Presbyterian churchyard, bending now and then to thrust his thick
fingers gently in about the roots. The old church, with its sharp
steeple, rotted slowly, decently, prosperously, like a good man's
life, down into its wet lichened brick. Eugene looked gratefully,
with a second's pride, at its dark decorum, its solid Scotch
breeding.</p>
<p>"I'm a Presbyterian," he said. "What are you?"</p>
<p>"An Episcopalian, when I go," said George Graves with
irreverent laughter.</p>
<p>"To hell with these Methodists!" Eugene said with an elegant,
disdainful face. "They're too damn common for us." God in three
persons&mdash;blessed Trinity. "Brother Graves," he continued, in
a fat well-oiled voice, "I didn't see you at prayer-meeting
Wednesday night. Where in Jesus' name were you?"</p>
<p>With his open palm he struck George Graves violently between
his meaty shoulders. George Graves staggered drunkenly with high
resounding laughter.</p>
<p>"Why, Brother Gant," said he, "I had a little appointment with
one of the Good Sisters, out in the cow-shed."</p>
<p>Eugene gathered a telephone pole into his wild embrace, and
threw one leg erotically over its second foot-wedge. George
Graves leaned his heavy shoulder against it, his great limbs
drained with laughter.</p>
<p>There was a hot blast of steamy air from the Appalachian
Laundry across the street and, as the door from the office of the
washroom opened, they had a moment's glimpse of negresses
plunging their wet arms into the liquefaction of their
clothes.</p>
<p>George Graves dried his eyes. Laughing wearily, they crossed
over.</p>
<p>"We oughtn't to talk like that, 'Gene," said George Graves
reproachfully. "Sure enough! It's not right."</p>
<p>He became moodily serious rapidly. "The best people in this
town are church members," he said earnestly. "It's a fine
thing."</p>
<p>"Why?" said Eugene, with an idle curiosity.</p>
<p>"Because," said George Graves, "you get to know all the people
who are worth a damn."</p>
<p>Worth being damned, he thought quickly. A quaint idea.</p>
<p>"It helps you in a business way. They come to know you and
respect you. You won't get far in this town, 'Gene, without them.
It pays," he added devoutly, "to be a Christian."</p>
<p>"Yes," Eugene agreed seriously, "you're right." To walk
together to the kirk, with a goodly company.</p>
<p>He thought sadly of his lost sobriety, and of how once,
lonely, he had walked the decent lanes of God's Scotch town.
Unbidden they came again to haunt his memory, the shaven faces of
good tradesmen, each leading the well washed kingdom of his home
in its obedient ritual the lean hushed smiles of worship, the
chained passion of devotion, as they implored God's love upon
their ventures, or delivered their virgin daughters into the holy
barter of marriage. And from even deeper adyts of his brain there
swam up slowly to the shores of his old hunger the great fish
whose names he scarcely knew&mdash;whose names, garnered with
blind toil from a thousand books, from Augustine, himself a name,
to Jeremy Taylor, the English metaphysician, were brief
evocations of scalded light, electric, phosphorescent,
illuminating by their magic connotations the vast far depths of
ritual and religion: They came&mdash;Bartholomew, Hilarius,
Chrysostomos, Polycarp, Anthony, Jerome, and the forty martyrs of
Cappadocia who walked the waves&mdash;coiled like their own green
shadows for a moment, and were gone.</p>
<p>"Besides," said George Graves, "a man ought to go anyway.
Honesty's the best policy."</p>
<p>Across the street, on the second floor of a small brick
three-story building that housed several members of the legal,
medical, surgical, and dental professions, Dr. H. M. Smathers
pumped vigorously with his right foot, took a wad of cotton from
his assistant, Miss Lola Bruce, and thrusting it securely into
the jaw of the unseen patient, bent his fashionable bald head
intently. A tiny breeze blew back the thin curtains, and revealed
him, white- jacketed, competent, drill in hand.</p>
<p>"Do you feel that?" he said tenderly.</p>
<p>"Wrogd gdo gurk!"</p>
<p>"Spit!" With thee conversing, I forget all time.</p>
<p>"I suppose," said George Graves thoughtfully, "the gold they
use in people's teeth is worth a lot of money."</p>
<p>"Yes," said Eugene, finding the idea attractive, "if only one
person in ten has gold fillings that would be ten million in the
United States alone. You can figure on five dollars' worth each,
can't you?"</p>
<p>"Easy!" said George Graves. "More than that." He brooded
lusciously a moment. "That's a lot of money," he said.</p>
<p>In the office of the Rogers-Malone Undertaking Establishment
the painful family of death was assembled, "Horse" Hines, tilted
back in a swivel chair, with his feet thrust out on the broad
window- ledge, chatted lazily with Mr. C. M. Powell, the suave
silent partner. How sleep the brave, who sink to rest. Forget not
yet.</p>
<p>"There's good money in undertaking," said George Graves. "Mr.
Powell's well off."</p>
<p>Eugene's eyes were glued on the lantern face of "Horse" Hines.
He beat the air with a convulsive arm, and sank his fingers in
his throat.</p>
<p>"What's the matter?" cried George Graves.</p>
<p>"They shall not bury me alive," he said.</p>
<p>"You can't tell," George Graves said gloomily. "It's been
known to happen. They've dug them up later and found them turned
over on their faces."</p>
<p>Eugene shuddered. "I think," he suggested painfully, "they're
supposed to take out your insides when they embalm you."</p>
<p>"Yes," said George Graves more hopefully, "and that stuff they
use would kill you anyway. They pump you full of it."</p>
<p>With shrunken heart, Eugene considered. The ghost of old fear,
that had been laid for years, walked forth to haunt him.</p>
<p>In his old fantasies of death he had watched his living
burial, had foreseen his waking life-in-death, his slow,
frustrated efforts to push away the smothering flood of earth
until, as a drowning swimmer claws the air, his mute and
stiffened fingers thrust from the ground a call for hands.</p>
<p>Fascinated, they stared through screen-doors down the dark
central corridor, flanked by jars of weeping ferns. A sweet
funereal odor of carnations and cedar-wood floated on the cool
heavy air. Dimly, beyond a central partition, they saw a heavy
casket, on a wheeled trestle, with rich silver handles and velvet
coverings. The thick light faded there in dark.</p>
<p>"They're laid out in the room behind," said George Graves,
lowering his voice.</p>
<p>To rot away into a flower, to melt into a tree with the
friendless bodies of unburied men.</p>
<p>At this moment, having given to misery all he had (a tear),
the very Reverend Father James O'Haley, S.J., among the faithless
faithful only he, unshaken, unseduced, unterrified, emerged
plumply from the chapel, walked up the soft aisle rug with brisk
short- legged strides, and came out into the light. His pale blue
eyes blinked rapidly for a moment, his plump uncreased face set
firmly in a smile of quiet benevolence; he covered himself with a
small well-kept hat of black velvet, and set off toward the
avenue. Eugene shrank back gently as the little man walked past
him: that small priestly figure in black bore on him the awful
accolade of his great Mistress, that smooth face had heard the
unutterable, seen the unknowable. In this remote outpost of the
mighty Church, he was the standard-bearer of the one true faith,
the consecrate flesh of God.</p>
<p>"They don't get any pay," said George Graves sorrowfully.</p>
<p>"How do they live, then?" Eugene asked.</p>
<p>"Don't you worry!" said George Graves, with a knowing
smile.</p>
<p>"They get all that's coming to them. He doesn't seem to be
starving, does he?"</p>
<p>"No," said Eugene, "he doesn't."</p>
<p>"He lives on the fat of the land," said George Graves. "Wine
at every meal. There are some rich Catholics in this town."</p>
<p>"Yes," said Eugene. "Frank Moriarty's got a pot full of money
that he made selling licker."</p>
<p>"Don't let them hear you," said George Graves, with a surly
laugh. "They've got a family tree and a coat of arms
already."</p>
<p>"A beer-bottle rampant on a field of limburger cheese, gules,"
said Eugene.</p>
<p>"They're trying to get the Princess Madeleine into Society,"
said George Graves.</p>
<p>"Hell fire!" Eugene cried, grinning. "Let's let her in, if
that's all she wants. We belong to the Younger Set, don't
we?"</p>
<p>"You may," said George Graves, reeling with laughter, "but I
don't. I wouldn't be caught dead with the little pimps."</p>
<p>"Mr. Eugene Gant was the host last night at a hot wienie roast
given to members of the local Younger Set at Dixieland, the
beautiful old ancestral mansion of his mother, Mrs. Eliza
Gant."</p>
<p>George Graves staggered. "You oughtn't to say that, 'Gene," he
gasped. He shook his head reproachfully. "Your mother's a fine
woman."</p>
<p>"During the course of the evening, the Honorable George
Graves, the talented scion of one of our oldest and wealthiest
families, the Chesterfield Graveses, ($10 a week and up),
rendered a few appropriate selections on the jews-harp."</p>
<p>Pausing deliberately, George Graves wiped his streaming eyes,
and blew his nose. In the windows of Bain's millinery store, a
waxen nymph bore a confection of rakish plumes upon her false
tresses, and extended her simpering fingers in elegant
counterpoise. Hats For Milady. O that those lips had
language.</p>
<p>At this moment, with a smooth friction of trotting rumps, the
death-wagon of Rogers-Malone turned swiftly in from the avenue,
and wheeled by on ringing hoofs. They turned curiously and
watched it draw up to the curb.</p>
<p>"Another Redskin bit the dust," said George Graves.</p>
<p>Come, delicate death, serenely arriving, arriving.</p>
<p>"Horse" Hines came out quickly on long flapping legs, and
opened the doors behind. In another moment, with the help of the
two men on the driver's seat, he had lowered the long wicker
basket gently, and vanished, quietly, gravely, into the fragrant
gloom of his establishment.</p>
<p>As Eugene watched, the old fatality of place returned. Each
day, he thought, we pass the spot where some day we must die; or
shall I, too, ride dead to some mean building yet unknown? Shall
this bright clay, the hill-bound, die in lodgings yet unbuilt?
Shall these eyes, drenched with visions yet unseen, stored with
the viscous and interminable seas at dawn, with the sad comfort
of unfulfilled Arcadias, seal up their cold dead dreams upon a
tick, as this, in time, in some hot village of the plains?</p>
<p>He caught and fixed the instant. A telegraph messenger wheeled
vigorously in from the avenue with pumping feet, curved widely
into the alley at his right, jerking his wheel up sharply as he
took the curb and coasted down to the delivery boy's entrance.
And post o'er land and ocean without rest. Milton, thou shouldst
be living at this hour.</p>
<p>Descending the dark stairs of the Medical Building slowly,
Mrs. Thomas Hewitt, the comely wife of the prominent attorney (of
Arthur, Hewitt, and Grey), turned out into the light, and
advanced slowly toward the avenue. She was greeted with
flourishing gestures of the hat by Henry T. Merriman (Merriman
and Merriman), and Judge Robert C. Allan, professional colleagues
of her husband. She smiled and shot each quickly with a glance.
Pleasant is this flesh. When she had passed they looked after her
a moment. Then they continued their discussion of the courts.</p>
<p>On the third floor of the First National Bank building on the
right hand corner, Fergus Paston, fifty-six, a thin lecherous
mouth between iron-gray dundrearies, leaned his cocked leg upon
his open window, and followed the movements of Miss Bernie
Powers, twenty- two, crossing the street. Even in our ashes live
their wonted fires.</p>
<p>On the opposite corner, Mrs. Roland Rawls, whose husband was
manager of the Peerless Pulp Company (Plant No. 3), and whose
father owned it, emerged from the rich seclusion of Arthur N.
Wright, jeweller. She clasped her silver mesh-bag and stepped
into her attendant Packard. She was a tall black-haired woman of
thirty-three with a good figure: her face was dull, flat, and
Mid- western.</p>
<p>"She's the one with the money," said George Graves. "He hasn't
a damn thing. It's all in her name. She wants to be an opera
singer."</p>
<p>"Can she sing?"</p>
<p>"Not worth a damn," said George Graves. "I've heard her.
There's your chance, 'Gene. She's got a daughter about your
age."</p>
<p>"What does she do?" said Eugene.</p>
<p>"She wants to be an actress," said George Graves, laughing
throatily.</p>
<p>"You have to work too damn hard for your money," said
Eugene.</p>
<p>They had reached the corner by the Bank, and now halted,
indecisively, looking up the cool gulch of afternoon. The street
buzzed with a light gay swarm of idlers: the faces of the virgins
bloomed in and out like petals on a bough. Advancing upon him, an
inch to the second, Eugene saw, ten feet away, the heavy
paralyzed body of old Mr. Avery. He was a very great scholar,
stone-deaf, and seventy-eight years old. He lived alone in a room
above the Public Library. He had neither friends nor connections.
He was a myth.</p>
<p>"Oh, my God!" said Eugene. "Here he comes!"</p>
<p>It was too late for escape.</p>
<p>Gasping a welcome, Mr. Avery bore down on him, with a violent
shuffle of his feet and a palsied tattoo of his heavy stick which
brought him over the intervening three yards in forty
seconds.</p>
<p>"Well, young fellow," he panted, "how's Latin?"</p>
<p>"Fine," Eugene screamed into his pink ear.</p>
<p>"Poeta nascitur, non fit," said Mr. Avery, and went off into a
silent wheeze of laughter which brought on a fit of coughing
strangulation. His eyes bulged, his tender pink skin grew
crimson, he roared his terror out in a phlegmy rattle, while his
goose-white hand trembled frantically for his handkerchief. A
crowd gathered. Eugene quickly drew a dirty handkerchief from the
old man's pocket, and thrust it into his hands. He tore up from
his convulsed organs a rotting mass, and panted rapidly for
breath. The crowd dispersed somewhat dejectedly.</p>
<p>George Graves grinned darkly. "That's too bad," he said. "You
oughtn't to laugh, 'Gene." He turned away, gurgling.</p>
<p>"Can you conjugate?" gasped Mr. Avery. "Here's the way I
learned:</p>
<blockquote>"Amo, amas,<br>
I love a lass.<br>
Amat,<br>
He loves her, too."</blockquote>
<p>Quivering with tremors of laughter, he launched himself again.
Because he could not leave them, save by the inch, they moved off
several yards to the curb. Grow old along with me!</p>
<p>"That's a damn shame," said George Graves, looking after him
and shaking his head. "Where's he going?"</p>
<p>"To supper," said Eugene.</p>
<p>"To supper!" said George Graves. "It's only four o'clock.
Where does he eat?"</p>
<p>Not where he eats, but where he is eaten.</p>
<p>"At the Uneeda," said Eugene, beginning to choke, "It takes
him two hours to get there."</p>
<p>"Does he go every day?" said George Graves, beginning to
laugh.</p>
<p>"Three times a day," Eugene screamed. "He spends all morning
going to dinner, and all afternoon going to supper."</p>
<p>A whisper of laughter came from their weary jaws. They sighed
like sedge.</p>
<p>At this moment, dodging briskly through the crowd, with a loud
and cheerful word for every one, Mr. Joseph Bailey, secretary of
the Altamont Chamber of Commerce, short, broad, and ruddy, came
up by them with a hearty gesture of the hand:</p>
<p>"Hello, boys!" he cried. "How're they going?" But before
either of them could answer, he had passed on, with an
encouraging shake of his head, and a deep applauding "THAT'S
right."</p>
<p>"WHAT'S right?" said Eugene.</p>
<p>But before George Graves could answer, the great lung
specialist, Dr. Fairfax Grinder, scion of one of the oldest and
proudest families in Virginia, drove in viciously from Church
Street, with his sinewy length of six feet and eight inches
coiled tensely in the deep pit of his big Buick roadster. Cursing
generally the whole crawling itch of Confederate and Yankee
postwar rabbledom, with a few special parentheses for Jews and
niggers, he drove full tilt at the short plump figure of Joe
Zamschnick, men's furnishings ("Just a Whisper Off The
Square").</p>
<p>Joseph, two yards away from legal safety, hurled himself with
a wild scream headlong at the curb. He arrived on hands and
knees, but under his own power.</p>
<p>"K-hurses!" said Eugene. "Foiled again."</p>
<p>'Twas true! Dr. Fairfax Grinder's lean bristled upper lip drew
back over his strong yellow teeth. He jammed on his brakes, and
lifted his car round with a complete revolution of his long arms.
Then he roared away through scattering traffic, in a greasy blue
cloud of gasoline and burnt rubber.</p>
<p>Joe Zamschnick frantically wiped his gleaming bald head with a
silk handkerchief and called loudly on the public to bear
witness.</p>
<p>"What's the matter with him?" said George Graves,
disappointed. "He usually goes up on the sidewalk after them if
he can't get them on the street."</p>
<p>On the other side of the street, attracting no more than a
languid stare from the loafing natives, the Honorable William
Jennings Bryan paused benevolently before the windows of the H.
Martin Grimes Bookstore, allowing the frisking breeze to toy
pleasantly with his famous locks. The tangles of Neaera's
hair.</p>
<p>The Commoner stared carefully at the window display which
included several copies of Before Adam, by Jack London. Then he
entered, and selected a dozen views of Altamont and the
surrounding hills.</p>
<p>"He may come here to live," said George Graves. "Dr. Doak's
offered to give him a house and lot in Doak Park."</p>
<p>"Why?" said Eugene.</p>
<p>"Because the advertising will be worth a lot to the town,"
said George Graves.</p>
<p>A little before them, that undaunted daughter of desires, Miss
Elizabeth Scragg, emerged from Woolworth's Five and Ten Cent
Store, and turned up toward the Square. Smiling, she acknowledged
the ponderous salute of Big Jeff White, the giant half-owner of
the Whitstone hotel, whose fortunes had begun when he had refused
to return to his old comrade, Dickson Reese, the embezzling
cashier, ninety thousand dollars of entrusted loot. Dog eat dog.
Thief catch thief. It is not growing like a tree, in bulk doth
make man better be.</p>
<p>His six-and-a-half-foot shadow flitted slowly before them. He
passed, in creaking number twelves, a massive smooth-jowled man
with a great paunch girdled in a wide belt.</p>
<p>Across the street again, before the windows of the Van W.
Yeats Shoe Company, the Reverend J. Brooks Gall, Amherst ('61),
and as loyal a Deke as ever breathed, but looking only sixty of
his seventy-three years, paused in his brisk walk, and engaged in
sprightly monologue, three of his fellow Boy Scouts&mdash;the
Messrs. Lewis Monk, seventeen, Bruce Rogers, thirteen, and
Malcolm Hodges, fourteen. None knew as well as he the heart of a
boy. He, too, it seems, had once been one himself. Thus, as one
bright anecdote succeeded, or suggested, a half-dozen others,
they smiled dutifully, with attentive respect, below the lifted
barrier of his bristly white mustache, into the gleaming rhyme of
his false teeth. And, with rough but affectionate camaraderie, he
would pause from time to time to say: "Old Male!" or "Old Bruce!"
gripping firmly his listener's arm, shaking him gently. Pallidly,
on restless feet, they smiled, plotting escape with slant-eyed
stealth.</p>
<p>Mr. Buse, the Oriental rug merchant, came around the corner
below them from Liberty Street. His broad dark face was wreathed
in Persian smiles. I met a traveller from an antique land.</p>
<p>In the Bijou Cafe for Ladies and Gents, Mike, the counter man,
leaned his hairy arms upon the marble slab, and bent his wrinkled
inch of brow upon a week-old copy of Atlantis. Fride Chicken To-
day with Sweet Potatos. Hail to thee, blithe spirit, bird thou
never wert. A solitary fly darted swiftly about the greasy cover
of a glass humidor, under which a leathery quarter of mince pie
lay weltering. Spring had come.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, having completed twice their parade up and down the
street from the Square to the post-office, the Misses Christine
Ball, Viola Powell, Aline Rollins, and Dorothy Hazzard were
accosted outside Wood's Drug Store by Tom French, seventeen, Roy
Duncan, nineteen, and Carl Jones, eighteen.</p>
<p>"Where do you think you're going?" said Tom French,
insolently.</p>
<p>Gayly, brightly, in unison, they answered:</p>
<p>"Hey&mdash;ee!"</p>
<p>"Hay's seven dollars a ton," said Roy Duncan, and immediately
burst into a high cackle of laughter, in which all the others
joined, merrily.</p>
<p>"You craz-ee!" said Viola Powell tenderly. Tell me, ye
merchants' daughters, did ye see another creature fair and wise
as she.</p>
<p>"Mr. Duncan," said Tom French, turning his proud ominous face
upon his best friend, "I want you to meet a friend of mine, Miss
Rollins."</p>
<p>"I think I've met this man somewhere before," said Aline
Rollins. Another Splendor on his mouth alit.</p>
<p>"Yes," said Roy Duncan, "I go there often."</p>
<p>His small tight freckled impish face creased again by his high
cackle. All I could never be. They moved into the store, where
drouthy neibors neibors meet, through the idling group of
fountain gallants.</p>
<p>Mr. Henry Sorrell (It Can Be Done), and Mr. John T. Howland
(We Sell Lots and Lots of Lots), emerged, beyond Arthur N.
Wright's, jeweller, from the gloomy dusk of the Gruner Building.
Each looked into the sub-divisions of the other's heart; their
eyes kept the great Vision of the guarded mount as swiftly they
turned into Church Street where Sorrell's Hudson was parked.</p>
<p>White-vested, a trifle paunchy, with large broad feet, a
shaven moon of red face, and abundant taffy-colored hair, the
Reverend John Smallwood, pastor of the First Baptist Church,
walked heavily up the street, greeting his parishioners warmly,
and hoping to see his Pilot face to face. Instead, however, he
encountered the Honorable William Jennings Bryan, who was coming
slowly out of the bookstore. The two close friends greeted each
other affectionately, and, with a firm friendly laying on of
hands, gave each to each the Christian aid of a benevolent
exorcism.</p>
<p>"Just the man I was looking for," said Brother Smallwood. In
silence, slowly, they shook hands for several seconds. Silence
was pleased.</p>
<p>"That," observed the Commoner with grave humor, "is what I
thought the Great American People said to me on three occasions."
It was a favorite jest&mdash;ripe with wisdom, mellowed by the
years, yet, withal, so characteristic of the man. The deep
furrows of his mouth widened in a smile. Our master&mdash;famous,
calm, and dead.</p>
<p>Passed, on catspaw rubber tread, from the long dark bookstore,
Professor L. B. Dunn, principal of Graded School No. 3,
Montgomery Avenue. He smiled coldly at them with a gimlet
narrowing of his spectacled eyes. The tell-tale cover of The New
Republic peeked from his pocket. Clamped under his lean and
freckled arm were new library copies of The Great Illusion, by
Norman Angell, and The Ancient Grudge, by Owen Wister. A lifelong
advocate of a union of the two great English-speaking (sic)
nations, making together irresistibly for peace, truth, and
righteousness in a benevolent but firm authority over the less
responsible elements of civilization, he passed, the Catholic
man, pleasantly dedicated to the brave adventuring of minds and
the salvaging of mankind. Ah, yes!</p>
<p>"And how are you and the Good Woman enjoying your sojourn in
the Land of the Sky?" said the Reverend John Smallwood.</p>
<p>"Our only regret," said the Commoner, "is that our visit here
must be measured by days and not by months. Nay, by years."</p>
<p>Mr. Richard Gorman, twenty-six, city reporter of The Citizen,
strode rapidly up the street, with proud cold news-nose lifted.
His complacent smile, hard-lipped, loosened into servility.</p>
<p>"Ah, there, Dick," said John Smallwood, clasping his hand
affectionately, and squeezing his arm. "Just the man I was
looking for. Do you know Mr. Bryan?"</p>
<p>"As fellow newspaper men," said the Commoner, "Dick and I have
been close friends for&mdash;how many years is it, my boy?"</p>
<p>"Three, I think, sir," said Mr. Gorman, blushing prettily.</p>
<p>"I wish you could have been here, Dick," said the Reverend
Smallwood, "to hear what Mr. Bryan was saying about us. The good
people of this town would be mighty proud to hear it."</p>
<p>"I'd like another statement from you before you go, Mr.
Bryan," said Richard Gorman. "There's a story going the rounds
that you may make your home with us in the future."</p>
<p>When questioned by a Citizen reporter, Mr. Bryan refused
either to confirm or deny the rumor:</p>
<p>"I may have a statement to make later," he observed with a
significant smile, "but at present I must content myself by
saying that if I could have chosen the place of my birth, I could
not have found a fairer spot than this wonderland of nature."</p>
<p>Earthly Paradise, thinks Commoner.</p>
<p>"I have travelled far in my day," continued the man who had
been chosen three times by a great Party to contend for the
highest honor within the gift of the people. "I have gone from
the woods of Maine to the wave-washed sands of Florida, from
Hatteras to Halifax, and from the summits of the Rockies to where
Missouri rolls her turgid flood, but I have seen few spots that
equal, and none that surpass, the beauty of this mountain
Eden."</p>
<p>The reporter made notes rapidly.</p>
<p>The years of his glory washed back to him upon the rolling
tides of rhetoric&mdash;the great lost days of the first crusade
when the money barons trembled beneath the shadow of the Cross of
Gold, and Bryan! Bryan! Bryan! Bryan! burned through the land
like a comet. Ere I was old. 1896. Ah, woeful ere, which tells me
youth's no longer here.</p>
<p>Foresees Dawn of New Era.</p>
<p>When pressed more closely by the reporter as to his future
plans, Mr. Bryan replied:</p>
<p>"My schedule is completely filled, for months to come, with
speaking engagements that will take me from one end of the
country to the other, in the fight I am making for the reduction
of the vast armaments that form the chief obstacle to the reign
of peace on earth, good-will to men. After that, who knows?" he
said, flashing his famous smile. "Perhaps I shall come back to
this beautiful region, and take up my life among my good friends
here as one who, having fought the good fight, deserves to spend
the declining years of his life not only within sight, but within
the actual boundaries, of the happy land of Canaan."</p>
<p>Asked if he could predict with any certainty the date of his
proposed retirement, the Commoner answered characteristically
with the following beautiful quotation from Longfellow:</p>
<blockquote>"When the war-drum throbbed no longer,<br>
And the battle-flags were furled<br>
In the Parliament of man,<br>
The Federation of the world."</blockquote>
<p>The magic cell of music&mdash;the electric piano in the
shallow tiled lobby of Altamont's favorite cinema, the Ajax,
stopped playing with firm, tinny abruptness, hummed ominously for
a moment, and without warning commenced anew. It's a long way to
Tipperary. The world shook with the stamp of marching men.</p>
<p>Miss Margaret Blanchard and Mrs. C. M. McReady, the druggist's
drugged wife who, by the white pitted fabric of her skin, and the
wide bright somnolence of her eyes, on honey-dew had fed too
often, came out of the theatre and turned down toward Wood's
pharmacy.</p>
<p>To-day: Maurice Costello and Edith M. Storey in Throw Out the
Lifeline, a Vitagraph Release.</p>
<p>Goggling, his great idiot's head lolling on his scrawny neck,
wearing the wide-rimmed straw hat that covered him winter and
summer, Willie Goff, the pencil merchant, jerked past, with
inward lunges of his crippled right foot. The fingers of his
withered arm pointed stiffly toward himself, beckoning to him,
and touching him as he walked with stiff jerking taps, in a
terrible parody of vanity. A gaudy handkerchief with blue, yellow
and crimson patterns hung in a riotous blot from his
breast-pocket over his neatly belted gray Norfolk jacket, a wide
loose collar of silk barred with red and orange stripes flowered
across his narrow shoulders. In his lapel a huge red carnation.
His thin face, beneath the jutting globular head, grinned
constantly, glutting his features with wide, lapping, receding,
returning, idiot smiles. For should he live a thousand years, he
never will be out of humor. He burred ecstatically at the
passers-by, who grinned fondly at him, and continued down to
Wood's where he was greeted with loud cheers and laughter by a
group of young men who loitered at the fountain's end. They
gathered around him boisterously, pounding his back and drawing
him up to the fountain. Pleased, he looked at them warmly,
gratefully. He was touched and happy.</p>
<p>"What're you having, Willie?" said Mr. Tobias Pottle.</p>
<p>"Give me a dope," said Willie Goff to the grinning jerker, "a
dope and lime."</p>
<p>Pudge Carr, the politician's son, laughed hilariously. "Want a
dope and lime, do you, Willie?" he said, and struck him heavily
on the back. His thick stupid face composed itself.</p>
<p>"Have a cigarette, Willie," he said, offering the package to
Willie Goff.</p>
<p>"What's yours?" said the jerker to Toby Pottle.</p>
<p>"Give me a dope, too."</p>
<p>"I don't want anything," said Pudge Carr. Such drinks as made
them nobly wild, not mad.</p>
<p>Pudge Carr held a lighted match to Willie's cigarette, winking
slowly at Brady Chalmers, a tall, handsome fellow, with black
hair, and a long dark face. Willie Goff drew in on his cigarette,
lighting it with dry smacking lips. He coughed, removed the weed,
and held it awkwardly between his thumb and forefinger, looking
at it, curiously.</p>
<p>They sputtered with laughter, involved and lost in clouds of
fume, and guzzling deep, the boor, the lackey, and the groom.</p>
<p>Brady Chalmers took Willie's colored handkerchief gently from
his pocket and held it up for their inspection. Then he folded it
carefully and put it back.</p>
<p>"What are you all dressed up about, Willie?" he said. "You
must be going to see your girl."</p>
<p>Willie Goff grinned cunningly.</p>
<p>Toby Pottle blew a luxurious jet of smoke through his
nostrils. He was twenty-four, carefully groomed, with slick blond
hair, and a pink massaged face.</p>
<p>"Come on, Willie," he said, blandly, quietly, "you've got a
girl, haven't you?"</p>
<p>Willie Goff leered knowingly; at the counter-end, Tim McCall,
twenty-eight, who had been slowly feeding cracked ice from his
cupped fist into his bloated whisky-fierce jowls, collapsed
suddenly, blowing a bright rattling hail upon the marble
ledge.</p>
<p>"I've got several," said Willie Goff. "A fellow's got to have
a little Poon-Tang, hasn't he?"</p>
<p>Flushed with high ringing laughter, they smiled, spoke
respectfully, uncovered before Miss Tot Webster, Miss Mary
McGraw, and Miss Martha Cotton, older members of the Younger Set.
They called for stronger music, louder wine.</p>
<p>"How do you do?"</p>
<p>"Aha! Aha!" said Brady Chalmers to Miss Mary McGraw. "Where
were YOU that time?"</p>
<p>"YOU'LL never know," she called back. It was between
them&mdash;their little secret. They laughed knowingly with joy
of possession.</p>
<p>"Come on back, Pudge," said Euston Phipps, their escort. "You
too, Brady." He followed the ladies back&mdash;tall, bold,
swagger&mdash;a young alcoholic with one sound lung. He was a
good golfer.</p>
<p>Pert boys rushed from the crowded booths and tables to the
fountain, coming up with a long slide. They shouted their orders
rudely, nagging the swift jerkers glibly, stridently.</p>
<p>"All right, son. Two dopes and a mint Limeade. Make it
snappy."</p>
<p>"Do you work around here, boy?"</p>
<p>The jerkers moved in ragtime tempo, juggling the drinks,
tossing scooped globes of ice-cream into the air and catching
them in glasses, beating swift rhythms with a spoon.</p>
<p>Seated alone, with thick brown eyes above her straw regardant,
Mrs. Thelma Jarvis, the milliner, drew, in one swizzling guzzle,
the last beaded chain of linked sweetness long drawn out from the
bottom of her glass. Drink to me only with thine eyes. She rose
slowly, looking into the mirror of her open purse. Then,
fluescent, her ripe limbs moulded in a dress of silk henna, she
writhed carefully among the crowded tables, with a low rich
murmur of contrition. Her voice was ever soft, gentle, and
low&mdash;an excellent thing in a woman. The high light chatter
of the tables dropped as she went by. For God's sake, hold your
tongue and let me love! On amber undulant limbs she walked slowly
up the aisle past perfume, stationery, rubber goods, and toilet
preparations, pausing at the cigar counter to pay her check. Her
round, melon- heavy breasts nodded their heads in slow but
sprightly dance. A poet could not but be gay, in such a jocund
company.</p>
<p>But&mdash;at the entrance, standing in the alcove by the
magazine rack, Mr. Paul Goodson, of the Dependable Life, closed
his long grinning dish-face abruptly, and ceased talking. He
doffed his hat without effusiveness, as did his companion, Coston
Smathers, the furniture man (you furnish the girl, we furnish the
house). They were both Baptists.</p>
<p>Mrs. Thelma Jarvis turned her warm ivory stare upon them,
parted her full small mouth in a remote smile, and passed,
ambulant. When she had gone they turned to each other, grinning
quietly. We'll be waiting at the river. Swiftly they glanced
about them. No one had seen.</p>
<p>Patroness of all the arts, but particular sponsor for Music,
Heavenly Maid, Mrs. Franz Wilhelm Von Zeck, wife of the noted
lung specialist, and the discoverer of Von Zeck's serum, came
imperially from the doors of the Fashion Mart, and was handed
tenderly into the receiving cushions of her Cadillac by Mr. Louis
Rosalsky. Benevolently but distantly she smiled down upon him:
the white parchment of his hard Polish face was broken by a grin
of cruel servility curving up around the wings of his immense
putty-colored nose. Frau Von Zeck settled her powerful chins upon
the coarse shelving of her Wagnerian breasts and, her ponderous
gaze already dreaming on remote philanthropies, was charioted
smoothly away from the devoted tradesman. Nur wer die Sehnsucht
kennt, weiss was Ich leide.</p>
<p>Mr. Rosalsky returned into his store.</p>
<p>For the third time the Misses Mildred Shuford, Helen
Pendergast, and Mary Catherine Bruce drove by, clustered together
like unpicked cherries in the front seat of Miss Shuford's Reo.
They passed, searching the pavements with eager, haughty eyes,
pleased at their proud appearance. They turned up Liberty Street
on their fourth swing round the circle. Waltz me around again,
Willie.</p>
<p>"Do you know how to dance, George?" Eugene asked. His heart
was full of bitter pride and fear.</p>
<p>"Yes," said George Graves absently, "a little bit. I don't
like it." He lifted his brooding eyes.</p>
<p>"Say, 'Gene," he said, "how much do you think Dr. Von Zeck is
worth?"</p>
<p>He answered Eugene's laughter with a puzzled sheepish
grin.</p>
<p>"Come on," said Eugene. "I'll match you for a drink."</p>
<p>They dodged nimbly across the narrow street, amid the
thickening afternoon traffic.</p>
<p>"It's getting worse all the time," said George Graves. "The
people who laid the town out didn't have any vision. What's it
going to be like, ten years from now?"</p>
<p>"They could widen the streets, couldn't they?" said
Eugene.</p>
<p>"No. Not now. You'd have to move all the buildings back.
Wonder how much it would cost?" said George Graves
thoughtfully.</p>
<p>"And if we don't," Professor L. B. Dunn's precise voice
sounded its cold warning, "their next move will be directed
against us. You may yet live to see the day when the iron heel of
militarism is on your neck, and the armed forces of the Kaiser do
the goose-step up and down this street. When that day
comes&mdash;"</p>
<p>"I don't put any stock in those stories," said Mr. Bob Webster
rudely and irreverently. He was a small man, with a gray, mean
face, violent and bitter. A chronic intestinal sourness seemed to
have left its print upon his features. "In my opinion, it's all
propaganda. Those Germans are too damn good for them, that's all.
They're beginning to call for calf-rope."</p>
<p>"When that day comes," Professor Dunn implacably continued,
"remember what I told you. The German government has
imperialistic designs upon the whole of the world. It is looking
to the day when it shall have all mankind under the yoke of Krupp
and Kultur. The fate of civilization is hanging in the balance.
Mankind is at the crossroads. I pray God it shall not be said
that we were found wanting. I pray God that this free people may
never suffer as little Belgium suffered, that our wives and
daughters may not be led off into slavery or shame, our children
maimed and slaughtered."</p>
<p>"It's not our fight," said Mr. Bob Webster. "I don't want to
send my boys three thousand miles across the sea to get shot for
those foreigners. If they come over here, I'll shoulder a gun
with the best of them, but until they do they can fight it out
among themselves. Isn't that right, Judge?" he said, turning
toward the party of the third part, Judge Walter C. Jeter, of the
Federal Circuit, who had fortunately been a close friend of
Grover Cleveland. Ancestral voices prophesying war.</p>
<p>"Did you know the Wheeler boys?" Eugene asked George Graves.
"Paul and Clifton?"</p>
<p>"Yes," said George Graves. "They went away and joined the
French army. They're in the Foreign Legion."</p>
<p>"They're in the aviation part of it," said Eugene. "The
Lafayette Eskydrill. Clifton Wheeler has shot down more than six
Germans."</p>
<p>"The boys around here didn't like him," said George Graves.
"They thought he was a sissy."</p>
<p>Eugene winced slightly at the sound of the word.</p>
<p>"How old was he?" he asked.</p>
<p>"He was a grown man," said George. "Twenty-two or three."</p>
<p>Disappointed, Eugene considered his chance of glory. (Ich bin
ja noch ein Kind.)</p>
<p>"&mdash;But fortunately," continued Judge Walter C. Jeter
deliberately, "we have a man in the White House on whose
far-seeing statesmanship we can safely rely. Let us trust to the
wisdom of his leadership, obeying, in word and spirit, the
principles of strict neutrality, accepting only as a last resort
a course that would lead this great nation again into the
suffering and tragedy of war, which," his voice sank to a
whisper, "God forbid!"</p>
<p>Thinking of a more ancient war, in which he had borne himself
gallantly, Colonel James Buchanan Pettigrew, head of the
Pettigrew Military Academy (Est. 1789), rode by in his open
victoria, behind an old negro driver and two well-nourished brown
mares. There was a good brown smell of horse and sweat-cured
leather. The old negro snaked his whip gently across the sleek
trotting rumps, growling softly.</p>
<p>Colonel Pettigrew was wrapped to his waist in a heavy rug, his
shoulders were covered with a gray Confederate cape. He bent
forward, leaning his old weight upon a heavy polished stick,
which his freckled hand gripped upon the silver knob. Muttering,
his proud powerful old head turned shakily from side to side,
darting fierce splintered glances at the drifting crowd. He was a
very parfit gentil knight.</p>
<p>He muttered.</p>
<p>"Suh?" said the negro, pulling in on his reins, and turning
around.</p>
<p>"Go on! Go on, you scoundrel!" said Colonel Pettigrew.</p>
<p>"Yes, suh," said the negro. They drove on.</p>
<p>In the crowd of loafing youngsters that stood across the
threshold of Wood's pharmacy, Colonel Pettigrew's darting eyes
saw two of his own cadets. They were pimply youths, with slack
jaws and a sloppy carriage.</p>
<p>He muttered his disgust. Not the same! Not the same! Nothing
the same! In his proud youth, in the only war that mattered,
Colonel Pettigrew had marched at the head of his own cadets.
There were 117, sir, all under nineteen. They stepped forward to
a man...until not a single commissioned officer was left...36
came back ...since 1789...it must go on!...19, sir&mdash;all
under one hundred and seventeen...must...go...on!</p>
<p>His sagging cheek-flanks trembled gently. The horses trotted
out of sight around the corner, with a smooth-spoked rumble of
rubber tires.</p>
<p>George Graves and Eugene entered Wood's pharmacy and stood up
to the counter. The elder soda-jerker, scowling, drew a sopping
rag across a puddle of slop upon the marble slab.</p>
<p>"What's yours?" he said irritably.</p>
<p>"I want a chock-lut milk," said Eugene.</p>
<p>"Make it two," added George Graves.</p>
<p>O for a draught of vintage that hath been cooled a long age in
the deep-delv&egrave;d earth!</p>
<h3>25</h3>
<p>Yes. The enormous crime had been committed. And, for almost a
year, Eugene had been maintaining a desperate neutrality. His
heart, however, was not neutral. The fate of civilization, it
appeared, hung in the balance.</p>
<p>The war had begun at the peak of the summer season. Dixieland
was full. His closest friend at the time was a sharp old
spinstress with frayed nerves, who had been for thirty years a
teacher of English in a New York City public school. Day by day,
after the murder of the Grand Duke, they watched the tides of
blood and desolation mount through the world. Miss Crane's thin
red nostrils quivered with indignation. Her old gray eyes were
sharp with anger. The idea! The idea!</p>
<p>For, of all the English, none can show a loftier or more
inspired love for Albion's Isle than American ladies who teach
its noble tongue.</p>
<p>Eugene was also faithful. With Miss Crane he kept a face of
mournful regret, but his heart drummed a martial tattoo against
his ribs. The air was full of fifes and flutes; he heard the
ghostly throbbing of great guns.</p>
<p>"We must be fair!" said Margaret Leonard. "We must be fair!"
But her eyes darkened when she read the news of England's entry,
and her throat was trembling like a bird's. When she looked up
her eyes were wet.</p>
<p>"Ah, Lord!" she said. "You'll see things now."</p>
<p>"Little Bobs!" roared Sheba.</p>
<p>"God bless him! Did you see where he's going to take the
field?"</p>
<p>John Dorsey Leonard laid down the paper, and bent over with
high drooling laughter.</p>
<p>"Lord a'mercy!" he gasped. "Let the rascals come now!"</p>
<p>Ah, well&mdash;they came.</p>
<p>All through that waning summer, Eugene shuttled frantically
from the school to Dixieland, unable, in the delirium of promised
glory, to curb his prancing limbs. He devoured every scrap of
news, and rushed to share it with the Leonards or Miss Crane. He
read every paper he could lay his hands on, exulting in the
defeats that were forcing the Germans back at every point. For,
he gathered from this wilderness of print, things were going
badly with the Huns. At a thousand points they fled squealing
before English steel at Mons, fell suppliantly before the French
charge along the Marne; withdrew here, gave way there, ran away
elsewhere. Then, one morning, when they should have been at
Cologne, they were lined up at the walls of Paris. They had run
in the wrong direction. The world grew dark. Desperately, he
tried to understand. He could not. By the extraordinary strategy
of always retreating, the German army had arrived before Paris.
It was something new in warfare. It was several years, in fact,
before Eugene could understand that some one in the German armies
had done some fighting.</p>
<p>John Dorsey Leonard was untroubled.</p>
<p>"You wait!" he said confidently. "You just wait, my sonny.
That old fellow Joffer knows what he's about. This is just what
he's been waiting for. Now he's got them where he wants
them."</p>
<p>Eugene wondered for what subtle reason a French general might
want a German army in Paris.</p>
<p>Margaret lifted her troubled eyes from the paper.</p>
<p>"It looks mighty serious," she said. "I tell you!" She was
silent a moment, a torrent of passion rose up in her throat. Then
she added in a low trembling voice: "If England goes, we all
go."</p>
<p>"God bless her!" Sheba yelled.</p>
<p>"God bless her, 'Gene," she continued, tapping him on the
knee. "When I stepped ashore on her dear old soil that time, I
just couldn't help myself. I didn't care what any one thought. I
knelt right down there in the dirt, and pretended to tie my shoe,
but say, boy"&mdash;her bleared eyes glistened through her
tears&mdash;"God bless her, I couldn't help it. Do you know what
I did? I leaned over and kissed her earth." Large gummy tears
rolled down her red cheeks. She was weeping loudly, but she went
on. "I said: This is the earth of Shakespeare, and Milton, and
John Keats and, by God, what's more, it's mine as well! God bless
her! God bless her!"</p>
<p>Tears flowed quietly from Margaret Leonard's eyes. Her face
was wet. She could not speak. They were all deeply moved.</p>
<p>"She won't go," said John Dorsey Leonard. "We'll have a word
to say to that! She won't go! You wait!"</p>
<p>In Eugene's fantasy there burned the fixed vision of the great
hands clasped across the sea, the flowering of green fields, and
the developing convolutions of a faery London&mdash;mighty,
elfin, old, a romantic labyrinth of ancient crowded ways, tall,
leaning houses, Lucullan food and drink, and the mad imperial
eyes of genius burning among the swarm of quaint originality.</p>
<p>As the war developed, and the literature of war-enchantment
began to appear, Margaret Leonard gave him book after book to
read. They were the books of the young men&mdash;the young men
who fought to blot out the evil of the world with their blood. In
her trembling voice she read to him Rupert Brooke's
sonnet&mdash;"If I should die, think only this of me"&mdash;and
she put a copy of Donald Hankey's A Student in Arms into his
hand, saying:</p>
<p>"Read this, boy. It will stir you as you've never been stirred
before. Those boys have seen the vision!"</p>
<p>He read it. He read many others. He saw the vision. He became
a member of this legion of chivalry&mdash;young
Galahad-Eugene&mdash;a spearhead of righteousness. He had gone
a-Grailing. He composed dozens of personal memoirs, into which
quietly, humorously, with fine-tempered English restraint, he
poured the full measure of his pure crusading heart. Sometimes,
he came through to the piping times of peace minus an arm, a leg,
or an eye, diminished but ennobled; sometimes his last radiant
words were penned on the eve of the attack that took his life.
With glistening eyes, he read his own epilogue, enjoyed his
post-mortem glory, as his last words were recorded and explained
by his editor. Then, witness of his own martyrdom, he dropped two
smoking tears upon his young slain body. Dulce et decorum est pro
patria mori.</p>
<p>Ben loped along, scowling, by Wood's pharmacy. As he passed
the idling group at the tiled entrance, he cast on them a look of
sudden fierce contempt. Then he laughed quietly, savagely.</p>
<p>"Oh, my God!" he said.</p>
<p>At the corner, scowling, he waited for Mrs. Pert to cross from
the Post Office. She came over slowly, reeling.</p>
<p>Having arranged to meet her later in the pharmacy, he crossed
over, and turned angularly down Federal Street behind the Post
Office. At the second entrance to the Doctors' and Surgeons'
Building, he turned in, and began to mount the dark creaking
stairs. Somewhere, with punctual developing monotony, a single
drop of water was falling into the wet black basin of a sink. He
paused in the wide corridor of the first floor to control the
nervous thudding of his heart. Then he walked half-way down and
entered the waiting-room of Dr. J. H. Coker. It was vacant.
Frowning, he sniffed the air. The whole building was sharp with
the clean nervous odor of antiseptics. A litter of
magazines&mdash;Life, Judge, The Literary Digest, and The
American&mdash;on the black mission table, told its story of
weary and distressed fumbling. The inner door opened and the
doctor's assistant, Miss Ray, came out. She had on her hat. She
was ready to depart.</p>
<p>"Do you want to see the doctor?" she asked.</p>
<p>"Yes," said Ben, "is he busy?"</p>
<p>"Come on in, Ben," said Coker, coming to the door. He took his
long wet cigar from his mouth, grinning yellowly. "That's all for
to-day, Laura. You can go."</p>
<p>"Good-bye," said Miss Laura Ray, departing.</p>
<p>Ben went into Coker's office. Coker closed the door and sat
down at his untidy desk.</p>
<p>"You'll be more comfortable if you lie down on that table," he
said grinning.</p>
<p>Ben gave the doctor's table a look of nausea.</p>
<p>"How many have died on that thing?" he asked. He sat down
nervously in a chair by the desk, and lighted a cigarette,
holding the flame to the charred end of cigar Coker thrust
forward.</p>
<p>"Well, what can I do for you, son?" he asked.</p>
<p>"I'm tired of pushing daisies here," said Ben. "I want to push
them somewhere else."</p>
<p>"What do you mean, Ben?"</p>
<p>"I suppose you've heard, Coker," said Ben quietly and
insultingly, "that there's a war going on in Europe. That is, if
you've learned to read the papers."</p>
<p>"No, I hadn't heard about it, son," said Coker, puffing slowly
and deeply. "I read a paper&mdash;the one that comes out in the
morning. I suppose they haven't got the news yet." He grinned
maliciously. "What do you want, Ben?"</p>
<p>"I'm thinking of going to Canada and enlisting," said Ben. "I
want you to tell me if I can get in."</p>
<p>Coker was silent a moment. He took the long chewed weed from
his mouth and looked at it thoughtfully.</p>
<p>"What do you want to do that for, Ben?" he said.</p>
<p>Ben got up suddenly, and went to the window. He cast his
cigarette away into the court. It struck the cement well with a
small dry plop. When he turned around, his sallow face had gone
white and passionate.</p>
<p>"In Christ's name, Coker," he said, "what's it all about? Are
you able to tell me? What in heaven's name are we here for?
You're a doctor&mdash;you ought to know something."</p>
<p>Coker continued to look at his cigar. It had gone out
again.</p>
<p>"Why?" he said deliberately. "Why should I know anything?"</p>
<p>"Where do we come from? Where do we go to? What are we here
for? What the hell is it all about?" Ben cried out furiously in a
rising voice. He turned bitterly, accusingly, on the older man.
"For God's sake, speak up, Coker. Don't sit there like a damned
tailor's dummy. Say something, won't you?"</p>
<p>"What do you want me to say?" said Coker. "What am I? a
mindreader? A spiritualist? I'm your physician, not your priest.
I've seen them born, and I've seen them die. What happens to them
before or after, I can't say."</p>
<p>"Damn that!" said Ben. "What happens to them in between?"</p>
<p>"You're as great an authority on that as I am, Ben," said
Coker. "What you want, son, is not a doctor, but a prophet."</p>
<p>"They come to you when they're sick, don't they?" said Ben.
"They all want to get well, don't they? You do your best to cure
them, don't you?"</p>
<p>"No," said Coker. "Not always. But I'll grant that I'm
supposed to. What of it?"</p>
<p>"You must all think that it's about something," said Ben, "or
you wouldn't do it!"</p>
<p>"A man must live, mustn't he?" said Coker with a grin.</p>
<p>"That's what I'm asking you, Coker. Why must he?"</p>
<p>"Why," said Coker, "in order to work nine hours a day in a
newspaper office, sleep nine hours, and enjoy the other six in
washing, shaving, dressing, eating at the Greasy Spoon, loafing
in front of Wood's, and occasionally taking the Merry Widow to
see Francis X. Bushman. Isn't that reason enough for any man? If
a man's hard-working and decent, and invests his money in the
Building and Loan every week, instead of squandering it on
cigarettes, coca-cola, and Kuppenheimer clothes, he may own a
little home some day." Coker's voice sank to a hush of reverence.
"He may even have his own car, Ben. Think of that! He can get in
it, and ride, and ride, and ride. He can ride all over these
damned mountains. He can be very, very happy. He can take
exercise regularly in the Y. M. C. A. and think only clean
thoughts. He can marry a good pure woman and have any number of
fine sons and daughters, all of whom may be brought up in the
Baptist, Methodist, or Presbyterian faiths, and given splendid
courses in Economics, Commercial Law, and the Fine Arts, at the
State university. There's plenty to live for, Ben. There's
something to keep you busy every moment."</p>
<p>"You're a great wit, Coker," Ben said, scowling. "You're as
funny as a crutch." He straightened his humped shoulders self-
consciously, and filled his lungs with air.</p>
<p>"Well, what about it?" he asked, with a nervous grin. "Am I
fit to go?"</p>
<p>"Let's see," said Coker deliberately, beginning to look him
over. "Feet&mdash;pigeon-toed, but good arch." He looked at Ben's
tan leathers closely.</p>
<p>"What's the matter, Coker?" said Ben. "Do you need your toes
to shoot a gun with?"</p>
<p>"How're your teeth, son?"</p>
<p>Ben drew back his thin lips and showed two rows of hard white
grinders. At the same moment, casually, swiftly, Coker prodded
him with a strong yellow finger in the solar plexis. His
distended chest collapsed; he bent over, laughing, and coughed
dryly. Coker turned away to his desk and picked up his cigar.</p>
<p>"What's the matter, Coker?" said Ben. "What's the idea?"</p>
<p>"That's all, son. I'm through with you," said Coker.</p>
<p>"Well, what about it?" said Ben nervously.</p>
<p>"What about what?"</p>
<p>"Am I all right?"</p>
<p>"Certainly you're all right," said Coker. He turned with
burning match. "Who said you weren't all right?"</p>
<p>Ben stared at him, scowling, with fear-bright eyes.</p>
<p>"Quit your kidding, Coker," he said. "I'm three times seven,
you know. Am I fit to go?"</p>
<p>"What's the rush?" said Coker. "The war's not over yet. We may
get into it before long. Why not wait a bit?"</p>
<p>"That means I'm not fit," said Ben. "What's the matter with
me, Coker?"</p>
<p>"Nothing," said Coker carefully. "You're a bit thin. A little
run down, aren't you, Ben? You need a little meat on those bones,
son. You can't sit on a stool at the Greasy Spoon, with a
cigarette in one hand and a cup of coffee in the other, and get
fat."</p>
<p>"Am I all right or not, Coker?"</p>
<p>Coker's long death's-head widened in a yellow grin.</p>
<p>"Yes," he said. "You're all right, Ben. You're one of the most
all right people I know."</p>
<p>Ben read the true answer in Coker's veined and weary eyes. His
own were sick with fear. But he said bitingly:</p>
<p>"Thanks, Coker. You're a lot of help. I appreciate what you've
done a lot. As a doctor, you're a fine first baseman."</p>
<p>Coker grinned. Ben left the office.</p>
<p>As he went out on the street he met Harry Tugman going down to
the paper office.</p>
<p>"What's the matter, Ben?" said Harry Tugman. "Feeling
sick?"</p>
<p>"Yes," said Ben, scowling at him. "I've just had a shot of
606."</p>
<p>He went up the street to meet Mrs. Pert.</p>
<h3>26</h3>
<p>In the autumn, at the beginning of his fifteenth
year&mdash;his last year at Leonard's&mdash;Eugene went to
Charleston on a short excursion. He found a substitute for his
paper route.</p>
<p>"Come on!" said Max Isaacs, whom he still occasionally saw.
"We're going to have a good time, son."</p>
<p>"Yeah, man!" said Malvin Bowden, whose mother was conducting
the tour. "You can still git beer in Charleston," he added with a
dissipated leer.</p>
<p>"You can go swimmin' in the ocean at the Isle of Palms," said
Max Isaacs. Then, reverently, he added: "You can go to the Navy
Yard an' see the ships."</p>
<p>He was waiting until he should be old enough to join the navy.
He read the posters greedily. He knew all the navy men at the
enlistment office. He had read all the booklets&mdash;he was deep
in naval lore. He knew to a dollar the earnings of firemen,
second class, of radio men, and of all kinds of C. P. O's.</p>
<p>His father was a plumber. He did not want to be a plumber. He
wanted to join the navy and see the world. In the navy, a man was
given good pay and a good education. He learned a trade. He got
good food and good clothing. It was all given to him free, for
nothing.</p>
<p>"H'm!" said Eliza, with a bantering smile. "Why, say, boy,
what do you want to do that for? You're my baby!"</p>
<p>It had been years since he was. She smiled tremulously.</p>
<p>"Yes'm," said Eugene. "Can I go? It's only for five days. I've
got the money." He thrust his hand into his pocket, feeling.</p>
<p>"I tell you what!" said Eliza, working her lips, smiling. "You
may wish you had that money before this winter's over. You're
going to need new shoes and a warm overcoat when the cold weather
comes. You must be mighty rich. I wish I could afford to go
running off on a trip like that."</p>
<p>"Oh, my God!" said Ben, with a short laugh. He tossed his
cigarette into one of the first fires of the year.</p>
<p>"I want to tell you, son," said Eliza, becoming grave, "you've
got to learn the value of a dollar or you'll never have a roof to
call your own. I want you to have a good time, boy, but you
mustn't squander your money."</p>
<p>"Yes'm," said Eugene.</p>
<p>"For heaven's sake!" Ben cried. "It's the kid's own money. Let
him do what he likes with it. If he wants to throw it out the
damned window, it's his own business."</p>
<p>She clasped her hands thoughtfully upon her waist and stared
away, pursing her lips.</p>
<p>"Well, I reckon it'll be all right," she said. "Mrs. Bowden
will take care of you."</p>
<p>It was his first journey to a strange place alone. Eliza
packed an old valise carefully, and stowed away a box of
sandwiches and eggs. He went away at night. As he stood by his
valise, washed, brushed, excited, she wept a little. He was
again, she felt, a little farther off. The hunger for voyages was
in his face.</p>
<p>"Be a good boy," she said. "Don't get into any trouble down
there." She thought carefully a moment, looking away. Then she
went down in her stocking, and pulled out a five-dollar bill.</p>
<p>"Don't waste your money," she said. "Here's a little extra.
You may need it."</p>
<p>"Come here, you little thug!" said Ben. Scowling, his quick
hands worked busily at the boy's stringy tie. He jerked down his
vest, slipping a wadded ten-dollar bill into Eugene's pocket.
"Behave yourself," he said, "or I'll beat you to death."</p>
<p>Max Isaacs whistled from the street. He went out to join
them.</p>
<p>There were six in Mrs. Bowden's party: Max Isaacs, Malvin
Bowden, Eugene, two girls named Josie and Louise, and Mrs.
Bowden. Josie was Mrs. Bowden's niece and lived with her. She was
a tall beanpole of a girl with a prognathous mouth and stick-out
grinning teeth. She was twenty. The other girl, Louise, was a
waitress. She was small, plump, a warm brunette. Mrs. Bowden was
a little sallow woman with ratty brown hair. She had brown
worn-out eyes. She was a dressmaker. Her husband, a carpenter,
had died in the Spring. There was a little insurance money. That
was how she came to take the trip.</p>
<p>Now, by night, he was riding once more into the South. The
day- coach was hot, full of the weary smell of old red plush.
People dozed painfully, distressed by the mournful tolling of the
bell, and the grinding halts. A baby wailed thinly. Its mother, a
gaunt wisp-haired mountaineer, turned the back of the seat ahead,
and bedded the child on a spread newspaper. Its wizened face
peeked dirtily out of its swaddling discomfort of soiled jackets
and pink ribbon. It wailed and slept. At the front of the car, a
young hill-man, high-boned and red, clad in corduroys and leather
leggings, shelled peanuts steadily, throwing the shells into the
aisle. People trod through them with a sharp masty crackle. The
boys, bored, paraded restlessly to the car-end for water. There
was a crushed litter of sanitary drinking-cups upon the floor,
and a stale odor from the toilets.</p>
<p>The two girls slept soundly on turned seats. The small one
breathed warmly and sweetly through moist parted lips.</p>
<p>The weariness of the night wore in upon their jaded nerves,
lay upon their dry hot eyeballs. They flattened noses against the
dirty windows, and watched the vast structure of the earth sweep
past&mdash;clumped woodlands, the bending sweep of the fields,
the huge flowing lift of the earth-waves, cyclic intersections
bewildering&mdash;the American earth&mdash;rude, immeasurable,
formless, mighty.</p>
<p>His mind was bound in the sad lulling magic of the car wheels.
Clackety-clack. Clackety-clack. Clackety-clack. Clackety-clack.
He thought of his life as something that had happened long ago.
He had found, at last, his gateway to the lost world. But did it
lie before or behind him? Was he leaving or entering it? Above
the rhythm of the wheels he thought of Eliza's laughter over
ancient things. He saw a brief forgotten gesture, her white broad
forehead, a ghost of old grief in her eyes. Ben, Gant&mdash;their
strange lost voices. Their sad laughter. They swam toward him
through green walls of fantasy. They caught and twisted at his
heart. The green ghost-glimmer of their faces coiled away. Lost.
Lost.</p>
<p>"Let's go for a smoke," said Max Isaacs.</p>
<p>They went back and stood wedged for stability on the closed
platform of the car. They lighted cigarettes.</p>
<p>Light broke against the east, in a murky rim. The far dark was
eaten cleanly away. The horizon sky was barred with hard fierce
strips of light. Still buried in night, they looked across at the
unimpinging sheet of day. They looked under the lifted curtain at
brightness. They were knifed sharply away from it. Then, gently,
light melted across the land like dew. The world was gray.</p>
<p>The east broke out in ragged flame. In the car, the little
waitress breathed deeply, sighed, and opened her clear eyes.</p>
<p>Max Isaacs fumbled his cigarette awkwardly, looked at Eugene,
and grinned sheepishly with delight, craning his neck along his
collar, and making a nervous grimace of his white fuzz-haired
face. His hair was thick, straight, the color of taffy. He had
blond eyebrows. There was much kindness in him. They looked at
each other with clumsy tenderness. They thought of the lost years
at Woodson Street. They saw with decent wonder their awkward bulk
of puberty. The proud gate of the years swung open for them. They
felt a lonely glory. They said farewell.</p>
<p>Charleston, fat weed that roots itself on Lethe wharf, lived
in another time. The hours were days, the days weeks.</p>
<p>They arrived in the morning. By noon, several weeks had
passed, and he longed for the day's ending. They were quartered
in a small hotel on King Street&mdash;an old place above stores,
with big rooms. After lunch, they went out to see the town. Max
Isaacs and Malvin Bowden turned at once toward the Navy Yard.
Mrs. Bowden went with them. Eugene was weary for sleep. He
promised to meet them later.</p>
<p>When they had gone, he pulled off his shoes and took off his
coat and shirt, and lay down to sleep in a big dark room, into
which the warm sun fell in shuttered bars. Time droned like a
sleepy October fly.</p>
<p>At five o'clock, Louise, the little waitress, came to wake
him. She, too, had wanted to sleep. She knocked gently at the
door. When he did not answer, she opened it quietly and came in,
closing it behind her. She came to the side of the bed and looked
at him for a moment.</p>
<p>"Eugene!" she whispered. "Eugene."</p>
<p>He murmured drowsily, and stirred. The little waitress smiled
and sat down on the bed. She bent over him and tickled him gently
in the ribs, chuckling to see him squirm. Then she tickled the
soles of his feet. He wakened slowly, yawning, rubbing sleep from
his eyes.</p>
<p>"What is it?" he said.</p>
<p>"It's time to go out there," she said.</p>
<p>"Out where?"</p>
<p>"To the Navy Yard. We promised to meet them."</p>
<p>"Oh, damn the Navy Yard!" he groaned. "I'd rather sleep."</p>
<p>"So would I!" she agreed. She yawned luxuriously, stretching
her plump arms above her head. "I'm so sleepy. I could stretch
out anywhere." She looked meaningly at the bed.</p>
<p>He wakened at once, sensuously alert. He lifted himself upon
one elbow: a hot torrent of blood swarmed through his cheeks. His
pulses beat thickly.</p>
<p>"We're all alone up here," said Louise smiling. "We've got the
whole floor to ourselves."</p>
<p>"Why don't you lie down and take a nap, if you're still
sleepy?" he asked. "I'll wake you up," he added, with gentle
chivalry.</p>
<p>"I've got such a little room. It's hot and stuffy. That's why
I got up," said Louise. "What a nice big room you've got!"</p>
<p>"Yes," he said. "It's a nice big bed, too." They were silent a
waiting moment.</p>
<p>"Why don't you lie down here, Louise?" he said, in a low
unsteady voice. "I'll get up," he added hastily, sitting up.
"I'll wake you."</p>
<p>"Oh, no," she said, "I wouldn't feel right."</p>
<p>They were again silent. She looked admiringly at his thin
young arms.</p>
<p>"My!" she said. "I bet you're strong."</p>
<p>He flexed his long stringy muscles manfully, and expanded his
chest.</p>
<p>"My!" she said. "How old are you, 'Gene?"</p>
<p>He was just at his fifteenth year.</p>
<p>"I'm going on sixteen," he said. "How old are you,
Louise?"</p>
<p>"I'm eighteen," she said. "I bet you're a regular
heart-breaker, 'Gene. How many girls have you got?"</p>
<p>"Oh&mdash;I don't know. Not many," he said truthfully enough.
He wanted to talk&mdash;he wanted to talk madly, seductively,
wickedly. He would excite her by uttering, in grave respectful
tones, honestly, matter-of-factly, the most erotic
suggestions.</p>
<p>"I guess you like the tall ones, don't you?" said Louise. "A
tall fellow wouldn't want a little thing like me, would he?
Although," she said quickly, "you never know. They say opposites
attract each other."</p>
<p>"I don't like tall girls," said Eugene. "They're too skinny. I
like them about your size, when they've got a good build."</p>
<p>"Have I got a good build, 'Gene?" said Louise, holding her
arms up and smiling.</p>
<p>"Yes, you have a pretty build, Louise&mdash;a fine build,"
said Eugene earnestly. "The kind I like."</p>
<p>"I haven't got a pretty face. I've got an ugly face," she said
invitingly.</p>
<p>"You haven't got an ugly face. You have a pretty face," said
Eugene firmly. "Anyway, the face doesn't matter much with me," he
added, subtly.</p>
<p>"What do you like best, 'Gene?" Louise asked.</p>
<p>He thought carefully and gravely.</p>
<p>"Why," he said, "a woman ought to have pretty legs. Sometimes
a woman has an ugly face, but a pretty leg. The prettiest legs I
ever saw were on a High Yellow."</p>
<p>"Were they prettier than mine?" said the waitress, with an
easy laugh.</p>
<p>She crossed her legs slowly and displayed her silk-shod
ankle.</p>
<p>"I don't know, Louise," he said, staring critically. "I can't
see enough."</p>
<p>"Is that enough?" she said, pulling her tight skirt above her
calves.</p>
<p>"No," said Eugene.</p>
<p>"Is that?" she pulled her skirt back over her knees, and
displayed her plump thighs, gartered with a ruffled band of silk
and red rosettes. She thrust her small feet out, coyly turning
the toes in.</p>
<p>"Lord!" said Eugene, staring with keen interest at the garter.
"I never saw any like that before. That's pretty." He gulped
noisily. "Don't those things hurt you, Louise?"</p>
<p>"Uh-uh," she said, as if puzzled, "why?"</p>
<p>"I should think they'd cut into your skin," he said. "I know
mine do if I wear them too tight. See."</p>
<p>He pulled up his trousers' leg and showed his young gartered
shank, lightly spired with hair.</p>
<p>Louise looked, and felt the garter gravely with a plump
hand.</p>
<p>"Mine don't hurt me," she said. She snapped the elastic with a
ripe smack. "See!"</p>
<p>"Let me see," he said. He placed his trembling fingers lightly
upon her garter.</p>
<p>"Yes," he said unsteadily. "I see."</p>
<p>Her round young weight lay heavy against him, her warm young
face turned blindly up to his own. His brain reeled as if
drunken, he dropped his mouth awkwardly upon her parted lips. She
sank back heavily on the pillows. He planted dry and clumsy
kisses upon her mouth, her eyes, in little circles round her
throat and face. He fumbled at the throat-hook of her waist, but
his fingers shook so violently that he could not unfasten it. She
lifted her smooth hands with a comatose gesture, and unfastened
it for him.</p>
<p>Then he lifted his beet-red face, and whispered tremulously,
not knowing well what he said:</p>
<p>"You're a nice girl, Louise. A pretty girl."</p>
<p>She thrust her pink fingers slowly through his hair, drew back
his face into her breasts again, moaned softly as he kissed her,
and clutched his hair in an aching grip. He put his arms around
her and drew her to him. They devoured each other with young wet
kisses, insatiate, unhappy, trying to grow together in their
embrace, draw out the last distillation of desire in a single
kiss.</p>
<p>He lay sprawled, scattered and witless with passion, unable to
collect and focus his heat. He heard the wild tongueless cries of
desire, the inchoate ecstasy that knows no gateway of release.
But he knew fear&mdash;not the social fear, but the fear of
ignorance, of discovery. He feared his potency. He spoke to her
thickly, wildly, not hearing himself speak.</p>
<p>"Do you want me to? Do you want me to, Louise?"</p>
<p>She drew his face down, murmuring:</p>
<p>"You won't hurt me, 'Gene? You wouldn't do anything to hurt
me, honey? If anything happens&mdash;" she said drowsily.</p>
<p>He seized the straw of her suggestion.</p>
<p>"I won't be the first. I won't be the one to begin you. I've
never started a girl off," he babbled, aware vaguely that he was
voicing an approved doctrine of chivalry. "See here, Louise!" he
shook her&mdash;she seemed drugged. "You've got to tell me
before&mdash;. I won't do THAT! I may be a bad fellow, but nobody
can say I ever did that. Do you hear!" His voice rose shrilly;
his face worked wildly; he was hardly able to speak.</p>
<p>"I say, do you hear? Am I the first one, or not? You've got to
answer! Did you ever&mdash;before?"</p>
<p>She looked at him lazily. She smiled.</p>
<p>"No," she said.</p>
<p>"I may be mad, but I won't do that." He had become
inarticulate; his voice went off into a speechless jargon.
Gasping, stammering, with contorted and writhing face, he sought
for speech.</p>
<p>She rose suddenly, and put her warm arms comfortingly around
him. Soothing and caressing him, she drew him down on her breast.
She stroked his head, and talked quietly to him.</p>
<p>"I know you wouldn't, honey. I know you wouldn't. Don't talk.
Don't say anything. Why, you're all excited, dear. There. Why,
you're shaking like a leaf. You're high-strung, honey. That's
what it is. You're a bundle of nerves."</p>
<p>He wept soundlessly into her arm.</p>
<p>He became quieter. She smiled, and kissed him softly.</p>
<p>"Put on your clothes," said Louise. "We ought to get started
if we're going out there."</p>
<p>In his confusion he tried to draw on a pair of Mrs. Bowden's
cast- off pumps. Louise laughed richly, and thrust her fingers
through his hair.</p>
<p>At the Navy Yard, they could not find the Bowdens nor Max
Isaacs. A young sailor took them over a destroyer. Louise went up
a railed iron ladder with an emphatic rhythm of her shapely
thighs. She showed her legs. She stared impudently at a picture
of a chorus lady, cut from the Police Gazette. The young sailor
rolled his eyes aloft with an expression of innocent debauchery.
Then he winked heavily at Eugene.</p>
<p>The deck of the Oregon.</p>
<p>"What's that for?" said Louise, pointing to the outline in
nails of Admiral Dewey's foot.</p>
<p>"That's where he stood during the fight," said the sailor.</p>
<p>Louise put her small foot within the print of the greater one.
The sailor winked at Eugene. You may fire when you are ready,
Gridley.</p>
<p>"She's a nice girl," said Eugene.</p>
<p>"Yeah," said Max Isaacs. "She's a nice lady." He craned his
neck awkwardly, and squinted. "About how old is she?"</p>
<p>"She's eighteen," said Eugene.</p>
<p>Malvin Bowden stared at him.</p>
<p>"You're crazy!" said he. "She's twenty-one."</p>
<p>"No," said Eugene, "she's eighteen. She told me so."</p>
<p>"I don't care," said Malvin Bowden, "she's no such thing.
She's twenty-one. I reckon I ought to know. My folks have known
her for five years. She had a baby when she was eighteen."</p>
<p>"Aw!" said Max Isaacs.</p>
<p>"Yes," said Malvin Bowden, "a travelling man got her in
trouble. Then he ran away."</p>
<p>"Aw!" said Max Isaacs. "Without marryin' her or anything?"</p>
<p>"He didn't do nothing for her. He ran away," said Malvin
Bowden. "Her people are raising the kid now."</p>
<p>"Great Day!" said Max Isaacs slowly. Then, sternly, he added,
"A man who'd do a thing like that ought to be shot."</p>
<p>"You're right!" said Malvin Bowden.</p>
<p>They loafed along the Battery, along the borders of ruined
Camelot.</p>
<p>"Those are nice old places," said Max Isaacs. "They've been
good houses in their day."</p>
<p>He looked greedily at wrought-iron gateways; the old lust of
his childhood for iron-scraps awoke.</p>
<p>"Those are old Southern mansions," said Eugene,
reverently.</p>
<p>The bay was still: there was a green stench of warm standing
water.</p>
<p>"They've let the place run down," said Malvin. "It's no bigger
now than it was before the Civil War."</p>
<p>No, sir, and, by heaven, so long as one true Southern heart is
left alive to remember Appomattox, Reconstruction, and the Black
parliaments, we will defend with our dearest blood our menaced,
but sacred, traditions.</p>
<p>"They need some Northern capital," said Max Isaacs sagely.
They all did.</p>
<p>An old woman, wearing a tiny bonnet, was led out on a high
veranda from one of the houses, by an attentive negress. She
seated herself in a porch rocker and stared blindly into the sun.
Eugene looked at her sympathetically. She had probably not been
informed by her loyal children of the unsuccessful termination of
the war. United in their brave deception, they stinted themselves
daily, reining in on their proud stomachs in order that she might
have all the luxury to which she had been accustomed. What did
she eat? The wing of a chicken, no doubt, and a glass of dry
sherry. Meanwhile, all the valuable heirlooms had been pawned or
sold. Fortunately, she was almost blind, and could not see the
wastage of their fortune. It was very sad. But did she not
sometimes think of that old time of the wine and the roses? When
knighthood was in flower?</p>
<p>"Look at that old lady," whispered Malvin Bowden.</p>
<p>"You can TELL she's a lady," said Max Isaacs. "I bet she's
never turned her hand over."</p>
<p>"An old family," said Eugene gently. "The Southern
aristocracy."</p>
<p>An old negro came by, fringed benevolently by white whiskers.
A good old man&mdash;an ante-bellum darkey. Dear Lord, their
number was few in these unhappy days.</p>
<p>Eugene thought of the beautiful institution of human slavery,
which his slaveless maternal ancestry had fought so valiantly to
preserve. Bress de Lawd, Marse! Ole Mose doan' wan' to be free
niggah. How he goan' lib widout marse? He doan' wan' stahve wid
free niggahs. Har, har, har!</p>
<p>Philanthropy. Pure philanthropy. He brushed a tear from his
een.</p>
<p>They were going across the harbor to the Isle of Palms. As the
boat churned past the round brick cylinder of Fort Sumter, Malvin
Bowden said:</p>
<p>"They had the most men. If things had been even, we'd have
beaten them."</p>
<p>"They didn't beat us," said Max Isaacs. "We wore ourselves out
beating them."</p>
<p>"We were defeated," said Eugene, quietly, "not beaten."</p>
<p>Max Isaacs stared at him dumbly.</p>
<p>"Aw!" he said.</p>
<p>They left the little boat, and ground away toward the beach in
a street-car. The land had grown dry and yellow in the enervation
of the summer. The foliage was coated with dust: they rattled
past cheap summer houses, baked and blistered, stogged drearily
in the sand. They were small, flimsy, a multitudinous
vermin&mdash;all with their little wooden sign of lodging. "The
Ishkabibble," "Seaview," "Rest Haven," "Atlantic
Inn,"&mdash;Eugene looked at them, reading with weariness the
bleached and jaded humor of their names.</p>
<p>"There are a lot of boarding-houses in the world," said
he.</p>
<p>A hot wind of beginning autumn rustled dryly through the long
parched leaves of stunted palms. Before them rose the huge rusted
spokes of a Ferris Wheel. St. Louis. They had reached the
beach.</p>
<p>Malvin Bowden leaped joyously from the car.</p>
<p>"Last one in's a rotten egg!" he cried, and streaked for the
bathhouse.</p>
<p>"Kings! I've got kings, son," yelled Max Isaacs. He held up
his crossed fingers. The beach was bare: two or three concessions
stood idly open for business. The sky curved over them, a
cloudless blue burnished bowl. The sea offshore was glazed
emerald: the waves rode heavily in, thickening murkily as they
turned with sunlight and sediment to a beachy yellow.</p>
<p>They walked slowly down the beach toward the bathhouse. The
tranquil, incessant thunder of the sea made in them a lonely
music. Seawards, their eyes probed through the seething
glare.</p>
<p>"I'm going to join the navy, 'Gene," said Max Isaacs. "Come on
and go with me."</p>
<p>"I'm not old enough," said Eugene. "You're not, either."</p>
<p>"I'll be sixteen in November," said Max Isaacs
defensively.</p>
<p>'That's not old enough."</p>
<p>"I'm going to lie to get in," said Max Isaacs. "They won't
bother you. You can get in. Come on."</p>
<p>"No," said Eugene. "I can't."</p>
<p>"Why not?" said Max Isaacs. "What are you going to do?"</p>
<p>"I'm going to college," said Eugene. "I'm going to get an
education and study law."</p>
<p>"You'll have lots of time," said Max Isaacs. "You can go to
college when you come out. They teach you a lot in the navy. They
give you a good training. You go everywhere."</p>
<p>"No," said Eugene. "I can't."</p>
<p>But his pulse throbbed as he listened to the lonely thunder of
the sea. He saw strange dusky faces, palm frondage, and heard the
little tinkling sounds of Asia. He believed in harbors at the
end.</p>
<p>Mrs. Bowden's niece and the waitress came out on the next car.
After his immersion he lay, trembling slightly under the gusty
wind, upon the beach. A fine tang of salt was on his lips. He
licked his clean young flesh.</p>
<p>Louise came from the bathhouse and walked slowly toward him.
She came proudly, her warm curves moulded into her bathing-suit:
her legs were covered with stockings of green silk.</p>
<p>Far out, beyond the ropes, Max Isaacs lifted his white heavy
arms, and slid swiftly through a surging wall of green water. His
body glimmered greenly for a moment; he stood erect wiping his
eyes and shaking water from his ears.</p>
<p>Eugene took the waitress by the hand and led her into the
water. She advanced slowly, with little twittering cries. An
undulant surge rolled in deceptively, and rose suddenly to her
chin, drinking her breath. She gasped and clung to him.
Initiated, they bucked deliciously through a roaring wall of
water, and, while her eyes were still closed, he caught her to
him with young salty kisses.</p>
<p>Presently they came out, and walked over the wet strip of
beach into the warm loose sand, bedding their dripping bodies
gratefully in its warmth. The waitress shivered: he moulded sand
over her legs and hips, until she was half buried. He kissed her,
stilling his trembling lips upon her mouth.</p>
<p>"I like you! I like you a lot!" he said.</p>
<p>"What did they tell you about me?" she said. "Did they talk
about me?"</p>
<p>"I don't care," he said. "I don't care about that. I like
you."</p>
<p>"You won't remember me, honey, when you start going with the
girls. You'll forget about me. Some day you'll see me, and you
won't even know me. You won't recognize me. You'll pass without
speaking."</p>
<p>"No," he said. "I'll never forget you, Louise. So long as I
live."</p>
<p>Their hearts were filled with the lonely thunder of the sea.
She kissed him. They were hill-born.</p>
<p>He returned in late September.</p>
<p>In October, Gant, with Ben and Helen, departed for Baltimore.
The operation, too long deferred, was now inevitable. His disease
had grown steadily worse. He had gone through a period of
incessant pain. He was enfeebled. He was frightened.</p>
<p>Rising at night, he would rouse the sleeping house with his
cries, commanding terror with his old magnificence.</p>
<p>"I see it! I see it! The knife! The knife!...Do you see its
shadow?...There! There! There!"</p>
<p>With Boothian gusto he recoiled, pointing to invulnerable
nothings.</p>
<p>"Do you see him standing there in the shadows? So you've come
at last to take the old man with you?...There he stands&mdash;the
Grim Reaper&mdash;as I always knew he would. Jesus, have mercy on
my soul!"</p>
<p>Gant lay in a long cot in the Urological Institute at Johns
Hopkins. Every day a cheerful little man came briskly in and
looked at his chart. He talked happily and went away. He was one
of the greatest surgeons in the country.</p>
<p>"Don't worry," said the nurse encouragingly, "the mortality's
only four per cent. It used to be thirty. He's reduced it."</p>
<p>Gant groaned, and slipped his big hand into his daughter's
vital grasp.</p>
<p>"Don't worry, old boy!" she said, "you're going to be as good
as you ever were, after this."</p>
<p>She fed him with her life, her hope, her love. He was almost
tranquil when they wheeled him in to his operation.</p>
<p>But the little gray-haired man looked, shook his head
regretfully, and trimmed deftly.</p>
<p>"All right!" he said, four minutes later, to his assistant.
"Close the wound."</p>
<p>Gant was dying of cancer.</p>
<p>Gant sat in a wheeled chair upon the high fifth-floor veranda,
looking out through bright October air at the city spread far
into the haze before him. He looked very clean, almost fragile. A
faint grin of happiness and relief hovered about his thin mouth.
He smoked a long cigar, with fresh-awakened senses.</p>
<p>"There," he said pointing, "is where I spent part of my
boyhood. Old Jeff Streeter's hotel stood about there," he
pointed.</p>
<p>"Dig down!" said Helen, grinning.</p>
<p>Gant thought of the years between, and the vexed pattern of
fate. His life seemed strange to him.</p>
<p>"We'll go to see all those places when you get out of here.
They're going to let you out of here, day after to-morrow. Did
you know that? Did you know you're almost well?" she cried with a
big smile.</p>
<p>"I'm going to be a well man after this," said Gant. "I feel
twenty years younger!"</p>
<p>"Poor old papa!" she said. "Poor old papa!"</p>
<p>Her eyes were wet. She put her big hands on his face, and drew
his head against her.</p>
<h3>27</h3>
<p>My Shakespeare, rise! He rose. The bard rose throughout the
length and breadth of his brave new world. He was not for an age,
but for all time. Then, too, his tercentenary happened only
once&mdash;at the end of three hundred years. It was observed
piously from Maryland to Oregon. Eighty-one members of the House
of Representatives, when asked by literate journalists for their
favorite lines, replied instantly with a quotation from Polonius:
"This above all: to thine own self be true." The Swan was played,
and pageanted, and essayed in every schoolhouse in the land.</p>
<p>Eugene tore the Chandos portrait from the pages of the
Independent and nailed it to the calcimined wall of the backroom.
Then, still full of the great echoing paean of Ben Jonson's, he
scrawled below it in large trembling letters: "My Shakespeare,
rise!" The large plump face&mdash;"as damned silly a head as ever
I looked at"&mdash;stared baldly at him with goggle eyes, the
goatee pointed ripe with hayseed vanity. But, lit by the
presence, Eugene plunged back into the essay littered across his
table.</p>
<p>He was discovered. In an unwise absence, he left the Bard upon
the wall. When he returned, Ben and Helen had read his scrawl.
Thereafter, he was called poetically to table, to the telephone,
to go an errand.</p>
<p>"My Shakespeare, rise!"</p>
<p>With red resentful face, he rose.</p>
<p>"Will My Shakespeare pass the biscuit?" or, "Could I trouble
My Shakespeare for the butter?" said Ben, scowling at him.</p>
<p>"My Shakespeare! My Shakespeare! Do you want another piece of
pie?" said Helen. Then, full of penitent laughter, she added:
"That's a shame! We oughtn't to treat the poor kid like that."
Laughing, she plucked at her large straight chin, gazing out the
window, and laughing absently&mdash;penitently, laughing.</p>
<p>But&mdash;"his art was universal. He saw life clearly and he
saw it whole. He was an intellectual ocean whose waves touched
every shore of thought. He was all things in one: lawyer,
merchant, soldier, doctor, statesman. Men of science have been
amazed by the depth of his learning. In The Merchant of Venice,
he deals with the most technical questions of law with the skill
of an attorney. In King Lear, he boldly prescribes sleep as a
remedy for Lear's insanity. 'Sleep that knits up the ravell'd
sleave of care.' Thus, he has foreseen the latest researches of
modern science by almost three centuries. In his sympathetic and
well-rounded sense of characterization, he laughs with, not at,
his characters."</p>
<p>Eugene won the medal&mdash;bronze or of some other material
even more enduring. The Bard's profile murkily indented. W. S.
1616-1916. A long and useful life.</p>
<p>The machinery of the pageant was beautiful and simple. Its
author&mdash;Dr. George B. Rockham, at one time, it was
whispered, a trouper with the Ben Greet players&mdash;had seen to
that. All the words had been written by Dr. George B. Rockham,
and all the words, accordingly, had been written for Dr. George
B. Rockham. Dr. George B. Rockham was the Voice of History. The
innocent children of Altamont's schools were the mute
illustrations of that voice.</p>
<p>Eugene was Prince Hal. The day before the pageant his costume
arrived from Philadelphia. At John Dorsey Leonard's direction he
put it on. Then he came out sheepishly before John Dorsey on the
school veranda, fingering his tin sword and looking somewhat
doubtfully at his pink silk hose which came three quarters up his
skinny shanks, and left exposed, below his doublet, a six-inch
hiatus of raw thigh.</p>
<p>John Dorsey Leonard looked gravely.</p>
<p>"Here, boy," he said. "Let me see!"</p>
<p>He pulled strongly at the top of the deficient hose, with no
result save to open up large runs in them. Then John Dorsey
Leonard began to laugh. He slid helplessly down upon the porch
rail, and bent over, palsied with silent laughter, from which a
high whine, full of spittle, presently emerged.</p>
<p>"O-oh my Lord!" he gasped. "Egscuse me!" he panted, seeing the
boy's angry face. "It's the funniest thing I ever&mdash;" at this
moment his voice died of paralysis.</p>
<p>"I'll fix you," said Miss Amy. "I've got just the thing for
you."</p>
<p>She gave him a full baggy clown's suit, of green linen. It was
a relic of a Hallowe'en party; its wide folds were gartered about
his ankles.</p>
<p>He turned a distressed, puzzled face toward Miss Amy.</p>
<p>"That's not right, is it?" he asked. "He never wore anything
like this, did he?"</p>
<p>Miss Amy looked. Her deep bosom heaved with full contralto
laughter.</p>
<p>"Yes, that's right! That's fine!" she yelled. "He was like
that, anyway. No one will ever notice, boy." She collapsed
heavily into a wicker chair which widened with a protesting
creak.</p>
<p>"Oh, Lord!" she groaned, wet-cheeked. "I don't believe I ever
saw&mdash;"</p>
<p>The pageant was performed on the embowered lawns of the Manor
House. Dr. George B. Rockham stood in a green hollow&mdash;a
natural amphitheatre. His audience sat on the turf of the
encircling banks. As the phantom cavalcade of poetry and the
drama wound down to him, Dr. George B. Rockham disposed of each
character neatly in descriptive pentameter verse. He was dressed
in the fashion of the Restoration&mdash;a period he coveted
because it understood the charms of muscular calves. His heavy
legs bulged knottily below a coy fringe of drawer-ruffles.</p>
<p>Eugene stood waiting on the road above, behind an obscuring
wall of trees. It was rich young May. "Doc" Hines (Falstaff)
waited beside him. His small tough face grinned apishly over
garments stuffed with yards of wadding. Grinning, he smote
himself upon his swollen paunch: the blow left a dropsical
depression.</p>
<p>He turned, with a comical squint, on Eugene:</p>
<p>"Hal," said he, "you're a hell of a looking prince."</p>
<p>"You're no beauty, Jack," said Eugene.</p>
<p>Behind him, Julius Arthur (Macbeth), drew his sword with a
flourish.</p>
<p>"I challenge you, Hal," said he.</p>
<p>In the young shimmering light their tin swords clashed
rapidly. Twittered with young bird-laughter, on bank and saddle
sprawled, all of the Bard's person&aelig;. Julius Arthur thrust
swiftly, was warded, then, with loose grin, buried his brand
suddenly in "Doc" Hines' receiving paunch. The company of the
immortal shrieked happily.</p>
<p>Miss Ida Nelson, the assistant director, rushed angrily among
them.</p>
<p>"Sh!" she hissed loudly. "Sh-h!" She was very angry. She had
spent the afternoon hissing loudly.</p>
<p>Swinging gently in her side-saddle, Rosalind, on horseback, a
ripe little beauty from the convent, smiled warmly at him.
Looking, he forgot.</p>
<p>Below them, on the road, the crowded press loosened slowly,
broke off in minute fragments, and disappeared into the hidden
gulch of Dr. George Rockham's receiving voice. With fat hammy
sonority he welcomed them.</p>
<p>But he had not come to Shakespeare. The pageant had opened
with the Voices of Past and Present&mdash;voices a trifle out of
harmony with the tenor of event&mdash;but necessary to the
commercial success of the enterprise. These voices now moved
voicelessly past&mdash;four frightened sales-ladies from
Schwartzberg's, clad decently in cheese-cloth and sandals, who
came by bearing the banner of their concern. Or, as the doctor's
more eloquent iambics had it:</p>
<blockquote>"Fair Commerce, sister of the arts, thou, too,<br>
Shalt take thy lawful place upon our stage."</blockquote>
<p>They came and passed: Ginsberg's&mdash;"the glass of fashion
and the mould of form"; Bradley the Grocer&mdash;"when first
Pomona held her fruity horn"; The Buick Agency&mdash;"the
chariots of Oxus and of Ind."</p>
<p>Came, passed&mdash;like pageantry of mist on an autumnal
stream.</p>
<p>Behind them, serried ranks of cherubim, the marshalled legions
of Altamont's Sunday schools, each in white arrayed and clutching
grimly in tiny hands two thousand tiny flags of freedom, God's
small angels, and surely there for God knows what far-off event,
began to move into the hollow. Their teachers nursed them gently
into action, with tapping feet and palms.</p>
<p>"One, two, THREE, four. One, two, THREE, four. Quickly,
children!"</p>
<p>A hidden orchestra, musical in the trees, greeted them, as
they approached, with holy strains: the Baptists, with the simple
doctrine of "It's the Old-time Religion"; the Methodists, with
"I'll Be Waiting at the River"; the Presbyterians, with "Rock of
Ages," the Episcopalians, with "Jesus, Lover of My Soul"; and
rising to lyrical climactic passion, the little Jews, with the
nobly marching music of "Onward, Christian Soldiers."</p>
<p>They passed without laughter. There was a pause.</p>
<p>"Well, thank God for that!" said Ralph Rolls coarsely in a
solemn quiet. The Bard's strewn host laughed, rustled noisily
into line.</p>
<p>"Sh-h! Sh-h!" hissed Miss Ida Nelson.</p>
<p>"What the hell does she think she is?" said Julius Arthur, "a
steam valve?"</p>
<p>Eugene looked attentively at the shapely legs of the page,
Viola.</p>
<p>"Wow!" said Ralph Rolls, with his accustomed audibility. "Look
who's here!"</p>
<p>She looked on them all with a pert impartial smile. But she
never told her love.</p>
<p>Miss Ida Nelson caught the doctor's stealthy sign. Carefully,
in slow twos, she fed them down to him.</p>
<p>The Moor of Venice (Mr. George Graves), turned his broad back
upon their jibes, and lurched down with sullen-sheepish grin,
unable to conceal the massive embarrassment of his calves.</p>
<p>"Tell him who you are, Villa," said Doc Hines. "You look like
Jack Johnson."</p>
<p>The town, in its first white shirting of Spring, sat on the
turfy banks, and looked down gravely upon the bosky little comedy
of errors; the encircling mountains, and the gods thereon, looked
down upon the slightly larger theatre of the town; and,
figuratively, from mountains that looked down on mountains, the
last stronghold of philosophy, the author of this chronicle
looked down on everything.</p>
<p>"Here we go, Hal," said Doc Hines, nudging Eugene.</p>
<p>"Give 'em hell, son," said Julius Arthur. "You're dressed for
the part."</p>
<p>"He looks it, you mean," said Ralph Rolls. "Boy, you'll knock
'em dead," he added with an indecent laugh.</p>
<p>They descended into the hollow, accompanied by a low but
growing titter of amazement from the audience. Before them, the
doctor had just disposed of Desdemona, who parted with a graceful
obeisance. He was now engaged on Othello, who stood, bullish and
shy, till his ordeal should finish. In a moment, he strode away,
and the doctor turned to Falstaff, reading the man by his padded
belly, briskly, with relief:</p>
<blockquote>"Now, Tragedy, begone, and to our dell<br>
Bring antic Jollity with cap and bells:<br>
Falstaff, thou prince of jesters, lewd old man<br>
Who surfeited a royal prince with mirth,<br>
And swayed a kingdom with his wanton quips&mdash;"</blockquote>
<p>Embarrassed by the growing undertone of laughter, Doc Hines
squinted around with a tough grin, gave a comical hitch to his
padded figure, and whispered a hoarse aside to Eugene: "Hear
that, Hal? I'm hell on wheels, ain't I?"</p>
<p>Eugene saw him depart in a green blur, and presently became
aware that an unnatural silence had descended upon Doctor George
B. Rockham. The Voice of History was, for the moment, mute. Its
long jaw, in fact, had fallen ajar.</p>
<p>Dr. George B. Rockham looked wildly about him for succor. He
rolled his eyes entreatingly upwards at Miss Ida Nelson. She
turned her head away.</p>
<p>"Who are you?" he said hoarsely, holding a hairy hand
carefully beside his mouth.</p>
<p>"Prince Hal," said Eugene, likewise hoarsely and behind his
hand.</p>
<p>Dr. George B. Rockham staggered a little. Their speech had
reached the stalls. But firmly, before the tethered chafing
laughter, he began:</p>
<blockquote>"Friend to the weak and comrade of the wild,<br>
By folly sired to wisdom, dauntless Hal&mdash;"</blockquote>
<p>Laughter, laughter unleashed and turbulent, laughter that rose
flood by flood upon itself, laughter wild, earth-shaking,
thunder- cuffing, drowned Dr. George B. Rockham and all he had to
say. Laughter! Laughter! Laughter!</p>
<p>Helen was married in the month of June&mdash;a month sacred,
it is said, to Hymen, but used so often for nuptials that the
god's blessing is probably not infallible.</p>
<p>She had returned to Altamont in May, from her last singing
engagement. She had been in Atlanta for the week of opera, and
had come back by way of Henderson, where she had visited Daisy
and Mrs. Selborne. There she had found her mate.</p>
<p>He was not a stranger to her. She had known him years before
in Altamont, where he had lived for a short time as district
agent for the great and humane corporation that employed
him&mdash;the Federal Cash Register Company. Since that time he
had gone to various parts of the country at his master's bidding,
carrying with him his great message of prosperity and thrift. At
the present time, he lived with his sister and his aged mother,
whose ponderous infirmity of limb had not impaired her appetite,
in a South Carolina town. He was devoted and generous to them
both. And the Federal Cash Register Company, touched by his
devotion to duty, rewarded him with a good salary. His name was
Barton. The Bartons lived well.</p>
<p>Helen returned with the unexpectedness in which all returning
Gants delighted. She came in on members of her family, one
afternoon, in the kitchen at Dixieland.</p>
<p>"Hello, everybody!" she said.</p>
<p>"Well, for G-g-god's sake," said Luke after a moment. "Look
who's here!"</p>
<p>They embraced heartily,</p>
<p>"Why, what on earth!" cried Eliza, putting her iron down on
the board, and wavering on her feet, in an effort to walk in two
directions at once. They kissed.</p>
<p>"I was just thinking to myself," said Eliza, more calmly,
"that it wouldn't surprise me a bit if you should come walking
in. I had a premonition, I don't know what else you'd call
it&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Oh, my God!" groaned the girl, good-humoredly, but with a
shade of annoyance. "Don't start that Pentland spooky stuff! It
makes my flesh crawl."</p>
<p>She exchanged a glance of burlesque entreaty with Luke.
Winking, he turned suddenly, and with an idiotic laugh, tickled
Eliza sharply.</p>
<p>"Get away!" she shrieked.</p>
<p>He chortled madly.</p>
<p>"I'll declare, boy!" she said fretfully. "I believe you're
crazy. I'll vow I do!"</p>
<p>Helen laughed huskily.</p>
<p>"Well," said Eliza, "how'd you leave Daisy and the
children?"</p>
<p>"They're all right, I suppose," said Helen wearily. "Oh, my
God! Deliver me!" she laughed. "You never saw such pests! I spent
fifty dollars on them in toys and presents alone! You'd never
think it from the thanks I get. Daisy takes it all as her due!
Selfish! Selfish! Selfish!"</p>
<p>"For G-g-god's sake!" said Luke loyally.</p>
<p>She was one fine girl.</p>
<p>"I paid for everything I got at Daisy's, I can assure you!"
she said, sharply, challengingly. "I spent no more time there
than I had to. I was at Mrs. Selborne's nearly all the time. I
had practically all my meals there."</p>
<p>Her need for independence had become greater; her hunger for
dependents acute. Her denial of obligation to others was
militant. She gave more than she received.</p>
<p>"Well, I'm in for it," she said presently, trying to mask her
strong eagerness.</p>
<p>"In for what?" asked Luke.</p>
<p>"I've gone and done it at last," she said.</p>
<p>"Mercy!" shrieked Eliza. "You're not married, are you?"</p>
<p>"Not yet," said Helen, "but I will be soon."</p>
<p>Then she told them about Mr. Hugh T. Barton, the cash register
salesman. She spoke loyally and kindly of him, without great
love.</p>
<p>"He's ten years older than I am," she said.</p>
<p>"Well," said Eliza thoughtfully, moulding her lips. "They
sometimes make the best husbands." After a moment, she asked:
"Has he got any property?"</p>
<p>"No," said Helen, "they live up all he makes. They live in
style, I tell you. There are two servants in that house all the
time. The old lady doesn't turn her hand over."</p>
<p>"Where are you going to live?" said Eliza sharply. "With his
folks?"</p>
<p>"Well, I should say not! I should say not!" said Helen slowly
and emphatically. "Good heavens, mama!" she continued irritably.
"I want a home of my own. Can't you realize that? I've been doing
for others all my life. Now I'm going to let them do for me. I
want no in-laws about. No, sir!" she said emphatically.</p>
<p>Luke bit his nails nervously.</p>
<p>"Well, he's g-g-getting a great g-g-girl," he said. "I hope he
has sense enough to realize that."</p>
<p>Moved, she laughed bigly, ironically.</p>
<p>"I've got one booster, haven't I?" she said. She looked at him
seriously with clear affectionate eyes. "Well, thanks, Luke.
You're one of the lot that's always had the interests of the
family at heart."</p>
<p>Her big face was for a moment tranquil and eager. A great calm
lay there: the radiant decent beauty of dawn and rainwater. Her
eyes were as luminous and believing as a child's. No evil dwelt
in her. She had learned nothing.</p>
<p>"Have you told your papa?" said Eliza, presently.</p>
<p>"No," she said, after a pause, "I haven't."</p>
<p>They thought of Gant in silence, with wonder. Her going was a
marvel.</p>
<p>"I have a right to my own life," said Helen angrily, as if
some one disputed that right, "as much as any one. Good heavens,
mama! You and papa have lived your lives&mdash;don't you know
that? Do you think it's right that I should go on forever looking
after him? Do you?" Her voice rose under the stress of
hysteria.</p>
<p>"Why, no-o. I never said&mdash;" Eliza began, flustered and
conciliatory.</p>
<p>"You've spent your life f-f-finking of others and not of
yourself," said Luke. "That's the trouble. They don't appreciate
it."</p>
<p>"Well, I'm not going to any longer. That's one thing sure! No,
indeed! I want a home and some children. I'm going to have them!"
she said defiantly. In a moment, she added tenderly:</p>
<p>"Poor old papa! I wonder what he's going to say?"</p>
<p>He said very little. The Gants, after initial surprise,
moulded new events very quickly into the texture of their lives.
Abysmal change widened their souls out in a brooding
unconsciousness.</p>
<p>Mr. Hugh Barton came up into the hills to visit his affianced
kin. He came, to their huge delight, lounging in the long racing
chassis of a dusty brown 1911 Buick roadster. He came, in a
gaseous coil, to the roaring explosion of great engines. He
descended, a tall, elegant figure, dyspeptic, lean almost to
emaciation, very foppishly laundered and tailored. He looked the
car over slowly, critically, a long cigar clamped in the corner
of his saturnine mouth, drawing his gauntlets off deliberately.
Then, in the same unhurried fashion, he removed from his head the
ten-gallon gray sombrero&mdash;the only astonishing feature of
his otherwise undebatable costume&mdash;and shook each long thin
leg delicately for a moment to straighten out the wrinkles. But
there were none. Then, deliberately, he came up the walk to
Dixieland, where the Gants were assembled. As he came, unhurried,
he took the cigar from his mouth calmly and held it in the
fingers of his lean, hairy, violently palsied hand. His thin
black hair, fine spun, was fanned lightly from its elegance by a
wantoning breeze. He espied his betrothed and grinned, with
dignity, sardonically, with big nuggets of gold teeth. They
greeted and kissed.</p>
<p>"This is my mother, Hugh," said Helen.</p>
<p>Hugh Barton bent slowly, courteously, from his thin waist. He
fastened on Eliza a keen penetrating stare that discomposed her.
His lips twisted again in an impressive sardonic smile. Every one
felt he was going to say something very, very important.</p>
<p>"How do you do?" he asked, and took her hand.</p>
<p>Every one then felt that Hugh Barton had said something very,
very important.</p>
<p>With equal slow gravity he greeted each one. They were
somewhat awed by his lordliness. Luke, however, burst out
uncontrollably:</p>
<p>"You're g-g-getting a fine girl, Mr. B-b-barton."</p>
<p>Hugh Barton turned on him slowly and fixed him with his keen
stare.</p>
<p>"I think so," he said gravely. His voice was deep, deliberate,
with an impressive rasp. He was selling himself.</p>
<p>In an awkward silence he turned, grinning amiably, on
Eugene.</p>
<p>"Have a cigar?" he asked, taking three long powerful weeds
from his upper vest pocket, and holding them out in his clean
twitching fingers.</p>
<p>"Thanks," said Eugene with a dissipated leer, "I'll smoke a
Camel."</p>
<p>He took a package of cigarettes from his pocket. Gravely, Hugh
Barton held a match for him.</p>
<p>"Why do you wear the big hat?" asked Eugene.</p>
<p>"Psychology," he said. "It makes 'em talk."</p>
<p>"I tell you what!" said Eliza, beginning to laugh. "That's
pretty smart, isn't it?"</p>
<p>"Sure!" said Luke. "That's advertising! It pays to
advertise!"</p>
<p>"Yes," said Mr. Barton slowly, "you've got to get the other
fellow's psychology."</p>
<p>The phrase seemed to describe an action of modified assault
and restrained pillage.</p>
<p>They liked him very much. They all went into the house.</p>
<p>Hugh Barton's mother was in her seventy-fourth year, but she
had the strength of a healthy woman of fifty, and the appetite of
two of forty. She was a powerful old lady, six feet tall, with
the big bones of a man, and a heavy full-jawed face, sensuous and
complacent, and excellently equipped with a champing mill of
strong yellow horse-teeth. It was cake and pudding to see her at
work on corn on the cob. A slight paralysis had slowed her tongue
and thickened her speech a little, so that she spoke
deliberately, with a ponderous enunciation of each word. This
deformity, which she carefully hid, added to, rather than
subtracted from, the pontifical weight of her opinions: she was
an earnest Republican&mdash;in memory of her departed
mate&mdash;and she took a violent dislike to any one who opposed
her political judgment. When thwarted or annoyed in any way, the
heavy benevolence of her face was dislodged by a thunder-cloud of
petulance, and her wide pouting underlip rolled out like a
window-shade. But, as she barged slowly along, one big hand
gripping a heavy stick on which she leaned her massive weight,
she was an impressive dowager.</p>
<p>"She's a lady&mdash;a real lady," said Helen proudly. "Any one
can see that! She goes out with all the best people."</p>
<p>Hugh Barton's sister, Mrs. Genevieve Watson, was a sallow
woman of thirty-eight years, tall, wren-like and emaciated, like
her brother; dyspeptic, and very elegantly kept. The divorced
Watson was conspicuous for his absence from all conversations:
there was once or twice a heavy flutter around his name, a
funereal hush, and a muttered suggestion of oriental
debauchery.</p>
<p>"He was a beast," said Hugh Barton, "a low dog. He treated
sister very badly."</p>
<p>Mrs. Barton wagged her great head with the slow but emphatic
approval she accorded all her son's opinions.</p>
<p>"O-o-h!" she said. "He was a ter-rib-bul man."</p>
<p>He had, they inferred, been given to hellish practices. He had
"gone after other women."</p>
<p>Sister Veve had a narrow discontented face, a metallic
vivacity, an effusive cordiality. She was always very smartly
dressed. She had somewhat vague connections in the real estate
business; she spoke grandly of obscure affairs; she was always on
the verge of an indefinite "Big Deal."</p>
<p>"I'm getting them lined up, brother," she would say with
cheerful confidence. "Things are coming my way. J. D. came in
to-day and said: 'Veve&mdash;you're the only woman in the world
that can put this thing across. Go to it, little girl. There's a
fortune in it for you.'" And so on.</p>
<p>Her conversation, Eugene thought, was not unlike Brother
Steve's.</p>
<p>But their affection and loyalty for one another was beautiful.
Its unaccustomed faith, its abiding tranquillity, puzzled and
disturbed the Gants. They were touched indefinably, a little
annoyed, because of it.</p>
<p>The Bartons came to Woodson Street two weeks before the
wedding. Within three days after their arrival, Helen and old
lady Barton were at odds. It was inevitable. The heat of the
girl's first affection for Barton's family wore off very quickly:
her possessive instinct asserted itself&mdash;she would halve no
one's love, she would share with no other a place in the heart.
She would own, she would possess completely. She would be
generous, but she would be mistress. She would give. It was the
law of her nature.</p>
<p>She began immediately, by force of this essential stress, to
make out a case against the old woman.</p>
<p>Mrs. Barton, too, felt the extent of her loss. She wanted to
be sure that Helen realized the extent of her acquisition of one
of the latter-day saints.</p>
<p>Rocking ponderously in the dark on Gant's veranda, the old
woman would say:</p>
<p>"You are get-ting a good boy, Hel-en." She would wag her
powerful head from side to side, pugnaciously emphatic. "Though I
do say it myself, you are get-ting one good boy, Hel-en. A
bet-ter boy than Hugh does-ent live."</p>
<p>"Oh, I don't know!" said Helen, annoyed. "I don't think it's
such a bad bargain for him either, you know. I think pretty well
of myself, too." And she would laugh, huskily, heartily, trying
in laughter to conceal her resentment, but visibly, to every eye
but Mrs. Barton's, angered.</p>
<p>A moment later, on some pretext, she would be back into the
house, where, with a face contorted by her rising hysteria, to
Luke, Eugene, or any sympathetic audience, she would burst
out:</p>
<p>"You heard that, didn't you? You heard that? You see what I've
got to put up with, don't you? Do you see? Do you blame me for
not wanting that damned old woman around? Do you? You see how she
wants to run things, don't you? Do you see how she rubs it into
me whenever she gets a chance? She can't bear to give him up. Of
course not! He's her meal-ticket. They've bled him white. Why,
even now, if it came to a question of choosing between us&mdash;"
her face worked strongly. She could not continue. In a moment she
quieted herself, and said decisively: "I suppose you know now why
we're going to live away from them. You see, don't you? Do you
blame me?"</p>
<p>"No'm," said Eugene, obedient after pumping.</p>
<p>"It's a d-d-damn shame!" said Luke loyally.</p>
<p>At this moment Mrs. Barton, kindly but authoritative, called
from the veranda:</p>
<p>"Hel-en! Where are you, Hel-en?"</p>
<p>"O gotohell. Gotohell!" said Helen, in a comic undertone.</p>
<p>"Yes? What is it?" she called out sharply.</p>
<p>You see, don't you?</p>
<p>She was married at Dixieland, because she was having a big
wedding. She knew a great many people.</p>
<p>As her wedding-day approached, her suppressed hysteria
mounted. Her sense of decorum grew militant: she attacked Eliza
bitterly for keeping certain dubious people in the house.</p>
<p>"Mama, in heaven's name! What do you mean by allowing such
goings- on right in the face of Hugh and his people? What do you
suppose they think of it? Have you no respect for my feelings?
Good heavens, are you going to have the house full of chippies on
the night of my wedding?" Her voice was high and cracked. She
almost wept.</p>
<p>"Why, child!" said Eliza, with troubled face. "What do you
mean? I've never noticed anything."</p>
<p>"Are you blind! Every one's talking about it! They're
practically living together!" This last was a reference to a
condition existing between a dissipated and alcoholic young man
and a darkly handsome young woman, slightly tubercular.</p>
<p>To Eugene was assigned the task of digging this couple out of
their burrow. He waited sternly outside the girl's room, watching
the shadow dance at the door crack. At the end of the sixth hour,
the besieged surrendered&mdash;the man came out. The
boy&mdash;pallid, but proud of his trust&mdash;told the
house-defiler that he must go. The young man agreed with cheerful
alcoholism. He went at once.</p>
<p>Mrs. Pert was saved in the house-cleaning.</p>
<p>"After all," said Helen, "what do we know about her? They can
say what they like about Fatty. I like her."</p>
<p>Fems, flowers, potted plants, presents and guests arriving.
The long nasal drone of the Presbyterian minister. The packed
crowd. The triumphant booming of "The Wedding March."</p>
<p>A flashlight: Hugh Barton and his bride limply
astare&mdash;frightened; Gant, Ben, Luke, and Eugene, widely,
sheepishly agrin; Eliza, high- sorrowful and sad; Mrs. Selborne
and a smile of subtle mystery; the pert flower-girls; Pearl
Hines' happy laughter.</p>
<p>When it was over, Eliza and her daughter hung in each other's
arms, weeping.</p>
<p>Eliza repeated over and over, from guest to guest:</p>
<blockquote>"A son is a son till he gets him a wife,<br>
But a daughter's a daughter all the days of her
life."</blockquote>
<p>She was comforted.</p>
<p>They escaped at length, wilted, from the thronging press of
well- wishing guests. White-faced, scared witless, Mr. and Mrs.
Hugh Barton got into a closed car. It was done! They would spend
the night at the Battery Hill. Ben had engaged the wedding-suite.
To- morrow, a honeymoon to Niagara.</p>
<p>Before they went, the girl kissed Eugene with something of the
old affection.</p>
<p>"I'll see you in the Fall, honey. Come over as soon as you're
settled."</p>
<p>For Hugh Barton was beginning life with his bride in a new
place. He was going to the capital of the State. And it had
already been determined, chiefly by Gant, that Eugene was going
to the State University.</p>
<p>But Hugh and Helen did not go honeymooning the next morning,
as they had planned. During the night, as she lay at Dixieland,
old Mrs. Barton was taken with a violent, a retching sickness.
For once, her massive digestive mechanism failed to meet the
heavy demands she had put upon it during the pre-nuptial
banqueting. She came near death.</p>
<p>Hugh and Helen returned abruptly next morning to a scene of
dismal tinsellings and jaded lilies. Helen hurled her vitality
into the sick woman's care; dominant, furious, all-mastering, she
blew back her life into her. Within three days, Mrs. Barton was
out of danger; but her complete recovery was slow, ugly, and
painful. As the days lengthened out wearily, the girl became more
and more bitter over her thwarted honeymoon. Rushing out of the
sick-room, she would enter Eliza's kitchen with writhen face,
unable to control her anger:</p>
<p>"That damned old woman! Sometimes I believe she did it on
purpose. My God, am I to get no happiness from life? Will they
never leave me alone? Urr-p! Urr-p!"&mdash;Her rough bacchic
smile played loosely over her large unhappy face. "Mama, in God's
name where does it all come from?" she said, grinning tearfully.
"I do nothing but mop up after her. Will you please tell me how
long it's going to last?"</p>
<p>Eliza laughed slyly, passing her finger under her broad
nosewing.</p>
<p>"Why, child!" she said. "What in the world! I've never seen
the like! She must have saved up for the last six months."</p>
<p>"Yes, sir!" said Helen, looking vaguely away, with a profane
smile playing across her mouth, "I'd just like to know where the
hell it all comes from. I've had everything else," she said, with
a rough angry laugh, "I'm expecting one of her kidneys at any
minute."</p>
<p>"Whew-w!" cried Eliza, shaken with laughter.</p>
<p>"Hel-en! Oh Hel'en!" Mrs. Barton's voice came feebly in to
them.</p>
<p>"O gotohell!" said the girl, sotto-voce. "Urr-p! Urr-p!" She
burst suddenly into tears: "Is it going to be like this always! I
sometimes believe the judgment of God is against us all. Papa was
right."</p>
<p>"Pshaw!" said Eliza, wetting her fingers, and threading a
needle before the light. "I'd go on and pay no more attention to
her. There's nothing wrong with her. It's all imagination!" It
was Eliza's rooted conviction that most human ills, except her
own, were "all imagination."</p>
<p>"Hel-en!"</p>
<p>"All right! I'm coming!" the girl cried cheerfully, turning an
angry grin on Eliza as she went. It was funny. It was ugly. It
was terrible.</p>
<p>It seemed, in fact, that papa was right, and that the chief
celestial Cloud-Pusher, the often hymned, whom our bitter moderns
have sometimes called "the ancient Jester"&mdash;had turned his
frown upon their fortunes.</p>
<p>It began to rain&mdash;rain incessant, spouting, torrential
rain, fell among the reeking hills, leaving grass and foliage
drowned upon the slopes, starting the liquid avalanche of earth
upon a settlement, glutting lean rocky mountain-streams to a
foaming welter of yellow flood. It mined the yellow banks away
with unheard droppings; it caved in hillsides; it drank the steep
banked earth away below the rails, leaving them strung to their
aerial ties across a gutted canyon.</p>
<p>There was a flood in Altamont. It swept down in a converging
width from the hills, filling the little river, and foaming
beyond its banks in a wide waste Mississippi. It looted the
bottomlands of the river; it floated iron and wooden bridges from
their piers as it might float a leaf; it brought ruin to the
railway flats and all who dwelt therein.</p>
<p>The town was cut off from every communication with the world.
At the end of the third week, as the waters slid back into their
channels, Hugh Barton and his bride, crouched grimly in the great
pit of the Buick, rode out through flooded roads, crawled
desperately over ruined trestles, daring the irresistible wrath
of water to achieve their wilted anti-climactic honeymoon.</p>
<p>"He will go where I send him or not at all," Gant spoke his
final word, not loudly.</p>
<p>Thus, it was decided that Eugene must go to the State
University.</p>
<p>Eugene did not want to go to the State University.</p>
<p>For two years he had romanced with Margaret Leonard about his
future education. It was proposed that, in view of his youth, he
should attend Vanderbilt (or Virginia) for two years, go to
Harvard for two years more, and then, having arrived by easy
stages at Paradise, "top things off" with a year or two at
Oxford.</p>
<p>"Then," said John Dorsey Leonard, who talked enchantingly on
the subject, between mouthfuls of clabber, "then, my sonny, a man
may begin to say he's really 'cultsherd.' After that, of course,"
he continued with a spacious carelessness, "he may travel for a
year or so."</p>
<p>But the Leonards were not yet ready to part with him.</p>
<p>"You're too young, boy," said Margaret Leonard. "Can't you
persuade your father to wait another year? You're only a child in
years, Eugene. You have all the time in the world." Her eyes
darkened as she talked.</p>
<p>Gant would not be persuaded.</p>
<p>"He's old enough," he said. "When I was his age I had been
earning my living for years. I'm getting old. I won't be here
much longer. I want him to begin to make a name for himself
before I die."</p>
<p>He refused stubbornly to consider any postponement. In his
youngest son he saw the last hope of his name's survival in
laurels&mdash;in the political laurels he so valued. He wanted
his son to be a great and far-seeing statesman and a member of
the Republican or Democratic party. His choice of a university
was therefore a measure of political expediency, founded upon the
judgment of his legal and political friends.</p>
<p>"He's ready to go," said Gant, "and he's going to the State
University, and nowhere else. He'll be given as good an education
there as he can get anywhere. Furthermore, he will make friends
there who will stand by him the rest of his life." He turned upon
his son a glance of bitter reproach. "There are very few boys who
have had your chance," said he, "and you ought to be grateful
instead of turning up your nose at it. Mark my words, you'll live
to see the day when you'll thank me for sending you there. Now,
I've given you my last word: you'll go where I send you or you'll
go nowhere at all."</p>
<h2>PART THREE</h2>
<h3>28</h3>
<p>Eugene was not quite sixteen years old when he was sent away
to the university. He was, at the time, over six feet and three
inches tall, and weighed perhaps 130 pounds. He had been sick
very little in his life, but his rapid growth had eaten sharply
at his strength: he was full of a wild energy of mind and body
that devoured him and left him exhausted. He tired very
quickly.</p>
<p>He was a child when he went away: he was a child who had
looked much on pain and evil, and remained a fantasist of the
Ideal. Walled up in his great city of visions, his tongue had
learned to mock, his lip to sneer, but the harsh rasp of the
world had worn no grooving in the secret life. Again and again he
had been bogged in the gray slough of factuality. His cruel eyes
had missed the meaning of no gesture, his packed and bitter heart
had sweltered in him like a hot ingot, but all his hard wisdom
melted at the glow of his imagination. He was not a child when he
reflected, but when he dreamt, he was; and it was the child and
dreamer that governed his belief. He belonged, perhaps, to an
older and simpler race of men: he belonged with the Mythmakers.
For him, the sun was a lordly lamp to light him on his grand
adventuring. He believed in brave heroic lives. He believed in
the fine flowers of tenderness and gentleness he had little
known. He believed in beauty and in order, and that he would
wreak out their mighty forms upon the distressful chaos of his
life. He believed in love, and in the goodness and glory of
women. He believed in valiance, and he hoped that, like Socrates,
he would do nothing mean or common in the hour of danger. He
exulted in his youth, and he believed that he could never
die.</p>
<p>Four years later, when he was graduated, he had passed his
adolescence, the kiss of love and death burned on his lips, and
he was still a child.</p>
<p>When it was at last plain that Gant's will was on this
inflexible, Margaret Leonard had said, quietly:</p>
<p>"Well, then, go your ways, boy. Go your ways. God bless
you."</p>
<p>She looked a moment at his long thin figure and turned to John
Dorsey Leonard with wet eyes:</p>
<p>"Do you remember that shaver in knee-pants who came to us four
years ago? Can you believe it?"</p>
<p>John Dorsey Leonard laughed quietly, with weary gentle
relaxation.</p>
<p>"What do you know about it?" he said.</p>
<p>When Margaret turned to him again her voice, low and gentle,
was charged with the greatest passion he had ever heard in
it.</p>
<p>"You are taking a part of our heart with you, boy. Do you know
that?"</p>
<p>She took his trembling hand gently between her own lean
fingers. He lowered his head and closed his eyelids tightly.</p>
<p>"Eugene," she continued, "we could not love you more if you
were our own child. We wanted to keep you with us for another
year, but since that cannot be, we are sending you out with our
hopes pinned to you. Oh, boy, you are fine. There is no atom in
you that is not fine. A glory and a chrism of bright genius rest
upon you. God bless you: the world is yours."</p>
<p>The proud words of love and glory sank like music to his
heart, evoking their bright pictures of triumph, and piercing him
with the bitter shame of his concealed desires. Love bade him
enter, but his soul drew back, guilty of lust and sin.</p>
<p>He tore his hand from her grasp, clinching, with the strangled
cry of an animal, his convulsive throat.</p>
<p>"I can't!" he choked. "You mustn't think&mdash;" He could not
go on; his life groped blindly to confessional.</p>
<p>Later, after he left her, her light kiss upon his cheek, the
first she had ever given him, burned like a ring of fire.</p>
<p>That summer he was closer to Ben than ever before. They
occupied the same room at Woodson Street. Luke had returned to
the Westinghouse plant at Pittsburgh after Helen's marriage.</p>
<p>Gant still occupied his sitting-room, but the rest of the
house he had rented to a sprightly gray-haired widow of forty.
She looked after them beautifully, but she served Ben with an
especial tenderness. At night, on the cool veranda, Eugene would
find them below the ripening clusters, hear the quiet note of his
brother's voice, his laugh, see the slow red arc of his cigarette
in darkness.</p>
<p>The quiet one was more quiet and morose than he had ever been
before: he stalked through the house scowling ferociously. All
his conversation with Eliza was short and bitterly scornful; with
Gant he spoke hardly at all. They had never talked together.
Their eyes never met&mdash;a great shame, the shame of father and
son, that mystery that goes down beyond motherhood, beyond life,
that mysterious shame that seals the lips of all men, and lives
in their hearts, had silenced them.</p>
<p>But to Eugene, Ben talked more freely than ever before. As
they sat upon their beds at night, reading and smoking before
they slept, all of the pain and bitterness of Benjamin Gant's
life burst out in violent denunciation. He began to speak with
slow sullen difficulty, halting over his words as he did when he
read, but speaking more rapidly as his quiet voice became more
passionate.</p>
<p>"I suppose they've told you how poor they are?" he began,
tossing his cigarette away.</p>
<p>"Well," said Eugene, "I've got to go easy. I mustn't waste my
money."</p>
<p>"Ah-h!" said Ben, making an ugly face. He laughed silently,
with a thin and bitter contortion of his lips.</p>
<p>"Papa said that a lot of boys pay their own way through
college by waiting on tables and so on. Perhaps I can do
something like that."</p>
<p>Ben turned over on his side until he faced his brother,
propping himself on his thin hairy forearm.</p>
<p>"Now listen, 'Gene," he said sternly, "don't be a damned
little fool, do you hear? You take every damn cent you can get
out of them," he added savagely.</p>
<p>"Well, I appreciate what they're doing. I'm getting a lot more
than the rest of you had. They're doing a lot for me," said the
boy.</p>
<p>"For YOU, you little idiot!" said Ben, scowling at him in
disgust. "They're doing it all for themselves. Don't let them get
away with that. They think you'll make good and bring a lot of
credit to them some day. They're rushing you into it two years
too soon, as it is. No, you take everything you can get. The rest
of us never had anything, but I want to see you get all that's
coming to you. My God!" he cried furiously.</p>
<p>"Their money's doing no one any good rotting in the damned
bank, is it? No, 'Gene, get all you can. When you get down there,
if you find you need more to hold your own with the other boys,
make the old man give it to you. You've never had a chance to
hold your head up in your own home town, so make the most of your
chances when you get away."</p>
<p>He lighted a cigarette and smoked in bitter silence for a
moment.</p>
<p>"To hell with it all!" he said. "What in God's name are we
living for!"</p>
<p>Eugene's first year at the university was filled for him with
loneliness, pain, and failure. Within three weeks of his
matriculation, he had been made the dupe of a half-dozen classic
jokes, his ignorance of all campus tradition had been exploited,
his gullibility was a byword. He was the greenest of all green
Freshmen, past and present: he had listened attentively to a
sermon in chapel by a sophomore with false whiskers; he had
prepared studiously for an examination on the contents of the
college catalogue; and he had been guilty of the inexcusable
blunder of making a speech of acceptance on his election, with
fifty others, to the literary society.</p>
<p>And these buffooneries&mdash;a little cruel, but only with the
cruelty of vacant laughter, and a part of the schedule of rough
humor in an American college&mdash;salty, extravagant, and
national&mdash;opened deep wounds in him, which his companions
hardly suspected. He was conspicuous at once not only because of
his blunders, but also because of his young wild child's face,
and his great raw length of body, with the bounding scissor legs.
The undergraduates passed him in grinning clusters: he saluted
them obediently, but with a sick heart. And the smug smiling
faces of his own classmen, the wiser Freshmen, complacently
guiltless of his own mistakes, touched him at moments with insane
fury.</p>
<p>"Smile and smile and s-mile&mdash;damn you!" he cursed through
his grating teeth. For the first time in his life he began to
dislike whatever fits too snugly in a measure. He began to
dislike and envy the inconspicuous mould of general
nature&mdash;the multitudinous arms, legs, hands, feet, and
figures that are comfortably shaped for ready-made garments. And
the prettily regular, wherever he found it, he hated&mdash;the
vacantly handsome young men, with shining hair, evenly parted in
the middle, with sure strong middling limbs meant to go
gracefully on dancefloors. He longed to see them commit some
awkward blunder&mdash;to trip and sprawl, to be flatulent, to
lose a strategic button in mixed company, to be unconscious of a
hanging shirt-tail while with a pretty girl. But they made no
mistakes.</p>
<p>As he walked across the campus, he heard his name called
mockingly from a dozen of the impartial windows, he heard the
hidden laughter, and he ground his teeth. And at night, he
stiffened with shame in his dark bed, ripping the sheet between
his fingers as, with the unbalanced vision, the swollen egotism
of the introvert, the picture of a crowded student-room, filled
with the grinning historians of his exploits, burned in his
brain. He strangled his fierce cry with a taloned hand. He wanted
to blot out the shameful moment, unweave the loom. It seemed to
him that his ruin was final, that he had stamped the beginning of
his university life with folly that would never be forgotten, and
that the best he could do would be to seek out obscurity for the
next four years. He saw himself in his clown's trappings and
thought of his former vision of success and honor with a
lacerating self-contempt.</p>
<p>There was no one to whom he could turn: he had no friends. His
conception of university life was a romantic blur, evoked from
his reading and tempered with memories of Stover at Yale, Young
Fred Fearnot, and jolly youths with affectionate linked arms,
bawling out a cheer-song. No one had given him even the
rudimentary data of the somewhat rudimentary life of an American
university. He had not been warned of the general taboos. Thus,
he had come greenly on his new life, unprepared, as he came ever
thereafter on all new life, save for his opium visions of himself
a stranger in Arcadias.</p>
<p>He was alone. He was desperately lonely.</p>
<p>But the university was a charming, an unforgettable place. It
was situated in the little village of Pulpit Hill, in the central
midland of the big State. Students came and departed by motor
from the dreary tobacco town of Exeter, twelve miles away: the
countryside was raw, powerful and ugly, a rolling land of field,
wood, and hollow; but the university itself was buried in a
pastoral wilderness, on a long tabling butte, which rose steeply
above the country. One burst suddenly, at the hill-top, on the
end of the straggling village street, flanked by faculty houses,
and winding a mile in to the town centre and the university. The
central campus sloped back and up over a broad area of rich turf,
groved with magnificent ancient trees. A quadrangle of post-
Revolutionary buildings of weathered brick bounded the upper end:
other newer buildings, in the modern bad manner (the Pedagogic
Neo- Greeky), were scattered around beyond the central design:
beyond, there was a thickly forested wilderness. There was still
a good flavor of the wilderness about the place&mdash;one felt
its remoteness, its isolated charm. It seemed to Eugene like a
provincial outpost of great Rome: the wilderness crept up to it
like a beast.</p>
<p>Its great poverty, its century-long struggle in the forest,
had given the university a sweetness and a beauty it was later to
forfeit. It had the fine authority of provincialism&mdash;the
provincialism of an older South. Nothing mattered but the State:
the State was a mighty empire, a rich kingdom&mdash;there was,
beyond, a remote and semi-barbaric world.</p>
<p>Few of the university's sons had been distinguished in the
nation's life&mdash;there had been an obscure President of the
United States, and a few Cabinet members, but few had sought such
distinction: it was glory enough to be a great man in one's
State. Nothing beyond mattered very much.</p>
<p>In this pastoral setting a young man was enabled to loaf
comfortably and delightfully through four luxurious and indolent
years. There was, God knows, seclusion enough for monastic
scholarship, but the rare romantic quality of the atmosphere, the
prodigal opulence of Springtime, thick with flowers and drenched
in a fragrant warmth of green shimmering light, quenched pretty
thoroughly any incipient rash of bookishness. Instead, they
loafed and invited their souls or, with great energy and
enthusiasm, promoted the affairs of glee-clubs, athletic teams,
class politics, fraternities, debating societies, and dramatic
clubs. And they talked&mdash;always they talked, under the trees,
against the ivied walls, assembled in their rooms, they
talked&mdash;in limp sprawls&mdash;incessant, charming, empty
Southern talk; they talked with a large easy fluency about God,
the Devil, and philosophy, the girls, politics, athletics,
fraternities and the girls&mdash;My God! how they talked!</p>
<p>"Observe," lisped Mr. Torrington, the old Rhodes Scholar
(Pulpit Hill and Merton, '14), "observe how skilfully he holds
suspense until the very end. Observe with what consummate art he
builds up to his climax, keeping his meaning hidden until the
very last word." Further, in fact.</p>
<p>At last, thought Eugene, I am getting an education. This must
be good writing, because it seems so very dull. When it hurts,
the dentist says, it does you good. Democracy must be real,
because it is so very earnest. It must be a certainty, because it
is so elegantly embalmed in this marble mausoleum of language.

<p>But there was no word here of the loud raucous voice of
America, political conventions and the Big Brass Band, Tweed,
Tammany, the Big Stick, lynching bees and black barbecue parties,
the Boston Irish, and the damnable machinations of the Pope as
exposed by the Babylon Hollow Trumpet (Dem.), the rape of the
Belgian virgins, rum, oil, Wall Street and Mexico.</p>
<p>All that, Mr. Torrington would have said, was temporary and
accidental. It was unsound.</p>
<p>Mr. Torrington smiled moistly at Eugene and urged him tenderly
into a chair drawn intimately to his desk.</p>
<p>"Mr.&mdash;? Mr.&mdash;?&mdash;" he said, fumbling at his
index cards.</p>
<p>"Gant," said Eugene.</p>
<p>"Ah, yes&mdash;Mr. Gant," he smiled his contrition.
"Now&mdash;about your outside reading?" he began.</p>
<p>But what, thought Eugene, about my inside reading?</p>
<p>Did he like to read? Ah&mdash;that was good. He was so glad to
hear it. The true university in these days, said Carlyle (he did
hope Eugene liked rugged old Thomas), was a collection of
books.</p>
<p>"Yes, sir," said Eugene.</p>
<p>That, it seemed to him, was the Oxford Plan. Oh, yes&mdash;he
had been there, three years, in fact. His mild eye kindled. To
loaf along the High on a warm Spring day, stopping to examine in
the bookseller's windows the treasures that might be had for so
little. Then to Buol's or to a friend's room for tea, or for a
walk in the meadows or Magdalen gardens, or to look down into the
quad, at the gay pageant of youth below. Ah&mdash;Ah! A great
place? Well&mdash;he'd hardly say that. It all depended what one
meant by a great place. Half the looseness in
thought&mdash;unfortunately, he fancied, more prevalent among
American than among English youth&mdash;came from an indefinite
exuberance of ill-defined speech.</p>
<p>"Yes, sir," said Eugene.</p>
<p>A great place? Well, he'd scarcely say that. The expression
was typically American. Butter-lipped, he turned on the boy a
smile of soft unfriendliness:</p>
<p>"It kills," he observed, "a man's useless enthusiasms."</p>
<p>Eugene whitened a little.</p>
<p>"That's fine," he said.</p>
<p>Now&mdash;let him see. Did he like plays&mdash;the modern
drama? Excellent. They were doing some very interesting things in
the modern drama. Barrie&mdash;oh, a charming fellow! What was
that? Shaw!</p>
<p>"Yes, sir," said Eugene. "I've read all the others. There's a
new book out."</p>
<p>"Oh, but really! My dear boy!" said Mr. Torrington with gentle
amazement. He shrugged his shoulders and became politely
indifferent. Very well, if he liked. Of course, he thought it
rather a pity to waste one's time so when they were really doing
some first-rate things. That was JUST the trouble, however. The
appeal of a man like that was mainly to the unformed taste, the
uncritical judgment. He had a flashy attraction for the immature.
Oh, yes! Undoubtedly an amusing fellow. Clever&mdash;yes, but
hardly significant. And&mdash;didn't he think&mdash;a trifle
noisy? Or had he noticed that? Yes&mdash;there was to be sure an
amusing Celtic strain, not without charm, but unsound. He was not
in line with the best modern thought.</p>
<p>"I'll take the Barrie," said Eugene.</p>
<p>Yes, he rather thought that would be better.</p>
<p>"Well, good day. Mr.&mdash;Mr.&mdash;?&mdash;?" he smiled,
fumbling again with his cards.</p>
<p>"Gant."</p>
<p>Oh yes, to be sure,&mdash;Gant. He held out his plump limp
hand. He did hope Mr. Gant would call on him. Perhaps he'd be
able to advise him on some of the little problems that, he knew,
were constantly cropping up during the first year. Above all, he
mustn't get discouraged.</p>
<p>"Yes, sir," said Eugene, backing feverishly to the door. When
he felt the open space behind him, he fell through it, and
vanished.</p>
<p>Anyway, he thought grimly, I've read all the damned Barries.
I'll write the damned report for him, and damned well read what I
damn well please.</p>
<p>God save our King and Queen!</p>
<p>He had courses besides in Chemistry, Mathematics, Greek, and
Latin.</p>
<p>He worked hard and with interest at his Latin. His instructor
was a tall shaven man, with a yellow saturnine face. He parted
his scant hair cleverly in such a way as to suggest horns. His
lips were always twisted in a satanic smile, his eyes gleamed
sideward with heavy malicious humor. Eugene had great hopes of
him. When the boy arrived, panting and breakfastless, a moment
after the class had settled to order, the satanic professor would
greet him with elaborate irony: "Ah there, Brother Gant! Just in
time for church again. Have you slept well?"</p>
<p>The class roared its appreciation of these subtleties. And
later, in an expectant pause, he would deepen his arched brows
portentously, stare up mockingly under his bushy eyebrows at his
expectant audience, and say, in a deep sardonic voice:</p>
<p>"And now, I am going to request Brother Gant to favor us with
one of his polished and scholarly translations."</p>
<p>These heavy jibes were hard to bear because, of all the class,
two dozen or more, Brother Gant was the only one to prepare his
work without the aid of a printed translation. He worked hard on
Livy and Tacitus, going over the lesson several times until he
had dug out a smooth and competent reading of his own. This he
was stupid enough to deliver in downright fashion, without
hesitation, or a skilfully affected doubt here and there. For his
pains and honesty he was handsomely rewarded by the Amateur
Diabolist. The lean smile would deepen as the boy read, the man
would lift his eyes significantly to the grinning class, and when
it was over, he would say:</p>
<p>"Bravo, Brother Gant! Excellent! Splendid! You are riding a
good pony&mdash;but a little too smoothly, my boy. You ride a
little too well."</p>
<p>The class sniggered heavily.</p>
<p>When he could stand it no longer, he sought the man out one
day after the class.</p>
<p>"See here, sir! See here!" he began in a voice choking with
fury and exasperation. "Sir&mdash;I assure you&mdash;" he thought
of all the grinning apes in the class, palming off profitably
their stolen translations, and he could not go on.</p>
<p>The Devil's Disciple was not a bad man; he was only, like most
men who pride themselves on their astuteness, a foolish one.</p>
<p>"Nonsense, Mr. Gant," said he kindly. "You don't think you can
fool me on a translation, do you? It's all right with me, you
know," he continued, grinning. "If you'd rather ride a pony than
do your own work, I'll give you a passing grade&mdash;so long as
you do it well."</p>
<p>"But&mdash;" Eugene began explosively.</p>
<p>"But I think it's a pity, Mr. Gant," said the professor,
gravely, "that you're willing to slide along this way. See here,
my boy, you're capable of doing first-rate work. I can see that.
Why don't you make an effort? Why don't you buckle down and
really study, after this?"</p>
<p>Eugene stared at the man, with tears of anger in his eyes. He
sputtered but could not speak. But suddenly, as he looked down
into the knowing leer, the perfect and preposterous injustice of
the thing&mdash;like a caricature&mdash;overcame him: he burst
into an explosive laugh of rage and amusement which the teacher,
no doubt, accepted as confession.</p>
<p>"Well, what do you say?" he asked. "Will you try?"</p>
<p>"All right! Yes!" the boy yelled. "I'll try it."</p>
<p>He bought at once a copy of the translation used by the class.
Thereafter, when he read, faltering prettily here and there over
a phrase, until his instructor should come to his aid, the
satanic professor listened gravely and attentively, nodding his
head in approval from time to time, and saying, with great
satisfaction, when he had finished: "Good, Mr. Gant. Very good.
That shows what a little real work will do."</p>
<p>And privately, he would say: "You see the difference, don't
you? I knew at once when you stopped using that pony. Your
translation is not so smooth, but it's your own now. You're doing
good work, my boy, and you're getting something out of it. It's
worth it, isn't it?"</p>
<p>"Yes," said Eugene gratefully, "it certainly is&mdash;"</p>
<p>By far the most distinguished of his teachers this first year
was Mr. Edward Pettigrew ("Buck") Benson, the Greek professor.
Buck Benson was a little man in the middle-forties, a bachelor,
somewhat dandified, but old-fashioned, in his dress. He wore wing
collars, large plump cravats, and suede-topped shoes. His hair
was thick, heavily grayed, beautifully kept. His face was
courteously pugnacious, fierce, with large yellow bulging
eyeballs, and several bulldog pleatings around the mouth. It was
an altogether handsome ugliness.</p>
<p>His voice was low, lazy, pleasant, with an indolent drawl, but
without changing its pace or its inflection he could flay a
victim with as cruel a tongue as ever wagged, and in the next
moment wipe out hostility, restore affection, heal all wounds by
the same agency. His charm was enormous. Among the students he
was the subject for comical speculation&mdash;in their myths,
they made of him a passionate and sophisticated lover, and his
midget cycle-car, which bounded like an overgrown toy around the
campus, the scene of many romantic seductions.</p>
<p>He was a good Grecian&mdash;an elegant indolent scholar. Under
his instruction Eugene began to read Homer. The boy knew little
grammar&mdash;he had learned little at Leonard's&mdash;but, since
he had had the bad judgment to begin Greek under some one other
than Buck Benson, Buck Benson thought he knew even less than he
did. He studied desperately, but the bitter dyspeptic gaze of the
elegant little man frightened him into halting, timorous, clumsy
performances. And as he proceeded, with thumping heart and
tremulous voice, Buck Benson's manner would become more and more
weary, until finally, dropping his book, he would drawl:</p>
<p>"Mister Gant, you make me so damned mad I could throw you out
the window."</p>
<p>But, on the examination, he gave an excellent performance, and
translated from sight beautifully. He was saved. Buck Benson
commended his paper publicly with lazy astonishment, and gave him
a fair grade. Thereafter, they slipped quickly into an easier
relation: by Spring, he was reading Euripides with some
confidence.</p>
<p>But that which remained most vividly, later, in the drowning
years which cover away so much of beauty, was the vast sea-surge
of Homer which beat in his brain, his blood, his pulses, as did
the sea- sound in Gant's parlor shells, when first he heard it to
the slowly pacing feet and the hexametrical drawl of Buck Benson,
the lost last weary son of Hellas.</p>
<p>Dwaney de clangay genett, argereoyo beeoyo&mdash;above the
whistle's shriek, the harsh scream of the wheel, the riveter's
tattoo, the vast long music endures, and ever shall. What
dissonance can quench it? What jangling violence can disturb or
conquer it&mdash;entombed in our flesh when we were young,
remembered like "the apple tree, the singing, and the gold"?</p>
<h3>29</h3>
<p>Before his first year was ended, the boy had changed his
lodging four or five times. He finished the year living alone in
a big bare carpetless room&mdash;an existence rare at Pulpit
Hill, where the students, with very few exceptions, lived two or
three to a room. In that room began a physical isolation, hard
enough to bear at first, which later became indispensable to him,
mind and body.</p>
<p>He had come to Pulpit Hill with Hugh Barton, who met him at
Exeter and drove him over in the big roadster. After his
registration, he had secured lodging quickly at the house of an
Altamont widow whose son was a student. Hugh Barton looked
relieved and departed, hoping to reach home and his bride by
nightfall.</p>
<p>With fine enthusiasm, but poor judgment, Eugene paid the widow
two months in advance. Her name was Bradley: she was a flabby
petulant woman with a white face and heart-disease. But her food
was excellent. Mrs. Bradley's student son answered to his initial
letters&mdash;"G. T." G. T. Bradley, a member of the sophomore
class, was a surly scowling youth of nineteen&mdash;a mixture, in
equal parts, of servility and insolence. His chief, but thwarted,
ambition was to be elected to membership in a fraternity. Having
failed to win recognition by the exercise of his natural talents,
he was driven by an extraordinary obsession that fame and glory
would come to him if he were known as the slave-driver of a
number of Freshmen.</p>
<p>But these tactics, tried on Eugene, produced at once defiance
and resentment. Their hostility was bitter: G. T. set himself to
thwart and ruin the beginnings of the boy's university life. He
trapped him into public blunders, and solicited audiences to
witness his humiliation; he wheedled his confidence and betrayed
it. But there is a final mockery, an ultimate treachery that
betrays us into shame; our capacity for villainy, like all our
other capacities, is so small. The day came when Eugene was free
from bondage. He was free to leave the widow's house of sorrow.
G. T. approached him, scowling, diffidently.</p>
<p>"I hear you're leaving us, 'Gene," he said.</p>
<p>"Yes," said Eugene.</p>
<p>"Is it because of the way I've acted?"</p>
<p>"Yes," said Eugene.</p>
<p>"You take things too seriously, 'Gene," he said.</p>
<p>"Yes," said Eugene.</p>
<p>"I don't want you to go having hard feelings, 'Gene. Let's
shake hands and be friends."</p>
<p>He thrust his hand out stiffly. Eugene looked at the hard weak
face, the furtive, unhappy eyes casting about for something they
might call their own. The thick black hair was plastered stiff
with grease; he saw white points of dandruff at the roots. There
was an odor of talcum powder. He had been borne and nourished in
the body of his white-faced mother&mdash;for what? To lap the
scornful stroking fingers of position; to fawn miserably before
an emblem. Eugene had a moment of nausea.</p>
<p>"Let's shake hands, 'Gene," said the boy once more, waggling
his out-thrust fingers.</p>
<p>"No," said Eugene.</p>
<p>"You don't hate me, do you?" whined G. T.</p>
<p>"No," said Eugene.</p>
<p>He had a moment of pity, of sickness. He forgave because it
was necessary to forget.</p>
<p>Eugene lived in a small world, but its ruins for him were
actual. His misfortunes were trifling, but their effect upon his
spirit was deep and calamitous. He withdrew deeply and scornfully
into his cell. He was friendless, whipped with scorn and pride.
He set his face blindly against all the common united life around
him.</p>
<p>It was during this bitter and desperate autumn that Eugene
first met Jim Trivett.</p>
<p>Jim Trivett, the son of a rich tobacco farmer in the eastern
part of the State, was a good tempered young tough of twenty
years. He was a strong, rather foul-looking boy, with a coarse
protruding mouth, full-meated and slightly ajar, constantly rayed
with a faint loose smile and blotted at the comer with a brown
smear of tobacco juice. He had bad teeth. His hair was
light-brown, dry, and unruly: it stuck out in large untidy mats.
He was dressed in the last cheap extreme of the dreadful fashion
of the time: skin-tight trousers that ended an inch above his
oxford shoes exposing an inch of clocked hose, a bobtailed coat
belted in across his kidneys, large striped collars of silk.
Under his coat he wore a big sweater with high-school
numerals.</p>
<p>Jim Trivett lived with several other students from his
community in a lodging-house near Mrs. Bradley's but closer to
the west gate of the university. There were four young men banded
together for security and companionship in two untidy rooms
heated to a baking dryness by small cast-iron stoves. They made
constant preparations for study, but they never studied: one
would enter sternly, announcing that he had "a hell of a day
tomorrow," and begin the most minute preparations for a long
contest with his books: he would sharpen his pencils carefully
and deliberately, adjust his lamp, replenish the red-hot stove,
move his chair, put on an eye- shade, clean his pipe, stuff it
carefully with tobacco, light, relight, and empty it, then, with
an expression of profound relief, hear a rapping on his door.</p>
<p>"Come in the house, Goddamn it!" he would roar hospitably.</p>
<p>"Hello, 'Gene! Pull up a chair, son, and sit down," said Tom
Grant. He was a thickly built boy, gaudily dressed; he had a low
forehead, black hair, and a kind, stupid, indolent temper.</p>
<p>"Have you been working?"</p>
<p>"Hell, yes!" shouted Jim Trivett. "I've been working like a
son- of-a-bitch."</p>
<p>"God!" said Tom Grant, turning slowly to look at him. "Boy,
you're going to choke to death on one of those some day." He
shook his head slowly and sadly, then continued with a rough
laugh: "If old man Trivett knew what you were doing with his
money, damn if he wouldn't bust a gut."</p>
<p>"Gene!" said Jim Trivett, "what the hell do you know about
this damned English, anyway?"</p>
<p>"What he doesn't know about it," said Tom Grant, "you could
write out on the back of a postage stamp. Old man Sanford thinks
you're hell, 'Gene."</p>
<p>"I thought you had Torrington," said Jim Trivett.</p>
<p>"No," said Eugene, "I wasn't English enough. Young and crude.
I changed, thank God! What is it you want, Jim?" he asked.</p>
<p>"I've got a long paper to write. I don't know what to write
about," said Jim Trivett.</p>
<p>"What do you want me to do? Write it for you?"</p>
<p>"Yes," said Jim Trivett.</p>
<p>"Write your own damn paper," said Eugene with mimic toughness,
"I won't do it for you. I'll help you if I can."</p>
<p>"When are you going to let Hard Boy take you to Exeter?" said
Tom Grant, winking at Jim Trivett.</p>
<p>Eugene flushed, making a defensive answer.</p>
<p>"I'm ready to go any time he is," he said uneasily.</p>
<p>"Look here, Legs!" said Jim Trivett, grinning loosely. "Do you
really want to go with me or are you just bluffing?"</p>
<p>"I'll go with you! I've told you I'd go with you!" Eugene said
angrily. He trembled a little.</p>
<p>Tom Grant grinned slyly at Jim Trivett.</p>
<p>"It'll make a man of you, 'Gene," he said. "Boy, it'll sure
put hair on your chest." He laughed, not loudly, but
uncontrollably, shaking his head as at some secret thought.</p>
<p>Jim Trivett's loose smile widened. He spat into the
wood-box.</p>
<p>"Gawd!" he said. "They'll think Spring is here when they see
old Legs. They'll need a stepladder to git at him."</p>
<p>Tom Grant was shaken with hard fat laughter.</p>
<p>"They sure God will!" he said.</p>
<p>"Well, what about it, 'Gene?" Jim Trivett demanded suddenly.
"Is it a go? Saturday?"</p>
<p>"Suits me!" said Eugene.</p>
<p>When he had gone, they grinned thirstily at each other for a
moment, the pleased corrupters of chastity.</p>
<p>"Pshaw!" said Tom Grant. "You oughtn't to do that, Hard Boy.
You're leading the boy astray."</p>
<p>"It's not going to hurt him," said Jim Trivett. "It'll be good
for him."</p>
<p>He wiped his mouth with the back of his hand, grinning.</p>
<p>"Wait a minute!" whispered Jim Trivett. "I think this is the
place."</p>
<p>They had turned away from the centre of the dreary tobacco
town. For a quarter of an hour they had walked briskly through
drab autumnal streets, descending finally a long rutted hill that
led them, past a thinning squalor of cheap houses, almost to the
outskirts. It was three weeks before Christmas: the foggy air was
full of chill menace. There was a brooding quietness, broken by
far small sounds. They turned into a sordid little road, unpaved,
littered on both sides with negro shacks and the dwellings of
poor whites. It was a world of rickets. The road was unlighted.
Their feet stirred dryly through fallen leaves.</p>
<p>They paused before a two-storey frame house. A lamp burned
dimly behind lowered yellow shades, casting a murky pollen out
upon the smoky air.</p>
<p>"Wait a minute," said Jim Trivett, in a low voice, "I'll find
out."</p>
<p>They heard scuffling steps through the leaves. In a moment a
negro man prowled up.</p>
<p>"Hello, John," said Jim Trivett, almost inaudibly.</p>
<p>"Evenin', boss!" the negro answered wearily, but in the same
tone.</p>
<p>"We're looking for Lily Jones' house," said Jim Trivett. "Is
this it?"</p>
<p>"Yes, suh," said the negro, "dis is it."</p>
<p>Eugene leaned against a tree, listening to their quiet
conspiratorial talk. The night, vast and listening, gathered
about him its evil attentive consciousness. His lips were cold
and trembled. He thrust a cigarette between them and, shivering,
turned up the thick collar of his overcoat.</p>
<p>"Does Miss Lily know you're comin'?" the negro asked.</p>
<p>"No," said Jim Trivett. "Do you know her?"</p>
<p>"Yes, suh," said the negro. "I'll go up dar wid yo'."</p>
<p>Eugene waited in the shadow of the tree while the two men went
up to the house. They avoided the front veranda, and went around
to the side. The negro rapped gently at a latticed door. There
were always latticed doors. Why?</p>
<p>He waited, saying farewell to himself. He stood over his life,
he felt, with lifted assassin blade. He was mired to his neck,
inextricably, in complication. There was no escape.</p>
<p>There had been a faint closed noise from the house: voices and
laughter, and the cracked hoarse tone of an old phonograph. The
sound stopped quickly as the negro rapped: the shabby house
seemed to listen. In a moment, a hinge creaked stealthily: he
caught the low startled blur of a woman's voice. Who is it?
Who?</p>
<p>In another moment Jim Trivett returned to him, and said
quietly:</p>
<p>"It's all right, 'Gene. Come on."</p>
<p>He slipped a coin into the negro's hand, thanking him. Eugene
looked for a moment into the black broad friendliness of the
man's face. He had a flash of warmth through his cold limbs. The
black bawd had done his work eagerly and kindly: over their
bought unlovely loves lay the warm shadow of his affection.</p>
<p>They ascended the path quietly and, mounting two or three
steps, went in under the latticed door. A woman stood beside it,
holding it open. When they had entered, she closed it securely.
Then they crossed the little porch and entered the house.</p>
<p>They found themselves in a little hall which cleft the width
of the house. A smoky lamp, wicked low, cast its dim circle into
the dark. An uncarpeted stair mounted to the second floor. There
were two doors both to left and right, and an accordion hat-rack,
on which hung a man's battered felt hat.</p>
<p>Jim Trivett embraced the woman immediately, grinning, and
fumbling in her breast.</p>
<p>"Hello, Lily," he said.</p>
<p>"Gawd!" She smiled crudely, and continued to peer at Eugene,
curious at what the maw of night had thrown in to her. Then,
turning to Jim Trivett with a coarse laugh, she said:</p>
<p>"Lord a' mercy! Any woman that gits him will have to cut off
some of them legs."</p>
<p>"I'd like to see him with Thelma," said Jim Trivett,
grinning.</p>
<p>Lily Jones laughed hoarsely. The door to the right opened and
Thelma, a small woman, slightly built, came out, followed by high
empty yokel laughter. Jim Trivett embraced her
affectionately.</p>
<p>"My Gawd!" said Thelma, in a tinny voice. "What've we got
here?" She thrust out her sharp wrenny face, and studied Eugene
insolently.</p>
<p>"I brought you a new beau, Thelma," said Jim Trivett.</p>
<p>"Ain't he the lankiest feller you ever seen?" said Lily Jones
impersonally. "How tall are you, son?" she added, addressing him
in a kind drawl.</p>
<p>He winced a little.</p>
<p>"I don't know," he said. "I think about six three."</p>
<p>"He's more than that!" said Thelma positively. "He's seven
foot tall or I'm a liar."</p>
<p>"He hasn't measured since last week," said Jim Trivett. "He
can't be sure about it."</p>
<p>"He's young, too," said Lily, staring at him intently. "How
old are you, son?"</p>
<p>Eugene turned his pallid face away, indefinitely.</p>
<p>"Why," he croaked, "I'm about&mdash;"</p>
<p>"He's going on eighteen," said Jim Trivett loyally. "Don't you
worry about him. Old Legs knows all the ropes, all right. He's a
bearcat. I wouldn't kid you. He's been there."</p>
<p>"He don't look that old," said Lily doubtfully. "I wouldn't
call him more'n fifteen, to look at his face. Ain't he got a
little face, though?" she demanded in a slow puzzled voice.</p>
<p>"It's the only one I've got," said Eugene angrily. "Sorry I
can't change it for a larger one."</p>
<p>"It looks so funny stickin' way up there above you," she went
on patiently.</p>
<p>Thelma nudged her sharply.</p>
<p>"That's because he's got a big frame," she said. "Legs is all
right. When he begins to fill out an' put some meat on them bones
he's goin' to make a big man. You'll be a heartbreaker sure,
Legs," she said harshly, taking his cold hand and squeezing it.
In him the ghost, his stranger, turned grievously away. O God! I
shall remember, he thought.</p>
<p>"Well," said Jim Trivett, "let's git goin'." He embraced
Thelma again. They fumbled amorously.</p>
<p>"You go on upstairs, son," said Lily. "I'll be up in a minute.
The door's open."</p>
<p>"See you later, 'Gene," said Jim Trivett. "Stay with them,
son."</p>
<p>He hugged the boy roughly with one arm, and went into the room
to the left with Thelma.</p>
<p>Eugene mounted the creaking stairs slowly and entered the room
with the open door. A hot mass of coals glowed flamelessly in the
hearth. He took off his hat and overcoat and threw them across a
wooden bed. Then he sat down tensely in a rocker and leaned
forward, holding his trembling fingers to the heat. There was no
light save that of the coals; but, by their dim steady glow, he
could make out the old and ugly wall-paper, stained with long
streaks of water rust, and scaling, in dry tattered scrolls, here
and there. He sat quietly, bent forward, but he shook violently,
as with an ague, from time to time. Why am I here? This is not I,
he thought.</p>
<p>Presently he heard the woman's slow heavy tread upon the
stairs: she entered in a swimming tide of light, bearing a lamp
before her. She put the lamp down on a table and turned the wick.
He could see her now more plainly. Lily was a middle-aged country
woman, with a broad heavy figure, unhealthily soft. Her smooth
peasant face was mapped with fine little traceries of wrinkles at
the corners of mouth and eyes, as if she had worked much in the
sun. She had black hair, coarse and abundant. She was whitely
plastered with talcum powder. She was dressed shapelessly in a
fresh loose dress of gingham, unbelted. She was dressed like a
housewife, but she conceded to her profession stockings of red
silk, and slippers of red felt, trimmed with fur, in which she
walked with a flat-footed tread.</p>
<p>The woman fastened the door, and returned to the hearth where
the boy was now standing. He embraced her with feverish desire,
fondling her with his long nervous hands. Indecisively, he sat in
the rocker and drew her down clumsily on his knee. She yielded
her kisses with the coy and frigid modesty of the provincial
harlot, turning her mouth away. She shivered as his cold hands
touched her.</p>
<p>"You're cold as ice, son," she said. "What's the matter?"</p>
<p>She chafed him with rough embarrassed professionalism. In a
moment she rose impatiently.</p>
<p>"Let's git started," she said. "Where's my money?"</p>
<p>He thrust two crumpled bills into her hand.</p>
<p>Then he lay down beside her. He trembled, unnerved and
impotent. Passion was extinct in him.</p>
<p>The massed coals caved in the hearth. The lost bright wonder
died.</p>
<p>When he went down stairs, he found Jim Trivett waiting in the
hall, holding Thelma by the hand. Lily led them out quietly,
after peering through the lattice into the fog, and listening for
a moment.</p>
<p>"Be quiet," she whispered, "there's a man across the street.
They've been watching us lately."</p>
<p>"Come again, Slats," Thelma murmured, pressing his hand.</p>
<p>They went out softly, treading gently until they reached the
road. The fog had thickened: the air was saturated with fine
stinging moisture.</p>
<p>At the corner, in the glare of the street-lamp, Jim Trivett
released his breath with loud relief, and stepped forward
boldly.</p>
<p>"Damn!" he said. "I thought you were never coming. What were
you trying to do with the woman, Legs?" Then, noting the boy's
face, he added quickly, with warm concern: "What's the matter,
'Gene? Don't you feel good?"</p>
<p>"Wait a minute!" said Eugene thickly. "Be all right!"</p>
<p>He went to the curb, and vomited into the gutter. Then he
straightened, mopping his mouth with a handkerchief.</p>
<p>"How do you feel?" asked Jim Trivett. "Better?"</p>
<p>"Yes," said Eugene, "I'm all right now."</p>
<p>"Why didn't you tell me you were sick?" said Jim Trivett
chidingly.</p>
<p>"It came on all of a sudden," said Eugene. He added presently:
"I think it was something I ate at that damn Greek's
to-night."</p>
<p>"I felt all right," said Jim Trivett. "A cup of coffee will
fix you up," he added with cheerful conviction.</p>
<p>They mounted the hill slowly. The light from winking
cornerlamps fell with a livid stare across the fronts of the
squalid houses.</p>
<p>"Jim," said Eugene, after a moment's pause.</p>
<p>"Yes. What is it?"</p>
<p>"Don't say anything about my getting sick," he said
awkwardly.</p>
<p>Surprised, Jim Trivett stared at him.</p>
<p>"Why not? There's nothing in that," he said. "Pshaw, boy, any
one's likely to get sick."</p>
<p>"Yes, I know. But I'd rather you wouldn't."</p>
<p>"Oh, all right. I won't. Why should I?" said Jim Trivett.</p>
<p>Eugene was haunted by his own lost ghost: he knew it to be
irrecoverable. For three days he avoided every one: the brand of
his sin, he felt, was on him. He was published by every gesture,
by every word. His manner grew more defiant, his greeting to life
more unfriendly. He clung more closely to Jim Trivett, drawing a
sad pleasure from his coarse loyal praise. His unappeased desire
began to burn anew: it conquered his bodily disgust and made new
pictures. At the end of the week he went again, alone, to Exeter,
No more of him, he felt, could be lost. This time he sought out
Thelma.</p>
<p>When he went home for Christmas, his loins were black with
vermin. The great body of the State lay like a barren giant below
the leaden reek of the skies. The train roared on across the vast
lift of the Piedmont: at night, as he lay in his berth, in a
diseased coma, it crawled up into the great fortress of the
hills. Dimly, he saw their wintry bulk, with its bleak foresting.
Below a trestle, silent as a dream, a white rope of water coiled
between its frozen banks. His sick heart lifted in the haunting
eternity of the hills. He was hillborn. But at dawn, as he came
from the cars with the band of returning students, his depression
revived. The huddle of cheap buildings at the station seemed
meaner and meaner than ever before. The hills, above the station
flats, with their cheap propped houses, had the unnatural
closeness of a vision. The silent Square seemed to have rushed
together during his absence, and as he left the car and descended
the street to Dixieland, it was as if he devoured toy-town
distances with a giant's stride.</p>
<p>The Christmas was gray and chill. Helen was not there to give
it warmth. Gant and Eliza felt the depression of her absence. Ben
came and went like a ghost. Luke was not coming home. And he
himself was sick with shame and loss.</p>
<p>He did not know where to turn. He paced his chill room at
night, muttering, until Eliza's troubled face appeared above her
wrapper. His father was gentler, older than he had ever seen him;
his pain had returned on him. He was absent and sorrowful. He
talked perfunctorily with his son about college. Speech choked in
Eugene's throat. He stammered a few answers and fled from the
house and the vacant fear in Gant's eyes. He walked prodigiously,
day and night, in an effort to command his own fear. He believed
himself to be rotting with a leprosy. And there was nothing to do
but rot. There was no cure. For such had been the instruction of
the moralists of his youth.</p>
<p>He walked with aimless desperation, unable to quiet for a
moment his restless limbs. He went up on the eastern hills that
rose behind Niggertown. A winter's sun labored through the mist.
Low on the meadows, and high on the hills, the sunlight lay on
the earth like milk.</p>
<p>He stood looking. A shaft of hope cut through the blackness of
his spirit. I will go to my brother, he thought.</p>
<p>He found Ben still in bed at Woodson Street, smoking. He
closed the door, then spun wildly about as if caged.</p>
<p>"In God's name!" Ben cried angrily. "Have you gone crazy?
What's wrong with you?"</p>
<p>"I'm&mdash;I'm sick!" he gasped.</p>
<p>"What's the matter? Where've you been?" asked Ben sharply. He
sat up in bed.</p>
<p>"I've been with a woman," said Eugene.</p>
<p>"Sit down, 'Gene," said Ben quietly, after a moment. "Don't be
a little idiot. You're not going to die, you know. When did this
happen?"</p>
<p>The boy blurted out his confession.</p>
<p>Ben got up and put on his clothes.</p>
<p>"Come on," said he, "we'll go to see McGuire."</p>
<p>As they walked townward, he tried to talk, explaining himself
in babbling incoherent spurts.</p>
<p>"It was like this," he began, "if I had known, but at that
time I didn't&mdash;of course I know it was my own fault
for&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Oh, for God's sake!" said Ben impatiently. "Dry up! I don't
want to hear about it. I'm not your damned Guardian Angel."</p>
<p>The news was comforting. So many people, after our fall from
grace, are.</p>
<p>They mounted to the wide dark corridor of the Doctors' and
Surgeons', with its sharp excitement of medical smells. McGuire's
anteroom was empty. Ben rapped at the inner door. McGuire opened
it: he pulled away the wet cigarette that was plastered on his
heavy lip, to greet them.</p>
<p>"Hello, Ben. Hello, son!" he barked, seeing Eugene. "When'd
you get back?"</p>
<p>"He thinks he's dying of galloping consumption, McGuire," said
Ben, with a jerk of the head. "You may be able to do something to
prolong his life."</p>
<p>"What's the matter, son?" said McGuire.</p>
<p>Eugene gulped dryly, craning his livid face.</p>
<p>"If you don't mind," he croaked. "See you alone." He turned
desperately upon his brother. "You stay here. Don't want you with
me."</p>
<p>"I don't want to go with you," said Ben surlily. "I've got
troubles enough of my own."</p>
<p>Eugene followed McGuire's burly figure into the office;
McGuire closed the door, and sat down heavily at his littered
desk.</p>
<p>"Sit down, son," he commanded, "and tell me about it." He lit
a cigarette and stuck it deftly on his sag wet lip. He glanced
keenly at the boy, noting his contorted face.</p>
<p>"Take your time, son," he said kindly, "and control yourself.
Whatever it is, it's probably not as bad as you think."</p>
<p>"It was this way," Eugene began in a low voice. "I've made a
mistake. I know that. I'm willing to take my medicine. I'm not
making any excuses for what has happened," his voice rose
sharply; he got half-way out of his chair, and began to pound
fiercely upon the untidy desk. "I'm putting the blame on no one.
Do you understand that?"</p>
<p>McGuire turned a bloated bewildered face slowly upon his
patient. His wet cigarette sagged comically from his half-opened
mouth.</p>
<p>"Do I understand what?" he said. "See here, 'Gene: what the
hell are you driving at? I'm no Sherlock Holmes, you know. I'm
your doctor. Spit it out."</p>
<p>"What I've done," he said dramatically, "thousands have done.
Oh, I know they may pretend not to. But they do! You're a
doctor&mdash;you know that. People high-up in society, too. I'm
one of the unlucky ones. I got caught. Why am I any worse than
they are? Why&mdash;" he continued rhetorically.</p>
<p>"I think I catch your drift," said McGuire dryly. "Let's have
a look, son."</p>
<p>Eugene obeyed feverishly, still declaiming.</p>
<p>"Why should I bear the stigma for what others get away with?
Hypocrites&mdash;a crowd of damned, dirty, whining hypocrites,
that's what they are. The Double-Standard! Hah! Where's the
justice, where's the honor of that? Why should I be blamed for
what people in High Society&mdash;"</p>
<p>McGuire lifted his big head from its critical stare, and
barked comically.</p>
<p>"Who's blaming you? You don't think you're the first one who
ever had this sort of trouble, do you? There's nothing wrong with
you, anyway."</p>
<p>"Can&mdash;can you cure me?" Eugene asked.</p>
<p>"No. You're incurable, son!" said McGuire. He scrawled a few
hieroglyphics on a prescription pad. "Give this to the druggist,"
he said, "and be a little more careful hereafter of the company
you keep. People in High Society, eh?" he grinned. "So that's
where you've been?"</p>
<p>The great weight of blood and tears had lifted completely out
of the boy's heart, leaving him dizzily buoyant, wild,
half-conscious only of his rushing words.</p>
<p>He opened the door and went into the outer room. Ben got up
quickly and nervously.</p>
<p>"Well," he said, "how much longer has he got to live?"
Seriously, in a low voice, he added: "There's nothing wrong with
him, is there?"</p>
<p>"No," said McGuire, "I think he's a little off his nut. But,
then, you all are."</p>
<p>When they came out on the street again, Ben said:</p>
<p>"Have you had anything to eat?"</p>
<p>"No," said Eugene.</p>
<p>"When did you eat last?"</p>
<p>"Some time yesterday," said Eugene. "I don't remember."</p>
<p>"You damned fool!" Ben muttered. "Come on&mdash;let's
eat."</p>
<p>The idea became very attractive. The world was washed
pleasantly in the milky winter sunshine. The town, under the
stimulus of the holidays and the returning students, had wakened
momentarily from its winter torpor: warm brisk currents of life
seethed over the pavements. He walked along at Ben's side with a
great bounding stride, unable to govern the expanding joy that
rose yeastily in him. Finally, as he turned in on the busy
avenue, he could restrain himself no longer: he leaped high in
the air, with a yelp of ecstasy:</p>
<p>"Squee-ee!"</p>
<p>"You little idiot!" Ben cried sharply. "Are you crazy!"</p>
<p>He scowled fiercely, then turned to the roaring passersby,
with a thin smile.</p>
<p>"Hang on to him, Ben!" yelled Jim Pollock. He was a deadly
little man, waxen and smiling under a black mustache, the chief
compositor, a Socialist.</p>
<p>"If you cut off his damned big feet," said Ben, "he'd go up
like a balloon."</p>
<p>They went into the big new lunch-room and sat at one of the
tables.</p>
<p>"What's yours?" said the waiter.</p>
<p>"A cup of coffee and a piece of mince pie," said Ben.</p>
<p>"I'll take the same," said Eugene.</p>
<p>"Eat!" said Ben fiercely. "Eat!"</p>
<p>Eugene studied the card thoughtfully.</p>
<p>"Bring me some veal cutlets breaded with tomato sauce," he
said, "with a side-order of hash-brown potatoes, a dish of
creamed carrots and peas, and a plate of hot biscuits. Also a cup
of coffee."</p>
<p>Eugene got back his heart again. He got it back fiercely and
carelessly, with an eldritch wildness. During the remainder of
his holiday, he plunged recklessly through the lively crowds,
looking boldly but without insolence at the women and young
girls. They grew unexpectedly out of the waste drear winter like
splendid flowers. He was eager and alone. Fear is a dragon that
lives among crowds&mdash;and in armies. It lives hardly with men
who are alone. He felt released&mdash;beyond the last hedge of
desperation.</p>
<p>Freed and alone, he looked with a boding detachment at all the
possessed and possessing world about him. Life hung for his
picking fingers like a strange and bitter fruit. THEY&mdash;the
great clan huddled there behind the stockade for warmth and
safety&mdash;could hunt him down some day and put him to death:
he thought they would.</p>
<p>But he was not now afraid&mdash;he was content, if only the
struggle might be fruitful. He looked among the crowds printed
with the mark of his danger, seeking that which he might desire
and take.</p>
<p>He went back to the university sealed up against the taunts of
the young men: in the hot green Pullman they pressed about him
with thronging jibe, but they fell back sharply, as fiercely he
met them, with constraint.</p>
<p>There came and sat beside him Tom French, his handsome face
vested in the hard insolence of money. He was followed by his
court jester, Roy Duncan, the slave with the high hard
cackle.</p>
<p>"Hello, Gant," said Tom French harshly. "Been to Exeter
lately?" Scowling, he winked at grinning Roy.</p>
<p>"Yes," said Eugene, "I've been there lately, and I'm on my way
there now. What's it to you, French?"</p>
<p>Discomfited by this hard defiance, the rich man's son drew
back.</p>
<p>"We hear you're stepping out among them, 'Gene," said Roy
Duncan, cackling.</p>
<p>"Who's we?" said Eugene. "Who's them?"</p>
<p>"They say," said Tom French, "that you're as pure as the
flowing sewer."</p>
<p>"If I need cleaning," said Eugene, "I can always use the Gold
Dust Twins, can't I? French and Duncan, the Gold Dust
Twins&mdash;who never do any work."</p>
<p>The cluster of grinning students, the young impartial brutes
who had gathered about them on the seats back and front, laughed
loudly.</p>
<p>"That's right! That's right! Talk to them, 'Gene!" said Zeno
Cochran, softly. He was a tall lad of twenty, slender and
powerful, with the grace of a running horse. He had punted
against the wind for eighty yards in the Yale Bowl. He was a
handsome fellow, soft-spoken and kindly, with the fearless
gentleness of the athlete.</p>
<p>Confused and angry, with sullen boastfulness, Tom French
said:</p>
<p>"Nobody has anything on me. I've been too slick for them.
Nobody knows anything about me."</p>
<p>"You mean," said Eugene, "that every one knows all about you,
and nobody wants to know anything about you."</p>
<p>The crowd laughed.</p>
<p>"Wow!" said Jimmy Revell.</p>
<p>"What about that, Tom?" he asked challengingly. He was very
small and plump, the son of a carpenter, offensively worthy,
working his way through college by various schemes. He was a
"kidder," an egger-on, finding excuse for his vulgarity and
malice in a false and loud good-humor.</p>
<p>Eugene turned quietly on Tom French. "Stop it!" he said.
"Don't go on because the others are listening. I don't think it's
funny. I don't like it. I don't like you. I want you to leave me
alone now. Do you hear?"</p>
<p>"Come on," said Roy Duncan, rising, "leave him alone, Tom. He
can't take a joke. He takes things too seriously."</p>
<p>They left him. Unperturbed, relieved, he turned his face
toward the vast bleak earth, gray and hoary in the iron grip of
winter.</p>
<p>Winter ended. The sleety frozen earth began to soften under
thaw and the rain. The town and campus paths were dreary trenches
of mud and slime. The cold rain fell: the grass shot up in green
wet patches. He hurtled down the campus lanes, bounding like a
kangaroo, leaping high at the lower boughs to clip a budding twig
with his teeth. He cried loudly in his throat&mdash;a whinnying
squeal&mdash;the centaur-cry of man or beast, trying to unburden
its overladen heart in one blast of pain and joy and passion. At
other times he slouched by, depressed by an unaccountable burden
of weariness and dejection.</p>
<p>He lost count of the hours&mdash;he had no sense of
time&mdash;no regular periods for sleep, work, or recreation,
although he attended his classes faithfully, and ate with fair
regularity by compulsion of dining-hall or boarding-house
schedules. The food was abundant, coarse, greasily and badly
cooked. It was very cheap: at the college commons, twelve dollars
a month; at the boarding-houses, fifteen. He ate at the commons
for a month: his interest in food was too profound and too
intelligent to stand it longer. The commons was housed in a large
bleak building of white brick. It was called officially Stiggins
Hall, but in the more descriptive epithet of the
students&mdash;The Sty.</p>
<p>He went to see Helen and Hugh Barton several times. They lived
thirty-five miles away at Sydney, the State capital. It was a
town of thirty thousand people, sleepy, with quiet leafy
pavements, and a capitol Square in the centre, with radial
streets. At the head of the main street, across from the capitol,
a brown weathered building of lichened stone, was a cheap
hotel&mdash;the largest and most notorious brothel in town. There
were also three denominational colleges for young women.</p>
<p>The Bartons had rented quarters in an old house on the street
above the Governor's Mansion. They lived in three or four rooms
on the ground floor.</p>
<p>It was to Sydney that Gant had come, a young man, from
Baltimore, on his slow drift to the South. It was in Sydney that
he had first started business for himself and conceived, from the
loss of his first investments, his hatred of property. It was in
Sydney that he had met and wedded the sainted Cynthia, the
tubercular spinstress who had died within two years of their
marriage.</p>
<p>Their father's great ghost haunted them: it brooded over the
town, above the scouring oblivion of the years that wipes all
trace of us away.</p>
<p>Together, they hunted down into the mean streets, until they
stood at length before a dreary shop on the skirts of the negro
district.</p>
<p>"This must be it," she said. "His shop stood here. It's gone
now."</p>
<p>She was silent a moment. "Poor old Papa." She turned her wet
eyes away.</p>
<p>There was no mark of his great hand on this bleak world. No
vines grew round the houses. That part of him which had lived
here was buried&mdash;buried with a dead woman below the long
gray tide of the years. They stood quietly, frightened, in that
strange place, waiting to hear the summons of his voice, with
expectant unbelief, as some one looking for the god in
Brooklyn.</p>
<p>In April the nation declared war on Germany. Before the month
was out, all the young men at Pulpit Hill who were
eligible&mdash;those who were twenty-one&mdash;were going into
service. At the gymnasium he watched the doctors examine them,
envying the careless innocence with which they stripped
themselves naked. They threw off their clothes in indifferent
heaps and stood, laughing and certain, before the doctors. They
were clean-limbed, sound and white of tooth, graceful and fast in
their movements. The fraternity men joined first&mdash;those
merry and extravagant snobs of whom he had never known, but who
now represented for him the highest reach of urbane and
aristocratic life. He had seen them, happy and idle, on the wide
verandas of their chapter houses&mdash;those temples where the
last and awful rites of initiation were administered. He had seen
them, always together, and from the herd of the uninitiated
always apart, laughing over their mail at the post-office, or
gambling for "black cows," at the drug-store. And, with a stab of
failure, with regret, with pain at his social deficiency, he had
watched their hot campaigns for the favor of some desirable
freshman&mdash;some one vastly more elegant than himself, some
one with blood and with money. They were only the sons of the
little rich men, the lords of the village and county, but as he
saw them go so surely, with such laughing unconstraint, in
well-cut clothes, well-groomed, well-brushed, among the crowd of
humbler students, who stiffened awkwardly with peasant hostility
and constraint,&mdash;they were the flower of chivalry, the sons
of the mansion-house. They were Sydney, Raleigh, Nash. And now,
like gentlemen, they were going to war.</p>
<p>The gymnasium was thick with the smell of steam and of
sweating men coming in to the showers from the playing fields.
Washed, with opened shirt, Eugene walked slowly away into the
green budding shade of the campus, companioned by an
acquaintance, Ralph Hendrix.</p>
<p>"Look!" said Ralph Hendrix, in a low angry tone. "Look at
that, will you!" He nodded toward a group of students ahead.
"That little Horse's Neck is booting the Dekes all over the
campus."</p>
<p>Eugene looked, then turned to examine the bitter common face
beside him. Every Saturday night, after the meeting of the
literary society, Ralph Hendrix went to the drug-store and bought
two cheap cigars. He had bent narrow shoulders, a white knobby
face, and a low forehead. He spoke in a monotonous painful drawl.
His father was foreman in a cotton mill.</p>
<p>"They're all Horse's Necks," he said. "They can go to hell
before I'll boot to get in."</p>
<p>"Yes," said Eugene.</p>
<p>But he wanted to get in. He wanted to be urbane and careless.
He wanted to wear well-cut clothes. He wanted to be a gentleman.
He wanted to go to war.</p>
<p>On the central campus, several students who had been approved
by the examining board, descended from the old dormitories,
bearing packed valises. They turned down under the trees, walking
toward the village street. From time to time they threw up an arm
in farewell.</p>
<p>"So long, boys! See you in Berlin." The shining and dividing
sea was closer and not so wide.</p>
<p>He read a great deal&mdash;but at random, for pleasure. He
read Defoe, Smollet, Stern, and Fielding&mdash;the fine salt of
the English novel lost, during the reign of the Widow of Windsor,
beneath an ocean of tea and molasses. He read the tales of
Boccaccio, and all that remained of a tattered copy of the
Heptameron. At Buck Benson's suggestion, he read Murray's
Euripides (at the time he was reading the Greek text of the
Alcestis&mdash;noblest and loveliest of all the myths of Love and
Death). He saw the grandeur of the Prometheus fable&mdash;but the
fable moved him more than the play of &AElig;schylus. In fact,
&AElig;schylus he found sublime&mdash;and dull: he could not
understand his great reputation. Rather&mdash;he could. He was
Literature&mdash;a writer of masterpieces. He was almost as great
a bore as Cicero&mdash;that windy old moralist who came out so
boldly in favor of Old Age and Friendship. Sophocles was an
imperial poet&mdash;he spoke like God among flashes of lightning:
the Oedipus Rex is not only one of the greatest plays in the
world, it is one of the greatest stories. This
story&mdash;perfect, inevitable, and fabulous&mdash;wreaked upon
him the nightmare coincidence of Destiny. It held him birdlike
before its great snake-eye of wisdom and horror. And Euripides
(whatever the disparagement of pedantry) he thought one of the
greatest lyrical singers in all poetry.</p>
<p>He liked all weird fable and wild invention, in prose or
verse, from the Golden Ass to Samuel Taylor Coleridge, the chief
prince of the moon and magic. But he liked the fabulous wherever
he found it, and for whatever purpose.</p>
<p>The best fabulists have often been the greatest satirists:
satire (as with Aristophanes, Voltaire, and Swift) is a high and
subtle art, quite beyond the barnyard snipings and wholesale
geese- slaughterings of the present degenerate age. Great satire
needs the sustenance of great fable. Swift's power of invention
is incomparable: there's no better fabulist in the world.</p>
<p>He read Poe's stories, Frankenstein, and the plays of Lord
Dunsany. He read Sir Gawayne and the Greene Knight and the Book
of Tobit. He did not want his ghosts and marvels explained. Magic
was magic. He wanted old ghosts&mdash;not Indian ghosts, but
ghosts in armor, the spirit of old kings, and pillioned ladies
with high coned hats. Then, for the first time, he thought of the
lonely earth he dwelt on. Suddenly, it was strange to him that he
should read Euripides there in the wilderness.</p>
<p>Around him lay the village; beyond, the ugly rolling land,
sparse with cheap farmhouses; beyond all this, America&mdash;more
land, more wooden houses, more towns, hard and raw and ugly. He
was reading Euripides, and all around him a world of white and
black was eating fried food. He was reading of ancient sorceries
and old ghosts, but did an old ghost ever come to haunt this
land? The ghost of Hamlet's Father, in Connecticut.</p>
<blockquote>"...... I am thy father's spirit,<br>
Doomed for a certain term to walk the night<br>
Between Bloomington and Portland, Maine."</blockquote>
<p>He felt suddenly the devastating impermanence of the nation.
Only the earth endured&mdash;the gigantic American earth, bearing
upon its awful breast a world of flimsy rickets. Only the earth
endured&mdash;this broad terrific earth that had no ghosts to
haunt it. Stogged in the desert, half-broken and overthrown,
among the columns of lost temples strewn, there was no ruined
image of Menkaura, there was no alabaster head of Akhnaton.
Nothing had been done in stone. Only this earth endured, upon
whose lonely breast he read Euripides. Within its hills he had
been held a prisoner; upon its plain he walked, alone, a
stranger.</p>
<p>O God! O God! We have been an exile in another land and a
stranger in our own. The mountains were our masters: they went
home to our eye and our heart before we came to five. Whatever we
can do or say must be forever hillbound. Our senses have been fed
by our terrific land; our blood has learned to run to the
imperial pulse of America which, leaving, we can never lose and
never forget. We walked along a road in Cumberland, and stooped,
because the sky hung down so low; and when we ran away from
London, we went by little rivers in a land just big enough. And
nowhere that we went was far: the earth and the sky were close
and near. And the old hunger returned&mdash;the terrible and
obscure hunger that haunts and hurts Americans, and that makes us
exiles at home and strangers wherever we go.</p>
<p>Eliza visited Helen in Sydney in the Spring. The girl was
quieter, sadder, more thoughtful than she had ever been. She was
subdued by the new life: chastened by her obscurity. She missed
Gant more than she would confess. She missed the mountain
town.</p>
<p>"What do you have to pay for this place?" said Eliza, looking
around critically.</p>
<p>"Fifty dollars a month," said Helen.</p>
<p>"Furnished?"</p>
<p>"No, we had to buy furniture."</p>
<p>"I tell you what, that's pretty high," said Eliza, "just for
down stairs. I believe rents are lower at home."</p>
<p>"Yes, I know it's high," said Helen. "But good heavens, mama!
Do you realize that this is the best neighborhood in town? We're
only two blocks from the Governor's Mansion, you know. Mrs.
Mathews is no common boarding-house keeper, I can assure you! No
sir!" she exclaimed, laughing. "She's a real swell&mdash;goes to
all the big functions and gets in the papers all the time. You
know Hugh and I have got to try to keep up appearances. He's a
young man just starting out here."</p>
<p>"Yes. I know," Eliza agreed thoughtfully. "How's he been
doing?"</p>
<p>"O'Toole says he's the best agent he's got," said Helen.
"Hugh's all right. We could get along together anywhere, as long
as there's no damned family about. It makes me furious at times
to see him slaving to feather O'Toole's pockets. He works like a
dog. You know, O'Toole gets a commission on every sale he makes.
And Mrs. O'T. and those two girls ride around in a big car and
never turn their hands over. They're Catholics, you know, but
they get to go everywhere."</p>
<p>"I tell you what," said Eliza with a timid half-serious smile,
"it might not be a bad idea if Hugh became his own boss. There's
no use doing it all for the other fellow. Say, child!" she
exclaimed, "why wouldn't it be a good idea if he tried to get the
Altamont agency? I don't believe that fellow they've got is much
account. He could get it without trying."</p>
<p>There was a pause.</p>
<p>"We've been thinking of that," the girl admitted slowly. "Hugh
has written in to the main office. Anyway," she said a moment
later, "he'd be his own boss. That's something."</p>
<p>"Well," said Eliza slowly, "I don't know but what it'd be a
good idea. If he works hard there's no reason why he shouldn't
build a good business up. Your papa's been complaining here
lately about his trouble. He'd be glad to have you back." She
shook her head slowly for a moment. "Child! they didn't do him a
bit of good, up there. It's all come back."</p>
<p>They drove over to Pulpit Hill at Easter for a two days'
visit. Eliza took him to Exeter and bought him a suit of
clothes.</p>
<p>"I don't like those skimpy trousers," she told the salesman.
"I want something that makes him look more of a man."</p>
<p>When he was newly dressed, she puckered her lips, smiling, and
said:</p>
<p>"Spruce up, boy! Throw your shoulders back! That's one thing
about your father&mdash;he carries himself straight as an arrow.
If you go all humped over like that, you'll have lung trouble
before you're twenty-five."</p>
<p>"I want you to meet my mother," he said awkwardly to Mr.
Joseph Ballantyne, a smooth pink young man who had been elected
president of the Freshman class.</p>
<p>"You're a good smart-looking fellow," said Eliza smiling,
"I'll make a trade with you. If you drum up some boarders for me
among your friends here in this part of the State, I'll throw in
your board free. Here are some of my cards," she added, opening
her purse. "You might hand a few of them out, if you get a
chance, and say a good word for Dixieland in the Land of the
Sky."</p>
<p>"Yes, ma'am," said Mr. Ballantyne, in a slow surprised voice,
"I certainly will."</p>
<p>Eugene turned a hot distressed face toward Helen. She laughed
huskily, ironically, then turning to the boy, said:</p>
<p>"You're welcome at any time, Mr. Ballantyne, boarders or not.
We'll always find a place for you."</p>
<p>When they were alone, in answer to his stammering and confused
protests, she said with an annoyed grin:</p>
<p>"Yes, I know. It's pretty bad. But you're away from it most of
the time. You're the lucky one. You see what I've had to listen
to, the last week, don't you? You see, don't you?"</p>
<p>When he went home at the end of the year, late in May, he
found that Helen and Hugh Barton had preceded him. They were
living with Gant, at Woodson Street. Hugh Barton had secured the
Altamont agency.</p>
<p>The town and the nation boiled with patriotic
frenzy&mdash;violent, in a chaotic sprawl, to little purpose. The
spawn of Attila must be crushed ("exterminated," said the
Reverend Mr. Smallwood) by the sons of freedom. There were loans,
bond issues, speech-making, a talk of drafts, and a thin trickle
of Yankees into France. Pershing arrived in Paris, and said,
"Lafayette, we are here!", but the French were still looking. Ben
went up before the enlistment board and was rejected.
"Lungs&mdash;weak!" they said quite definitely. "No&mdash;not
tubercular. A tendency. Underweight." He cursed. His face was a
little more like a blade&mdash;thinner, grayer. The cleft of his
scowl was deeper. He seemed more alone.</p>
<p>Eugene came up into the hills again and found them in their
rich young summer glory. Dixieland was partly filled by paying
guests. More arrived.</p>
<p>Eugene was sixteen years old. He was a College Man. He walked
among the gay crowd of afternoon with a sense of elation,
answering the hearty greetings with joy, warming to its
thoughtless bombast.</p>
<p>"They tell me you're batting a thousand down there, son,"
yelled Mr. Wood, the plump young pharmacist, who had been told
nothing at all. "That's right, boy! Go get 'em." The man passed
forward cheerfully, up the prosperous glade of his store. Fans
droned.</p>
<p>After all, Eugene thought, he had not done so badly. He had
felt his first wounds. He had not been broken. He had seen love's
bitter mystery. He had lived alone.</p>
<h3>30</h3>
<p>There was at Dixieland a girl named Laura James. She was
twenty- one years old. She looked younger. She was there when he
came back.</p>
<p>Laura was a slender girl, of medium height, but looking taller
than she was. She was very firmly moulded: she seemed fresh and
washed and clean. She had thick hair, very straight and blonde,
combed in a flat bracelet around her small head. Her face was
white, with small freckles. Her eyes were soft, candid,
cat-green. He nose was a little too large for her face: it was
tilted. She was not pretty. She dressed very simply and elegantly
in short plaid skirts and waists of knitted silk.</p>
<p>She was the only young person at Dixieland. Eugene spoke to
her with timid hauteur. He thought her plain and dull. But he
began to sit with her on the porch at night. Somehow, he began to
love her.</p>
<p>He did not know that he loved her. He talked to her arrogantly
and boastfully as they sat in the wooden porch-swing. But he
breathed the clean perfume of her marvellous young body. He was
trapped in the tender cruelty of her clear green eyes, caught in
the subtle net of her smile.</p>
<p>Laura James lived in the eastern part of the State, far east
even of Pulpit Hill, in a little town built on a salt river of
the great coastal plain. Her father was a wealthy
merchant&mdash;a wholesale provisioner. The girl was an only
child: she spent extravagantly.</p>
<p>Eugene sat on the porch rail one evening and talked to her.
Before, he had only nodded, or spoken stiffly a word or two. They
began haltingly, aware painfully of gaps in their
conversation.</p>
<p>"You're from Little Richmond, aren't you?" he said.</p>
<p>"Yes," said Laura James, "do you know any one from there?"</p>
<p>"Yes," said he, "I know John Bynum and a boy named Ficklen.
They're from Little Richmond, aren't they?"</p>
<p>"Oh, Dave Ficklen! Do you know him? Yes. They both go to
Pulpit Hill. Do you go there?"</p>
<p>"Yes," he said, "that's where I knew them."</p>
<p>"Do you know the two Barlow boys? They're Sigma Nus," said
Laura James.</p>
<p>He had seen them. They were great swells, football men.</p>
<p>"Yes, I know them," he said, "Roy Barlow and Jack Barlow."</p>
<p>"Do you know 'Snooks' Warren? He's a Kappa Sig."</p>
<p>"Yes. They call them Keg Squeezers," said Eugene.</p>
<p>"What fraternity are you?" said Laura James.</p>
<p>"I'm not any," he said painfully. "I was just a Freshman this
year."</p>
<p>"Some of the best friends I have never joined fraternities,"
said Laura James.</p>
<p>They met more and more frequently, without arrangement, until
by silent consent they met every night upon the porch. Sometimes
they walked along the cool dark streets. Sometimes he squired her
clumsily through the town, to the movies, and later, with the
uneasy pugnacity of youth, past the loafing cluster at Wood's.
Often he took her to Woodson Street, where Helen secured for him
the cool privacy of the veranda. She was very fond of Laura
James.</p>
<p>"She's a nice girl. A lovely girl. I like her. She's not going
to take any beauty prizes, is she?" She laughed with a trace of
good-natured ridicule.</p>
<p>He was displeased.</p>
<p>"She looks all right," he said. "She's not as ugly as you make
out."</p>
<p>But she WAS ugly&mdash;with a clean lovely ugliness. Her face
was freckled lightly, over her nose and mouth: her features were
eager, unconscious, turned upward in irregular pertness. But she
was exquisitely made and exquisitely kept: she had the firm young
line of Spring, budding, slender, virginal. She was like
something swift, with wings, which hovers in a wood&mdash;among
the feathery trees suspected, but uncaught, unseen.</p>
<p>He tried to live before her in armor. He showed off before
her. Perhaps, he thought, if he were splendid enough, she would
not see the ugly disorder and meanness of the world he dwelt
in.</p>
<p>Across the street, on the wide lawn of the Brunswick&mdash;the
big brick gabled house that Eliza once had coveted&mdash;Mr.
Pratt, who crawled in that mean world in which only a
boarding-house husband can exist, was watering wide green spaces
of lawn with a hose. The flashing water motes gleamed in the red
glare of sunset. The red light fell across the shaven pinched
face. It glittered on the buckles of his arm-bands. Across the
walk, on the other lobe of grass, several men and women were
playing croquet. There was laughter on the vine-hid porch. Next
door, at the Belton, the boarders were assembled on the long
porch in bright hashhouse chatter. The comedian of the Dixie
Ramblers arrived with two chorus girls. He was a little man, with
the face of a weasel and no upper teeth. He wore a straw hat with
a striped band, and a blue shirt and collar. The boarders
gathered in around him. In a moment there was shrill
laughter.</p>
<p>Julius Arthur sped swiftly down the hill, driving his father
home. He grinned squintily and flung his arm up in careless
greeting. The prosperous lawyer twisted a plump Van Dyked face on
a wry neck curiously. Unsmiling, he passed.</p>
<p>A negress in the Brunswick struck on the several bells of a
Japanese gong. There was a scramble of feet on the porch; the
croquet players dropped their mallets and walked rapidly toward
the house. Pratt wound his hose over a wooden reel.</p>
<p>A slow bell-clapper in the Belton sent the guests in a
scrambling drive for the doors. In a moment there was a clatter
of heavy plates and a loud foody noise. The guests on the porch
at Dixieland rocked more rapidly, with low mutters of
discontent.</p>
<p>Eugene talked to Laura in thickening dusk, sheeting his pain
in pride and indifference. Eliza's face, a white blur in the
dark, came up behind the screen.</p>
<p>"Come on out, Mrs. Gant, and get a breath of fresh air," said
Laura James.</p>
<p>"Why no-o, child. I can't now. Who's that with you?" she
cried, obviously flustered. She opened the door. "Huh? Heh? Have
you seen 'Gene? Is it 'Gene?"</p>
<p>"Yes," he said. "What's the matter?"</p>
<p>"Come here a minute, boy," she said.</p>
<p>He went into the hall.</p>
<p>"What is it?" he asked.</p>
<p>"Why, son, what in the world! I don't know. You'll have to do
something," she whispered, twisting her hands together.</p>
<p>"What is it, mama? What are you talking about?" he cried
irritably.</p>
<p>"Why&mdash;Jannadeau's just called up. Your papa's on a
rampage again and he's coming this way. Child! There's no telling
what he'll do. I've all these people in the house. He'll ruin
us." She wept. "Go and try to stop him. Head him off if you can.
Take him to Woodson Street."</p>
<p>He got his hat quickly and ran through the door.</p>
<p>"Where are you going?" asked Laura James. "Are you going off
without supper?"</p>
<p>"I've got to go to town," he said. "I won't be long. Will you
wait for me?"</p>
<p>"Yes," she said.</p>
<p>He leaped down on the walk just as his father lurched in from
the street by the high obscuring hedge that shut the house from
the spacious yard of the attorney Hall. Gant reeled
destructively, across a border of lilies, on to the lawn, and
strode for the veranda. He stumbled, cursing, on the bottom step
and plunged forward in a sprawl upon the porch. The boy jumped
for him, and half dragged, half lifted his great drunken body
erect. The boarders shrank into a huddle with a quick scattering
of chairs: he greeted them with a laugh of howling contempt.</p>
<p>"Are you there? I say, are you there? The lowest of the
low&mdash;boarding-house swine! Merciful God! What a travesty! A
travesty on Nature! That it should come to this!"</p>
<p>He burst into a long peal of maniacal laughter.</p>
<p>"Papa! Come on!" said Eugene in a low voice. He took his
father cautiously by the sleeve. Gant flung him half across the
porch with a gesture of his hand. As he stepped in again swiftly,
his father struck at him with a flailing arm. He evaded the great
mowing fist without trouble, and caught the falling body, swung
from its own pivot, in his arms. Then quickly, before Gant could
recover, holding him from behind, he rushed him toward the door.
The boarders scattered away like sparrows. But Laura James was at
the screen before him: she flung it open.</p>
<p>"Get away! Get away!" he cried, full of shame and anger. "You
stay out of this." For a moment he despised her for seeing his
hurt.</p>
<p>"Oh, let me help you, my dear," Laura James whispered. Her
eyes were wet, but she was not afraid.</p>
<p>Father and son plunged chaotically down the wide dark hall,
Eliza, weeping and making gestures, just before them.</p>
<p>"Take him in here, boy. Take him in here," she whispered,
motioning to a large bed-room on the upper side of the house.
Eugene propelled his father through a blind passage of bath room,
and pushed him over on the creaking width of an iron bed.</p>
<p>"You damned scoundrel!" Gant yelled, again trying to reap him
down with the long arm, "let me up or I'll kill you!"</p>
<p>"For God's sake, papa," he implored angrily, "try to quiet
down. Every one in town can hear you."</p>
<p>"To hell with them!" Gant roared. "Mountain Grills&mdash;all
of them, fattening upon my heart's-blood. They have done me to
death, as sure as there's a God in heaven."</p>
<p>Eliza appeared in the door, her face contorted by weeping.</p>
<p>"Son, can't you do something to stop him?" she said. "He'll
ruin us all. He'll drive every one away."</p>
<p>Gant struggled to stand erect when he saw her. Her white face
stirred him to insanity.</p>
<p>"There it is! There! There! Do you see! The fiend-face I know
so well, gloating upon my misery. Look at it! Look! Do you see
its smile of evil cunning? Greeley, Will, The Hog, The Old Major!
The Tax Collector will get it all, and I shall die in the
gutter!"</p>
<p>"If it hadn't been for me," Eliza began, stung to retaliation,
"you'd have died there long ago."</p>
<p>"Mama, for God's sake!" the boy cried. "Don't stand there
talking to him! Can't you see what it does to him! Do something,
in heaven's name! Get Helen! Where is she?"</p>
<p>"I'll make an end to it all!" Gant yelled, staggering erect.
"I'll do for us both now."</p>
<p>Eliza vanished.</p>
<p>"Yes, sir, papa. It's going to be all right," Eugene began
soothingly, pushing him back on the bed again. He dropped quickly
to his knees, and began to draw off one of Gant's soft tongueless
shoes, muttering reassurances all the time: "Yes, sir. We'll get
you some good hot soup and put you to bed in a jiffy.
Everything's going to be all right," the shoe came off in his
hand and, aided by the furious thrust of his father's foot, he
went sprawling back.</p>
<p>Gant got to his feet again and, taking a farewell kick at his
fallen son, lunged toward the door. Eugene scrambled up quickly,
and leaped after him. The two men fell heavily into the roughly
grained plaster of the wall. Gant cursed, flailing about clumsily
at his tormentor. Helen came in.</p>
<p>"Baby!" Gant wept, "they're trying to kill me. O Jesus, do
something to save me, or I perish."</p>
<p>"You get back in that bed," she commanded sharply, "or I'll
knock your head off."</p>
<p>Very obediently he suffered himself to be led back to bed and
undressed. In a few minutes she was sitting beside him with a
bowl of smoking soup. He grinned sheepishly as she spooned it
into his opened mouth. She laughed&mdash;almost
happily&mdash;thinking of the lost and irrevocable years.
Suddenly, before he slept, he lifted himself strongly from the
pillows that propped him, and with staring eyes, called out in
savage terror:</p>
<p>"Is it a cancer? I say, is it a cancer?"</p>
<p>"Hush!" she cried. "No. Of course not! Don't be foolish."</p>
<p>He fell back exhausted, with eyes closed. But they knew that
it was. He had never been told. The terrible name of his malady
was never uttered save by him. And in his heart he
knew&mdash;what they all knew and never spoke of before
him&mdash;that it was, it was a cancer. All day, with fear-stark
eyes, Gant had sat, like a broken statue, among his marbles,
drinking. It was a cancer.</p>
<p>The boy's right hand bled very badly across the wrist, where
his father's weight had ground it into the wall.</p>
<p>"Go wash it off," said Helen. "I'll tie it up for you."</p>
<p>He went into the dark bathroom and held his hand under a jet
of lukewarm water. A very quiet despair was in his heart, a weary
peace that brooded too upon the house of death and tumult, that
flowed, like a soft exploring wind, through its dark halls,
bathing all things quietly with peace and weariness. The boarders
had fled like silly sheep to the two houses across the street:
they had eaten there, they were clustered there upon the porches,
whispering. And their going brought him peace and freedom, as if
his limbs had been freed from a shackling weight. Eliza, amid the
slow smoke of the kitchen, wept more quietly over the waste of
supper; he saw the black mournful calm of the negress's face. He
walked slowly up the dark hall, with a handkerchief tied loosely
round his wound. He felt suddenly the peace that comes with
despair. The sword that pierces very deep had fared through the
folds of his poor armor of pride. The steel had sheared his side,
had bitten to his heart. But under his armor he had found
himself. No more than himself could be known. No more than
himself could be given. What he was&mdash;he was: evasion and
pretense could not add to his sum. With all his heart he was
glad.</p>
<p>By the door, in the darkness, he found Laura James.</p>
<p>"I thought you had gone with the others," he said.</p>
<p>"No," said Laura James, "how is your father?"</p>
<p>"He's all right now. He's gone to sleep," he answered. "Have
you had anything to eat?"</p>
<p>"No," she said, "I didn't want it."</p>
<p>"I'll bring you something from the kitchen," he said. "There's
plenty there." In a moment he added: "I'm sorry, Laura."</p>
<p>"What are you sorry for?" she asked.</p>
<p>He leaned against the wall limply, drained of his strength at
her touch.</p>
<p>"Eugene. My dear," she said. She pulled his drooping face down
to her lips and kissed him. "My sweet, my darling, don't look
like that."</p>
<p>All his resistance melted from him. He seized her small hands,
crushing them in his hot fingers, and devouring them with
kisses.</p>
<p>"My dear Laura! My dear Laura!" he said in a choking voice.
"My sweet, my beautiful Laura! My lovely Laura. I love you. I
love you." The words rushed from his heart, incoherent,
unashamed, foaming through the broken levees of pride and
silence. They clung together in the dark, with their wet faces
pressed mouth to mouth. Her perfume went drunkenly to his brain;
her touch upon him shot through his limbs a glow of magic; he
felt the pressure of her narrow breasts, eager and lithe, against
him with a sense of fear&mdash;as if he had dishonored
her&mdash;with a sickening remembrance of his defilement.</p>
<p>He held between his hands her elegant small head, so
gloriously wound with its thick bracelet of fine blonde hair, and
spoke the words he had never spoken&mdash;the words of
confession, filled with love and humility.</p>
<p>"Don't go! Don't go! Please don't go!" he begged. "Don't
leave, dear. Please!"</p>
<p>"Hush!" she whispered. "I won't go! I love you, my dear."</p>
<p>She saw his hand, wrapped in its bloody bandage; she nursed it
gently with soft little cries of tenderness. She fetched a bottle
of iodine from her room and painted the stinging cut with a
brush. She wrapped it with clean strips of fine white cloth, torn
from an old waist, scented with a faint and subtle perfume.</p>
<p>Then they sat upon the wooden swing. The house seemed to sleep
in darkness. Helen and Eliza came presently from its very quiet
depth.</p>
<p>"How's your hand, 'Gene?" Helen asked.</p>
<p>"It's all right," he said.</p>
<p>"Let me see! O-ho, you've got a nurse now, haven't you?" she
said, with a good laugh.</p>
<p>"What's that? What's that? Hurt his hand? How'd you do that?
Why, here&mdash;say&mdash;I've got the very thing for it, son,"
said Eliza, trying to bustle off in all directions.</p>
<p>"Oh, it's all right now, mama. It's been fixed," he said
wearily, reflecting that she had the very thing always too late.
He looked at Helen grinning:</p>
<p>"God bless our Happy Home!" he said.</p>
<p>"Poor old Laura!" she laughed, and hugged the girl roughly
with one hand. "It's too bad you have to be dragged into it."</p>
<p>"That's all right," said Laura. "I feel like one of the family
now anyhow."</p>
<p>"He needn't think he can carry on like this," said Eliza
resentfully. "I'm not going to put up with it any longer."</p>
<p>"Oh forget about it!" said Helen wearily. "Good heavens, mama.
Papa's a sick man. Can't you realize that?"</p>
<p>"Pshaw!" said Eliza scornfully. "I don't believe there's a
thing in the world wrong with him but that vile licker. All his
trouble comes from that."</p>
<p>"Oh&mdash;how ridiculous! How ridiculous! You can't tell me!"
Helen exclaimed angrily.</p>
<p>"Let's talk about the weather," said Eugene.</p>
<p>Then they all sat quietly, letting the darkness soak into
them. Finally Helen and Eliza went back into the house: Eliza
went unwillingly, at the girl's insistence, casting back the
doubtful glimmer of her face upon the boy and girl.</p>
<p>The wasting helve of the moon rode into heaven over the bulk
of the hills. There was a smell of wet grass and lilac, and the
vast brooding symphony of the million-noted little night things,
rising and falling in a constant ululation, and inhabiting the
heart with steady unconscious certitude. The pallid light drowned
out the stars, it lay like silence on the earth, it dripped
through the leafy web of the young maples, printing the earth
with swarming moths of elvish light.</p>
<p>Eugene and Laura sat with joined hands in the slowly creaking
swing. Her touch shot through him like a train of fire: as he put
his arm around her shoulders and drew her over to him, his
fingers touched the live firm cup of her breast. He jerked his
hand away, as if he had been stung, muttering an apology.
Whenever she touched him, his flesh got numb and weak. She was a
virgin, crisp like celery&mdash;his heart shrank away from the
pollution of his touch upon her. It seemed to him that he was
much the older, although he was sixteen, and she twenty-one. He
felt the age of his loneliness and his dark perception. He felt
the gray wisdom of sin&mdash;a waste desert, but seen and known.
When he held her hand, he felt as if he had already seduced her.
She lifted her lovely face to him, pert and ugly as a boy's; it
was inhabited by a true and steadfast decency, and his eyes were
wet. All the young beauty in the world dwelt for him in that face
that had kept wonder, that had kept innocency, that had lived in
such immortal blindness to the terror and foulness of the world.
He came to her, like a creature who had travelled its life
through dark space, for a moment of peace and conviction on some
lonely planet, where now he stood, in the vast enchanted plain of
moonlight, with moonlight falling on the moonflower of her face.
For if a man should dream of heaven and, waking, find within his
hand a flower as token that he had really been there&mdash;what
then, what then?</p>
<p>"Eugene," she said presently, "how old are you?"</p>
<p>His vision thickened with his pulse. In a moment he answered
with terrible difficulty.</p>
<p>"I'm&mdash;just sixteen."</p>
<p>"Oh, you child!" she cried. "I thought you were more than
that!"</p>
<p>"I'm&mdash;old for my age," he muttered. "How old are
you?"</p>
<p>"I'm twenty-one," she said. "Isn't it a pity?"</p>
<p>"There's not much difference," he said. "I can't see that it
matters."</p>
<p>"Oh, my dear," she said. "It does! It matters so much!"</p>
<p>And he knew that it did&mdash;how much he did not know. But he
had his moment. He was not afraid of pain, he was not afraid of
loss. He cared nothing for the practical need of the world. He
dared to say the strange and marvellous thing that had bloomed so
darkly in him.</p>
<p>"Laura," he said, hearing his low voice sound over the great
plain of the moon, "let's always love each other as we do now.
Let's never get married. I want you to wait for me and to love me
forever. I am going all over the world. I shall go away for years
at a time; I shall become famous, but I shall always come back to
you. You shall live in a house away in the mountains, you shall
wait for me, and keep yourself for me. Will you?" he said, asking
for her life as calmly as for an hour of her time.</p>
<p>"Yes, dear," said Laura in the moonlight, "I will wait for you
forever."</p>
<p>She was buried in his flesh. She throbbed in the beat of his
pulses. She was wine in his blood, a music in his heart.</p>
<p>"He has no consideration for you or any one else," Hugh Barton
growled. He had returned late from work at his office, to take
Helen home. "If he can't do better than this, we'll find a house
of our own. I'm not going to have you get down sick on account of
him."</p>
<p>"Forget about it," Helen said. "He's getting old."</p>
<p>They came out on the veranda.</p>
<p>"Come down to-morrow, honey," she said to Eugene. "I'll give
you a real feed. Laura, you come too. It's not always like this,
you know." She laughed, fondling the girl with a big hand.</p>
<p>They coasted away downhill.</p>
<p>"What a lovely girl your sister is," said Laura James. "Aren't
you simply crazy about her?"</p>
<p>Eugene made no answer for a moment.</p>
<p>"Yes," he said.</p>
<p>"She is about you. Any one can see that," said Laura.</p>
<p>In the darkness he caught at his throat.</p>
<p>"Yes," he said.</p>
<p>The moon quartered gently across heaven. Eliza came out again,
timidly, hesitantly.</p>
<p>"Who's there? Who's there?" she spoke into the darkness.
"Where's 'Gene? Oh! I didn't know! Are you there, son?" She knew
very well.</p>
<p>"Yes," he said.</p>
<p>"Why don't you sit down, Mrs. Gant?" asked Laura. "I don't see
how you stand that hot kitchen all day long. You must be worn
out."</p>
<p>"I tell you what!" said Eliza, peering dimly at the sky. "It's
a fine night, isn't it? As the fellow says, a night for lovers."
She laughed uncertainly, then stood for a moment in thought.</p>
<p>"Son," she said in a troubled voice, "why don't you go to bed
and get some sleep? It's not good for you staying up till all
hours like this."</p>
<p>"That's where I should be," said Laura James, rising.</p>
<p>"Yes, child," said Eliza. "Go get your beauty sleep. As the
saying goes, early to bed and early to rise&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Let's all go, then. Let's all go!" said Eugene impatiently
and angrily, wondering if she must always be the last one awake
in that house.</p>
<p>"Why law, no!" said Eliza. "I can't, boy. I've all those
things to iron."</p>
<p>Beside him, Laura gave his hand a quiet squeeze, and rose.
Bitterly, he watched his loss.</p>
<p>"Good-night, all. Good-night, Mrs. Gant."</p>
<p>"Good-night, child."</p>
<p>When she had gone, Eliza sat down beside him, with a sigh of
weariness.</p>
<p>"I tell you what," she said. "That feels good. I wish I had as
much time as some folks, and could sit out here enjoying the
air." In the darkness, he knew her puckering lips were trying to
smile.</p>
<p>"Hm!" she said, and caught his hand in her rough palm. "Has my
baby gone and got him a girl?"</p>
<p>"What of it? What if it were true?" he said angrily. "Haven't
I a right as much as any one?"</p>
<p>"Pshaw!" said Eliza. "You're too young to think of them. I
wouldn't pay any attention to them, if I were you. Most of them
haven't an idea in the world except going out to parties and
having a good time. I don't want my boy to waste his time on
them."</p>
<p>He felt her earnestness beneath her awkward banter. He
struggled in a chaos of confused fury, trying for silence. At
last he spoke in a low voice, filled with his passion:</p>
<p>"We've got to have something, mama. We've got to have
something, you know. We can't go on always
alone&mdash;alone."</p>
<p>It was dark. No one could see. He let the gates swing open. He
wept.</p>
<p>"I know!" Eliza agreed hastily. "I'm not saying&mdash;"</p>
<p>"My God, my God, where are we going? What's it all about? He's
dying&mdash;can't you see it? Don't you know it? Look at his
life. Look at yours. No light, no love, no
comfort&mdash;nothing." His voice rose frantically: he beat on
his ribs like a drum. "Mama, mama, in God's name, what is it?
What do you want? Are you going to strangle and drown us all?
Don't you own enough? Do you want more string? Do you want more
bottles? By God, I'll go around collecting them if you say so."
His voice had risen almost to a scream. "But tell me what you
want. Don't you own enough? Do you want the town? What is
it?"</p>
<p>"Why, I don't know what you're talking about, boy," said Eliza
angrily. "If I hadn't tried to accumulate a little property none
of you would have had a roof to call your own, for your papa, I
can assure you, would have squandered everything."</p>
<p>"A roof to call our own!" he yelled, with a crazy laugh. "Good
God, we haven't a bed to call our own. We haven't a room to call
our own. We have not a quilt to call our own that might not be
taken from us to warm the mob that rocks upon this porch and
grumbles."</p>
<p>"Now, you may sneer at the boarders all you like&mdash;" Eliza
began sternly.</p>
<p>"No," he said. "I can't. There's not breath or strength enough
in me to sneer at them all I like."</p>
<p>Eliza began to weep.</p>
<p>"I've done the best I could!" she said. "I'd have given you a
home if I could. I'd have put up with anything after Grover's
death, but he never gave me a moment's peace. Nobody knows what
I've been through. Nobody knows, child. Nobody knows."</p>
<p>He saw her face in the moonlight, contorted by an ugly grimace
of sorrow. What she had said, he knew, was fair and honest. He
was touched deeply.</p>
<p>"It's all right, mama," he said painfully. "Forget about it! I
know."</p>
<p>She seized his hand almost gratefully and laid her white face,
still twisted with her grief, against his shoulder. It was the
gesture of a child; a gesture that asked for love, pity, and
tenderness. It tore up great roots in him, bloodily.</p>
<p>"Don't!" he said. "Don't, mama! Please!"</p>
<p>"Nobody knows," said Eliza. "Nobody knows. I need some one
too. I've had a hard life, son, full of pain and trouble."
Slowly, like a child again, she wiped her wet weak eyes with the
back of her hand.</p>
<p>Ah, he thought, as his heart twisted in him full of wild pain
and regret, she will be dead some day and I shall always remember
this. Always this. This.</p>
<p>They were silent a moment. He held her rough hand tightly, and
kissed her.</p>
<p>"Well," Eliza began, full of cheerful prophecy, "I tell you
what: I'm not going to spend my life slaving away here for a lot
of boarders. They needn't think it. I'm going to set back and
take things as easy as any of them." She winked knowingly at him.
"When you come home next time, you may find me living in a big
house in Doak Park. I've got the lot&mdash;the best lot out there
for view and location, far better than the one W. J. Bryan has. I
made the trade with old Dr. Doak himself, the other day. Look
here! What about!" She laughed. "He said, 'Mrs. Gant, I can't
trust any of my agents with you. If I'm to make anything on this
deal, I've got to look out. You're the sharpest trader in this
town.' 'Why, pshaw! Doctor,' I said (I never let on I believed
him or anything), 'all I want is a fair return on my investment.
I believe in every one making his profit and giving the other
fellow a chance. Keep the ball a-rolling!' I said, laughing as
big as you please. 'Why, Mrs. Gant!' he said&mdash;" She was off
on a lengthy divagation, recording with an absorbed gusto the
interminable minutia of her transaction with the worthy Quinine
King, with the attendant phenomena, during the time, of birds,
bees, flowers, sun, clouds, dogs, cows, and people. She was
pleased. She was happy.</p>
<p>Presently, returning to an abrupt reflective pause, she said:
"Well, I may do it. I want a place where my children can come to
see me and bring their friends, when they come home."</p>
<p>"Yes," he said, "yes. That would be nice. You mustn't work all
your life."</p>
<p>He was pleased at her happy fable: for a moment he almost
believed in a miracle of redemption, although the story was an
old one to him.</p>
<p>"I hope you do," he said. "It would be nice....Go on to bed
now, why don't you, mama? It's getting late." He rose. "I'm going
now."</p>
<p>"Yes, son," she said, getting up. "You ought to. Well, good-
night." They kissed with a love, for the time, washed clean of
bitterness. Eliza went before him into the dark house.</p>
<p>But before he went to bed, he descended to the kitchen for
matches. She was still there, beyond the long littered table, at
her ironing board, flanked by two big piles of laundry. At his
accusing glance she said hastily:</p>
<p>"I'm a-going. Right away. I just wanted to finish up these
towels."</p>
<p>He rounded the table, before he left, to kiss her again. She
fished into a button-box on the sewing-machine and dug out the
stub of a pencil. Gripping it firmly above an old envelope, she
scrawled out on the ironing board a rough mapping. Her mind was
still lulled in its project.</p>
<p>"Here, you see," she began, "is Sunset Avenue, coming up the
hill. This is Doak Place, running off here at right angles. Now
this corner-lot here belongs to Dick Webster; and right here
above it, at the very top is&mdash;"</p>
<p>Is, he thought, staring with dull interest, the place where
the Buried Treasure lies. Ten paces N.N.E. from the Big Rock, at
the roots of the Old Oak Tree. He went off into his delightful
fantasy while she talked. What if there WAS a buried treasure on
one of Eliza's lots? If she kept on buying, there might very well
be. Or why not an oil-well? Or a coal-mine? These famous
mountains were full (they said) of minerals. 150 Bbl. a day right
in the backyard. How much would that be? At $3.00 a Bbl., there
would be over $50.00 a day for every one in the family. The world
is ours!</p>
<p>"You see, don't you?" she smiled triumphantly. "And right
there is where I shall build. That lot will bring twice its
present value in five years."</p>
<p>"Yes," he said, kissing her. "Good-night, mama. For God's
sake, go to bed and get some sleep."</p>
<p>"Good-night, son," said Eliza.</p>
<p>He went out and began to mount the dark stairs. Benjamin Gant,
entering at this moment, stumbled across a mission-chair in the
hall. He cursed fiercely, and struck at the chair with his hand.
Damn it! Oh damn it! Mrs. Pert whispered a warning behind him,
with a fuzzy laugh. Eugene paused, then mounted softly the
carpeted stair, so that he would not be heard, entering the
sleeping-porch at the top of the landing on which he slept.</p>
<p>He did not turn on the light, because he disliked seeing the
raw blistered varnish of the dresser and the bent white iron of
the bed. It sagged, and the light was dim&mdash;he hated dim
lights, and the large moths, flapping blindly around on their
dusty wings. He undressed in the moon. The moonlight fell upon
the earth like a magic unearthly dawn. It wiped away all rawness,
it hid all sores. It gave all common and familiar
things&mdash;the sagging drift of the barn, the raw shed of the
creamery, the rich curve of the lawyer's crab-apple trees&mdash;a
uniform bloom of wonder. He lighted a cigarette, watching its red
glowing suspiration in the mirror, and leaned upon the rail of
his porch, looking out. Presently, he grew aware that Laura
James, eight feet away, was watching him. The moonlight fell upon
them, bathing their flesh in a green pallor, and steeping them in
its silence. Their faces were blocked in miraculous darkness, out
of which, seeing but unseen, their bright eyes lived. They gazed
at each other in that elfin light, without speaking. In the room
below them, the light crawled to his father's bed, swam up the
cover, and opened across his face, thrust sharply upward. The air
of the night, the air of the hills, fell on the boy's bare flesh
like a sluice of clear water. His toes curled in to grip wet
grasses.</p>
<p>On the landing, he heard Mrs. Pert go softly up to bed,
fumbling with blind care at the walls. Doors creaked and clicked.
The house grew solidly into quiet, like a stone beneath the moon.
They looked, waiting for a spell and the conquest of time. Then
she spoke to him&mdash;her whisper of his name was only a guess
at sound. He threw his leg across the rail, and thrust his long
body over space to the sill of her window, stretching out like a
cat. She drew her breath in sharply, and cried out softly, "No!
No!" but she caught his arms upon the sills and held him as he
twisted in.</p>
<p>Then they held each other tightly in their cool young arms,
and kissed many times with young lips and faces. All her hair
fell down about her like thick corn-silk, in a sweet loose
wantonness. Her straight dainty legs were clad in snug little
green bloomers, gathered in by an elastic above the knee.</p>
<p>They were locked limb to limb: he kissed the smooth sheen of
her arms and shoulders&mdash;the passion that numbed his limbs
was governed by a religious ecstasy. He wanted to hold her, and
go away by himself to think about her.</p>
<p>He stooped, thrusting his arm under her knees, and lifted her
up exultantly. She looked at him frightened, holding him more
tightly.</p>
<p>"What are you doing?" she whispered. "Don't hurt me."</p>
<p>"I won't hurt you, my dear," he said. "I'm going to put you to
bed. Yes. I'm going to put you to bed. Do you hear?" He felt he
must cry out in his throat for joy.</p>
<p>He carried her over and laid her on the bed. Then he knelt
beside her, putting his arm beneath her and gathering her to
him.</p>
<p>"Good-night, my dear. Kiss me good-night. Do you love me?"</p>
<p>"Yes." She kissed him. "Good-night, my darling. Don't go back
by the window. You may fall."</p>
<p>But he went, as he came, reaching through the moonlight
exultantly like a cat. For a long time he lay awake, in a quiet
delirium, his heart thudding fiercely against his ribs. Sleep
crept across his senses with goose-soft warmth: the young leaves
of the maples rustled, a cock sounded his distant elfin
minstrelsy, the ghost of a dog howled. He slept.</p>
<p>He awoke with a high hot sun beating in on his face through
the porch awnings. He hated to awake in sunlight. Some day he
would sleep in a great room that was always cool and dark. There
would be trees and vines at his windows, or the scooped-out lift
of the hill. His clothing was wet with night-damp as he dressed.
When he went downstairs he found Gant rocking miserably upon the
porch, his hand gripped over a walkingstick.</p>
<p>"Good-morning," he said, "how do you feel?"</p>
<p>His father cast his uneasy flickering eyes on him, and
groaned.</p>
<p>"Merciful God! I'm being punished for my sins."</p>
<p>"You'll feel better in a little," said Eugene. "Did you eat
anything?"</p>
<p>"It stuck in my throat," said Gant, who had eaten heartily. "I
couldn't swallow a bite. How's your hand, son?" he asked very
humbly.</p>
<p>"Oh, it's all right," said Eugene quickly. "Who told you about
my hand?"</p>
<p>"She said I had hurt your hand," said Gant sorrowfully.</p>
<p>"Ah-h!" said the boy angrily. "No. I wasn't hurt."</p>
<p>Gant leaned to the side and, without looking, clumsily, patted
his son's uninjured hand.</p>
<p>"I'm sorry for what I've done," he said. "I'm a sick man. Do
you need money?"</p>
<p>"No," said Eugene, embarrassed. "I have all I need."</p>
<p>"Come to the office to-day, and I'll give you something," said
Gant. "Poor child, I suppose you're hard up."</p>
<p>But instead, he waited until Laura James returned from her
morning visit to the city's bathing-pool. She came with her
bathing-suit in one hand, and several small packages in the
other. More arrived by negro carriers. She paid and signed,</p>
<p>"You must have a lot of money, Laura?" he said. "You do this
every day, don't you?"</p>
<p>"Daddy gets after me about it," she admitted, "but I love to
buy clothes. I spend all my money on clothes."</p>
<p>"What are you going to do now?"</p>
<p>"Nothing&mdash;whatever you like. It's a lovely day to do
something, isn't it?"</p>
<p>"It's a lovely day to do nothing. Would you like to go off
somewhere, Laura?"</p>
<p>"I'd love to go off somewhere with you," said Laura James.</p>
<p>"That is the idea, my girl. That is the idea," he said
exultantly, in throaty and exuberant burlesque. "We will go off
somewhere alone&mdash;we will take along something to eat," he
said lusciously.</p>
<p>Laura went to her room and put on a pair of sturdy little
slippers. Eugene went into the kitchen.</p>
<p>"Have you a shoe-box?" he asked Eliza.</p>
<p>"What do you want that for?" she said suspiciously.</p>
<p>"I'm going to the bank," he said ironically. "I wanted
something to carry my money in." But immediately he added
roughly:</p>
<p>"I'm going on a picnic."</p>
<p>"Huh? Hah? What's that you say?" said Eliza. "A picnic? Who
are you going with? That girl?"</p>
<p>"No," he said heavily, "with President Wilson, the King of
England, and Dr. Doak. We're going to have lemonade&mdash;I've
promised to bring the lemons."</p>
<p>"I'll vow, boy!" said Eliza fretfully. "I don't like
it&mdash;your running off this way when I need you. I wanted you
to make a deposit for me, and the telephone people will
disconnect me if I don't send them the money to-day."</p>
<p>"O mama! For God's sake!" he cried annoyed. "You always need
me when I want to go somewhere. Let them wait! They can wait a
day."</p>
<p>"It's overdue," she said. "Well, here you are. I wish I had
time to go off on picnics." She fished a shoe-box out of a pile
of magazines and newspapers that littered the top of a low
cupboard.</p>
<p>"Have you got anything to eat?"</p>
<p>"We'll get it," he said, and departed.</p>
<p>They went down the hill, and paused at the musty little
grocery around the corner on Woodson Street, where they bought
crackers, peanut butter, currant jelly, bottled pickles, and a
big slice of rich yellow cheese. The grocer was an old Jew who
muttered jargon into a rabbi's beard as if saying a spell against
Dybbuks. The boy looked closely to see if his hands touched the
food. They were not clean.</p>
<p>On their way up the hill, they stopped for a few minutes at
Gant's. They found Helen and Ben in the dining-room. Ben was
eating breakfast, bending, as usual, with scowling attention,
over his coffee, turning from eggs and bacon almost with disgust.
Helen insisted on contributing boiled eggs and sandwiches to
their provision: the two women went back into the kitchen. Eugene
sat at table with Ben, drinking coffee.</p>
<p>"O-oh my God!" Ben said at length, yawning wearily. He lighted
a cigarette. "How's the Old Man this morning?"</p>
<p>"He's all right, I think. Said he couldn't eat breakfast."</p>
<p>"Did he say anything to the boarders?"</p>
<p>"'You damned scoundrels! You dirty Mountain Grills!
Whee&mdash;!' That was all."</p>
<p>Ben snickered quietly.</p>
<p>"Did he hurt your hand? Let's see."</p>
<p>"No. You can't see anything. It's not hurt," said Eugene,
lifting his bandaged wrist.</p>
<p>"He didn't hit you, did he?" asked Ben sternly.</p>
<p>"Oh, no. Of course not. He was just drunk. He was sorry about
it this morning."</p>
<p>"Yes," said Ben, "he's always sorry about it&mdash;after he's
raised all the hell he can." He drank deeply at his cigarette,
inhaling the smoke as if in the grip of a powerful drug.</p>
<p>"How'd you get along at college this year, 'Gene?" he asked
presently.</p>
<p>"I passed my work. I made fair grades&mdash;if that's what you
mean? I did better&mdash;this Spring," he added, with some
difficulty. "It was hard getting started&mdash;at the
beginning."</p>
<p>"You mean last Fall?"</p>
<p>Eugene nodded.</p>
<p>"What was the matter?" said Ben, scowling at him. "Did the
other boys make fun of you?"</p>
<p>"Yes," said Eugene, in a low voice.</p>
<p>"Why did they? You mean they didn't think you were good enough
for them? Did they look down on you? Was that it?" said Ben
savagely.</p>
<p>"No," said Eugene, very red in the face. "No. That had nothing
to do with it. I look funny, I suppose. I looked funny to
them."</p>
<p>"What do you mean you look funny?" said Ben pugnaciously.
"There's nothing wrong with you, you know, if you didn't go
around looking like a bum. In God's name," he exclaimed angrily,
"when did you get that hair cut last? What do you think you are:
the Wild Man from Borneo?"</p>
<p>"I don't like barbers!" Eugene burst out furiously. "That's
why! I don't want them to go sticking their damned dirty fingers
in my mouth. Whose business is it, if I never get my hair
cut?"</p>
<p>"A man is judged by his appearance to-day," said Ben
sententiously. "I was reading an article by a big business man in
The Post the other day. He says he always looks at a man's shoes
before he gives him a job."</p>
<p>He spoke seriously, haltingly, in the same way that he read,
without genuine conviction. Eugene writhed to hear his fierce
condor prattle this stale hash of the canny millionaires, like
any obedient parrot in a teller's cage. Ben's voice had a dull
flat quality as he uttered these admirable opinions: he seemed to
grope behind it all for some answer, with hurt puzzled eyes. As
he faltered along, with scowling intensity, through a
success-sermon, there was something poignantly moving in his
effort: it was the effort of his strange and lonely spirit to
find some entrance into life&mdash;to find success, position,
companionship. And it was as if, spelling the words out with his
mouth, a settler in the Bronx from the fat Lombard plain, should
try to unriddle the new world by deciphering the World Almanac,
or as if some woodsman, trapped by the winter, and wasted by an
obscure and terrible disease, should hunt its symptoms and its
cure in a book of Household Remedies.</p>
<p>"Did the Old Man send you enough money to get along on?" Ben
asked. "Were you able to hold your own with the other boys? He
can afford it, you know. Don't let him stint you. Make him give
it to you, 'Gene."</p>
<p>"I had plenty," said Eugene, "all that I needed."</p>
<p>"This is the time you need it&mdash;not later," said Ben.
"Make him put you through college. This is an age of
specialization. They're looking for college-trained men."</p>
<p>"Yes," said Eugene. He spoke obediently, indifferently, the
hard bright mail of his mind undinted by the jargon: within, the
Other One, who had no speech, saw.</p>
<p>"So get your education," said Ben, scowling vaguely. "All the
Big Men&mdash;Ford, Edison, Rockefeller&mdash;whether they had it
or not, say it's a good thing."</p>
<p>"Why didn't you go yourself?" said Eugene curiously.</p>
<p>"I didn't have any one to tell me," said Ben. "Besides, you
don't think the Old Man would give me anything, do you?" He
laughed cynically. "It's too late now."</p>
<p>He was silent a moment; he smoked.</p>
<p>"You didn't know I was taking a course in advertising, did
you?" he asked, grinning.</p>
<p>"No. Where?"</p>
<p>"Through the Correspondence School," said Ben. "I get my
lessons every week. I don't know," he laughed diffidently, "I
must be good at it. I make the highest grades they have&mdash;98
or 100 every time. I get a diploma, if I finish the course."</p>
<p>A blinding mist swam across the younger brother's eyes. He did
not know why. A convulsive knot gathered in his throat. He bent
his head quickly and fumbled for his cigarettes. In a moment he
said:</p>
<p>"I'm glad you're doing it. I hope you finish, Ben."</p>
<p>"You know," Ben said seriously, "they've turned out some Big
Men. I'll show you the testimonials some time. Men who started
with nothing: now they're holding down big jobs."</p>
<p>"I hope you do," said Eugene.</p>
<p>"So, you see you're not the only College Man around here,"
said Ben with a grin. In a moment, he went on gravely: "You're
the last hope, 'Gene. Go on and finish up, if you have to steal
the money. The rest of us will never amount to a damn. Try to
make something out of yourself. Hold your head up! You're as good
as any of them&mdash;a damn sight better than these little pimps
about town." He became very fierce; he was very excited. He got
up suddenly from the table. "Don't let them laugh at you! By God,
we're as good as they are. If any of them laughs at you again,
pick up the first damn thing you get your hand on and knock him
down. Do you hear?" In his fierce excitement he snatched up the
heavy carving steel from the table and brandished it.</p>
<p>"Yes," said Eugene awkwardly. "I think it's going to be all
right now. I didn't know how to do at first."</p>
<p>"I hope you have sense enough now to leave those old hookers
alone?" said Ben very sternly. Eugene made no answer. "You can't
do that and be anything, you know. And you're likely to catch
everything. This looks like a nice girl," he said quietly, after
a pause. "For heaven's sake, fix yourself up and try to keep
fairly clean. Women notice that, you know. Look at your
fingernails, and keep your clothes pressed. Have you any
money?"</p>
<p>"All I need," said Eugene, looking nervously toward the
kitchen. "Don't, for God's sake!"</p>
<p>"Put it in your pocket, you little fool," Ben said angrily,
thrusting a bill into his hand. "You've got to have some money.
Keep it until you need it."</p>
<p>Helen came out on the high front porch with them as they
departed. As usual, she had added a double heaping measure to
what they needed. There was another shoe-box stuffed with
sandwiches, boiled eggs, and fudge.</p>
<p>She stood on the high step-edge, with a cloth wound over her
head, her gaunt arms, pitted with old scars, akimbo. A warm sunny
odor of nasturtiums, loamy earth, and honeysuckle washed round
them its hot spermy waves.</p>
<p>"O-ho! A-ha!" she winked comically. "I know something! I'm not
as blind as you think, you know&mdash;" She nodded with
significant jocularity, her big smiling face drenched in the
curious radiance and purity that occasionally dwelt so
beautifully there. He thought always when he saw her thus, of a
sky washed after rain, of wide crystalline distances, cool and
clean.</p>
<p>With a rough snigger she prodded him in the ribs:</p>
<p>"Ain't love grand! Ha-ha-ha-ha! Look at his face, Laura." She
drew the girl close to her in a generous hug, laughing, Oh, with
laughing pity, and as they mounted the hill, she stood there, in
the sunlight, her mouth slightly open, smiling, touched with
radiance, beauty, and wonder.</p>
<p>They mounted slowly toward the eastern edge of town, by the
long upward sweep of Academy Street, which bordered the negro
settlement sprawled below it. At the end of Academy Street, the
hill loomed abruptly; a sinuous road, well paved, curved up along
the hillside to the right. They turned into this road, mounting
now along the eastern edge of Niggertown. The settlement fell
sharply away below them, rushing down along a series of long clay
streets. There were a few frame houses by the roadside: the
dwellings of negroes and poor white people, but these became
sparser as they mounted. They walked at a leisurely pace up the
cool road speckled with little dancing patches of light that
filtered through the arching trees and shaded on the left by the
dense massed foliage of the hill. Out of this green loveliness
loomed the huge raw turret of a cement reservoir: it was streaked
and blotted coolly with water-marks. Eugene felt thirsty. Further
along, the escape from a smaller reservoir roared from a pipe in
a foaming hawser, as thick as a man's body.</p>
<p>They climbed sharply up, along a rocky trail, avoiding the
last long corkscrew of the road, and stood in the gap, at the
road's summit. They were only a few hundred feet above the town:
it lay before them with the sharp nearness of a Sienese picture,
at once close and far. On the highest ground, he saw the solid
masonry of the Square, blocked cleanly out in light and shadow,
and a crawling toy that was a car, and men no bigger than
sparrows. And about the Square was the treeless brick jungle of
business&mdash;cheap, ragged, and ugly, and beyond all this, in
indefinite patches, the houses where all the people lived, with
little bright raw ulcers of suburbia further off, and the healing
and concealing grace of fair massed trees. And below him,
weltering up from the hollow along the flanks and shoulders of
the hill, was Niggertown. There seemed to be a kind of centre at
the Square, where all the cars crawled in and waited, yet there
was no purpose anywhere.</p>
<p>But the hills were lordly, with a plan. Westward, they widened
into the sun, soaring up from buttressing shoulders. The town was
thrown up on the plateau like an encampment: there was nothing
below him that could resist time. There was no idea. Below him,
in a cup, he felt that all life was held: he saw it as might one
of the old schoolmen writing in monkish Latin a Theatre of Human
Life; or like Peter Breughel, in one of his swarming pictures. It
seemed to him suddenly that he had not come up on the hill from
the town, but that he had come out of the wilderness like a
beast, and was staring now with steady beast-eye at this little
huddle of wood and mortar which the wilderness must one day
repossess, devour, cover over.</p>
<p>The seventh from the top was Troy&mdash;but Helen had lived
there; and so the German dug it up.</p>
<p>They turned from the railing, with recovered wind, and walked
through the gap, under Philip Roseberry's great arched bridge. To
the left, on the summit, the rich Jew had his cattle, his
stables, his horses, his cows, and his daughters. As they went
under the shadow of the bridge Eugene lifted his head and
shouted. His voice bounded against the arch like a stone. They
passed under and stood on the other side of the gap, looking from
the road's edge down into the cove. But they could not yet see
the cove, save for green glimmers. The hillside was thickly
wooded, the road wound down its side in a white perpetual
corkscrew. But they could look across at the fair wild hills on
the other side of the cove, cleared halfway up their flanks with
ample field and fenced meadow, and forested above with a
billowing sea of greenery.</p>
<p>The day was like gold and sapphires: there was a swift flash
and sparkle, intangible and multifarious, like sunlight on
roughened water, all over the land. A rich warm wind was blowing,
turning all the leaves back the same way, and making mellow music
through all the lute-strings of flower and grass and fruit. The
wind moaned, not with the mad fiend-voice of winter in harsh
boughs, but like a fruitful woman, deep-breasted, great, full of
love and wisdom; like Demeter unseen and hunting through the
world. A dog bayed faintly in the cove, his howl spent and broken
by the wind. A cowbell tinkled gustily. In the thick wood below
them the rich notes of birds fell from their throats, straight
down, like nuggets. A woodpecker drummed on the dry unbarked hole
of a blasted chestnut-tree. The blue gulf of the sky was spread
with light massy clouds: they cruised like swift galleons,
tacking across the hills before the wind, and darkening the trees
below with their floating shadows.</p>
<p>The boy grew blind with love and desire: the cup of his heart
was glutted with all this wonder. It overcame and weakened him.
He grasped the girl's cool fingers. They stood leg to leg, riven
into each other's flesh. Then they left the road, cutting down
across its loops along steep wooded paths. The wood was a vast
green church; the bird-cries fell like plums. A great butterfly,
with wings of blue velvet streaked with gold and scarlet
markings, fluttered heavily before them in freckled sunlight,
tottering to rest finally upon a spray of dogwood. There were
light skimming noises in the dense undergrowth to either side,
the swift bullet- shadows of birds. A garter snake, greener than
wet moss, as long as a shoelace and no thicker than a woman's
little finger, shot across the path, its tiny eyes bright with
terror, its small forked tongue playing from its mouth like an
electric spark. Laura cried out, drawing back in sharp terror; at
her cry he snatched up a stone in a wild lust to kill the tiny
creature that shot at them, through its coils, the old
snake-fear, touching them with beauty, with horror, with
something supernatural. But the snake glided away into the
undergrowth and, with a feeling of strong shame, he threw the
stone away. "They won't hurt you," he said.</p>
<p>At length, they came out above the cove, at a forking of the
road. They turned left, to the north, toward the upper and
smaller end. To the south, the cove widened out in a rich little
Eden of farm and pasture. Small houses dotted the land, there
were green meadows and a glint of water. Fields of young green
wheat bent rhythmically under the wind; the young corn stood
waist-high, with light clashing blades. The chimneys of
Rheinhart's house showed above its obscuring grove of maples; the
fat dairy cows grazed slowly across the wide pastures. And
further below, half tree-and- shrub-hidden, lay the rich acres of
Judge Webster Tayloe. The road was thickly coated with white
dust; it dipped down and ran through a little brook. They crossed
over on white rocks, strewn across its bed. Several ducks,
scarcely disturbed by their crossing, waddled up out of the clear
water and regarded them gravely, like little children in white
choir aprons. A young country fellow clattered by them in a buggy
filled with empty milk-cans. He grinned with a cordial red face,
saluting them with a slow gesture, and leaving behind an odor of
milk and sweat and butter. A woman, in a field above them, stared
curiously with shaded eyes. In another field, a man was mowing
with a scythe, moving into the grass like a god upon his enemies,
with a reaping hook of light.</p>
<p>They left the road near the head of the cove, advancing over
the fields on rising ground to the wooded cup of the hills. There
was a powerful masculine stench of broad dock-leaves, a hot weedy
odor. They moved over a pathless field, knee-high in a dry
stubbly waste, gathering on their clothes clusters of brown
cockle-burrs. All the field was sown with hot odorous daisies.
Then they entered the wood again, mounting until they came to an
island of tender grass, by a little brook that fell down from the
green hill along a rocky ferny bed in bright cascades.</p>
<p>"Let's stop here," said Eugene. The grass was thick with
dandelions: their poignant and wordless odor studded the earth
with yellow magic. They were like gnomes and elves, and tiny
witchcraft in flower and acorn.</p>
<p>Laura and Eugene lay upon their backs, looking up through the
high green shimmer of leaves at the Caribbean sky, with all its
fleet of cloudy ships. The water of the brook made a noise like
silence. The town behind the hill lay in another unthinkable
world. They forgot its pain and conflict.</p>
<p>"What time is it?" Eugene asked. For, they had come to a place
where no time was. Laura held up her exquisite wrist, and looked
at her watch.</p>
<p>"Why!" she exclaimed, surprised. "It's only half-past
twelve!"</p>
<p>But he scarcely heard her.</p>
<p>"What do I care what time it is!" he said huskily, and he
seized the lovely hand, bound with its silken watch-cord, and
kissed it. Her long cool fingers closed around his own; she drew
his face down to her mouth.</p>
<p>They lay there, locked together, upon that magic carpet, in
that paradise. Her gray eyes were deeper and clearer than a pool
of clear water; he kissed the little freckles on her rare skin;
he gazed reverently at the snub tilt of her nose; he watched the
mirrored dance of the sparkling water over her face. All of that
magic world&mdash;flower and field and sky and hill, and all the
sweet woodland cries, sound and sight and odor&mdash;grew into
him, one voice in his heart, one tongue in his brain, harmonious,
radiant, and whole&mdash;a single passionate lyrical noise.</p>
<p>"My dear! Darling! Do you remember last night?" he asked
fondly, as if recalling some event of her childhood.</p>
<p>"Yes," she gathered her arms tightly about his neck, "why do
you think I could forget it?"</p>
<p>"Do you remember what I said&mdash;what I asked you to do?" he
insisted eagerly.</p>
<p>"Oh, what are we going to do? What are we going to do?" she
moaned, turning her head to the side and flinging an arm across
her eyes.</p>
<p>"What is it? What's the matter? Dear?"</p>
<p>"Eugene&mdash;my dear, you're only a child. I'm so old&mdash;a
grown woman."</p>
<p>"You're only twenty-one," he said. "There's only five years'
difference. That's nothing."</p>
<p>"Oh!" she said. "You don't know what you're saying. It's all
the difference in the world."</p>
<p>"When I'm twenty, you'll be twenty-five. When I'm twenty-six,
you'll be thirty-one. When I'm forty-eight, you'll be
fifty-three. What's that?" he said contemptuously. "Nothing."</p>
<p>"Everything," she said, "everything. If I were sixteen, and
you twenty-one it would be nothing. But you're a boy and I'm a
woman. When you're a young man I'll be an old maid; when you grow
old I shall be dying. How do you know where you'll be, what
you'll be doing five years from now?" she continued in a moment.
"You're only a boy&mdash;you've just started college. You have no
plans yet. You don't know what you're going to do."</p>
<p>"Yes, I do!" he yelled furiously. "I'm going to be a lawyer.
That's what they're sending me for. I'm going to be a lawyer, and
I'm going into politics. Perhaps," he added with gloomy pleasure,
"you'll be sorry then, after I make a name for myself." With
bitter joy he foresaw his lonely celebrity. The Governor's
Mansion. Forty rooms. Alone. Alone.</p>
<p>"You're going to be a lawyer," said Laura, "and you're going
everywhere in the world, and I'm to wait for you, and never get
married. You poor kid!" She laughed softly. "You don't know what
you're going to do."</p>
<p>He turned a face of misery on her; brightness dropped from the
sun.</p>
<p>"You don't care?" he choked. "You don't care?" He bent his
head to hide his wet eyes.</p>
<p>"Oh, my dear," she said, "I do care. But people don't live
like that. It's like a story. Don't you know that I'm a grown
woman? At my age, dear, most girls have begun to think of getting
married. What&mdash;what if I had begun to think of it, too?"</p>
<p>"Married!" The word came from him in a huge gasp of horror as
if she had mentioned the abominable, proposed the unspeakable.
Then, having heard the monstrous suggestion, he immediately
accepted it as a fact. He was like that.</p>
<p>"So! That's it!" he said furiously. "You're going to get
married, eh? You have fellows, have you? You go out with them, do
you? You've known it all the time, and you've tried to fool
me."</p>
<p>Nakedly, with breast bare to horror, he scourged himself,
knowing in the moment that the nightmare cruelty of life is not
in the remote and fantastic, but in the probable&mdash;the horror
of love, loss, marriage, the ninety seconds treason in the
dark.</p>
<p>"You have fellows&mdash;you let them feel you. They feel your
legs, they play with your breasts, they&mdash;" His voice became
inaudible through strangulation.</p>
<p>"No. No, my dear. I haven't said so," she rose swiftly to a
sitting position, taking his hands. "But there's nothing unusual
about getting married, you know. Most people do. Oh, my dear!
Don't look like that! Nothing has happened. Nothing!
Nothing!"</p>
<p>He seized her fiercely, unable to speak. Then he buried his
face in her neck.</p>
<p>"Laura! My dear! My sweet! Don't leave me alone! I've been
alone! I've always been alone!"</p>
<p>"It's what you want, dear. It's what you'll always want. You
couldn't stand anything else. You'd get so tired of me. You'll
forget this ever happened. You'll forget me. You'll
forget&mdash;forget."</p>
<p>"Forget! I'll never forget! I won't live long enough."</p>
<p>"And I'll never love any one else! I'll never leave you! I'll
wait for you forever! Oh, my child, my child!"</p>
<p>They clung together in that bright moment of wonder, there on
the magic island, where the world was quiet, believing all they
said. And who shall say&mdash;whatever disenchantment
follows&mdash;that we ever forget magic, or that we can ever
betray, on this leaden earth, the apple-tree, the singing, and
the gold? Far out beyond that timeless valley, a train, on the
rails for the East, wailed back its ghostly cry: life, like a
fume of painted smoke, a broken wrack of cloud, drifted away.
Their world was a singing voice again: they were young and they
could never die. This would endure.</p>
<p>He kissed her on her splendid eyes; he grew into her young
M&aelig;nad's body, his heart numbed deliciously against the
pressure of her narrow breasts. She was as lithe and yielding to
his sustaining hand as a willow rod&mdash;she was bird-swift,
more elusive in repose than the dancing water-motes upon her
face. He held her tightly lest she grow into the tree again, or
be gone amid the wood like smoke.</p>
<p>Come up into the hills, O my young love. Return! O lost, and
by the wind grieved, ghost, come back again, as first I knew you
in the timeless valley, where we shall feel ourselves anew,
bedded on magic in the month of June. There was a place where all
the sun went glistening in your hair, and from the hill we could
have put a finger on a star. Where is the day that melted into
one rich noise? Where the music of your flesh, the rhyme of your
teeth, the dainty languor of your legs, your small firm arms,
your slender fingers, to be bitten like an apple, and the little
cherry-teats of your white breasts? And where are all the tiny
wires of finespun maidenhair? Quick are the mouths of earth, and
quick the teeth that fed upon this loveliness. You who were made
for music, will hear music no more: in your dark house the winds
are silent. Ghost, ghost, come back from that marriage that we
did not foresee, return not into life, but into magic, where we
have never died, into the enchanted wood, where we still lie,
strewn on the grass. Come up into the hills, O my young love:
return. O lost, and by the wind grieved, ghost, come back
again.</p>
<h3>31</h3>
<p>One day, when June was coming to its end, Laura James said to
him:</p>
<p>"I shall have to go home next week." Then, seeing his stricken
face, she added, "but only for a few days&mdash;not more than a
week."</p>
<p>"But why? The summer's only started. You will burn up down
there."</p>
<p>"Yes. It's silly, I know. But my people expect me for the
Fourth of July. You know, we have an enormous
family&mdash;hundred of aunts, cousins, and in-laws. We have a
family re-union every year&mdash;a great barbecue and picnic. I
hate it. But they'd never forgive me if I didn't come."</p>
<p>Frightened, he looked at her for a moment.</p>
<p>"Laura! You're coming back, aren't you?" he said quietly.</p>
<p>"Yes, of course," she said. "Be quiet."</p>
<p>He was trembling violently; he was afraid to question her more
closely.</p>
<p>"Be quiet," she whispered, "quiet!" She put her arms around
him.</p>
<p>He went with her to the station on a hot mid-afternoon. There
was a smell of melted tar in the streets. She held his hand
beside her in the rattling trolley, squeezing his fingers to give
him comfort, and whispering from time to time:</p>
<p>"In a week! Only a week, dear."</p>
<p>"I don't see the need," he muttered. "It's over 400 miles.
Just for a few days."</p>
<p>He passed the old one-legged gateman on the station platform
very easily, carrying her baggage. Then he sat beside her in the
close green heat of the pullman until the train should go. A
little electric fan droned uselessly above the aisle; a prim
young lady whom he knew, arranged herself amid the bright new
leather of her bags. She returned his greeting elegantly, with a
shade of refined hauteur, then looked out the window again,
grimacing eloquently at her parents who gazed at her raptly from
the platform. Several prosperous merchants went down the aisle in
expensive tan shoes that creaked under the fan's drone.</p>
<p>"Not going to leave us, are you, Mr. Morris?"</p>
<p>"Hello, Jim. No, I'm running up to Richmond for a few days."
But even the gray weather of their lives could not deaden the
excitement of that hot chariot to the East.</p>
<p>"'Board!"</p>
<p>He got up trembling.</p>
<p>"In a few days, dear." She looked up, taking his hand in her
small gloved palms.</p>
<p>"You will write as soon as you get there? Please!"</p>
<p>"Yes. To-morrow&mdash;at once."</p>
<p>He bent down suddenly and whispered, "Laura&mdash;you will
come back. You will come back!"</p>
<p>She turned her face away and wept bitterly. He sat beside her
once more; she clasped him tightly as if he had been a child.</p>
<p>"My dear, my dear! Don't forget me ever!"</p>
<p>"Never. Come back. Come back."</p>
<p>The salt print of her kiss was on his mouth, his face, his
eyes. It was, he knew, the guttering candle-end of time. The
train was in motion. He leaped blindly up the passage with a cry
in his throat.</p>
<p>"Come back again!"</p>
<p>But he knew. Her cry followed him, as if he had torn something
from her grasp.</p>
<p>Within three days he had his letter. On four sheets of paper,
bordered with victorious little American flags, this:</p>
<p>"My dear: I got home at half-past one, just too tired to move.
I couldn't sleep on the train at all last night, it seemed to get
hotter all the way down. I was so blue when I got here, I almost
cried. Little Richmond is too ghastly for words&mdash;everything
burned up and every one gone away to the mountains or the sea.
How can I ever stand it even for a week!" (Good! he thought. If
the weather holds, she will come back all the sooner.) "It would
be heaven now to get one breath of mountain air. Could you find
your way back to our place in the valley again?" (Yes, even if I
were blind, he thought.) "Will you promise to look after your
hand until it gets well? I worried so after you had gone, because
I forgot to change the bandage yesterday. Daddy was glad to see
me: he said he was not going to let me go again but, don't worry,
I'll have my own way in the end. I always do. I don't know any
one at home any more&mdash;all of the boys have enlisted or gone
to work in the shipyards at Norfolk. Most of the girls I know are
getting married, or married already. That leaves only the kids."
(He winced. As old as I am, maybe older.) "Give my love to Mrs.
Barton, and tell your mother I said she must not work so hard in
that hot kitchen. And all the little cross-marks at the bottom
are for you. Try to guess what they are.</p>
<p>LAURA."</p>
<p>He read her prosy letter with rigid face, devouring the words
more hungrily than if they had been lyrical song. She would come
back! She would come back! Soon.</p>
<p>There was another page. Weakened and relaxed from his
excitement, he looked at it. There he found, almost illegibly
written, but at last in her own speech, as if leaping out from
the careful aimlessness of her letter, this note:</p>
<p>"July 4.</p>
<p>"Richard came yesterday. He is twenty-five, works in Norfolk.
I've been engaged to him almost a year. We're going off quietly
to Norfolk to-morrow and get married. My dear! My dear! I
couldn't tell you! I tried to, but couldn't. I didn't want to
lie. Everything else was true. I meant all I said. If you hadn't
been so young, but what's the use of saying that? Try to forgive
me, but please don't forget me. Good-by and God bless you. Oh, my
darling, it was heaven! I shall never forget you."</p>
<p>When he had finished the letter, he re-read it, slowly and
carefully. Then he folded it, put it in his inner breast-pocket,
and leaving Dixieland, walked for forty minutes, until he came up
in the gap over the town again. It was sunset. The sun's vast
rim, blood-red, rested upon the western earth, in a great field
of murky pollen. It sank beyond the western ranges. The clear
sweet air was washed with gold and pearl. The vast hills melted
into purple solitudes: they were like Canaan and rich grapes. The
motors of cove people toiled up around the horse-shoe of the
road. Dusk came. The bright winking lights in the town went up.
Darkness melted over the town like dew: it washed out all the
day's distress, the harsh confusions. Low wailing sounds came
faintly up from Niggertown.</p>
<p>And above him the proud stars flashed into heaven: there was
one, so rich and low, that he could have picked it, if he had
climbed the hill beyond the Jew's great house. One, like a lamp,
hung low above the heads of men returning home. (O Hesperus, you
bring us all good things.) One had flashed out the light that
winked on him the night that Ruth lay at the feet of Boaz; and
one on Queen Isolt; and one on Corinth and on Troy. It was night,
vast brooding night, the mother of loneliness, that washes our
stains away. He was washed in the great river of night, in the
Ganges tides of redemption. His bitter wound was for the moment
healed in him: he turned his face upward to the proud and tender
stars, which made him a god and a grain of dust, the brother of
eternal beauty and the son of death&mdash;alone, alone.</p>
<p>"Ha-ha-ha-ha!" Helen laughed huskily, prodding him in the
ribs. "Your girl went and got married, didn't she? She fooled
you. You got left."</p>
<p>"Wh-a-a-a-t!" said Eliza banteringly, "has my boy
been&mdash;as the fellow says" (she sniggered behind her hand)
"has my boy been a- courtin'?" She puckered her lips in playful
reproach.</p>
<p>"Oh, for God's sake," he muttered angrily. "What fellow
says!"</p>
<p>His scowl broke into an angry grin as he caught his sister's
eye. They laughed.</p>
<p>"Well, 'Gene," said the girl seriously, "forget about it.
You're only a kid yet. Laura is a grown woman."</p>
<p>"Why, son," said Eliza with a touch of malice, "that girl was
fooling you all the time. She was just leading you on."</p>
<p>"Oh, stop it, please."</p>
<p>"Cheer up!" said Helen heartily. "Your time's coming. You'll
forget her in a week. There are plenty more, you know. This is
puppy love. Show her that you're a good sport. You ought to write
her a letter of congratulation."</p>
<p>"Why, yes," said Eliza, "I'd make a big joke of it all. I
wouldn't let on to her that it affected me. I'd write her just as
big as you please and laugh about the whole thing. I'd show them!
That's what I'd&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Oh, for God's sake!" he groaned, starting up. "Leave me
alone, won't you?"</p>
<p>He left the house.</p>
<p>But he wrote the letter. And the moment after the lid of the
mailbox clanged over it, he was writhen by shame. For it was a
proud and boastful letter, salted with scatterings of Greek,
Latin, and English verse, quotable scraps, wrenched into the text
without propriety, without accuracy, without anything but his
pitiful and obvious desire to show her his weight in the point of
his wit, the depth of his learning. She would be sorry when she
knew her loss! But, for a moment at the end, his fiercely beating
heart stormed through:</p>
<p>"...and I hope he's worth having you&mdash;he can't deserve
you, Laura; no one can. But if he knows what he has, that's
something. How lucky he is! You're right about me&mdash;I'm too
young. I'd cut off my hand now for eight or ten years more. God
bless and keep you, my dear, dear Laura.</p>
<p>"Something in me wants to burst. It keeps trying to, but it
won't, it never has. O God! If it only would! I shall never
forget you. I'm lost now and I'll never find the way again. In
God's name write me a line when you get this. Tell me what your
name is now&mdash;you never have. Tell me where you're going to
live. Don't let me go entirely, I beg of you, don't leave me
alone."</p>
<p>He sent the letter to the address she had given him&mdash;to
her father's house. Week melted into week: his life mounted day
by day in a terrible tension to the delivery of the mail, morning
and afternoon, fell then into a miasmic swamp when no word came,
July ended. The summer waned. She did not write.</p>
<p>Upon the darkening porch, awaiting food, the boarders rocked,
oh rocked with laughter.</p>
<p>The boarders said: "Eugene's lost his girl. He doesn't know
what to do, he's lost his girl."</p>
<p>"Well, well! Did the Old Boy lose his girl?"</p>
<p>The little fat girl, the daughter of one of the two fat
sisters whose husbands were hotel clerks in Charleston, skipped
to and from him, in slow May dance, with fat calves twinkling
brownly above her socks.</p>
<p>"Lost his girl! Lost his girl! Eugene, Eugene, has lost his
girl."</p>
<p>The fat little girl skipped back to her fat mother for
approbation: they regarded each other with complacent smiles
loosely netted in their full-meated mouths.</p>
<p>"Don't let them kid you, big boy. What's the matter: did some
one get your girl?" asked Mr. Hake, the flour salesman. He was a
dapper young man of twenty-six years, who smoked large cigars; he
had a tapering face, and a high domey head, bald on top, fringed
sparsely with fine blond hair. His mother, a large grass-widow
near fifty, with the powerful craggy face of an Indian, a large
mass of dyed yellow hair, and a coarse smile, full of gold and
heartiness, rocked mightily, laughing with hoarse compassion:</p>
<p>"Git another girl, 'Gene. Why, law! I'd not let it bother me
two minutes." He always expected her to spit, emphatically, with
gusto, after speaking.</p>
<p>"You should worry, boy. You should WORRY!" said Mr. Farrel, of
Miami, the dancing instructor. "Women are like street-cars: if
you miss one, there's another along in fifteen minutes. Ain't
that right, lady?" he said pertly, turning to Miss Clark, of
Valdosta, Georgia, for whom it had been uttered. She answered
with a throaty confused twiddle-giggle of laughter. "Oh, aren't
men the awfullest&mdash;"</p>
<p>Leaning upon the porch rail in the thickening dusk, Mr. Jake
Clapp, a well-to-do widower from Old Hominy, pursued his stealthy
courtship of Miss Florry Mangle, the trained nurse. Her limp face
made a white blot in the darkness; she spoke in a tired
whine:</p>
<p>"I thought she was too old for him when I saw her. 'Gene's
only a kid. He's taken it hard, you can tell by looking at him
how miserable he is. He's going to get sick if he keeps on at
this rate. He's thin as a bone. He hardly eats a bite. People get
run down like that and catch the first disease that comes
along&mdash;"</p>
<p>Her melancholy whine continued as Jake's stealthy thigh
fumbled against her. She kept her arms carefully folded across
her sagging breasts.</p>
<p>In the gray darkness, the boy turned his starved face on them.
His dirty clothes lapped round his scarecrow body: his eyes
burned like a cat's in the dark, his hair fell over his forehead
in a matted net.</p>
<p>"He'll git over it," said Jake Clapp, in a precise country
drawl, streaked with a note of bawdry. "Every boy has got to go
through the Calf-Love stage. When I was about 'Gene's age&mdash;"
He pressed his hard thigh gently against Florry, grinning widely
and thinly with a few gold teeth. He was a tall solid man, with a
hard precise face, lewdly decorous, and slanting Mongol eyes. His
head was bald and knobby.</p>
<p>"He'd better watch out," whined Florry sadly. "I know what I'm
talking about. That boy's not strong&mdash;he has no business to
go prowling around to all hours the way he does. He's on the
verge of&mdash;"</p>
<p>Eugene rocked gently on his feet, staring at the boarders with
a steady hate. Suddenly he snarled like a wild beast, and started
down the porch, unable to speak, reeling, but snarling again and
again his choking and insane fury.</p>
<p>"Miss Brown" meanwhile sat primly at the end of the porch, a
little apart from the others. From the dark sun-parlor at the
side came swiftly the tall elegant figure of Miss Irene Mallard,
twenty- eight, of Tampa, Florida. She caught him at the step
edge, and pulled him round sharply, gripping his arms lightly
with her cool long fingers.</p>
<p>"Where are you going, 'Gene?" she said quietly. Her eyes of
light violet were a little tired. There was a faint exquisite
perfume of rosewater.</p>
<p>"Leave me alone!" he muttered.</p>
<p>"You can't go on like this," she said in a low tone. "She's
not worth it&mdash;none of them are. Pull yourself together."</p>
<p>"Leave me alone!" he said furiously. "I know what I'm doing!"
He wrenched away violently, and leaped down into the yard,
plunging around the house in a staggering run.</p>
<p>"Ben!" said Irene Mallard sharply.</p>
<p>Ben rose from the dark porch-swing where he had been sitting
with Mrs. Pert.</p>
<p>"See if you can't do something to stop him," said Irene
Mallard.</p>
<p>"He's crazy," Ben muttered. "Which way did he go?"</p>
<p>"By there&mdash;around the house. Go quick!"</p>
<p>Ben went swiftly down the shallow steps and loped back over
the lawn. The yard sloped sharply down: the gaunt back of
Dixieland was propped upon a dozen rotting columns of whitewashed
brick, fourteen feet high. In the dim light, by one of these
slender piers, already mined with crumbling ruins of wet brick,
the scarecrow crouched, toiling with the thin grapevine of his
arms against the temple.</p>
<p>"I will kill you, House," he gasped. "Vile and accursed House,
I will tear you down. I will bring you down upon the whores and
boarders. I will wreck you, House."</p>
<p>Another convulsion of his shoulders brought down a sprinkling
rain of dust and rubble.</p>
<p>"I will make you fall down on all the people in you, House,"
he said.</p>
<p>"Fool!" cried Ben, leaping upon him, "what are you trying to
do?" He caught the boy's arms from behind and dragged him back.
"Do you think you can bring her back to you by wrecking the
house? Are there no other women in the world, that you should let
one get the best of you like this?"</p>
<p>"Let me go! Let me go!" said Eugene. "What does it matter to
you?"</p>
<p>"Don't think, fool, that I care," said Ben fiercely. "You're
hurting no one but yourself. Do you think you'll hurt the
boarders by pulling the house down on your own head? Do you
think, idiot, that any one cares if you kill yourself?" He shook
the boy. "No. No. I don't care what you do, you know. I simply
want to save the family the trouble and expense of burying
you."</p>
<p>With a great cry of rage and bafflement Eugene tried to free
himself. But the older brother held on as desperately as the Old
Man of the Sea. Then, with a great effort of his hands and
shoulders, the boy lifted his captor off the ground, and dashed
him back against the white brick wall of the cellar. Ben
collapsed, releasing him, with a fit of dry coughing, holding his
hand against his thin breast.</p>
<p>"Don't be a fool," he gasped.</p>
<p>"Did I hurt you?" said Eugene dully.</p>
<p>"No. Go into the house and wash yourself. You ought to comb
your hair once or twice a week, you know. You can't go around
like a wild man. Get something to eat. Have you any money?"</p>
<p>"Yes&mdash;I have enough."</p>
<p>"Are you all right now?"</p>
<p>"Yes&mdash;don't talk about it, please."</p>
<p>"I don't want to talk about it, fool. I want you to learn a
little sense," said Ben. He straightened, brushing his whitened
coat. In a moment, he went on quietly: "To hell with them, 'Gene.
To hell with them all. Don't let them worry you. Get all that you
can. Don't give a damn for anything. Nothing gives a damn for
you. To hell with it all! To hell with it! There are a lot of bad
days. There are a lot of good ones. You'll forget. There are a
lot of days. Let it go."</p>
<p>"Yes," said Eugene wearily, "let it go. It's all right now.
I'm too tired. When you get tired you don't care, do you? I'm too
tired to care. I'll never care any more. I'm too tired. The men
in France get tired and don't care. If a man came and pointed a
gun at me now, I wouldn't be scared. I'm too tired." He began to
laugh, loosely, with a sense of delicious relief. "I don't care
for any one or anything. I've always been afraid of everything,
but when I got tired I didn't care. That's how I shall get over
everything. I shall get tired."</p>
<p>Ben lighted a cigarette.</p>
<p>"That's better," he said. "Let's get something to eat." He
smiled thinly. "Come along, Samson."</p>
<p>They walked out slowly around the house.</p>
<p>He washed himself, and ate a hearty meal. The boarders
finished, and wandered off into the darkness variously&mdash;some
to the band- concert on the Square, some to the moving-pictures,
some for walks through the town. When he had fed he went out on
the porch. It was dark and almost empty save where, at the side,
Mrs. Selborne sat in the swing with a wealthy lumber man from
Tennessee. Her low rich laughter bubbled up softly from the vat
of the dark. "Miss Brown" rocked quietly and decorously by
herself. She was a heavily built and quietly dressed woman of
thirty-nine years, touched with that slightly comic
primness&mdash;that careful gentility&mdash;that marks the
conduct of the prostitute incognito. She was being very refined.
She was a perfect lady and would, if aroused, assert the
fact.</p>
<p>"Miss Brown" lived, she said, in Indianapolis. She was not
ugly: her face was simply permeated with the implacable dullness
of the Mid-Westerner. In spite of the lewdness of her wide thin
mouth, her look was smug. She had a fair mass of indifferent
brown hair, rather small brown eyes, and a smooth russet
skin.</p>
<p>"Pshaw!" said Eliza. "I don't believe her name's 'Miss Brown'
any more than mine is."</p>
<p>There had been rain. The night was cool and black; the
flower-bed before the house was wet, with a smell of geraniums
and drenched pansies. He lighted a cigarette, sitting upon the
rail. "Miss Brown" rocked.</p>
<p>"It's turned off cool," she said. "That little bit of rain has
done a lot of good, hasn't it?"</p>
<p>"Yes, it was hot," he said. "I hate hot weather."</p>
<p>"I can't stand it either," she said. "That's why I go away
every summer. Out my way we catch it. You folks here don't know
what hot weather is."</p>
<p>"You're from Milwaukee, aren't you?"</p>
<p>"Indianapolis."</p>
<p>"I knew it was somewhere out there. Is it a big place?" he
asked curiously.</p>
<p>"Yes. You could put Altamont in one corner of it and never
miss it."</p>
<p>"How big is it?" he said eagerly. "How many people have you
there?"</p>
<p>"I don't know exactly&mdash;over three hundred thousand with
the suburbs."</p>
<p>He reflected with greedy satisfaction.</p>
<p>"Is it pretty? Are there a lot of pretty houses and fine
buildings?"</p>
<p>"Yes&mdash;I think so," she said reflectively. "It's a nice
homelike place."</p>
<p>"What are the people like? What do they do? Are they
rich?"</p>
<p>"Why&mdash;yes. It's a business and manufacturing place. There
are a lot of rich people."</p>
<p>"I suppose they live in big houses and ride around in big
cars, eh?" he demanded. Then, without waiting for a reply, he
went on: "Do they have good things to eat? What?"</p>
<p>She laughed awkwardly, puzzled and confused.</p>
<p>"Why, yes. There's a great deal of German cooking. Do you like
German cooking?"</p>
<p>"Beer!" he muttered lusciously. "Beer&mdash;eh? You make it
out there?"</p>
<p>"Yes." She laughed, with a voluptuous note in her voice. "I
believe you're a bad boy, Eugene."</p>
<p>"And what about the theatres and libraries? You have lots of
shows, don't you?"</p>
<p>"Yes. A lot of good shows come to Indianapolis. All the big
hits in New York and Chicago."</p>
<p>"And a library&mdash;you have a big one, eh?"</p>
<p>"Yes. We have a nice library."</p>
<p>"How many books has it?"</p>
<p>"Oh, I can't say as to that. But it's a good big library."</p>
<p>"Over 100,000 books, do you suppose? They wouldn't have half a
million, would they?" He did not wait for an answer, he was
talking to himself. "No, of course not. How many books can you
take out at a time? What?"</p>
<p>The great shadow of his hunger bent over her; he rushed out of
himself, devouring her with his questions.</p>
<p>"What are the girls like? Are they blonde or brunette?
What?"</p>
<p>"Why, we have both kinds&mdash;more dark than fair, I should
say." She looked through the darkness at him, grinning.</p>
<p>"Are they pretty?"</p>
<p>"Well! I can't say. You'll have to draw your own conclusions,
Eugene. I'm one of them, you know." She looked at him with demure
lewdness, offering herself for inspection. Then, with a laugh of
teasing reproof, she said: "I believe you're a bad boy, Eugene. I
believe you're a bad boy."</p>
<p>He lighted another cigarette feverishly.</p>
<p>"I'd give anything for a smoke," muttered "Miss Brown." "I
don't suppose I could here?" She looked round her.</p>
<p>"Why not?" he said impatiently. "There's no one to see you.
It's dark. What does it matter anyway?"</p>
<p>Little electric currents of excitement played up his
spine.</p>
<p>"I believe I will," she whispered. "Have you got a
cigarette?"</p>
<p>He gave her his package; she stood up to receive the flame he
nursed in his cupped hands. She leaned her heavy body against him
as, with puckered face and closed eyes, she held her cigarette to
the fire. She grasped his shaking hands to steady the light,
holding them for a moment after.</p>
<p>"What," said "Miss Brown," with a cunning smile, "what if your
mother should see us? You'd catch it!"</p>
<p>"She'll not see us," he said. "Besides," he added generously,
"why shouldn't women smoke the same as men? There's no harm in
it."</p>
<p>"Yes," said "Miss Brown," "I believe in being broad-minded
about these things, too."</p>
<p>But he grinned in the dark, because the woman had revealed
herself with a cigarette. It was a sign&mdash;the sign of the
province, the sign unmistakable of debauchery.</p>
<p>Then, when he laid his hands upon her, she came very passively
into his embrace as he sat before her on the rail.</p>
<p>"Eugene! Eugene!" she said in mocking reproof.</p>
<p>"Where is your room?" he said.</p>
<p>She told him.</p>
<p>Later, Eliza came suddenly and silently out upon them, on one
of her swift raids from the kitchen.</p>
<p>"Who's there? Who's there?" she said, peering into the gloom
suspiciously. "Huh? Hah? Where's Eugene? Has any one seen
Eugene?" She knew very well he was there.</p>
<p>"Yes, here I am," he said. "What do you want?"</p>
<p>"Oh! Who's that with you? Hah?"</p>
<p>"'Miss Brown' is with me."</p>
<p>"Won't you come out and sit down, Mrs. Gant?" said "Miss
Brown." "You must be tired and hot."</p>
<p>"Oh!" said Eliza awkwardly, "is that you, 'Miss Brown'? I
couldn't see who it was." She switched on the dim porch light.
"It's mighty dark out here. Some one coming up those steps might
fall and break a leg. I tell you what," she continued
conversationally, "this air feels good. I wish I could let
everything go and just enjoy myself."</p>
<p>She continued in amiable monologue for another half hour, her
eyes probing about swiftly all the time at the two dark figures
before her. Then hesitantly, by awkward talkative stages, she
went into the house again.</p>
<p>"Son," she said before she went, troubled, "it's getting late.
You'd better go to bed. That's where we all ought to be."</p>
<p>"Miss Brown" assented gracefully and moved toward the
door.</p>
<p>"I'm going now. I feel tired. Good-night, all."</p>
<p>He sat quietly on the rail, smoking, listening to the noises
in the house. It went to sleep. He went back and found Eliza
preparing to retire to her little cell.</p>
<p>"Son!" she said, in a low voice, after shaking her puckered
face reproachfully for a moment, "I tell you what&mdash;I don't
like it. It doesn't look right&mdash;your sitting out alone with
that woman. She's old enough to be your mother."</p>
<p>"She's YOUR boarder, isn't she?" he said roughly, "not mine. I
didn't bring her here."</p>
<p>"There's one thing sure," said Eliza, wounded. "You don't
catch me associating with them. I hold up my head as high as any
one." She smiled at him bitterly.</p>
<p>"Well, good-night, mama," he said, ashamed and hurt. "Let's
forget about them for a while. What does it matter?"</p>
<p>"Be a good boy," said Eliza timidly. "I want you to be a good
boy, son."</p>
<p>There was a sense of guilt in her manner, a note of regret and
contrition.</p>
<p>"Don't worry!" he said, turning away suddenly, wrenched
bitterly, as he always was, by a sense of the child-like
innocence and steadfastness that lay at the bottom of her life.
"It's not your fault if I'm not. I shan't blame you.
Goodnight."</p>
<p>The kitchen-light went out; he heard his mother's door click
gently. Through the dark house a shaft of air blew coolly.
Slowly, with thudding heart, he began to mount the stairs.</p>
<p>But on that dark stair, his foot-falls numbed in the heavy
carpet, he came squarely upon a woman's body that, by its
fragrance, like magnolia, he knew was that of Mrs. Selborne. They
held each other sharply by the arms, discovered, with caught
breath. She bent toward him: a few strands of her blonde hair
brushed his face, leaving it aflame.</p>
<p>"Hush-h!" she whispered.</p>
<p>So they paused there, holding each other, breast to breast,
the only time that they had ever touched. Then, with their dark
wisdom of each other confirmed, they parted, each a sharer in the
other's life, to meet thereafter before the world with calm
untelling eyes.</p>
<p>He groped softly back along the dark corridor until he came to
the door of "Miss Brown's" room. It was slightly ajar. He went
in.</p>
<p>She took all his medals, all that he had won at Leonard's
school&mdash;the one for debating, the one for declaiming, the
one in bronze for William Shakespeare. W. S. 1616-1916&mdash;Done
for a Ducat!</p>
<p>He had no money to give her: she did not want much&mdash;a
coin or two at a time. It was, she said, not the money: it was
the principle of the thing. He saw the justice of her
argument.</p>
<p>"For," said she, "if I wanted money, I wouldn't fool with you.
Somebody tries to get me to go out every day. One of the richest
men in this town (old man Tyson) has been after me ever since I
came. He's offered me ten dollars if I'll go out in his car with
him. I don't need your money. But you've got to give me
something. I don't care how little it is. I wouldn't feel decent
unless you did. I'm not one of your little Society Chippies that
you see every day uptown. I've too much self-respect for
that."</p>
<p>So, in lieu of money, he gave her his medals as pledges.</p>
<p>"If you don't redeem them," said "Miss Brown," "I'll give them
to my own son when I go home."</p>
<p>"Have you a son?"</p>
<p>"Yes. He's eighteen years old. He's almost as tall as you are
and twice as broad. All the girls are mad about him."</p>
<p>He turned his head away sharply, whitening with a sense of
nausea and horror, feeling in him an incestuous pollution.</p>
<p>"That's enough, now," said "Miss Brown" with authority. "Go to
your room and get some sleep."</p>
<p>But, unlike the first one in the tobacco town, she never
called him "son."</p>
<blockquote>"Poor Butterfly, for her heart was break-king,<br>
Poor Butterfly, for she loved him so-o&mdash;"</blockquote>
<p>Miss Irene Mallard changed the needle of the little phonograph
in the sun-parlor, and reversed the well-worn record. Then as
with stately emphasis, the opening measure of "Katinka" paced
out, she waited for him, erect, smiling, slender, beautiful, with
long lovely hands held up like wings to his embrace. She was
teaching him to dance. Laura James had danced beautifully: it had
maddened him to see her poised in the arms of a young man
dancing. Now, clumsily, he moved off on a conscientious left
foot, counting to himself. One, two, three, four! Irene Mallard
slipped and veered to his awkward pressure, as bodiless as a fume
of smoke. Her left hand rested on his bony shoulder lightly as a
bird: her cool fingers were threaded into his hot sawing
palm.</p>
<p>She had thick hair of an oaken color, evenly parted in the
middle; her skin was pearl-pale, and transparently delicate; her
jaw was long, full, and sensuous&mdash;her face was like that of
one of the pre- Raphaelite women. She carried her tall graceful
body with beautiful erectness, but with the slightly worn
sensuousness of fragility and weariness: her lovely eyes were
violet, always a little tired, but full of slow surprise and
tenderness. She was like a Luini madonna, mixed of holiness and
seduction, the world and heaven. He held her with reverent care,
as one who would not come too near, who would not break a sacred
image. Her exquisite and subtle perfume stole through him like a
strange whisper, pagan and divine. He was afraid to touch
her&mdash;and his hot palm sweated to her fingers.</p>
<p>Sometimes she coughed gently, smiling, holding a small
crumpled handkerchief, edged with blue, before her mouth.</p>
<p>She had come to the hills not because of her own health, but
because of her mother's, a woman of sixty-five, rustily dressed,
with the petulant hang-dog face of age and sickness. The old
woman suffered from asthma and heart-disease. They had come from
Florida. Irene Mallard was a very capable business woman; she was
the chief bookkeeper of one of the Altamont banks. Every evening
Randolph Gudger, the bank president, telephoned her.</p>
<p>Irene Mallard pressed her palm across the mouthpiece of the
telephone, smiling at Eugene ironically, and rolling her eyes
entreatingly aloft.</p>
<p>Sometimes Randolph Gudger drove by and asked her to go with
him. The boy went sulkily away until the rich man should leave:
the banker looked bitterly after him.</p>
<p>"He wants me to marry him, 'Gene," said Irene Mallard. "What
am I going to do?"</p>
<p>"He's old enough to be your grandfather," said Eugene. "He has
no hair on the top of his head; his teeth are false, and I don't
know what-all!" he said resentfully.</p>
<p>"He's a rich man, 'Gene," said Irene, smiling. "Don't forget
that."</p>
<p>"Go on, then! Go on!" he cried furiously. "Yes&mdash;go ahead.
Marry him. It's the right thing for you. Sell yourself. He's an
old man!" he said melodramatically. Randolph Gudger was almost
forty- five.</p>
<p>But they danced there slowly in a gray light of dusk that was
like pain and beauty; like the lost light undersea, in which his
life, a lost merman, swam, remembering exile. And as they danced
she, whom he dared not touch, yielded her body unto him,
whispering softly to his ear, pressing with slender fingers his
hot hand. And she, whom he would not touch, lay there, like a
sheaf of grain, in the crook of his arm, token of the world's
remedy&mdash;the refuge from the one lost face out of all the
faces, the anodyne against the wound named Laura&mdash;a thousand
flitting shapes of beauty to bring him comfort and delight. The
great pageantry of pain and pride and death hung through the dusk
its awful vision, touching his sorrow with a lonely joy. He had
lost; but all pilgrimage across the world was loss: a moment of
cleaving, a moment of taking away, the thousand phantom shapes
that beaconed, and the high impassionate grief of stars.</p>
<p>It was dark. Irene Mallard took him by the hand and led him
out on the porch.</p>
<p>"Sit down here a moment, 'Gene. I want to talk to you." Her
voice was serious, low-pitched. He sat beside her in the swing,
obediently, with the sense of an impending lecture.</p>
<p>"I've been watching you these last few days," said Irene
Mallard. "I know what's been going on."</p>
<p>"What do you mean?" he said thickly, with thudding pulses.</p>
<p>"You know what I mean," said Irene Mallard sternly. "Now
you're too fine a boy, 'Gene, to waste yourself on that Woman.
Any one can see what she is. Mother and I have both talked about
it. A woman like that can ruin a young boy like you. You've got
to stop it."</p>
<p>"How did you know about it?" he muttered. He was frightened
and ashamed. She took his trembling hand and held it between her
cool palms until he grew quieter. But he drew no closer to her:
he halted, afraid, before her loveliness. As with Laura James,
she seemed too high for his passion. He was afraid of her flesh;
he was not afraid of "Miss Brown's." But now he was tired of the
woman and didn't know how he could pay her. She had all his
medals.</p>
<p>All through the waning summer he walked with Irene Mallard.
They walked at night through the cool streets filled with the
rustle of tired leaves. They went together to the hotel roof and
danced; later "Pap" Rheinhart, kind and awkward and shy, and
smelling of his horse, came to their little table, sitting and
drinking with them. He had spent the years since Leonard's at a
military school, trying to straighten the wry twist of his neck.
But he remained the same as ever&mdash;quizzical, dry, and
humorous. Eugene looked at that good shy face, remembering the
lost years, the lost faces. And there was sorrow in his heart for
what would come no more. August ended.</p>
<p>September came, full of departing wings. The world was full of
departures. It had heard the drums. The young men were going to
the war. Ben had been rejected again in the draft. Now he was
preparing to drift off in search of employment in other towns.
Luke had given up his employment in a war-munitions factory at
Dayton, Ohio, and had enlisted in the Navy. He had come home on a
short leave before his departure for the training-school at
Newport, Rhode Island. The street roared as he came down at his
vulgar wide-legged stride, in flapping blues, his face all on the
grin, thick curls of his unruly hair coiling below the band of
his hat. He was the cartoon of a gob.</p>
<p>"Luke!" shouted Mr. Fawcett, the land-auctioneer, pulling him
in from the street to Wood's pharmacy, "by God, son, you've done
your bit. I'm going to set you up. What are you going to
have?"</p>
<p>"Make it a dope," said Luke. "Colonel, yours truly!" He lifted
the frosty glass in a violently palsied hand, and stood posed
before the grinning counter. "F-f-f-forty years ago," he began,
in a hoarse voice, "I might have refused, but now I can't,
G-G-G-God help me! I c-c-c-c-can't!"</p>
<p>Gant's sickness had returned on him with increased virulence.
His face was haggard and yellow: a tottering weakness crept into
his limbs. It was decided that he must go again to Baltimore.
Helen would go with him.</p>
<p>"Mr. Gant," said Eliza persuasively, "why don't you just give
up everything and settle down to take things easy the rest of
your days? You don't feel good enough to tend to business any
more; if I were you, I'd retire. We could get $20,000 for your
shop without any trouble&mdash;If I had that much money to work
with, I'd show them a thing or two." She nodded pertly with a
smart wink. "I could turn it over two or three times within two
years' time. You've got to trade quick to keep the ball
a-rolling. That's the way it's done."</p>
<p>"Merciful God," he groaned. "That's my last refuge on earth.
Woman, have you no mercy? I beg of you, leave me to die in peace:
it won't be long now. You can do what you please with it after
I'm gone, but give me a little peace now. In the name of Jesus, I
ask it!" He sniffled affectedly.</p>
<p>"Pshaw!" said Eliza, thinking no doubt to encourage him.
"There's nothing wrong with you. Half of it's only
imagination."</p>
<p>He groaned, turning his head away.</p>
<p>Summer died upon the hills. There was a hue, barely guessed,
upon the foliage, of red rust. The streets at night were filled
with sad lispings: all through the night, upon his porch, as in a
coma, he heard the strange noise of autumn. And all the people
who had given the town its light thronging gaiety were vanished
strangely overnight. They had gone back into the vast South
again. The solemn tension of the war gathered about the nation. A
twilight of grim effort hovered around him, above him. He felt
the death of joy; but the groping within him of wonder, of glory.
Out of the huge sprawl of its first delirium, the nation was
beginning to articulate the engines of war&mdash;engines to mill
and print out hatred and falsehood, engines to pump up glory,
engines to manacle and crush opposition, engines to drill and
regiment men.</p>
<p>But something of true wonder had come upon the land&mdash;the
flares and rockets of the battle-fields cast their light across
the plains as well. Young men from Kansas were going to die in
Picardy. In some foreign earth lay the iron, as yet unmoulded,
that was to slay them. The strangeness of death and destiny was
legible upon lives and faces which held no strangeness of their
own. For, it is the union of the ordinary and the miraculous that
makes wonder.</p>
<p>Luke had gone away to the training-school at Newport. Ben went
to Baltimore with Helen and Gant, who, before entering the
hospital again for radium treatment, had gone on a violent and
unruly spree which had compelled their rapid transference from
one hotel to another and had finally brought Gant moaning to his
bed, hurling against God the anathemas that should have been
saved for huge riotings in raw oysters washed down chaotically
with beer and whisky. They all drank a great deal: Gant's
excesses, however, reduced the girl to a state of angry frenzy,
and Ben to one of scowling and cursing disgust.</p>
<p>"You damned old man!" cried Helen, seizing and shaking his
passive shoulders as he lay reeking and sodden on an untidy bed.
"I could wear you out! You're not sick; I've wasted my life
nursing you, and you're not as sick as I am! You'll be here long
after I'm gone, you selfish old man! It makes me furious!"</p>
<p>"Why, baby!" he roared, with a vast gesture of his arms, "God
bless you, I couldn't do without you."</p>
<p>"Don't 'baby' me!" she cried.</p>
<p>But she held his hand next day as they rode out to the
hospital, held it as, quaking, he turned for an instant and
looked sadly at the city stretched behind and below him.</p>
<p>"I was a boy here," he muttered.</p>
<p>"Don't worry," she said, "we're going to make you well again.
Why! You'll be a boy again!"</p>
<p>Hand in hand they entered the lobby where, flanked with death
and terror and the busy matter-of-factness of the nurses and the
hundred flitting shapes of the quiet men with the gray faces and
gimlet eyes who walk so surely in among the broken
lives&mdash;with arms proposed in an attitude of enormous
mercy&mdash;many times bigger than Gant's largest angel&mdash;is
an image of gentle Jesus.</p>
<p>Eugene went to see the Leonards several times. Margaret looked
thin and ill, but the great light in her seemed on this account
to burn more brightly. Never before had he been so aware of her
enormous tranquil patience, the great health of her spirit. All
of his sin, all of his pain, all the vexed weariness of his soul
were washed away in that deep radiance: the tumult and evil of
life dropped from him its foul and ragged cloak. He seemed to be
clothed anew in garments of seamless light.</p>
<p>But he could confess little that lay on his heart: he talked
freely of his work at the university, he talked of little else.
His heart was packed with its burden for confessional, but he
knew he could not speak, that she would not understand. She was
too wise for anything but faith. Once, desperately, he tried to
tell her of Laura: he blurted out a confession awkwardly in a few
words. Before he had finished she began to laugh.</p>
<p>"Mr. Leonard!" she called. "Imagine this rascal with a girl!
Pshaw, boy! You don't know what love is. Get along with you.
There'll be time enough to think of that ten years from now." She
laughed tenderly to herself, with absent misty gaze.</p>
<p>"Old 'Gene with a girl! Pity the poor girl! Ah, Lord, Boy!
That's a long way off for you. Thank your stars!"</p>
<p>He bent his head sharply, and closed his eyes. O My lovely
Saint! he thought. How close you have been to me, if any one. How
I have cut my brain open for you to see, and would my heart, if I
had dared, and how alone I am, and always have been.</p>
<p>He walked through the streets at night with Irene Mallard; the
town was thinned and saddened by departures. A few people hurried
past, as if driven along by the brief pouncing gusts of wind. He
was held in the lure of her subtle weariness: she gave him
comfort and he never touched her. But he unpacked the burden of
his heart, trembling and passionate. She sat beside him and
stroked his hand. It seemed to him that he never knew her until
he remembered her years later.</p>
<p>The house was almost empty. At night Eliza packed his trunk
carefully, counting the ironed shirts and mended socks with
satisfaction.</p>
<p>"Now, you have plenty of good warm clothes, son. Try to take
care of them." She put Gant's check in his inner pocket and
fastened it with a safety-pin.</p>
<p>"Keep a sharp eye on your money, boy. You never know who
you'll run up with on a train."</p>
<p>He dawdled nervously toward the door, wishing to melt away,
not end in leave-taking.</p>
<p>"It does seem you might spend one night at home with your
mother," she said querulously. Her eyes grew misty at once, her
lips began to work tremulously in a bitter self-pitying smile. "I
tell you what! It looks mighty funny, doesn't it? You can't stay
with me five minutes any more without wanting to be up and off
with the first woman that comes along. It's all right! It's all
right. I'm not complaining. It seems as if all I was fit for is
to cook and sew and get you ready to go off." She burst volubly
into tears. "It seems that that's the only use you have for me.
I've hardly laid eyes on you all summer."</p>
<p>"No," he said bitterly, "you've been too busy looking after
the boarders. Don't think, mama, that you can work on my feelings
here at the last minute," he cried, already deeply worked-on.
"It's easy to cry. But I was here all the time if you had had
time for me. Oh, for God's sake! Let's make an end to this!
Aren't things bad enough without it? Why must you act this way
whenever I go off? Do you want to make me as miserable as you
can?"</p>
<p>"Well, I tell you," said Eliza hopefully, becoming dry-eyed at
once, "if I make a couple of deals and everything goes well, you
may find me waiting for you in a big fine house when you come
back next Spring. I've got the lot picked out. I was thinking
about it the other day," she went on, giving him a bright and
knowing nod.</p>
<p>"Ah-h!" he made a strangling noise in his throat and tore at
his collar. "In God's name! Please!" There was a silence.</p>
<p>"Well," said Eliza gravely, plucking at her chin, "I want you
to be a good boy and study hard, son. Take care of your
money&mdash;I want you to have plenty of good food and warm
clothes&mdash;but you mustn't be extravagant, boy. This sickness
of your papa's has cost a lot of money. Everything is going out
and nothing's coming in. Nobody knows where the next dollar's
coming from. So you've got to watch out."</p>
<p>Again silence fell. She had said her say; she had come as
close as she could, but suddenly she felt speechless, shut out,
barred from the bitter and lonely secrecy of his life.</p>
<p>"I hate to see you go, son," she said quietly, with a deep and
indefinable sadness.</p>
<p>He cast his arms up suddenly in a tortured incomplete
gesture.</p>
<p>"What does it matter! Oh God, what does it matter!"</p>
<p>Eliza's eyes filled with tears of real pain. She grasped his
hand and held it.</p>
<p>"Try to be happy, son," she wept, "try to be a little more
happy. Poor child! Poor child! Nobody ever knew you. Before you
were born," she shook her head slowly, speaking in a voice that
was drowned and husky with her tears. Then, huskily, clearing her
throat, she repeated, "Before you were born&mdash;"</p>
<h3>32</h3>
<p>When he returned to the university for his second year, he
found the place adjusted soberly to war. It seemed quieter,
sadder&mdash;the number of students was smaller and they were
younger. The older ones had gone to war. The others were in a
state of wild, but subdued, restlessness. They were careless of
colleges, careers, successes&mdash;the war had thrilled them with
its triumphing Now. Of what use To-morrow! Of what use all labor
for To-morrow! The big guns had blown all spun schemes to
fragments: they hailed the end of all planned work with a fierce,
a secret joy. The business of education went on half-heartedly,
with an abstracted look: in the classroom, their eyes were vague
upon the book, but their ears cocked attentively for alarums and
excursions without.</p>
<p>Eugene began the year earnestly as room-mate of a young man
who had been the best student in the Altamont High School. His
name was Bob Sterling. Bob Sterling was nineteen years old, the
son of a widow. He was of middling height, always very neatly and
soberly dressed; there was nothing conspicuous about him. For
this reason, he could laugh good-naturedly, a little smugly, at
whatever was conspicuous. He had a good mind&mdash;bright,
attentive, studious, unmarked by originality or inventiveness. He
had a time for everything: he apportioned a certain time for the
preparation of each lesson, and went over it three times,
mumbling rapidly to himself. He sent his laundry out every
Monday. When in merry company he laughed heartily and enjoyed
himself, but he always kept track of the time. Presently, he
would look at his watch, saying: "Well, this is all very nice,
but it's getting no work done," and he would go.</p>
<p>Every one said he had a bright future. He remonstrated with
Eugene, with good-natured seriousness, about his habits. He ought
not to throw his clothes around. He ought not to let his shirts
and drawers accumulate in a dirty pile. He ought to have a
regular time for doing each lesson; he ought to live by regular
hours.</p>
<p>They lived in a private dwelling on the edge of the campus, in
a large bright room decorated with a great number of college
pennants, all of which belonged to Bob Sterling.</p>
<p>Bob Sterling had heart-disease. He stood on the landing,
gasping, when he had climbed the stairs. Eugene opened the door
for him. Bob Sterling's pleasant face was dead white, spotted by
pale freckles. His lips chattered and turned blue.</p>
<p>"What is it, Bob? How do you feel?" said Eugene.</p>
<p>"Come here," said Bob Sterling with a grin. "Put your head
down here." He took Eugene's head and placed it against his
heart. The great pump beat slowly and irregularly, with a hissing
respiration.</p>
<p>"Good God!" cried Eugene.</p>
<p>"Do you hear it?" said Bob Sterling, beginning to laugh. Then
he went into the room, chafing his dry hands briskly.</p>
<p>But he fell sick and could not attend classes. He was taken to
the College Infirmary, where he lay for several weeks, apparently
not very ill, but with lips constantly blue, a slow pulse, and a
sub- normal temperature. Nothing could be done about it.</p>
<p>His mother came and took him home. Eugene wrote him regularly
twice a week, getting in return short but cheerful messages. Then
one day he died.</p>
<p>Two weeks later the widow returned to gather together the
boy's belongings. Silently she collected the clothing that no one
would ever wear. She was a stout woman in her forties. Eugene
took all the pennants from the wall and folded them. She packed
them in a valise and turned to go.</p>
<p>"Here's another," said Eugene.</p>
<p>She burst suddenly into tears and seized his hand.</p>
<p>"He was so brave," she said, "so brave. Those last
days&mdash;I had not meant to&mdash;Your letters made him so
happy."</p>
<p>She's alone now, Eugene thought.</p>
<p>I cannot stay here, he thought, where he has been. We were
here together. Always I should see him on the landing, with the
hissing valve and the blue lips, or hear him mumbling his
lessons. Then, at night, the other cot would be empty. I think I
shall room alone hereafter.</p>
<p>But he roomed the remainder of the term in one of the
dormitories. He had two room-mates&mdash;one, an Altamont young
man who answered to the name of L. K. Duncan (the "L" stood for
Lawrence, but every one called him "Elk") and the other, the son
of an Episcopal minister, Harold Gay. Both were several years
older than Eugene: Elk Duncan was twenty-four, and Harold Gay,
twenty-two. But it is doubtful whether a more precious congress
of freaks had ever before gathered in two small rooms, one of
which they used as a "study."</p>
<p>Elk Duncan was the son of an Altamont attorney, a small
Democratic politician, mighty in county affairs. Elk Duncan was
tall&mdash;an inch or two over six feet&mdash;and incredibly
thin, or rather narrow. He was already a little bald, he had a
high prominent forehead, and large pale bulging eyes: from that
point his long pale face sloped backward to his chin. His
shoulders were a trifle bowed and very narrow; the rest of his
body had the symmetry of a lead pencil. He always dressed very
foppishly, in tight suits of blue flannel, with high stiff
collars, fat silken cravats, and colored silk handkerchiefs. He
was a student in the Law School, but he spent a large part of his
time, industriously, in avoiding study.</p>
<p>The younger students&mdash;particularly the
Freshmen&mdash;gathered around him after meals with mouths
slightly ajar, feeding upon his words like manna, and hungrily
demanding more, the wilder his fable became. His posture toward
life was very much that of the barker of a carnival sideshow:
loquacious, patronizing, and cynical.</p>
<p>The other room-mate, Harold Gay, was a good soul, no older
than a child. He wore spectacles, which gave the only glister to
the dull grayness of his face; he was plain and ugly without any
distinction: he had been puzzled so long by at least four-fifths
of the phenomena of existence that he no longer made any effort
to comprehend them. Instead, he concealed his shyness and
bewilderment under a braying laugh that echoed at all the wrong
places, and a silly grin full of an absurd and devilish
knowingness. His association with Elk Duncan was one of the proud
summits of his life: he weltered in the purple calcium which
bathed that worthy, he smoked cigarettes with a debauched leer,
and cursed loudly and uneasily with the accent of a depraved
clergyman.</p>
<p>"Harold! Harold!" said Elk Duncan reprovingly. "Damn, son!
You're getting hard! If you go on like this, you'll begin to chew
gum, and fritter away your Sunday-school money at the movies.
Think of the rest of us, please. 'Gene here's only a young boy,
as pure as a barnyard privy, and, as for me, I've always moved in
the best circles, and associated with only the highest class of
bartenders and ladylike streetwalkers. What would your father say
if he could hear you? Don't you know he'd be shocked? He'd cut
off your cigarette money, son."</p>
<p>"I don't give a damn what he'd do, Elk, nor you either!" said
Harold toughly, grinning. "So, what the hell!" he roared as
loudly as he could. There was an answering howl from the windows
of the whole dormitory&mdash;cries of "Go to hell!" "Cut it out!"
and ironical cheers, at which he was pleased.</p>
<p>The scattered family drew together again at Christmas. A sense
of impending dissolution, of loss and death, brought them back.
The surgeon at Baltimore had given no hope. He had, rather,
confirmed Gant's death-warrant.</p>
<p>"Then how long can he live?" asked Helen.</p>
<p>He shrugged his shoulders. "My dear girl!" he said. "I have no
idea. The man's a miracle. Do you know that he's Exhibit A here?
Every surgeon in the place has had a look. How long can he last?
I'll swear to nothing&mdash;I no longer have any idea. When your
father left here, the first time, after his operation, I never
expected to see him again. I doubted if he would last the winter
through. But he's back again. He may be back many times."</p>
<p>"Can you help him at all? Do you think the radium does any
good?"</p>
<p>"I can give him relief for a time. I can even check the growth
of the disease for a time. Beyond that, I can do nothing. But his
vitality is enormous. He is a creaking gate which hangs by one
hinge&mdash;but which hangs, nevertheless."</p>
<p>Thus, she had brought him home, the shadow of his death
suspended over them like a Damocles sword. Fear prowled softly
through their brains on leopard feet. The girl lived in a
condition of repressed hysteria: it had its outburst daily at
Eliza's or in her own home. Hugh Barton had purchased a house to
which he had taken her.</p>
<p>"You'll get no peace," he said, "as long as you're near them.
That's what's wrong with you now."</p>
<p>She had frequent periods of sickness. She went constantly to
the doctors for treatment and advice. Sometimes she went to the
hospital for several days. Her illness manifested itself in
various ways&mdash;sometimes in a terrible mastoid pain,
sometimes in nervous exhaustion, sometimes in an hysterical
collapse in which she laughed and wept by turns, and which was
governed partly by Gant's illness and a morbid despair over her
failure to bear a child. She drank stealthily at all
times&mdash;she drank in nibbling draughts for stimulants, never
enough for drunkenness. She drank vile liquids&mdash;seeking only
the effect of alcohol and getting at it in strange ways through a
dozen abominations called "tonics" and "extracts." Almost
deliberately she ruined her taste for the better sort of potable
liquors, concealing from herself, under the convenient labellings
of physic, the ugly crawling hunger in her blood. This
self-deception was characteristic of her. Her life expressed
itself through a series of deceptions&mdash;of symbols: her
dislikes, affections, grievances, brandishing every cause but the
real one.</p>
<p>But, unless actually bedridden, she was never absent from her
father for many hours. The shadow of his death lay over their
lives. They shuddered below its horror; its protracted menace,
its unsearchable enigma, deprived them of dignity and courage.
They were dominated by the weary and degrading egotism of life,
which is blandly philosophical over the death of the alien, but
sees in its own the corruption of natural law. It was as hard for
them to think of Gant's death as of God's death: it was a great
deal harder, because he was more real to them than God, he was
more immortal than God, he was God.</p>
<p>This hideous twilight into which their lives had passed froze
Eugene with its terror, and choked him with fury. He would grow
enraged after reading a letter from home and pound the grained
plaster of the dormitory wall until his knuckles were bloody.
They have taken his courage away! he thought. They have made a
whining coward out of him! No, and if I die, no damned family
about. Blowing their messy breaths in your face! Snuffling down
their messy noses at you! Gathering around you till you can't
breathe. Telling you how well you're looking with hearty smiles,
and boo- hooing behind your back. O messy, messy, messy death!
Shall we never be alone? Shall we never live alone, think alone,
live in a house by ourselves alone? Ah! but I shall! I shall!
Alone, alone, and far away, with falling rain. Then, bursting
suddenly into the study, he found Elk Duncan, with unaccustomed
eye bent dully upon a page of Torts, a bright bird held by the
stare of that hypnotic snake, the law.</p>
<p>"Are we to die like rats?" he said. "Are we to smother in a
hole?"</p>
<p>"Damn!" said Elk Duncan, folding the big calfskin and cowering
defensively behind it.</p>
<p>"Yes, that's right, that's right! Calm yourself. You are
Napoleon Bonaparte and I'm your old friend, Oliver Cromwell.
Harold!" he called. "Help! He killed the keeper and got out."</p>
<p>"'Gene!" yelled Harold Gay, hurling a thick volume from him
under the spell of Elk's great names. "What do you know about
history? Who signed Magna Charta, eh?"</p>
<p>"It wasn't signed," said Eugene. "The King didn't know how to
write, so they mimeographed it."</p>
<p>"Correct!" roared Harold Gay. "Who was &AElig;thelred the
Unready?"</p>
<p>"He was the son of Cynewulf the Silly and Undine the
Unwashed," said Eugene.</p>
<p>"On his Uncle Jasper's side," said Elk Duncan, "he was related
to Paul the Poxy and Genevieve the Ungenerous."</p>
<p>"He was excommunicated by the Pope in a Bull of the year 903,
but he refused to be cowed," said Eugene.</p>
<p>"Instead, he called together all the local clergy, including
the Archbishop of Canterbury, Dr. Gay, who was elected Pope,"
said Elk Duncan. "This caused a great schism in the Church."</p>
<p>"But as usual, God was on the side of the greatest number of
canons," said Eugene. "Later on, the family migrated to
California, and made its fortune in the Gold Rush of '49."</p>
<p>"You boys are too good for me!" yelled Harold Gay, getting up
abruptly. "Come on! Who's going to the Pic?"</p>
<p>The Pic was the only purchasable entertainment that the
village afforded steadily. It was a moving-picture theatre,
inhabited nightly by a howling tribe of students who rushed down
aisles, paved with peanut-shells, through a shrapnel fire of
flying goobers, devoting themselves studiously for the remainder
of the evening to the unhappy heads and necks of Freshmen, and
less attentively, but with roars of applause, indignation, or
advice, to the poor flicker-dance of puppets that wavered its way
illegibly across the worn and pleated screen. A weary but
industrious young woman with a scrawny neck thumped almost
constantly at a battered piano. If she was idle for five minutes,
the whole pack howled ironically, demanding: "Music, Myrtle!
Music!"</p>
<p>It was necessary to speak to every one. If one spoke to every
one, one was "democratic"; if one did not, one was a snob, and
got few votes. The appraisal of personality, like all other
appraisal with them, was coarse and blunt. They were suspicious
of all eminence. They had a hard peasant hostility to the
unusual. A man was brilliant? Was there a bright sparkle to him?
Bad, bad! He was not safe; he was not sound. The place was a
democratic microcosmos&mdash;seething with political interests:
national, regional, collegiate.</p>
<p>The campus had its candidates, its managers, its bosses, its
machines, as had the State. A youngster developed in college the
political craft he was later to exert in Party affairs. The son
of a politician was schooled by his crafty sire before the down
was off his cheeks: at sixteen, his life had been plotted ahead
to the governorship, or to the proud dignities of a Congressman.
The boy came deliberately to the university to bait and set his
first traps: deliberately he made those friendships that were
most likely to benefit him later. By his junior year, if he was
successful, he had a political manager, who engineered his campus
ambitions; he moved with circumspection, and spoke with a trace
of pomp nicely weighed with cordiality:</p>
<p>"Ah, there, gentlemen." "Gentlemen, how are you?" "A nice day,
gentlemen."</p>
<p>The vast champaign of the world stretched out its limitless
wonder, but few were seduced away from the fortress of the State,
few ever heard the distant reverberation of an idea. They could
get no greater glory for themselves than a seat in the Senate,
and the way to glory&mdash;the way to all power, highness, and
distinction whatsoever&mdash;was through the law, a string tie,
and a hat. Hence politics, law schools, debating societies, and
speechmaking. The applause of listening senates to command.</p>
<p>The yokels, of course, were in the saddle&mdash;they composed
nine- tenths of the student body: the proud titles were in their
gift, and they took good care that their world should be kept
safe for yokelry and the homespun virtues. Usually, these
dignities&mdash;the presidencies of student bodies, classes,
Y.M.C.A.'s, and the managerships of athletic teams&mdash;were
given to some honest serf who had established his greatness
behind a plough before working in the college commons, or to some
industrious hack who had shown a satisfactory mediocrity in all
directions. Such an industrious hack was called an "all-round
man." He was safe, sound, and reliable. He would never get
notions. He was the fine flower of university training. He was a
football scrub, and a respectable scholar in all subjects. He was
a universal Two Man. He always got Two on everything, except
Moral Character, where he shone with a superlative Oneness. If he
did not go into the law or the ministry, he was appointed a
Rhodes Scholar.</p>
<p>In this strange place Eugene flourished amazingly. He was
outside the pale of popular jealousies: it was quite obvious that
he was not safe, that he was not sound, that decidedly he was an
irregular person. He could never be an all-round man. Obviously,
he would never be governor. Obviously, he would never be a
politician, because he said funny things. He was not the man to
lead a class or say a prayer; he was a man for curious
enterprise. Well, thought they benevolently, we need some such.
We are not all made for weighty business.</p>
<p>He was happier than he had ever been in his life, and more
careless. His physical loneliness was more complete and more
delightful. His escape from the bleak horror of disease and
hysteria and death impending, that hung above his crouched
family, left him with a sense of aerial buoyance, drunken
freedom. He had come to the place alone, without companions. He
had no connections. He had, even now, not one close friend. And
this isolation was in his favor. Every one knew him at sight:
every one called him by name, and spoke to him kindly. He was not
disliked. He was happy, full of expansive joy, he greeted every
one with enthusiastic gusto. He had a vast tenderness, an
affection for the whole marvellous and unvisited earth, that
blinded his eyes. He was closer to a feeling of brotherhood than
he had ever been, and more alone. He was filled with a divine
indifference for all appearance. Joy ran like a great wine
through his young expanding limbs; he bounded down the paths with
wild cries in his throat, leaping for life like an apple, trying
to focus the blind desire that swept him apart, to melt down to a
bullet all of his formless passion, and so, slay death, slay
love.</p>
<p>He began to join. He joined everything. He had never
"belonged" to any group before, but now all groups were beckoning
him. He had without much trouble won a place for himself on the
staff of the college paper and the magazine. The small beginning
trickle of distinctions widened into a gushet. It began to
sprinkle, then it rained. He was initiated into literary
fraternities, dramatic fraternities, theatrical fraternities,
speaking fraternities, journalistic fraternities, and in the
Spring into a social fraternity. He joined enthusiastically,
submitted with fanatical glee to the hard mauling of the
initiations, and went about lame and sore, more pleased than a
child or a savage, with colored ribbons in his coat lapel, and a
waistcoat plastered with pins, badges, symbols, and Greek
letterings.</p>
<p>But not without labor had his titles come. The early autumn
was lustreless and slack: he could not come from the shadow of
Laura. She haunted him. When he went home at Christmas, he found
the hills bleak and close, and the town mean and cramped in the
grim stinginess of winter. There was a ludicrous, a desperate
gaiety in the family.</p>
<p>"Well!" said Eliza sorrowfully, as she peered above the stove,
"let's all try to be happy this time and enjoy a quiet Christmas.
You never know!" She shook her head, unable to continue. Her eyes
were wet. "It may be the last time we're all together. The old
trouble! The old trouble!" she said hoarsely, turning to him.</p>
<p>"What old trouble?" he said angrily. "Good God, why are you so
mysterious?"</p>
<p>"My heart!" she whispered, with a brave smile. "I've said
nothing to any one. But last week&mdash;I thought I was gone."
This was delivered in a boding whisper.</p>
<p>"Oh, my God!" he groaned. "You'll be here when the rest of us
are rotten."</p>
<p>Helen burst into a raucous angry laugh, looking at his sullen
face, and prodding him roughly with her big fingers.</p>
<p>"K-K-K-K-K-K-K! Did you ever know it to fail? Did you? If you
come to her with one of your kidneys gone, she's always got
something worse the matter with her. No, sir! I've never known it
to fail!"</p>
<p>"You may laugh! You may laugh!" said Eliza with a smile of
watery bitterness. "But I may not be here to laugh at much
longer."</p>
<p>"Good heavens, mama!" the girl cried irritably. "There's
nothing wrong with you. You're not the sick one! Papa's the sick
one. He's the one that needs attention. Can't you realize
that&mdash;he's dying. He may not last the winter out. I'm the
sick one! You'll be here long after we're both gone."</p>
<p>"You never know," said Eliza mysteriously. "You never know
who'll be the first one to go. Only last week, there was Mr.
Cosgrave, as fine a looking man as&mdash;"</p>
<p>"They're off!" Eugene screamed with a crazy laugh, stamping up
and down the kitchen in a frenzy. "By God! They're off!"</p>
<p>At this moment, one of the aged harpies, of whom the house
always sheltered two or three during the grim winter, lurched
from the hall back into the door-space. She was a large raw-boned
hag, a confirmed drug-eater, who moved by a violent and dissonant
jerking of her gaunt limbs, pawing abruptly at the air with a
gnarled hand.</p>
<p>"Mrs. Gant," said she, writhing her loose gray lips horribly
before she could speak. "Did I get a letter? Have you seen
him?"</p>
<p>"Seen who? Go on!" said Eliza fretfully. "I don't know what
you're talking about, and I don't believe you do, either."</p>
<p>Smiling hideously at them all, and pawing the air, the monster
got under way again, disappearing like an old wagon with loose
wheels. Helen began to laugh, hoarsely, as Eugene's face hung
forward with mouth half-open in an expression of sullen
stupefaction. Eliza laughed, too, slily, rubbing her nosewing
with a finger.</p>
<p>"I'll vow!" she said. "I believe she's crazy. She takes dope
of some sort&mdash;that's certain. It makes my flesh crawl when
she comes around."</p>
<p>"Then why do you keep her in the house?" said Helen
resentfully. "Good heavens, mama! You could get rid of her if you
wanted to. Poor old 'Gene!" she said, beginning to laugh again.
"You always catch it, don't you?"</p>
<p>"The time draws near the birth of Christ," said he,
piously.</p>
<p>She laughed; then, with abstracted eyes, plucked vaguely at
her large chin.</p>
<p>His father spent most of the day staring vacantly into the
parlor fire. Miss Florry Mangle, the nurse, gave him the morbid
comfort of her silence: she rocked incessantly before the fire,
thirty heel-taps to the minute, with arms tight-folded on her
limp breasts. Occasionally she talked of death and disease. Gant
had aged and wasted shockingly. His heavy clothes wound round his
feeble shanks: his face was waxen and transparent&mdash;it was
like a great beak. He looked clean and fragile. The cancer,
Eugene thought, flowered in him like some terrible but beautiful
plant. His mind was very clear, not doting, but sad and old. He
spoke little, with almost comical gentleness, but he ceased to
listen almost as soon as one answered.</p>
<p>"How have you been, son?" he asked. "Are you getting along all
right?"</p>
<p>"Yes. I am a reporter on the paper now; I may be managing
editor next year. I have been elected to several organizations,"
he went on eagerly, glad of the rare chance to speak to one of
them about his life. But when he looked up again, his father's
stare was fixed sadly in the fire. The boy stopped in confusion,
pierced with a bitter pain.</p>
<p>"That's good," said Gant, hearing him speak no more. "Be a
good boy, son. We're proud of you."</p>
<p>Ben came home two days before Christmas: he prowled through
the house like a familiar ghost. He had left the town early in
the autumn, after his return from Baltimore. For three months he
had wandered alone through the South, selling to the merchants in
small towns space for advertisements upon laundry cards. How well
this curious business succeeded he did not say: he was
scrupulously neat, but threadbare and haggard, and more fiercely
secretive than ever. He had found employment at length upon a
newspaper in a rich tobacco town of the Piedmont. He was going
there after Christmas.</p>
<p>He had come to them, as always, bearing gifts.</p>
<p>Luke came in from the naval school at Newport, on Christmas
eve. They heard his sonorous tenor shouting greetings to people
in the street; he entered the house upon a blast of air. Everyone
began to grin.</p>
<p>"Well, here we are! The Admiral's back! Papa, how's the boy!
Well, for God's sake!" he cried, embracing Gant, and slapping his
back. "I thought I was coming to see a sick man! You're looking
like the flowers that bloom in the Spring."</p>
<p>"Pretty well, my boy. How are you?" said Gant, with a pleased
grin.</p>
<p>"Couldn't be better, Colonel 'Gene, how are you, Old Scout?
Good!" he said, without waiting for an answer. "Well, well, if it
isn't Old Baldy," he cried, pumping Ben's hand. "I didn't know
whether you'd be here or not. Mama, old girl," he said, as he
embraced her, "how're they going? Still hitting on all six.
Fine!" he yelled, before any one could reply to anything.</p>
<p>"Why, son,&mdash;what on earth!" cried Eliza, stepping back to
look at him. "What have you done to yourself? You walk as if you
are lame."</p>
<p>He laughed idiotically at sight of her troubled face and
prodded her.</p>
<p>"Whah&mdash;whah! I got torpedoed by a submarine," he said.
"Oh, it's nothing," he added modestly. "I gave a little skin to
help out a fellow in the electrical school."</p>
<p>"What!" Eliza screamed. "How much did you give?"</p>
<p>"Oh, only a little six-inch strip," he said carelessly. "The
boy was badly burned: a bunch of us got together and chipped in
with a little hide."</p>
<p>"Mercy!" said Eliza. "You'll be lame for life. It's a wonder
you can walk."</p>
<p>"He always thinks of others&mdash;that boy!" said Gant
proudly. "He'd give you his heart's-blood."</p>
<p>The sailor had secured an extra valise, and stocked it on the
way home with a great variety of beverages for his father. There
were several bottles of Scotch and rye whiskies, two of gin, one
of rum, and one each of port and sherry wine.</p>
<p>Every one grew mildly convivial before the evening meal.</p>
<p>"Let's give the poor kid a drink," said Helen. "It won't hurt
him."</p>
<p>"What! My ba-a-by! Why, son, you wouldn't drink, would you?"
Eliza said playfully.</p>
<p>"Wouldn't he!" said Helen, prodding him. "Ho! ho! ho!"</p>
<p>She poured him out a stiff draught of Scotch whiskey.</p>
<p>"There!" she said cheerfully. "That's not going to hurt
him."</p>
<p>"Son," said Eliza gravely, balancing her wine-glass, "I don't
want you ever to acquire a taste for it." She was still loyal to
the doctrine of the good Major.</p>
<p>"No," said Gant. "It'll ruin you quicker than anything in the
world, if you do."</p>
<p>"You're a goner, boy, if that stuff ever gets you," said Luke.
"Take a fool's advice."</p>
<p>They lavished fair warnings on him as he lifted his glass. He
choked as the fiery stuff caught in his young throat, stopping
his breath for a moment and making him tearful. He had drunk a
few times before&mdash;minute quantities that his sister had
given him at Woodson Street. Once, with Jim Trivett, he had
fancied himself tipsy.</p>
<p>When they had eaten, they drank again. He was allowed a small
one. Then they all departed for town to complete their belated
shopping. He was left alone in the house.</p>
<p>What he had drunk beat pleasantly through his veins in warm
pulses, bathing the tips of ragged nerves, giving to him a
feeling of power and tranquillity he had never known. Presently,
he went to the pantry where the liquor was stored. He took a
water tumbler and filled it experimentally with equal portions of
whiskey, gin, and rum. Then, seating himself at the kitchen
table, he began to drink the mixture slowly.</p>
<p>The terrible draught smote him with the speed and power of a
man's fist. He was made instantly drunken, and he knew instantly
why men drank. It was, he knew, one of the great moments in his
life&mdash;he lay, greedily watching the mastery of the grape
over his virgin flesh, like a girl for the first time in the
embrace of her lover. And suddenly, he knew how completely he was
his father's son&mdash;how completely, and with what added power
and exquisite refinement of sensation, was he Gantian. He exulted
in the great length of his limbs and his body, through which the
mighty liquor could better work its wizardry. In all the earth
there was no other like him, no other fitted to be so sublimely
and magnificently drunken. It was greater than all the music he
had ever heard; it was as great as the highest poetry. Why had he
never been told? Why had no one ever written adequately about it?
Why, when it was possible to buy a god in a bottle, and drink him
off, and become a god oneself, were men not forever drunken?</p>
<p>He had a moment of great wonder&mdash;the magnificent wonder
with which we discover the simple and unspeakable things that lie
buried and known, but unconfessed, in us. So might a man feel if
he wakened after death and found himself in Heaven.</p>
<p>Then a divine paralysis crept through his flesh. His limbs
were numb; his tongue thickened until he could not bend it to the
cunning sounds of words. He spoke aloud, repeating difficult
phrases over and over, filled with wild laughter and delight at
his effort. Behind his drunken body his brain hung poised like a
falcon, looking on him with scorn, with tenderness, looking on
all laughter with grief and pity. There lay in him something that
could not be seen and could not be touched, which was above and
beyond him&mdash;an eye within an eye, a brain above a brain, the
Stranger that dwelt in him and regarded him and was him, and that
he did not know. But, thought he, I am alone now in this house;
if I can come to know him, I will.</p>
<p>He got up, and reeled out of the alien presences of light and
warmth in the kitchen; he went out into the hall where a dim
light burned and the high walls gave back their grave-damp chill.
This, he thought, is the house.</p>
<p>He sat down upon the hard mission settle, and listened to the
cold drip of silence. This is the house in which I have been an
exile. There is a stranger in the house, and there's a stranger
in me.</p>
<p>O house of Admetus, in whom (although I was a god) I have
endured so many things. Now, house, I am not afraid. No ghost
need fear come by me. If there's a door in silence, let it open.
My silence can be greater than your own. And you who are in me,
and who I am, come forth beyond this quiet shell of flesh that
makes no posture to deny you. There is none to look at us: O
come, my brother and my lord, with unbent face. If I had 40,000
years, I should give all but the ninety last to silence. I should
grow to the earth like a hill or a rock. Unweave the fabric of
nights and days; unwind my life back to my birth; subtract me
into nakedness again, and build me back with all the sums I have
not counted. Or let me look upon the living face of darkness; let
me hear the terrible sentence of your voice.</p>
<p>There was nothing but the living silence of the house: no
doors were opened.</p>
<p>Presently, he got up and left the house. He wore no hat or
coat; he could not find them. The night was blanketed in a thick
steam of mist: sounds came faintly and cheerfully. Already the
earth was full of Christmas. He remembered that he had bought no
gifts. He had a few dollars in his pocket; before the shops
closed he must get presents for the family. Bareheaded he set off
for the town. He knew that he was drunk and that he staggered;
but he believed that with care and control he could hide his
state from any one who saw him. He straddled the line that ran
down the middle of the concrete sidewalk, keeping his eyes fixed
on it and coming back to it quickly when he lurched away from it.
When he got into the town the streets were thronged with late
shoppers. An air of completion was on everything. The people were
streaming home to Christmas. He plunged down from the Square into
the narrow avenue, going in among the staring passersby. He kept
his eye hotly on the line before him. He did not know where to
go. He did not know what to buy.</p>
<p>As he reached the entrance to Wood's pharmacy, a shout of
laughter went up from the lounging beaux. The next instant he was
staring into the friendly grinning faces of Julius Arthur and Van
Yeats.</p>
<p>"Where the hell do you think you're going?" said Julius
Arthur.</p>
<p>He tried to explain; a thick jargon broke from his lips.</p>
<p>"He's cock-eyed drunk," said Van Yeats.</p>
<p>"You look out for him, Van," said Julius. "Get him in a
doorway, so none of his folks will see him. I'll get the
car."</p>
<p>Van Yeats propped him carefully against the wall; Julius
Arthur ran swiftly into Church Street, and drew up in a moment at
the curb. Eugene had a vast inclination to slump carelessly upon
the nearest support. He placed his arms around their shoulders
and collapsed. They wedged him between them on the front seat;
somewhere bells were ringing.</p>
<p>"Ding-dong!" he said, very cheerfully. "Cris-muss!"</p>
<p>They answered with a wild yell of laughter.</p>
<p>The house was still empty when they came to it. They got him
out of the car, and staggered up the steps with him. He was sorry
enough that their fellowship was broken.</p>
<p>"Where's your room, 'Gene?" said Julius Arthur, panting, as
they entered the hall.</p>
<p>"This one's as good as any," said Van Yeats.</p>
<p>The door of the front bed-room, opposite the parlor, was open.
They took him in and put him on the bed.</p>
<p>"Let's take off his shoes," said Julius Arthur. They unlaced
them and pulled them off.</p>
<p>"Is there anything else you want, son?" said Julius.</p>
<p>He tried to tell them to undress him, put him below the
covers, and close the door, in order to conceal his defection
from his family, but he had lost the power of speech. After
looking and grinning at him for a moment, they went out without
closing the door.</p>
<p>When they had gone he lay upon the bed, unable to move. He had
no sense of time, but his mind worked very clearly. He knew that
he should rise, fasten the door, and undress. But he was
paralyzed.</p>
<p>Presently the Gants came home. Eliza alone was still in town,
pondering over gifts. It was after eleven o'clock. Gant, his
daughter, and his two sons came into the room and stared at him.
When they spoke to him, he burned helplessly.</p>
<p>"Speak! Speak!" yelled Luke, rushing at him and choking him
vigorously. "Are you dumb, idiot?"</p>
<p>I shall remember that, he thought.</p>
<p>"Have you no pride? Have you no honor? Has it come to this?"
the sailor roared dramatically, striding around the room.</p>
<p>Doesn't he think he's hell, though? Eugene thought. He could
not fashion words, but he could make sounds, ironically, in the
rhythm of his brother's moralizing. "Tuh-tuh-tuh-tuh!
Tuh-tuh-tuh-tuh! Tuh-tuh-tuh-tuh!" he said, with accurate
mimicry. Helen, loosening his collar, bent over him laughing. Ben
grinned swiftly under a cleft scowl.</p>
<p>Have you no this? Have you no that? Have you no this? Have you
no that?&mdash;he was cradled in their rhythm. No, ma'am. We've
run out of honor to-day, but we have a nice fresh lot of
self-respect.</p>
<p>"Ah, be quiet," Ben muttered. "No one's dead, you know."</p>
<p>"Go heat some water," said Gant professionally, "he's got to
get it off his stomach." He no longer seemed old. His life in a
marvellous instant came from its wasting shadow; it took on a
hale sinew of health and action.</p>
<p>"Save the fireworks," said Helen to Luke, as she left the
room. "Close the door. For heaven's sake, try to keep it from
mama, if you can."</p>
<p>This is a great moral issue, thought Eugene. He began to feel
sick.</p>
<p>Helen returned in a very few minutes with a kettle of hot
water, a glass, and a box of soda. Gant fed him the solution
mercilessly until he began to vomit. At the summit of his
convulsion Eliza appeared. He lifted his sick head dumbly from
the bowl, and saw her white face at the door, and her weak brown
eyes, that could take on so much sharpness and sparkle when her
suspicion was awakened.</p>
<p>"Hah? Huh? What is it?" said Eliza.</p>
<p>But she knew, of course, instantly, what it was.</p>
<p>"What say?" she asked sharply. No one had said anything. He
grinned feebly at her, tickled, above his nausea and grief, at
the palpable assumption of blind innocence which always heralded
her discoveries. Seeing her thus, they all laughed.</p>
<p>"Oh, my Lord!" said Helen. "Here she is. We were hoping you
wouldn't get here till it was over. Come and look at your Baby,"
she said, with a good-humored snicker, keeping his head
comfortably supported on the palm of her hand.</p>
<p>"How do you feel now, son?" Gant asked kindly.</p>
<p>"Better," he mumbled, discovering, with some elation, that his
vocal paralysis was not permanent.</p>
<p>"Well, you see!" Helen began, kindly enough, but with a
brooding satisfaction. "It only goes to show we're all alike. We
all like it. It's in our blood."</p>
<p>"That awful curse!" Eliza said. "I had hoped that I might have
one son who might escape it. It seems," she said, bursting into
tears, "as if a Judgment were on us. The sins of the
fathers&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Oh! for heaven's sake!" Helen cried angrily. "Stop it! It's
not going to kill him: he'll learn a lesson from it."</p>
<p>Gant gnawed his thin lip, and wetted his great thumb in the
old manner.</p>
<p>"You might know," he said, "that I'd get the blame for it.
Yes&mdash;if one of them broke a leg it would be the same."</p>
<p>"There's one thing sure!" said Eliza. "None of them ever got
it from my side of the house. Say what you will, his grandfather,
Major Pentland, never in his life allowed a drop in his
house."</p>
<p>"Major Pentland be damned!" said Gant. "If you'd depended on
him for anything you'd have gone hungry."</p>
<p>Certainly, thought Eugene, you'd have gone thirsty.</p>
<p>"Forget it!" said Helen. "It's Christmas. Let's try to have a
little peace and quiet once a year."</p>
<p>When they had left him, the boy tried to picture them lulled
in the dulcet tranquillity they so often invoked. Its effects, he
thought, would be more disastrous than any amount of warfare.</p>
<p>In the darkness, everything around and within him swam
hideously. But presently he slid down into a pit of distressed
sleep.</p>
<p>Every one had agreed on a studious forgiveness. They stepped
with obtrusive care around his fault, filled pleasantly with
Christmas and mercy. Ben scowled at him quite naturally, Helen
grinned and prodded him, Eliza and Luke surrendered themselves to
sweetness, sorrow, and silence. Their forgiveness made a loud
noise in his ears.</p>
<p>During the morning his father asked him to come for a walk.
Gant was embarrassed and hang-dog; a duty of gentle admonishment
devolved upon him&mdash;he had been counselled to it by Helen and
Eliza. Now, no man in his time could carry on in the big, Bow-wow
style better than Gant, but none was less fitted to scatter the
blossoms of sweetness and light. His wrath was sudden, his
invective sprang from the moment, but he had for this occasion no
thunder-bolts in his quiver, and no relish for the business
before him. He had a feeling of personal guilt; he felt like a
magistrate fining for intoxication a culprit with whom he has
been on a spree the night before. Besides&mdash;what if the
Bacchic strain in him had been passed on to his son?</p>
<p>They walked on in silence across the Square, by the rimmed
fountain. Gant cleared his throat nervously several times.</p>
<p>"Son," said he presently, "I hope you'll take last night as a
warning. It would be a terrible thing if you let whiskey get the
best of you. I'm not going to speak harshly to you about it: I
hope you'll learn a lesson by it. You had better be dead than
become a drunkard."</p>
<p>There! He was glad it was over.</p>
<p>"I will!" Eugene said. He was filled with gratitude and
relief. How good every one was. He wanted to make passionate
avowals, great promises. He tried to speak. But he couldn't.
There was too much to be said.</p>
<p>But they had their Christmas, beginning thus with parental
advice and continuing through all the acts of contrition, love,
and decorum. They put on, over their savage lives, the raiment of
society, going diligently through the forms and conventions, and
thinking, "now, we are like all other families"; but they were
timid and shy and stiff, like rustics dressed in
evening-clothes.</p>
<p>But they could not keep silence. They were not ungenerous or
mean: they were simply not bred to any restraint. Helen veered in
the wind of hysteria, the strong uncertain tides of her
temperament. At times when, before her own fire, her vitality
sank, and she heard the long howl of the wind outside, she almost
hated Eugene.</p>
<p>"It's ridiculous!" she said to Luke. "His behaving like this.
He's only a kid&mdash;he's had everything, we've had nothing! You
see what it's come to, don't you?"</p>
<p>"His college education has ruined him," said the sailor, not
unhappy that his candle might burn more brightly in a naughty
world.</p>
<p>"Why don't you speak to her?" she said irritably. "She may
listen to you&mdash;she won't to me! Tell her so! You've seen how
she's rubbed it in to poor old papa, haven't you? Do you think
that old man&mdash;sick as he is&mdash;is to blame? 'Gene's not a
Gant, anyway. He takes after her side of the house. He's
queer&mdash;like all of them! WE'RE Gants!" she said with a
bitter emphasis.</p>
<p>"There was always some excuse for papa," said the sailor.
"He's had a lot to put up with." All his convictions in family
affairs had been previously signed with her approval.</p>
<p>"I wish you'd tell her that. With all his moping into books,
he's no better than we are. If he thinks he's going to lord it
over me, he's mistaken."</p>
<p>"I'd like to see him try it when I'm around," said Luke
grimly.</p>
<p>The boy was doing a multiple penance&mdash;he had committed
his first great wrong in being at once so remote from them and so
near to them. His present trouble was aggravated by the
cross-complication of Eliza's thrusts at his father, and the
latent but constantly awakening antagonism of mother and
daughter. In addition, he bore directly Eliza's nagging and
carping attack. All this he was prepared for&mdash;it was the
weather of his mother's nature (she was as fond of him as of any
of them, he thought), and the hostility of Helen and Luke was
something implacable, unconscious, fundamental, that grew out of
the structure of their lives. He was of them, he was recognizably
marked, but he was not with them, nor like them. He had been
baffled for years by the passionate enigma of their
dislike&mdash;their tenders of warmth and affection, when they
came, were strange to him: he accepted them gratefully and with a
surprise he did not wholly conceal. Otherwise, he had grown into
a shell of sullenness and quiet: he spoke little in the
house.</p>
<p>He was wearing ragged from the affair and its consequences. He
felt that he was being unfairly dealt with, but as the hammering
went on he drew his head bullishly down and held his tongue,
counting the hours until his holiday should end. He turned
silently to Ben&mdash;he should have turned nowhere. But the
trusted brother, frayed and bitter on his own accord, scowled
bitterly, and gave him the harsh weight of his tongue. This
finally was unendurable. He felt betrayed&mdash;utterly turned
against and set upon.</p>
<p>The outbreak came three nights before his departure as he
stood, tense and stolid, in the parlor. For almost an hour, in a
savage monotone, Ben had tried deliberately, it seemed, to goad
him to an attack. He had listened without a word, smothering in
pain and fury, and enraging by his silence the older brother who
was finding a vent for his own alien frustration.</p>
<p>"&mdash;and don't stand there scowling at me, you little thug.
I'm telling you for your own good. I'm only trying to keep you
from being a jailbird, you know."</p>
<p>"The trouble with you," said Luke, "is that you have no
appreciation for what's been done for you. Everything's been done
for you, and you haven't sense enough to appreciate it. Your
college education has ruined you."</p>
<p>The boy turned slowly on Ben.</p>
<p>"All right, Ben," he muttered. "That's enough, now. I don't
care what he says, but I've had enough of it from you."</p>
<p>This was the admission the older one had wanted. They were all
in very chafed and ugly temper.</p>
<p>"Don't talk back to me, you little fool, or I'll bat your
brains out."</p>
<p>The boy sprang at his brother like a cat, with a snarling cry.
He bore him backward to the floor as if he were a child, laying
him down gently and kneeling above him, because he had been
instantly shocked by the fragility of his opponent and the ease
of his advantage. He struggled with such mixed rage and shame as
those who try quietly to endure the tantrum of a trying brat. As
he knelt above Ben, holding his arms pinned, Luke fell heavily on
his back, uttering excited cries, strangling him with one arm and
cuffing awkwardly with the other.</p>
<p>"All right, B-B-Ben," he chattered, "you grab his legs."</p>
<p>A free scrimmage upon the floor followed, with such a clatter
of upset scuttles, fire-irons, and chairs, that Eliza was brought
at a fast gallop from the kitchen.</p>
<p>"Mercy!" she shrieked, as she reached the door. "They'll kill
him!"</p>
<p>But, although being subdued&mdash;in the proud language of an
older South "defeated, sir, but never beaten"&mdash;Eugene was
doing very well for his age, and continued to chill the spines of
his enemies with strange noises in his larynx, even after they
had all clambered panting to their feet.</p>
<p>"I f-f-f-fink he's gone crazy," said Luke. "He j-j-jumped on
us without a word of warning."</p>
<p>The hero replied to this with a drunken roll of the head, a
furious dilation of the nostrils, and another horrible noise in
his throat.</p>
<p>"What's to become of us!" wept Eliza. "When brother strikes
brother, it seems that the smash-up has come." She lifted the
padded arm-chair, and placed it on its legs again.</p>
<p>When he could speak, Eugene said quietly, to control the
trembling of his voice:</p>
<p>"I'm sorry I jumped on you, Ben. You," he said to the excited
sailor, "jumped on my back like a coward. But I'm sorry for
what's happened. I'm sorry for what I did the other night and
now. I said so, and you wouldn't leave me alone. You've tried to
drive me crazy with your talk. And I didn't," he choked, "I
didn't think you'd turn against me as you have. I know what the
others are like&mdash;they hate me!"</p>
<p>"Hate you!" cried Luke excitedly. "For G-g-god's sake! You
talk like a fool. We're only trying to help you, for your own
good. Why should we hate you!"</p>
<p>"Yes, you hate me," Eugene said, "and you're ashamed to admit
it. I don't know why you should, but you do. You wouldn't ever
admit anything like that, but it's the truth. You're afraid of
the right words. But it's been different with you," he said,
turning to Ben. "We've been like brothers&mdash;and now, you've
gone over against me."</p>
<p>"Ah!" Ben muttered, turning away nervously. "You're crazy. I
don't know what you're talking about!" He lighted a cigarette,
holding the match in a hand that trembled.</p>
<p>But although the boy had used a child's speech of woe and
resentment, they knew there was a core of truth in what he had
said.</p>
<p>"Children, children!" said Eliza sadly. "We must try to love
one another. Let's try to get along together this
Christmas&mdash;what time's left. It may be the last one we'll
ever have together." She began to weep: "I've had such a hard
life," she said, "it's been strife and turmoil all the way. It
does seem I deserve a little peace and happiness now."</p>
<p>They were touched with the old bitter shame: they dared not
look at one another. But they were awed and made quiet by the
vast riddle of pain and confusion that scarred their lives.</p>
<p>"No one, 'Gene," Luke began quietly, "has turned against you.
We want to help you&mdash;to see you amount to something. You're
the last chance&mdash;if booze gets you the way it has the rest
of us, you're done for."</p>
<p>The boy felt very tired; his voice was flat and low. He began
to speak with the bluntness of despair: what he said had
undebatable finality.</p>
<p>"And how are you going to keep booze from getting me, Luke?"
he said. "By jumping on my back and trying to strangle me? That's
on a level with every other effort you've ever made to know
me."</p>
<p>"Oh," said Luke ironically, "you don't think we understand
you?"</p>
<p>"No," Eugene said quietly. "I don't think you do. You know
nothing whatever about me. I know nothing about you&mdash;or any
of you. I have lived here with you for seventeen years and I'm a
stranger. In all that time have you ever talked to me like a
brother? Have you ever told me anything of yourself? Have you
ever tried to be a friend or a companion to me?"</p>
<p>"I don't know what you want," Luke answered, "but I thought I
was acting for the best. As to telling you about myself, what do
you want to know?"</p>
<p>"Well," said Eugene slowly, "you're six years older than I am:
you've been away to school, you've worked in big cities, and you
are now enlisted in the United States Navy. Why do you always act
like God Almighty," he continued with rankling bitterness. "I
know what sailors do! You're no better than I am! What about
liquor? What about women?"</p>
<p>"That's no way to talk before your mother," said Luke
sternly.</p>
<p>"No, son," said Eliza in a troubled voice. "I don't like that
way of talking."</p>
<p>"Then I won't talk like that," Eugene said. "But I had
expected you to say that. We do not want to be told what we know.
We do not want to call things by their names, although we're
willing to call one another bad ones. We call meanness nobility
and hatred honor. The way to make yourself a hero is to make me
out a scoundrel. You won't admit that either, but it's true.
Well, then, Luke, we won't talk of the ladies, black or white,
you may or may not know, because it would make you uncomfortable.
Instead, you can keep on being God and I'll listen to your
advice, like a little boy in Sunday School. But I'd rather read
the Ten Commandments where it's written down shorter and
better."</p>
<p>"Son," said Eliza again with her ancient look of trouble and
frustration, "we must try to get on together."</p>
<p>"No," he said. "Alone. I have done an apprenticeship here with
you for seventeen years, but it is coming to an end. I know now
that I shall escape; I know that I have been guilty of no great
crime against you, and I am no longer afraid of you."</p>
<p>"Why, boy!" said Eliza. "We've done all we could for you. What
crime have we accused you of?"</p>
<p>"Of breathing your air, of eating your food, of living under
your roof, of having your life and your blood in my veins, of
accepting your sacrifice and privation, and of being ungrateful
for it all."</p>
<p>"We should all be thankful for what we have," said Luke
sententiously. "Many a fellow would give his right eye for the
chance you've been given."</p>
<p>"I've been given nothing!" said Eugene, his voice mounting
with a husky flame of passion. "I'll go bent over no longer in
this house. What chance I have I've made for myself in spite of
you all, and over your opposition. You sent me away to the
university when you could do nothing else, when it would have
been a crying disgrace to you among the people in this town if
you hadn't. You sent me off after the Leonards had cried me up
for three years, and then you sent me a year too
soon&mdash;before I was sixteen&mdash;with a box of sandwiches,
two suits of clothes, and instructions to be a good boy."</p>
<p>"They sent you some money, too," said Luke. "Don't forget
that."</p>
<p>"I'd be the only one who would, if I did," the boy answered.
"For that is really what is behind everything, isn't it? My crime
the other night was not in getting drunk, but in getting drunk
without any money of my own. If I did badly at the university
with money of my own, you'd dare say nothing, but if I do well on
money you gave me, I must still be reminded of your goodness and
my unworthiness."</p>
<p>"Why, son!" said Eliza diplomatically, "no one has a word to
say against the way you've done your work. We're very proud of
you."</p>
<p>"You needn't be," he said sullenly. "I've wasted a great deal
of time and some money. But I've had something out of
it&mdash;more than most&mdash;I've done as much work for my wages
as you deserve. I've given you a fair value for your money; I
thank you for nothing."</p>
<p>"What's that! What's that!" said Eliza sharply.</p>
<p>"I said I thank you for nothing, but I take that back."</p>
<p>"That's better!" said Luke.</p>
<p>"Yes, I have a great deal to give thanks for," said Eugene. "I
give thanks for every dirty lust and hunger that crawled through
the polluted blood of my noble ancestors. I give thanks for every
scrofulous token that may ever come upon me. I give thanks for
the love and mercy that kneaded me over the washtub the day
before my birth. I give thanks for the country slut who nursed me
and let my dirty bandage fester across my navel. I give thanks
for every blow and curse I had from any of you during my
childhood, for every dirty cell you ever gave me to sleep in, for
the ten million hours of cruelty or indifference, and the thirty
minutes of cheap advice."</p>
<p>"Unnatural!" Eliza whispered. "Unnatural son! You will be
punished if there's a just God in heaven."</p>
<p>"Oh, there is! I'm sure there is!" cried Eugene. "Because I
have been punished. By God, I shall spend the rest of my life
getting my heart back, healing and forgetting every scar you put
upon me when I was a child. The first move I ever made, after the
cradle, was to crawl for the door, and every move I have made
since has been an effort to escape. And now at last I am free
from you all, although you may hold me for a few years more. If I
am not free, I am at least locked up in my own prison, but I
shall get me some beauty, I shall get me some order out of this
jungle of my life: I shall find my way out of it yet, though it
take me twenty years more&mdash;alone."</p>
<p>"Alone?" said Eliza, with the old suspicion. "Where are you
going?"</p>
<p>"Ah," he said, "you were not looking, were you? I've
gone."</p>
<h3>33</h3>
<p>During the few remaining days of his holiday, he stayed almost
entirely away from the house, coming for a brief and mumbled
meal, and late at night, for bed. He waited for departure as a
prisoner for release. The dolorous prelude to a journey&mdash;the
wet platform eyes, the sudden radiation of hectic warmth, the
declarations of love at sound of the whistle&mdash;left him this
time unmoved. The tear-ducts, he was beginning to discover, had,
like sweat-glands, dermic foundations, and were easily brought to
a salty sparkle at mere sight of a locomotive. He had, therefore,
the somewhat detached composure of a gentleman on his way to a
comfortable week- end, who stands in a noisy crowd, waiting for
the ferry.</p>
<p>He gave benediction to the words in which he had so happily
defined his position as wage-earner. They stated and confirmed an
attitude, and in some measure protected him against the constant
betrayals of sentiment. During the Spring he worked stupendously
at joining activities, knowing that here was coin whose ring they
could hear. He wrote conscientiously each item of his
distinctions; his name found its way back more than once to the
indulgent Altamont papers. Gant kept the clippings proudly, and
gave public readings when he could.</p>
<p>The boy had two short awkward letters from Ben, who was now
stationed one hundred miles away, in the tobacco town. At Easter,
Eugene visited him, staying at his lodgings, where again his
unerring destiny had thrown him into the welcoming arms of a
gray- haired widow. She was under fifty&mdash;a handsome silly
woman, who prodded and teased him as she would an adored child.
She addressed him&mdash;with a loose giggle&mdash;as "Old
Curly-Head," at which he fetched out his usual disgusted plea to
his Maker. "O my God! Listen to this!" She had reverted to an
astonishing romping girlhood, and would exercise her playfulness
by leaping suddenly upon Old Curly- Head, dealing him a stiff dig
in the ribs, and skipping away with a triumphant "Hah! Got you
that time!"</p>
<p>There was forever in that town a smell of raw tobacco, biting
the nostrils with its acrid pungency: it smote the stranger
coming from the train, but all the people in the town denied it,
saying: "No; there is no smell at all." And within a day the
stranger too could smell it no more.</p>
<p>On Easter morning he arose in the blue light and went with the
other pilgrims to the Moravian cemetery.</p>
<p>"You ought to see it," Ben said. "It's a famous custom: people
come from everywhere." But the older brother did not go. Behind
massed bands of horns, the trumpeting blare of trombones, the big
crowds moved into the strange burial ground where all the stones
lay flat upon the graves&mdash;symbol, it was said, of
all-levelling Death. But as the horns blared, the old
ghoul-fantasy of death returned, the grave slabs made him think
of table-cloths: he felt as if he were taking part in some
obscene feast.</p>
<p>Spring was coming on again across the earth like a light
sparkle of water-spray: all of the men who had died were making
their strange and lovely return in blossom and flower. Ben walked
along the streets of the tobacco town looking like asphodel. It
was strange to find a ghost there in that place: his ancient soul
prowled wearily by the cheap familiar brick and all the young
facades.</p>
<p>There was a Square on high ground; in the centre a courthouse.
Cars were parked in close lines. Young men loitered in the drug-
store.</p>
<p>How real it is, Eugene thought. It is like something we have
always known about and do not need to see. The town would not
have seemed strange to Thomas Aquinas,&mdash;but he to the
town.</p>
<p>Ben prowled along, greeting the merchants with a grave scowl,
leaning his skull against their round skulls of practicality,
across their counters&mdash;a phantom soliciting advertisement in
a quiet monotone.</p>
<p>"This is my kid brother, Mr. Fulton."</p>
<p>"Hello, son! Dogged if you don't grow tall 'uns up there, Ben.
Well, if you're like Old Ben, young fellow, we won't kick. We
think a lot of him here."</p>
<p>That's like thinking well of Balder, in Connecticut, Eugene
thought.</p>
<p>"I have only been here three months," said Ben, resting in bed
on his elbow and smoking a cigarette. "But I know all the leading
business men already. I'm well thought of here." He glanced at
his brother quickly and grinned, with a shy charm of rare
confession. But his fierce eyes were desperate and lonely. Hill-
haunted? For&mdash;home? He smoked.</p>
<p>"You see, they think well of you, once you get away from your
people. You'll never have a chance at home, 'Gene. They'll ruin
everything for you. For heaven's sake, get away when you
can.&mdash;What's the matter with you? Why are you looking at me
like that?" he said sharply, alarmed at the set stare of the
boy's face. In a moment he said: "They'll spoil your life. Can't
you forget about her?"</p>
<p>"No," said Eugene. In a moment he added: "She's kept coming
back all Spring."</p>
<p>He twisted his throat with a wild cry.</p>
<p>The Spring advanced with a mounting hum of war. The older
students fell out quietly and drifted away to enlistments. The
younger strained tensely, waiting. The war brought them no
sorrow: it was a pageant which might, they felt, pluck them
instantly into glory. The country flowed with milk and honey.
There were strange rumors of a land of Eldorado to the north,
amid the war industry of the Virginia coast. Some of the students
had been there, the year before: they brought back stories of
princely wages. One could earn twelve dollars a day, with no
experience. One could assume the duties of a carpenter, with only
a hammer, a saw, and a square. No questions were asked.</p>
<p>War is not death to young men; war is life. The earth had
never worn raiment of such color as it did that year. The war
seemed to unearth pockets of ore that had never been known in the
nation: there was a vast unfolding and exposure of wealth and
power. And somehow&mdash;this imperial wealth, this display of
power in men and money, was blended into a lyrical music. In
Eugene's mind, wealth and love and glory melted into a symphonic
noise: the age of myth and miracle had come upon the world again.
All things were possible.</p>
<p>He went home stretched like a bowstring and announced his
intention of going away into Virginia. There was protest, but not
loud enough to impede him. Eliza's mind was fastened on
real-estate and the summer trade. Gant stared into the darkness
at his life. Helen laughed at him and scolded him; then fell to
plucking at her chin, absently.</p>
<p>"Can't do without her? You can't fool me! No, sir. I know why
you want to go," she said jocularly. "She's a married woman now:
she may have a baby, for all you know. You've no right to go
after her."</p>
<p>Then abruptly, she said:</p>
<p>"Well, let him go if he wants to. It looks silly to me, but
he's got to decide for himself."</p>
<p>He got twenty-five dollars from his father&mdash;enough to pay
his railway fare to Norfolk and leave him a few dollars.</p>
<p>"Mark my words," said Gant. "You'll be back in a week's time.
It's a wild-goose chase you're going on."</p>
<p>He went.</p>
<p>All through the night he drew toward her across Virginia,
propped on his elbow in the berth and staring bewitched upon the
great romantic country clumped with dreaming woodlands and white
as a weird dawn beneath the blazing moonlight.</p>
<p>Early in the morning he came to Richmond. He had to change
trains; there was a wait. He went out from the station and walked
up the hill toward the fine old State House drenched cleanly in
the young morning light. He ate breakfast at a lunchroom on Broad
Street, filled already with men going to their work. This casual
and brief contact with their lives, achieved after his lonely and
magnificent approach through the night, thrilled him by its very
casualness. All the little ticking sounds of a city beginning its
day, the strange familiarity of voices in an alien place, heard
curiously after the thunder of the wheels, seemed magical and
unreal. The city had no existence save that which he conferred on
it: he wondered how it had lived before he came, how it would
live after he left. He looked at all the men, feeding with eyes
that held yet the vast moon-meadows of the night and the cool
green width of the earth. They were like men in a zoo; he gazed
at them, looking for all the little particular markings of the
town, the fine mapping upon their limbs and faces of their own
little cosmos. And the great hunger for voyages rose up in
him&mdash;to come always, as now at dawn, into strange cities,
striding in among them, and sitting with them unknown, like a god
in exile, stored with the enormous vision of the earth.</p>
<p>The counterman yawned and turned the crackling pages of a
morning paper. That was strange.</p>
<p>Cars clanked by, beginning to work through the town. Merchants
lowered their awnings; he left them as their day began.</p>
<p>An hour later he was riding for the sea. Eighty miles away lay
the sea and Laura. She slept unwitting of the devouring wheels
that brought him to her. He looked at the aqueous blue sky
whitened with little clouds, and at the land wooded with pines
and indefinable tokens of the marshes and bright salt.</p>
<p>The train drew under the boat-shed at Newport News. The
terrific locomotive, as beautiful as any ship, breathed with
unlaborious fatigue at the rail-head. There, by lapping water,
she came to rest, like a completed destiny.</p>
<p>The little boat lay waiting at the dock. Within a few minutes
he had left the hot murky smell of the shed and was cruising out
into the blue water of the Roads. A great light wind swept over
the water, making a singing noise through the tackle of the
little boat, making a music and a glory in his heart. He drove
along the little decks at a bounding stride, lunging past the
staring people, with wild noises in his throat. The lean
destroyers, the bright mad camouflage of the freighters and the
transports, the lazy red whirl of a propeller, half-submerged,
and the light winey sparkle of the waves fused to a single
radiance and filled him with glory. He cried back into the throat
of the enormous wind, and his eyes were wet.</p>
<p>Upon the decks of the boats, clean little figures in white
moved about; under the bulging counter of a huge Frenchman young
naked men were swimming. They come from France, he thought, and
it is strange that they should be here.</p>
<p>O, the wonder, the magic and the loss! His life was like a
great wave breaking in the lonely sea; his hungry shoulder found
no barriers&mdash;he smote his strength at nothing, and was lost
and scattered like a wrack of mist. But he believed that this
supreme ecstasy which mastered him and made him drunken might
some day fuse its enormous light into a single articulation. He
was Phaeton with the terrible horses of the sun: he believed that
his life might pulse constantly at its longest stroke, achieve an
eternal summit.</p>
<p>The hot Virginias broiled under the fierce blue oven of the
sky, but in the Roads the ships rocked in the freshening breeze
of war and glory.</p>
<p>Eugene remained in the furnace of Norfolk for four days, until
his money was gone. He watched it go without fear, with a sharp
quickening of his pulses, tasting the keen pleasure of his
loneliness and the unknown turnings of his life. He sensed the
throbbing antennae of the world: life purred like a hidden
dynamo, with the vast excitement of ten thousand glorious
threats. He might do all, dare all, become all. The far and the
mighty was near him, around him, above him. There was no great
bridge to span, no hard summit to win. From obscurity, hunger,
loneliness, he might be lifted in a moment into power, glory,
love. The transport loading at the docks might bear him war-ward,
love-ward, fame-ward Wednesday night.</p>
<p>He walked by lapping water through the dark. He heard its
green wet slap against the crusted pier-piles: he drank its
strong cod scent, and watched the loading of great boats drenched
in blazing light as they weltered slowly down into the water. And
the night was loud with the rumble of huge cranes, the sudden
loose rattle of the donkey-engines, the cries of the overseers,
and the incessant rumbling trucks of stevedores within the
pier.</p>
<p>His imperial country, for the first time, was gathering the
huge thrust of her might. The air was charged with murderous
exuberance, rioting and corrupt extravagance.</p>
<p>Through the hot streets of that town seethed the toughs, the
crooks, the vagabonds of a nation&mdash;Chicago gunmen, bad
niggers from Texas, Bowery bums, pale Jews with soft palms, from
the shops of the city, Swedes from the Middle-West, Irish from
New England, mountaineers from Tennessee and North Carolina,
whores, in shoals and droves, from everywhere. For these the war
was a fat enormous goose raining its golden eggs upon them. There
was no thought or belief in any future. There was only the
triumphant Now. There was no life beyond the moment. There was
only an insane flux and re-flux of getting and spending.</p>
<p>Young men from Georgia farms came, in the evenings, from their
work on piers, in camps, in shipyards, to dress up in their
peacock plumage. And at night, hard and brown and lean of hand
and face, they stood along the curbing in $18.00 tan leathers,
$80.00 suits, and $8.00 silk shirts striped with broad
alternating bands of red and blue. They were carpenters, masons,
gang overseers, or said they were: they were paid ten, twelve,
fourteen, eighteen dollars a day.</p>
<p>They shifted, veered from camp to camp, worked for a month,
loafed opulently for a week, enjoying the brief bought loves of
girls they met upon the ocean-beach or in a brothel.</p>
<p>Strapping black buck-niggers, with gorilla arms and the black
paws of panthers, earned $60 a week as stevedores, and spent it
on a mulatto girl in a single evening of red riot.</p>
<p>And more quietly, soberly, in this crowd, moved the older
thriftier workmen: the true carpenters, the true masons, the true
mechanics&mdash;the canny Scotch-Irish of North Carolina, the
fishermen of the Virginia coast, the careful peasantry of the
Middle-West, who had come to earn, to save, to profit from the
war.</p>
<p>Everywhere amid this swarming crowd gleamed the bright raiment
of blood and glory: the sailors thronged the streets in flapping
blues and spotless whites&mdash;brown, tough, and clean. The
marines strode by in arrogant twos, stiff as rods in the loud
pomp of chevrons and striped trousers. Commanders gray and grim,
hard-handed C. P. O.'s, and elegant young ensigns out of college,
with something blonde and fluffy at their side, went by among the
red cap-buttons of French matelots, or the swagger sea-wise port
of the Englishmen.</p>
<p>Through this crowd, with matted uncut hair that fell into his
eyes, that shot its spirals through the rents of his old green
hat, that curled a thick scroll up his dirty neck, Eugene plunged
with hot devouring eyes&mdash;soaked in his sweat by day, sharp
and stale by night.</p>
<p>In this great camp of vagrant floaters he lost himself: he
came home into this world from loneliness. The hunger for
voyages, the hunger that haunts Americans, who are a nomad race,
was half- assuaged here in this maelstrom of the war.</p>
<p>He lost himself in the crowd. He lost count of the days. His
little store of money melted. He moved from a cheap hotel, loud
at night with the noise of harlotry, to a little attic room in a
lodging-house, an oven of hot pine and tarred roof; he moved from
the lodging-house to a fifty-cent cot in the Y. M. C. A., where,
returning night by night, he paid his fee, and slept in a room
with forty snoring sailors.</p>
<p>Finally, his money gone, he slept, until driven out, in
all-night lunchrooms; upon the Portsmouth ferry; and over lapping
water on a rotting pier.</p>
<p>By night he prowled about among the negroes; he listened to
their rich proposed seductions; he went where the sailors went,
down Church Street, where the women were. He prowled the night
with young beast-lust, his thin boy-body stale with sweat, his
hot eyes burning through the dark.</p>
<p>He grew hungry for food. His money was gone. But there was a
hunger and thirst in him that could not be fed. Over the chaos of
his brain hung the shadow of Laura James. Her shadow hung above
the town, above all life. It had brought him here; his heart was
swollen with pain and pride; he would not go to find her.</p>
<p>He was obsessed with the notion that he would find her in the
crowd, upon the street, around the corner. He would not speak to
her if he met her. He would go proudly and indifferently by. He
would not see her. She would see him. She would see him at some
heroic moment, just as he was receiving the love and respect of
beautiful women. She would speak to him; he would not speak to
her. She would be stricken; she would be beaten down; she would
cry to him for love and mercy.</p>
<p>Thus, unclean, unkempt, clothed in rags and hunger and
madness, he saw himself victorious, heroic and beautiful. He was
mad with his obsession. He thought he saw Laura on the streets a
dozen times a day: his heart turned rotten; he did not know what
he should do or say, whether to run or remain. He brooded for
hours over her address in the telephone directory; sitting by the
phone, he trembled with excitement because its awful magic could
be sounded at a gesture, because within a minute he could be with
her, voice to voice.</p>
<p>He hunted out her home. She was living in an old frame house
far out from the centre of the town. He stalked carefully about
the neighborhood, keeping a block away from the house at all
times, observing it obliquely, laterally, from front and back,
with stealthy eye and a smothering thud of the heart, but never
passing before it, never coming directly to it.</p>
<p>He was foul and dirty. The soles of his shoes wore through:
his calloused feet beat against hot pavements. He stank.</p>
<p>At length, he tried to get work. Work there was in great
abundance&mdash;but the princely wages of which he had been told
were hard to find. He could not swear he was a carpenter, a
mason. He was a dirty boy, and looked it. He was afraid. He went
to the Navy Yard at Portsmouth, the Naval Base at Norfolk, the
Bush Terminal&mdash;everywhere there was work, abundant
work&mdash;hard labor that paid four dollars a day. This he would
gladly have taken; but he found that he could not have his wages
until after the second week, and that one week's pay would be
withheld to tide him over in illness, trouble, or departure.</p>
<p>And he had no money left.</p>
<p>He went to a Jew and pawned the watch Eliza had given him upon
his birthday. He got five dollars on it. Then he went by boat
once more to Newport News, and by trolley up the coast to
Hampton. He had heard, in the thronging rumor of Norfolk, that
there was work upon the flying field, and that the worker was fed
and housed upon the field, at company expense.</p>
<p>In the little employment shack at the end of the long bridge
that led across into the field, he was signed on as a laborer and
searched by the sentry, who made him open his valise. Then he
labored across the bridge, kneeing his heavy bag, which bulged
with his soiled and disorderly belongings, before him.</p>
<p>He staggered at length into the rude company office and sought
out the superintendent, a man in the thirties, shaven, pale,
weary, who wore a blue eyeshade, armbands, and talked with a limp
cigarette plastered on his lip.</p>
<p>Eugene thrust out his employment slip in shaking fingers. The
man looked briefly at it.</p>
<p>"College boy, aren't you, son?" he said, glancing at
Eugene.</p>
<p>"Yes, sir," said Eugene.</p>
<p>"Did you ever do day labor before?" said the man.</p>
<p>"No, sir," said Eugene.</p>
<p>"How old are you, son?" the man asked.</p>
<p>Eugene was silent for a moment. "I'm&mdash;nineteen," he said
at length, wondering, since he had lied, why he had not had
courage to say twenty.</p>
<p>The superintendent grinned wearily.</p>
<p>"It's hard work, son," the man said. "You'll be among the wops
and the Swedes and the hunkies. You'll live in the same
bunkhouse, you'll eat with them. They don't smell nice, son."</p>
<p>"I have no money," said Eugene. "I'll work hard. I won't get
sick. Give me the job. Please!"</p>
<p>"No," said the man. "No, I won't do that."</p>
<p>Eugene turned blindly away.</p>
<p>"I tell you what I'll do," said the superintendent. "I'll give
you a job as a checker. You'll be with the office force. That's
where you belong. You'll live with them in their own bunk-house.
They're nice fellows," he said elegantly, "college fellows, like
yourself."</p>
<p>"Thank you," said Eugene, clenching his fingers, with husky
emotion. "Thank you."</p>
<p>"The checker we've got is quitting," said the superintendent.
"You'll go to the stables with him in the morning to get your
horse."</p>
<p>"H-h-h-horse?" said Eugene.</p>
<p>"You'll have a horse," said the superintendent, "to ride
around on."</p>
<p>With strong bowel-excitement Eugene began to think of the
horse, with joy, with fear. He turned to go. He could not bear to
talk of money.</p>
<p>"H-h-how much&mdash;?" he finally croaked, feeling that he
must. Business.</p>
<p>"I'll give you $80 a month to begin with," said the manager
with a touch of magnificence. "If you make good, I'll give you a
hundred."</p>
<p>"And my keep?" whispered Eugene.</p>
<p>"Sure!" said the manager. "That's thrown in."</p>
<p>Eugene reeled away with his valise, and with a head full of
exploding rockets.</p>
<p>These months, although filled with terror and hunger, must be
passed in rapid summary with bare mention of the men and actions
that a lost boy knew. They belong to a story of escape and
wandering&mdash;valuable here to indicate the initiation to the
voyage this life will make. They are a prelude to exile, and into
their nightmare chaos no other purpose may be read than the blind
groping of a soul toward freedom and isolation.</p>
<p>Eugene worked upon the Flying Field for a month. Three times a
day he rode around the field to check the numbers of two dozen
gangs who were engaged in the work of grading, levelling,
blasting from the spongy earth the ragged stumps of trees and
filling interminably, ceaselessly, like the weary and fruitless
labor of a nightmare, the marshy earth-craters, which drank their
shovelled toil without end. The gangs were of all races and
conditions: Portugee niggers, ebony-black, faithful and
childlike, who welcomed him with great toothy grins, each
pointing to his big white pin, on which was printed his number,
crying out in strange outlandish voices, "feefety-nine,
nine-net-ty seex," and so on; Bowery bums, in greasy serge and
battered derbies, toying distastefully with pick-handles that
shredded their dirty uncalloused palms&mdash;their hard evil
faces, with their smudge of beard, were like things corrupt,
green-yellow, that grow under barrels. And there were also
drawling fishermen from the Virginia coast, huge gorilla niggers
from Georgia and the lower South, Italians, Swedes,
Irishmen&mdash;part of the huge compost of America.</p>
<p>He came to know them and their overseers&mdash;tough reckless
men, gray- haired and lustful, full of swift action and coarse
humor.</p>
<p>Stuck like a jigging doll upon the horse, whom he feared, he
rode, staring into heaven, sometimes almost unconscious of the
great engine expanding and contracting below him with a brown
sensual rhythm. The bird-men filled the blue Virginia weather
with the great drone of the Liberties.</p>
<p>At length, hungry again for the ships and faces, he left his
work and spent his earnings in a week of gaudy riot in Norfolk
and on the Virginia beaches. Almost penniless again, with only
the savage kaleidoscope of a thousand streets, a million lights,
the blazing confusion and the strident noise of carnival, he
returned to Newport News in search of employment, accompanied by
another youth from Altamont, likewise a thriftless adventurer in
war-work, whom he had found upon the beach. This worthy, whose
name was Sinker Jordan, was three years older than Eugene. He was
a handsome reckless boy, small in stature, and limping from an
injury he had received in a football game. His character was weak
and volatile&mdash;he hated effort, and was obstinate only in
cursing ill-fortune.</p>
<p>The two young men had a few dollars between them. They pooled
their resources, and, with wild optimism, purchased from a
pawnbroker in Newport News the rudiments of carpenter's
equipment&mdash;hammers, saws, and T-squares. They went inland
fifteen or twenty miles to a dreary government camp sweltering in
the Virginia pines. They were refused employment here and in
black dejection returned in the afternoon to the town they had
left so hopefully in the morning. Before sundown they had secured
employment in the Shipbuilding Yards, but they had been
discharged five minutes after they reported for work, when they
confessed to a grinning foreman in a room full of woodshavings
and quietly slatting belts, that they had no knowledge of the
intensely special carpentry of ship's carving. Nor (they might
have added) of any other.</p>
<p>They were quite moneyless now, and once on the street again,
Sinker Jordan had hurled upon the pavement the fatal tools,
cursing savagely the folly that threatened now to keep them
hungry. Eugene picked the tools up, and took them back to the
imperturbable Uncle, who repurchased them for only a few dollars
less than the sum they had paid him in the morning.</p>
<p>Thus the day. They found a lodging in a dingy house where, as
an appropriate climax to his folly, Sinker Jordan surrendered
their remaining capital into the greedy palm of the
landlady&mdash;and a real lady too, she admitted. But, having
previously eaten, they had all the hope of a full belly and their
youth&mdash;they slept, Sinker without care and without
effort.</p>
<p>Eugene was early up at dawn, and after futile efforts to waken
the luxuriously somnolent Sinker, he was off to the dingy yellow
piers along the waterfront, which were stored with munitions for
the war. After a morning tramping up and down the dusty road
outside the guarded enclosure, he had obtained employment for
himself and Sinker from the chief checker, a nervous ugly man,
swollen with petty tyranny. He had gimlet eyes, glittering below
spectacles, and hard muscular jaws that writhed constantly.</p>
<p>Eugene went to work at seven the next morning&mdash;Sinker, a
day or two later, only when his last small coin had vanished.
Eugene screwed up his pride and borrowed a few dollars from one
of the other checkers. On this he and Sinker lived meagerly until
pay-day&mdash;which was only a few days off. This money slipped
quickly through their careless fingers. Down to a few coins
again, with the next pay-day almost two weeks off, Sinker gambled
at dice with the checkers, behind the great fortress of sacked
oats upon the pier&mdash;lost, won, lost, rose penniless and
cursing God. Eugene knelt beside the checkers, with his last
half-dollar in his palm, heedless of Sinker's bitter taunt. He
had never thrown dice before: naturally, he won&mdash;$8.50. He
rose exultantly from their profane surprise, and took Sinker to
dinner at the best hotel.</p>
<p>A day or two later, he went behind the oats again, gambled
with his last dollar&mdash;and lost.</p>
<p>He began to starve. Day crawled into weary day. The fierce eye
of July beat down upon the pier with a straight insufferable
glare. The boats and trains slid in and out, crammed to the teeth
with munitions&mdash;with food for the soldiers. The hot grainy
air on the pier swam before his eyes speckled with dancing
patches, and he made weary tallies on a sheet as the big black
stevedores swarmed past him with their trunks. Sinker Jordan
cadged small sums from the other checkers, and lived miserably on
bottled pop and cheese at a little grocery across the road from
the pier. Eugene was unable to beg or borrow. Partly from pride,
but more from the powerful brooding inertia of his temper, which
more and more was governing his will to act, he found himself
unable to speak. Each day he said: "I shall speak to one of them
to-day. I shall say that I must eat, and that I have no money."
But when he tried to speak he could not.</p>
<p>As they grew more efficient in their work they were called
back, after the day's end, for work at night. This extra work,
with its time-and-a-half pay, he would otherwise have been glad
to get, but stumbling from exhaustion, the command to return was
horrible. For several days now he had not been home to the dingy
little room which he shared with Sinker Jordan. At the end of his
day's work, he would climb to a little oasis in the enormous wall
of sacked oats and sink into exhausted sleep, with the rattling
of cranes and winches, the steady rumble of the trucks, and the
remote baying of boats anchored in the stream&mdash;mixing in a
strange faint symphony in his ears.</p>
<p>And he lay there, with the fading glimmer of the world about
him, as the war mounted to its climax of blood and passion during
that terrible month. He lay there, like his own ghost, thinking
with pain, with grief, of all the million towns and faces he had
not known. He was the atom for which all life had been
aplot&mdash;Caesar had died and a nameless wife of Babylon, and
somewhere here, upon this marvellous dying flesh, this myriad
brain, their mark, their spirit, rested.</p>
<p>And he thought of the strange lost faces he had known, the
lonely figures of his family, damned in chaos, each chained to a
destiny of ruin and loss&mdash;Gant, a fallen Titan, staring down
enormous vistas of the Past, indifferent to the world about him;
Eliza, beetle-wise, involved in blind accretions; Helen,
childless, pathless, furious&mdash;a great wave breaking on the
barren waste; and finally, Ben&mdash;the ghost, the stranger,
prowling at this moment in another town, going up and down the
thousand streets of life, and finding no doors.</p>
<p>But the next day, on the pier, Eugene was weaker than ever. He
sat sprawled upon a throne of plump oat sacks, with blurred eyes
watching the loading of the bags at the spout, marking raggedly
his tally upon the sheet as the stevedores plunged in and out.
The terrible heat steamed through the grainy pollen of the air:
he moved each limb with forethought, picking it up and placing it
as if it were a detached object.</p>
<p>At the end of the day he was asked to return for night-work.
He listened, swaying on his feet, to the far-sounding voice of
the chief checker.</p>
<p>The supper hour came, upon the heated pier, with the sudden
noise of silence. There were small completed noises up and down
the enormous shed: a faint drumming of footfalls of workers
walking toward the entrance, a slap of water at the ship's hull,
a noise from the bridge.</p>
<p>Eugene went behind the oat pile and climbed blindly up until
he reached his little fortress at the top. The world ebbed from
his fading sense: all sound grew fainter, more far. Presently, he
thought, when I have rested here, I shall get up and go down to
work. It has been a hot day. I am tired. But when he tried to
move he could not. His will struggled against the imponderable
lead of his flesh, stirring helplessly like a man in a cage. He
thought quietly, with relief, with tranquil joy. They will not
find me here. I cannot move. It is over. If I had thought of this
long ago, I would have been afraid. But I'm not, now.
Here&mdash;upon this oat pile&mdash;doing my bit&mdash;for
Democracy. I'll begin to stink. They'll find me then.</p>
<p>Life glimmered away out of his weary eyes. He lay,
half-conscious, sprawled upon the oats. He thought of the
horse.</p>
<p>In this way the young checker, who had loaned him money, found
him. The checker knelt above him, supporting Eugene's head with
one hand, and putting a bottle of raw hard liquor to his mouth
with the other. When the boy had revived somewhat, the checker
helped him to descend the pile and walked slowly with him up the
long wooden platform of the pier.</p>
<p>They went across the road to a little grocery-store. The
checker ordered a bottle of milk, a box of crackers, and a big
block of cheese. As Eugene ate, the tears began to flow down his
grimy face, dredging dirty gullies on his skin. They were tears
of hunger and weakness: he could not restrain them.</p>
<p>The checker stood over him watchfully, with a kindly troubled
stare. He was a young man with a lantern jaw, and a thin dish
face: he wore scholarly spectacles, and smoked a pipe
reflectively.</p>
<p>"Why didn't you tell me, boy? I'd have let you have the
money," he said.</p>
<p>"I&mdash;don't&mdash;know," said Eugene, between bites of
cheese. "Couldn't."</p>
<p>With the checker's loan of five dollars he and Sinker Jordan
lived until pay-day. Then, after dining together on four pounds
of steak, Sinker Jordan departed for Altamont and the enjoyment
of an inheritance which had fallen due a few days before, on his
twenty- first birthday. Eugene stayed on.</p>
<p>He was like a man who had died, and had been re-born. All that
had gone before lived in a ghostly world. He thought of his
family, of Ben, of Laura James, as if they were ghosts. The world
itself turned ghost. All through that month of August, while the
war marched to its ending, he looked upon its dying carnival.
Nothing seemed any longer hard and hot and raw and new.
Everything was old. Everything was dying. A vast aerial music,
forever far- faint, like the language of his forgotten world,
sounded in his ears. He had known birth. He had known pain and
love. He had known hunger. Almost he had known death.</p>
<p>At night, when he was not called back to work he rode out by
trolley to one of the Virginia beaches. But the only sound that
was real, that was near and present, was the sound in his heart,
in his brain, of the everlasting sea. He turned his face toward
it: behind him, the cheap million lights of the concessionaires,
the clatter, the racket, the confetti, the shrill blare of the
saxophones, all the harsh joyless noise of his country, was
softened, was made sad, far, and phantom. The wheeling merry-go-
round, the blaring dance-orchestra, played K-K-K-Katy Beautiful
Katy, Poor Little Buttercup, and Just a Baby's Prayer at
Twilight.</p>
<p>And that cheap music turned elfin and lovely; it was mixed
into magic&mdash;it became a part of the romantic and lovely
Virginias, of the surge of the sea, as it rolled in from the
eternal dark, across the beach, and of his own magnificent
sorrow&mdash;his triumphant loneliness after pain and love and
hunger.</p>
<p>His face was thin and bright as a blade, below the great
curling shock of his hair; his body as lean as a starved cat's;
his eyes bright and fierce.</p>
<p>O sea! (he thought) I am the hill-born, the prison-pent, the
ghost, the stranger, and I walk here at your side. O sea, I am
lonely like you, I am strange and far like you, I am sorrowful
like you; my brain, my heart, my life, like yours, have touched
strange shores. You are like a woman lying below yourself on the
coral floor. You are an immense and fruitful woman with vast
thighs and a great thick mop of curling woman's hair floating
like green moss above your belly. And you will bring me to the
happy land, you will wash me to glory in bright ships.</p>
<p>There by the sea of the dark Virginias, he thought of the
forgotten faces, of all the million patterns of himself, the
ghost of his lost flesh. The child that heard Swain's cow, the
lost boy in the Ozarks, the carrier of news among the blacks, and
the boy who went in by the lattice with Jim Trivett. And the
waitress, and Ben, and Laura? Dead, too? Where? How? Why? Why has
the web been woven? Why do we die so many deaths? How came I here
beside the sea? O lost, O far and lonely, where?</p>
<p>Sometimes, as he walked back among the dancers, a scarecrow in
flapping rags, he looked and saw himself among them. He seemed to
be two people: he constantly saw himself with dark bent face
sitting upon the top rail of a fence, watching himself go by with
a bright herd of young people. He saw himself among the crowds,
several inches shorter than he was, fitting comfortably into a
world where everything was big enough for him.</p>
<p>And while he stared and saw himself beloved and admitted, he
heard them laugh: he felt suddenly the hard white ring of their
faces about him, and he plunged away, with cursing mouth.</p>
<p>O my sweet bitches! My fine cheap sluts! You little crawling
itch of twiddlers: you will snigger at me! At me! At me! (He beat
his hands against his ribs.) You will mock at me, with your
drug-store pimps, your Jazz-bo apes, your gorilla gobs, you cute
little side- porch chippies! What do you understand? The lust of
a goat, the stink of your kind&mdash;that does for you, my girls.
And yet you laugh at me! Ah, but I'll tell you why you laugh: you
are afraid of me because I am not like the others. You hate me
because I do not belong. You see I am finer and greater than any
one you know: you cannot reach me and you hate me. That's it! The
ethereal (yet manly) beauty of my features, my boyish charm (for
I am Just a Boy) blended with the tragic wisdom of my eyes (as
old as life and filled with the brooding tragedy of the ages),
the sensitive and delicate flicker of my mouth, and my marvellous
dark face blooming inward on strange loveliness like a
flower&mdash;all this you want to kill because you cannot touch
it. Ah me! (Thinking of his strange beauty, his eyes grew moist
with love and glory, and he was forced to blow his nose.) Ah, but
She will know. The love of a lady. Proudly, with misty eyes, he
saw her standing beside him against the rabble: her elegant small
head, wound with a bracelet of bright hair, against his shoulder,
and with two splendid pearls in her ears. Dearest! Dearest! We
stand here on a star. We are beyond them now. Behold! They
shrink, they fade, they pass&mdash;victorious, enduring,
marvellous love, my dearest, we remain.</p>
<p>Brooding thus on the vision of his own beauty, stirred by his
own heroic music, with misty eyes, he would pass over into the
forbidden settlement, with its vigilant patrols of naval and
military police on the watch for their own, and prowl softly down
a dark little street to a dingy frame house with drawn blinds,
where dwelt a love that for three dollars could be bought and
clothed with his own fable. Her name was Stella Blake. She was
never in a hurry.</p>
<p>With her lived a young corn-haired girl of twenty years whose
family lived in Pulpit Hill. Sometimes he went to see her.</p>
<p>Twice a week the troops went through. They stood densely in
brown and weary thousands on the pier while a council of
officers, tabled at the gangways, went through their clearance
papers. Then, each below the sweating torture of his pack, they
were filed from the hot furnace of the pier into the hotter
prison of the ship. The great ships, with their motley jagged
patches of deception, waited in the stream: they slid in and out
in unending squadrons.</p>
<p>Sometimes the troops were black&mdash;labor regiments from
Georgia and Alabama; big gorilla bucks from Texas. They gleamed
with sweat and huge rich laughter: they were obedient as children
and called their cursing officers "boss."</p>
<p>"And don't you call me 'boss' again, you bastards!" screamed a
young Tennessee lieutenant, who had gone slowly insane during the
moving, as he nursed his charges through hell. They grinned at
him cheerfully, with affection, like good obedient children, as
he stamped, raving, up and down the pier. From time to time they
goaded him into a new frenzy with complaints about lost hats,
bayonets, small arms, and papers. Somehow he found things for
them; somehow he cursed his way through, keeping them in order.
They grinned affectionately, therefore, and called him boss.</p>
<p>"And what in Jesus' name have you done now?" he yelled, as a
huge black sergeant with several enlisted men, who had gathered
at the examiner's table, burst suddenly into loud roars of
grief.</p>
<p>The fiery lieutenant rushed at the table, cursing.</p>
<p>The sergeant and several enlisted men, all Texas darkies, had
come away from camp without a clean bill of health: they were
venereals and had not been cured.</p>
<p>"Boss," blubbered the big black sergeant, "we wants to go to
France. We don't want to git lef' in dis Gawd-dam hole."</p>
<p>(Nor do I blame them, thought Eugene.)</p>
<p>"I'll kill you! So help me God, I'll kill you!" screamed the
officer, hurling his trim cap upon the ground and stamping upon
it. But, a moment later, with a medical officer he was leading
them away for examination behind the great wall of sacked oats.
Five minutes later they emerged. The negroes were cavorting with
joy: they pressed around their fierce commander, seizing and
kissing his hand, fawning upon him, adoring him.</p>
<p>"You see," said the dish-faced checker, while he and Eugene
watched, "that's what it takes to hold a crowd of niggers. You
can't be nice to 'em. They'd do anything for that guy."</p>
<p>"He would for them," said Eugene.</p>
<p>These negroes, he thought, who came from Africa, were sold at
the block in Louisiana, and live in Texas, are now on their way
to France.</p>
<p>Mr. Finch, the chief checker with the ugly slit eyes,
approached Eugene with a smile of false warmth. His gray jaws
worked.</p>
<p>"I've got a job for you, Gant," he said. "Double-time pay. I
want you to get in on some of the easy money."</p>
<p>"What is it?" said Eugene.</p>
<p>"They're loading this ship with big stuff," said Mr. Finch.
"They're taking her into the stream to get it on. I want you to
go out with her. They'll take you off in a tug to-night."</p>
<p>The dish-faced checker, when jubilantly he told him of his
appointment, said:</p>
<p>"They asked me to go, but I wouldn't."</p>
<p>"Why not?" said Eugene.</p>
<p>"I don't want the money bad enough. They're loading her with
T. N. T. and nitro-glycerin. The niggers play baseball with those
cases. If they ever drop one, they'll bring you home in a
bucket."</p>
<p>"It's all in the day's work," said Eugene dramatically.</p>
<p>This was danger, war. He was definitely in on it, risking his
hide for Democracy. He was thrilled.</p>
<p>When the big freighter slid away from the pier, he stood in
the bow with spread legs, darting his eyes about with fierce
eagle glances. The iron decks blistered his feet through the thin
soles of his shoes. He did not mind. He was the captain.</p>
<p>She anchored seaward down the Roads, and the great barges were
nosed in by the tugs. All through the day, under a broiling sun,
they loaded her from the rocking barges: her huge yellow booms
swung up and down; by nightfall she rode deeply in the water,
packed to her throat with shells and powder, and bearing on the
hot plates of her deck 1200 grisly tons of field artillery.</p>
<p>Eugene stood with fierce appraising eyes, walking about the
guns with a sense of authority, jotting down numbers, items,
pieces. From time to time he thrust a handful of moist
scrap-tobacco into his mouth, and chewed with an air of relish.
He spat hot sizzling gobs upon the iron deck. God! thought he.
This is man's work. Heave-ho, ye black devils! There's a war on!
He spat.</p>
<p>The tug came at nightfall and took him off. He sat apart from
the stevedores, trying to fancy the boat had come for him alone.
The lights went twinkling up the far Virginia shores. He spat
into the swirling waters.</p>
<p>When the trains slid in and out, the stevedores raised the
wooden bridges that spanned the tracks. Foot by foot, with
rhythmic pull and halt, the gangs tugged at the ropes, singing,
under the direction of their leader their song of love and
labor:</p>
<p>"Jelly Roll! (Heh!) Je-e-elly Roll."</p>
<p>They were great black men, each with his kept woman. They
earned fifty or sixty dollars a week.</p>
<p>Once or twice again, in the dying summer, Eugene went to
Norfolk. He saw the sailor, but he no longer tried to see Laura.
She seemed far and lost.</p>
<p>He had not written home all summer. He found a letter from
Gant, written in his father's Gothic sprawl&mdash;a sick and
feeble letter, written sorrowfully and far away. O lost! Eliza,
in the rush and business of the summer trade, had added a few
practical lines. Save his money. Get plenty of good food. Keep
well. Be a good boy.</p>
<p>The boy was a lean column of brown skin and bone. He had lost
over thirty pounds during the summer: he was over six foot four
and weighed little more than one hundred and thirty pounds.</p>
<p>The sailor was shocked at his emaciation, and bullied him with
blustering reproof:</p>
<p>"Why didn't you t-t-tell me where you were, idiot? I'd have
sent you money. For G-g-god's sake! Come on and eat!" They
ate.</p>
<p>The summer waned. When September came, Eugene quit his work
and, after a luxurious day or two in Norfolk, started homeward.
But, at Richmond, where there was a wait of three hours between
trains, he changed his plans suddenly and went to a good
hotel.</p>
<p>He was touched with pride and victory. In his pockets he had
$130 that he had won hardily by his own toil. He had lived alone,
he had known pain and hunger, he had survived. The old hunger for
voyages fed at his heart. He thrilled to the glory of the secret
life. The fear of the crowd, a distrust and hatred of group life,
a horror of all bonds that tied him to the terrible family of the
earth, called up again the vast Utopia of his loneliness. To go
alone, as he had gone, into strange cities; to meet strange
people and to pass again before they could know him; to wander,
like his own legend, across the earth&mdash;it seemed to him
there could be no better thing than that.</p>
<p>He thought of his own family with fear, almost with hatred. My
God! Am I never to be free? he thought. What have I done to
deserve this slavery? Suppose&mdash;suppose I were in China, or
in Africa, or at the South Pole. I should always be afraid of his
dying while I was away. (He twisted his neck as he thought of
it.) And how they would rub it in to me if I were not there!
Enjoying yourself in China (they would say) while your father was
dying. Unnatural son! Yes, but curse them! Why should I be there?
Can they not die alone? Alone! O God, is there no freedom on this
earth?</p>
<p>With quick horror, he saw that such freedom lay a weary world
away, and could be bought by such enduring courage as few men
have.</p>
<p>He stayed in Richmond several days, living sumptuously in the
splendid hotel, eating from silver dishes in the grill, and
roaming pleasantly through the wide streets of the romantic old
town, to which he had come once as a Freshman at Thanksgiving,
when the university's team had played Virginia there. He spent
three days trying to seduce a waitress in an ice-cream and
candy-store: he lured her finally to a curtained booth in a
chop-suey restaurant, only to have his efforts fail when the
elaborate meal he had arranged for with the Chinaman aroused her
distaste because it had onions in it.</p>
<p>Before he went home he wrote an enormous letter to Laura James
at Norfolk, a pitiable and boasting letter which rose at its end
to an insane crow: "I was there all summer and I never looked you
up. You were not decent enough to answer my letters; I saw no
reason why I should bother with you any more. Besides, the world
is full of women; I got my share and more this summer."</p>
<p>He mailed the letter, with a sense of malevolent triumph. But
the moment the iron lid of the box clanged over it, his face was
contorted by shame and remorse: he lay awake, writhing as he
recalled the schoolboy folly of it. She had beaten him again.</p>
<h3>34</h3>
<p>Eugene returned to Altamont two weeks before the term began at
Pulpit Hill. The town and the nation seethed in the yeasty
ferment of war. The country was turning into one huge camp. The
colleges and universities were being converted into
training-camps for officers. Every one was "doing his bit."</p>
<p>It had been a poor season for tourists. Eugene found Dixieland
almost deserted, save for a glum handful of regular or
semi-regular guests. Mrs. Pert was there, sweet, gentle, a trifle
more fuzzy than usual. Miss Newton, a wrenny and neurotic old
maid, with asthma, who had gradually become Eliza's unofficial
assistant in the management of the house, was there. Miss Malone,
the gaunt drug-eater with the loose gray lips, was there. Fowler,
a civil engineer with blond hair and a red face, who came and
departed quietly, leaving a sodden stench of corn-whiskey in his
wake, was there. Gant, who had now moved definitely from the
house on Woodson Street, which he had rented, to a big back room
at Eliza's, was there&mdash;a little more waxen, a little more
petulant, a little feebler than he had been before. And Ben was
there.</p>
<p>He had been home for a week or two when Eugene arrived. He had
been rejected again by both army and navy examining boards, he
had been rejected as unfit in the draft; he had left his work
suddenly in the tobacco town and come quietly and sullenly home.
He was thinner and more like old ivory than ever. He prowled
softly about the house, smoking innumerable cigarettes, cursing
in brief snarling fury, touched with despair and futility. His
old surly scowl was gone, his old angry mutter; his soft
contemptuous laugh, touched with so much hidden tenderness, had
given way to a contained but savage madness.</p>
<p>During the brief two weeks that Eugene remained at home before
departing again for Pulpit Hill, he shared with Ben a little room
and sleeping-porch upstairs. And the quiet one
talked&mdash;talked himself from a low fierce mutter into a
howling anathema of bitterness and hate that carried his voice,
high and passionate, across all the sleeping world of night and
rustling autumn.</p>
<p>"What have you been doing to yourself, you little fool?" he
began, looking at the boy's starved ribs. "You look like a
scarecrow."</p>
<p>"I'm all right," said Eugene. "I wasn't eating for a while.
But I didn't write them," he added proudly. "They thought I
couldn't hold out by myself. But I did. I didn't ask for help.
And I came home with my own money. See?" He thrust his hand into
his pocket and pulled out his soiled roll of banknotes,
boastfully displaying it.</p>
<p>"Who wants to see your lousy little money?" Ben yelled
furiously. "Fool. You come back, looking like a dead man, as if
you'd done something to be proud of. What've you done? What've
you done except make a monkey of yourself?"</p>
<p>"I've paid my own way," Eugene cried resentfully, stung and
wounded. "That's what I've done."</p>
<p>"Ah-h," said Ben, with an ugly sneer, "you little fool! That's
what they've been after! Do you think you've put anything over on
them? Do you? Do you think they give a damn whether you die or
not, as long as you save them expense? What are you bragging
about? Don't brag until you've got something out of them."</p>
<p>Propped on his arm, he smoked deeply, in bitter silence, for a
moment. Then more quietly, he continued.</p>
<p>"No, 'Gene. Get it out of them any way you can. Make them give
it to you. Beg it, take it, steal it&mdash;only get it somehow.
If you don't, they'll let it rot. Get it, and get away from them.
Go away and don't come back. To hell with them!" he yelled.</p>
<p>Eliza, who had come softly upstairs to put out the lights, and
had been standing for a moment outside the door, rapped gently
and entered. Clothed in a tattered old sweater and indefinable
under- lappings, she stood for a moment with folded hands,
peering in on them with a white troubled face.</p>
<p>"Children," she said, pursing her lips reproachfully, and
shaking her head, "it's time every one was in bed. You're keeping
the whole house awake with your talk."</p>
<p>"Ah-h," said Ben with an ugly laugh, "to hell with them."</p>
<p>"I'll vow, child!" she said fretfully. "You'll break us up.
Have you got that porch light on, too?" Her eyes probed about
suspiciously. "What on earth do you mean by burning up all that
electricity!"</p>
<p>"Oh, listen to this, won't you?" said Ben, jerking his head
upward with a jeering laugh.</p>
<p>"I can't afford to pay all these bills," said Eliza angrily,
with a smart shake of her head. "And you needn't think I can. I'm
not going to put up with it. It's up to us all to economize."</p>
<p>"Oh, for God's sake!" Ben jeered. "Economize! What for? So you
can give it all away to Old Man Doak for one of his lots?"</p>
<p>"Now, you needn't get on your high-horse," said Eliza. "You're
not the one who has to pay the bills. If you did, you'd laugh out
of the other side of your mouth. I don't like any such talk.
You've squandered every penny you've earned because you've never
known the value of a dollar."</p>
<p>"Ah-h!" he said. "The value of a dollar! By God, I know the
value of a dollar better than you do. I've had a little something
out of mine, at any rate. What have you had out of yours? I'd
like to know that. What the hell's good has it ever been to any
one? Will you tell me that?" he yelled.</p>
<p>"You may sneer all you like," said Eliza sternly, "but if it
hadn't been for your papa and me accumulating a little property,
you'd never have had a roof to call your own. And this is the
thanks I get for all my drudgery in my old age," she said,
bursting into tears. "Ingratitude! Ingratitude!"</p>
<p>"Ingratitude!" he sneered. "What's there to be grateful for?
You don't think I'm grateful to you or the old man for anything,
do you? What have you ever given me? You let me go to hell from
the time I was twelve years old. No one has ever given me a
damned nickel since then. Look at your kid here. You've let him
run around the country like a crazy man. Did you think enough of
him this summer to send him a post-card? Did you know where he
was? Did you give a damn, as long as there was fifty cents to be
made out of your lousy boarders?"</p>
<p>"Ingratitude!" she whispered huskily, with a boding shake of
the head. "A day of reckoning cometh."</p>
<p>"Oh, for God's sake!" he said, with a contemptuous laugh. He
smoked for a moment. Then he went on quietly:</p>
<p>"No, mama. You've done very little to make us grateful to you.
The rest of us ran around wild and the kid grew up here among the
dope-fiends and street-walkers. You've pinched every penny and
put all you've had into real estate which has done no one any
good. So don't wonder if your kids aren't grateful to you."</p>
<p>"Any son who will talk that way to his mother," said Eliza
with rankling bitterness, "is bound to come to a bad end. Wait
and see!"</p>
<p>"The hell you say!" he sneered. They stared at each other with
hard bitter eyes. He turned away in a moment, scowling with
savage annoyance, but stabbed already with fierce regret.</p>
<p>"All right! Go on, for heaven's sake! Leave us alone! I don't
want you around!" He lit a cigarette to show his indifference.
The lean white fingers trembled, and the flame went out.</p>
<p>"Let's stop it!" said Eugene wearily. "Let's stop it! None of
us is going to change! Nothing's going to get any better. We're
all going to be the same. We've said all this before. So, for
God's sake, let's stop it! Mama, go to bed, please. Let's all go
to bed and forget about it." He went to her, and with a strong
sense of shame, kissed her.</p>
<p>"Well, good-night, son," said Eliza slowly, with gravity. "If
I were you I'd put the light out now and turn in. Get a good
night's sleep, boy. You mustn't neglect your health."</p>
<p>She kissed him, and went away without another glance at the
older boy. He did not look at her. They were parted by hard and
bitter strife.</p>
<p>After a moment, when she had gone, Ben said without anger:</p>
<p>"I've had nothing out of life. I've been a failure. I've
stayed here with them until I'm done for. My lungs are going:
they won't even take a chance on me for the army. They won't even
give the Germans a chance to shoot at me. I've never made good at
anything. By God!" he said, in a mounting blaze of passion.
"What's it all about? Can you figure it out, 'Gene? Is it really
so, or is somebody playing a joke on us? Maybe we're dreaming all
this. Do you think so?"</p>
<p>"Yes," said Eugene, "I do. But I wish they'd wake us up." He
was silent, brooding over his thin bare body, bent forward on the
bed for a moment. "Maybe," he said slowly, "maybe&mdash;there's
nothing, nobody to wake."</p>
<p>"To hell with it all!" said Ben. "I wish it were over."</p>
<p>Eugene returned to Pulpit Hill in a fever of war excitement.
The university had been turned into an armed camp. Young men who
were eighteen years old were being admitted into the officers'
training corps. But he was not yet eighteen. His birthday was two
weeks off. In vain he implored the tolerance of the examining
board. What did two weeks matter? Could he get in as soon as his
birthday arrived? They told him he could not. What, then, could
he do? They told him that he must wait until there was another
draft. How long would that be? Only two or three months, they
assured him. His wilted hope revived. He chafed impatiently. All
was not lost.</p>
<p>By Christmas, with fair luck, he might be eligible for service
in khaki: by Spring, if God was good, all the proud privileges of
trench-lice, mustard gas, spattered brains, punctured lungs,
ripped guts, asphyxiation, mud and gangrene, might be his. Over
the rim of the earth he heard the glorious stamp of the feet, the
fierce sweet song of the horns. With a tender smile of love for
his dear self, he saw himself wearing the eagles of a colonel on
his gallant young shoulders. He saw himself as Ace Gant, the
falcon of the skies, with 63 Huns to his credit by his nineteenth
year. He saw himself walking up the Champs-Elys&eacute;es, with a
handsome powdering of gray hair above his temples, a left forearm
of the finest cork, and the luscious young widow of a French
marshal at his side. For the first time he saw the romantic charm
of mutilation. The perfect and unblemished heroes of his
childhood now seemed cheap to him&mdash;fit only to illustrate
advertisements for collars and toothpaste. He longed for that
subtle distinction, that air of having lived and suffered that
could only be attained by a wooden leg, a rebuilt nose, or the
seared scar of a bullet across his temple.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, he fed voraciously, and drank gallons of water in
an effort to increase his poundage. He weighed himself a
half-dozen times a day. He even made some effort at systematic
exercise: swinging his arms, bending from his hips, and so
on.</p>
<p>And he talked about his problem with the professors. Gravely,
earnestly, he wrestled with his soul, mouthing with gusto the
inspiring jargon of the crusade. For the present, said the
professors, was his Place not Here? Did his Conscience tell him
that he Had to go? If it did, they said gravely, they would say
nothing more. But had he considered the Larger Issues?</p>
<p>"Is not," said the Acting Dean persuasively, "is not this your
Sector? Is your own Front Line not here on the campus? Is it not
here that you must Go Over The Top? Oh, I know," he went on with
a smile of quiet pain, "I know it would be easier to go. I have
had to fight that battle myself. But we are all part of the Army
now; we are all enlisted in the Service of Liberty. We are all
Mobilized for Truth. And each must Do His Bit where it will count
for most."</p>
<p>"Yes," said Eugene, with a pale tortured face, "I know. I know
it's wrong. But oh, sir,&mdash;when I think of those murderous
beasts, when I think of how they have menaced All that we Hold
Dear, when I think of Little Belgium, and then of My Own Mother,
My Own Sister&mdash;" He turned away, clenching his hands, madly
in love with himself.</p>
<p>"Yes, yes," said the Acting Dean gently, "for boys with a
spirit like yours it's not easy."</p>
<p>"Oh, sir, it's hard!" cried Eugene passionately. "I tell you
it's hard."</p>
<p>"We must endure," said the Dean quietly. "We must be tempered
in the fire. The Future of Mankind hangs in the balance."</p>
<p>Deeply stirred they stood together for a moment, drenched in
the radiant beauty of their heroic souls.</p>
<p>Eugene was managing editor of the college paper. But, since
the editor was enlisted in the corps, the entire work of
publication fell to the boy. Every one was in the army. With the
exception of a few dozen ratty Freshmen, a few cripples, and
himself, every one, it seemed, was in the army. All of his
fraternity brothers, all of his college mates, who had not
previously enlisted, and many young men who had never before
thought of college, were in the army. "Pap" Rheinhart, George
Graves, Julius Arthur&mdash;who had experienced brief and
somewhat unfortunate careers at other universities, and a host of
young Altamonters who had never known a campus before, were all
enlisted now in the Student's Army.</p>
<p>During the first days, in the confusion of the new order,
Eugene saw a great deal of them. Then, as the cogs of the machine
began to grind more smoothly, and the university was converted
into a big army post, with its punctual monotony of drilling,
eating, studying, inspection, sleeping, he found himself
detached, alone, occupying a position of unique and isolated
authority.</p>
<p>He Carried On. He Held High the Torch. He Did His Bit. He was
editor, reporter, censor, factotum of the paper. He wrote the
news. He wrote the editorials. He seared them with flaming words.
He extolled the crusade. He was possessed of the inspiration for
murder.</p>
<p>He came and he went as he chose. When the barracks went dark
at night, he prowled the campus, contemptuous of the electric
flash and the muttered apologies of the officious shave-tails. He
roomed in the village with a tall cadaver, a gaunt medical
student with hollow cheeks and a pigeon-breast, named Heston.
Three or four times a week he was driven over the rutted highway
to Exeter where, in a little print shop, he drank the good warm
smell of ink and steel.</p>
<p>Later, he prowled up the dreary main street of the town as the
lights went up, ate at the Greek's, flirted with a few stray
furtive women until the place went dead at ten o'clock, and came
back through the dark countryside in a public-service car beside
a drunken old walrus who drove like a demon, and whose name was
"Soak" Young.</p>
<p>October began, and a season of small cold rain. The earth was
a sodden reek of mud and rotten leaves. The trees dripped wearily
and incessantly. His eighteenth birthday came, and he turned
again, with a quivering tension, toward the war.</p>
<p>He got a brief sick letter from his father; a few pages,
practical, concrete with her blunt pungent expression, from
Eliza:</p>
<p>"Daisy has been here with all her tribe. She went home two
days ago, leaving Caroline and Richard. They have all been down
sick with the flu. We've had a siege of it here. Every one has
had it, and you never know who's going to be next. It seems to
get the big strong ones first. Mr. Hanby, the Methodist minister,
died last week. Pneumonia set in. He was a fine healthy man in
the prime of life. The doctors said he was gone from the start.
Helen has been laid up for several days. Says it's her old kidney
trouble. They had McGuire in Thursday night. But they can't fool
me, no matter what they say. Son, I hope you will never surrender
to that awful craving. It has been the curse of my life. Your
papa seems to go along about the same as usual. He eats well, and
gets lots of sleep. I can't notice any change in him from a year
ago. He may be here long after some of the rest of us are under
the sod. Ben is still here. He mopes around the house all day and
complains of having no appetite. I think he needs to get to work
again doing something that will take his mind off himself. There
are only a few people left in the house. Mrs. Pert and Miss
Newton hang on as usual. The Crosbys have gone back to Miami. If
it gets much colder here I'll just pack up and go too. I guess I
must be getting old. I can't stand the cold the way I could when
I was young. I want you to buy yourself a good warm overcoat
before the winter sets in. You must also eat plenty of good
substantial food. Don't squander your money but..."</p>
<p>He heard nothing more for several weeks. Then, one drizzling
evening at six o'clock, when he returned to the room that he
occupied with Heston, he found a telegram. It read: "Come home at
once. Ben has pneumonia. Mother."</p>
<h3>35</h3>
<p>There was no train until the next day. Heston quieted him
during the evening with a stiff drink of gin manufactured from
alcohol taken from the medical laboratory. Eugene was silent and
babbled incoherently by starts: he asked the medical student a
hundred questions about the progress and action of the
disease.</p>
<p>"If it were double pneumonia she would have said so. Doesn't
it seem that way to you? Hey?" he demanded feverishly.</p>
<p>"I should think so," said Heston. He was a kind and quiet
boy.</p>
<p>Eugene went to Exeter the next morning to catch the train. All
through a dreary gray afternoon it pounded across the sodden
State. Then, there was a change and a terrible wait of several
hours at a junction. Finally, as dark came, he was being borne
again toward the hills.</p>
<p>Within his berth he lay with hot sleepless eyes, staring out
at the black mass of the earth, the bulk of the hills. Finally,
in the hours after midnight, he dropped into a nervous doze. He
was wakened by the clatter of the trucks as they began to enter
the Altamont yards. Dazed, half-dressed, he was roused by the
grinding halt, and a moment later was looking out through the
curtains into the grave faces of Luke and Hugh Barton.</p>
<p>"Ben's very sick," said Hugh Barton.</p>
<p>Eugene pulled on his shoes and dropped to the floor, stuffing
his collar and tie into a coat pocket.</p>
<p>"Let's go," he said. "I'm ready."</p>
<p>They went softly down the aisle, amid the long dark snores of
the sleepers. As they walked through the empty station toward
Hugh Barton's car, Eugene said to the sailor:</p>
<p>"When did you get home, Luke?"</p>
<p>"I came in last night," he said. "I've been here only a few
hours."</p>
<p>It was half-past three in the morning. The ugly station
settlement lay fixed and horrible, like something in a dream. His
strange and sudden return to it heightened his feeling of
unreality. In one of the cars lined at the station curbing, the
driver lay huddled below his blanket. In the Greek's lunchroom a
man sat sprawled faced downward on the counter. The lights were
dull and weary: a few burned with slow lust in the cheap
station-hotels.</p>
<p>Hugh Barton, who had always been a cautious driver, shot away
with a savage grinding of gears. They roared townward through the
rickety slums at fifty miles an hour.</p>
<p>"I'm afraid B-B-B-Ben is one sick boy," Luke began.</p>
<p>"How did it happen?" Eugene asked. "Tell me."</p>
<p>He had taken influenza, they told Eugene, from one of Daisy's
children. He had moped about, ill and feverish, for a day or two,
without going to bed.</p>
<p>"In that G-g-g-god dam cold barn," Luke burst out. "If that
boy dies it's because he c-c-c-couldn't keep warm."</p>
<p>"Never mind about that now," Eugene cried irritably, "go
on."</p>
<p>Finally he had gone to bed, and Mrs. Pert had nursed him for a
day or two.</p>
<p>"She was the only one who d-d-d-did a damn thing for him,"
said the sailor. Eliza, at length, had called in Cardiac.</p>
<p>"The d-d-damned old quack," Luke stuttered.</p>
<p>"Never mind! Never mind!" Eugene yelled. "Why dig it up now?
Get on with it!"</p>
<p>After a day or two, he had grown apparently convalescent, and
Cardiac told him he might get up if he liked. He got up and moped
about the house for a day, in a cursing rage, but the next day he
lay a-bed, with a high fever. Coker at length had been called in,
two days before&mdash;</p>
<p>"That's what they should have done at the start," growled Hugh
Barton over his wheel.</p>
<p>"Never mind!" screamed Eugene. "Get on with it."</p>
<p>And Ben had been desperately ill, with pneumonia in both
lungs, for over a day. The sad prophetic story, a brief and
terrible summary of the waste, the tardiness, and the ruin of
their lives, silenced them for a moment with its inexorable sense
of tragedy. They had nothing to say.</p>
<p>The powerful car roared up into the chill dead Square. The
feeling of unreality grew upon the boy. He sought for his life,
for the bright lost years, in this mean cramped huddle of brick
and stone. Ben and I, here by the City Hall, the Bank, the
grocery-store (he thought). Why here? In Gath or Ispahan. In
Corinth or Byzantium. Not here. It is not real.</p>
<p>A moment later, the big car sloped to a halt at the curb, in
front of Dixieland. A light burned dimly in the hall, evoking for
him chill memories of damp and gloom. A warmer light burned in
the parlor, painting the lowered shade of the tall window a warm
and mellow orange.</p>
<p>"Ben's in that room upstairs," Luke whispered, "where the
light is."</p>
<p>Eugene looked up with cold dry lips to the bleak front room
upstairs, with its ugly Victorian bay-window. It was next to the
sleeping-porch where, but three weeks before, Ben had hurled into
the darkness his savage curse at life. The light in the sickroom
burned grayly, bringing to him its grim vision of struggle and
naked terror.</p>
<p>The three men went softly up the walk and entered the house.
There was a faint clatter from the kitchen, and voices.</p>
<p>"Papa's in here," said Luke.</p>
<p>Eugene entered the parlor and found Gant seated alone before a
bright coal-fire. He looked up dully and vaguely as his son
entered.</p>
<p>"Hello, papa," said Eugene, going to him.</p>
<p>"Hello, son," said Gant. He kissed the boy with his bristling
cropped mustache. His thin lip began to tremble petulantly.</p>
<p>"Have you heard about your brother?" he snuffled. "To think
that this should be put upon me, old and sick as I am. O Jesus,
it's fearful&mdash;"</p>
<p>Helen came in from the kitchen.</p>
<p>"Hello, Slats," she said, heartily embracing him. "How are
you, honey? He's grown four inches more since he went away," she
jeered, sniggering. "Well, 'Gene, cheer up! Don't look so blue.
While there's life there's hope. He's not gone yet, you know."
She burst into tears, hoarse, unstrung, hysterical.</p>
<p>"To think that this must come upon me," Gant sniffled,
responding mechanically to her grief, as he rocked back and forth
on his cane and stared into the fire. "O boo-hoo-hoo! What have I
done that God should&mdash;"</p>
<p>"You shut up!" she cried, turning upon him in a blaze of fury.
"Shut your mouth this minute. I don't want to hear any more from
you! I've given my life to you! Everything's been done for you,
and you'll be here when we're all gone. You're not the one who's
sick." Her feeling toward him had, for the moment, gone rancorous
and bitter.</p>
<p>"Where's mama?" Eugene asked.</p>
<p>"She's back in the kitchen," Helen said. "I'd go back and say
hello before you see Ben if I were you." In a low brooding tone,
she continued: "Well, forget about it. It can't be helped
now."</p>
<p>He found Eliza busy over several bright bubbling pots of water
on the gas-stove. She bustled awkwardly about, and looked
surprised and confused when she saw him.</p>
<p>"Why, what on earth, boy! When'd you get in?"</p>
<p>He embraced her. But beneath her matter-of-factness, he saw
the terror in her heart: her dull black eyes glinted with bright
knives of fear.</p>
<p>"How's Ben, mama?" he asked quietly.</p>
<p>"Why-y," she pursed her lips reflectively, "I was just saying
to Doctor Coker before you came in. 'Look here,' I said. 'I tell
you what, I don't believe he's half as bad off as he looks. Now,
if only we can hold on till morning. I believe there's going to
be a change for the better.'"</p>
<p>"Mama, in heaven's name!" Helen burst out furiously. "How can
you bear to talk like that? Don't you know that Ben's condition
is critical? Are you never going to wake up?"</p>
<p>Her voice had its old cracked note of hysteria.</p>
<p>"Now, I tell you, son," said Eliza, with a white tremulous
smile, "when you go in there to see him, don't make out as if you
knew he was sick. If I were you, I'd make a big joke of it all.
I'd laugh just as big as you please and say, 'See here, I thought
I was coming to see a sick man. Why, pshaw!' (I'd say) 'there's
nothing wrong with you. Half of it's only imagination!'"</p>
<p>"O mama! for Christ's sake!" said Eugene frantically. "For
Christ's sake!"</p>
<p>He turned away, sick at heart, and caught at his throat with
his fingers.</p>
<p>Then he went softly upstairs with Luke and Helen, approaching
the sick-room with a shrivelled heart and limbs which had gone
cold and bloodless. They paused for a moment, whispering, before
he entered. The wretched conspiracy in the face of death filled
him with horror.</p>
<p>"N-n-n-now, I wouldn't stay but a m-m-m-minute," whispered
Luke. "It m-m-might make him nervous."</p>
<p>Eugene, bracing himself, followed Helen blindly into the
room.</p>
<p>"Look who's come to see you," her voice came heartily. "It's
Highpockets."</p>
<p>For a moment Eugene could see nothing, for dizziness and fear.
Then, in the gray shaded light of the room, he descried Bessie
Gant, the nurse, and the long yellow skull's-head of Coker,
smiling wearily at him, with big stained teeth, over a long
chewed cigar. Then, under the terrible light which fell directly
and brutally upon the bed alone, he saw Ben. And in that moment
of searing recognition he saw, what they had all seen, that Ben
was dying.</p>
<p>Ben's long thin body lay three-quarters covered by the
bedding; its gaunt outline was bitterly twisted below the covers,
in an attitude of struggle and torture. It seemed not to belong
to him, it was somehow distorted and detached as if it belonged
to a beheaded criminal. And the sallow yellow of his face had
turned gray; out of this granite tint of death, lit by two red
flags of fever, the stiff black furze of a three-day beard was
growing. The beard was somehow horrible; it recalled the corrupt
vitality of hair, which can grow from a rotting corpse. And Ben's
thin lips were lifted, in a constant grimace of torture and
strangulation, about his white somehow dead-looking teeth, as
inch by inch he gasped a thread of air into his lungs.</p>
<p>And the sound of this gasping&mdash;loud, hoarse, rapid,
unbelievable, filling the room, and orchestrating every moment in
it&mdash;gave to the scene its final note of horror.</p>
<p>Ben lay upon the bed below them, drenched in light, like some
enormous insect on a naturalist's table, fighting, while they
looked at him, to save with his poor wasted body the life that no
one could save for him. It was monstrous, brutal.</p>
<p>As Eugene approached, Ben's fear-bright eyes rested upon the
younger brother for the first time and bodilessly, without
support, he lifted his tortured lungs from the pillow, seizing
the boy's wrists fiercely in the hot white circle of his hands,
and gasping in strong terror like a child: "Why have you come?
Why have you come home, 'Gene?"</p>
<p>The boy stood white and dumb for a moment, while swarming pity
and horror rose in him.</p>
<p>"They gave us a vacation, Ben," he said presently. "They had
to close down on account of the flu."</p>
<p>Then he turned away suddenly into the black murk, sick with
his poor lie, and unable to face the fear in Ben's gray eyes.</p>
<p>"All right, 'Gene," said Bessie Gant, with an air of
authority. "Get out of here&mdash;you and Helen both. I've got
one crazy Gant to look after already. I don't want two more in
here." She spoke harshly, with an unpleasant laugh.</p>
<p>She was a thin woman of thirty-eight years, the wife of Gant's
nephew, Gilbert. She was of mountain stock: she was coarse, hard,
and vulgar, with little pity in her, and a cold lust for the
miseries of sickness and death. These inhumanities she cloaked
with her professionalism, saying:</p>
<p>"If I gave way to my feelings, where would the patient
be?"</p>
<p>When they got out into the hall again, Eugene said angrily to
Helen: "Why have you got that death's-head here? How can he get
well with her around? I don't like her!"</p>
<p>"Say what you like&mdash;she's a good nurse." Then, in a low
voice, she said: "What do you think?"</p>
<p>He turned away, with a convulsive gesture. She burst into
tears, and seized his hand.</p>
<p>Luke was teetering about restlessly, breathing stertorously
and smoking a cigarette, and Eliza, working her lips, stood with
an attentive ear cocked to the door of the sick-room. She was
holding a useless kettle of hot water.</p>
<p>"Huh? Hah? What say?" asked Eliza, before any one had said
anything. "How is he?" Her eyes darted about at them.</p>
<p>"Get away! Get away! Get away!" Eugene muttered savagely. His
voice rose. "Can't you get away?"</p>
<p>He was infuriated by the sailor's loud nervous breathing, his
large awkward feet. He was angered still more by Eliza's useless
kettle, her futile hovering, her "huh?" and "hah?"</p>
<p>"Can't you see he's fighting for his breath? Do you want to
strangle him? It's messy! Messy! Do you hear?" His voice rose
again.</p>
<p>The ugliness and discomfort of the death choked him; and the
swarming family, whispering outside the door, pottering uselessly
around, feeding with its terrible hunger for death on Ben's
strangulation, made him mad with alternate fits of rage and
pity.</p>
<p>Indecisively, after a moment, they went downstairs, still
listening for sounds in the sick-room.</p>
<p>"Well, I tell you," Eliza began hopefully. "I have a feeling,
I don't know what you'd call it&mdash;" She looked about
awkwardly and found herself deserted. Then she went back to her
boiling pots and pans.</p>
<p>Helen, with contorted face, drew him aside, and spoke to him
in whispered hysteria, in the front hall.</p>
<p>"Did you see that sweater she's wearing? Did you see it? It's
filthy!" Her voice sank to a brooding whisper. "Did you know that
he can't bear to look at her? She came into the room yesterday,
and he grew perfectly sick. He turned his head away and said 'O
Helen, for God's sake, take her out of here.' You hear that,
don't you. Do you hear? He can't stand to have her come near him.
He doesn't want her in the room."</p>
<p>"Stop! Stop! For God's sake, stop!" Eugene said, clawing at
his throat.</p>
<p>The girl was for the moment insane with hatred and
hysteria.</p>
<p>"It may be a terrible thing to say, but if he dies I shall
hate her. Do you think I can forget the way she's acted? Do you?"
Her voice rose almost to a scream. "She's let him die here before
her very eyes. Why, only day before yesterday, when his
temperature was 104, she was talking to Old Doctor Doak about a
lot. Did you know that?"</p>
<p>"Forget about it!" he said frantically. "She'll always be like
that! It's not her fault. Can't you see that? O God, how
horrible! How horrible!"</p>
<p>"Poor old mama!" said Helen, beginning to weep. "She'll never
get over this. She's scared to death! Did you see her eyes? She
knows, of course she knows!"</p>
<p>Then suddenly, with mad brooding face, she said: "Sometimes I
think I hate her! I really think I hate her." She plucked at her
large chin, absently. "Well, we mustn't talk like this," she
said. "It's not right. Cheer up. We're all tired and nervous. I
believe he's going to get all right yet."</p>
<p>Day came gray and chill, with a drear reek of murk and fog.
Eliza bustled about eagerly, pathetically busy, preparing
breakfast. Once she hurried awkwardly upstairs with a kettle of
water, and stood for a second at the door as Bessie Gant opened
it, peering in at the terrible bed, with her white puckered face.
Bessie Gant blocked her further entrance, and closed the door
rudely. Eliza went away making flustered apologies.</p>
<p>For, what the girl had said was true, and Eliza knew it. She
was not wanted in the sick-room; the dying boy did not want to
see her. She had seen him turn his head wearily away when she had
gone in. Behind her white face dwelt this horror, but she made no
confession, no complaint. She bustled around doing useless things
with an eager matter-of-factness. And Eugene, choked with
exasperation at one moment, because of her heavy optimism, was
blind with pity the next when he saw the terrible fear and pain
in her dull black eyes. He rushed toward her suddenly, as she
stood above the hot stove, and seized her rough worn hand,
kissing it and babbling helplessly.</p>
<p>"O mama! Mama! It's all right! It's all right! It's all
right."</p>
<p>And Eliza, stripped suddenly of her pretenses, clung to him,
burying her white face in his coat sleeve, weeping bitterly,
helplessly, grievously, for the sad waste of the irrevocable
years&mdash;the immortal hours of love that might never be
relived, the great evil of forgetfulness and indifference that
could never be righted now. Like a child she was grateful for his
caress, and his heart twisted in him like a wild and broken
thing, and he kept mumbling:</p>
<p>"It's all right! It's all right! It's all
right!"&mdash;knowing that it was not, could never be, all
right.</p>
<p>"If I had known. Child, if I had known," she wept, as she had
wept long before at Grover's death.</p>
<p>"Brace up!" he said. "He'll pull through yet. The worst is
over."</p>
<p>"Well, I tell you," said Eliza, drying her eyes at once, "I
believe it is. I believe he passed the turning-point last night.
I was saying to Bessie&mdash;"</p>
<p>The light grew. Day came, bringing hope. They sat down to
breakfast in the kitchen, drawing encouragement from every scrap
of cheer doctor or nurse would give them. Coker departed, non-
committally optimistic. Bessie Gant came down to breakfast and
was professionally encouraging.</p>
<p>"If I can keep his damn family out of the room, he may have
some chance of getting well."</p>
<p>They laughed hysterically, gratefully, pleased with the
woman's abuse.</p>
<p>"How is he this morning?" said Eliza. "Do you notice any
improvement?"</p>
<p>"His temperature is lower, if that's what you mean."</p>
<p>They knew that a lower temperature in the morning was a fact
of no great significance, but they took nourishment from it:
their diseased emotion fed upon it&mdash;they had soared in a
moment to a peak of hopefulness.</p>
<p>"And he's got a good heart," said Bessie Gant. "If that holds
out, and he keeps fighting, he'll pull through."</p>
<p>"D-d-don't worry about his f-f-fighting," said Luke, in a rush
of eulogy. "That b-b-boy'll fight as long as he's g-g-got a
breath left in him."</p>
<p>"Why, yes," Eliza began, "I remember when he was a child of
seven&mdash;I know I was standing on the porch one day&mdash;the
reason I remember is Old Mr. Buckner had just come by with some
butter and eggs your papa had&mdash;"</p>
<p>"O my God!" groaned Helen, with a loose grin. "Now we'll get
it."</p>
<p>"Whah&mdash;whah!" Luke chortled crazily, prodding Eliza in
the ribs.</p>
<p>"I'll vow, boy!" said Eliza angrily. "You act like an idiot.
I'd be ashamed!"</p>
<p>"Whah&mdash;whah&mdash;whah!"</p>
<p>Helen sniggered, nudging Eugene.</p>
<p>"Isn't he crazy, though? Tuh-tuh-tuh-tuh-tuh." Then, with wet
eyes, she drew Eugene roughly into her big bony embrace.</p>
<p>"Poor old 'Gene. You always got on together, didn't you?
You'll feel it more than any of us."</p>
<p>"He's not b-b-buried yet," Luke cried heartily. "That boy may
be here when the rest of us are pushing d-d-daisies."</p>
<p>"Where's Mrs. Pert?" said Eugene. "Is she in the house?"</p>
<p>A strained and bitter silence fell upon them.</p>
<p>"I ordered her out," said Eliza grimly, after a moment. "I
told her exactly what she was&mdash;a whore." She spoke with the
old stern judiciousness, but in a moment her face began to work
and she burst into tears. "If it hadn't been for that woman I
believe he'd be well and strong to-day. I'll vow I do!"</p>
<p>"Mama, in heaven's name!" Helen burst out furiously. "How dare
you say a thing like that? She was the only friend he had: when
he was taken sick she nursed him hand and foot. Why, the idea!
The idea!" she panted in her indignation. "If it hadn't been for
Mrs. Pert he'd have been dead by now. Nobody else did anything
for him. You were willing enough, I notice, to keep her here and
take her money until he got sick. No, sir!" she declared with
emphasis. "Personally, I like her. I'm not going to cut her
now."</p>
<p>"It's a d-d-d-damn shame!" said Luke, staunch to his goddess.
"If it hadn't been for Mrs. P-P-P-Pert and you, Ben would be S.
O. L. Nobody else around here gave a damn. If he d-d-d-dies, it's
because he didn't get the proper care when it would have done him
some good. There's always been too d-d-damn much thought of
saving a nickel, and too d-d-damn little about flesh and
blood!"</p>
<p>"Well, forget about it!" said Helen wearily. "There's one
thing sure: I've done everything I could. I haven't been to bed
for two days. Whatever happens, I'll have no regrets on that
score." Her voice was filled with a brooding ugly
satisfaction.</p>
<p>"I know you haven't! I know that!" The sailor turned to Eugene
in his excitement, gesticulating. "That g-g-girl's worked her
fingers to the bone. If it hadn't been for her&mdash;" His eyes
got wet; he turned his head away and blew his nose.</p>
<p>"Oh, for Christ's sake!" Eugene yelled, springing up from the
table. "Stop it, won't you! Let's wait till later."</p>
<p>In this way, the terrible hours of the morning lengthened out,
while they spent themselves trying to escape from the tragic net
of frustration and loss in which they were caught. Their spirits
soared to brief moments of insane joy and exultancy, and plunged
into black pits of despair and hysteria. Eliza alone seemed
consistently hopeful. Trembling with exacerbated nerves, the
sailor and Eugene paced the lower hall, smoking incessant
cigarettes, bristling as they approached each other, ironically
polite when their bodies touched. Gant dozed in the parlor or in
his own room, waking and sleeping by starts, moaning petulantly,
detached, vaguely aware only of the meaning of events, and
resentful because of the sudden indifference to him. Helen went
in and out of the sick-room constantly, dominating the dying boy
by the power of her vitality, infusing him with moments of hope
and confidence. But when she came out, her hearty cheerfulness
was supplanted by the strained blur of hysteria; she wept,
laughed, brooded, loved, and hated by turns.</p>
<p>Eliza went only once into the room. She intruded with a
hotwater bag, timidly, awkwardly, like a child, devouring Ben's
face with her dull black eyes. But when above the loud labor of
his breath his bright eyes rested on her, his clawed white
fingers tightened their grip in the sheets, and he gasped
strongly, as if in terror:</p>
<p>"Get out! Out! Don't want you."</p>
<p>Eliza left the room. As she walked she stumbled a little, as
if her feet were numb and dead. Her white face had an ashen
tinge, and her dull eyes had grown bright and staring. As the
door closed behind her, she leaned against the wall and put one
hand across her face. Then, in a moment, she went down to her
pots again.</p>
<p>Frantically, angrily, with twitching limbs they demanded calm
and steady nerves from one another; they insisted that they keep
away from the sick-room&mdash;but, as if drawn by some terrible
magnet, they found themselves again and again outside the door,
listening, on tiptoe, with caught breath, with an insatiate
thirst for horror, to the hoarse noise of his gasping as he
strove to force air down into his strangled and cemented lungs.
And eagerly, jealously, they sought entrance to the room, waiting
their turn for carrying water, towels, supplies.</p>
<p>Mrs. Pert, from her refuge in the boarding-house across the
street, called Helen on the phone each half-hour, and the girl
talked to her while Eliza came from the kitchen into the hall,
and stood, hands folded, lips pursed, with eyes that sparkled
with her hate.</p>
<p>The girl cried and laughed as she talked.</p>
<p>"Well...that's all right, Fatty....You know how I feel about
it....I've always said that if he had one true friend in the
world, it's you...and don't think we're ALL ungrateful for what
you've done...."</p>
<p>During the pauses, Eugene could hear the voice of the other
woman across the wires, sobbing.</p>
<p>And Eliza said, grimly: "If she calls up again you let me talk
to her. I'll fix her!"</p>
<p>"Good heavens, mama!" Helen cried angrily. "You've done enough
already. You drove her out of the house when she'd done more for
him than all his family put together." Her big strained features
worked convulsively. "Why, it's ridiculous!"</p>
<p>Within Eugene, as he paced restlessly up and down the hall or
prowled through the house a-search for some entrance he had never
found, a bright and stricken thing kept twisting about like a
trapped bird. This bright thing, the core of him, his Stranger,
kept twisting its head about, unable to look at horror, until at
length it gazed steadfastly, as if under a dreadful hypnosis,
into the eyes of death and darkness. And his soul plunged
downward, drowning in that deep pit: he felt that he could never
again escape from this smothering flood of pain and ugliness,
from the eclipsing horror and pity of it all. And as he walked,
he twisted his own neck about, and beat the air with his arm like
a wing, as if he had received a blow in his kidneys. He felt that
he might be clean and free if he could only escape into a single
burning passion&mdash;hard, and hot, and glittering&mdash;of
love, hatred, terror, or disgust. But he was caught, he was
strangling, in the web of futility&mdash;there was no moment of
hate that was not touched by a dozen shafts of pity: impotently,
he wanted to seize them, cuff them, shake them, as one might a
trying brat, and at the same time to caress them, love them,
comfort them.</p>
<p>As he thought of the dying boy upstairs, the messy ugliness of
it&mdash;as they stood whimpering by while he
strangled&mdash;choked him with fury and horror. The old fantasy
of his childhood came back to him: he remembered his hatred of
the semi-private bathroom, his messy discomfort while he sat at
stool and stared at the tub filled with dirty wash, sloppily
puffed and ballooned by cold gray soapy water. He thought of this
as Ben lay dying.</p>
<p>Their hopes revived strongly in the forenoon when word came to
them that the patient's temperature was lower, his pulse
stronger, the congestion of the lungs slightly relieved. But at
one o'clock, after a fit of coughing, he grew delirious, his
temperature mounted, he had increasing difficulty in getting his
breath. Eugene and Luke raced to Wood's pharmacy in Hugh Barton's
car, for an oxygen tank. When they returned, Ben had almost
choked to death. Quickly they carried the tank into the room, and
placed it near his head. Bessie Gant seized the cone, and started
to put it over Ben's mouth, commanding him to breathe it in. He
fought it away tigerishly: curtly the nurse commanded Eugene to
seize his hands.</p>
<p>Eugene gripped Ben's hot wrists: his heart turned rotten. Ben
rose wildly from his pillows, wrenching like a child to get his
hands free, gasping horribly, his eyes wild with terror:</p>
<p>"No! No! 'Gene! 'Gene! No! No!"</p>
<p>Eugene caved in, releasing him and turning way, white-faced,
from the accusing fear of the bright dying eyes. Others held him.
He was given temporary relief. Then he became delirious
again.</p>
<p>By four o'clock it was apparent that death was near. Ben had
brief periods of consciousness, unconsciousness, and
delirium&mdash;but most of the time he was delirious. His
breathing was easier, he hummed snatches of popular songs, some
old and forgotten, called up now from the lost and secret adyts
of his childhood; but always he returned, in his quiet humming
voice, to a popular song of war- time&mdash;cheap, sentimental,
but now tragically moving: "Just a Baby's Prayer at
Twilight,"</p>
<blockquote>"...when lights are low.<br>
Poor baby's years"</blockquote>
<p>Helen entered the darkening room.</p>
<blockquote>"Are filled with tears."</blockquote>
<p>The fear had gone out of his eyes: above his gasping he looked
gravely at her, scowling, with the old puzzled child's stare.
Then, in a moment of fluttering consciousness, he recognized her.
He grinned beautifully, with the thin swift flicker of his
mouth.</p>
<p>"Hello, Helen! It's Helen!" he cried eagerly.</p>
<p>She came from the room with a writhen and contorted face,
holding the sobs that shook her until she was half-way down the
stairs.</p>
<p>As darkness came upon the gray wet day, the family gathered in
the parlor, in the last terrible congress before death, silent,
waiting. Gant rocked petulantly, spitting into the fire, making a
weak whining moan from time to time. One by one, at intervals,
they left the room, mounting the stairs softly, and listening
outside the door of the sick-room. And they heard Ben, as, with
incessant humming repetition, like a child, he sang his song,</p>
<blockquote>"There's a mother there at twilight<br>
Who's glad to know&mdash;"</blockquote>
<p>Eliza sat stolidly, hands folded, before the parlor fire. Her
dead white face had a curious carven look; the inflexible
solidity of madness.</p>
<p>"Well," she said at length, slowly, "you never know. Perhaps
this is the crisis. Perhaps&mdash;" her face hardened into
granite again. She said no more.</p>
<p>Coker came in and went at once, without speaking, to the
sick-room. Shortly before nine o'clock Bessie Gant came down.</p>
<p>"All right," she said quietly. "You had all better come up
now. This is the end."</p>
<p>Eliza got up and marched out of the room with a stolid face.
Helen followed her: she was panting with hysteria, and had begun
to wring her big hands.</p>
<p>"Now, get hold of yourself, Helen," said Bessie Gant
warningly. "This is no time to let yourself go."</p>
<p>Eliza went steadily upstairs, making no noise. But, as she
neared the room, she paused, as if listening for sounds within.
Faintly, in the silence, they heard Ben's song. And suddenly,
casting away all pretense, Eliza staggered, and fell against the
wall, turning her face into her hand, with a terrible wrenched
cry:</p>
<p>"O God! If I had known! If I had known!"</p>
<p>Then, weeping with bitter unrestraint, with the contorted and
ugly grimace of sorrow, mother and daughter embraced each other.
In a moment they composed themselves, and quietly entered the
room.</p>
<p>Eugene and Luke pulled Gant to his feet and supported him up
the stairs. He sprawled upon them, moaning in long quivering
exhalations.</p>
<p>"Mer-ci-ful God! That I should have to bear this in my old
age. That I should&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Papa! For God's sake!" Eugene cried sharply. "Pull yourself
together! It's Ben who's dying&mdash;not us! Let's try to behave
decently to him for once."</p>
<p>This served to quiet Gant for a moment. But as he entered the
room, and saw Ben lying in the semi-conscious coma that precedes
death, the fear of his own death overcame him, and he began to
moan again. They seated him in a chair, at the foot of the bed,
and he rocked back and forth, weeping:</p>
<p>"O Jesus! I can't bear it! Why must you put this upon me? I'm
old and sick, and I don't know where the money's to come from.
How are we ever going to face this fearful and croo-el winter?
It'll cost a thousand dollars before we're through burying him,
and I don't know where the money's to come from." He wept
affectedly with sniffling sobs.</p>
<p>"Hush! hush!" cried Helen, rushing at him. In her furious
anger, she seized him and shook him. "You damned old man you, I
could kill you! How dare you talk like that when your son's
dying? I've wasted six years of my life nursing you, and you'll
be the last one to go!" In her blazing anger, she turned
accusingly on Eliza:</p>
<p>"You've done this to him. You're the one that's responsible.
If you hadn't pinched every penny he'd never have been like this.
Yes, and Ben would be here, too!" She panted for breath for a
moment. Eliza made no answer. She did not hear her.</p>
<p>"After this, I'm through! I've been looking for you to
die&mdash;and Ben's the one who has to go." Her voice rose to a
scream of exasperation. She shook Gant again. "Never again! Do
you hear that, you selfish old man? You've had
everything&mdash;Ben's had nothing. And now he's the one to go. I
hate you!"</p>
<p>"Helen! Helen!" said Bessie Gant quietly. "Remember where you
are."</p>
<p>"Yes, that means a lot to us," Eugene muttered bitterly.</p>
<p>Then, over the ugly clamor of their dissension, over the rasp
and snarl of their nerves, they heard the low mutter of Ben's
expiring breath. The light had been re-shaded: he lay, like his
own shadow, in all his fierce gray lonely beauty. And as they
looked and saw his bright eyes already blurred with death, and
saw the feeble beating flutter of his poor thin breast, the
strange wonder, the dark rich miracle of his life surged over
them its enormous loveliness. They grew quiet and calm, they
plunged below all the splintered wreckage of their lives, they
drew together in a superb communion of love and valiance, beyond
horror and confusion, beyond death.</p>
<p>And Eugene's eyes grew blind with love and wonder: an enormous
organ-music sounded in his heart, he possessed them for a moment,
he was a part of their loveliness, his life soared magnificently
out of the slough and pain and ugliness. He thought:</p>
<p>"That was not all! That really was not all!"</p>
<p>Helen turned quietly to Coker, who was standing in shadow by
the window, chewing upon his long unlighted cigar.</p>
<p>"Is there nothing more you can do? Have you tried everything?
I mean&mdash;EVERYTHING?"</p>
<p>Her voice was prayerful and low. Coker turned toward her
slowly, taking the cigar between his big stained fingers. Then,
gently, with his weary yellow smile, he answered: "Everything.
Not all the king's horses, not all the doctors and nurses in the
world, can help him now."</p>
<p>"How long have you known this?" she said.</p>
<p>"For two days," he answered. "From the beginning." He was
silent for a moment. "For ten years!" he went on with growing
energy. "Since I first saw him, at three in the morning, in the
Greasy Spoon, with a doughnut in one hand and a cigarette in the
other. My dear, dear girl," he said gently as she tried to speak,
"we can't turn back the days that have gone. We can't turn life
back to the hours when our lungs were sound, our blood hot, our
bodies young. We are a flash of fire&mdash;a brain, a heart, a
spirit. And we are three-cents-worth of lime and iron&mdash;which
we cannot get back."</p>
<p>He picked up his greasy black slouch hat, and jammed it
carelessly upon his head. Then he fumbled for a match and lit the
chewed cigar.</p>
<p>"Has everything been done?" she said again. "I want to know!
Is there anything left worth trying?"</p>
<p>He made a weary gesture of his arms.</p>
<p>"My dear girl!" he said. "He's drowning! Drowning!"</p>
<p>She stood frozen with the horror of his pronouncement.</p>
<p>Coker looked for a moment at the gray twisted shadow on the
bed. Then, quietly, sadly, with tenderness and tired wonder, he
said: "Old Ben. When shall we see HIS like again?"</p>
<p>Then he went quietly out, the long cigar clamped firmly in his
mouth.</p>
<p>In a moment, Bessie Gant, breaking harshly in upon their
silence with ugly and triumphant matter-of-factness, said: "Well,
it will be a relief to get this over. I'd rather be called into
forty outside cases than one in which any of these damn relations
are concerned. I'm dead for sleep."</p>
<p>Helen turned quietly upon her.</p>
<p>"Leave the room!" she said. "This is our affair now. We have
the right to be left alone."</p>
<p>Surprised, Bessie Gant stared at her for a moment with an
angry, resentful face. Then she left the room.</p>
<p>The only sound in the room now was the low rattling mutter of
Ben's breath. He no longer gasped; he no longer gave signs of
consciousness or struggle. His eyes were almost closed; their
gray flicker was dulled, coated with the sheen of insensibility
and death. He lay quietly upon his back, very straight, without
sign of pain, and with a curious upturned thrust of his sharp
thin face. His mouth was firmly shut. Already, save for the
feeble mutter of his breath, he seemed to be dead&mdash;he seemed
detached, no part of the ugly mechanism of that sound which came
to remind them of the terrible chemistry of flesh, to mock at
illusion, at all belief in the strange passage and continuance of
life.</p>
<p>He was dead, save for the slow running down of the worn-out
machine, save for that dreadful mutter within him of which he was
no part. He was dead.</p>
<p>But in their enormous silence wonder grew. They remembered the
strange flitting loneliness of his life, they thought of a
thousand forgotten acts and moments&mdash;and always there was
something that now seemed unearthly and strange: he walked
through their lives like a shadow&mdash;they looked now upon his
gray deserted shell with a thrill of awful recognition, as one
who remembers a forgotten and enchanted word, or as men who look
upon a corpse and see for the first time a departed god.</p>
<p>Luke, who had been standing at the foot of the bed, now turned
to Eugene nervously, stammering in an unreal whisper of wonder
and disbelief:</p>
<p>"I g-g-g-guess Ben's gone."</p>
<p>Gant had grown very quiet: he sat in the darkness at the foot
of the bed, leaning forward upon his cane, escaped from the
revery of his own approaching death, into the waste land of the
past, blazing back sadly and poignantly the trail across the lost
years that led to the birth of his strange son.</p>
<p>Helen sat facing the bed, in the darkness near the windows.
Her eyes rested not on Ben but on her mother's face. All by
unspoken consent stood back in the shadows and let Eliza
repossess the flesh to which she had given life.</p>
<p>And Eliza, now that he could deny her no longer, now that his
fierce bright eyes could no longer turn from her in pain and
aversion, sat near his head beside him, clutching his cold hand
between her rough worn palms.</p>
<p>She did not seem conscious of the life around her. She seemed
under a powerful hypnosis: she sat very stiff and erect in her
chair, her white face set stonily, her dull black eyes fixed upon
the gray cold face.</p>
<p>They sat waiting. Midnight came. A cock crew. Eugene went
quietly to a window and stood looking out. The great beast of
night prowled softly about the house. The walls, the windows
seemed to bend inward from the thrusting pressure of the dark.
The low noise in the wasted body seemed almost to have stopped.
It came infrequently, almost inaudibly, with a faint fluttering
respiration.</p>
<p>Helen made a sign to Gant and Luke. They rose and went quietly
out. At the door she paused, and beckoned to Eugene. He went to
her.</p>
<p>"You stay here with her," she said. "You're her youngest. When
it's over come and tell us."</p>
<p>He nodded, and closed the door behind her. When they had gone,
he waited, listening for a moment. Then he went to where Eliza
was sitting. He bent over her.</p>
<p>"Mama!" he whispered. "Mama!"</p>
<p>She gave no sign that she had heard him. Her face did not
move; she did not turn her eyes from their fixed stare.</p>
<p>"Mama!" he said more loudly. "Mama!"</p>
<p>He touched her. She made no response.</p>
<p>"Mama! Mama!"</p>
<p>She sat there stiffly and primly like a little child.</p>
<p>Swarming pity rose in him. Gently, desperately, he tried to
detach her fingers from Ben's hand. Her rough clasp on the cold
hand tightened. Then, slowly, stonily, from right to left,
without expression, she shook her head.</p>
<p>He fell back, beaten, weeping, before that implacable gesture.
Suddenly, with horror, he saw that she was watching her own
death, that the unloosening grip of her hand on Ben's hand was an
act of union with her own flesh, that, for her, Ben was not
dying&mdash;but that a part of HER, of HER life, HER blood, HER
body, was dying. Part of her, the younger, the lovelier, the
better part, coined in her flesh, borne and nourished and begun
with so much pain there twenty-six years before, and forgotten
since, was dying.</p>
<p>Eugene stumbled to the other side of the bed and fell upon his
knees. He began to pray. He did not believe in God, nor in Heaven
or Hell, but he was afraid they might be true. He did not believe
in angels with soft faces and bright wings, but he believed in
the dark spirits that hovered above the heads of lonely men. He
did not believe in devils or angels, but he believed in Ben's
bright demon to whom he had seen him speak so many times.</p>
<p>Eugene did not believe in these things, but he was afraid they
might be true. He was afraid that Ben would get lost again. He
felt that no one but he could pray for Ben now: that the dark
union of their spirits made only HIS prayers valid. All that he
had read in books, all the tranquil wisdom he had professed so
glibly in his philosophy course, and the great names of Plato and
Plotinus, of Spinoza and Immanuel Kant, of Hegel and Descartes,
left him now, under the mastering surge of his wild Celtic
superstition. He felt that he must pray frantically as long as
the little ebbing flicker of breath remained in his brother's
body.</p>
<p>So, with insane sing-song repetition, he began to mutter over
and over again: "Whoever You Are, be good to Ben to-night. Show
him the way...Whoever You Are, be good to Ben to-night. Show him
the way..." He lost count of the minutes, the hours: he heard
only the feeble rattle of dying breath, and his wild synchronic
prayer.</p>
<p>Light faded from his brain, and consciousness. Fatigue and
powerful nervous depletion conquered him. He sprawled out on the
floor, with his arms pillowed on the bed, muttering drowsily.
Eliza, unmoving, sat across the bed, holding Ben's hand. Eugene,
mumbling, sank into an uneasy sleep.</p>
<p>He awoke suddenly, conscious that he had slept, with a sharp
quickening of horror. He was afraid that the little fluttering
breath had now ceased entirely, that the effect of his prayer was
lost. The body on the bed was almost rigid: there was no sound.
Then, unevenly, without rhythm, there was a faint mutter of
breath. He knew it was the end. He rose quickly and ran to the
door. Across the hall, in a cold bedroom, on two wide beds, Gant,
Luke, and Helen lay exhausted.</p>
<p>"Come," cried Eugene. "He's going now."</p>
<p>They came quickly into the room. Eliza sat unmoving, oblivious
of them. As they entered the room, they heard, like a faint
expiring sigh, the final movement of breath.</p>
<p>The rattling in the wasted body, which seemed for hours to
have given over to death all of life that is worth saving, had
now ceased. The body appeared to grow rigid before them. Slowly,
after a moment, Eliza withdrew her hands. But suddenly,
marvellously, as if his resurrection and rebirth had come upon
him, Ben drew upon the air in a long and powerful respiration;
his gray eyes opened. Filled with a terrible vision of all death
to the dark spirit who had brooded upon each footstep of his
pillows without support&mdash;a flame, a light, a
glory&mdash;joined at length in death to the dark spirit who had
brooded upon each footstep of his lonely adventure on earth; and,
casting the fierce sword of his glance with utter and final
comprehension upon the room haunted with its gray pageantry of
cheap loves and dull consciences and on all those uncertain
mummers of waste and confusion fading now from the bright window
of his eyes, he passed instantly, scornful and unafraid, as he
had lived, into the shades of death.</p>
<p>We can believe in the nothingness of life, we can believe in
the nothingness of death and of life after death&mdash;but who
can believe in the nothingness of Ben? Like Apollo, who did his
penance to the high god in the sad house of King Admetus, he
came, a god with broken feet, into the gray hovel of this world.
And he lived here a stranger, trying to recapture the music of
the lost world, trying to recall the great forgotten language,
the lost faces, the stone, the leaf, the door.</p>
<p>O Artemidorus, farewell!</p>
<h3>36</h3>
<p>In that enormous silence, where pain and darkness met, some
birds were waking. It was October. It was almost four o'clock in
the morning. Eliza straightened out Ben's limbs, and folded his
hands across his body. She smoothed out the rumpled covers of the
bed, and patted out the pillows, making a smooth hollow for his
head to rest in. His flashing hair, cropped close to his
well-shaped head, was crisp and crinkly as a boy's, and shone
with bright points of light. With a pair of scissors, she snipped
off a little lock where it would not show.</p>
<p>"Grover's was black as a raven's without a kink in it. You'd
never have known they were twins," she said.</p>
<p>They went downstairs to the kitchen.</p>
<p>"Well, Eliza," said Gant, calling her by name for the first
time in thirty years, "you've had a hard life. If I'd acted
different, we might have got along together. Let's try to make
the most of what time's left. Nobody is blaming you. Taking it
all in all, you've done pretty well."</p>
<p>"There are a great many things I'd like to do over again,"
said Eliza gravely. She shook her head. "We never know."</p>
<p>"We'll talk about it some other time," said Helen. "I guess
every one is worn out. I know I am. I'm going to get some sleep.
Papa, go on to bed, in heaven's name! There's nothing you can do
now. Mama, I think you'd better go, too&mdash;"</p>
<p>"No," said Eliza, shaking her head. "You children go on. I
couldn't sleep now anyway. There are too many things to do. I'm
going to call up John Hines now."</p>
<p>'Tell him," said Gant, "to spare no expense. I'll foot the
bills."</p>
<p>"Well," said Helen, "whatever it costs, let's give Ben a good
funeral. It's the last thing we can ever do for him. I want to
have no regrets on that score."</p>
<p>"Yes," said Eliza, nodding slowly. "I want the best one that
money will buy. I'll make arrangements with John Hines when I
talk to him. You children go on to bed now."</p>
<p>"Poor old 'Gene," said Helen, laughing. "He looks like the
last rose of summer. He's worn out. You pile in and get some
sleep, honey."</p>
<p>"No," he said, "I'm hungry. I haven't had anything to eat
since I left the university."</p>
<p>"Well, for G-G-G-God's sake!" Luke stuttered. "Why didn't you
speak, idiot? I'd have got you something. Come on," he said,
grinning. "I wouldn't mind a bite myself. Let's go uptown and
eat."</p>
<p>"Yes," said Eugene. "I'd like to get out for a while from the
bosom of the family circle."</p>
<p>They laughed crazily. He poked around the stove for a moment,
peering into the oven.</p>
<p>"Huh? Hah? What are you after, boy?" said Eliza
suspiciously.</p>
<p>"What you got good to eat, Miss Eliza?" he said, leering
crazily at her. He looked at the sailor: they burst into loud
idiot laughter, pronging each other in the ribs. Eugene picked up
a coffee-pot half-filled with a cold weak wash, and sniffed at
it.</p>
<p>"By God!" he said. "That's one thing Ben's out of. He won't
have to drink mama's coffee any more."</p>
<p>"Whah-whah-whah!" said the sailor.</p>
<p>Gant grinned, wetting a thumb.</p>
<p>"You ought to be ashamed of yourself," said Helen, with a
hoarse snigger. "Poor old Ben!"</p>
<p>"Why, what's wrong with that coffee?" said Eliza, vexed. "It's
GOOD coffee."</p>
<p>They howled. Eliza pursed her lips for a moment.</p>
<p>"I don't like that way of talking, boy," she said. Her eyes
blurred suddenly. Eugene seized her rough hand and kissed it.</p>
<p>"It's all right, mama!" he said. "It's all right. I didn't
mean it!" He put his arms around her. She wept, suddenly and
bitterly.</p>
<p>"Nobody ever knew him. He never told us about himself. He was
the quiet one. I've lost them both now." Then, drying her eyes,
she added:</p>
<p>"You boys go get something to eat. A little walk will do you
good. And, say," she added, "why don't you go by The Citizen
office? They ought to be told. They've been calling up every day
to find out about him."</p>
<p>"They thought a lot of that boy," said Gant.</p>
<p>They were tired, but they all felt an enormous relief. For
over a day, each had known that death was inevitable, and after
the horror of the incessant strangling gasp, this peace, this end
of pain touched them all with a profound, a weary joy.</p>
<p>"Well, Ben's gone," said Helen slowly. Her eyes were wet, but
she wept quietly now, with gentle grief, with love. "I'm glad
it's over. Poor old Ben! I never got to know him until these last
few days. He was the best of the lot. Thank God, he's out of it
now."</p>
<p>Eugene thought of death now, with love, with joy. Death was
like a lovely and tender woman, Ben's friend and lover, who had
come to free him, to heal him, to save him from the torture of
life.</p>
<p>They stood there together, without speaking, in Eliza's
littered kitchen, and their eyes were blind with tears, because
they thought of lovely and delicate death, and because they loved
one another.</p>
<p>Eugene and Luke went softly up the hall, and out into the
dark. Gently, they closed the big front door behind them, and
descended the veranda steps. In that enormous silence, birds were
waking. It was a little after four o'clock in the morning. Wind
pressed the boughs. It was still dark. But above them the thick
clouds that had covered the earth for days with a dreary gray
blanket had been torn open. Eugene looked up through the deep
ragged vault of the sky and saw the proud and splendid stars,
bright and unwinking. The withered leaves were shaking.</p>
<p>A cock crew his shrill morning cry of life beginning and
awaking. The cock that crew at midnight (thought Eugene) had an
elfin ghostly cry. His crow was drugged with sleep and death: it
was like a far horn sounding under sea; and it was a warning to
all the men who are about to die, and to the ghosts that must go
home.</p>
<p>But the cock that crows at morning (he thought), has a voice
as shrill as any fife. It says, we are done with sleep. We are
done with death. O waken, waken into life, says his voice as
shrill as any fife. In that enormous silence, birds were
waking.</p>
<p>He heard the cock's bright minstrelsy again, and by the river
in the dark, the great thunder of flanged wheels, and the long
retreating wail of the whistle. And slowly, up the chill deserted
street, he heard the heavy ringing clangor of shod hoofs. In that
enormous silence, life was waking.</p>
<p>Joy awoke in him, and exultation. They had escaped from the
prison of death; they were joined to the bright engine of life
again. Life, ruddered life, that would not fail, began its myriad
embarkations.</p>
<p>A paper-boy came briskly, with the stiff hobbled limp that
Eugene knew so well, down the centre of the street, hurling a
blocked paper accurately upon the porch of the Brunswick. As he
came opposite Dixieland, he moved in to the curb, tossing his
fresh paper with a careful plop. He knew there was sickness in
the house.</p>
<p>The withered leaves were shaking.</p>
<p>Eugene jumped to the sidewalk from the sodded yard. He stopped
the carrier.</p>
<p>"What's your name, boy?" he said.</p>
<p>"Tyson Smathers," said the boy, turning upon him a steady
Scotch- Irish face that was full of life and business.</p>
<p>"My name is 'Gene Gant. Did you ever hear of me?"</p>
<p>"Yes," said Tyson Smathers, "I've heard of you. You had number
7."</p>
<p>"That was a long time ago," said Eugene, pompously, grinning.
"I was just a boy."</p>
<p>In that enormous silence, birds were waking.</p>
<p>He thrust his hand into a pocket and found a dollar-bill.</p>
<p>"Here," he said. "I carried the damn things once. Next to my
brother Ben, I was the best boy they ever had. Merry Christmas,
Tyson."</p>
<p>"It ain't Christmas yet," said Tyson Smathers.</p>
<p>"You're right, Tyson," said Eugene, "but it will be."</p>
<p>Tyson Smathers took the money, with a puzzled, freckled grin.
Then he went on down the street, throwing papers.</p>
<p>The maples were thin and sere. Their rotting leaves covered
the ground. But the trees were not leafless yet. The leaves were
quaking. Some birds began to chatter in the trees. Wind pressed
the boughs, the withered leaves were shaking. It was October.</p>
<p>As Luke and Eugene turned up the street toward town, a woman
came out of the big brick house across the street, and over the
yard toward them. When she got near, they saw she was Mrs. Pert.
It was October, but some birds were waking.</p>
<p>"Luke," she said fuzzily. "Luke? Is it Old Luke?"</p>
<p>"Yes," said Luke.</p>
<p>"And 'Gene? Is it old 'Gene?" She laughed gently, patting his
hand, peering comically at him with her bleared oaken eyes, and
swaying back and forth gravely, with alcoholic dignity. The
leaves, the withered leaves, were shaking, quaking. It was
October, and the leaves were shaking.</p>
<p>"They ran old Fatty away, 'Gene," she said. "They won't let
her come in the house any more. They ran her away because she
liked Old Ben. Ben. Old Ben." She swayed gently, vaguely
collecting her thought. "Old Ben. How's Old Ben, 'Gene?" she
coaxed. "Fatty wants to know."</p>
<p>"I'm m-m-m-mighty sorry, Mrs. P-P-P-Pert..." Luke began.</p>
<p>Wind pressed the boughs, the withered leaves were quaking.</p>
<p>"Ben's dead," said Eugene.</p>
<p>She stared at him for a moment, swaying on her feet</p>
<p>"Fatty liked Ben," she said gently, in a moment. "Fatty and
Old Ben were friends."</p>
<p>She turned and started unsteadily across the street, holding
one hand out gravely, for balance.</p>
<p>In that enormous silence, birds were waking. It was October,
but some birds were waking.</p>
<p>Then Luke and Eugene walked swiftly townward, filled with
great joy because they heard the sounds of life and daybreak. And
as they walked, they spoke often of Ben, with laughter, with old
pleasant memory, speaking of him not as of one who had died, but
as of a brother who had been gone for years, and was returning
home. They spoke of him with triumph and tenderness, as of one
who had defeated pain, and had joyously escaped. Eugene's mind
groped awkwardly about. It fumbled like a child, with little
things.</p>
<p>They were filled with a deep and tranquil affection for each
other: they talked without constraint, without affectation, with
quiet confidence and knowledge.</p>
<p>"Do you remember," Luke began, "the t-t-t-time he cut the hair
of Aunt Pett's orphan boy&mdash;Marcus?"</p>
<p>"He&mdash;used&mdash;a chamber-pot&mdash;to trim the edges,"
Eugene screamed, waking the street with wild laughter.</p>
<p>They walked along hilariously, greeting a few early
pedestrians with ironical obsequiousness, jeering pleasantly at
the world in brotherly alliance. Then they entered the relaxed
and weary offices of the paper which Ben had served so many
years, and gave their stick of news to the tired man there.</p>
<p>There was regret, a sense of wonder, in that office where the
swift record of so many days had died&mdash;a memory that would
not die, of something strange and passing.</p>
<p>"Damn! I'm sorry! He was a great boy!" said the men.</p>
<p>As light broke grayly in the empty streets, and the first car
rattled up to town, they entered the little beanery where he had
spent, in smoke and coffee, so many hours of daybreak.</p>
<p>Eugene looked in and saw them there, assembled as they had
been many years before, like the nightmare ratification of a
prophecy: McGuire, Coker, the weary counter-man, and, at the
lower end, the press-man, Harry Tugman.</p>
<p>Luke and Eugene entered, and sat down at the counter.</p>
<p>"Gentlemen, gentlemen," said Luke sonorously.</p>
<p>"Hello, Luke," barked McGuire. "Do you think you'll ever have
any sense? How are you, son? How's school?" he said to Eugene. He
stared at them for a moment, his wet cigarette plastered
comically on his full sag lip, his bleared eyes kindly and
drunken.</p>
<p>"General, how's the boy? What're you drinking these
days&mdash;turpentine or varnish?" said the sailor, tweaking him
roughly in his larded ribs. McGuire grunted.</p>
<p>"Is it over, son?" said Coker quietly.</p>
<p>"Yes," said Eugene.</p>
<p>Coker took the long cigar from his mouth and grinned
malarially at the boy.</p>
<p>"Feel better, don't you, son?" he said.</p>
<p>"Yes," said Eugene. "A hell of a lot."</p>
<p>"Well, Eugenics," said the sailor briskly, "what are you
eating?"</p>
<p>"What's the man got?" said Eugene, staring at the greasy card.
"Have you got any young roast whale left?"</p>
<p>"No," said the counter-man. "We did have some, but we run
out."</p>
<p>"How about the fricasseed bull?" said Luke. "Have you got any
of that?"</p>
<p>"You don't need any one to fricassee your bull, son," said
McGuire. "You've got plenty as it is."</p>
<p>Their bull-laughter bellowed in the beanery.</p>
<p>With puckered forehead, Luke stuttered over the menu.</p>
<p>"F-f-f-fried chicken a la Maryland," he muttered. "A la
Maryland?" he repeated as if puzzled. "Now, ain't that nice?" he
said, looking around with mincing daintiness.</p>
<p>"Bring me one of your this week's steaks," said Eugene, "well
done, with a meat-axe and the sausage-grinder."</p>
<p>"What do you want the sausage-grinder for, son?" said
Coker.</p>
<p>"That's for the mince pie," said Eugene.</p>
<p>"Make it two," said Luke, "with a coupla cups of Mock-a, just
like mother still makes."</p>
<p>He looked crazily around at Eugene, and burst into loud
whah-whahs, prodding him in the ribs.</p>
<p>"Where they got you stationed now, Luke?" said Harry Tugman,
peering up snoutily from a mug of coffee.</p>
<p>"At the p-p-p-present time in Norfolk at the Navy Base," Luke
answered, "m-m-making the world safe for hypocrisy."</p>
<p>"Do you ever get out to sea, son?" said Coker.</p>
<p>"Sure!" said Luke. "A f-f-five cent ride on the street-car
brings me right out to the beach."</p>
<p>"That boy has had the makings of a sailor in him ever since he
wet the bed," said McGuire. "I predicted it long ago."</p>
<p>Horse Hines came in briskly, but checked himself when he saw
the two young men.</p>
<p>"Look out!" whispered the sailor to Eugene, with a crazy grin.
"You're next! He's got his fishy eye glued on you. He's already
getting you measured up for one."</p>
<p>Eugene looked angrily around at Horse Hines, muttering. The
sailor chortled madly.</p>
<p>"Good-morning, gentlemen," said Horse Hines, in an accent of
refined sadness. "Boys," he said, coming up to them sorrowfully,
"I was mighty sorry to hear of your trouble. I couldn't have
thought more of that boy if he'd been my own brother."</p>
<p>"Don't go on, Horse," said McGuire, holding up four fat
fingers of protest. "We can see you're heart-broken. If you go
on, you may get hysterical with your grief, and break right out
laughing. We couldn't bear that, Horse. We're big strong men, but
we've had hard lives. I beg of you to spare us, Horse."</p>
<p>Horse Hines did not notice him.</p>
<p>"I've got him over at the place now," he said softly. "I want
you boys to come in later in the day to see him. You won't know
he's the same person when I'm through."</p>
<p>"God! An improvement over nature," said Coker. "His mother
will appreciate it."</p>
<p>"Is this an undertaking shop you're running, Horse," said
McGuire, "or a beauty parlor?"</p>
<p>"We know you'll d-d-do your best, Mr. Hines," said the sailor
with ready earnest insincerity. "That's the reason the family got
you."</p>
<p>"Ain't you goin' to eat the rest of your steak?" said the
counter- man to Eugene.</p>
<p>"Steak! Steak! It's not steak!" muttered Eugene. "I know what
it is now." He got off the stool and walked over to Coker. "Can
you save me? Am I going to die? Do I look sick, Coker?" he said
in a hoarse mutter.</p>
<p>"No, son," said Coker. "Not sick&mdash;crazy."</p>
<p>Horse Hines took his seat at the other end of the counter.
Eugene, leaning upon the greasy marble counter, began to
sing:</p>
<blockquote>"Hey, ho, the carrion crow,<br>
Derry, derry, derry, derr&mdash;oh!"</blockquote>
<p>"Shut up, you damn fool!" said the sailor in a hoarse whisper,
grinning.</p>
<blockquote>"A carrion crow sat on a rock,<br>
Derry, derry, derry, derr&mdash;oh!"</blockquote>
<p>Outside, in the young gray light, there was a brisk wakening
of life. A street-car curved slowly into the avenue, the motorman
leaning from his window and shifting the switch carefully with a
long rod, blowing the warm fog of his breath into the chill air.
Patrolman Leslie Roberts, sallow and liverish, slouched by
an&aelig;mically, swinging his club. The negro man-of-all-work
for Wood's Pharmacy walked briskly into the post-office to
collect the morning mail. J. T. Stearns, the railway
passenger-agent, waited on the curb across the street for the
depot car. He had a red face, and he was reading the morning
paper.</p>
<p>"There they go!" Eugene cried suddenly. "As if they didn't
know about it!"</p>
<p>"Luke," said Harry Tugman, looking up from his paper, "I was
certainly sorry to hear about Ben. He was one fine boy." Then he
went back to his sheet.</p>
<p>"By God!" said Eugene. "This is news!"</p>
<p>He burst into a fit of laughter, gasping and uncontrollable,
which came from him with savage violence. Horse Hines glanced
craftily up at him. Then he went back to his paper.</p>
<p>The two young men left the lunch-room and walked homeward
through the brisk morning. Eugene's mind kept fumbling with
little things. There was a frosty snap and clatter of life upon
the streets, the lean rattle of wheels, the creak of blinds, a
cold rose-tint of pearled sky. In the Square, the motormen stood
about among their cars, in loud foggy gossip. At Dixieland, there
was an air of exhaustion, of nervous depletion. The house slept;
Eliza alone was stirring, but she had a smart fire crackling in
the range, and was full of business.</p>
<p>"You children go and sleep now. We've all got work to do later
in the day."</p>
<p>Luke and Eugene went into the big dining-room which Eliza had
converted into a bed-room.</p>
<p>"D-d-d-damn if I'm going to sleep upstairs," said the sailor
angrily. "Not after this!"</p>
<p>"Pshaw!" said Eliza. "That's only superstition. It wouldn't
bother me a bit."</p>
<p>The brothers slept heavily until past noon. Then they went out
again to see Horse Hines. They found him with his legs
comfortably disposed on the desk of his dark little office, with
its odor of weeping ferns, and incense, and old carnations.</p>
<p>He got up quickly as they entered, with a starchy crackle of
his hard boiled shirt, and a solemn rustle of his black garments.
Then he began to speak to them in a hushed voice, bending forward
slightly.</p>
<p>How like Death this man is (thought Eugene). He thought of the
awful mysteries of burial&mdash;the dark ghoul-ritual, the
obscene communion with the dead, touched with some black and foul
witch- magic. Where is the can in which they throw the parts?
There is a restaurant near here. Then he took the cold phthisic
hand, freckled on its back, that the man extended, with a sense
of having touched something embalmed. The undertaker's manner had
changed since the morning: it had become official, professional.
He was the alert marshal of their grief, the efficient master-of-
ceremonies. Subtly he made them feel there was an order and
decorum in death: a ritual of mourning that must be observed.
They were impressed.</p>
<p>"We thought we'd like to s-s-s-see you f-f-f-first, Mr. Hines,
about the c-c-c-c-casket," Luke whispered nervously. "We're going
to ask your advice. We want you to help us find something
appropriate."</p>
<p>Horse Hines nodded with grave approval. Then he led them
softly back, into a large dark room with polished waxen floors
where, amid a rich dead smell of wood and velvet, upon wheeled
trestles, the splendid coffins lay in their proud menace.</p>
<p>"Now," said Horse Hines quietly, "I know the family doesn't
want anything cheap."</p>
<p>"No, sir!" said the sailor positively. "We want the b-b-b-best
you have."</p>
<p>"I take a personal interest in this funeral," said Horse Hines
with gentle emotion. "I have known the Gant and Pentland families
for thirty years or more. I have had business dealings with your
father for nigh on to twenty years."</p>
<p>"And I w-w-want you to know, Mr. Hines, that the f-f-f-family
appreciates the interest you're taking in this," said the sailor
very earnestly.</p>
<p>He likes this, Eugene thought. The affection of the world. He
must have it.</p>
<p>"Your father," continued Horse Hines, "is one of the oldest
and most respected business men in the community. And the
Pentland family is one of the wealthiest and most prominent."</p>
<p>Eugene was touched with a moment's glow of pride.</p>
<p>"You don't want anything shoddy," said Horse Hines. "I know
that. What you get ought to be in good taste and have dignity. Am
I right?"</p>
<p>Luke nodded emphatically.</p>
<p>"That's the way we feel about it, Mr. Hines. We want the best
you have. We're not pinching p-p-p-pennies where Ben's
concerned," he said proudly.</p>
<p>"Well, then," said Horse Hines, "I'll give you my honest
opinion. I could give you this one cheap," he placed his hand
upon one of the caskets, "but I don't think it's what you want.
Of course," he said, "it's good at the price. It's worth the
money. It'll give you service, don't worry. You'll get value out
of it&mdash;"</p>
<p>Now there's an idea, thought Eugene.</p>
<p>"They're all good, Luke. I haven't got a bad piece of stock in
the place. But&mdash;"</p>
<p>"We want something b-b-b-better," said Luke earnestly. He
turned to Eugene. "Don't you think so, 'Gene?"</p>
<p>"Yes," said Eugene.</p>
<p>"Well," said Horse Hines, "I could sell you this one," he
indicated the most sumptuous casket in the room. "They don't come
better than that, Luke. That's the top. She's worth every dollar
I ask for her."</p>
<p>"All right," said Luke. "You're the judge. If that's the best
you've g-g-g-got, we'll take it."</p>
<p>No, no! thought Eugene. You mustn't interrupt. Let him go
on.</p>
<p>"But," said Horse Hines relentlessly, "there's no need for you
to take that one, either. What you're after, Luke, is dignity and
simplicity. Is that right?"</p>
<p>"Yes," said the sailor meekly, "I guess you're right at that,
Mr. Hines."</p>
<p>Now we'll have it, thought Eugene. This man takes joy in his
work.</p>
<p>"Well, then," said Horse Hines decisively, "I was going to
suggest to you boys that you take this one." He put his hand
affectionately upon a handsome casket at his side.</p>
<p>"This is neither too plain nor too fancy. It's simple and in
good taste. Silver handles, you see&mdash;silver plate here for
the name. You can't go wrong on this one. It's a good buy. She'll
give you value for every dollar you put into it."</p>
<p>They walked around the coffin, staring at it critically.</p>
<p>After a moment, Luke said nervously:</p>
<p>"How&mdash;wh&mdash;wh&mdash;wh-what's the price of this
one?"</p>
<p>"That sells for $450," said Horse Hines. "But," he added,
after a moment's dark reflection, "I'll tell you what I'll do.
Your father and I are old friends. Out of respect for the family,
I'll let you have it at cost&mdash;$375."</p>
<p>"What do you say, 'Gene?" the sailor asked. "Does it look all
right to you?"</p>
<p>Do your Christmas shopping early.</p>
<p>"Yes," said Eugene, "let's take it. I wish there were another
color. I don't like black," he added. "Haven't you got any other
color?"</p>
<p>Horse Hines stared at him a moment.</p>
<p>"Black IS the color," he said.</p>
<p>Then, after a moment's silence, he went on:</p>
<p>"Would you boys care to see the body?"</p>
<p>"Yes," they said.</p>
<p>He led them on tiptoe down the aisle of the coffins, and
opened a door to a room behind. It was dark. They entered and
stood with caught breath. Horse Hines switched on a light and
closed the door.</p>
<p>Ben, clad in his best suit of clothes, a neat one of dark
gray- black, lay in rigid tranquillity upon a table. His hands,
cold and white, with clean dry nails, withered a little like an
old apple, were crossed loosely on his stomach. He had been
closely shaved: he was immaculately groomed. The rigid head was
thrust sharply upward, with a ghastly counterfeit of a smile:
there was a little gum of wax at the nostrils, and a waxen lacing
between the cold firm lips. The mouth was tight, somewhat
bulging. It looked fuller than it ever had looked before.</p>
<p>There was a faint indefinably cloying odor.</p>
<p>The sailor looked with superstition, nervously, with puckered
forehead. Then he whispered to Eugene:</p>
<p>"I g-g-guess that's Ben, all right."</p>
<p>Because, Eugene thought, it is not Ben, and we are lost. He
looked at the cold bright carrion, that bungling semblance which
had not even the power of a good wax-work to suggest its image.
Nothing of Ben could be buried here. In this poor stuffed crow,
with its pathetic bartering, and its neat buttons, nothing of the
owner had been left. All that was there was the tailoring of
Horse Hines, who now stood by, watchfully, hungry for their
praise.</p>
<p>No, this is not Ben (Eugene thought). No trace of him is left
in this deserted shell. It bears no mark of him. Where has he
gone? Is this his bright particular flesh, made in his image,
given life by his unique gesture, by his one soul? No, he is gone
from that bright flesh. This thing is one with all carrion; it
will be mixed with the earth again. Ben? Where? O lost!</p>
<p>The sailor, looking, said:</p>
<p>"That b-b-b-boy sure suffered." Suddenly, turning his face
away into his hand, he sobbed briefly and painfully, his confused
stammering life drawn out of its sprawl into a moment of hard
grief.</p>
<p>Eugene wept, not because he saw Ben there, but because Ben had
gone, and because he remembered all the tumult and the pain.</p>
<p>"It is over now," said Horse Hines gently. "He is at
peace."</p>
<p>"By God, Mr. Hines," said the sailor earnestly, as he wiped
his eyes on his jacket, "that was one g-g-great boy."</p>
<p>Horse Hines looked raptly at the cold strange face.</p>
<p>"A fine boy," he murmured as his fish-eye fell tenderly on his
work. "And I have tried to do him justice."</p>
<p>They were silent for a moment, looking.</p>
<p>"You've d-d-done a fine job," said the sailor. "I've got to
hand it to you. What do you say, 'Gene?"</p>
<p>"Yes," said Eugene, in a small choking voice. "Yes."</p>
<p>"He's a b-b-b-bit p-p-p-pale, don't you think?" the sailor
stammered, barely conscious of what he was saying.</p>
<p>"Just a moment!" said Horse Hines quickly, lifting a finger.
Briskly he took a stick of rouge from his pocket, stepped
forward, and deftly, swiftly, sketched upon the dead gray cheeks
a ghastly rose-hued mockery of life and health.</p>
<p>"There!" he said, with deep satisfaction; and, rouge-stick in
hand, head critically cocked, like a painter before his canvas,
he stepped back into the terrible staring prison of their
horror.</p>
<p>"There are artists, boys, in every profession," Horse Hines
continued in a moment, with quiet pride, "and though I do say it
myself, Luke, I'm proud of my work on this job. Look at him!" he
exclaimed with sudden energy, and a bit of color in his gray
face. "Did you ever see anything more natural in your life?"</p>
<p>Eugene turned upon the man a grim and purple stare, noting
with pity, with a sort of tenderness, as the dogs of laughter
tugged at his straining throat the earnestness and pride in the
long horse- face.</p>
<p>"Look at it!" said Horse Hines again in slow wonder. "I'll
never beat that again! Not if I live to be a million! That's art,
boys!"</p>
<p>A slow strangling gurgle escaped from Eugene's screwed lips.
The sailor looked quickly at him, with a crazy suppressed
smile.</p>
<p>"What's the matter?" he said warningly. "Don't, fool!" His
grin broke loose.</p>
<p>Eugene staggered across the floor and collapsed upon a chair,
roaring with laughter while his long arms flapped helplessly at
his sides.</p>
<p>"Scuse!" he gasped. "Don't mean to&mdash;A-r-rt! Yes! Yes!
That's it!" he screamed, and he beat his knuckles in a crazy
tattoo upon the polished floor. He slid gently off the chair,
slowly unbuttoning his vest, and with a languid hand loosening
his necktie. A faint gurgle came from his weary throat, his head
lolled around on the floor languidly, tears coursed down his
swollen features.</p>
<p>"What's wrong with you? Are you c-c-c-crazy?" said the sailor,
all a-grin.</p>
<p>Horse Hines bent sympathetically and assisted the boy to his
feet.</p>
<p>"It's the strain," he said knowingly to the sailor. "The pore
fellow has become hysterical."</p>
<h3>37</h3>
<p>So, to Ben dead was given more care, more time, more money
than had ever been given to Ben living. His burial was a final
gesture of irony and futility: an effort to compensate carrion
death for the unpaid wage of life&mdash;love and mercy. He had a
grand funeral. All the Pentlands sent wreaths, and came with
their separate clans, bringing along with their hastily assumed
funeral manners a smell of recent business. Will Pentland talked
with the men about politics, the war, and trade conditions,
paring his nails thoughtfully, pursing his lips and nodding in
his curiously reflective way, and occasionally punning with a
birdy wink. His pleased self-laughter was mixed with Henry's loud
guffaw. Pett, older, kinder, gentler than Eugene had ever seen
her, moved about with a rustling of gray silk, and a relaxed
bitterness. And Jim was there, with his wife, whose name Eugene
forgot, and his four bright hefty daughters, whose names he
confused, but who had all been to college and done well, and his
son, who had been to a Presbyterian college, and had been
expelled for advocating free love and socialism while editor of
the college paper. Now he played the violin, and loved music, and
helped his father with the business: he was an effeminate and
mincing young man, but of the breed. And there was Thaddeus
Pentland, Will's bookkeeper, the youngest and poorest of the
three. He was a man past fifty, with a pleasant red face, brown
mustaches, and a gentle placid manner. He was full of puns and
pleased good-nature, save when he quoted from Karl Marx and
Eugene Debs. He was a Socialist, and had once received eight
votes for Congress. He was there with his garrulous wife (whom
Helen called Jibber-Jibber) and his two daughters, languid
good-looking blondes of twenty and twenty-four.</p>
<p>There they were, in all their glory&mdash;that strange rich
clan, with its fantastic mixture of success and impracticality,
its hard monied sense, its visionary fanaticism. There they were,
in their astonishing contradictions: the business man who had no
business method, and yet had made his million dollars; the
frantic antagonist of Capital who had given the loyal service of
a lifetime to the thing he denounced; the wastrel son, with the
bull vitality of the athlete, a great laugh, animal
charm&mdash;no more; the musician son, a college rebel,
intelligent, fanatic, with a good head for figures; insane
miserliness for oneself, lavish expenditure for one's
children.</p>
<p>There they were, each with the familiar marking of the
clan&mdash;broad nose, full lips, deep flat cheeks, deliberate
pursed mouths, flat drawling voices, flat complacent laughter.
There they were, with their enormous vitality, their tainted
blood, their meaty health, their sanity, their insanity, their
humor, their superstition, their meanness, their generosity,
their fanatic idealism, their unyielding materialism. There they
were, smelling of the earth and Parnassus&mdash;that strange clan
which met only at weddings or funerals, but which was forever
true to itself, indissoluble and forever apart, with its
melancholia, its madness, its mirth: more enduring than life,
more strong than death.</p>
<p>And as Eugene looked, he felt again the nightmare horror of
destiny: he was of them&mdash;there was no escape. Their lust,
their weakness, their sensuality, their fanaticism, their
strength, their rich taint, were rooted in the marrow of his
bones.</p>
<p>But Ben, with the thin gray face (he thought) was not a part
of them. Their mark was nowhere on him.</p>
<p>And among them, sick and old, leaning upon his cane, moved
Gant, the alien, the stranger. He was lost and sorrowful, but
sometimes, with a flash of his old rhetoric, he spoke of his
grief and the death of his son.</p>
<p>The women filled the house with their moaning. Eliza wept
almost constantly; Helen by fits, in loose hysterical collapse.
And all the other women wept with gusto, comforting Eliza and her
daughter, falling into one another's arms, wailing with keen
hunger. And the men stood sadly about, dressed in their good
clothes, wondering when it would be over. Ben lay in the parlor,
bedded in his expensive coffin. The room was heavy with the
incense of the funeral bowers.</p>
<p>Presently the Scotch minister arrived: his decent soul lay
above all the loud posturings of grief like a bolt of hard clean
wool. He began the service for the dead in a dry nasal voice,
remote, monotonous, cold, and passionate.</p>
<p>Then, marshalled by Horse Hines, the pallbearers, young men
from the paper and the town, who had known the dead man best,
moved slowly out, gripping the coffin-handles with their
nicotined fingers. In proper sequence, the mourners followed,
lengthening out in closed victorias that exhaled their funeral
scent of stale air and old leather.</p>
<p>To Eugene came again the old ghoul fantasy of a corpse and
cold pork, the smell of the dead and hamburger steak&mdash;the
glozed corruption of Christian burial, the obscene pomps, the
perfumed carrion. Slightly nauseated, he took his seat with Eliza
in the carriage, and tried to think of supper.</p>
<p>The procession moved off briskly to the smooth trotting pull
of the velvet rumps. The mourning women peered out of the closed
carriages at the gaping town. They wept behind their heavy veils,
and looked to see if the town was watching. Behind the world's
great mask of grief, the eyes of the mourners shone through with
a terrible and indecent hunger, an unnameable lust.</p>
<p>It was raw October weather&mdash;gray and wet. The service had
been short, as a precaution against the pestilence which was
everywhere. The funeral entered the cemetery. It was a pleasant
place, on a hill. There was a good view of the town. As the
hearse drove up, two men who had been digging the grave, moved
off. The women moaned loudly when they saw the raw open
ditch.</p>
<p>Slowly the coffin was lowered onto the bands that crossed the
grave.</p>
<p>Again Eugene heard the nasal drone of the Presbyterian
minister. The boy's mind fumbled at little things. Horse Hines
bent ceremoniously, with a starched crackle of shirt, to throw
his handful of dirt into the grave. "Ashes to ashes&mdash;" He
reeled and would have fallen in if Gilbert Gant had not held him.
He had been drinking. "I am the resurrection and the life&mdash;"
Helen wept constantly, harshly and bitterly. "He that believeth
in me&mdash;" The sobs of the women rose to sharp screams as the
coffin slid down upon the bands into the earth.</p>
<p>Then the mourners got back into their carriages and were
driven briskly away. There was a fast indecent hurry about their
escape. The long barbarism of burial was at an end. As they drove
away, Eugene peered back through the little glass in the
carriage. The two grave-diggers were already returning to their
work. He watched until the first shovel of dirt had been thrown
into the grave. He saw the raw new graves, the sere long grasses,
noted how quickly the mourning wreaths had wilted. Then he looked
at the wet gray sky. He hoped it would not rain that night.</p>
<p>It was over. The carriages split away from the procession. The
men dropped off in the town at the newspaper office, the
pharmacy, the cigar-store. The women went home. No more. No
more.</p>
<p>Night came, the bare swept streets, the gaunt winds. Helen lay
before a fire in Hugh Barton's home. She had a bottle of
chloroform liniment in her hand. She brooded morbidly into the
fire, reliving the death a hundred times, weeping bitterly and
becoming calm again.</p>
<p>"When I think of it, I hate her. I shall never forget. And did
you hear her? Did you? Already she's begun to pretend how much he
loved her. But you can't fool me! I know! He wouldn't have her
around. You saw that, didn't you? He kept calling for me. I was
the only one he'd let come near him. You know that, don't
you?"</p>
<p>"You're the one who always has to be the goat," said Hugh
Barton sourly. "I'm getting tired of it. That's what has worn you
out. If they don't leave you alone, I'm going to take you away
from here."</p>
<p>Then he went back to his charts and pamphlets, frowning
importantly over a cigar, and scrawling figures on an old
envelope with a stub of pencil gripped between his fingers.</p>
<p>She has him trained, too, Eugene thought.</p>
<p>Then, hearing the sharp whine of the wind, she wept again.</p>
<p>"Poor old Ben," she said. "I can't bear to think of him out
there to-night."</p>
<p>She was silent for a moment, staring at the fire.</p>
<p>"After this, I'm through," she said. "They can get along for
themselves. Hugh and I have a right to our own lives. Don't you
think so?"</p>
<p>"Yes," said Eugene. I'm merely the chorus, he thought.</p>
<p>"Papa's not going to die," she went on. "I've nursed him like
a slave for six years, and he'll be here when I'm gone. Every one
was expecting papa to die, but it was Ben who went. You never can
tell. After this, I'm through."</p>
<p>Her voice had a note of exasperation in it. They all felt the
grim trickery of Death, which had come in by the cellar while
they waited at the window.</p>
<p>"Papa has no right to expect it of me!" she burst out
resentfully. "He's had his life. He's an old man. We have a right
to ours as well as any one. Good heavens! Can't they realize
that! I'm married to Hugh Barton! I'm HIS wife!"</p>
<p>Are you? thought Eugene. Are you?</p>
<p>But Eliza sat before the fire at Dixieland with hands folded,
reliving a past of tenderness and love that never had been. And
as the wind howled in the bleak street, and Eliza wove a thousand
fables of that lost and bitter spirit, the bright and stricken
thing in the boy twisted about in horror, looking for escape from
the house of death. No more! No more! (it said). You are alone
now. You are lost. Go find yourself, lost boy, beyond the
hills.</p>
<p>This little bright and stricken thing stood up on Eugene's
heart and talked into his mouth.</p>
<p>O but I can't go now, said Eugene to it. (Why not? it
whispered.) Because her face is so white, and her forehead is so
broad and high, with the black hair drawn back from it, and when
she sat there at the bed she looked like a little child. I can't
go now and leave her here alone. (She is alone, it said, and so
are you.) And when she purses up her mouth and stares, so grave
and thoughtful, she is like a little child. (You are alone now,
it said. You must escape, or you will die.) It is all like death:
she fed me at her breast, I slept in the same bed with her, she
took me on her trips. All of that is over now, and each time it
was like a death. (And like a life, it said to him. Each time
that you die, you will be born again. And you will die a hundred
times before you become a man.) I can't! I can't! Not
now&mdash;later, more slowly. (No. Now, it said.) I am afraid. I
have nowhere to go. (You must find the place, it said.) I am
lost. (You must hunt for yourself, it said.) I am alone. Where
are you? (You must find me, it said.)</p>
<p>Then, as the bright thing twisted about in him, Eugene heard
the whine of the bleak wind about the house that he must leave,
and the voice of Eliza calling up from the past the beautiful
lost things that never happened.</p>
<p>"&mdash;and I said, 'Why, what on earth, boy, you want to
dress up warm around your neck or you'll catch your death of
cold.'"</p>
<p>Eugene caught at his throat and plunged for the door.</p>
<p>"Here, boy! Where are you going?" said Eliza, looking up
quickly.</p>
<p>"I've got to go," he said in a choking voice. "I've got to get
away from here."</p>
<p>Then he saw the fear in her eyes, and the grave troubled
child's stare. He rushed to where she sat and grasped her hand.
She held him tightly and laid her face against his arm.</p>
<p>"Don't go yet," she said. "You've all your life ahead of you.
Stay with me just a day or two."</p>
<p>"Yes, mama," he said, falling to his knees. "Yes, mama." He
hugged her to him frantically. "Yes, mama. God bless you, mama.
It's all right, mama. It's all right."</p>
<p>Eliza wept bitterly.</p>
<p>"I'm an old woman," she said, "and one by one I've lost you
all. He's dead now, and I never got to know him. O son, don't
leave me yet. You're the only one that's left: you were my baby.
Don't go! Don't go." She laid her white face against his
sleeve.</p>
<p>It is not hard to go (he thought). But when can we forget?</p>
<p>It was October and the leaves were quaking. Dusk was
beginning. The sun had gone, the western ranges faded in chill
purple mist, but the western sky still burned with ragged bands
of orange. It was October.</p>
<p>Eugene walked swiftly along the sinuous paved curves of
Rutledge Road. There was a smell of fog and supper in the air: a
warm moist blur at window-panes, and the pungent sizzle of
cookery. There were mist-far voices, and a smell of burning
leaves, and a warm yellow blur of lights.</p>
<p>He turned into an unpaved road by the big wooden sanitarium.
He heard the rich kitchen laughter of the negroes, the larded
sizzle of food, the dry veranda coughing of the lungers.</p>
<p>He walked briskly along the lumpy road, with a dry scuffling
of leaves. The air was a chill dusky pearl: above him a few pale
stars were out. The town and the house were behind him. There was
a singing in the great hill-pines.</p>
<p>Two women came down the road and passed him. He saw that they
were country women. They were dressed rustily in black, and one
of them was weeping. He thought of the men who had been laid in
the earth that day, and of all the women who wept. Will they come
again? he wondered.</p>
<p>When he came to the gate of the cemetery he found it open. He
went in quickly and walked swiftly up the winding road that
curved around the crest of the hill. The grasses were dry and
sere; a wilted wreath of laurel lay upon a grave. As he
approached the family plot, his pulse quickened a little. Some
one was moving slowly, deliberately, in among the grave-stones.
But as he came up he saw that it was Mrs. Pert.</p>
<p>"Good-evening, Mrs. Pert," said Eugene.</p>
<p>"Who is it?" she asked, peering murkily. She came to him with
her grave unsteady step.</p>
<p>"It's 'Gene," he said.</p>
<p>"Oh, is it Old 'Gene?" she said. "How are you, 'Gene?"</p>
<p>"Pretty well," he said. He stood awkwardly, chilled, not
knowing how to continue. It was getting dark. There were long
lonely preludes to winter in the splendid pines, and a whistling
of wind in the long grasses. Below them, in the gulch, night had
come. There was a negro settlement there&mdash;Stumptown, it was
called. The rich voices of Africa wailed up to them their jungle
dirge.</p>
<p>But in the distance, away on their level and above, on other
hills, they saw the town. Slowly, in twinkling nests, the lights
of the town went up, and there were frost-far voices, and music,
and the laughter of a girl.</p>
<p>"This is a nice place," said Eugene. "You get a nice view of
the town from here."</p>
<p>"Yes," said Mrs. Pert. "And Old Ben's got the nicest place of
all. You get a better view right here than anywhere else. I've
been here before in the daytime." In a moment she went on. "Old
Ben will turn into lovely flowers. Roses, I think."</p>
<p>"No," said Eugene, "dandelions&mdash;and big flowers with a
lot of thorns on them."</p>
<p>She stood looking about fuzzily for a moment, with the blurred
gentle smile on her lips.</p>
<p>"It is getting dark, Mrs. Pert," said Eugene hesitantly. "Are
you out here alone?"</p>
<p>"Alone? I've got Old 'Gene and Old Ben here, haven't I?" she
said.</p>
<p>"Maybe we'd better go back, Mrs. Pert?" he said. "It's going
to turn cold to-night. I'll go with you."</p>
<p>"Fatty can go by herself," she said with dignity. "Don't
worry, 'Gene. I'll leave you alone."</p>
<p>"That's all right," said Eugene, confused. "We both came for
the same reason, I suppose."</p>
<p>"Yes," said Mrs. Pert. "Who'll be coming here this time next
year, I wonder? Will Old 'Gene come back then?"</p>
<p>"No," said Eugene. "No, Mrs. Pert. I shall never come here
again."</p>
<p>"Nor I, 'Gene," she said. "When do you go back to school?"</p>
<p>"To-morrow," he said.</p>
<p>"Then Fatty will have to say good-bye," she said
reproachfully. "I'm going away too."</p>
<p>"Where are you going?" he asked, surprised.</p>
<p>"I'm going to live with my daughter in Tennessee. You didn't
know Fatty was a grandmother, did you?" she said, with her soft
blurred smile. "I've a little grandson two years old."</p>
<p>"I'm sorry to see you go," Eugene said.</p>
<p>Mrs. Pert was silent a moment, rocking vaguely upon her
feet.</p>
<p>"What did they say was wrong with Ben?" she asked.</p>
<p>"He had pneumonia, Mrs. Pert," said Eugene.</p>
<p>"Oh, pneumonia! That's it!" She nodded her head wisely as if
satisfied. "My husband's a drug salesman, you know, but I never
can remember all the things that people have. Pneumonia."</p>
<p>She was silent again, reflecting.</p>
<p>"And when they shut you up in a box and put you in the ground,
the way they did Old Ben, what do they call that?" she asked with
a soft inquiring smile.</p>
<p>He did not laugh.</p>
<p>"They call that death, Mrs. Pert."</p>
<p>"Death! Yes, that's it," said Mrs. Pert brightly, nodding her
head in agreement. "That's one kind, 'Gene. There are some other
lands, too. Did you know that?" She smiled at him.</p>
<p>"Yes," said Eugene. "I know that, Mrs. Pert."</p>
<p>She stretched out her hands suddenly to him, and clasped his
cold fingers. She did not smile any more.</p>
<p>"Good-bye, my dear," she said. "We both knew Ben, didn't we?
God bless you."</p>
<p>Then she turned and walked away down the road, at her portly
uncertain gait, and was lost in the gathering dark.</p>
<p>The great stars rode proudly up into heaven. And just over
him, just over the town, it seemed, there was one so rich and low
he could have touched it. Ben's grave had been that day freshly
sodded: there was a sharp cold smell of earth there. Eugene
thought of Spring, and the poignant and wordless odor of the
elvish dandelions that would be there. In the frosty dark,
far-faint, there was the departing wail of a whistle.</p>
<p>And suddenly, as he watched the lights wink cheerfully up in
the town, their warm message of the hived life of men brought to
him a numb hunger for all the words and the faces. He heard the
far voices and laughter. And on the distant road a powerful car,
bending around the curve, cast over him for a second, over that
lonely hill of the dead, its great shaft of light and life. In
his numbed mind, which for days now had fumbled curiously with
little things, with little things alone, as a child fumbles with
blocks or with little things, a light was growing.</p>
<p>His mind gathered itself out of the wreckage of little things:
out of all that the world had shown or taught him he could
remember now only the great star above the town, and the light
that had swung over the hill, and the fresh sod upon Ben's grave,
and the wind, and far sounds and music, and Mrs. Pert.</p>
<p>Wind pressed the boughs, the withered leaves were shaking. It
was October, but the leaves were shaking. A star was shaking. A
light was waking. Wind was quaking. The star was far. The night,
the light. The light was bright. A chant, a song, the slow dance
of the little things within him. The star over the town, the
light over the hill, the sod over Ben, night over all. His mind
fumbled with little things. Over us all is something. Star,
night, earth, light...light...O lost!...a stone...a leaf...a
door...O ghost!...a light...a song...a light...a light swings
over the hill...over us all...a star shines over the town...over
us all...a light.</p>
<p>We shall not come again. We never shall come back again. But
over us all, over us all, over us all is&mdash;something.</p>
<p>Wind pressed the boughs; the withered leaves were shaking. It
was October, but some leaves were shaking.</p>
<p>A light swings over the hill. (We shall not come again.) And
over the town a star. (Over us all, over us all that shall not
come again.) And over the day the dark. But over the
darkness&mdash;what?</p>
<p>We shall not come again. We never shall come back again.</p>
<p>Over the dawn a lark. (That shall not come again.) And wind
and music far. O lost! (It shall not come again.) And over your
mouth the earth. O ghost! But, over the darkness&mdash;what?</p>
<p>Wind pressed the boughs; the withered leaves were quaking.</p>
<p>We shall not come again. We never shall come back again. It
was October, but we never shall come back again.</p>
<p>When will they come again? When will they come again?</p>
<p>The laurel, the lizard, and the stone will come no more. The
women weeping at the gate have gone and will not come again. And
pain and pride and death will pass, and will not come again. And
light and dawn will pass, and the star and the cry of a lark will
pass, and will not come again. And we shall pass, and shall not
come again.</p>
<p>What things will come again? O Spring, the cruellest and
fairest of the seasons, will come again. And the strange and
buried men will come again, in flower and leaf the strange and
buried men will come again, and death and the dust will never
come again, for death and the dust will die. And Ben will come
again, he will not die again, in flower and leaf, in wind and
music far, he will come back again.</p>
<p>O lost, and by the wind grieved, ghost, come back again!</p>
<p>It had grown dark. The frosty night blazed with great
brilliant stars. The lights in the town shone with sharp
radiance. Presently, when he had lain upon the cold earth for
some time, Eugene got up and went away toward the town.</p>
<p>Wind pressed the boughs; the withered leaves were shaking.</p>
<h3>38</h3>
<p>Three weeks after Eugene's return to the university the war
ended. The students cursed and took off their uniforms. But they
rang the great bronze bell, and built a bonfire on the campus,
leaping around it like dervishes.</p>
<p>Life fell back into civilian patterns. The gray back of winter
was broken: the Spring came through.</p>
<p>Eugene was a great man on the campus of the little university.
He plunged exultantly into the life of the place. He cried out in
his throat with his joy: all over the country, life was
returning, reviving, awaking. The young men were coming back to
the campus. The leaves were out in a tender green blur: the
quilled jonquil spouted from the rich black earth, and
peach-bloom fell upon the shrill young isles of grass. Everywhere
life was returning, awaking, reviving. With victorious joy,
Eugene thought of the flowers above Ben's grave.</p>
<p>He was wild with ecstasy because the Spring had beaten death.
The grief of Ben sank to a forgotten depth in him. He was charged
with the juice of life and motion. He did not walk: he bounded
along. He joined everything he had not joined. He made funny
speeches in chapel, at smokers, at meetings of all sorts. He
edited the paper, he wrote poems and stories&mdash;he flung
outward without pause or thought.</p>
<p>Sometimes at night he would rush across the country, beside a
drunken driver, to Exeter and Sydney, and there seek out the
women behind the chained lattices, calling to them in the fresh
dawn-dusk of Spring his young goat-cry of desire and hunger.</p>
<p>Lily! Louise! Ruth! Ellen! O mother of love, you cradle of
birth and living, whatever your billion names may be, I come,
your son, your lover. Stand, Maya, by your opened door, denned in
the jungle web of Niggertown.</p>
<p>Sometimes, when he walked softly by, he heard the young men
talking in their rooms of Eugene Gant. Eugene Gant was crazy.
Eugene Gant was mad. Oh, I (he thought) am Eugene Gant!</p>
<p>Then a voice said: "He didn't change his underwear for six
weeks. One of his fraternity brothers told me so." And another:
"He takes a bath once a month, whether he needs it or not." They
laughed; one said then that he was "brilliant"; they all
agreed.</p>
<p>He caught the claw of his hand into his lean throat. They are
talking of me, of me! I am Eugene Gant&mdash;the conqueror of
nations, lord of the earth, the Siva of a thousand beautiful
forms.</p>
<p>In nakedness and loneliness of soul he paced along the
streets. Nobody said, I know you. Nobody said, I am here.</p>
<p>The vast wheel of life, of which he was the hub, spun
round.</p>
<p>Most of us think we're hell, thought Eugene. I do. I think I'm
hell. Then, in the dark campus path, he heard the young men
talking in their rooms, and he gouged at his face bloodily, with
a snarl of hate against himself.</p>
<p>I think I am hell, and they say I stink because I have not had
a bath. But I could not stink, even if I never had a bath. Only
the others stink. My dirtiness is better than their cleanliness.
The web of my flesh is finer; my blood is a subtle elixir; the
hair of my head, the marrow of my spine, the cunning jointure of
my bones, and all the combining jellies, fats, meats, oils, and
sinews of my flesh, the spittle of my mouth, the sweat of my
skin, is mixed with rarer elements, and is fairer and finer than
their gross peasant beef.</p>
<p>There had appeared that year upon the nape of his neck a small
tetter of itch, a sign of his kinship with the Pentlands&mdash;a
token of his kinship with the great malady of life. He tore at
the spot with frantic nails; he burned his neck to a peeled
blister with carbolic acid&mdash;but the spot, as if fed by some
ineradicable leprosy in his blood, remained. Sometimes, during
cool weather, it almost disappeared; but in warm weather it
returned angrily, and he scraped his neck red in an itching
torture.</p>
<p>He was afraid to let people walk behind him. He sat, whenever
possible, with his back to the wall; he was in agony when he
descended a crowded stair, holding his shoulders high so that the
collar of his coat might hide the terrible patch. He let his hair
grow in a great thick mat, partly to hide his sore, and partly
because exposing it to the view of the barber touched him with
shame and horror.</p>
<p>He would become at times insanely conscious of spotless youth:
he was terrified before the loud good health of America, which is
really a sickness, because no man will admit his sores. He shrank
back at the memory of his lost heroic fantasies: he thought of
Bruce-Eugene, of all his thousand romantic impersonations, and
never could he endure himself with an itching tetter upon his
flesh. He became morbidly conscious of all his blemishes, real
and fancied: for days he would see nothing but people's
teeth&mdash;he would stare into their mouths when he talked to
them, noting the fillings, the extractions, the plates and
bridges. He would gaze with envy and fear at the sound ivory
grinders of the young men, baring his own, which were regular but
somewhat yellowed with smoking, a hundred times a day. He
scrubbed at them savagely with a stiff brush until the gums bled;
he brooded for hours upon a decaying molar which must one day be
extracted, and, wild with despair, he would figure out on paper
the age at which he might become toothless.</p>
<p>But if, he thought, I lose only one every two years after I am
twenty, I shall still have over fifteen left when I am fifty,
since we have thirty-two, including wisdom-teeth. And it will not
look so bad, if only I can save the front ones. Then, with his
hope in futures, he thought: But by that time perhaps the
dentists can give me real ones. He read several dental magazines
to see if there was any hope for the transplanting of sound teeth
for old ones. Then, with brooding satisfaction, he studied his
sensual deeply scalloped mouth with the pouting underlip, noting
that even when he smiled he barely revealed his teeth.</p>
<p>He asked the medical students innumerable questions about the
treatment or cure of inherited blood maladies, venereal diseases,
intestinal and inguinal cancers, and the transference of animal
glands to men. He went to the movies only to examine the teeth
and muscles of the hero; he pored over the toothpaste and collar
advertisements in the magazines; he went to the shower-rooms at
the gymnasium and stared at the straight toes of the young men,
thinking with desperate sick pain of his own bunched and crooked
ones. He stood naked before a mirror, looking at his long gaunt
body, smooth and white save for the crooked toes and the terrible
spot on his neck&mdash;lean, but moulded with delicate and
powerful symmetry.</p>
<p>Then, slowly, he began to take a terrible joy in his taint.
The thing on his neck that could not be gouged or burnt away he
identified with a tragic humor of his blood that plunged him
downward at times into melancholia and madness. But there was, he
saw, a great health in him as well, that could bring him back
victoriously from desolation. In his reading of fiction, in the
movies, in the collar advertisements, in all his thousand
fantasies of Bruce-Eugene, he had never known a hero with crooked
toes, a decaying tooth, and a patch of tetter on his neck. Nor
had he ever known a heroine, whether among the society women of
Chambers and Phillips, or among the great elegants of Meredith
and Ouida, who had borne such a blemish. But, in all his
fantasies now, he loved a woman with hair of carrot silk and eyes
of a faintly weary violet, webbed delicately at the corners. Her
teeth were small, white and irregular, and she had one molar
edged with gold which was visible when she smiled. She was
subtle, and a little weary: a child and a mother, as old and as
deep as Asia, and as young as germinal April who returns forever
like a girl, a mistress, a parent, and a nurse.</p>
<p>Thus, through the death of his brother, and the sickness that
was rooted in his own flesh, Eugene came to know a deeper and
darker wisdom than he had ever known before. He began to see that
what was subtle and beautiful in human life was touched with a
divine pearl-sickness. Health was to be found in the steady stare
of the cats and dogs, or in the smooth vacant chops of the
peasant. But he looked on the faces of the lords of the
earth&mdash;and he saw them wasted and devoured by the beautiful
disease of thought and passion. In the pages of a thousand books
he saw their portraits: Coleridge at twenty-five, with the loose
sensual mouth, gaping idiotically, the vast staring eyes, holding
in their opium depths the vision of seas haunted by the
albatross, the great white forehead&mdash;head mixed of Zeus and
the village degenerate; the lean worn head of Caesar, a little
thirsty in the flanks; and the dreaming mummy face of Kublai
Khan, lit with eyes that flickered with green fires. And he saw
the faces of the great Thothmes, and Aspalta and Mycerinus, and
all the heads of subtle Egypt&mdash;those smooth unwrinkled faces
that held the wisdom of 1,200 gods. And the strange wild faces of
the Goth, the Frank, the Vandal, that came storming up below the
old tired eyes of Rome. And the weary craftiness on the face of
the great Jew, Disraeli; the terrible skull-grin of Voltaire; the
mad ranting savagery of Ben Jonson's; the dour wild agony of
Carlyle's; and the faces of Heine, and Rousseau, and Dante, and
Tiglath-Pileser, and Cervantes&mdash;these were all faces on
which life had fed. They were faces wasted by the vulture,
Thought; they were faces seared and hollowed by the flame of
Beauty.</p>
<p>And thus, touched with the terrible destiny of his blood,
caught in the trap of himself and the Pentlands, with the little
flower of sin and darkness on his neck, Eugene escaped forever
from the good and the pretty, into a dark land that is forbidden
to the sterilized. The creatures of romantic fiction, the vicious
doll- faces of the movie women, the brutal idiot regularity of
the faces in the advertisements, and the faces of most of the
young college- men and women, were stamped in a mould of
enamelled vacancy, and became unclean to him.</p>
<p>The national demand for white shiny plumbing, toothpaste,
tiled lunch-rooms, hair-cuts, manicured dentistry, horn
spectacles, baths, and the insane fear of disease that sent the
voters whispering to the druggist after their brutal fumbling
lecheries&mdash;all of this seemed nasty. Their outer cleanliness
became the token of an inner corruption: it was something that
glittered and was dry, foul, and rotten at the core. He felt
that, no matter what leper's taint he might carry upon his flesh,
there was in him a health that was greater than they could ever
know&mdash;something fierce and cruelly wounded, but alive, that
did not shrink away from the terrible sunken river of life;
something desperate and merciless that looked steadily on the
hidden and unspeakable passions that unify the tragic family of
this earth.</p>
<p>Yet, Eugene was no rebel. He had no greater need for rebellion
than have most Americans, which is none at all. He was quite
content with any system which might give him comfort, security,
enough money to do as he liked, and freedom to think, eat, drink,
love, read, and write what he chose. And he did not care under
what form of government he lived&mdash;Republican, Democrat,
Tory, Socialist, or Bolshevist&mdash;if it could assure him these
things. He did not want to reform the world, or to make it a
better place to live in: his whole conviction was that the world
was full of pleasant places, enchanted places, if he could only
go and find them. The life around him was beginning to fetter and
annoy him: he wanted to escape from it. He felt sure things would
be better elsewhere. He always felt sure things would be better
elsewhere.</p>
<p>It was not his quality as a romantic to escape out of life,
but into it. He wanted no land of Make-believe: his fantasies
found extension in reality, and he saw no reason to doubt that
there really were 1,200 gods in Egypt, and that the centaur, the
hippogriff, and the winged bull might all be found in their
proper places. He believed that there was magic in Byzantium, and
genii stoppered up in wizards' bottles. Moreover, since Ben's
death, the conviction had grown on him that men do not escape
from life because life is dull, but that life escapes from men
because men are little. He felt that the passions of the play
were greater than the actors. It seemed to him that he had never
had a great moment of living in which he had measured up to its
fulness. His pain at Ben's death had been greater than he, the
love and loss of Laura had left him stricken and bewildered, and
when he embraced young girls and women he felt a desperate
frustration: he wanted to eat them like cake and to have them,
too; to roll them up into a ball; to entomb them in his flesh; to
possess them more fully than they may ever be possessed.</p>
<p>Further, it annoyed and wounded him to be considered "queer."
He exulted in his popularity among the students, his heart
pounded with pride under all the pins and emblems, but he
resented being considered an eccentric, and he envied those of
his fellows who were elected to office for their solid golden
mediocrity. He wanted to obey the laws and to be respected: he
believed himself to be a sincerely conventional person&mdash;but,
some one would see him after midnight, bounding along a campus
path, with goat-cries beneath the moon. His suits went baggy, his
shirts and drawers got dirty, his shoes wore through&mdash;he
stuffed them with cardboard strips&mdash;his hats grew shapeless
and wore through at the creases. But he did not mean to go
unkempt&mdash;the thought of going for repairs filled him with
weary horror. He hated to act&mdash;he wanted to brood upon his
entrails for fourteen hours a day. At length, goaded, he would
lash his great bulk, lulled in the powerful inertia of its
visions, into a cursing and violent movement.</p>
<p>He was desperately afraid of people in crowds: at class
meetings, or smokers, or at any public gathering, he was nervous
and constrained until he began to talk to them, and got them
under him. He was always afraid that some one would make a joke
about him, and that he would be laughed at. But he was not afraid
of any man alone: he felt that he could handle any one if he got
him away from his crowd. Remembering his savage fear and hatred
of the crowd, with a man alone he could play cruelly, like a cat,
snarling gently at him, prowling in on him softly, keeping cocked
and silent the terrible tiger's paw of his spirit. All of their
starch oozed out of them; they seemed to squeak and twitter, and
look round for the door. He would get some loud pompous
yokel&mdash;the student president of the Y. M. C. A., or the
class president&mdash;and bear down on him with evil gentle
matter-of-factness.</p>
<p>"Don't you think," he would begin with earnest piety, "don't
you think that a man should kiss his wife on her belly?"</p>
<p>And he would fasten all the eager innocence of his face into a
stare.</p>
<p>"For, after all, the belly is sometimes more beautiful than
the mouth, and far cleaner. Or do you believe in the belly-less
marriage? I, for one," he went on with proud passion, "do not! I
stand for more and better Belly-Kissing. Our wives, our mothers,
and our sisters expect it of us. It is an act of reverence to the
seat of life. Nay! it is even an act of religious worship. If we
could get our prominent business men and all the other right-
thinking people interested in it, it would bring about the
mightiest revolution ever known in a nation's life. In five years
it would do away with divorce and re-establish the prestige of
the home. In twenty years it would make our nation the proud
centre of civilization and the arts. Don't you think so? Or do
you?"</p>
<p>Eugene thought so. It was one of his few Utopias.</p>
<p>Sometimes, when he was in a chafed and bitter temper, he would
hear a burst of laughter from a student's room, and he would turn
snarling, and curse them, believing they laughed at him. He
inherited his father's conviction at times that the world was
gathered in an immense conspiracy against him: the air about him
was full of mockery and menace, the leaves whispered with
treason, in a thousand secret places people were assembled to
humiliate, degrade, and betray him. He would spend hours under
the terrible imminence of some unknown danger: although he was
guilty of nothing but his own nightmare fantasies, he would enter
a class, a meeting, a gathering of students, with cold
constricted heart, awaiting exposure, sentence, and ruin, for he
knew not what crime. Again, he would be wild, extravagant, and
careless, squealing triumphantly in their faces and bounding
along possessed with goaty joy, as he saw life dangling like a
plum for his taking.</p>
<p>And thus, going along a campus path at night, fulfilled with
his dreams of glory, he heard young men talking of him kindly and
coarsely, laughing at his antics, and saying he needed a bath and
clean underwear. He clawed at his throat as he listened.</p>
<p>I think I'm hell, thought Eugene, and they say I stink because
I have not had a bath. Me! Me! Bruce-Eugene, the Scourge of the
Greasers, and the greatest fullback Yale ever had! Marshal Gant,
the saviour of his country! Ace Gant, the hawk of the sky, the
man who brought Richthofen down! Senator Gant, Governor Gant,
President Gant, the restorer and uniter of a broken nation,
retiring quietly to private life in spite of the weeping protest
of one hundred million people, until, like Arthur or Barbarossa,
he shall hear again the drums of need and peril.</p>
<p>Jesus-of-Nazareth Gant, mocked, reviled, spat upon, and
imprisoned for the sins of others, but nobly silent, preferring
death rather than cause pain to the woman he loves. Gant, the
Unknown Soldier, the Martyred President, the slain God of
Harvest, the Bringer of Good Crops. Duke Gant of Westmoreland,
Viscount Pondicherry, twelfth Lord Runnymede, who hunts for true
love, incognito, in Devon and ripe grain, and finds the calico
white legs embedded in sweet hay. Yes, George-Gordon-Noel-Byron
Gant, carrying the pageant of his bleeding heart through Europe,
and Thomas-Chatterton Gant (that bright boy!), and
Fran&ccedil;ois-Villon Gant, and Ahasuerus Gant, and Mithridates
Gant, and Artaxerxes Gant, and Edward-the- Black-Prince Gant;
Stilicho Gant, and Jugurtha Gant, and Vercingetorix Gant, and
Czar-Ivan-the-Terrible Gant. And Gant, the Olympian Bull; and
Heracles Gant; and Gant, the Seductive Swan; and Ashtaroth and
Azrael Gant, Proteus Gant, Anubis and Osiris and Mumbo-Jumbo
Gant.</p>
<p>But what, said Eugene very slowly into the darkness, if I'm
not a Genius? He did not ask himself the question often. He was
alone: he spoke aloud, but in a low voice, in order to feel the
unreality of this blasphemy. It was a moonless night, full of
stars. There was no thunder and no lightning.</p>
<p>Yes, but what, he thought with a livid snarl, but what if
anybody else thinks I'm not? Ah, but they'd like to, the swine.
They hate me, and are jealous of me because they can't be like
me, so they belittle me if they can. They'd like to say it, if
they dared, just to hurt me. For a moment his face was convulsed
with pain and bitterness: he craned his neck, holding his throat
with his hand.</p>
<p>Then, as was his custom, when he had burnt his heart out, he
began to look nakedly and critically at the question.</p>
<p>Well, he went on very calmly, what if I'm not? Am I going to
cut my throat, or eat worms, or swallow arsenic? He shook his
head slowly but emphatically. No, he said, I am not. Besides,
there are enough geniuses. They have at least one in every high
school, and one in the orchestra of every small-town movie.
Sometimes Mrs. Von Zeck, the wealthy patroness of the arts, sends
a genius or two off to New York to study. So that, he estimated,
this broad land of ours has by the census not less than 26,400
geniuses and 83,752 artists, not counting those in business and
advertising. For his personal satisfaction, Eugene then muttered
over the names of 21 geniuses who wrote poetry, and 37 more who
devoted themselves to the drama and the novel. After this, he
felt quite relieved.</p>
<p>What, he thought, can I be, besides a genius? I've been one
long enough. There must be better things to do.</p>
<p>Over that final hedge, he thought, not death, as I once
believed&mdash;but new life&mdash;and new lands.</p>
<p>Erect, with arm akimbo on his hip, he stood, his domed head
turned out toward the light: sixty, subtle and straight of body,
deep- browed, with an old glint of hawk-eyes, lean apple-cheeks,
a mustache bristle-cropped. That face on which the condor Thought
has fed, arched with high subtle malice, sophist glee.</p>
<p>Below, benched in rapt servility, they waited for his first
husky word. Eugene looked at the dull earnest faces, lured from
the solid pews of Calvinism to the shadowland of metaphysics. And
now his mockery will play like lightning around their heads, but
they will never see it, nor feel it strike. They will rush
forward to wrestle with his shadow, to hear his demon's laughter,
to struggle solemnly with their unborn souls.</p>
<p>The clean cuffed hand holds up an abraded stick. Their stare
follows obediently along its lustre.</p>
<p>"Mr. Willis?"</p>
<p>White, bewildered, servile, the patient slave's face.</p>
<p>"Yes, sir."</p>
<p>"What have I here?"</p>
<p>"A stick, sir."</p>
<p>"What is a stick?"</p>
<p>"It's a piece of wood, sir."</p>
<p>A pause. Ironic eyebrows ask their laughter. They snicker
smugly for the wolf that will devour them.</p>
<p>"Mr. Willis says a stick is a piece of wood."</p>
<p>Their laughter rattles against the walls. Absurd.</p>
<p>"But a stick IS a piece of wood," says Mr. Willis.</p>
<p>"So is a tree or a telephone-pole. No, I'm afraid that will
not do. Does the class agree with Mr. Willis?"</p>
<p>"A stick is a piece of wood cut off at a certain length."</p>
<p>"Then we agree, Mr. Ransom, that a stick is not simply wood
with unlimited extension?"</p>
<p>The stunned peasant's face with its blink of effort.</p>
<p>"I see that Mr. Gant is leaning forward in his seat. There is
a light in his face that I have seen there before. Mr. Gant will
not sleep of nights, for thinking."</p>
<p>"A stick," said Eugene, "is not only wood but the negation of
wood. It is the meeting in Space of Wood and No-Wood. A stick is
finite and unextended wood, a fact determined by its own
denial."</p>
<p>The old head listens gravely above the ironic intake of their
breath. He will bear me out and praise me, for I am measured
against this peasant earth. He sees me with the titles of proud
office; and he loves victory.</p>
<p>"We have a new name for him, Professor Weldon," said Nick
Mabley. "We call him Hegel Gant."</p>
<p>He listened to their shout of laughter; he saw their pleased
faces turn back on him. That was meant well. I shall
smile&mdash;their Great Original, the beloved eccentric, the poet
of substantial yokels.</p>
<p>"That's a name he may be worthy of," said Vergil Weldon
seriously.</p>
<p>Old Fox, I too can juggle with your phrases so they will never
catch me. Over the jungle of their wits our unfoiled minds strike
irony and passion. Truth? Reality? The Absolute? The Universal?
Wisdom? Experience? Knowledge? The Fact? The Concept?
Death&mdash;the great negation? Parry and thrust, Volpone! Have
we not words? We shall prove anything. But Ben, and the
demon-flicker of his smile? Where now?</p>
<p>The Spring comes back. I see the sheep upon the hill. The
belled cows come along the road in wreaths of dust, and the
wagons creak home below the pale ghost of the moon. But what
stirs within the buried heart? Where are the lost words? And who
has seen his shadow in the Square?</p>
<p>"And if they asked you, Mr. Rountree?"</p>
<p>"I'd have told the truth," said Mr. Rountree, removing his
glasses.</p>
<p>"But they had built a good big fire, Mr. Rountree."</p>
<p>"That doesn't matter," said Mr. Rountree, putting his glasses
on again.</p>
<p>How nobly we can die for truth&mdash;in conversation.</p>
<p>"It was a very hot fire, Mr. Rountree. They'd have burned you
if you hadn't recanted."</p>
<p>"Ah. I'd have let them burn," said the martyred Rountree
through moistening spectacles.</p>
<p>"I think it might be painful," Vergil Weldon suggested. "Even
a little blister hurts."</p>
<p>"Who wants to be burned for anything?" said Eugene. "I'd have
done what Galileo did&mdash;backed out of it."</p>
<p>"So should I," said Vergil Weldon, and their faces arched with
gleeful malice over the heavy laughter of the class.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, it moves.</p>
<p>"On one side of the table stood the combined powers of Europe;
on the other stood Martin Luther, the son of a blacksmith."</p>
<p>The voice of husky passion, soul-shaken. This they can
remember, and put down.</p>
<p>"There, if ever, was a situation to try the strongest soul.
But the answer came like a flash. Ich kann nicht anders&mdash;I
can't do otherwise. It was one of the great utterances of
history."</p>
<p>That phrase, used now for thirty years, relic of Yale and
Harvard: Royce and Munsterberg. In all this jugglery, the Teutons
were Weldon's masters, yet mark how thirstily the class lap it
up. He will not let them read, lest some one find the rag-quilt
of his takings from Zeno to Immanuel Kant. The crazy patchwork of
three thousand years, the forced marriage of irreconcilables, the
summation of all thought, in his old head. Socrates begat Plato.
Plato begat Plotinus. Plotinus begat St. Augustine....Kant begat
Hegel. Hegel begat Vergil Weldon. Here we pause. There's no more
to beget. An Answer to All Things in Thirty Easy Lessons. How
sure they are they've found it!</p>
<p>And to-night they will carry their dull souls into his study,
will make unfleshly confessions, will writhe in concocted
tortures of the spirit, revealing struggles that they never had.
"It took character to do a thing like that. It took a man who
refused to crack under pressure. And that is what I want my boys
to do! I want them to succeed! I want them to absorb their
negations. I want them to keep as clean as a hound's tooth!"</p>
<p>Eugene winced, and looked around on all the faces set in a
resolve to fight desperately for monogamy, party politics, and
the will of the greatest number.</p>
<p>And yet the Baptists fear this man! Why? He has taken the
whiskers off their God, but for the rest, he has only taught them
to vote the ticket.</p>
<p>So here is Hegel in the Cotton Belt!</p>
<p>During these years Eugene would go away from Pulpit Hill, by
night and by day, when April was a young green blur, or when the
Spring was deep and ripe. But he liked best to go away by night,
rushing across a cool Spring countryside full of dew and
starlight, under a great beach of the moon ribbed with
clouds.</p>
<p>He would go to Exeter or Sydney; sometimes he would go to
little towns he had never before visited. He would register at
hotels as "Robert Herrick," "John Donne," "George Peele,"
"William Blake," and "John Milton." No one ever said anything to
him about it. The people in those small towns had such names.
Once he registered at a hotel, in a small Piedmont town, as "Ben
Jonson."</p>
<p>The clerk spun the book critically.</p>
<p>"Isn't there an h in that name?" he said.</p>
<p>"No," said Eugene. "That's another branch of the family. I
have an uncle, Samuel, who spells his name that way."</p>
<p>Sometimes, at hotels of ill-repute, he would register, with
dark buried glee, as "Robert Browning," "Alfred Tennyson," and
"William Wordsworth."</p>
<p>Once he registered as "Henry W. Longfellow."</p>
<p>"You can't fool me," said the clerk, with a hard grin of
disbelief. "That's the name of a writer."</p>
<p>He was devoured by a vast strange hunger for life. At night,
he listened to the million-noted ululation of little night
things, the great brooding symphony of dark, the ringing of
remote churchbells across the country. And his vision widened out
in circles over moon-drenched meadows, dreaming woods, mighty
rivers going along in darkness, and ten thousand sleeping towns.
He believed in the infinite rich variety of all the towns and
faces: behind any of a million shabby houses he believed there
was strange buried life, subtle and shattered romance, something
dark and unknown. At the moment of passing any house, he thought,
some one therein might be at the gate of death, lovers might lie
twisted in hot embrace, murder might be doing.</p>
<p>He felt a desperate frustration, as if he were being shut out
from the rich banquet of life. And against all caution, he
determined to break the pattern of custom, and look within.
Driven on by this hunger, he would suddenly rush away from Pulpit
Hill and, as dusk came on, prowl up and down the quiet streets of
towns. Finally, lifted beyond all restraint, he would mount
swiftly to a door and ring the bell. Then, to whoever came,
reeling against the wall and clutching at his throat, he would
say:</p>
<p>"Water! In God's name, water! I am ill!"</p>
<p>Sometimes there were women, seductive and smiling, aware of
his trick, but loath to let him go; sometimes women touched with
compassion and tenderness. Then, having drunk, he would smile
with brave apology into startled and sympathetic faces,
murmuring:</p>
<p>"Pardon me. It came on suddenly&mdash;one of my attacks. I had
no time to go for help. I saw your light."</p>
<p>Then they would ask him where his friends were.</p>
<p>"Friends!" he glanced about wildly and darkly. Then, with a
bitter laugh, he said, "Friends! I have none! I am a stranger
here."</p>
<p>Then they would ask him what he did.</p>
<p>"I am a Carpenter," he would answer, smiling strangely.</p>
<p>Then they would ask him where he came from.</p>
<p>"Far away. Very far," he would say deeply. "You would not know
if I told you."</p>
<p>Then he would rise, looking about him with grandeur and
compassion.</p>
<p>"And now I must go!" he would say mysteriously. "I have a long
way to go before my journey is done. God bless you all! I was a
stranger and you gave me shelter. The Son of Man was treated not
so well."</p>
<p>Sometimes, he would ring bells with an air of timid inquiry,
saying:</p>
<p>"Is this number 26? My name is Thomas Chatterton. I am looking
for a gentleman by the name of Coleridge&mdash;Mr. Samuel T.
Coleridge. Does he live here?...No? I'm sorry....Yes, 26 is the
number I have, I'm sure....Thank you...I've made a mistake...I'll
look it up in the telephone directory."</p>
<p>But what, thought Eugene, if one day, in the million streets
of life, I should really find him?</p>
<p>These were the golden years.</p>
<h3>39</h3>
<p>Gant and Eliza came to his graduation. He found them lodgings
in the town: it was early June&mdash;hot, green, fiercely and
voluptuously Southern. The campus was a green oven; the old grads
went about in greasy pairs; the cool pretty girls, who never
sweated, came in to see their young men graduate, and to dance;
the mamas and papas were shown about dumbly and shyly.</p>
<p>The college was charming, half-deserted. Most of the students,
except the graduating class, had departed. The air was charged
with the fresh sensual heat, the deep green shimmer of heavy
leafage, a thousand spermy earth and flower-scents. The young men
were touched with sadness, with groping excitement, with
glory.</p>
<p>On this rich stage, Gant, who had left his charnel-house of
death for three days, saw his son Eugene. He came, gathered to
life again, out of his grave. He saw his son enthroned in all the
florid sentiment of commencement, and the whole of his heart was
lifted out of the dust. Upon the lordly sward, shaded by great
trees, and ringed by his solemn classmen and their families,
Eugene read the Class Poem ("O Mother Of Our Myriad Hopes"). Then
Vergil Weldon spoke, high-husky, deep, and solemn-sad; and Living
Truth welled in their hearts. It was a Great Utterance. Be true!
Be clean! Be good! Be men! Absorb the Negation! The world has
need of. Life was never so worth. Never in history had there
been. No other class had shown so great a promise as. Among other
achievements, the editor of the paper had lifted the moral and
intellectual level of the State two inches. The university
spirit! Character! Service! Leadership!</p>
<p>Eugene's face grew dark with pride and joy there in the lovely
wilderness. He could not speak. There was a glory in the world:
life was panting for his embrace.</p>
<p>Eliza and Gant listened attentively to all the songs and
speeches. Their son was a great man on the campus. They saw and
heard him before his class, on the campus, and at graduation,
when his prizes and honors were announced. And his teachers and
companions spoke to them about him, and said he would have "a
brilliant career." And Eliza and Gant were touched a little by
the false golden glow of youth. They believed for a moment that
all things were possible.</p>
<p>"Well, son," said Gant, "the rest is up to you now. I believe
you're going to make a name for yourself." He laid a great dry
hand clumsily upon his son's shoulder, and for a moment Eugene
saw in the dead eyes the old dark of umber and unfound
desire.</p>
<p>"Hm!" Eliza began, with a tremulous bantering smile, "your
head will get turned by all the things they're saying about you."
She took his hand in her rough warm grasp. Her eyes grew suddenly
wet.</p>
<p>"Well, son," she said gravely. "I want you to go ahead now and
try to be Somebody. None of the others ever had your opportunity,
and I hope you do something with it. Your papa and I have done
the best we could. The rest is up to you."</p>
<p>He took her hand in a moment of wild devotion and kissed
it.</p>
<p>"I'll do something," he said. "I will."</p>
<p>They looked shyly at his strange dark face, with all its
passionate and na&iuml;ve ardor, and they felt tenderness and
love for his youth and all that was unknown to it. And a great
love and pity welled up in him because of their strange and
awkward loneliness, and because he felt, through some terrible
intuition, that he was already indifferent to the titles and
honors they desired for him, and because those which he had come
to desire for himself were already beyond the scale of their
value. And, before the vision of pity and loss and loneliness, he
turned away, clutching his lean hand into his throat.</p>
<p>It was over. Gant, who under the stimulus of his son's
graduation had almost regained the vitality of his middle years,
relapsed now into whining dotage. The terrible heat came down and
smote him. He faced with terror and weariness the long hot trip
into the hills again.</p>
<p>"Merciful God!" he whined. "Why did I ever come! O Jesus, how
will I ever face that trip again! I can't bear it. I'll die
before I get there! It's fearful, it's awful, it's cruel." And he
wept weak snuffling sobs.</p>
<p>Eugene took them to Exeter and got them comfortably disposed
in a Pullman. He was remaining for a few days to gather his
belongings&mdash;the clutter of four years, letters, books, old
manuscript, worthless rubbish of every description, for he seemed
to inherit Eliza's mania for blind accumulation. Extravagant with
money, and unable to husband it, he saved everything else even
when his spirit grew sick at the stale and dusty weariness of the
past.</p>
<p>"Well, son," said Eliza, in the quiet moment before departure.
"Have you thought yet of what you're going to do?"</p>
<p>"Yes," said Gant, wetting his thumb, "for you've got to shift
for yourself from now on. You've had the best education money can
buy. The rest is up to you."</p>
<p>"I'll talk to you in a few days when I see you at home," said
Eugene. "I'll tell you about it then."</p>
<p>Mercifully the train began to move: he kissed them quickly and
ran down the aisle.</p>
<p>He had nothing to tell them. He was nineteen; he had completed
his college course; but he did not know what he was going to do.
His father's plan that he should study law and "enter politics"
had been forgotten since his sophomore year, when it became
apparent that the impulse of his life was not toward law. His
family felt obscurely that he was an eccentric&mdash;"queer,"
they called it&mdash;and of an impractical or "literary"
turn.</p>
<p>Without asking sharply why, they felt the absurdity of
clothing this bounding figure, with the wild dark face, in a
frock-coat and string tie: he did not exist in business, trade,
or law. More vaguely, they classified him as bookish and a
dreamer&mdash;Eliza referred to him as "a good scholar," which,
in fact, he had never been. He had simply performed brilliantly
in all things that touched his hunger, and dully, carelessly, and
indifferently in all things that did not. No one saw very clearly
what he was going to do&mdash;he, surely, least of all&mdash;but
his family, following the tack of his comrades, spoke vaguely and
glibly of "a career in journalism." This meant newspaper work.
And, however unsatisfactory this may have been, their inevitable
question was drugged for the moment by the glitter of success
that had surrounded his life at the university.</p>
<p>But Eugene was untroubled by thought of a goal. He was mad
with such ecstasy as he had never known. He was a centaur,
moon-eyed and wild of mane, torn apart with hunger for the golden
world. He became at times almost incapable of coherent speech.
While talking with people, he would whinny suddenly into their
startled faces, and leap away, his face contorted with an idiot
joy. He would hurl himself squealing through the streets and
along the paths, touched with the ecstasy of a thousand unspoken
desires. The world lay before him for his picking&mdash;full of
opulent cities, golden vintages, glorious triumphs, lovely women,
full of a thousand unmet and magnificent possibilities. Nothing
was dull or tarnished. The strange enchanted coasts were
unvisited. He was young and he could never die.</p>
<p>He went back to Pulpit Hill for two or three days of
delightful loneliness in the deserted college. He prowled through
the empty campus at midnight under the great moons of the late
rich Spring; he breathed the thousand rich odors of tree and
grass and flower, of the opulent and seductive South; and he felt
a delicious sadness when he thought of his departure, and saw
there in the moon the thousand phantom shapes of the boys he had
known who would come no more.</p>
<p>And in the day he went to talk with Vergil Weldon. The old man
was charming, confidential, full of wise intimacy, gentle humor.
They sat beneath the great trees of his yard and drank iced tea.
Eugene was thinking of California, Peru, Asia, Alaska, Europe,
Africa, China. But he mentioned Harvard. For him, it was not the
name of a university&mdash;it was rich magic, wealth, elegance,
joy, proud loneliness, rich books and golden browsing; it was an
enchanted name like Cairo and Damascus. And he felt somehow that
it gave a reason, a goal of profit, to his wild ecstasy.</p>
<p>"Yes," said Vergil Weldon approvingly. "It's the place for
you, Mr. Gant. It doesn't matter about the others. They're ready
now. But a mind like yours must not be pulled green. You must
give it a chance to ripen. There you will find yourself."</p>
<p>And he talked enchantingly about the good free life of the
mind, cloistered study, the rich culture of the city, and about
the food. "They give you food there that a man can eat, Mr.
Gant," he said. "Your mind can do its work on it." Then he spoke
of his own student days there, and of the great names of Royce
and Everett, and William James.</p>
<p>Eugene looked with passionate devotion at the grand old head,
calm, wise and comforting. In a moment of vision, he saw that,
for him, here was the last of the heroes, the last of those
giants to whom we give the faith of our youth, believing like
children that the riddle of our lives may be solved by their
quiet judgment. He believed, and no experience, he knew, would
ever make him disbelieve, that one of the great lives of his time
had unfolded itself quietly in the little college town.</p>
<p>Oh, my old Sophist, he thought. What were all the old
philosophies that you borrowed and pranked up to your fancy, to
you, who were greater than all? What was the Science of Thinking,
to you, who were Thought? What if all your ancient game of
metaphysics never touched the dark jungle of my soul? Do you
think you have replaced my childhood's God with your Absolute?
No, you have only replaced his beard with a mustache, and a glint
of demon hawk-eyes. To me, you were above good, above truth,
above righteousness. To me, you were the sufficient negation to
all your teachings. Whatever you did was, by its doing, right.
And now I leave you throned in memory. You will see my dark face
burning on your bench no more; the memory of me will grow mixed
and broken; new boys will come to win your favor and your praise.
But you? Forever fixed, unfading, bright, my lord.</p>
<p>Then, while the old man talked, Eugene leaped suddenly to his
feet, and grasped the lean hand tightly in his own.</p>
<p>"Mr. Weldon!" he said. "Mr. Weldon! You are a great man! I
shall never forget you!"</p>
<p>Then, turning, he plunged off blindly down the path.</p>
<p>He still loitered, although his baggage had been packed for
days. With a desperate pain, he faced departure from that
Arcadian wilderness where he had known so much joy. At night he
roamed the deserted campus, talking quietly until morning with a
handful of students who lingered strangely, as he did, among the
ghostly buildings, among the phantoms of lost boys. He could not
face a final departure. He said he would return early in autumn
for a few days, and at least once a year thereafter.</p>
<p>Then one hot morning, on sudden impulse, he left. As the car
that was taking him to Exeter roared down the winding street,
under the hot green leafiness of June, he heard, as from the
sea-depth of a dream, far-faint, the mellow booming of the campus
bell. And suddenly it seemed to him that all the beaten walks
were thudding with the footfalls of lost boys, himself among
them, running for their class. Then, as he listened, the far bell
died away, and the phantom runners thudded into oblivion. Soon
the car roared up by Vergil Weldon's house, and as he passed, he
saw the old man sitting below his tree.</p>
<p>Eugene stood up in the car and waved his long arm in a gesture
of farewell.</p>
<p>"Good-bye," he cried. "Good-bye."</p>
<p>The old man stood up with a quiet salute of parting, slow,
calm, eloquently tender.</p>
<p>Then, even while Eugene stood looking back upon the street,
the car roared up across the lip of the hill, and drove steeply
down into the hot parched countryside below. But as the lost
world faded from his sight, Eugene gave a great cry of pain and
sadness, for he knew that the elfin door had closed behind him,
and that he would never come back again.</p>
<p>He saw the vast rich body of the hills, lush with billowing
greenery, ripe-bosomed, dappled by far-floating cloud-shadows.
But it was, he knew, the end.</p>
<p>Far-forested, the horn-note wound. He was wild with the hunger
for release: the vast champaign of earth stretched out for him
its limitless seduction.</p>
<p>It was the end, the end. It was the beginning of the voyage,
the quest of new lands.</p>
<p>Gant was dead. Gant was living, death-in-life. In his big back
room at Eliza's he waited death, lost and broken in a semi-life
of petulant memory. He hung to life by a decayed filament, a
corpse lit by infrequent flares of consciousness. The sudden
death whose menace they had faced so long that it had lost its
meaning, had never come to him. It had come where they had least
expected it&mdash;to Ben. And the conviction which Eugene had had
at Ben's death, more than a year and a half before, was now a
materialized certainty. The great wild pattern of the family had
been broken forever. The partial discipline that had held them
together had been destroyed by the death of their brother: the
nightmare of waste and loss had destroyed their hope. With an
insane fatalism they had surrendered to the savage chaos of
life.</p>
<p>Except for Eliza. She was sixty, sound of body and mind,
triumphantly healthy. She still ran Dixieland, but she had given
up the boarders for roomers, and most of the duties of management
she intrusted to an old maid who lived in the house. Eliza
devoted most of her time to real estate.</p>
<p>She had, during the past year, got final control of Gant's
property. She had begun to sell it immediately and ruthlessly,
over his indifferent mutter of protest. She had sold the old
house on Woodson Street for $7,000&mdash;a good enough price, she
had said, considering the neighborhood. But, stark, bare, and
raw, stripped of its girdling vines, annex now to a quack's
sanitarium for "nervous diseases," the rich labor of their life
was gone. In this, more than in anything else, Eugene saw the
final disintegration of his family.</p>
<p>Eliza had also sold a wild tract of mountain farmland for
$6,000, fifty acres on the Reynoldsville road for $15,000, and
several smaller pieces. Finally she had sold Gant's shop upon the
Square for $25,000 to a syndicate of real estate people who were
going to erect on the site the town's first "skyscraper." With
this money as capital, she began to "trade," buying, selling,
laying down options, in an intricate and bewildering web.</p>
<p>"Dixieland" itself had become enormously valuable. The street
which she had foreseen years before had been cut through behind
her boundaries: she lacked thirty feet of meeting the golden
highway, but she had bought the intervening strip, paying without
complaint a stiff price. Since then she had refused, with a
puckered smile, an offer of $100,000 for her property.</p>
<p>She was obsessed. She talked real estate unendingly. She spent
half her time talking to real estate men; they hovered about the
house like flesh-flies. She drove off with them several times a
day to look at property. As her land investments grew in amount
and number, she became insanely niggardly in personal
expenditure. She would fret loudly if a light was kept burning in
the house, saying that ruin and poverty faced her. She seldom ate
unless the food was given to her; she went about the house
holding a cup of weak coffee and a crust of bread. A stingy
careless breakfast was the only meal to which Luke and Eugene
could look forward with any certainty: with angry guffaw and
chortle, they ate, wedged in the little pantry&mdash;the
dining-room had been turned over to the roomers.</p>
<p>Gant was fed and cared for by Helen. She moved back and forth
in ceaseless fret between Eliza's house and Hugh Barton's, in
constant rhythms of wild energy and depletion, anger, hysteria,
weariness and indifference. She had had no children and, it
seemed, would have none. For this reason, she had long periods of
brooding morbidity, during which she drugged herself with
nibbling potations of patent tonics, medicines with a high
alcoholic content, home- made wines, and corn whiskey. Her large
eyes grew lustreless and dull, her big mouth had a strain of
hysteria about it, she would pluck at her long chin and burst
suddenly into tears. She talked restlessly, fretfully,
incessantly, wasting and losing herself in a net of snarled
nerves, in endless gossip, incoherent garrulity about the
townsfolk, the neighbors, disease, doctors, hospitals, death.</p>
<p>The deliberate calm of Hugh Barton sometimes goaded her to a
frenzy. He would sit at night, oblivious of her tirade, gravely
chewing his long cigar, absorbed in his charts, or in a late
issue of System or of The American Magazine. This power of losing
himself in solitary absorption would madden her. She did not know
what she wanted, but his silence before her exasperated
indictment of life drove her to frenzy. She would rush at him
with a sob of rage, knock the magazine from his hands, and seize
his thinning hair in the grip of her long fingers.</p>
<p>"You answer when I speak!" she cried, panting with hysteria.
"I'm not going to sit here, night after night, while you sit
buried in a story. The idea! The idea!" She burst into tears. "I
might as well have married a dummy."</p>
<p>"Well, I'm willing to talk to you," he protested sourly, "but
nothing I say to you seems to suit you. What do you want me to
say?"</p>
<p>It seemed, indeed, when she was in this temper, that she could
not be pleased. She was annoyed and irritable if people agreed
carefully with all her utterances; she was annoyed equally by
their disagreement and by their silence. A remark about the
weather, the most studiously uncontroversial opinion, aroused her
annoyance.</p>
<p>Sometimes at night she would weep hysterically upon her
pillow, and turn fiercely upon her mate.</p>
<p>"Leave me! Go away! Get out! I hate you!"</p>
<p>He would rise obediently and go downstairs, but before he
reached the living-room she would call fearfully after him,
asking him to return.</p>
<p>She lavished kisses and abuse on him by turns: the mothering
tenderness, in which she was drowning for want of a child, she
poured out on a dirty little mongrel dog which had trotted in
from the streets one night, half-dead from starvation. He was a
snarling little brute with a rough black-and-white pelt, and an
ugly lift of teeth for every one but his master and mistress, but
he had grown waddling-fat upon choice meats and livers; he slept
warmly on a velvet cushion and rode out with them, snarling at
passers-by. She smothered the little cur with slaps and kisses,
devoured him with baby-talk, and hated any one who disliked his
mongrel viciousness. But most of her time, her love, her blazing
energy, she gave to the care of her father. Her feeling toward
Eliza was more bitter than ever: it was one of constant
chaffering irritability, mounting at times to hatred. She would
rail against her mother for hours:</p>
<p>"I believe she's gone crazy. Don't you think so? Sometimes I
think we ought to get guardians appointed and keep her under
custody. Do you know that I buy almost every bite of food that
goes into that house? Do you? If it weren't for me, she'd let him
die right under her eyes. Don't you know she would? She's got so
stingy she won't even buy food for herself. Why, good heavens!"
she burst out in strong exasperation. "It's not my place to do
those things. He's her husband, not mine! Do you think it's
right? Do you?" And she would almost weep with rage.</p>
<p>And she would burst out on Eliza, thus: "Mama, in God's name!
Are you going to let that poor old man in there die for lack of
proper care? Can't you ever get it into your head that papa's a
sick man? He's got to have good food and decent treatment."</p>
<p>And Eliza, confused and disturbed, would answer: "Why, child!
What on earth do you mean? I took him in a big bowl of vegetable
soup myself, for his lunch: he ate it all up without stopping.
'Why, pshaw! Mr. Gant,' I said (just to cheer him up), 'I don't
believe there can be much wrong with any one with an appetite
like that. Why, say,' I said..."</p>
<p>"Oh, for heaven's sake!" cried Helen furiously. "Papa's a sick
man. Aren't you ever going to understand that? Surely Ben's death
should have taught us something," her voice ended in a scream of
exasperation.</p>
<p>Gant was a spectre in waxen yellow. His disease, which had
thrust out its branches to all parts of his body, gave him an
appearance of almost transparent delicacy. His mind was sunken
out of life in a dim shadowland: he listened wearily and
indifferently to all the brawling clamor around him, crying out
and weeping when he felt pain, cold, or hunger, smiling when he
was comfortable and at ease. He was taken back to Baltimore two
or three times a year now for radium treatments: he had a brief
flare of vitality and ease after each visit, but every one knew
his relief would be only temporary. His body was a rotten fabric
which had thus far miraculously held together.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Eliza talked incessantly about real estate, bought,
sold and traded. About her own ventures she was insanely
secretive; she would smile craftily when questioned about them,
wink in a knowing fashion, and make a bantering noise in her
throat.</p>
<p>"I'm not telling all I know," she said.</p>
<p>This goaded her daughter's bitter curiosity almost past
endurance, for, despite her angry mockery, the mania for property
had bitten into her and Hugh Barton as well: secretly they
respected Eliza's shrewdness and got her advice on property into
which he was putting all his surplus earnings. But when Eliza
refused to reveal her own investments, the girl would cry out in
a baffled hysteria:</p>
<p>"She has no right to do that! Don't you know she hasn't? It's
papa's property just as much as hers, you know. If she should die
now, that estate would be in a terrible mess. No one knows what
she's done: how much she's bought and sold. I don't think she
knows herself. She keeps her notes and papers hidden away in
little drawers and boxes."</p>
<p>Her distrust and fear had been so great that, much to Eliza's
annoyance, she had persuaded Gant, a year or two before, to make
a will: he had left $5,000 to each of his five children, and the
remainder of his property and money to his wife. And, as the
summer advanced, she again persuaded him to appoint as executors
the two people in whose honesty she had the greatest trust: Hugh
Barton and Luke Gant.</p>
<p>To Luke, who, since his discharge from the navy, had been
salesman, in the mountain district, for electrical farm-lighting
plants, she said:</p>
<p>"We're the ones who've always had the interests of the family
at heart, and we've had nothing for it. We've been the generous
ones, but Eugene and Steve will get it all in the end. 'Gene's
had everything: we've had nothing. Now he's talking of going to
Harvard. Had you heard about that?"</p>
<p>"His m-m-m-majesty!" said Luke ironically. "Who's going to
p-p-p- pay the bills?"</p>
<p>Thus, as the summer waned, over the slow horror of Gant's
death was waged this ugly warfare of greed and hatred. Steve came
in from Indiana; within four days he was insane from whiskey and
veronal. He began to follow Eugene around the house, backing him
ominously into corners, seizing him belligerently by the arm, as
he breathed upon him his foul yellow stench, and spoke to him
with maudlin challenge.</p>
<p>"I've never had your chance. Every one was down on Stevie. If
he'd had the chance some folks have, he'd be right up there with
the Big Boys now. And at that, he's got more brains than a lot of
people I know who've been to college. You get that, don't
you?"</p>
<p>He thrust his pustulate face, foul and snarling, close to
Eugene's.</p>
<p>"Get away, Steve! Get away!" the boy muttered. He tried to
move, but his brother blocked him. "I tell you to get away, you
swine!" he screamed suddenly, and he struck the evil face away
from him.</p>
<p>Then, as Steve sprawled dazed and witless on the floor, Luke
sprang upon him with stammering curse, and, past reason, began to
drag him up and down. And Eugene sprang upon Luke to stop him,
and all three stammered and cursed and begged and accused, while
the roomers huddled at the door, and Eliza wept, calling for
help, and Daisy, who was up from the South with her children,
wrung her plump hands, moaning "Oh, they'll kill him! They'll
kill him. Have mercy on me and my poor little children, I beg of
you."</p>
<p>Then the shame, the disgust, the maudlin grievance, the
weeping women, the excited men.</p>
<p>"You m-m-m-miserable degenerate!" cried Luke. "You c-c-came
home because you thought p-p-p-papa would die and leave you a
little money. You d-d-don't deserve a penny!"</p>
<p>"I know what you're trying to do," Steve screamed in an agony
of suspicion. "You're all against me! You've framed up on me and
you're trying to beat me out of my share."</p>
<p>He was weeping with genuine rage and fear, with the angry
suspicion of a beaten child. Eugene looked at him with pity and
nausea: he was so foul, whipped, and frightened. Then, with a
sense of unreal horror and disbelief, he listened while they
bawled out their accusations. This disease of money and greed
tainted other people, the people in books, not one's own. They
were snarling like curs over one bone&mdash;their little shares
in the money of an unburied dead man who lay, with low moanings
of disease, not thirty feet away.</p>
<p>The family drew off in two camps of hostile watchfulness:
Helen and Luke on one side and Daisy and Steve, subdued but
stubborn, on the other. Eugene, who had no talent for parties,
cruised through sidereal space with momentary anchorings to
earth. He loafed along the avenue, and lounged in Wood's; he
gossiped with the pharmacy rakes; he courted the summer girls on
boarding-house porches; he visited Roy Brock in a high mountain
village, and lay with a handsome girl in the forest; he went to
South Carolina; he was seduced by a dentist's wife at Dixieland.
She was a prim ugly woman of forty-three, who wore glasses and
had sparse hair. She was a Daughter of the Confederacy and wore
the badge constantly on her starched waists.</p>
<p>He thought of her only as a very chill and respectable woman.
He played Casino&mdash;the only game he knew&mdash;with her and
the other boarders, and called her "ma'am." Then one night she
took his hand, saying she would show him how to make love to a
girl. She tickled the palm, put it around her waist, lifted it to
her breast, and plumped over on his shoulder, breathing
stertorously through her pinched nostrils and saying, "God, boy!"
over and over. He plunged around the dark cool streets until
three in the morning, wondering what he would do about it. Then
he came back to the sleeping house, and crept on shoeless feet
into her room. Fear and disgust were immediate. He climbed the
hills to ease his tortured spirit and stayed away from the house
for hours. But she would follow him down the halls or open her
door suddenly on him, clad in a red kimono. She became very ugly
and bitter, and accused him of betraying, dishonoring, and
deserting her. She said that where she came from&mdash;the good
old State of South Carolina&mdash;a man who treated a woman in
such fashion would get a bullet in him. Eugene thought of new
lands. He was in an agony of repentance and guilty abasement: he
framed a long plea for pardon and included it in his prayers at
night, for he still prayed, not from devout belief, but from the
superstition of habit and number, muttering a set formula over
sixteen times, while he held his breath. Since childhood he had
believed in the magical efficacy of certain numbers&mdash;on
Sunday he would do only the second thing that came into his head
and not the first&mdash;and this intricate ritual of number and
prayer he was a slave to, not to propitiate God, but to fulfil a
mysterious harmonic relation with the universe, or to pay worship
to the demonic force that brooded over him. He could not sleep of
nights until he did this.</p>
<p>Eliza finally grew suspicious of the woman, picked a quarrel
with her, and ejected her.</p>
<p>No one said very much to him about going to Harvard. He
himself had no very clear reason for going, and only in
September, a few days before the beginning of the term, decided
to go. He talked about it at intervals during the summer, but,
like all his family, he needed the pressure of immediacy to force
a decision. He was offered employment on several newspapers in
the State, and on the teaching staff of the run-down military
academy that topped a pleasant hill two miles from town.</p>
<p>But in his heart he knew he was going to leave. And no one
opposed him very much. Helen railed against him at times to Luke,
but made only a few indifferent and unfriendly comments to
himself about it. Gant moaned wearily, saying: "Let him do as he
likes. I can't pay out any more money on his education. If he
wants to go, his mother must send him." Eliza pursed her lips
thoughtfully, made a bantering noise, and said:</p>
<p>"Hm! Harvard! That's mighty big talk, boy. Where are you going
to get the money?"</p>
<p>"I can get it," he said darkly. "People will lend it to
me."</p>
<p>"No, son," she said with instant grave caution. "I don't want
you to do anything like that. You mustn't start life by
accumulating debts."</p>
<p>He was silent, trying to force the terrible sentence through
his parched lips.</p>
<p>"Then," he said finally, "why can't I pay my way from my share
in papa's estate?"</p>
<p>"Why, child!" said Eliza angrily. "You talk as if we were
millionaires. I don't even know that there's going to be any
share for anybody. Your papa was persuaded into that against his
better judgment," she added fretfully.</p>
<p>Eugene began to beat suddenly against his ribs.</p>
<p>"I want to go!" he said. "I've got to have it now! Now!"</p>
<p>He was mad with a sense of frustration.</p>
<p>"I don't want it when I'm rotten! I want it now! To hell with
the real estate! I want none of your dirt! I hate it! Let me go!"
he screamed; and in his fury he began to beat his head against
the wall.</p>
<p>Eliza pursed her lips for a moment.</p>
<p>"Well," she said, at length. "I'll send you for a year. Then
we'll see."</p>
<p>But, two or three days before his departure, Luke, who was
taking Gant to Baltimore the next day, thrust a sheet of typed
paper into his hand.</p>
<p>"What is it?" he asked, looking at it with sullen
suspicion.</p>
<p>"Oh, just a little form Hugh wants you to sign, in case
anything should happen. It's a release."</p>
<p>"A release from what?" said Eugene, staring at it.</p>
<p>Then, as his mind picked its way slowly through the glib
jargon of the law, he saw that the paper was an acknowledgment
that he had already received the sum of five thousand dollars in
consideration of college fees and expenses. He lifted his
scowling face to his brother. Luke looked at him for a moment,
then burst into a crazy whah-whah, digging him in the ribs.
Eugene grinned sullenly, and said:</p>
<p>"Give me your pen."</p>
<p>He signed the paper and gave it back to his brother with a
feeling of sad triumph.</p>
<p>"Whah-whah! Now you've done it!" said Luke, with witless
guffaw.</p>
<p>"Yes," said Eugene, "and you think me a fool for it. But I'd
rather be done now than later. That's my release, not yours."</p>
<p>He thought of Hugh Barton's grave foxy face. There was no
victory for him there and he knew it. After all, he thought, I
have my ticket and the money for my escape in my pocket. Now, I
am done with it cleanly. It's a good ending, after all.</p>
<p>When Eliza heard of this occurrence, she protested
sharply:</p>
<p>"Why here!" she said. "They've no right to do that. The
child's still a minor. Your papa always said he intended to give
him his education."</p>
<p>Then, after a thoughtful pause, she said doubtfully: "Well,
we'll see, then. I've promised to send him for a year."</p>
<p>In the darkness by the house, Eugene clutched at his throat.
He wept for all the lovely people who would not come again.</p>
<p>Eliza stood upon the porch, her hands clasped loosely across
her stomach. Eugene was leaving the house and going toward the
town. It was the day before his departure; dusk was coming on,
the hills were blooming in strange purple dusk. Eliza watched him
go.</p>
<p>"Spruce up there, boy!" she called. "Spruce up! Throw your
shoulders back!"</p>
<p>In the dark he knew that she was smiling tremulously at him,
pursing her lips. She caught his low mutter of annoyance:</p>
<p>"Why, yes," she said, nodding briskly. "I'd show them! I'd act
as if I thought I was Somebody. Son," she said more gravely, with
a sudden change from her tremulous banter, "it worries me to see
you walk like that. You'll get lung-trouble as sure as you're
born if you go all humped over. That's one thing about your papa;
he always carried himself as straight as a rod. Of course, he's
not as straight now as he used to be&mdash;as the fellow says"
(she smiled tremulously)&mdash;"I reckon we all have a tendency
to shrink up a little as we get older. But in his young days
there wasn't a straighter man in town."</p>
<p>And then the terrible silence came between them again. He had
turned sullenly upon her while she talked. Indecisively she
stopped, peered down at him with white pursed face, and in that
silence, behind the trivial arras of her talk, he heard the
bitter song of all her life.</p>
<p>The marvellous hills were blooming in the dusk. Eliza pursed
her lips reflectively a moment, then continued:</p>
<p>"Well, when you get way up there&mdash;as the fellow
says&mdash;in Yankeedom, you want to look up your Uncle Emerson
and all your Boston kin. Your Aunt Lucy took a great liking to
you when they were down here&mdash;they always said they'd be
glad to see any of us if we ever came up&mdash;when you're a
stranger in a strange land it's mighty good sometimes to have
some one you know. And say&mdash;when you see your Uncle Emerson,
you might just tell him not to be surprised to see me at any time
now" (she nodded pertly at him)&mdash;"I reckon I can pick right
up and light out the same as the next fellow when I get
ready&mdash;I may just pack up and come&mdash;without saying a
word to any one&mdash;I'm not going to spend all my days slaving
away in the kitchen&mdash;it don't pay&mdash;if I can turn a
couple of trades here this Fall, I may start out to see the world
like I always intended to&mdash;I was talking to Cash Rankin
about it the other day&mdash;'Why, Mrs. Gant,' he said, 'if I had
your head I'd be a rich man in five years&mdash;you're the best
trader in this town,' he said. 'Don't you talk to me about any
more trades,' I said&mdash;'when I get rid of what I've got now
I'm going to get out of it, and not even listen to any one who
says real-estate to me&mdash;we can't take any of it with us,
Cash,' I said&mdash;'there are no pockets in shrouds and we only
need six feet of earth to bury us in the end&mdash;so I'm going
to pull out and begin to enjoy life&mdash;or as the feller
says&mdash;before it's too late'&mdash;'Well, I don't know that I
blame you, Mrs. Gant,' he said&mdash;'I reckon you're
right&mdash;we can't take any of it with us,' he said&mdash;'and
besides, even if we could, what good would it do us where we're
goin'?'&mdash;Now here" (she addressed Eugene with sudden change,
with the old looser masculine gesture of her hand)&mdash;"here's
the thing I'm going to do&mdash;you know that lot I told you I
owned on Sunset Crescent&mdash;"</p>
<p>And now the terrible silence came between them once again.</p>
<p>The marvellous hills were blooming in the dusk. We shall not
come again. We never shall come back again.</p>
<p>Without speech now they faced each other, without speech they
knew each other. In a moment Eliza turned quickly from him and
with the queer unsteady steps with which she had gone out from
the room where Ben lay dying, she moved toward the door.</p>
<p>He rushed back across the walk and with a single bound took
the steps that mounted to the porch. He caught the rough hands
that she held clasped across her body, and drew them swiftly,
fiercely, to his breast.</p>
<p>"Good-bye," he muttered harshly. "Good-bye! Good-bye, mama!" A
wild strange cry, like that of a beast in pain, was torn from his
throat. His eyes were blind with tears; he tried to speak, to get
into a word, a phrase, all the pain, the beauty, and the wonder
of their lives&mdash;every step of that terrible voyage which his
incredible memory and intuition took back to the dwelling of her
womb. But no word came, no word could come; he kept crying
hoarsely again and again, "Good-bye, good-bye."</p>
<p>She understood, she knew all he felt and wanted to say, her
small weak eyes were wet as his with tears, her face was twisted
in the painful grimace of sorrow, and she kept saying:</p>
<p>"Poor child! Poor child! Poor child!" Then she whispered
huskily, faintly: "We must try to love one another."</p>
<p>The terrible and beautiful sentence, the last, the final
wisdom that the earth can give, is remembered at the end, is
spoken too late, wearily. It stands there, awful and untraduced,
above the dusty racket of our lives. No forgetting, no forgiving,
no denying, no explaining, no hating.</p>
<p>O mortal and perishing love, born with this flesh and dying
with this brain, your memory will haunt the earth forever.</p>
<p>And now the voyage out. Where?</p>
<h3>40</h3>
<p>The Square lay under blazing moonlight. The fountain pulsed
with a steady breezeless jet: the water fell upon the pool with a
punctual slap. No one came into the Square.</p>
<p>The chimes of the bank's clock struck the quarter after three
as Eugene entered from the northern edge, by Academy Street.</p>
<p>He came slowly over past the fire department and the City
Hall. On Gant's corner, the Square dipped sharply down toward
Niggertown, as if it had been bent at the edge.</p>
<p>Eugene saw his father's name, faded, on the old brick in
moonlight. On the stone porch of the shop, the angels held their
marble posture. They seemed to have frozen, in the moonlight.</p>
<p>Leaning against the iron railing of the porch, above the
sidewalk, a man stood smoking. Troubled and a little afraid,
Eugene came over. Slowly, he mounted the long wooden steps,
looking carefully at the man's face. It was half-obscured in
shadow.</p>
<p>"Is there anybody there?" said Eugene.</p>
<p>No one answered.</p>
<p>But, as Eugene reached the top, he saw that the man was
Ben.</p>
<p>Ben stared at him a moment without speaking. Although Eugene
could not see his face very well under the obscuring shadow of
his gray felt hat, he knew that he was scowling.</p>
<p>"Ben?" said Eugene doubtfully, faltering a little on the top
step. "Is it you, Ben?"</p>
<p>"Yes," said Ben. In a moment, he added in a surly voice: "Who
did you think it was, you little idiot?"</p>
<p>"I wasn't sure," said Eugene somewhat timidly. "I couldn't see
your face."</p>
<p>They were silent a moment. Then Eugene, clearing his throat in
his embarrassment, said: "I thought you were dead, Ben."</p>
<p>"Ah-h!" said Ben contemptuously, jerking his head sharply
upward. "Listen to this, won't you?"</p>
<p>He drew deeply on his cigarette: the spiral fumes coiled out
and melted in the moon-bright silence.</p>
<p>"No," he said in a moment, quietly. "No, I am not dead."</p>
<p>Eugene came up on the porch and sat down on a limestone base,
up- ended. Ben turned, in a moment, and climbed up on the rail,
bending forward comfortably upon his knees.</p>
<p>Eugene fumbled in his pockets for a cigarette, with fingers
that were stiff and trembling. He was not frightened: he was
speechless with wonder and strong eagerness, and afraid to betray
his thoughts to ridicule. He lighted a cigarette. Presently he
said, painfully, hesitantly, in apology:</p>
<p>"Ben, are you a ghost?"</p>
<p>Ben did not mock.</p>
<p>"No," he said. "I am not a ghost."</p>
<p>There was silence again, while Eugene sought timorously for
words.</p>
<p>"I hope," he began presently, with a small cracked laugh, "I
hope, then, this doesn't mean that I'm crazy?"</p>
<p>"Why not?" said Ben, with a swift flickering grin. "Of course
you're crazy."</p>
<p>"Then," said Eugene slowly, "I'm imagining all this?"</p>
<p>"In heaven's name!" Ben cried irritably. "How should I know?
Imagining all what?"</p>
<p>"What I mean," said Eugene, "is, are we here talking together,
or not?"</p>
<p>"Don't ask me," said Ben. "How should I know?"</p>
<p>With a strong rustle of marble and a cold sigh of weariness,
the angel nearest Eugene moved her stone foot and lifted her arm
to a higher balance. The slender lily stipe shook stiffly in her
elegant cold fingers.</p>
<p>"Did you see that?" Eugene cried excitedly.</p>
<p>"Did I see what?" said Ben, annoyed.</p>
<p>"Th-th-that angel there!" Eugene chattered, pointing with a
trembling finger. "Did you see it move? It lifted its arm."</p>
<p>"What of it?" Ben asked irritably. "It has a right to, hasn't
it? You know," he added with biting sarcasm, "there's no law
against an angel lifting its arm if it wants to."</p>
<p>"No, I suppose not," Eugene admitted slowly, after a moment.
"Only, I've always heard&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Ah! Do you believe all you hear, fool?" Ben cried fiercely.
"Because," he added more calmly, in a moment, drawing on his
cigarette, "you're in a bad way if you do."</p>
<p>There was again silence while they smoked. Then Ben said:</p>
<p>"When are you leaving, 'Gene?"</p>
<p>"To-morrow," Eugene answered.</p>
<p>"Do you know why you are going, or are you just taking a ride
on the train?"</p>
<p>"I know! Of course&mdash;I know why I'm going!" Eugene said
angrily, confused. He stopped abruptly, bewildered, chastened.
Ben continued to scowl at him. Then, quietly, with humility,
Eugene said:</p>
<p>"No, Ben. I don't know why I'm going. Perhaps you're right.
Perhaps I just want a ride on the train."</p>
<p>"When are you coming back, 'Gene?" said Ben.</p>
<p>"Why&mdash;at the end of the year, I think," Eugene
answered.</p>
<p>"No," said Ben, "you're not."</p>
<p>"What do you mean, Ben?" Eugene said, troubled.</p>
<p>"You're not coming back, 'Gene," said Ben softly. "Do you know
that?"</p>
<p>There was a pause.</p>
<p>"Yes," said Eugene, "I know it."</p>
<p>"Why aren't you coming back?" said Ben.</p>
<p>Eugene caught fiercely at the neckband of his shirt with a
clawed hand.</p>
<p>"I want to go! Do you hear!" he cried.</p>
<p>"Yes," said Ben. "So did I. Why do you want to go?"</p>
<p>"There's nothing here for me," Eugene muttered.</p>
<p>"How long have you felt like this?" said Ben.</p>
<p>"Always," said Eugene. "As long as I can remember. But I
didn't know about it until you&mdash;" He stopped.</p>
<p>"Until I what?" said Ben.</p>
<p>There was a pause.</p>
<p>"You are dead, Ben," Eugene muttered. "You must be dead. I saw
you die, Ben." His voice rose sharply. "I tell you, I saw you
die. Don't you remember? The front room upstairs that the
dentist's wife has now? Don't you remember, Ben? Coker, Helen,
Bessie Gant who nursed you, Mrs. Pert? The oxygen tank? I tried
to hold your hands together when they gave it to you." His voice
rose to a scream. "Don't you remember? I tell you, you are dead,
Ben."</p>
<p>"Fool," said Ben fiercely. "I am not dead."</p>
<p>There was a silence.</p>
<p>"Then," said Eugene very slowly, "which of us is the ghost, I
wonder?"</p>
<p>Ben did not answer.</p>
<p>"Is this the Square, Ben? Is it you I'm talking to? Am I
really here or not? And is this moonlight in the Square? Has all
this happened?"</p>
<p>"How should I know?" said Ben again.</p>
<p>Within Gant's shop there was the ponderous tread of marble
feet. Eugene leaped up and peered through the broad sheet of
Jannadeau's dirty window. Upon his desk the strewn vitals of a
watch winked with a thousand tiny points of bluish light. And
beyond the jeweller's fenced space, where moonlight streamed into
the ware- room through the tall side-window, the angels were
walking to and fro like huge wound dolls of stone. The long cold
pleats of their raiment rang with brittle clangor; their full
decent breasts wagged in stony rhythms, and through the
moonlight, with clashing wings the marble cherubim flew round and
round. With cold ewe-bleatings the carved lambs grazed stiffly
across the moon-drenched aisle.</p>
<p>"Do you see it?" cried Eugene. "Do you see it, Ben?"</p>
<p>"Yes," said Ben. "What about it? They have a right to, haven't
they?"</p>
<p>"Not here! Not here!" said Eugene passionately. "It's not
right, here! My God, this is the Square! There's the fountain!
There's the City Hall! There's the Greek's lunch-room."</p>
<p>The bank-chimes struck the half hour.</p>
<p>"And there's the bank," he cried.</p>
<p>"That makes no difference," said Ben.</p>
<p>"Yes," said Eugene, "it does!"</p>
<p>I am thy father's spirit, doomed for a certain term to walk
the night&mdash;</p>
<p>"But not here! Not here, Ben!" said Eugene.</p>
<p>"Where?" said Ben wearily.</p>
<p>"In Babylon! In Thebes! In all the other places. But not
here!" Eugene answered with growing passion. "There is a place
where all things happen! But not here, Ben!"</p>
<p>My gods, with bird-cries in the sun, hang in the sky.</p>
<p>"Not here, Ben! It is not right!" Eugene said again.</p>
<p>The manifold gods of Babylon. Then, for a moment, Eugene
stared at the dark figure on the rail, muttering in protest and
disbelief: "Ghost! Ghost!"</p>
<p>"Fool," said Ben again, "I tell you I am not a ghost."</p>
<p>"Then, what are you?" said Eugene with strong excitement. "You
are dead, Ben."</p>
<p>In a moment, more quietly, he added: "Or do men die?"</p>
<p>"How should I know," said Ben.</p>
<p>"They say papa is dying. Did you know that, Ben?" Eugene
asked.</p>
<p>"Yes," said Ben.</p>
<p>"They have bought his shop. They are going to tear it down and
put up a skyscraper here."</p>
<p>"Yes," said Ben, "I know it."</p>
<p>We shall not come again. We never shall come back again.</p>
<p>"Everything is going. Everything changes and passes away.
To-morrow I shall be gone and this&mdash;" he stopped.</p>
<p>"This&mdash;what?" said Ben.</p>
<p>"This will be gone or&mdash;O God! Did all this happen?" cried
Eugene.</p>
<p>"How should I know, fool?" cried Ben angrily.</p>
<p>"What happens, Ben? What really happens?" said Eugene. "Can
you remember some of the same things that I do? I have forgotten
the old faces. Where are they, Ben? What were their names? I
forget the names of people I knew for years. I get their faces
mixed. I get their heads stuck on other people's bodies. I think
one man has said what another said. And I forget&mdash;forget.
There is something I have lost and have forgotten. I can't
remember, Ben."</p>
<p>"What do you want to remember?" said Ben.</p>
<p>A stone, a leaf, an unfound door. And the forgotten faces.</p>
<p>"I have forgotten names. I have forgotten faces. And I
remember little things," said Eugene. "I remember the fly I
swallowed on the peach, and the little boys on tricycles at Saint
Louis, and the mole on Grover's neck, and the Lackawanna
freight-car, number 16356, on a siding near Gulfport. Once, in
Norfolk, an Australian soldier on his way to France asked me the
way to a ship; I remember that man's face."</p>
<p>He stared for an answer into the shadow of Ben's face, and
then he turned his moon-bright eyes upon the Square.</p>
<p>And for a moment all the silver space was printed with the
thousand forms of himself and Ben. There, by the corner in from
Academy Street, Eugene watched his own approach; there, by the
City Hall, he strode with lifted knees; there, by the curb upon
the step, he stood, peopling the night with the great lost legion
of himself&mdash;the thousand forms that came, that passed, that
wove and shifted in unending change, and that remained unchanging
Him.</p>
<p>And through the Square, unwoven from lost time, the fierce
bright horde of Ben spun in and out its deathless loom. Ben, in a
thousand moments, walked the Square: Ben of the lost years, the
forgotten days, the unremembered hours; prowled by the moonlit
fa&ccedil;ades; vanished, returned, left and rejoined himself,
was one and many&mdash;deathless Ben in search of the lost dead
lusts, the finished enterprise, the unfound door&mdash;unchanging
Ben multiplying himself in form, by all the brick fa&ccedil;ades
entering and coming out.</p>
<p>And as Eugene watched the army of himself and Ben, which were
not ghosts, and which were lost, he saw himself&mdash;his son,
his boy, his lost and virgin flesh&mdash;come over past the
fountain, leaning against the loaded canvas bag, and walking down
with rapid crippled stride past Gant's toward Niggertown in young
pre-natal dawn. And as he passed the porch where he sat watching,
he saw the lost child-face below the lumpy ragged cap, drugged in
the magic of unheard music, listening for the far-forested
horn-note, the speechless almost captured pass-word. The fast
boy-hands folded the fresh sheets, but the fabulous lost face
went by, steeped in its incantations.</p>
<p>Eugene leaped to the railing.</p>
<p>"You! You! My son! My child! Come back! Come back!"</p>
<p>His voice strangled in his throat: the boy had gone, leaving
the memory of his bewitched and listening face turned to the
hidden world. O lost!</p>
<p>And now the Square was thronging with their lost bright
shapes, and all the minutes of lost time collected and stood
still. Then, shot from them with projectile speed, the Square
shrank down the rails of destiny, and was vanished with all
things done, with all forgotten shapes of himself and Ben.</p>
<p>And in his vision he saw the fabulous lost cities, buried in
the drifted silt of the earth&mdash;Thebes, the seven-gated, and
all the temples of the Daulian and Phocian lands, and all
Oenotria to the Tyrrhene gulf. Sunk in the burial-urn of earth he
saw the vanished cultures: the strange sourceless glory of the
Incas, the fragments of lost epics upon a broken shard of Gnossic
pottery, the buried tombs of the Memphian kings, and imperial
dust, wound all about with gold and rotting linen, dead with
their thousand bestial gods, their mute unwakened ushabtii, in
their finished eternities.</p>
<p>He saw the billion living of the earth, the thousand billion
dead: seas were withered, deserts flooded, mountains drowned; and
gods and demons came out of the South, and ruled above the little
rocket-flare of centuries, and sank&mdash;came to their Northern
Lights of death, the muttering death-flared dusk of the completed
gods.</p>
<p>But, amid the fumbling march of races to extinction, the giant
rhythms of the earth remained. The seasons passed in their
majestic processionals, and germinal Spring returned forever on
the land&mdash;new crops, new men, new harvests, and new
gods.</p>
<p>And then the voyages, the search for the happy land. In his
moment of terrible vision he saw, in the tortuous ways of a
thousand alien places, his foiled quest of himself. And his
haunted face was possessed of that obscure and passionate hunger
that had woven its shuttle across the seas, that had hung its
weft among the Dutch in Pennsylvania, that had darkened his
father's eyes to impalpable desire for wrought stone and the head
of an angel. Hill-haunted, whose vision of the earth was
mountain-walled, he saw the golden cities sicken in his eye, the
opulent dark splendors turn to dingy gray. His brain was sick
with the million books, his eyes with the million pictures, his
body sickened on a hundred princely wines.</p>
<p>And rising from his vision, he cried: "I am not there among
the cities. I have sought down a million streets, until the
goat-cry died within my throat, and I have found no city where I
was, no door where I had entered, no place where I had
stood."</p>
<p>Then, from the edges of moon-bright silence, Ben replied:
"Fool, why do you look in the streets?"</p>
<p>Then Eugene said: "I have eaten and drunk the earth, I have
been lost and beaten, and I will go no more."</p>
<p>"Fool," said Ben, "what do you want to find?"</p>
<p>"Myself, and an end to hunger, and the happy land," he
answered. "For I believe in harbors at the end. O Ben, brother,
and ghost, and stranger, you who could never speak, give me an
answer now!"</p>
<p>Then, as he thought, Ben said: "There is no happy land. There
is no end to hunger."</p>
<p>"And a stone, a leaf, a door? Ben?" Spoke, continued without
speaking, to speak. "Who are, who never were, Ben, the seeming of
my brain, as I of yours, my ghost, my stranger, who died, who
never lived, as I? But if, lost seeming of my dreaming brain, you
have what I have not&mdash;an answer?"</p>
<p>Silence spoke. ("I cannot speak of voyages. I belong here. I
never got away," said Ben.)</p>
<p>"Then I of yours the seeming, Ben? Your flesh is dead and
buried in these hills: my unimprisoned soul haunts through the
million streets of life, living its spectral nightmare of hunger
and desire. Where, Ben? Where is the world?"</p>
<p>"Nowhere," Ben said. "YOU are your world."</p>
<p>Inevitable catharsis by the threads of chaos. Unswerving
punctuality of chance. Apexical summation, from the billion
deaths of possibility, of things done.</p>
<p>"I shall save one land unvisited," said Eugene. Et ego in
Arcadia.</p>
<p>And as he spoke, he saw that he had left the million bones of
cities, the skein of streets. He was alone with Ben, and their
feet were planted on darkness, their faces were lit with the cold
high terror of the stars.</p>
<p>On the brink of the dark he stood, with only the dream of the
cities, the million books, the spectral images of the people he
had loved, who had loved him, whom he had known and lost. They
will not come again. They never will come back again.</p>
<p>With his feet upon the cliff of darkness, he looked and saw
the lights of no cities. It was, he thought, the strong good
medicine of death.</p>
<p>"Is this the end?" he said. "Have I eaten life and have not
found him? Then I will voyage no more."</p>
<p>"Fool," said Ben, "THIS is life. You have been nowhere."</p>
<p>"But in the cities?"</p>
<p>"There are none. There is one voyage, the first, the last, the
only one."</p>
<p>"On coasts more strange than Cipango, in a place more far than
Fez, I shall hunt him, the ghost and haunter of myself. I have
lost the blood that fed me; I have died the hundred deaths that
lead to life. By the slow thunder of the drums, the flare of
dying cities, I have come to this dark place. And this is the
true voyage, the good one, the best. And now prepare, my soul,
for the beginning hunt. I will plumb seas stranger than those
haunted by the Albatross."</p>
<p>He stood naked and alone in darkness, far from the lost world
of the streets and faces; he stood upon the ramparts of his soul,
before the lost land of himself; heard inland murmurs of lost
seas, the far interior music of the horns. The last voyage, the
longest, the best.</p>
<p>"O sudden and impalpable faun, lost in the thickets of myself,
I will hunt you down until you cease to haunt my eyes with
hunger. I heard your foot-falls in the desert, I saw your shadow
in old buried cities, I heard your laughter running down a
million streets, but I did not find you there. And no leaf hangs
for me in the forest; I shall lift no stone upon the hills; I
shall find no door in any city. But in the city of myself, upon
the continent of my soul, I shall find the forgotten language,
the lost world, a door where I may enter, and music strange as
any ever sounded; I shall haunt you, ghost, along the
labyrinthine ways until&mdash;until? O Ben, my ghost, an
answer?"</p>
<p>But as he spoke, the phantom years scrolled up their vision,
and only the eyes of Ben burned terribly in darkness, without an
answer.</p>
<p>And day came, and the song of waking birds, and the Square,
bathed in the young pearl light of morning. And a wind stirred
lightly in the Square, and, as he looked, Ben, like a fume of
smoke, was melted into dawn.</p>
<p>And the angels on Gant's porch were frozen in hard marble
silence, and at a distance life awoke, and there was a rattle of
lean wheels, a slow clangor of shod hoofs. And he heard the
whistle wail along the river.</p>
<p>Yet, as he stood for the last time by the angels of his
father's porch, it seemed as if the Square already were far and
lost; or, I should say, he was like a man who stands upon a hill
above the town he has left, yet does not say "The town is near,"
but turns his eyes upon the distant soaring ranges.</p>
