<hr>
<h2 align="center">Chapter I</h2>

<p class="l">SHE had the black, luminous eyes of the Blid family,
with delicate, straight eyebrows; she had their boldly shaped nose,
their strong chin, and full lips. The curious line of mingled pain
and sensuousness about the corners of her mouth was likewise an
inheritance from them, and so were the restless movements of her
head. But her cheek was pale, her hair was soft as silk and was wound
smoothly around her head.</p>

<p>Not so the Blids; their coloring was of roses and bronze. Their
hair was rough and curly, heavy as a mane, and their full, deep,
resonant voices bore out the tales told of their forefathers, whose
noisy hunting parties, solemn morning prayers, and thousand and one
amorous adventures were matters of family tradition.</p>

<p>Her voice was languid and colorless. I am describing her as she
was at seventeen. A few years later, after she had been married, her
voice gained fullness, her cheek took on a fresher tint, and her eye
lost some of its luster, but seemed even larger and more intensely
black.</p>

<p>At seventeen she did not at all resemble her brothers and sisters;
nor was there any great intimacy between herself and her parents. The
Blid family were practical folk who accepted things as they were;
they did their</p>

<p class="c" align="center">17</p>

<hr>
<p class="l">work, slept their sleep, and never thought of demanding
any diversions beyond the harvest home and three or four Christmas
parties. They never passed through any religious experiences, but
they would no more have dreamed of not rendering unto God what was
God's than they would have neglected to pay their taxes. Therefore
they said their evening prayers, went to church at Easter and
Whitsun, sang their hymns on Christmas Eve, and partook of the Lord's
Supper twice a year. They had no particular thirst for knowledge. As
for their love of beauty, they were by no means insensible to the
charm of little sentimental ditties, and when summer came with thick,
luscious grass in the meadows and grain sprouting in broad fields,
they would sometimes say to one another that this was a fine time for
traveling about the country, but their natures had nothing of the
poetic; beauty never stirred any raptures in them, and they were
never visited by vague longings or day-dreams.</p>

<p>Bartholine was not of their kind. She had no interest in the
affairs of the fields and the stables, no taste for the dairy and the
kitchen--none whatever.</p>

<p>She loved poetry.</p>

<p>She lived on poems, dreamed poems, and put her faith in them above
everything else in the world. Parents, sisters and brothers,
neighbors and friends--none of them ever said a word that was worth
listening to. Their thoughts never rose above their land and their
business; their eyes never sought anything beyond the conditions and
affairs that were right before them.</p>

<p>But the poems! They teemed with new ideas and profound truths
about life in the great outside world, where grief was black, and joy
was red; they glowed with images, foamed and sparkled with rhythm
and</p>

<p class="c" align="center">18</p>

<hr>
<p class="l">rhyme. They were all about young girls, and the girls
were noble and beautiful--how noble and beautiful they never knew
themselves. Their hearts and their love meant more than the wealth of
all the earth; men bore them up in their hands, lifted them high in
the sunshine of joy, honored and worshiped them, and were delighted
to share with them their thoughts and plans, their triumphs and
renown. They would even say that these same fortunate girls had
inspired all the plans and achieved all the triumphs.</p>

<p>Why might not she herself be such a girl? They were thus and
so--and they never knew it themselves. How was she to know what she
really was? And the poets all said very plainly that this was life,
and that it was not life to sit and sew, work about the house, and
make stupid calls.</p>

<p>When all this was sifted down, it meant little beyond a slightly
morbid desire to realize herself, a longing to find herself, which
she had in common with many other young girls with talents a little
above the ordinary. It was only a pity that there was not in her
circle a single individual of sufficient distinction to give her the
measure of her own powers. There was not even a kindred nature. So
she came to look upon herself as something wonderful, unique, a sort
of exotic plant that had grown in these ungentle climes and had
barely strength enough to unfold its leaves; though in more genial
warmth, under a more powerful sun, it might have shot up, straight
and tall, with a gloriously rich and brilliant bloom. Such was the
image of her real self that she carried in her mind. She dreamed a
thousand dreams of those sunlit regions and was consumed with longing
for this other and richer self, forgetting--what is so easily
forgotten--that even the</p>

<p class="c" align="center">19</p>

<hr>
<p class="l">fairest dreams and the deepest longings do not add an
inch to the stature of the human soul.</p>

<p><br>
</p>

<p>One fine day a suitor came to her.</p>

<p>Young Lyhne of L&ouml;nborggaard was the man, and he was the last
male scion of a family whose members had for three generations been
among the most distinguished people in the country. As burgomasters,
revenue collectors, or royal commissioners, often rewarded with the
title of councillor of justice, the Lyhnes in their maturer years had
served king and country with diligence and honor. In their younger
days they had traveled in France and Germany, and these trips,
carefully planned and carried out with great thoroughness, had
enriched their receptive minds with all the scenes of beauty and the
knowledge of life that foreign lands had to offer. Nor were these
years of travel pushed into the background, after their return, as
mere reminiscences, like the memory of a feast after the last candle
has burned down and the last note of music has died away. No, life in
their homes was built on these years; the tastes awakened in this
manner were not allowed to languish, but were nourished and developed
by every means at their command. Rare copper plates, costly bronzes,
German poetry, French juridical works, and French philosophy were
everyday matters and common topics in the Lyhne households.</p>

<p>Their bearing had an old-fashioned ease, a courtly graciousness,
which contrasted oddly with the heavy majesty and awkward pomposity
of the other county families. Their speech was well rounded,
delicately precise, a little marred, perhaps, by rhetorical
affectation, yet it somehow went well with those large, broad figures
with their domelike foreheads, their bushy hair growing far back on
their temples, their calm, smiling eyes, and</p>

<p class="c" align="center">20</p>

<hr>
<p class="l">slightly aquiline noses. The lower part of the face was
too heavy, however, the mouth too wide, and the lips much too
full.</p>

<p>Young Lyhne showed all these physical traits, but more faintly,
and, in the same manner, the family intelligence seemed to have grown
weary in him. None of the mental problems of finer artistic
enjoyments that he encountered stirred him to any zeal or desire
whatsoever. He had simply striven with them in a painstaking effort
which was never brightened by joy in feeling his own powers unfold or
pride in finding them adequate. Mere satisfaction in a task
accomplished was the only reward that came to him.</p>

<p>His estate, L&ouml;nborggaard, had been left him by an uncle who
had recently died, and he had returned from the traditional trip
abroad in order to take over the management. As the Blid family were
the nearest neighbors of his own rank, and his uncle had been
intimate with them, he called, met Bartholine, and fell in love with
her.</p>

<p>That she should fall in love with him was almost a foregone
conclusion.</p>

<p>Here at last was some one from the outside world, some one who had
lived in great, distant cities, where forests of spires were etched
on a sunlit sky, where the air was vibrant with chimes of bells, the
pealing of organs, and the twanging of mandolins, while festal
processions, resplendent with gold and colors, wound their way
through broad streets; where marble mansions shone, where noble
families flaunted bright escutcheons hung two by two over wide
portals, while fans flashed, and veils fluttered over the sculptured
vines of curving balconies. Here was one who had sojourned where
victorious armies had tramped the roads, where tremendous battles</p>

<p class="c" align="center">21</p>

<hr>
<p class="l">had invested the names of villages and fields with
immortal fame, where smoke rising from gypsy fires trailed over the
leafy masses of the forest, where red ruins looked down from
vine-wreathed hills into the smiling valley, while water surged over
the mill-wheel, and cowbells tinkled as the herds came home over
wide-arched bridges.</p>

<p>All these things he told about, not as the poems did, but in a
matter-of-fact way, as familiarly as the people at home talked about
the villages in their own county or the next parish. He talked of
painters and poets, too, and sometimes he would laud to the skies a
name that she had never even heard. He showed her their pictures and
read their poems to her in the garden or on the hill where they could
look out over the bright waters of the fjord and the brown, billowing
heath. Love made him poetic; the view took on beauty, the clouds
seemed like those drifting through the poems, and the trees were
clothed in the leaves rustling so mournfully in the ballads.</p>

<p>Bartholine was happy; for her love enabled her to dissolve the
twenty-four hours into a string of romantic episodes. It was romance
when she went down the road to meet him; their meeting was romance,
and so was their parting. It was romance when she stood on the
hilltop in the light of the setting sun and waved one last farewell
before going up to her quiet little chamber, wistfully happy, to give
herself up to thoughts of him; and when she included his name in her
evening prayer, that was romance, too.</p>

<p>She no longer felt the old vague desires and longings. The new
life with its shifting moods gave her all she craved, and moreover
her thoughts and ideas had been clarified through having someone to
whom she could speak freely without fear of being misunderstood.</p>

<p class="c" align="center">22</p>

<hr>
<p>She was changed in another way, too. Happiness had made her more
amiable toward her parents and sisters and brothers. She discovered
that, after all, they had more intelligence than she had supposed and
more feeling.</p>

<p>And so they were married.</p>

<p>The first year passed very much as their courtship; but when their
wedded life had lost its newness, Lyhne could no longer conceal from
himself that he wearied of always seeking new expressions for his
love. He was tired of donning the plumage of romance and eternally
spreading his wings to fly through all the heavens of sentiment and
all the abysses of thought. He longed to settle peacefully on his own
quiet perch and drowse, with his tired head under the soft, feathery
shelter of a wing. He had never conceived of love as an ever-wakeful,
restless flame, casting its strong, flickering light into every nook
and corner of existence, making everything seem fantastically large
and strange. Love to him was more like the quiet glow of embers on
their bed of ashes, spreading a gentle warmth, while the faint dusk
wraps all distant things in forgetfulness and makes the near seem
nearer and more intimate.</p>

<p>He was tired, worn out. He could not stand all this romance. He
longed for the firm support of the commonplace under his feet, as a
fish, suffocating in hot air, languishes for the clear, fresh
coolness of the waves. It must end sometime, when it had run its
course. Bartholine was no longer inexperienced either in books or in
life. She knew them as well as he. He had given her all he had--and
now he was expected to go on giving. It was impossible; he had
nothing more. There was only one comfort: Bartholine was with
child.</p>

<p>Bartholine had long realized with sorrow that her con-</p>

<p class="c" align="center">23</p>

<hr>
<p class="l">ception of Lyhne was changing little by little, and that
he no longer stood on the dizzy pinnacle to which she had raised him
in the days of their courtship. While she did not yet doubt that he
was at bottom what she called a poetic nature, she had begun to feel
a little uneasy; for the cloven hoof of prose had shown itself once
and again. This only made her pursue romance the more ardently, and
she tried to bring back the old state of things by lavishing on him a
still greater wealth of sentiment and a still greater rapture, but
she met so little response that she almost felt as if she were
stilted and unnatural. For a while she tried to drag Lyhne with her,
in spite of his resistance; she refused to accept what she suspected;
but when, at last, the failure of her efforts made her begin to doubt
whether her own mind and heart really possessed the treasures she had
imagined, then she suddenly left him alone, became cool, silent, and
reserved, and often went off by herself to grieve over her lost
illusions. For she saw it all now, and was bitterly disappointed to
find that Lyhne, in his inmost self, was no whit different from
people she used to live among. She had merely been deceived by the
very ordinary fact that his love, for a brief moment, had invested
him with a fleeting glamor of soulfulness and exaltation--a very
common occurrence with persons of a lower nature.</p>

<p>Lyhne was grieved and anxious, too, over the change in their
relationship, and tried to mend matters by unlucky attempts at the
old romantic flights, but it all availed nothing except to show
Bartholine yet more clearly how great had been her mistake.</p>

<p>Such was the state of things between man and wife when Bartholine
brought forth her first child. It was a boy, and they called him
Niels.</p>

<p class="c" align="center">24</p>

<hr>
<h2 class="c" align="center">Chapter II</h2>

<p class="l">IN a way, the child brought the parents together again.
Over his little cradle they would meet in a common hope, a common
joy, and a common fear; of him they would think, and of him they
would talk, each as often and as readily as the other, and each was
grateful to the other for the child and for all the happiness and
love he brought.</p>

<p>Yet they were still far apart.</p>

<p>Lyhne was quite absorbed in his farming and the affairs of the
parish. Not that he took the position of a leader or even of a
reformer, but he gave scrupulous attention to the existing order of
things, looked on as an interested spectator, and carried out the
cautious improvements recommended, after deliberate--very
deliberate--consideration, by his old head servant or the elders of
the parish.</p>

<p>It never occurred to him to make any use of the knowledge he had
acquired in earlier days. He had too little faith in what he called
theories and far too great respect for the time-hallowed, venerable
dogmas of experience which other people called practical. In fact,
there was nothing about him to indicate that he had not lived here
and lived thus all his life--except one little trait. He had a habit
of sitting for half hours at a time, quite motionless, on a stile or
a boundary stone, looking out over the lusc-</p>

<p class="c" align="center">25</p>

<hr>
<p class="l">ious green rye or the golden top-heavy oats, in a
strange, vegetative trance. This was a relic of other days; it
recalled his former self, the young Lyhne.</p>

<p>Bartholine, in her world, was by no means so ready to adapt
herself quickly and with a good grace. No, she first had to voice her
sorrow through the verses of a hundred poets, lamenting, in all the
broad generalities of the period, the thousands of barriers and
fetters that oppress humanity. Sometimes her lament would be clothed
in lofty indignation, flinging its wordy froth against the thrones of
emperors and the dungeons of tyrants; sometimes it would take the
form of a calm, pitying sorrow, looking on as the effulgent light of
beauty faded from a blind and slavish generation cowed and broken by
the soulless bustle of the day; then again it would appear only as a
gentle sigh for the freedom of the bird in its flight and of the
cloud drifting lightly into the distance.</p>

<p>At last she grew tired of lamenting, and the impotence of her
grief goaded her into doubt and bitterness. Like worshipers who beat
their saint and tread him under foot when he refuses to show his
power, she would scoff at the romance she once idolized, and
scornfully ask herself whether she did not expect the bird Roc to
appear presently in the cucumber bed, or Aladdin's cave to open under
the floor of the milk cellar. She would answer herself in a sort of
childish cynicism, pretending that the world was excessively prosaic,
calling the moon green cheese and the roses potpourri, all with a
sense of taking revenge and at the same time with a half uneasy, half
fascinated feeling that she was committing blasphemy.</p>

<p>These attempts at setting herself free were futile. She sank back
into the dreams of her girlhood, but with the</p>

<p class="c" align="center">26</p>

<hr>
<p class="l">difference that now they were no longer illumined by
hope. Moreover, she had learned that they were only dreams--distant,
illusive dreams, which no longing in the world could ever draw down
to her earth. When she abandoned herself to them now, it was with a
sense of weariness, while an accusing inner voice told her that she
was like the drunkard who knows that his passion is destroying him,
that every debauch means strength taken from his weakness and added
to the power of his desire. But the voice sounded in vain, for a life
soberly lived, without the fair vice of dreams, was no life at
all--life had exactly the value that dreams gave it and no more.</p>

<p>So widely different, then, were Niels Lyhne's father and mother,
the two friendly powers that struggled unconsciously for mastery over
his young soul from the moment the first gleam of intelligence in him
gave them something to work on. As the child grew older, the struggle
became more intense and was waged with a greater variety of
weapons.</p>

<p>The faculty in the boy through which the mother tried to influence
him was his imagination. He had plenty of imagination, but even when
he was a very small boy, it was evident that he felt a great
difference between the fairy world his mother's words conjured up and
the world that really existed. Often his mother would tell him
stories and describe the woeful plight of the hero, until Niels could
not see any way out of all this trouble, and could not understand how
the misery closing like an impenetrable wall tighter and tighter
around him and the hero could be overcome. Then it happened quite a
number of times that he would suddenly press his cheek against his
mother's and whisper, with eyes full of tears</p>

<p class="c" align="center">27</p>

<hr>
<p class="l">and lips trembling, "But it isn't <i>really</i> true?"
And when he had received the comforting answer he wanted, he would
heave a deep sigh of relief and settle down contentedly to listen to
the end.</p>

<p>His mother did not quite like this defection.</p>

<p>When he grew too old for fairy tales, and she tired of inventing
them, she would tell him, with some embroideries of her own, about
the heroes of war and peace, choosing those that lent themselves to
pointing a moral about the power dwelling in a human soul when it
wills one thing only and neither allows itself to be discouraged by
the short-sighted doubts of the moment nor to be enticed into a soft,
enervating peace.</p>

<p>All her stories went to this tune, and when history had no more
heroes that suited her, she chose an imaginary hero, one whose deeds
and fate she could shape as she pleased--a hero after her own heart,
spirit of her spirit, aye, flesh of her flesh and the blood of hers,
too.</p>

<p>A few years after Niels was born, she had brought forth a
still-born boy child, and him she chose. All that he might have been
and done she served up before his brother in a confused medley of
Promethean longings, Messianic courage, and Herculean might, with a
naive travesty, a monstrous distortion, a world of cheap fantasies,
having no more body of reality than had the tiny little skeleton
mouldering in the earth of Lonborg graveyard.</p>

<p>Niels was not deceived about the moral of all these tales. He
realized perfectly that it was contemptible to be like ordinary
people, and he was quite ready to submit to the hard fate that
belonged to heroes. In imagination he willingly suffered the
wearisome struggles, the ill fortunes, the martyrdom of being
misjudged, and the vic-</p>

<p class="c" align="center">28</p>

<hr>
<p class="l">tories without peace; but at the same time he felt a
wondrous relief in thinking that it was so far away, that nothing of
all this would happen before he was grown up.</p>

<p>As the dream-figures and dream-tones of night may walk abroad in
the wakeful day like vapory forms, mere shadows of sound, calling on
thought and holding it for a fleeting second, as it listens and
wonders whether anyone really called--so the images of that
dream-born future whispered softly through Niels Lyhne's childhood,
reminding him gently but ceaselessly of the fact that there was a
limit set to this happy time, and that presently one day it would be
no more.</p>

<p>This consciousness roused in him a craving to enjoy his childhood
to the full, to suck it up through every sense, not to spill a drop,
not a single one. Therefore his play had intensity, sometimes lashed
into a passion, under the pressure of an uneasy sense that time was
flowing away from him before he could gather from its treasure-laden
waters all they brought, as one wave broke upon another. He would
sometimes throw himself down on the ground and sob with despair when
a holiday hung heavy on his hands for the lack of one thing or
another--playmates, inventiveness, or fair weather--and he hated to
go to bed, because sleep was empty of events and devoid of
sensation.</p>

<p>Yet it was not always so.</p>

<p>It would sometimes happen that he grew weary, and his imagination
ran out of colors. Then he would be quite wretched and feel that he
was too small and insignificant for these ambitious dreams. He seemed
to himself a mean liar, who had brazenly pretended to love and
understand what was great, though if the truth were told, he cared
only for the petty, loved only the commonplace, and</p>

<p class="c" align="center">29</p>

<hr>
<p class="l">carried all, all low-born wishes and desires fully alive
within himself. Sometimes he would even feel that he had the class
hatred of the rabble against everything exalted, and that he would
joyfully have helped to stone these heroes who were of a better blood
than he and knew that they were.</p>

<p>On such days, he would shun his mother, and, with a sense of
following an ignoble instinct, would seek his father, turning a
willing ear and receptive mind to the latter's earth-bound thoughts
and matter-of-fact explanations. He felt at home with his father and
rejoiced in the likeness between them, well-nigh forgetting that it
was the same father whom he was wont to look down upon with pity from
the pinnacles of his dream castle. Of course this was not present in
his childish mind with the clearness and definiteness given it by the
spoken word, but it was all there, though unformed, unborn, in a
vague and intangible embryo form. It was like the curious vegetation
at the bottom of the sea when seen through layers of ice. Break the
ice, or draw that which lives in the dimness out into the full light
of speech--what happens is the same: that which is now seen and now
grasped is not, in its clearness, the shadowy thing that was.</p>

<p class="c" align="center">30</p>

<hr>
<h2 class="c" align="center">Chapter III</h2>

<p class="l">THE years passed. One Christmas trod upon the heels of
another, leaving the air bright with its festive glow till long after
Epiphany. Whitsun after Whitsun scampered over flower-decked meadows.
One summer holiday after another drew near, celebrated its orgy of
fresh air and sunshine, poured out its fiery wine from brimming
goblets, and then vanished, one day, in a sinking sun; only memory
lingered with sunburnt cheek and wondering eyes and blood that
danced.</p>

<p>The years had passed, and the world was no longer the realm of
wonder that it had been. The dim recesses behind the mouldering elder
bushes, the mysterious attic rooms, the gloomy stone passage under
the Klastrup road--fancied terrors that once thrilled him no longer
lurked there. The hillside that bloomed at the first trill of the
lark, hiding the grass under starry, purple-rimmed daisies and yellow
buttercups, the fantastic wealth of animals and plants in the river,
the wild precipices of the sand-pit, its black rocks and bits of
silvery granite--all these were just flowers, animals, and stones;
the shining fairy gold had turned into withered leaves again.</p>

<p>One game after another grew old and silly, stupid and</p>

<p class="c" align="center">31</p>

<hr>
<p class="l">tiresome like the pictures in the ABC, and yet they had
once been new, inexhaustibly new. Here they used to roll a
barrel-hoop--Niels and the pastor's Frithjof--and the hoop was a
ship, which was wrecked when it toppled over, but if you caught it
before it fell, then it was casting anchor. The narrow passage
between the outhouses, where you could hardly squeeze through, was
Bab-el-Mandeb or the Portal of Death. On the stable door "England"
was written in chalk, and on the barn door "France." The garden gate
was Rio de Janeiro, but the smithy was Brazil. Another game was to
play Holger the Dane: you <i>could</i> play it among the tall burs
behind the barn; but if you went up in the miller's pasture, there
were two sink-holes known as the gorges, and there were the haunts of
the veritable Prince Burmand and his wild Saracens, with reddish gray
turbans and yellow plumes in their helmets--burdocks and Aaron's rod
of the tallest. That was the only <i>real</i> Mauretania. That rank,
succulent growth, that teeming mass of exuberant plant life, excited
their lust of destruction and intoxicated them with the voluptuous
joy of demolishing. The wooden swords gleamed with the brightness of
steel; the green sap stained the blade with red gore, and the cut
stalks squashing under their feet were Turks' bodies trampled under
horses' hoofs with a sound as of bones crunched in flesh.</p>

<p>Sometimes they played down by the fjord; mussel shells were
launched as ships, and when the vessel got stuck in a clump of
seaweed, or went aground on a sand bank, it was Columbus in the
Sargasso Sea or the discovery of America. Harbors and mighty
embankments were built; the Nile was dug out in the firm beach sand,
and once they made Gurre Castle out of pebbles--a tiny dead</p>

<p class="c" align="center">32</p>

<hr>
<p class="l">fish in an oyster shell was the corpse of Tove, and they
were King Valdemar who sat sorrowing by her side.</p>

<p>But this was all past.</p>

<p>Niels was quite a lad now, twelve years old, nearing thirteen, and
he no longer needed to hack thistles and burdocks in order to feed
his knightly fancies, any more than he had to launch his explorer's
dreams in a mussel shell. A book and a corner of a sofa were enough
for him now, and if the book refused to bear him to the coast of his
desires, he would hunt up Frithjof and tell him the tales which the
book would not yield. Arm in arm, they would saunter down the road,
one telling, both listening; but when they wanted to revel to the
full and really give their imagination free play, they would hide in
the fragrant dimness of the hayloft. After a while, these stories,
which always ended just when you had really entered into them, grew
into a single long story that never ended, but lived and died with
one generation after the other; for when the hero had grown old, or
you had been careless enough to let him die, you could always give
him a son, who would inherit everything from the father, and whom, in
addition, you could dower with any other virtues that you happened to
value particularly just at the moment.</p>

<p>Whatever stamped itself on Niels's mind, what he saw, what he
understood and what he misunderstood, what he admired and what he
knew he ought to admire--all was woven into the story. As running
water is colored by every passing picture, sometimes holding the
image with perfect clearness, sometimes distorting it or throwing it
back in wavering, uncertain lines, then again drowning it completely
in the color and play of its own ripples, so the lad's story
reflected feeling and thoughts,</p>

<p class="c" align="center">33</p>

<hr>
<p class="l">his own and those of other people, mirrored human beings
and events, life and books, as well as it could. It was a play life,
running side by side with real life. It was a snug retreat, where you
could abandon yourself to dreams of the wildest adventures. It was a
fairy garden that opened at your slightest nod, and received you in
all its glory, shutting out everybody else. Whispering palms closed
overhead; flowers of sunshine and leaves like stars on vines of coral
spread at your feet, and among them a thousand paths led to all the
ages and the climes. If you followed one, it would lead you to one
place, and if you followed another, it would lead you to another
place, to Aladdin and Robinson Crusoe, to Vaul-under and Henrik
Magnard, to Niels Klim and Mungo Park, to Peter Simple and
Odysseus--and the moment you wished it, you were home again.</p>

<p>About a month after Niels's twelfth birthday, two new faces
appeared at L&ouml;nborggaard.</p>

<p>One was that of the new tutor; the other was that of Edele
Lyhne.</p>

<p>The tutor, Mr. Bigum, was a candidate for orders and was at the
threshold of the forties. He was rather small, but with a stocky
strength like that of a work-horse, broad-chested, high-shouldered,
and slightly stooping. He walked with a heavy, slow, deliberate
tread, and moved his arms in a vague, expressionless way that seemed
to require a great deal of room. His high, wide forehead was flat as
a wall, with two perpendicular lines between the eyebrows; the nose
was short and blunt, the mouth large with thick, fresh lips. His eyes
were his best feature, light in color, mild, and clear. The movements
of his eyeballs showed that he was slightly deaf. Nevertheless, he
loved music and played his violin with passion-</p>

<p class="c" align="center">34</p>

<hr>
<p class="l">ate devotion; for the notes, he said, were not heard
only with the ears, but with the whole body, eyes, fingers, and feet;
if the ear failed sometimes, the hand would find the right note
without its aid, by a strange, intuitive genius of its own. Besides,
the audible tones were, after all, false, but he who possessed the
divine gift of music carried within him an invisible instrument
compared to which the most wonderful Cremona was like the stringed
calabash of the savage. On this instrument the soul played; its
strings gave forth ideal notes, and upon it the great tone poets had
composed their immortal works.</p>

<p>The external music, which was borne on the air of reality and
heard with the ears, was nothing but a wretched simulation, a
stammering attempt to say the unutterable. It resembled the music of
the soul as the statue modeled by hands, carved with a chisel, and
meted with a measure resembled the wondrous marble dream of the
sculptor which no eye ever beheld and no lip ever praised.</p>

<p>Music, however, was by no means Mr. Bigum's chief interest. He was
first of all a philosopher, but not one of the productive
philosophers who find new laws and build new systems. He laughed at
their systems, the snail-shells in which they dragged themselves
across the illimitable field of thought, fondly imagining that the
field was within the snail-shell! And these laws--laws of thought,
laws of nature! Why, the discovery of a law meant nothing but the
fixing of your own limitations: I can see so far and no farther--as
if there were not another horizon beyond the first, and another and
yet another, horizon beyond horizon, law beyond law, in an unending
vista! No, he was not that kind of philosopher. He did not think he
was vain, or that he overvalued himself, but he could not</p>

<p class="c" align="center">35</p>

<hr>
<p class="l">close his eyes to the fact that his intellect had a
wider span than that of other mortals. When he meditated upon the
works of the great thinkers, it seemed to him that he strode forward
through a region peopled by slumbering thought-giants, who awoke,
bathed in the light of his spirit, to consciousness of their own
strength. And so it was always; every thought, mood, or sentiment of
another person which was vouchsafed the privilege of awakening within
him rose up with his sign on its forehead, ennobled, purified, with
wings strengthened, endowed with a power and a might that its creator
had never dreamed of.</p>

<p>How often had he gazed with an almost humble amazement on the
marvelous wealth of his soul and the divine assurance of his spirit!
For it would often happen that different days would find him judging
the world and the things of the world from entirely divergent points
of view, looking at them through hypotheses that were as far apart as
night and morning; yet these points of view and hypotheses, which he
chose to make his own, never even for one second made him theirs, any
more than the god who had taken on the semblance of a bull or a swan
becomes a bull or a swan and ceases to be a god.</p>

<p>And no one suspected what dwelt within him--all passed him by
unseeing. But he rejoiced in their blindness and felt his contempt
for humanity growing. A day would come when the light of his eye
would go out, and the magnificent structure of his mind would crumble
to its foundations and become as that which had never been, but no
work from his hand, no, not a line, would he leave to tell the tale
of what had been lost in him. His genius should not be crowned with
thorns by the world's mis-judgment, neither should it wear the
defiling purple cloak of the world's admiration. He exulted at the
thought that</p>

<p class="c" align="center">36</p>

<hr>
<p class="l">generation after generation would be born and die, and
the greatest men of all ages would spend years of their life in the
attempt to gain what he could have given them if he had chosen to
open his hand.</p>

<p>The fact that he lived in such a humble fashion gave him a curious
pleasure, simply because there was such a magnificent extravagance in
using his mind to teach children, such a wild incongruity in paying
for his time with mere daily bread, and such a colossal absurdity in
allowing him to earn this bread upon the recommendation of poor,
ordinary mortals, who had vouched for him that he knew enough to take
upon himself the miserable task of a tutor. And they had given him
<i>non</i> in his examination for a degree!</p>

<p>Oh, there was rapture in feeling the brutal stupidity of an
existence that cast him aside as poor chaff and valued as golden
grain the empty husks, while he knew in his own mind that his
lightest thoughts was worth a world!</p>

<p>Yet there were other times when the solitude of his greatness
weighed upon him and depressed him.</p>

<p>Ah, how often, when he had communed with himself in sacred
silence, hour after hour, and then returned again to consciousness of
the audible, visible life round about him, had he not felt himself a
stranger to its paltriness and corruptibility. Then he had often been
like the monk who listened in the monastery woods to a single trill
of the paradise bird and, when he came back, found that a century had
died. Ah, if the monk was lonely with the generation that lived among
the groves he knew, how much more lonely was the man whose
contemporaries had not yet been born.</p>

<p>In such desolate moments he would sometimes be</p>

<p class="c" align="center">37</p>

<hr>
<p class="l">seized with a cowardly longing to sink down to the level
of the common herd, to share their lowborn happiness, to become a
native of their great earth and a citizen of their little heaven. But
soon he would be himself again.</p>

<p>The other newcomer was Edele Lyhne, Lyhne's twenty-six-year-old
sister. She had lived many years in Copenhagen, first with her
mother, who had moved to the city when she became a widow, and, after
her mother's death, in the home of a wealthy uncle, Councillor of
State Neergaard. The Neergaards entertained on a large scale and went
out a great deal, so Edele lived in a whirl of balls and
festivities.</p>

<p>She was admired wherever she went, and envy, the faithful shadow
of admiration, also followed her. She was talked about as much as one
can be without having done anything scandalous, and whenever men
discussed the three reigning beauties of the town there were always
many voices in favor of striking out one name and substituting that
of Edele Lyhne, but they could never agree on which of two others
should yield to her--as for the third, it was out of the
question.</p>

<p>Yet very young men did not admire her. They were abashed in her
presence, and felt twice as stupid as usual when she listened to them
with her look of mild toleration--a maliciously emphasized toleration
which crushed them with a sense that she had heard it all before and
knew it by heart. They made efforts to shine in her eyes and their
own by assuming blase airs, by inventing wild paradoxes, or, when
their desperation reached a climax, by making bold declarations; but
all these attempts, jostling and crowding one upon the other in the
abrupt transitions of youth, were met with the faint shadow of a
smile, a deadly smile of boredom, which made the victim red-</p>

<p class="c" align="center">38</p>

<hr>
<p class="l">den and feel that he was the one hundred and eleventh
fly in the same merciless spider's web.</p>

<p>Moreover, her beauty had neither the softness nor the fire to
ensnare young hearts. On older hearts and cooler heads she exercised
a peculiar fascination.</p>

<p>She was tall. Her thick, heavy hair was blonde with the faint
reddish sheen of ripening wheat, but fairer and curling where it grew
in two points low on the nape of her neck. Under the high, clean-cut
forehead, her eyebrows were pale and indefinite. The light gray eyes
were large and clear, neither accented by the brows nor borrowing
fitful shadows from the thin, delicate lids. There was something
indeterminate and indeterminable in their expression. They always met
you with a full and open gaze, without any of the changeful play of
sidelong glances or lightning flashes, but almost unnaturally
wakeful, invincible, inscrutable. The vivacity was all in the lower
part of the face, the nostrils, the mouth, and the chin. The eyes
merely looked on. The mouth was particularly expressive. The lips met
in a lovely bow with deep, gracious curves and flexible lines, but
their beauty was a little marred by a hardness of the lower lip,
which sometimes melted away in a smile, and then again stiffened into
something akin to brutality.</p>

<p>The bold sweep of the back and the luxuriant fullness of the
bosom, contrasted with the classic severity of the shoulders and
arms, gave her an audacity, an exotic fascination, which was enhanced
by the gleaming whiteness of her skin and the morbid redness of her
lips. The effect was provocative and disquieting.</p>

<p>Her tall, slender figure had a subtle distinction, which she was
clever enough to underscore, especially in her ball dresses, with
sure and conscious art. In fact, her</p>

<p class="c" align="center">39</p>

<hr>
<p class="l">artistic sense applied to her own person would sometimes
speak so loudly from her costume that it barely escaped a hint of bad
taste even when most exquisitely tasteful. To many this seemed an
added charm.</p>

<p>Nothing could be more punctiliously correct than her behavior. In
what she said, and in what she permitted to be said, she kept within
the strictest bounds of prudery. Her coquetry consisted in not being
coquettish, in being incurably blind to her own power, and never
making the slightest distinction between her admirers. For that very
reason, they all dreamed intoxicating dreams of the face that must be
hidden behind the mask; they believed in a fire under the snow and
sensed depravity in her inno-cense. None of them would have been
surprised to hear that she had a secret lover, but neither would they
have ventured to guess his name.</p>

<p>This was the way people saw Edele Lyhne.</p>

<p>She had left the city for L&ouml;nborggaard, because her health
had suffered from the constant round of pleasures, the thousand and
one nights of balls and masquerades. Toward the end of the winter,
the doctor had declared her lungs to be affected, and had prescribed
fresh air, quiet, and milk. All these things she found in abundance
in her present abode, but she also found an unceasing boredom, which
made her long for Copenhagen before a week had passed. She filled
letter after letter with entreaties that she might be allowed to
return from her exile, and hinted that homesickness did her more harm
than the air did her good. But the doctor had so alarmed her uncle
and aunt that they felt it their duty to turn a deaf ear to her
lamentations, no matter how pathetic.</p>

<p>It was not so much the social diversions she pined for; it was
rather that she craved the sense of feeling her own</p>

<p class="c" align="center">40</p>

<hr>
<p class="l">life mingling with the sound-filled air of the great
city, whereas in the country the stillness in thoughts, in words, in
eyes--in everything--made her feel as though she heard herself
unceasingly and with inescapable distinctness, just as one hears a
watch ticking through a sleepless night. And to know that over there
they were living exactly as before--it was as if she were lying dead
<i>in</i> the quiet night and heard the strains of music from a
ballroom stealing on the air over her grave.</p>

<p>There was no one she could talk to. No one of them all ever caught
just the shade of meaning that was the essence of what she said. Of
course, they understood her after a fashion, inasmuch as she spoke
Danish, but it was a dull, general sort of a way, just as they might
have understood a foreign language which they heard only once in a
while. They never had the slightest idea of whom or what was meant by
a particular intonation of a word, never dreamed that such a little
phrase was a quotation, or that another, used in just such a way, was
a new variation of a popular witticism. As for their own speech, it
had a decent leanness through which one could positively feel the
grammatical ribs, and the words were used with a literalness as if
they had just come fresh from the columns of the dictionary. Even the
way they said Copenhagen! Sometimes with a mysterious emphasis, as if
it were a place where people ate little children; then again with a
faraway expression, as if they were speaking of a town in central
Africa, or in a festive voice tremulous with history, as they might
have said Nineveh or Carthage. The pastor always said Axelstead with
a reminiscent rapture, as if it had been the name of one of his old
sweethearts. Not one of them could say Copenhagen so that it meant
the city stretching from Vesterport to the</p>

<p class="c" align="center">41</p>

<hr>
<p class="l">Custom House on both sides of &Ouml;stergade and Kongens
Nytorv. And so it was with all they said and all they did.</p>

<p>There was not a thing at L&ouml;nborggaard that did not displease
her; these mealtimes regulated by the sun, this smell of lavender in
chests and presses, these Spartan chairs, all these provincial pieces
of furniture that stood shrinking against the walls as if they were
afraid of people! Even the very air was distasteful to her; she could
never take a walk without bringing home a robust perfume of
meadow-hay and wild flowers, as if she had been locked up in a
haymarket.</p>

<p>And then to be called aunt, Aunt Edele. How it grated on her ears!
She got used to it after a while, but in the beginning it made the
relation between her and Niels rather cool.</p>

<p>Niels didn't care.</p>

<p>Then came a Sunday in the early part of August, when Lyhne and his
wife had gone out in the carriage to pay a visit, and Niels and Miss
Edele were home alone. In the morning Edele had asked Niels to pick
some cornflowers for her, but he had forgotten it. Suddenly, in the
afternoon, as he was walking with Frithjof, he remembered, gathered a
bouquet, and ran up to the house with it.</p>

<p>Everything was so still that he imagined his aunt must be asleep,
and crept silently through the house. At the threshold of the sitting
room he stopped, with bated breath, preparing to approach Edele's
door. The sitting room was flooded with sunshine, and a blossoming
oleander made the air heavy with its sweet fragrance. There was no
sound except a muffled splash from the flower stand whenever the
goldfish moved in their glass bowls.</p>

<p>Niels crossed the room, balancing himself with outstretched arms,
his tongue between his teeth. Cautiously</p>

<p class="c" align="center">42</p>

<hr>
<p class="l">he grasped the doorknob, which was so hot with the sun
that it burned his hand, and turned it slowly and carefully, knitting
his brows and half closing his eyes. He pulled the door toward him,
bent in through the narrow opening, and laid the flowers on a chair
just within. The room was dark as if the shades were down, and the
air seemed moist with fragrance, the fragrance of attar of roses. As
he stooped, he saw only the light straw matting on the floor, the
wainscoting under the window, and the lacquered foot of a Gueridon;
but when he straightened himself to back out of the door he caught
sight of his aunt.</p>

<p>She was stretched full-length on a couch of sea-green satin,
dressed in a fanciful gypsy costume. As she lay on her back, chin up,
throat tense, and forehead low, her loosened hair flowed down over
the end of the couch and along the rug. An artificial pomegranate
flower looked as if it had been washed ashore on an island made by a
little bronze-colored shoe in the midst of the dull golden
stream.</p>

<p>The motley colors of her dress were rich and mellow. Dull blue,
pale rose, gray, and orange were blended in the pattern of a little
low-cut bodice of a thick, lusterless stuff. Underneath, she wore a
white silk chemise with wide sleeves falling to the elbow. The white
had a faint pinkish tone, and was shot with threads of reddish gold.
Her skirt of pansy-colored velvet without any border was gathered
loosely around her, and slid down over the side of the couch in
slanting folds. Her feet and legs were bare, and around her crossed
ankles she had wound a necklace of pale corals. An open fan was lying
on the floor, showing its pattern of playing cards arranged in a
wheel, and a little farther away a pair of leaf-brown silk</p>

<p class="c" align="center">43</p>

<hr>
<p class="l">stockings had been thrown, one partly rolled up, the
other spread out and revealing the red clock.</p>

<p>At the same moment that Niels caught sight of her, she saw him.
Involuntarily she made a slight movement as if to rise, but checked
herself and lay still as before, only turning her head a little to
look at the boy with a questioning smile.</p>

<p>"I brought these," he said, and went over to her with the
flowers.</p>

<p>She held out her hand, glanced at them and then at her costume,
comparing the colors, and dropped them with a wearily murmured
"Impossible!"</p>

<p>Niels would have picked them up, but she stopped him with a motion
of her hand.</p>

<p>"Give me that!" she said, pointing to a red flask that lay on a
crumpled handkerchief at her feet.</p>

<p>Niels went to take it. His face was crimson, as he bent over the
milk-white, gently rounded legs and the long, slender feet, which had
almost the intelligence of a hand in their fine flexible curves. He
felt dizzy, and when one foot suddenly turned and bent downward with
a quick movement, he almost fell.</p>

<p>"Where did you pick the flowers?" Edele asked.</p>

<p>Niels pulled himself together and turned toward her: "I picked
them in the pastor's rye field," he said, in a voice that sounded
strange to himself. He handed her the flask without looking up.</p>

<p>Edele noticed his emotion and looked at him astonished. Suddenly
she blushed, raised herself on one arm, and drew her feet under her
petticoat. "Go, go, go, go!" she said, half peevishly, half shyly,
and at every word she sprayed him with the attar of roses.</p>

<p>Niels went. When he was out of the room, she let her</p>

<p class="c" align="center">44</p>

<hr>
<p class="l">feet glide slowly down from the couch and looked at them
curiously.</p>

<p>Running with unsteady steps, he hurried through the house to his
own room. He felt quite stunned; there was a strange weakness in his
knees and a choking sensation in his throat. He threw himself down on
the couch and closed his eyes, but it was of no avail, a strange
restlessness possessed him; his breath came heavily as in fear, and
the light tortured him in spite of his closed eyelids.</p>

<p>Little by little a change came over him. A hot, heavy breath
seemed to blow on him and make him helplessly weak. He felt as one in
a dream who hears some one calling and tries to go, but cannot move a
foot, and is tortured by his weakness, sickens with his longing to
get away, is lashed to madness by this calling which does not know
one is bound. And he sighed impatiently as if he were ill and looked
around quite lost. Never had he felt so miserable, so lonely, so
forsaken, and so forlorn.</p>

<p>He sat down in the flood of sunlight from the window, and
wept.</p>

<p>From that day Niels felt a timid happiness in Edele's presence.
She was no more a human being like any one else, but an exalted
creature, divine by virtue of her strange, mystic beauty. His heart
throbbed with rapture in merely looking at her, kneeling to her in
his heart, crawling to her feet in abject self-effacement. Yet there
were moments when his adoration had to have vent in outward signs of
subjection. At such times he would lie in wait for a chance to steal
into Edele's room and go through a fixed rite of a certain
interminable number of kisses lavished on the little rug in front of
her bed, her shoe, or any other object that presented itself to his
idolatry.</p>

<p class="c" align="center">45</p>

<hr>
<p>He regarded it as a piece of great good fortune that his Sunday
jacket happened to be degraded, just then, to everyday use; for the
lingering scent of attar of roses was like a mighty talisman with
which he could conjure up in a magic mirror the image of Edele as he
had seen her lying on the green couch wearing her masquerade costume.
In the story he and Frithjof were telling each other, this image was
ever present, and from now on the wretched Frithjof was never safe
from barefooted princesses. If he dragged himself through the dense
primeval forest, they would call to him from hammocks of vines. If he
sought shelter from the storm in a mountain cave, they would rise
from their couches of velvety moss to welcome him, and when he
dashed, bloody and smoke-blackened, into the pirate's cabin,
shivering the door with a tremendous blow of his saber, he found them
there too, resting on the captain's green sofa. They bored him
terribly, and he could not see why they should suddenly have become
so necessary to their beloved heroes.</p>

<p class="c" align="center">* * * *</p>

<p>No matter in how exalted a place a human being may set his throne,
no matter how firmly he may press the tiara of the exceptional, that
is genius, upon his brow, he can never be sure that he may not, like
Nebuchadnezzar, be seized with a sudden desire to go on all-fours and
eat grass and herd with the common beasts of the field.</p>

<p>That was what happened to Mr. Bigum when he quite simply fell in
love with Miss Edele, and it availed him nothing that he distorted
history to find an excuse for his love by calling Edele Beatrice or
Laura or Vittoria Colonna, for all the artificial halos with which he
tried to crown his love were blown out as fast as he could light</p>

<p class="c" align="center">46</p>

<hr>
<p class="l">them by the stubborn fact that it was Edele's beauty he
was in love with; nor was it the graces of her mind and heart that
had captivated him, but her elegance, her air of fashion, her easy
assurance, even her graceful insolence. It was a kind of love that
might well fill him with shamed surprise at the inconsistency of the
children of men.</p>

<p>And what did it all matter! Those eternal truths and makeshift
lies that were woven ring in ring to form the heavy armor he called
his principles, what were they against his love? If they really were
the strength and marrow and kernel of life, then let them show their
strength; if they were weaker, let them break; if stronger--. But
they were already broken, plucked to pieces like the mesh of rotten
threads they were. What did she care about eternal truths? And the
mighty visions, how did they help him? Thoughts that plumbed the
unfathomable, could they win her? All that he possessed was
worthless. Even though his soul shone with the radiance of a hundred
suns, what did it avail, when his light was hidden under the ugly
fustian of a Diogenes' mantle? Oh, for beauty! Take my soul and give
me my thirty pieces of silver--Alcibiades' body, Don Juan's mantle,
and a court chamberlain's rank!</p>

<p>But, alas, he had none of these graces, and Edele was by no means
attracted to his heavy, philosophic nature. His habit of seeing life
in barbarously naked abstractions gave him a noisy dogmaticism, an
unpleasant positiveness that jarred her like a misplaced drum in a
concert of soft music. The strained quality of his mind, which always
seemed to knit its muscles and strike an attitude before every little
question like a strong man about to play with iron balls, seemed to
her ridiculous. He irritated her by</p>

<p class="c" align="center">47</p>

<hr>
<p class="l">his censorious morality, which pounced on every lightly
sketched feeling, indiscreetly tearing away its incognito, rudely
calling it by name, just as it was about to flit past him in the
course of conversation.</p>

<p>Bigum knew very well what an unfavorable impression he made and
how hopeless his love was, but he knew it as we know a thing when we
hope with all the strength of our soul that our knowledge is false.
There is always the miracle left; and though miracles do not happen,
they might happen. Who knows? Perhaps our intelligence, our instinct,
our senses, in spite of their daylight clearness, are leading us
astray. Perhaps the one thing needful is just that unreasoning
courage which follows hope's will-o'-the-wisp as it burns over
seething passions pregnant with desire! It is only when we have heard
the door of destiny slam shut that we begin to feel the iron-cold
talons of certainty digging into our breast, gathering slowly, slowly
around our heart, and fastening their clutches upon the fine thread
of hope on which our world of happiness hangs: then the thread is
severed; then all that it held falls and is shattered; then the
shriek of despair sounds through the emptiness.</p>

<p>In doubt, no one despairs.</p>

<p><br>
</p>

<p>On a sunny afternoon in September, Edele was sitting on the
landing of the half-dozen broad, old-fashioned steps that led down
from the summer parlor into the garden. Behind her, the French
windows were wide open, flung back against the motley wall-covering
of bright red and green vines. She leaned her head against a chair
piled high with large black portfolios, and held an etching up before
her with both hands. Color prints of Byzantine mosaics in blue and
gold were scattered on the pale</p>

<p class="c" align="center">48</p>

<hr>
<p class="l">green rush matting that covered the boards of the
landing, on the threshold, and on the oak-brown parquet floor of the
summer parlor. At the foot of the steps lay a white shade hat; for
Edele's hair was uncovered, with no ornament but a flower of gold
filigree in a pattern to match the gold bracelet she wore high on her
arm. Her white dress was of semi-transparent stuff with narrow silky
stripes; it had an edging of twisted orange and black chenille and
tiny rosettes in the same two colors. Light silk mitts covered her
hands and reached to the elbow. They were pearl gray like her
shoes.</p>

<p>The yellow sunlight was filtered through the drooping branches of
an ancient ash. It pierced the cool dimness, forming distinct lines
of light, powdering the air with gold dust, and painting the steps,
the wall, and the doors with spots of light, spot of sun upon spot of
sun, like a perforated shade. Through the tracery of shadow, each
color rose to meet the light: white from Edele's dress, blood-red
from crimson lips, amber from yellow-blonde hair, and a hundred other
tints round about, blue and gold, oak-brown, glitter of glass, red
and green.</p>

<p>Edele dropped the etching and looked up despondently, her eyes
expressing the silent plaint she was too weary to give vent to in a
sigh. Then she settled down as if to shut out her surroundings and
withdraw within herself.</p>

<p>Just then Mr. Bigum appeared.</p>

<p>Edele looked at him with a drowsy blinking like that of a child
who is too sleepy and comfortable to stir, but too curious to shut
its eyes.</p>

<p>Mr. Bigum wore his new beaver hat. He was absorbed in his own
thoughts, and gesticulated with his tombac watch in his hand, until
the thin silver chain threatened</p>

<p class="c" align="center">49</p>

<hr>
<p class="l">to snap. With a sudden, almost vicious movement, he
thrust the watch deep down into his pocket, threw back his head
impatiently, caught the lapel of his coat in a peevish grasp, and
would have gone on with an angry jerk of his whole body, his face
darkened by all the hopeless rage that boils in a man when he is
running away from his own torturing thoughts, and knows that he runs
in vain.</p>

<p>Edele's hat, lying at the foot of the steps and shining white
against the black earth of the walk, stopped him in his flight. He
picked it up with both hands, then caught sight of Edele, and as he
stood trying to think of something to say, he held it instead of
giving it to her. Not an idea could he find in his brain; not a word
would be born on his tongue, and he looked straight ahead with a
stupid expression of arrested profundity.</p>

<p>"It is a hat, Mr. Bigum," said Edele carelessly, to break the
embarrassed silence.</p>

<p>"Yes," said the tutor eagerly, delighted to hear her confirm a
likeness that had struck him also; but the next moment he blushed at
his clumsy answer.</p>

<p>"It was lying here," he added hurriedly, "here on the ground like
this--just like this," and he bent down to show where it had lain
with an inconsequential minuteness born of his confusion. He felt
almost happy in his relief at having given some sign of life, however
futile. He was still standing with the hat in his hand.</p>

<p>"Do you intend to keep it?" asked Edele.</p>

<p>Bigum had no answer to that.</p>

<p>"I mean will you give it to me?" she explained.</p>

<p>Bigum came a few steps nearer and handed her the hat. "Miss
Lyhne," she said, "you think--you must not think--I beg you to let me
speak; that is--I am not saying</p>

<p class="c" align="center">50</p>

<hr>
<p class="l">anything, but be patient with me!--I love you, Miss
Lyhne, unutterably, unutterably, beyond all words I love you. Oh, if
language held a word that combined the cringing admiration of the
slave, the ecstatic smile of the martyr, and the gnawing homesickness
of the exile, with that word I could tell you my love. Oh, listen to
me, do not thrust me away yet! Do not think that I am insulting you
with an insane hope! I know how insignificant I seem in your eyes,
how clumsy and repulsive, yes, repulsive. I am not forgetting that I
am poor,--you must know it,--so poor that I have to let my mother
live in a charitable institution, and I can't help it, can't help it.
I am so miserably poor. Yes, Miss Lyhne, I am only a poor servant in
your brother's house, and yet there is a world where I am ruler,
powerful, proud, rich, with the crown of victory, noble by virtue of
the passion that drove Prometheus to steal the fire from the heaven
of the gods. There I am brother to all the great in spirit, whom the
earth has borne, and who bear the earth. I understand them as none
but equals understand one another; no flight that they have flown is
too high for the strength of my wings. Do you understand me? Do you
believe me? Oh, don't believe me! It isn't true, I am nothing but the
Kobold figure you see before you. It is all past; for this terrible
madness of love has paralyzed my wings, the eyes of my spirit have
lost their sight, my heart is dried up, my soul is drained to
bloodless poltroonery. Oh, save me from myself, Miss Lyhne, don't
turn away in scorn! Weep over me, weep, it is Rome burning!"</p>

<p>He had fallen to his knees on the steps, wringing his hands. His
face was blanched and distorted, his teeth were clinched in agony,
his eyes drowned in tears; his</p>

<p class="c" align="center">51</p>

<hr>
<p class="l">whole body shook under the suppressed sobs that were
heard only as a gasping for breath.</p>

<p>"Control yourself, Mr. Bigum," she said in a slightly too
compassionate tone. "Control yourself, don't give way so, be a man!
Please get up and go down into the garden a little while and try to
pull yourself together."</p>

<p>"And you can't love me at all!" groaned Mr, Bigum almost
inaudibly. "Oh, it's terrible! There is not a thing in my soul that I
wouldn't murder and degrade if I could win you thereby. No, no, even
if any one offered me madness and I could possess you in my
hallucinations, <i>possess</i> you, then I would say: Take my brain,
tear down its wonderful structure with rude hands, break all the fine
threads that bind my spirit to the resplendent triumphal chariot of
the human mind, and let me sink in the mire of the physical, under
the wheels of the chariot, and let others follow the shining paths
that lead to the light! Do you understand me? Can you comprehend that
even if your love came to me robbed of its glory, debased, befouled,
as a caricature of love, as a diseased phantom, I would receive it
kneeling as if it were the Sacred Host? But the best in me is
useless, the worst in me is useless, too. I cry to the sun, but it
does not shine; to the statue, but it does not answer--answer! . . .
What is there to answer except that I suffer? No, these unutterable
torments that rend my whole being down to its deepest roots, this
anguish is nothing to you but an impertinence. You feel nothing but a
little cold offence; in your heart you laugh scornfully at the poor
tutor and his impossible passion."</p>

<p>"You do me an injustice, Mr. Bigum," said Edele, rising, while Mr.
Bigum rose too. "I am not laughing. You ask me if there is no hope,
and I answer: No, there is</p>

<p class="c" align="center">52</p>

<hr>
<p class="l">no hope. That is surely nothing to laugh at. But there
is one thing I want to say to you. From the first moment you began to
think of me, you must have known what my answer would be, and you did
know it, did you not? You knew it all the time, and yet you have been
lashing all your thoughts and desires on toward the goal which you
knew you could not reach. I am not offended by your love, Mr. Bigum,
but I condemn it. You have done what so many people do: they close
their eyes to the realities and stop their ears when life cries 'No'
to their wishes. They want to forget the deep chasm fate has placed
between them and the object of their ardent longing. They want their
dream to be fulfilled. But life takes no account of dreams. There
isn't a single obstacle that can be dreamed out of the world, and in
the end we lie there crying at the edge of the chasm, which hasn't
changed and is just where it always was. But we have changed, for we
have let our dreams goad all our thoughts and spur all our longings
to the very highest tension. The chasm is no narrower, and everything
in us cries out with longing to reach the other side, but no, always
no, never anything else. If we had only kept a watch on ourselves in
time! But now it is too late, now we are unhappy."</p>

<p>She paused almost as if she woke from a trance. Her voice had been
quiet, groping, as if she were speaking to herself, but now it
hardened into a cold aloofness.</p>

<p>"I cannot help you, Mr. Bigum. You are nothing to me of what you
wish to be. If that makes you unhappy, you must be unhappy; if you
suffer, you must suffer-there are always some who have to suffer. If
you make a human being your god and the ruler of your fate, you must
bow to the will of divinity, but it is never wise to</p>

<p class="c" align="center">53</p>

<hr>
<p class="l">make yourself gods, or to give your soul over to
another; for there are gods who will not step down from their
pedestals. Be sensible, Mr. Bigum! Your god is so small and so little
worth your worship; turn from it and be happy with one of the
daughters of the land."</p>

<p>With a faint little smile, she went in through the summer parlor,
while Mr. Bigum looked after her, crestfallen. For another fifteen
minutes he walked up and down before the steps. All the words that
had been spoken seemed to be still vibrating through the air; she had
so lately gone, it seemed that her shadow must still linger there; it
seemed that she could not yet be out of reach of his prayers, and
everything could not be inexorably ended. But after a while the
chambermaid came out and gathered up the engravings, carried in the
chair, the portfolios, the rush matting--everything.</p>

<p>Then he could go too.</p>

<p>In the open gable window up above, Niels sat gazing after him. He
had heard the whole conversation from beginning to end. His face had
a frightened look and a nervous trembling passed through his body.
For the first time he was afraid of life. For the first time his mind
grasped the fact that when life has sentenced you to suffer, the
sentence is neither a fancy nor a threat, but you <i>are</i> dragged
to the rack, and you <i>are</i> tortured, and there is no marvelous
rescue at the last moment, no awakening as from a bad dream.</p>

<p>He felt it as a foreboding which struck him with terror.</p>

<p class="c" align="center">* * * *</p>

<p>Edele did not have a good autumn, and the winter drained her
strength completely. Spring, when it came, did not find one poor
little life-germ that it could warm</p>

<p class="c" align="center">54</p>

<hr>
<p class="l">and coax into growth; it found only a withering, which
no gentleness and no warmth could arrest or even retard. But it could
at least pour a flood of light over the paling life and caress the
ebbing strength with fragrant, balmy air, as the evening crimson
follows slowly in the wake of dying day.</p>

<p>The end came in May, on a day flooded with sunshine, one of the
days when the lark is never silent, and you can almost see the rye
grow. The great cherry trees outside her window were white with
flowers--nosegays of snow, wreaths of snow, cupolas, arches,
garlands, a fairy architecture against the bluest of skies.</p>

<p>She was very weak that day, and withal she felt a strange sense of
lightness. She knew what was coming, for that morning she had sent
for Bigum and said good-by to him.</p>

<p>Her uncle had come over from Copenhagen, and all that afternoon
the handsome, white-haired man sat by her bedside with his hand
folded in her hands. He did not speak, but once in a while he would
move his hand, and she would press it; she would look up, and he
would smile to her. Her brother, too, was in the room, gave her
medicine, and helped her in other ways.</p>

<p>She lay very still with closed eyes, while familiar pictures from
life over there flitted past her. Sorgenfri with hanging birches, the
red church at Lyngby standing on a foundation of graves, and the
white country house with the bit of sunken road leading down to the
sea, where the paling always was green as if painted by the
water--the images took shape before her, grew clear, melted away, and
vanished. And other pictures came. There was Bredgade when the sun
went down, and the darkness closed in around the houses. There was
the</p>

<p class="c" align="center">55</p>

<hr>
<p class="l">queer Copenhagen you found when you came in from the
country in the forenoon. It seemed so weird with its hurry and bustle
in the sunlight, with the whitened window panes and the streets
smelling of fruit. There was something unreal about the houses in the
strong light; the noise and rattle of wheels could not chase away the
silence that seemed to enfold them. . . . Then came the dim, quiet
drawing room in the autumn evenings, when she was dressed for the
theater, and the others were not down yet--the smell of incense, the
wood fire from the stove lighting up the carpet--the rain whipping
the windows--the horses stamping at the door--the melancholy cry of
the mussel venders . . . and back of all this the theater awaiting
her with light and music and festive glow.</p>

<p>With such pictures the afternoon wore away.</p>

<p>Niels and his mother were in the parlor. Niels knelt by the sofa
with his face pressed down against its brown velvet and his hands
clasped over his head. He wept and wailed aloud, giving himself up to
his grief without any attempt at self-control. Mrs. Lyhne sat beside
him. The hymn book lay on the table in front of her, open at the
hymns usually sung at funerals. Now and then she read a few verses,
and sometimes she would bend down over her son to speak a word of
soothing or chiding, but Niels would not be comforted, and she could
not stop his weeping or the wild prayers born of his despair.</p>

<p>Presently Lyhne appeared in the door of the sick-room. He made no
signs, but looked at them so solemnly that both rose and followed him
in to his sister. He took them by the hand and led them to the bed.
Edele looked up and gazed at each one in turn, while her lips
motioned for words. Then Lyhne took his wife over to the window</p>

<p class="c" align="center">56</p>

<hr>
<p class="l">and sat down there with her. Niels threw himself on his
knees at the foot of the bed.</p>

<p>He wept softly and prayed with clasped hands, eagerly and
incessantly, in a low, passionate whisper. He told God that he would
not stop hoping. "I won't let You go, Lord, I won't let You go before
You have said 'Yes'! You mustn't take her away from us; for You know
how we love her--You mustn't, You mustn't, Oh! I can't say. 'Thy will
be done;' for Your will is to let her die, but, oh, let her live! I
will thank You and obey You. I will do everything I know You want me
to do. I'll be so good and never offend You, if You will only let her
live! Do You hear, God? Oh, stop, stop, and make her well before it's
too late! I will, I will, oh, what can I promise You?-- Oh, I'll
thank You, never, never, forget You; oh, but hear me! Don't You see
she's dying, don't You see she's dying? Do You hear? Take Your hand
away! I can't lose her, God, I can't! Let her live, won't You please,
won't You please? Oh, it's wicked of You--"</p>

<p>Outside, beyond the window, the white flowers flushed to pink in
the light of the setting sun. Arch upon arch, the blossoming sprays
built of their gossamer bloom a rose castle, a vaulted choir of
roses, and through this airy dome the azure sky shone with a softened
twilight blue, while golden lights and lights of gold flaming to
crimson shot like the rays of a nimbus from every garlanded line of
the ethereal temple.</p>

<p>White and still, Edele lay there with the old man's hand between
both of hers. Slowly she breathed out her life, breath by breath;
fainter and fainter was the rising of her breast; heavier and heavier
fell the eyelids.</p>

<p>"My love to Copenhagen!" was her last low whisper.</p>

<p>But her last message was heard by no one. It did not</p>

<p class="c" align="center">57</p>

<hr>
<p class="l">come from her lips even as a breath--her message to him,
the great artist whom she had loved secretly with her whole soul, but
to whom she had been nothing, only a name that his ear knew, only one
unrecognized figure in the great admiring public.</p>

<p>The light faded into blue dusk, and her hands fell weakly apart.
The shadows grew--shadows of night and of death.</p>

<p>The old man bent down over her head and laid his hands on her
pulse, waiting quietly, and when the last throb of life had ebbed
away, when the last feeble pulse beat was stilled, he lifted the pale
hand to his lips.</p>

<p>"Little Edele!"</p>

<p class="c" align="center">58</p>

<hr>
<h2 class="c" align="center">Chapter IV</h2>

<p class="l">THERE are those who can take up their grief and bear it,
strong natures who feel their own powers through the very heaviness
of their burden. Weaker people give themselves up to their sorrow
passively, as they would submit to a sickness; and like a sickness
their sorrow pervades them, drinks itself into their innermost being
and becomes a part of them, is assimilated in them through a slow
struggle, and finally loses itself in them, as they return to perfect
health.</p>

<p>But there are yet others to whom sorrow is a violence done them, a
cruelty which they never learn to accept as a trial or chastisement
or as simple fate. It is to them an act of tyranny, an expression of
personal hate, and it always leaves a sting in their hearts.</p>

<p>Children do not often grieve in this way, but Niels Lyhne did. For
had he not been face to face with God in the fervor of his prayers?
Had he not crawled on his knees to the foot of the throne, full of
hope, tremulous with fear, and yet firm in his faith in the
omnipotence of prayer, with courage to plead until he should be
heard? And he had been forced to rise from the dust and go away with
his hope put to shame. His faith had not been able to bring the
miracle down from heaven, no God</p>

<p class="c" align="center">59</p>

<hr>
<p class="l">had answered his cry, death had marched straight on and
seized its prey, as if no sheltering wall of prayers had been lifted
toward the sky.</p>

<p>A stillness fell upon him. His faith had flung itself blindly
against the gates of heaven, and now it lay on Edele's grave with
broken wings. For he had believed with the crude, implicit fairy-tale
faith that children so often feel. The complex, subtly shaded figure
of the Catechism is not the God children believe in; their God is the
mighty one in the Old Testament, He who loved Adam and Eve so much,
and to whom the whole generation of men, kings, prophets, Pharaohs,
are nothing but good and bad children, this tremendous, fatherly God,
who is wrathful with the anger of a giant and bountiful with the
generosity of a giant, Who has hardly created life before He lets
death loose upon it, Who drowns His earth in the waters from His
heaven, who thunders down laws too heavy for the race He made, and
who, finally, in the days of the Emperor Augustus, has pity upon men
and sends His Son to death in order that the law may be broken while
it is fulfilled. This God, Who always answers with a miracle, is the
one to whom children speak when they pray. By and by, a day comes
when they understand that they have heard His voice for the last time
in the earthquake that shook Golgotha and opened the graves, and that
now, since the veil of His Holy of Holies has been rent in twain, it
is the God Jesus who reigns; and from that day on they pray
differently.</p>

<p>But Niels had not yet attained to this. It is true, he had
followed Jesus on His earthly pilgrimage with a believing heart, but
when he saw Him subjecting Himself to the Father, going about so
bereft of power and</p>

<p class="c" align="center">60</p>

<hr>
<p class="l">suffering so humanly, all this had hidden the godhead
from him. He had seen in Him only the one Who did the will of the
Father, the Son of God, not God Himself: therefore, it was to God the
Father he had prayed, and it was God the Father who had failed him in
his bitter need. But if God had turned from him, he could turn from
God. If God had no ears, he had no lips; if God had no compassion, he
had no worship, and he defied and cast God out of his heart.</p>

<p>On the day Edele was buried, he spumed the earth of the grave with
his foot, whenever the pastor spoke the name of the Lord, and when he
met it afterwards in books or on the lips of people, a rebellious
frown would wrinkle his youthful forehead. When he lay down to sleep
at night, a sense of forsaken greatness came over him, as he thought
that now all the others, children and grown people, were praying to
the Lord and closing their eyes in His name, while he alone held his
hands from clasping in prayer, he alone refused to do God homage. He
was shut out from the sheltering care of Heaven. No angel watched by
his side; alone and unprotected, he drifted on the strangely
murmuring waters of darkness, and loneliness enfolded him, spreading
out from his bed in ever widening and receding circles. Still he did
not pray; though he longed till tears came, he did not call.</p>

<p>And it was so all his life. He had freed himself defiantly from
the point of view imposed upon him by his teachers, and he fled with
his sympathy to the side of those who had wasted their strength in
vainly kicking against the pricks. In the books he had been given to
read and in what he had been taught, God and His chosen people and
ideas marched on in an endless tri-</p>

<p class="c" align="center">61</p>

<hr>
<p class="l">umphal procession, and he had joined in the jubilant
shouting, had exulted in the sense of being counted with the proud
legions of the conqueror; for is not victory always righteous, and is
not the victor a liberator, a reformer, a light bringer?</p>

<p>But now the shouting had died down. Now he was silent, and he
began to enter into the thoughts of the defeated and feel with the
hearts of the vanquished. He understood that even when that which
prevails is good, that which yields is not therefore bad. He went
over to the losing side and told himself that this was finer and
greater. The power of the victor he called mere brute force and
violence. He took sides--as whole-heartedly as he could--against God,
but as a vassal who takes up arms against his liege lord; for he
still believed, and could not drive out his faith by defiance.</p>

<p>His tutor, Mr. Bigum, was not one who could lead a soul back to
the old paths. Indeed, his temperamental philosophy, by virtue of
which he could be fired and enraptured by each and every side of the
question-today one; tomorrow, another--set all dogmas adrift in the
minds of his pupils. At bottom he was really a man of Christian
principles, and if any one could have pinned him down saying what was
the fixed point in all this fluid matter, he would most likely have
replied that it was the creed of the Evangelical Lutheran Church or
something akin to that, but he himself had very little inclination to
drive his pupils along the straight road of orthodoxy or to warn them
at every step that the least deviation from the beaten track meant
straying into lies and darkness, likely to end in perdition and hell;
for he had none of the passionate concern of the orthodox for jots
and tittles. He was, in fact, religious in</p>

<p class="c" align="center">62</p>

<hr>
<p class="l">the slightly artistic, superior manner such talented
people affect, not afraid of a little harmonizing, easily enticed
into half unconscious rearrangements and adaptations, because,
whatever they do, they must assert their own personality, and, in
whatever spheres they fly, must hear the whirring of their own
wings.</p>

<p>Such people do not guide, but their instruction has a fullness, a
copiousness, and a wobbly many-sidedness which, provided they do not
utterly confuse a pupil, tend to develop his independence in a high
degree, since they almost force him to make up his mind for himself.
For children can never rest upon anything vague or indefinite; their
very instinct of self-preservation demands a plain Yes or a plain No,
a for or against, to show them where to turn with their hate and
where with their love.</p>

<p>Hence there was no firm and immutable authority that might have
guided Niels with its constant clinching of arguments and pointing of
ways. He had taken the bit in his teeth, and plunged headlong on any
path that opened before him, provided only that it led him away from
what had been the home of his feelings and of his thoughts.</p>

<p>He felt a new sense of power in thus seeing with his own eyes and
choosing with his own heart and forming himself by his own will. Many
new things came to his mind; traits of his own nature that he had
never thought of and that seemed unrelated one to the other, fitted
themselves together wonderfully and were fused into a rational whole.
It was a fascinating time of discovery. Little by little, in fear and
uncertain exultation, in incredulous joy, he found himself. He began
to realize that he was not like others, and a new spiritual modesty
made him shy, awkward, and taciturn. He grew suspi-</p>

<p class="c" align="center">63</p>

<hr>
<p class="l">cious of questions, and imagined he found hints of his
own most hidden thoughts in everything that was said. Having learned
to read in his own heart, he supposed everybody else could read what
was written there, and he shunned his elders, preferring to roam
about alone. It seemed to him that people had suddenly become very
intrusive; he developed a slightly hostile feeling toward them as to
creatures of another race, and in his loneliness he began to hold
them up for scrutiny and judgment. Formerly the names of father,
mother, the pastor, the miller, sufficed to characterize, and the
name had quite hidden the person from him. But now he saw that the
pastor was a jolly little man, who made himself as meek and demure as
he could at home to escape the notice of his wife, while abroad he
tried to forget the domestic yoke by talking himself into a frenzy of
rebellion and loud-voiced thirst for liberty. That was the pastor as
he saw him now.</p>

<p>And Mr. Bigum?</p>

<p>He had seen him ready to throw everything overboard for Edele's
love, had heard him deny himself and the soul within him in that hour
of passion in the garden, and now he was always talking about the
philosopher rising in Olympic calm above the vague whirlwinds and
mist-born rainbows of life. It roused a painful contempt in the lad
and made his doubts sleep but lightly, ready to wake in a moment. For
how could he know that the very things in human nature which Mr.
Bigum called by belittling names were otherwise christened when they
appeared in himself, and that his Olympic calm toward that which
moves common mortals was but a Titan's disdainful smile, quick with
memories of a Titan's longing and a Titan's passions.</p>

<p class="c" align="center">64</p>

<hr>
<h2 class="c" align="center">Chapter V</h2>

<p class="l">SIX months had passed since Edele's death, when one of
Lyhne's cousins, Mrs. Refstrup, became a widow. Her husband had been
a potter, but the business had never been flourishing, and during his
long illness it had quite run to seed, so there was scarcely anything
between the widow and actual want. Seven children were more than she
could provide for. The two youngest and also the oldest, who could
help her in the factory, remained with her, but the others were
distributed among the family. The Lyhnes took the second boy, Erik,
who was fourteen, and had been studying at the Latin school in the
nearest town, where he had free tuition. Now he was to share Mr.
Bigum's instruction with Niels and Frithjof Petersen, the pastor's
boy.</p>

<p>It was very much against his will that he was kept at his books,
for he wanted to be a sculptor. His father had called this nonsense,
but Lyhne had nothing against it; he said the boy had talent. Still
he thought he ought to take his bachelor's degree first, in order to
have something to fall back upon; and besides a classical education
was necessary to a sculptor, or was, at least, very desirable. That
settled the matter for the time being. Erik had to console himself
with the fairly large collection of good engravings and neat bronzes
that L&ouml;nborggaard</p>

<p class="c" align="center">65</p>

<hr>
<p class="l">had to offer. This meant a great deal to one who had
seen nothing but the rubbish bequeathed the local library by a
bone-carver more freakish than artistic in taste, and Erik was soon
busy with pencil and modeling stick. No one attracted him as did
Guido Reni, who in those days was more famous than Raphael and the
greatest; nor is there anything that can open young eyes to the
beauty of a work of art better than the certainty that their
admiration is authorized up to the highest pinnacle. Andrea del
Sarto, Parmigianino, and Luini, who were to mean so much to him later
when he and his talent had found each other, left him quite
indifferent, while the boldness of Tintoretto and the bitterness of
Salvator Rosa and Caravaggio filled him with delight. For sweetness
in art has no appeal for the very young; the daintiest of miniature
painters begins his career in the footsteps of Buonarotti, and the
pleasantest of lyrists sets out on his first voyage under the black
sail of bloody tragedy.</p>

<p>Still Erik's art was to him only a game, only a little better than
other games, and he was no more proud of a well-modeled head or a
cleverly carved horse than of hitting the weather vane on the church
steeple with a stone, or of swimming out to Sonderhagen and back
again without resting. These were the games in which he excelled,
games requiring physical prowess, strength, endurance, a sure hand,
and a practiced eye. He cared nothing for the kind of sport Niels and
Frithjof liked, where fancy plays the leading role, and all the
events and triumphs are imagined. The result was that the other two
soon left their old pastime to follow Erik's lead. Their romance
books were laid aside, and the interminable story came to a rather
violent end one day at</p>

<p class="c" align="center">66</p>

<hr>
<p class="l">a secret session in the hayloft. Silence brooded over
its newly filled grave. In fact, they shrank from mentioning it to
Erik, for he had not been with them many days before they suspected
that he would make fun of them and their story, that he would shame
them and lower them in their own eyes. He had the power to do this
because he himself was so free from all daydreams and fancies and
enthusiasms. His clear, boyish common sense was as merciless in its
perfect healthfulness and as contemptuous of mental idiosyncrasies as
children generally are of physical blemishes. For that reason Niels
and Frithjof were afraid of him. They formed themselves after him,
denied much and concealed more. Niels was especially quick to
suppress in himself anything that was not of Erik's world, and with
the burning zeal of the renegade, he scoffed at Frithjof, whose
slower, more faithful nature could not instantly throw over the old
for the new. His unkind mockery really sprang from jealousy, for he
had fallen in love with Erik on the very first day, while the latter,
in shy aloofness, half reluctant, half supercilious, just barely and
grudgingly allowed himself to be loved.</p>

<p>Among all the emotional relations of life is there any that is
finer, more sensitive, and more fervent than the exquisitely modest
love of one boy for another boy? It is a love that never speaks and
never dares to vent itself in a caress or a look, a seeing love that
grieves bitterly over every fault in the loved one, a love made up of
longing and admiration and self-forgetfulness, of pride and humility
and calmly breathing happiness.</p>

<p>Erik stayed at L&ouml;nborggaard only a little over a year. It
happened that Lyhne, on a visit to Copenhagen, took occasion to speak
about the boy to one of the leading</p>

<p class="c" align="center">67</p>

<hr>
<p class="l">scupltors there, and showed him some of Erik's sketches,
whereupon Mikkelsen, the sculptor, declared that this was talent, and
further studying was a waste of time. It did not require much
classical education to find a Greek name for a nude figure. So it was
settled that Erik was to be sent at once to the city to attend the
Academy and work in Mikkelsen's studio.</p>

<p>On the last afternoon, Niels and Erik were sitting in their room,
Niels looking at the pictures in a penny magazine, Erik deep in
Spengler's critical catalogue of the art collection at
Christiansborg. How often he had turned the leaves of this book and
tried to form a conception of the pictures from its naive
description! Sometimes he would get almost sick with longing to
behold all this art and beauty with his own eyes, to grasp it in very
truth and make that glory of line and color his own by the mere
strength of his enthusiasm. And how often, too, he had closed the
book, weary of gazing into that drifting, fantastic mist of words
which refused to solidify and take shape, refused to give forth
anything, but went on in a vague and confused shifting--flowing and
slipping away--flowing and slipping away.</p>

<p>But today it was all different. Now he had the certainty that the
shapes he read about would not be shadows from dreamland much longer,
and he felt rich in the promise of the book. The pictures rose before
him as never before, flashing out like brilliant, many-colored suns
from a mist that was golden and dancing with gold.</p>

<p>"What are you looking at?" he asked Niels.</p>

<p>Niels pointed to a portrait in his book representing Lassen, the
hero of the Second of April.</p>

<p>"How ugly he is!" commented Erik.</p>

<p class="c" align="center">68</p>

<hr>
<p>"Ugly! Why he was a hero--would you call <i>him</i> ugly, too?"
Niels turned the leaves back to the picture of a great poet.</p>

<p>"Awfully ugly!" replied Erik decisively, making a grimace. "What a
nose! And look at the mouth, and the eyes, and those tufts around his
head!"</p>

<p>Then Niels saw that he was ugly, and he was silenced. It had not
occurred to him that greatness was not always cast in a mould of
beauty.</p>

<p>"While I think of it," said Erik, closing his Spengler, "let me
give you the key to the deck-house."</p>

<p>Niels would have brushed him aside gloomily, but Erik hung a small
padlock key around his friend's neck on a broad piece of ribbon.
"Shall we go down there?" he asked.</p>

<p>They went. Frithjof they found by the garden fence. He lay there
eating green gooseberries, and had tears in his eyes because of the
parting. Besides he was hurt that the others had not looked him up;
for though he generally came uninvited, he felt that such a day
demanded a certain amount of formality. Without speaking, he held out
a handful of berries to them, but they had their favorite dishes for
dinner, and turned up their noses.</p>

<p>"Sour!" said Erik with a shudder.</p>

<p>"Indigestible truck!" added Niels, disdainfully looking down at
the proffered berries. "How can you eat it? Chuck the stuff, we're
going down to the deck-house," and he pointed with his chin at the
key, for his hands were in his pockets.</p>

<p>At that they all three set forth.</p>

<p>The deck-house was an old green-painted ship's cabin, which had
once been bought at a beach auction. It had</p>

<p class="c" align="center">69</p>

<hr>
<p class="l">been put up by the fjord, and had served as a tool-house
when the dam was being built, but now it was no longer in use. So the
boys had taken possession of it, and concealed in it their ships,
bows and arrows, leaping-poles, and other treasures, particularly
such forbidden but indis-pensible things as powder, tobacco, and
matches.</p>

<p>Niels opened the door of the deck-house with an air of gloomy
solemnity. They went in and fumbled till they found their things in
the dark corners of the empty bunks.</p>

<p>"Do you know," said Erik, with his head deep in a distant corner,
"I'm going to blow mine up."</p>

<p>"Mine and Frithjof's too!" cried Niels with a grand, consecrating
gesture.</p>

<p>"Not mine, by Joe!" exclaimed Frithjof; "then what'd we have to
sail with when Erik's gone?"</p>

<p>"What indeed!" mocked Niels, turning away contemptuously.</p>

<p>Frithjof felt uncomfortable, but when the others had gone outside,
he carefully moved his ship to a safer shelter.</p>

<p>Outside they quickly laid the powder in the ships imbedded in a
nest of tarred oakum, set the sails, fixed the fuses, lighted them,
and sprang back. Running along the beach, they signaled to the crew
on board, loudly explaining to one another every chance turn of the
ships as the result of the good captain's nautical skill. But the
ships ran aground at the point without the desired explosion having
taken place, and this gave Frithjof an opportunity nobly to sacrifice
the wadding of his cap to the manufacture of new and better
fuses.</p>

<p>With all sails set, the ships stood in toward Sj&aelig;lland reef;
the Britisher's huge frigates came heavily lurching</p>

<p class="c" align="center">70</p>

<hr>
<p class="l">in a closed ring, while the foam blew white around the
black bows, and the cannon mounted at the head filled the air with
their harsh clamor. Nearer and nearer--glowing with red and blue,
glittering with gold, the figureheads of the <i>Albion</i> and the
<i>Conqueror</i> rose fathom-high. Grayish masses of sails hid the
horizon; the smoke rolled out in great white clouds, and drifted as a
veiling mist low over the sun-bright glitter of the waves. Then the
deck of Erik's ship was splintered with a feeble little puff; the
oakum caught fire, a red blaze burst forth and ran along the spars,
ate their way smouldering along the bolt-rope, then shot like long
flashes of lightning into the sails, while the burning canvas
shriveled up, broke, and flew in large black flakes far out to sea.
The Dane-brog was still waving high on the slender top of the tall
schooner mast, the flagstaff was burned in two, the flag fluttered
wildly like red wings eager for battle--but the flame caught it, and
the smoke-blackened ship drifted without rudder or helmsman, dead and
powerless, the sport of the winds and breakers. Niels's ship did not
burn so well; the powder had caught fire and some smoke came out, but
that was all, and it was not enough.</p>

<p>"Hey, there'" called Niels from the point, "sink her! Point the
starboard cannon down the aft hatch and give her a volley!" He bent
down and picked up a stone, "Ready, fire!" and the stone flew from
his hand.</p>

<p>Erik and Frithjof followed suit, and soon the hull was in
splinters. Then Erik's ship shared the same fate. The wreckage was
hauled ashore to make a bonfire. It was piled up with dry seaweed and
grass into a burning heap, from which thick smoke issued, while the
crystals that hung on the seaweed burst and crackled with the intense
heat.</p>

<p class="c" align="center">71</p>

<hr>
<p>For a long time the boys sat quietly around the bonfire, but
suddenly Niels, still gloomy, jumped up and brought all his things
from the deck-house, broke them into little bits, and threw them into
the flames. Then Erik brought his, and Frithjof also brought some.
The flames of the sacrificial pyre leaped so high that Erik was
afraid they might be seen from the pasture, and began to smother them
with wet seaweed, but Niels stood still, gazing sorrowfully after the
smoke that drifted along the beach. Frithjof kept in the background
and hummed to himself a heroic lay, which he accompanied secretly,
now and then, with a sweeping, bard-like gesture, as if he were
playing on the strings of an invisible harp.</p>

<p>At last the fire died down, and Erik and Frithjof went home, while
Niels stayed behind to lock the deck-house. That done, he looked
cautiously after the others, and then threw key and ribbon far out
into the fjord. Erik happened to look around at that moment and saw
them fall, but he quickly turned his head away, and began to run a
race with Frithjof.</p>

<p>The next day he left.</p>

<p><br>
</p>

<p>For a while they missed him sorely and bitterly, for their life
had been gradually formed on the supposition that they were three to
share it. Three were company, variety, change; two were boredom and
nothing at all.</p>

<p>What in the word could two find to do?</p>

<p>Could two shoot at a target or two play ball? They could play
Friday and Robinson Crusoe, to be sure, but then who would be the
savages?</p>

<p>Such Sundays! Niels was so very weary of existence that he began
first to review and afterwards, with the aid</p>

<p class="c" align="center">72</p>

<hr>
<p class="l">of Mr. Bigum's large atlas, to extend his geographical
knowledge far beyond the prescribed bounds. Finally, he started to
read the whole Bible through and to keep a diary. But Frithjof, in
his utter loneliness, stooped so low as to seek consolation in
playing with his sisters.</p>

<p>After a while the past became less vivid to them, the longing less
keen. Sometimes on a quiet evening, when the sun reddened the walls
in the lonely chamber, and the distant, monotonous calling of the
cuckoo died down, making the stillness wider and larger, the longing
would come creeping into Niels's mind, stealing its power; but it no
longer tortured, it was a vague thing that lay lightly on him and was
half sweet like a pain that is passing.</p>

<p>His letters showed the same trend. In the beginning they were full
of regrets, questions, and wishes loosely strung together, but soon
they grew longer, dealt more with externals, narrated, and were
written throughout in a well-formed style that hid between the lines
a certain conscious pleasure in being able to write so well.</p>

<p>As time passed, many things that had not dared to show themselves
while Erik was there began to raise their heads. Imagination strewed
its bright flowers through the humdrum calm of an eventless life. A
dream atmosphere enveloped Niels's mind, bringing with it the
provocative fragrance of life, and, hidden in the fragrance, the
insidious poison of life-thirsting fancies.</p>

<p>So Niels grows up, and all the influences of his childhood work on
the plastic clay. Everything helps to shape it; everything is
significant, the real and the dreamed, what is known and what is
foreshadowed--all add their touch, lightly but surely, to that
tracery of lines which is destined to be first hollowed out and
deepened and afterwards flattened out and smoothed away.</p>

<p class="c" align="center">73</p>

<hr>
<h2 class="c" align="center">Chapter VI</h2>

<p class="l">"MR. LYHNE--Mrs. Boye; Mr. Frithjof Petersen--Mrs.
Boye."</p>

<p>It was Erik who performed the introduction, and it took place in
Mikkelsen's studio, a light, spacious room with a floor of stamped
clay and a ceiling twenty-five feet high. At one end of the room two
portals led to the yard; at the other, a series of doors opened into
the smaller studios within. Everything was gray with the dust of clay
and plaster and marble. It had made the cobweb threads overhead as
thick as twine and had drawn river maps on the large window-panes. It
filled eyes and nose and mouth with outlined muscles, hair, and
draperies on the medley of casts that filled the long shelves running
round the room and made them look like a frieze from the destruction
of Jerusalem. Even the laurels, high trees planted in big tubs in a
corner near one of the portals, were powdered till they became grayer
than gray olives.</p>

<p>Erik stood at his modeling in the middle of the studio wearing his
blouse and with a paper cup on his dark, wavy hair. He had acquired a
moustashe and looked quite manly beside his two friends, who had just
taken their bachelor's degree and, still pale and tired from</p>

<p class="c" align="center">74</p>

<hr>
<p class="l">their examinations, looked provincially proper with
their too new clothes and their too closely cropped heads in rather
large caps.</p>

<p>At a little distance from Erik's scaffolding, Mrs. Boye sat in a
low high-backed chair, holding a richly bound book in one hand and a
lump of clay in the other. She was small, quite small, and slightly
brunette in coloring, with clear, light brown eyes. Her skin had a
luminous whiteness, but in the shadows of the rounded cheek and
throat it deepened to a dull golden tone which went well with the
burnished hair of a dusky hue changing to a tawny blondness in the
high lights.</p>

<p>She was laughing when they came in, as a child laughs--a long,
merry peal, gleefully loud, delightfully free. Her eyes, too, had the
artless gaze of a child, and the frank smile on her lips seemed all
the more childlike because the shortness of her upper lip left the
mouth slightly open revealing milk-white teeth.</p>

<p>But she was no child.</p>

<p>Was she a little and thirty? The fullness of the chin did not say
"No," nor the ripe glow of the lower lip. Her figure was well rounded
with firm, luxuriant outlines accentuated by the dark blue dress,
which fitted snugly as a riding habit around her waist, arms, and
bosom. A dull crimson silk kerchief lay in rich folds around her neck
and over her shoulders, its ends tucked into the low pointed neck of
her bodice. Carnations of the same color were fastened in her
hair.</p>

<p>"I am afraid we interrupted a pleasant reading," said Frithjof
with a glance at the richly bound book.</p>

<p>"No, indeed--not in the least. We had been quarreling for a full
hour about what we read," replied Mrs. Boye. "Mr. Refstrup is a great
idealist in everything that has</p>

<p class="c" align="center">75</p>

<hr>
<p class="l">to do with art, while I think it's dreadfully tiresome--
all this about the crude reality that has to be purified and
clarified and regenerated and what not until there is just pure
nothingness left. Do me the favor of looking at that Bacchante of
Mikkelsen's--the one which deaf Traffelini over there is cutting in
marble. If I were to enter her in a descriptive catalogue . . . Good
heavens! Number 77. A young lady in n&eacute;glig&eacute; is standing
thoughtfully on both her feet and doesn't know what to do with a
bunch of grapes. She should crush those grapes if I had my way--crush
them till the red juice ran down her breast--now shouldn't she? Don't
you agree with me?" and she caught Frithjof by the sleeve, almost
shaking him in her childlike eagerness.</p>

<p>"Yes," Frithjof admitted; "yes, I do think there is something
lacking--something of freshness--of spontaneity--"</p>

<p>"It's simply naturalness that's lacking, and good heavens,
<i>why</i> can't we be natural? Oh, I know perfectly well; it's
because we lack the courage. Neither the artists nor the poets are
brave enough to own up to human nature as it is. Shakespeare was,
though."</p>

<p>"Well, you know," came from Erik behind the figure he was
modeling, "I never could get along very well with Shakespeare. It
seems to me he does too much of it; he whirls you around till you
don't know where you are."</p>

<p>"I shouldn't go so far as to say that," Frithjof demurred; "but on
the other hand," he added with an indulgent smile, "I cannot call the
berserker ragings of the great English poet by the name of conscious
and intelligent artistic courage."</p>

<p>"Really? Gracious, how funny you are!" and she laughed till she
was tired. She had risen and was stroll-</p>

<p class="c" align="center">76</p>

<hr>
<p class="l">ing about the studio, but suddenly she turned, held out
her arms toward Frithjof, and cried, "God bless you!" and laughed
again until she was almost bent double.</p>

<p>Frithjof was on the verge of getting offended, but it seemed too
fussy to go away angry, especially as he knew himself to be in the
right, and moreover the lady was very pretty. So he stayed and began
to talk to Erik, all the while trying for Mrs. Boye's benefit to
infuse a tone of mature tolerance into his voice.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Mrs. Boye was roaming about at the other end of the
studio, thoughtfully humming a tune, which sometimes rose in a few
quick, laughing trills, then sank again into a slow, solemn
recitative.</p>

<p>A head of the young Augustus was standing on a large packing case.
She began to dust it. Then she found some clay and made moustaches, a
pointed beard, and finally earrings, which she fastened on it.</p>

<p>While she was busy with this, Niels managed to stroll in her
direction under cover of examining the casts. She had not glanced
toward him once, but she must have sensed that he was there, for,
without turning, she held out her hand to him and asked him to bring
Erik's hat.</p>

<p>Niels put the hat into her outstretched hand, and she set it on
the head of Augustus.</p>

<p>"Good old Shakespeareson," she said, patting the cheek of the
travestied bust, "stupid old fellow who didn't know what he was
doing! Did he just sit there and daub ink till he turned out a Hamlet
head without thinking of it--did he?" She lifted the hat from the
bust and passed her hand over the forehead in a motherly way as if
she would push back its hair. "Lucky old chap, for all that! More
than half lucky old poet boy!--For you must admit that he wasn't at
all bad as a writer, this Shakespeare?"</p>

<p class="c" align="center">77</p>

<hr>
<p>"I confess I have my own opinion of that man," replied Niels,
slightly vexed and blushing.</p>

<p>"Goodness gracious! Have you too got your own opinion about
Shakespeare? Then what is your opinion? Are you for us or against
us?" She struck an attitude by the side of the bust and stood there,
smiling, with her arm resting on its neck.</p>

<p>"I am unable to say whether the opinion which you are astonished
to learn I possess is so fortunate as to acquire significance from
the fact of agreeing with your own, but I do think I may say that it
is <i>for</i> you and your <i>prot&eacute;g&eacute;.</i> At any rate
I hold the opinion that he knew what he was doing, weighed what he
was doing, and dared it. Many a time he dared in doubt, and the doubt
is still apparant. At other times he only half dared, and then he
blurred over with new features that which he did not have courage to
leave as he first had it."</p>

<p>And he went on in this strain.</p>

<p>While he was speaking, Mrs. Boye grew more and more restless. She
looked nervously first to one side, then to the other, and drummed
impatiently with her fingers, while her face clouded by a troubled
look which finally deepened to one of pain.</p>

<p>At last she could contain herself no longer.</p>

<p>"Don't forget what you were going to say," she exclaimed, "but I
implore you, Mr. Lyhne, stop doing that with your hand--that gesture
as if you were pulling teeth! Please do, and don't let me interrupt
you! Now I am all attention again, and I quite agree with you."</p>

<p>"But then it's of no use to say any more."</p>

<p>"Why not?"</p>

<p>"When we agree?"</p>

<p>"When we agreel"</p>

<p class="c" align="center">78</p>

<hr>
<p>Neither of them meant anything in particular by these last words,
but they said them in a significant tone, as if a world of delicate
meanings were hidden in them, and looked at each other with a subtle
smile, like an afterglow of the wit that had just flashed between
them, while each wondered what the other meant and felt slightly
annoyed at being so slow of comprehension.</p>

<p>They strolled back to the other end of the room, and Mrs. Boye
took her seat on the low chair again.</p>

<p>Erik and Frithjof had talked till they were beginning to be bored
with each other and were glad to be joined by the others. Frithjof
approached Mrs. Boye and made himself agreeable, while Erik, with the
modesty of the host, kept himself in the background.</p>

<p>"If I were curious," said Frithjof, "I should inquire what the
book was that made you and Refstrup quarrel just as we were coming
in."</p>

<p>"Do you inquire?"</p>

<p>"I do."</p>

<p>"Ergo?"</p>

<p>"Ergo!" replied Frithjof with a humble, asquiescent bow.</p>

<p>She held up the book and solemnly announced: <i>"Helge,</i>
Oehlenschl&auml;ger's <i>Helge.--</i>And what canto? It was The
Mermaid visits King Helge.'--And what verse! It was the lines telling
of how Tangkjaer lay down by Helge's side and how he couldn't control
his curiosity any longer, but turned</p>

<blockquote>--and at his side,<br>
 With white arms soft and round,<br>
 The greatest beauty he espied<br>
 That e'er on earth was found.</blockquote>

<p class="c" align="center">79</p>

<hr>
<blockquote>The maid had doffed her cloak of gray;<br>
 Her lovely limbs were bare,<br>
 Save for the robe like silver spray<br>
 That veiled her form so fair.</blockquote>

<p>That is all he allows us to see of the mermaid's charms, and that
is what I am dissatisfied with. I want a luxuriant, glowing picture
there; I want to see something so dazzling that it takes my breath
away. I want to be initiated into the mysterious beauty of such a
mermaid body, and I ask of you, what can I make of lovely limbs with
a piece of gauze spread over them? Good heavens! No, she should have
been naked as a wave and with the wild lure of the sea about her. Her
skin should have had something of the phosphorescence of the summer
ocean and her hair something of the black, tangled horror of the
seaweed. Am I not right? Yes, and a thousand tints of the water
should come and go in the changeful glitter of her eyes. Her pale
breast must be cool with a voluptuous coolness, and her limbs have
the flowing lines of the waves. The power of the maelstrom must be in
her kiss, and the yielding softness of the foam in the embrace of her
arms."</p>

<p>She had talked herself into a glow, and stood there still animated
by her theme, looking at her young listeners with large, inquiring
child-eyes.</p>

<p>But they said nothing. Niels had flushed scarlet, and Erik looked
extremely embarrassed. Frithjof was absolutely carried away and
stared at her with the most open admiration, though of the three he
was the one least aware how entrancingly beautiful she was, as she
stood there with the glamor of her words about her.</p>

<p>Not many weeks had passed before Niels and Frithjof</p>

<p class="c" align="center">80</p>

<hr>
<p class="l">were as constant visitors in Mrs. Boye's home as Erik
Refstrap. Besides her pale niece, they met a great many young people,
coming poets, painters, actors, and architects, all artists by virtue
of their youth rather than their talent, all full of hope, valiant,
lusting for battle, and easily moved to enthusiasm. It is true, there
were among them some of those quiet dreamers who bleat wistfully
toward the faded ideals of the past; but most of them were full of
ideas that were modern at the time, drunk with the theories of
modernity, wild with its powers, dazzled by its clear morning light.
They were modern, belligerently modern, modern to excess, and perhaps
not the least because in their inmost hearts there was a strange,
instinctive longing which had to be stifled, a longing which the new
spirit could not satisfy--worldwide, all-embracing, all-powerful, and
all-enlightening though it was.</p>

<p>But, for all that, the exultation of the storm was in their young
souls. They had faith in the light of the great stars of thought;
they had hope fathomless as the ocean. Enthusiasm bore them on the
wings of the eagle, and their hearts expanded with the courage of
thousands.</p>

<p>No doubt life would in time wear it all out, lull most of it to
sleep; worldly wisdom would break down much, and cowardice would
sweep away the rest--but what of it? The time that has gone with
happiness does not come back with grief, and nothing the future may
bring can wither a day or wipe out an hour in the life that has been
lived.</p>

<p>To Niels the world, in those days, began to wear a different
aspect. He heard his own vaguest, most secret thoughts loudly
proclaimed by ten different mouths. He saw his own unique ideas,
which to him had been a misty</p>

<p class="c" align="center">81</p>

<hr>
<p class="l">landscape, with lines blurred by fog, with unknown
depths and muted notes--he saw this landscape unveiled in the bright,
clear, sharp colors of day, revealed in every detail, furrowed
everywhere by roads, and with people swarming on the roads. There was
something strangely unreal in the very fact that the creations of his
fancy had become so real.</p>

<p>He was no longer a lonely child-king, reigning over lands that his
own dreams had conjured up. No, he was one of a crowd, a man in an
army, a soldier in the service of modern ideas. A sword had been
placed in his hand, and a banner waved before him.</p>

<p>What a wonderful time full of promise! And how strange to hear
with his ears the indistinct, mysterious whisper of his soul now
sounding through the air of reality like wild, challenging trumpet
blasts, like the thunder of battering rams against temple walls, like
the whizzing of David's pebble against Goliath's brow, like exultant
fanfares. It was as though he heard himself speaking, with strange
tongues, with a clarity and power not his own, about that which
belonged to his deepest, innermost self.</p>

<p>This gospel of modernity, with its message of dissolution and
perfection, did not sound only from the lips of his contemporaries.
There were older men with names that carried weight whose eyes were
likewise open to the glories of new ideas. These men used more
pompous words and had more magnificent conceptions; the names of past
centuries swept along in their train; history was with them--the
history of the world and the human mind, the Odyssey of thought.
These were men who in their youth had been moved by the very things
that now thrilled the young people and had borne witness to the</p>

<p class="c" align="center">82</p>

<hr>
<p class="l">spirit within them; but when they heard in their own
voices the sound which tells a man crying in the wilderness that he
is alone, they were silenced. The young people, however, remembered
only that these men had spoken, not that they had been silent; they
were ready to bring laurel wreaths and martyr crowns, willing to
admire and happy in their admiration. Nor did the objects of their
homage repel this late-born appreciation; they put on the crowns in
good faith, looked at themselves in a large and historic light, and
poetized out of their past the less heroic features; as for the old
conviction, which ill winds had cooled, they soon talked it into a
glow again.</p>

<p>Niels Lyhne's family in Copenhagen, more particularly the old
Councillor Neergaards, were not at all pleased with the circle their
young relative had entered. It was not the modern ideas that worried
them, but rather the fact that some of the young men found long hair,
great hunting boots, and a slight slovenliness favorable to the
growth of such ideas, and though Niels himself was not at all
fanatical on this point, it was annoying to meet him, and even more
annoying to have their friends meet him, in company with youths who
could be thus characterized. These things, however, were trifles
compared to his intimacy with Mrs. Boye and his frequenting the
theater in company with her and her pale niece.</p>

<p>Not that there was anything in particular to be said against Mrs.
Boye, but people talked about her. They said a great many things.</p>

<p>She was well born, a Konneroy, and the Konneroys were among the
oldest, most finely patrician families in town. Yet she had broken
with them. Some said it was on account of a dissipated brother, whom
they had</p>

<p class="c" align="center">83</p>

<hr>
<p class="l">sent off to the colonies to get rid of him. Certain it
was that the break was complete, and there were even whispers that
old Konneroy had cursed her, and afterwards had had an attack of his
bad spring asthma.</p>

<p>All this had happened after she became a widow.</p>

<p>Mr. Boye, her husband, had been a pharmaceutist, an <i>assessor
pharmacia,</i> and had been knighted. When he died he was sixty and
owned a barrel and a half of gold. So far as any one knew, they had
lived quite happily together. In the first three years of their
marriage, the elderly husband had been very much in love, but later
they had each lived their own life, he busy with his garden and with
keeping up his reputation as a great man at stag parties, she with
theaters, romantic music, and German poetry.</p>

<p>Then he died.</p>

<p>When the year of mourning was over, the widow went to Italy and
lived there for two or three years, spending most of the time in
Rome. There was nothing in the rumor that she had smoked opium in the
French club, nor in the story that she had allowed herself to be
modeled in the same manner as Paulina Borghese; and the little
Russian prince who shot himself while she was in Naples did not
commit suicide for her sake. It was true, however, that German
artists never tired of serenading her; and it was true that one
morning she had donned the dress of an Albanian peasant girl and had
seated herself on the steps of a church high up in the Via Sistina,
where a newly arrived artist had engaged her to stand as a model for
him with a pitcher on her head and a little brown boy holding her
hand. At least there was such a picture hanging on her wall.</p>

<p class="c" align="center">84</p>

<hr>
<p>On the way home from Italy she met a countryman, a noted clever
critic, who would rather have been a poet. A negative, sceptical
nature, people called him, a keen mind, one who dealt harshly and
pitilessly with others because he dealt harshly and pitilessly with
himself and supposed his brutality to be justified by that fact.
Nevertheless, he was not quite what they believed him to be; he was
not so repellently uncompromising nor so robustly consistent as he
appeared. Although he was always in a state of strife against the
idealistic tendencies of the age and called them by more disparaging
names, still he felt drawn toward these dreamy, ethereal ideals, this
blue, blue-mist mysticism, these unattainable heights and evanescent
lights; they appealed to him more than the earthborn opinions for
which he did battle and in which, most of the time, he believed.</p>

<p>Rather against his will, he fell in love with Mrs. Boye, but he
did not tell her so, for his was not a young and open love, nor a
hopeful one. He loved her as a creature of another, a finer and
happier race than his own, and there was in his love a rancor, an
instinctive rage against everything in her that bore the marks of
race.</p>

<p>He looked with hostile, jealous eyes upon her sentiments and
opinions, her tastes and views of life. He fought with every weapon
he possessed, with subtle eloquence, with heartless logic and harsh
authority, with derision wrapped in pity, to bring her over to his
side, and he won. But when truth had conquered, and she had become
like him, he saw that the victory was too complete, that he had loved
her as she was, with her illusions and prejudices, her dreams and her
errors, and not as she had now become. Dissatisfied with himself,
with her</p>

<p class="c" align="center">85</p>

<hr>
<p class="l">and with everything in his own country, he went away and
did not return. But then she had just begun to love him.</p>

<p>This relationship, of course, gave people food for talk, and they
made the most of it. The Councillor's wife told Niels about it in the
tone that aged virtue uses in speaking of young error, but Niels took
it in a manner that offended and horrified the old lady. He replied
in a high strain about the tyranny of society and the freedom of the
individual, about the plebeian respectability of the mob and the
nobility of passion.</p>

<p>From that day on he went but seldom to the home of his solicitous
relatives, but Mrs. Boye saw him all the more frequently.</p>

<p class="c" align="center">86</p>

<hr>
<h2 class="c" align="center">Chapter VII</h2>

<p class="l">IT was an evening in spring; the sun threw a red light
into the room, as it sank toward the horizon. The wings of the
windmill on the embankment drew shadows over the window panes and the
walls, coming, going, in a monotonous swinging from darkness to
light: a moment of darkness, two moments of light.</p>

<p>At the window, Niels Lyhne sat gazing through the darkly burnished
elms on the embankment to the fiery clouds beyond. He had been in the
country, walking under blossoming beeches, past green rye fields,
over flower-decked meadows. Everything had been so fair and light,
the sky so blue, the Sound so bright, the women he met so wondrously
beautiful. Singing, he had followed the forest path, but soon the
words had died out of his song, then the rhythm was lost, at last the
tones were muted, and silence came over him like a fit of giddiness.
He closed his eyes, and still he felt how his body drank the light,
and his nerves vibrated with it. Every breath he drew of the cool,
intoxicating air sent his blood rushing more wildly through the
quivering, helpless veins. He felt as though all the teeming,
budding, growing, germinating forces of spring were mysteriously
striving to vent themselves through him in a mighty cry,</p>

<p class="c" align="center">87</p>

<hr>
<p class="l">and he thirsted for this cry, listened for it, till his
listening grew into a vague, turgid longing.</p>

<p>Now, as he sat there by the window, the longing awoke in him
again.</p>

<p>He yearned for a thousand tremulous dreams, for cool and delicate
images, transparent tints, fleeting scents, and exquisite music from
streams of highly strung, tensely drawn silvery strings--and then
silence, the innermost heart of silence, where the waves of air never
bore a single stray tone, but where all was rest unto death, steeped
in the calm glow of red colors and the languid warmth of fiery
fragrance.--This was not what he longed for, but the images glided
forth from his mood and submerged all else until he turned from them
to follow his own train of thought again.</p>

<p>He was weary of himself, of cold ideas and brain dreams. Life a
poem? Not when you went about forever poetizing about your own life
instead of living it. How innocuous it all was, and empty, empty,
empty! This chasing after yourself, craftily observing your own
tracks--in a circle, of course. This sham diving into the stream of
life while all the time you sat angling after yourself, fishing
yourself up in one curious disguise or another! If he could only be
overwhelmed by something--life, love, passion--so that he could no
longer shape it into poems, but had to let it shape him!</p>

<p>Involuntarily he made a gesture as if to ward it off with his
hand. After all, he was afraid in his inmost heart of this mighty
thing called passion. This storm wind sweeping away everything
settled and authorized and acquired in humanity as if it were dead
leaves. He did not like it! This roaring flame squandering itself in
its own smoke--no, <i>he</i> wanted to burn slowly.</p>

<p class="c" align="center">88</p>

<hr>
<p>And yet this living on at half speed in quiet waters, always in
sight of land, seemed so paltry. Would that the storm and waves would
come! If he only knew how, his sails should fly to the yards for a
merry run over the Spanish Main of life! Farewell to the slowly
dripping days, farewell to the pleasant little hours! Peace be with
you, you dull moods that have to be furbished with poetry before you
can shine, you lukewarm emotions that have to be clothed in warm
dreams and yet freeze to death! May you go to your own place! I am
headed for a coast where sentiments twine themselves like luxuriant
vines around every fiber of the heart--a rank forest; for every vine
that withers, twenty are in blossom; for each one that blossoms, a
hundred are in bud.</p>

<p>Oh, that I were there!</p>

<p>He grew tired of his longing and sick of himself. He needed
people. But of course, Erik was not in now. Frith-jof had been with
him all morning, and it was too late for the theater. Nevertheless he
went out and strolled dejectedly through the streets.</p>

<p>Perhaps Mrs. Boye would be in. This was not one of her evenings
and it was rather late. Suppose he try, anyway.</p>

<p>Mrs. Boye was in. She was at home alone. Too tired from the spring
air to go to a dinner party with her niece, she had preferred to lie
on the sofa, drinking strong tea and reading Heine; but now she was
tired of verses and wanted to play lotto.</p>

<p>So they played lotto. Fifteen, twenty, thirty-seven, a long series
of figures, the rattling of dice in a bag, and an irritating sound of
balls rolling on the floor in the apartment above them. . . .</p>

<p>"This is not amusing," said Mrs. Boye, when they had</p>

<p class="c" align="center">89</p>

<hr>
<p class="l">played for a long time without covering any numbers. Is
it?--No!" she answered herself and shook her head disconsolately.
"But what else can we play?"</p>

<p>She folded her hands before her on the disks and looked at Niels
with a hopeless, inquiring gaze.</p>

<p>Niels really did not know.</p>

<p>"Anything but music!" She bent her face down over her hands and
touched her lips to the knuckles, one after the other, the whole row,
then back again. "This is the most wretched existence in the world,"
she said, looking up. "It isn't possible to have anything like an
adventure, and the small happenings that life has to offer are surely
not enough to keep one's spirits up. Don't you feel that, too?"</p>

<p>"Well I can't suggest anything better than that we act like the
Caliph in Arabian Nights. With that silk kimono you are wearing, if
you would only wind a white cloth around your head, and let me have
your large Indian shawl, we could easily pass for two merchants from
Mossul."</p>

<p>"And what should we two unfortunate merchants do?"</p>

<p>"Go down to Storm bridge, hire a boat for twenty pieces of gold,
and sail up the dark river."</p>

<p>"Past the sand chests?"</p>

<p>"Yes, with colored lamps on the masthead."</p>

<p>"Like Ganem, the Slave of Love.--Oh, I know that line of thought
so well! It's exactly like a man--to get so terribly busy building up
scenery and background, forgetting the action itself for the setting.
Have you never noticed that women live much less in their imagination
than men? We don't know how to taste pleasure in our fancy or escape
from pain with a fanciful consolation. What is, is. Imagination--it
is so innocuous. When we get as old as I am now, then sometimes we
content ourselves</p>

<p class="c" align="center">90</p>

<hr>
<p class="l">with the poverty-stricken comedy of imagination. But we
ought never to do it--never I</p>

<p>She settled herself languidly on the sofa, half reclining her hand
under her chin, her elbow supported by the cushions. She gazed
dreamily out before her, and seemed quite lost in melancholy
thoughts.</p>

<p>Niels was silent too, and the room was so quiet that the restless
hopping of the canary bird was plainly heard; the great clock ticked
and ticked its way through the silence, louder and louder, and a
string in the open piano, suddenly vibrating, emitted a long, low
dying note that blended with the softly singing stillness.</p>

<p>She looked very young as she lay there, flooded from head to foot
in the soft yellow light of the lamp above her. There was something
alluring in the incongruity of her beautiful, strongly moulded throat
and matronly Charlotte Corday cap with the frank child eyes and the
little mouth opening over milkwhite teeth.</p>

<p>Niels looked at her admiringly.</p>

<p>"How strange it is to long for one's self!" she said; "and yet I
often, so often, long for myself as a young girl. I love her as one
whom I had been very close to and shared life and happiness and
everything with, and then had lost while I stood helpless. What a
wonderful time that was! You cannot conceive the purity and delicacy
of such a young girl's soul when she is just beginning to love for
the first time. It can only be told in music, but you can think of it
as a festival in a fairy palace, where the air shines like bluish
silver. It is filled with cool flowers, and they change color, their
tints are slowly shifting. Everything is song, jubilant and yet soft.
Dim presentiments gleam and glow like mystic wine in exquisite dream
goblets. It is all song and fragrance; a thousand scents</p>

<p class="c" align="center">91</p>

<hr>
<p class="l">are wafted through the palace. Oh, I could weep when I
think of it, and when I think that if it could all come back to me,
by a miracle, just as it was, it would no longer bear me up; I should
fall through like a cow trying to dance on cobwebs."</p>

<p>"No, quite the contrary," said Niels eagerly, and his voice
trembled, as he went on: "no, the love you could feel now would be
much finer, much more spiritual than that young girl's."</p>

<p>"Spiritual! I hate this spiritual love. The flowers growing from
that soil are made of cotton cloth; they don't even grow, they are
taken from the head and stuck in the heart, because the heart has no
flowers of its own. That is exactly what I envy in the young girl:
everything about her is genuine, she does not fill the goblet of her
love with the makeshift of imagination. Do not suppose, because her
love is shot through and shadowed over by imagined pictures and again
pictures in a great, teeming vagueness, that she cares more for those
images than for the earth she walks upon. It is only that all her
senses and instincts and powers are reaching out for love
everywhere--everywhere, without ever feeling weary. But she does not
revel in her fancies, nor even so much as rest in them; no, she is
very much more genuine, so genuine that in her own unwitting manner
she very often becomes innocently cynical. You have no idea, for
instance, of what intoxicating pleasure a young girl finds in
breathing secretly the odor of cigars that clings to the clothes of
the man she loves--that is a thousand times more to her than a whole
conflagration of fancies. I despise imagination. What good is it,
when our whole being yearns toward the heart of another, to be
admitted only to the chilly ante-room of his imagination! And that is
what happens</p>

<p class="c" align="center">92</p>

<hr>
<p class="l">so often. How often we have to submit to letting the man
we love deck us out with his imagination, put a halo around our head,
tie wings on our shoulders, and wrap us in a star-spangled robe! Then
at last he finds us worthy of his love, when we masquerade in this
costume; but then we can't be ourselves, because we are too dressed
up, and because men confuse us by kneeling in the dust and worshiping
us instead of just taking us as we are and simply loving us."</p>

<p>Niels was quite bewildered. He had picked up the handkerchief she
dropped and sat there intoxicating himself with its perfume. He was
not at all prepared to have her look at him in that impatient,
questioning way, just as he was absorbed in studying her hand, but he
managed to answer that he thought a man could not give a finer proof
of his love than this--that he had to justify himself to himself for
loving a human being so unutterably, and therefore set her so high
and surrounded her with a nimbus of divinity.</p>

<p>"But that is just what I find so insulting," said Mrs. Boye, "as
if we were not divine enough in ourselves."</p>

<p>Niels smiled complacently.</p>

<p>"No, you mustn't smile, I'm not joking. It is really very serious,
for this adoration is at bottom tyrannical in its fanaticism; it
cramps us in a mould of man's ideal. Slash a heel and clip a toe!
Anything in us that doesn't square with man's conception has to be
eliminated, perhaps not by force, but by ignoring it, systematically
relegating it to oblivion, and never giving it a chance to develop,
while the qualities we don't possess or that aren't in the least
characteristic of us are forced to the rankest growth by lauding them
to the skies, taking for granted that we have them in the fullest
measure, and making them the</p>

<p class="c" align="center">93</p>

<hr>
<p class="l">cornerstone on which man builds his love. I say that we
are subjected to a drill; a man's love puts us through a drill. And
we submit to it, even those who love no one submit to it,
contemptible minions that we are!"</p>

<p>She had risen from her reclining posture and looked threateningly
at Niels.</p>

<p>"If I were beautiful!--oh, I mean ravishingly beautiful, more
alluring than any woman who ever lived, so that all who saw me were
struck with unquenchable, agonizing love as by witchcraft--then I
would use the power of my beauty to make them adore <i>me,</i> not
then: traditional bloodless ideal, but myself, as I am, every inch,
every line of <i>my</i> being, every gleam of <i>my</i> nature!"</p>

<p>She had risen now to her full height, and Niels thought he ought
to go, but he stood turning over in his mind a great many audacious
words, which, after all, he did not dare to utter. At last, summoning
all his courage, he seized her hand and kissed it, but she gave him
her other hand to kiss too, and then he could say nothing more than:
"Good night."</p>

<p>Niels Lyhne had fallen in love with Mrs. Boye, and he was happy
because of it.</p>

<p>When he went home through the same streets where he had strolled
so dejectedly that same evening, it seemed to him that ages had
passed since he walked there. His bearing had acquired a new poise, a
grave decorum, and when he carefully buttoned his gloves, he did so
with a subconscious sense that he had undergone a great change which
somehow demanded that he should button his gloves--carefully.</p>

<p>Too much absorbed to think of sleep, he went up on the
embankment.</p>

<p>It seemed to him that his thoughts flowed very quietly.</p>

<p class="c" align="center">94</p>

<hr>
<p>He was surprised at his own calm, but he did not have perfect
faith in it. He felt as though something in the very depths of his
being were bubbling, very softly, but persistently: welling up,
seething, pressing on, but far, far away. He was in a mood as one who
waits for something that must come from afar, a distant music that
must draw near, little by little, singing, murmuring, frothing,
rushing, roaring, and whirling down over him, catching him up he knew
not how, carrying him he knew not whither, coming on as a flood,
breaking as a surf, and then--</p>

<p>But now he was calm. There was only the tremulous singing in the
distance; otherwise all was peace and tranquility.</p>

<p>He loved--he said it aloud to himself again and again. The words
had such a strange ring of dignity, and held such deep meanings. They
meant that he was no longer a captive in the imagined world of his
childhood, nor was he the sport of aimless longings and misty dreams.
He had escaped from the elf land that had grown up with him and
around him, encircling him with a hundred arms, blindfolding him with
a hundred hands. He had broken away from its grasp and bad become
master of himself, and though it reached after him, implored him with
dumb appealing eyes, and beckoned him with white fluttering garments,
its power was dead as a dream killed by day, a mist dispelled by the
sun. Was not his young love day and sun and all the world? He had
been strutting about in a royal purple not yet spun, and had taken
his seat on a throne not yet built; but now he stood on a high
mountain, looking out over the world that stretched before him like a
plain. In this world thirsting for song he had as yet no existence
and was not even awaited. What a rapturous thought it was that, in
all this</p>

<p class="c" align="center">95</p>

<hr>
<p class="l">silent, wakeful infinity, not a breath of his spirit had
stirred a leaf or raised a ripple. It was all his to win, and he knew
that he could win it. He felt strong and all-conquering as only those
can feel whose songs are still unsung, throbbing in their own
breast.</p>

<p>The soft spring air was full of perfumes, not saturated with them
as the summer nights may be, but rather as it were streaked--now with
the pungent aroma from resinous young poplars, now with the cool
breath of late violets, and again with the sweet almond odor of
cherry trees. The scents came and mingled, were wafted away and
dissolved; sometimes one would quicken and free itself from the
others, only to die as suddenly or to vanish slowly on a breath of
wind. Light moods flitted across his mind like the shadows from this
fitful dance of scents, and as the perfumes mocked his senses by
coming and going as they listed, so his mind was baffled by his vain
longing to be borne aloft, calmly resting in tranquil flight on the
slowly gliding wings of a mood. For his moods were not yet birds with
wings strong enough to carry him; they were down and feathers only,
drifting on the wind, falling like snow, and melting.</p>

<p>He tried to recall the picture of her as she lay on the sofa and
talked to him, but it would not come. He saw her vanishing in a lane
of trees; or sitting and reading with her hat on, holding one of the
large white leaves in her gloved fingers, just on the point of
turning it, then turning leaf after leaf. He saw her entering her
carriage in the evening after the theater and nodding to him behind
the pane; then the carriage drove away, and he stood looking after
it; it kept on driving, and he still followed it with his eyes.
Indifferent faces came and spoke to him, figures he had not seen for
years passed down</p>

<p class="c" align="center">96</p>

<hr>
<p class="l">the street, turned and looked after him, and still the
carriage kept on driving, and he could not get rid of it, could not
think of other pictures because of that carriage. Then, just as he
was getting nervous with impatience, it came: the yellow light from
the lamp, the eyes, the mouth, the hand under the chin, as plainly as
if it were all before him there in the darkness.</p>

<p>How lovely she was, how mild, how fair! He loved her with a desire
that knelt at her feet, begging for all this seductive beauty. Cast
yourself from your throne down to me! Make yourself my slave! Put the
chain around your neck with your own hands, but not in sport--I want
to pull the chain, I demand submission in your every limb, bondage in
your eyes! Oh, that I could draw you to me with a love philter, but,
no, a love philter would compel you, you would yield to its power
without volition, and I want none to be your master but myself. Your
will must be broken in your hands, and you must hold it out humbly to
me. You shall be my queen, and I your slave, but my slave's foot must
be on your queenly neck. There is no lunacy in this desire, for is it
not in the nature of a woman's love to be proud and strong and to
bend? It is love, I know, to be weak and to reign.</p>

<p>He felt that he could never draw to himself the part of her soul
that was one with the luxuriant, glowing, sensuous-soft aspect of her
beauty; it would never clasp him in those gleaming Juno arms, never
in passionate weakness give that voluptuous neck to his kisses--never
in all eternity. He saw it all clearly. He could win, perhaps he
already had won, the young girl in her, and he was sure that she, the
full-blooded beauty, felt this fair young creature who had died
within her mysteriously stirring in her living grave to clasp him
with slender</p>

<p class="c" align="center">97</p>

<hr>
<p class="l">maiden arms and meet him with timid maiden lips. But his
love was not like that. He loved the very thing in hei that he could
not win, loved this neck with its warm, flower-like whiteness
gleaming with a dew of gold under the dusky sky. He sobbed with
yearning passion and wrung his hands with impotent desire, threw his
arms around a tree, leaned his cheek against the bark, and wept.</p>

<p class="c" align="center">98</p>

<hr>
<h2 class="c" align="center">Chapter VIII</h2>

<p class="l">THERE was in Niels Lyhne's nature a lame
reflec-tiveness, child of an instinctive shrinking from decisive
action, grandchild of a subconscious sense that he lacked
personality. He was always struggling against this reflectiveness,
sometimes goading himself by calling it vile names, then again
decking it out as a virtue that was a part of his inmost self and was
bound up with all his possibilities and powers. But whatever he made
of it, and however he looked upon it, he hated it as a secret
infirmity, which he might perhaps hide from the world, but never from
himself; it was always there to humiliate him whenever he was alone
with himself. How he envied the audacity that rushes confidently into
words, never heeding that words bring actions, and actions bring
consequences--until those consequences are at its heels. People who
possessed it always seemed to him like centaurs--man and horse cast
in a single mould. With them impulse and leap were one, whereas he
was divided into rider and horse--impulse one thing, leap something
very different.</p>

<p>Whenever he pictured himself declaring his love for Mrs. Boye--and
he always had to picture everything--he could plainly see himself in
the scene, his attitude, his</p>

<p class="c" align="center">99</p>

<hr>
<p class="l">every motion, his whole figure from the front, from the
side, and from the back. He could see himself falter with the
feverish irresolution that robbed him of his presence of mind and
paralyzed him, while he stood there awaiting her answer as if it were
a blow forcing him to his knees, instead of a shuttlecock to be
thrown back in ever so many ways and returned in as many more.</p>

<p>He thought of speaking, and he thought of writing, but he never
managed simply to blurt it out. It was only in veiled declarations
and in a half-feigned lyric passion that made a pose of being carried
away into hot words and fantastic hopes. Nevertheless, a certain
intimacy of a strange kind grew up between them, born of a youth's
humble love, a dreamer's ardent longing, and a woman's pleasure in
being the inaccessible object of romantic desire. Their relation took
the form of a myth that arose, neither of them knew how, a pale,
still myth bred in a drawing room. Its heroine was a fair woman who
had loved in her early youth one of the great men in the world of
thought. He had gone away to die in a strange land, forgotten and
forsaken. And the fair woman sat sorrowing for many long years,
though none knew her suffering; solitude alone was sacred enough to
look upon her grief. Then came a youth who called the departed great
one master, who was filled with his spirit and enthusiastic for his
work. And he loved the sorrowing woman. To her it seemed that the
dead happy days rose from their grave and came to life again. A
sweet, strange bewilderment came over her; past and present were
blurred in the silvery mist of a shadowy dream-day, in which she
loved the youth, partly as himself and partly as the image of
another, and gave him the half of her soul. But he must tread softly,
lest the dream-bubble</p>

<p class="c" align="center">100</p>

<hr>
<p class="l">should burst; he must put a stern bar to all hot earthly
longings, lest they should dispel the tender twilight and wake her to
sorrow again.</p>

<p>Sheltered by this myth, their intimacy gradually took on a stable
form. They called each other by their Christian names and were Niels
and Tema to each other when they were alone, while the presence of
the niece was reduced to a minimum. To be sure, Niels sometimes tried
to break through the accepted barriers, but Mrs. Boye was so much the
stronger that she could easily and gently quell all such attempts at
insubordination, and Niels had to submit and fall back for a time on
this fanciful passion with real tableaux. Their relation never ran
out into a platonic flatness; nor did it sink to rest in the monotony
of habit. Rest was the word that least of all described it. Niels
Lyhne's hope was never weary, and though it was gently suppressed
whenever it would flare up in a demand, that only made it smolder
more hotly than ever in secret. And how Mrs. Boye would feed the fire
by her thousand and one coquetries, her provocative simplicity, and
her naked courage in discussing the most delicate subjects! Besides,
the game was not entirely in her hands, for there were times when her
blood would dream in its idleness of rewarding this half-tamed
devotion by lavishing on it the fullest rapture of love in order to
rejoice in its wondering happiness. But such a dream was not easily
extinguished, and the next time Niels came she would meet him with
the nervousness of conscious sin, a shyness born of wrongdoing, a
sweet shame that made the air strangely tremulous with passion.</p>

<p>There was yet another thing that gave their intimacy a certain
tension. Niels Lyhne's love possessed so much virility that he
chivalrously held himself back from tak-</p>

<p class="c" align="center">101</p>

<hr>
<p class="l">ing in imagination what the reality denied him, and even
in that separate world where everything did his bidding he respected
Mrs. Boye as if she were actually present.</p>

<p>Hence their relation was well buttressed from both sides, and
there was no immediate danger that it would fall to pieces. Indeed,
it seemed made for a nature at once brooding and athirst for life
such as Niels Lyhne's, and though it was only a game, it was a game
of realities, sufficient to give him that undercurrent of passion
which he needed.</p>

<p>Niels Lyhne was bent upon being a poet, and there was much in the
external circumstances of his life to lead his thoughts in that
direction and stimulate his faculties for the task. So far, however,
he had little but his dreams to write about, and nowhere is there
more sameness and monotony than in the world of imagination; for in
that dreamland, which seems so boundless and so infinitely varied,
there are, in fact, only a few short beaten paths where everybody
walks and from which no one ever strays. People may differ, but in
their dreams they do not differ; there they always attain the three
or four things that they desire--it may be with more or less speed
and completeness, but they always attain them in the end. No one
seriously dreams of himself as empty-handed. Therefore no one ever
discovers himself in his dreams or becomes conscious through them of
his individuality. Our dreams tell nothing of how we are satisfied
when we win the treasure, how we relinquish it when lost, how we
feast on it while it is ours, where we turn when it is taken from
us.</p>

<p>Niels Lyhne's poetry had hitherto been nothing but the expression
of an esthetic personality which, in a general way, found spring
teeming, the ocean wide, love erotic,</p>

<p class="c" align="center">102</p>

<hr>
<p class="l">and death melancholy. He himself was not in his poems;
he merely put the verses together. But now a change came over him.
Now that he wooed a woman and wanted her to love him--him, Niels
Lyhne of L&ouml;nborggaard, who was twenty-three years old, walked
with a slight stoop, had beautiful hands and small ears, and was a
little timid, wanted her to love him and not the idealized Nicolaus
of his dreams, who had a proud bearing and confident manners, and was
a little older--now he began to take a vital interest in this Niels
whom he had hitherto walked about with as a slightly unpresentable
friend. He had been so busy decking himself with the qualities he
lacked that he had not had time to take note of those he possessed,
but now he began to piece his own self together from scattered
memories and impressions of his childhood and from the most vivid
moments of his life. He saw with pleased surprise how it all fitted
together, bit by bit, and was welded into a much more familiar
personality than the one he had chased after in his dreams. This
figure was far more genuine, far stronger, and more richly endowed.
It was no mere dead stump of an ideal, but a living thing, full of
infinite shifting possibilities playing through it and shaping it to
a thousandfold unity. Good God, he <i>had</i> powers that could be
used just as they were! He <i>was</i> Aladdin, and there was not a
thing he had been storming the clouds for but it had fallen right
down into his turban.</p>

<p>Now came a happy time for Niels, the glorious time when the mighty
impulse of growth sweeps us jubilantly past the dead points in our
own nature; when we are filled to bursting with a strength that makes
us eager to put our shoulders to mountains if need be, while we build
away bravely on the Tower of Babel, which is meant to</p>

<p class="c" align="center">103</p>

<hr>
<p class="l">pierce the sky, but ends in being just a squatty
structure that we go on all our lives adding to--now a timid spire,
now a freakish bay window.</p>

<p>Everything was changed; his nature, his faculties, and his work
fitted into one another like cogged wheels. He could never think of
stopping to rejoice in his art, for a thing was no sooner finished
than it was cast aside; he had outgrown it even while he worked on
it, and it became a mere step that led upward to an ever-receding
goal, one of many steps on a road he had left behind him and
forgotten even while it resounded with his footfall.</p>

<p>While he felt himself borne along by new impulses and new thoughts
to greater power and wider vision, he grew more and more solitary.
One after another of his old friends and comrades fell back and
vanished from his ken, for he lost interest in them when he saw less
and less difference between these men of the opposition and that
majority which they attacked. Everything seemed to him to melt
together in one great hostile mass of boredom. What did they write
when they gave the call to battle? Pessimistic verses in which they
declared that dogs were often more faithful than men and jailbirds
more honest than those who walked freely about, eloquent odes to the
effect that green woods and brown heath were preferable to dusty
cities, stories of peasant virtue and rich men's vice, of red-blooded
nature and anemic civilization, the narrowness of age and the divine
right of youth. What modest demands they made when they wrote! They
were at least bolder when they talked within four safe walls.</p>

<p>No, when his time came, he would give them music--a clarion
call!</p>

<p class="c" align="center">104</p>

<hr>
<p>His older friendships suffered too, especially that with Frithjof.
The fact was that Frithjof, who had a very positive nature, a good
head for systems, and a broad back for dogmas, had read a little too
much Heiberg, and had taken it all for gospel truth, never suspecting
that the makers of systems are clever folk who fashion their systems
from their books and not their books from their systems. It is a
well-known fact that young people who have committed themselves to a
system generally become great dogmatists, because of the praiseworthy
affection youth often bears to what is finished and finite. And when
you have become the possessor of the whole truth, it would be
unpardonable to keep it for yourself alone and to allow less
fortunate fellow creatures to go their own misguided way, instead of
leading and instructing them, pruning away their wild shoots with
loving severity, forcing them up against the wall with gentle
coercion, and pointing out to them the lines along which they must
grow, in order that they may sometime, when they have been formed
into correct and artistic espaliers, thank you, even if tardily, for
the trouble you have taken.</p>

<p>Niels was fond of saying that he liked nothing better than
criticism, but the truth was that he preferred admiration, and he
certainly would not brook criticism from Frithjof, whom he had always
regarded as his serf, and who had always been delighted to wear the
livery of his opinions and his principles. And here he was trying to
play the equal and to masquerade in a self-chosen mantle! Of course
he must be snubbed, and Niels first tried, in a tone of good-natured
superiority, to make Frithjof ridiculous in his own eyes, but when
that would not work he had recourse to insolent paradoxes, which</p>

<p class="c" align="center">105</p>

<hr>
<p class="l">he would scorn to discuss, simply throwing them out in
all their grotesque hideousness and then retiring behind a teasing
silence.</p>

<p>In this way, they grew apart.</p>

<p>With Erik he got on better. Their boyish friendship had always
kept a certain reserve, a kind of spiritual modesty, and this had
saved them from the too great familiarity that is so dangerous to
friendship. They had been enthusiastic together in the festival hall
of their souls and had chatted intimately in the drawing room, but
they had never made free with each other's bedrooms, bathrooms, and
other private places in the mansion of their souls.</p>

<p>It was the same now; indeed, the reserve was, if anything,
stricter, at least on Niels's part, but that did not lessen their
friendship, the cornerstone of which, now as of old, was Niels
Lyhne's admiration for Erik's spirit and audacity, his way of seeming
at home with life, and his readiness to grasp and hold. Yet Niels
could not conceal from himself that the friendship was extremely
onesided. Not that Erik was wanting in real affection or faith in
him--far from it. No one could think more highly of Niels than Erik
did; he considered him so vastly his own superior in intellect that
he never dreamed of criticizing, but this blind admiration led him to
place Niels and his work and interests too far beyond the horizon his
own eyes could scan. He was sure that Niels would go far along the
road he had chosen, but he was equally sure that his own feet had
nothing to do on that path, nor did he ever attempt to set them
there.</p>

<p>Niels felt that this was rather hard; for though Erik's ideals
were not his, and though Erik in his art tried to express a
romanticism or a romantic sentimentalism with</p>

<p class="c" align="center">106</p>

<hr>
<p class="l">which he was not in accord, he could still feel a
broader sympathy by virtue of which he faithfully followed his
friend's development, rejoiced with him when he gained a step, and
helped him to hope when he stood still.</p>

<p>In this way their friendship was one-sided, and it was not strange
that Niels should have his eyes opened to the lack in it just at the
time when his own mind was struggling with new ideas, and he felt the
need of pouring out his thoughts to a sympathetic listener. It made
him bitter, and he began to examine more closely this friend whom he
had always judged so leniently. A dreary sense of loneliness came
over him as he realized how everything he had brought with him from
home and from the old days seemed to fall away from him and let him
go his own way, forgotten and forsaken. The door to the past was
barred, and he stood outside, empty-handed and alone; whatever he
needed and desired he must win for himself--new friends and new
shelter, new affections and new memories.</p>

<p class="c" align="center">* * * *</p>

<p>For more than a year Mrs. Boye had been Niels's only real
companion, when a letter from his mother, telling him that his father
was dangerously ill, called him back to L&ouml;nborggaard.</p>

<p>When he arrived, his father was dead.</p>

<p>The consciousness that for several years he had longed very little
for his home weighed on Niels almost like a crime. He had often
enough visited it in his thoughts, but always as a guest with the
dust of other lands on his clothes and the memories of other places
in his heart; he had never longed for it in passionate homesickness
as for the fair sanctuary of his life, nor pined to kiss its soil</p>

<p class="c" align="center">107</p>

<hr>
<p class="l">and rest under its roof. Now he repented that he had
been faithless to his home, and, oppressed as he was by his grief, he
felt his remorse darkened by a sense that in some mysterious way he
was an accessory to what had happened, as though his faithlessness
had called death in. He wondered how he could ever have lived
contentedly away from his home which now drew him with such strange
power. With every fiber of his being he clung to it, in an infinite
desolate longing, uneasy because he could not become one with it as
fully as he would, miserable because the thousand memories that
called from every corner and every bush, from sounds and myriad
scents, from the play of light and from the silence itself--because
all these things called with such distant voices that he could not
grasp them in the strength and fullness he craved; they seemed only
to whisper in his soul like the rustling of leaves that fall to the
ground and the lapping of waves that flow on and ever on. . . .</p>

<p>Happy in his sorrow is he who at the death of one dear to him can
weep all his tears over the emptiness, the desolation, and the
loneliness. Sorer and bitterer are the tears with which you try to
atone for the past when you have failed in love toward one who is
gone and to whom you can never make amends for what you have sinned.
For now they come back to you: not only the hard words, the subtly
poisoned retorts, the harsh censure, and the unreasoning anger, but
even unkind thoughts that were not put into words, hasty judgments
that merely passed through your mind, unseen shruggings of the
shoulder, and hidden smiles full of contempt and impatience, they all
come back like malign arrows, sinking their barb deep in your own
breast, their dull barb, for the point has been broken off in the
heart that is no more. There is nothing</p>

<p class="c" align="center">108</p>

<hr>
<p class="l">you can expiate any more, nothing. Now there is
abundance of love in your heart, now that it is too late. Go now to
the cold grave with your full heart! Does it bring you any nearer?
Plant flowers and bind wreaths--does that help you?</p>

<p>At Lonborggaard they were binding wreaths; there too, they were
haunted by memories of hours when love had been silenced by harsher
voices; to them, too, the stern lines about the closed mouth of the
grave spoke of remorse.</p>

<p>It was a dark, sad time, but it held a ray of light in that it
brought mother and son more closely together than they had been for
many, many years; for in spite of the great love they bore to each
other, they had always been, and were, on their guard each toward the
other, and there had been a certain reserve in their relationship,
from the time when Niels grew too large to sit on his mother's knee.
He had shrunk from the excitable and high-strung side of her nature,
while she had felt something alien in the timidity and hesitation of
his. But now life itself, which keys up and tones down and
harmonizes, had prepared their hearts, and would soon give them
wholly to each other.</p>

<p>Scarcely two months after the funeral, Mrs. Lyhne fell violently
ill, and for a long time her life was in danger. The anxiety that
filled these weeks seemed to force their earlier grief into the
background, and when Mrs. Lyhne began to get better, it seemed to
both her and Niels that years had been thrust in between them and the
freshly made grave. Especially to Mrs. Lyhne the time seemed long.
While she was ill she had been sure that she was going to die and had
been very much afraid of death. Even now that she had begun to
recover, and the doctor</p>

<p class="c" align="center">109</p>

<hr>
<p class="l">had declared the danger to be past, she could not rid
herself of her gloomy thoughts.</p>

<p>It was a dreary convalescence, in which her strength returned as
it seemed reluctantly, drop by drop. She felt no gentle and healing
drowsiness, but rather a restless languor with a depressing sense of
weakness and an incessant, impotent longing for strength.</p>

<p>After a while there was a change; her recovery was more rapid, and
her strength came back. Still the idea that she and life were soon to
part did not leave her, but lay like a shadow over her and held her
captive in a perturbed and yearning melancholy.</p>

<p>One evening she was sitting alone in the summer parlor, gazing out
through the wide-open doors. The trees of the garden hid the gold and
crimson of the sunset, but in one spot the trunks parted to reveal a
bit of fiery sky, from which a sunburst of long, deep golden rays
shot out, waking green tints and bronze-brown reflections in the dark
leafy masses.</p>

<p>High above the restless treetops, the clouds drifted dark against
a smoke-red sky, and as they hurried on, they left behind them little
loosened tufts, tiny strips of cloud which the sunlight steeped in a
wine-colored glow.</p>

<p>Mrs. Lyhne sat listening to the wind in the trees. Her head moved
very slightly in time with the uneven swelling and sinking of each
gust, as it came rushing, swept on boisterously, and died away. But
her eyes were far away, farther even than the clouds they gazed on.
Pale in her black widow's garb, she sat there with a piteous
expression of unrest about her faintly colored lips, while her hands
fidgeted with the thick little book on her lap. It was Rousseau's
<i>H&eacute;lo&iuml;se.</i> Other books were piled up</p>

<p class="c" align="center">110</p>

<hr>
<p class="l">around her: Schiller, Staffeldt, Evald, and Novalis, and
large portfolios with prints of old churches and ruins and mountain
lakes.</p>

<p>Now she heard doors opening and shutting, then steps that seemed
to seek some one in the inner rooms, and presently Niels came in. He
had been for a long walk by the fjord. His cheeks were ruddy from the
fresh air, and the wind was still in his hair.</p>

<p>Outside, the blue-gray colors had prevailed in the sky, and a few
heavy drops of rain splashed against the windows.</p>

<p>Niels told of how high the waves came rolling in and how they had
washed the seaweed up on the beach, and about what he had seen and
whom he had met. As he talked, he gathered up the books, closed the
doors to the garden, and fastened the windows. Then he sat down on
the low stool at his mother's feet, took her hand in his, and laid
his cheek on her knee.</p>

<p>It had grown quite black outside; the rain beat like hail and ran
in streams down casements and panes.</p>

<p>"Do you remember," said Niels after a long silence--"do you
remember how often we sat like this in the dusk and went out in
search of adventures, while father was talking to Jens Overseer in
his office, and Duysen was rattling the teacups in the dining room?
And when the lamp was brought in, we both woke up from our strange
adventures to the sheltered comfort around us, yet I can well
remember that I always thought the story did not stop when we did,
but went on unfolding somewhere under the hills on the way to
Ringkj&ouml;bing."</p>

<p>He did not see his mother's wistful smile, but he felt her hand
passing gently over his hair.</p>

<p>"Do you remember," she said after a while, "how often</p>

<p class="c" align="center">111</p>

<hr>
<p class="l">you promised me that when you grew up you would sail out
in a big ship and bring me back all the treasures of the world?"</p>

<p>"Do I remember! I was to bring hyacinths, because you loved
hyacinths so much, and a palm like the one that died, and pillars of
gold and marble. There were so many pillars in your stories, always.
Do you remember?"</p>

<p>"I have been waiting for that ship--no, sit still, dear, you don't
understand me--it was not for myself, it was the ship of your
fortune. ... I hoped your life would be full and glorious, that you
would travel on shining paths. . . . Fame--everything--No, not that,
if you would only be one of those who fight for the greatest. I don't
know how it is, but I am so tired of commonplace happiness and
commonplace goals. Do you understand me?"</p>

<p>"You wanted me to be a Sunday child, mother dear, one of those who
do not pull in harness with others, but have their own heaven to be
saved in, and their own place of damnation all to themselves,
too.--We wanted to have flowers on board, didn't we? Gorgeous flowers
to strew over a bleak world; but the ship did not come, and they were
poor birds, Niels and his mother, were they not?"</p>

<p>"Have I hurt you, dear? Why, it was nothing but dreams; don't mind
them!"</p>

<p>Niels was silent a long time, for he felt a shyness about what he
wanted to say. "Mother," he said, "we are not so poor as you think.
Some day the ship will come in.-- If you would only believe that and
believe in me. . . . Mother--I am a poet--really--through my whole
soul. Don't imagine this is childish dreams or dreams fed by vanity.
If you could feel my grateful pride in what's best in me--my humble
joy in saying this, so little personal, so</p>

<p class="c" align="center">112</p>

<hr>
<p class="l">far from vainglory, you would believe it just as I want
you to believe it. Dearest, dearest! I <i>shall</i> be one of those
who fight for the greatest, and I promise you that I shall not fail,
that I shall always be faithful to myself and my gift. Nothing but
the best shall be good enough. No compromise, mother! When I weigh
what I have done and feel that it isn't sterling, or when I hear that
it's got a crack or a flaw--into the melting pot it goes! Every
single work must be my best! Do you see why I have to promise? It's
my gratitude for my riches that drives me to make vows, and you must
receive them. Then if I fail, it will be a sin against you, for it's
all owing to you that my soul is like a high-vaulted room--your
dreams and longings have given me the impulse to growth, and your
sympathies and your unsatisfied thirst for beauty have consecrated me
to my lifework."</p>

<p>Mrs. Lyhne wept silently. She felt herself growing pale with
rapture. Softly she laid both hands on her son's head, but he drew
them gently to his lips and kissed them.</p>

<p>"You have made me so happy, Niels! Then my life has not been one
long, useless sigh, if I have helped to lead you on as I hoped and
dreamed so ardently--good heavens! how often I have dreamed it!--And
yet there is so much sadness mixed in my joy, Niels! To think that my
fondest wish should be fulfilled, the thing I have longed for so many
years. . . . Such things happen only when life is almost done."</p>

<p>"You mustn't talk like that, you mustn't! Why, everything is going
on well, and you are getting stronger every day, mother dear, are you
not?"</p>

<p>"It is so hard to die," she said under her breath. "Do you know
what I was thinking of in those long sleepless nights, when death
seemed so terribly near? I thought</p>

<p class="c" align="center">113</p>

<hr>
<p class="l">the bitterest of all was to know that there were so many
great and beautiful things out in the world which I should have to
leave behind without ever having seen them. I thought of the
thousands and thousands of souls they had lifted up and filled with
life and joy, while for me they had not existed. It seemed to me that
my soul would fly away poverty-stricken on feeble wings, without any
golden memories to carry with it as a reflection from the glories of
its homeland, because it had only been sitting in the chimney-corner
listening to stories about the wonderful world.--Niels, no one can
imagine what agony it is to lie imprisoned in a dull, dark sick room
and struggle, in your feverish fancies, to call up before you the
beauties of lands you have never seen--snowy Alpine peaks above
blue-black mountain lakes, and sparkling rivers between vine-clad
banks, and long lines of mountains with ruins peeping out of the
woods, and then lofty halls with marble gods--and never to get it
quite, but always to give up and start over again, because it seems
so terribly hard to leave it without having had the slightest part in
it. ... O God, Niels, to long for it with your whole soul, while you
feel that you are being slowly carried to the threshold of another
world, to stand on the threshold and look back with a long, long
gaze, while all the time you are being forced through that door where
none of your longings have gone before you. . . . Niels, take me
along in your thoughts, dear, when the time comes for you to share in
all that glory which I shall never, never see!"</p>

<p>She wept.</p>

<p>Niels tried to comfort her. He laid bold plans for the journey
they would take together as soon as she was quite well. He meant to
go to the city to consult a doctor, and</p>

<p class="c" align="center">114</p>

<hr>
<p class="l">he was sure the doctor would agree with him that it was
the best thing they could do; So-and-so had traveled and had
recovered from his illness completely, simply through the change; a
change often worked wonders. He began to trace their route in every
detail, spoke of how warmly he would wrap her up, what short trips
they would take at first, what a delightful journal they would keep,
how they would notice even the smallest trifles, how amusing it would
be to eat the queerest things in the loveliest spots, and what awful
sins against grammar they would commit in the beginning.</p>

<p>He went on in this strain all that evening and on the days that
followed, never wearying. She entered into his plan as into a
pleasant fancy, but she was plainly convinced that it would never
come to pass.</p>

<p>Nevertheless Niels, acting on the doctor's advice, went on making
all the necessary preparations for the trip, and she let him do as he
pleased, even fix the day of departure--sure that <i>that</i> would
happen which would bring all his plans to naught. But when, finally,
there were only a few days left, and when her youngest brother, who
was to manage the farm in their absence, had actually arrived, she
grew uncertain, and now it was she who was most eager to be off, for
there still lurked in her mind a fear that the obstacle would leap
out and stand in their way at the very last moment.</p>

<p>So they set off.</p>

<p>The first day she was still nervous and uneasy with a lingering
trace of her fear, and only when the day was happily ended could she
begin to grasp the fact that she was actually on her way to all the
glory she had longed for so sorely. Then a feverish joy came over
her; her every thought and word was colored by extravagant
anticipa-</p>

<p class="c" align="center">115</p>

<hr>
<p class="l">tion, and her thoughts circled unceasingly around what
the coming days would bring, one after the other.</p>

<p>And it all came to pass, all that she had hoped, but it did not
fill her with rapture nor carry her away with the power or the fervor
she had expected. She had imagined it all different, and had imagined
herself different, too. In dreams and poems everything had been, as
it were, beyond the sea; the haze of distance had mysteriously veiled
all the restless mass of details and had thrown out the large lines
in bold relief, while the silence of distance had lent its spirit of
enchantment. It had been easy then to feel the beauty; but now that
she was in the midst of it all, when every little feature stood out
and spoke boldly with the manifold voices of reality, and beauty was
shattered as light in a prism, she could not gather the rays together
again, could not put the picture back beyond the sea. Despondently
she was obliged to admit to herself that she felt poor, surrounded by
riches that she could not make her own.</p>

<p>She yearned to go on and ever on, still hoping to find a spot she
might recognize as a bit of the world she had dreamed, that world
which, with every step she took to approach it, seemed to extinguish
the magic glamor that had suffused it and to lie spread before her
disappointed eyes in the commonplace light of everybody's sun and
everybody's moon. But she sought in vain, and as the year was already
far advanced, they hastened to Clarens, where the doctor had advised
them to spend the winter, and where, moreover, a last faintly
gleaming hope lured the tired, dream-wrapped soul; for was it not the
Clarens of Rousseau, the Paradise of Julie!</p>

<p>There they remained, but it was of no avail that Winter made
himself gentle and held his cold breath from touch-</p>

<p class="c" align="center">116</p>

<hr>
<p class="l">ing her; against the fever in her blood he had no
healing. And Spring, when he came on his triumphal march through the
valley with the miracle of sprouting seeds and the gospel of budding
leaves, he too had to pass her by and let her stand withering in the
midst of all this exuberant renascence. The strength that welled out
to her from light and air and earth and water could not be
transformed to strength within her; it could not make her blood drunk
with health nor force it to sing exultantly in the great hymn to the
omnipotence of Spring. No, she could but wither, for the last dream
that had appeared before her in the dimness of her home as a new
reddening dawn, the dream of the glories of the distant world, had
not been followed by day. Its colors seemed paler the nearer she
came, and she felt that they were pale to her because she had longed
for colors that life does not hold and for a beauty that earth cannot
ripen. But her longing was not quenched; silent and strong it burned
in her heart, hotter in its unstilled thirst, hot and consuming.
Round about her, Spring celebrated his feast pregnant with beauty.
Snowdrops rang it in with their white bells, and crocuses welcomed it
joyfully holding up their veined chalices. Hundreds of tiny mountain
streams tumbled headlong down into the valley to report that Spring
had come, but they were all too late, for when they trickled between
green banks, primroses in yellow and violets in blue stood there and
nodded: We know it, we know it; we knew it before you! The willows
unfurled their yellow banners, and the curly ferns and the velvety
moss hung green garlands over the naked walls of the vineyards, while
down below dry nettles hid the stones with long borders of brown and
green and faint purple. The grass spread its mantle of green far and
wide, and no</p>

<p class="c" align="center">117</p>

<hr>
<p class="l">end of pretty flowers sat down upon it: there were
hyacinths with blossoms like stars and blossoms like pearls, legions
of daisies, gentians, anemones, dandelions, with a hundred others.
And high above this bloom on the ground there floated in the air,
borne up by the hoary trunks of aged cherry trees, a thousand shining
flower islands, where the light foamed against white shores dotted by
blue and red butterflies bringing a message from the flower continent
below.</p>

<p>Every day brought new flowers, forcing them out of the ground in
motley patterns in the gardens by the sea, pouring them out over the
branches of the trees down there--paullinias like giant violets and
magnolias like huge purple-stained tulips. Along the paths the
flowers advanced in blue and white phalanxes. They filled the meadows
with yellow swarms, but nowhere was there such a maze of bloom as in
the little sheltered valleys up among the hills, where the larch
stood with glittering ruby cones amidst pale green needles, for there
the narcissus blossomed in dazzling myriads, filling the air far and
wide with the drowsy fragrance from their white orgies.</p>

<p>With all this beauty round about her, she still sat there with the
old unanswered longing for beauty in her heart. It was only now and
then, when the sun sank behind the gentle slopes of Savoy, and the
mountains beyond the sea seemed made of brown opaque glass, as if
their precipitous sides had drunk the light, that nature could hold
her senses spellbound. Then, when the bright yellow mists of evening
veiled the distant Jura Mountains, and the lake, like a copper mirror
from which tongues of golden flame shot into the red sunset glow,
seemed to melt with the sky into one vast, shining infinity--then</p>

<p class="c" align="center">118</p>

<hr>
<p class="l">it would seem, once in a great while, as though the
longing were silenced, and the soul had found the land it sought.</p>

<p>As spring advanced, her strength failed more and more. Soon she
did not leave her bed, but she was no longer afraid of death; she
awaited it eagerly, for she cherished the hope that beyond the grave
she would be face to face with all the glory, be one in soul with the
fullness of beauty which here on earth had drawn her in hope and
yearning--a yearning which had been clarified and transfigured by the
increasing pain of long empty years and thus prepared to attain its
goal. She dreamed many a gentle, wistful dream of how she would
return in memory to what earth had given her, return from the land of
immortality, where all the beauty of the earth would be always beyond
the sea.</p>

<p>So she died, and Niels buried her in the friendly churchyard at
Clarens, where the brown vineyard mould covers the children of so
many lands, and where broken columns and veiled urns repeat the same
words of mourning in so many languages.</p>

<p>They gleam white under dark cypresses and among the winter bloom
of the viburnum; early roses strew their petals over many of them,
and often the ground at their base is blue with violets, but over
every mound and every stone creep the glossy-leaved vines of the
gentle periwinkle, Rousseau's favorite flower, sky blue as never a
sky was blue.</p>

<h2 class="c" align="center">Chapter IX</h2>

<p class="l">NIELS LYHNE hurried home. He could not bear his
loneliess among so many strangers, but the nearer he came to
Copenhagen, the oftener he asked himself what he wanted there, and
the more he regretted that he had not stayed abroad. For whom did he
have in Copenhagen? Not Frithjof, and Erik was traveling in Italy on
a scholarship, so he was not there. Mrs. Boye? It was a queer affair,
this relation with Mrs. Boye. Now that he came straight from his
mother's grave, it seemed to him, not exactly a desecration or
anything like that, and yet out of tune with the key in which his
present moods were pitched. It was discord. If he had been going to
meet his fiancee, his young blushing bride, now that his soul had so
long been bent on filial duties, it would not have conflicted with
his feeling. It was of no use that he tried to take a superior tone
with himself and call the change in his conception of his intimacy
with Mrs. Boye Philistine and provincial. The word "Bohemian" formed
itself subconsciously as an expression of a distaste that he could
not reason away, and it was in line with this mood that his first
visit, after he had engaged his old rooms at the embankment, was to
the Neergaards and not to Mrs. Boye.</p>

<p class="c" align="center">120</p>

<hr>
<p>The following day he called on her, but did not find her in. The
janitor said she had taken a villa at Emilie-kilde, which surprised
Niels, for he knew that her father's country house was in that
neighborhood.</p>

<p>Well, he would have to go out there in a day or two.</p>

<p>But the very next day he received a note from Mrs. Boye asking him
to meet her in her apartment in town. The pale niece had seen him in
the street. A quarter before one he was to come--he <i>must</i> come.
She would tell him why, <i>if he did not know it.</i> Did he know it?
He must not misjudge her, and not be unreasonable. He knew her too
well, and why should he take it as a plebeian nature would? He must
not--please! After all, they were not like other people. Oh, if he
only <i>would</i> understand her! Niels, Niels!</p>

<p>This letter made him strangely excited, and he suddenly remembered
with a sense of uneasiness that Mrs. Neergaard had looked at him with
a sarcastic pitying expression and had smiled and said nothing in a
curious meaning way. What could it be? What in the world could have
happened?</p>

<p>The mood that had kept him away from Mrs. Boye had vanished so
completely that he could not understand how he had ever felt it. He
was alarmed. If they had only written to each other like sensible
people! <i>Why</i> had they not written? He certainly had not been so
busy. It was queer how he would allow himself to be so absorbed in
the place where he happend to be that he forgot what was far away, or
if he did not forget it, at least pushed it into the distant
background, where it was buried by the present--as under mountains.
No one would think he had imagination.</p>

<p>At last! Mrs. Boye herself opened the door to the ante-</p>

<p class="c" align="center">121</p>

<hr>
<p class="l">room before he had time to ring. She said nothing, but
gave him her hand in a long, sympathetic clasp; the newspapers had
announced his bereavement. Niels said nothing either, and so they
walked silently through the parlor, between the two rows of chairs in
red-striped covers. The chandelier was wrapped in paper, and the
windowpanes were whitened. In the sitting room everything was as
usual, except that the Venetian blinds were rolled down before the
opened windows, and as they moved to and fro in the slight breeze,
they struck the casement with a faint, monotonous tapping. Rays of
light reflected from the sunlit canal outside filtered in between the
yellow slats and made squares of tremulous wavy lines in the ceiling,
which quivered with the rippling of the wave outside. Otherwise all
was hushed and still, silently waiting with bated breath. . . .</p>

<p>Mrs. Boye could not make up her mind where she wanted to sit;
finally she decided on the rocking chair, and dusted it assiduously
with her handkerchief, but instead of sitting down she stood behind
the chair, resting her hands on its back. She still wore her gloves
and had only drawn one arm out of her half-fitting black mantilla.
Her dress was of silk tartan in a very tiny check matching the broad
ribbons on the wide, round Pamela hat of light straw which half hid
her face as she stood looking down and rocking the chair
nervously.</p>

<p>Niels seated himself on the piano stool at a distance from her, as
if he expected something unpleasant.</p>

<p>"Then you know it, Niels?"</p>

<p>"No, but what is it I don't know?"</p>

<p>The chair stopped. "I am engaged."</p>

<p>"Are you engaged? But how--why--Mrs. Boye?"</p>

<p>"Oh, don't call me Mrs. Boye, and don't begin to be</p>

<p class="c" align="center">122</p>

<hr>
<p class="l">unreasonable right away!" She leaned against the back of
the rocking chair with a little air of defiance. "Surely you can
understand that it isn't the pleasantest thing in the world for me to
stand here and explain to you. I will do it, but you might at least
help me."</p>

<p>"What do you mean? Are you engaged, or are you not?"</p>

<p>"I have just told you that I am," she replied with gentle
impatience, looking up.</p>

<p>"Then may I be allowed to wish you joy, Mrs. Boye, and to thank
you very much for the time we have known each other." He had risen to
his feet and bowed sarcastically several times.</p>

<p>"And you can part from me like this, quite calmly? I am engaged,
and then we are done, and everything that has been between us two is
just a stupid old story which mustn't be brought to mind any more.
Past is past, and that is all--Niels, all the precious days--will the
memory of them be silent from now on? Will you never, never think of
me, never miss me? Won't you call the dream forth again, on many a
quiet evening, and give it the colors it might have glowed with? Can
you keep from loving it all back to life again in your thoughts and
ripening it to the fullness it might have had? Can you? Can you put
your foot on it and crush it all out of existence, every bit of it?
Niels!"</p>

<p>"I hope so; you have shown me that it can be done.-- But this is
nonsense, pure, unmitigated nonsense from the beginning to end. Why
did you arrange this comedy? I have no shadow of a right to reproach
you. You have never loved me, never said that you loved me. You have
given me leave to love you, that is all, and now you withdraw your
permission. Or perhaps you will allow me to go on, though you have
given yourself to another? I don't</p>

<p class="c" align="center">123</p>

<hr>
<p class="l">understand you, if you can imagine that to be possible.
We are not children. Or are you afraid I shall forget you too soon?
Never fear. You are not one to be blotted easily out of a man's life.
But take care! A love like mine does not come to a woman twice in her
life; take care that you do not bring misfortune upon yourself by
casting me off! I don't wish you any harm, no, no! May you never know
want and sickness, and may you have all the happiness that comes with
wealth, admiration, and social success, in measure full and
overflowing, that is my wish for you. May all the world stand open to
you, all but one little door, one single little door, however much
you knock and try to open it--but otherwise everything as fully and
widely as it is possible to wish it."</p>

<p>He spoke slowly, almost sadly, not bitterly, but with a strangely
tremulous note in his voice, a note that was new to her and moved
her. She had grown a little pale and stood leaning stiffly against
the chair. "Niels," she said, "don't predict misfortune! Remember you
were not here. Niels, and my love--I did not know now real it was; it
seemed more like something that just interested me. It breathed
through my life like a delicate spiritual poem, it never caught me in
strong arms; it had wings--only wings. At least I thought so, I did
not know better until now, or until the moment I had done it--said
Yes and all that. Everything was so difficult, there were so many
things all at once and so many people to consider. ... It began with
my brother, Hardenskjold, the one who was in the West Indies, you
know. He had been rather wild when he was here, but over there he
settled down and became so sensible and went into partnership with
some one and made a lot of money, and married a rich widow, a sweet
little thing, I assure you, and he and father made</p>

<p class="c" align="center">124</p>

<hr>
<p class="l">up, for Hardie was so changed, oh, he is so respectable
there is no end to it, and so susceptible to what people
say--terribly bourgeois, oh! Of course, he thought I ought to be
taken up in the bosom of the family again, and every time he came
here he lectured me and pleaded and palavered, and you see, father is
an old man now, and so at last I did it, and everything was just as
in the old days."</p>

<p>She paused for a moment and began to take off first her mantilla
and then her hat and gloves, and, busy with all this, she turned a
little away from Niels, while she went on talking.</p>

<p>"And then Hardie had a friend who is very highly respected--oh,
extremely so, and they all thought I ought to do it and wished it so
much, and then you see I could take my position in society just as
before, or really better than before, because he is so very highly
respected in every way, and after all that is what I have been
wishing for a long time. I suppose you can't understand that? You
would never have thought it of me? Quite the contrary. Because I was
always making fun of conventional society with its banalities and its
stereotyped morality, its thermometer of virtue and its compass of
womanliness--you remember how witty we were! It is to weep, Niels,
for it wasn't true, at least not all the time. I will tell you
something: we women can break away for a while, when something in our
lives has opened our eyes to the love of freedom that after all is in
us, but we can't keep it up. It is in our blood, this passion for the
quintessence of propriety and the pinnacle of gentility up to its
most punctilious point. We can't bear to be at war with the
established order that is accepted by all commonplace people. In our
inmost selves we really think these people are right, because they
are the ones that sit in judgment,</p>

<p class="c" align="center">125</p>

<hr>
<p class="l">and in our hearts we bow to their judgments and suffer
from them, no matter how brave a face we wear. It is not natural for
us women to be exceptional, not really, Niels, it makes us so queer,
more interesting, perhaps, but still--Can you understand it? It is
silly, don't you think so? But at least you can comprehend that it
made a strange impression on me to return to the old surroundings. So
many things came back to me, memories of my mother and of her
standards. It seemed as though I had come into a safe haven again;
everything was so peaceful and well ordered, and I had only to bind
myself to it to be properly happy ever after. And so I let them bind
me, Niels."</p>

<p>Niels could not help smiling; he felt so superior, and was so
sorry for her, as she stood there, girlishly unhappy in the midst of
all this confession. He was softened and could not find any hard
words.</p>

<p>He went over to her.</p>

<p>Meanwhile she had turned the chair toward her and had sunk down on
it, and now she was sitting there quite forlorn and pathetic, leaning
back with arms hanging and face lifted, gazing out under lowered
eyelids through the darkened parlor with its two rows of chairs into
the dim anteroom.</p>

<p>Niels laid his arm along the back of the chair and rested his hand
on its arm, as he bent over her. "And you had quite forgotten--me?"
he whispered.</p>

<p>She seemed not to hear him and did not even lift her eyes, but at
last she shook her head, very faintly, and, after another long pause,
shook it again, very faintly.</p>

<p>Round about them everything was very still at first. Then a maid
came clattering along the halls and singing, as she polished the door
locks; the noise of the knobs</p>

<p class="c" align="center">126</p>

<hr>
<p class="l">turning cut brutally into the silence and made it seem
deeper than before when it suddenly came back. After a while, nothing
was heard except the drowsy, monotonous tapping of the blinds.</p>

<p>The silence seemed to rob them of the power of speech, almost of
thought. She sat as before with her eyes fixed on the dim anteroom,
while he remained standing, bending over her, gazing at the pattern
of her silk dress, and, unconsciously, lured by the enveloping
stillness, he began to rock her in the
chair--very--softly--very--softly. . . .</p>

<p>She lifted her eyelids for a look at his shadowed profile, and
lowered them again in quiet content. It was like a long embrace; it
was as though she gave herself into his arms when the chair went
back, and when it swung forward again, and her feet touched the
floor, there was something of him in the pressure of the boards
against her foot. He felt it too; the process began to interest him,
and he rocked more and more vigorously. It was as though he came
nearer and nearer to taking her as he drew the chair farther back;
there was anticipation in the instant when it was about to plunge
forward again, and when it came down there was a strange satisfaction
in the soft tap of her passive feet against the floor; then when he
pushed it down yet a little farther there was complete possession in
the action which pressed her sole gently against the floor and forced
her to raise her knee ever so slightly.</p>

<p>"Let us not dream!" said Niels at last with a sigh and
relinquished the chair.</p>

<p>"Yes, let us!" she said almost pleadingly, and looked innocently
at him with great wistful eyes.</p>

<p>She had risen slowly.</p>

<p>"No dreams!" said Niels nervously, putting his arm</p>

<p class="c" align="center">127</p>

<hr>
<p class="l">around her waist. "Too many dreams have passed between
you and me. Have you never felt them? Have they never touched you
like a light breath caressing your cheek or stirring your hair? Is it
possible that the night has never been tremulous with sigh upon sigh
that dropped and died on your lips?"</p>

<p>He kissed her, and it seemed to him that she grew less young under
his kisses, less young, but lovelier, more glowing in her beauty,
more alluring.</p>

<p>"I want you to know it," he said. "You don't know how I love you,
how I have suffered and longed. Oh, if those rooms at the embankment
could speak, Tema!"</p>

<p>He kissed her again and again, and she threw her arms around his
neck with such abandon that her wild silk sleeves fell back above the
billowing lace of the white undersleeves, above the gray elastic that
held them together over the elbow.</p>

<p>"What could those rooms say, Niels?"</p>

<p>"Tema, they could say, ten thousand times and more; they could
pray in that name, rage in that name, sigh and sob in it; they could
threaten Tema, too."</p>

<p>"Could they?"</p>

<p>From the street below came a conversation floating in through the
open window complete and unabridged, the most commonplace worldly
wisdom drawled in shopworn phrases, welded together by two
untemperamen-tal, gossipy voices. All this prose made it more
wonderful yet to stand there, heart to heart, sheltered in the soft,
dim light.</p>

<p>"How I love you, sweetheart, sweetheart--in my arms you are so
dear! are you so dear, so dear? And your hair--I can hardly speak,
and all my memories--so dear-all my memories of how I cried and was
wretched and</p>

<p class="c" align="center">128</p>

<hr>
<p class="l">longed so miserably, they press on and force their way
in as if they too would be happy with me in my happiness--do you
understand?--Do you remember, Tema, the moonlight last year? Are you
fond of it?--Oh, you don't know how cruel it can be. Such a clear
moonlight night, when the air seems to have stiffened in cold light,
and the clouds lie there in long layers--Tema, flowers and leaves
hold their fragrance so close around them it is like a frost of
scents covering them, and all sounds seem so far away and die so
suddenly and do not linger at all--Such a night is so merciless, for
it makes longing grow so strangely intense; the silence draws it out
from every corner of your soul, sucks it out with hard lips, and
there is no glimmering hope, no slumbering promise in all that
clearness. Oh, how I cried, Tema! Tema, have you never cried through
a moonlight night? Sweetheart, it would be a shame if you should cry;
you shall never cry, there shall always be sunshine for you and
nights of roses--a night of roses--"</p>

<p>She had given herself entirely to his embrace, and with her gaze
lost in his, her lips murmured strangely sweet words of love, half
muted by her breath, words repeated after him, as if she were
whispering them to her own heart.</p>

<p>The cessation of the voices in the street made her stir
restlessly. Then they came back to the firm, rhythmic accompaniment
of a cane striking against the cobblestones, crossed over to the
other side, lingered long in the distance, sank to a murmur--died
away.</p>

<p>And the silence again welled up around them, flamed up around
them, throbbing with heartbeats, heavy with breath, yielding. Speech
had been seared away between them, and lingering kisses fell from
their lips fraught</p>

<p class="c" align="center">129</p>

<hr>
<p class="l">with unspoken questions, but giving no solace nor any
present bliss. They held each other's gaze and dared not take their
eyes away, but neither did they dare to put meaning into their look;
they veiled it rather; withdrew behind it, silently hiding, brooding
over secret dreams.</p>

<p>A quiver passed through his clasping arms and woke her. She thrust
him from her with both hands and set herself free.</p>

<p>"Go, Niels, go! You must not be here, you must not. Do you
hear?"</p>

<p>He tried to draw her to him again, but she broke away, wild and
pale. She was trembling from head to foot and stood holding her arms
out from her body as if she were afraid to touch herself.</p>

<p>Niels would have knelt and caught her hand.</p>

<p>"Don't touch me!" There was desperation in her look. "Why don't
you go when I am begging you to? Good heavens, why can't you go? No,
no, don't speak to me, go away, you--Can't you see I am shaking
before you? Look! Oh, it's wicked the way you are treating me! And
when I am begging you to go!"</p>

<p>It was impossible to say a word; she would not listen. She was
quite beside herself. Tears streamed from her eyes; her face was
almost distorted and seemed to give out light in its pallor.</p>

<p>"Oh, do go! Can't you see that you are humiliating me by staying?
You are brutal to me, that's what you are! What have I done to you
that you ill-treat me this way? Do go! Have you no pity?"</p>

<p>Pity? He was cold with rage. This was madness! Still he could do
nothing but go, and he went. He did not like the two rows of chairs,
but he walked slowly be-</p>

<p class="c" align="center">130</p>

<hr>
<p class="l">tween them, looking at them with a fixed gaze of
defiance.</p>

<p>"Exit Niels Lyhne," he said, when he heard the latch of the
hall-door click behind him.</p>

<p>He walked down the steps thoughtfully, his hat in his hand. On the
landing he stopped and gesticulated to himself: If he could
understand the least bit! Why <i>this</i> and why, again,
<i>that?</i> Then he walked on. There were the open windows. He felt
like tearing to pieces that sickly sweet silence up there with a
shrill cry. He felt like talking to some one for
hours--mercilessly-talking nonsense into that silence, washing it
cold in nonsense. He could not get it out of his blood; he could see
it, taste it; he walked in it. Suddenly he stopped and blushed fiery
red with angry shame. Had she used him to tempt herself with?</p>

<p>In the room above, Mrs. Boye still was weeping. She had gone over
to the pier glass and stood resting both hands on the console,
weeping till the tears dripped from her cheeks down into the pink
chamber of a huge sea shell lying there. She looked at her distorted
face as it appeared above the misty spot her breath had formed on the
mirror, and traced the course of her tears as they welled out over
the rim of the eyes and rolled down. Where did they all come from?
She had never cried like this before--yes, once, in Frascati, after a
runaway.</p>

<p>Presently the tears began to come more sparingly, but a nervous
trembling still shook her spasmodically from neck to heel.</p>

<p>The sun now beat directly on the windows. The tremulous
reflections from the waves were drawn aslant</p>

<p class="c" align="center">131</p>

<hr>
<p class="l">under the ceiling, and on the sides of the Venetian
blinds the parallel rays fell in rows, forming perfect shelves of
yellow light. The heat increased, and mingling with the ripe smell of
hot wood and sun-warmed dust, other scents floated out from the
bright flowers of the sofa cushions, from the silken curves of the
chair backs, from books and folded rugs, where the heat released
<i>a</i> hundred forgotten perfumes and wafted them through the air,
light as wraiths.</p>

<p>Very slowly her trembling subsided, leaving a curious dizziness,
in which fantastic emotions that were more than half sensations
whirled around on the track of her wondering thoughts. She closed her
eyes, but remained standing with her face turned to the mirror.</p>

<p>Strange how it had come over her, this piercing terror! Had she
cried out? There was the echo of a scream in her ears and a tired
feeling in her throat as if she had emitted a long, anguished cry. If
he had taken her! She allowed herself to be taken and pressed her
arms against her heart as if to ward him off. She struggled, but
yet--now: she felt as if she were sinking with shame, impudently
caressed by all the winds of heaven--He would not go, and it would
soon be too late; all her strength was leaving her like bubbles that
burst; bubble after bubble forced its way between her lips and burst
unceasingly; in another second it would be too late! Had she begged
him on her knees? Too late! She was lifted irresistibly to his
embrace, as a bubble that rises through the water--tremulous, so her
soul rose up naked before him, with every wish bared to his gaze,
every secret dream, hidden surrender unveiled before his mastering
eye. Again in his arms, lingering, sweetly trembling. There was a
statue of alabaster</p>

<p class="c" align="center">132</p>

<hr>
<p class="l">surrounded by flames; it glowed transparent in the heat
of the fire; little by little its dark center melted, until all was
luminous light.</p>

<p>Slowly she opened her eyes and looked at her image in the mirror
with a discreet smile as at a fellow conspirator before whom she did
not wish to commit herself too fully. Then she went around the room
gathering together her gloves, hat, and mantilla.</p>

<p>Her dizziness seemed blown away, leaving only a rather pleasant
sense of weakness in her knees. She walked about to feel it better.
Secretly, as if by accident, she gave the rocking chair a
confidential little push with her elbow.</p>

<p>She rather liked scenes.</p>

<p>With one look she said farewell to some invisible thing. Then she
rolled up the blinds, and it seemed like another room.</p>

<p><br>
</p>

<p>Three weeks later Mrs. Boye was married, and Niels Lyhne was quite
alone with himself. He could not quite keep up his indignation over
the unworthy manner in which she had thrown herself into the arms of
that conventional society at which she had so often scoffed. True, it
had only opened the door and beckoned, and she had come. But it was
hardly for him to throw stones, for had he not himself felt the
magnetic attraction of honest bourgeoisie? If it had not been for
that last meeting! If that really was what he accused her of, if it
had been intended for a madcap farewell to the old life, one last
wanton prank before she withdrew behind "the quintessence of
propriety"--could it be possible? Such boundless self-scorn, such a
cynical mockery of herself and him and all that they had shared of
memories and</p>

<p class="c" align="center">133</p>

<hr>
<p class="l">hopes, of enthusiasm and sacred ideals! It made him
blush and rage by turns.--But was he fair to her? After all, what had
she done but tell him frankly and honestly: Such and such things draw
me to the other side and draw me powerfully, but I recognize your
right even more fully than you ask, and here I am. If you can take
me, I am yours; if not, I go where the power is greatest. --And if it
were so, had she not been entirely within her rights? He had not been
able to take her. The final decision <i>might</i> depend on such a
little thing, on the shadow of a thought, the vibration of a
mood.</p>

<p>If he only knew what she must have known for an instant and
probably did not know any longer! He hated to believe that of which
he could not help accusing her. Not only for her sake, but even more
for his own, because it seemed to put a blot on his 'scutcheon, not
logically, of course, and yet-But, whatever the manner of her leaving
him, one thing was certain: he was now alone, and though he felt the
emptiness at first, he was soon conscious of a sense of relief. So
many things were waiting for him. The year at Lb'nborggaard and
abroad, though absorbing his thoughts, had been in a sense an
involuntary rest, and the very fact that this period had given him a
clearer conception of his own powers and limitations spurred him on
to use his faculties in undisturbed work. He was not anxious to
create yet, but rather to collect; there was such an infinite mass of
material he wanted to make his own that he began to think dejectedly
of the brief span of mortal life. Though he had never wasted his
time, it is not easy to emancipate one's self from the paternal
bookcase, and it seems simplest to seek the goal along the paths
where others have attained</p>

<p class="c" align="center">134</p>

<hr>
<p class="l">it, and therefore he had not set out to seek his own
Vinland in the wide world of books, but had followed where the
fathers led. Loyally he had closed his eyes to much that lured him,
in order to see more clearly in the vast night of the Eddas and
sagas, and he had been deaf to many voices that called him, in order
to listen more closely to the mystic sounds of nature in the folk
songs.</p>

<p>But now he understood, at last, that it was not a law of nature to
be either Old Norse or Romantic, that it was simpler to express his
own doubts than to put them in the mouth of Gorm, Loki-worshipper,
that it was more rational to find words for the mystic stirrings of
his own being than to call to the cloister walls of the Middle Ages
and hear his own voice come back to him as a faint echo.</p>

<p>He had always had an open mind for the new ideas of his time, but
he had been occupied in finding how the New had been foreshadowed in
the Old, rather than in listening to what the New said clearly and
explicitly for itself. In this he was in no wise remarkable; for
never yet has any new gospel been preached but the whole world has
become busy with the old prophets.</p>

<p>Yet this did not suffice, and Niels threw himself enthusiastically
into his new labors. He was seized with that lust of conquest and
thirst for the power of knowledge which every worker in the realm of
thought, no matter how humble a drvidge he may later become, has
surely felt once in his life, though for only one brief hour. Which
one of us all, whom a kind fate has given the opportunity to care for
the development of our own minds, has not gazed rapturously out over
the boundless sea of knowledge, and which of us has not gone down</p>

<p class="c" align="center">135</p>

<hr>
<p class="l">to its clear, cool waters and begun, in the
light-hearted arrogance of youth, to dip it out in our hollow hand as
the child in the legend? Do you remember how the sun could laugh over
the fair summer land, yet you saw neither flower nor sky nor rippling
brook? The feasts of life swept past and woke not even a dream in
your young blood; even your home seemed far away--do you remember?
And do you also remember how a structure rose in your thoughts from
the yellowing leaves of books, complete and whole, reposing in itself
as a work of art, and it was yours in every detail, and your spirit
dwelt in it? When the pillars rose slender and with conscious
strength in their bold curves, it was of you that brave aspiring and
of you the bold sustaining. And when the vaulted roof seemed to be
suspended in air, because it had gathered all its weight, stone upon
stone, in mighty drops, and let it down on the neck of the pillars,
it was of you that dream of weightless floating, that confident
bearing down of the arches; it was you planting your foot on your
own.</p>

<p>In this wise your personality grows with your knowledge and is
clarified and unified through it. To learn is as beautiful as to
live. Do not be afraid to lose yourself in minds greater than your
own! Do not sit brooding anxiously over your own individuality or
shut yourself out from influences that draw you powerfully for fear
that they may sweep you along and submerge your innermost pet
peculiarities in their mighty surge! Never fear! The individuality
that can be lost in the sifting and reshaping of a healthy
development is only a flaw; it is a branch grown in the dark, which
is distinctive only so long as it retains its sickly pallor. And</p>

<p class="l">it is by the sound growth in yourself that you must
live. Only the sound can grow great.</p>

<p>Christmas Eve came upon Niels Lyhne unawares. For the past six
months, he had not visited any one except now and then the
Neergaards. They had invited him to spend the evening with them, but
last Christmas Eve had been the memorable one at Clarens, and
therefore he preferred to be alone.</p>

<p>There was a high wind. A thin covering of snow not yet trodden
into slush spread over the streets and made them seem wider. The
layer of white on roofs and window sills gave a touch of beauty to
the houses at the same time as it made them appear more isolated. The
street lamps, flickering in the wind, would now and then, as if
absent-mindedly, send a patch of light up a wall and startle from its
dreams a merchant's sign, making it stare out in large-lettered
blankness. The store windows, too, half lighted as they were and
still disarranged from the Christmas shopping, wore an unusual
aspect, a curiously abstracted look.</p>

<p>He turned into the side streets, where the celebration seemed to
be in full swing. Music sounded from basements and low rooms;
sometimes it was a violin, but more often a hand organ, that droned
out dance tunes, and sometimes in the hearty goodwill of the
performers suggested rather the pleasant toil of the dance than its
festive glamor. It brought an illusion of shuffling feet and steaming
air--at least so it seemed to him who stood outside and, in his
solitude, became polemical against all this sociability. He had much
more sympathy for the workingman who stood with his child outside</p>

<p class="c" align="center">137</p>

<hr>
<p class="l">a tiny shop, discussing one of the cheap marvels in the
dimly lighted window, evidently determined to have their choice
absolutely decided before they ventured into that den of temptation.
And he felt sympathy for the poorly clad old gentlewomen who passed
him, one by one, almost at every hundred steps--all with the
strangest coats and mantillas in the fashion of bygone days, and all
with diffident, timorous movements of their old throats, like
suspicious birds, walking in the uncertain, hesitating manner of
those long unused to the world, as if they had been sitting, day
after day, forgotten in the hidden corners of rear flats and attic
rooms and only that one evening in the year were included and
remembered. It saddened him. His heart shrank with a sick sensation,
as he tried to picture to himself the slowly trickling existence of
such a lonely old spinster; he seemed to hear sounding in his ears a
mantel clock, painfully rhythmic, ticking out its "once-again,
once-again," dropping the empty seconds, one by one in the chalice of
day and filling it full.</p>

<p>Well, he would have to get this Christmas dinner over with. He
retraced his steps in a half conscious dread that if he chose other
streets they might reveal other kinds of lonely creatures and other
forms of forlornness than those he had encountered, which had already
left a bitter taste in his mouth.</p>

<p>Out there in the wider streets he breathed more freely. He
quickened his pace with a slight sense of defiance, holding himself
apart as it were from what he had just seen by telling himself that
his loneliness was self-chosen.</p>

<p>He entered one of the larger restaurants. While waiting for his
dinner, he observed, from the shelter of</p>

<p class="c" align="center">138</p>

<hr>
<p class="l">an old newspaper supplement, the people who came in.
Most of them were young men. Some had a challenging air, as if they
would forbid all present to appropriate them as fellow sufferers,
while others could not conceal their embarrassment at having no place
to go on such an evening, but all showed a marked preference for
distant corners and secluded tables. Many came in couples, and most
of these were plainly brothers; Niels had never seen so many brothers
all at once. Often they were very much unlike each other in dress and
manner, and their hands testified even more clearly to their
different positions in life. It was almost a rarity to see any
particular intimacy between them, either when they came or after they
had sat and talked for a while. Here, one was superior and the other
full of admiration; there, one was cordial, while the other repelled
advances. Others again betrayed a mutual watchfulness, or, worse yet,
an unexpressed condemnation of each other's aims and ambitions and
methods. Most of them evidently needed the holiday and a certain
amount of loneliness to make them remember their common origin and
bring them together.</p>

<p>Niels sat thinking of this and marveling at the patience all these
people exhibited, neither ringing nor calling for the waiters, as if
they had tacitly agreed to banish as much as possible of the
restaurant atmosphere from the place. While he was engrossed in this,
he saw just coming in a man whom he knew, and the sudden sight of a
familiar face among all these strangers startled him so that he rose
and met him with a pleased, though somewhat surprised, "Good
evening."</p>

<p>"Are you waiting for any one?" asked the other, looking for a
place to hang his overcoat.</p>

<p class="c" align="center">139</p>

<hr>
<p>"No, I am alone."</p>

<p>"That's lucky for me!"</p>

<p>The newcomer was a Dr. Hjerrild, a young man whom Niels had met at
the Neergaards, and whom he knew--not from anything he had said, but
from certain innuendos of Mrs. Neergaard's--to be very liberal in his
religious views, though the political opinions he professed were
quite the reverse. People of that type did not often frequent the
home of the Neergaards, who were at once religious and liberal. The
doctor, however, belonged by inclination as well as through the
influence of his dead mother to one of the circles--rather numerous
at that time--where the new liberal ideas were looked on with
skeptical or even hostile eyes, while in religion their members were
rather more than rationalists and rather less than atheists, when
they were not mystics or indifferentists. These various circles had
many shades of opinion, but, in general, they were agreed in feeling
that Holstein was at least as near to their hearts as Slesvig, while
the kinship with Sweden was ignored, and Danism in its newest forms
was not altogether approved. Moreover, they knew their Moliere better
than their Holberg, Baggesen better than Oehlen-schlager, and in
their artistic taste they tended, perhaps, to the sentimental.</p>

<p>In such, or at least kindred influences, Hjerrild had developed.
He sat looking a little dubiously at Niels, as the latter recounted
his observations of the other diners and especially dwelt on their
apparent shame at not having part in any home or semblance of home on
such an evening.</p>

<p>"I understand that perfectly," he said coldly, in a tone almost of
rebuff. "People don't come here on Christmas</p>

<p class="c" align="center">140</p>

<hr>
<p>Eve because they like it, and necessarily they must have a sense
of humiliation at being left out, no matter whether it's other
people's doing or their own. Do you mind telling me why you are here?
Don't answer if you would rather not."</p>

<p>Niels replied that it was only because he had spent last Christmas
Eve with his mother, who had since died.</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon," said Hjerrild; "it was very good of you to
answer me, and you must forgive me for being so suspicious. Do you
know, I could very well imagine that you might come here in order to
administer a youthful kick to Christmas as an institution, but as for
myself, I am really here out of respect for other people's Christmas.
It is the first Christmas Eve since I came here that I have not spent
with a very kind family from my native town. It occurred to me,
somehow, that I was in the way when they sang their Christmas carols,
not that they were ashamed--they have too much character for
that--but it made them uneasy to have any one there to whom these
hymns were as sung into the empty air. At least that is what I
imagined."</p>

<p>Almost silently they finished their dinner, lighted their cigars,
and agreed to go somewhere else for their toddy. Neither of them felt
inclined, that evening, to gaze upon the same gilded mirror frames
and red sofas that met their eyes on most of the other evenings of
the year, and so they sought refuge in a little cafe which they did
not usually frequent.</p>

<p>They soon realized that this was no place to stay in.</p>

<p>The host and the waiters, with a few friends, sat in the rear of
the room, playing loo with two trumps. The host's wife and daughters
looked on and brought the refreshments, but not to the strangers; a
waiter filled</p>

<p class="c" align="center">141</p>

<hr>
<p class="l">their order. They drank hurriedly, for they noticed that
their entrance made an interruption; the conversation was hushed, and
the host, who had been sitting in his shirt sleeves, seemed
embarrassed and put on his coat.</p>

<p>"We seem to be rather homeless tonight," said Niels, as they
walked down the street.</p>

<p>"Well, that is as it should be," was Hjerrild's rather pathetic
answer.</p>

<p>They began to talk about the Christian religion, for the topic was
in the air.</p>

<p>Niels argued vehemently, but in rather general terms, against
Christianity.</p>

<p>Hjerrild was tired of treading again the beaten track of
discussions that were old to him, and suddenly said, without any
particular connection with what had gone before: "Take care, Lyhne;
Christianity is in power. It is foolish to quarrel with the reigning
truth by agitating for a crown prince truth."</p>

<p>"Foolish or not foolish--what does it matter?"</p>

<p>"Don't say that so lightly. I did not mean to tell you such a
commonplace as that it is foolish in a material way; morally, too, it
is foolish and worse. Take care, don't associate yourself too closely
with this particular movement in our time, unless it happens to be
absolutely necessary to your own personality. As a poet you must have
many other interests."</p>

<p>"I don't understand you. I can't treat myself like a hurdy-gurdy
from which I can take out an unpopular piece and put in a tune that
everybody is whistling."</p>

<p>"Can't you? Many people can. But you can at least say: 'We are not
playing that piece just now.' We can often do more in that line than
we think. A human being is not so closely knit. When you use your
right arm</p>

<p class="c" align="center">142</p>

<hr>
<p class="l">constantly in violent exertion, the blood rushes to it,
and it grows at the expense of the rest of your body, while your
legs, which you are using as little as possible, naturally get a
little thin. You can apply the image for yourself. Have you noticed
that most of the idealistic forces in our country, and probably the
best of them, are entirely absorbed in the cause of political
freedom? You can take a lesson from that. Believe me, there is saving
grace in fighting for an idea that is gaining ground, but it is very
demoralizing to a man to belong to a losing minority, which life, in
its inevitable course, puts in the wrong, point by point, step by
step. It cannot be otherwise, for it is bitterly disheartening to see
that which your inmost soul believes to be right and true, to see
this Truth reviled and struck in the face by the meanest camp
follower in the victorious army, to hear her called vile names, while
you can do nothing at all except to love her even more faithfully,
kneel to her in your heart with even deeper adoration, and see her
beautiful face as radiantly beautiful as ever and as full of majesty,
shining with the same immortal light, no matter how much dust is
whirled up around her white forehead, no matter how thickly the
poisonous fog closes around her halo. It is bitterly disheartening,
and your soul suffers injury inevitably, for it is so easy to hate
until you heart is weary, or to draw around you the cold shadows of
contempt, or to be dulled by pain and let the world go its own
way.--Of course, if there is <i>that</i> within you which makes you
not choose the easiest way nor evade the whole matter, but walk
upright with all your faculties tense and all your sympathies wide
awake, taking the blows and stings of defeat as the scourge falls on
your back again and again,</p>

<p class="c" align="center">143</p>

<hr>
<p class="l">and still keep your bleeding hope from dropping, while
you listen for the distant rumblings that presage revolution, and
look for the faint, distant dawn that some day--some time, perhaps
... If you have <i>that</i> within you!--but don't try it, Lyhne.
Imagine what the life of such a man must be, if he is to be true to
himself. Never to open his mouth without knowing that whatever he
says will be met with scorn and jeers! To have his words distorted,
besmirched, wrenched all out of joint, turned into cunning snares for
his own feet, and then, before he can pick them up from the mud and
straighten them out again, to find all the world suddenly deaf. Then
to begin over again at another point and have the same thing happen
over and over again. And--what hurts most, perhaps--to be
misunderstood and despised by noble men and women, whom he looks up
to with admiration and respect in spite of their different
principles. Yet it must be so, it cannot be otherwise. Those who are
in opposition must not expect to be attacked for what they really are
or really want, but for what the party in power is pleased to think
they are and want; and besides, power used upon the weaker must be
misused--how can it be otherwise? Surely no one can expect the party
in power to divest itself of its advantages in order to meet the
opposition on equal terms; but that does not make the struggle of the
opposition less painful and heart-rending. When you think of all
this, Lyhne, do you really suppose a man can fight this battle, with
all these vulture beaks buried in his flesh, unless he has the blind
stubborn enthusiasm which we call fanaticism? And how in the world
can he get fanatic about a negation? Fanatic for the idea that</p>

<p class="c" align="center">144</p>

<hr>
<p class="l">there is no God!--But without fanaticism there is no
victory. Hush, listen!"</p>

<p>They stopped before a house where a curtain had been rolled up,
allowing them to look into a large room, and through the slightly
opened window a song floated out to them, borne on the clear voices
of women and children:</p>

<blockquote>"A child is born in Bethlehem,<br>
In Bethlehem.<br>
Therefore rejoice, Jerusalem!<br>
 Hallelujah, Hallelujah!"</blockquote>

<p class="l">They walked on silently. The song and especially the
notes of the piano followed them down the quiet street.</p>

<p>"Did you hear?" said Hjerrild. "Did you hear the enthusiasm in
that old Hebraic shout of triumph? And those two Jewish names of
towns! Jerusalem was not only symbolic: the entire city, Copenhagen,
Denmark, it was <i>Us,</i> the Christian people within the
people."</p>

<p>"There is no God, and man is his prophet," replied Niels bitterly
and rather sadly.</p>

<p>"Exactly," scoffed Hjerrild. "After all, atheism is unspeakably
tame. Its end and aim is nothing but a disillusioned humanity. The
belief in a God who rules everything and judges everything is
humanity's last great illusion, and when that is gone, what then?
Then you are wiser; but richer, happier? I can't see it."</p>

<p>"But don't you see," exclaimed Niels Lyhne, "that on the day when
men are free to exult and say: 'There is no God!' on that day a new
heaven and a new earth will be created as if by magic. Then and not
till then will</p>

<p class="c" align="center">145</p>

<hr>
<p class="l">heaven be a free infinite space instead of a spying,
threatening eye. Then the earth will be ours and we the earth's, when
the dim world of bliss or damnation beyond has burst like a bubble.
The earth will be our true mother country, the home of our hearts,
where we dwell, not as strangers and wayfarers a short time, but all
our time. Think what intensity it will give to life, when everything
must be concentrated within it and nothing left for a hereafter. The
immense stream of love that is now rising up to the God of men's
faith will bend to earth again and flow lovingly among all those
beautiful human virtues with which we have endowed and embellished
the godhead in order to make it worthy of our love. Goodness,
justice, wisdom--who can name them all? Don't you see what nobility
it will give men when they are free to live their life and die their
death, without fear of hell or hope of heaven, but fearing
themselves, hoping for themselves? How their consciences will grow,
and what a strength it will give them when inactive repentance and
humility cannot atone any more, when no forgiveness is possible
except to redeem with good what they sinned with evil."</p>

<p>"You must have a wonderful faith in humanity. Why, then atheism
will make greater demands on men than Christianity has done."</p>

<p>"Of course!"</p>

<p>"Of course; but where will you get all the strong individuals you
will need to make up your atheistical community?"</p>

<p>"Little by little; atheism itself must develop them. Neither this
generation nor the next and not the next after that will be ripe for
atheism, of that I am quite aware, but in every generation there will
be a few who</p>

<p class="c" align="center">146</p>

<hr>
<p class="l">will honestly struggle to live and die in it and will
win. These people will, in course of time, form a group of spiritual
ancestors to whom their descendants will look back in pride, and from
whom they will gain courage. It will be hardest in the beginning;
many will fail, and those who win will have torn banners, because
they will still be steeped in traditions to the marrow of their
bones; it is not only the brain that has to be convinced, but the
blood and nerves, hopes and longings, even dreams! But it does not
matter; some time it will come, and the few will be the many."</p>

<p>"You think so?--I am trying to think of a name; could we call it
pietistical atheism?"</p>

<p>"All true atheism--" Niels began, but Hjerrild cut him short.</p>

<p>"Of course," he said, "of course! By all means, let us have only a
single gate, one needle's eye for all the camels on the face of the
earth."</p>

<p class="c" align="center">147</p>

<hr>
<h2 class="c" align="center">Chapter X</h2>

<p class="l">EARLY that summer Erik Refstrap came home after his two
years in Italy. He had gone away a sculptor; he returned a painter,
and he had already attracted attention, had sold his pictures, and
received orders for others.</p>

<p>The good fortune coming almost at his first call was due to the
sure instinct for self-limitation which bound his art closely to his
own personality. His gift was not of the large and generous kind that
is instinct with every promise and seems about to grasp every laurel,
that sweeps triumphantly through every realm like a bacchanalian
troop, scattering golden seed on every side, and mounting genii on
all its panthers! He was one of those in whom a dream is buried,
making a peaceful sanctuary in one corner of their souls where they
are most, and yet least, themselves. Through everything these people
create there sounds the same wistful refrain, and every work of art
that comes from their hands bears the same timidly circumscribed
stamp of kinship, as if they were all pictures from the same little
homeland, the same little nook deep among mountains. It was so with
Erik; no matter where he plunged into the ocean of beauty, he always
fetched the same pearl up to the light.</p>

<p class="c" align="center">148</p>

<hr>
<p>His canvases were small: in the foreground a single figure, clay
blue with its own shadow, behind it a heathery stretch of moor or
campagna, and in the horizon a reddish yellow afterglow of sunset.
There was one picture of a young girl telling her own fortune in the
Italian fashion. She is kneeling on a spot where the earth shows
brown between tufts of short grass. The heart, cross, and anchor of
hammered silver, which she has taken from her necklace, are scattered
on the ground. Now she is lying on her knees, her eyes closed in good
faith with one hand covering them, the other reaching down, seeking
rapture of love beyond words, bitter sorrow solaced by the cross, or
the trusting hope of a common fate. She has not yet dared to touch
the ground. Her hand shrinks back in the cold, mysterious shadow; her
cheeks are flushed, and her mouth trembles between prayer and tears.
There is a solemnity in the air; the sunset glow threatens, hot and
fierce out there in the distance, but softly melancholy where it
steals in over the heather. "If you only knew--rapture of love beyond
words, bitter sorrow solaced by the cross, or the trusting hope of a
common fate?"</p>

<p>There was another in which she stands erect on the brown heath,
tense with longing, her cheek pressed down on her folded hands. She
is so sweet in her naive longing and a wee bit sad and angered with
life for passing her by. Why does not Eros come with kissing roses?
Does he think she is too young? Ah, if he would only feel her heart,
how it beats! If he would only lay his hand there! A world is in
there, a world of worlds, if it would only awaken. But why does it
not call? It is there like a bud, tightly folded around it own
sweetness and beauty, existing only for itself, oppressed by
itself.</p>

<p class="c" align="center">149</p>

<hr>
<p>For it knows there is something in life that it does not know. It
is that which has warmed the sheltering petals and given light to the
innermost heart of reddest dusk, where the scent lies yet scentless,
a foreboding only, pressed into one tremulous tear!</p>

<p>Will it never be freed and breathe out all its sli/mber-ing
fragrance, never to be rich in its own wealth? Will it never, never
unfold and blush itself awake with gleaming rays of sunlight darting
in under its petals? She has no patience any more with Eros! Her lips
are quivering with approaching tears; her eyes look out into space
with hopeless defiance, and the little head sinks more and more
forlornly, turning the delicate profile in toward the picture, where
a gentle breeze wafts the reddish dust over dark green broom against
a sherry-golden sky.</p>

<p>That was the way Erik painted. What he had to say always found
expression in pictures such as these. He would sometimes dream in
other images and long to break through that narrow circle within
which he created, but when he had strayed beyond his bounds and tried
his powers in other fields, he always returned with a chill sense of
discouragement, feeling that he had been borrowing from others and
producing something not his own. After these unfortunate
excursions--which, however, always taught him more than he was aware
of--he became more intensely Erik Refstrup than ever before. Then he
would abandon himself with more reckless courage and with almost
poignant fervor to the cult of his own individuality, while his whole
manner of associating with himself, to his slightest act, would be
suffused with a religious enthusiasm. He seemed surrounded by shadowy
throngs of beautiful forms, younger sisters of the slender-limbed
women of Parmi-</p>

<p class="c" align="center">150</p>

<hr>
<p class="l">gianino with their long necks and large, narrow princess
hands; they sat at his table, poured his wine with movements full of
noble grace, and held him in the spell of their fair dreams with
Luini's mystic, contemplative smile, so inscrutably subtle in its
enigmatic sweetness.</p>

<p>But when he had served the god faithfully for eleven days, it
sometimes happened that other powers gained the ascendancy over him,
and he would be seized with a violent craving for the coarse
enjoyment of gross pleasures. Then he would plunge into dissipations,
feverish with that human thirst for self-destruction which yearns,
when the blood burns as hotly as blood can burn, for degradation,
perverseness, filth, and smut, with precisely the measure of strength
possessed by another equally human longing, the longing to keep one's
self greater than one's self and purer.</p>

<p>In these moments there was but little that was rough and coarse
enough for him, and when they had passed, it was long before he could
regain his balance; for in truth these excesses were not natural to
him; he was too healthy for them, too little poisoned by brooding. In
a sense, they came as a rebound from his devotion to the higher
spirits of his art, almost like a revenge, as though his nature had
been violated by the pursuit of those idealistic aims which choice,
aided by circumstances, had made his own.</p>

<p>This twofold struggle, however, was not carried on along such
definite lines that it appeared on the surface of Erik Refstrup's
life; nor did he feel the need of making his friends understand him
in this phase. No, he was the same simple, happy-go-lucky fellow as
of old, slightly awkward in his shrinking from emotions put into</p>

<p class="c" align="center">151</p>

<hr>
<p class="l">words, a little of a freebooter in his capacity for
seizing and holding. Yet the other thing was in him and could be
sensed sometimes in quiet moments, like the bells that ring in a
sunken city on the bottom of the sea. He and Niels had never
understood each other so well as now; both felt it, and silently each
renewed the old friendship. And when vacation time came, and Niels
felt that he really must make his long deferred visit to his Aunt
Rosalie, who was married to Consul Claudi in Fjordby, Erik went with
him.</p>

<p>The main highway from the richest district above Fjordby enters
the town between two great thorn hedges, which bound Consul Claudi's
vegetable garden and his large pleasure garden by the shore. What
then becomes of the road--whether it ends in the Consul's courtyard,
which is as large as a market place, or whether it is continued in a
bend running between his hayloft and his lumberyard to form, later,
the main street of the town--is a matter of opinion. Many travelers
follow the bend and drive on, but there are also many who stop and
think the goal reached when they have come within the Consul's wide
tarred gateway, where the doors are always thrown back and covered
with skins spread for drying.</p>

<p>The buildings on the premises were all old with the exception of
the tall warehouse with its dead looking slate roof, the newest
architectural feature in Fj'ordby. The long, low main building
appeared to be forced to its knees by three large gables, and was
joined, in a dim corner, to the wing containing the kitchen and
stables; in another lighter corner, to the warehouse. In the dark
corner was the back door of the store, which formed, with the
peasants' waiting room, the office, and the servants'</p>

<p class="c" align="center">152</p>

<hr>
<p class="l">hall, a rather dingy world of its own, where the mingled
odor of cheap tobacco and moldy floors, of spices and dried codfish
and wet wool, made the air so thick you could almost taste it. But
when you had passed through the office with its pungent smoke of
sealing wax and had reached the hall which formed the dividing line
between the business and the family, a prevailing perfume of new
millinery prepared you for the delicate scent in the living rooms. It
was not the fragrance of any nosegay or of any real flower; it was
the intangible memory-laden atmosphere which pervades a home, though
no one can say whence it comes. Every home has its own, and it may
suggest a thousand things--the smell of old gloves or new playing
cards or open pianos--but it is always different. It may be stifled
by incense, perfumes, or cigar smoke, but it cannot be killed; it
always comes back unchanged and is there just as before. Here it was
of flowers, not stock or roses or any other flower that can be named,
but rather as one might fancy the scent of those fantastic, pale
sapphire lilies that twine their blossoms around vases of old
porcelain. And how well it went with those wide, low rooms with their
heirloom furniture and their stiff, old-fashioned grace! The floors
were white as only grandmothers' floors can be; the walls were in
plain colors with a light tracery of garlands in delicate tints
running under the ceiling, which had a stucco rose in the center. The
doors were fluted and had knobs of shining brass in the shape of
dolphins. The windows of small square panes were curtained with filmy
net, white as snow, its fullness caught up and fastened with
coquettish bows of colored ribbon, like the curtains of a bridal bed
of Corydon and Phyllis. In the window sill the flowers of bygone days
bloomed in motley green</p>

<p class="c" align="center">153</p>

<hr>
<p class="l">crocks; there were blue agapanthus, blue Canterbury
bells, fine-leaved myrtles, fiery red verbenas, and butterfly bright
geraniums. But it was, after all, chiefly the furniture that gave
character to the rooms: immovable tables with wide expanse of
darkened mahogany; chairs with backs that curled round your figure;
cabinets of every conceivable form, gigantic dressers inlaid with
mythological scenes in light yellow wood--Daphne, Arachne, and
Narcissus--or small secretaries with thin twisted legs and on every
tiny drawer a mosaic of den-drite marble representing a lovely square
house with a tree near by--all from the time before Napoleon. There
were mirrors, too, the glass painted in white or bronze with designs
of rushes and lotus plants floating on a bright sea. As for the sofa,
it was not one of your trifling things on four legs designed for two
persons; no, solid and massive it rose from the floor to form a
veritable spacious terrace; flanking it on either side and built in
one with the sofa, was a console-cupboard, on top of which a smaller
cabinet rose with architectonic effect to the height of a man and
held a precious old jar above the reach of careless hands. It was no
wonder there were so many old things in the Consul's house, for his
father and grandfather had rested and enjoyed the good things of life
within these walls in the intervals of their work in lumberyard and
office.</p>

<p>The grandfather, Berendt Berendtsen Claudi, whose name the firm
still bore, had built the houses and had interested himself chiefly
in the retail and produce trade. The father had worked up the
lumberyard, bought farmland, built the hayloft, and laid out the
gardens. The present Claudi had developed the grain trade and built
the warehouse. He united with his mercantile</p>

<p class="c" align="center">154</p>

<hr>
<p class="l">business the activities of the English and the
Hanoverian vice-consulates as well as a Lloyd's agency; and the grain
and the Western Sea kept him so busy he could give only a very
cursory supervision to the other branches of the work. He therefore
divided the responsibility between an insolvent cousin and an old
unmanageable steward, who would drive the Consul into a corner every
little while by declaring that, whatever happened to the store, the
farm must be attended to, and when he wanted to plough, they could
take horses for hauling lumber wherever they pleased--his they
couldn't have, so help him. But as the man was capable, there was
nothing to be done but to put up with him.</p>

<p>Consul Claudi was in the early fifties, a man of substantial
presence. His regular features, strong to the point of coarseness,
would as readily harden to an expression of energy and cool
astuteness as they would relax into a look almost lickerish as though
relishing a savory tidbit; and he was, in fact, equally at home
whether driving a bargain with shrewd peasants or arguing with a
stubborn salvage gang, or whether sitting with graybearded sinners
over the last bottle of port wine, listening to stories more than
salacious or telling them with the picturesque frankness for which he
was noted.</p>

<p>This, however, was not all of the man.</p>

<p>His training naturally made him feel that he was on alien ground
when he ventured outside of purely practical questions, but he never
tried to conceal his ignorance. Much less did it ever occur to him to
give his opinion and demand that it be respected for the reason that
he was a citizen of mature years and practical experience and a large
taxpayer. On the contrary, he would often listen</p>

<p class="c" align="center">155</p>

<hr>
<p class="l">with a reverence that was almost touching when ladies
and young men discussed such matters; now and then he would venture a
modest question prefaced by elaborate excuses, which almost always
elicited a scrupulously painstaking answer, and then he would express
his thanks with all the courtesy which is so gracious in an older man
thanking his juniors.</p>

<p>At certain favorable moments there could be something surprisingly
fine about Consul Claudi, a wistful look in his clear brown eyes, a
melancholy smile around his strong lips, a seeking, reminiscent note
in his voice, as though he yearned for another and in his own eyes
better world than that to which his friends and acquaintances
consigned him, hide and hair.</p>

<p>The messenger between himself and this better world was his wife.
She was one of those pale, gentle, virginal natures who have not the
courage or perhaps not the impulse, to give out their love in such
fullness that there is no shred of self left in their innermost soul.
Even in the most fleeting moment they can never be so carried away by
their feeling that they throw themselves in blind rapture under the
chariot wheels of their idol. They cannot do it, but all else they
can do for the beloved; they can fulfill the heaviest duties, are
ready for the most grievous sacrifices, and do not flinch from any
humiliation whatsoever. This is true of the best among them.</p>

<p>Mrs. Claudi was not called on to bear such trials. Nevertheless
her marriage was not without its sorrows; for it was a matter of
common knowledge in Fjordby that the Consul was not, or at least had
not been until a few years ago, the most faithful husband, and that
he had several illegitimate children in the neighborhood.</p>

<p class="c" align="center">156</p>

<hr>
<p>This was, of course, a bitter grief to her, and it had not been
easy to keep her heart steadfast through the tumult of jealousy,
scorn and anger, shame and sickening fear, which had made her feel as
though the ground were slipping away under her feet. But she stood
firm. Not only did she never allow a reproachful word to pass her
lips, but she warded off any confessions on the part of her husband,
any direct prayer for forgiveness, and anything that might seem like
a repentant vow. She felt that if it were ever put into words, they
might sweep her along and away from him. Silently she would bear it,
and in the silence she tried to make herself believe that she was in
part to blame for her husband's crime, because of the barrier she had
built around herself, which her love had not been strong enough to
break down. She succeeded in magnifying this sin until she felt an
indistinct need of forgiveness, and in course of time she brought
herself to the point where she gave rise to a rumor that the girls
whom Consul Claudi had seduced and their children were taken care of
in other ways than with money; it seemed that a hidden woman's hand
must be sheltering them, keeping them from harm, supporting them and
guiding them.</p>

<p>So it came to pass that evil was turned into good, and a sinner
and a saint each made the other better.</p>

<p>The Claudis had two children, a son who was in a merchant's office
in Hamburg and a nineteen-year-old daughter named Fennimore after the
heroine in <i>St. Roche,</i> one of Frau von Palzow's novels which
had been very popular in the time of Mrs. Claudi's girlhood.</p>

<p>Fennimore and the Consul came down to meet the steamer on the day
it brought Niels and Erik to Fjordby. Niels was pleasantly surprised
to see that his cousin was</p>

<p class="c" align="center">157</p>

<hr>
<p class="l">pretty, for hitherto he had known her only from a
terrible old family daguerreotype, where she appeared in a misty
atmosphere, forming a group with her brother and her parents, all
with hectic crimson on their cheeks and bright gilding on their
jewelry. And now he found her simply lovely as she stood there in her
light morning dress and her dainty little shoes with their black
ribbons crossing a white-stockinged instep. She was resting one foot
on the plank at the edge of the pier, and bent forward smiling to
give him her parasol handle for a handshake and a welcome, before the
steamer was made fast. Her lips were so red and her teeth so white,
and her forehead and temples so delicately outlined under the wide
brim of her Eugenie hat, from which shadowing edges of deep black
lace fell weighted with bright jet.</p>

<p>At last the gangplank was let down, and the Consul started off
with Erik. He had already introduced himself with twelve feet of
water between them and, still shouting, had drawn Erik into a
humorous conversation about the agonies of seasickness, which he
carried on with a wizened hatter's widow on board. Now he was calling
him to admire the large linden trees outside of the revenue
collector's house and the new schooner standing ready to be launched
from Thomas Rasmussen's shipyard.</p>

<p>Niels walked with Fennimore. She pointed to the flag flying in the
garden in honor of him and his friend, and then they began to discuss
the Neergaards in Copenhagen. They quickly agreed that Mrs. Neergaard
was a little--a very little--they would not say the word, but
Fennimore smiled primly and made a catlike movement with her hand.
The characterization was evidently plain enough to them both, for
they smiled and quickly</p>

<p class="c" align="center">158</p>

<hr>
<p class="l">became serious again. Silently they walked on, each
wondering how he or she appeared in the other's eyes.</p>

<p>Fennimore had imagined Niels Lyhne taller, more distinguished, and
of an individuality more marked--like an underscored word. He, on the
other hand, had found much more than he expected. He thought her
charming, almost alluring, in spite of her dress which savored too
much of small town elegance. When they had entered the hall, and she
stood looking down with a preoccupied air, as she took off her hat
and smoothed her hair with wonderfully soft, languid, graceful turns
of hand and wrist, he felt as grateful as if her movements had been
caresses. This almost puzzling sense of gratitude did not leave him
either that day or the next, and sometimes it welled up so strong and
warm that he felt it would have been the greatest happiness if he
might have thanked her in words for being so pretty and so sweet.</p>

<p>Very soon Erik as well as Niels felt quite at home in the Consul's
hospitable house. Before many days they had slipped into that
pleasantly arranged idling which is the real vacation life and which
it is so difficult to guard against the friendly encroachments of
well-meaning people. They had to use all their diplomacy to avoid the
stuffy evening parties, large boating excursions, summer balls, and
amateur theatricals which were constantly threatening their peace.
They were ready to wish that the Consul's house and garden had been
on a desert island; and Robinson Crusoe was not more agitated by fear
on finding the footsteps in the sand than they were at the sight of
strange paletots in the hall or unfamiliar reticules on the sitting
room table. They much preferred to be by themselves; for they had
scarcely passed the middle of the first week before they were both in
love</p>

<p class="c" align="center">159</p>

<hr>
<p class="l">with Fennimore. It was not the mature passion which must
and will know its fate and longs to have and to hold and to be
assured. As yet it was only the first dawn of love like a hint of
spring in the air, instinct with a longing akin to sadness and with
an unrest that is gently pulsing joy. The heart is so tender and
yielding and easily moved. A light on the water, a rustling in the
leaves, a flower unfolding its petals--all seem to have a strange new
power. Vague hopes without a name burst out, suddenly flooding the
earth with sunlight and as suddenly vanishing again: weak despondency
sails like a broad cloud over the glory, churning the flashes of hope
down into its own gray wake.--Then hopelessness, melting
hopelessness; bittersweet resignation to fate, a heart full of
self-pity, renunciation gazing at its own reflection in quiet elegies
and fainting in a sigh that is half dissembled. . . . But again there
is the whispering of roses: a dreamland rises from the mist with
golden haze over soft beech crowns and with fragrant summer darkness
under leafy boughs arched over paths that lead no one knows
whither.</p>

<p><br>
</p>

<p>One evening after tea they were all gathered in the sitting room.
The garden and all outdoor amusements were barred, for the rain was
pouring down; but no one seemed to mind. The sense of being shut in
gave the room something of the snug comfort of a winter evening, and
moreover the rain was a blessing. Everything had been so parched and
dry, but now the water streamed down, and when the heavy drops
rattled against the frame of the reflector in the window the sound
called up vague, fleeting glimpses of luscious green meadows and
freshened foliage. Now and then some one would say under</p>

<p class="c" align="center">160</p>

<hr>
<p class="l">his breath: "How it pours!" and glance at the
window-panes with a little gleam of pleasure and a half-conscious
luxuriating in fellow feeling with everything out of doors. Erik had
fetched the mandolin he had brought with him from Italy and sang
about Napoli and the bright stars. Then a young lady who had been to
tea sat down at the piano and accompanied her own rendering of "My
little nook among the mountains," in Swedish, making the <i>atis</i>
very broad to get the right Swedish effect.</p>

<p>Niels, who was not particularly musical, let himself be soothed
into a gentle melancholy and sat lost in his own thoughts, until
Fennimore began to sing.</p>

<p>Then he awoke, but not pleasantly.</p>

<p>Her song agitated him uncomfortably. She was no longer the little
country girl when she gave herself up to the spell of her own voice.
Strange how she let herself be carried away by the tones, how freely
and unreservedly she poured herself into them! He felt it almost as
something immodest, as though she were singing herself naked before
him. There was a burning around his heart; his temples throbbed, and
he cast his eyes down. Did none of the others see it? No, they saw
nothing. Why, she had flown out of herself, away from Fjordby, from
Fjordby poetry and Fjordby sentiments! She was in another and a
bolder world, where the passions grew on high mountains and flung
their red blossoms to the storm.</p>

<p>Could it be his lack of musical sense that made him read so much
meaning into her song? He could hardly persuade himself that it was
so, and yet he wished it, for he would much rather have her as she
usually appeared. When she sat at her sewing, talking in her quiet,
tranquil voice, or looking up with her clear, kind eyes, his whole
being was drawn to her with the irresistible</p>

<p class="c" align="center">161</p>

<hr>
<p class="l">strength of a deep, calm longing for home. He wanted to
humble himself before her, to bend the knee and call her holy. He
always felt a strange yearning to come close to her, not only to her
present self, but to her childhood and all the days he had not known
her. When they were alone, he would lead her to talk of the past, of
her little troubles and mistakes and the vagaries that every
childhood is full of. He lived in these memories and clung to them
with a restless jealousy and a languishing desire to possess and be
one with these pale foreshadowings of a life which was even now
glowing in richer, riper colors. And then came this song so strangely
powerful! It startled him very much like a wide sweep of horizon
suddenly revealed by a turn of the path, reducing the forest dell
which had been his home to a mere corner in the landscape, and making
its rippling lines seem insignificant beside the grandeur of the
hills and distant moors.--Oh, but the landscape was a Fata Morgana,
and what he thought he heard in her song only a fantasy; for now she
spoke just as she always did and was her blessed self again.
Moreover, he knew from a thousand little things that she was like
still water, without storm or waves, reflecting the starry blue
heavens.</p>

<p>It was thus he loved her, and thus he saw her; and when she was
with him she gradually formed herself upon his image of her, not with
any conscious dissembling, for after all his conception was partly
true, and it was only natural--when his every word and look, his
every thought and dream, appealed to that side of her nature and did
homage to it--that she should assume the guise he almost forced upon
her. Besides, how could she bother about giving each and every one a
correct impression of herself when all her thoughts centered
around</p>

<p class="c" align="center">162</p>

<hr>
<p class="l">the one, Erik, the only one, her chosen lord, whom she
loved with a passion that was not of herself and with an idolatrous
worship that terrified her. She had imagined love to be a sweet
dignity, not this consuming unrest, full of fear and humiliation and
doubt. Many a time when the declaration seemed trembling on Erik's
lips, she had felt as if it were her duty to put her hand on his
mouth and warn him against speaking, accusing herself and telling him
how she had deceived him and how unworthy of his love she was, how
earthly and small and impure, so far from noble, so wretchedly low
and common and wicked! She felt herself dishonest under his admiring
gaze; calculating, when she failed to avoid him; criminal, when she
could not bring herself to beg God in her evening prayer that He
would turn Erik's heart from her in order that his life might be all
sunlight and honor and glory. For she knew that her lowborn passion
would drag him down.</p>

<p>It was almost in spite of himself that Erik loved her. His ideal
had always been high, proud, and noble, with quiet melancholy
suffusing her pale features and coolness of temple air lingering in
the severe folds of her garment. But Fennimore's sweetness conquered
him. He could not resist her beauty. There was such a fresh, innocent
sensu-ousness about her whole form. When she walked her gait
whispered of her body; there was a nakedness in her movements and a
dreamy eloquence in her repose, neither of which she could help, for
she could not conceal the one or silence the other, even had she been
in the slightest degree conscious of their existence. No one saw this
better than Erik, and he was fully aware of what a large part her
purely physical beauty played in her attraction for him. He struggled
against it, for there were</p>

<p class="c" align="center">163</p>

<hr>
<p class="l">exalted ideals of love in his soul, ideals which had
their source, perhaps, not only in tradition and poetry, but in
deeper strata of his nature than those that appeared on the surface.
But whatever their source, they had to yield.</p>

<p>He had not yet confessed his love to Fennimore, when it happened
that the good ship <i>Berendt Claudi</i> came in. Inasmuch as it was
going to unload farther up the fjord, it did not enter the harbor,
but lay out in the stream, and as the Consul was very proud of his
schooner and wanted to show it to his guests, they rowed out there
one afternoon to drink tea on board.</p>

<p>It was a glorious day without a breath of wind, and all were
intent on a merry time. The hours passed quickly. They drank English
porter, set their teeth in English hardtack as large as moons, and
ate salted mackerel caught on the voyage across the North Sea. They
pumped with the ship's pump till the water frothed, tipped the
compass, drew water from the casks with the large tin siphon, and
listened to the mate playing his octagonal hand harmonica.</p>

<p>It was quite dark before they were ready to return.</p>

<p>They separated into two parties. Erik and Fennimore and two of the
older people went in the ship's yawl, which was to make a detour
around the harbor and then row slowly to land, while the rest of the
party went in the Consul's own boat, which was to steer directly for
the pier. This arrangement was made in order to hear how the song
would sound over the water on such a quiet night. Erik and Fennimore
therefore sat together in the stern of the yawl and had the mandolin
between them, but the singing was forgotten when the oars were dipped
in the water and revealed an unusually bright phosphorescence which
absorbed their attention.</p>

<p class="c" align="center">164</p>

<hr>
<p>Silently the boat glided onward, and behind it the dull, glassy
surface was fluted with shifting lines and rings of a tender white
light too faint to penetrate the darkness beyond its own groove,
except now and then when it seemed to give out a luminous mist. It
frothed white where the oars cut into it and slid backward in
tremulous rings growing fainter and fainter; it was scattered from
the blades in bright drops falling like a phosphorescent rain, which
was extinguished in the air but lighted the water drop by drop. There
was such quiet over the fjord that the sound of the oars seemed only
to measure the stillness in pauses of equal length. Hushed and soft,
the gray twilight brooded over the soundless deep; the boat and its
occupants melted together in one dark mass, from which the
phosphorescence freed the plying oars and sometimes a trailing rope's
end, or perhaps the brown impassive face of the oarsman. No one
spoke. Fennimore was cooling her hand in the water; she and Erik sat
turning back to look at the network of light that trailed silently
after the boat and held their thoughts in its fair meshes.</p>

<p>A call for a song shouted from land roused them, and together they
sang two or three Italian romances to the accompaniment of the
mandolin.</p>

<p>Then all was still again.</p>

<p>At last they landed at the little jetty running out from the
garden. The Consul's empty boat was moored alongside, and the party
had already gone up to the house. Fennimore's aunt and her companion
followed them, but Erik and Fennimore remained standing and looked
after the boat as it returned to the ship. The latch of the garden
gate fell with a click; the sound of the oars grew fainter and
fainter, and the swelling of the water around</p>

<p class="c" align="center">165</p>

<hr>
<p class="l">the pier died away. Then a breath stirred in the dark
trees around them like a sigh that had hidden itself and now softly
lifted the leaves, flew away, and left them alone.</p>

<p>In the same moment they turned to each other and away from the
water. He caught her hand and slowly, questioningly, drew her close
and kissed her. "Fenni-more!" he whispered, and they walked through
the dark garden.</p>

<p>"You have known it long!" he said, and she replied, "Yes." Then
they walked on, and the latch fell once more.</p>

<p>Erik could not sleep when he reached his room at last, after
drinking coffee with the company and saying good night at the street
door.</p>

<p>There was no air in there; he flung the windows wide open, then
threw himself on the couch and listened.</p>

<p>He wanted to get out again.</p>

<p>How everything resounded through the house! He could hear the
Consul's slippers, and now Mrs. Claudi opened the kitchen door to see
if the fire was out. What in the world could Niels want in his trunk
this time of night! Ah--there was a mouse behind the wainscoting. Now
some one crossed the attic in stocking feet--now another--there were
two.--At last! He opened the door to the guest room within and
listened, then he carefully opened the window, straddled over the
sill, and slid into the courtyard. He knew that he could get down to
the shore through the mangling room. If any one saw him, he meant to
say that he had forgotten his mandolin down by the jetty and wanted
to rescue it from the dew. Therefore he slung the mandolin on his
back.</p>

<p>The garden was a little lighter now; there was a slight breeze and
a bit of moon which had laid a tremulous</p>

<p class="c" align="center">166</p>

<hr>
<p class="l">strip of silver from the jetty out to the <i>Berendt
Claudi.</i></p>

<p>He went through the garden out on the stone sloping which
protected it from the water, running in abrupt angles round a large
embankment and all the way out to the end of the harbor mole.
Balancing uncomfortably on the flat, slanting stones, he finally
reached the molehead and, rather out of breath, sat down on the
bench.</p>

<p>Above his head the red lantern of the harbor light swung slowly
back and forth with a sound like the sighing of iron, while the flag
line flapped gently against its staff.</p>

<p>The moon had come out a little more and cast a cautious
grayish-white light over the quiet ships in the harbor and over the
maze of rectangular roofs and white dark-eyed gables in the town.
Above and beyond it all the church steeple rose, calm and light.</p>

<p>He leaned back dreaming, while a wave of unutterable joy and
exultation surged through his heart; he felt rich and full of
strength and the warmth of life. It seemed as though Fennimore must
hear every love thought that grew from his rapture, vine in vine, and
blossom on blossom; and he rose, and quickly striking the strings of
the mandolin sang triumphantly to the town asleep in there:</p>

<blockquote>"Wakeful aloft lies my lassie,<br>
She listens to my song!"</blockquote>

<p class="l">Again and again, when his heart grew too full, he
repeated the words of the old ballad.</p>

<p>Gradually he became calmer. Memories of the hours in the past when
he had felt weakest, poorest, and most forlorn pressed in on him with
a slight, tense pain like that of the first tears welling up in the
eyes. He sat down on the bench again, and with his hand lying mute on
the</p>

<p class="c" align="center">167</p>

<hr>
<p class="l">mandolin strings, he gazed out over the blue-gray
expanse of the fjord, where the moon bridge formed a glittering way
past the dark ship to the lines of the Morso hills, drawn in faint,
melancholy cloud-blue land through a haze of white.</p>

<p>And the memories thronged, but they grew gentler, were lifted to
fairer lands, and seemed lighted by a roseate dawn.</p>

<blockquote>. . . My lassie!</blockquote>

<p class="l">He sang it to himself:</p>

<blockquote>"Wakeful aloft lies my lassie,<br>
She listens to my song."</blockquote>

<p class="c" align="center">168</p>

<hr>
<h2 class="c" align="center">Chapter XI</h2>

<p class="l">THREE years had passed; Erik and Fennimore had been
married for two years, and made their home in a little villa at
Mariagerfjord. Niels had not seen Fennimore since that summer at
Fjordby. He lived in Copenhagen and went out a great deal, but had no
intimate friends except Dr. Hjerrild, who called himself old because
touches of gray had begun to appear in his dark hair.</p>

<p>That unexpected engagement had been a hard blow to Niels. It had a
benumbing effect on him. He grew more bitter and less confiding, and
had no longer so much enthusiasm to pit against Hjerrild's pessimism.
Though he still pursued his studies, their plan was less and less
definite, while his purpose of some time completing them and
beginning his real lifework flickered uncertainly. He lived much
among people, but very little with them. They interested him, but he
did not in the least care to have them be interested in him; for he
felt the force that should have driven him to do his part with the
others or against them slowly ebbing out of him. He could wait, he
told himself, even if he had to wait till it was too late. Whoever
has faith is in no hurry--that was his excuse to himself. For he
believed that, when he came down to</p>

<p class="c" align="center">169</p>

<hr>
<p class="l">the bedrock of his own nature, he did have faith strong
enough to move mountains--the trouble was that he never managed to
set his shoulder to them. Once in a while, the impulse to create
welled up in him, and he longed to see a part of himself freed in
work that should be his very own. For days he would be excited with
the happy, titanic effort of carting the clay for his Adam, but he
never formed it in his own image. The will power necessary to
persistent self-concentration was not in him. Weeks would pass before
he could make up his mind to abandon the work, but he did abandon it,
asking himself, in a fit of irritation, why he should continue. What
more had he to gain? He had tasted the rapture of conception; there
remained the toil of rearing, cherishing, nourishing, carrying to
perfection--Why? For whom? He was no pelican, he told himself. But
argue as he might, he was dissatisfied with himself and felt that he
had not fulfilled his own expectations; nor did it avail him to carp
at these expectations and ask whether they were well founded. He had
reached the point where he had to choose, for when first youth is
past--early or late in accordance with each person's
individuality--then, early or late, dawns the day when Resignation
comes to us as a temptress, luring us to forego the impossible and be
content. And Resignation has much in her favor; for how often have
not the idealistic aspirations of youth been beaten back, its
enthusiasms been shamed, its hopes laid waste!--The ideals, the fair
and beautiful, have lost nothing of their radiance, but they no
longer walk here among us as in the early days of our youth. The
broad, firmly planted stairway of worldly wisdom has conveyed them
back, step by step, to that heaven whence our simpler faith once
brought them down; and there they sit, radiant but</p>

<p class="c" align="center">170</p>

<hr>
<p class="l">distant, smiling, but weary, in divine quiescence, while
the incense of a slothful adoration rises, puff on puff, in festive
convolutions.</p>

<p>Niels Lyhne was tired. These repeated runnings to a leap that was
never leaped had wearied him. Everything seemed to him hollow and
worthless, distorted and confused, and, oh, so petty! He preferred to
stop his ears and stop his mouth and to immerse himself in studies
that had nothing to do with the busy everyday world, but were like an
ocean apart, where he could wander peacefully in silent forests of
seaweed among curious animals.</p>

<p>He was tired, and the root of his weariness sprang from his
baffled hope of love; thence it had spread, quickly and surely,
through his whole being, to all his faculties and all his thoughts.
Now he was cold and passionless enough, but in the beginning, after
the blow had fallen, his love had grown, day by day, with the
irresistible power of a malignant fever. There had been moments when
his soul was almost bursting with insane passion; it swelled like a
wave in its infinite longing and frothing desire; it rose and went on
rising and rising, till every fiber in his brain and every cord in
his heart were strung tense to the breaking point. Then weariness had
come, soothing and healing, making his nerves dull against pain, his
blood too cold for enthusiasm, and his pulse too weak for action. And
more than that, it had protected him against a relapse by giving him
all the prudence and egoism of the convalescent. When his thoughts
went back to those days in Fjordby, he had a sense of immunity akin
to the feeling of a man who has just passed through a severe illness
and knows that now, when he has endured his allotted agony, and the
fever has burned itself to ashes within him, he will be free for a
long, long time.</p>

<p class="c" align="center">171</p>

<hr>
<p>Then it happened, one summer day, after Erik and Fennimore had
been married for two years, that he received a half whining, half
boasting letter from Erik, in which he blamed himself for having
wasted his time of late. He did not know what the matter was, but he
had no ideas. The people he met in the neighborhood were fine, jolly
fellows, no conventionality or nonsense about them, but they were
perfect dromedaries with regard to art. There was not a human being
he could talk with, and he had gotten himself into a slough of
laziness and stagnation which he could not pull out of. He never had
a glimmering of an idea or a mood, and never felt inspired. Sometimes
he was afraid that his power had run out, and that he never would do
anything any more. But this could not possibly go on forever! It must
come back; he had been too rich to end like this, and when it came he
would show them what art was, those fellows who painted away all the
time as if they had learned it by rote. For the present, however, he
was as if bewitched, and it would be an act of friendship if Niels
would visit Mariagerfjord. They would make him as comfortable as
circumstances allowed, and he could just as well spend his vacation
there as any other place. Fennimore sent her love and would be glad
to see him.</p>

<p>This letter was so unlike Erik that Niels saw at once there must
be something serious amiss or he would not complain in this fashion.
He was aware, too, of how little volume there was in the wellspring
of Erik's production--a slender stream only, which unfavorable
circumstances could easily dry out. He would go at once! For all that
had happened, Erik should find him a faithful friend; whatever the
vears had loosened of old ties and uprooted</p>

<p class="c" align="center">172</p>

<hr>
<p class="l">of old illusions, he would at least know how to guard
this old friendship of their childhood. He had helped Erik before,
and he would help him now. A fanaticism of friendship possessed him.
He would renounce his future, fame, ambitious dreams, everything, for
Erik's sake. All that he owned of smoldering enthusiasm and creative
ferment should be Erik's; he would merge himself in Erik with his
whole self and all his ideas, holding nothing back, keeping nothing
for himself. He dreamed of greatness for the friend who had torn his
life asunder so roughly, and saw himself blotted out, forgotten,
impoverished, deprived of his intellectual heritage; and he went on
dreaming that his gift to Erik should become no longer a loan, but
Erik's very own, as he coined it into works and deeds and gave it his
stamp. Erik in honor and glory, and he himself one of the many, many
commonplace folk and nothing else; poor, at last, by necessity, not
by choice; a real beggar, not a prince in disguise . . . And it was
sweet to dream himself so bitterly humble.</p>

<p>But dreams are dreams, and he laughed at himself, as he thought
that people who neglect their own work always have no end of time to
interest themselves in that of others. It also occurred to him that,
when he came face to face with Erik, the latter would, of course,
disclaim his letter and pass it off as a joke. He certainly would
think it extremely absurd if Niels were actually to present himself
with the announcement that he was ready to help him recover his
creative power. Nevertheless he went. In his inmost heart he believed
that he could do some good, and no matter how much he tried to
explain it away or cast doubts upon it, he could not rid himself of
the feeling that it really was the friendship</p>

<p class="c" align="center">173</p>

<hr>
<p class="l">of their boyhood which had reasserted itself in all its
old simplicity and warmth, in spite of the years and what the years
had brought.</p>

<p>The villa at Mariagerfjord belonged to an elderly couple who had
been forced by ill health to make their home in the south for an
indefinite period. They had not intended to rent the place, as they
had started out with the idea of returning after six months, and
therefore had left everything just as it was. So when Erik leased the
house fully furnished, this was so literally true that he got it with
bric-a-brac, family portraits, and everything else, even to an attic
full of decrepit furniture with old letters in the drawers of the
secretaries.</p>

<p>Erik had discovered the villa when he left Fjordby after his
engagement. As it contained everything they needed, and as he hoped
to go to Italy in a year or two, he had persuaded Consul Claudi to
postpone the purchase of household furnishings for a while. They had
moved into Marianelund very much as into a hotel, except that they
brought a few more trunks than travelers usually carry.</p>

<p>The house fronted the fjord, less than twenty feet from the water,
and was rather ordinary in appearance. It had a balcony above, a
veranda below, and at the back a young garden with trees no thicker
than walking sticks, but from the garden one could step right into a
magnificent bit of beech woods with heathery glades and wide clefts
opening between banks of white clay, and that made up for many
shortcomings.</p>

<p>This was Fennimore's new home, and for a while it was as bright as
happiness could make it, for they were</p>

<p class="c" align="center">174</p>

<hr>
<p class="l">both young and in love, strong and healthy, and without
a care for their means of subsistence, either spiritual or
material.</p>

<p>But every palace of joy that rises heavenward has sand mixed in
the earth on which it is founded, and the sand will collect and run
away, slowly perhaps, imperceptibly perhaps, but it runs and runs,
grain by grain. . . And love? Even love is not a rock, however much
we may wish to believe it.</p>

<p>She loved him with her whole soul, with the hot tremulous passion
born of fear. He was to her much more than a god, much nearer--he was
an idol, whom she worshiped without reason and without reserve.</p>

<p>His love was strong as hers, but it lacked the fine, manly
tenderness that protects the loved woman against herself and watches
over her dignity. Dimly he felt it as a duty, which called him
sometimes in a faint, low voice, but he would not hear. She was too
alluring in her blind love; her beauty, which had the provocative
luxuriance and the humble seductiveness of the female slave, incited
him to a passion that knew neither bounds nor mercy.</p>

<p>In the old myth about Amor, is it not told somewhere that he puts
his hand over Psyche's eyes before they fly away, rapturously, into
the glowing night?</p>

<p>Poor Fennimore! If she could have been consumed by the fire of her
own heart, he who should have guarded her would have fanned the
flames; for he was like that drunken monarch who swung the incendiary
torch, shouting with joy to see his imperial city burn, intoxicating
himself with the sight of the leaping flames, until the ashes made
him sober.</p>

<p>Poor Fennimore! She did not know that the hymn of joy can be sung
so often that both melody and words</p>

<p class="c" align="center">175</p>

<hr>
<p class="l">are lost, and nothing remains but a twaddle of
triviality. She did not know that the intoxication which uplifts
today takes its strength from the wings of tomorrow, and when at
length sobriety dawned, gray and heavy, she realized tremblingly that
they had loved themselves down to a sweet contempt for themselves and
each other--a sweet contempt which day by day lessened in sweetness
and became, at last, utterly bitter. They turned away from each other
as far as they could; he, to dream about his betrayed ideal of lofty
coldness and scornful grace; she, to gaze with longing despair at the
dim, quiet shores of her girlhood days, now so immeasurably far away.
With each day that passed, it seemed harder to bear; shame burned
madly in her veins, and a suffocating disgust with herself made
everything seem wretched and hopeless. There was a small deserted
room containing nothing but the trunks she had brought from home, and
there she would often sit, hour after hour, until the sun sank over
the world out there and filled the room with reddish light. There she
tortured herself with thoughts sharper than thorns and scourged
herself with words more stinging than whips, until she was stupefied
by misery and tried to deaden her pain by throwing herself down on
the floor as something too full of corruption and dregs--a carrion of
herself--too foul to be the seat of a soul. Her husband's mistress!
That thought was never out of her mind; with that she threw herself
in the dust and trampled on herself; with that she barred every hope
of regeneration and turned every happy memory to stone.</p>

<p>Gradually a hard, brutal indifference came over her, and she
ceased to despair, as she had long ceased to hope. Her heaven had
fallen, but she did not try to</p>

<p class="c" align="center">176</p>

<hr>
<p class="l">raise the vault again in her dreams. The earth was good
enough for her, since she was but of earth, earthy. She did not hate
Erik, nor did she draw away from him. No, she accepted his kisses;
she despised herself too much to repulse them, and besides, was she
not his wife--his woman?</p>

<p>For Erik, too, the awakening was bitter, although his man's
prosaic common sense had warned him that some time it must come. When
it really came, however, when love no longer gave boot for every
bane, and the veil of gleaming gold in which it had descended to
earth for him had been wafted away, he felt such a sinking of his
spirits and such a sluggishness creeping over all his powers that he
was angered and alarmed. Feverishly he turned to his work to assure
himself that he had lost nothing else besides happiness, but art did
not give him the answer he hoped for. He got hold of some unlucky
ideas which he could not do anything with and yet could not make up
his mind to abandon. Though they refused to take shape, they
continued to tease his mind, and prevented other ideas from breaking
through or absorbing his energy. He grew despondent and dissatisfied
and sank into a moody idleness, since work was so confoundedly
perverse, and since, of course, he had only to wait for the spirit to
move him again. But time passed; his talent was still barren, and
here by the quiet fjord there was nothing that could fructify it; nor
were there any fellow artists whose triumphs could spur him on either
to emulation or to creative opposition.</p>

<p>This inactivity grew unbearable. He was seized with a violent
craving to feel himself, no matter how or in what, and since nothing
else offered, he turned to a crowd of older and younger men about the
neighborhood</p>

<p class="c" align="center">177</p>

<hr>
<p class="l">who enlivened the dullness of country life by such
dissipations as their limited fancy could invent and their rather
one-sided taste could savor. The kernel of their pleasures was always
drinking and cards, no matter whether the shell enclosing them was
called a market day or a hunt. Nor did it make any particular
difference that the scene was occasionally laid in a small
neighboring town, and certain real or imagined business was
transacted with the tradesmen during the afternoon: for the bargain
was always closed at night in the tavern, where the discriminating
landlord always showed persons of the right stripe into Number
Caveat. If there happened to be strolling players in town, the
tradesmen were let go, for the players were more sociable, did not
shy at the bottle, and were usually ready to undergo the
miraculous--though never quite successful--cure of drinking
themselves sober in gin after getting drunk on champagne.</p>

<p>The leader of the crowd was a hunting squire of sixty, and its
main stock was made up of small landowners and country gentlemen in
the neighborhood, though it also included a massive young dandy of a
brandy distiller and a white-necked tutor, who had not been a tutor
for twenty years or more, but had gone as a vagrant from house to
house with a sealskin bag and an old gray mare, which he used to say
he had bought from a horse butcher. He was a silent drinker, a
virtuoso on the flute, and was supposed to know Arabic. Among those
whom the squire called his "staff" were also a solicitor, who always
had new stories to tell, and a doctor, who knew only a single one
from the siege of L&uml;beck in the year 6.</p>

<p>The members of this band were widely scattered, and it scarcely
ever happened that they were all together at</p>

<p class="c" align="center">178</p>

<hr>
<p class="l">one time, but whenever any one stayed away from the
company too long the squire would issue a summons to the faithful to
inspect the renegade's oxen, which all understood to mean that they
should quarter themselves upon the unfortunate man for two or three
days and turn his house upside down with drinking, gambling, and
whatever rustic amusements the season afforded. During such a
punitive visit, it once happened that the whole party was snowbound,
and the host's supply of coffee, rum, and sugar ran out, so that they
were reduced to drinking a coffee punch boiled of chicory, sweetened
with syrup, and strengthened with brandy.</p>

<p>It was a coarse-grained crowd of boon companions that Erik had
fallen in with, but perhaps people of such tremendous animal vitality
could hardly find sufficient outlet in more civilized amusements, and
their unfailing good humor and broad, bruin-like joviality really
took away much of the grossness. If Erik's talent had been akin to
that of Brouwer or Ostade, this choice band of revelers would have
been a perfect gold mine to him. As it was, he got nothing out of it
except that he enjoyed it very much, too much in fact, for soon this
wild racketing became indispensable to him and took up nearly all his
time. Now and then, he would blame himself for his idling and vow to
end it, but whenever he made an attempt at working, the sense of
blackness and spiritual impotence would come over him again and drive
him back to the old life.</p>

<p>The letter to Niels had been framed one day when his everlasting
barrenness had made him wonder if his talent had been attacked by a
wasting disease. As soon as it was sent, he regretted it, and hoped
that Niels would let his plaint go in at one ear and out at the
other.</p>

<p class="c" align="center">179</p>

<hr>
<p>But Niels he came, the knight-errant of friendship personified,
and was met with that mixture of rebuff and pity which knights-errant
in all times have encountered from those in whose behalf they have
dragged Rosinante out of her snug stable. As Niels was tactful,
however, and bided his time, Erik thawed before long, and the old
intimacy was soon established between them; for Erik's need of
pouring himself out in complaint and confession had grown into an
almost physical craving.</p>

<p>One evening after bedtime, when Fennimore had retired, they sat
over their cognac and water in the dark sitting room. Only the glow
of their cigars showed where they were, and once in a while, when
Niels leaned far back in his chair, his upturned profile would stand
out black against the dark window-pane. They had been drinking a good
deal, Erik especially, while they sat talking of the time when they
were boys at L&ouml;nborggaard. Now Fennimore's departure had made a
pause which neither of them seemed inclined to break, for their
thoughts came stealing upon them in a pleasant languor, as they
listened drowsily to the singing of their blood, warm from the
cognac.</p>

<p>"What fools we were when we were twenty," came Erik's voice at
last. "God knows what we expected and how we had got it into our
heads that such things were on earth. We called them by the same
names that they bear in reality, but we meant something entirely
above and beyond comparison with this tame sufficiency that we've
got. There isn't much to life, really. Do you think so?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't know; I take it for what it is worth. We don't
generally live very much. Most of the time we only exist. If you
could get life handed to you in one whole</p>

<p class="c" align="center">180</p>

<hr>
<p class="l">large, appetizing cake that you could set your teeth in
. . . but doled out in bits!--no, it's not amusing."</p>

<p>"Tell me, Niels--it's only to you I can talk of such absurd
things; I don't know how it is, but you're so queer. Tell me--is
there anything in your glass? All right!--Have you ever thought of
death?"</p>

<p>"Have I? Why, yes. Have you?"</p>

<p>"I don't mean at funerals or when a man is sick, but sometimes
when I'm just sitting here comfortably it comes over me like--like a
despair simply. When I sit here and mope and don't do anything and
<i>can't</i> do anything, then I actually feel the time slipping away
from me. Hours and weeks and months rush past with nothing in them,
and I can't nail them to the spot with a piece of work. I don't know
if you understand what I mean, but I want to get hold of it with
something achieved. When I paint a picture, the time I use for it
remains mine forever; it isn't lost, even though it's past. I am sick
when I think of the days as they go--incessantly. And I <i>have</i>
nothing, or I can't get at it. It's torture! I sometimes get into
such a rage that I have to get up and walk the floor and sing some
idiotic thing to keep myself from crying, and then when I stop I am
almost mad to think that the time has gone meanwhile, and is going
while I think, and going and going. There is nothing more wretched
than to be an artist. Here I am, strong and healthy; I have eyes to
see; my blood is warm and red; my heart beats, and there is nothing
the matter with my head, and I <i>want</i> to work, but I can't. I am
struggling and groping for something that eludes me, something that I
can't grasp even if I toil and moil till I sweat blood. What can a
man do for inspiration or to get an idea? Is it all one whether I
concentrate or whether I go out and pretend I am not</p>

<p class="c" align="center">181</p>

<hr>
<p class="l">looking for anything, never, never anything except the
sense that now Time is standing up to the waist in eternity and
hauling in the hours, and they rush past, twelve white and twelve
black, never stopping, never stopping. What shall I do? What do
people do when they feel like that? Surely, I can't be the first.
Have you nothing to suggest?"</p>

<p>"Travel."</p>

<p>"No, anything but that. What made you think of that? You don't
believe I'm done for, do you?"</p>

<p>"Done for! No, but I thought the new impressions--"</p>

<p>"The new impressions! Exactly. Have you never heard about people
who had plenty of talent in their first youth while they were fresh
and full of hope and plans, but when youth had passed their talent
was gone too--and never came back?"</p>

<p>They were silent for a long time.</p>

<p><i>"They</i> traveled, Niels, to get new impressions, that was
their fixed idea. The south, the Orient--it was all in vain; it slid
off from them as from a looking glass. I have seen their graves in
Rome--two of them, but there are many, many others. One of them went
mad."</p>

<p>"I have never heard that about painters before."</p>

<p>"It's true. What can it be, do you think? A hidden nerve that's
given way? Or something we have failed in or sinned against in
ourselves, perhaps--who knows? A soul is such a fragile thing, and no
one knows how far the soul extends in a human being. We ought to be
good to ourselves--Niels!" His voice had grown low and soft. "I have
often longed to travel, because I felt so empty. You have no idea how
I have longed for it, but I simply don't dare to, for suppose it
didn't help, and that I was one of those people I was telling you of.
What then!</p>

<p class="c" align="center">182</p>

<hr>
<p>Think of standing face to face with the certainty that I was done
for, didn't possess anything, couldn't do anything--think of
it--couldn't do anything! A paltry wretch, a cursed dog of a cripple,
a miserable eunuch! What do you think would become of me? And after
all it is not impossible. My first youth is past, and as for
illusions and that sort of thing, I can assure you I haven't many
left. It's terrible how we go through them, and yet I was never one
of those who are anxious to get rid of them. I was not like you and
the rest of the people who used to foregather at Mrs. Boye's--you
were always so busy plucking the fine feathers from one another, and
the balder you got, the more you crowed. Still what's the
difference--sooner of later we all start molting."</p>

<p>They were silent again. The air was bitter with cigar smoke and
heavy with cognac, and they sighed drearily, oppressed by the
stuffiness of the room and by their own very sad hearts.</p>

<p>Niels had traveled two hundred miles to bring aid, and here he sat
feeling his impulse put to shame, while the colder side of his nature
looked on. For what could he do, when it came to the point? What if
he tried to talk picturesquely to Erik, in many words of purple and
ultramarine, dripping with light and wading in shadow! There had been
a dream of something like that in his brain when he started out. How
utterly absurd! To bring aid! You might perhaps drive away the
goddess with the closed hands from an artist's door, but that was
certainly the utmost; you could no more help him to create than you
could help him, if he were paralyzed, to lift his little finger by
his own strength. No, not though your heart overflowed with affection
and sympathy and devotion and everything else that was generous. . .
What</p>

<p class="c" align="center">183</p>

<hr>
<p class="l">you ought to do was to mind your own affairs; that was
useful and healthy, but of course it was easier to let your heart run
amuck in a large and generous way. The only trouble was that it was
so lamentably impracticable and so utterly ineffective. Minding your
own affairs and doing it well did not insure you paradise, but at
least you did not have to cast down your eyes before either God or
man.</p>

<p>Opportunity was abundant for Niels to make melancholy reflections
on the impotence of a kind heart, for all that he accomplished was to
keep Erik at home a little more than usual for a month or so.
Nevertheless, he did not care to return to Copenhagen during the hot
season, and as he did not wish to remain a guest indefinitely, he
engaged a room with a family a little above the peasant class, on the
opposite shore of the fjord, so near that he could row over to
Marianelund in fifteen minutes. Now that he was accustomed to the
neighborhood, he would just as lief stay there as any other place,
for he was one of the susceptible people over whom outward
surroundings easily acquire a hold. Besides, his friend and his
cousin Fennimore were there, and that was reason enough, especially
as there was not a human being anywhere else expecting him.</p>

<p>During the trip from Copenhagen, he had carefully thought out his
behavior to Fennimore and how he would show her that he had forgotten
so completely that he did not remember there was anything to forget;
above all, no coldness, but a friendly indifference, a superficial
cordiality, a polite sympathy; that was the proper attitude.</p>

<p>But it was all thrown away.</p>

<p>The Fennimore he met was a different person from</p>

<p class="c" align="center">184</p>

<hr>
<p class="l">the one he had left. She was still lovely; her form was
luxuriant and beautiful as before, and she had the same slow, languid
movements that charmed him in former days, but there was a dreary
thoughtlessness in the expression of her mouth as of one who had
thought too much, and a pitiful, tortured cruelty in her gentle eyes.
He did not understand it at all, but one fact was at least clear, and
that was that she had had other things to think of than remembering
him, and that she was quite callous to any memories he could awaken.
She looked like one who had made her choice and done the worst she
could do with it.</p>

<p>Little by little, he began to spell and put things together, and
one day, when they were walking along the shore, he began to
understand.</p>

<p>Erik was cleaning up his studio, and as they were strolling by the
water, the maid came out with an apron-ful of refuse which she threw
out on the beach. There was a litter of old brushes, fragments of
casts, broken palette knives, bits of oil bottles, and empty paint
tubes. Niels poked the heap with his foot, and Fennimore looked on
with the vague curiosity people often feel in turning over old
rubbish. Suddenly Niels drew his foot away as if something had burned
it, but caught himself as quickly, and gave the pile another
kick.</p>

<p>"Oh, let me see it," begged Fennimore, and put her hand on his arm
as if to stop him. He bent down and pulled out a plaster cast of a
hand holding an egg.</p>

<p>"It must be a mistake," he said.</p>

<p>"Why no, it is broken," she replied quietly, as she took it from
him. "See, the forefinger is gone," she added, pointing, but when she
suddenly became aware that the egg had been cut in two and a yolk
painted inside it</p>

<p class="c" align="center">185</p>

<hr>
<p class="l">with chrome yellow, she blushed, and, bending down, she
slowly and deliberately knocked the hand against a stone, until it
was broken into little bits.</p>

<p>"Do you remember the time it was cast?" Niels asked, in order to
say something.</p>

<p>"I remember that my hand was smeared with green soap so the
plaster should not stick to it. Is that what you were thinking
of?"</p>

<p>"No, I mean the time when Erik passed the cast around at the tea
table. Don't you remember, when it came to your old aunt, how her
eyes filled with tears, and she embraced you with the deepest
compassion and kissed you on the brow, as if some harm had been done
to you?"</p>

<p>"Yes, people are so sensitive."</p>

<p>"No, we all laughed at her, but there was a delicacy in it
nevertheless, although it was so nonsensical."</p>

<p>"Yes, there is much of that nonsensical delicacy in the
world."</p>

<p>"I believe you want to quarrel with me today."</p>

<p>"No, I don't but there is something I want to say to you. You
won't take offence at a little frankness?--Well, then--suppose a man
tells a story that is not very nice in his wife's presence and
perhaps otherwise shows what appears to you a lack of consideration
for her; don't you think it is unnecessary for you then to express
your protest by your emphatic fastidiousness and your exceeding great
chivalry? It is fair to assume that the man knows his own wife best,
and knows that it won't offend or wound her; otherwise he would not
do it. Is not that true?"</p>

<p>"No, it is not true, generally speaking, but in this case, and on
your authority, I don't mind saying yes."</p>

<p class="c" align="center">186</p>

<hr>
<p>"That's right. You may be sure that women are not the ethereal
creatures many a good youth fancies; they are really no more delicate
than men, and not very different from them. Take my word for it,
there has been some filthy clay used in the shaping of them
both."</p>

<p>"Dearest Fennimore! Thank God you don't know what you are saying,
but you are very unjust to women and to yourself. I believe in
woman's purity."</p>

<p>"Woman's purity! What do you mean by woman's purity?</p>

<p>"I mean--that is--"</p>

<p>"You mean--I will tell you; you mean nothing, for that is another
piece of nonsensical delicacy. A woman can't be pure, and isn't
supposed to be--how could she? It is against nature! And do you think
God made her to be pure? Answer me! --No, and ten thousand times no.
Then why this lunacy! Why fling us up to the stars with one hand,
when you have to pull us down with the other! Can't you let us walk
the earth by your side, one human being with another, and nothing
more at all? It is impossible for us to step firmly on the prose of
life when you blind us with your poetic will-o'-the-wisps. Let us
alone! For God's sake, let us alone!"</p>

<p>She sat down and wept.</p>

<p>Niels understood much. Fennimore would have been miserable had she
known how much. Was it not partly the old story of love's holiday
fare which refuses to turn into daily bread, but goes on being
holiday fare, only more tasteless, more insipid, and less nourishing,
day by day? One can't perform a miracle, and the other can't perform
it, and there they sit in their banqueting clothes, careful to smile
the agony of hunger and thirst, while their eyes shrink from each
other, and hatred</p>

<p class="c" align="center">187</p>

<hr>
<p class="l">begins to grow in their hearts. Was not that the first
chapter, and was not the other the equally dreary tale of a woman's
despair at not being able to recover herself after finding out that
the demigod, whose bride she became so joyously, was only an ordinary
mortal? First the despair, the bootless despair, and then the
merciful stupor--that must be the explanation. It seemed to Niels
that he understood everything: the hardness in her, the dreary
humility, and her coarseness, which was the bitterest drop in the
whole goblet. By degrees he came to see also that his delicacy and
deferential homage must oppress and irritate her, because a woman who
has been hurled from the purple couch of her dreams to the pavement
below will quickly resent any attempt to spread carpets over the
stones which she longs to feel in all their hardness. In her first
despair she is not satisfied to tread the path with her feet: she is
determined to crawl it on her knees, choosing the way that is
steepest and roughest. She desires no helping hand and will not lift
her head--let it sink down with its own heaviness, so that she may
put her face to the ground and taste the dust with her tongue!</p>

<p>Niels pitied her with all his heart, but he left her alone as she
desired.</p>

<p>It was hard to look on and not help, to sit apart and dream her
happy, in stupid dreams, or to wait and calculate, with the cold
knowledge of the physician, how long she had to suffer. He told
himself, in this dreary wisdom, that there could be no relief until
her old hope in the fair, gleaming treasures of life had bled to
death and a more sluggish stream had entered her veins, making her
dull enough to forget, blunt enough to accept, and, at last, at last,
coarse enough to rejoice in the thick</p>

<p class="c" align="center">188</p>

<hr>
<p class="l">atmosphere of a bliss many heavens lower than that which
she had meekly hoped and humbly prayed for wings to reach.--He was
full of disgust with all the world when he thought that she, to whom
he had once knelt in adoration, had come to such a pass that she had
been forced to a slave's estate, and stood at the gate shivering with
cold, while he rode past on his high horse with the large coins of
life jingling in his pocket.</p>

<p>One Sunday afternoon, in the latter part of August, Niels rowed
across the fjord. Fennimore was at home alone when he came; he found
her lying on a sofa in the corner room, and very miserable. Her
breath came with that low, monotonous moaning which seems to afford
relief from pain, and she said that she had a frightful headache.
There was no one to help her, for she had given the maid leave to go
home to Hadssund, and soon afterward some one had come and carried
off Erik; she could not understand where they had gone in the rain.
Now she had been lying there for two hours trying to sleep, but it
was impossible, the pain was so bad. She had never had it before, and
it had come on so suddenly--at dinner time there had been nothing the
matter. First it was in the temples, and then it seemed to dig deeper
and deeper and deeper in; now it seemed to be behind her eyes--if it
only was not anything dangerous. She was not used to being ill, and
was very frightened and unhappy.</p>

<p>Niels comforted her as well as he could, telling her to lie still,
close her eyes, and not speak. He found a heavy shawl, which he
wrapped around her feet, fetched vinegar from the buffet, and made a
cold compress, which he laid on her brow. Then he sat down quietly by
the window, and looked out at the rain.</p>

<p class="c" align="center">189</p>

<hr>
<p>From time to time, he stole over to her on tiptoe and changed the
compress without speaking, merely nodding to her, as she looked up at
him gratefully between his hands. Sometimes she wanted to speak, but
he hushed her with a look, shaking his head, and returned to his seat
again.</p>

<p>At last she fell asleep.</p>

<p>One hour passed and another, and she was still sleeping. Slowly
one quarter slipped into the other, while the melancholy daylight
faded, and the shadows in the room waxed larger, as if they were
growing out of the furniture and the walls. Outside the rain fell,
evenly and steadily, blotting out every other sound in its low,
incessant patter.</p>

<p>She was still sleeping.</p>

<p>The fumes of the vinegar and the vanilla scent of the heliotrope,
mingling in a pungent odor like wine, filled the room. Warmed by
their breath, the air covered the gray windowpanes with a dewy film,
which grew denser with the increasing coolness of the evening.</p>

<p>By this time, he was far away in memories and dreams, though a
part of his consciousness still watched over the sleeper and followed
her sleep. Gradually, as the darkness pressed in, his fancy wearied
of feeding these dreams that flickered up and died down, just as the
soil gets tired of bringing forth the same crop again and again; and
the dreams grew feebler, more sterile, and stiffer, losing the
luxuriant details that had entwined them like long shoots of clinging
vines. His thoughts left the distance and came homing back.--How
quiet everything was! Was it not as if they were together, he and
she, on an island of silence rising above the monotonous sea of sound
made by the soft patter of the rain? And their</p>

<p class="c" align="center">190</p>

<hr>
<p class="l">souls were still, calm and safe, while the future seemed
to slumber in a cradle of peace.</p>

<p>Would that it might never awaken, and that all might remain as
now--no more happiness than that of peace, but neither any misery nor
irking unrest! Would that the present might close as a bud closes
around itself, and that no spring would follow!</p>

<p>Fennimore called. She had been lying awake for some time, too
happy in being free from pain to think of speaking. Now she wanted to
get up and light the lamp, but Niels continued to act as physician,
and compelled her to lie still. It was not good for her to get up
yet; he had matches and could easily find the lamp.</p>

<p>When he had lit it, he put it on the flower stand in the corner,
where its milky white globe shone softly veiled by the delicate,
slumbering leaves of an acacia. The room was just light enough so
that they could see each other's face.</p>

<p>He sat down in front of her, and they spoke about the rain and
said how lucky it was that Erik had taken his raincoat, and how wet
poor Trine would be. Then their conversation came to a
standstill.</p>

<p>Fennimore's thoughts were not quite awake yet, and in her weakness
it seemed pleasant to lie thus musing without speaking. Nor was Niels
inclined to talk, for he was still under the spell of the afternoon's
long silence.</p>

<p>"Do you like this house?" Fennimore asked at last.</p>

<p>"Why yes, fairly well."</p>

<p>"Really? Do you remember the furniture at home?"</p>

<p>"At Fjordby? Yes indeed, perfectly."</p>

<p>"You don't know how I love it, and how I long for it sometimes.
The things we have here don't belong to us--they are only rented--and
have no association with</p>

<p class="c" align="center">191</p>

<hr>
<p class="l">anything, and we are not going to live with them any
longer than we stay in this place. You may think it queer, but I
assure you, I often feel lonely here among all these strange pieces
of furniture that stand around here so indifferent and stupid and
take me for what I am without caring the least bit about me. And as I
know they are not going with me--that they will just stand here and
be rented by other people--I can't get fond of them or interested in
them as I should if I knew that my home would always be theirs, and
that whatever came to me of good or ill would come in the midst of
them. Do you think it childish? Perhaps it is, but I can't help
it."</p>

<p>"I don't know what it is, but I have felt it too. When I was left
alone abroad, my watch stopped, and when it came back from the
watchmaker and was going as before, it was--just what you mean. I
liked the feeling; there was something peculiar about it, something
genuinely good."</p>

<p>"Yes indeed! Oh, I should have kissed it, if I had been you."</p>

<p>"Would you?"</p>

<p>"Do you know," she said suddenly, "you have never told me anything
about Erik as a boy? What was he like?"</p>

<p>"Everything that is good and fine, Fennimore. Splendid, brave--a
boy's ideal of a boy, not exactly a mother's or a teacher's ideal,
but the other, which is so much better."</p>

<p>"How did you get along together? Were you very fond of each
other?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I was in love with him, and he didn't mind--that is about
how it was. We were very different. I always wanted to be a poet and
become famous, but what do you suppose he said he wanted to be, one
day when I</p>

<p class="c" align="center">192</p>

<hr>
<p class="l">asked him?--An Indian, a real red Indian with war paint
and all the rest! I remember that I couldn't understand it at all. It
was incomprehensible to me how any one could want to be a
savage--civilized creature that I was!"</p>

<p>"But was it not strange, then, that he should become an artist?"
said Fennimore, and there was something cold and hostile in her tone,
as she asked.</p>

<p>Niels noticed it with a little start. "Not at all," he answered;
"it is really rare that people become artists with the whole of their
nature. And such strong fellows overflowing with vitality like Erik
often have an unutterable longing for what is fine-grained and
delicate: for an exquisite virginal coldness, a lofty sweetness--I
hardly know how to express it. Outwardly they may be robust and
full-blooded enough, even coarse, and no one suspects what strange,
romantic, sentimental secrets they carry about with them, because
they are so bashful--spiritually bashful, I mean--that no pale little
maiden can be more shy about her soul than are these big,
hard-stepping menfolks. Don't you understand, Fennimore, that such a
secret, which can't be told in plain words right out in common
everyday air, may dispose a man to be an artist? And they can't
express it in words, they simply can't; we have to believe that it is
there and lives its quiet life within them, as the bulb lives in the
earth; for once in a while they do send fragrant, delicately tinted
flowers up to the light. Do you understand?-- Don't demand anything
for yourself of this blossoming strength, believe in it, be glad to
nourish it and to know that it is there.--Forgive me, Fennimore, but
it seems to me that you and Erik are not really good to each other.
Can't you make a change? Don't think of who is right or how great the
wrong is, and don't treat him</p>

<p class="c" align="center">193</p>

<hr>
<p class="l">according to his deserts--how would even the best of us
fare if we got our deserts! No, think of him as he was in the hour
when you loved him most; believe me, he is worthy of it. You must not
measure and weigh. There are moments in love, I know, full of bright,
solemn ecstasy, when we would give our lives for the beloved if need
be. Is not that true? Remember it now, Fenni-more, for his sake and
your own."</p>

<p>He was silent.</p>

<p>She said nothing either, but lay very still with a melancholy
smile on her lips, pale as a flower.</p>

<p>Then she half rose and stretched out her hand to Niels. "Will you
be my friend?" she asked.</p>

<p>"I am your friend, Fennimore," and he took her hand.</p>

<p>"Will you, Niels?"</p>

<p>"Always," he replied, lifting the hand to his lips reverently.</p>

<p>When he rose, it seemed to Fennimore that he held himself more
erect than she had ever seen him before.</p>

<p>A little later Trine came in to announce her return, and then
there was tea, and at last the rowing back through the dreary
rain.</p>

<p>Toward morning Erik came home, and when Fennimore saw him by the
cold, truthful light of dawn, preparing to go to bed, heavy and
unsteady with drink, his eyes glazed from gambling and his face
dirty-pale after the sleepless night, then all the fair words Niels
had spoken seemed to her quite visionary. The bright promises she had
made to her own heart fainted and paled before the oncoming
day--vapory dreams and fumes of fancy: a fairy flock of lies!</p>

<p>What was the use of struggling with this weight dragging them both
down? It was futile to lighten it by</p>

<p class="c" align="center">194</p>

<hr>
<p class="l">lies; their life would never have its old buoyancy. The
frost had been there, and the wealth of vines and creepers and
clustering roses and blossoms fairer than roses that had entwined
them had shed every tiny leaf, lost every blossom, and nothing
remained but the tough, naked withes binding them together in an
unbreakable tether. What did it avail that she roused the feelings of
former days to an artificial life by the warmth of memories, that she
put her idol upon its pedestal again, that she called back the light
of admiration to her eyes, the words of adoration to her lips, and
the flush of happiness to her cheeks! What did it all avail, when he
would not take upon himself to be the priest of the idol and so help
her to a pious fraud? He! He did not even remember her love. Not one
of her words echoed in his ears, not one of all their days was hidden
in his soul.</p>

<p>No, dead and cold was the ardent love of their hearts. The
fragrance, the glamor, and the tremulous tones--all had been wafted
away. There they sat, from force of habit, he with his arm around her
waist, she with her head resting on his shoulder, drearily sunk in
silence, forgetting each other; she, to remember the glorious hero he
had never been; he, to transform her in his dreams to the ideal which
he now always saw shining in the sky high above her head. Such was
their life together, and the days came and went without bringing any
change, and day after day they gazed out over the desert of their
lives, and told themselves that it was a desert, that there were no
flowers nor any hope of flowers or springs or green palms.</p>

<p>As the autumn advanced, Erik's drinking bouts became more
frequent. What was the use, he said to Niels, of sitting at home
waiting for ideas that never came, until</p>

<p class="c" align="center">195</p>

<hr>
<p class="l">his thoughts turned to stone in his head? Moreover, he
did not get much comfort from Niels's society, he needed people with
some grit in them, people of lusty flesh and blood, not a whim-wham
of delicate nerves. Niels and Fennimore were therefore left much
alone, for Niels came over to Marianelund every day.</p>

<p>The covenant of friendship they had made and the talk they had had
on that Sunday afternoon put them at their ease with each other, and,
lonely as they both were, they drew closer together in a warm and
tender friendship, which soon gained a strong hold over both. It
absorbed them so that their thoughts, whether they were together or
apart, always turned to this bond, as birds building the same nest
look on everything they gather or pass by with the one pleasant goal
of making the nest snug and comfortable for each other and
themselves.</p>

<p>If Niels came while Erik was away, they nearly always, even on
rainy and stormy days, took long walks in the woods behind the
garden. They had fallen in love with that forest, and grew fonder of
it as they watched the summer life die out. There were a thousand
things to see. First, how the leaves turned yellow and red and brown,
then how they fell off, whirling on a windy day in yellow swarms, or
softly rustling in still air, single leaf after leaf, down against
the stiff boughs and between the pliant brown twigs. And when the
leaves fell from trees and bushes, the hidden secrets of summer were
revealed in nest upon nest. What treasures on the ground and on the
branches, dainty seeds and bright-colored berries, brown nuts,
shining acorns and exquisite acorn cups, tassels of coral on the
barberry, polished black berries</p>

<p class="c" align="center">196</p>

<hr>
<p class="l">on the buckthorn, and scarlet urns on the dogrose. The
bare beeches were finely dotted with prickly beechnuts, and the roan
bent under the weight of its red clusters, acid in fragrance like
apple cider. Late brambleberries lay black and brown among the wet
leaves at the wayside; red whortleberries brought forth their dull
crimson fruit for the second time. The ferns turned all colors as
they faded, and the moss was a revelation, not only the deep,
luscious moss in the hollows and on the slopes, but the faint,
delicate growth on the tree trunks, resembling what one might imagine
the cornfields of the elves to be as it sent forth the finest of
stalks with dark brown buds like ears of corn at the tip.</p>

<p>They scoured the forest from end to end, eager to find all its
treasures and marvels. They had divided it between them as children
do; the part on one side of the road was Fennimore's property, and
that on the other side was Niels's, and they would compare their
realms and quarrel about which was the more glorious. Everything
there had names--clefts and hillocks, paths and stiles, ditches and
pools; and when they found a particular magnificent tree, they gave
that too a name. In this way they took complete possession and
created a little world of their own which no one else knew and no one
else was at home in, and yet they had no secret which all the world
might not have heard.</p>

<p>As yet they had not.</p>

<p>But love was in their hearts, and was not there, as the crystals
are present in a saturated solution, and yet are not present, not
until a splinter or the merest particle of the right matter is thrown
into the solution, releasing the slumbering atoms as if by magic, and
they rush to</p>

<p class="c" align="center">197</p>

<hr>
<p class="l">meet one another, joining and riveting themselves
together according to unsearchable laws, and in the same instant
there is crystal--crystal.</p>

<p>So it was a trifle that made them feel they loved.</p>

<p>There is nothing to tell. It was a day like all other days, when
they were alone together in the sitting room, as they had been a
hundred times before; their conversation was about things of no
moment, and that which happened was outwardly as common and as
everyday-like as possible. It was nothing except that Niels stood
looking out of the window, and Fennimore came over to him and looked
out too. That was all, but it was enough, for in a flash like
lightning, the past and present and future were transformed for Niels
Lyhne by the consciousness that he loved the woman standing by his
side, not as anything bright and sweet and happy and beautiful that
would lift him to ecstasy or rapture--such was not the nature of his
love--but he loved her as something he could no more do without than
the breath of life itself, and he reached out, as a drowning man
clutches, and pressed her hand to his heart.</p>

<p>She understood him. With almost a scream, in a voice full of
terror and agony, she cried out to him an answer and a confession:
"Oh, <i>yes,</i> Niels!" and snatched away her hand in the same
instant. A moment she stood, pale and shrinking, then sank down with
one knee in an upholstered chair, hiding her face against the harsh
velvet of the back, and sobbed aloud.</p>

<p>Niels stood a few seconds as though blinded, groping around among
the bulb glasses for support. It was only for a very few seconds;
then he stepped over to the chair where she was lying, and bent over
without touching her, resting one hand on the back of the chair.</p>

<p class="c" align="center">198</p>

<hr>
<p>"Don't be so unhappy, Fennimore! Look up and let us talk about it.
Will you, or will you not? Don't be afraid! Let us bear it together,
my own love! Come, try if you can't!</p>

<p>She raised her head slightly and looked up at him. "Oh, God, what
shall we do! Isn't it terrible, Niels! Why should such a thing happen
to me? And how lovely it all could have been--so happy!" and she
sobbed again.</p>

<p>"Should I not have spoken?" he moaned. "Poor Fennimore, would you
rather never have known it?"</p>

<p>She raised her head again and caught his hand.</p>

<p>"I wish I knew it and were dead. I wish I were in my grave and
knew it, that would be good--oh, so peaceful and good!"</p>

<p>"It is bitter for us both, Fennimore, that the first thing our
love brings us should be only misery and tears. Don't you think
so?"</p>

<p>"You must not be hard on me, Niels, I can't help it. You can't see
it as I do--I am the one that should be strong, because I am the one
that is bound. I wish I could take my love and force it back into the
most secret depth of my soul and lock it in and be deaf to all its
wailing and its prayers, and then tell you to go far, far away; but I
can't, I have suffered so much, I can't suffer that too--I can't,
Niels. I can't live without you--see, can I? Do you think I can?"</p>

<p>She rose and flung herself on his breast.</p>

<p>"Here I am, and I won't let you go; I won't send you away, while I
sit here alone in the old darkness. It is like a bottomless pit of
loathing and misery. I won't throw myself into it. I would rather
jump into the fjord, Niels. Even if the new life brings other
agonies, at least they are new agonies, and haven't the dull sting of
the old,</p>

<p class="c" align="center">199</p>

<hr>
<p class="l">and can't stab home like the old, which know my heart so
cruelly well. Am I talking wildly? Yes, of course I am, but it is so
good to talk to you without any reserve and without having to be
careful not to say what I have no right to. For now you have the
first right of all! I wish you could take me wholly, so that I could
belong to you utterly and not to any one else at all. I wish you
could lift me out of all relations that hedge me in!"</p>

<p>"We must break through them, Fennimore. I will arrange everything
as well as possible. Don't be afraid! Some day, before any one
suspects anything, we shall be far away."</p>

<p>"No, no, we mustn't run away, anything but that, anything else
rather than have my parents hear their daughter had run away. It is
impossible! I will never do it. By God in heaven, Niels, I will never
do it."</p>

<p>"Oh, but you must, my dearest, you must. Can't you see all the
baseness and ugliness that will rise and close in around us
everywhere, if we stay, all the lies and deceptions that will
entangle us and drag us down? I won't have you besmirched by all
that. I refuse to let it eat into our love like corroding rust."</p>

<p>But she was immovable.</p>

<p>"You don't know what you are condemning us to," he said sadly. "It
would be far better to crush under iron heels now instead of being
merciful. Believe me, Fennimore, we must let our love be everything
to us, the first and only thing in the world, that which must be
saved, even at the cost of stabbing where we would rather heal and
bringing sorrow where we would rather keep every shadow of sorrow far
away. If we don't do that, you will see that the yoke we bend our
necks under now will weigh on us and at last force us to our knees,
unmerci-</p>

<p class="c" align="center">200</p>

<hr>
<p class="l">fully, inexorably.--A fight on our knees, you don't know
how hard that is! Shall we fight the fight anyway, my dearest, side
by side, against everything?"</p>

<p><br>
</p>

<p>For the first few days Niels persisted in his attempts to persuade
her to flight. Then he began to picture to himself what a blow it
would be to Erik if he were to come home one day and find friend and
wife gone away together, and by degrees the whole thing took on an
unnaturally tragic air of the impossible. He accustomed himself not
to think of it, as he did with many other things that he might have
wished different, and threw himself with his whole soul into the
situation as it was, without any conscious attempts to make it over
by dreams or cover its defects with imaginary festoons and garlands.
But, oh, how sweet it was to love for once with the love of real
life; for now he knew that nothing of what he had imagined to be love
was real love, neither the turgid longing of the lonely youth, nor
the passionate yearning of the dreamer, nor yet the nervous
foreboding of the child. These were currents in the ocean of love,
single reflections of its full light, fragments of love as the
meteors rushing through space are splinters of a world--for that was
love; a world complete in itself, fully rounded, vast, and orderly.
It was no medley of confused sensations and moods rushing one upon
another! Love was like nature, ever changing, ever renewing; no
feeling died and no emotion withered without giving life to the seed
of something still more perfect which was imbedded in it. Quietly,
sanely, with full, deep breaths--it was good to love so and love with
all his soul. The days fell bright and new-coined, down from heaven
itself; they no longer followed one upon another as a matter</p>

<p class="c" align="center">201</p>

<hr>
<p class="l">of course like the hackneyed pictures in a peep show.
Every one was a revelation. With each day that passed, he felt
stronger, greater, and nobler. He had never known such strength and
fullness of feeling; there were moments when he seemed to himself
titanic, much more than man, so inexhaustible was the well spring of
his soul, so broad-winged the tenderness that swelled his heart, so
wondrous the sweep of his vision, so infinite the gentleness of his
judgments.</p>

<p>This was the beginning of happiness, and they were happy long.</p>

<p>The daily falsehood and deception and the atmosphere of dishonor
in which they lived had not yet gained power over them, and could not
touch them on those ecstatic heights to which Niels had lifted their
relationship and, with it, themselves. For he was not simply a man
who seduced his friend's wife--or rather, so he told himself
defiantly, he was that man, but he was also the one who saved an
innocent woman whom life had wounded, stoned, and defiled, a woman
who had lain down to let her soul die. This woman he had given back
her confidence in life, her faith in the powers of good; he had
lifted her spirit to noble heights, had given her happiness. What,
then, was best, the old blameless misery or that which he had won for
her? He did not ask, he had made his choice.</p>

<p>He did not quite mean this, if the truth were told. Man often
builds for himself theories in which he refuses to dwell. Thoughts
often run faster than the sense of right and wrong is willing to
follow. Yet the conception was really present in his mind, and it
took away some of the cankerous venom inherent in the craftiness,
falseness, and duplicity of their lives.</p>

<p class="c" align="center">202</p>

<hr>
<p>Yet the evil effects were soon noticeable. The poison was working
on so many fine nerve filaments that it could not but do harm and
cause suffering, and the time was hastened when Erik, shortly after
New Year, announced that he had caught an idea--something with a
green tunic and a threatening attitude, he told Niels. Did he
remember the green in Salvator Rosa's Jonah? Something on that
order.</p>

<p>Although Erik's work consisted chiefly in lying on the couch in
his studio, smoking shag and reading Marryat, it had at least the
effect of keeping him at home for the time being, thereby forcing
them to use more caution and necessitating new lies and
artifices.</p>

<p>Fennimore's ingenuity in this direction was what brought the first
cloud to their heaven. It was scarcely perceptible at first, only a
doubt, light as thistledown, flitting through Niels's mind as to
whether his love were not nobler than the one he loved. It had not
yet taken shape as a thought, it was only a dim foreboding which
pointed in that direction, a vague giving way in his mind, a leaning
to that side.</p>

<p>Yet it came again and brought others in its wake, thoughts at
first vague and indistinct, then clearer and sharper for each time
they appeared. It was astonishing with what furious haste these
thoughts could undermine, debase, and take away the glamor. Their
love was not lessened. On the contrary, it glowed more passionately
while it sank, but these handclasps stolen under table covers, these
kisses snatched in passages and behind doors, these long looks right
under the eyes of him they deceived, took away all the lofty tenor.
Happiness no longer stood still above their heads; they had to filch
her smiles and her light as best they could, and after a while</p>

<p class="c" align="center">203</p>

<hr>
<p class="l">their wiles and cunning were no longer necessary evils,
but amusing triumphs. Deception became their natural element and made
them contemptible and petty. There were degrading secrets, too, over
which they had hitherto grieved separately, assuming ignorance in
each other's eyes, but which they now had to share; for Erik was not
bashful, and would often caress his wife in Niels's presence, kiss
her, take her on his lap, and embrace her, while Fennimore had
neither courage nor dignity sufficient to repel these caresses; the
consciousness of her guilt made her uncertain and afraid.</p>

<p>So it sank and went on sinking, that lofty castle of their love,
from the pinnacles of which they had gazed so proudly out over the
world, and within which they had felt so strong and noble.</p>

<p>Still they were happy among the ruins.</p>

<p>When they walked in the woods now, it was usually on gloomy days,
when the fog hung under the dark branches and thickened between the
wet trunks, so that none should see how they kissed and embraced,
both here and there, and none should hear how their frivolous talk
rang with peals of wanton laughter.</p>

<p>The melancholy of eternity, which had exalted their love, was
gone; now there was nothing but smiles and jests between them. With
feverish haste they snatched greedily at the fleeting seconds of joy,
as though they must hurry in their love and had not a lifetime before
them.</p>

<p>It brought no change when Erik, after a while, grew tired of his
idea and again began his carousing so eagerly that he was rarely at
home for forty-eight hours at a stretch. Where they had fallen, there
they lay. Once in a</p>

<p class="c" align="center">204</p>

<hr>
<p class="l">great while, perhaps, in lonely hours, they gazed
regretfully toward the heights from which they had fallen, or perhaps
they only wondered, and thought what a strain it must have been to
stay on that level, and felt themselves more snugly housed where they
were. There was no change. At least there was no return to the former
days, but the flabby uncleanness of living as they did and not
running away together became more present in their consciousness and
linked them together in a closer and baser union through the common
sense of guilt; for neither of them wished any change in things as
they were. Nor did they pretend to each other that they did, for
there had developed a cynical intimacy between them such as often
exists between fellow criminals, and there was nothing in their
relations that they shrank from putting into words. With sinister
frankness, they called things by their right names and, as they put
it to themselves, faced the facts as they were.</p>

<p><br>
</p>

<p>In February it had seemed that the winter was over, but then
Mother March had come shaking her white mantle with its loose lining,
and snowstorm after snowstorm covered the ground with thick layers.
Then followed calm weather and hard frost, and the fjord settled
under a crust of ice six inches thick, which lay there a long
time.</p>

<p>One evening toward the end of the month, Fennimore was sitting
alone in her parlor after tea and waiting.</p>

<p>The room was brightly illumined; the piano stood open with candles
lit, and the silk shade had been taken from the lamp. The gilded
mouldings caught the light, and the pictures on the walls seemed to
stand out with a kind of</p>

<p class="c" align="center">205</p>

<hr>
<p class="l">vigilance. The hyacinths had been moved from the windows
to the writing table, where they made a mass of delicate colors,
filling the air with a penetrating fragrance that seemed cool in its
purity. The fire in the stove burned with a pleasant subdued
crackle.</p>

<p>Fennimore was walking up and down the room almost as if she were
balancing on a dark red stripe in the carpet. She wore a somewhat
old-fashioned black silk dress with a heavily embroidered edge that
weighed it down and trailed, first on one side, then on the other,
with every step she took.</p>

<p>She was humming to herself and holding with both hands a string of
large pale yellow amber beads that hung from her neck. Whenever she
wavered on the red stripe, she would stop humming, but still grasped
the necklace. Perhaps she was making an omen for herself: if she
could walk a certain number of times up and down without getting off
the red stripe and without letting go with her hands, Niels would
come.</p>

<p>He had been there in the morning, when Erik went away, and had
stayed till late in the afternoon, but he had promised to come again
as soon as the moon was up and it was light enough to see the holes
in the ice on the fjord.</p>

<p>Fennimore had obtained her omen, whatever it was, and stepped over
to the window.</p>

<p>It looked as if there would not be any moon tonight; the sky was
very black, and the darkness must be more intense out there on the
gray-blue fjord than on land where the snow lay. Perhaps it was best
that he did not attempt it. She sat down at the piano with a sigh of
resignation, then got up again to look at the clock. She came back
and resolutely propped up a big book of music</p>

<p class="c" align="center">206</p>

<hr>
<p class="l">before her, but did not play, merely turning the leaves
absentmindedly, lost in her own thoughts.</p>

<p>Suppose, after all, that he was standing on the opposite shore
this very moment, fastening on his skates. He could be here in an
instant 1 She saw him plainly, a little bit out of breath after
skating, and blinking with his eyes against the light on coming from
the darkness outside. He would bring a breath of cold air, and his
beard would be full of tiny little bright drops. Then he would
say--what would he say?</p>

<p>She smiled and glanced down at herself.</p>

<p>And still the moon did not appear.</p>

<p>She went over to the window again and stood gazing out, till the
darkness seemed to be filled before her eyes with tiny white sparks
and rainbow-colored rings. But they were only a vague glimmer. She
wished they would be transformed into fireworks out there, rockets
shooting up in long, long curves and then turning to tiny snakes that
bored their way into the sky and died in a flicker; or into a great,
huge pale ball that hung tremulous in the sky and slowly sank down in
a rain of myriad-colored stars. Look! Look! Soft and rounded like a
curtsy, like a golden rain that curtsied.--Farewell! Farewell! There
went the last one:--Oh, if he would only come! She did not want to
play--and at that she turned to the piano, struck an octave harshly,
and held the keys down till the tones had quite died away, then did
the same again, and again, and yet again. She did not want to play,
did not want to.--She would rather dance! For a moment she closed her
eyes, and in imagination she felt herself whirling through a vast
hall of red and white and gold. How delicious it would be to have
danced and to be hot and tired and drink champagne! Suddenly she
remembered</p>

<p class="c" align="center">207</p>

<hr>
<p class="l">how she and a school friend had concocted champagne from
soda water and eau de cologne, and how sick it had made them when
they drank it.</p>

<p>She straightened herself and walked across the room, instinctively
smoothing her dress as after a dance.</p>

<p>"And now let us be sensible!" she said, took her embroidery and
settled herself in a large armchair near the lamp.</p>

<p>Yet she did not work; her hands sank down into her lap, and soon
she snuggled down into the chair with little lazy movements, fitting
herself into its curves, her face resting on her hand, her dress
wrapped around her feet.</p>

<p>She wondered curiously whether other wives were like her, whether
they had made a mistake and been unhappy and then had loved some one
else. She passed in review the ladies at home in Fjordby, one by one.
Then she thought of Mrs. Boye. Niels had told her about Mrs. Boye,
and she had always been a tantalizing riddle to her--this woman whom
she hated and felt humiliated by.</p>

<p>Erik, too, had once told her that he had been madly in love with
Mrs. Boye.</p>

<p>Ah, if one could know everything about her!</p>

<p>She laughed at the thought of Mrs. Boye's new husband.</p>

<p>All the time, while her thoughts were thus engaged, she was
longing and listening for Niels, and imagined him coming, always
coming out there on the ice. She little guessed that for the last two
hours a tiny black dot had been working its way over the snowy
meadows with a message for her very different from the one she was
expecting from across the fjord. It was only a man in homespun and
greased boots, and now he tapped on the kitchen window, frightening
the maid.</p>

<p class="c" align="center">208</p>

<hr>
<p>It was a letter, Trine said when she came in to her mistress.
Fennimore took it. It was a telegram. Quietly she gave the maid the
receipt and dismissed her; she was not in the least alarmed, for Erik
of late had often telegraphed that he would bring one or two guests
home with him the following day.</p>

<p>Then she read.</p>

<p>Suddenly she turned white and darted wildly from her seat out into
the middle of the room, staring at the door with expectant
terror.</p>

<p>She would not let it come into the house, did not dare to, and
with one bound she threw herself against the door, pressing her
shoulder against it, and turned the key till it cut her hand. But it
would not turn, no matter how hard she tried. Her hand dropped. Then
she remembered that the thing was not here at all--it was far away
from her in a strange house.</p>

<p>She began to shake, her knees would no longer support her, and she
slid along the door to the floor.</p>

<p>Erik was dead. The horses had run away, had overturned the
carriage at a street corner, and hurled Erik with his head against
the wall. His skull had been fractured, and now he lay dead at
Aalborg. That was the way it had happened, and most of this story was
told in the telegram. No one had been with him in the carriage except
the white-necked tutor known as the Arab. It was he who had
telegraphed.</p>

<p>She crouched on the floor moaning feebly, both palms spread out on
the carpet, her eyes staring with a fixed, empty look, as she swayed
helplessly to and fro.</p>

<p>Only a moment ago everything had been light and fragrance around
her, and, however much she tried, she could not instantly put all
this out of her consciousness</p>

<p class="c" align="center">209</p>

<hr>
<p class="l">to admit the inky black night of grief and remorse. It
was not her fault that her mind was still haunted by fitful, dazzling
gleams of love's happiness and love's pleasure; that intense, foolish
desires would force their way out of the whirl, seeking the bliss of
forgetfulness, or trying to stop with a frenzied wrench the revolving
wheel of fortune.</p>

<p>But it soon passed.</p>

<p>In black swarms, from everywhere, dark thoughts came flying like
ravens, lured by the corpse of her happiness, and hacked it beak by
beak, even while the warmth of life still lingered in it. They tore
and slashed and made it hideous and unrecognizable, until the whole
thing was nothing but a carrion of loathing and horror.</p>

<p>She rose and walked about, supporting herself by chairs and tables
like one who is ill. Desperately she looked around for some cobweb of
help, if it were only a comforting glance, a sympathetic pat on the
hand, but her eyes met nothing but the glaring family portraits, all
the strangers who had been witnesses of her fall and her
crime--sleepy old gentlemen, prim-mouthed matrons, and their
ever-present gnome child, the girl with the great round eyes and
bulging forehead. It had acquired memories enough at last, this
strange furniture, the table over there, and that chair, the
footstool with the black poodle dog, and the portiere like a dressing
gown,--she had saturated them all with memories, adulterous memories,
which they now spewed out and flung after her. Oh, it was terrible to
be locked in with all these specters of crime and with herself. She
shuddered at herself; she pointed accusing fingers at herself, at
this dishonored Fennimore who crouched at her feet, she pulled her
dress away from between her imploring hands.</p>

<p class="c" align="center">210</p>

<hr>
<p>Mercy? No, there was no mercy! How could there be mercy before
those dead eyes in the strange town, those eyes which had become
seeing, now that they were glazed in death, and saw how she had
thrown his honor in the mud, lied at his lips, been faithless at his
heart.</p>

<p>She could feel those dead eyes riveted on her; she did not know
whence they came, but they followed her, gliding down her body like
two ice-cold rays. As she looked down, while every thread of the
carpet, every stitch in the footstools, seemed unnaturally clear in
the strong sharp light, she felt something walking about her with the
footsteps of dead men, felt it brushing against her dress so
distinctly that she screamed with terror, and darted to one side. But
it came in front of her like hands and yet not like hands, something
that clutched at her slowly, clutched derisively and triumphantly at
her heart, that marvel of treachery, that yellow pearl of deceit! And
she retreated till she backed up against the table, but it was still
there, and her bosom gave no protection against it; it clutched
through her skin and flesh . . . She almost died of terror, as she
stood there, helplessly bending back over the table, while every
nerve contracted with fear and her eyes stared as if they were being
murdered in their sockets.</p>

<p>Then that passed.</p>

<p>She looked around with a haunted look, then sank down on her knees
and prayed a long time. She repented and confessed, wildly and
unrestrainedly, in growing passion, with the same fanatic
self-loathing that drives the nun to scourge her naked body. She
sought fervently after the most groveling expressions, intoxicating
herself with self-abasement and with a humility that thirsted for
degradation.</p>

<p class="c" align="center">211</p>

<hr>
<p>At last she rose. Her bosom heaved violently, and there was a
faint light in the pale cheeks, which seemed to have grown fuller
during her prayer.</p>

<p>She looked around the room as if she were taking a silent vow.
Then she went into the adjoining room, closed the door after her,
stood still a moment as though to accustom herself to the darkness,
groped her way to the door which opened on the glass enclosed
veranda, and went out.</p>

<p>It was lighter there. The moon had risen, and shone through the
close-packed frozen crystals on the glass; the light came yellowish
through the panes, blue and red through the squares of colored glass
that framed them.</p>

<p>She melted a hole in the ice with her hand and carefully wiped
away the moisture with her handkerchief.</p>

<p>As yet there was no one in sight out on the fjord.</p>

<p>She began to walk up and down in her glass cage. There was no
furniture out there except a settee of cane and bent wood, covered
with withered ivy leaves from the vines overhead. Every time she
passed it, the leaves rustled faintly with the stirring of the air,
and now and then her dress caught a leaf on the floor, drawing it
along with a scratching sound over the boards.</p>

<p>Back and forth she walked on her dreary watch, her arms folded
over her breast, hardening herself against the cold.</p>

<p>He came.</p>

<p>She opened the door with a quick wrench, and stepped out into the
frozen snow in her thin shoes. She had no pity on herself, she could
have gone barefooted to that meeting.</p>

<p>Niels had slowed up at the sight of the black figure against the
snow and was skating toward land with hesitating, tentative
strokes.</p>

<p class="c" align="center">212</p>

<hr>
<p>That stealthy figure seemed to burn into her eyes. Every familiar
movement and feature struck her as a shameless insult, as a boast of
degrading secrets. She shook with hatred; her heart swelled with
curses, and she could scarcely control her anger.</p>

<p>"It is I!" she cried to him jeeringly, "the harlot,
Fenni-more!"</p>

<p>"But for God's sake, sweetheart?" he asked, astonished, as he came
within a few feet of her.</p>

<p>"Erik is dead."</p>

<p>"Dead! When?" He had to step out into the snow with his skates to
keep from falling. "Oh, but tell me!" Eagerly he took a step
nearer.</p>

<p>They were now standing close together, and she had to restrain
herself from striking that pale, distorted face with her clenched
fist.</p>

<p>"I will tell you, never fear," she cried. "He is dead, as I said.
He had a runaway in Aalborg and got his head crushed, while we were
deceiving him here."</p>

<p>"It is terrible!" Niels moaned, pressing his hands to his temples.
"Who could have dreamed--Oh, I wish we had been faithful to him,
Fennimore! Erik, poor Erik!-- I wish I were in his place!" He sobbed
aloud, writhing with pain.</p>

<p>"I hate you, Niels Lyhne!"</p>

<p>"Oh, what does it matter about us?" Niels groaned; "if we could
only get him back! Poor Fennimore!" he said with a change of feeling.
"Never mind me. You hate me, you say? You may well hate me." He rose
suddenly. "Let us go in," he said. "I don't know what I am saying.
Who was it that telegraphed, did you say?"</p>

<p>"In!" Fennimore screamed, infuriated by his failure to notice her
hostility. "In there! Never shall you set your craven, despicable
foot inside that house again.</p>

<p class="c" align="center">213</p>

<hr>
<p>How dare you think of it, you wretch, you false creature, who came
sneaking in here and stole your friend's honor, because it was too
poorly hidden! What, did you not steal it under his very eyes,
because he thought you were honest, you house thief!"</p>

<p>"Hush, hush, are you mad? What is the matter with you! What sort
of language are you using?" He had caught her arm firmly, drawing her
to him, and looked straight into her face in amazement. "You must try
to come to your senses, child," he said in a gentler tone. "You can't
mend matters by slinging ugly words."</p>

<p>She wrenched her arm away with such force that he staggered and
almost lost his uncertain foothold.</p>

<p>"Can't you hear that I hate you!" she screamed shrilly. "And isn't
there so much of a decent man's brain left in you that you can
understand it! How blind I must have been when I loved you, you
patched together with lies, when I had him at my side, who was ten
thousand times better than you. I shall hate and despise you to the
end of my life. Before you came, I was honest, I had never done
anything wicked; but then you came with your poetry and your rubbish
and dragged me down with your lies, into the mud with you. What have
I done to you that you could not leave me alone--I who should have
been sacred to you above all others! Now I have to live day after day
with this shameful blot on my soul, and I shall never meet any one so
base but that I know myself to be baser. All the memories of my
girlhood you have poisoned. What have I to look back on that is clean
and good now! You have tainted everything. It is not only he that is
dead, everything bright and good that has been between us is dead,
too, and rotten. Oh, God help me, is it fair that I can't get any
revenge on you</p>

<p class="c" align="center">214</p>

<hr>
<p class="l">after all you have done? Make me honest again, Niels
Lyhne, make me pure and good again! No, no--but it ought to be
possible to torture you into undoing the wrong you have done. Can you
undo it with lies? Don't stand there and crouch under your own
helplessness. I want to see you suffer, here before my eyes, and
writhe in pain and despair and be miserable. Let him be miserable,
God, do not let him steal my revenge too! Go, you wretch, go! I cast
you off, but be sure that I drag you with me through all the agonies
my hate can call down over you."</p>

<p>She had stretched out her arms menacingly. Now she turned and went
in, and the veranda door rattled softly, as she closed it.</p>

<p>Niels stood looking after her in amazement, almost with disbelief.
That pale, vengeful face seemed to be still there before him, so
strangely ignoble and coarse, all its delicate beauty of contour
gone, as if a rough, barbarous hand had ploughed up all its
lines.</p>

<p>He stumbled cautiously down to the ice and began to skate slowly
toward the mouth of the fjord, with the moonlight in front of him and
the wind in his back. Gradually he increased his speed, as his
thoughts took his attention from the surroundings, till the ice
splinters flew from the runners of his skates and rattled on the
smooth surface, blown along with him by the rising frost wind.</p>

<p>So that was the end! So that was the way he had saved this woman's
soul and lifted it and given it happiness! It was certainly
beautiful, his relation to the dead friend, his childhood friend, for
whom he would have sacrificed his future, his life, his all! He with
his sacrificing and his saving! Let heaven and earth behold in</p>

<p class="c" align="center">215</p>

<hr>
<p class="l">him a man who preserved his life on the heights of honor
without spot or blemish in order not to cast a shadow over the Idea
he served and was called to promulgate.</p>

<p>No doubt that was another of his boastful fancies that his paltry
little life could put spots on the sun of the Idea. Good God, he was
always taking these high and mighty views of himself, it was bred in
his bone. If he could not be anything better, he must at least be a
Judas and call himself Iscariot in grandiose gloom. That sounded like
something. Was he forever going to put on airs as if he were a
responsible minister to the Idea, a member of its privy council,
getting everything concerning humanity at first hand! Would he never
learn to do his duty in barrack service for the Idea with all
simplicity as a private of a very subordinate class?</p>

<p>There were red fires out on the ice, and he skated so near them
that a gigantic shadow shot out for a moment from his feet, turned
forward, and disappeared again.</p>

<p>He thought of Erik and of what kind of friend he had been to Erik.
He! His childhood memories wrung their hands over him; his youthful
dreams covered their heads and wept over him; his whole past stared
after him with a long look full of reproach. He had betrayed it all
for a love as small and mean as himself. There <i>had</i> been
exaltation in this love, but he had betrayed that too.</p>

<p>Whither could he flee to escape these attempts that always ended
in the ditch? All his life had been nothing else, and it would never
be anything else in the future; he knew that and felt it with such
certainty that he sickened at the thought of all this futile
endeavor, and he wished with all his soul that he could run away and
escape this meaningless fate. If only the ice would break</p>

<p class="c" align="center">216</p>

<hr>
<p class="l">under him now as he skated, and all would be over with a
gasp and a spasm in the cold water!</p>

<p>He stopped, exhausted, and looked back. The moon had gone down,
and the fjord stretched long and dark between the white hills on
either side. Then he turned and worked his way back against the wind.
It was very strong now, and he was tired. He skated closer to the
shore to get the shelter of the hills, but, as he struggled thus, he
came on a hole in the ice made by the winds sweeping down from the
hills, and he felt the thin, elastic crust give way under him with a
crackling sound.</p>

<p>Ah, he breathed more easily, in spite of all, when he set foot on
the firm ice again! Under the stimulus of fear, his exhaustion had
almost left him, and he skated on vigorously.</p>

<p><br>
</p>

<p>While he was struggling out there, Fennimore sat in the lighted
room, baffled and miserable. She felt herself cheated out of her
revenge. She hardly knew what she had expected, but it was something
entirely different; she had had a vision of something mighty and
majestic, something of swords and red flames, or--not that, but
something that would sweep her along and lift her to a throne, but
instead it had all turned out so small and paltry, and she had felt
more like a common scold than like one who utters curses. . . .</p>

<p>After all, she had learned something from Niels.</p>

<p><br>
</p>

<p>Early in the morning of the following day, while Niels, overcome
with exhaustion, was still asleep, she left the house.</p>

<p class="c" align="center">217</p>

<hr>
<h2 class="c" align="center">Chapter XII</h2>

<p class="l">FOR the better part of two years Niels Lyhne had roamed
about on the Continent. He was very lonely, without kith or kin or
any close friend of his heart. Yet there was another and greater
loneliness that encompassed him; for however desolate and forsaken a
man may feel when he has no single spot on all this vast earth to
which his affections can cling, which he can bless when the heart
<i>will</i> overflow and yearn for when longing <i>will</i> spread
its wings, there is no existence so lonely that he is utterly alone
if he can only see the fixed bright star of a life goal shining
overhead. But Niels Lyhne had no star. He did not know what to do
with himself and his gifts. It was all very well to have talent if he
could only have used it, but he went about like a painter without
hands. How he envied the people, great and small, who always,
whenever they reached out into life, found a handle to lay hold of;
for he could never find any handle. It seemed as though he could do
nothing but sing over again the old romantic songs, and in truth he
had so far done nothing else. His talent was like something apart in
him, a quiet Pompeii, or a harp that had to be taken out of its
corner. It was not all-pervading, did not run down the street with
him or tingle in his finger tips--not in the least. His talent</p>

<p class="c" align="center">218</p>

<hr>
<p class="l">had no grip on him. Sometimes it seemed to him that he
had been born half a century too late, sometimes that he had come
altogether too early. His talent was rooted in something of the past;
it could not draw nourishment from his opinions, his convictions, and
his sympathies, could not absorb them and give them form. The two
elements seemed always to be gliding apart like water and oil, which
can be shaken together, but can never mix, never become one.</p>

<p>Gradually, as he began to realize this, he sank Into a boundless
dejection and grew inclined to take an ironic, suspicious view of
himself and his whole past. There must be something wrong with him,
he told himself, something incurably wrong in the very marrow of his
being; for surely a man could fuse the varying elements in his own
nature--that he firmly believed.</p>

<p>This was the state of his mind when he settled down, in the month
of September, toward the end of the second year of his exile, on the
shores of Lake Garda, in the little town of Biva.</p>

<p>Not long afterward, the region was hedged about by difficulties
that put a stop to traveling and kept all strangers away. Cholera had
broken out round about Venice and down south in Descensano and in the
north by the Trentino. Under these circumstances, Riva was not
lively, for the hotels had been emptied at the first rumor, and
tourists bound for Italy took another route.</p>

<p>Naturally, the few people who remained drew all the more closely
together.</p>

<p>The most remarkable person among them was a famous opera singer,
whose real name was Madame Odero. Her stage name was far more
celebrated. She and her companion, Niels, and a deaf doctor from</p>

<p class="c" align="center">219</p>

<hr>
<p>Vienna were the only guests at the Golden Sun, the leading hotel
in town.</p>

<p>Niels felt very much attracted to her, and she yielded to that
warmth of manner in him which is often a characteristic of people who
are at strife with themselves and therefore feel the need of
establishing their relations with others on a safe basis.</p>

<p>Madame Odero had lived there for nearly seven months, trying to
recover, by complete rest, from the aftereffects of a throat trouble
that had threatened her voice. Her physician had told her to abstain
for a year from singing and, in order to avoid temptation, from all
music. Not until the year was over would he allow her to attempt to
sing, and then, if no weariness followed, she might consider herself
cured.</p>

<p>Niels acquired a kind of civilizing influence over Madame Odero,
who was a fiery, passionate nature with no fine shades. It had been a
terrible sentence to her when she was condemned to live a whole year
without applause and adoration, and at first she had been in despair,
gazing horror-stricken at the twelve months stretching before her as
upon a deep, black grave into which she was being thrust; but
everybody seemed to think it was unavoidable, and one fine morning
she suddenly fled to Riva. It would have been quite possible for her
to have lived in a livelier and more frequented place, but that was
the very thing she sought to avoid. She felt ashamed, as though she
had been marked with an outward visible blemish, imagining that
people pitied her because of this infirmity, and that they discussed
her among themselves. Therefore she had shunned all society in her
new abode and had lived almost entirely in her rooms, where she
sometimes took revenge on the doors when her voluntary confinement
became unbearable.</p>

<p class="c" align="center">220</p>

<hr>
<p>Now that everybody had left, she appeared again and learned to
know Niels Lyhne, for she was not at all afraid of people
individually.</p>

<p>No one needed to be long in Madame Odero's presence before finding
out whether she liked him or not, for she showed it with sufficient
plainness. What she gave Niels Lyhne to see was very encouraging, and
they had not been alone for many days in the magnificent hotel garden
with its pomegranates and myrtles, with its arbors of blossoming
nerias and its marvelous view, before they were on very friendly
terms.</p>

<p>They were not at all in love with each other, or if they were, it
was not very serious. It was one of the vague, pleasant intimacies
that will sometimes grow up between men and women who are past the
time of early youth when nature flames up and yearns toward an
unknown bliss. It is a kind of waning summer, in which people
promenade decorously side by side, gather themselves into graceful
nosegays, each caressing himself with the other's hand and admiring
himself with the other's eyes. They take out all their store of
pretty secrets, all the exquisite useless trifles people accumulate
like bric-&agrave;-brac of the soul, pass them from hand to hand,
turn them round and hold them up, seeking the most artistic light
effect, comparing and analyzing.</p>

<p>It is, of course, only when life passes in a leisurely way that
such Sunday friendships are possible, and here by the quiet lake
these two had plenty of time. Niels had made a beginning by draping
Madame Odero in a becoming robe of melancholy. At first, she was
several times on the point of tearing the whole thing off and
revealing herself as the barbarian she was, but when she found that
she could wear the drapery with patrician effect, she took her
melancholy as a role, and not only</p>

<p class="c" align="center">221</p>

<hr>
<p class="l">stopped slamming the doors, but sought out the moods and
emotions in herself that might suit her new pose. It was astonishing
how she came to realize that she had actually known herself very
little in the past. Her life had, in fact, been too eventful and
exciting to give her time for exploring herself, and besides she was
only now approaching the age when women who have lived much in the
world and seen much commence to collect their memories, to look back
at themselves and assemble a past.</p>

<p>From this beginning, their intimacy developed quickly and
definitely until they had become quite indispensable to each other.
Each led only a half-hearted existence without the other.</p>

<p>Then it happened one morning, as Niels was starting out for a
sail, that he heard Madame Odero singing in the garden. His first
impulse was to turn back and scold her, but before he could make up
his mind, the boat had carried him out of hearing; the wind tempted
him to a trip to Limone, and he meant to be back by midday. So he
sailed on.</p>

<p>Madame Odero had descended into the garden earlier than usual. The
fresh fragrance that filled the air, the round waves rising and
sinking clear and bright as glass beneath the garden wall, and all
this glory of color everywhere--blue lake and sun-scorched mountains,
white sails flitting across the lake and red flowers arching over her
head--all this and with it a dream she could not forget, which went
on throbbing against her heart . . . She could not be silent, she had
to be a part of all this life.</p>

<p>Therefore she sang.</p>

<p>Fuller and fuller rose the exultant notes of her voice. She was
intoxicated with its beauty, she trembled in a</p>

<p class="c" align="center">222</p>

<hr>
<p class="l">voluptuous sense of its power; and she went on, she
could not stop, for she was borne blissfully along on wonderful
dreams of coming triumphs.</p>

<p>No weariness followed. She could leave, leave at once, shake off
the nothingness of the past months, come out of her hiding and
live!</p>

<p>By midday everything was ready for her departure.</p>

<p>Then, just as the carriages drove up to the door, she remembered
Niels Lyhne. She dived down into her pocket for a paltry little
notebook, and scribbled it full of farewells to Niels, for the pages
were so small that each could hold only three or four words. This she
enclosed in an envelope for him and departed.</p>

<p>When Niels came back in the late afternoon, after being detained
by the sanitary police in Limone, she had long since reached Mori and
taken the train.</p>

<p>He was not surprised, only sorry, and not at all angry. He could
even smile resignedly at this new hostile thrust of fate. But in the
evening, when he sat in the empty moonlit garden telling the
innkeeper's little boy the story about the princess who found her
wings again and flew away from her lover back to the land of fairies,
he was seized with an intolerable longing for Lonborggaard. He
yearned to feel something closing around him like a home and holding
him fast, no matter how. He could not bear the indifference of life
any longer, could not endure being cast off and thrown back on
himself again and again. No home on earth, no God in heaven, no goal
out there in the future! He would at least have a home. He would make
it his own by loving everything there, big and little, every rock,
every tree, the animate and the inanimate; he would portion out his
heart to it all so that it could never cast him off any more.</p>

<p class="c" align="center">223</p>

<hr>
<h2 class="c" align="center">Chapter XIII</h2>

<p class="l">FOR about a year, Niels Lyhne had lived at
L&ouml;n-borggaard, managing the farm as well as he knew how and as
much as his old steward would let him. He had taken down his shield,
blotted out his 'scutcheon, and resigned. Humanity would have to get
along without him; he had learned to know the joy found in purely
physical labor, in seeing the pile growing under his hand, in being
able to get through with what he was doing so that he really
<i>was</i> through, in knowing that when he went away tired the
strength that he had used up lay behind him in his work, and the work
would stand and not be eaten up by doubt in the night or dispersed by
the breath of criticism on the morning after. There were no Sisyphus
stones in agriculture.</p>

<p>What joy it was, too, when he had worked till he was tired, to go
to bed and gather strength in sleep and to spend it again, as
regularly as day and night followed one upon the other, never
hindered by the caprices of his brain, never having to handle himself
gingerly like a tuned guitar with loose pegs.</p>

<p>He was really happy in a quiet way, and often he would sit, as his
father had sat, on a stile or a boundary stone, staring out over the
golden wheat or the topheavy oats, in a strange, vegetative
trance.</p>

<p class="c" align="center">224</p>

<hr>
<p>As yet he had not begun to seek the society of the neighboring
families, except Councillor Skinnerup's in Varde, whom he visited
quite frequently.</p>

<p>The Skinnerups had come to town while his father was still living,
and as the Councillor was an old university friend of Lyhne's, the
two families had seen much of each other. Skinnerup, a mild,
baldheaded man with sharp features and kind eyes, was now a widower,
but his house was more than filled by his four daughters, the eldest
seventeen, the youngest twelve years old.</p>

<p>The Councillor had read much, and Niels enjoyed a chat with him on
various esthetic subjects, for though he had learned to use his
hands, that, of course, did not turn him into a country bumpkin all
at once. He was rather amused sometimes at the almost absurd care he
had to exercise whenever the conversation turned to a comparison
between Danish and foreign literature and, in fact, whenever Denmark
was measured against something not Danish. Caution was absolutely
necessary, however, for the mild-mannered Councillor was one of the
fierce patriots, occasionally met with in those days, who might
grudgingly admit that Denmark was not the greatest of the world
powers, but when so much was said would not subscribe to a jot or a
tittle more that might place his country or anything pertaining to it
anywhere but in the lead.</p>

<p>These conversations had another charm, which Niels felt at first
vaguely and without consciously thinking of it, in the look of
delighted admiration with which seventeen-year-old Gerda's eyes
followed him as he spoke. She always managed to be present when he
came, and would listen so eagerly that he often saw her flushing</p>

<p class="c" align="center">225</p>

<hr>
<p class="l">with rapture when he said something that seemed to her
especially beautiful.</p>

<p>The truth was, he had unwittingly become this young lady's ideal,
at first chiefly because he often rode into town wearing a gray
mantle of a very foreign and romantic cut, then because he always
said Milano instead of Milan, and finally because he was alone in the
world and had rather a sad countenance. There were certainly a great
many ways in which he differed from the rest of the people in Varde
and in Ringkj&ouml;bing too.</p>

<p><br>
</p>

<p>On a hot summer day, Niels came through the narrow street behind
the Councillor's garden. The sun was pouring down over the brick-red
little houses, and the ships lying out on the sound had mats hung
over their sides to prevent the tar from melting and oozing out of
the seams. Round about him everything was open to admit a coolness
which did not exist. Within the open doors, the children were reading
their lessons aloud, and the hum of their voices mingled with that of
the bees in the garden, while a flock of sparrows hopped silently
from tree to tree, all flying up together and coming down
together.</p>

<p>Niels entered a little house right behind the garden, and while
the woman went to bring her husband from the neighbor's, he was left
alone in a spotless little room smelling of gillyflowers and freshly
ironed linen.</p>

<p>When he had examined the pictures on the walls, the two dogs on
the dresser, and the sea shells on the lid of the work box, he
stepped over to the open window, whence he heard the sound of Gerda's
voice, and there were the four Skinnerup girls on the Councillor's
bleaching green only a few steps away.</p>

<p class="c" align="center">226</p>

<hr>
<p>The balsamines and other flowers in the window hid him, and he
prepared himself both to listen and to look.</p>

<p>It was clear that a quarrel was going on, and the three younger
sisters were making common cause against Gerda. All carried whips of
lemon-yellow withes. The youngest had formed three or four of them
into rings wound around with red bark, and had put them on her head
like a turban.</p>

<p>It was she who was speaking.</p>

<p>"She says he looks like Themistocles on the stove in the study,"
she remarked to her fellow conspirators, and turned up her eyes with
a rapt expression.</p>

<p>"Oh, pshaw," said the middle one, a saucy little lady who had just
been confirmed that spring; "do you suppose Themistocles was
round-shouldered?" She imitated Niels Lyhne's slight stoop.
"Themistocles! Not much!"</p>

<p>"There is something so manly in his look; he is a real man!"
quoted the twelve-year-old.</p>

<p>"He!" came the voice of the middle one again. "Why, he goes and
pours eau de cologne on himself. The other day his gloves were lying
there and just simply reeking with millefleur."</p>

<p><i>&gt;"Every</i> perfection!" breathed the twelve-year-old in
ecstasy, and staggered back as though overcome with emotion.</p>

<p>They addressed all these remarks to each other and pretended not
to notice Gerda, who stood at a little distance, blushing furiously,
as she poked the ground with her yellow stick. Suddenly she lifted
her head.</p>

<p>"You're a pair of naughty hussies," she said, "to talk like that
about some one who is too good to look at you."</p>

<p class="c" align="center">227</p>

<hr>
<p>"And yet you know he is <i>only</i> a mortal," remonstrated the
eldest of the three mildly, as if to make peace.</p>

<p>"No, he is <i>nothing</i> of the kind."</p>

<p>"And <i>surely</i> he has his faults," continued the sister,
pretending not to hear what Gerda said.</p>

<p>"No!"</p>

<p>"But, my dear Gerda, you <i>know</i> he never goes to church."</p>

<p>"What should he go there for? He knows <i>ever</i> so much more
than the pastor."</p>

<p>"Yes, but unfortunately he doesn't believe in any God <i>at
all,</i> Gerda."</p>

<p>"Well, you can be mighty sure, my dear, that if he doesn't, he has
<i>excellent</i> reasons for it."</p>

<p>"Why, Gerda, how can you say such a thing!"</p>

<p>"You'd almost think--" broke in the middle one.</p>

<p>"What would you almost think?" snapped Gerda.</p>

<p>"Nothing, nothing at all. Please don't bite me!" replied the
sister with a sudden air of great meekness.</p>

<p>"Now will you tell me this minute what you meant!"</p>

<p>"No, no, no, no, no; I guess I've a right to hold my tongue if I
want to."</p>

<p>She walked off together with the twelve-year-old, each with her
arm around the other's shoulder in sisterly concord. The eldest
followed them, strutting with indignation.</p>

<p>Gerda, left alone, stood looking defiantly straight ahead, while
she cut the air with her yellow stick.</p>

<p>There was a moment of silence, and then the thin voice of the
twelve-year-old floated up from the other end of the garden,
singing:</p>

<blockquote>"You ask me, my lad,<br>
What I want with the withered flower--"</blockquote>

<p class="c" align="center">228</p>

<hr>
<p class="l">Niels understood their teasing perfectly, for he had
recently made Gerda a present of a book with a dried vine leaf from
the garden in Verona which contains Juliet's grave. He could hardly
keep from laughing; but just then the woman returned with her
husband, whom she had at last found, and Niels had to give the order
for the carpenter work he had come to see about.</p>

<p>From that day Niels observed Gerda more closely, and every time he
saw her he felt more keenly how sweet and fine she was. As time went
on, his thoughts turned more and more frequently to this confiding
little girl.</p>

<p>She was very lovely, with the tender, appealing beauty that almost
brings tears to the eyes. Her figure, in its early ripening, retained
something of the child's round-ness, which gave an air of innocence
to her luxuriant womanhood. The small, softly moulded hands were
losing the rosy color of adolescence, and were without any of the
restless, nervous curiosity often seen at that age. She had a strong
little neck, cheeks that were rounded with a large, full line, and a
low, dreamy little woman's forehead, where great thoughts were
strangers and almost seemed to hurt when they came, bringing a frown
to the thick brows. And her eyes--how deep and blue they lay there,
but deep only as a lake where one can see the bottom; and in the soft
corners the smile brooded happily under lids that were lifted in slow
surprise. This was the way she looked, little Gerda, white and pink
and blonde, with all her short, bright hair demurely gathered into a
knot.</p>

<p>They had many a talk, Niels and Gerda, and he fell more and more
in love with her. Open and frank and chivalrous was his regard, until
a certain day there came a change in the air about them, a gleam of
that which is</p>

<p class="c" align="center">229</p>

<hr>
<p class="l">too imponderable to be called sensuousness and yet is of
the senses, that which impels the hand and mouth and eyes to reach
out for what the heart cannot get close enough to its own heart. And
another day, not long after, Niels went to Gerda's father, because
Gerda was so young, and because he was so sure of her love. And her
father said yes, and Gerda said yes. In the spring they were
married.</p>

<p class="c" align="center">* * * *</p>

<p>It seemed to Niels Lyhne that existence had grown wonderfully
clear and uncomplicated, that life was simple to live and happiness
as near and easy to win as the air he drew in with his breath.</p>

<p>He loved her, the young wife he had won, with all the delicacy of
thought and feeling, with all the large, deep tenderness of a man who
knows the tendency of love to sink and believe in the power of love
to rise. How he guarded this young soul which bent toward him with
infinite trust and pressed up against him in caressing faith, in
implicit reliance that he would do her nothing but good, as the ewe
lamb in the parable must have felt toward its shepherd when it ate
from his hand and drank of his cup! He had no heart to take her God
away from her or to banish all those white hosts of angels that fly
singing through the heavens all day and come to earth at eventide and
spread their wings from bed to bed, watching faithfully and filling
the darkness of night with a protection wall of invisible light. He
shrank from allowing his own heavier, imageless view of life to come
between her and the soft blue of the heavens and make her feel uneasy
and forsaken.</p>

<p>But she would have it otherwise. She wanted to share</p>

<p class="c" align="center">230</p>

<hr>
<p class="l">everything with him; there must be no place in heaven or
on earth where their ways were parted. Say what he would to hold her
back, she met it all, if not with the words of the Moabite woman, yet
with the same obstinate thought that lay in the words--thy people
shall be my people, and thy God my God.</p>

<p>Then he began to teach her in earnest. He explained to her that
all gods were the work of men and, like everything else made by men,
could not endure eternally, but must pass away, generation after
generation of gods--because humanity is everlastingly developing and
growing beyond its own ideals. A god on whom the noblest and greatest
of men could not lavish the richest gifts of their spirit, a god that
did not take his light from men, but had to give light by virtue of
his own being, a god that was not developing but stiffened in the
historic plaster of dogmas, was no longer a god, but an idol.
Therefore Judaism was right against Baal and Astarte, and
Christianity was right against Judaism, for an idol is nothing in the
world. Humanity had gone on from god to god, and therefore Christ
could say, on the one hand, looking toward the old God, that He had
not come to destroy the law, but to fulfill it, while on the other
hand He could point beyond Himself to a yet higher ideal with those
mystical words about the sin that shall not be forgiven, the sin
against the Holy Ghost.</p>

<p>He went on to teach her how the belief in a personal God who
guides everything for the best and who punishes and rewards beyond
the grave is a running away from the harsh realities of life, an
impotent attempt to take the sting from its arbitrariness. He showed
her that it must blunt compassion and make people less ready to exert
all their powers in relieving misery, since they</p>

<p class="c" align="center">231</p>

<hr>
<p class="l">could soothe themselves with the thought that suffering
in this brief earthly life paved the way for the sufferer to an
eternity of glory and joy.</p>

<p>He laid stress on the strength and self-reliance mankind would
gain when men had learned faith in themselves, and when the
individual strove to bring his life into harmony with what seemed to
him, in his best moments, the highest that dwelt in him, instead of
seeking it outside of himself in a controlling deity. He made his
faith as beautiful and blessed as he could, but he did not conceal
from her how crushingly sad and comfortless the truth of atheism
would seem in the hour of sorrow compared to the old fair, happy
dream of a Heavenly Father who guides and rules. Yet she was brave.
It is true, many of his doctrines, and often those he had least
expected to affect her, would shake her to the innermost depths of
her soul, but her faith knew no bounds; her love carried her with him
away from all heavens, and she believed because she loved. Then,
after a while, when the new ideas had grown familiar and homelike,
she became intolerant in the highest degree and fanatical, as young
disciples always are who love their master intensely. Niels often
reproached her for it, but that was the one thing she could never
understand--that when their belief was true, that of others should
not be horrible and reprehensible.</p>

<p>For three years they lived happily together, and much of this
happiness shone from a baby face, the face of a little boy who had
been born to them in the second year of their marriage.</p>

<p>Happiness usually makes people good, and Niels strove earnestly to
make their lives so beautiful, noble, and useful that there should
never be any pause in the</p>

<p class="c" align="center">232</p>

<hr>
<p class="l">growth of their souls toward the human ideal in which
they both believed. But he no longer thought of carrying the standard
of his ideal out into the world; he was content to follow it. Once in
a while, he would take out some of his old attempts, and then he
would always wonder if it was really he who had written these pretty,
artistic tilings. His own verses invariably brought tears to his
eyes, but he would not for anything in the world have changed places
with the poor fellow who wrote them.</p>

<p>Suddenly, in the spring, Gerda fell ill and could not recover.</p>

<p>Early one morning--it was the last--Niels was sitting up with her.
The sun was about to rise and cast a red glow on the white shade
curtains, although the light coming in on either side was still blue,
making blue shadows in the folds of the white bedspread and under
Gerda's pale, thin hands, which lay clasped before her on the sheet.
Her cap had slipped off, and, as her head lay far back on the pillow,
her features, sharpened and refined by suffering, had an unfamiliar
and strangely distinguished air. She moved her lips as if to moisten
them, and Niels reached for a glass holding a dark red liquid, but
she shook her head faintly. Then suddenly she turned her face to him
and gazed anxiously into his mournful countenance. As she looked at
the deep sorrow his face revealed and the despair it could not hide,
her uneasy foreboding gradually changed to a terrible certainty.</p>

<p>She struggled to rise, but could not.</p>

<p>Niels bent over her quickly, and she caught his hand.</p>

<p>"Is it death?" she asked, lowering her weak voice as if she could
not bear to speak the words.</p>

<p class="c" align="center">233</p>

<hr>
<p>He could only look at her, while his breath came in a deep,
moaning sigh.</p>

<p>Gerda clutched his hand and threw herself over to him in her fear.
" I don't dare to," she said.</p>

<p>He slid down on his knees by the bed and put his arm under the
pillow so that he almost held her to his breast. He could hardly see
her for the tears that blinded him as they coursed down his cheeks
one after another, and he lifted her hand with a corner of the sheet
to his eyes. Then he mastered his voice. "Tell me everything, Gerda
dear; never mind me. Would you like to have the pastor come?" He
could hardly believe it was that, and there was a note of doubt in
his voice.</p>

<p>She did not answer, but closed her eyes and drew her head back a
little as if to be alone with her thoughts.</p>

<p>A few minutes passed. The soft, long-drawn whistle of a blackbird
sounded underneath the windows; then another whistle and another; a
whole series of flutelike notes shot through the silence of the
room.</p>

<p>Then she looked up again. "If you were with me," she said, and she
leaned more heavily on the pillow that he supported. There was a
caress in her movement, and he felt it. "If you were with me! But
alone!"</p>

<p>She drew his hand toward her feebly and dropped it again. "I don't
dare to." Her eyes were full of fear. "You must fetch him, Niels, I
don't dare to come up there alone like this. We had never thought
that I should die first; it was always you who went before. Yes, I
know-but suppose, after all, we have been mistaken; we <i>might</i>
have been mistaken, Niels, mightn't we? You don't think so, but it
would be strange if <i>everybody</i> should be wrong, and if there
wasn't anything at all--those big churches and the bells when they
bury people--I have always been</p>

<p class="c" align="center">234</p>

<hr>
<p class="l">so fond of the bells." She lay quite still as if she
were listening for them and could hear them.</p>

<p>"It is impossible, Niels, that it should all be over, when we die.
You don't feel it, you who are well, you think it must kill us quite,
because we are so weak, and everything seems to pass away, but it is
only the world outside, within us there is as much soul as before. It
is there, Niels; I have it all within me, everything that has been
given me, the same infinite world, but more quiet, more alone with
myself, as when you close your eyes. It is just like a candle, Niels,
that is being carried away from you into the darkness, into the
darkness, and it seems to you fainter and fainter and fainter, and
you can't see it, but still it is shining over there where it is--far
away. I always thought I should live to be such an old, old woman,
and that I should stay here with you all, and now they won't let me,
they are taking me away from the house and home and making me go all
alone. I am afraid, Niels, that where I am going it is God who rules,
and He cares nothing for our cleverness here on earth. He wants His
own way and nothing else, but somehow everything of His is so far
away from me. I have not done anything very wicked, have I? But it
isn't that ... Go and get the pastor, I want him so much."</p>

<p>Niels rose and went for the pastor at once; he was grateful that
this had not come at the very last moment.</p>

<p>The pastor came and was left alone with Gerda.</p>

<p>He was a handsome, middle-aged man with finely cut, regular
features and large brown eyes. He knew, of course, Niels Lyhne's
attitude to the church, and now and then some expressions of
hostility that sprang from the young wife's fanaticism had been
reported to him; but he never for a moment thought of speaking to
her</p>

<p class="c" align="center">235</p>

<hr>
<p class="l">as to a heathen or an apostate, for he understood
perfectly that it was only her love that had led her astray, and he
also understood the feeling that impelled her, now that love could no
longer follow her, to seek reconciliation with the God she had once
known. Therefore he tried in his talk with her to wake her dormant
memories by reading to her the passages from the Gospels and the
hymns that he thought would be most familiar to her.</p>

<p>He was not mistaken.</p>

<p>The words woke intimate and solemn echoes in her soul like the
pealing of bells on Christmas morning. Instantly there was spread
before her eyes the land where our fancy is first of all at home,
where Joseph dreamed and David sang, and where the leader stands that
reaches from earth to heaven. It lay there with figs and mulberries,
and the Jordan gleamed like clearest silver in the morning mist;
Jerusalem stood red and somber under the setting sun; but over
Bethlehem there was always glorious night with great stars in the
deep blue vault. How her childhood faith welled up once more! She was
again the little girl who went to church clinging to her mother's
hand and sat there shivering with cold and wondering why people
sinned so much. Then she grew to full stature again under the lofty
words of the Sermon on the Mount, and she lay there like a prostrate
sinner while the pastor spoke of the sacred mysteries of baptism and
of holy communion. At last the true longing arose in her heart, the
meek kneeling before the omnipotent and judging God, the bitter tears
of remorse before the betrayed and reviled and tortured God, and the
humbly audacious desire for the new covenant of wine and bread with
the hidden God.</p>

<p class="c" align="center">236</p>

<hr>
<p>The pastor left her. Toward noon he came back and gave her the
sacrament.</p>

<p>Her strength waned in a fitful flicker; yet at dusk, when Niels
took her in his arms for the last time to say farewell before the
shadows of death approached too near, she was fully conscious. But
the love that had been the purest joy of his life died out of her
eyes; she was no longer his; even now her wings were growing, and she
yearned only for her God.</p>

<p>At midnight she died.</p>

<p>They were dreary months that followed. Time seemed to swell up
into something enormous and hostile; every day was an unending desert
of emptiness, every night a hell of memories. The summer was almost
over before the rushing, frothing torrent of his grief had hollowed
out a river bed in his soul where it could flow in a turgid,
murmuring stream of sadness and longing.</p>

<p>Then it happened one day that he came home from the fields and
found his little boy very ill. The child had been ailing for the last
few days and had been restless in the night, but no one had believed
it to be anything serious; now he lay in his little bed hot and cold
with fever and moaning with pain.</p>

<p>The carriage was instantly sent to Varde for a physician, but none
of the doctors were at home, and it had to wait for hours. At bedtime
it had not yet returned.</p>

<p>Niels sat by the child's cot. Every half hour or oftener he would
send some one out to listen and look for the carriage. A mounted
messenger was also dispatched to meet it, but he failed to see any
carriage and rode all the way to Varde.</p>

<p>This waiting for help that did not come made it all</p>

<p class="c" align="center">237</p>

<hr>
<p class="l">the more agonizing to watch the suffering of the sick
child. The malady made rapid progress. Toward eleven the first attack
of convulsions set in, and after that they came again and again at
shorter and shorter intervals.</p>

<p>A little after one, the mounted messenger returned, saying that
the carriage could not be expected for some hours yet, as none of the
doctors had been at home when he rode out of town.</p>

<p>Then Niels broke down. He had fought against his despair as long
as there was any hope, but now he could fight no more. He went into
the dark parlor adjoining the sick room and stared out through the
dusky panes, while his nails dug into the wood of the casement. His
eyes seemed to burrow into the darkness for some hope; his brain
crouched for a spring up toward a miracle; then suddenly all was
still and clear for an instant, and in the clearness he turned away
from the window to a table standing there, threw himself over it, and
sobbed without tears.</p>

<p>When he came into the sick room again, the child was in
convulsions. He looked at it as if he would stab himself to death
with the sight: the tiny hands, clenched and white, with bluish
nails, the staring eyes turning in their sockets, the distorted
mouth, and the teeth grinding with a sound like iron on stone--it was
terrible, and yet that was not the worst. No, but when the
convulsions ceased and the body grew soft again, relaxing with the
happy relief of lessened pain, then to see the terror that came into
the child's eyes when it felt the first faint approach of the
convulsions returning, the growing prayer for help when the pain came
nearer and yet nearer--to see this and not be able to help, not with
his heart's blood, not with all he possessed! He lifted his clenched
hands</p>

<p class="c" align="center">238</p>

<hr>
<p class="l">threateningly to heaven, he caught up his child in a mad
impulse of flight, and then threw himself down on the floor on his
knees, praying to the Lord Who is in heaven, Who keeps the earth in
fear through trials and chastisements, Who sends want and sickness,
suffering and death, Who demands that every knee shall bend to Him in
trembling, from Whom no flight is possible--either at the uttermost
ends of the ocean or in the depths of the earth--He, the God Who, if
it pleases Him, will tread the one you love best under His foot,
torture him back into the dust from which He himself created him.</p>

<p>With such thoughts, Niels Lyhne sent prayers up to God; he threw
himself down in utter abandonment before the heavenly throne,
confessing that His was the power and His alone.</p>

<p>Still the child suffered.</p>

<p>Toward morning, when the old family physician drove in through the
gate, Niels was alone.</p>

<p class="c" align="center">239</p>

<hr>
<h2 align="center">Chapter XIV</h2>

<p class="l">AUTUMN had come; there were no flowers any more on the
graves up there in the churchyard, and the fallen leaves lay brown
and moldering on the wet ground under the trees of
L&ouml;nborggaard.</p>

<p>Niels Lyhne went about in the empty rooms in bitter despondency.
Something had given way in him the night the child died. He had lost
faith in himself, lost his belief in the power of human beings to
bear the life they had to live. Existence had sprung a leak, and its
contents were seeping out through all the cracks without plan or
purpose.</p>

<p>It was of no avail that he called the prayer he had prayed a
father's frenzied cry for help for his child, even though he knew
none could hear his cry. He had known well what he did even in the
depths of his despair. He had been tempted and had fallen; for it was
a fall, a betrayal of himself and his ideal. No doubt tradition had
been too strong in his blood. Humanity had cried to heaven in its
agony for many thousands of years, and he had yielded to it, for he
knew with the innermost fibers of his brain that gods were dreams,
and he knew that when he threw himself into the arms of his fancies,
that they <i>were</i> fancies. He had not been able to bear life
as</p>

<p class="c" align="center">240</p>

<hr>
<p class="l">it was. He had taken part in the battle for the highest,
and in the stress of the fight he had deserted the banner to which he
had sworn allegiance; for after all, the new ideal, atheism, the
sacred cause of truth--what did it all mean, what was it all but
tinsel names for the one simple thing: to bear life as it was! To
bear life as it was and allow life to shape itself according to its
own laws!</p>

<p>It semed to him as though his life had ended in that night of
agony. What came after was no more than meaningless scenes tacked on
after the fifth act when the action was already finished. He could,
of course, take up his old principles again, if he felt so inclined,
but he had once fallen the fall, and whether or not he would fall
again mattered absolutely nothing.</p>

<p>This was the mood that possessed him most frequently.</p>

<p>Then came the November day when the King died, and war seemed more
imminent.</p>

<p>He soon arranged his affairs in L&ouml;nborggaard and enlisted as
a volunteer.</p>

<p>The monotony of training was easy to bear, for it seemed wonderful
only to know that he was no longer superfluous, and when he was
assigned to active service, the everlasting fight against cold,
vermin, and discomforts of every kind drove his thoughts home and
kept them from going farther afield than to what was right before his
door. He grew almost cheerful over it, and his health, which had
suffered under the griefs of the past year, was fully restored.</p>

<p>On a gloomy day in March he was shot in the chest.</p>

<p>Hjerrild, who was a physician in the hospital, had him put into a
small room where there were only four beds. One of the men in there
had been shot in the spine and lay quite still. Another was wounded
in the breast and</p>

<p class="c" align="center">241</p>

<hr>
<p class="l">lay talking deliriously for hours at <i>a</i> time in
quick, abrupt phrases. The third, who lay nearest Niels, was a great,
strong peasant lad with fat, round cheeks; he had been struck in the
brain by a fragment of a shell, and incessantly, hour after hour,
about every half minute, he would lift his right arm and his right
leg simultaneously and then let them fall again, accompanying his
movements with a loud but dull and hollow "Hah-ho!" always in the
same measure, always exactly the same, "Hah" when he lifted his
limbs, "ho" when he let them fall.</p>

<p>There Niels Lyhne lay. The bullet had entered his right lung and
had not come out again. In war not much circumlocution can be used,
and he was told he had but little chance of life.</p>

<p>He was surprised; for he did not feel as though he were dying, and
his wound did not pain him much. But soon a faintness came over him
and warned him that the doctor was right.</p>

<p>So this was the end. He thought of Gerda, he thought of her
constantly the first day, but he was always disturbed by the strange,
cool look in her eyes the last time he had taken her in his arms. How
beautiful it would have been, how poignantly beautiful, if she had
clung to him to the very last and had sought his eye till her own was
glazed in death; if she had been content to breathe out her life upon
the heart that loved her so well instead of turning away from him at
the last moment to save herself over into more life and yet more
life!</p>

<p>On the second day in the hospital, Niels felt more and more
oppressed by the heavy atmosphere in the room, and his longing for
fresh air was strangely interwined in his mind with the desire to
live. After all, there had been so much in life that was beautiful,
he</p>

<p class="c" align="center">242</p>

<hr>
<p class="l">thought, as he remembered the fresh breeze along the
shore at home, the cool soughing of the wind in the beech forests of
Sjaslland, the pure mountain air of Clarens, and the evening zephyrs
of Lake Garda. But when he began to think of human beings, his soul
sickened again. He summoned them in review before him, one by one,
and they all passed and left him alone, and not one stayed with him.
But how far had he held fast to them? Had he been true? He had only
been slower in letting go, that was all. No, it was <i>not</i> that.
It was the dreary truth that a soul is always alone. Every belief in
the fusing of soul with soul was a lie. Not your mother who took you
on her lap, nor your friend, nor yet the wife who slept on your heart
....</p>

<p>Toward evening, inflammation set in, and the pain of his wound
increased.</p>

<p>Hjerrild came and sat by him for a few minutes in the evening, and
at midnight he returned and stayed a long time. Niels was suffering
intensely and moaned with pain.</p>

<p>"A word in all seriousness, Lyhne," said Hjerrild. "Do you want to
see a clergyman?"</p>

<p>"I have no more to do with clergymen than you have," Niels
whispered angrily.</p>

<p>"Never mind me! I am alive and well. Don't lie there and torture
yourself with your opinions. People who are about to die have no
opinions, and those they have don't matter. Opinions are only to live
by--in life they can do some good, but what does it matter whether
you die with one opinion or another? See here, we all have bright,
tender memories from our childhood; I have seen scores of people die,
and it always comforts them to bring back those memories. Let us be
honest! No matter what we</p>

<p class="c" align="center">243</p>

<hr>
<p class="l">call ourselves, we can never quite get that God out of
heaven; our brain has fancied Him up there too often, the picture has
been rung into it and sung into it from the time we were little
children."</p>

<p>Niels nodded.</p>

<p>Hjerrild bent down to catch his words if he wished to say
anything.</p>

<p>"You are very good," Niels whispered, "but"--and he shook his head
decisively.</p>

<p>The room was still a long time except for the peasant lad's
everlasting "Hah-ho!" hammering the hours to pieces.</p>

<p>Hjerrild rose. "Good-by, Lyhne," he said. "After all, it is a
noble death to die for our poor country."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Niels, "and yet this is not the way we dreamed of
doing our part that time long, long ago."</p>

<p>Hjerrild left him. When he came into his own room, he stood a long
while by the window looking up at the stars.</p>

<p>"If I were God," he said under his breath, and in his thoughts he
continued, "I would much rather save the man who was converted at the
last moment."</p>

<p>The pain in Niels's wound grew more and more intense; it tore and
clutched at his breast, it persisted without mercy. What a relief it
would have been if he had had a god to whom he could have moaned and
prayed!</p>

<p>Toward morning he grew delirious, the inflammation was progressing
rapidly.</p>

<p>So it went on for two more days and two more nights.</p>

<p>The last time Hjerrild saw Niels Lyhne he was babbling of his
armor and of how he must die standing.</p>

<p>And at last he died the death--the difficult death.</p>
