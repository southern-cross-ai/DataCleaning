  <h2><a name="p01"
     id="p01">PROLOGUE OF THE PRESSMAN</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Mr. Asa Lee Pinion, of the <i>Chicago Comet</i>, had
crossed half of
  America, the whole of the Atlantic, and eventually even Piccadilly Circus, in
  pursuit of the notable, if not notorious figure of Count Raoul de Marillac.
  Mr. Pinion wanted to get what is called "a story"; a story to put in his
  paper. He did get a story, but he did not put it in his paper. It was too
  tall a story, even for the <i>Comet</i>. Perhaps the metaphor is true in more
  ways than one, and the fable was tall like a church-spire or a tower among
  the stars: beyond comprehension as well as belief. Anyhow, Mr. Pinion decided
  not to risk his readers' comments. But that is no reason why the present
  writer, writing for more exalted, spiritual and divinely credulous readers,
  should imitate his silence.</p>

  <p>Really, the anecdote he heard was quite incredible: and Mr. Pinion was not
  intolerant. While the Count was painting the town red and himself black, it
  was quite possible to believe that he was not so black as he was painted.
  After all, his extravagance and luxury, however ostentatious, did no
  particular harm to anybody but himself; and if he associated with the
  dissipated and degraded, he had never been known to interfere with the
  innocent or the reputable. But while it was credible enough that the nobleman
  was not so black as he was painted, he certainly could not be quite so white
  as he was painted, in the wild story that was told that evening. The story
  came from a friend of the Count's, much too friendly a friend, thought Mr.
  Pinion, friendly to the point of feeble-mindedness. He supposed it must be a
  delusion or a hoax; anyhow he did not put it into his paper. Yet it is
  because of this highly improbable anecdote that the Count de Marillac stands
  at the opening of this book, to introduce the four stories which were put
  forth as parallels to his own.</p>

  <p>But there was one fact which struck the journalist as odd even at the
  beginning. He understood well enough that it would be difficult to catch the
  Count anywhere, as he whirled from one social engagement to another, in the
  manner appropriately called "fast". And he was not offended when Marillac
  said he could only spare ten minutes at his London club before going on to a
  theatrical first-night and other ensuing festivities. During that ten
  minutes, however, Marillac was quite polite, answered the rather superficial
  society questions which the <i>Comet</i> wanted answered, and very genially
  introduced the journalist to three or four club companions or cronies who
  were standing about him in the lounge, and who continued to stand about after
  the Count himself had made his beaming and flashing exit.</p>

  <p>"I suppose," said one of them, "that the naughty old man has gone to see
  the naughty new play with all the naughty new people."</p>

  <p>"Yes," grunted a big man standing in front of the fire. "He's gone with
  the naughtiest person of all, the author, Mrs. Prague. Authoress, I suppose
  she'd call herself&mdash;being only cultured and not educated."</p>

  <p>"He always goes to the first night of those plays," assented the other.
  "P'raps he thinks there won't be a second night, if the police raid the
  place."</p>

  <p>"What play is it?" asked the American in a gentle voice. He was a quiet
  little man with a very long head and a refined falcon profile; he was much
  less loud and casual than the Englishmen.</p>

  <p>"<i>Naked Souls</i>," said the first man with a faint groan. "Dramatized
  version of the world-shaking novel 'Pan's Pipes.' Grapples grimly with the
  facts of life."</p>

  <p>"Also bold, breezy and back to Nature," said the man by the fire. "We hear
  a lot just now about Pan's Pipes. They seem to me a little too like
  drain-pipes."</p>

  <p>"You see," said the other, "Mrs. Prague is so very Modern, she has to go
  back to Pan. She says she cannot bear to believe that Pan is dead."</p>

  <p>"I think," said the large man, with a touch of heavy violence, "that Pan
  is not only dead but rotting and stinking in the street."</p>

  <p>It was the four friends of Marillac who puzzled Mr. Pinion. They were
  obviously rather intimate friends, and yet they were not, on the whole, of
  the sort likely to be even acquaintances. Marillac himself was much what
  might have been expected, rather more restless and haggard than his handsome
  portraits might have implied, a thing likely enough with his late hours and
  his advancing years. His curly hair was still dark and thick, but his pointed
  grey beard was whitening fast; his eyes were a little hollow, and had a more
  anxious expression than could be inferred, at a distance, from his buoyant
  gestures and rapid walk. All that was quite in character, but the tone of the
  group was different. One figure alone out of the four seemed in some sense of
  Marillac's world, having something of the carriage of a military officer,
  with that fine shade that suggests a foreign officer. He had a clean-shaven,
  regular and very impassive face; he was sitting down when he bowed politely
  to the stranger, but something in the bow suggested that, standing up, he
  would have clicked his heels. The others were quite English and quite
  different. One of them was the very big man, with big shoulders bowed but
  powerful and a big head not yet bald but striped with rather thin brown hair.
  But the arresting thing about him was that indescribable suggestion of dust
  or cobwebs that belongs to a strong man leading a sedentary life, possibly
  scientific or scholarly, but certainly obscure, in its method if not its
  effect; the sort of middle-class man with a hobby, who seems to have been dug
  out of it with a spade. It was hard to imagine a more complete contradiction
  to such a meteor of fashion as the Count. The man next him, though more
  alert, was equally solid and respectable and free from fashionable
  pretensions; a short, square man with a square face and spectacles, who
  looked like what he was, an ordinary busy suburban general practitioner. The
  fourth of Marillac's incongruous intimates was quite frankly shabby. Grey
  seedy clothes hung limply on his lean figure, and his dark hair and rather
  ragged beard could, at the best, be only excused as Bohemian. He had very
  remarkable eyes, sunk very deep in his head and yet, by a paradox, standing
  out like signals. The visitor found himself continually drawn to them, as if
  they were magnets.</p>

  <p>But, all together, the group bothered and bewildered him. It was not
  merely a difference of social class, it was an atmosphere of sobriety and
  even of solid work and worth, which seemed to belong to another world. The
  four men in question were friendly in a modest and even embarrassed manner;
  they fell into conversation with the journalist as with any ordinary equal in
  a tram or a tube, and when, about an hour later, they asked him to share
  their dinner at the club, he had no such sense of strain as he might have
  felt in facing one of the fabulous Luculline banquets of their friend the
  Count de Marillac.</p>

  <p>For however seriously Marillac might or might not be taking the serious
  drama of Sex and Science, there was no doubt that he would take the dinner
  even more seriously. He was famous as an epicure of almost the classic and
  legendary sort, and all the <i>gourmets</i> of Europe reverenced his
  reputation. The little man with the spectacles glanced at this fact, indeed,
  as they sat down to dinner:</p>

  <p>"Hope you can put up with our simple fare, Mr. Pinion," he said. "You'd
  have had a much more carefully selected menu if Marillac had been here."</p>

  <p>The American reassured him with polite expressions about the club dinner;
  but added:</p>

  <p>"I suppose it is true that he does make rather an art of dining?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, yes," said the man in spectacles. "Always has all the right things at
  the wrong times. That's the ideal, I suppose."</p>

  <p>"I suppose he takes a lot of trouble?" said Pinion.</p>

  <p>"Yes," said the other. "He chooses his meals very carefully. Not carefully
  from my point of view. But then I'm a doctor."</p>

  <p>Pinion could not keep his eyes off the magnetic eyes of the man with the
  shabby clothes and shaggy hair. Just now the man was gazing across the table
  with a curious intentness, and in the ensuing silence, he suddenly
  intervened.</p>

  <p>"Everybody knows he's very particular in choosing his dinner. But I bet
  not one man in a million knows the principle on which he chooses it."</p>

  <p>"You must remember," said Pinion, with his soft accent, "that I am a
  journalist, and I should like to be the one man in a million."</p>

  <p>The man opposite looked at him steadily and rather strangely for a moment,
  and then said:</p>

  <p>"I have half a mind. . . . Look here, have you any human curiosity as well
  as journalistic curiosity? I mean, would the one man like to know, even if
  the million never knew?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, yes," replied the journalist, "I have plenty of curiosity, even about
  things I am told in confidence. But I can't quite see why Marillac's taste in
  champagne and ortolans should be so very confidential."</p>

  <p>"Well," answered the other gravely, "why do you think he chooses
  them?"</p>

  <p>"I guess I've got a bromide mind," said the American, "but I should rather
  suspect him of choosing the things he likes."</p>

  <p>"<i>Au contraire</i>, as the other <i>gourmet</i> said when asked if he
  lunched on the boat."</p>

  <p>The man with the peculiar eyes broke off from his flippant speech, plunged
  for a few moments into profound silence, and then resumed in so different a
  tone that it was like another man suddenly speaking at the table.</p>

  <p>"Every age has its bigotry, which is blind to some particular need of
  human nature; the Puritans to the need for merriment, the Manchester School
  to the need for beauty, and so on. There is a need in man, or at least in
  many men, which it is not fashionable to admit or allow for in these days.
  Most people have had a touch of it in the more serious emotions of youth; in
  a few men it burns like a flame to the last, as it does here. Christianity,
  especially Catholic Christianity, has been blamed for imposing it, but in
  fact, it rather regulated and even restrained the passion than forced it. It
  exists in all religions, to a wild and frantic extent in some of the
  religions of Asia. There men hack themselves with knives or hang themselves
  on hooks, or walk through life with withered arms rigidly uplifted, crucified
  upon empty air. It is the appetite for what one does not like. Marillac has
  it."</p>

  <p>"What on earth&mdash;" began the startled journalist, but the other
  continued:</p>

  <p>"In short, it is what people call Asceticism, and one of the modern
  mistakes is not allowing for its real existence in rare but quite real
  people. To live a life of incessant austerity and self-denial, as Marillac
  does, is surrounded with extraordinary difficulties and misunderstandings in
  modern society. Society can understand some particular Puritan fad, like
  Prohibition, especially if it is imposed on other people, above all, on poor
  people. But a man like Marillac, imposing on himself, not abstinence from
  wine, but abstinence from worldly pleasures of every sort. . . ."</p>

  <p>"Excuse me," said Pinion in his most courteous tones, "I trust I'd never
  have the incivility to suggest that you have gone mad, so I must ask you to
  tell me candidly whether I have."</p>

  <p>"Most people," replied the other, "would answer that it is Marillac who
  has gone mad. Perhaps he has; anyhow, if the truth were known, he would
  certainly be thought so. But it isn't only to avoid being put in a lunatic
  asylum that he hides his hermit's ideal by pretending to be a man of
  pleasure. It's part of the whole idea, in its only tolerable form. The worst
  of those Eastern fakirs hung on hooks is that they are too conspicuous. It
  may make them just a little vain. I don't deny that Stylites and some of the
  first hermits may have been touched with the same danger. But our friend is a
  Christian anchorite; and understands the advice, 'When you fast, anoint your
  head and wash your face.' He is not seen of men to fast. On the contrary, he
  is seen of men to feast. Only, don't you see, he has invented a new kind of
  fasting."</p>

  <p>Mr. Pinion of the <i>Comet</i> suddenly laughed, a curt and startled
  laugh, for he was very quick and had already guessed the joke.</p>

  <p>"You don't really mean&mdash;" he began.</p>

  <p>"Well, it's quite simple, isn't it?" replied his informant. "He feasts on
  all the most luxurious and expensive things that he doesn't like. Especially
  on the things that he simply detests. Under that cover, nobody can possibly
  accuse him of virtue. He remains impenetrably protected behind a rampart of
  repulsive oysters and unwelcome <i>aperitifs</i>. In short, the hermit must
  now hide anywhere but in the hermitage. He generally hides in the latest
  luxurious gilded hotels, because that's where they have the worst
  cooking."</p>

  <p>"This is a very extraordinary tale," said the American, arching his
  eyebrows.</p>

  <p>"You begin to see the idea?" said the other. "If he has twenty different
  <i>hors-d'&oelig;uvres</i> brought to him and takes the olives, who is to
  know that he hates olives? If he thoughtfully scans the whole wine-list and
  eventually selects a rather recondite Hock, who will guess that his whole
  soul rises in disgust at the very thought of Hock: and that he knows that's
  the nastiest&mdash;even of Hocks? Whereas, if he were to demand dried peas or
  a mouldy crust at the Ritz, he would probably attract attention."</p>

  <p>"I never can quite see," said the man in spectacles restlessly, "what is
  the good of it all."</p>

  <p>The other man lowered his magnetic eyes and looked down with some
  embarrassment. At last he said:</p>

  <p>"I think I can see it, but I don't think I can say it. I had a touch of it
  myself once, only in one special direction, and I found it almost impossible
  to explain to anybody. Only there is one mark of the real mystic and ascetic
  of this sort; that he only wants to do it to himself. He wants everybody else
  to have what wine or smokes they want and will ransack the Ritz for it. The
  moment he wants to dragoon the others, the mystic sinks into a mire of
  degradation and becomes the moral reformer."</p>

  <p>There was a pause, and then the journalist said suddenly:</p>

  <p>"But, look here, this won't do. It isn't only wasting his money on wining
  and dining that has got Marillac a bad name. It's the whole thing. Why is he
  such a fan for these rotten erotic plays and things? Why does he go about
  with a woman like Mrs. Prague? That doesn't seem like a hermit, anyhow."</p>

  <p>The man facing Pinion smiled and the heavier man on his right half turned
  with a sort of grunt of laughter.</p>

  <p>"Well," he said, "it's pretty plain you've never been about with Mrs.
  Prague."</p>

  <p>"Why, what do you mean?" asked Pinion; and this time there was something
  like a general laugh.</p>

  <p>"Some say she's his Maiden Aunt and it's his duty to be kind to her,"
  began the first man, but the second man interrupted him gruffly:</p>

  <p>"Why do you call her a Maiden Aunt when she looks like a&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Quite so, quite so," said the first man rather hastily, "and why 'looks
  like'&mdash;if it comes to that?"</p>

  <p>"But her conversation!" groaned his friend. "And Marillac stands it for
  hours on end!"</p>

  <p>"And her play!" assented the other. "Marillac sits through five mortal
  acts of it. If that isn't being a martyr&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Don't you see?" cried the shabby man with something like excitement. "The
  Count is a cultivated and even learned man; also he is a Latin and logical to
  the point of impatience. And yet he sticks it. He endures five or six acts of
  a Really Modern Intellectual Incisive Drama. The First Act in which she says
  that Woman will no longer be put on a pedestal; the Second Act in which Woman
  will no longer be put under a glass case; the Third Act in which Woman will
  no longer be a plaything for man, and the Fourth in which she will no longer
  be a chattel; all the <i>clichés</i>. And he still has two acts before him,
  in which she will not be something else, will not be a slave in the home or
  an outcast flung from the home. He's seen it six times without turning a
  hair; you can't even see him grind his teeth. And Mrs. Prague's conversation!
  How her first husband could never understand, and her second husband seemed
  as if he might understand, only her third husband carried her off as if there
  was real understanding&mdash;and so on, as if there were anything to be
  understood. You know what an utterly egotistical fool is like. And he suffers
  even those fools gladly."</p>

  <p>"In fact," put in the big man in his brooding manner, "you might say he
  has invented the Modern Penance. The Penance of Boredom. Hair-shirts and
  hermits' caves in a howling wilderness would not be so horrible to modern
  nerves as that."</p>

  <p>"By your account," ruminated Pinion, "I've been chasing a pleasure-seeker
  tripping on the light fantastic toe and only found a hermit standing on his
  head." After a silence he said abruptly, "Is this really true? How did you
  find it out?"</p>

  <p>"That's rather a long story," replied the man opposite. "The truth is that
  Marillac allows himself one feast in the year, on Christmas Day, and eats and
  drinks what he really likes. I found him drinking beer and eating tripe and
  onions in a quiet pub in Hoxton, and somehow we were forced into confidential
  conversation. You will understand, of course, that this is a confidential
  conversation."</p>

  <p>"I certainly shan't print it," answered the journalist. "I should be
  regarded as a lunatic if I did. People don't understand that sort of lunacy
  nowadays, and I rather wonder you take to it so much yourself."</p>

  <p>"Well, I put my own case before him, you see," answered the other. "In a
  small way it was a little like his own. And then I introduced him to my
  friends, and so he became a sort of President of our little club."</p>

  <p>"Oh," said Pinion rather blankly, "I didn't know you were a club."</p>

  <p>"Well, we are four men with a common bond at least. We have all had
  occasion, like Marillac, to look rather worse than we were."</p>

  <p>"Yes," grunted the large man rather sourly, "we've all been Misunderstood.
  Like Mrs. Prague."</p>

  <p>"The Club of Men Misunderstood is rather more cheerful than that,
  however," continued his friend. "We are all pretty jolly here, considering
  that our reputations have been blasted by black and revolting crimes. The
  truth is we have devoted ourselves to a new sort of detective story&mdash;or
  detective service if you like. We do not hunt for crimes but for concealed
  virtues. Sometimes, as in Marillac's case, they are very artfully concealed.
  As you will doubtless be justified in retorting, we conceal our own virtues
  with brilliant success."</p>

  <p>The journalist's head began to go round a little, though he thought
  himself pretty well accustomed both to crazy and criminal surroundings. "But
  I thought you said," he objected, "that your reputations were blasted with
  crime. What sort of crime?"</p>

  <p>"Well, mine was murder," said the man next to him. "The people who blasted
  me did it because they disapproved of murder, apparently. It's true I was
  rather a failure at murder, as at everything else."</p>

  <p>Pinion's gaze wandered in some bewilderment to the next man who answered
  cheerfully:</p>

  <p>"Mine was only a common fraud. A professional fraud, too, the sort that
  gets you kicked out of your profession sometimes. Rather like Dr. Cook's sham
  discovery of the North Pole."</p>

  <p>"What does all this mean?" asked Pinion; and he looked inquiringly at the
  man opposite, who had done so much of the explaining so far.</p>

  <p>"Oh, theft," said the man opposite, indifferently; "the charge on which I
  was actually arrested was petty larceny."</p>

  <p>There was a profound silence, which seemed to settle in a mysterious
  manner, like a gathering cloud, on the figure of the fourth member, who had
  not spoken so far a single word. He sat erect in his rather stiff, foreign
  fashion; his wooden, handsome face was unchanged and his lips had never moved
  even for so much as a murmur. But now, when the sudden and deep silence
  seemed to challenge him, his face seemed to harden from wood to stone and
  when he spoke at last, his foreign accent seemed something more than alien,
  as if it were almost inhuman.</p>

  <p>"I have committed the Unpardonable Sin," he said. "For what sin did Dante
  reserve the last and lowest hell; the Circle of Ice?"</p>

  <p>Still no one spoke; and he answered his own question in the same hollow
  tone:</p>

  <p>"Treason. I betrayed the four companions of my party, and gave them up to
  the Government for a bribe."</p>

  <p>Something turned cold inside the sensitive stranger, and for the first
  time he really felt the air around him sinister and strange. The stillness
  continued for another half minute, and then all the four men burst out into a
  great uproar of laughter.</p>

  <p>The stories they told, to justify their boasts or confessions, are here
  retold in a different fashion, as they appeared to those on the outskirts
  rather than the centre of the events. But the journalist, who liked to
  collect all the odd things of life, was interested enough to record them, and
  then afterwards recast them. He felt he had really got something, if not
  exactly what he had expected, out of his pursuit of the dashing and
  extravagant Count Raoul de Marillac.</p>

  <h2><a name="c011"
     id="c011">I</a>. &mdash; THE MAN WITH THE GREEN UMBRELLA</h2>

<p class="first">The new Governor was Lord Tallboys, commonly called Top-hat
Tallboys,
  because of his attachment to that uncanny erection, which he continued to
  carry balanced on his head as calmly among the palm-trees of Egypt as among
  the lamp-posts of Westminster. Certainly he carried it calmly enough in lands
  where few crowns were safe from toppling. The district he had come out to
  govern may here be described, with diplomatic vagueness, as a strip on the
  edge of Egypt and called for our convenience Polybia. It is an old story now;
  but one which many people had reason to remember for many years, and at the
  time it was an imperial event. One Governor was killed, another Governor was
  nearly killed, but in this story we are concerned only with one catastrophe,
  and that was rather a personal and even private catastrophe.</p>

  <p>Top-hat Tallboys was a bachelor and yet he brought a family with him. He
  had a nephew and two nieces of whom one, as it happened, had married the
  Deputy Governor of Polybia, the man who had been called to rule during the
  interregnum after the murder of the previous ruler. The other niece was
  unmarried; her name was Barbara Traill, and she may well be the first figure
  to cross the stage of this story.</p>

  <p>For indeed she was rather a solitary and striking figure, raven dark and
  rich in colouring with a very beautiful but rather sullen profile, as she
  crossed the sandy spaces and came under the cover of one long low wall which
  alone threw a strip of shadow from the sun, which was sloping towards the
  desert horizon. The wall itself was a quaint example of the patchwork
  character of that borderland of East and West. It was actually a line of
  little villas, built for clerks and small officials, and thrown out as by a
  speculative builder whose speculations spread to the ends of the earth. It
  was a strip of Streatham amid the ruins of Heliopolis. Such oddities are not
  unknown, when the oldest countries are turned into the newest colonies. But
  in this case the young woman, who was not without imagination, was conscious
  of a quite fantastic contrast. Each of these dolls' houses had its toy shrubs
  and plants and its narrow oblong of back garden running down to the common
  and continuous garden wall; and it was just outside this wall that there ran
  the rough path, fringed with a few hoary and wrinkled olives. Outside the
  fringe there faded away into infinity the monstrous solitude of sand. Only
  there could still be detected on that last line of distance a faint
  triangular shape, a sort of mathematical symbol whose unnatural simplicity
  has moved all poets and pilgrims for five thousand years. Anyone seeing it
  really for the first time, as the girl did, can hardly avoid uttering a cry:
  "The Pyramids!"</p>

  <p>Almost as she said it a voice said in her ear, not loud but with alarming
  clearness and very exact articulation: "The foundations were traced in blood
  and in blood shall they be traced anew. These things are written for our
  instruction."</p>

  <p>It has been said that Barbara Traill was not without imagination; it would
  be truer to say that she had rather too much. But she was quite certain she
  had not imagined the voice, though she certainly could not imagine where it
  came from. She appeared to be absolutely alone on the little path which ran
  along the wall and led to the gardens round the Governorate. Then she
  remembered the wall itself, and looking sharply over her shoulder, she
  fancied she saw for one moment a head peering out of the shadow of a
  sycamore, which was the only tree of any size for some distance, since she
  had left the last of the low sprawling olives two hundred yards behind.
  Whatever it was, it had instantly vanished, and somehow she suddenly felt
  frightened, more frightened at its disappearance than its appearance. She
  began to hurry along the path to her uncle's residence at a pace that was a
  little like a run. It was probably through this sudden acceleration of
  movement that she seemed to become aware, rather abruptly, that a man was
  marching steadily in front of her along the same track towards the gates of
  the Governorate.</p>

  <p>He was a very large man, and seemed to take up the whole of the narrow
  path. She had something of the sensation, with which she was already slightly
  acquainted, of walking behind a camel through the narrow and crooked cracks
  of the Eastern town. But this man planted his feet as firmly as an elephant;
  he walked, one might say, even with a certain pomp, as if he were in a
  procession. He wore a long frock-coat and his head was surmounted by a tower
  of scarlet, a very tall red fez, rather taller than the top-hat of Lord
  Tallboys. The combination of the red Eastern cap and the black Western
  clothes is common enough among the <i>Effendi</i> class in those countries.
  But somehow it seemed novel and incongruous in this case, for the man was
  very fair and had a big blond beard blown about in the breeze. He might have
  been a model for the idiots who talk of the Nordic type of European, but
  somehow he did not look like an Englishman. He carried hooked on one finger a
  rather grotesque green umbrella or parasol, which he twirled idly like a
  trinket. As he was walking slower and slower and Barbara was walking fast and
  wanted to walk faster, she could hardly repress an exclamation of impatience
  and something like a request for room to pass. The large man with the beard
  immediately faced round and stared at her; then he lifted a monocle and fixed
  it in his eye and instantly smiled his apologies. She realized that he must
  be short-sighted and that she had been a mere blur to him a moment before,
  but there was something else in the change of his face and manner, something
  that she had seen before, but to which she could not put a name.</p>

  <p>He explained, with the most formal courtesy, that he was going to leave a
  note for an official at the Governorate, and there was really no reason for
  her to refuse him credence or conversation. They walked a little way
  together, talking of things in general, and she had not exchanged more than a
  few sentences before she realized that she was talking to a remarkable
  man.</p>

  <p>We hear much in these days about the dangers of innocence, much that is
  false and a little that is true. But the argument is almost exclusively
  applied to sexual innocence. There is a great deal that ought to be said
  about the dangers of political innocence. That most necessary and most noble
  virtue of patriotism is very often brought to despair and destruction, quite
  needlessly and prematurely, by the folly of educating the comfortable classes
  in a false optimism about the record and security of the Empire. Young people
  like Barbara Traill have often never heard a word about the other side of the
  story, as it would be told by Irishmen or Indians or even French Canadians,
  and it is the fault of their parents and their papers if they often pass
  abruptly from a stupid Britishism to an equally stupid Bolshevism. The hour
  of Barbara Traill was come, though she probably did not know it.</p>

  <p>"If England keeps her promises," said the man with the beard, frowning,
  "there is still a chance that things may be quiet."</p>

  <p>And Barbara had answered, like a schoolboy:</p>

  <p>"England always keeps her promises."</p>

  <p>"The Waba have not noticed it," he answered with an air of triumph.</p>

  <p>The omniscient are often ignorant. They are often especially ignorant of
  ignorance. The stranger imagined that he was uttering a very crushing
  repartee, as perhaps he was, to anybody who knew what he meant. But Barbara
  had never heard of the Waba. The newspapers had seen to that.</p>

  <p>"The British Government," he was saying, "definitely pledged itself two
  years ago to a complete scheme of local autonomy. If it is a complete scheme,
  all will be well. If Lord Tallboys has come out here with an incomplete
  scheme, a compromise, it will be very far from well. I shall be very sorry
  for everybody, but especially for my English friends."</p>

  <p>She answered with a young and innocent sneer, "Oh yes&mdash;I suppose you
  are a great friend of the English."</p>

  <p>"Yes," he replied calmly. "A friend: but a candid friend."</p>

  <p>"Oh, I know all about that sort," she said with hot sincerity. "I know
  what they mean by a candid friend. I've always found it meant a nasty,
  sneering, sneaking, treacherous friend."</p>

  <p>He seemed stung for an instant and answered, "Your politicians have no
  need to learn treachery from the Egyptians." Then he added abruptly: "Do you
  know on Lord Jaffray's raid they shot a child? Do you know anything at all?
  Do you even know how England tacked on Egypt to her Empire?"</p>

  <p>"England has a glorious Empire," said the patriot stoutly.</p>

  <p>"England had a glorious Empire," he said. "So had Egypt."</p>

  <p>They had come, somewhat symbolically, to the end of their common path and
  she turned away indignantly to the gate that led into the private gardens of
  the Governor. As she did so he lifted his green umbrella and pointed with a
  momentary gesture at the dark line of the desert and the distant Pyramid. The
  afternoon had already reddened into evening, and the sunset lay in long bands
  of burning crimson across the purple desolation of that dry inland sea.</p>

  <p>"A glorious Empire," he said. "An Empire on which the sun never sets. Look
  . . . the sun is setting in blood."</p>

  <p>She went through the iron gate like the wind and let it clang behind her.
  As she went up the avenue towards the inner gardens, she lost a little of her
  impatient movement and began to trail along in the rather moody manner which
  was more normal to her. The colours and shadows of that quieter scene seemed
  to close about her; this place was for the present her nearest approach to
  home, and at the end of the long perspective of gaily coloured garden walks,
  she could see her sister Olive picking flowers.</p>

  <p>The sight soothed her; but she was a little puzzled about why she should
  need any soothing. She had a deeply disquieting sense of having touched
  something alien and terrible, something fierce and utterly foreign, as if she
  had stroked some strange wild beast of the desert. But the gardens about her
  and the house beyond had already taken on a tone or tint indescribably
  English, in spite of the recent settlement and the African sky. And Olive was
  so obviously choosing flowers to put into English vases or to decorate
  English dinner-tables, with decanters and salted almonds.</p>

  <p>But as she drew nearer to that distant figure, it grew more puzzling. The
  blossoms grasped in her sister's hand looked like mere ragged and random
  handfuls, torn away as a man lying on the turf would idly tear out grass,
  when he is abstracted or angry. A few loose stalks lay littered on the path;
  it seemed as if the heads had been merely broken off as if by a child.
  Barbara did not know why she took in all these details with a slow and dazed
  eye, before she looked at the central figure they surrounded. Then Olive
  looked up and her face was ghastly. It might have been the face of Medea in
  the garden, gathering the poisonous flowers.</p><hr><br>

  <h2><a name="c012"
     id="c012">II</a>. &mdash; THE BOY WHO MADE A SCENE</h2>

<p class="first">Barbara Traill was a girl with a good deal of the boy about
her. This is
  very commonly said about modern heroines. None the less, the present heroine
  would be a very disappointing modern heroine. For, unfortunately, the
  novelists who call their heroines boyish obviously know nothing whatever
  about boys. The girl they depict, whether we happen to regard her as a bright
  young thing or a brazen little idiot, is at any rate in every respect the
  complete contrary of a boy. She is sublimely candid; she is slightly shallow;
  she is uniformly cheerful; she is entirely unembarrassed; she is everything
  that a boy is not. But Barbara really was rather like a boy. That is, she was
  rather shy, obscurely imaginative, capable of intellectual friendships and at
  the same time of emotional brooding over them; capable of being morbid and by
  no means incapable of being secretive. She had that sense of misfit which
  embarrasses so many boys, the sense of the soul being too big to be seen or
  confessed, and the tendency to cover the undeveloped emotions with a
  convention. One effect of it was that she was of the sort troubled by Doubt.
  It might have been religious doubt, at the moment it was a sort of patriotic
  doubt, though she would have furiously denied that there was any doubt about
  the matter. She had been upset by her glimpse of the alleged grievances of
  Egypt or the alleged crimes of England, and the face of the stranger, the
  white face with the golden beard and the glaring monocle, had come to stand
  for the tempter or the spirit that denies. But the face of her sister
  suddenly banished all such merely political problems. It brought her back
  with a shock to much more private problems, indeed to much more secret
  problems, for she had never admitted them to anyone but herself.</p>

  <p>The Traills had a tragedy, or rather, perhaps, something that Barbara's
  brooding spirit had come to regard as the dawn of a tragedy. Her younger
  brother was still a boy; it might more truly be said that he was still a
  child. His mind had never come to a normal maturity, and though opinions
  differed about the nature of the deficiency, she was prone in her black moods
  to take the darkest view and let it darken the whole house of Tallboys. Thus
  it happened that she said quickly, at the sight of her sister's strange
  expression:</p>

  <p>"Is anything wrong about Tom?"</p>

  <p>Olive started slightly, and then said, rather crossly than otherwise: "No,
  not particularly. . . . Uncle has put him with a tutor here, and they say
  he's getting on better. . . . Why do you ask? There's nothing special the
  matter with him."</p>

  <p>"Then I suppose," said Barbara, "that there is something special the
  matter with you."</p>

  <p>"Well," answered the other, "isn't there something the matter with all of
  us?"</p>

  <p>With that she turned abruptly and went back towards the house, dropping
  the flowers she had been making a pretence of gathering, and her sister
  followed, still deeply disturbed in mind.</p>

  <p>As they came near the portico and veranda, she heard the high voice of her
  uncle Tallboys, who was leaning back in a garden chair and talking to Olive's
  husband, the Deputy Governor. Tallboys was a lean figure with a large nose
  and ears standing out from his stalk of a head; like many men of that type he
  had a prominent Adam's apple and talked in a full-throated gobbling fashion.
  But what he said was worth listening to, though he had a trick of balancing
  one clause against another, with alternate gestures of his large, loose
  hands, which some found a trifle irritating. He was also annoyingly deaf. The
  Deputy Governor, Sir Harry Smythe, was an amusing contrast, a square man with
  a rather congested face, the colour high under the eyes, which were very
  light and clear, and two parallel black bars of brow and moustache, which
  gave him rather a look of Kitchener, until he stood up and looked stunted by
  the comparison. It also gave him a rather misleading look of bad temper, for
  he was an affectionate husband and a good-humoured comrade, if a rather
  stubborn party man. For the rest the conversation was enough to show that he
  had a military point of view, which is sufficiently common and even
  commonplace.</p>

  <p>"In short," the Governor was saying, "I believe the Government scheme is
  admirably adapted to meet a somewhat difficult situation. Extremists of both
  types will object to it, but extremists object to everything."</p>

  <p>"Quite so," answered the other, "the question isn't so much whether they
  object as whether they can make themselves objectionable."</p>

  <p>Barbara, with her new and nervous political interests, found herself
  interrupted in her attempt to listen to the political conversation by the
  unwelcome discovery that there were other people present. There was a very
  beautifully dressed young gentleman, with hair like black satin, who seemed
  to be the local secretary of the Governor; his name was Arthur Meade. There
  was an old man with a very obvious chestnut wig and a very unobvious, not to
  say inscrutable yellow face, who was an eminent financier known by the name
  of Morse. There were various ladies of the official circle who were duly
  scattered among these gentlemen. It seemed to be the tail-end of a sort of
  afternoon tea, which made all the more odd and suspicious the strange
  behaviour of the only hostess, in straying to the other garden and tearing up
  the flowers. Barbara found herself set down beside a pleasant old clergyman
  with smooth, silver hair, and an equally smooth, silver voice, who talked to
  her about the Bible and the Pyramids. She found herself committed to the
  highly uncomfortable experience of pretending to conduct one conversation
  while trying to listen to another.</p>

  <p>This was the more difficult because the Rev. Ernest Snow, the clergyman in
  question, had (for all his mildness) not a little gentle pertinacity. She
  received a confused impression that he held very strong views on the meaning
  of certain Prophecies in connection with the end of the world and especially
  with the destiny of the British Empire. He had that habit of suddenly asking
  questions which is so unkind to the inattentive listener. Thus, she would
  manage to hear a scrap of the talk between the two rulers of the province;
  the Governor would say, balancing his sentences with his swaying hands:</p>

  <p>"There are two considerations and by this method we meet them both. On the
  one hand, it is impossible entirely to repudiate our pledge. On the other
  hand, it is absurd to suppose that the recent atrocious crime does not
  necessarily modify the nature of that pledge. We can still make sure that our
  proclamation is a proclamation of a reasonable liberty. We have therefore
  decided&mdash;"</p>

  <p>And then, at that particular moment, the poor clergyman would pierce her
  consciousness with the pathetic question:</p>

  <p>"Now how many cubits do you think that would be?"</p>

  <p>A little while later she managed to hear Smythe, who talked much less than
  his companion, say curtly: "For my part, I don't believe it makes much
  difference what proclamations you make. There are rows here when we haven't
  got sufficient forces, and there are no rows when we have got sufficient
  forces. That's all."</p>

  <p>"And what is our position at present?" asked the Governor gravely.</p>

  <p>"Our position is damned bad, if you ask me," grumbled the other in a low
  voice. "Nothing has been done to train the men; why, I found the rifle
  practice consisted of a sort of parlour game with a pea-shooter about twice a
  year. I've put up proper rifle butts beyond the olive walk there now, but
  there are other things. The munitions are not&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"But in that case," came the mild but penetrating voice of Mr. Snow, "in
  that case what becomes of the Shunamites?"</p>

  <p>Barbara had not the least idea what became of them, but in this case she
  felt she could treat it as a rhetorical question. She forced herself to
  listen a little more closely to the views of the venerable mystic, and she
  only heard one more fragment of the political conversation.</p>

  <p>"Shall we really want all these military preparations?" asked Lord
  Tallboys rather anxiously. "When do you think we shall want them?"</p>

  <p>"I can tell you," said Smythe with a certain grimness. "We shall want them
  when you publish your proclamation of reasonable liberty."</p>

  <p>Lord Tallboys made an abrupt movement in the garden chair, like one
  breaking up a conference in some irritation; then he made a diversion by
  lifting a finger and signalling to his secretary Mr. Meade, who slid up to
  him and after a brief colloquy slid into the house. Released from the strain
  of State affairs, Barbara fell once more under the spell of the Church and
  the Prophetical Office. She still had only a confused idea of what the old
  clergyman was saying, but she began to feel a vague element of poetry in it.
  At least it was full of things that pleased her fancy like the dark drawings
  of Blake, prehistoric cities and blind and stony seers and kings who seemed
  clad in stone like their sepulchres the Pyramids. In a dim way she understood
  why all that stony and starry wilderness has been the playground of so many
  cranks. She softened a little towards the clerical crank and even accepted an
  invitation to his house on the day after the following, to see the documents
  and the definite proof about the Shunamites. But she was still very vague
  about what it was supposed to prove.</p>

  <p>He thanked her and said gravely: "If the prophecy is fulfilled now, there
  will be a grave calamity."</p>

  <p>"I suppose," she said with a rather dreary flippancy, "if the prophecy
  were not fulfilled, it would be an even greater calamity."</p>

  <p>Even as she spoke there was a stir behind some of the garden palms and the
  pale and slightly gaping face of her brother appeared above the palm-leaves.
  The next moment she saw just behind him the secretary and the tutor; it was
  evident that his uncle had sent for him. Tom Traill had the look of being too
  big for his clothes, which is not uncommon in the otherwise undeveloped; the
  gloomy good looks which he would otherwise have shared with his branch of the
  family were marred by his dark, straight hair being brushed crooked and his
  habit of looking out the corner of his eye at the corner of the carpet. His
  tutor was a big man of a dull and dusty exterior, apparently having the name
  of Hume. His broad shoulders were a little bowed like those of a drudge,
  though he was as yet hardly middle-aged. His plain and rugged face had a
  rather tired expression, as well it might. Teaching the defective is not
  always a hilarious parlour game.</p>

  <p>Lord Tallboys had a brief and kindly conversation with the tutor. Lord
  Tallboys asked a few simple questions. Lord Tallboys gave a little lecture on
  education, still very kindly, but accompanied by the waving of the hands in
  rotation. On the one hand, the power to work was a necessity of life and
  could never be wholly evaded. On the other hand, without a reasonable
  proportion of pleasure and repose even work would suffer. On the one hand . .
  . it was at this point that the Prophecy was apparently fulfilled and a
  highly regrettable Calamity occurred at the Governor's tea-party.</p>

  <p>For the boy burst out abruptly into a sort of high, gurgling crow and
  began to flap his hands about like the wings of a penguin, repeating over and
  over again, "On the one hand. On the other hand. On the one hand. On the
  other hand. On the one hand. On the other hand. . . . Golly!"</p>

  <p>"Tom!" cried Olive on a sharp accent of agony and there was a ghastly
  silence over all the garden.</p>

  <p>"Well," said the tutor in a reasonable undertone, which was as clear as a
  bell in that stillness, "you can't expect to have three hands, can you?"</p>

  <p>"Three hands?" repeated the boy, and then after a long silence, "Why, how
  could you?"</p>

  <p>"One would have to be in the middle, like an elephant's trunk," went on
  the tutor in the same colourless, conversational tone. "Wouldn't it be nice
  to have a long nose like an elephant so that you could turn it this way and
  that and pick up things on the breakfast-table, and never let go of your
  knife and fork?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, you're <i>mad</i>!" ejaculated Tom with a sort of explosion that had
  a queer touch of exultation.</p>

  <p>"I'm not the only mad person in the world, old boy," said Mr. Hume.</p>

  <p>Barbara stood staring as she listened to this extraordinary conversation
  in that deadly silence and that highly unsuitable social setting. The most
  extraordinary thing about it was that the tutor said these crazy and
  incongruous things with an absolutely blank face.</p>

  <p>"Didn't I ever tell you," he said in the same heavy and indifferent voice,
  "about the clever dentist who could pull out his own teeth with his own nose?
  I'll tell you tomorrow."</p>

  <p>He was still quite dull and serious; but he had done the trick. The boy
  was distracted from his dislike of his uncle by the absurd image, just as a
  child in a temper is distracted by a new toy. Tom was now only looking at the
  tutor and followed him everywhere with his eyes. Perhaps he was not the only
  member of his family who did so. For the tutor, Barbara thought, was
  certainly a very odd person.</p>

  <p>There was no more political talk that day, but there was not a little
  political news on the next. On the following morning proclamations were
  posted everywhere announcing the just, reasonable and even generous
  compromise which His Majesty's Government was now offering as a fair and
  final settlement of the serious social problems of Polybia and eastern Egypt.
  And on the following evening the news went through the town in one blast,
  like the wind of the desert, that Viscount Tallboys, Governor of Polybia, had
  been shot down by the last of the line of olives, at the corner of the
  wall.</p><hr><br>

  <h2><a name="c013"
     id="c013">III</a>. &mdash; THE MAN WHO COULD NOT HATE</h2>

<p class="first">Immediately after leaving the little garden-party, Tom and
his tutor
  parted for the evening, for the former lived at the Governorate, while the
  latter had a sort of lodge or little bungalow higher up on the hill behind
  amid the taller trees. The tutor said in private what everybody had
  indignantly expected him to say in public, and remonstrated with the youth
  for his display of imitative drama.</p>

  <p>"Well, I won't like him," said Tom warningly. "I'd like to kill him. His
  nose sticks out."</p>

  <p>"You can hardly expect it to stick in," said Mr. Hume mildly. "I wonder
  whether there's an old story about the man whose nose stuck in."</p>

  <p>"Is there?" demanded the other in the literal spirit of infancy.</p>

  <p>"There may be tomorrow," replied the tutor and began to climb the steep
  path to his abode.</p>

  <p>It was a lodge built mostly of bamboo and light timber with a gallery
  running round outside, from which could be seen the whole district spread out
  like a map. The grey and green squares of the Governorate building and
  grounds; the path running straight under the low garden wall and parallel to
  the line of villas; the solitary sycamore breaking the line at one point and
  farther along the closer rank of the olive-trees, like a broken cloister, and
  then another gap and then the corner of the wall, beyond which spread brown
  slopes of desert, patched here and there with green, where the ground was
  being turfed as part of some new public works or the Deputy Governor's rapid
  reforms in military organization. The whole hung under him like a vast
  coloured cloud in the brief afterglow of the Eastern sunset; then it was
  rapidly rolled in the purple gloom in which the strong stars stood out over
  his head and seemed nearer than the things of earth.</p>

  <p>He stood for some moments on the gallery looking down on the darkening
  landscape, his blunt features knotted in a frown of curious reflection. Then
  he went back into the room where he and his pupil had worked all day, or
  where he had worked to induce his pupil to consider the idea of working. It
  was a rather bare room and the few objects in it rather odd and varied. A few
  bookshelves showed very large and gaily coloured books containing the verses
  of Mr. Edward Lear, and very small and shabby books containing the verses of
  the principal French and Latin poets. A rack of pipes, all hanging crooked,
  gave the inevitable touch of the bachelor; a fishing-rod and an old
  double-barrelled gun leaned dusty and disused in a corner; for it was long
  ago that this man, in other ways so remote from the sports of his countrymen,
  had indulged those two hobbies, chiefly because they were unsociable. But
  what was perhaps most curious of all, the desk and the floor were littered
  with geometrical diagrams treated in a manner unusual among geometers, for
  the figures were adorned with absurd faces or capering legs, such as a
  schoolboy adds to the squares and triangles on the blackboard. But the
  diagrams were drawn very precisely, as if the draughtsman had an exact eye
  and excelled in anything depending on that organ.</p>

  <p>John Hume sat down at his desk and began to draw more diagrams. A little
  later he lit a pipe, and began to study those he had drawn, but he did not
  leave his desk or his preoccupations. So the hours went by amid an
  unfathomable stillness around that hillside hermitage, until the distant
  strains of a more or less lively band floated up from below, as a signal that
  a dance at the Governorate was already in progress. He knew there was a dance
  that night and took no notice of it; he was not sentimental, but some of the
  tunes stirred almost mechanical memories. The Tallboys family was a little
  old-fashioned, even for this rather earlier time. They were old-fashioned in
  not pretending to be any more democratic than they were. Their dependents
  were dependents, decently treated; they did not call themselves liberal
  because they dragged their sycophants into society. It had therefore never
  crossed the mind of the secretary or the tutor that the dance at the
  Governorate was any concern of theirs. They were also old-fashioned in the
  arrangements of the dance itself, and the date must also be allowed for. The
  new dances had only just begun to pierce, and nobody had dreamed of the wild
  and varied freedom of our new fashion, by which a person has to walk about
  all night with the same partner to the same tune. All this sense of distance,
  material and moral, in the old swaying waltzes moved through his
  subconsciousness and must be allowed for in estimating what he suddenly
  looked up and saw.</p>

  <p>It seems for one instant as if, in rising through the mist, the tune had
  taken outline and colour and burst into his room with the bodily presence of
  a song, for the blues and greens of her patterned dress were like notes of
  music and her amazing face came to him like a cry; a cry out of the old youth
  he had lost or never known. A princess flying out of fairyland would not have
  seemed more impossible than that girl from that ballroom, though he knew her
  well enough as the younger sister of his charge; and the ball was a few
  hundred yards away. Her face was like a pale face burning through a dream and
  itself as unconscious as a dreamer's; for Barbara Traill was curiously
  unconscious of that mask of beauty fixed on her brooding boyish soul. She had
  been counted less attractive than her sisters and her sulks had marked her
  almost as the ugly duckling. Nothing in the solid man before her told of the
  shock of realization in his mind. She did not even smile. It was also
  characteristic of her that she blurted out what she had to say at once,
  almost as crudely as her brother:</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid Tom is very rude to you," she said. "I'm very sorry. How do
  you think he is getting on?"</p>

  <p>"I think most people would say," he said slowly at last, "that I ought to
  apologize for his schooling more than you for his family. I'm sorry about his
  uncle, but it's always a choice of evils. Tallboys is a very distinguished
  man and can look after his own dignity, but I've got to look after my charge.
  And I know that is the right way with him. Don't you be worried about him.
  He's perfectly all right if you understand him, and it's only a matter of
  making up for lost time."</p>

  <p>She was listening, or not listening, with her characteristic frown of
  abstraction; she had taken the chair he offered her apparently without
  noticing it and was staring at the comical diagrams, apparently without
  seeing them. Indeed, it might well have been supposed that she was not
  listening at all; for the next remark she made appeared to be about a totally
  different subject. But she often had a habit of thus showing fragments of her
  mind; and there was more plan in the jigsaw puzzle than many people
  understood. Anyhow, she said suddenly, without lifting her eyes from the
  ludicrous drawing in front of her:</p>

  <p>"I met a man going to the Governorate today. A big man with a long, fair
  beard and a single eyeglass. Do you know who he is? He said all sorts of
  horrid things against England."</p>

  <p>Hume got to his feet with his hands in his pockets and the expression of
  one about to whistle. He stared at the girl and said softly:</p>

  <p>"Hullo! Has he turned up again? I thought there was some trouble coming.
  Yes, I know him&mdash;they call him Dr. Gregory, but I believe he comes from
  Germany, though he often passes for English. He is a stormy petrel, anyhow;
  and wherever he goes there's a row. Some say we ought to have used him
  ourselves; I believe he once offered his talents to our Government. He's a
  very clever fellow and knows a frightful lot of the facts about these
  parts."</p>

  <p>"Do you mean," she said sharply, "that I'm to believe that man and all the
  things he said?"</p>

  <p>"No," said Hume. "I shouldn't believe that man; not even if you believe
  all the things he said."</p>

  <p>"What do you mean?" she demanded.</p>

  <p>"Frankly, I think he is a thoroughly bad egg," said the tutor. "He's got a
  pretty rotten reputation about women; I won't go into details, but he'd have
  gone to prison twice but for suborning perjury. I only say, whatever you may
  come to believe, don't believe in him."</p>

  <p>"He dared to say that our Government broke its word," said Barbara
  indignantly.</p>

  <p>John Hume was silent. Something in his silence affected her like a strain,
  and she said quite irrationally:</p>

  <p>"Oh, for the Lord's sake say something! Do you know he dared to say that
  somebody on Lord Jaffray's expedition shot a child? I don't mind their saying
  England's cold and hard and all that; I suppose that's natural prejudice. But
  can't we stop these wild, wicked lies?"</p>

  <p>"Well," replied Hume rather wearily, "nobody can say that Jaffray is cold
  and hard. The excuse for the whole thing was that he was blind drunk."</p>

  <p>"Then I am to take the word of that liar!" she said fiercely.</p>

  <p>"He's a liar all right," said the tutor gloomily. "And it's a very
  dangerous condition of the Press and the public, when only the liars tell the
  truth."</p>

  <p>Something of a massive gravity in his grim humour for the moment
  overpowered her breathless resentment, and she said in a quieter tone: "Do
  you believe in this demand for self-government?"</p>

  <p>"I'm not very good at believing," he said. "I find it very hard to believe
  that these people cannot live or breathe without votes, when they lived
  contentedly without them for fifty centuries when they had the whole country
  in their own hands. A Parliament may be a good thing; a top-hat may be a good
  thing; your uncle certainly thinks so. We may like or dislike our top-hats.
  But if a wild Turk tells me he has a natural born right to a top-hat, I can't
  help answering: 'Then why the devil didn't you make one for yourself?'"</p>

  <p>"You don't seem to care much for the Nationalists either," she said.</p>

  <p>"Their politicians are often frauds, but they're not alone in that. That's
  why I find myself forced into an intermediate position, a sort of benevolent
  neutrality. It simply seems to be a choice between a lot of blasted
  blackguards and a lot of damned drivelling, doddering idiots. You see I'm a
  Moderate."</p>

  <p>He laughed a little for the first time, and his plain face was suddenly
  altered for the better. She was moved to say in a more friendly tone:</p>

  <p>"Well, we must prevent a real outbreak. You don't want all our people
  murdered."</p>

  <p>"Only a little murdered," he said, still smiling. "Yes, I think I should
  like some of them <i>rather</i> murdered. Not too much, of course; it's a
  question of a sense of proportion."</p>

  <p>"Now you're talking nonsense," she said, "and people in our position can't
  stand any nonsense. Harry says we may have to make an example."</p>

  <p>"I know," he said. "He made several examples when he was in command here,
  before Lord Tallboys came out. It was vigorous&mdash;very vigorous. But I
  think I know what would be better than making an example."</p>

  <p>"And what is that?"</p>

  <p>"Setting an example," said Hume. "What about our own politicians?"</p>

  <p>She said suddenly: "Well, why don't you do something yourself?"</p>

  <p>There was a silence. Then he drew a deep breath. "Ah, there you have me. I
  can't do anything myself. I am futile; naturally and inevitably futile. I
  suffer from a deadly weakness."</p>

  <p>She felt suddenly rather frightened; she had encountered his blank and
  empty eyes.</p>

  <p>"I cannot hate," he said. "I cannot be angry."</p>

  <p>Something in his heavy voice seemed full of quality, like the fall of a
  slab of stone on a sarcophagus; she did not protest, and in her
  subconsciousness yawned a disappointment. She half realized the depth of her
  strange reliance and felt like one who had dug in the desert and found a very
  deep well, and found it dry.</p>

  <p>When she went out on to the veranda the steep garden and plantation were
  grey in the moon, and a certain greyness spread over her own spirit, a mood
  of fatalism and of dull fear. For the first time she realized something of
  what strikes a Western eye in Eastern places as the unnaturalness of nature.
  The squat, limbless growth of the prickly pear was not like the green growths
  of home, springing on light stalks to lovely flowers like butterflies
  captured out of air. It was more like the dead blind bubbling of some green,
  squalid slime: a world of plants that were as plain and flat as stones. She
  hated the hairy surface of some of the squat and swollen trees of that
  grotesque garden; the tufts here and there irritated her fancy as they might
  have tickled her face. She felt that even the big, folded flowers, if they
  opened, would have a foul fragrance. She had a latent sense of the savour of
  faint horror, lying over all as lightly as the faint moonshine. Just as it
  had chilled her most deeply, she looked up and saw something that was neither
  plant nor tree, though it hung as still in the stillness, but it had the
  unique horror of a human face. It was a very white face, but bearded with
  gold like the Greek statues of gold and ivory, and at the temples were two
  golden curls, that might have been the horns of Pan.</p>

  <p>For the moment that motionless head might indeed have been that of some
  terminal god of gardens. But the next moment it had found legs and came to
  life, springing out upon the pathway behind her. She had already gone some
  distance from the hut and was not far from the illuminated grounds of the
  Governorate, whence the music swelled louder as she went. Nevertheless, she
  swung round and faced the other way, looking desperately at the figure she
  recognized. He had abandoned his red fez and black frock-coat and was clad
  completely in white, like many tropical trippers, but it gave him in the
  moonlight something of the silver touch of a spectral harlequin. As he
  advanced he screwed the shining disk into his eye and it revealed in a flash
  the faint memory that had always escaped her. His face in repose was calm and
  classic and might have been the stone mask of Jove rather than Pan. But the
  monocle gathered up his features into a sneer and seemed to draw his eyes
  closer together; and she suddenly saw that he was no more a German than an
  Englishman. And though she had no Anti-Semitic prejudice in particular, she
  felt somehow that in that scene there was something sinister in a fair Jew,
  as in a white negro.</p>

  <p>"We meet under a yet more beautiful sky," he said; she hardly heard what
  else he said. Broken phrases from what she had heard recently tumbled through
  her mind, mere words like "reputation" and "prison", and she stepped back to
  increase the distance, but moving in the opposite direction from which she
  had come. Afterwards she hardly remembered what had happened; he had said
  other things; he had tried to stop her, and an instantaneous impression of
  crushing and startling strength, like a chimpanzee, surprised her into a cry.
  Then she stumbled and ran, but not in the direction of the house of her own
  people.</p>

  <p>Mr. John Hume got out of his chair more quickly than was his wont and went
  to meet someone who stumbled up the stair without.</p>

  <p>"My dear child," he said, and put a hand on her shaking shoulder, giving
  and receiving a queer thrill like a dull electric shock. Then he went, moving
  quickly past her. He had seen something in the moonlight beyond and without
  descending the steps, sprang over the rail to the ground below, standing
  waist-high in the wild and tangled vegetation. There was a screen of large
  leaves waving to and fro between Barbara and the rapid drama that followed,
  but she saw, as in flashes of moonlight, the tutor dart across the path of
  the figure in white and heard the shock of blows and saw a kick like a
  catapult. There was a wheel of silver legs like the arms of the Isle of Man,
  and then out of the dense depth of the lower thicket a spout of curses in a
  tongue that was not English, nor wholly German, but which shrieked and
  chattered in all the Ghettoes of the world. But one strange thing remained
  even in her disordered memory; that when the figure in white had risen
  tottering and turned to plunge down the hill, the white face and the furious
  gesture of malediction were turned, not towards the assailant, but towards
  the house of the Governor.</p>

  <p>The tutor was frowning ponderously as he came again up the veranda steps,
  as if over some of his geometrical problems. She asked him rather wildly what
  he had done and he answered in his heavy voice: "I hope I half killed him.
  You know I am in favour of half measures."</p>

  <p>She laughed rather hysterically and cried: "You said you could not be
  angry."</p>

  <p>Then they suddenly became very stiff and silent and it was with an almost
  fatuous formality that he escorted her down the slope to the very doors of
  the dancing-rooms. The sky behind the green pergolas of foliage was a vivid
  violet or some sort of blue that seemed warmer than any red; and the furry
  filaments of the great tree-trunks seemed like the quaint sea-beasts of
  childhood, which could be stroked and which unfolded their fingers. There was
  something upon them both beyond speech or even silence. He even went so far
  as to say it was a fine night.</p>

  <p>"Yes," she answered, "it is a fine night"; and felt instantly as if she
  had betrayed some secret.</p>

  <p>They went through the inner gardens to the gate of the vestibule, which
  was crowded with people in uniform and evening dress. They parted with the
  utmost formality; and that night neither of them slept.</p><hr><br>

  <h2><a name="c014"
     id="c014">IV</a>. &mdash; THE DETECTIVE AND THE PARSON</h2>

<p class="first">It was not until the following evening, as already noted,
that the news
  came that the Governor had fallen by a shot from an unknown hand. And Barbara
  Traill received the news later than most of her friends, because she had
  departed rather abruptly that morning for a long ramble amid the ruins and
  plantations of palm, in the immediate neighbourhood. She took a sort of
  picnic basket with her, but light as was her visible luggage, it would be
  true to say that she went away to unpack upon a large scale. She went to
  unfold a sort of invisible <i>impedimenta</i> which had accumulated in her
  memories, especially her memories of the night before. This sort of impetuous
  solitude was characteristic of her, but it had an immediate effect which was
  rather fortunate in her case. For the first news was the worst, and when she
  returned the worst had been much modified. It was first reported that her
  uncle was dead; then that he was dying; finally that he had only been wounded
  and had every prospect of recovery. She walked with her empty basket straight
  into the hubbub of discussion about these things, and soon found that the
  police operations for the discovery and pursuit of the criminal were already
  far advanced. The inquiry was in the hands of a hard-headed, hatchet-faced
  officer named Hayter, the chief of the detective force; who was being
  actively seconded by young Meade, the secretary of the Governor. But she was
  rather more surprised to find her friend the tutor in the very centre of the
  group, being questioned about his own recent experiences.</p>

  <p>The next moment she felt a strange sort of surge of subconscious
  annoyance, as she realized the subject-matter of the questions. The
  questioners were Meade and Hayter; but it was significant that they had just
  received the news that Sir Harry Smythe, with characteristic energy, had
  arrested Dr. Paulus Gregory, the dubious foreigner with the big beard. The
  tutor was being examined about his own last glimpse of that questionable
  public character, and Barbara felt a secret fury at finding the affair of the
  night before turned into a public problem of police. She felt as if she had
  come down in the morning to find the whole breakfast-table talking about some
  very intimate dream she had had in the middle of the night. For though she
  had carried that picture with her as she wandered among the tombs and the
  green thickets, she had felt it as something as much peculiar to herself as
  if she had had a vision in the wilderness. The bland, black-haired Mr. Meade
  was especially insinuating in his curiosity. She told herself, in a highly
  unreasonable fashion, that she had always hated Arthur Meade.</p>

  <p>"I gather," the secretary was saying, "that you have excellent reasons of
  your own for regarding this man as a dangerous character."</p>

  <p>"I regard him as a rotter and I always did," replied Hume in a rather
  sulky and reluctant manner. "I did have a bit of a kick up with him last
  night, but it didn't make any difference to my views, nor to his either, I
  should think."</p>

  <p>"It seems to me it might make a considerable difference," persisted Meade.
  "Isn't it true that he went away cursing not only you but especially the
  Governor? And he went away down the hill towards the place where the Governor
  was shot. It's true he wasn't shot till a good time after, and nobody seems
  to have seen his assailant; but he might have hung about in the woods and
  then crept out along the wall at dusk."</p>

  <p>"Having helped himself to a gun from the gun-tree that grows wild in these
  woods, I suppose," said the tutor sardonically. "I swear he had no gun or
  pistol on him when I threw him into the prickly pear."</p>

  <p>"You seem to be making the speech for the defence," said the secretary
  with a faint sneer. "But you yourself said he was a pretty doubtful
  character."</p>

  <p>"I don't think he is in the least a doubtful character," replied the tutor
  in his stolid way. "I haven't the least doubt about him myself. I think he is
  a loose, lying, vicious braggart and humbug; a selfish, sensual mountebank.
  So I'm pretty sure that he didn't shoot the Governor, whoever else did."</p>

  <p>Colonel Hayter cocked a shrewd eye at the speaker and spoke himself for
  the first time.</p>

  <p>"Ah&mdash;and what do you mean by that exactly?"</p>

  <p>"I mean what I say," answered Hume. "It's exactly because he's that sort
  of rascal that he didn't commit that sort of rascality. Agitators of his type
  never do things themselves; they incite other people; they hold meetings and
  send round the hat and then vanish, to do the same thing somewhere else. It's
  a jolly different sort of person that's left to take the risks of playing
  Brutus or Charlotte Corday. But I confess there are two other little bits of
  evidence, which I think clear the fellow completely."</p>

  <p>He put two fingers in his waistcoat pocket and slowly and thoughtfully
  drew out a round, flat piece of glass with a broken string.</p>

  <p>"I picked this up on the spot where we struggled," he said. "It's
  Gregory's eyeglass; and if you look through it you won't see anything, except
  the fact that a man who wanted a lens as strong as that could see next to
  nothing without it. He certainly couldn't see to shoot as far as the end of
  the wall from the sycamore, which is whereabouts they think the shot must
  have been fired from."</p>

  <p>"There may be something in that," said Hayter, "though the man might have
  had another glass, of course. You said you had a second reason for thinking
  him innocent."</p>

  <p>"The second reason," said Hume, "is that Sir Harry Smythe has just
  arrested him."</p>

  <p>"What on earth do you mean?" asked Meade sharply. "Why, you brought us the
  message from Sir Harry yourself."</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid I brought it rather imperfectly," said the other, in a dull
  voice. "It's quite true Sir Harry has arrested the doctor, but he'd arrested
  him before he heard of the attempt on Lord Tallboys. He had just arrested him
  for holding a seditious meeting five miles away at Pentapolis, at which he
  made an eloquent speech, which must have reached its beautiful peroration
  about the time when Tallboys was being shot at, here at the corner of the
  road."</p>

  <p>"Good Lord!" cried Meade, staring, "you seem to know a lot about this
  business."</p>

  <p>The rather sullen tutor lifted his head and looked straight at the
  secretary with a steady but rather baffling gaze.</p>

  <p>"Perhaps I do know a little about it," he said. "Anyhow, I'm quite sure
  Gregory's got a good alibi."</p>

  <p>Barbara had listened to this curious conversation with a confused and
  rather painful attention; but as the case against Gregory seemed to be
  crumbling away, a new emotion of her own began to work its way to the
  surface. She began to realize that she had wanted Gregory to be made
  responsible, not out of any particular malice towards him, but because it
  would explain and dispose of the whole incident, and dismiss it from her mind
  along with another disturbing but hardly conscious thought. Now that the
  criminal had again become a nameless shadow, he began to haunt her mind with
  dreadful hints of identity and she had spasms of fear, in which that shadowy
  figure was suddenly fitted with a face.</p>

  <p>As has been already noted, Barbara Traill was a little morbid about her
  brother and the tragedy of the Traills. She was an omnivorous reader; she had
  been the sort of schoolgirl who is always found in a corner with a book. And
  this means generally, under modern conditions, that she read everything she
  could not understand some time before she read anything that she could. Her
  mind was a hotch-potch of popular science about heredity and psycho-analysis,
  and the whole trend of her culture tended to make her pessimistic about
  everything. People in this mood never have any difficulty in finding reasons
  for their worst fears. And it was enough for her that, the very morning
  before her uncle was shot, he had been publicly insulted, and even crazily
  threatened, by her brother.</p>

  <p>That sort of psychological poison works itself deeper and deeper into the
  brain. Barbara's broodings branched and thickened like a dark forest; and did
  not stop with the thought that a dull, undeveloped schoolboy was really a
  maniac and a murderer. The unnatural generalizations of the books she had
  read pushed her farther and farther. If her brother, why not her sister? If
  her sister, why not herself? Here memory exaggerated and distorted the
  distracted demeanour of her sister in the flower-garden, till she could
  almost fancy that Olive had torn up the flowers with her teeth. As is always
  the case in such unbalanced worry, all sorts of accidents took on a terrible
  significance. Her sister had said, "Is there not something the matter with
  all of us?" What could that mean but such a family curse? Hume himself had
  said he was not the only mad person present. What else could that mean? Even
  Dr. Gregory had declared after talking to her, that her race was degenerate;
  did he mean that her family was degenerate? After all, he was a doctor, if he
  was a wicked one. Each of these hateful coincidences gave her a spiritual
  shock, so that she almost cried aloud when she thought of it. Meanwhile the
  rest of her mind went round and round in the iron circle of all such logic
  from hell. She told herself again and again that she was being morbid, and
  then told herself again and again that she was only morbid because she was
  mad. But she was not in the least mad, she was only young, and thousands of
  young people go through such a phase of nightmare, and nobody knows or
  helps.</p>

  <p>But she was moved with a curious impulse in the search for help, and it
  was the same impulse that had driven her back across the moonlit glade to the
  wooden hut upon the hill. She was actually mounting that hill again, when she
  met John Hume coming down.</p>

  <p>She poured out all her domestic terrors and suspicions in a flood, as she
  had poured out all her patriotic doubts and protests, with a confused
  confidence which rested on no defined reason or relation and yet was sure of
  itself.</p>

  <p>"So there it is," she said at the end of her impetuous monologue. "I began
  by being quite sure that poor Tom had done it. But by this time I feel as if
  I might have done it myself."</p>

  <p>"Well, that's logical enough," agreed Hume. "It's about as sensible to say
  that you are guilty as that Tom is. And about as sensible to say the
  Archbishop of Canterbury is guilty as either of you."</p>

  <p>She attempted to explain her highly scientific guesses about heredity, and
  their effect was more marked. They succeeded at least in arousing this large
  and slow person to a sort of animation.</p>

  <p>"Now the devil take all doctors and scientists," he cried, "or rather the
  devil take all novelists and newspaper-men who talk about what even the
  doctors don't understand! People abuse the old nurses for frightening
  children with bogies which pretty soon became a joke. What about the new
  nurses who let children frighten themselves with all the black bogies they
  are supposed to take seriously? My dear girl, there is nothing the matter
  with your brother, any more than with you. He's only what they call a
  protected neurotic, which is their long-winded way of saying he has an extra
  skin that the Public School varnish won't stick on, but runs off like water
  off a duck's back. So much the better for him, as likely as not, in the long
  run. But even suppose he did remain a little more like a child than the rest
  of us. Is there anything particularly horrible about a child? Do you shudder
  when you think of your dog, merely because he's happy and fond of you and yet
  can't do the forty-eighth proposition of Euclid? Being a dog is not a
  disease. Being a child is not a disease. Even remaining a child is not a
  disease; don't you sometimes wish we could all remain children?"</p>

  <p>She was of the sort that grapples with notions and suggestions one after
  another, as they come, and she stood silent, but her mind was busy like a
  mill. It was he who spoke again, and more lightly.</p>

  <p>"It's like what we were saying about making examples. I think the world is
  much too solemn and severe about punishments; it would be far better if it
  were ruled like a nursery. People don't want penal servitude and execution
  and all the rest. What most people want is to have their ears boxed or be
  sent to bed. What fun it would be to take an unscrupulous millionaire and
  make him stand in the corner! Such an appropriate penalty."</p>

  <p>When she spoke again there was in her tones something of relief and a
  renewed curiosity.</p>

  <p>"What do you do with Tom?" she asked, "and what's the meaning of all those
  funny triangles?"</p>

  <p>"I play the fool," he replied gravely. "What he wants is to have his
  attention aroused and fixed; and foolery always does that for children; very
  obvious foolery. Don't you know how they have always liked such images as the
  cow jumping over the moon? It's the educational effect of riddles. Well, I
  have to be the riddle. I have to keep him wondering what I mean or what I
  shall do next. It means being an ass; but it's the only way."</p>

  <p>"Yes," she answered slowly, "there's something awfully rousing about
  riddles . . . all sorts of riddles. Even that old parson with his riddles out
  of Revelations makes you feel he has something to live for . . . by the way,
  I believe we promised to go to tea there this afternoon; I've been in a state
  to forget everything."</p>

  <p>Even as she spoke she saw her sister Olive coming up the path attired in
  the unmistakable insignia of one paying calls, and accompanied by her sturdy
  husband, the Deputy Governor, who did not often attend these social
  functions.</p>

  <p>They all went down the road together and Barbara was vaguely surprised to
  see ahead of them on the same road, not only the sleek and varnished figure
  of Mr. Meade the secretary, but also the more angular outline of Colonel
  Hayter. The clergyman's invitation had evidently been a comprehensive
  one.</p>

  <p>The Rev. Ernest Snow lived in a very modest manner in one of the little
  houses that had been erected in a row for the minor officials of the
  Governorate. It was at the back of this line of villas that the path ran
  along the garden wall and past the sycamore to the bunch of olives and
  finally to the corner where the Governor had fallen by the mysterious bullet.
  That path fringed the open desert and had all the character of a rude, beaten
  path for the desert pilgrims. But walking on the other side, in front of the
  row of houses, a traveller might well have imagined himself in any London
  suburb, so regular were the ornamental railings and so identical the porticos
  and the small front-garden plots. Nothing but a number distinguished the
  house of the clergyman, and the entrance to it was so prim and narrow that
  the group of guests from the Governorate had some difficulty in squeezing
  through it.</p>

  <p>Mr. Snow bowed over Olive's hand with a ceremony that seemed to make his
  white hair a ghost of eighteenth-century powder, but also with something else
  that seemed at first a shade more difficult to define. It was something that
  went with the lowered voice and lifted hand of his profession at certain
  moments. His face was composed, but it would almost seem deliberately
  composed; and in spite of his grieved tone his eyes were very bright and
  steady. Barbara suddenly realized that he was conducting a funeral, and she
  was not far out.</p>

  <p>"I need not tell you, Lady Smythe," he said in the same soft accents,
  "what sympathy we all feel in this terrible hour. If only from a public
  standpoint, the death of your distinguished uncle&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Olive Smythe struck in with a rather wild stare.</p>

  <p>"But my uncle isn't dead, Mr. Snow. I know they said so at first, but he
  only got a shot in his leg and he is trying to limp about already."</p>

  <p>A shock of transformation passed over the clergyman's face, too quick for
  most eyes to follow; it seemed to Barbara that his jaw dropped and when it
  readjusted itself, it was in a grin of utterly artificial congratulation.</p>

  <p>"My dear lady," he breathed, "for this relief&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He looked round a little vacantly at the furniture. Whether the Rev.
  Ernest Snow had remembered to prepare tea at tea-time, was not yet quite
  clear, but the preparations he had made seemed to be of a less assuaging
  sort. The little tables were loaded with large books, many of them lying
  open, and these were mostly traced with sprawling plans and designs, mostly
  architectural or generally archæological, in some cases apparently
  astronomical or astrological, but giving as a whole a hazy impression of a
  magician's spells or a library of the black art.</p>

  <p>"Apocalyptic studies," he stammered, "a hobby of mine. I believed that my
  calculations . . . . These things are written for our instruction."</p>

  <p>And then Barbara felt a final stab of astonishment and alarm. For two
  facts became instantly and simultaneously vivid to her consciousness. The
  first was that the Rev. Ernest Snow had been reposing upon the fact of the
  Governor's death with something very like a solemn satisfaction, and had
  heard of his recovery with something quite other than relief. And the second
  was that he spoke with the same voice that had once uttered the same words,
  out of the shadow of the sycamore, that sounded in her ears like a wild cry
  for blood.</p><hr><br>

  <h2><a name="c015"
     id="c015">V</a>. &mdash; THE THEORY OF MODERATE MURDER</h2>

<p class="first">Colonel Hayter, the Chief of the Police, was moving towards
the inner
  rooms with a motion that was casual but not accidental. Barbara indeed had
  rather wondered why such an official had accompanied them on a purely social
  visit, and she now began to entertain dim and rather incredible
  possibilities. The clergyman had turned away to one of the bookstands and was
  turning over the leaves of a volume with feverish excitement; it seemed
  almost that he was muttering to himself. He was a little like a man looking
  up a quotation on which he has been challenged.</p>

  <p>"I hear you have a very nice garden here, Mr. Snow," said Hayter. "I
  should rather like to look at your garden."</p>

  <p>Snow turned a startled face over his shoulder; he seemed at first unable
  to detach his mind from his preoccupation; then he said sharply but a little
  shakily, "There's nothing to see in my garden; nothing at all. I was just
  wondering&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Do you mind if I have a squint at it?" asked Hayter indifferently, and
  shouldered his way to the back door. There was something resolute about his
  action that made the others trail vaguely after him, hardly knowing what they
  did. Hume, who was just behind the detective, said to him in an undertone:
  "What do you expect to find growing in the old man's garden?"</p>

  <p>Hayter looked over his shoulder with a grim geniality.</p>

  <p>"Only a particular sort of tree you were talking of lately," he said.</p>

  <p>But when they went out into the neat and narrow strip of back garden, the
  only tree in sight was the sycamore spreading over the desert path, and
  Barbara remembered with another subconscious thrill that this was the spot
  from which, as the experts calculated, the bullet had been fired.</p>

  <p>Hayter strode across the lawn and was seen stooping over something in the
  tangle of tropical plants under the wall. When he straightened himself again
  he was seen to be holding a long and heavy cylindrical object.</p>

  <p>"Here is something fallen from the gun-tree you said grew in these parts,"
  he said grimly. "Funny that the gun should be found in Mr. Snow's
  back-garden, isn't it? Especially as it's a double-barrelled gun with one
  barrel discharged."</p>

  <p>Hume was staring at the big gun in the detective's hand, and for the first
  time his usually stolid face wore an expression of amazement and even
  consternation.</p>

  <p>"Damn it all!" he said softly, "I forgot about that. What a rotten fool I
  am!"</p>

  <p>Few except Barbara even heard his strange whisper, and nobody could make
  any sense of it. Suddenly he swung round and addressed the whole company
  aloud, almost as if they were a public meeting.</p>

  <p>"Look here," he said, "do you know what this means? This means that poor
  old Snow, who is probably still fussing over his hieroglyphics, is going to
  be charged with attempted murder."</p>

  <p>"It's a bit premature," said Hayter, "and some would say you were
  interfering in our job, Mr. Hume. But I owe you something for putting us
  right about the other fellow, when I admit we were wrong."</p>

  <p>"You were wrong about the other fellow and you are wrong about this
  fellow," said Hume, frowning savagely. "But I happened to be able to offer
  you evidence in the other case. What evidence can I give now?"</p>

  <p>"Why should you have any evidence to give?" asked the other, very much
  puzzled.</p>

  <p>"Well, I have," said Hume, "and I jolly well don't want to give it." He
  was silent for a moment and then broke out in a sort of fury: "Blast it all,
  can't you see how silly it is to drag in that silly old man? Don't you see
  he'd only fallen in love with his own prophecies of disaster, and was a bit
  put off when they didn't come true after all?"</p>

  <p>"There are a good many more suspicious circumstances," cut in Smythe
  curtly. "There's the gun in the garden and the position of the sycamore."</p>

  <p>There was a long silence during which Hume stood with huge hunched
  shoulders frowning resentfully at his boots. Then he suddenly threw up his
  head and spoke with a sort of explosive lightness.</p>

  <p>"Oh, well then, I must give my evidence," he said, with a smile that was
  almost gay: "I shot the Governor myself."</p>

  <p>There was a stillness as if the place had been full of statues, and for a
  few seconds nobody moved or spoke. Then Barbara heard her own voice in the
  silence, crying out:</p>

  <p>"Oh, you didn't!"</p>

  <p>A moment later the Chief of Police was speaking with a new and much more
  official voice:</p>

  <p>"I should like to know whether you are joking," he said, "or whether you
  really mean to give yourself up for the attempted murder of Lord
  Tallboys."</p>

  <p>Hume held up one hand in an arresting gesture, almost like a public
  speaker. He was still smiling slightly, but his manner had grown more
  grave.</p>

  <p>"Pardon me," he said. "Pardon me. Let us distinguish. The distinction is
  of great value to my self-esteem. I did not try to murder the Governor. I
  tried to shoot him in the leg and I did shoot him in the leg."</p>

  <p>"What is the sense of all this?" cried Smythe with impatience.</p>

  <p>"I am sorry to appear punctilious," said Hume calmly. "Imputations on my
  morals I must bear, like other members of the criminal class. But imputations
  on my marksmanship I cannot tolerate; it is the only sport in which I excel."
  He picked up the double-barrelled gun before they could stop him and went on
  rapidly: "And may I draw attention to one technical point? This gun has two
  barrels and one is still undischarged. If any fool had shot Tallboys at that
  distance and not killed him, don't you think even a fool would have shot
  again, if that was what he wanted to do? Only, you see, it was not what I
  wanted to do."</p>

  <p>"You seem to fancy yourself a lot as a marksman," said the Deputy Governor
  rudely.</p>

  <p>"Ah, you are sceptical," replied the tutor in the same airy tone. "Well,
  Sir Harry, you have yourself provided the apparatus of demonstration, and it
  will not take a moment. The targets which we owe to your patriotic efficiency
  are already set up, I think, on the slope just beyond the end of the wall."
  Before anybody could move he had hopped up on to the low garden wall, just
  under the shadow of the sycamore. From that perch he could see the long line
  of the butts stretching along the border of the desert.</p>

  <p>"Suppose we say," he said pleasantly, in the tone of a popular lecturer,
  "that I put this bullet about an inch inside the white on the second
  target."</p>

  <p>The group awoke from its paralysis of surprise; Hayter ran forward and
  Smythe burst out with: "Of all the damned tomfoolery&mdash;"</p>

  <p>His sentence was drowned in the deafening explosion, and amid the echoes
  of it the tutor dropped serenely from the wall.</p>

  <p>"If anybody cares to go and look," he said, "I think he will find the
  demonstration of my innocence&mdash;not indeed of shooting the Governor, but
  of wanting to shoot him anywhere else but where I did shoot him."</p>

  <p>There was another silence, and then this comedy of unexpected happenings
  was crowned with another that was still more unexpected; coming from the one
  person whom everybody had naturally forgotten.</p>

  <p>Tom's high, crowing voice was suddenly heard above the crowd.</p>

  <p>"Who's going to look?" he cried. "Well, why don't you go and look?"</p>

  <p>It was almost as if a tree in the garden had spoken. And indeed the
  excitement of events had worked upon that vegetating brain till it unfolded
  rapidly, as do some vegetables at the touch of chemistry. Nor was this all,
  for the next moment the vegetable had taken on a highly animal energy and
  hurled itself across the garden. They saw a whirl of lanky limbs against the
  sky as Tom Traill cleared the garden wall and went plunging away through the
  sand towards the targets.</p>

  <p>"Is this place a lunatic asylum?" cried Sir Harry Smythe, his face still
  more congested with colour and a baleful light in his eyes, as if a big but
  buried temper was working its way to the surface.</p>

  <p>"Come, Mr. Hume," said Hayter in a cooler tone, "everybody regards you as
  a very sensible man. Do you mean to tell me seriously that you put a bullet
  in the Governor's leg for no reason at all, not even murder?"</p>

  <p>"I did it for an excellent reason," answered the tutor, still beaming at
  him in a rather baffling manner. "I did it because I am a sensible man. In
  fact, I am a Moderate Murderer."</p>

  <p>"And what the blazes may that be?"</p>

  <p>"The philosophy of moderation in murder," continued the tutor blandly, "is
  one to which I have given some little attention. I was saying only the other
  day that what most people want is to be rather murdered, especially persons
  in responsible political situations. As it is, the punishments on both sides
  are far too severe. The merest touch or <i>soupçon</i> of murder is all that
  is required for purposes of reform. The little more and how much it is; the
  little less and the Governor of Polybia gets clean away, as Browning
  said."</p>

  <p>"Do you really ask me to believe," snorted the Chief of Police, "that you
  make a practice of potting every public man in the left leg?"</p>

  <p>"No, no," said Hume, with a sort of hasty solemnity. "The treatment, I
  assure you, is marked with much more individual attention. Had it been the
  Chancellor of the Exchequer, I should perhaps have selected a portion of the
  left ear. In the case of the Prime Minister the tip of the nose would be
  indicated. But the point is the general principle that <i>something</i>
  should happen to these people, to arouse their dormant faculties by a little
  personal problem. Now if ever there was a man," he went on with delicate
  emphasis, as if it were a scientific demonstration, "if ever there was a man
  meant and marked out by nature to be rather murdered, it is Lord Tallboys.
  Other eminent men, very often, are just murdered, and everyone feels that the
  situation has been adequately met, that the incident is terminated. One just
  murders them and thinks no more about it. But Tallboys is a remarkable case;
  he is my employer and I know him pretty well. He is a good fellow, really. He
  is a gentleman, he is a patriot; what is more, he is really a liberal and
  reasonable man. But by being perpetually in office he has let that pompous
  manner get worse and worse, till it seems to grow on him, like his confounded
  top-hat. What is needed in such a case? A few days in bed, I decided. A few
  healthful weeks standing on one leg and meditating on that fine shade of
  distinction between oneself and God Almighty, which is so easily
  overlooked."</p>

  <p>"Don't listen to any more of this rubbish," cried the Deputy-Governor. "If
  he says he shot Tallboys, we've got to take him up for it, I suppose. He
  ought to know."</p>

  <p>"You've hit it at last, Sir Harry," said Hume heartily, "I'm arousing a
  lot of dormant intellects this afternoon."</p>

  <p>"We won't have any more of your joking," cried Smythe with sudden fury;
  "I'm arresting you for attempted murder."</p>

  <p>"I know," answered the smiling tutor, "that's the joke."</p>

  <p>At this moment there was another leap and scurry by the sycamore and the
  boy Tom hurled himself back into the garden, panting aloud:</p>

  <p>"It's quite right. It's just where he said."</p>

  <p>For the rest of the interview, and until that strange group had broken up
  on the lawn, the boy continued to stare at Hume as only a boy can stare at
  somebody who has done something rather remarkable in a game. But as he and
  Barbara went back to the Governorate together, the latter indescribably dazed
  and bewildered, she found her companion curiously convinced of some view of
  his own, which he was hardly competent to describe. It was not exactly as if
  he disbelieved Hume or his story. It was rather as if he believed what Hume
  had not said, rather than what he had.</p>

  <p>"It's a riddle," repeated Tom with stubborn solemnity. "He's awfully fond
  of riddles. He says silly things just to make you think. That's what we've
  got to do. He doesn't like you to give it up."</p>

  <p>"What we've got to do?" repeated Barbara.</p>

  <p>"Think what it really means," said Tom.</p>

  <p>There was some truth perhaps in the suggestion that Mr. John Hume was fond
  of riddles, for he fired off one more of them at the Chief of Police, even as
  that official took him into custody.</p>

  <p>"Well," he said cheerfully, "you can only half hang me because I'm only
  half a murderer. I suppose you have hanged people sometimes?"</p>

  <p>"Occasionally, I'm sorry to say," replied Colonel Hayter.</p>

  <p>"Did you ever hang somebody to prevent him being hanged?" asked the tutor
  with interest.</p><hr><br>

  <h2><a name="c016"
     id="c016">VI</a>. &mdash; THE THING THAT REALLY HAPPENED</h2>

<p class="first">It is not true that Lord Tallboys wore his top-hat in bed,
during his
  brief indisposition. Nor is it true, as was more moderately alleged, that he
  sent for it as soon as he could stand upright and wore it as a finishing
  touch to a costume consisting of a green dressing-gown and red slippers. But
  it was quite true that he resumed his hat and his high official duties at the
  earliest possible opportunity; rather to the annoyance, it was said, of his
  subordinate the Deputy-Governor, who found himself for the second time
  checked in some of those vigorous military measures which are always more
  easily effected after the shock of a political outrage. In plain words, the
  Deputy-Governor was rather sulky. He had relapsed into a red-faced and
  irritable silence, and when he broke it his friends rather wished he would
  relapse into it again. At the mention of the eccentric tutor, whom his
  department had taken into custody, he exploded with a special impatience and
  disgust. "Oh, for God's sake don't tell me about that beastly madman and
  mountebank!" he cried, almost in the voice of one tortured and unable to
  tolerate a moment more of human folly. "Why in the world we are cursed with
  such filthy fools . . . shooting him in the leg . . . moderate murderer . . .
  mouldy swine!"</p>

  <p>"He's not a mouldy swine," said Barbara Traill emphatically, as if it were
  an exact point of natural history. "I don't believe a word of what you people
  are saying against him."</p>

  <p>"Do you believe what he is saying against himself?" asked her uncle,
  looking at her with screwed-up eyes and a quizzical expression. Tallboys was
  leaning on a crutch; in marked contrast to the sullenness of Sir Harry
  Smythe, he carried his disablement in a very plucky and pleasant fashion. The
  necessity of attending to the interrupted rhythm of his legs had apparently
  arrested the oratorical rotation of his hands. His family felt that they had
  never liked him so much before. It seemed almost as if there were some truth
  in the theory of the Moderate Murderer.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, Sir Harry Smythe, usually so much more good-humoured
  with his family, seemed to be in an increasingly bad humour. The dark red of
  his complexion deepened, until by contrast there was something almost
  alarming about the light of his pale eyes.</p>

  <p>"I tell you of all these measly, meddlesome blighters," he began.</p>

  <p>"And I tell you you know nothing about it," retorted his sister-in-law.
  "He isn't a bit like that; he&mdash;"</p>

  <p>At this point, for some reason or other, it was Olive who intervened
  swiftly and quietly; she looked a little wan and worried.</p>

  <p>"Don't let's talk about all that now," she said hastily. "Harry has got
  such a lot of things to do. . . ."</p>

  <p>"I know what I'm going to do," said Barbara stubbornly. "I'm going to ask
  Lord Tallboys, as Governor of this place, if he will let me visit Mr. Hume
  and see if I can find out what it means."</p>

  <p>She had become for some reason violently excited and her own voice sounded
  strangely in her ears. She had a dizzy impression of Harry Smythe's eyes
  standing out of his head in apoplectic anger and of Olive's face in the
  background growing more and more unnaturally pale and staring, and hovering
  over all, with something approaching to an elvish mockery, the benevolent
  amusement of her uncle. She felt as if he had let out too much, or that he
  had gained a new subtlety of perception.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile John Hume was sitting in his place of detention, staring at a
  blank wall with an equally blank face. Accustomed as he was to solitude, he
  soon found something of a strain in two or three days and nights of the
  dehumanized solitude of imprisonment. Perhaps the fact most vivid to his
  immediate senses was being deprived of tobacco. But he had other and what
  some could call graver grounds of depression. He did not know what sort of
  sentence he would be likely to get for confessing to an attempt to wound the
  Governor. But he knew enough of political conditions and legal expedients to
  know that it would be easy to inflict heavy punishment immediately after the
  public scandal of the crime. He had lived in that outpost of civilization for
  the last ten years, till Tallboys had picked him up in Cairo; he remembered
  the violent reaction after the murder of the previous Governor, the way in
  which the Deputy-Governor had been able to turn himself into a despot and
  sweep the country with coercion acts and punitive expeditions, until his
  impulsive militarism had been a little moderated by the arrival of Tallboys
  with a compromise from the home Government. Tallboys was still alive and
  even, in a modified manner, kicking. But he was probably still under doctor's
  orders and could hardly be judge in his own cause; so that the autocratic
  Smythe would probably have another chance of riding the whirlwind and
  directing the storm. But the truth is that there was at the back of the
  prisoner's mind something that he feared much more than prison. The tiny
  point of panic, which had begun to worry and eat away even his rocky
  stolidity of mind and body, was the fear that his fantastic explanation had
  given his enemies another sort of opportunity. What he really feared was
  their saying he was mad and putting him under more humane and hygienic
  treatment.</p>

  <p>And indeed, anyone watching his demeanour for the next hour or so might be
  excused for entertaining doubts and fancies on the point. He was still
  staring before him in a rather strange fashion. But he was no longer staring
  as if he saw nothing, but rather as if he saw something. It seemed to himself
  that, like a hermit in his cell, he was seeing visions.</p>

  <p>"Well, I suppose I am, after all," he said aloud in a dead and distinct
  voice. "Didn't St. Paul say something? . . . Wherefore, O King Agrippa, I was
  not disobedient to the heavenly vision. . . . I have seen that heavenly one
  coming in at the door like that several times, and rather hoped it was real.
  But real people can't come through prison doors like that. . . . Once it came
  so that the room might have been full of trumpets and once with a cry like
  the wind and there was a fight and I found out that I could hate and that I
  could love. Two miracles on one night. Don't you think that must have been a
  dream&mdash;that is supposing you weren't a dream and could think anything?
  But I did rather hope you were real then."</p>

  <p>"Don't!" said Barbara Trail, "I am real now."</p>

  <p>"Do you mean to tell me in cold blood that I am not mad," asked Hume,
  still staring at her, "and you are here?"</p>

  <p>"You are the only sane person I ever knew," she replied.</p>

  <p>"Good Lord," he said, "then I've said a good deal just now that ought only
  to be said in lunatic asylums&mdash;or in heavenly visions."</p>

  <p>"You have said so much," she said in a low voice, "that I want you to say
  much more. I mean about the whole of this trouble. After what you have said .
  . . don't you think I might be allowed to know?"</p>

  <p>He frowned at the table and then said rather more abruptly:</p>

  <p>"The trouble was that I thought you were the last person who ought to
  know. You see, there is your family, and you might be brought into it, and
  one might have to hold one's tongue for the sake of someone you would care
  about."</p>

  <p>"Well," she said steadily, "I <i>have</i> been brought into it for the
  sake of someone I care about."</p>

  <p>She paused a moment and went on: "The others never did anything for me.
  They would have let me go raving mad in a respectable flat, and so long as I
  was finished at a fashionable school, they wouldn't have cared if I'd
  finished myself with laudanum. I never really talked to anybody before. I
  don't want to talk to anybody else now."</p>

  <p>He sprang to his feet; something like an earthquake had shaken him at last
  out of his long petrified incredulity about happiness. He caught her by both
  hands and words came out of him he had never dreamed were within. And she,
  who was younger in years, only stared at him with a steady smile and starry
  eyes, as if she were older and wiser; and at the end only said:</p>

  <p>"You will tell me now."</p>

  <p>"You must understand," he said at last more soberly, "that what I said was
  true. I was not making up fairy-tales to shield my long-lost brother from
  Australia, or any of that business in the novels. I really did put a bullet
  in your uncle, and I meant to put it there."</p>

  <p>"I know," she said, "but for all that I'm sure I don't know everything.
  I'm sure there is some extraordinary story behind all this."</p>

  <p>"No," he answered. "It isn't an extraordinary story, except an
  extraordinarily ordinary story."</p>

  <p>He paused a moment reflectively and then went on:</p>

  <p>"It's really a particularly plain and simple story. I wonder it hasn't
  happened hundreds of times before. I wonder it hasn't been told in hundreds
  of stories before. It might so easily happen anywhere, given certain
  conditions.</p>

  <p>"In this case you know some of the conditions. You know that sort of
  balcony that runs round my bungalow, and how one looks down from it and sees
  the whole landscape like a map. Well, I was looking down and saw all that
  flat plan of the place; the row of villas and the wall and path running
  behind it and the sycamore, and farther on the olives and the end of the
  wall, and so out into the open slopes being laid out with turf and all the
  rest. But I saw what surprised me; that the rifle-range was already set up.
  It must have been a rush order; people must have worked all night. And even
  as I stared, I saw in the distance a dot that was a man standing by the
  nearest target, as if adding the last touches. Then he made a sort of signal
  to somebody away on the other side and moved very rapidly away from the
  place. Tiny as the figure looked, every gesture told me something; he was
  quite obviously clearing out just before the firing at the target was to
  begin. And almost at the same moment I saw something else. Well, I saw one
  thing, anyhow. I saw why Lady Smythe is worried, and wandered distracted in
  the garden."</p>

  <p>Barbara stared, but he went on: "Travelling along the path from the
  Governorate and towards the sycamore was a familiar shape. It just showed
  above the long garden wall in sharp outline like a shape in a shadow
  pantomime. It was the top-hat of Lord Tallboys. Then I remembered that he
  always went for a constitutional along this path and out on to the slopes
  beyond; and I felt an overwhelming suspicion that he did not know that the
  space beyond was already a firing-ground. You know he is very deaf, and I
  sometimes doubt whether he hears all the things officially told to him;
  sometimes I fear they are told so that he cannot hear. Anyhow, he had every
  appearance of marching straight across as usual, and there came over me in a
  cataract a solid, an overwhelming and a most shocking certainty.</p>

  <p>"I will not say much about that now. I will say as little as I can for the
  rest of my life. But there were things I knew and you probably don't about
  the politics here and what had led up to that dreadful moment. Enough that I
  had good reason for my dread. Feeling vaguely that if things were interrupted
  there might be a fight, I snatched up my own gun and dashed down the slope
  towards the path, waving wildly and trying to hail or head him off. He didn't
  see me and couldn't hear me. I pounded along after him along the path, but he
  had too long a start. By the time I reached the sycamore, I knew I was too
  late. He was already half-way down the grove of olives and no mortal runner
  could reach him before he came to the corner.</p>

  <p>"I felt a rage against the fool which a man looks against the background
  of fate. I saw his lean, pompous figure with the absurd top-hat riding on top
  of it; and the large ears standing out from his head . . . the large, useless
  ears. There was something agonizingly grotesque about that unconscious back
  outlined against the plains of death. For I was certain that the moment he
  passed the corner that field would be swept by the fire, which would cut
  across at right angles to his progress. I could think of only one thing to do
  and I did it. Hayter thought I was mad when I asked him if he had ever hanged
  a man to prevent his being hanged. That is the sort of practical joke I
  played. I shot a man to prevent his being shot.</p>

  <p>"I put a bullet in his calf and he dropped, about two yards from the
  corner. I waited a moment and saw that people were coming out of the last
  houses to pick him up. I did the only thing I really regret. I had a vague
  idea the house by the sycamore was empty, so I threw the gun over the wall
  into the garden, and nearly got that poor old ass of a parson into trouble.
  Then I went home and waited till they summoned me to give evidence about
  Gregory."</p>

  <p>He concluded with all his normal composure, but the girl was still staring
  at him with an abnormal attention and even alarm.</p>

  <p>"But what was it all about?' she asked. "Who could have&mdash;?"</p>

  <p>"It was one of the best planned things I ever knew," he said. "I don't
  believe I could have proved anything. It would have looked just like an
  accident."</p>

  <p>"You mean," she said, "that it wouldn't have been."</p>

  <p>"As I said before, I don't want to say much about that now, but . . . Look
  here, you are the sort of person who likes to think about things. I'll just
  ask you to take two things and think about them, and then you can get used to
  the idea in your own way.</p>

  <p>"The first thing is this. I am a Moderate, as I told you; I really am
  against all the Extremists. But when journalists and jolly fellows in clubs
  say that, they generally forget that there really are different sorts of
  Extremists. In practice they think only of revolutionary Extremists. Believe
  me, the reactionary Extremists are quite as likely to go to extremes. The
  history of faction fights will show acts of violence by Patricians as well as
  Plebeians, by Ghibellines as well as Guelphs, by Orangemen as well as
  Fenians, by Fascists as well as Bolshevists, by the Ku-Klux-Klan as well as
  the Black Hand. And when a politician comes from London with a compromise in
  his pocket&mdash;it is not only Nationalists who see their plans
  frustrated.</p>

  <p>"The other point is more personal, especially to you. You once told me you
  feared for the family sanity, merely because you had bad dreams and brooded
  over things of your own imagination. Believe me, it's not the imaginative
  people who become insane. It's not they who are mad, even when they are
  morbid. They can always be woken up from bad dreams by broader prospects and
  brighter visions&mdash;because they are imaginative. The men who go mad are
  unimaginative. The stubborn stoical men who had only room for one idea and
  take it literally. The sort of man who seems to be silent but stuffed to
  bursting, congested&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I know," she said hastily; "you needn't say it, because I believe I
  understand everything now. Let me tell you two things also; they are shorter;
  but they have to do with it. My uncle sent me here with an officer who has an
  order for your release . . . and the Deputy-Governor is going home . . .
  resignation on the grounds of ill-health."</p>

  <p>"Tallboys is no fool," said John Hume; "he has guessed."</p>

  <p>She laughed with a little air of embarrassment.</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid he has guessed a good many things," she said.</p>

  <p>What the other things were is no necessary part of this story, but Hume
  proceeded to talk about them at considerable length during the rest of the
  interview, until the lady herself was moved to a somewhat belated protest.
  She said she did not believe that he could really be a Moderate after
  all.</p>

  <h2><a name="c021"
     id="c021">I</a>. &mdash; THE PROLOGUE OF THE TREE</h2>

<p class="first">Mr. Walter Windrush, the eminent and eccentric painter and
poet, lived in
  London and had a curious tree in his back garden. This alone would not have
  provoked the preposterous events narrated here. Many persons, without the
  excuse of being poets, have planted peculiar vegetables in their back
  gardens. The two curious facts about this curiosity were, first that he
  thought it quite remarkable enough to bring crowds from the ends of the earth
  to look at it, and, second, that if or when the crowds did come to look at
  it, he would not let them look.</p>

  <p>To begin with, he had not planted it at all. Oddly enough, it looked very
  much as if he had tried to plant it and failed; or possibly tried to pull it
  up again, and failed again. Cold classical critics said they could understand
  the pulling up better than the putting in. For it was a grotesque object; a
  nondescript thing looking stunted or pollarded in the manner recalling
  Burnham Beeches, but not easily classifiable as vegetation. It was so squat
  in the trunk that the boughs seemed to spring out of the roots and the roots
  out of the boughs. The roots also rose clear of the ground, so that light
  showed through them as through branches, the earth being washed away by a
  natural spring just behind. But the girth of the whole was very large, and
  the thing looked rather like a polyp or cuttle-fish radiating in all
  directions. Sometimes it looked as if some huge hand out of heaven, like the
  giant in Jack and the Beanstalk, had tried to haul the tree out of the earth
  by the hair of its head.</p>

  <p>Nobody indeed had ever planted this particular garden tree. It had grown
  like grass; and even like the wild grass of the wildest prairies. It was, in
  all probability, by far the oldest thing in those parts: there was nothing to
  prove it was not older than Stonehenge. It had never been planted in
  anybody's garden. Everything else had been planted round it. The garden and
  the garden wall and the house had been planted round it. The street had been
  planted round it; the suburb had been planted round it. London, in a manner
  of speaking, had been planted round it. For though the suburb in question was
  now sunk so deep in the metropolis that nobody ever thought of it as anything
  but metropolitan, it belonged to a district where the urban expansion had
  been relatively recent and rapid, and it was not really so very long ago that
  the strange tree had stood alone on a windy and pathless heath.</p>

  <p>The circumstances of its ultimate preservation or captivity were as
  follows. Nearly half a lifetime before, it happened that Windrush, who was
  then an art student, was crossing the open common with two companions, one a
  student of his own age, but attached to the medical and not the artistic
  section of his own college, the other a somewhat older friend, a businessman
  whom the young men wished to consult upon a matter of business. They proposed
  to discuss their business (which was not unconnected with the general
  incapacity of young students to be businesslike) at the inn of the Three
  Peacocks on the edge of the common; and the elder man especially showed some
  impatience to reach its shelter, as the wind was rising and dusk was falling
  over that rather desolate landscape.</p>

  <p>It was at this point that their progress was delayed by the highly
  exasperating conduct of Walter Windrush. He was moving as rapidly as the
  rest, when the strange outline of the tree seemed to bring him up all
  standing. He even raised his hands, not only in a pantomime of amazement
  unusual in the men of his race, but in gestures that might have been taken
  for some sort of pagan worship. He spoke in a hushed voice, and pointed, as
  if drawing their attention to a funeral or some occasion of awe. His
  scientific friend admitted that the way in which the tree straddled out of
  the earth was something of a botanical curiosity, but he did not need to be
  very scientific to discover the cause in the brook or fountain, that broke
  from the upper ground behind it and had forced its way through the crannies
  of the roots. He had the curiosity to hop up on one of the high roots and
  hoist himself up by one of the low branches, and then, remarking that the
  tree seemed to be half hollow, turned as if to resume his march. The
  commercial gentleman had already been waiting with some impatience to do so.
  But Walter Windrush could not be awakened from his trance of admiration. He
  continued to walk round and round the tree, to stare down into the straggling
  pools of water and then up to the wide cup or nest formed by the crown of
  boughs.</p>

  <p>"At first," he said at last, "I did not know what had happened to me. Now
  I understand."</p>

  <p>"Can't say I do," said his friend shortly, "unless it's going dotty. How
  long are you going to hang about here?"</p>

  <p>Windrush did not answer immediately; then he said:</p>

  <p>"Don't you know that all poets and painters and people like me are
  naturally Communists? And don't you know that, for the same reason, we're all
  naturally vagabonds?"</p>

  <p>"I confess," said their business adviser rather grimly, "that some of your
  recent financial antics might appeal to the Communists. But as for vagabonds,
  I imagine that vagabonds at least have the virtue of getting a move on."</p>

  <p>"You don't understand me," said Windrush with a strange sort of dreamy
  patience; "I mean that I'm not a Communist now. I'm not a vagabond any
  more."</p>

  <p>There was a staring silence and then he said in the same tone:</p>

  <p>"I never before in all my life saw anything that I wanted to possess."</p>

  <p>"Do you really mean," expostulated the other, "that you would like to
  possess this one rotten old tree?"</p>

  <p>Windrush went on as if the other had not spoken. "I have never before
  seen, in all my wanderings, any place where I wanted to stop and make my
  home. There cannot be anywhere in the world anything like that fantasia of
  earth and sky and water; built upon bridges like Venice, and letting daylight
  peer through its caverns like hell in Milton's poem; cloven as if by Alph the
  subterranean river and rising stark and clear of the clinging earth like the
  dead at the trump of doom. I have never seen anything like it. I do not
  really want to see anything else."</p>

  <p>There was perhaps some excuse for his freak of imagination, in the
  momentary conditions that added mystery to the freak of nature. The stormy
  sky above the heath had changed from grey to purple, and from that to a sort
  of sombre Indian red which only brightened at the horizon in a single scarlet
  strip of sunset. Against this background the black and bizarre outline of the
  tree had really the appearance of something more mystical than a natural
  object; as if a tree were trying to walk or a monster from the waters rising
  in a wild effort to fly. But even if Windrush's companions had been more
  sympathetic with such moods than they were, they would hardly have been
  prepared for the finality with which he flung himself down on a clump of turf
  beside the brook and took out a pipe and tobacco pouch, rather as if he had
  just sat down in an arm-chair at the club.</p>

  <p>"May I ask what you are doing?" asked his friend.</p>

  <p>"I am acquiring squatter's rights," said the other.</p>

  <p>They both besieged him with remonstrances, and it became more and more
  apparent to the others that he was perfectly serious, even if he was not
  perfectly sane. The businessman indicated to him in a brisk manner that, if
  he was really and truly interested in this absurd scrap of wilderness, he
  would be wiser to consult the agents of the estate of which it formed a part,
  as he would not get any "squatter's rights" in half a century. To the extreme
  astonishment of the adviser, the poet thanked him quite gravely for the
  advice and took out a piece of paper to note down the agent's name and
  address.</p>

  <p>"Meanwhile," said the commercial gentleman with great decision, "as this
  does not seem to me at all an agreeable place to squat in, you will have to
  come and squat in the Three Peacocks if you want to do any further business
  with me."</p>

  <p>"Don't be a fool, Windrush," said his other companion sharply, "you can't
  really want to be left here all night."</p>

  <p>"That happens to be exactly what I do want," replied Windrush. "I have
  seen the sun sink in my own private pool, and I want to see the moon rise out
  of it. You can't blame a prospective purchaser for testing the property under
  all conditions."</p>

  <p>The business friend had already turned away, and his dark, sturdy figure,
  expressing scorn in the very line of its back, had disappeared behind the
  sprawling tree. The other man lingered a moment longer, but in the face of
  the irrational rationality of the last remark, he also followed in the same
  path. He had gone about six yards and was also turning round by the tree,
  when the poet's whole manner suddenly altered. He threw down his pipe with an
  apologetic word and pursued his friends with an entirely new style and
  gesture, bowing with sweeping motions of courtesy.</p>

  <p>"I beg your pardon," he said magnificently; "I do hope you will come down
  to my little place again. I fear I have failed in hospitality."</p>

  <p>After he had himself lingered a moment or two by the tree and then resumed
  his seat on the bank, he sat gazing in a fascinated manner at the pools
  before him which, in the last intensity of sunset, gleamed like lakes of
  blood. He actually remained thus for many hours, seeing the red pools turn
  black with night and white with moonlight; as if he were indeed some Hindoo
  hermit who had gone into a stony ecstasy. But when he first moved on the
  following morning, he seemed filled with a far more novel and surprising
  practicality. He betook himself to the agents of the estate; he explained and
  negotiated for several months, and at length became the actual legal
  possessor of about two acres of ground surrounding his favourite freak of
  vegetation, and proceeded to fence it in with the most mathematical rigidity,
  like a settler staking out a claim in a desert. The rest of his extraordinary
  enterprise was all the more extraordinary for being comparatively ordinary.
  He built a small house on the land; he betook himself to habits of literary
  industry and respectability which soon enabled him to turn it into a very
  presentable country dwelling. In due course he even completed his social
  solidification by marrying a wife, who died after presenting him with one
  child, a daughter. The daughter grew up happily enough in these rustic but
  not rude conditions, and the life of Mr. Walter Windrush continued in
  sufficient serenity, until the coming of the great tragedy of his later
  life.</p>

  <p>The name of that tragedy was London. The endless expansion of the city
  came crawling over those hills and commons like a rising sea, and the rest of
  his history, or of that part of his history, was entirely concerned with his
  moods of defiance and measures of defence in the face of so incongruous a
  deluge. He swore by all the Muses that if this loathsome labyrinth of
  ugliness and vulgarity must indeed surround his sacred tree and his secret
  garden, at least it should not touch them. He erected a ridiculously high
  wall all round the spot; he observed the utmost ceremony about admitting
  anyone into it, and indeed, towards the end, the ceremony rather hardened
  into suspicion. Some unwary guests had treated the garden as if it were a
  garden; nay, even the tree as if it were a tree. And as it was his boast that
  this his hermitage was the last free space of the earth left in England, and
  the refuge of a poetry everywhere else conquered by prose, he fell latterly
  into a habit of locking the door into the garden and putting the key in his
  pocket. In every other aspect of life he was quite hospitable and humane; he
  gave his daughter a very good time in every other direction, but he tended
  more and more to treating this place as sacred to his own solitude, and
  through long days and nights nothing ever stirred in that strange enclosure
  but its lonely master walking round and round his tree.</p><hr><br>

  <h2><a name="c022"
     id="c022">II</a>. &mdash; THE MAN WITH THE BLACK BAG</h2>

<p class="first">Enid Windrush, a very good-looking young woman with a
brilliant shock of
  light hair and a profile of the eager and sanguine sort, had fallen behind
  her companion in the walk up the steep street and stopped to make a small
  purchase at a small confectioner's shop. In front of her the road rose in an
  abrupt white curve across a hill and the open spaces of a suburban park. The
  small white rim of what was obviously a colossal white cloud barely showed
  above the ridge, producing one of those rare effects that almost persuade the
  natural man, in spite of all the proofs adduced for it, that the world is
  round. Against that background of blue sky, white road and white rim of
  cloud, only two human figures happened at that moment to appear. They
  appeared to be totally disconnected and indeed were in every possible point
  dissimilar. And yet, a moment afterwards, she stared and started hastily
  forward. For she saw enacted, on that high place in the broad sunlight, what
  seemed to be one of the most inexplicable cases of assault and battery in all
  the annals of crime.</p>

  <p>One of the men in question was tall and bearded, with rather long hair
  under a wide hat; he wore loose clothes and was walking with loose strides in
  the sunny centre of the thoroughfare. Just before he crested the ridge he
  turned and looked idly backwards down the road he had climbed. The other man
  was moving decorously along the pavement and appeared to be in every way a
  more decorous and even duller sort of person. He wore a top-hat and his
  compact but not conspicuous figure was clad neatly in dark clothes; he was
  walking briskly and rapidly, but very quietly, and he carried a small black
  bag. He might have been a City clerk who prided himself on being punctual,
  but feared he was a little late. Anyhow, he seemed to look straight in front
  of him and to take no interest in anything but his goal.</p>

  <p>Quite suddenly he turned at right angles from the pavement, hurled
  himself, bag and all, into the middle of the road and appeared to pin or
  throttle the gentleman with the beard and the large hat. He was the shorter
  man of the two, but his spring was like a black cat's and he had all the
  advantage of youthful energy and the surprise. The tall man went staggering
  backwards towards the opposite pavement, but the next moment he had broken
  away from his mysterious enemy and started hitting back at him with
  refreshing vigour. At this moment a car coming from over the hill obscured
  for a moment the girl's view of the conflict, and when the space was clear
  again, it underwent yet a third change. The man in black, whose top-hat was
  now stuck somewhat askew on his head, but who still feverishly clasped his
  bag, appeared to be trying to break contact, in the military phrase, and to
  be disinclined to continue what he had so wantonly begun. He retreated
  slightly, waving hand and bag in what not even a girl, at such a distance,
  could mistake for motions of pugilism; they appeared to be rather motions of
  expostulation. As, however, the tall man, now hatless and with hair and beard
  flying, seemed bent on pursuing his vengeance, the other suddenly hurled away
  his bag, tucked up his neat cuff's and proceeded to slog into the other in an
  entirely new, vigorous and scientific manner. All this had taken less than
  half a minute to happen, but by this time the girl was running up the street
  as fast as she could, leaving a staring confectioner with a small brown-paper
  parcel dangling from his finger. For, as it happened, Miss Enid Windrush took
  a certain interest in the tall man with the long beard, an interest which
  many will rightly rebuke as antiquated and superstitious, but from which she
  had never been able entirely to emancipate herself. He was her father.</p>

  <p>By the time she arrived on the scene, or possibly because she had arrived
  on the scene, the violence of the pantomime had somewhat abated, but both
  sides were still panting and snorting with the passions of war. The wearer of
  the top-hat, on closer inspection, revealed himself as a young man with dark
  hair, whose square face and square shoulders had a touch of the Napoleonic;
  for the rest he looked quite respectable and rather reticent than otherwise,
  and there was certainly nothing about him to explain his antic of attack.</p>

  <p>Nor indeed did he appear to think that the explanation was required from
  him.</p>

  <p>"Well!" he said, breathing hard, "of all the blasted old fools! . . . Of
  all the damned doddering old donkeys. . . ."</p>

  <p>"This man," declared Windrush with fiery hauteur, "criminally assaulted me
  in the middle of the road for no reason whatever and&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"That's what he says!" cried the young man in a sort of triumphant
  derision. "For no reason whatever! And in the middle of the road! Oh, my
  green-eyed grandmother!"</p>

  <p>"Well, what reason?" began Miss Windrush, making an attempt to
  intervene.</p>

  <p>"Why, because he was in the middle of the road, of course!" exploded the
  young man. "He'd have been in the middle of Kensal Green Cemetery pretty
  soon. And, speaking generally, I should say he ought to be in the middle of
  Hanwell Asylum now. He must have escaped from there, I should think, to go
  stravaging up the middle of a modern road like that, and turning his back to
  admire the landscape, as if he were alone in the Sahara. Why, every
  reasonably modern village idiot knows that the motorists can't see what's on
  the other side of this hill when they come over it, and if I hadn't happened
  to hear the car&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"The car!" said the artist with a grave and severe astonishment, as one
  who convicts a child of romancing. "What car?" He turned round in a lordly
  manner and surveyed the street. "Where is this car?" he said
  sarcastically.</p>

  <p>"By the rate it was going at, I should say it was about seven miles away,"
  said the other.</p>

  <p>"Why, of course it's quite true," said Enid, as a light broke upon her.
  "There was a car that came very fast over the hill, just as you&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Just as I committed my criminal assault," said the young man in the
  top-hat.</p>

  <p>Walter Windrush was a gentleman and, what is by no means always the same
  thing, a man who valued a reputation for handsome behaviour. But he would
  have been more than human, if he had found it easy to adjust rapidly his
  relations to a gentleman, who had first flung him across the road and then,
  on his retaliating, started pommelling him like a pugilist, and to behold
  instantly in the same being, and veiled in the same face and form, a beloved
  friend and saviour to whom he must now dedicate his whole life in gratitude.
  His acknowledgements were a little dazed and halting, but his daughter was in
  a position to be more magnanimous and hearty. Upon rational reconsideration,
  she rather liked the look of the young man, for neatness and respectability
  do not always displease ladies who have seen a good deal of the sublime
  liberty of the artistic life. Also, she had not been seized suddenly by the
  throat in the middle of the road.</p>

  <p>Cards and courtesies began to be exchanged; the young man learned with
  surprise that he had insulted or rescued a distinguished man of letters; and
  the other learned that his insulter or rescuer was a young doctor, whose
  brass plate they had seen somewhere in the neighbourhood, inscribed with the
  name of John Judson.</p>

  <p>"Oh, if you're a doctor," said the poet, joking in a rather jerky fashion,
  "I'm sure you've been guilty of grossly unprofessional conduct. You ought to
  be reported to the Medical Council for taking the bread out of my doctor's
  mouth. I thought you medical men only stopped to count the accidents in the
  street and put them down on the credit side of the ledger. Why, if I had been
  half killed with the car, you could have finished me off with an
  operation."</p>

  <p>It seemed destined, from the first, that these two somewhat controversial
  characters should always say the wrong thing to each other. The young doctor
  smiled grimly, but there was a gleam of battle in his eye as he answered:</p>

  <p>"Oh, I think we generally try to save anybody, in the street or the gutter
  or anywhere. Of course I didn't know I was saving a poet; I thought I was
  only saving an ordinary useful citizen."</p>

  <p>It must be admitted with regret that this was a sample of the common
  conversations between the two. And, curiously enough, those conversations
  became rather common. To all appearance, they met only to argue, and yet they
  were always meeting. For some reason or other, Dr. Judson was continually
  coming round to the poet's house on one pretext or another, and the poet
  never failed in hospitality, though it had so strange a ring of hostility. It
  may be explained in part by the fact that each had met for the first time his
  complete antithesis and his completely convinced antagonist. Windrush was a
  man in the old tradition of Shelley or Walt Whitman. He was a poet to whom
  poetry seemed almost synonymous with liberty. If he had enclosed a wild tree
  in a tame suburban garden, it was by his account that it might be the last
  thing really allowed to grow wild. If he walked in a solitary path secluded
  by high walls, it was apparently by the instinct that has led many a squire
  to fence in a wilderness and call it a park. He liked loneliness because it
  was the only perfect form of doing as he liked. He regarded all the
  mechanical civilization that had spread around him as a mere materialistic
  slavery, and, as far as possible, treated it as if it were not there; even,
  as we have seen, to the extent of standing in the middle of a main road with
  his back to a motor-car.</p>

  <p>Dr. Judson was the sort of man of whom his more foolish friends say that
  he will get on, because he believes in himself. This was probably a slander
  on him. He did not merely believe in himself; he believed in things requiring
  far more faith; in things which some think far more incredible and difficult
  to believe. He believed in modern organization and machinery and the division
  of labour and the authority of the specialist. Above all, he believed in his
  job; in his art and science and profession. He was one of an advanced school,
  propounding many daring theories, especially in the department of psychology
  and psycho-analysis. Enid Windrush began to notice his name appended to
  letters in the ordinary papers, and then to articles in the scientific
  papers. He had the simplicity to carry his highly modern monomanias into
  private life, and propounded them to her for hours at a time, striding up and
  down the artistic drawing-room, while Windrush was wandering round his
  private garden engaged in perennial tree-worship. The walking up and down was
  characteristic, for the second definite impression which Judson produced,
  after the impression of professional primness and dullness of attire, was the
  impression of a bubbling and even restless energy. Sometimes he had, with
  characteristic directness, broken out in remonstrance against the poet
  himself upon his own poetical eccentricity: the Tree, which the poet always
  talked of as the type of radiating energy in the universe.</p>

  <p>"But what's the <i>good</i> of it?" Judson would cry out of the depths of
  dark exasperation. "What's the <i>use</i> of having a thing like that?"</p>

  <p>"Why, no use whatever," replied his host. "I suppose it is quite useless
  as you understand use. But even if art and poetry have no use, it does not
  follow that they have no value."</p>

  <p>"But look here," the doctor would start in again, scowling painfully. "I
  don't see the value of it as art and poetry&mdash;let alone reason or sense.
  What's the beauty of one dingy old tree stuck in the middle of bricks and
  mortar? Why, if you abolished it, you'd have room for a garage and you could
  go and see all the woods and forests in England&mdash;every blessed tree
  between Cornwall and Caithness."</p>

  <p>"Yes," retorted Windrush, "and wherever I went, I should see petrol-pumps
  instead of trees. That is the logical end of your great progress of science
  and reason&mdash;and a damned illogical end to a damned unreasonable
  progress. Every spot of England is to be covered with petrol stations, so
  that people can travel about and see more petrol stations."</p>

  <p>"It's only a question of knowing their way about when they travel about,"
  insisted the doctor. "People born in the motoring age have got a new
  motor-sense, and they don't mind these things so much as you think. I suppose
  that's the real difference between the generations."</p>

  <p>"All right," said the elder gentleman tartly. "Let us say you have all the
  motor-sense, and we have all the horse-sense."</p>

  <p>"Well," said the other, also with a sharpened accent. "If you'd had a
  little more motor-sense, or any sort of sense, you wouldn't have been so
  bally near killed the other day."</p>

  <p>"If there were no motors at all," answered the poet calmly, "there would
  have been nothing to kill me."</p>

  <p>And then Dr. Judson would lose his temper and say the poet was cracked,
  and then he would apologize to the poet's daughter and say that of course the
  poet was a gentleman of the old school and had a right to be rather
  old-fashioned. But she, he would assert, with more earnest appeal, ought to
  have more sympathy with the future and the new hopes of the world. Then he
  would leave the house boiling with protests and arguing with invisible
  persons all the way home. For he really was a man profoundly convinced of the
  prospects and prophesies of science. He had a great many theories of his own,
  which he was only too anxious to throw out to the world in general. He was
  accused by his more playful friends of inventing diseases that nobody had
  ever experienced, in order to cure them by discoveries that nobody could ever
  explain. Superficially, he was indeed one with all the faults of a man of
  action, including the temptation of ambition. But for all that, there was a
  dark but busy cell in his inmost brain, where thought for thought's sake went
  on in an almost dangerous degree of turmoil and intensity. Anyone who could
  have looked into that dim whirlpool might have guessed that there could arise
  out of it, in some strange hour of stress, a thing like a monster.</p>

  <p>Enid Windrush was a sufficient contrast to this intellectualism and
  secrecy, and seemed always walking in the sunlight. She was healthy, hearty
  and athletic, and in her tastes she might have been the shining incarnation
  of her father's frustrated love of the open country and the tall trees. She
  was more conscious of her body than her soul, and expressed in the suburban
  substitutes of tennis and golf and the swimming-bath, what might have been a
  native love of country sports. And yet it may be that in her also there was,
  at odd moments, a touch of her father's more transcendental fancy. Anyhow, it
  is true that long afterwards, when this story was ended, she stood again in
  the sunlight and looked back at those earlier days through a storm of black
  and brain-racking mysteries, and of horror truly piled upon horror. And
  looking back at this beginning of her story, she wondered if there were
  something in the old notion of omens and prefiguring signs. She wondered
  whether the whole of her riddle would not have been clear to her, from first
  to last, if she could have read it in those two dark figures dancing and
  fighting on the sunlit road against the white cloud; like two living letters
  of an alphabet struggling to spell out a word.</p><hr><br>

  <h2><a name="c023"
     id="c023">III</a>. &mdash; THE TRESPASSER IN THE GARDEN</h2>

<p class="first">For various causes, which accumulated in his dark and
brooding brain for
  the next day or two, Dr. Judson eventually summoned up all his courage and
  decided to go and consult Doone.</p>

  <p>That he referred to him in his mind in this fashion indicated no
  familiarity, but rather the reverse of familiarity. The person in question
  had, of course, passed at some period through the more or less human phases
  of being Mr. Doone and Dr. Doone and then Professor Doone, before he rose
  into the higher magnificence of being Doone. Men said Doone just as men said
  Darwin. It soon became something of an affectation, if not an affront, to say
  Professor Darwin or Mr. Charles Darwin. And it was now fully twenty years
  since Professor Doone had published the great work on the parallel diseases
  of anthropoids and men, which had made him the most famous scientific man in
  England, and one of the four or five most famous in Europe. But Judson had
  been one of his pupils when he was still practising medicine at the head of a
  great hospital. And Judson fancied that the fact might give him a slight
  advantage in one of those incessant arguments of his, in which the name of
  Doone had cropped up in a disputed point. To explain how it had cropped up,
  and how it had come to seem so important, it is necessary to return once more
  (after the habit of Dr. Judson) to the house of the poet Windrush.</p>

  <p>When last Dr. Judson had paid a call there, he had found the one thing in
  the world calculated to annoy him more than he was already annoyed. He had,
  in fact, found another young man installed in the family circle, and learned
  that he was a next-door neighbour who very frequently dropped in for a chat.
  It may already have been darkly hinted that, whatever were the real sins or
  virtues of Dr. Judson (and he was full of many rather deep and unexplored
  possibilities) he did not possess a very good temper. He chose, for some
  mysterious reason or other, to take a dislike to the other young man. He did
  not like the way in which two wisps of his long, fair hair lay on his cheek
  in a suggestion of incipient side whiskers; he did not like the way in which
  he smiled politely while other people were talking. He did not like the way
  he talked himself, in a large and indifferent manner, about art, science or
  sport as if all subjects were equally important or unimportant; or the way in
  which he apologized alternately to the poet and the doctor for doing so.
  Lastly, the doctor faintly disapproved of the fact that the visitor was about
  two and a half inches taller than himself, and also of the (infernally
  affected) stoop with which he almost redressed the difference. If the doctor
  had known as much about his own psychology as he did about everybody else's,
  he might have understood the symptoms better. There is normally only one
  condition in which a man dislikes another man for all that is repulsive and
  all that is attractive about him.</p>

  <p>The name of the gentleman from next door appeared to be Wilmot, and there
  was nothing to indicate that he had anything to do in the world except
  collect impressions of a cultivated sort. He was interested in poetry, which
  might serve to explain his having found favour with the poet. Unfortunately,
  he was also interested in science; and this did not by any means find favour
  with the scientific man. There is nothing that exasperates a passionate
  specialist and believer in specialism so much as somebody graciously
  informing him of the elements of his own subject, especially when (as
  sometimes happens) they are the elements which the specialist himself started
  to explode and abolish ten years before. The doctor's protest was vehement to
  the verge of rudeness, and he declared that certain notions about Arboreal
  Man had been exposed as nonsense when Doone first began to write. It need
  hardly be said that Doone, being a great man of science, was almost
  universally praised in the newspapers for saying something very like the
  opposite of what he actually said in his books and lectures. Judson had
  attended the lectures; Judson had read the books; but Wilmot had read the
  newspapers. This naturally gave Wilmot a great advantage in discussion before
  any modern cultivated audience.</p>

  <p>The debate had arisen out of a chance boast of the poet touching his early
  experiments as a painter. He showed them some old rhythmic designs of a
  decorative sort; and said he had often practised drawing with both hands
  simultaneously; and had sometimes begun to detect the beginnings of a
  difference or independence in the action of the two hands.</p>

  <p>"So you might end up, I suppose," said Wilmot smiling, "by drawing a
  caricature of your publisher with one hand while you worked out the details
  of a piece of town-planning with the other."</p>

  <p>"A new version," said Judson rather grimly, "of not letting your left hand
  know what your right hand doeth. If you ask me, I should say it was a damned
  dangerous trick."</p>

  <p>"I should have thought," said the strange gentleman languidly, "that your
  friend Doone would have approved of a man using two hands, since his sacred
  ancestor the monkey actually uses four."</p>

  <p>Judson sprang up in his explosive way. "Doone deals with the brains of men
  and monkeys, and uses his own like a man," he said. "I can't help it if some
  men prefer to use theirs like monkeys."</p>

  <p>When he had gone, Windrush appeared not a little annoyed with such abrupt
  manners, though Wilmot was entirely serene.</p>

  <p>"That young man is becoming insufferable," said the artist. "He turns
  every talk into an argument and every argument into a quarrel. What the devil
  does it matter to anybody what Doone really said?"</p>

  <p>To the scowling Dr. Judson, however, it did evidently matter very much
  what Doone really said. It mattered so much that the doctor (as already
  indicated) took the trouble to cross the town in order to hear Doone really
  say it. Perhaps there was something like a touch of morbidity in his
  concentration in proving himself right on such a point, and certainly he was
  the sort of man who cannot bear to leave an argument unanswered; perhaps he
  had other motives or reasons mixed up in his mind. Anyhow, he went off
  stormily in the direction of that scientific shrine or tribunal, leaving
  Windrush angry, Wilmot supercilious and Enid puzzled and pained.</p>

  <p>The great West End mansion of Dr. Doone, with its classic and pillared
  portico and rather funereal blinds, did not daunt the younger doctor as he
  ran resolutely up the steps and rang vigorously at the bell. He was shown
  into the great man's study and after a few sentences succeeded in recalling
  himself and receiving a mildly benevolent recognition. The great Dr. Doone
  was a very handsome old gentleman with curly white hair and a hooked nose,
  and did not look much older than the numerous portraits that appeared in
  bookish weeklies illustrating the conflict of Religion and Science. It did
  not take Judson long to verify the accuracy of his version of the original
  Doone Theory. But all the time they were talking, the dark and restless eyes
  of the young doctor were darting about the room, probing every corner, in
  endless professional curiosity about the progress of science. He saw the
  stacks of new books and magazines lying on the table as they had arrived by
  post; he even automatically turned over the pages of a few of them, while his
  eye would wander and run along the serried ranks of the bookcases, and Doone
  went on talking, as old men will, of old friends and of old enemies.</p>

  <p>"It was that egregious Grossmark," he was saying with reawakening
  animation, "who made the same absurd muddle of my meaning. Do you remember
  Grossmark? Of all the extraordinary examples of what concerted boosting can
  do&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Rather like the way Cubbitt is being boosted now," said Judson.</p>

  <p>"I dare say," said Doone rather irritably. "But Grossmark really made a
  spectacle of himself on the Arboreal question. He did not answer a single one
  of my points, except with that absurd quibble about the word Eocene. Branders
  was better; Branders had made some real contribution in his time, though he
  could not quite see that his time was past. But Grossmark&mdash;well,
  really!"</p>

  <p>And Dr. Doone settled himself back in his arm-chair and laughed
  genially.</p>

  <p>"Well," said Judson, "I am much obliged to you. I knew I should learn a
  great deal if I came here."</p>

  <p>"Not at all," said the great man, rising and shaking hands. "You say you
  have been discussing it with Windrush, the landscape painter, I think. I met
  him years ago, but he would hardly remember me. An able man; but eccentric,
  very eccentric."</p>

  <p>Dr. John Judson came away from the house with a very thoughtful expression
  and seemed to be revolving rather more than might have appeared to have
  passed at the interview. He had no very clear intention of going back in
  triumph to the Windrush abode, armed with the thunderbolts of Doone, but he
  had a general and half-conscious tendency to drift in that direction in any
  case. And before his own intentions were clear, he found himself in front of
  the house and saw something which brought him to a standstill, staring up at
  it with a sort of stolid suspicion. For some instants he stood quite
  motionless, then crossed the road with catlike swiftness and peered round the
  corner of the house.</p>

  <p>Night had fallen and a large moon painted everything with pale colours.
  The house or bungalow that the landscape-painter had originally built in an
  open landscape was now wedged in a row of villas, though it retained
  something of a quaint or uncouth outline of its own. It almost seemed to be,
  rather awkwardly, turning its back upon the street. Perhaps this hint of
  secrecy was only suggested by its own absurd secret, for just behind it could
  be seen the high spiked walls of the garden like the castellated walls of
  some pantomime prison. Only one crack gave a green glimpse of the enclosed
  shrubbery, where, on one side of the house, was a high narrow gate of a
  lattice pattern, which was always kept locked; but through the loopholes the
  stranger in the street could just see the glimmer of moonlight on the leaves.
  But the stranger in the street (if Dr. Judson may be so described) could at
  this moment see something else, and something that surprised him very
  much.</p>

  <p>A long, slim figure, dark against the moonshine, was most unmistakably
  using this sort of lattice as a ladder. He was scaling it swiftly from
  inside, with long-legged sinuous movements that rather recalled the monkeys
  that had formed the topic of conversation. He seemed, however, to be an
  unusually tall monkey and when he came to the top rung of his
  ladder&mdash;towering as if he might tip over into the street&mdash;the wind
  of that high place took two long locks of his hair and waved them
  fantastically, as if he were a sort of demon with two horns which he could
  move like ears. But that last touch, in which some might find the culmination
  of the uncanny, the common sense of Dr. Judson found reality and recognition.
  He was well acquainted with those two exceedingly annoying wisps of hair. He
  had seen them flopping (as he would have illiberally expressed it) like two
  womanish whiskers on the countenance of the condescending Mr. Wilmot. And
  sure enough, the condescending Mr. Wilmot, alighting with a graceful leap,
  greeted him with no shade of gloom in his condescension.</p>

  <p>"What the devil are you doing there?" asked Judson angrily.</p>

  <p>"Why, it's the doctor!" said the other, with an air of pleased surprise.
  "Do I seem to be a case <i>de lunatico inquirendo</i>? I had forgotten that
  it must be quite a case for a psychologist."</p>

  <p>"It seems to me to be a case for a policeman," said Dr. Judson. "May I ask
  what you are doing in Windrush's garden, which he likes to keep locked
  up&mdash;and anyhow, why you should leave it in that fashion?"</p>

  <p>"I might very well ask why you should ask," replied the other pleasantly.
  "Unless I am curiously misinformed, you are not Mr. Walter Windrush any more
  than I am. But I assure you I don't want to quarrel, Dr. Judson."</p>

  <p>"You are taking a rum way to avoid it," said the doctor in a bellicose
  manner.</p>

  <p>The mysterious Mr. Wilmot drew near in a curious confidential manner that
  was quite new; his rather foolish airs and graces had fallen from him and he
  said, lowering his voice to a tone of great earnestness:</p>

  <p>"I can assure you, doctor, that I have excellent authority, the best
  possible authority, for being in Windrush's garden."</p>

  <p>And with that the mystic neighbour appeared to melt into the shadows,
  presumably eventually vanishing into his own house next door, and Dr. Judson
  turned abruptly and, walking up to the front door of the Windrush house,
  furiously rang the bell.</p>

  <p>Mr. Windrush was not at home. He had gone out to some grand banquet of
  artistic celebrities and would not be home till late. But the conduct of Dr.
  Judson was certainly rather odd and rude; so much so that the lady who
  received him had a momentary and horrible feeling that he might have been
  drinking, incongruous as this was with the hard hygienic routine of his
  existence. He sat down in the drawing-room, opposite Enid Windrush; he sat
  down suddenly and resolutely as if resolved to say something and then said
  nothing. He was as motionless as a dark image and yet he fumed; she could
  only think of the metaphor that he smouldered. She had never realized before
  how his broad, round head seemed to bulge at the temples and over the
  eyebrows; how his clean-shaven jaws and chin seemed to swell implacably and
  what a glow of dark emotions could look out of his eyes. And all the time he
  seemed doubly grotesque because his square, strong hands were clasped on the
  head of an umbrella, the emblem of his precise and prosaic life. She waited,
  rather as she would have sat watching a round, black bomb that was ticking
  and smoking in the parlour.</p>

  <p>At last he said in a harsh voice:</p>

  <p>"I wish I could see that tree your father's so fond of."</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid that's impossible," she said. "It's really the only point he
  is very particular about. He says he would like every other man to have a
  favourite tree&mdash;meaning a place of solitude for himself. But he says he
  won't lend anybody else his tree any more than his toothbrush."</p>

  <p>"This is all nonsense," said the doctor gruffly. "What would he do if I
  just jumped over a wall, or somehow went into his garden?"</p>

  <p>"I'm awfully sorry," she said in a wavering voice, "but if you came into
  his garden, you wouldn't ever come again into his house."</p>

  <p>Judson sprang to his feet and she felt somehow that the last click had
  sounded before the catch and the detonation.</p>

  <p>"And yet he allows Mr. Wilmot to go into his garden. The gentleman seems
  privileged in many ways."</p>

  <p>Enid sat staring at him for a few seconds without speech. "Allows Mr.
  Wilmot to go into his garden!" she repeated.</p>

  <p>"Thank God for that," said the doctor. "You don't seem to know anything
  about it, anyhow. Wilmot told me he had the very best authority, and I
  naturally thought of your authority or your father's authority. But, of
  course, it's just possible . . . . Here, wait a minute. . . . I'll let you
  know later. . . . Your father will forbid me the house! Will he?"</p>

  <p>And with that, this far from soothing medical practitioner bolted from the
  house as abruptly as he had come into it. It struck her that he must have a
  remarkable bedside manner.</p>

  <p>Enid dined alone, very thoughtfully revolving very complex and even
  contradictory criticisms of this extraordinary young man. Then her thoughts
  went off to her father and his very different sort of unconventionality, and
  something led her to make her way to his study and studio at the back of the
  house, jutting out into the garden. Here were the large scrawled canvases
  with the unfinished sketches about which the argument had raged the day
  before, and she looked at them uneasily, remembering the controversial
  extremes to which such things could give rise. She herself was of a
  straightforward and very sane type of intelligence; and could no more see
  anything to quarrel about in such things than she could see metaphysics in a
  wallpaper or morals in a Turkey carpet. But the atmosphere of debate
  disturbed her, partly because it disturbed her father; and she looked rather
  moodily out of the trench windows at the extreme end of the studio, into the
  gloom of the secluded garden.</p>

  <p>At first she was subconsciously puzzled that there should be anything like
  a breeze on that clear moonlit night. She gradually awoke to the realization
  that nothing was moving in the garden except the one thing in its centre; the
  uncouth and sprawling outline of the nameless tree. She had an instant of
  babyish bogy feeling in the notion that it could move of itself like an
  animal, or create its own wind like a giant fan. Then she saw that its shape
  was changed, as if a new branch had sprouted, and then saw that a human
  figure was swinging upon it. The figure swung and dropped in the manner of a
  monkey and then advanced towards the window in the recognizable outline of a
  man. As it did so, all lesser thoughts vanished, and she knew it was not her
  father and not Mr. Wilmot from next door. An increasing but incomprehensible
  terror took hold of her, as when the faces of friends change in a bad dream.
  John Judson came close up to the closed window and spoke, but she could not
  hear what he said. All nightmare was in that soundless moving mouth against
  that invisible film. It was as if he were dumb like a fish, floating up to a
  porthole, and his face was as pale as the underside of the deep-sea
  fishes.</p>

  <p>The windows giving on to the garden were locked, like all such exits, but
  she knew where her father kept the keys, and in a moment they were open. Her
  indignant greeting was stopped on her lips, for Judson cried, in a hoarse
  voice she had never heard from any human being:</p>

  <p>"Your father . . . he must be mad."</p>

  <p>He stopped and seemed startled at his own words. Then he put his hands to
  his bulging brows, as if clutching his short, dark hair, and after a silence
  said, but with a different emphasis: "He <i>must</i> be mad."</p>

  <p>Enid's instinct told her that he had said two quite different things, even
  in repeating the same words. But it was long before she came to understand
  the difference between those two exclamations, or what had happened between
  them.</p><hr><br>

  <h2><a name="c024"
     id="c024">IV</a>. &mdash; THE DISEASE OF DUODIAPSYCHOSIS</h2>

<p class="first">Enid Windrush was a human being; a very human being. She had
several
  shades and different degrees of indignation, only on the present occasion she
  had them all at once. She was angry because a visitor turned up at that time
  of night and entered by the window instead of the door; she was angry that a
  person for whom she had felt some regard should behave like a cat-burglar;
  she was angry that her father's wishes should be scornfully disregarded; she
  was angry at being frightened, and more angry at seeing no sense even in the
  occasion of the fright. But she was human, and was perhaps most angry of all
  at the fact that the intruder did not even answer or acknowledge any of her
  expressions of anger. He sat with his elbows on his knees and his hands
  clutching his bursting temples, and it was long before there came from him
  even the impatient reply: "Can't you see I'm thinking?"</p>

  <p>Then he jumped up in his energetic way and ran to one of the large,
  unfinished pictures and peered into it. Then, equally feverishly, he examined
  another and then another. Then he turned on her a face about as reassuring as
  a skull and cross-bones, and said:</p>

  <p>"I am greatly grieved to say it, Miss Windrush. In plain words, your
  father is suffering from Duodiapsychosis."</p>

  <p>"Is that your notion of plain words?" she asked.</p>

  <p>He added in a low, hoarse voice: "It began as an example of Arboreal
  Atavism."</p>

  <p>It is an error for the man of science to lapse into being intelligible.
  The last two words were sufficiently familiar, in an age of popular science,
  to cause the lady to leap up like a leaping flame.</p>

  <p>"Have you the impudence to suggest," she cried, "that my father ever
  wanted to live in a tree like a monkey?"</p>

  <p>"What other explanation is there?" he said gloomily. "This is a very
  painful business; but the hypothesis clearly covers the facts. Why should he
  wish always to be alone with the tree, unless his dealings with it were more
  grotesque than seemed suitable to his social dignity?&mdash;you know what
  this suburb is like! For that matter, his own horror of the suburb, his own
  quite exaggerated horror of towns, his quite feverish and fanatical yearning
  for woodlands and wild country&mdash;what can all this mean except the same
  Arboreal Atavism? For that matter, what else can explain the whole
  story&mdash;the story of how he found the tree and fixed on the tree? What
  was the nature of that ungovernable craving that first surged up in him at
  the very sight of the tree? An appetite as powerful as that must have come
  out of the depths of nature, out of the very roots of the evolutionary origin
  of man. It can only have been an anthropoid appetite. It is a melancholy but
  most convincing example of Doone's Law."</p>

  <p>"What is all this nonsense?" cried Enid. "Do you imagine my father had
  never seen a tree before?"</p>

  <p>"You must remember," replied the other in the same hollow and hopeless
  voice, "the peculiar features of the tree. It might have been designed to
  stimulate the faint memories of the original home of man. It is a tree that
  seems all branches, of which the very roots are like branches, and invite the
  climber with a hundred footholds. These primary promptings or fundamental
  instincts would have been plain enough in any case but unfortunately the case
  has since grown more complex. It has developed into a case of
  Semi-Quadrumanous Ambidexterity."</p>

  <p>"That's not what you said before," she said suspiciously.</p>

  <p>"I admit," he said, with a shudder, "that it is in a sense a discovery of
  my own."</p>

  <p>"And I suppose," she said, "you are so fond of your horrible discoveries
  that you would sacrifice anybody to them&mdash;my father or me."</p>

  <p>"Not sacrifice you. Save you," said Judson, and shuddered again. Then he
  mastered himself with an effort, and went on in the same maddening mechanical
  tone like that of a lecturer.</p>

  <p>"The anthropoid reaction carries with it an attempt to recover the use of
  all the limbs equally, in the monkey fashion. This leads to experiments in
  ambidexterity like those he himself admitted. He tried to draw and paint with
  both hands. At a later stage he would probably attempt also to paint with his
  feet."</p>

  <p>They stared across at each other; it measures the horror of that interview
  that neither of them laughed.</p>

  <p>"The result," went on the doctor, "the really dangerous result lies in a
  tendency to separation between the functions. Such ambidexterity is not
  natural to man in his existing evolutionary stage and may lead to a schism
  between the lobes of the brain. One part of the mind may become unconscious
  of what is attempted by the other part. Such a person is not responsible . .
  . and really should be under supervision."</p>

  <p>"I will not believe a word of all this," said the lady angrily.</p>

  <p>He lifted one finger and pointed in a sombre manner at the sombre canvases
  and frames of brown paper that hung above them, on which were traced in
  vortical lines and lurid colours the visions of the ambidextrous artist.</p>

  <p>"Look at those pictures," he said. "Look at them long enough and you will
  see exactly what I mean&mdash;and what they mean. The tree-motive is repeated
  again and again like a monomania; for a tree has a radiating and centrifugal
  pattern that suggests the waving of both hands at once, with a brush in each.
  But a tree is not a wheel&mdash;there would be less harm in a wheel. Though a
  tree has branches on each side, they are not the same on each side. And that
  is where the curse and the creeping peril begins."</p>

  <p>This time there was a deadly silence, which he himself broke by going on
  with the lecture.</p>

  <p>"The attempt to render the variation of branches by simultaneous
  ambidextrous action leads to a dissociation of cerebral unity and continuity,
  a breach of responsible moral control and co-ordinated consecutive
  conservation&mdash;"</p>

  <p>In the black storm of her mind she had a lightning blaze of intuition and
  said:</p>

  <p>"Is this a sort of revenge?"</p>

  <p>He stopped in the very middle of a polysyllable and turned pale to the
  lips.</p>

  <p>"Have you come to the end of your long words, you liar and quack and
  mountebank?" she cried in a tempest of indescribable fury. "Do you think I
  don't know why you're trying to make out my father isn't responsible? Because
  I told you he could turn you out of the house . . . because . . ."</p>

  <p>The pale lips seemed to move as if with a grin of agony: "And why should I
  mind that?"</p>

  <p>"Because," she began and then stopped dead. An abyss had opened in herself
  into which she did not look. For a moment he sat on the sofa stiff as a
  corpse and then suddenly the corpse came to life.</p>

  <p>"Yes!" he cried, leaping up. "You are right! It is you. It is you all the
  time! How can I leave you alone with him? You must believe me! I tell you the
  man is mad." He cried out suddenly in a new and ringing voice: "I swear to
  God I am afraid he will kill you! And how should I live after that?"</p>

  <p>She was so astounded at this burst of passion after all the pedantry, that
  for the first time something broke or wavered in her hard voice and she could
  only say: "If it is me you are thinking about, you must leave him alone."</p>

  <p>And with that a sort of stony detachment suddenly settled back upon him
  and he said, in a voice that seemed a hundred miles away: "You forget that I
  am a doctor. I have in any case a duty to the public."</p>

  <p>"And now I know you are a skunk and a scoundrel," she said. "They always
  have a duty to the public."</p>

  <p>And then, in the silence that followed, they both heard the sounds which
  could alone, perhaps, have aroused them from their dumb mutual defiance. A
  long, light and swinging step was heard down the corridors, and the light
  humming of some post-prandial song, told Enid with sufficient clearness who
  had returned, and the next moment Walter Windrush stood in the room, looking
  festive and rather magnificent in evening dress. He was a tall and handsome
  old gentleman, and before him the figure of the sullen doctor looked not only
  square but almost squat. But when the artist looked across his studio, he saw
  the windows open and the festivity faded from his face.</p>

  <p>"I have just walked through your garden," said the doctor in a soft
  voice.</p>

  <p>"Then you will kindly walk out of my house," said the artist.</p>

  <p>He had turned pale with anger or some other passion, but he spoke clearly
  and firmly. After a silence he said: "I must ask you to cease from any
  communications with me and my family."</p>

  <p>Judson started and stepped forward with a violent gesture which he checked
  as he made it. But his voice broke out of him like something beyond his
  control.</p>

  <p>"You say I am to go out of this house. I say it is you who shall go out of
  this house!"</p>

  <p>Then, as if grinding his teeth, he added with what seemed inconceivable
  intellectual cruelty: "I am going to have you certified as a lunatic."</p>

  <p>He walked furiously out of the room towards the front door, and Windrush
  turned to his daughter. She was staring at him with wide eyes, but her colour
  was such that he thought, for the fraction of an instant, that she was
  dead.</p>

  <p> </p>

  <p>Of the next frightful forty-eight hours in which the threat was carried
  out with all its consequences, Enid could never remember many details. But
  she remembered some nameless hour of night or morning that seemed but a part
  of a sleepless night, when she stood on the doorstep and looked wildly up and
  down the street, as if expecting her neighbours to rescue her from a house on
  fire. And there crept upon her the cold certainty, more cruel than any fire,
  that in this sort of calamity there was no hope from neighbours, nor any
  appeal against the machine of modern oppression. She saw a policeman standing
  near the next lamp-post, outside the next house. She thought of calling to
  the policeman, as if to save her from a burglar, and then she realized that
  she might as well call to the lamp-post. If two doctors chose to testify that
  Walter Windrush was mad, they turned the whole modern world with
  them&mdash;police and all. If they chose to testify that it was an emergency
  case, he could be taken away at once, under the eye of any policeman, and it
  seemed that he was being taken away at once. Nevertheless, there was
  something about the policeman planted at that particular spot, where she had
  never seen one before, that riveted her eye. And even as she gazed, the
  next-door neighbour, Mr. Wilmot, came out of his front door with a light
  suitcase in his hand.</p>

  <p>She felt a sudden impulse to consult him, perhaps it was an impulse to
  consult anybody. But he had always seemed to be a man of many types of
  information, including the scientific, and she impulsively ran across and
  asked for a moment's interview. Mr. Wilmot seemed a little hurried, which was
  far from being his usual demeanour, but he politely bowed her back into his
  front parlour. When she got there, a rather inexplicable shyness or evasion
  overcame her. She felt a new and irrational reluctance to give away somebody
  or something, she knew not what. Moreover, there was something unfamiliar
  about the familiar face and form of Mr. Wilmot. He was wearing horn
  spectacles, through which his glance seemed sharper and more alert than of
  old. His clothes were the same, but they were buttoned up more neatly and all
  his movements were more brisk. He still had the wisps that looked like
  whiskers but the face underneath had so altered in expression that one might
  almost fancy the whiskers were part of a wig.</p>

  <p>Dazed and doubtful in a new fashion, she felt impelled to put her point in
  a more impersonal way, and asked whether he could give any advice to a friend
  of hers, who had been warned of a disease called Duodiapsychosis. Could he
  tell her if there was such a disease, as she knew he knew a lot about those
  things?</p>

  <p>He admitted that he knew a little about those things. But he still seemed
  hurried&mdash;courteously but convincingly hurried. He looked it up in a work
  of reference, turning the pages very rapidly; no, he doubted whether there
  was any such thing.</p>

  <p>"It seems to me," he said, looking gravely at her through his spectacles,
  "that your friend may be the victim of a quack."</p>

  <p>With that repetition of her suspicions, she turned homewards and he rather
  eagerly followed her into the street. The policeman saluted him; there was
  nothing much in that; policemen saluted her father and other well-known
  residents. But she did think it odd that he said to the policeman, as he went
  off: "There's one thing more I must make sure of. Unless I wire, things can
  go forward here as arranged."</p>

  <p>When she came back to her own house, she knew it was something worse than
  a house of death. There was a black taxicab waiting outside it, which made
  her think of a funeral, almost with envy. If she had known who was already in
  the taxicab, she might have stopped and made a scene in the street. As it
  was, she burst into the house and found two grave, dark-clad doctors sitting
  in the light of the bow-window in front, with a table between them, covered
  with official documents and pen and ink. One of the doctors, who was just
  about to sign one of the documents, was a stately, silver-haired gentleman in
  a very elegant astrakhan overcoat; she gathered from the conversation that
  his name was Doone. The other doctor was the abominable John Judson.</p>

  <p>She had paused an instant just outside the room and heard the tail-end of
  their scientific talk.</p>

  <p>"You and I know, of course," Judson was saying, "how much the mere idea of
  subconsciousness, or horizontal division of the mind, has been superseded by
  vertical division of the mind. But the layman has hardly heard yet of the new
  double or ambidextrous consciousness."</p>

  <p>"Quite so," said Dr. Doone in a level and soothing voice.</p>

  <p>He had a very soothing voice, and with it he earnestly did his best to
  soothe Enid Windrush. He really seemed to be profoundly touched with the
  tragedy of her position.</p>

  <p>"I cannot expect you to believe how much I feel for your misfortunes," he
  said. "I can only say that anything that can soften the shock for anyone
  involved will be done. I will not disguise from you that your father is
  already in the cab outside, under the care of tactful and humane attendants.
  I will not disguise from you that some deception, such as has to be used to
  the sick, has been employed in prevailing upon him, but I told him no more
  than the truth in saying that he was going with his best friends. These
  things are very terrible, my child, but perhaps we may all draw nearer to
  each other in&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Oh, sign the thing and be done," said Dr. Judson rudely.</p>

  <p>"Be silent, sir," said Doone, with fine dignity and indignation. "If you
  have neither the manners nor the morals for dealing with people in
  misfortune, I, at least, have more experience. Miss Windrush, I am
  sorry."</p>

  <p>He held out his hand and Enid stood hesitating and then retreated like one
  distraught; so distraught that she actually turned to Dr. Judson.</p>

  <p>"Send that man away," she cried with the shrillness of hysteria. "Send him
  away! He is more horrible even than&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"More horrible than&mdash; " repeated Judson, waiting,</p>

  <p>She looked at him with a wild inscrutable stare and said:</p>

  <p>"More horrible than you."</p>

  <p>"Have you signed that damned thing yet?" said Judson, boiling with
  impatience. But, even as they had turned away from him, Doone had signed the
  paper and Judson snatched it up with furious haste and ran out of the
  house.</p>

  <p>And then she saw something that finally put him beyond pardon. For as he
  ran down the steps, he seemed to give a sort of bound of cheerfulness, like a
  boy on a holiday; like a man who has at last got what he wanted. She felt she
  could have forgiven him everything except that last little leap of joy.</p>

  <p>Some time after&mdash;she could not have said how long&mdash;she still sat
  staring out of the bow-window into the empty street. She had reached that
  state when the soul feels that nothing worse can happen in the world. But she
  was wrong. For it was only a few minutes later that two policemen and a man
  in plain clothes came up those steps and, after some apologies and
  uncomfortable explanations, announced that they had a warrant for the arrest
  of Walter Windrush on a charge of murder.</p><hr><br>

  <h2><a name="c025"
     id="c025">V</a>. &mdash; THE SECRET OF THE TREE</h2>

<p class="first">The motives of the simple are more subtle than those of the
subtle. The
  former do not sort out their own emotions and the result is often more
  mysterious, especially as they never afterwards attempt to solve the mystery.
  Enid was a very elemental and unconscious character, who had never before
  been thrown into such a turmoil of thoughts and feelings. And her first
  feeling, under her last shock, was a primitive human feeling that for her
  isolation had come to an end. She had found something more crushing and
  complicated than she could carry alone, and she must have a friend.</p>

  <p>She therefore went straight out of the front door and down the road to
  find a friend. She went to find a charlatan, a schemer, a grotesque lying
  mystagogue, a man who had done her and hers the most abominable wrong, and
  she found him just going into his own house, with the brass plate outside it.
  Something not to be formulated in words told her that, in some dark,
  distorted, undiscoverable way he was on her side, and that he would manage to
  get whatever he chose to try for. She stopped the villain of her strange
  story and spoke to him quite naturally, as if he were her brother.</p>

  <p>"I wish you would come back to our place a moment," she said. "Another
  ghastly thing has happened now and I can't make head or tail of
  anything."</p>

  <p>He turned promptly and threw a sharp glance up the street.</p>

  <p>"Ah," he said, "then the police have come already."</p>

  <p>She stared at him speechless for a moment, as a light gradually began to
  break upon her rocking brain.</p>

  <p>"Did you know they were coming?" she cried; and then in a final universal
  flash she seemed to take in a thousand things at once. The combined product
  of them all was perhaps curious. For there broke out of her only the
  expression of incredulous astonishment: "But aren't you wicked, then?"</p>

  <p>"Only moderately so," he replied. "But I dare say what I did would be
  considered indefensible. It was the only thing I could think of to save him.
  It had to be done in rather a hurry."</p>

  <p>She drew a deep breath and there dawned upon her gradually, like something
  seen in the distance, a memory and a meaning.</p>

  <p>"Why, I see now," she said. "It was just like what you did, when you
  shoved him from under the car."</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid I'm impetuous," said Judson, "and perhaps I jump too
  soon."</p>

  <p>"But on both occasions," she said, "you only jumped just in time."</p>

  <p>Then she went into the house alone; her mind was still stratified with
  terror; the notion of her father as a monkey, as a lunatic, as something
  worse. And yet in a corner of her sunken subconscious soul something was
  singing, because her friend was not so wicked after all.</p>

  <p>Ten minutes later, when Inspector Brandon, a sandy-haired representative
  of the C.I.D., with a stolid appearance but a lively eye, entered the
  Windrush parlour, he found himself confronted with a square-faced,
  square-shouldered medical gentleman, with dark hair and an inscrutable smile.
  Nobody, who had seen Dr. Judson shaken by the various passions of the late
  peril and crisis, could have recognized him, in the placid impenetrable
  friend of the family who now sat facing the policeman.</p>

  <p>"I am sure, Inspector, that you agree with me in wishing to spare the
  unfortunate lady as far as possible," he said smoothly. "I happen to be the
  family physician, and I shall have to be responsible for her condition in any
  case. But I am responsible in other ways, too, and you may take it from me
  that a man in my position will put no obstacles in your way in doing your
  duty. I hope you have no objection, for the moment, to explaining the general
  nature of your business to me."</p>

  <p>"Well, sir," said the Inspector, "so far as that is concerned, it's
  generally rather a relief in these cases to be able to talk to a third party.
  But you'll understand, of course, that I shall expect you to talk
  straight."</p>

  <p>"I'll talk straight enough," answered the doctor coolly. "I understand you
  have a warrant for the arrest of Mr. Walter Windrush."</p>

  <p>The policeman nodded:</p>

  <p>"For the murder of Isaac Morse," he said. "Do you know where Windrush is
  at present?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Judson gravely, "I know where Windrush is at present."</p>

  <p>He looked across the table tranquilly, with level brows, and added:</p>

  <p>"I will tell you, if you like. I will take you to him, if you like. I know
  exactly where he is just now."</p>

  <p>"We mustn't have any hiding or hanky-panky, you know," said the Inspector.
  "You will be taking a serious responsibility, if there's any chance that he
  will escape."</p>

  <p>"He will not escape." said Dr. Judson.</p>

  <p>There was a silence, which was broken by a slight scurry outside and a
  telegraph-boy ran up the steps with a wire for the Inspector. That official
  read it with a frown of surprise, and then looked across at his
  companion.</p>

  <p>"This comes opportunely in one sense," he said. "It seems to justify our
  pausing for an explanation, if you're quite sure of what you say."</p>

  <p>He handed the telegram to the doctor, who read with his rapid glance the
  words: DON'T DO ANYTHING ABOUT W. W. TILL I COME. SHALL BE ROUND IN HALF AN
  HOUR. HARRINGTON.</p>

  <p>"That is from my superior officer." said the official. "The chief
  detective who has been studying this matter on the spot. Indeed, one of the
  chief detectives in the world today, I suppose."</p>

  <p>"Yes," said the doctor, dryly. "Didn't Mr. Harrington pursue his studies
  under the name of Mr. Wilmot? And live next door?"</p>

  <p>"You seem to know a thing or two," said Inspector Brandon with a
  smile.</p>

  <p>"Well, your friend behaved so much like a burglar that I guessed he must
  be a policeman," said Judson, "and he said he had the best authority; I found
  it wasn't the authority of the family, so I assumed it was probably the
  authority of the law."</p>

  <p>"Whatever he said was pretty sound, you may be certain," said the other.
  "Harrington is pretty nearly infallible in the long run. And in this case he
  was certainly justified by what he found, though nobody would ever have
  guessed it."</p>

  <p>"What he found," said the doctor, "was the skeleton of a man, stuffed into
  the hollow of the tree, evidently having been there for a long time, marked
  by an unmistakable injury to the occiput, done by violence and inflicted with
  the left hand."</p>

  <p>Brandon stared across at him. "And how do you know that he found that?" he
  asked.</p>

  <p>"I know because I found it myself," answered Judson.</p>

  <p>There was a pause, and then he added: "Yes, Inspector, it is quite true
  that I know something about this business; as I told you, I can take you to
  Windrush himself if necessary. Of course, I don't claim any right to bargain
  with you, but since you are hung up by that telegram for the moment, and I
  may be in a position to help, do you mind doing me a favour in return? Will
  you tell me the whole story? Or perhaps I should say the whole theory?"</p>

  <p>The face of Brandon of the C.I.D was not only humorous and good-humoured;
  it was also highly intelligent, when the first veneer of official stolidity
  had worn off. He looked at the doctor thoughtfully for a little, and seemed
  to approve of what he studied. Then he said with a smile:</p>

  <p>"I suppose you are one of those amateur detectives who read detective
  stories, or even write them. Well, I don't deny this is a bit of a detective
  story. And there is one question that's always turning up in books and talk
  of that sort, and it's rather relevant here. You've seen it twenty times.
  Suppose a real Man of Genius wanted to commit a crime?"</p>

  <p>He ruminated a little and then went on. "From our point of view, the great
  problem in any crime of killing is always what to do with the body. I expect
  that fact has saved many a man from being murdered. The fact that he is more
  dangerous to his enemy dead than alive. All sorts of tricks are tried;
  dismembering and dispersing the body, throwing it into kilns and furnaces,
  putting it under concrete floors, like Dr. Crippen. And in the study of such
  stories, this story does stand out as the very extraordinary and yet
  effective expedient of what I call a Man of Genius.</p>

  <p>"Isaac Morse flourished about twenty years ago as a financial agent and
  adviser; I imagine you know what that means. In fact he flourished as a
  money-lender, and flourished like the green bay-tree, otherwise the wicked
  man. He flourished so very much, and so very much at other people's expense,
  that he was probably pretty unpopular with a good many people whose
  circumstances were not so flourishing. Among these were two students; the
  one, who was a less interesting person, was a medical student named Duveen.
  The other was an art student named Windrush.</p>

  <p>"The financial adviser was imprudent enough to leave his car and
  chauffeur, and walk across a corner of a heath to the hotel where the
  conference was to be held. In doing so, they passed a very desolate dip in
  the moorland marked only by this queer, hollow tree. . . . What would the
  ordinary, stupid, professional killer have done? He would have killed,
  doubtless when his other companion's back was turned, and if he got away with
  it, would have skulked back and tried to scratch a shallow grave in the sandy
  heath. Or tried to cart away the corpse in a box under the eyes of all the
  servants at the inn. That is the difference between him and a man with
  imagination&mdash;an artist. The artist attempted something perfectly wild
  and new, and apparently absurd; but something that has succeeded for twenty
  years. He professed to have a romantic affection for that particular spot, he
  boasted of his intention of buying it and living on it. He did buy it, and he
  did live on it, and he did by this method bury from all eyes but his own the
  secret of what he had left there. For in those few moments, when the other
  student had gone on ahead and was hidden beyond the sprawling tree, he struck
  Morse a mortal blow with his left hand and threw his body into the yawning
  cavern in the tree. It was a solitary spot and naturally nobody actually saw
  him do the deed. But long after the medical student had gone on to the hotel
  and caught a train to London, another traveller on the moor saw Windrush
  sitting staring at the tree and the pools, in a dark reverie doubtless full
  of his daring scheme. And it is an odd thing that even the passer-by thought
  his solitary figure looked as tragic as Cain, and the pools under the red
  sunset looked like blood.</p>

  <p>"The rest of his audacious scheme, or artistic pose, worked easily enough.
  By bragging of being cranky, he escaped all chance of the suspicion of being
  criminal. He could cage up the tree like a wild animal, without anybody
  thinking it any sillier than it seemed. You will notice that his caging grew
  more strict; when people began to touch or examine the tree, he locked
  everybody out of the garden. Except Harrington&mdash;and, apparently,
  you."</p>

  <p>"I suppose," said Judson, "that Harrington, or Wilmot, or whatever you
  call him, told you that the artist admitted being ambidexterous&mdash;doing
  things with his left hand as well as his right."</p>

  <p>"Quite so," replied the Inspector. "Well, Dr. Judson, I have obliged you
  and told you practically all I know at present. If there is anything more
  that you know, and we don't know, I am bound to warn you in any case that you
  are bound to return the favour. This is a deadly serious business. It is a
  hanging matter."</p>

  <p>"No," said Dr. Judson thoughtfully; "not a hanging matter."</p>

  <p>As the other only stared he added, still in a meditative style:</p>

  <p>"You will never hang Walter Windrush."</p>

  <p>"What do you mean?" demanded the officer, in a new sharp voice.</p>

  <p>"Because," said the doctor, beaming at him, "Walter Windrush has been in a
  lunatic asylum for some little time. He was certified in the regular old
  official manner"&mdash;he talked of it as of something that happened a
  hundred years before&mdash;"and the medical authorities that certified him
  noted the symptom of ambidexterous action and a somewhat excessive
  development of power in the left hand."</p>

  <p>Inspector Brandon was staring like one stunned at the brisk and smiling
  doctor, who rose to his feet as if the interview were over. But even as he
  stepped towards the door, he found his exit blocked by the presence of a
  newcomer, and found himself looking once more at the long hair and long,
  smiling visage of the gentleman he had so heartily disliked under the name of
  Mr. Wilmot.</p>

  <p>"Back again," said Wilmot, or Harrington, his smile widening to a grin,
  "and apparently just in time."</p>

  <p>The Inspector had recovered from his stupefaction and his senses and
  perceptions were quick enough. He got to his feet quickly and said:</p>

  <p>"Is anything the matter?"</p>

  <p>"No," said the great detective; "nothing is the matter. Except that we are
  after the wrong man."</p>

  <p>And he settled himself comfortably in a chair and smiled at the
  Inspector.</p>

  <p>"The wrong man!" repeated Brandon. "You can't mean that Windrush is the
  wrong man! I've just been taking the liberty of telling Dr. Judson the real
  story&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Under the impression," said Harrington, "that you knew the real story.
  For my part, I never knew it till about twenty minutes ago."</p>

  <p>His face and manner were eminently cheerful; but as he turned to speak to
  the doctor, they took on a sort of business-like gravity and he seemed to
  choose and weigh his words.</p>

  <p>"Doctor," he said, "you are a man of science and you understand what
  hardly anybody in this world does understand. You understand what is really
  meant of a hypothesis that holds the field. As a man of science, you must
  have had the experience of building up a very elaborate, a very complete and
  even a very convincing theory."</p>

  <p>"Why, yes," said John Judson, with a grim smile; "I have certainly had the
  experience of building up a very elaborate, very complete and even convincing
  theory."</p>

  <p>"But," went on the detective thoughtfully, "as a man of science, you were
  nevertheless ready to entertain the possibility, even if it were the remote
  possibility, that your theory was after all untrue."</p>

  <p>"You are right again," said Judson, and the smile grew grimmer. "I was
  ready to entertain the remote possibility that my theory was quite
  untrue."</p>

  <p>"Well, I take full responsibility for the unexpected collapse of my
  theory," said the great detective, with his agreeable smile. "You must not
  blame the Inspector; the whole of that story of the artist criminal and his
  original scheme of concealment was my idea, and an infernally intelligent and
  interesting idea too, though I say it who shouldn't. There's really nothing
  to be said against it, except that it can't be true. Everything has a little
  weakness somewhere."</p>

  <p>"But why can't it be true?" asked the astonished Brandon.</p>

  <p>"Only," answered his commanding officer, "because I have just discovered
  the real murderer."</p>

  <p>Amid the startled silence that followed he added, as in a pleasant
  abstraction: "That grand and bold artistic crime we dreamed of was, like many
  great things, too great for this world. Perhaps in Utopia, perhaps in
  Paradise, we may have murders of that perfect and poetical sort. But the real
  murderer behaves in a much more ordinary fashion. . . . Brandon, I have found
  the other student. Naturally, you know rather less about the other
  student."</p>

  <p>"Pardon me," said the Inspector stiffly; "of course, we traced the
  movements of the other student, and of everybody who could be involved. He
  took the train to London that evening and, a month after, went to New York on
  business and thence to the Argentine, where he set up a successful and highly
  respectable practice as a doctor."</p>

  <p>"Exactly," said Harrington. "He did the dull, ordinary thing that the real
  criminal does. He bolted."</p>

  <p>Dr. Judson seemed to find his voice for the first time since the last turn
  of events, and it was like the voice of a new man.</p>

  <p>"Are you quite certain," he said at last, "that Windrush is innocent after
  all?"</p>

  <p>"I am quite certain," said Harrington seriously. "This is not a hypothesis
  but a proof. There are a hundred converging proofs; I will only give you a
  few. The injury to the skull was done with a very unusual surgical
  instrument, and I have found the instrument in possession of the man who used
  it. The spot selected would only have been so chosen by a man of special
  knowledge. The man called Duveen, whom we know to have been present, and to
  have had a stronger motive than Windrush (for he was ruined and in fear of
  exposure), was and is a man with exactly that special knowledge. He is a
  surgeon and a skilful man. He is also a left-handed man."</p>

  <p>"If you are certain, sir, the thing is settled," said the Inspector rather
  regretfully. "As Dr. Judson has explained, the left-handed business was also
  a part of the disease or aberration of Windrush&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You will agree that I never said I was certain about Windrush," said
  Harrington calmly; "I do say I am certain now."</p>

  <p>"Doctor Judson says&mdash;" began the Inspector.</p>

  <p>"Dr. Judson says," said that physician himself, springing up like a spring
  released; "Dr. Judson says that everything that Dr. Judson has said for the
  last forty-eight hours is a pack of lies! Dr. Judson says that Walter
  Windrush is no more mad than we are. Dr. Judson begs to announce that his
  celebrated theory of Arboreal Ambidexterity is a blasted mass of balderdash
  that ought never to have taken in a baby! Duodiapsychosis! Huh!" And he
  snorted with a violent and indescribable noise.</p>

  <p>"This is very extraordinary," said Inspector Brandon.</p>

  <p>"I bet it is," said the doctor. "We all seem to have made pretty damned
  fools of ourselves by being too clever, but I was the damndest. Look here,
  this has got to be put straight at once! It's bad enough for Miss Windrush
  that her father should be locked up for a day. I must make out some sort of
  document admitting a mistake, or announcing a recovery, or some nonsense, and
  get him out again."</p>

  <p>"But," said Harrington gravely, "I understood that no less a person than
  Dr. Doone also signed the emergency order, and his authority&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Doone!" cried Judson with a quite indescribable frenzy of contempt,
  "Doone! Doone would sign anything! Doone would say anything. Doone is a
  doddering old fraud! He wrote one book that was boomed when I was a baby, and
  he's never opened a book since. I saw all the new books on his table with
  none of the leaves cut. And the way he talked about prehistoric man was more
  prehistoric than fossils. As if any serious scientific man now believed all
  his stuff about Arboreal Man! Golly, I didn't have any difficulty with Doone!
  I only had to flatter him at first by making it all very Arboreal, and then
  talking about what he didn't understand and dared not question. I had great
  fun with something newer than Psycho-analysis."</p>

  <p>"All the same," said Harrington, "as Dr. Doone has signed the order, he'll
  have to sign the countermanding of it."</p>

  <p>"Oh, very well," cried the impetuous Judson, who had already scribbled
  something on a page and was already rushing from the room, "I'll cut round
  and get him to sign it, too."</p>

  <p>"I think I should rather like to go with you," said Harrington.</p>

  <p>In the track of the headlong Judson, they trailed round with tolerable
  rapidity to that stately and pillared house in the West End, the house with
  the sombre blinds, which the doctor had once visited alone. The scene between
  him and the stately Dr. Doone was rather curious. Now that they had some
  inner light on the matter, they could appreciate the evasiveness of the great
  man and the pertinacity of the smaller one. However, Dr. Doone evidently felt
  it was wiser to join in his colleague's recantation, and, carelessly picking
  up a quill pen, he signed the paper with his left hand.</p><hr><br>

  <h2><a name="c026"
     id="c026">VI</a>. &mdash; THE EPILOGUE OF THE GARDEN</h2>

<p class="first">A fortnight afterwards, Mr. Walter Windrush was walking round
his
  favourite garden, smiling and smoking as if nothing had happened. He was
  smoking a small cigarette in a very long cigarette-holder, and he really was
  doing it as if nothing had happened. For that was the real mystery of Walter
  Windrush, which neither medical non legal experts were ever in the least
  likely to fathom. That was the real Secret, which no detective would ever
  detect.</p>

  <p>He had been turned into a monstrosity in the eyes of his nearest and
  dearest; he had been described to his own child as a chimpanzee and as a
  chattering maniac; he had been described again as a pitiless and patient
  assassin, planning his whole life upon the concealment of a crime; he had
  been dragged through or threatened by every degrading and hideous experience;
  he had found that his favourite private paradise had been the scene of a
  murder and that his friend found it possible to believe him to be a murderer;
  he had been in the madhouse; he had been near to the gallows. And all these
  things were of less importance to him than the shape of the great coloured
  cloud of morning that came sailing up out of the east, or the fact that the
  birds had begun to sing in the branches of the tragic tree. Some would have
  said his mood was too shallow for such tragedies. Some, who saw deeper, might
  have said it was too deep for them. But upon such deep springs of levity he
  lived, and so he walked, as if in another world. It is possible that
  Inspector Brandon did not completely comprehend the monster called a Man of
  Genius.</p>

  <p>Indeed, he was much less affected by the morbid memories than the man of
  common sense. When he had strolled about alone for a few moments, he was
  joined by his young friend the doctor, but the doctor looked comparatively
  gloomy and embarrassed; so much so that the artist rallied him about it.</p>

  <p>"Well," said Dr. Judson, with something of his old sort of sullen candour,
  "I ought to be ashamed of it, I suppose, as well as of everything else. But I
  confess I can't think how you can bear to hang about in the place."</p>

  <p>"My dear fellow, and you are the cold and rational man of science," said
  Windrush lightly. "In what superstitions you wallow! In what medieval
  darkness you brood all your days! I am only a poor, impracticable, poetic
  dreamer, but I assure you I am in broad daylight. In fact, I have never been
  out of it, not even when you put me in that pleasant little sanatorium for a
  day or two. I was quite happy there; and as for the lunatics, well I came to
  the conclusion that they were rather saner than my friends outside."</p>

  <p>"There's no need to rub it in," said Judson with a groan. "I won't
  apologize for thinking you a madman, because I never did think so. But I
  suppose that, given a fine sense of delicacy, I ought to apologize for
  thinking you a murderer. But there are murderers and murderers; all I knew
  was that I had found a murdered man you had hidden in your garden. I didn't
  know how far you might have been provoked or justified. Indeed, from all I
  hear of the late lamented Mr. Morse, he was of the sort that won't be missed.
  But I knew that Wilmot was a detective and was poking round the tree, and I
  knew that meant your arrest in precious quick time. I had to act pretty
  quickly myself; I generally do act a good deal too quickly, for that matter.
  A plea of insanity after arrest is always weak&mdash;especially when it's not
  true. But if you were already certified you couldn't even be arrested. I had
  to invent an imaginary disease, entirely out of my own head in about five
  minutes. I put it together somehow out of bits of that talk we had about
  ambidexterity and bits of Doone's rotten old rubbish about anthropoids. I put
  that in, partly because I foresaw that I should have to nobble Doone somehow,
  and partly because it fitted so well into the tale of the tree. But even now
  I hate to think of the horrors I made up, even though they were horrors that
  never happened. But what must one feel about the horrors that really have
  happened?"</p>

  <p>"Well," replied the artist cheerfully, "and what do you feel about
  them?"</p>

  <p>"I can't help feeling," said Judson, "that men might avoid the place like
  a plague-spot."</p>

  <p>"The birds perch on the tree," said Windrush, "as if it were the shoulder
  of St. Francis."</p>

  <p>There was a silence and then the brooding Judson said:</p>

  <p>"After all, sir, it is damned extraordinary that you lived alone with this
  tree for twenty years and never found what was inside it. I know it rotted to
  bones pretty quickly, because the stream carried away the decomposition; but
  you might have been pulling the tree about any day."</p>

  <p>Walter Windrush looked at him steadily with his clear, glassy eyes.</p>

  <p>"I have never even touched the tree," he said. "I have never been within
  two yards of it."</p>

  <p>Something in his manner suggested to the young man that they had come near
  the nerve of the eccentricity; he was silent and the artist went on:</p>

  <p>"You tell us a great deal about Evolution and the Ascent of Man. You
  scientific men are very superior, of course, and there is nothing legendary
  about you. You do not believe in the Garden of Eden. You do not believe in
  Adam and Eve. Above all, you do not believe in the Forbidden Tree."</p>

  <p>The doctor shook his head in half-humorous deprecation, but the other went
  on with the same grave fixity of gaze.</p>

  <p>"But I say to you, always have in your garden a Forbidden Tree. Always
  have in your life something that you may not touch. That is the secret of
  being young and happy for ever. There was never a story so true as that story
  you call a fable. But you will evolve and explore and eat of the tree of
  knowledge, and what comes of it?"</p>

  <p>"Well," said the doctor defensively, "a good many things have come of it
  that are not so bad."</p>

  <p>"My friend," said the poet. "You once asked me what was the Use of this
  tree. I told you I did not wish it to be any Use. And was I wrong? I have got
  nothing but good out of it, because to me it was useless. What have they got
  out of it, those to whom it was useful? What did they get who asked, after
  the manner of that ancient folly, for the Fruit of the tree? It was useful to
  Duveen, or Doone, or whatever you call him; and what fruit did he gather but
  the fruit of sin and death? He got murder and suicide out of it; they told me
  this morning that he had taken poison, leaving a confession of the murder of
  Morse. It was useful to Wilmot in a way, of course; but what did even Wilmot
  and Brandon get out of it, but the dreadful duty of dragging a
  fellow-creature to the gallows? It was useful to you, when you wanted a
  nonsensical nightmare of some sort, with which to lock me up for life and
  terrify my family. But it was a nightmare; and you yourself still seem to be
  a little haunted by the nightmare. But I repeat that it was useless to me;
  and I am still in the broad daylight."</p>

  <p>As he spoke, Judson looked up across the lawn and saw Enid Windrush come
  out of the shadow of the house into the sun. Something in the golden balance
  of her figure, with the flushed face and flame-like radiation of her hair,
  made her look as if she had actually stepped from an allegorical picture of
  the dawn; and swiftly as she moved, her movements always had the grand,
  gradual curves of great unconscious forces, of the falling waters and the
  wind. Something of this congruity with the almost cosmic drift of the
  conversation doubtless rose into the poet's mind, as he said casually
  enough:</p>

  <p>"Well, Enid, I've been boosting the old property again. I've been modestly
  comparing my own backyard to the Garden of Eden. But it's no good talking to
  this deplorable materialistic young man. He doesn't believe in Adam and Eve
  or anything they tell you about on Sundays."</p>

  <p>The young man said nothing; at that moment he was wholly occupied with
  seeing.</p>

  <p>"I don't know whether there are any snakes about," she said, laughing.</p>

  <p>"Some of us," said Judson, "have been in the sort of delirium in which men
  see snakes. But I think we are all cured now, and there are other things to
  see."</p>

  <p>"I suppose you would say," said Windrush dreamily, "that we have evolved
  into a higher condition and can see something nicer. Well, don't
  misunderstand me; I'm not against anybody evolving, if he does it quietly, in
  a gentlemanly way, and without all this fuss. It wouldn't matter much, if we
  had begun by climbing about in trees. But I still think that even monkeys
  would have been wise to leave one taboo tree; one sacred tree they did not
  climb. But evolution only means . . . bother, my cigarette's gone out. I
  think I must go and smoke in the library henceforward."</p>

  <p>"Why do you say henceforward?"</p>

  <p>They did not hear his answer as he walked away, but he said: "Because it
  is The Garden of Eden."</p>

  <p>A sudden silence fell between the two who were left facing each other on
  the lawn. Then John Judson went across to the girl and confronting her with
  great gravity said:</p>

  <p>"In one respect your father underrates my orthodoxy."</p>

  <p>Her own smile grew a little graver as she asked him why he said so.</p>

  <p>"Because I do believe in Adam and Eve," answered the man of science, and
  he suddenly seized both her hands.</p>

  <p>She left them where they were and continued to gaze at him with an utter
  stillness and steadiness. Only her eyes had altered.</p>

  <p>"I believe in Adam," she said, "though I was once quite firmly convinced
  that he was the Serpent."</p>

  <p>"I never thought you were the Serpent," he answered in the same new tone
  of musing, that was almost mystical, "but I thought you were the Angel of the
  Flaming Sword."</p>

  <p>"I have thrown away the sword," said Enid Windrush.</p>

  <p>"And left only the angel," he answered, and she rejoined: "Left only the
  woman."</p>

  <p>On the top of the once accursed tree a small bird burst into song, and at
  the same moment a great morning wind from the south rushed upon the garden,
  bending all its shrubs and bushes and seeming, as does the air when it passes
  over sunlit foliage, to drive the sunshine before it in mighty waves. And it
  seemed to both of them that something had broken or been loosened, a last
  bond with chaos and the night, a last strand of the net of some resisting
  Nothing that obstructs creation; and God had made a new garden and they stood
  alive on the first foundations of the world.</p>

  <h2><a name="c03"
     id="c03">THE ECSTATIC THIEF</a></h2>

  <h2><a name="c031"
     id="c031">I</a>. &mdash; THE NAME OF NADOWAY</h2>

<p class="first">The name of Nadoway was in one sense famous, and even after a
fashion,
  inspiring and sublime. Alfred the Great had borne it before him like a boon
  or gift, as he wandered in the woods and awaited the deliverance of Wessex.
  So at least one would infer from the poster in which he was represented, in
  flamboyant colours, as repairing the ruin of the Burning Cakes by the offer
  of Nadoway's Nubs, a superior sort of small biscuit. Shakespeare had heard
  the name like a trumpet-blast; at least if we may credit the striking picture
  inscribed "Anne Hathaway Had a Way with Nadoway", and representing the poet
  lifting a shining morning face on the appearance of these refreshments.
  Nelson, in the high moment of battle, had seen it written on the sky; at
  least it is so written on all the gigantic hoardings of the Battle of
  Trafalgar, with which we are so familiar in the streets; the picture to which
  are aptly appended the noble lines of Campbell: "Of Nelson and the Nubs, Sing
  the glorious day's renown." Equally familiar is the more modern patriotic
  poster representing a British Sailor working a machine-gun, from which a
  shower of Nubs is perpetually pouring upon the public. This somewhat unjustly
  exaggerates the deadly character of the Nubs. He who has been privileged to
  put a Nub to his lips has certainly been somewhat at a loss to distinguish it
  from other and lesser biscuits. But to have a Nub embedded in the body, by
  the ordinary process of digestion, has never been known to be actually fatal
  like a bullet. And, on the whole, many have tended to suspect that the chief
  difference, between Nadoway's Nubs and anybody else's, lay in the
  omnipresence of this superb picture-gallery of advertisements, which seemed
  to surround Nadoway with flamboyant pageantry and splendid heraldic and
  historic processions.</p>

  <p>In the midst of all this encircling blazonry and blowing of trumpets,
  there was nothing but a little, plain, hard-faced man with a grey, goatish
  beard and spectacles, who never went anywhere except to business and to a
  brown brick Baptist Chapel. This was Mr. Jacob Nadoway, later of course Sir
  Jacob Nadoway, and later still Lord Normandale, the original founder of the
  firm and fountain of all the Nubs. He still lived very simply himself, but he
  could afford every luxury. He could afford the luxury of having the
  Honourable Millicent Milton as private secretary. She was the daughter of a
  decayed aristocratic house, with which he had been on superficially friendly
  terms, as they lived in the same neighbourhood, and it was natural that the
  relative importance of the two should have gradually changed. Mr. Nadoway
  could afford the luxury of being the Honourable Millicent's patron. The
  Honourable Millicent could not afford the luxury of not being Mr. Nadoway's
  secretary.</p>

  <p>It was, however, a luxury of which she sometimes had golden dreams. Not
  that old Nadoway treated her badly, or even paid her badly, or would have
  ventured to be rude to her in any respect. The old chapel-going Radical was
  much too shrewd for that. He understood well that there was still something
  like a bargain and a balance between the New Rich and the New Poor. She had
  been more or less familiar with the Nadoway household, long before she had an
  official post there, and could hardly be treated otherwise than as a friend
  of the family, even if it was not exactly the sort of family she would have
  sought in which to find her friends. And yet she had found friends there, and
  had once been even in danger of finding not only friends but a friend.
  Perhaps, at one time, not only a friend.</p>

  <p>Nadoway had two sons, who went to school and college, and in the
  recognized modern manner were unobtrusively manufactured into gentlemen. The
  manner of the moulding was indeed somewhat different in the two cases, and in
  both she watched it with a certain curious interest. It was perhaps symbolic
  that the elder was John Nadoway, dating from the days when his father
  retained a taste for plain or preferably Scriptural names. The younger was
  Norman Nadoway, and the name marked a certain softening towards notions of
  elegance, foreshadowing the awful possibility of Normandale. There had been a
  happy time, when John could really be described as Jack. He was a very boyish
  sort of boy and played cricket and climbed trees with a certain natural
  grace, like that of a young animal alive and innocent in the sunshine. He was
  not unattractive and she was not unattracted by him. And yet every time he
  reappeared, at different stages of his college and early commercial career,
  she was conscious that something was fading while something was solidifying.
  He was passing through that mysterious process, by which so many radiant and
  godlike boys eventually turn into businessmen. She could not help feeling
  that there must be something wrong with education&mdash;or possibly something
  wrong with life. It seemed somehow as if he was always growing bigger and
  growing smaller.</p>

  <p>Norman Nadoway, on the other hand, began to be interesting just about the
  moment when Jack Nadoway began to be uninteresting. He was one that flowered
  late; if the figure of a flower can be used of one who (throughout his early
  years) resembled a rather pallid turnip. He had a large head and large ears
  and a colourless face and expression, and for a time passed for something of
  a mooncalf. But when he was at school, he worked hard at mathematics, and
  when he was at Cambridge at economics. From this it was but one wild leap to
  the study of politics and social reform; and from this came the grand bust-up
  in the House of Nubs and Jacob's wrath, to Nadoway's the direful spring.</p>

  <p>Norman had begun by shaking the brown brick chapel to its foundations by
  announcing his intention of being a Curate in the Church of
  England&mdash;nay, in the High Church party of the Church of England. But his
  father was less troubled by this than by the reports that reached him of his
  son's highly successful lectures on Political Economy. It was a very
  different sort of Political Economy from that which his father had
  successfully preached and practised. It was so different that his father, in
  a memorable explosion at the breakfast-table, described it as Socialism.</p>

  <p>"Somebody must go down to Cambridge and stop him!" said the elder Mr.
  Nadoway fidgeting in his chair and rapping restlessly on the table. "You must
  go and talk to him, John; or you must bring him here and I'll talk to him.
  Otherwise the business will simply go smash."</p>

  <p>Both parts of the alternative programme apparently had to be carried out.
  John, the junior partner of Nadoway and Son, did go down to Cambridge and
  talked to him, but apparently did not stop him. John did eventually bring him
  back to Jacob Nadoway, that Jacob might talk to him. Jacob was in no way
  reluctant to do so, and yet the interview did not turn quite as he had
  intended. Indeed, it was a rather puzzling interview.</p>

  <p>It took place in old Jacob's study, which looked out through round
  bow-windows at 'The Lawns', after which the house was still named. It was a
  very Victorian house, of the sort that would have been described at the time
  as built by Philistines for Philistines. There was a great deal of curved
  glass about it, in its conservatories and its semi-circular windows. There
  was a great deal of dome and cupola and canopy about it, with all the porches
  covered as if by escalloped wooden umbrellas. There was a good deal of rather
  ugly coloured glass and a good deal of not altogether ugly, but very
  artificial, clipped hedges and Dutch gardening. In short, it was the sort of
  comfortable Victorian home that was regarded as very vulgar by the æsthetes
  of that period. Mr. Matthew Arnold would have passed the house with a gentle
  sigh. Mr. John Ruskin would have recoiled in horror and called down curses
  from heaven on it, from a neighbouring hill. Even Mr. William Morris would
  have grumbled as he passed, about the sort of architecture that was only
  upholstery. But I am not so sure about Mr. Sacheverall Sitwell. We have
  reached a time when the curved windows and canopied porticoes of that house
  have begun to take on something of a dreamy glamour of distance. And I am not
  sure that Mr. Sitwell might not have been found wandering in its inner
  chambers and composing a poem about its dusty charms, though it would
  certainly have surprised Mr. Jacob Nadoway to find him so engaged. Whether,
  after the interview, even Mr. Sitwell could write a poem about Mr. Nadoway, I
  will not undertake to decide.</p>

  <p>Millicent Milton had come through the garden to the study, at about the
  same moment as the junior partner arrived there. She was tall and fair and
  her lifted and pointed chin gave her profile a distinction beyond mere good
  looks. Her eyelids looked at the first glance a little sleepy and at the
  second a little haughty, but she was not really either one or the other, but
  only reasonably resigned. She sat down at her ordinary desk to do her
  ordinary work, but she very soon rose from it again, as if with a silent
  offer to withdraw, since the domestic discussion was becoming very domestic.
  But old Nadoway motioned her back with irritable reassurance and she remained
  the spectator of the whole scene.</p>

  <p>Old Nadoway had barked out rather abruptly, like one bothered for the
  first time:</p>

  <p>"But I thought you two had had a talk."</p>

  <p>"Yes, father," said John Nadoway, looking at the carpet, "we have had a
  talk."</p>

  <p>"I hope you got Norman to see," went on the old man in a milder tone,
  "that he simply mustn't chalk out all these wild projects so long as we're
  all really in the business. My business would be ruined in a month if I tried
  to carry out those crazy ideal schemes about Bonuses and Co-Partnership. And
  how can I have my son using my name, and shouting everywhere that my methods
  are not fit for a dog? Is it reasonable? Didn't John explain to you that it's
  not reasonable?"</p>

  <p>The large, pale face of the curate, rather to everybody's surprise,
  wrinkled into a dry smile, and he said: "Yes, Jack explained a great deal of
  that to me, but I also did a little explaining. I explained, for instance,
  that I have a business, too."</p>

  <p>"What about your father's business?" asked Jacob.</p>

  <p>"I am about my Father's business," said the priest in a hard voice.</p>

  <p>There was a glaring silence, broken rather nervously.</p>

  <p>"The fact is, father, it won't do," said John Nadoway heavily, and still
  studying the carpet. "I believe I said everything for you you could have said
  yourself. But Norman knows the new conditions, and it won't do."</p>

  <p>Old Mr. Nadoway made a motion as if swallowing something, and then said:
  "Do you mean to sit there and tell me you're against me, too? Against me and
  the whole concern?"</p>

  <p>"I'm in favour of the whole concern, and that's the whole point," said
  John. "I suppose I shall be responsible for it&mdash;well, some time. But I'm
  damned if I'll be responsible for all the old ways of doing things."</p>

  <p>"You're glad enough of the money that was got by the old way of doing
  things," said his father savagely, "and now you come back to me with this
  nonsensical namby-pamby Socialism."</p>

  <p>"My dear Dad," said John Nadoway, staring stolidly. "Do I look like a
  Socialist?"</p>

  <p>Millicent, as an onlooker, took in the whole of his heavy and handsome
  figure, from its beautifully blacked boots to its beautifully oiled hair, and
  could hardly repress a laugh.</p>

  <p>The voice of Norman Nadoway clove into it with a sudden vibrancy, not
  without violence.</p>

  <p>"We must clear the Nadoway name."</p>

  <p>"Do you dare to tell me," cried the old man fiercely, "that my name needs
  any clearing?"</p>

  <p>"By the new standards, yes," said John after a silence.</p>

  <p>The old merchant sat down suddenly and silently in his chair and turned to
  his secretary, as if the interview were ended.</p>

  <p>"I find I shall not want you this evening," he said. "You had better take
  a little time off."</p>

  <p>She rose rather waveringly and went towards the french windows that gave
  upon the garden. The pale evening sky had been suddenly turned to night by
  the contrast of a large luminous moon coming up behind dark trees and
  striping the grey-green lawns with dark shadows. She had always been puzzled
  by the fact that there seemed to be something romantic about the garden and
  even the grotesque house, which was inhabited by such highly prosaic people.
  She was already outside the glass doors and in the garden, when she heard old
  Nadoway speak again.</p>

  <p>"The hand of the Lord is heavy upon me," he said. "It seems hard that I
  have had three sons and they all turned against me."</p>

  <p>"There is no question of turning against you, father," said John rapidly
  and smoothly. "It is only a question of reconstructing the business so as to
  suit new conditions and a rather different public opinion. I am sure that
  neither of your sons intends to show ingratitude or impertinence."</p>

  <p>"If either of your sons did that," said Norman in his deep voice, "it
  would be every bit as wicked as going on in the old way."</p>

  <p>"Well," said his father rather wearily, "we will leave it at that just
  now. I shall not go on much longer."</p>

  <p>But Millicent Milton was staring at the dark house in a new fit of
  mystification. The two brothers had ignored and slurred over, with something
  resembling skill, a certain phrase used by their father. But she had quite
  unmistakably heard the old man say: "Three sons."</p>

  <p>She had never heard of any other son. She remained staring at the rococo
  outline of that rather ridiculous and yet romantic villa, with its domes and
  ornamental verandas dark against the moon; with its bulbous windows and
  plants in bloated pots; its clumsy statues and congested garden-beds and all
  the swollen outline of the thing made almost monstrous by moonshine and
  darkness, and she wondered for the first time if it held a secret.</p><hr><br>

  <h2><a name="c032"
     id="c032">II</a>. &mdash; THE BURGLAR AND THE BROOCH</h2>

<p class="first">It was the scare of the burglary that actually started the
story towards
  the discovery of rather strange things. As a burglary it was trivial enough,
  in the sense that the thief did not apparently succeed in taking anything,
  being surprised before he could do so. But it was certainly not only the
  burglar who was surprised.</p>

  <p>Jacob Nadoway had provided his secretary with some excellent apartments
  leading out of the central hall and not far from his own. He had fitted up
  the suite with every elegant convenience, including an aunt. It was indeed
  doubtful, at times, whether the aunt was to be classed as a convenience or an
  inconvenience. She was supposed in a vague way to regularize the Victorian
  household and add even to the secretary an extra touch of gentility. But
  there was a difference, because the aunt, who was a Mrs. Milton-Mowbray, was
  given to suddenly getting back on the high-horse and then sliding off again,
  while her niece, with a more negative dignity, trod the dusty path of duty as
  a proud pedestrian. On this occasion Millicent Milton had been engaged all
  the evening in soothing her aunt, and after that experience, felt she would
  like to spend a little time in soothing herself. Instead of going to bed, she
  took up a book and began reading by the dying fire. She read on till it was
  very late, without realizing that everybody else had presumably retired to
  rest, when she heard in the utter stillness a new and unmistakable sound from
  the central hall without, which led into her employer's study. It was a sort
  of whirring and grinding sound, such as is produced by metal working its way
  into metal. And she remembered that in the angle between the two rooms stood
  the safe.</p>

  <p>She had the best sort of quite unconscious courage, and she simply walked
  out into the hall and looked. What she saw astounded her by being so
  ordinary. She had seen it in so many films and read about it in so many
  novels, that she could hardly believe that it really looked like that. The
  safe stood open and a shabby man was kneeling in front of it, with his back
  to her, so that she could see nothing but his shabbiness, his head being
  covered by a battered and shapeless broad-brimmed hat. On one side of him on
  the floor glittered the steel of a centre-bit and some other tools of his
  art; on the other side glittered even more brilliantly the silver and stones
  of some ornament, looking like a chain and clasp, presumably a portion of his
  spoils. There seemed somehow to be nothing sharp or unexpected about the
  experience; it was almost conventional, in being so like what it was supposed
  to be. She only spoke as she felt, in a tone entirely cold and commonplace,
  when she said: "What are you doing here?"</p>

  <p>"Well, I'm not climbing the Matterhorn or playing the trombone at
  present," grunted the man in a gruff and distant voice. "I suppose it's plain
  enough what I am doing."</p>

  <p>Then, after a silence, he resumed in a warning tone: "Don't you go saying
  that brooch thing there is yours, because it isn't. I didn't even get it out
  of this safe; let's say I lifted it off another family earlier in the
  evening. It's a pretty thing&mdash;sort of imitation fourteenth century, with
  <i>Amor Vincit Omnia</i> on it. It's all very well to say that love conquers
  everything, and force is no remedy and all that. But I've forced this safe: I
  never found a safe I could open by just loving what was inside."</p>

  <p>There was something rather paralysing about the way in which the burglar
  placidly went on talking without even looking round; and she thought it a
  little odd that he should know the meaning of the Latin inscription, simple
  as it was. Nor could she bring herself to scream or run or stop him in any
  way, when he went on with the same conversational composure.</p>

  <p>"Must be meant for a model of the big clasp that Chaucer's Prioress wore;
  that had the same motto on it. Don't you think Chaucer was a corker in the
  way he hit off social types&mdash;even social types that are there still?
  Why, the Prioress is an immortal portrait in a few lines of a most
  extraordinary creature called the English Lady. You can pick her out in
  foreign hotels and pensions. The Prioress was nicer than most of those, but
  she's got all the marks; fussing about her little dogs; being particular
  about table-manners; not liking mice killed; the whole darned thing even down
  to talking French, but talking it so that Frenchmen can't understand."</p>

  <p>He turned very slowly and stared at her.</p>

  <p>"Why, <i>you're</i> an English Lady!" he cried as if astonished. "Do you
  know they are getting rare?"</p>

  <p>Miss Millicent Milton probably did possess, like the Prioress of Chaucer,
  the more gracious virtues of the English Lady. But it must in honesty be
  admitted that she also possessed some of the vices of the type. One of the
  crimes of the English Lady is an unconscious class-consciousness. Nothing
  could alter the fact that, the moment the shabby criminal had begun to talk
  about English literature in the tones of her own class, her whole judgement
  was turned upside down, and she had a chaotic idea that he could not really
  be a criminal at all. In abstract logic, she would have been obliged to admit
  that it ought not to make any difference. In theory, she would concede that a
  student of medieval English has no more business to break open other people's
  safes than anybody else. In principle she might confess that a man does not
  purchase a right to steal silver brooches, even by showing an intelligent
  interest in the <i>Canterbury Tales</i>. But something of uncontrollable
  custom in her mind made her feel that the case was altered. Her feeling could
  only have been conveyed by the very vague colloquialisms which such people
  employ; as that he wasn't exactly a <i>real</i> burglar, or that it was
  "Quite Different", or that there was "some mistake". What she really meant
  (to the grave disadvantage of all her culture and her world) was that there
  were some people, criminals or no, whom she could see from the inside, and
  all other people she saw from the outside, whether they were burglars or
  bricklayers.</p>

  <p>The young man who was staring at her was dark, shaggy and unshaven, but
  the neglect of shaving had passed its most repellent stage of transition and
  might be regarded as a rather imperfect beard. Its patchiness reminded her of
  the quaintly divided beards of certain foreigners, and gave him something of
  the general look of a cultivated Italian organ-grinder. There was something
  else that was abnormal about his face, which she could not immediately
  define, but she thought it was the fact that his mouth was always twisting
  with mockery, rather as if it had taught itself always to mock, and yet his
  dark, sunken eyes were not only grave but in some sort of mad way,
  enthusiastic. If the grotesque beard could have completely covered the mouth
  like a mask, they might have been the eyes of a fanatic in the desert
  shouting a battle-cry of belief. He must be deeply indignant with society to
  have turned to this lawless life; or perhaps he had had a tragedy with a
  woman or something. She wondered what the real story was, and what the woman
  was like.</p>

  <p>While she was forming these confused impressions, the remarkable burglar
  went on talking; whatever else he felt, he seemed to feel no embarrassment
  about talking.</p>

  <p>"It's jolly fine of you to stand there like that&mdash;well, that's
  another trait. The English Lady is brave; Edith Cavell was a type of the
  tribe. But there are other tribes now, and that sort of brooch generally
  belongs to the last sort of person for whom it was made. That alone would be
  a justification for the trade of burglary, which keeps things briskly in
  circulation, doesn't allow them to stagnate in incongruous surroundings. If
  that brooch had really been worn by Chaucer's Prioress at the moment, you
  don't imagine I'd have taken it, do you? On the contrary, if I really met
  anybody as nice as the Prioress, I might be tempted to give it to her
  straight away, at the expense of my professional profits. But why should some
  vulgar cockatoo of a sham Countess own a thing like that? We want more theft,
  house-breaking and highway robbery to shift and rearrange the furniture of
  society; to regroup&mdash;if you follow me&mdash;its goods and chattels, as
  if after a spring-cleaning; to&mdash;"</p>

  <p>At this important point in the social programme, it was interrupted by a
  gasp and snort as startling as a trumpet-blast. And Millicent, looking
  across, saw her employer, the aged Nadoway, standing framed in the doorway,
  and looking a very small and shrunken figure in an enormous purple
  dressing-gown. It was not until that moment that she awoke to astonishment at
  her own silence and composure; or saw anything odd in the fact that she had
  stood listening to the criminal in front of the safe, as if he had been
  talking to her over the tea-table.</p>

  <p>"<i>What</i>! A burglar?" gasped Mr. Nadoway.</p>

  <p>Almost at the same moment there was a scurry of running and the big,
  breathless figure of the Junior Partner, John Nadoway, dressed in his shirt
  and trousers, also burst into the room, with a revolver in his hand. But he
  almost instantly lowered the weapon he had lifted and said, in the same
  incredulous and curiously emphatic voice: "Damn it all! A
  <i>burglar</i>!"</p>

  <p>The Rev. Norman Nadoway was not long behind his brother&mdash;he was
  respectably muffled in a greatcoat and looked very pale and solemn. But
  perhaps the most curious thing about him was that he also confined himself to
  saying, with the same inscrutable intensity: "A <i>burglar</i>!"</p>

  <p>Millicent thought there was, on the face of it, something singularly inept
  about this triple emphasis. It was about as obvious that the burglar was a
  burglar as that the safe was a safe. She could not imagine why the three men
  should all talk as if a burglar were a griffin, or something they had never
  heard of before, until it suddenly dawned on her that their surprise was not
  at a burglar paying them a particular visit, but rather at this particular
  visitor being a burglar.</p>

  <p>"Yes," said the visitor, looking round at them with a smile, "it's quite
  true I'm a burglar now. I think I was only a begging-letter writer when we
  last met. Thus do we rise on our dead selves to higher things; it was a very
  paltry little misdemeanour compared to this, wasn't it, for which father
  first turned me out?"</p>

  <p>"Alan," said Norman Nadoway very gravely, "why do you come back here like
  this? Why here, of all places?"</p>

  <p>"Why, to tell you the truth," said the other, "I thought that our
  respected Papa might want a little moral support."</p>

  <p>"What the devil do you mean?" asked John Nadoway irritably. "A nice sort
  of moral support you are!"</p>

  <p>"I am a very moral support," observed the stranger with proper pride.
  "Don't you realize it? I am the only real son and heir. I am the only man who
  is really carrying on the business. I am an example of atavism; I am a
  reversion to type."</p>

  <p>"I don't know what you're talking about," cried old Nadoway with sudden
  fury.</p>

  <p>"Jack and Norman know," said the burglar grimly. "They know what I'm
  talking about. They know what I mean when I say I'm the real representative
  of Nadoway and Son. It's the fact they've been trying to cover up, poor old
  chaps, for the last five or six years."</p>

  <p>"You were born to disgrace me," said the old man, trembling with anger;
  "you would have dragged my name in the dirt, if I hadn't sent you to
  Australia and got rid of you, and now you come back as a common thief."</p>

  <p>"And the real representative," said the other, "of the methods that made
  Nadoway's Nubs." Then he said with sudden scorn:</p>

  <p>"You say you're ashamed of me. Good Lord, my dear Dad! Haven't you
  discovered yet that both your other sons are ashamed of you? Look at their
  faces!"</p>

  <p>It was enough that the other two sons involuntarily turned their faces
  away, and even as it was, turned them too late.</p>

  <p>"They are ashamed of you. But I am not ashamed of you. We are the
  Adventurers of the family."</p>

  <p>Norman Nadoway raised a protesting hand, but the other went on with a
  sweep of spontaneous satire.</p>

  <p>"Do you think I don't know? Do you think everybody doesn't know? Don't I
  know that's why Norman and Jack are announcing new industrial methods and
  preaching new social ideals and all the rest? Cleansing the Name of
  Nadoway&mdash;because the Name of Nadoway stinks to the ends of the earth!
  Because the business was founded on every sort of swindling and sweating and
  grinding the faces of the poor and cheating the widow and orphan. And, above
  all, on robbery&mdash;on robbing rivals and partners and everybody else,
  exactly as I have robbed that safe!"</p>

  <p>"Do you think it decent," asked his brother angrily, "to come here and not
  only rob your father's safe, but insult and attack your father before his
  face?"</p>

  <p>"I am not attacking my father," said Alan Nadoway; "I am defending my
  father. And I am the only man here who can defend him. For I am a criminal,
  too."</p>

  <p>He let loose the next few words with an energy that made everybody jump.
  "What do you know about it? You go to college with his money; you get a
  partnership in his firm; you live on the money he made and are ashamed of the
  way he made it. But he didn't begin like that, any more than I did. He was
  thrown out into the gutter, just as I was thrown out into the gutter. You try
  it, and see what sort of dirt you will eat! You don't know anything about the
  way men are turned into criminals; the shifts and the delays and the despair,
  and the hopes that an honest job may turn up, that end by taking a dishonest
  one. You've no right to be so damned superior to the Two Thieves of the
  family."</p>

  <p>Old Nadoway made an abrupt movement, adjusting his spectacles, and
  Millicent, who was an acute observer, suspected that for one instant he was
  not only staggered but strongly moved.</p>

  <p>"All this," said John Nadoway after a silence, "doesn't explain what
  you're doing here. As you probably know, there's practically nothing in that
  safe, and the thing you've got there certainly doesn't come out of it. I
  can't quite make out what you're up to, in any case."</p>

  <p>"Well," said Alan, with his ironical smile, "you can examine the safe and
  the rest of the premises after I've gone. Perhaps you may make a few
  discoveries. And perhaps on the whole I&mdash;"</p>

  <p>In the middle of his words there arose, faint but shrill and unmistakable,
  upon Millicent's ear, the sound of something at once alarming and amusing;
  something she had been subconsciously expecting for a long time past. In the
  room beyond, her aunt had awakened; probably she had awakened to all the
  melodramatic possibilities of an interruption in the middle of the night. The
  Victorian tradition had still its living witness. Millicent herself had been
  frozen into a cool acceptance of the adventure&mdash;an acceptance she could
  not fully explain even to herself. But somebody at least had shrieked, in a
  respectable manner, on hearing a house-breaker.</p>

  <p>The five people looked at each other and realized that, after that shriek,
  the extraordinary family situation could no longer be kept in the family. The
  only chance was for the burglar to bolt with the promptitude of any other
  burglar. He turned and darted through the apartments on his left, which
  happened to be the apartments of Miss Milton and Mrs. Mowbray, so that shriek
  after shriek now rent the air. But a crash of glass from a remote window told
  the rest that the intruder had managed to burst out of the house and
  disappear in the darkness of the garden, and they all, for varied and rather
  complex reasons, heaved their separate sighs of relief.</p>

  <p>Millicent, needless to say, had to resume in a serious manner the duties
  of soothing an aunt; so that the shriek faded into shrill questions. Then she
  went into her own room, beyond which the hole in the burst window showed a
  black star in the slate-green of the glass. Then she realized that, right in
  the path of the disappearing robber, there was deliberately spread out for
  inspection, on her own dressing-table, as crown jewels are spread out upon
  velvet, the silver chain and studded clasp which had been fancifully
  dedicated to the Prioress, and on which was written in Latin "Love Conquers
  All".</p><hr><br>

  <h2><a name="c033"
     id="c033">III</a>. &mdash; A QUEER REFORMATION</h2>

<p class="first">Millicent Milton could not help wondering a good deal,
especially when
  walking about the garden in her off hours, whether she would ever see the
  burglar again. In the ordinary way, it would seem improbable. But then,
  nobody could say that this criminal was connected with the household in an
  ordinary way. As a burglar, he would presumably vanish; as a brother, he
  would not improbably turn up again. Especially as he was a rather
  disreputable brother, for they always turn up again. She tentatively asked
  questions of the other two brothers, but could get very little light on the
  situation. The acquisitive Alan had mockingly advised them to examine the
  house for the traces of his depredations. But he must have conducted them
  with great secrecy and selection, for nobody seemed sure of how much he had
  taken. It was one of the many problems in the story that she could not solve,
  and could not see any particular probability that she ever would solve, when
  she looked up idly and saw him standing quite calmly on the top of the garden
  wall and looking down into the garden. The wind plucked the plumes of his
  dark hair one by one and turned them over as he was turning the leaves of the
  tree nearest his perch.</p>

  <p>"Another way to burgle a house," he said, in a clear distant voice like a
  popular lecturer, "is to get over the garden wall. It sounds simple, but
  stealing things is generally simple. Only, in this case, I can't quite make
  up my mind what to steal.</p>

  <p>I think," he added calmly, "that I shall begin by stealing a little of
  your time. But don't be alarmed, in any secretarial sense. I assure you I
  have an appointment."</p>

  <p>He jumped from the wall and alighted on the turf beside her, but without
  in any way disturbing the flow of his remarks.</p>

  <p>"Yes; it is really true that I am summoned to quite a family council; an
  inquiry into the possibility of rehabilitating my affairs. But, thank God, I
  can't be rehabilitated for another hour or so. While I am still in a
  completely criminal state of mind, I should rather like to have a talk with
  you."</p>

  <p>She said nothing but gazed at the distant line of rather grotesque
  palm-trees planted as a frontier in the garden and felt returning upon her
  that irrational sense that this place had always been rather romantic, in
  spite of the people who lived in it.</p>

  <p>"I suppose you know," said Alan Nadoway, "that my father flew into a
  frightful rage with me when I was only eighteen, and flung me bodily all the
  way to Australia. Looking back on it now, I can see that there was something
  to be said for his business standards in the matter. I had given one of my
  boon companions a handful of money which I really regarded as my own, but
  which my father regarded rigidly as belonging to the firm. From his point of
  view, it was stealing. But I didn't really know much about stealing then,
  compared with the close and conscientious study I have given to it since. But
  what I want to tell you is what happened to me on my way back from
  Australia."</p>

  <p>"Wouldn't your family like to hear about it?" she could not help asking,
  with a touch of experimental irony.</p>

  <p>"I dare say they would," he said. "But I am not sure they'd understand the
  story, even if they did hear it." Then after a brief reflective silence he
  said:</p>

  <p>"You see, my story is too simple to be understood. Too simple to be
  believed. It sounds exactly like a parable; that is, it sounds like a fable
  and not a fact. There's my brother Norman now&mdash;he's a sincere man and
  very serious. He reads the parables in the New Testament every Sunday. But he
  could hardly believe in anything so simple as one of those parables, if it
  happened in real life."</p>

  <p>"Do you mean that you are the Prodigal Son?" she asked, "and he is the
  Elder Brother?"</p>

  <p>"Rather hard if the Australians had to be the Swine," said Alan Nadoway.
  "But I don't mean that at all. On the one hand, it underrates the magnanimity
  of my brother Norman. On the other hand, it perhaps slightly exaggerates the
  leaping and ecstatic hospitality of my father."</p>

  <p>She could not repress a smile, but, filled with the loftiest secretarial
  traditions, refrained from comment.</p>

  <p>"No; what I mean," he said, "is that stories told in that simple way, for
  the sake of illustration, always sound as if they weren't true. It's just the
  same with the parables of political economy. Norman has read a lot of
  political economy too, if you come to that. He must often have read those
  textbooks that begin with the statement: 'There is a man on an island.'
  Somehow the student or the schoolboy always feels inclined to say there never
  was any man on any island. All the same, there was."</p>

  <p>She began to feel a little bewildered. "Was what?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"There was me," said Alan. "You can't believe this story because there's a
  desert island in it. It's like telling a story with a dragon in it. All the
  same, there's a moral to the dragon."</p>

  <p>"Do you mean," she asked, growing rather impatient, "that you have been on
  a desert island?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, and on one or two other odd things. But the extraordinary thing was
  that everything was all right till I came to an inhabited island. Well, I
  spent several years, to start with, in a pretty uninhabited part of a more or
  less inhabited island. I mean, of course, the one marked on the map as
  Australia. I was trying to farm in a very remote part of the bush, till a run
  of bad luck forced me to crawl as best I could back to the towns. I was going
  to say back to civilization, but that sounds odd, if you know the towns. By
  the final stroke of luck my transport animals fell sick and died in a
  wilderness and I was left as if I had been on the other side of the moon.
  Nobody in these historical countries, of course, has an idea of what the
  earth is like, or how a great lot of it might just as well be the moon. There
  seemed no more chance of getting across those infinities of futile soil
  patched with wattle, than of persuading a comet that had knocked you into
  space to take you back home again. I trudged along quite senselessly, till I
  saw something like a tall blue bush that wasn't one of the monotonous mass of
  blue-grey bushes, and I saw it was smoke. It's a good proverb, by God, that
  where there's smoke there's fire. It's a greater proverb, and one too near to
  God to be written often, that where there's fire there's man, and nobody
  knows which is the greater miracle. Well, I found somebody; he wasn't anybody
  in particular; I dare say you would have found all sorts of deficiencies in
  him if he'd been in the village or the club. But he was a magician all right;
  to me he had powers not given to beast or bird or tree, and he gave me some
  cooked food and set me on the right road to a settlement. At the settlement,
  a little outpost in the wilds, it was the same. They didn't do much for me;
  they couldn't; but they did something and didn't think it particularly
  unusual to be asked. The long and short of it was that I got to a seaport at
  last and managed to make a bargain to work my passage with the master of a
  small craft. He wasn't a particularly nice man and I wasn't particularly
  comfortable, but it was not suicide but a sea-wave that swept me off suddenly
  one night, early enough to be seen and raise the cry of 'Man overboard!' That
  nasty little boat, with its still more nasty little captain, coasted about
  for four hours trying to pick me up, but it couldn't be done, and I was
  eventually picked up by a sort of native canoe, rowed by a sort of
  half-native lunatic who really and truly lived on a desert island. I hailed
  him as I had just been vainly hailing the ship, and he gave me brandy and
  shelter and the rest of it, as a matter of course. He was quite a character,
  a white man, or whitish man, who had gone fantee and wore nothing but a pair
  of spectacles and worshipped a god of his own he had made out of an old
  umbrella. But he didn't think it odd that I should ask him for help, and in
  his own way he gave it. Then came the day when we sighted a ship, very far
  out, but passing the island, and I hailed and hailed and waved long sheets
  and towels and lit flares and all the rest. And eventually the ship did alter
  her course and touched at the island to take us off; everybody was pretty dry
  and official, but they did it as a regular matter of duty. And all this time,
  and especially on that last stretch of homeward voyage, I was singing to
  myself a song as old as the world: <i>Coelum non animam</i>&mdash;By the
  waters of Babylon&mdash;or, in other words, of all things the worst is exile,
  and it will be well with a man in his own home. After all my wild hairbreadth
  escapes I stepped on to the dock in Liverpool, as a schoolboy enters his
  father's house on the first day of the Christmas holidays. I had forgotten
  that I had practically no money, and I asked a man to give or lend me some. I
  was immediately arrested for begging and began my career as a criminal by
  sleeping in jail.</p>

  <p>"Now I suppose you see the point of the economic parable. I had been in
  the ends of the earth, and among the scum of the earth; I had been among all
  sorts of ragamuffins who had very little to give and were often quite
  unwilling to give it. I had waved to passing ships and hallooed to passing
  travellers and doubtless been heartily cursed for doing so. But nobody ever
  thought it odd that I should <i>ask</i> for the help. Nobody certainly
  thought it criminal that I should shriek at a ship when I was drowning, or
  crawl towards a camp-fire when I was dying. In all those wild seas and waste
  places people did assume that they had to rescue the drowning and the dying.
  I was never actually <i>punished</i> for being in want till I came to a
  civilized city. I was never called a criminal for <i>asking</i> for sympathy,
  till I returned to my own home.</p>

  <p>"Well, if you have understood that parable of the New Prodigal Son, you
  may possibly understand why he thinks he found the Swine when he came home; a
  lot more Swine than Fatted Calves. The rest of the story consisted largely of
  assaults on the police, breaking and entering various premises and all the
  rest. My family has at last woken up to the fact that I might be reclaimed or
  my position regularized; chiefly, I imagine&mdash;in the case of some of them
  at least&mdash;because people like yourself and your aunt having been let
  into the secret is liable to be socially awkward. Anyhow, we are to meet here
  this afternoon and form a committee for turning me into a respectable
  character. But I don't think they quite realize the job they've taken on. I
  don't think they quite know what happens inside people like me; and it's
  because I rather want you to understand it, before they begin jabbering, that
  I've told you what I call the parable of the exile. Always remember that as
  long as he was among strangers, not to say scoundrels, he had a chance."</p>

  <p>They had been sitting on a garden seat during the conversation and
  Millicent rose from it, as she saw the black-clad group of the father and
  brothers approaching across the lawn.</p>

  <p>Alan Nadoway remained seated with somewhat ostentatious languor, and its
  significance was sharpened when she realized that old Jacob Nadoway was
  walking well ahead of the others and that his brows were black as a
  thunderstorm in the sunshine. It was instantly apparent that something new
  and nasty had occurred.</p>

  <p>"Perhaps it would be affectation to inform you," said the father with
  heavy bitterness, "that there has been another burglary in the
  neighbourhood."</p>

  <p>"Another?" said Alan, raising his eyebrows. "That, when you come to think
  of it, is a rather curious word. And what is the other?"</p>

  <p>"Mrs. Mowbray," said the father sternly, "went over yesterday to visit her
  friend, Lady Crayle. She was naturally disturbed about what had happened in
  our own house, and it seems that something happened about an hour earlier at
  the Crayles."</p>

  <p>"What did they lift off the Crayles?" asked the young man, with patient
  interest. "How did they know there was a burglary?"</p>

  <p>"The burglar was surprised and bolted," said Jacob Nadoway.
  "Unfortunately, he dropped something and left it behind in the haste of his
  flight."</p>

  <p>"Unfortunately!" repeated Alan with an air of being mildly and
  conventionally shocked. "Unfortunately for whom?"</p>

  <p>"Unfortunately for you," said his father. There was a painful silence and
  John Nadoway broke into it in his blundering but unconquerably good-humoured
  way.</p>

  <p>"Look here, Alan," he said. "If anybody is going to help you, these sort
  of games have got to stop. We could pass it off as a practical joke of a
  sort, when you did it to us, but even then you frightened Miss Milton, and
  Mrs. Mowbray is all up in the air. But how the devil are we to keep you out
  of the police-court if you break into the neighbours' houses and leave your
  cigar-case with a card inside?"</p>

  <p>"Careless&mdash;careless," said Alan in a vexed tone, rising with his
  hands in his pockets. "You must remember I am only at the beginning of my
  career as a burglar."</p>

  <p>"You are at the end of your career as a burglar," said old Nadoway, "or
  else at the beginning of your career as a convict for five years in Dartmoor.
  With that case and card, Lady Crayle can convict you, and will if I give the
  word. I've only come here to offer you a last chance, when you've thrown away
  a thousand chances. Drop this thieving business, here and now, and I'll find
  you a job. Take it or leave it."</p>

  <p>"Your father and I," said Norman Nadoway, in his detached and delicate
  accent, "have not always agreed about the treatment of hard cases. But he is
  obviously justified in this, I have a great deal of sympathy with you in many
  ways, but it is one thing to forgive a man thieving when he may be
  starving&mdash;it is quite another to forgive him, when he would rather go on
  starving, if only he may go on thieving."</p>

  <p>"That's the point," assented the stolid John in fraternal admiration.
  "We're willing to recognize a brother who isn't any longer a burglar. The
  only other thing we could recognize would be a burglar who isn't any longer a
  brother. Are you just Alan, to whom father's ready to give a job, or a fellow
  out of the street whom we have simply to hand over to the police? But, by
  God, you can't be both."</p>

  <p>Alan's eyes roamed round the family house and garden and rested for a
  moment on Millicent, with a certain expression of pathos. Then he sat down on
  the garden seat again, with his elbows on his knees and buried his head in
  his hands as if he were wrestling in prayer, or at least in perplexity of
  spirit. The three other men stood watching him with an awkward rigidity.</p>

  <p>At last he threw up his head again, flinging back his black, plume-like
  locks, and they all saw instantly that his pale face had a new
  expression.</p>

  <p>"Well," said old Jacob, not without a new note of appeal, "won't you give
  up all this blackguard burglary business?"</p>

  <p>Alan Nadoway rose. "Yes, father," he said gravely. "Now I come to look at
  it seriously, I see you have a right to my promise. I will give up the
  burglary business."</p>

  <p>"Thank God for that," said his brother Norman, his hard delicate voice
  shaken for the first time. "I'm not going to moralize now, but you'll find
  there is one thing about any other job you get; it will be one in which a man
  need not hide."</p>

  <p>"After all, it's a rotten job, burglary," said John with his jerky attempt
  at joviality and general reconciliation. "Must be a perfect nightmare always
  getting into the wrong house at the wrong end, something like putting on your
  trousers upside down. It'll pay you better really, and you'll get peace of
  mind."</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Alan thoughtfully; "all that you say is true, and there is a
  sort of hampering complication about the life; learning the whereabouts of
  treasures and so on. No, I am going to turn over a new leaf. I am going to
  reform and go into a different line of life altogether. A simpler, more
  straightforward line. I am told that picking pockets is much more lucrative
  nowadays."</p>

  <p>He continued to gaze thoughtfully at the distant palms, but all the other
  faces were turned towards him with an incredulous stare.</p>

  <p>"A friend of mine down Lambeth way," said Alan, "does most frightfully
  well with people coming out of tube stations and so on. Of course, they're
  much poorer than the people who own all these safes and jewels and things,
  but then there are a lot of them, and it's wonderful what you can collect by
  the end of the day. My friend got fifteen shillings in sixpences and coppers
  off people coming out of the cinema, but then he's awfully nifty with his
  fingers. I reckon I can learn the knack."</p>

  <p>There was a startled silence and then Norman said in a controlled
  voice:</p>

  <p>"It would be of some importance to me to know that this is a joke. I will
  risk my reputation for humour."</p>

  <p>"Joke," said Alan, with an absent-minded air. "Joke. . . . Oh, no, it
  isn't a joke. It's a job. And a jolly sight better job than any my father
  will offer me."</p>

  <p>"Then you can follow it to jail!" said the old man, and his voice rang out
  in the garden like a gun announcing sunset. "Clear out of this place in three
  minutes and I will not call the policeman down the road."</p>

  <p>And with that he turned his back and strode away followed by his other
  sons, and Alan remained standing alone by the garden seat, and he might have
  been a statue in the garden.</p>

  <p>The garden indeed had grown more still, and in a manner grey and
  statuesque, with the creeping advance of twilight, and something of its too
  florid character was veiled by dusk and damp vapours beginning to rise from
  the surrounding meadows, though overhead the sky was clear and beginning to
  show the points of stars in the general greyness. The points brightened and
  the dusk sank deeper and deeper, and it did not seem for the moment that the
  two human statues left in the garden would move. Then the woman moved very
  swiftly, walking straight across the lawn to where the man stood by the
  garden seat, and in that greater gravity and stillness he became conscious of
  the last incongruity. Her face, which was commonly very grave, was puckered
  with derision, like that of an elf.</p>

  <p>"Well," she said, "you've done it now."</p>

  <p>"If you mean," he answered, "that I've done for my prospects here, I never
  thought I had any."</p>

  <p>"No, I don't mean that," she said. "When I say you've done it, I mean
  you've overdone it."</p>

  <p>"Overdone what?" he asked in the same stony style.</p>

  <p>"Overdone the lie," she said, smiling steadily. "Overdressed the part, if
  you like. I don't understand what it all means, but it doesn't mean what it
  says, certainly not what you say. I could bring myself to believe that you
  were a burglar and broke into rich houses. But when you say you're a
  pickpocket who pinches sixpences off poor people coming out of the pictures,
  I simply know you're not, and there's an end of it. It's the last finishing
  touch that spoils a work of art."</p>

  <p>"What do you suppose I am?" he asked harshly.</p>

  <p>"Well, won't you tell me?" she inquired with a certain brightness.</p>

  <p>After a strained silence he said with a curious intonation, "I would do
  anything for you."</p>

  <p>"Well," she answered, "everybody knows that the curse of my sex is
  curiosity."</p>

  <p>He buried his head in his hands and after a silence said with a great
  groan: "<i>Amor Vincit Omnia</i>."</p>

  <p>A moment or two later he lifted his head again and began to talk, and her
  eyes grew starry with astonishment as she stood and listened under the
  stars.</p><hr><br>

  <h2><a name="c034"
     id="c034">IV</a>. &mdash; THE PROBLEMS OF DETECTIVE PRICE</h2>

<p class="first">Mr. Peter Price, the private inquiry agent, did not glow with
that
  historic appreciation of the type known as the English Lady which was such a
  credit to the heads and hearts of Mr. Geoffrey Chaucer and Mr. Alan Nadoway.
  The English Lady is a jewel of many facets, or even a flower including some
  botanical variations. And Mr. Price had seen, on many occasions, that face of
  the goddess which is turned upon foreign waiters, discontented cabmen, people
  who want windows shut or open at inappropriate times, and other manifest
  enemies of human society. And he was just recovering from an interview with a
  very pronounced specimen of the type, a certain Mrs. Milton-Mowbray, who had
  talked to him in clear and decisive tones for about three-quarters of an
  hour, without telling him anything of which he could make any sort of
  sense.</p>

  <p>So far as he could piece it out from his notes, it was something like
  this. She was sure there had been a burglary in Mr. Nadoway's house, where
  she and her niece were staying, and that they were keeping it from her, so
  that she might not find out she had been robbed. She was sure the burglary
  was at the Nadoways' house, because property belonging to young Mr. Nadoway
  had been found after a burglary at another house. The other house was Lady
  Crayle's house, and the burglar must have gone there from the Nadoways,
  taking the Nadoway things with him and then dropping them in his flight. As a
  matter of fact, he must have dropped something at the Nadoways too, as she
  was sure her niece had picked up a sort of brooch thing, that nobody had seen
  before. But her niece wouldn't say anything about it; they were all keeping
  things from her&mdash;that is, from the indignant Mrs. Milton-Mowbray.</p>

  <p>"He seems to be rather a careless burglar," Mr. Price had said, looking at
  the ceiling, "and not what you might call fortunate in his profession. First
  he steals something from somebody and leaves it at Mr. Nadoway's. Then he
  steals something from Mr. Nadoway and leaves it at Lady Crayle's. Did he
  actually steal anything from Lady Crayle? And at whose house did he leave
  that?"</p>

  <p>He was a short, fat, baldish man whose features seemed to fold in on
  themselves so that it was impossible to say for certain whether he smiled,
  but the lady at any rate was neither of the temper nor in the mood to search
  his face for irony.</p>

  <p>"That," she said triumphantly, "is just what I say! Nobody will tell me.
  Everybody is perfectly vague. Even Lady Crayle is vague. She says she
  supposes it must have been a burglary, or why should the man run away? And
  the Nadoways are vaguer still. I've told them again and again they needn't
  consider my feelings, I'm not going to faint, even if I have been robbed. But
  I really think I have a right to know."</p>

  <p>"Perhaps it would assist them a little," said the private detective, "if
  you first of all told <i>them</i> whether you had been robbed. You see, this
  seems to me a rather puzzling business in a good many ways, but what I'm
  trying to get at is what has been taken from whom. We'll grant, for the sake
  of argument, that there were two robberies. And we'll grant, for the sake of
  argument, that there was only one robber. It's presumed he was a robber,
  because he leaves about in other people's houses, things you think cannot
  have belonged to him. But none of these things, so far as I understand,
  belonged to any of the people he was then in the act of robbing. None of
  these things, for instance, belonged to you."</p>

  <p>"How can I tell?" she said with a sweeping gesture of agnosticism. "Nobody
  will tell me the truth. I am&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"My dear madam," said Mr. Price with belated firmness, "you cannot require
  anybody to tell you the truth about yourself. Have you lost anything
  yourself? Have you missed anything yourself? For that matter, has Lady Crayle
  missed anything herself?"</p>

  <p>"Lady Crayle wouldn't know whether she'd missed anything or not," said
  Mrs. Mowbray with sudden acrimony. "She's the very vaguest of the lot."</p>

  <p>"I see," said Mr. Price, nodding thoughtfully. "Lady Crayle wouldn't know
  whether she'd missed anything or not. And I rather gather that you yourself
  are in the same difficulty."</p>

  <p>Then, before she could realize the affront sufficiently to reply he said
  rapidly: "I always thought Lady Crayle was supposed to be very capable, a
  great organizer and all that."</p>

  <p>"Oh, she can organize meetings and movements and all that nonsense," said
  the Victorian lady scornfully. "Talk about her League Against Tobacco or her
  controversy about defining drugs, and she's all there. But she never notices
  anything that's lying about in her own house."</p>

  <p>"Does she notice her husband, for instance?" inquired Mr. Price. "Is he
  left lying about in the house much? I always understood he was a very
  distinguished man in his day, and, of course, it's an awfully old family. I'm
  told Lord Crayle suffered badly when the Russian debt was beyond recovery,
  and I don't suppose his wife gets a salary for attacking tobacco. So they
  must be pretty poor, and would surely know whether they've lost anything of
  great value."</p>

  <p>He was silent for a moment, ruminating and then said as suddenly as a
  pistol-shot:</p>

  <p>"What was it exactly they picked up after the burglar bolted?"</p>

  <p>"I believe it was nothing but cigars," replied Mrs. Mowbray shortly. "A
  whole big case stuffed with them. But as it had a card of one of the
  Nadoways, we presume the burglar had stolen it from their house."</p>

  <p>"Quite so," he answered. "And now about the other things he had stolen
  from their house. I am sure you understand that, if I am to help you, I must
  be excused for assuming a more or less confidential position. I gather that
  your niece has become the secretary of Mr. Jacob Nadoway. I think I may infer
  that her taking such a position implies to some extent the necessity of
  working for her living."</p>

  <p>"I was against her going to work for such people at all," said Mrs.
  Mowbray. "But when all these Socialistic Governments have taken away all our
  money, what can we do?"</p>

  <p>"I know&mdash;I know," said the detective, nodding in an almost dreamy
  fashion; his eyes were again fixed on the ceiling and he seemed to be
  following a train of thought thousands of miles away. At last he said:</p>

  <p>"We sometimes see these things in pictures that are quite impersonal. No
  personalities are intended. Let us suppose we are talking about nobody in
  particular. But the picture I see is that of a girl who once knew all about
  luxury and pretty things, who has accepted a duller and plainer life because
  there is nothing else to be done, and who earns her salary from a rather mean
  old man without expecting anything like a windfall. And then there's another
  curious picture. A man who's been an ordinary man of the world but driven to
  live the simple life, partly by poverty and partly by having a Puritanical
  wife with a fad against all his old luxuries and especially against tobacco.
  . . . Does that suggest anything to you?"</p>

  <p>"No, it doesn't," said Mrs. Mowbray, rising and rustling. "I consider all
  this most unsatisfactory, and I don't know what you're talking about."</p>

  <p>"He was really a very absent-minded housebreaker," said the detective. "If
  he had known what he was about, he would have dropped two brooches."</p>

  <p>Ten minutes later Mrs. Mowbray had shaken the dust of the very dusty
  detective office off her feet and gone on to pour out her woes elsewhere; and
  Mr. Peter Price went to the telephone with a smile that he seemed to be
  hiding even from himself. He rang up a certain friend of his in the official
  police department, and their conversation was long and detailed. It largely
  concerned the prevalence of petty crime, especially larceny, in some of the
  very poorest districts of London. And yet, oddly enough, Mr. Price added the
  notes of this telephone conversation to his notes of the conversation with
  the aristocratic Mrs. Milton-Mowbray.</p>

  <p>Then he once more leaned back in his chair and remained staring at the
  ceiling, plunged in profound thought and with an almost Napoleonic
  expression, for, after all, Napoleon also was short and in his later years
  fat, and in Mr. Peter Price also it is possible that there was more than met
  the eye.</p>

  <p>The truth was that Mr. Peter Price was awaiting another arrival, in
  accordance with another appointment. The two were not unconnected, though it
  would have surprised Mrs. Mowbray very much if she had seen a figure so
  familiar as that of Mr. John Nadoway, of Nadoway and Son, enter the
  detective's office so soon after she had left. But many years before, the
  Junior Partner had been put to considerable difficulties in covering up some
  of the early exploits of the Senior Partner. Long after the elder Nadoway had
  become rich, and the younger Nadoway had so tardily decided that he should
  also become respectable, there were old scandals trailing behind the business
  like a tradition of blackmail, and malcontents whom it was still rather
  difficult to quash. Young John Nadoway had betaken himself to the private
  agency and practical experience of Mr. Price, who had paid off or scared off
  the malcontents so successfully that the new reputation of Nadoways was
  fairly secure. To Mr. Price, therefore, young Nadoway once more betook
  himself, when faced with a family scandal on a far more ghastly and gigantic
  scale.</p>

  <p>For Alan Nadoway, no longer acting anonymously or even like a thief in the
  night, but announcing his name even more plainly than when he left his
  visiting-card, had declared that it was his intention to pick pockets for a
  living in the neighbourhood of Lambeth; and that if he were put into the dock
  and the police news, it would not be under an alias. In the curious
  communication he had sent his brother, he gravely declared that while there
  was obviously nothing morally wrong about picking pockets, he could not
  reconcile it with his conscience (perhaps, he admitted, a too sensitive
  conscience) to deceive a kind policeman by giving a false name. He had tried
  three times, he pathetically declared, to call himself Nogglewop and in each
  case his voice had failed through emotion.</p>

  <p>It was three or four days after the receipt of this letter that the
  thunderbolt fell. The Name of Nadoway, the subject of so many strivings,
  blazed in black and white in the headlines of all the evening papers; in a
  very different manner from that in which it blazed from so many of the
  parallel advertisements. Alan Nadoway, announcing himself as the eldest son
  of Sir Jacob Nadoway (for such was already the father's title), appeared in
  the police court, charged with picking pockets not only once but regularly
  and successfully for several weeks.</p>

  <p>The situation was the more sensationally insulting or exasperating,
  because the thief had not only robbed the poor in a most heartless and
  cynical fashion, but had selected the poor of the very district where his
  brother, the Rev. Norman Nadoway, had recently become a charitable and
  popular parish priest, abounding in every kind of good works.</p>

  <p>"It seems incredible," said John Nadoway with heavy emphasis, "that any
  man could be so wicked."</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Peter Price, a little sleepily; "it seems incredible." Then he
  got up with his hands in his pockets and looked out of the window and
  remarked: "You know, when you come to think of it, that's just the word for
  it. It seems incredible."</p>

  <p>"And yet it's happened," said John with a groan.</p>

  <p>Peter Price was silent so long that John suddenly jumped up as a man might
  on hearing a noise. "What the devil is the matter with you?" he asked. "Isn't
  it quite certain that it has happened?"</p>

  <p>Price nodded and answered: "If you say it has happened, yes, I am quite
  certain. But if you ask what has happened, I am not certain at all. Only I
  begin to have a large general sort of suspicion."</p>

  <p>Then after another silence he said abruptly: "Look here, I won't risk
  raising hopes or suspicions yet, but if you'll let me see the solicitor who's
  arranging the defence of your brother, I rather think I might have something
  to suggest to him."</p>

  <p>John Nadoway left the offices of the detective with a slow gait and a
  puzzled expression, which he continued to wear all the way down to his
  country house, which he reached that evening, driving his own car with his
  usual competence, but without any shedding of his unusual perplexity and
  gloom. Everything had grown so puzzling, as well as so painful, that he found
  himself forced against the edges of existence, in a manner rare in the
  experience of men of his type. He would have said in all simplicity that he
  was not a thinker, and he would have seen nothing unnatural in the notion of
  a man walking through life to death, without stopping anywhere to think. But
  everything, down to the demeanour of that practical little private detective,
  was so damned mysterious. Even the dark trees before his father's house
  seemed to stand up in serpentine shapes like enormous notes of interrogation.
  The stars looked like those other stars called asterisks, which stand in the
  suppressed passages of a puzzle or a cipher. And the single window lighted in
  the dark bulk of the house was like a leering eye. He knew only too well that
  a cloud of shame and doom was on that house, like a thunder-cloud about to
  burst. It was the sort of doom he had tried to avert all his life, and now it
  had come he could hardly even pretend it was not deserved.</p>

  <p>In the shadow of the veranda, with a sort of silent shock, he came upon
  Millicent, sitting in a garden chair and gazing out into the dark. And in all
  that black and tragic house of riddles, perhaps her face was the darkest and
  most inscrutable riddle, for it was happy.</p>

  <p>As she gazed, indeed, and became conscious of the sturdy figure of the
  businessman blackening the faint shimmer of light on the lawn, a sort of
  misty change came across her eyes, that was not pain but had in it something
  of pathos. She felt a sort of sad friendship go out in a sympathetic wave
  towards this strong, successful and unfortunate man&mdash;as towards
  something deaf or blind. She could not analyse the softening, which was also
  a severing, until she remembered that she had nearly been in love with him
  when he was a boy in that garden. She did not know why she should feel so
  sharply and almost tragically that she was not in love with him now. That she
  could never, never, be in love with that kind of man now. That kind of
  man&mdash;well, he was the kind of thoroughly good man who thought that
  telling the truth was as right as cleaning the teeth. It would be like loving
  somebody quite flat&mdash;only in two dimensions.</p>

  <p>For she felt that in herself a depth had opened like a new dimension, full
  of topsy-turvy stars and the inverted infinities of Einstein. She hardly
  looked into that abyss behind her, she hardly took in the positive novelty,
  but only the sharp negative, that she was not in love with John Nadoway.</p>

  <p>All the more her cold compassion went out to him, without shyness, as to a
  brother. "I am so sorry," she cried, "for all you must be suffering just now.
  It must seem so dreadful to you."</p>

  <p>"Thank you," he said, not without emotion. "We are having a trying time,
  of course&mdash;and sympathy from old friends does not hurt."</p>

  <p>"I know how good you have been," she said, "and how hard you worked to
  keep off anything like discredit. And this must seem to you so
  discreditable."</p>

  <p>The repetition of the one word "seem" at last penetrated his solid mind as
  a little queer.</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid it doesn't only seem so," he said, "a Nadoway picking pockets
  is about the worst one could imagine."</p>

  <p>"That is it," she said, nodding rather strangely. "Through the worst one
  could imagine comes the best one could not imagine."</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid I don't follow," said the Junior Partner.</p>

  <p>"You go through the worst to the best, as you go through the west to the
  east," she said, "and there really is a place, at the back of the world,
  where the east and the west are one. Can't you feel there is something so
  frightfully and frantically good that it <i>must</i> seem bad?"</p>

  <p>He stared at her blankly, and she went on as if thinking aloud.</p>

  <p>"A blaze in the sky makes a blot on the eyesight. And after all," she
  added, almost in a whisper, "the sun was blotted out, because one man was too
  good to live."</p>

  <p>The Junior Partner resumed his plodding march with the new addition to his
  list of worries; that among the inmates of the house, was a lady who was a
  lunatic.</p><hr><br>

  <h2><a name="c035"
     id="c035">V</a>. &mdash; THE THIEF ON TRIAL</h2>

<p class="first">There was an extraordinary amount of fuss and delay about the
hearing of
  the case of Alan Nadoway, considering that it was merely the trial of a
  common pickpocket. First of all, it was repeated everywhere, apparently on
  good authority, that the prisoner was going to plead Guilty. Then came all
  sorts of commotion in his original social circle, and a series of privileged
  interviews between the prisoner and members of his family. But it was not
  until his father, old Sir Jacob Nadoway, had sent his private secretary to
  the prison, apparently to conduct unprecedentedly long interviews with the
  prisoner, that the news went round that he was pleading Not Guilty after all.
  Then there was the same sort of rumour and dispute about his choice of a
  counsel, and finally it was announced that he had insisted on conducting his
  own defence.</p>

  <p>He had been committed for trial after purely formal evidence, and in his
  earlier stages of silence and surrender. It was before a judge and jury that
  the case against him was fully opened, and the prosecuting counsel opened it
  in tones of stern regret. The prisoner was unfortunately the son of a great
  and distinguished family, the blot on the escutcheon of a noble, a generous
  and a philanthropic house. All were acquainted with the great reforms in the
  conditions of employment which would always be associated with the name of
  his elder brother, Mr. John Nadoway. Many who could not approve the
  ritualistic practices, or submit their intellects to the ecclesiastical
  dogmas upheld by his other brother, the Rev. Norman Nadoway, had none the
  less respect for the solid social work and active charity of that clergyman
  among the poor. But, however it might be in other countries, the English law
  was no respecter of persons and was bound to follow crime even to its most
  respectable retreats. This unfortunate man, Alan Nadoway, had always been a
  ne'er-do-well and a burden and disgrace to his family. He had been suspected,
  and indeed convicted, of attempts at burglary in the houses of his family and
  friends.</p>

  <p>Here the judge intervened, saying: "That is a most improper remark. I find
  nothing about burglary in the indictment on which the prisoner is being
  tried." On this the prisoner remarked in a cheerful voice: "I don't mind, my
  lord." But nobody took the least notice of <i>him</i>, in the presence of a
  really improper legal procedure, and the judge and the barrister continued to
  look at each other with lugubrious countenances, until the barrister
  apologized and resumed. In any case, he said, there could be little doubt
  upon the charge of petty larceny, in face of the witnesses whom he intended
  to put in the box.</p>

  <p>Police-constable Brindle was sworn and gave his evidence in one long
  rippling monotone, without any apparent punctuation, as if it were not only
  all one sentence but all one word.</p>

  <p>"Acting on information received I followed the prisoner from the house of
  the Rev. Norman Nadoway towards the Yperion Cinema Theatre at about a hundred
  yards distant I saw the prisoner put his hand in the overcoat pocket of a man
  standing under a lamp-post after warning the man to examine his pockets I
  followed the prisoner who had joined the crowd outside the theatre a man in
  the crowd turned round and accused the prisoner of picking his pockets he
  offered to fight the prisoner and I came up to stop the fight I said do you
  charge this man and he said yes the prisoner said suppose I charge him with
  assault while I was questioning the other man the prisoner ran on and put his
  hand in the tail-coat pocket of a man in the queue. I then told this man to
  examine his pockets and took the prisoner into custody."</p>

  <p>"Do you wish to cross-examine this witness?" asked the judge.</p>

  <p>"I am sure your lordship will pardon me in the circumstances," said the
  prisoner, "If I am not well acquainted with the forms of this court. But may
  I at this stage ask whether the prosecution is going to call these three
  persons whom I am supposed to have robbed?"</p>

  <p>"I have no objection to stating," said the prosecuting counsel, "that we
  are calling Harry Hamble, bookmaker's clerk, the man who is said to have
  threatened to fight the prisoner, and Isidor Green, music-teacher, the last
  man robbed by the prisoner before his arrest."</p>

  <p>"And what about the first man?" asked the prisoner. "Why isn't he being
  called?"</p>

  <p>"As a matter of fact, my lord," said the counsel, "the police have been
  unable to discover his name and address."</p>

  <p>"May I ask the witness," said Alan Nadoway, "how this curious state of
  things came about?"</p>

  <p>"Well," said the constable, "the fact is that as soon as I'd turned my
  back on him for a minute, he was gone."</p>

  <p>"Do you mean to say," asked Nadoway, "that you told a man he was the
  victim of theft and might recover his money, and he instantly bolted without
  leaving his name, as if he were a thief himself?"</p>

  <p>"Well, I don't understand it, and that's flat," said the policeman.</p>

  <p>"Under your lordship's indulgence," said the prisoner, "there is another
  point. While two names figure as witnesses, only one name, that of Mr.
  Hamble, appears as prosecuting. It looks as if there was something vague
  about the third witness, too. Did you think so, constable?"</p>

  <p>Outside the inhuman hurdy-gurdy of his official evidence, the policeman
  was a human being and capable of being amused.</p>

  <p>"Well, I must say he was vague enough," he admitted with a faint grin.
  "He's one of these artistic musical chaps, and his notions of counting money
  is something chronic. I told him to look if he'd lost any and he added it up
  six times. And sometimes it was 2s. 8d. and sometimes it was 3s. 4d. and
  sometimes it got as far as 4s. So we thought he wasn't quite enough on the
  spot. . . ."</p>

  <p>"This is most irregular," said the judge. "I understand that the witness,
  Isidor Green, is to give his own evidence later. The prosecution had better
  begin calling their witnesses as soon as possible."</p>

  <p>Mr. Harry Hamble wore a very sporting tie and that expression of demure
  joviality which is seen in those who value their respectability even in the
  Saloon Bar. He was not incapable, however, of hearty outbursts, and he
  admitted that he had punched the head of the fellow who tried to pick his
  pocket. In answer to the prosecution, he told the story very much as the
  policeman had done, not without a gentle exaggeration of his own pugnacity.
  In answer to the prisoner, he admitted that he had immediately adjourned to
  the Pig and Whistle at the corner.</p>

  <p>The prosecuting counsel, springing up with theatrical indignation,
  demanded the meaning of this insinuation.</p>

  <p>"I imagine," said the judge somewhat severely, "that the prisoner implies
  that the witness did not know exactly what he had lost."</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Alan Nadoway, and there was something odd and arresting in the
  roll of his deep voice; "I do mean to imply that he did not know exactly what
  he had lost."</p>

  <p>Then, turning to the witness, he said briskly: "Did you go to the Pig and
  Whistle and stand drinks all round, in a regular festive style?"</p>

  <p>"My lord," exploded the prosecuting counsel, "I must emphatically protest
  against the prisoner wantonly aspersing the character of the witness."</p>

  <p>"Aspersing his character! Why, I am glorifying his character!" cried
  Nadoway warmly. "I am exalting and almost deifying his character! I am
  pointing out that he exercised on a noble scale the ancient virtue of
  hospitality. If I say you give very good dinners, am I aspersing your
  character? If you ask six other barristers to lunch, and do them well, do you
  conceal it like a crime? Are you ashamed of your handsome hospitality, Mr.
  Hamble? Are you a miser and a man-hater?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, no, sir," said Mr. Hamble, who appeared slightly dazed.</p>

  <p>"Are you an enemy of the human race, Mr. Hamble?"</p>

  <p>"Well, no, sir," said Mr. Hamble, almost modestly. "No, certainly not,
  sir," he added more firmly.</p>

  <p>"You always, I take it," went on the prisoner, "feel friendly to your
  fellow-creatures, and especially your chosen companions. You would always do
  them a good turn or stand them a drink, if you could."</p>

  <p>"I hope so, sir," said the virtuous bookmaker.</p>

  <p>"You do not always do it, of course," went on Alan smoothly, "because you
  are not always in a position to do so. Why did you do so on this
  occasion?"</p>

  <p>"Well," admitted Mr. Hamble, a little puzzled, "I suppose I must have been
  rather flush that evening."</p>

  <p>"Immediately after being robbed?" said Nadoway. "Thank you, that is all I
  want to ask."</p>

  <p>Mr. Isidor Green, professional teacher of the violin, with long, stringy
  hair and a coat faded to bottle-green, was certainly as vague as the
  policeman had represented him. During the examination in chief, he got
  through well enough by saying that he certainly had a sort of feeling as if
  his pockets were being rifled; but even under Nadoway's comparatively gentle
  and sympathetic cross examination he became extraordinarily hazy. It seemed
  that he had eventually, with the assistance of two or three friends of
  superlative mathematical talent, reached the firm conclusion that he still
  possessed 4s. 7d. after he had been robbed. But the light thus thrown upon
  the robbery was a little dimmed by the fact that he had then realized, for
  the first time, that he had never had any notion of what he possessed before
  he was robbed.</p>

  <p>"My thoughts are considerably concentrated on my artistic work," he said,
  with not a little dignity. "It is possible that my wife might know."</p>

  <p>"An admirable idea, Mr. Green," said Alan Nadoway heartily. "As a matter
  of fact, I am calling your wife as a witness for the defence."</p>

  <p>Everybody stared, but it was plain that Nadoway was serious, and with a
  gravity tinged with courtliness he proceeded to summon his own witnesses, who
  actually were no other than the two wives of the two witnesses for the
  prosecution.</p>

  <p>The wife of the violinist was a straightforward and, save for one point, a
  simple bearer of testimony. She was a solid, jolly looking woman, like a
  superior cook; probably just the right woman to look after the unmathematical
  Mr. Green. She said in a comfortable voice that she knew all about Isidor's
  money&mdash;what there was of it; that he was a good husband with no
  extravagant tastes and had certainly had 2s. 8d. in his pocket that
  afternoon.</p>

  <p>"In that case, Mrs. Green," said Alan, "it would seem that your husband's
  taste in mathematical friends is as eccentric as his taste in mathematics. He
  and his friends finally added it up and brought it out as 4s. 7d."</p>

  <p>"Well, he's a genius," she said with some pride. "He could bring out
  anythink as anythink."</p>

  <p>Mrs. Harry Hamble was a very different type; and, by comparison with Mr.
  Harry Hamble, a somewhat depressing one. She had the long, sallow features
  and sour mouth not unknown in the wives of those who find refuge in the Pig
  and Whistle. Asked by Nadoway whether the date in question counted for
  anything in her domestic memories, she answered grimly: "It orter 'ave if
  'e'd told me. 'E must 'ave 'ad a raise in wages and not told me."</p>

  <p>"I understand," Nadoway asked, "that he treated several of his friends to
  drinks that afternoon?"</p>

  <p>"Treated!" cried the amiable lady, in a withering voice. "Treated to
  drinks! Cadged for drinks, more likely! 'E got all the drinks 'e could for
  nothink, I daresay. But 'e didn't pay for nobody else's."</p>

  <p>"And how do you know that?" asked the prisoner.</p>

  <p>"'Cos he brought back his usual wages and a bit more," said Mrs. Hamble,
  as if this alone were a sufficient grievance.</p>

  <p>"This is all very puzzling," said the judge and leaned back in his
  chair.</p>

  <p>"I think I can explain it," said Alan Nadoway, "if your lordship will
  allow me to go into the box for two minutes, before I wind up for the
  defence."</p>

  <p>There was no official difficulty, of course, about the prisoner appearing
  in both capacities.</p>

  <p>Alan Nadoway took the oath and stood gazing at the prosecuting counsel
  with gloomy composure.</p>

  <p>"Do you deny," asked the barrister, "that you were caught by the policeman
  with your hand in the pockets of these people?"</p>

  <p>"No," said Nadoway, mournfully shaking his head. "Oh, no."</p>

  <p>"This is very extraordinary," said the examiner. "I understood that you
  were pleading Not Guilty."</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Nadoway sadly. "Oh, yes."</p>

  <p>"What on earth does all this mean?" said the judge in sudden
  irritation.</p>

  <p>"My lord," said Alan Nadoway, "I can put it all straight in five words.
  Only in this court one can't put things straight; one has to do what you call
  prove them. Well, it's all simple enough. I did put my hands in their
  pockets. Only I put money in their pockets, instead of taking it out. And if
  you look at it, you'll see that explains everything."</p>

  <p>"But why in the world should you do such a crazy thing?" asked the
  judge.</p>

  <p>"Ah," said Nadoway; "I'm afraid that would take longer to explain, and
  perhaps this isn't the best place to explain it."</p>

  <p>The explanation of the practical problem was indeed set forth in further
  detail, in the final speech which the prisoner made in his own defence. He
  pointed out the obvious solution of the first problem; the abrupt
  disappearance of the first victim. He, that nameless economist, was a much
  shrewder person than the festive Mr. Hamble or the artistic Mr. Green. One
  glance at his pockets had shown him that he had got somebody else's money in
  addition to his own. A dark familiarity with the police led him to doubt
  strongly whether he would ultimately be allowed to keep it. He had therefore
  vanished with the presence of mind of a magician or a fairy. Mr. Hamble, in a
  hazier state of conviviality, had been mildly surprised at finding more and
  more pocket-money flowing from his pockets, and, to his everlasting credit,
  had dedicated it largely to the entertainment of his friends. But even after
  that, there was a little more than his normal salary left, to raise sinister
  doubts in the mind of his wife. Lastly, incredible as it may seem, Mr. Green
  and his friends did eventually arrive at a correct calculation of the number
  of coins in his pocket. And if it was in excess of his wife's estimate, it
  was for the simple reason that more coins had been added, since she sent him
  out, carefully brushed and buttoned up, in the morning. Everything, in fact,
  supported the prisoner's strange contention&mdash;that he had filled pockets
  and not emptied them.</p>

  <p>Amid a dazed silence, the judge could only find it possible to charge the
  jury to acquit, and the jury acquitted. But Mr. Alan Nadoway made a very
  rapid dart out of court, eluding journalists and friends and especially his
  family. For one thing, he had seen two pinch-faced men with spectacles, who
  looked as if they might be psychologists.</p><hr><br>

  <h2><a name="c036"
     id="c036">VI</a>. &mdash; THE CLEANSING OF THE NAME</h2>

<p class="first">The trial and acquittal of Alan Nadoway in a court of law was
only an
  epilogue to the real drama. He would perhaps have said that it was only a
  harlequinade at the end of the fairy play. The real concluding scene and
  curtain had taken place on that green stage of "The Lawns", which Millicent,
  oddly enough, had always felt to be like a sort of stage scenery, stiff and
  yet extravagant, with the jagged outlines of the foreign plants like the jaws
  of sharks and the low line of bow windows like the motor-goggles of a
  monster. With all its grotesqueness there had always mingled in her mind
  something almost operatic and yet genuine; something of real sentiment or
  passion that there was in the Victorian nineteenth century, despite all that
  is said of Victorian primness and restraint. It was that essentially
  innocent, that faulty but not cynical thing, the Romantic Movement. The man
  standing before her, with his quaint and foreign half-beard, had about him
  something indescribable that belonged to Alfred de Musset or to Chopin. She
  did not know in what sort of harmony these fanciful thoughts were mingling,
  but she knew that the music was like an old tune.</p>

  <p>She had just said the words: "I cannot bear the silence, because it is
  unjust. It is unjust to you."</p>

  <p>And he had answered: "It is because it is unjust to me that it is just.
  That is the whole story; though I suppose you would call it a strange
  story."</p>

  <p>"I do not mind your talking in riddles," answered Millicent Milton
  steadily, "but I want you to understand something more. It is unjust to
  me."</p>

  <p>After a silence he said in a low voice: "Yes; that is what has got me.
  That is what has broken me across. I've come up against something bigger than
  the whole plan I made for my life. Well, I suppose I shall have to tell you
  my story."</p>

  <p>"I thought," she said with a faint smile, "that you had already told me
  your story."</p>

  <p>"Yes," replied Alan; "I told you my story all right. All quite true, with
  nothing but the important things left out."</p>

  <p>"Well," said Millicent, "I should certainly like to hear it with the
  important things put in."</p>

  <p>"The difficulty is," he said, "that the important things can't be
  described. The words all go wrong when you describe such things. They were
  bigger than shipwrecks or desert islands, but they all happened inside my
  head."</p>

  <p>After a silence he resumed, more slowly, like a man trying to find new
  words.</p>

  <p>"When I was drowning in the Pacific, I think I had a Vision. I rose for
  the third time to the top of a great wave and I saw a Vision. I think that
  what I saw was Religion."</p>

  <p>Something in the involuntary mental movements of the English Lady was
  halted and almost chilled. She felt faintly antagonistic to some
  associations, she hardly knew what. She was herself reverently, if rather
  vaguely, attached to a High Church tradition, but she only half realized the
  prejudice that had stirred in her. Men who come from the colonies and the
  ends of the earth, and say they have got religion, almost always mean that
  they have "found Jesus" or been to a revivalist meeting somewhere; and the
  whole thing seemed socially incongruous with his culture and hers. It was not
  in the least like Alfred de Musset.</p>

  <p>With the uncanny clairvoyance of the mystic he seemed to seize on her
  passing doubt and said cheerfully:</p>

  <p>"Oh, I don't mean that I met a Baptist missionary. There are two kinds of
  missionaries: the right kind and the wrong kind, and they're both wrong. At
  least they're both wrong as to the thing I am thinking about. The stupid
  missionaries say the savages grovel in the mud before mud idols, and will all
  go to hell for idolatry unless they turn teetotallers and wear billycock
  hats. The intelligent missionaries say the savages have great possibilities
  and often quite a high moral code, which is quite true, but isn't the point.
  What they don't see is that very often the savages have really got hold of
  religion, and that lots of people with a high moral code don't know what
  religion means. They would run screaming with terror, if they got so much as
  a glimpse of Religion. It's an awful thing.</p>

  <p>"I learnt something about it from the lunatic with whom I lived on the
  desert island. I told you he had practically gone mad, as well as gone
  native. But there was something to learn from him, that can't be learnt from
  ethical societies and popular preachers. The poor fellow had floated to shore
  by hanging on to a queer, old-fashioned umbrella, that happened to have the
  head carved in a grotesque face, and when he came raving out of his delirium,
  so far as he ever came out of it, he regarded the umbrella as the god that
  had saved him, and stuck it up in a sort of shrine and grovelled before it
  and offered it sacrifices. That's the point. . . . Sacrifices. When he was
  hungry he would burn some of his food before it. When he was thirsty, he
  would still pour out some of the native beer that he brewed. I believe he
  might have sacrificed me to his idol. I'm sure he would have sacrificed
  himself. I don't mean"&mdash;he spoke more slowly still and very
  thoughtfully&mdash;"I don't exactly mean that the cannibals are right, or
  human sacrifice or all that. They're wrong&mdash;if you come to think of
  it&mdash;they're <i>really</i> wrong, because people don't want to be eaten.
  But if I <i>want</i> to be sacrificed who is going to stop me? Nobody, not
  God himself, will stop me, if I want to suffer injustice. To forbid me to
  suffer injustice would be the greatest injustice of all."</p>

  <p>"You are rather disconnected," she said, "but I begin to have a glimmering
  of what you mean. I presume you don't mean that you saw from the top of the
  wave the vision of the divine umbrella."</p>

  <p>"And do you think," he asked, "that what I saw was a picture of angels
  playing harps out of the Family Bible? What I saw, so far as I can be said to
  have merely <i>seen</i> anything, was my father sitting at the head of the
  table, in some great dinner or directors' meeting, and perhaps everybody
  drinking his health in champagne, while he sat gravely smiling, with his
  glass of water beside him, because he is a strict temperance man. Oh, my
  God!"</p>

  <p>"Well," said Millicent, the smile rising slowly to the surface again; "it
  certainly seems rather different from heaven and the harps."</p>

  <p>"But I," went on Alan, "was lost like loose seaweed and sinking like a
  stone, to be forgotten in the slime under the sea."</p>

  <p>"It was horribly hard," she said in a trembling voice.</p>

  <p>To her surprise he answered with a rather jarring laugh.</p>

  <p>"Do you think I mean that I envied him?" he cried. "That would be a rum
  way of realizing religion. It was all the other way. From the top of the wave
  I looked down and saw him with a clear horror of pity. From the top of the
  wave I prayed, for one passionate instant, that my miserable death might
  avail to deliver him from that hell.</p>

  <p>"Horrible hospitality, horrible courtesy, horrible compliments and
  congratulations, praise and publicity and popularity of the old firm, the old
  sound business traditions, and the sun of success high in heaven and
  glittering everywhere on one great ghastly whited sepulchre of human
  hypocrisy. And I knew that within, it was full of dead men's bones, of men
  who had died of drink or starvation or despair, in prisons and workhouses and
  asylums, because this hateful thing had ruined a hundred businesses to build
  one. Horrible robbery, horrible tyranny, horrible triumph. And most horrible
  of all, to add to all the horrors, that I loved my father.</p>

  <p>"He had been good to me when I was little, and when he was poorer and
  simpler, and as a boy I began by making hero-worship of his success. The
  first great coloured advertisements were to me what coloured toy-books are to
  other children. They were a fairy tale, but, alas, the one fairy tale one
  could not continue to believe. So there I was, feeling what I felt and yet
  knowing what I knew. You have to love as I loved and hate as I hated, before
  you see afar off the thing called Religion, and the other name of it is Human
  Sacrifice."</p>

  <p>"But surely," said Millicent, "things are ever so much better with the
  business now."</p>

  <p>"Yes," he said, "things are better and that is what makes it worse. That
  is the worst of all."</p>

  <p>He paused a moment and went on in a lower key:</p>

  <p>"Jack and Norman are good fellows, as good as they can be," he said; "they
  have done their best, but for what? Their best to make the best of it. To
  cover it up. To put a new coat of whitewash on the whited sepulchre. Things
  are to be forgotten, things are to be dropped out of conversation, things are
  to be <i>thought</i> better of&mdash;more charitably&mdash;after all it's an
  old story now. But that's nothing to do with what things <i>are</i>, in the
  world where things are, and always are; in the world of heaven and hell.
  Nobody has apologized. Nobody has confessed. Nobody has done penance. And in
  that moment, from the top of the wave, I cried to God that I might do
  penance, if it were only by dying in the sea. . . . Oh, don't you understand?
  Don't you understand how shallow all these moderns are, when they tell you
  there is no such thing as Atonement or Expiation, when that is the one thing
  for which the whole heart is sick before the sins of the world? The whole
  universe was wrong, while the lie of my father flourished like the green
  bay-tree. It was not respectability that could redeem it. It was religion,
  expiation, sacrifice, suffering. Somebody must be terribly good, to balance
  what was so bad. Somebody must be <i>needlessly</i> good, to weigh down the
  scales of that judgement. He was cruel and got credit for it. Somebody else
  must be kind and get no credit for it. Don't you understand?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, I begin to understand," she said. "I think you are rather
  incredible."</p>

  <p>"I swore in that moment," said Alan, "that I would be called everything
  that he ought to be called. I would have the name of a thief, because he
  deserved it. I would be despised and rejected and perhaps go to jail, because
  I chose after that fashion to <i>be</i> my father. Yes, I would inherit. I
  would be his heir."</p>

  <p>He spoke the last words upon a note that shook her out of her statuesque
  stillness, and she came towards him with an unconscious movement, crying:</p>

  <p>"You are the most wonderful and amazing man in the world&mdash;to have
  done such a stupendously stupid thing."</p>

  <p>He caught her as she came forward, with an abrupt and crushing compression
  of the hands, and then answered:</p>

  <p>"You are the most wonderful and amazing woman in the world, to have
  stopped me doing it."</p>

  <p>"And that seems terrible, too," she said. "I don't want to feel that I
  smashed such a magnificent mad thing; perhaps I was wrong after all. But
  don't you think yourself it was getting impossible&mdash;in other ways."</p>

  <p>He nodded gravely, continuing to gaze into her eyes, which no one now
  would have thought languid and proud. "You know the story from the inside by
  this time. I began as a burglar of the Santa Claus sort, breaking into houses
  and leaving presents in safes and cupboards. I was sorry for old Crayle,
  whose confounded prig of a wife would not let him smoke, so I chucked him
  some cigars. But I'm not sure even there I may not have done more harm than
  good. Then I thought I was only sorry for you. I should be sorry for anybody
  who was secretary in our family."</p>

  <p>She laughed on a low and tremulous note. "And so you chucked me a silver
  clasp and chain to cheer me up."</p>

  <p>"But in that case," he said, "the clasp caught and held."</p>

  <p>"It also scratched my aunt a bit," she said. "And altogether, it did make
  complications, didn't it? And all that business of the poor people's
  pockets&mdash;well, somehow I couldn't help feeling it might get them as well
  as you into trouble."</p>

  <p>"The poor people are always in trouble," he said gloomily. "They're all
  what you call known to the police. It was perfectly genuine, when I told you
  how it riles me that they aren't even allowed to beg, and that's why I
  started giving them alms before they started begging. But it's quite true
  that it couldn't have been kept up for long. And that has taught me another
  lesson as well, and I understand something in human life and history I never
  understood before. Why the people who do have those wild visions and vows,
  who want to expiate and to pray for this wicked world, can't really do it
  anyhow and all over the place. They have to live by rule. They have to go
  into monasteries and places; it's only fair on the rest of the world. But
  henceforward, when I see these great prisons of prayer and solitude, or have
  a glimpse of their cold corridors and bare cells, I shall understand. I shall
  know that in the heart of that rule and routine there is the wildest freedom
  of the will of man; a whirlwind of liberty."</p>

  <p>"Alan, you frighten me again," she said, "as if you yourself were
  something strange and solitary, as if you also. . . ."</p>

  <p>He shook his head, with a complete understanding. "No," he said; "I've
  found out all about myself as well. A good many people make that mistake
  about themselves when they're young. But a man is either of that sort or the
  other sort, and I'm the other sort. Do you remember when we first met and
  talked about Chaucer and the chain with <i>Amor Vincit</i>?"</p>

  <p>And without moving his eyes or hands from where they rested, he repeated
  the opening words of Theseus in the Knight's Tale about the sacrament of
  marriage, and as he spoke those noble words as if they were a living
  language, I will so write them here, to the distress of literary
  commentators:</p>

  <p> </p>

  <blockquote>
    ". . . The first Mover of the Cause above<br>
    When he first made the fair chain of love<br>
    Great was the effect and high was his intent:<br>
    Well wist he why, and what thereof he meant."
  </blockquote>

  <p> </p>

  <p>And then he bent swiftly towards her; and she understood why that garden
  had always seemed to hold a secret and to be waiting for a surprise.</p>

     id="c04">THE LOYAL TRAITOR</a></h2>

  <h2><a name="c041"
     id="c041">I</a>. &mdash; THE MENACE OF THE WORD</h2>

<p class="first">It will be best, both for the reader and the writer, not to
bother about
  what particular country was the scene of this extraordinary incident. It may
  well be left vague, so long as it is firmly stipulated that it was not in the
  Balkans, where so many romancers have rushed to stake out claims ever since
  Mr. Anthony Hope effected his <i>coup d'état</i> in Ruritania. The Balkan
  kingdom is convenient because kings are killed and despotic governments
  overthrown with pleasing swiftness and frequency, and the crown may fall to
  any adventurer, good or bad. But meanwhile, in the same Balkan State, the
  farms remain in the same families, the plot of land, the orchard or the
  vineyard, descends from father to son; the rude equality of peasant
  proprietorship has never been greatly disturbed by large financial
  operations. In short, in the Balkan kingdom there is some safety and
  continuity for the Family, so long as it is not the Royal Family.</p>

  <p>But with the kingdom in question here, how different! Whatever name we may
  give it, it was at least a highly-civilized and well-ordered society, in
  which the Royal Family continued serene and safe under police protection and
  constitutional limitations; in which all the public services were conducted
  with a regularity verging on tedium, and in which nobody was ever ruined or
  overthrown except the butcher, the baker, the candle-stick-maker and the
  various types of tradesmen and common citizens who might happen to cross the
  path of large commercial operations. The country might well be one of the
  smaller German States that have been industrialized by dependence on mines
  and factories, or one of the former dependencies of the Austrian Empire. It
  does not matter; it is enough to secure the reader's respect and interest to
  know that it was a thoroughly modern and enlightened community, which had
  advanced in every science and perfected every social convenience until it was
  within reasonable distance of revolution; not a potty little palace
  revolution, in which a few princes are murdered, but a real, international,
  universal social revolution; probably beginning with a General Strike and
  probably ending with bankruptcy and famine.</p>

  <p>It was all the more possible, because breezy events of this sort had
  already broken out in a neighbouring industrial state, and after some months
  of very bewildering civil war, had ended in the victory of one out of the six
  revolutionary generals fighting each other in the field; the victor being a
  certain General Casc, an able soldier who had originally come with the
  Colonial troops garrisoned in the neighbourhood, and who was credited in
  local gossip with being partly a negro, a fact which considerably consoled
  those who had been defeated by him. For our own territory, which we will call
  Pavonia, he was only of importance&mdash;as an unluckily lucky example.</p>

  <p>The public crisis became acute in Pavonia with the appearance of the
  rather mysterious agitation about "The Word". To this day there are disputes
  about the nature of the movement. Some of the government agents and inquirers
  swore the ignorant populace did really believe that, with the discovery of a
  new Word, everything in the world would be explained. A wild pamphlet did
  actually appear, in which the writer argued with insane ingenuity that, as
  all modern publicity and popularization consist of concentrating a book into
  a paragraph, or a chapter into a sentence, so at last the whole truth about
  the present problem would be concentrated into a word. Crowds of impatient
  malcontents were adjured to Wait for the Word; and apocalyptic visions were
  provided, of the scenes of world-change that would follow, when once The Word
  was spoken. The Word would contain in itself, it was gravely asserted, a
  complete plan of operations and an explanation of the whole organized
  strategy of the revolt. Some said the whole fancy had originated with one
  Bohemian poet, who signed his poems, "Sebastian", and had certainly composed
  a lyric invocation full of allusions to The Word. Many repeated the lines
  which ran:</p>

  <p> </p>

  <blockquote>
    As Aaron's serpent swallowed snakes and rods,<br>
    As God alone is greater than the gods,<br>
    As all stars shrivel in the single sun,<br>
    The words are many, but The Word is one.
  </blockquote>

  <p> </p>

  <p>But nobody in office ever saw the revolutionary poet who tossed these
  little trifles at the Government and the public; until he was identified one
  day in the street by the very last person who was likely to meet him.</p>

  <p>The Princess Aurelia Augusta Augustina, etc. etc. (who had embedded
  somewhere in her stratified Christian names the name of Mary, by which she
  was called for convenience by her family), was the niece of the reigning
  monarch, and, having only just left school, did not as yet fully appreciate
  the difference between reigning and ruling. She was a vigorous young woman
  with red hair and a Roman nose, and having as yet learned more about
  Royalties in history than in politics, took their position with a certain
  simplicity and could even imagine (just as if she had really been in the
  Balkans) that they might be worth murdering or worth obeying. She had come
  back into the life of the Court and the capital, which she had left as a mere
  child, full of that irrepressible desire to be useful, which is so normal in
  women and so dangerous in great ladies, and she was at present making herself
  a nuisance by asking questions of everybody about everything. She naturally
  asked questions about the popular political riddle of The Word, and
  generally, as Mr. Edmund Burke would say, about the cause of the present
  discontents. She was all the more intrigued when nobody could tell her what
  The Word was and very few, in her world, what the row was all about. It was
  therefore with a considerable glow of superiority that she returned to her
  family one afternoon and announced that she had actually seen the seditious
  minstrel, who was apparently responsible for the somewhat obscure
  revolutionary rhyme and the somewhat mysterious revolutionary movement.</p>

  <p>Her car was moving slowly down a quiet street, because she was on the
  look-out for a curio shop she had known in childhood and could not
  immediately locate. Just beyond the curio shop was a café, with a few tables
  outside it in the continental manner, and at one of these tables was seated
  in front of a green liqueur an odd-looking person with very long hair and a
  very high stock or cravat. I have said that historical and geographical
  identification matter little in this case; and the reader may, if he likes,
  clothe this queer episode in any outlandish or antiquated fashion of
  fantasies of costume, for indeed the most recent fashion is full of quaint
  revivals and modes that might be either very old or very new. The man with
  the stock might have been some eccentric contemporary or creation of Balzac;
  he might equally well have been an art student of today, with the most
  Futurist views but the most Early Victorian whiskers. His mane of long hair
  was of an incredible dark auburn that looked like dim crimson rather than
  ordinary red; his forked or cloven beard was of the same unnatural colour and
  was shown up by the high cravat which was of a vivid sort of peacock-green.
  The colour of the cravat varied, however, from day to day; sometimes it was
  of a brighter green when the spirit of spring inspired his songs; sometimes
  of purple when he was lamenting the rich tragedy of his loves; sometimes
  completely black when he had decided that the time had really come to destroy
  the universe. He would explain to his friends that he followed without
  faltering the clue of the mood and the sky of morning, but they never
  recommended a necktie that did not contrast effectively with his beard. For
  this was no other than the poet Sebastian, whose verses counted for so much
  in the revolutionary movement of the moment.</p>

  <p>The Princess, of course, was quite unaware of his identity, and would have
  passed him with no particular comment beyond a disapproval of his necktie.
  But he returned to her attention and remained in it because of the curiously
  different conditions in which she saw him only an hour or two later, when the
  shops and factories had shut their doors and poured forth their populations.
  When she came back again through the quiet street, it was no longer quiet. It
  was especially the reverse of quiet in the neighbourhood of the café where
  the stranger had been drinking the green liqueur, and if the car moved slowly
  now, it was because of the difficulty of making its way through an
  ever-thickening crowd. For the long-haired person in the cravat was now
  standing on the café table and declaiming what appeared to be alternate
  fragments of prose and verse, with some modern intermediate types difficult
  to define. She came just in time, however, to hear the end of the now
  familiar jingle or rhymed motto:</p>

  <p> </p>

  <blockquote>
    "As God alone is greater than the gods,<br>
    As all stars shrivel in the single sun,<br>
    The words are many, but The Word is one.
  </blockquote>

  <p> </p>

  <p>"But The Word will not pass my lips, nor those of the Four Wardens of The
  Word who already know it, until the first part of the work has been
  accomplished. When the powerless have risen against the powerful, when the
  poor have risen above the rich, when the weak have risen and proved stronger
  than the strong, when&mdash;"</p>

  <p>At this moment he and his hearers suddenly became conscious of the sober
  but elegant vehicle which was pushing its prow like a boat above the popular
  waves, and the somewhat haughty countenance that appeared above it, just
  behind the wooden countenance of the chauffeur. Most people present
  recognized the lady and there was a sudden stir and stoppage, as of
  embarrassment, but the poet standing on the table struck a new attitude of
  sublime impudence and cried aloud:</p>

  <p>"But how hard it is for ugliness to rise against beauty. And we are an
  ugly lot!"</p>

  <p>And the Princess drove on in a condition of towering rage.</p><hr><br>

  <h2><a name="c042"
     id="c042">II</a>. &mdash; THE PROCESSION OF THE PLOTTERS</h2>

<p class="first">It has already been explained that Pavonia was governed on
enlightened
  modern principles. That is to say, the King was popular and powerless; the
  popularly elected Premier was unpopular and moderately powerful; the head of
  the Secret Police was much more powerful, and the quiet and intelligent
  little banker, to whom they all owed money, was most powerful of all. But all
  four of them were moderate in their respective rôles; none of them had ever
  pushed matters to a rupture and all four of them were often in the habit of
  discussing, at an informal Privy Council, the growing problems of the
  State.</p>

  <p>The King, whose historical title was Clovis the Third, was a lank and
  rather melancholy man with yellow moustaches and imperial and rather hollow
  eyes; well-bred enough to make his weariness appear impersonal rather than
  personal in its application, but not otherwise exciting company. The Prime
  Minister was short and stout, and very vivacious for his stoutness; though a
  Pavonian of bourgeois origin he was rather like a French politician, which is
  by no means the same as being like an ordinary Frenchman. He had pince-nez
  and a short beard and spoke to individuals in a guarded, but to large crowds
  in a confidential tone of voice. His name was Valence and he had been
  considered rather a Radical, until the new revolutionary movement had
  suddenly revealed him as a rather obstinate capitalist, turning, as it were,
  his sturdy figure black against the red glare. The Chief of Police was a big,
  bilious soldier named Grimm, whose yellow face told of fevers in many
  countries and whose tight mouth told very little of anything. He was the only
  person present who looked as if he would be in any way formidable in an hour
  of national peril, and he was always the most pessimistic of the four about
  his own hopes of dealing with it. The last was a slight, refined little
  figure with straight, grey hair and a hooked nose rather large for his
  attenuated features. He was dressed in dark grey so that his streaks of limbs
  seemed to repeat his streaks of hair, and only when he carefully fitted on a
  pair of tortoise-shell goggles, did his eyes seem suddenly to stand out and
  come to life, as if he were a monster who put his eyes on and off like a
  mask. This was Isidor Simon, the banker, and he had never taken any title
  though many had been offered to him.</p>

  <p>The occasion of their special meeting was that the wild and hitherto
  rather vague movement called the Brotherhood of The Word had suddenly
  received support from a very unexpected quarter. The poet Sebastian was only
  a poor Bohemian freelance, of obscure origin and apparently illegitimate
  birth. Even his surname was doubtful: it was easy for the newspapers to make
  fun of his real affectations and to underrate his real influence. But when it
  was actually announced that a man like Professor Phocus had declared himself
  a friend and follower of the poet, everybody felt that the whole social
  situation had changed. Phocus was quite another matter; he was the scientific
  world: the world of colleges and committees. He was a name; he was not indeed
  very well known personally, being much of a recluse, but his quaint figure
  with high and narrow top-hat, more like a pipe than a hat, and the green
  spectacles which he wore to protect his dim eyes from ordinary daylight, was
  a familiar enough object in certain places, especially the great National
  Museum, where he not only specialized in certain Palaeo-Pavonian antiquities,
  but conducted select groups of students round to inspect the relics and
  sculptures which illustrated that branch of study. He was universally
  recognized as a man of vast learning and laborious accuracy, and when it was
  stated in cold print that he, Professor Phocus, had found prophecies
  concerning The Word in the prehistoric hieroglyphics of Pavonia, only two
  explanations seemed possible, both equally catastrophic. Either the great
  Phocus had suddenly gone mad, or there was really something in it.</p>

  <p>For some time the banker had succeeded in allaying the fears of the
  Council, by what might seem a professional, but is in these days a practical
  argument. A popular poet might set all the crowds in the streets singing his
  songs, and a learned man of European reputation might induce all the dons in
  the world to read his book. But the salary of the learned man, for taking the
  tourists a tour of the hieroglyphics, was a little more than five guineas a
  week, and the salary of the poet was an unknown quantity that was frequently
  a minus quantity. You cannot make a modern revolution, or anything modern,
  without money. It was difficult to see how the poet and the professor managed
  to pay for the occasional leaflets they circulated or the printing of the
  poem about The Word; let alone for munitions or commissariat or soldiers' pay
  or anything that is necessary for the higher purposes of civil war. Mr.
  Simon, the financial adviser, therefore, had advised the King to disregard
  the movement until its backing was a little more financial. But to this
  Council the Chief of Police had brought news which seemed to alter
  everything.</p>

  <p>"Of course," he said in his slow fashion, "I'd often seen the poet going
  into the pawnbroker's."</p>

  <p>"The natural resort of poets, I suppose," said the Prime Minister, and
  rather missed the schoolgirl giggle with which his joke would have been
  greeted at a public meeting, for the King's face was blank and sad and the
  banker's careless and inattentive. No change ever appeared on Grimm's face,
  even on public platforms, and he went on steadily:</p>

  <p>"Of course, any number of people go to the pawnbroker's&mdash;especially
  this pawnbroker; he is little Loeb, who calls himself Lobb and lives at the
  corner of the Old Market, in the poorest part of the town. He's a Jew, of
  course, but not so much disliked as some Jews of his trade, and such
  thousands of people do business with him that we were rather led to look into
  the matter. The result of our inquiries points to the man being quite
  incredibly rich, all the more because he lives like a poor man. The general
  belief is that he is a miser."</p>

  <p>The banker had put on the goggles that made his eyes look twice as big,
  and as they peered across the table they were like gimlets.</p>

  <p>"He isn't a miser," said Simon, "and if he's a millionaire, then my
  question is answered."</p>

  <p>"Do you know him?" asked the King, speaking for the first time. "Why do
  you say he isn't a miser?"</p>

  <p>"Because no Jew was ever a miser," answered the banker. "Avarice is not a
  Jewish vice; it's a peasant's vice, a vice of people who want to protect
  themselves with personal possessions in perpetuity. Greed is the Jewish vice:
  greed for luxury; greed for vulgarity; greed for gambling; greed for throwing
  away other people's money and their own on a harem or a theatre or a grand
  hotel or some harlotry&mdash;or possibly on a grand revolution. But not
  hoarding it. That is the madness of sane men; of men who have a soil."</p>

  <p>"How do you know?" asked the King with mild curiosity. "How did you come
  to make a study of Jews?"</p>

  <p>"Only by being one myself," replied the banker.</p>

  <p>There was a short silence, and then the King went on with a reassuring
  smile: "And so you think he may be spending his millions on financing a
  revolution."</p>

  <p>"It would have to be that or a super-cinema or something," assented Simon,
  "and that would explain the pamphlets and printed songs, and may explain
  other things yet."</p>

  <p>"The most difficult thing to explain," observed the King thoughtfully,
  "seems to be where any of these people actually are at any given moment.
  Professor Phocus is fairly regular in his round at the Museum, but I doubt if
  we any of us know his private address. My niece tells me that she has
  actually seen Sebastian, the poet, orating in the public streets, but I've
  never seen him, and nobody I know seems to have any idea of where he lives.
  And, from what I can gather, though any number of people go to Lobb's
  pawnshop, very few of them ever see Lobb. I was told he was dead: but that
  may be part of the plot, of course."</p>

  <p>"It is exactly upon that point," said the Chief of Police gravely, "that I
  have a very important piece of further information to place before Your
  Majesty. Through a course of long and rather difficult inquiries, I have
  discovered that Lobb, the pawnbroker, did, about two years, ago, purchase,
  under another name, a small but comfortable house in Peacock Crescent. I have
  set some of my men to watch it, and, according to their report, there is
  every reason to suppose that it is used, not regularly but intermittently, as
  a meeting-place for three or four persons who arrive very privately and
  generally after dark, dine there in comfort, but considerable secrecy, and do
  not appear to revisit it until the next little dinner of the kind. There
  seems to be no regular staff of servants, and the house is commonly shuttered
  and deserted, but a servant of one or other of these people generally goes
  out about an hour before dinner and gets in wine and provisions and
  presumably remains to wait at table. The tradesmen in the neighbourhood
  report that he appears to be catering for three or four people, but beyond
  that they profess to know nothing. The detective, one of my best men, whom I
  have set to watch the house, says that the guests always arrive about dusk
  and very much muffled up in cloaks and coats, but he says he could swear to
  three of them."</p>

  <p>"Look here," said the banker after a grave silence, "the fewer people who
  know about this the better. I think it would be well if one or two of us went
  down personally, and posted ourselves in that particular street on one of
  these festive evenings. I don't mind going there myself, if you will give me
  the protection of your presence, Colonel Grimm. I know the professor and the
  pawnbroker by sight, and I dare say we might make a guess at the poet."</p>

  <p>King Clovis, in a dry and rather reluctant voice, gave the details of the
  poet's purple and peacock-green appearance, as conveyed to him by his
  indignant niece.</p>

  <p>"Well, that may be a guide, too, sir," said the banker briskly. And that
  was how it came about that the most powerful financier in Pavonia, and the
  officer in charge of the whole police system of that country, kicked their
  heels patiently or impatiently for several hours, a little way beyond the
  circle of light thrown by the last lamp-post in the silent and deserted
  Crescent.</p>

  <p>Peacock Crescent was so called, not because its pallid and classical
  façade had ever been brightened by any peacocks, but out of compliment to the
  bird which was the royal cognizance of Pavonia, and presumably the origin of
  its name, and which was represented in very flat relief, with tail outspread,
  on a medallion at one end of the semicircle of houses. Round the whole
  semicircle there ran a row of classical pillars, in the manner of many
  terraces in Bath or old Brighton; the whole classic curve looked very cold
  and marmoreal in the moon which was rising over the clump of trees opposite,
  and it seemed to the watchers that every sound they made echoed and re-echoed
  as through a hollow, silver shell.</p>

  <p>Their vigil had already been a long one. They had seen, from about the
  time of twilight and onward, the routine of the preliminaries which the
  police had already noted as marking the rare re-awakenings of the house; the
  servant in his sober livery going out at the regular hour and returning with
  a basket containing bottles of wine and other provisions; the sudden
  lighting-up of the dark house from within, or rather of the one room in it
  presumably reserved for the feast; the drawing down of the blind that the
  feast might be the more private; but none of the guests had as yet arrived.
  Closer inquiries of the local tradesmen had verified the fact that the
  servant had been making preparations for four diners; the actual number had
  slipped out in the course of his curt requests. The two distinguished spies
  in the street were not, of course, so completely isolated as they seemed.
  Other secret service men were within hail and the Chief of Police could
  without much difficulty put the constabulary machinery in action. Immediately
  in front of the crescent of houses was one of those picturesque but unmeaning
  scraps of ornamental shrubbery, with a railing round it, which are to be
  found in many city squares and secluded terraces. This clump of bushes threw
  a big shadow in the moonlight, and at one corner of the railing there lurked
  a plain-clothes officer with a motor-cycle, ready to start on any errand.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, and in utter stillness, a small shadow seemed to detach itself
  from the big shadow and seemed to skim across the road as lightly as a dry
  leaf. Indeed it had something of the look of a dried leaf, for though the
  figure was not abnormally small, it was curled up as if shrunk or withered;
  the head was sunk so deep in high shoulders and a shabby waterproof that only
  a few hairy wisps wandered in the air, that might be beard or whiskers or
  even, as a wilder fancy prompted, eyebrows; the legs were rather long than
  otherwise but moving in a bent and crooked fashion like a grasshopper's. His
  passage across the road was so swift and surprising that the door of the
  house had opened to him and closed on him again before the watchers had fully
  recovered from their first surprise. Then Simon looked at Grimm and said,
  with a faint smile:</p>

  <p>"The hurry is hospitality. That is the owner of the house."</p>

  <p>"Yes, I suppose that is the pawnbroker."</p>

  <p>"That is the Revolution," observed the banker. "At least, that is the real
  basis of every revolution. They could do nothing without his money. They talk
  about a rising of the poor, but they cannot even rise so long as they are
  poor. Why, these four men would have nowhere to meet like this, if Lobb had
  not bought the house for them."</p>

  <p>"I should be the last to deny that money is useful," answered Grimm, "but
  money alone won't make either a revolution or a realm."</p>

  <p>"My dear Grimm," said Simon, "I know you are an officer and a gentleman;
  you can't help that, but really you are becoming romantic."</p>

  <p>"Do I look romantic?" asked the bilious officer and gentleman. "No soldier
  is ever romantic&mdash;not about soldiering, anyhow. But what I say is
  horse-sense, for all that. There is no soldiering without soldiers, and money
  doesn't make soldiers. You can give a mob a mountain of munitions, and it's
  no good if they won't use them or can't use them."</p>

  <p>"Well, I should say. . . . Look out, here's somebody else."</p>

  <p>The other had already become conscious of a dull clang of sound for which
  he could not immediately account, and the next moment another shadow had
  passed across the scene of that shadow pantomime. This shadow had a sharply
  outlined and very high black hat like an elongated chimney-pot, and the moon
  gleamed for a moment on the green spectacles of Professor Phocus of the
  National Museum. He also disappeared rapidly into the hospitable house.</p>

  <p>"That's the Professor," said Simon. "Perhaps, as he is so learned, he will
  lecture to them on munitions."</p>

  <p>"Yes," replied Grimm, "I saw who it was. . . . But I'm bothered about
  something else. Did you hear a sort of iron creak and clang just before he
  appeared? It must have been the gate in that railing over there. I believe
  they must both have come out of that dingy little garden. What could they be
  doing there?"</p>

  <p>"Nesting in the trees, perhaps; they look queer enough birds for
  anything," answered the other.</p>

  <p>"Well, the railing isn't high," said the police chief at last. "They may
  simply have clambered in and out again to confuse the scent, but it's rum
  that my man over there didn't see them."</p>

  <p>A long interval followed, and the two companions pacing up and down to
  pass the time, fell again into their discussion. "What I mean," said Grimm,
  "is that it's a bad blunder to reckon on material without moral. Money
  doesn't fight. Men fight. If the time comes when men won't fight, even money
  won't make them. And somebody has got to teach them how. How are your
  revolutionary armies going to be drilled? Will Mr. Sebastian drill them to
  recite poems? Will Mr. Lobb drill them to fill in pawn-tickets?"</p>

  <p>"Well," said Simon, making a sign of warning, "here is Mr. Sebastian; so
  you had better ask him."</p>

  <p>This time it was unmistakable that the newcomer threw open the gate of the
  little garden and crossed the road to the house. For Sebastian of the purple
  beard and peacock scarf walked with a certain swagger, even when a
  conspirator apparently alone under the moon; the gate closed behind him with
  a ringing clash and even the door of the house seemed to open and shut again
  with a shade of greater pomposity.</p>

  <p>"Those are all we know of," said Simon thoughtfully.</p>

  <p>"The man said there were four," answered Grimm.</p>

  <p>The intervals between these flitting appearances seemed to grow longer and
  wearier, and as the last was especially extended, the banker, having less of
  the professional patience of a policeman, began to grow more and more
  sceptical of the unknown guest, and to express a frank readiness for his own
  bed. But Grimm remained fixed in his theory of the quadrilateral council, and
  after a long interval, so long that they almost looked for dawn in the east,
  they heard the gate move once more and a tall figure approached the house. He
  was clad in a cape or cloak of grey that looked silvery in the moonshine; and
  as it fell apart showed a gleam, and almost a blaze, of more brilliant
  silver; for it seemed to be some sort of white and dazzling uniform, with
  stars and clasps. Then the man turned his face for a moment upwards to the
  moon, and the face was the final shock; for it was darker than the glittering
  garments. Under the moon it looked almost blue, or at least took on those
  varied tints of grey and violet that are the highlights on the African
  complexion, and Grimm knew that the man was General Casc, the Dictator from
  beyond the frontier.</p><hr><br>

  <h2><a name="c043"
     id="c043">III</a>. &mdash; THE PRINCESS INTERVENES</h2>

<p class="first">The moment that Colonel Grimm of the Pavonian Police saw that
black face
  turned like a blue mask to the moon, he knew that the whole machinery of the
  State must act together like one mantrap to catch one man. He wanted to catch
  the other three men who were his fellow-conspirators, of course, and he
  thanked his stars for the chance of catching them all together in one room,
  but it was the fourth man whose presence made the huge and staggering
  difference. Before his companion could even speak, or do anything but stare,
  Grimm had sent his motor-cyclist down the street like a stone from a sling,
  and knew that police and soldiers were closing round and stopping the mouths
  of all the streets.</p>

  <p>For Grimm had a special score to settle with the great General Casc. He
  had suspected months before that there might be movements on the frontier and
  attempts of the revolutionary foreign government to make signals to the
  discontented classes in Pavonia. He had repeatedly pressed diplomatic
  inquiries and demands through the Prime Minister and other accredited
  representatives of Pavonian interests, and the answer had always been
  soothing and had always been the same. General Casc gave his word of honour
  that he had not the faintest intention of meddling with the internal affairs
  of Pavonia. General Casc was a plain soldier and no politician. General Casc
  was getting on in years, and had every intention of retiring from the
  Presidency and from all public affairs. General Casc was seriously ill, and
  had practically already retired. All these diplomatic reassurances had been
  dispatched one after another, lulling to a large extent the listless
  amiability of the King, favourably impressing the fussy self-importance of
  the Prime Minister, and leaving only a very vague and dying doubt even in the
  more cynical mind of the Chief of Police. And now this was the sequel, and
  the secret of what was really going on. This was how the aged and more or
  less dying African retired into private life. General Casc was dangerously
  ill, but well enough to go out to dinner. By a curious coincidence, he was
  dining with the three men vowed to destroy the Government with which he
  professed to be at peace. The Chief of Police ground his teeth and looked
  down the street eagerly for the two or three files of gendarmes already
  advancing down it.</p>

  <p>It was likely enough that there was little time to lose. The presence of
  the foreign military leader might mean all sorts of things. It might mean
  tons of dynamite under the street where they stood; it might at least mean
  dumps of munitions in every dark corner of the city, accessible to the
  leaders of the mob. At the worst, there was one thing that might save them
  yet. And that was the instant, sudden and simultaneous arrest of all the four
  men in that house, leaving the whole revolution without leaders. Grimm waited
  till his little troop of armed men had drawn up before the house and then
  cautiously advanced up the steps to the door. He had already made certain
  that similar groups were posted behind and on all sides of the row of houses,
  so that there could be no escape unless there was a subterranean exit. He had
  even put men with ladders farther along the Crescent, in case there should be
  a stampede along the roof. Then, after a moment's hesitation, he struck once
  and heavily upon the door, and the light in the lighted dining-room instantly
  went out.</p>

  <p>For some time there was no other response; then he hammered on the door
  again, calling out in his strong voice in the King's name and threatening
  that the door would be forced immediately. Then at last the door was opened
  by the pale servant in livery, who had evidently received orders to delay the
  entrance of the police by every exhibition of stupidity and helplessness.
  With almost inconceivable absence of humour, he said that his master and the
  company were engaged and could not see any visitors. But Grimm paid no
  attention to what he guessed to be an order repeated by rote. Without further
  ceremony he pushed the servant aside, merely saying to his subordinate
  behind, "Keep hold of this fellow; we may as well bag him with the rest."
  Then he thrust his way down the dark passage and threw open the door of the
  dining-room.</p>

  <p>It was undoubtedly the dining-room, for it offered a convincing picture of
  unfinished, or barely finished dinner. Of the four places laid, one at least
  was occupied by the paraphernalia of coffee, while others seemed to mark
  various stages of trifling with savouries and sweets. Beside the black coffee
  was a small and now empty bottle of champagne; opposite to it was a large and
  half-empty bottle of Burgundy; to the left of that, an even more formidable
  object, was a large and by no means untouched bottle of brandy, and opposite
  that, by a sort of meek fantasy of contrast, stood an untasted glass of
  milk.</p>

  <p>Cigars and cigarettes of the best quality were placed on a small side
  table, so as to be immediately at hand, and there was every sign of a
  successful dinner-party, which had evidently been luxurious without being
  altogether conventional. At least, there was every sign of the successful
  dinner-party except the diners. Their chairs stood about the table, some of
  them thrust back a little way as if the occupants had risen in a natural and
  unhurried style; one at least was still drawn up to the table as if the diner
  was not so easily to be detached from his dinner. But he and all the rest had
  vanished; suddenly, silently and completely, as the light had vanished from
  the window with the first blow upon the door.</p>

  <p>"Pretty quick work," said the Chief of Police, "but I suppose they're
  bolting for some other exit. Send the men down to the basement at once, and
  see that Hart is watching the house at the back. They can't be far off yet;
  this coffee is still quite hot and I think he was just going to help himself
  to sugar."</p>

  <p>"Who was?" inquired Simon a little hazily. "Do you think they were all
  here?"</p>

  <p>"Obviously they were," replied Grimm. "One doesn't need to be much of a
  detective to pick out the separate places of all four. Their very plates are
  like portraits; you can almost see them all sitting there. Look at that glass
  of milk; you don't suppose that mad poet or that nigger General drink milk,
  do you? But that's Professor Phocus to the life, if you can call it life.
  He's one of those dried-up old dyspeptics who talk about nothing but health
  and get unhealthier every day by doing so. He's full of all sorts of food
  fads, and must be a most dismal person to dine with. However, the others have
  fortified themselves pretty well against dismalness. Our romantic Sebastian,
  who colours everything crimson and purple, even his hair&mdash;what else
  should he drink but Burgundy? But that hard-headed old savage Casc has gone
  one better, you see. Brandy for heroes, as Dr. Johnson said. And yet the last
  is the most typical of all. How absolutely characteristic of the little Jew
  to have a little champagne, but very expensive, and to have black coffee, the
  proper digestive, after it. Ah, he understands health better than the health
  faddist does! But there's something blood-curdling about these cultured Jews,
  with their delicate and cautious art of pleasure. Some say it's because they
  don't believe in a future life."</p>

  <p>While he was talking thus, apparently at random, he was thoroughly
  ransacking the room, leaving to his subordinates the ransacking of the house,
  and his frown was heavy though his tone was light.</p>

  <p>The ransacking of the room could for the present be only superficial, but
  so far as it went it was hardly hopeful. There were no curtains or cupboards,
  no bookcases; there was certainly no other door and it was preposterous to
  suppose that, under the eyes of all the gendarmes, four men could have
  escaped by the window. Grimm made a preliminary examination of the floor,
  which seemed quite solid, a sort of concrete, coloured with a dull, wavering
  pattern of an old-fashioned type. Of course, the four men might have gone out
  by the door of the room before their servant had opened the door of the
  house, but even so, it was not easy to say where they had gone to. For indeed
  the ransacking of the house had proved even more barren than the ransacking
  of the room; and they were considerably surprised to find that there was so
  little of the house to ransack. There was no basement; there was only one
  narrow back door; there was only one other small room, like a smoking-room,
  at the back of the dining-room and looking through open windows on to the
  street behind; there was a large and small bedroom of corresponding size on
  the floor above, and that was all. Grimm was somewhat surprised at this
  exiguous accommodation, as compared with the aristocratic stateliness of the
  façade. It sharpened a certain sense of the whole Crescent having something
  hollow about it; like a stone mask of some cold, classical comedy. Perhaps
  the moon also made it look a little spectral, but he could not help
  entertaining for a flash of that pale light the absurd fancy that the street
  itself had been staged as a part of the plot or comedy, and that it was like
  a pasteboard palace in a pantomime. His common sense, returning, told him
  that the imposture was of an older and more ordinary sort, and bore witness
  only to the normal snobbishness of men who are content with small quarters so
  long as it is in a fashionable quarter. That row of showy and shallow
  mansions, with pillars and bow-windows, was probably only a row of men who
  liked to look richer than they were. Nevertheless, there was something queer
  about it considered as the headquarters of a vast conspiracy and the
  meeting-place of the four tribunes of a revolution. There was not much room
  to store dynamite or dump munitions <i>here</i>, anyhow. But another
  incongruous fancy flitted across his mind; they might well have been storing
  an entirely new sort of chemical gas, that made solid human bodies vanish
  like smoke or turn transparent like glass.</p>

  <p>A searching and scientific examination, covering days and weeks, brought
  them no farther than those first few observations of the first few moments.
  If there was any crack in the concrete floor, it followed no line or
  direction that they could discover; if anybody had escaped to anywhere,
  except into the bowels of the earth, he must have done it under a hundred
  staring eyes and the staring moon. The giant man-trap had closed with the
  most scientific precision and perfection; only the trap was empty. It was
  with this gloomy and even alarmist news that the Chief of Police and the
  financier, playing the amateur detective, went back to report to the Prime
  Minister and the King.</p>

  <p>Despite the swiftness with which Colonel Grimm had darted out of the rear
  of the house after the fugitives, he was brought up all standing at the
  corner of the next street, by an exhibition that affected him like an
  explosion. The whole of the blank wall was plastered with new placards; so
  new that they might almost have been put there since the raid on the house;
  conceivably even flung behind as a last gesture of insolence by the runaway
  rebels, like the paper scattered by the hares in a paper-chase. He put one
  finger to the paper-covered wall and found the paste on it still wet.</p>

  <p>But it was the proclamations themselves that were most arresting. They
  were mostly scrawled in red paint or ink, which had even run here and there,
  perhaps with a melodramatic suggestion of blood. They all began with the word
  "Now" in gigantic letters, followed by the assertion "The Word will be spoken
  to-night". The brief paragraphs that followed were to the effect that all was
  now ready for the blow at the Government which had failed in its last
  desperate effort to capture the men who would tomorrow be the rulers of the
  city. It was notable that the people were adjured especially to "Look to the
  Frontiers" and it was not only implied that the mysterious "Word" was now to
  be spoken, but hinted that the thick and thunderous lips of the sinister
  African would speak it.</p>

  <p>Passing up the Poplar Avenue towards the red-brick Georgian palace, they
  found the King of Pavonia in another room, in another suit of clothes and in
  another frame of mind. He was no longer in uniform, but in a light-grey
  lounge suit and very obviously lounging. King Clovis was a paradox in many
  ways; he hated formality and yet he was very formal, on formal occasions; in
  spite of the paradox, we might say that he hated formal occasions because
  they made him very formal. But in this more comfortable apartment, with
  tea-things on the table, he was in the bosom of his family, so far as the
  presence of a niece sitting on a sofa and staring out of a window constituted
  a bosom in the traditional sense. The Princess, whom the works of reference
  called Aurelia and whom her uncle called Mary, was rather distrait and
  silent, but the King had no objection to silence. The Prime Minister was not
  present; he always imparted a nameless nuance of fussiness, and the King had
  a great objection to fuss.</p>

  <p>The Chief of Police told the story of his dramatic disappointment and the
  King listened to it with mild wonder but without any appearance of
  irritation.</p>

  <p>"I suppose," he said, "that if that old Jew really bought the house
  specially for them, he must have fixed up some sort of trick in it."</p>

  <p>"So I had supposed, sir," assented Grimm. "But we cannot as yet come on
  the faintest trace of the trick. And I can't help being a little troubled
  about what these four rascals may be doing. Their proclamations make it quite
  plain that they are preparing a big move."</p>

  <p>"If you can't catch them," put in Simon, "can't you arrest anybody else?
  Surely the Party must have some other leaders."</p>

  <p>The Chief of Police shook his head. "That is the queerest thing about it,"
  he said. "This is the most extraordinary movement I ever heard of, in the way
  in which it is disciplined and organized and, above all, silenced. There must
  be hundreds of them in it, but to hear them talk, or rather decline to talk,
  you would think there was nobody in it. It's called the Brotherhood of The
  Word, but it seems to me more like the Brotherhood of The Silence. They all
  stare you blindly in the face, and smile, or say a word about the weather,
  and there's no catching them by any cross-examination. That's evidently the
  policy of the whole business. The crowd is more invisible than the
  conspirators, so to speak. Only these four famous conspirators are paraded
  before us. Their private meetings are comparatively public, but the mind of
  the mob is still private and it melts at a touch. We can convict nobody but
  these four, and the only people we can convict are the only people we can't
  catch."</p>

  <p>"Then we have actually nobody in custody," said Simon.</p>

  <p>Grimm made a wry face. "We hung on to one stupid footman who opened the
  door to us," he said. "Not a very glorious bag to boast of when you are out
  gunning for General Casc."</p>

  <p>"We must be thankful for small things," said the King. "What does the
  stupid footman say?"</p>

  <p>"He doesn't say anything. It's possible he doesn't know anything. Indeed I
  think it's more than possible that the man is too stupid to know anything, a
  big lump of a fellow, probably chosen for his long legs; they say people
  choose flunkeys for their calves. Or he may have some dull idea of being
  loyal to his master."</p>

  <p>The Princess turned her head for the first time and said: "Has anybody
  suggested the rather brighter idea of being loyal to his King?"</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid," said Clovis, in a nervous and uneasy manner, "that the time
  has gone by for cavaliers and gallant courtiers, Mary. You can't solve modern
  political problems by telling people to be loyal to the King."</p>

  <p>"Why do they tell them to be loyal to everything else except the King?"
  asked the young lady, with some warmth. "When there's a strike or something
  at the soap works, your newspaper tells them to be loyal to the soap-boilers,
  who are accused of being sweaters. The journalists tell them to be loyal to
  their Party and to their Trusted Leaders and all the rest. But if I talk of a
  leader who isn't a Party Leader, who's at least supposed to stand for the
  whole nation and all patriotic people, then you tell me I'm old-fashioned. Or
  else you tell me I'm young. It seems to be considered the same thing."</p>

  <p>His Majesty the King of Pavonia stared at his niece with a sort of vague
  alarm, as if a kitten had turned into a tiger-cat on the hearth-rug. But she
  went on like one who is resolved to release an accumulation of
  impatience.</p>

  <p>"Why must the King be the only private gentleman in Pavonia? All the
  others are extremely public gentlemen or public parodies of gentlemen. Why
  may any man talk to the mob except ourselves? Do you know what I really felt
  when I saw that purple-whiskered poet posturing on a table in the street? Of
  course, to start with, I had a sense of something horribly artificial; he was
  like some painted and gilded doll or mummy dancing. But what annoyed me most
  was that peacock-coloured scarf flapping round his neck, and making me
  remember the old peacock flag of the Pavonians, and how they say that the
  peacock fans were carried before the King even in battle. What business has
  he got to wear such colours, if we mayn't? We have got to be dull and genteel
  and die of good taste behind the drawn blinds of the palace. But the
  conspirators may be flamboyant. The republicans may be royal. That's why they
  appeal to the people; because they do exactly what kings used to do, when
  kings had any sense. Your papers and politicians talk about the dreadful
  growth of Red propaganda and wonder how it can be popular. Why, because it's
  Red, of course. Kings and cardinals and peers and judges used to be Red, when
  we weren't ashamed of having a little colour in our lives."</p>

  <p>The constitutional monarch seemed more and more embarrassed. "Perhaps," he
  said, "we have wandered a little from the point. It was a small point we were
  mentioning at the moment, about the questioning of the footman
  and&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I have every intention of sticking to the point," said the Princess
  firmly. "I have every intention of sticking to the footman, too, and
  preventing any fool from letting him go. Don't you see he is just the sort of
  thing I mean? All the nonsense they talk against patriotism and militarism
  has just let the ordinary poor man slide and sink to be the servant of any
  rascally adventurer. He is put into a livery to be loyal to a conspirator,
  because we were afraid to put him into a uniform and ask him to be loyal to a
  king."</p>

  <p>"Personally," said Grimm, "I have a great deal of sympathy with Your Royal
  Highness's view. But I'm afraid it's too late to do that now."</p>

  <p>"How do you know?" demanded the lady with some heat. "Have you ever put
  the real point to a man like that? Have you ever asked him what he feels
  about his loyalties and his country and the king he heard about when he was a
  child? Not you; you've just badgered him like a barrister about details of
  time and place that no healthy human being ever remembers, and he's reduced
  to looking like the village idiot, and I don't wonder. I should like to talk
  to him myself."</p>

  <p>"My dear Mary&mdash;" began her uncle, now thrown thoroughly into
  disarray, and at the same moment he caught sight of the face that flashed on
  him over her shoulder, and his voice seemed to die away. Mr. Simon, the
  banker, had also begun to talk, after a tactful cough, and was saying: "If
  Your Royal Highness will allow me to say so, we ought surely to preserve a
  sense of proportion. The footman is only a common fellow and, I imagine,
  quite illiterate; in that sense, as Her Royal Highness says, a man of the
  people&mdash;but only one man out of a very large people. As an experiment in
  social science, it might be very interesting to try these theories upon him,
  but he is only a sample of the social material all round. Meanwhile, we
  should surely lose no time in concentrating on the really great and dangerous
  public characters whom we are pursuing. The Professor is a man of world-wide
  reputation; the General is a military hero at the head of armies, and really
  to stand quarrelling over the ignorance of a chance lackey&mdash;"</p>

  <p>As he spoke he found himself wavering between the door and the advancing
  Princess, and in his throat also the words seemed to dry up. For both men had
  suddenly seen the face of something that is intolerant and innocent and not
  altogether of this world; the completeness of that conviction in youth that
  as yet cannot believe in the complexity of living, and they fell back before
  her as the great princess demanded audience with a flunkey, as if there were
  something in her of that great peasant girl from Domrémy when she demanded
  audience of a King.</p><hr><br>

  <h2><a name="c044"
     id="c044">IV</a>. &mdash; THE UNREASONABLENESS OF WOMAN</h2>

<p class="first">When the great police raid on Peacock Crescent had a
conclusion <i>pour
  rire</i> in the bursting open of empty rooms and the pinching of a bewildered
  footman, the functionary was trailed along with the few other sticks of
  furniture that seemed faintly redolent of clues, and in the impersonal manner
  of men removing chairs and tables with a van. There was certainly nothing
  about him to indicate any significance beyond that of furniture. He was of
  the usual size and shape of fairly imposing flunkeys. His face had the sort
  of solid good looks, at once wooden and waxen, which went well with the
  powder of the old régime of flunkeydom; there was nothing notable except
  perhaps that, while his blank, blue eyes expressed something more than even
  the fatuity required by his profession, the depressing regularity of his
  features was rather relieved by a length of chin that suggested some sort of
  obscure obstinacy. And, indeed, the police who had questioned and
  cross-questioned him came to the conclusion that they had to deal with a case
  of stubbornness as well as stupidity.</p>

  <p>He had, of course, been bullied and badgered, and threatened with all
  sorts of entirely illegal things, according to the method which the police of
  all modern and civilized countries apply on principle to all servants,
  cabmen, costers and other persons supposed by their poverty to be an outlying
  province of the criminal classes; though every now and then those methods
  startle all Europe and are held up in flaming headlines of horror to the
  whole civilized world, when they happen to have been applied, by some fool or
  other, to a wealthy Jew or a heavily financed journalist. But the police had
  got nothing out of him that threw the least light on the meaning of his
  master's meetings and projects, and the weary investigators were beginning to
  attribute his silence to ignorance or idiocy. Only the Chief of Police
  himself, a man not altogether without sympathy and subtlety, still suspected
  that the taciturnity was tinged with fidelity.</p>

  <p>Anyhow, the servant in his capacity of prisoner was drearily accustomed by
  this time to see the door of his cell open and some uniformed official come
  in with a notebook or a menacing forefinger, trying to collect more facts
  from the barren soil of his speech. He was quite prepared for it to happen
  again and again, any number of times, but he was not prepared to see the same
  door open and introduce, not a policeman in uniform, but a beautiful lady in
  jewels and flaming fashionable colour scheme, who entered his prison as if it
  were the most natural thing in the world. Only dimly did he perceive the
  lowering and lumpish visage of a policeman in the shadows behind, and the
  lady herself seemed quite resolved that the policeman should be left in the
  shade. She shut the door behind her with a resolute clang and faced the
  astounded lackey with an equally resolute smile.</p>

  <p>He knew who she was, of course; he had seen her in the illustrated papers
  and even driving about the city in her car. In reply to her first question he
  attempted some stumbling expressions of respect, but she waved them on one
  side with a direct familiarity that paralysed him even more.</p>

  <p>"Don't let us worry about all that," she said. "We are both subjects of
  the King and patriots of Pavonia. At least I'm sure you must be really a
  patriot and I want to know why you don't behave like one."</p>

  <p>There was a long silence, and then he said, looking at the floor and in a
  rather hang-dog fashion: "I don't want any misunderstandings, Your Highness.
  I don't set up to be much of a patriot, and these people were always good to
  me."</p>

  <p>"Why, what did they do for you?" she demanded. "Gave you tips from time to
  time, I suppose. Paid you some sort of salary, probably much too small. What
  is that compared with what the country has done for us all? You can't eat
  bread without eating the corn of Pavonia; you can't drink water without
  drinking it from the rivers of your own land; you can't walk down the street
  in safety or liberty, without relying on the law that defends the citizens of
  the State."</p>

  <p>He suddenly threw up his head, and the very blank emptiness of his blue
  eyes affected her with something dizzy and even dazzling.</p>

  <p>"You see," he said, without a smile, "I am not walking in liberty down the
  street just now."</p>

  <p>"I know," she said obstinately, "but it's your own fault, isn't it? I'm
  sure you know of something these men are doing, something that's hanging over
  all of us like a thundercloud, and you won't say a word to save us, by
  telling us where the bolt will fall."</p>

  <p>He continued to stare in a vacant manner, and then repeated like an
  automaton: "The men were always good to me."</p>

  <p>She wrung one hand with a gesture of exasperation, and said rather
  unreasonably: "I don't believe they did anything at all. I expect they
  treated you rottenly, really."</p>

  <p>He seemed to meditate in his heavy way, and then said haltingly, but with
  an increasing suggestion of more instructed speech&mdash;as it were, working
  to the surface through the professional primness of his upper-servant
  intonation:</p>

  <p>"You see, these things go a bit by comparison. At the only school I was
  ever sent to they had hardly any meals at all; my family never had any money
  and I was often hungry all night, and out in the cold as well. You see, it's
  all very well to talk about the State and patriotism and the rest. Suppose
  when I was freezing in the gutter I had gone down on my knees to the great
  statue of Pavonia Victrix in the Fountain Square and said, 'Pavonia, give me
  food', I suppose the great statue would have stepped down from its pedestal
  at once and brought me a tray of hot cakes or a pile of ham sandwiches.
  Suppose it began to snow when I had hardly a rag on my back; I suppose the
  Flag of Pavonia, flying on the top of the palace, would have come down off
  its pole to wrap me up like a blanket. At least, I suppose some people think
  it would. You have to have rather rum experiences to find out that it
  doesn't."</p>

  <p>His figure remained heavy and motionless, but his voice took a new and
  rather indescribable turn or change.</p>

  <p>"But I did get food at Peacock Crescent. Those horrible revolutionists,
  who you say are destroying the whole city, at least prevented me from being
  destroyed. Suppose, if you like that they treated me like a dog; still, I was
  a stray dog and a starving dog, and they fed and sheltered me like a dog. You
  know what a dog would feel about turning on them or deserting them. Is thy
  servant less than a dog, that he should do this thing?"</p>

  <p>Something in the lift of his voice on the Scriptural phrase startled her
  and made her stare at him with a new curiosity.</p>

  <p>"What is your name?" she said.</p>

  <p>"My name is John Conrad," he said quite readily. "I have no family now to
  speak of, but we were once rather better off in the world than we are at
  present. But I assure Your Royal Highness there's no particular mystery about
  that. Coming down in the world is common enough in these days. Commoner than
  coming up in the world, which is even worse."</p>

  <p>She spoke in a lowered voice. "If you are really an educated man and a
  gentleman, you ought to be all the more ashamed to work with this gang of
  wreckers. It's all very well to talk about a dog, but it's not fair. A dog
  has only got a master, and naturally he sticks to the only duty required of
  him. A dog hasn't got a country or a cause or a religion or any general sense
  of right. But can you, as an educated man, reconcile it with any general
  sense of right to say you are a dog, and on that excuse fill the whole town
  with mad dogs?"</p>

  <p>He gazed at her with a painful intensity; in some strange fashion the
  staring and startling social disparity between them had really faded away on
  the heat of intellectual incompatibility, just as she had tried to wave it
  away with a gesture when she first made her amazing entry to the prison. As
  he looked at her a slow and singular change seemed to pass over his face and
  he seemed to realize some meaning to the situation he had as yet been too
  stunned to see.</p>

  <p>"It's beyond all possible goodness that you should trouble to talk to me
  like this," he said. "You, at least, are more generous to me than the men who
  only gave me food. You, I admit, have done more than they could ever have
  done for a man like me. But I don't recognize it about poor old Pavonia with
  its peacocks and palaces and police courts, and I wouldn't give up an inch of
  my own scruples for them."</p>

  <p>"If you like to put it so," she said quite steadily, "do it for me."</p>

  <p>"I certainly wouldn't do it for the others," he said, "but you see, that's
  just where my difficulty comes in. To obey you would be a pleasure, but I
  don't believe a bit of what you say about it being a duty. And what sort of a
  dog is it that won't do it for duty, but will do it for pleasure."</p>

  <p>"Oh, I hate that obstinate expression you've got!" she cried with a
  curious uncontrollable petulance. "I don't mind dogs, but I hate bulldogs.
  They're always so ugly."</p>

  <p>Then, suddenly altering her tone, the Princess added: "I don't see why you
  should be kept kicking your heels in this prison, all for your silly
  prejudices. They're bound to give you a long sentence for treason, if they do
  nothing else, if you will protect these devils who want to blow us all up
  tomorrow."</p>

  <p>"Very well," he said in a hard voice. "Then I must make up my mind to be
  punished for treason because I will not be a traitor."</p>

  <p>Something compact in his curt epigram seemed to savour almost of contempt,
  and her self-control suddenly gave way before a blaze of really royal
  anger.</p>

  <p>"Very well, then," she cried, turning furiously towards the door, "you can
  lie and rot there for treason, because you won't listen to reason; it's all
  one to us, of course, except that your mad, sulky obstinacy may smash us all
  to smithereens in twenty-four hours. God knows, and I suppose you know, what
  these blasphemous brutes are going to do to us all. And perhaps God cares,
  but you don't. You don't care for anything or anybody but your own chin and
  your own brutal pride. I've done with you."</p>

  <p>And she flung open the door, incongruously giving another glimpse of the
  pudding-faced policeman outside; then she vanished through the opening and
  the door clanged again and the prisoner was left alone in his cell.</p>

  <p>He sat down on the plank-bed and put his head in his hands, remaining in
  this rigid ruminating posture for a long time. Then he rose with a sigh and
  approached the door once more, for he heard outside it the heavy movements to
  which he was already and too fully accustomed, and he knew that some other
  visitor, who would by no means be a beautiful lady, was coming to bother him
  once more. But on this occasion the official interview was somewhat longer
  than usual, and of a somewhat different character.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <p>A few hours afterwards, when the Princess was declining, and the King
  accepting, a glass of Italian vermouth from a tray handed by a footman of a
  far less disturbing character, the Prime Minister, who was seated opposite in
  that private apartment of the palace, observed quite casually:</p>

  <p>"So it looks as if they may be frustrated after all. I was jolly nervous
  up to an hour ago, for I swear they had got something big that was just going
  to burst; all their last proclamations were like the cocking of a rifle
  before the bang comes. But since this silly footman is going to tell us where
  they're hidden, I expect we shall be too quick for them after all. Grimm
  says&mdash;"</p>

  <p>The Princess Aurelia Augusta, otherwise Mary, had risen to her feet as if
  she had received a personal insult.</p>

  <p>"What's all this mean?" she cried. "The footman hasn't spoken. He refuses
  absolutely to speak."</p>

  <p>"Your Royal Highness will pardon me," said the Prime Minister stiffly. "I
  have the news straight from the Chief of Police. The footman has certainly
  confessed the facts."</p>

  <p>"It's not true!" said Her Royal Highness obstinately. "I don't believe it
  for a minute."</p>

  <p>She seemed quite indignant about it, and indeed those who retain any
  capacity for surprise at the mystery of feminine psychology may be surprised
  to learn that, at her next interview with the prisoner, in the prison, she
  was very harsh and scornful towards him for having decided upon betraying all
  that she had told him to betray.</p>

  <p>"So that's the end of all your heroics and stubbornness and sticking out
  your chin," she said. "You're going to save yourself after all, and give up
  all these poor deluded creatures that are in hiding."</p>

  <p>He threw up his head in the rather startling fashion he had and stared at
  her with the blank but blazing blue eyes, that had always something about
  them of vertigo and the empty air, making the spectator dizzy.</p>

  <p>"Well," he said, "I certainly didn't suppose you regarded them with so
  much sympathy."</p>

  <p>"I regard them with great sympathy for having to do with you," she said,
  in a somewhat vicious manner. "Of course, I don't agree with them, but I'm
  quite sorry for them, being hunted and having to trust such people to hide
  them. I expect it was you who led them into mischief."</p>

  <p>The last clause was perhaps an afterthought. She said it on those sound
  general feminine principles, which some masculine minds, in moments of
  annoyance, have thought slightly unprincipled. But she was never more
  surprised in her life than when he smiled and said:</p>

  <p>"Yes, perhaps you are right. It was I who led them into mischief."</p>

  <p>As she looked at him with a painful curiosity, he added: "But remember
  what you said. If I did them wrong, I did it for you."</p>

  <p>An instant afterwards he burst out in a new and volcanic voice, that she
  had never heard before from him or from any man.</p>

  <p>"Do you suppose I don't know that it's all utterly unfair? Why should you
  have that power, as well as all the other kinds? Why should you have the only
  unanswerable thing, the face that is unanswerable like God on the Judgement
  Day? We can call up ignorance against science and impotence against power,
  but who is going to raise up ugliness against beauty? Who&mdash;?"</p>

  <p>He had taken a stride forward, but, what was much stranger, she had
  herself started and moved forward in response. She was staring into his face
  as if it had been blasted by a lightning-flash.</p>

  <p>"Oh, my God!" she cried. "It can't be that!"</p>

  <p>For she had in that instant become aware of an amazing possibility, and
  the rest of their interview was too wonderful to be believed.</p><hr><br>

  <h2><a name="c045"
     id="c045">V</a>. &mdash; THE TERMS OF A TRAITOR</h2>

<p class="first">One single thought like a thundercloud brooded over Pavonia,
its palace
  and principal city; the sort of concentration that commonly only possesses
  some ignorant village where a prophet or fanatic has predicted the instant
  end of the world. The last proclamations had had their effect; even the most
  careless were now convinced that at any moment a huge invasion on all the
  frontiers, or a horrible explosion in the heart of the city, would come at
  some signal they did not know, and by some gesture they could not arrest. The
  foreign invasion was felt perhaps as the more maddening of the two but they
  were all the more bewildered because there had hung over all this mysterious
  movement the shadow or savour of something foreign. It was admitted that the
  reputation of Professor Phocus was even greater in other countries than in
  his own; men began to ask with some irritation where the wealthy pawnbroker
  had come from, and, with slightly greater hesitation, how he had made his
  wealth. But nobody doubted that these men had constructed some engine that
  was about to act with hideous energy. It was in the midst of all this tossing
  insecurity that the message came that the captive footman would speak. He had
  actually signed a grave document, which ran: "I can say The Word and stop the
  work of the Four Destroyers for ever and put them henceforth in your power.
  But I must name my conditions."</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <p>Whatever may have been the historical facts about the decayed family of
  John Conrad, there is no doubt that he entered on the scene of a Committee of
  the State, which was also an audience with the King, with the sort of dignity
  which does not generally appear in the pomposity of footmen. He approached
  the small table in the palace, round which were seated the four chief rulers
  of Pavonia, with a proper gesture of respect but without the least appearance
  of embarrassment or servility. He bowed to the King and accepted the chair in
  which the King asked him to be seated, and it was the King who was more
  embarrassed than the subject. Clovis of Pavonia cleared his throat, looked
  down his nose reflectively for a moment and then said:</p>

  <p>"I hope it is unnecessary for me to add my personal word to any
  arrangements that may have been made. But I am quite prepared to add it, to
  avoid any misunderstanding. It is quite understood that you have consented on
  certain conditions only to reveal what you know, and I shall certainly see
  that those conditions are fulfilled. It is only reasonable, in consideration
  of what you regard yourself as sacrificing, that you should receive a really
  handsome equivalent."</p>

  <p>"May I respectfully ask," inquired Conrad, "who is to decide exactly what
  is an equivalent?"</p>

  <p>"Your Majesty," interposed Colonel Grimm, "I do not believe in beating
  about the bush. We have very little time to spare, if these plotters are
  really about to spring a mine. I don't see how it can be denied that the
  prisoner must be the judge of the equivalent. I have tried to get the truth
  out of him by other methods which he may or may not think he has a right to
  resent; in plain words, by intimidation. It is only just to say that they
  have failed. It is also only just to say that when intimidation fails, there
  is nothing else but bribery. And the plain common sense of it is that he can
  name the bribe."</p>

  <p>The Prime Minister coughed and said a little huskily: "That is rather a
  sweeping statement, but if Mr. Conrad would give us some idea of what he
  would regard as a reasonable settlement. . . ."</p>

  <p>"I shall require," said John Conrad, "nothing less than ten thousand a
  year."</p>

  <p>"Really," said the Prime Minister, in his rather flustered fashion, "this
  sort of thing seems to me quite extravagant. You could do anything you wanted
  to do, in your class of life, on much less."</p>

  <p>"You are wrong," replied Conrad calmly. "My class of life is much more
  exacting than you suppose. I do not see how I could keep up the position of a
  Grand Duke of Pavonia on less."</p>

  <p>"Of a Grand . . ." began Mr. Valence, and his voice seemed to fail and
  fade away.</p>

  <p>"Obviously," said Conrad in a reasonable tone. "It would be a gross
  disrespect to His Majesty, and to the lineage of one of the most ancient
  Royal Houses of Europe, to ask His Majesty to allow his own niece to be
  married to anybody under the rank of a Grand Duke of Pavonia."</p>

  <p>The rest of the company regarded the affable footman much as the King and
  Court may have regarded Perseus when he turned them all to stone. But Grimm
  recovered his voice first with a good gross military oath, followed by a
  demand to know what the devil it was all about.</p>

  <p>"I shall not ask for any formal political office in the government of the
  State," went on the footman thoughtfully. "But it is only reasonable to
  expect that a Grand Duke of Pavonia married to a Royal Princess will have a
  certain amount of influence on the policy of the country. I shall certainly
  insist on a number of essential reforms, especially directed to a juster
  treatment of the poor of this city. Your Majesty and gentlemen, if you are at
  this moment threatened by a thunderbolt from you know not where, and perhaps
  with the overthrow of your whole nation by foreign invasion and internal
  revolt, you have very largely yourselves to thank. I will give up to you
  these revolutionary leaders of whom you talk so much. I will help you to
  capture Dr. Phocus and Sebastian and Loeb and, if possible, even General
  Casc. I will give up my companions, but I will not give up my convictions.
  And when I come to occupy the high national position with which you will
  shortly honour me, I can promise you that though there will be no revolution,
  there will be a very drastic reform."</p>

  <p>The Prime Minister rose to his feet in uncontrollable agitation, for
  professional reformers do not like to hear about drastic reform.</p>

  <p>"These suggestions are intolerable," he cried. "They are fantastic. They
  are not to be listened to for a moment."</p>

  <p>"They are my terms," said Conrad gravely. "I am quite ready to go back to
  prison if you will not accept them. I may say, in so far as I may touch upon
  such things, that the Lady chiefly involved has already accepted them. But I
  am quite ready for you to reject them, and I will go back and wait in my
  prison, and you will sit here and wait in your palace, for you know not
  what."</p>

  <p>There was a long silence and then Colonel Grimm said very softly: "Oh, ten
  million howling devils in hell!"</p>

  <p>The twilight was settling slowly over the long tapestried apartment, of
  which the ancient gold was sufficiently faded to have lost the mere glare of
  vainglory and to take on the grandeur of a rich but reflected flame, as if
  reflected from mirror to mirror down the endless memories of men. In the
  great sprawling tapestry covered with giants, which made the little group of
  modern men look so small at their feet, could be traced the mighty figure of
  Clovis the First going to his last great victory with the peacock fans
  carried before him and the Grand Dukes of Pavonia lifting behind him a forest
  of swords. There was nothing in that room that did not in some way recall the
  unreplaceable achievement of a special civilization; the busts of Pavonian
  poets, who could have written only in the Pavonian tongue, filled the niches
  and corners of the room; the dark glimmer of the bookcases told of a national
  literature not to be lightly lost or possibly replaced, and here and there a
  picture like a little window gave a glimpse of the distant but beloved
  landscapes of their native land. Even the dog that lay before the fire was of
  the breed of their own mountains, and there was not a man there so
  mean&mdash;no, not even the politician&mdash;as not to know that by all these
  things he lived and with all these things he would die. And under all these
  things, they fancied they could hear something like the steady ticking of a
  bomb and they waited for the catch that comes before the deafening death.</p>

  <p>At length, in that silence as of the ages, Clovis the Third spoke for
  Pavonia and all his people, as it was in the days of old. He knew not whether
  it should be called a surrender or a stroke of victory, but he knew it was
  necessary and he spoke with a fullness and firmness of voice which had long
  been rare in him.</p>

  <p>"The time is short," he said, "and there is no other course, I think, but
  to accept your terms. In return, I understand that you do seriously propose
  and promise to stop the activities of the man called Sebastian, of Professor
  Phocus, of Casc and Loeb, as enemies of this State, and to deliver them up to
  us, to deal with them as we will."</p>

  <p>"I promise," said John Conrad, and the King rose suddenly to his feet,
  like one who dissolves an audience.</p>

  <p>Nevertheless, most of the company that had formed the Council broke up in
  a curious condition of mystification and ill-ease. Oddly enough, perhaps, it
  had no reference to the elements in the case that were really extravagant and
  even absurd. The incredible parts of the story seemed to have stunned them
  all into a sort of sobriety, so that they could no longer feel them as
  incredible. It was not the notion of a lackey out of a villa in Peacock
  Crescent becoming a Grand Duke of Pavonia or marrying a Pavonian princess. It
  was not concerned with the contrast between his figure and his fate.
  Curiously enough, it was concerned with the very contrary. After sitting at
  the same table with the mysterious Mr. Conrad, none of them felt any longer
  any particular incongruity between him and such high ambitions. He gave
  rather the impression of a man familiar, not only with high ambitions, but
  with high aspirations. He moved with the indescribable poise of those who
  have never really lost their own social self-respect, and his manners seemed
  quite as fitted to a Court as those of the rough police officer or the rather
  prosaic politician. He had given his word very much as the King had given it,
  as if it were a word of some worth. And it was exactly there that the
  sediment of mystification remained in the mind of many of the company, and it
  was the same sort of doubt that had more deeply disturbed the mind of the
  Princess. It was not that the man did not seem like a Grand Duke, but that he
  did not seem like an informer. However conventional their ideas might be
  about the duties of a citizen, they could not, somehow, understand a man of
  this sort not retaining the darker virtues of a conspirator, or, in more
  popular phrase, the honour that is supposed to exist among thieves. Colonel
  Grimm was a policeman, but he was also a soldier, and there were elements in
  him that did not easily adapt themselves to a gentleman&mdash;especially when
  he was a gentleman&mdash;who turned King's Evidence. As he looked at the
  grave face and rather graceful figure of the ex-flunkey, he, who fancied
  himself a judge of men, thought that he could imagine Conrad more easily as a
  man blowing up the town with dynamite than as a man betraying his
  accomplices.</p>

  <p>Nevertheless, the man's word was given, and Grimm felt certain that he
  would keep it, and heaved a huge sigh of relief on reflecting that they had
  probably seen the last of the power of Casc and Phocus and Sebastian over the
  people of that land. And though the worthy Colonel was in one sense wildly
  wrong about all his calculations in the case, he was, in fact, perfectly
  right in that one.</p>

  <p>He joined John Conrad outside the palace and said to him with military
  brevity: "Well, I suppose we had better leave the next step to you."</p>

  <p>The next step led them together down the long poplar avenue, past the
  outer gates of the palace, across the Fountain Square where stood (now
  somewhat symbolically) the statue of Pavonia the Victorious, down a number of
  genteel by-streets striking outward from the square, and finally into the
  familiar and stately curve of Peacock Crescent. By a coincidence, it was once
  more a night of broad moonshine and the pale façade of that terrace struck
  once more into him a certain chill of mystery, as of one looking at a marble
  mask. But it was not to the line of the familiar houses, or to the door of
  the familiar house, that Colonel Grimm was conducted by his guide. It was
  across the road to the little plot or shrubbery, with the railing round it;
  and, passing through the gate in the railing, they walked in the deep, dim
  grass and under the shadow of the large shrubs. In a place where the grass
  was shorter and smoother, immediately under the shadow of one of the bushes,
  Conrad stooped down and seemed to be moving his finger like one writing in
  the dust.</p>

  <p>"Perhaps you do not know," he said, without lifting his head, "that most
  of the proclamations and phrases in this revolution are jokes. Almost what
  you might call practical jokes; certainly private jokes. There is a sort of
  trap-door or lid that lifts in this place, and that nobody ever found,
  because ordinary openings are roughly round or square or oblong or
  triangular, or some such calculable shape. But you cannot lift this until you
  have traced every curve in an extremely complicated outline. Only it ought to
  be a familiar outline. Only it isn't."</p>

  <p>As he spoke, he appeared to jerk up a certain section of the turf, which
  seemed to be in reality a board with grass growing on top of it, like a large
  flat cap covered with green feathers. But when he held up the green lid so
  that it was black against the moon, the other could perceive that it was of a
  very elaborate outline, indented and diversified as if with capes and
  bays.</p>

  <p>"You ought to know that," he said. "You must have studied it often enough
  in the Atlas, especially the military Atlas. That is the map of Pavonia. And
  <i>that</i>, if you will excuse our little joke, is what we meant when we
  said that we should look for safety to the frontiers."</p>

  <p>Before the Chief of Police could reply, his informant had abruptly
  disappeared with a sort of dive. The earth seemed to have swallowed him up.
  But Grimm heard his reassuring voice coming out of the newly-uncovered abyss,
  and saying cheerily: "Come along down. There's quite an easy ladder. Just
  follow me, and you shall see the last of the men you fear."</p>

  <p>Colonel Grimm stood for a moment like a statue in the moonlight. Then he
  plunged into the black well before him. And indeed, in doing so, he rather
  deserved to have a statue, not merely in the moonlight, but in the sun and
  the sight of men; like the statue of Pavonia Victrix. For he had seldom done
  a braver thing in a life and profession of no little courage. He was unarmed;
  he was alone; he had really very inadequate reasons, when reasonably
  reviewed, for trusting this mysterious mountebank and adventurer, or
  supposing that such a man would keep his promise. But even if he did keep his
  promise, what after all, was his promise? That through this dark entry the
  solitary officer should be led into the very lair of the lion; into the
  presence of the invincible Casc, with his triumvirate of anarchs and the
  devil knew what array of military violence; all apparently established in a
  subterranean empire under the earth. It was hardly a metaphor to say that it
  was like descending into hell; and Grimm, though not given to sentiment,
  could hardly help feeling something sad and symbolic in the fact that the
  aperture above his head, growing smaller and smaller with distance, traced
  upon the dark the glimmering outline of his own country. The last dim light
  out of the sky looked down on him in the shape of Pavonia and then grew dark.
  It was almost as if he were falling through all-annihilating space, and
  Pavonia were a distant star. And indeed, when he came to look back on the
  unnatural wanderings of that night, he was haunted by a sort of contradiction
  in time and especially in space; by a sense that he had in fact travelled
  thousands of miles and covered continents and even worlds; combined with a
  logical certainty, like that of some mathematical fact apparently evaded in a
  mathematical puzzle, that he had really been operating over a comparatively
  small area and close to places that he knew, or (as he told himself somewhat
  bitterly) that he ought to have known. It was doubtless largely the result of
  his fatigue and the final perplexity with which he faced the final mystery;
  but it must be allowed for if we are to understand the dazed and almost
  drugged spirit of discipline in which he took the final phases of the affair.
  He had left something behind him in the upper air of the little garden, and
  he sometimes fancied afterwards that it was the power to laugh.</p>

  <p>The light like a distant star above him disappeared, and he continued to
  descend the ladder, rung by rung, only very vaguely imagining what sort of
  perils or horrors might be below. But whatever he thought of it, it was
  nothing so extraordinary as what he found.</p><hr><br>

  <h2><a name="c046"
     id="c046">VI</a>. &mdash; THE SPEAKING OF THE WORD</h2>

<p class="first">Colonel Grimm of the Pavonian Police was very exactly
described as a
  hard-headed man, and one not easily divorced from reality. It was perhaps all
  the more strongly that he remembered that night as a nightmare. It really had
  the indescribable qualities of a dream; the repetitions and the
  inconsistencies; the scraps of past experience appearing like sudden pictures
  amid the chaos of the formless and unfamiliar; the general sense of having a
  double mind, one sane and the other mad. It was all the more so when his
  subterranean wanderings, beginning in the sunken shaft in the garden, did
  bring him back into what would normally have been called normal scenes. He
  did indeed revisit the glimpses of the moon, but it made him feel all the
  more like Hamlet's father's ghost. He could not help feeling that he was
  revisiting the glimpses of the other side of the moon and had come out on the
  other side of the world. He could not be certain that he had not found an
  outlet under some strange sky, with stars, and moons of its own, and yet
  presenting objects of a mocking familiarity. His first revelation, or rather
  menace of things yet unrevealed, came to him when, after groping through a
  level tunnel, he began to ascend what seemed to be a corresponding ladder in
  a corresponding chimney on the other side. When he was half-way up this
  vertical tunnel, the man ahead of him turned and said in a low and hoarse
  tone: "Stay where you are a moment. I will go on and look round; they won't
  be alarmed at me."</p>

  <p>He remained hanging on the ladder and looking up at a pale disc of light
  like the moon itself, which showed the opening of the well. A moment after
  the disc was darkened, blotted out as by the cap that had covered the
  corresponding hole, but peering up through the dusk, he fancied there was
  something curious about this particular stopper. He flashed on his electric
  torch and nearly fell off the ladder. For the aperture was filled with a face
  peering down at him and grinning like a goblin; a turnip of a face with green
  spectacles which he recognized instantly as that of Professor Phocus. And
  Professor Phocus said, with the horrible distinctness with which things are
  sometimes said in a dream:</p>

  <p>"You won't catch us so easily. We've only to say The Word and the world
  will be destroyed."</p>

  <p>Then the grotesque stopper was taken out of the strange bottle; the disc
  of dull light reappeared; and after a few moments of bewildered waiting, he
  heard the voice of his guide whispering over the brink.</p>

  <p>"He's gone," said Conrad. "You can come up now."</p>

  <p>When he came up, it was to find himself once more in the moonlight and
  apparently somewhere in the back premises of Peacock Crescent. It expresses
  the dazed detachment from daily life which these experiences had somehow
  produced in him, that he was quite surprised to see the police, whom he had
  himself stationed to watch the place, standing round and composedly answering
  the rather conspiratorial signals of Conrad.</p>

  <p>"You can go into the house in a minute," said Conrad in the same low
  voice. "I'll just nip in and see that everything's all right, but I'm sure
  they're all boxed up in there. Bring your men with you, of course."</p>

  <p>He darted into the back of a house, which Grimm fancied was the house next
  door to the original scene of the raid, and for some little time the police
  and their Chief waited patiently outside. They had just begun to consider the
  advisability of following their solitary leader into the den of criminals,
  when they caught their breath and stood still, staring up at the house.</p>

  <p>One of the window blinds was jerked up and there appeared at the window
  the unmistakable face and form which the Princess had beheld upon the café
  table. The poet, Sebastian, stood staring at the moon, in what is supposed to
  be the manner of poets, looking more than usually florid with his flaming red
  moustache and whiskers and a necktie of yet another glowing and romantic
  shade. Then he stretched out his arm to the moon, with a theatrical gesture,
  and seemed to begin to sing, or at least to speak in a sing-song fashion. It
  was impossible to conceive anything more operatic; in the sense in which that
  word is almost synonymous with idiotic. But the words he was chanting were
  familiar:</p>

  <p> </p>

  <blockquote>
    "As Aaron's serpent swallowed snakes and rods,<br>
    As God alone is greater than the gods,<br>
    As all stars shrivel in the single sun,<br>
    The words are many, but The Word is one."
  </blockquote>

  <p> </p>

  <p>Then he suddenly snapped the blind down and vanished, the room behind him
  turning dark. They could hardly believe that the incident, especially so
  senseless an incident, had really happened at all.</p>

  <p>The next moment they were conscious that their creepy friend the
  conspirator had come close to them again in complete silence and was
  whispering:</p>

  <p>"You can go in now and nab them all."</p>

  <p>Grimm, at the head of his stolid policemen, stumped up some stairs and
  along one or two passages and arrived eventually in a large, empty room. It
  was rather a curious room, having one table in the middle, with four chairs
  and four pads of blotting paper, as if arranged for a regular committee. But
  what was much more curious was this: that in each of the four walls of the
  room there was let in a door, with an old brass knocker, as if they were the
  four front doors of separate houses. Each of them bore a notice in large
  letters; one being inscribed "Professor Phocus", another "General Casc", a
  third "Mr. Loeb", and a fourth simply "Sebastian", as with that magnificent
  flourish with which foreign poets sign a single name.</p>

  <p>"This is where they live," said John Conrad, "and I promise you they shall
  not escape."</p>

  <p>Then after a pause he added: "But before we seek them out in their
  separate suites of apartments, I want to talk to you about something. I want
  to talk to you about The Word."</p>

  <p>"I suppose," said the official grimly, "that we are to be allowed to hear
  The Word also, though somebody has just told me that it will destroy the
  world."</p>

  <p>"I do not think it will destroy the world," answered Conrad gravely. "I
  hope it will rather recreate it."</p>

  <p>"Then," said Grimm, "I may take it that when we do know The Word, we
  shan't find that is a joke too."</p>

  <p>"In one sense it's a joke," answered the other. "In one sense when you
  know it, you will know it's a joke. But the joke is that you know it
  already."</p>

  <p>"I'm sure I don't know what you mean by saying so," said the other.</p>

  <p>"You have heard The Word twenty times," said Conrad.</p>

  <p>"You heard it only ten minutes ago. We have shouted and bellowed The Word
  at you all the time, and made it as plain as a placard on the wall. The whole
  secret of this conspiracy is really in one word; only that we've never kept
  it a secret."</p>

  <p>Grimm was looking at him with gleaming eyes under his heavy brows, and
  something like a suspicion was creeping into his face. Conrad repeated very
  seriously, with a slow and heavy enunciation the words:</p>

  <p> </p>

  <blockquote>
    "As all stars shrivel in the single sun . . ."
  </blockquote>

  <p> </p>

  <p>Grimm leapt to his feet with an oath and suddenly made a dash at the door
  labelled "Sebastian".</p>

  <p>"Yes, you've got it," said Conrad with a smile. "It's only a question of
  which word you italicize. Or, if you like, of which word you begin with a big
  letter."</p>

  <p>"The words are many," muttered Grimm, fumbling at the door.</p>

  <p>"Yes," answered the other, "but the word is One."</p>

  <p>Colonel Grimm flung open the door of the poet's suite of apartments and
  found it was a cupboard. It was quite an ordinary shallow cupboard with a few
  hat-pegs, and from these were hanging a red wig, a red artificial beard, a
  scarf of peacock colours and all the externals of the popular poet.</p>

  <p>"All the history of the great revolution," went on John Conrad, in the
  calm tone of a lecturer, "the whole method by which it was enabled to spread
  and menace the great State of Pavonia is and always was to be summed up in a
  single word: a word I constantly repeated, but a word that you never guessed.
  It is the word One."</p>

  <p>He stepped from the table to the door at right angles to the open one; the
  door inscribed with the name of the Professor, and throwing it open, revealed
  another cupboard, with a hat-peg supporting an unnaturally narrow, tall hat,
  a dilapidated waterproof and a bulbous mask bridged by a pair of green
  spectacles.</p>

  <p>"These are the luxurious apartments of the celebrated Professor Phocus,"
  he said. "Need I explain to you that there never was any Professor
  Phocus?&mdash;except myself, of course, who professed to be the Professor. In
  the case of Loeb and Casc I ran rather a greater risk, for they were, or had
  been, real people."</p>

  <p>He paused a moment, rubbing his long chin, and then said:</p>

  <p>"But it's odd how you shrewd policemen blunder by not simply believing
  what you are told. You said that the Pavonian people must all be drilled in a
  wonderful conspiracy; simply because they denied that there was a conspiracy.
  They all agreed in that; so you thought that was conspiracy in itself. As a
  matter of fact they knew nothing, because there was nothing to know. It was
  the same with your international relations. Old General Casc told you again
  and again that he was old, and he was ill and in retirement. And so he is.
  He's in such complete retirement that he hasn't even heard that he is walking
  about the streets of the Pavonian capital in full uniform. But you wouldn't
  believe him, because you wouldn't believe anybody. The Princess herself said
  the poet looked all painted and artificial in his purple whiskers. And that
  would have told you the whole story, if you'd only listened to her. Then
  everybody said, even the King himself, that old Loeb the pawnbroker was dead,
  and so he was. He died years before I began to impersonate him with these
  trifling adornments."</p>

  <p>And he threw open another cupboard, displaying a dusty interior festooned
  as if with cobwebs with the grey whiskers and shabby grey garments attributed
  to the miser.</p>

  <p>"That was the beginning of the whole business. Old Loeb really did take
  this house privately, but for very private reasons; not exactly out of pure
  public spirit; no. I really was his servant, having come down to that sort of
  service, and the only thing I inherited from the old rascal's régime, the
  only thing I didn't invent myself, was the underground passage, which he had
  constructed for himself. As I say, there were no political ideals involved in
  that; odd sort of ladies used it and so on. He was not a nice old gentleman.
  Well, I don't know whether you will enter into the fine shade of my feelings,
  but, although I was starving and ready to be a scavenger, yet three years in
  the service of a sensual usurer left me in a rather revolutionary state of
  mind. It seemed to me that the world, as seen from that particular sewer, by
  that particular scavenger, was rather an ugly place. So I decided to have a
  revolution. Or rather, I decided to be a revolution. It was all very easy,
  really, if one did it slowly and with a little tact and imagination. I built
  up the characters of four quite different public men, two of them quite
  imaginary. You never saw any two of them at the same moment, and you never
  noticed it. When they were supposed to gather for their periodical dinner, I
  had only to put on one disguise after the other and go round behind the
  scenes, so to speak, in the underground passage, so that they only seemed to
  turn up one after another in a leisurely fashion. For the rest, you've no
  notion how easy it is to bamboozle a really enlightened, educated modern
  town, used to newspapers and all that. It was only necessary for each person
  to have a vast, vague reputation, more or less foreign. When Professor Phocus
  wrote learned letters to the papers, with half the alphabet after his name,
  nobody was going to admit they had never heard of the famous Professor
  Phocus. When Sebastian said he was the greatest poet in modern Europe,
  everybody felt that he ought to know. And if you get three or four names of
  that sort nowadays, you have got everything. There never was a time in
  history when the few counted for so much, and the many for so little. When
  the newspapers say 'The nation is behind Mr. Binks', it means that about
  three newspaper proprietors are behind him. When the professors say 'The
  opinion of Europe has now accepted the Gollywog theory', it means that about
  four professors in Germany have accepted it. The moment I'd got my
  millionaire and my man of science, I knew I was pretty safe; but the poet was
  a pleasing ornament and I knew the threat of the foreign general would throw
  you all into fits. By the way," he added apologetically, "I have not shown
  you the magnificent apartments of General Casc, but it's only the uniform.
  The rest consists chiefly of blacking."</p>

  <p>"Quite so," said Colonel Grimm, politely. "I will excuse you from
  exhibiting the blacking. And now, what is to happen?"</p>

  <p>The chief conspirator seemed to be still sunken in a sort of reverie. At
  last he said:</p>

  <p>"I felt that all revolutions had failed through treason or disunion among
  the revolutionists. I resolved that the others should not betray me. I did
  not foresee that I might betray the others. But after all, this rebellion has
  also ended in betrayal. Colonel Grimm, I give up my confederates. The great
  poet Sebastian is captured and hanged; the great soldier Casc is captured and
  hanged; Phocus and Loeb are captured and hanged. You can see them hanging-on
  hat-pegs."</p>

  <p>Then he added, with a bow of profound modesty:</p>

  <p>"But their humble tool, John Conrad, has the pardon of the King."</p>

  <p>Grimm once more sprang erect with a ringing curse which cracked and turned
  to a laugh. Then he said:</p>

  <p>"John Conrad, you are a devil, but I shouldn't wonder if you brought it
  off after all. Clovis the Third may have forgotten that he is still a king,
  but somewhere in his stale memories he remembers that he is still a
  gentleman. Go on your way, Grand Duke of Pavonia; it is possible that you
  know the way to go! After all, you have done what you said you would do, and
  kept your own word in your own way."</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Conrad, with a new sobriety, "it is the only thing worth
  calling The Word."</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <p>It has been already explained that Pavonia possessed a modern and
  enlightened Government; and in the light of this fact it may seem a strain on
  the reader's credulity to say that it did actually keep its word to the
  eccentric footman. The politicians and the financiers made some difficulties,
  feeling that the keeping of promises must not become a habit. But for once
  the King put his foot down, not without a faint and far-off jingle of the
  ancient spurs and sword. He said it was a point of purely personal honour,
  but there was a rumour that his niece had a good deal to do with it.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a name="e01"
     id="e01">EPILOGUE OF THE PRESSMAN</a></h2>

  <p class="first">The Thief, the Quack, the Murderer and the Traitor, had
made their
  confessions of crime to Mr. Pinion of the <i>Comet</i> somewhat more briefly
  and personally than the same tales have been recorded here. Nevertheless,
  they took a tolerably long time from start to finish, and throughout the
  whole of that time Mr. Pinion had preserved an air of polite attention and
  had not interrupted by so much as a word.</p>

  <p>When they were over, he coughed slightly and said: "Well, gentlemen, I'm
  sure I've been very much interested in your remarkable narratives. But I
  suppose most of us get misrepresented a bit from time to time. I hope you'll
  do me the honour, gentlemen, of allowing that I haven't pumped you, or
  prompted you, or stuck my oar in anyway, but have enjoyed your hospitality
  without taking advantage of it."</p>

  <p>"I am sure," said the doctor heartily, "nobody could possibly have been
  more patient and considerate."</p>

  <p>"I only ask," proceeded Mr. Pinion, in his gentle tones, "because in the
  newspaper world of my own country I am known as the Bloody Battering-Ram,
  also the Home-Wrecker, the Heart-Searcher and occasionally as Jack the
  Ripper, because of my unscrupulous ripping-up of the most sacred secrets of
  private life. Headlines such as 'Bull-Dog Pinion Pins President', or
  'Home-Wrecker Has Scalp of Screaming Secretary', are common on the brighter
  news-pages of my native state. The story is still told of how I hung on to
  Judge Grogan by one leg, when he was climbing into the aeroplane."</p>

  <p>"Well," said the doctor, "I own I never should have guessed it of you.
  Nobody would think you'd ever done a thing like that."</p>

  <p>"I never did," replied Mr. Pinion calmly. "Judge Grogan and I had a
  perfectly friendly conversation at his own country residence at his own
  request. But each of us has got to keep up his own professional reputation,
  whether it's as a Murderer, a Robber or a Reporter."</p>

  <p>"Do you mean," asked the big man intervening, "that you didn't really
  batter or wreck or rip anything or anybody?"</p>

  <p>"Well, not quite so much as you murdered anybody," answered the American
  in his guarded tone. "But I have to let on that I've been horribly rude to
  everybody, or I'd lose my professional prestige and perhaps my job. As a
  matter of fact, I generally find I can get anything I want by being polite.
  My experience is," he added mildly and gravely, "that most folks are only too
  ready to talk about themselves."</p>

  <p>The four men around him looked at each other and then broke into a
  laugh.</p>

  <p>"That's certainly one for us," said the doctor. "You've certainly got our
  stories out of us and done it by being perfectly polite. Do you really mean
  to say that if you publish them, you'd have to pretend you could only do it
  by being rude?"</p>

  <p>"I guess so," said Mr. Pinion, nodding gravely. "If I publish your story,
  I'd have to say I broke down the door of Dr. Judson's surgery as he was
  bandaging somebody with his throat cut, and just wouldn't let him finish till
  he'd told me his life-story. I'd have to pretend Mr. Nadoway was just off to
  his dying mother, when I boarded his car and got his views on Capital versus
  Labour. I'd be obliged to burgle the third gentleman's house or wreck the
  fourth gentleman's train, or do something to show my editor I'm a real live
  wire of a reporter. Of course you never need to do it really, you can do most
  things by decent manners and talking to people at appropriate times. Or
  rather," and he again suppressed a smile, "letting them talk to you."</p>

  <p>"Do you think," asked the big man thoughtfully, "that that sort of
  sensationalism really impresses the public?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know," said the journalist. "I should rather think not. It
  impresses the editor, and that's what I've got to think about."</p>

  <p>"But, if you'll excuse me, don't you mind yourself," pursued the other.
  "Don't you mind everybody from Maine to Mexico calling you a Bloody
  Battering-Ram when you're really a perfectly normal and well-educated
  gentleman?"</p>

  <p>"Well," said the journalist, "I suppose, as I say, that most of us are
  misunderstood one way or another."</p>

  <p>There was a momentary silence at the table, and then Dr. Judson turned in
  his chair with a sort of jerk and said:</p>

  <p>"Gentlemen, I beg to propose Mr. Lee Pinion as a member of the Club."</p>
