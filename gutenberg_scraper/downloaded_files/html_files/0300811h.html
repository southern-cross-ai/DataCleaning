<h2>FOREWORD</h2>

<p>It would be a great pleasure to thank, by name, the many
persons, both Indian and English, who have so courteously
facilitated my access to information, to records, and to those
places and things that I desired to see for myself. But the facts
that it was impossible to forecast the conclusions I should reach,
and that for these conclusions they are in no way responsible, make
it improper to embarrass them now by connecting them personally
therewith.</p>

<p>For this reason the manuscript of this book has not been
submitted to any member of the Government of India, nor to any
Briton or Indian connected with official life. It has, however,
been reviewed by certain public health authorities of international
eminence who are familiar with the Indian field.</p>

<p>I may, on the other hand, express my deep indebtedness to my two
friends, Miss M. Moyca Newell and Harry Hubert Field, the one for
her constant and invaluable collaboration, the other for a
helpfulness, both in India and here, beyond either limit or
thanks.</p>

<h1>PART I</h1>

<h2>INTRODUCTION: THE BUS TO MANDALAY</h2>

<p>Calcutta, second largest city in the British Empire, spread
along the Ganges called Hooghly, at the top of the Bay of Bengal.
Calcutta, big, western, modern, with public buildings, monuments,
parks, gardens, hospitals, museums, University, courts of law,
hotels, offices, shops, all of which might belong to a prosperous
American city; and all backed by an Indian town of temples,
mosques, bazaars and intricate courtyards and alleys that has
somehow created itself despite the rectangular lines shown on the
map. In the courts and alleys and bazaars many little bookstalls,
where narrow-chested, near-sighted, anaemic young Bengali students,
in native dress, brood over piles of fly-blown Russian
pamphlets.</p>

<p>Rich Calcutta, wide-open door to the traffic of the world and
India, traffic of bullion, of jute, of cotton--of all that India
and the world want out of each other's hands. Decorous,
sophisticated Calcutta, where decorous and sophisticated people of
all creeds, all colors and all costumes go to Government House
Garden Parties, pleasantly to make their bows to Their
Excellencies, and pleasantly to talk good English while they take
their tea and ices and listen to the regimental band.</p>

<p>You cannot see the street from Government House Gardens, for the
walls are high. But if you could, you would see it filled with
traffic--motor traffic, mostly--limousines, touring cars, taxis and
private machines. And rolling along among them now and again, a
sort of Fifth Avenue bus, bearing the big-lettered label, "Kali
Ghat."</p>

<p>This bus, if you happen to notice it, proceeds along the
parkside past the Empire Theater, the various clubs, St. Paul's
Cathedral, past the Bishop's House, the General Hospital, the
London Missionary Society's Institution, and presently comes to a
stop in a rather congested quarter, which is its destination as
advertised.</p>

<p>"Kali Ghat"--"place of Kali"--is the root-word of the name
Calcutta. Kali is a Hindu goddess, wife of the great god Siva,
whose attribute is destruction and whose thirst is for blood and
death-sacrifice. Her spiritual domination of the world began about
five thousand years ago, and should last nearly four hundred and
thirty-two thousand years to come.</p>

<p>Kali has thousands of temples in India, great and small. This of
Calcutta is the private property of a family of Brahmans who have
owned it for some three centuries. A round hundred of these, "all
sons of one father," share its possession today. And one of the
hundred obligingly led me, with a Brahman friend, through the
precincts. Let him be called Mr. Haldar, for that is the family's
name.</p>

<p>But for his white petticoat-drawers and his white toga, the
usual Bengali costume, Mr. Haldar might have been taken for a
well-groomed northern Italian gentleman. His English was polished
and his manner entirely agreeable.</p>

<p>Five hundred and ninety acres, tax free, constitute the temple
holding, he said. Pilgrims from far and near, with whom the shrine
is always crowded, make money offerings. There are also priestly
fees to collect. And the innumerable booths that shoulder each
other up and down the approaches, booths where sweetmeats, holy
images, marigold flowers, amulets, and votive offerings are sold,
bring in a sound income.</p>

<p>Rapidly cleaving a way through the coming and going mass of the
devotees, Mr. Haldar leads us to the temple proper. A high
platform, roofed and pillared, approached on three sides by tiers
of steps of its own length and width. At one end, a deep,
semi-enclosed shrine in which, dimly half-visible, looms the figure
of the goddess. Black of face she is, with a monstrous lolling
tongue, dripping blood. Of her four hands, one grasps a bleeding
human head, one a knife, the third, outstretched, cradles blood,
the fourth, raised in menace, is empty. In the shadows close about
her feet stand the priests ministrant.</p>

<p>On the long platform before the deity, men and women prostrate
themselves in vehement supplication. Among them stroll lounging
boys, sucking lollypops fixed on sticks. Also, a white bull-calf
wanders, while one reverend graybeard in the midst of it all,
squatting cross-legged on the pavement before a great book, lifts
up a droning voice. <a name="page6" id="page6"></a></p>

<p>"He," said Mr. Haldar, "is reading to the worshipers from our
Hindu mythology. The history of Kali."</p>

<p>Of a sudden, a piercing outburst of shrill bleating. We turn the
corner of the edifice to reach the open courtyard at the end
opposite the shrine. Here stand two priests, one with a cutlass in
his hand, the other holding a young goat. The goat shrieks, for in
the air is that smell that all beasts fear. A crash of sound, as
before the goddess drums thunder. The priest who holds the goat
swings it up and drops it, stretched by the legs, its screaming
head held fast in a cleft post. The second priest with a single
blow of his cutlass decapitates the little creature. The blood
gushes forth on the pavement, the drums and the gongs before the
goddess burst out wildly. "Kali! Kali! Kali!" shout all the priests
and the suppliants together, some flinging themselves face downward
on the temple floor.</p>

<p>Meantime, and instantly, a woman who waited behind the killers
of the goat has rushed forward and fallen on all fours to lap up
the blood with her tongue--"in the hope of having a child." And now
a second woman, stooping, sops at the blood with a cloth, and
thrusts the cloth into her bosom, while half a dozen sick, sore
dogs, horribly misshapen by nameless diseases, stick their hungry
muzzles into the lengthening pool of gore.</p>

<p>"In this manner we kill here from one hundred and fifty to two
hundred kids each day," says Mr. Haldar with some pride. "The
worshipers supply the kids."</p>

<p>Now he leads us among the chapels of minor deities--that of the
little red goddess of smallpox, side by side with her littler red
twin who dispenses chicken pox or not, according to humor; that of
the five-headed black cobra who wears a tiny figure of a priest
beneath his chin, to whom those make offerings who fear snakebite;
that of the red monkey-god, to whom wrestlers do homage before the
bout; that to which rich merchants and students of the University
pray, before confronting examinations or risking new ventures in
trade; that of "the Universal God," a mask, only, like an Alaskan
totem. And then the ever-present phallic emblem of Siva, Kali's
husband. Before them all, little offerings of marigold blossoms, or
of red wads of something in baskets trimmed with shells, both of
which may be had at the temple booths, at a price, together with
sacred cakes made of the dung of the temple bulls.</p>

<p>Mr. Haldar leads us through a lane down which, neatly arranged
in rows, sit scores of more or less naked holy men and mendicants,
mostly fat and hairy and covered with ashes, begging. All are eager
to be photographed. <i>Saddhus--</i>reverend ascetics--spring up
and pose. One, a madman, flings himself at us, badly scaring a
little girl who is being towed past by a young man whose wrist is
tied to her tiny one by the two ends of a scarf. "Husband and new
wife," says Mr. Haldar. "They come to pray for a son."</p>

<p>We proceed to the temple burning-ghat. A burning is in progress.
In the midst of an open space an oblong pit, dug in the ground.
This is now half filled with sticks of wood. On the ground, close
by, lies a rather beautiful young Indian woman, relaxed as though
in a swoon. Her long black hair falls loose around her, a few
flowers among its meshes. Her forehead, her hands and the soles of
her feet are painted red, showing that she is blessed among women,
in that she is saved from widowhood--her husband survives her. The
relatives, two or three men and a ten-year-old boy, standing near,
seem uninterested. Crouching at a distance, one old woman, keening.
Five or six beggars like horse-flies nagging about.</p>

<p>Now they take up the body and lay it on the pile of wood in the
pit. The woman's head turns and one arm drops, as though she moved
in her sleep. She died only a few hours ago. They heap sticks of
wood over her, tossing it on until it rises high. Then the little
boy, her son, walks seven times around the pyre, carrying a torch.
After that he throws the torch into the wood, flames and smoke rush
up, and the ceremony is done.</p>

<p>"With a good fire everything burns but the navel," explains Mr.
Haldar. "That is picked out of the ashes, by the temple attendants,
and, with a gold coin provided by the dead person's family, is
rolled in a ball of clay and flung into the Ganges. We shall now
see the Ganges."</p>

<p>Again he conducts us through the crowds to a point below the
temple, where runs a muddy brook, shallow and filled with bathers.
"This," says Mr. Haldar, "is the most ancient remaining outlet of
the Ganges. Therefore its virtues are accounted great. Hundreds of
thousands of sick persons come here annually to bathe and be cured
of their sickness just as you see those doing now. Also, such as
would supplicate the goddess for other reasons bathe here first, to
be cleansed of their sins."</p>

<p>As the bathers finished their ablutions, they drank of the water
that lapped their knees. Then most of them devoted a few moments to
grubbing with their hands in the bottom, bringing up handfuls of
mud which they carefully sorted over in their palms. "Those," said
Mr. Haldar, "are looking for the gold coins flung in from the
burning-ghat. They hope."</p>

<p>Meantime, up and down the embankment, priests came and went,
each leading three or four kids, which they washed in the stream
among the bathers and then dragged back, screaming and struggling,
toward the temple forecourt. And men and women bearing water-jars,
descending and ascending, filled their jars in the stream and
disappeared by the same path.</p>

<p>"Each kid," continued Mr. Haldar, "must be purified in the holy
stream before it is slain. As for the water-carriers, they bring
the water as an offering. It is poured over Kali's feet, and over
the feet of the priests that stand before her.'*</p>

<p>As Mr. Haldar took leave of us, just at the rear of the outer
temple wall, I noticed a drain-hole about the size of a man's hand,
piercing the wall at the level of the ground. By this hole, on a
little flat stone, lay a few marigold flowers, a few rose-petals, a
few pennies. As I looked, suddenly out of the hole gushed a flow of
dirty water, and a woman, rushing up, thrust a cup under it and
drank.</p>

<p>"That is our holy Ganges water, rendered more holy by having
flowed over the feet of Kali and her priests. From the floor of the
shrine it is carried here by this ancient drain. It is found most
excellent against dysentery and enteric fever. The sick who have
strength to move drink it here, first having bathed in the Ganges.
To those too ill to come, their friends may carry it."</p>

<p>So we found our waiting motor and rolled away, past the General
Hospital, the Bishop's House, the various Clubs, the Empire
Theater, straight into the heart of Calcutta in a few minutes'
time.</p>

<p>"Why did you go to Kali Ghat? That is not India. Only the lowesc
and most ignorant of Indians are Kali worshipers," said an English
Theosophist, sadly, next day.</p>

<p>I repeated the words to one of the most learned and
distinguished of Bengali Brahmans. His comment was this:</p>

<p class="quote">"Your English friend is wrong. It is true that in
the lower castes the percentage of worshipers of Kali is larger
than the percentage of the worshipers of Vishnu, perhaps because
the latter demands some self-restraint, such as abstinence from
intoxicants. But hundreds of thousands of Brahmans, everywhere,
worship Kali, and the devotees at Kali Ghat will include Hindus of
all castes and conditions, among whom are found some of the most
highly educated and important personages of this town and of
India." <a name="ch-1" id="ch-1"></a></p>

<h2>CHAPTER I - THE ARGUMENT</h2>

<p>The area we know as India is nearly half as large as the United
States. Its population is three times greater than ours. Its import
and export trade--as yet but the germ of the possible--amounted, in
the year 1924-25, to about two and a half billion dollars.[1] And
Bombay is but three weeks' journey from New York.</p>

<blockquote>[1. <i>Review of the Trade of India In 1924-25,</i>
Department of Commercial Intelligence and Statistics, Calcutta,
1926, p. 51.]</blockquote>

<p>Under present conditions of human activity, whereby, whether we
will or no, the roads that join us to every part of the world
continually shorten and multiply, it would appear that some
knowledge of main facts concerning so big and today so near a
neighbor should be a part of our intelligence and our
self-protection.</p>

<p>But what does the average American actually know about India?
That Mr. Gandhi lives there<i>;</i> also tigers. His further ideas,
if such he has, resolve themselves into more or less hazy notions
more or less unconsciously absorbed from professional propagandists
out of one camp or another; from religious or mystical sources; or
from tales and travel-books, novels and verses, having India as
their scene.</p>

<p>It was dissatisfaction with this status that sent me to India,
to see what a volunteer unsubsidized, uncommitted, and unattached,
could observe of common things in daily human life.</p>

<p>Leaving untouched the realms of religion, of politics, and of
the arts, I would confine my inquiry to such workaday ground as
public health and its contributing factors. I would try to
determine, for example, what situation would confront a public
health official charged with the duty of stopping an epidemic of
cholera or of plague; what elements would work for and against a
campaign against hookworm; or what forces would help or hinder a
governmental effort to lower infant mortality, to better living
conditions, or to raise educational levels, supposing such work to
be required.</p>

<p>None of these points could well be wrapped in "eastern mystery,"
and all concern the whole family of nations in the same way that
the sanitary practices of John Smith of 23 Main Street concern
Peter Jones at the other end of the block.</p>

<p>Therefore, in early October, 1925, I went to London, called at
India Office, and, a complete stranger, stated my plan.</p>

<p>"What would you like us to do for you?" asked the gentlemen who
received me.</p>

<p>"Nothing," I answered, "except to believe what I say. A foreign
stranger prying about India, not studying ancient architecture, not
seeking philosophers or poets, not even hunting big game, and
commissioned by no one, anywhere, may seem a queer figure.
Especially if that stranger develops an acute tendency to ask
questions. I should like it to be accepted that I am neither an
idle busybody nor a political agent, but merely an ordinary
American citizen seeking test facts to lay before my own
people."</p>

<p>To such Indians as I met, whether then or later, I made the same
statement. In the period that followed, the introductions that both
gave me, coupled with the untiring courtesy and helpfulness alike
of Indians and of British, official or private, all over India,
made possible a survey more thorough than could have been
accomplished in five times the time without such aid.</p>

<p>"But whatever you do, be careful not to generalize," the British
urged. "In this huge country little or nothing is everywhere true.
Madras and Peshawar, Bombay and Calcutta--attribute the things of
one of these to any one of the others, and you are out of
court."</p>

<p>Those journeys I made, plus many another up and down and across
the land. Everywhere I talked with health officers, both Indian and
British, of all degrees, going out with them into their respective
fields, city or rural, to observe their tasks and their ways of
handling them. I visited hospitals of many sorts and localities,
talked at length with the doctors, and studied conditions and
cases. I made long sorties in the open country from the North-West
Frontier to Madras, sometimes accompanying a district commissioner
on his tours of checkered duty, sometimes "sitting in" at village
councils of peasants, or at Indian municipal board meetings, or at
court sessions with their luminous parade of life. I went with
English nurses into bazaars and courtyards and inner chambers and
over city roofs, visiting where need called. I saw, as well, the
homes of the rich. I studied the handling of confinements, the care
of children and of the sick, the care and protection of food, and
the values placed upon cleanliness. I noted the personal habits of
various castes and grades, in travel or at home, in daily life. I
visited agricultural stations and cattle-farms, and looked into the
general management of cattle and crops. I investigated the animal
sanctuaries provided by Indian piety. I saw the schools, and
discussed with teachers and pupils their aims and experience. The
sittings of the various legislatures, all-India and provincial,
repaid attendance by the light they shed upon the mind-quality of
the elements represented. I sought and found private opportunity to
question eminent Indians--princes, politicians, administrators,
religious leaders; and the frankness of their talk, as to the
mental and physical status and conditions of the peoples of India,
thrown out upon the background of my personal observation, proved
an asset of the first value.</p>

<p>And just this excellent Indian frankness finally led me to think
that, after all, there are perhaps certain points on which--south,
north, east and west--you <i>can</i> generalize about India. Still
more: that you can generalize about the only matters in which we of
the busy West will, to a man, see our own concern.</p>

<p>John Smith of 23 Main Street may care little enough about the
ancestry of Peter Jones, and still less about his religion, his
philosophy, or his views on art. But if Peter cultivates habits of
living and ways of thinking that make him a physical menace not
only to himself and his family, but to all the rest of the block,
then practical John will want details.</p>

<p>"Why," ask modern Indian thinkers, "why, after all the long
years of British rule, are we still marked among the peoples of the
world for our ignorance, our poverty, and our monstrous death rate?
By what right are light and bread and life denied?"</p>

<p>"What this country suffers from is want of initiative, want of
enterprise, and want of hard, sustained work," mourns Sir Chimanlal
Setalvad.[2] "We rightly charge the English rulers for our
helplessness and lack of initiative and originality," says Mr.
Gandhi.[3]</p>

<blockquote>[3. <i>Young India,</i> March 25, 1926, p. 112. This is
Mr. Gandhi's weekly publication from which much hereinafter will be
quoted.]</blockquote>

<p>Other public men demand:</p>

<p class="quote">"Why are our enthusiasms so sterile? Why are our
mutual pledges, our self-dedications to brotherhood and the cause
of liberty so soon spent and forgotten? Why is our manhood itself
so brief? Why do we tire so soon and die so young?" Only to answer
themselves with the cry: "Our spiritual part is wounded and
bleeding. Our very souls are poisoned by the shadow of the arrogant
stranger, blotting out our sun. Nothing can be done--nothing,
anywhere, but to mount the political platform and faithfully
denounce our tyrant until he takes his flight. When Britain has
abdicated and gone, then, and not till then, free men breathing
free air, may we turn our minds to the lesser needs of our dear
Mother India."</p>

<p>Now it is precisely at this point, and in a spirit of hearty
sympathy with the suffering peoples, that I venture my main
generality. It is this:</p>

<p>The British administration of India, be it good, bad, or
indifferent, has nothing whatever to do with the conditions above
indicated. Inertia, helplessness, lack of initiative and
originality, lack of staying power and of sustained loyalties,
sterility of enthusiasm, weakness of life-vigor itself--all are
traits that truly characterize the Indian not only of today, but of
long-past history. All, furthermore, will continue to characterize
him, in increasing degree, until he admits their causes and with
his own two hands uproots them. His soul and body are indeed
chained in slavery. But he himself wields and hugs his chains and
with violence defends them. No agency but a new spirit within his
own breast can set him free. And his arraignments of outside
elements, past, present, or to come, serve only to deceive his own
mind and to put off the day of his deliverance.</p>

<p>Take a girl child twelve years old, a pitiful physical specimen
in bone and blood, illiterate, ignorant, without any sort of
training in habits of health. Force motherhood upon her at the
earliest possible moment. Rear her weakling son in intensive
vicious practices that drain his small vitality day by day. Give
him no outlet in sports. Give him habits that make him, by the time
he is thirty years of age, a decrepit and querulous old wreck--and
will you ask what has sapped the energy of his manhood?</p>

<p>Take a huge population, mainly rural, illiterate and loving its
illiteracy. Try to give it primary education without employing any
of its women as teachers--because if you do employ them you invite
the ruin of each woman that you so expose. Will you ask why that
people's education proceeds slowly?</p>

<p>Take bodies and minds bred and built on the lines thus
indicated. Will you ask why the death rate is high and the people
poor?</p>

<p>Whether British or Russians or Japanese sit in the seat of the
highest; whether the native princes divide the land, reviving old
days of princely dominance; or whether some autonomy more complete
than that now existing be set up, the only power that can hasten
the pace of Indian development toward freedom, beyond the pace it
is traveling today, is the power of the men of India, wasting no
more time in talk, recriminations, and shiftings of blame, but
facing and attacking, with the best resolution they can muster, the
task that awaits them in their own bodies and souls.</p>

<p>This subject has not, I believe, been presented in common print.
The Indian does not confront it in its entirety; he knows its
component parts, but avoids the embarrassment of assembling them or
of drawing their essential inferences. The traveler in India misses
it, having no occasion to delve below the picturesque surface into
living things as they are. The British official will especially
avoid it--will deprecate its handling by others. His own daily
labors, since the Reforms of 1919, hinge upon persuasion rather
than upon command; therefore his hopes of success, like his orders
from above, impose the policy of the gentle word. Outside agencies
working for the moral welfare of the Indian seem often to have
adopted the method of encouraging their beneficiary to dwell on his
own merits and to harp upon others' shortcomings, rather than to
face his faults and conquer them. And so, in the midst of an
agreement of silence or flattery, you find a sick man growing daily
weaker, dying, body and brain, of a disease that only himself can
cure, and with no one, anywhere, enough his friend to hold the
mirror up and show him plainly what is killing him.</p>

<p>In shouldering this task myself, I am fully aware of the
resentments I shall incur: of the accusations of muck-raking; of
injustice; of material-mindedness; of lack of sympathy; of
falsehood perhaps; perhaps of prurience. But the fact of having
seen conditions and their bearings, and of being in a position to
present them, would seem to deprive one of the right to indulge a
personal reluctance to incur consequences.</p>

<p>Here, in the beginning of this book, therefore, stands the
kernel of what seems to me the most important factor in the life
and future of one-eighth of the human race. In the pages to come
will be found an attempt to widen the picture, stretching into
other fields and touching upon other aspects of Indian life. But in
no field, in no aspect, can that life escape the influences of its
inception. <a name="ch-2" id="ch-2"></a></p>

<h2>CHAPTER II - "SLAVE MENTALITY"</h2>

<p>"Let us not put off everything until Swaraj[1] is attained and
thus put off Swaraj itself," pleads Gandhi. "Swaraj can be had only
by brave and clean people." [2]</p>

<blockquote>[1. Self-government.]</blockquote>

<blockquote>[2. <i>Young India,</i> Nov. 19, 1925, p.
399.]</blockquote>

<p>But, in these days of the former leader's waned influence, it is
not for such teachings that he gains ears. From every political
platform stream flaming protests of devotion to the death to Mother
India; but India's children fit no action to their words. Poor
indeed she is, and sick--ignorant and helpless. But, instead of
flinging their strength to her rescue, her ablest sons, as they
themselves lament, spend their time in quarrels together or else
lie idly weeping over their own futility.</p>

<p>Meantime the British Government, in administering the affairs of
India, would seem to have reached a set rate of progress, which, if
it be not seriously interrupted, might fairly be forecast decade by
decade. So many schools constructed, so many hospitals; so many
furlongs of highway laid, so many bridges built; so many hundred
miles of irrigation canal dug; so many markets made available; so
many thousand acres of waste land brought under homestead
cultivation; so many wells sunk; so much rice and wheat and millet
and cotton added to the country's food and trade resources.</p>

<p>This pace of advance, compared to the huge needs of the country,
or compared to like movements in the United States or in Canada, is
slow. To hasten it materially, one single element would
suffice--the hearty, hard-working and intelligent devotion to the
practical job itself, of the educated Indian. Today, however, few
signs appear, among Indian public men, of concern for the status of
the masses, while they curse the one power which, however little to
their liking, is doing practically all of whatever is done for the
comfort of sad old Mother India.</p>

<p>The population of all India is reckoned, in round numbers, to be
319,000,000.[3] Setting aside Indian States ruled by Indian
princes, that of British India is 247,000,000. Among these peoples
live fewer than 200,000 Europeans, counting every man, woman and
child in the land, from the Viceroy down to the haberdasher's baby.
The British personnel of the Army, including all ranks, numbers
fewer than 60,000 men. The British Civilian cadre, inclusive of the
Civil Service, the medical men, the engineers, foresters, railway
administrators, mint, assay, educational, agricultural and
veterinary experts, etc., etc., totals 3,432 men. Of the Indian
Police Service, the British membership approximates 4,000. This
last figure excludes the subordinate and provincial services, in
which the number of Europeans is, however, negligible.</p>

<blockquote>[3. <i>The Indian Year Book, Times</i> Press, Bombay,
1926, p. 13.]</blockquote>

<p>Representing the British man-power in India today, you therefore
have these figures:</p>

<pre>
Army             60,000
Civil Services    3,432
Police            4,000
TOTAL            67,432
</pre>

<p>This is the entire local strength of the body to whose
oppressive presence the Indian attributes what he himself describes
as the "slave mentality" of 247,000,000 human beings.</p>

<p>But one must not overlook the fact that, back of Britain's day,
India was ever either a chaos of small wars and brigandage, chief
preying upon chief, and all upon the people; or else she was the
flaccid subject of a foreign rule. If, once and again, a native
king arose above the rest and spread his sway, the reign of his
house was short, and never covered all of India. Again and again
conquering forces came sweeping through the mountain passes down
out of Central Asia. And the ancient Hindu stock, softly absorbing
each recurrent blow, quivered--and lay still.</p>

<p>Many a reason is advanced to account for these things, as, the
devitalizing character of the Hindu religion, with its teachings of
the nothingness of things as they seem, of the infinitude of
lives--dreams all--to follow this present seeming. And this
element, beyond doubt, plays its part. But we, as "hard-headed
Americans," may, for a beginning, put such matters aside while we
consider points on which we shall admit less room for debate and
where we need no interpreter and no glossary.</p>

<p>The whole pyramid of the Hindu's woes, material and
spiritual--poverty, sickness, ignorance, political minority,
melancholy, ineffectiveness, not forgetting that subconscious
conviction of inferiority which he forever bares and advertises by
his gnawing and imaginative alertness for social affronts--rests
upon a rock-bottom physical base. This base is, simply, his manner
of getting into the world and his sex-life thenceforward.</p>

<p>In the great orthodox Hindu majority, the girl looks for
motherhood nine months after reaching puberty[4]--or anywhere
between the ages of fourteen, and eight The latter age is extreme,
although in some sections not exceptional; the former is well above
the average. Because of her years and upbringing and because
countless generations behind her have been bred even as she, she is
frail of body. She is also completely unlettered, her stock of
knowledge comprising only the ritual of worship of the household
idols, the rites of placation of the wrath of deities and evil
spirits, and the detailed ceremony of the service of her husband,
who is ritualistically her personal god.</p>

<blockquote>[4. Cf. <i>post.,</i> Chapter IV.]</blockquote>

<p>As to the husband, he may be a child scarcely older than herself
or he may be a widower of fifty, when first he requires of her his
conjugal rights. In any case, whether from immaturity or from
exhaustion, he has small vitality to transmit.</p>

<p>The little mother goes through a destructive pregnancy, ending
in a confinement whose peculiar tortures will not be imagined
unless in detail explained.</p>

<p>The infant that survives the birth-strain--a feeble creature at
best, bankrupt in bone-stuff and vitality, often venereally
poisoned, always predisposed to any malady that may be afloat--must
look to his child-mother for care. Ignorant of the laws of hygiene,
guided only by the most primitive superstitions, she has no helpers
in her task other than the older women of the household, whose
knowledge, despite their years, is little greater than hers.
Because of her place in the social system, child-bearing and
matters of procreation are the woman's one interest in life, her
one subject of conversation, be her caste high or low. Therefore,
the child growing up in the home learns, from earliest grasp of
word and act, to dwell upon sex relations.</p>

<p>Siva, one of the greatest of the Hindu deities, is represented,
on highroad shrines, in the temples, on the little altar of the
home, or in personal amulets, by the image of the male generative
organ, in which shape he receives the daily sacrifices of the
devout. The followers of Vishnu, multitudinous in the south, from
their childhood wear painted upon their foreheads the sign of the
function of generation.[5] And although it is accepted that the
ancient inventors of these and kindred emblems intended them as
aids to the climbing of spiritual heights, practice and extremely
detailed narratives of the intimacies of the gods, preserved in the
hymns of the fireside, give them literal meaning and suggestive
power, as well as religious sanction in the common mind.[6]</p>

<blockquote>[5. Fanciful interpretations of this symbol are
sometimes given.]</blockquote>

<blockquote>[6. <i>Hindu Manners, Customs and Ceremonies,</i>
Abb&eacute; J. A. Dubois, 1821. Edited and corrected by H. K.
Beauchamp. Clarendon Press, Oxford, 1924, pp. Hi-112, 628-31,
etc.]</blockquote>

<p>"Fools," says a modern teacher of the spiritual sense of the
phallic cult, "do not understand, and they never will, for they
look at it only from the physical side."[7]</p>

<blockquote>[7. Swarni Vivekananda, in <i>Bhakti Yoga.</i> For a
brief and liberal discussion of the topic see Chapter XIII in
<i>The Heart of Aryavarta,</i> by the Earl of Ronaldshay, Constable
&amp; Co., Ltd., London, 1925.]</blockquote>

<p>But, despite the scorn of the sage, practical observation in
India forces one to the conclusion that a re- , ligion adapted to
the wise alone leaves most of the sheep unshepherded.</p>

<p>And, even though the sex-symbols themselves were not present,
there are the sculptures and paintings on temple walls and temple
chariots, on palace doors and street-wall frescoes, realistically
demonstrating every conceivable aspect and humor of sex contact;
there are the eternal songs on the lips of the women of the
household; there is, in brief, the occupation and preoccupation of
the whole human world within the child's vision, to predispose
thought.</p>

<p>It is true that, to conform to the International Convention for
the Suppression of the Circulation of and Traffic in Obscene
Publications, signed in Geneva on September 12, 1923, the Indian
Legislature duly amended the Indian Penal Code and Code of Criminal
Procedure; and that this amendment duly prescribes set penalties
for "whoever sells, lets to hire, distributes, publicly
exhibits...conveys...or receives profit from any obscene object,
book, representation or figure." But its enactment unqualified,
although welcome to the Muhammadans, would have wrought havoc with
the religious belongings, the ancient traditions and customs and
the priestly prerogatives dear to the Hindu majority. Therefore the
Indian Legislature, preponderantly Hindu, saddled the amendment
with an exception, which reads:[8]</p>

<p class="quote">This section does not extend to any book,
pamphlet, writing, drawing or painting kept or used <i>bona
fide</i> for religious purposes or any representation sculptured,
engraved, painted or otherwise represented on or in any temple, or
on any car used for the conveyance of idols, or kept or used for
any religious purpose.</p>

<blockquote>[8. <i>Indian Penal Code,</i> Act No. VIII of 1925,
Section 292.]</blockquote>

<p>In many parts of the country, north and south, the little boy,
his mind so prepared, is likely, if physically attractive, to be
drafted for the satisfaction of grown men, or to be regularly
attached to a temple, in the capacity of prostitute. Neither parent
as a rule sees any harm in this, but is, rather, flattered that the
son has been found pleasing.</p>

<p>This, also, is a matter neither of rank nor of special
ignorance. In fact, so far are they from seeing good and evil as we
see good and evil, that the mother, high caste or low caste, will
practice upon her children--the girl "to make her sleep well," the
boy "to make him manly," an abuse which the boy, at least, is apt
to continue daily for the rest of his life.</p>

<p>This last point should be noticed. Highest medical authority in
widely scattered sections attests that practically every child
brought under observation, for whatever reason, bears on its body
the signs of this habit. Whatever opinion may be held as to its
physical effects during childhood, its effect upon early
thought-training cannot be overlooked. And, when constantly
practiced during mature life, its devastation of body and nerves
will scarcely be questioned.</p>

<p>Ancient Hindu religious teachings are cited to prove that the
marriage of the immature has not original Scriptural sanction. Text
is flung against text, in each recurrence of the argument. Pundits
radically disagree. But against the fog evoked in their dispute
stand sharp and clear the facts of daily usage. Hindu custom
demands that a man have a legitimate son at the earliest possible
moment--a son to perform the proper religious ceremonies at and
after the death of the father and to crack the father's skull on
the funeral pyre, according to his caste's ritual. For this reason
as well as from inclination, the beginning of the average boy's
sexual commerce barely awaits his ability. Neither general habit
nor public opinion confines that commerce to his wife or wives.</p>

<p>Mr. Gandhi has recorded that he lived with his wife, as such,
when he was thirteen years old, and adds that if he had not, unlike
his brother in similar case, left her presence for a certain period
each day to go to school, he "would either have fallen a prey to
disease and premature death, or have led [thenceforth] a burdensome
existence."[9]</p>

<blockquote>[9. <i>Young India,</i> Jan. 7, 1926.]</blockquote>

<p>Forced up by western influences, the subject of child marriages
has been much discussed of latter years and a sentiment of
uneasiness concerning it is perceptibly rising in the Indian mind.
But as yet this finds small translation into act, and the orthodox
Hindu majority fights in strength on the side of the ancient
practice.</p>

<p>Little in the popular Hindu code suggests self-restraint in any
direction, least of all in sex relations. "My father," said a
certain eminent Hindu barrister, one of the best men in his
province, "taught me wisely, in my boyhood, how to avoid
infection."</p>

<p>"Would it not have been better," I asked, "had he taught you
continence?"</p>

<p>"Ah--but we know that to be impossible."</p>

<p>"No question of right or wrong can be involved in any aspect of
such matters," a famous Hindu mystic, himself the venerated teacher
of multitudes, explained to me. "I forget the act the moment I have
finished it. I merely do it not to be unkind to my wife, who is
less illumined than I. To do it or not to do it, signifies nothing.
Such things belong only to the world of illusion."</p>

<p>After the rough outline just given, small surprise will meet the
statement that from one end of the land to the other the average
male Hindu of thirty years, provided he has means to command his
pleasure, is an old man; and that from seven to eight out of every
ten such males between the ages of twenty-five and thirty are
impotent. These figures are not random, and are affected by little
save the proviso above given <i>;</i> a cultivator of the soil,
because of his poverty and his life of wholesome physical exertion
during a part of the year, is less liable than the man of means, or
the city dweller. A sidelight will be found by a glance down the
advertisement space of Indian-owned newspapers. Magical drugs and
mechanical contrivances, whether "for princes and rich men only,"
or the humbler and not less familiar "32 Pillars of Strength to
prop up your decaying body for One Rupee[10] only," crowd the
columns and support the facts.</p>

<blockquote>[10. The market value of the rupee fluctuates with
other international exchanges. But for the purpose of this book,
one rupee is taken to be worth 33 1/3 cents, three rupees one
dollar, United States currency.]</blockquote>

<p>In the Punjab alone, between December 29, 1922, and December 4,
1925, Government prosecuted vernacular papers eleven separate times
for carrying ultra-indecent advertisements. In seven cases the
publications were Hindu, thrice Muhammadan, once Sikh. The fines
imposed ranged from twenty-five to two hundred rupees, in one case
plus ninety days rigorous imprisonment. And it should be duly noted
that such prosecutions are never undertaken save where the
advertisement gives the grossest physical details in plain and
unmistakable language.</p>

<p>Following the eleventh prosecution, Government sent out a note
to the press informing the editors of this last conviction with its
relatively high fine, and advising them to scrutinize
advertisements before publication. Upon this suggestion the
editorial comment of the <i>Brahman Samachar[11]</i> emitted an
informing ray:</p>

<p class="quote">"Government wants that such advertisements should
not be published and that the editors should go through them before
publishing them. It would have been better if the Information
Bureau had published the obscene advertisement along with its
report so that the subject matter and the manner of writing of the
advertisement would have become known."</p>

<blockquote>[11. A Hindu paper of Lahore, issue of Feb. 16,
1926.]</blockquote>

<p>Mr. Gandhi in his newspaper has, it is true, recorded his
disapproving cognizance. "Drugs and mechanical contrivances," he
writes, "may keep the body in a tolerable condition, but they sap
the mind."[12]</p>

<blockquote>[12. <i>Young India,</i> Sept. 2, 1926, p.
309.]</blockquote>

<p>But a far more characteristic general attitude was that
evidenced in the recent action of a Hindu of high position whereby,
before giving his daughter in marriage, he demanded from his
would-be son-in-law a British doctor's certificate attesting that
he, the would-be son-in-law, was venereally infected. The
explanation is simple: a barren wife casts embarrassment upon her
parents; and barren marriages, although commonly laid to the wife,
are often due to the husband's inability. The father in this case
was merely taking practical precaution. He did not want his
daughter, through fault not her own, to be either supplanted or
returned upon his hands. And no reproach whatevei attaches to the
infected condition. No public opinion works on the other side.</p>

<p>In case, however, of the continued failure of the wife--any
wife--to give him a child, the Hindu husband has a last recourse;
he may send his wife on a pilgrimage to a temple, bearing gifts.
And, it is affirmed, some castes habitually save time by doing this
on the first night after the marriage. At the temple by day, the
woman must beseech the god for a son, and at night she must sleep
within the sacred precincts. Morning come, she has a tale to tell
the priest of what befell her under the veil of darkness.</p>

<p>"Give praise, O daughter of honor!" he replies. "It was the
god!"</p>

<p>And so she returns to her home.</p>

<p>If a child comes, and it lives, a year later she re~ visits the
temple, carrying, with other gifts, the hair from her child's
head.[13]</p>

<blockquote>[13. Cf. <i>Hindu Manners, Customs and Ceremonies,</i>
pp. 593-4.]</blockquote>

<p>Visitors to the temples today sometimes notice a tree whose
boughs are hung with hundreds of little packets bound in dingy
rags<i>;</i> around the roots of that tree lies a thick mat of
short black locks of human hair. It is the votive tree of the god.
It declares his benefits. To maintain the honor of the shrine, the
priests of this attribute are carefully chosen from stout new
brethren.</p>

<p>Every one, seemingly, understands all about it. The utmost
piety, nevertheless, truly imbues the suppliant's mind and contents
the family.</p>

<p>As to the general subject, enough has now, perhaps, been said to
explain and to substantiate the Hindu's bitter lament of his own
"slave mentality."</p>

<p>It may also suggest why he develops no real or lasting leaders,
and why such men as from time to time aspire to that rank are able
only for a brief interval ta hold the flitting minds of their
followers.</p>

<p>The Indian perceives, to a certain degree, the condition; but he
rarely goes all the way to the bottom thereof. Nor does he
recognize its full significance and relate it to its consequences.
"Why do our best men--those who should lead us--die so young?" he
repeats despondently, implying that the only possible answer is:
"Karma--Kismet--an enigmatic fate." "The average life of our
inhabitants is 23 years," says the Hindu Doctor Hariprasad[14]--and
lays the blame to bad sanitation. Another characteristic Indian
view is expressed by Manilal C. Parekh,[15] treating with dismay of
the inroads of tuberculosis--an infection that finds ideal
encouragement in the unresisting bodies and depleting habits of the
people:</p>

<p class="quote">One need not think just now of the causes of this
frightful increase...The present writer wishes Swaraj to come to
India as early as possible in order that the people of the land may
be able to deal with this tremendously big problem...</p>

<blockquote>[14. <i>Young India,</i> Nov. 5, 1925, p.
375.]</blockquote>

<blockquote>[15. <i>Servants of India,</i> April 8, 1926, p.
124.]</blockquote>

<p>Thus they still contrive to shift the burden and avoid the
fact.</p>

<p>Yet it was one of the most distinguished of Indian medical men,
a Bombay Brahman, physician and pathologist, who gave me the
following appraisal:</p>

<p class="quote">My people continually miss the association of
their mental and material poverty with their physical extravagance.
Yet our undeniable race deterioration, our natural lack of power of
concentration, of initiative and of continuity of purpose cannot be
dissociated from our expenditure of all vital energy on the single
line of sexual indulgence.</p>

<p>Once more, then, one is driven to the original conclusion: Given
men who enter the world physical bankrupts out of bankrupt stock,
rear them through childhood in influences and practices that devour
their vitality; launch them at the dawn of maturity on an
unrestrained outpouring of their whole provision of creative energy
in one single direction; find them, at the age when the Anglo-Saxon
is just coming into full glory of manhood, broken-nerved,
low-spirited, petulant ancients; and need you, while this remains
unchanged, seek for other reasons why they are poor and sick and
dying and why their hands are too weak, too fluttering, to seize or
to hold the reins of Government? <a name="ch-3" id="ch-3"></a></p>

<hr align="center" width="25%">

<h2>CHAPTER III - MARBLES AND TOPS</h2>

<p>A study of the attitude of the Government of India is to the
subject of child-marriage shows that, while steadily exercising
persuasive pressure toward progress and change, it has been
dominated, always, by two general principles--the first, to avoid
as far as possible interference in matters concerning the religion
of the governed; the second, never to sanction a law that cannot be
enforced. To run counter to the Indian's tenets as to religious
duties, religious prohibitions, and god-given rights has ever meant
the eclipse of Indian reason in madness, riot and blood. And to
enforce a law whose keeping or breaking must be a matter of
domestic secrecy is, in such a country as India at least,
impossible.</p>

<p>Indian and English authorities unite in the conviction that no
law raising the marriage age of girls would be today effectively
accepted by the Hindu peoples. The utmost to be hoped, in the
present state of public mentality, is, so these experienced men
hold, a raising of the age of consent within the marriage bonds. A
step in this direction was accomplished in 1891, when Government,
backed by certain members of the advanced section of the Indians,
after a hot battle in which it was fiercely accused by eminent
orthodox Hindus of assailing the most sacred foundations of the
Hindu world, succeeded in raising that age from ten years to
twelve. In latter-day Legislative Assemblies the struggle has been
renewed, non-official Indian Assemblymen bringing forward bills
aiming at further advance only to see them, in one stage or
another, defeated by the strong orthodox maj ority.</p>

<p>Upon such occasions, the attitude of the Viceregal Government
has consistently been one of square approval of the main object in
view, but of caution against the passage of laws so much in advance
of public opinion that their existence can serve only to bring law
itself into disrepute. This course is the more obligatory because
of the tendency of the Indian public man to satisfy his sense of
duty by the mere empty passing of a law, without thought or
intention or accepted responsibility as to the carrying of his law
into effect.</p>

<p>Not unnaturally, Government's course pleases no one. From the
one side rise accusations of impious design against the sanctuaries
of the faith; from the other come charges as bitter but of an
opposite implication.</p>

<p>"What right have you to separate man and wife?" cries an
orthodox Brahman Assemblyman. "You may lay your unholy hands on our
ancient ideals and traditions, but we will not follow you."[1] Yet,
with equal vehemence a second member declares that "every
Englishman in the Government of India seems to be throwing
obstacles in the way of other people going forward."[2]</p>

<blockquote>[1. <i>Legislative Assembly Debates,</i> 1925, Vol. V,
Part III, p. 2890.]</blockquote>

<blockquote>[2. <i>Ibid.,</i> 1925, Vol. VI, p. 557.]</blockquote>

<p>An examination of these debates gives a fair general view of the
state of public opinion on the whole topic. Members seem well aware
of conditions that obtain. The divergence comes in the weight they
assign to those conditions.</p>

<p>Rai Bahadur Bakshi Sohan Lal, member from Jul-lundur, when
introducing a non-official amendment to raise the age of consent
within the marriage bond to fourteen years, argued:[3]</p>

<p class="quote">"The very high rate of fatality amongst the high
classes in this country of newly-born children and of young married
wives is due to sexual intercourse and pregnancy of the girl before
she reaches the age of puberty or full development of her physical
organs. The result of such consummation before bodily development
not only weakens the health of the girl but often produces children
who are weak and sickly, and in a large number of cases cannot
resist any illness of an ordinary type, or any inclemency of
weather or climate. Thus some of them die immediately after birth
or during their infancy. If they live at all, they are always in
need of medical attendance, medical advice or medical treatment, to
linger on their lives; or in other words they are born more to
minister to the medical profession than themselves and their
families or their country. Neither can they be good soldiers nor
good civilians, neither good outdoor workers nor good indoor
workers; neither can they be fit to attack an enemy nor defend
themselves against attacks of an enemy, or against the raid of
thieves or dacoits.[4] In a few words, his birth is very often the
cause of ruining the health, strength and prosperity of his parents
without resulting in a corresponding benefit to society. The
husband, in the majority of cases,...has to arrange for his
re-marriage several times during his life-time, on account of the
successive deaths of his young wives or on account of his wife
bearing children who are not long-lived."</p>

<blockquote>[3. <i>Ibid.,</i> 1922, Vol. II, Part III, p.
2650.]</blockquote>

<blockquote>[4. Gang robbers.]</blockquote>

<p>Successive debates expose the facts that few or none of the
Indian parliamentarians dispute the theoretical wisdom of
postponing motherhood until the maturity of the mother; but all
agree that it is impossible to effect such a result without
prohibiting the marriage of girls of immature age. Yet this they
say, with one accord, cannot be done--and for three reasons:</p>

<p>First, because immutable custom forbids, premarital pubescence
being generally considered, among Hindus, a social if not a
religious sin.[5]</p>

March 23 and 24 in Vol. V, Part III, and Sept. i, in Vol.
VI.]</blockquote>

<p>Second, because the father dare not keep his daughter at home
lest she be damaged before she is off his hands. And this
especially in joint-family households, where several men and
boys--brothers, cousins, uncles--live under the same roof.</p>

<p>Third, because the parents dare not expose the girl, after her
dawning puberty, to the pressure of her own desire unsatisfied.</p>

<p>With these intimate dangers in view a learned Brahman
Assemblyman, Diwan Bahadur T. Rangachariar, Member from Madras,
spoke earnestly against the unofficial bill of 1925 raising the age
of consent within the marriage bonds to fourteen years. Any
pretense at enforcing such a law would, it was generally conceded,
demand the keeping of the wife away from her husband, retaining her
in her own father's <i>zenana.</i>[6] Said the Madrassi
Assemblyman, warning, imploring:[7]</p>

<blockquote>[6. Women's quarters.]</blockquote>

<blockquote>[7. <i>Legislative Assembly Debates,</i> 1925, Vol.
<b>V, Part</b> III, <b>p.</b> 2884.]</blockquote>

<p class="quote">"Remember the position of girls in our country
between twelve and fourteen. Have we not got our daughters in our
house? Have we not got our sisters in our house? Remember that, and
remember your own neighbours. Remembering our habits, remembering
our usages, remembering the preco-ciousness of our youth,
remembering the condition of the climate, remembering the
conditions of the country, I ask you to give your weighty judgment
to this matter."</p>

<p>Another Brahman member vehemently protests:[8]</p>

<p class="quote">"The tradition of womanhood in this country is
unap-proached by the tradition of womanhood in any other country.
Our ideal of womanhood is this. Our women regard their
husbands--they have been taught from the moment they were suckling
their mothers' milk to regard their husbands as their God on
earth...To the Brahman girl-wife the husband is a greater, truer,
dearer benefactor than all the social reformers bundled
together!...What right have you to interfere with this ancient,
noble tradition of ours regarding the sanctity of wedlock?...What
is the object of this legislation? Do you want to make the women of
India strong and their children stalwart? But remember that in
trying to do that, you may otherwise be doing a lot of evil, far
worse than the evil you seek to remove...By all means take care of
[the girl's] body; but fail not to train her morals, to train her
soul, so as to enable her to look upon her husband as her God,
which indeed is the case in India, among Hindus at least...Don't
destroy I beg of you--don't ruin our Hindu Homes."</p>

<blockquote>[8. <i>Ibid.,</i> p. 2890 <i>et seq.</i>]</blockquote>

<p>To reasoning of this sort another member--Mr. Shanmukhan Chetty,
of Salem and Coimbatore--hotly retorts:[9]</p>

<blockquote>[9. <i>Legislative Assembly Debates,</i> 1025, Vol. VI,
p. 558.]</blockquote>

<p class="quote">"The fact that a so-called marriage rite precedes
the commission of a crime does not and cannot justify that crime. I
have no doubt that if you were to ask a cannibal, he would plead
his religion for the heinous act he does."</p>

<p>And Dr. S. K. Datta, Indian Christian representative from
Calcutta:[10]</p>

<blockquote>[10. <i>Ibid.,</i> 1925, Vol. V, Part III, p.
2839.]</blockquote>

<p class="quote">"If ever there was "a man-made law," this
compulsion of young girls to become mothers is one of them."</p>

<p>The bill raising the age of consent to fourteen was finally
thrown out, buried under an avalanche of popular disapproval. In
the next Assembly Sir Alexander Muddiman, leader of the Viceroy's
Government, brought in an official bill drafted with a view of
breaking the <i>impasse</i> and securing that degree of advance
that would be conceded by the conservative Indian element- This
bill, fixing the woman's age of consent within and without the
marriage bond respectively <b>at</b> thirteen and fourteen years,
was enacted into law as Act XXIX of 1925.</p>

<p>The discussion that it evoked on the floor of the Assembly gave
still further light upon the attitude of Indians.</p>

<p>Some speakers pointed to the gradual growth of public opinion as
expressed in caste, party and association councils as the best hope
of the future. These deprecated legislation as both irritating and
useless, calling attention to the fact that the orthodox community,
comprising as it does the great majority of Hindus all over India,
would regard legal abolition of child-marriage as, literally, a
summons to a holy war.</p>

<p>Similarly, any active attempt to protect the child-wife during
her infancy would, it was shown, be held as an attack upon the
sacred marital relation, impossible to make effective and sure to
let loose "bloodshed and chaos."</p>

<p>Rai Sahib M. Harbilas Sarda, of Ajmer-Merwara maintained, it is
true, that[11]</p>

<blockquote>[11. <i>Ibid.,</i> 1925, Vol. VI, p. 561.]</blockquote>

<p class="quote">"where a social custom or a religious rite
outrages our sense of humanity or inflicts injustice on a helpless
class of people, the Legislature has a right to step in. Marrying a
girl of three or four years and allowing sexual intercourse with a
girl of nine or ten years outrages the sense of humanity
anywhere."</p>

<p>But Pundit Madan Mohan Malaviya, of Allahabad, thought
differently, saying:[12]</p>

<blockquote>[12. <i>Ibid.,</i> pp. 573-4]</blockquote>

<p class="quote">"I have to face the stern realities of the
situation, realities which include a general permission or rather a
widespread practice of having marriages performed before twelve and
consequently of the impossibility of preventing a married couple
from meeting...I submit that it is perhaps best that we should
reconcile ourselves to leave the law as it is in the case of
married people for the present, and to trust to the progress of
education and to social reform to raise the age of consummation of
marriage to the proper level...I am sure, Sir, that a great deal of
advance has been made in this matter. In many provinces among the
higher classes the marriageable age has been rising...It is the
poorer classes who unfortunately are the greatest victims in this
matter. Early marriages take place among the poorer classes in a
larger measure than among the higher classes."</p>

<p>And Mr. Amar Nath Dutt, of Burdwan, combated the action
proposed, thus:[13]</p>

<blockquote>[13. <i>Legislative Assembly Debates,</i> 1925, Vol.
VI, pp. 558-9.]</blockquote>

<p class="quote">"We have no right to thrust our advanced views
upon our less advanced countrymen...Our villages are tern with
factions. If the age of consent is raised to 13, rightly or wrongly
we will find that there will be inquisitions by the police at the
instance of members of an opposite faction in the village and
people will be put to disgrace and trouble...I would ask
[Government]...to withdraw the Bill at once. Coming as I do, Sir,
from Bengal, I know what is the opinion of the majority of the
people there."</p>

<p>Mr. M. K. Acharya, of South Arcot, also strongly adverse to
change, declared that[14]</p>

<blockquote>[14. <i>Ibid.,</i> p. 551.]</blockquote>

<p class="quote">"...what is sought to be done is to make that an
offence which is not an offence now, to make that a crime which is
not at present a crime, and which we are unable to regard as a
crime, whatever may be the feelings of some few people to the
contrary."</p>

<p>To which the same speaker added, a few moments later:[15]</p>

<p class="quote">"There is very little opinion of any respectable
body of men in India which wants this reform very urgently. It may
come, and there is no harm in it, in its own course. Really this
is...merely to give Honourable Members some legislative marbles and
tops to play with during the time that we happen to be in
Simla."[16]</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV - EARLY TO MARRY AND EARLY TO DIE</h2>

<p>Upon the unfruitful circlings of the Hindus breaks, once and
again, a voice from the hardy North. Rarely, for the subject
carries small interest therej yet, when it comes, weighted with
rough acumen.</p>

<p>Nawab Sir Sahibzada Abdul Qaiyum is, as his name suggests, a
Muhammadan. Speaking as of the distant North-West Frontier
Province, he said:[l]</p>

<p class="quote">"I should like to say only a few words on the
practical side of it. In my part of the country, we do not have
early marriages. So the Bill is not likely to affect us very
much...I should have thought...the proper remedy...fixing the age
of marriage for a man at a certain point and for a woman at another
point...[but] I do not think the country is prepared...Well, just
consider: Who is going to be the prosecutor, who is going to be the
investigator, who are going to be the witnesses, and who is going
to enforce the verdict?...Then there is another difficulty...that
you allow a young couple to be married and to live together and
give them the opportunity of sharpening their sexual appetite and
then prevent them by law from having their natural intercourse
simply because they have not reached a certain age...Well, suppose
this law is enacted, and the young couple are prevented from having
intercourse, I should think that in the majority of cases you would
thus be sending the young boy into the streets...but so long as you
allow people to be married young, there is no sufficient reason why
you should enact laws which may interfere with their private
life."</p>

<blockquote>[1. <i>Legislative Assembly Debates,</i> 1925, Vol. VI,
pp. 571-2.]</blockquote>

<p>The handling of child-wives, many finally affirm, must,
regardless of legal enactment, continue to be guided by natural
instincts under the husbands' sacred rights.</p>

<p>Throughout the Hindu argument, however, the general conviction
appears that law-making for social advance, while entirely hopeless
of enforcement, exerts an educational influence upon the community
and is therefore to be regarded with satisfaction as a completed
piece of work. "The people should be educated," the Indian public
man declares. "They should follow the course that I hereby
indicate." Having spoken, he washes his hands. His task is
done.</p>

<p>The voice of Diwan Bahadur T. Rangachariar, the Madrassi Brahman
Assemblyman before quoted, was one of the few raised in criticism
of this characteristic viewpoint. Addressing a fellow Assemblyman,
proponent of the reform amendment, he says:[2]</p>

<p class="quote">"May I ask my Honourable friend how many platforms
he has addressed in this connection outside this hall? (A voice:
"Never.") Has he ever summoned a meeting in his own province and
addressed the people on the value of these reforms? Sir, it is easy
to avail yourself of the position which you occupy here appealing
to an audience where all are wedded to your views and to get them
to aid in this legislation. But...it is not so easy a task to go to
the country and convince your own countrymen and countrywomen."</p>

<blockquote>[2. <i>Ibid..</i> 1925, Vol. V, Part III, p.
2847.]</blockquote>

<p>Thus throughout these councils, the weight of responsibility
tosses back and forth, a beggar for lodgment. "It is only the
Brahmans who marry their girls in infancy." Or, equally, "It is
only the low castes that follow such practice"; and, "In any case
the evils of early marriages are much exaggerated, interference is
unwise, and volunteer social and religious reform associations may
be trusted to protect young wives."</p>

<p>But, turning from the shifts and theories of politicians--from
their vague affirmations of progress attained, to cold black and
white--you are pulled up with a jerk. Says the latest Census of
India:[3]</p>

<p class="quote">It can be assumed for all practical purposes that
every woman is in the married state at or immediately after puberty
and that cohabitation, therefore, begins in every case with
puberty.</p>

<p>And the significance of the thing is further driven home by the
estimate that in India each generation sees the death of 3,200,000
mothers in the agonies of childbirth[4]--a figure greater than that
of the united death-roll of the British Empire, including India,
France, Belgium, Italy and the United States, in the World War; and
that the average physical rating of the population is at the bottom
of the international list.</p>

<blockquote>[3. <i>Census of India,</i> 1921, Appendix
VII.]</blockquote>

<blockquote>[4. <i>Legislative Assembly Debates,</i> 1922, Vol.
Ill, Part I, p. 88a]</blockquote>

<p>To turn again to the Legislative Assembly: Once more, it is a
man from the North who speaks--a gray-beard yeoman, tall, straight,
lean and sinewy, hard as nails, a telling contrast to the
Southerners around him who jeer as he talks--Sardar Bahadur Captain
Hira Singh Brar, of the Punjab, old Sikh fighting man.[5]</p>

<p class="quote">I think, Sir, the real solution for preventing
infant mortality lies in smacking the parent who produces such
children, and more so, in slapping many of our friends who always
oppose the raising of the age to produce healthy
children...<i>,</i> Is it not a sin when they call a baby of nine
or ten years or a boy of ten years husband and wife? It is a shame.
(Voices: "No, no!")...a misfortune for this generation and for the
future generation...Girls of nine or ten, babies themselves who
ought to be playing with their dolls rather than becoming wives,
are mothers of children. Boys who ought to be getting their lessons
in school are rearing a large family of half a dozen boys and
girls...I do not like to go into society. I feel ashamed, because
there is no manhood, there is no womanhood. I should feel ashamed
myself to go into society with a little girl of twelve years as my
wife...We all talk, talk and talk a hundred and one things here,
but what happens? All left in this House, all left on the platform
and nothing carried to our homes, nothing happens...Healthy
children are the foundation of a strong nation. Every one knows
that the parents cannot produce healthy children. To be useful we
must have long life which we cannot have if early marriage is not
stopped. "Early to marry and early to die," is the motto of
Indians.</p>

<blockquote>[5. <i>Ibid.,</i> 1925, Vol. V, Part III, pp.
2829-31.]</blockquote>

<p>The frank give-and-takes of the Indian Legislature, between
Indian and Indian, deal with facts. But it is instructive to
observe the robes that those facts can wear when arrayed by a poet
for foreign consideration. Rabindranath Tagore, in a recent essay
on "The Indian Ideal of Marriage," explains child-marriage as a
flower of the sublimated spirit, a conquest over sexuality and
materialism won by exalted intellect for the eugenic uplift of the
race. His explanation, however, logically implies the assumption,
simply, that Indian women must be securely bound and delivered
before their womanhood is upon them, if they are to be kept in
hand. His words are:[6]</p>

<p class="quote">The "desire"...against which India's solution of
the marriage problem declared war, is one of Nature's most powerful
fighters; consequently, the question of how to overcome it was not
an easy one. There is a particular age, said India, at which this
attraction between the sexes reaches its height; so if marriage is
to be regulated according to the social will [as distinguished from
the choice of the individual concerned], it must be finished with
before such age. Hence the Indian Custom of early marriage.</p>

<blockquote>[6. <i>The Book of Marriage,</i> Keyserling, Harcourt,
Brace &amp; Co., New York, 1926, p. lia.]</blockquote>

<p>In other words, a woman must be married before she knows she is
one.</p>

<p>Such matter as this, coming as it does from one of the most
widely known of modern Indian writers, may serve to suggest that we
of the "material-minded West" shall be misled if we too quickly
accept the Oriental's phrases as making literal pictures of the
daily human life of which he seems to speak.</p>

<p>All thus far written here concerns the fate of children within
the marriage bond. The general subject of prostitution in India
need not enter the field of this book; but certain special aspects
thereof may be cited because of the compass bearings that they
afford.</p>

<p>In some parts of the country, more particularly in the
Presidency of Madras and in Orissa, a custom obtains among the
Hindus whereby the parents, to persuade some favor from the gods,
may vow their next born child, if it be a girl, to the gods. Or, a
particularly lovely child, for one reason or another held
superfluous in her natural surroundings, is presented to the
temple. The little creature, accordingly, is delivered to the
temple women, her predecessors along the route, for teaching in
dancing and singing. Often by the age of five, when she is
considered most desirable, she becomes the priests' own
prostitute.</p>

<p>If she survives to later years she serves as a dancer and singer
before the shrine in the daily temple worship; and in the houses
around the temple she is held always ready, at a price, for the use
of men pilgrims during their devotional sojourns in the temple
precincts. She now goes beautifully attired, often loaded with the
jewels of the gods, and leads an active life until her charms fade.
Then, stamped with the mark of the god under whose aegis she has
lived, she is turned out upon the public, with a small allowance
and with the acknowledged right to a beggar's livelihood. Her
parents, who may be well-to-do persons of good rank and caste, have
lost no face at all by the manner of their disposal of her. Their
proceeding, it is held, was entirely reputable. And she and her
like form a sort of caste of their own, are called
<i>devadassis,</i> or "prostitutes of the gods," and are a
recognized essential of temple equipment.[7]</p>

<blockquote>[7. Cf. <i>The Golden Bough,</i> J. G. Frazer,
Macmillan &amp; Co., London, 1914. <i>Adonis, Attis, Osiris,</i>
Vol. I, pp. 61-5.]</blockquote>

<p>Now, if it were asked how a responsible Government permits this
custom to continue in the land, the answer is not far to seek. The
custom, like its background of public sentiment, is deep-rooted in
the far past of an ultra-conservative and passionately religiose
people. Any one curious as to the fierceness with which it would be
defended by the people, both openly and covertly, and in the name
of religion, against any frontal attack, will find answer in the
extraordinary work[8] and in the too-reticent books[9] of Miss Amy
Wilson-Carmichael.</p>

<blockquote>[8. In Dohnavur, Tinnevelly District, South
India.]</blockquote>

<blockquote>[9. <i>Lotus Buds, Things As They Are,</i> etc., Morgan
&amp; Scott, London.]</blockquote>

<p>A province could be roused to madness by the forcible withdrawal
of girl-children from the gods.</p>

<p>"You cannot hustle the East." But the underground workings of
western standards and western contacts, and the steady, quiet
teachings of the British official through the years have done more,
perhaps, toward ultimate change than any coercion could have
effected.</p>

<p>Thus, when one measure came before the Legislative Assembly to
raise the age of consent outside the marriage bond it was
vigorously resisted by that conspicuous member, the then Rao
Bahadur T. Rangachariar. His argument was, that such a step would
work great hardships to the temple prostitutes.</p>

<p>And why?</p>

<p>Because, as he explained, the daughters of the
<i>deva-dassis</i> cannot be married to caste husbands; so,[10]</p>

<p class="quote">as these girls cannot find wedlock, the mothers
arrange with a certain class of Zemindars--big landlords--that they
should be taken into alliance with the Zemindar.</p>

<blockquote>[10. <i>Legislative Assembly Debates,</i> 1923, Vol.
Ill, Part IV, pp. 2807-81]</blockquote>

<p>And the sympathetic legislator goes on in warning that if the
girl's age is raised, no <i>zemindar</i> will desire her, with the
result that a good bargain is lost and the child is planted on her
poor mother's hands.[11]</p>

<blockquote>[11. <i>Ibid.,</i> pp. 2826-7.]</blockquote>

<p>But the interesting point in the debate is not the eminent
Brahman's voicing of the mass-sentiment of his people, but the
opposition that his words call forth from the seats around him,
which are almost at one in their disapproval of an argument that, a
generation earlier, would have met another reception.</p>

<p>Then followed the member from Orissa, Mr. Misra, with his views
on <i>devadassis</i> or ordinary <i>dassis</i> or
prostitutes:[12]</p>

<blockquote>[12. Footnote not provided. (Ebook
editor)]</blockquote>

<p class="quote">They have existed from time immemorial...They are
regarded as a necessity even for marriage and other parties, and
for singing songs in invocation of God...Much has been said about
girls being disposed of to Zemindars and Rajas.[13]...Zemindars
never get any girls from procurers. What happens is this. When
Zemindars or Rajas marry, their wives or Ranis bring with them some
girls as maid servants...Such a thing as procuring of girls does
not exist and no gentleman, whether he be a Zemindar or a Raja or
an ordinary man, would ever adopt such a nefarious means to procure
girls...Why should we think so much about these people [minor
girls] who are able to take care of themselves?</p>

<blockquote>[13. A Hindu title, inferior to Maharaja.]</blockquote>

<p>Mr. Misra's speech, although it dealt with simple facts, evoked
another manifestation of western influence, in that it definitely
jarred upon many of his co-legislators. However true, they did not
want it spread in the record. Cries of "Withdraw!" repeatedly
interrupted him, and the words of other speakers gave ample proof
of stirrings, intellectually, at least, of a new perception in the
land.</p>

<p>To translate intellectual perception into concrete act requires
yet another subversive mental process, in a people whose religion
teaches that freedom from all action is the crown of perfect
attainment. <a name="ch-5" id="ch-5"></a></p>

<h2>CHAPTER V - SPADES ARE SPADES</h2>

<p>To visualize the effects of child-marriage as outlined by the
legislators just quoted, one of the most direct means that the
foreigner in India can take is to visit women's hospitals. This I
have done from the Punjab to Bombay, from Madras to the United
Provinces. This a man can scarcely do, for the reason that, doctor
or not, he will rarely be admitted to the sight of a woman
patient.</p>

<p>In one of the cities of the northeast is a little
<i>purdah</i>[1] hospital of great popularity among Indian women.
The timid creatures who crowd it are often making thereby their
first excursion outside the walls of their own homes, nor would
they have ventured now save for the pain that drove them.
Muhammadans always, Hindus often, arrive in <i>purdah</i>
conveyances--hidden in curtained carriages, or in little
close-draped boxes barely high enough to hold their crouching
bodies, swinging on a pole between bearers like bales of goods.
Government clerks' wives they are, wives of officials or of
professional men, rich women sometimes, sometimes poor, women of
high caste, women of low caste--too desperate, all, for the help
they are dying for, to set up against themselves their cherished
bars of religious hatreds and caste repulsions.</p>

<blockquote>[1. The seclusion of women as in a harem.]</blockquote>

<p>The hospital consists of a series of little one-story bungalows,
partly in wards, partly in single rooms. At the start, years ago,
it was slow business getting the women to come; the first season
producing a total of nine midwifery cases. But now every bed is
full, even the verandas are crowded with cots, and women by scores,
for whom there is no space, are pleading for admission.</p>

<p>Walking down the aisles you see, against the white plane of the
pillows, dark faces of the non-Aryan stock, lighter faces of
Brahmans, fine-cut faces of the northern Persian-Muhammadan strain,
coarse faces of the South, all alike looking out from behind a
common veil of helplessness and pain. Most of the work, here, is
gynecological. Most of the women are very young. Almost all are
venereally affected.</p>

<p>Some come because they are childless, begging for either
medicine or an operation to give them the one thing that buys an
Indian wife a place in the sun. "Among such," says the British
surgeon-superintendent, "we continually find that the patient has
had one child, often dead, and that then she has been infected with
gonorrhea, which has utterly destroyed the pelvic organs. The
number of young girls that come here, so destroyed in their first
years of married life, is appalling. Ninety per cent, of the pelvic
inflammation is of gonorrheal origin.</p>

<p>"Here," she continues, as we stop at the bedside of a young girl
who looks up at us with the eyes of a hungry animal, "here is a new
patient. She has had several children, all still-born. This time,
because her husband will no longer keep her unless she bears him a
living child, she has come to us for confinement. As usual, it is a
venereal case. But I hope we can help her."</p>

<p>"And what about this one?" I ask, pausing by another cot in
inward revolt against the death-stricken look on the young face
before us.</p>

<p>"That," answers the doctor, "is the wife of a Hindu official. He
brought her to us three days ago, in the very onset of her second
confinement, because, by the first, she had failed to give him a
living child. Also she is suffering from heart-disease, asthma and
a broken leg! I had to set her leg and confine her at practically
one and the same time. It was a forceps case. Dead twins. She, too,
is an internal wreck, from infection, and can never give birth
again. But that she does not yet know; I think it would kill her if
she heard it now.</p>

<p>"Her age? Thirteen and a few months."</p>

<p>"Now what can be wrong here?" I inquire, catching the smile of a
wan-faced child whose bird's-claw hands are clasped around a paper
toy.</p>

<p>"Ah!" says the doctor, "this one was a pupil in a Government
primary school, a merry wee thing, and so bright that she had just
won a prize for scholarship. During the holiday five months ago her
brother sent her home to the man to whom they had married her.</p>

<p>That man is fifty years old. From their point of view he is a
Hindu gentleman beyond reproach. From our point of view he is a
beast...What happened, this mite was too terrified to tell. For
weeks she grew worse and worse. At last she went completely off her
head. Then her sister, an old patient of ours, stole her away and
dragged her here.</p>

<p>"I have never seen a creature so fouled. Her internal wounds
were alive with maggots. For days after she got here, she lay
speechless on her bed. Not a sound did she utter--only stared, with
half blank, half terror-stricken eyes. Then one day it chanced that
a child with a fractured arm was brought in and put in a bed near
hers. And I, going through the ward, began playing with that child.
This little one, watching, evidently began to think that here,
perhaps, we were not all cruel monsters. Next day as I passed, she
smiled. The day after that she put her arms around my neck, in a
sort of maudlin fashion. That was the turning point in her mind.
Now her mental balance is mending, though her body is still sick.
Her memory, fortunately, has not recovered the immediate past. She
lies there with her toys, wondering at them, feebly playing with
them, or with her big eyes following our movements about the room.
She is pitifully content.</p>

<p>"Meantime her husband is suing her to recover his marital rights
and force her back into his possession. She is not yet thirteen
years old."</p>

<p>Such instances of mental derangement are common enough. Where
should child-fabric, even though its inheritance had been the best
instead of the weakest, find strength to withstand the strain? The
case last cited was of well-to-do, educated, city-dwelling stock.
But it differed in no essential from that of a younger child whom I
saw in a village some three hundred miles distant. Married as a
baby, sent to her husband at ten, the shock of incessant use was
too much for her brain. It went. After that, beat her as he would,
all that she could do was to crouch in the corner, a little twisted
heap, panting. Not worth the keep. And so at last, in despair and
rage over his bad bargain, he slung her small body over his
shoulder, carried her out to the edge of the jungle, cast her in
among the scrub thicket, and left her there to die.</p>

<p>This she must have done, but that an Indian witness to the deed
carried the tale to an English lady who herself went out into the
jungle, found the child, and brought her in. Her mind, they said,
was slow in emerging from its stupor. But under the influence of
peace and gentleness and the handling proper to a child, she began
at last to blossom into normal intelligence. When I first saw her,
a year and four months after her abandonment, she was racing about
a pleasant old garden, romping with other happy little children,
and contentedly hugging a doll. Her English protectors will keep
her as long as they can. After that, what?</p>

<p>Except well to the north, the general condition thus indicated
is found in most sections of India. Bombay Presidency has an
outstanding number of educated and progressive women, but the
status of the vast majority in that province, as in the rest, would
more fairly be inferred from the other extreme--from, for example,
the wife whom I saw, mother at nine and a half, by Caesarean
operation, of a boy weighing one and three-quarter pounds.</p>

<p>Strike off across the peninsula, a thousand miles east of
Bombay, and you have the same story. "What can be hoped from these
infant wives?" says the superintendent of a hospital here--a most
competent and devoted British lady doctor. "Their whole small stock
of vitality is exhausted in the first pregnancy. Thence they go on,
repeating the strain with no chance whatever of building up
strength to give to the children that come so fast. A five-pound
baby is large. In the neighborhood of four is the usual weight.
Many are born dead 3 and all, because of their low vitality, are
predisposed to any and every infection that may come along. My
patients, here, are largely the wives of University students.
Practically every one is venereally infected. When I first came out
to India, I tried going to the parents of each such case to tell
them of their daughter's state, in the hope that they would act in
her behalf. But when I found that they had known the husband's
diseased condition before giving their daughter in marriage, and
could still see neither shame nor harm therein, I gave up the
attempt. They do not look on it as an inconvenience, nor will they
give weight to the fact that they are passing on a vile thing to
the children.</p>

<p>"Now my question is, whether, in view of the chronic inadequacy
of our hospital funds, I am right in giving the cure to these
patients. It costs about twenty rupees ($6.66), and the woman is
reinfected the day she returns to her own home. I could do so many
other things with those precious twenty rupees! And yet--"</p>

<p>Again, in the great Madras Presidency, east or west, the tale is
no better. "For the vast majority of women here," says a widely
experienced surgeon, "marriage is a physical tragedy. The girl may
bring to birth one or two sound children, but is by that time
herself ruined and crippled, either from infection or cruel
handling. In the thousands of gynecological cases that I have
treated and am still treating, I have never found one woman who had
not some form of venereal disease."</p>

<p>In other provinces of India, other medical men and women,
European and western-educated Indian alike, gave me ample
corroborative statements as to the effects of child motherhood. On
the mother's part, increased predisposition to tuberculosis;
displacement of organs; softening of immature bones, due to weight
on spine and pelvis, presently causing disastrous obstructions to
birth; hysteria and pathological mental derangements; stunting of
mental and physical growth. "A very small percentage of Indian
women seem to me to be well and strong," adds a woman physician of
wide present-day Indian experience. "This state I believe to be
accounted for by a morbid and unawakened mentality, by venereal
infection, and by sexual exhaustion. They commonly experience
marital use two and three times a day."</p>

<p>Thirty-six years ago, when the Age of Consent bill was being
argued in the Indian Legislature, all the women doctors then
working in India united to lay before the Viceroy a memorial and
petition for the relief of those to whose help their own lives were
dedicated. Affirming that they instanced only ordinary cases--cases
taken from the common personal practice of one or another of their
own number--they give as follows the conditions in which certain
patients first came into their hands:[2]</p>

<blockquote>[2. <i>Legislative Assembly Debates,</i> 1922, Vol III,
Part I, pp. 881-3, and Appendix, p. 919.]</blockquote>

<p>A.--Aged 9. Day after marriage. Left femur dislocated, pelvis
crushed out of shape. Flesh hanging in shreds.</p>

<p>B.--Aged 10. Unable to stand, bleeding profusely, flesh much
lacerated.</p>

<p>C.--Aged 9. So completely ravished as to be almost beyond
surgical repair. Her husband had two other living wives and spoke
very fine English.</p>

<p>I.--Aged_ about 7. Living with husband. Died in great agony
after three days.</p>

<p>M.--Aged about 10. Crawled to hospital on her hands and knees.
Has never been able to stand erect since her marriage,</p>

<p>The original list is longer than here given. It will be found in
the appendix of this book.[3]</p>

<blockquote>[3. See <a href="#appendix">Appendix</a>]</blockquote>

<p>This was in 1891. In 1922, the subject being again before the
Indian Legislature, this same petition of the women surgeons was
once more brought forward <b>as</b> equally applicable after the
lapse of years. No one disputed, no one can yet dispute, its
continued force. The Englishman who now introduced it into the
debate could not bring himself to read its text aloud. But,
referring to the bill raising the Age of Consent then under
discussion, he concluded his speech thus:</p>

<p class="quote">A number of persons...have said that this Bill is
likely to give rise to agitation. No one dislikes agitation more
than I do. I am sick of agitation. But when, Sir, it is a case of
the lives of women and children, I can only say, in the words of
the Duke of Wellington: "Agitate and be damned!"</p>

<p>In a recent issue of his weekly paper, <i>Young India</i>[4] Mr.
Gandhi printed an article over his own name entitled "Curse of
Child Marriage." Said Mr. Gandhi:</p>

<blockquote>[4. <i>Young India,</i> August 26, 1926, p.
302.]</blockquote>

<p class="quote">It is sapping the vitality of thousands of our
promising boys and girls on whom the future of our society entirely
rests.<br>
<br>
It is bringing into existence every year thousands of
weaklings--both boys and girls--who are born of immature
parenthood.<br>
<br>
It is a very fruitful source of appalling child-mortality and
still-births that now prevail in our society.<br>
<br>
It is a very important cause of the gradual and steady decline of
Hindu society in point of (1) numbers, (2) physical strength and
courage, and (3) morality.</p>

<p>Not less interesting than the article itself is the reply that
it quickly elicits from an Indian correspondent whom Mr. Gandhi
himself vouches for as "a man occupying a high position in
society." This correspondent writes:[5]</p>

<blockquote>[5. <i>Young India,</i> Sept. 9, 1926, p.
318.]</blockquote>

<p class="quote">I am very much pained to read your article on
"Curse of Child Marriage."...<br>
<br>
I fail to understand why you could not take a charitable view of
those whose opinion differs from you...I think it improper to say
that those who insist on child marriage are "steeped in
vice."...<br>
<br>
The practice of early marriage is not confined to any province or
class of society, but is practically a universal custom in
India...<br>
<br>
The chief objection to early marriage is that it weakens the health
of the girl and her children. But this objection is not very
convincing for the following reasons. The age of marriage is now
rising among the Hindus, but the race is becoming weaker. Fifty or
a hundred years ago the men and women were generally stronger,
healthier and more long-lived than now. But early marriage was then
more in vogue...From these facts it appears probable that early
marriage does not cause as much physical deterioration as some
people believe...</p>

<p>The type of logic employed in the paragraph last quoted is so
essentially Indian that its character should not be passed by
without particular note. The writer sees no connection between the
practice of the grandparents and the condition of the
grandchildren, even though he sets both down in black and white on
the paper before him.</p>

<p>A voice in the wilderness, Mr. Gandhi continues the attack,
printing still further correspondence drawn forth by his original
article. He gives the letter of a Bengali Hindu lady, who
writes:[6]</p>

<blockquote>[6. <i>Ibid.,</i> Oct. 7, 1926, p. 349.]</blockquote>

<p class="quote">I don't know how to thank you for your speaking on
behalf of the poor girl-wives of our Hindu society...Our women
always bear their burden of sorrow, in silence, with meekness. They
have no power left in them to fight against any evil whatever.</p>

<p>To this Mr. Gandhi rejoins by adducing from his own knowledge
instances in support, such as that of a sixty-year-old
educationalist, who, without loss of public respect, has taken home
a wife of nine years. But he ends on a rare new note, arraigning
India's western-taught women who spend their energies in politics,
publicity-seeking, and empty talk, to the utter neglect of the
crucial work for India that only they can do:[7]</p>

<blockquote>[7. <i>Ibid.</i>]</blockquote>

<p class="quote">May women always throw the blame on men and salve
their consciences?...They may fight, if they like, for votes for
women. It costs neither time nor trouble. It provides them with
innocent recreation. But where are the brave women who work among
the girl-wives and girl-widows, and who would take no rest and
leave none for men, till girl-marriage became an impossibility?</p>

<p>It has been the habit, in approaching these matters, to draw a
veil before their nakedness and pass quickly by. Searching
missionaries' reports for light out of their long experience, one
finds neat rows of dots, marking the silent tombs of the
indecorous. For the missionary is thinking, first, of the dovecotes
at home whence his money comes, and on whose sitting-room tables
his report will be laid; and, second, of the super-sensitive
Indians on whose sufferance he depends for whatever measure of
success he may attain. Again, laymen who know the facts have
written around rather than about them, swathing the spot in
euphemisms, partly to avoid the Indian's resentment at being held
up to a disapproval whose grounds he can neither feel nor
understand, partly out of respect to the occidental reader's
taste.</p>

<p>Yet, to suppress or to veil the bare truth is, in cases such as
this, to belie it. For few western readers, without plain telling,
spade by spade, will imagine the conditions that exist.</p>

<p>Given, then, a constructive desire really to understand India's
problems, it is merely what Mr. Gandhi calls "self-deception, the
worst of sins," to beg off from facing the facts in these
fundamental aspects of Indian life. And if any one is inclined to
bolt the task, let him stop to consider whether he has a right so
to humor himself, a right to find it too hard even to speak or to
hear of things that millions of little children, and of women
scarcely more than children, are this very day enduring in their
tormented flesh. <a name="pt-2" id="pt-2"></a></p>

<h1>PART II</h1>

<h2><i>Interlude</i> - THE GRAND TRUNK ROAD</h2>

<p>The Grand Trunk Road, at the Khyber. Black, barren, jagged hills
scowl into the chasm that cleaves them. Tribesmen's villages on
either side--each house in itself a fortalice, its high fighting
towers surrounded by high, blind walls loop-holed for rifles.</p>

<p>"What is your calling?" you ask the master. "What but the
calling of my people?" says he. "We are raiders."</p>

<p>They may not shoot across the road, it being the highway of the
King-Emperor. But on either side they shoot as they please, the
country being their country. Their whole life is war, clan on clan,
house on house, man on man, yet, for utter joy, Muslim on Hindu.
Hills are bare, food is scarce, and the delight of life is stalking
human prey, excelling its cunning. <a name="page66" id=
"page66"></a></p>

<p>Two miles of camels, majestic, tail to nose, nose to tail,
bearing salt, cotton and sugar from India to Asia, swinging
gloriously past two miles of camels, nose to tail, tail to nose,
bearing the wares of Asia into India. Armed escorts of Afridi
soldiers. Armed posts. Frequent roadside emplacements for three or
four sharpshooters with rifles. Barbed wire entanglements.
Tribesmen afoot, hawk-nosed, hawk-eyed, carrying two rifles apiece,
taking the lay of the land on the off-chance. Tramp--tramp--a
marching detachment of the 2nd Battalion Royal
Fusiliers--open-faced, bright-skinned English lads, smart and
keen--an incredible sight in that setting. Yet because of them and
them only may the Hindu today venture the Khyber. Until the Pax
Britannica reached so far, few Hindus came through alive, unless
mounted and clad as women.</p>

<p>The Grand Trunk Road rolls South and South--a broad, smooth
river of peace whose waves are unthinking humanity. Monkeys of many
sorts play along its sides. Peacocks. Deer. Herds of camels
shepherded by little naked boys entirely competent. Dust of
traffic. White bullocks, almond-eyed, string upon string of
sky-blue beads twisted around their necks and horns, pulling wains
heaped high with cotton for Japan.
Villages--villages--villages--true homes of India, scattered, miles
apart, across the open country. Each just a handful of mud-walled
huts clustered beside the hole they took the mud from, now half
full of stagnant water in which they wash and bathe and quench
their thirst. In villages such as these live nine-tenths of all the
peoples of India. Hindu or Muhammadan alike--hard-working
cultivators of the soil, simple, illiterate, peaceful, kindly, save
when men steal amongst them carrying fire.</p>

<p>Sunset. The ghost of a ghost--a thin long veil of blue, floating
twice a man's height above the earth. Softly it widens, deepens,
till all the air is blue and the tall tree-trunks and the stars
themselves show blue behind it. Now comes its breath--a biting tang
of smoke--the smoke of all the hearth-fires in all the villages.
And this is the hour, this the incense, this the invocation of
Mother India, walking among the tree-trunks in the twilight, veiled
in the smoke of the hearth-fires of her children, her hands
outstretched in entreaty, blue stars shining in her hair.</p>

<p>For the rest, the Grand Trunk is just <i>Kim.</i> Read it again,
for all of it is true. Zam Zammah still stands in Lahore. Mahbub
Ali died three years ago, but his two boys are in England at
school. And the Old Lady still travels in her bullock-cart,
scolding shrilly through her curtains into the clouds of dust.

<h2>CHAPTER VI - THE EARTHLY GOD</h2>

<p>A beautiful Rolls-Royce of <b>His</b> Highness's sending was
whirling us along the road from the Guest House to the Palace. My
escort, one of the chief officials of the Prince's household, a
high-caste orthodox Brahman scholar easily at home in his European
dress, had already shown readiness to converse and to explain.</p>

<p>"Let us suppose," I now asked him, "that you have an infant
daughter. At what age will you marry her?"</p>

<p>"At five--at seven--but I must surely marry her," he replied in
his excellent English, "before she completes her ninth year."</p>

<p>"And if you do not, what is the penalty, and upon whom does it
fall?"</p>

<p>"It falls upon me; I am outcasted by my caste. None of them will
eat with me or give me water to drink or admit me to any ceremony.
None will give me his daughter to marry my son, so that I can have
no son's son of right birth. I shall have, in fact, no further
social existence. No fellow caste-man will even lend his shoulder
to carry my body to the burning-ghat. And my penance in the next
life will be heavier still than this."</p>

<p>"Then as to the child herself, what would befall her?"</p>

<p>"The child? Ah, yes. According to our law I must turn her out of
my house and send her into the forest alone. There I must leave her
with empty hands. Thenceforth I may not notice her in any way. Nor
may any Hindu give her food or help from the wild beasts, on
penalty of sharing the curse."</p>

<p>"And would you really do that thing?"</p>

<p>"No; for the reason that occasion would not arise. I could not
conceivably commit the sin whose consequence it is."</p>

<p>It was noticeable that in this picture the speaker saw no
suffering figure save his own.</p>

<p>A girl child, in the Hindu scheme, is usually a heavy and
unwelcome cash liability. Her birth elicits the formal condolences
of family friends. But not always would one find so ingenuous a
witness as that prosperous old Hindu landowner who said to me: "I
have had twelve children. Ten girls, which, naturally, did not
live. Who, indeed, could have borne that burden! The two boys, of
course, I preserved."</p>

<p class="quote">Yet Sir Michael O'Dwyer records a similar instance
of open speech from his own days of service as Settlement
Commissioner in Bharatpur:[1]</p>

<blockquote>[1. <i>India As I Knew It,</i> Sir Michael O'Dwyer,
Constable &amp; Co., Ltd&raquo; London, 1925, p. 102.]</blockquote>

<p>The sister of the Maharaja was to be married to a great Punjab
Sirdar. The family pressed [the Maharaja being a minor] for the
lavish expenditure usual on those occasions--&bull; &pound;30,000
to &pound;40,000--and the local members of the State Council
supported their view. The Political Agent--the State being then
under British supervision--and I strongly protested against such
extravagance in a year of severe scarcity and distress. Finally,
the matter was discussed in full Council. I asked the oldest member
of the Council to quote precedents--how much had been sanctioned on
similar marriages of the daughter or sister of a Maharaja in the
past. He shook his head and said there was no precedent. I said,
"How can that be?--the State has been in existence over two hundred
years, and there have been eleven successions without adoption,
from father to son; do you mean to tell me that there were never
any daughters?" The old man hesitated a little, and then said,
"Sahib, you know our customs, surely you know the reason. There
were daughters born, but till this generation they were not allowed
to grow up." And it was so.</p>

<p>But it is fair to remember that infanticide has been common not
with primitive races only but with Greece, with Rome, with nearly
all peoples known to history save those who have been affected by
Christian or Muhammadan culture. Forbidden in India by Imperial
law, the ancient practice, so easily followed in secret, seems
still to persist in many parts of the country.[2]</p>

<blockquote>[2. See <i>Census of India,</i> Vol. I, Part I, 1921,
Appendix VI. See also <i>The Punjab Peasant in Prosperity and
Debt,</i> M. L. Darling, Oxford, 1925, pp. 58-9.]</blockquote>

<p>Statistical proof in such matters is practically unattainable,
as will be realized later in this chapter. But the statement of the
Superintendent of the United Provinces Census[3] regarding girl
children of older growth is cautious enough to avoid all
pitfalls:</p>

<blockquote>[3. <i>Census of India,</i> 1911, Vol. XV, p.
190.]</blockquote>

<p class="quote">I very much doubt whether there is any active
dislike of girl babies...But if there is no active dislike, there
is unquestionably passive neglect. "The parents look after the son,
and God looks after the daughter." The daughter is less warmly
clad, she receives less attention when ill, and less and worse food
when well. This is not due to cruelty, or even to indifference; it
is due simply to the fact that the son is preferred to the daughter
and all the care, attention and dainties are lavished on him,
whilst the daughter must be content with the remnants of all
three...The result is that [the female] death-rate between one and
five is almost invariably somewhat higher than the male
death-rate.</p>

<p>This attitude toward the unwanted was illustrated in an incident
that I myself chanced upon in a hospital in Bengal. The patient, a
girl of five or six years, had fallen down a well and sustained a
bad cut across her head. The mother, with the bleeding and
unconscious child in her arms, had rushed to the hospital for help.
In a day or two tetanus developed. Now the child lay at death's
door, in agony terrible to see. The crisis was on, and the mother,
crouching beside her, a figure of grief and fear, muttered prayers
to the gods while the English doctor worked. Suddenly, there at the
bedside, stood a man--a Bengali <i>babu--</i>some sort of small
official or clerk.</p>

<p>"Miss Sahib," he said, addressing the doctor, "I have come for
my wife."</p>

<p>"Your wife!" exclaimed the doctor, sternly. "Look at your wife.
Look at your child. What do you mean!"</p>

<p>"I mean," he went on, "that I have come to fetch. my wife home,
at once, for my proper marital use."</p>

<p>"But your child will die if her mother leaves her now. You
cannot separate them--see!" and the child, who had somehow
understood the threat even through her mortal pain, clung to her
mother, wailing.</p>

<p>The woman threw herself prostrate upon the floor, clutched his
knees, imploring, kissed his feet, and with her two hands, Indian
fashion, took the dust from his feet and put it upon her head. "My
lord, my lord," she wept, "be merciful!"</p>

<p>"Come away," said he. "I have need of you, I say. You have left
me long enough."</p>

<p>"My lord--the child--the little child--my Master!"</p>

<p>He gave the suppliant figure a thrust with his foot. "I have
spoken"--and with never another word or look, turning on the
threshold, he walked away into the world of sun.</p>

<p>The woman rose. The child screamed.</p>

<p>"Will you obey?" exclaimed the doctor, incredulous for all her
years of seeing.</p>

<p>"I dare not disobey," sobbed the woman--and, pulling her veil
across her stricken face, she ran after her man--crouching, like a
small, weak animal.</p>

<p>The girl, going to her husband by her ninth or twelfth year, or
earlier, has little time and less chance to learn from books. But
two things she surely will have learned--her duty toward her
husband and her duty toward those gods and devils that concern
her.</p>

<p>Her duty toward her husband, as of old laid down in the
<i>Padmapurana</i>[4] is thus translated:[5]</p>

<blockquote>[4. The <i>Puranas,</i> ancient religious poems, are
the Bible of the Hindu peoples.]</blockquote>

<blockquote>[5. <i>Hindu Manners. Customs, and Ceremonies,</i> pp.
344-9.]</blockquote>

<p class="quote">There is no other god on earth for a woman than
her husband. The most excellent of all the good works that she can
do is to seek to please him by manifesting perfect obedience to
him. Therein should lie her sole rule of life.<br>
<br>
Be her husband deformed, aged, infirm, offensive in his manners;
let him also be choleric, debauched, immoral, a drunkard, a
gambler; let him frequent places of ill-repute, live in open sin
with other women, have no affection whatever for his home; let him
rave like a lunatic; let him live without honour; let him be blind,
deaf, dumb or crippled, in a word, let his defects be what they
may, let his wickedness be what it may, a wife should always look
upon him as her god, should lavish on him all her attention and
care, paying no heed whatsoever to his character and giving him no
cause whatsoever for displeasure...<br>
<br>
A wife must eat only after her husband has had his fill. If the
latter fasts, she shall fast, too; if he touch not food, she also
shall not touch it; if he be in affliction, she shall be so, too;
if he be cheerful she shall share his joy...She must, on the death
of her husband, allow herself to be burnt alive on the same funeral
pyre; then everybody will praise her virtue...<br>
<br>
If he sing she must be in ecstasy; if he dance she must look at-him
with delight; if he speak of learned things she must listen to him
with admiration. In his presence, indeed, she ought always to be
cheerful, and never show signs of sadness or discontent.<br>
<br>
Let her carefully avoid creating domestic squabbles on the subject
of her parents, or on account of another woman whom her husband may
wish to keep, or on account of any unpleasant remark which may have
been addressed to her. To leave the house for reasons such as these
would expose her to public ridicule, and would give cause for much
evil speaking.<br>
<br>
If her husband flies into a passion, threatens her, abuses her
grossly, even beats her unjustly, she shall answer him meekly,
shall lay hold of his hands, kiss them, and beg his pardon, instead
of uttering loud cries and running away from the house...<br>
<br>
Let all her words and actions give public proof that she looks upon
her husband as her god. Honoured by everybody, she shall thus enjoy
the reputation of a faithful and virtuous spouse.</p>

<p>The Abb&eacute; Dubois found this ancient law still the mode of
nineteenth-century Hinduism, and weighed its aspect with
philosophic care. His comment ran:[6]</p>

<blockquote>[6. <i>Hindu Manners, Customs, and Ceremonies,</i> p.
231.]</blockquote>

<p class="quote">A real union with sincere and mutual affection, or
even peace, is very rare in Hindu households. The moral gulf which
exists in this country between the sexes is so great that in the
eyes of a native the woman is simply a passive object who must be
abjectly submissive to her husband's will and fancy. She is never
looked upon as a companion who can share her husband's thoughts and
be the first object of his, care and affection. The Hindu wife
finds in her husband only a proud and overbearing master who
regards her as a fortunate woman to be allowed the honour of
sharing his bed and board.</p>

<p>In the handling of this point by the modern, Rabin-dranath
Tagore, appears another useful hint as to the caution we might well
observe in accepting, at their face value to us, the expressions of
Hindu speakers and writers. Says Tagore, presenting the Hindu
theory:[7]</p>

<blockquote>[7. <i>The Book of Marriage,</i> Keyserling, pp.
112-13.]</blockquote>

<p class="quote">For the purpose of marriage, spontaneous love is
unreliable; its proper cultivation should yield the best
results...and this cultivation should begin before marriage.
Therefore from their earliest years, the husband as an idea is held
up before our girls, in verse and story, through ceremonial and
worship. When at length they get this husband, he is to them not a
person but a principle, like loyalty, patriotism, or such other
abstractions...</p>

<p>As to the theory of the matter, let that be what it may. As to
the actual practice of the times, material will be recalled from
the previous pages of this book bearing upon the likeness of the
Hindu husband, as such, to "loyalty," "patriotism," or any
impersonal abstraction.</p>

<p>Mr. Gandhi tirelessly denounces the dominance of the old
teaching. "By sheer force of a vicious custom," he repeats, "even
the most ignorant and worthless men have been enjoying a
superiority over women which they do not deserve and ought not to
have."[8]</p>

<blockquote>[8. Quoted in <i>The Indian Social Reformer,</i> Oct.
29, 1922, p. 135.]</blockquote>

<p>But a creed through tens of centuries bred into weak, ignorant,
and fanatical peoples is not to be uprooted in one or two hundred
years; neither can it be shaken by the wrath of a single prophet,
however reverenced.</p>

<p>The general body of the ancient law relating to the status and
conduct of women yet reigns practically supreme among the great
Hindu majority.</p>

<p>In the Puranic code great stress is laid upon the duty of the
wife to her mother-in-law. Upon this foundation rests a tremendous
factor in every woman's life. A Hindu marriage does not betoken the
setting up of a new homestead; the little bride, on the contrary,
is simply added to the household of the groom's parents, as that
household already exists. There she becomes at once the
acknowledged servant of the mother-in-law, at whose beck and call
she lives. The father-in-law, the sister-in-law, demand what they
like of her, and, bred as she is, it lies not in her to rebel. The
very idea that she possibly could rebel or acquire any degree of
freedom has neither root nor ground in her mind. She exists to
serve. The mother-in-law is often hard, ruling without mercy or
affection; and if by chance the child is slow to bear children, or
if her children be daughters, then, too frequently, the elder
woman's tongue is a flail, her hand heavy in blows, her revengeful
spirit set on clouding her victim's life with threats of the new
wife who, according to the Hindu code, may supplant and enslave
her.</p>

<p>Not infrequently, in pursuing my inquiry in the rural districts,
I came upon the record of suicides of women between the ages of
fourteen and nineteen. The commonest cause assigned by the Indian
police recorder was "colic pains, and a quarrel with the
mother-in-law."</p>

<p>As to the direct relation o&pound; wife to husband, as
understood in high-class Hindu families today, it has thus been
described by that most eminent of Indian ladies, whose knowledge of
her sisters of all ranks and creeds is wide, deep, and kind, Miss
Cornelia Sorabji:[9]</p>

<blockquote>[9. <i>Between the Twilights,</i> Cornelia Sorabji,
Harper Brothers, London, 1908, pp. 125-32.]</blockquote>

<p class="quote">Chief priestess of her husband, whom to serve is
her religion and her delight...moving on a plane far below him for
all purposes religious, mental and social; gentle and adoring, but
incapable of participation in the larger interests of his life...To
please his mother, whose chief handmaiden she is, and to bring him
a son, these are her two ambitions...The whole idea of marriage in
the east revolves simply on the conception of life; a community of
interests, companionship, these never enter into the general
calculation. She waits upon her husband when he feeds, silent in
his presence, with downcast eyes. To look him in the face were bold
indeed.</p>

<p>Then says Miss Sorabji, continuing her picture:[10]</p>

<blockquote>[10. <i>Ibid.,</i> pp. 45-6.]</blockquote>

<p class="quote">When she is the mother of a son, greater respect
is hers from the other women in the zenana ...she has been
successful, has justified her existence. The self-respect it gives
the woman herself is most marked. She is still a faithful! slave to
her husband, but she is an entity, a person, in so far as that is
possible in a Hindu zenana; she can lift her head above the women
who taunted her, her heart above the fear of a rival.</p>

<p>This general characterization of the wife in the <i>zenana</i>
of educated, well-to-do, and prominent Hindus finds its faithful
echo in one of many similar incidents that came to my notice in
humbler fields. For the orthodox Hindu woman, whoever she be, will
obey the law of her ancestors and her gods with a pride and
integrity unaffected by her social condition.</p>

<p>The woman, in this case, was the wife of a small landowner in a
district not far from Delhi. The man, unusually enlightened, sent
her to hospital for her first confinement. But he sent her too
late, and, after a severe ordeal, the child was born dead.</p>

<p>Again, the following year, the same story was repeated. The
patient was brought late, and even the necessary Caesarean
operation did not save the child. Still a third time the
<i>zemindar</i> appeared, bringing the wife; but now, taught by
experience, he had moved in time. As the woman came out of the
ether, the young English nurse bent over her, all aglow with the
news.</p>

<p>"Little mother, happy little mother, don't you want to see your
baby--don't you want to see your boy?"</p>

<p>The head on the pillow turned away. Faintly, slowly the words
came back out of the pit of hopeless night:</p>

<p>"Who wants to see--a dead baby! I have seen--too many--too
many--dead--dead--" The voice trailed into silence. The heavy
eyelids closed.</p>

<p>Then Sister picked up the baby. Baby squealed.</p>

<p>On that instant the thing was already done--so quickly done that
none could measure the time of its doing. The lifeless figure on
the bed tautened. The great black eyes flashed wide. The thin arms
lifted in a gesture of demand. For the first time in all her life,
perhaps, this girl was thinking in the imperative.</p>

<p>"Give me my son!" She spoke as an empress might speak. "Send at
once to my village and inform the father of my son that I desire
his presence." Utterly changed. Endued with dignity--with
self-respect--with importance.</p>

<p>The father came. All the relatives came, heaping like flies into
the little family quarters attached, in Indian women's hospitals,
to each private room. Ten days they sat there--over a dozen of
them, in a space some fifteen by twenty feet square. And on the
tenth, in a triumphant procession, they bore home to their village
mother and son.</p>

<p>Rich or poor, high caste or low caste, the mother of a son will
idolize the child. She has little knowledge to give him, save
knowledge of strange taboos and fears and charms and ceremonies to
propitiate a universe of powers unseen. She would never discipline
him, even though she knew the meaning of the word. She would never
teach him to restrain passion or impulse or appetite. She has not
the vaguest conception how to feed him or develop him. Her idea of
a sufficient meal is to tie a string around his little brown body
and stuff him till the string bursts. And so through all his
childhood he grows as grew his father before him, back into the
mists of time.</p>

<p>Yet, when the boy himself assumes married life, he will honor
his mother above his wife, and show her often a real affection and
deference. Then it is that the woman comes into her own, ruling
indoors with an iron hand, stoutly maintaining the ancient
tradition, and, forgetful of her former misery, visiting upon the
slender shoulders of her little daughters-in-law all the burdens
and the wrath that fell upon her own young back. But one higher
step is perhaps reserved for her. With each grandson laid in her
arms she is again exalted. The family line is secure. Her husband's
soul is protected. Proud is she among women. Blessed be the gods!

<h2>CHAPTER VII - WAGES OF SIN</h2>

<p>The reverse of the picture shows the Hindu widow--the accursed.
That so hideous a fate as widowhood should befall a woman can be
but for one cause--the enormity of her sins in a former
incarnation. From the moment of her husband's decease till the last
hour of her own life, she must expiate those sins in shame and
suffering and self-immolation, chained in every thought to the
service of his soul. Be she a child of three, who knows nothing of
the marriage that bound her, or be she a wife in fact, having lived
with her husband, her case is the same. By his death she is
revealed as a creature of innate guilt and evil portent, herself
convinced, when she is old enough to think at all, of the justice
of her fate. Miss Sorabji thus treats the subject:[l]</p>

<blockquote>[1. <i>Between the Twilights,</i> pp.
144-6.]</blockquote>

<p class="quote">The orthodox Hindu widow suffers her lot with the
fierce enjoyment of martyrdom...but nothing can minimize the evils
of that lot...That she accepts the fact makes it no less of a
hardship. For some sin committed in a previous birth, the gods have
deprived her of a husband. What is left to her now but to work out
his "salvation" and by her prayers and penances to win him a better
place in his next genesis?...For the mother-in-law, what also is
left but the obligation to curse?...But for this luckless one, her
son might still be in the land of the living. ...There is no
determined animosity in the attitude. The person cursing is as much
an instrument of Fate as the person cursed...[But] it is all very
well to assert no personal animosity toward her whom you hold it a
privilege to curse and to burden with every unpleasant duty
imaginable. Your practise is apt to mislead.</p>

<p>The widow becomes the menial of every other person in the house
of her late husband. All the hardest and ugliest tasks are hers, no
comforts, no ease. She may take but one meal a day and that of the
meanest. She must perform strict fasts. Her hair must be shaven
off. She must take care to absent herself from any scene of
ceremony or rejoicing, from a marriage, from a religious
celebration, from the sight of an expectant mother or of any person
whom the curse of her glance might harm. Those who speak to her may
speak in terms of contempt and reproach; and she herself is the
priestess of her own misery, for its due continuance is her one
remaining merit.</p>

<p>The old French traveler, Bernier, states that the pains of
widowhood were imposed "as an easy mode of keeping wives in
subjection, of securing their attention in times of sickness, and
of deterring them from administering poison to their
husbands."[2]</p>

<blockquote>[2. <i>Travels in the Mogul Empire, A.D. 1656-1668,</i>
Fran&ccedil;ois Bernier, Oxford University Press, 1916, pp.
310-11.]</blockquote>

<p>But once, however, did I hear this idea from a Hindu's lips. "We
husbands so often make our wives unhappy," said this frank witness,
"that we might well fear they would poison us. Therefore did our
wise ancestors make the penalty of widowhood so frightful--in order
that the woman may not be tempted."</p>

<p>In the female wards of prisons in many parts of India I have
seen women under sentence for the murder of their husbands. These
are perhaps rare mentalities, perhaps hysteria cases. More
characteristic are the still-recurring instances of practical
<i>suttee,</i> where the newly-widowed wife deliberately pours oil
over her garments, sets them afire and burns to death, in a
connived-at secrecy. She has seen the fate of other widows. She is
about to become a drudge, a slave, starved, tyrannized over,
abused--and this is the sacred way out--"following the divine law."
Committing a pious and meritorious act, in spite of all
foreign-made interdicts, she escapes a present hell and may hope
for happier birth in her next incarnation.</p>

<p>Although demanded in the scripture already quoted, the practice
of burning the widow upon the husband's funeral pyre is today
unlawful. But it must be noted that this change represents an
exceptional episode; it represents not a natural advance of public
opinion, but one of the rare incursions of the British strong hand
into the field of native religions. <i>Suttee</i> was forbidden by
British Governors[3] some twenty-nine years before the actual
taking over by the Crown of direct government. That advanced
Indian, Raja Ram Mohan Roy, supported the act. But other
influential Bengali gentlemen, vigorously opposing, did not
hesitate to push their fight for the preservation of the practice
even to the court of last resort--the Privy Council in London.</p>

<blockquote>[3. Regulation XVII of 1829.]</blockquote>

<p>Is it conceivable that, given opportunity, the submerged root of
the matter might come again to life and light? In Mr. Gandhi's
weekly[4] of November 11, 1926, a Hindu writer declares the
impossibility of a widow's remarriage today, without the deathbed
permission of the deceased husband. No devout husband will give
such permission, the correspondent affirms, and adds: "He will
rather fain agree to his wife's becoming <i>sati</i> [suttee] if
she can."</p>

<blockquote>[4. <i>Young India.</i>]</blockquote>

<p>An inmate of her husband's home at the time of his death, the
widow, although she has no legal claim for protection, may be
retained there on the terms above described, or she may be turned
adrift. Then she must live by charity--or by prostitution, into
which she not seldom falls. And her dingy, ragged figure, her
bristly, shaven head, even though its stubble be white over the
haggard face of unhappy age, is often to be seen in temple crowds
or in the streets of pilgrimage cities, where sometimes niggard
piety doles her a handful of rice.</p>

<p>As to remarriage, that, in orthodox Hinduism, is impossible.
Marriage is not a personal affair, but an eternal sacrament. And it
must never be forgotten that the great majority of the Hindus are
orthodox to the bone. Whether the widow be an infant and a stranger
to the man whose death, she is told, was caused by her sins, or
whether she be twenty and of his bed and board, orthodoxy forbids
her remarriage. <b>Of</b> recent years, however, the gradual if
unrecognized influence of western teaching has aroused a certain
response. In different sections of India, several associations have
sprung up, having the remarriage of virgin widows as one of their
chief purported objects. The movement, however, is almost wholly
restricted to the most advanced element of Hindu society, and its
influence is, as yet, too fractional appreciably to affect
statistics.</p>

<p>The observations on this point made by the Abb&eacute; Dubois a
century since still, in general, hold good. He saw that the
marriage of a small child to a man of sixty and the forbidding of
her remarriage after his death must often throw the child, as a
widow, into a dissolute life. Yet widow remarriage was unknown.
Even were it permitted, says the Abb&eacute;, "the strange
preference which Brahmins have for children of very tender years
would make such a permission almost nominal in the case of their
widows."[5]</p>

<blockquote>[5. <i>Hindu Manners, Customs and Ceremonies,</i> p.
212.]</blockquote>

<p>And one cannot forget, in estimating the effect of the young
widow on the social structure of which she is a part, that, in her
infancy, she lived in the same atmosphere of sexual stimulus that
surrounded the boy child, her brother. If a girl child so reared in
thought and so sharpened in desire be barred from lawful
satisfaction of desire, is it strange if the desire prove stronger
with her than the social law? Her family, the family of the dead
husband, will, for their credit's sake, restrain her if they can.
And often, perhaps most often, she needs no restraint save her own
spirit of sacrifice. But the opposite example is frequently
commented upon by Indian speakers. Lala Lajpat Rai, Swarajist
politician, laments:[6]</p>

<blockquote>[6. Presidential Speech delivered before the Hindu
Mahasabha Conference, in Bombay, December, 1925.]</blockquote>

<p class="quote">The condition of child-widows is indescribable.
God may bless those who are opposed to their remarriage, but their
superstition introduces so many abuses and brings about so much
moral and physical misery as to cripple society as a whole and
handicap it in the struggle for life.</p>

<p>Mr. Gandhi acquiescently cites another Indian writer on child
marriage and enforced child widowhood, thus: "It is bringing into
existence thousands of girl-widows every year who in their turn are
a source of corruption and dangerous infection to society."[7]</p>

<blockquote>[7. <i>Young India,</i> Aug. 26, 1926, p.
302.]</blockquote>

<p>Talk there is, resolutions passed, in caste and association
conventions, as to changing these things of oppression and of
scornings. But a virgin widow's remarriage is still a headline
event, even to the reform newspapers, while the remarriage of a
Hindu widowed wife is still held to be inconceivable.</p>

<p>And here, curiously enough, the very influence that on the one
hand most strongly operates to rescue the woman, on the other more
widely enslaves her. While British practice and western education
tend, at the top of the ladder, to breed discontent with ancient
darkness, British public works, British sanitation and agricultural
development, steadily raising the economic condition of the lower
classes, as steadily breed aspirants to greater social prestige.
Thus the census of 1921 finds restriction in widow remarriage
definitely increasing in those low ranks of the social scale that,
by their own code, have no such inhibition. Hindu caste rank is
entirely independent of worldly wealth; but the first move of the
man of little place, suddenly awakening to a new prosperity,
security, and peace, is to mimic the manners of those to whom he
has looked up. He becomes a social climber, not less in India than
in the United States, and assumes the shackles of the elect.</p>

<p>Mr. Mukerjea of Baroda, an Indian official observer, thus writes
of attempts to break down the custom of obligatory
widowhood:[8]</p>

<blockquote>[8. <i>Census of India,</i> 1921, Vol. I, Chapter VII,
paragraph 134.]</blockquote>

<p class="quote">All such efforts will be powerless as long as
authoritative Hindu opinion continues to regard the prohibition of
widow remarriage as a badge of respectability. Amongst the lower
Hindu castes, the socially affluent sections are discountenancing
the practice of widow remarriage as actively as any Brahman.</p>

<p>It was a distinguished Bengali, the Pundit Iswar Chunder
Vidyasagar, who, among Indians, started the movement for remarriage
of virgin widows and supported Government in the enactment of a law
legalizing such remarriages. But over him and the fruit of his work
another eminent Indian thus laments:[9]</p>

<blockquote>[9. <i>A Nation in the Making.</i> Sir Surendranath
Banerjea, Oxford University Press, 1925, pp. 8-9]</blockquote>

<p class="quote">I well remember the stir and agitation which the
movement produced and how orthodox Hindus were up in arms against
it...The champion of the Hindu widows died a disappointed man, like
so many of those who were in advance of their age, leaving his
message unfulfilled...The progress which the movement has made
since his death in 1891 has been slow. A new generation has sprung
up, but he has found no successor. The mantle of Elijah has not
fallen upon Elisha. The lot of the Hindu widow today remains very
much the same that it was fifty years ago. There are few to wipe
her tears and to remove the enforced widowhood that is her lot. The
group of sentimental sympathisers have perhaps increased--shouting
at public meetings on the Vidyasagar anniversary day, but leaving
unredeemed the message of the great champion of the Hindu
widow.</p>

<p>Mr. Gandhi, always true to his light, himself has said:[10]</p>

<blockquote>[8. <i>Census of India,</i> 1921, Vol. I, Chapter VII,
paragraph 134.]</blockquote>

<p class="quote">To force widowhood upon little girls is a brutal
crime for which we Hindus are daily paying dearly...There is no
warrant in any <i>shastra[11]</i> for such widowhood. Voluntary
widowhood consciously adopted by a woman who has felt the affection
of a partner adds grace and dignity to life, sanctifies the home
and uplifts religion itself. Widowhood imposed by religion or
custom is an unbearable yoke and defiles the home by secret vice
and degrades religion. And does not the Hindu widowhood stink in
one's nostrils when one thinks of old and diseased men over fifty
taking or rather purchasing girl wives, sometimes one on top of
another?</p>

<blockquote>[11. Hindu book of sacred institutes.]</blockquote>

<p>But this, again, is a personal opinion, rather than a public
force. "We want no more of Gandhi's doctrines," one conspicuous
Indian politician told me 5 "Gandhi is a deluded man."</p>

<p>That distinguished Indian, Sir Ganga Ram, C.I.E., C.V.O., with
some help from Government has built and endowed a fine home and
school for Hindu widows in the city of Lahore. This establishment,
in 1926, had over forty inmates. In Bombay Presidency are five
Government-aided institutes for widows and deserted wives, run by
philanthropic Indian gentlemen. Other such institutions may exist;
but, if they do, their existence has escaped the official
recorders. I myself saw, in the pilgrim city of Nawadwip, in
Bengal, a refuge for widows maintained by local subscription and
pilgrims' gifts. It was fourteen years old and had eight
inmates--the extent, it appeared, of its intention and
capacity.</p>

<p>The number of widows in India is, according to the latest
published official computation, 26,834,838.[12]</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII - MOTHER INDIA</h2>

<p>Row upon row of girl children--little tots all, four, five, six,
even seven years old, sitting cross-legged on the floor, facing the
brazen goddess. Before each one, laid straight and tidy, certain
treasures--a flower, a bead or two, a piece of fruit--precious
things brought from their homes as sacrificial offerings. For this
is a sort of day-school of piety. These babies are learning
texts--"mantrims" to use in worship--learning the rites that belong
to the various ceremonies incumbent upon Hindu women. And that is
all they are learning; that is all they need to know. Now in unison
they pray.</p>

<p>"What are they praying for?" one asks the teacher, a grave-faced
Hindu lady.</p>

<p>"What should a woman-child pray for? A husband, if she is not
married; or, if she is, then for a better husband at her next
re-birth."</p>

<p>Women pray first as to husbands; then, to bear sons. Men must
have sons to serve their souls.</p>

<p>Already we have seen some evidence of the general attitude of
the Hindu toward this, the greatest of all his concerns, in its
prenatal aspect. But another cardinal point that, in any practical
survey of Indian competency, can be neither contested nor
suppressed, is the manner in which the Hindu of all classes permits
his much-coveted son to be ushered into the light of day.</p>

<p>We have spoken of women's hospitals in various parts of India.
These are doing excellent work, mostly gynecological. But they are
few, relatively to the work to be done, nor could the vast majority
of Indian women, in their present state of development, be induced
to use a hospital, were it at their very door.</p>

<p>What the typical Indian woman wants in her hour of trial is the
thing to which she is historically used--the midwife--the
<i>dhai.</i> And the <i>dhai</i> is a creature that must indeed be
seen to be credited.</p>

<p>According to the Hindu code, a woman in childbirth and in
convalescence therefrom is ceremonially unclean, contaminating all
that she touches. Therefore only those become <i>dhais</i> who are
themselves of the unclean, "untouchable" class, the class whose
filthy habits will be adduced by the orthodox Hindu as his good and
sufficient reason for barring them from contact with himself. Again
according to the Hindu code, a woman in childbirth, like the
new-born child itself, is peculiarly susceptible to the "evil eye."
Therefore no woman whose child has died, no one who has had an
abortion, may, in many parts of India, serve as <i>dhai,</i>
because of the malice or jealousy that may secretly inspire her.
Neither may any widow so serve, being herself a thing of evil omen.
Not all of these disqualifications obtain everywhere. But each
holds in large sections.</p>

<p>Further, no sort of training is held necessary for the Work. As
a calling, it descends in families. At the death of a <i>dhai,</i>
her daughter or daughter-in-law may adopt it, beginning at once to
practice even though she has never seen a confinement in all her
life.[1] But other women, outside the line of descent, may also
take on the work and, if they are properly beyond the lines of the
taboos, will find ready employment without any sort of preparation
and for the mere asking.</p>

<blockquote>[1. Cf. Edris Griffin, Health Visitor, Delhi, in
<i>National Health,</i> Oct, 1925, p. 125.]</blockquote>

<p>Therefore, in total, you have the half-blind, the aged, the
crippled, the palsied and the diseased, drawn from the dirtiest
poor, as sole ministrants to the women of India in the most
delicate, the most dangerous and the most important hour of their
existence.</p>

<p>The expectant mother makes no preparations for the baby's
coming--such as the getting ready of little garments. This would be
taking dangerously for granted the favor of the gods. But she may
and does toss into a shed or into a small dark chamber whatever
soiled and disreputable rags, incapable of further use, fall from
the hands of the household during the year.</p>

<p>And it is into this evil-smelling rubbish-hole that the young
wife creeps when her hour is come upon her. "Unclean" she is, in
her pain--unclean whatever she touches, and fit thereafter only to
be destroyed. In the name of thrift, therefore, give her about her
only the unclean and the worthless, whether human or inanimate. If
there be a broken-legged, ragged string-cot, let her have that to
lie upon; it can be saved in that same black chamber for the next
to need it. Otherwise, make her a little support of cow-dung or of
stones, on the bare earthen floor. And let no one waste effort in
sweeping or dusting or washing the place till this occasion be
over.[2]</p>

<blockquote>[2. <i>National Health,</i> 1925, p. 70. See also
Maggie Ghose in <i>Victoria Memorial Scholarship Fund Report,</i>
Calcutta, 1918, p. 153.]</blockquote>

<p>When the pains begin, send for the <i>dhai.</i> If the
<i>dhai,</i> when the call reaches her, chances to be wearing
decent clothes, she will stop, whatever the haste, to change into
the rags she keeps for the purpose, infected and re-infected from
the succession of diseased cases that have come into her practice.
And so, at her dirtiest, a bearer of multiple contagions, she shuts
herself in with her victim.</p>

<p>If there be an air-hole in the room, she stops it up with straw
and refuse; fresh air is bad in confinements--it gives fever. If
there be rags sufficient to make curtains, she cobbles them
together, strings them across a corner and puts the patient within,
against the wall, still farther to keep away the air. Then, to make
darkness darker, she lights the tiniest glim--a bit of cord in a
bit of oil, or a little kerosene lamp without a chimney, smoking
villainously. Next, she makes a small charcoal fire in a pan
beneath the bed or close by the patient's side, whence it joins its
poisonous breath to the serried stenches.</p>

<p>The first <i>dhai</i> that I saw in action tossed upon this
coal-pot, as I entered the room, a handful of some special
vile-smelling stuff to ward off the evil eye--my evil eye. The
smoke of it rose thick--also a tongue of flame. By that light one
saw her Witch-of-Endor face through its vermin-infested elf-locks,
her hanging rags, her dirty claws, as she peered with festered and
almost sightless eyes out over the stink-cloud she had raised. But
it was not she who ran to quench the flame that caught in the bed
and went writhing up the body of her unconscious patient. She was
too blind--too dull of sense to see or to feel it.</p>

<p>If the delivery is at all delayed, the <i>dhai</i> is expected
to explore for the reason of the delay. She thrusts her
long-unwashed hand, loaded with dirty rings and bracelets and
encrusted with untold living contaminations, into the patient's
body, pulling and twisting at what she finds there.[3] If the
delivery is long delayed and difficult, a second or a third
<i>dhai</i> may be called in, if the husband of the patient will
sanction the expense, and the child may be dragged forth in
detached sections--a leg or an arm torn off at a time.[4]</p>

<blockquote>[3. <i>V.M.S.F. Report,</i> "Improvement of the
Conditions of Child-Birth in India," pp. 70 et seq.]</blockquote>

<blockquote>[4. Dr. Marion A. Wylie., M.A., M.B., Ch. B.,
<i>Ibid.,</i> p. 85, and <i>Ibid.,</i> Appendix V, p.
69.]</blockquote>

<p>Again to quote from a medical woman:[5]</p>

<blockquote>[5. <i>Ibid.,</i> p. 71.]</blockquote>

<p class="quote">One often sees in cases of contracted pelvis due
to osteo-malacia, if there seems no chance of the head passing down
[that the <i>dhai</i> attempts to draw on the limbs, and, if
possible, breaks them off. She prefers to extract the child <i>by
main force,</i> and the patient in such cases is badly torn, often
into her bladder, with the resulting large vesico-vaginal fistulae
so common in Indian women, and which cause them so much misery.</p>

<p>Such labor may last three, four, five, even six days. During all
this period the woman is given no nourishment whatever--such is the
code--and the <i>dhai</i> resorts to all her traditions. She kneads
the patient with her fists; stands her against the wall and butts
her with her head; props her upright on the bare ground, seizes her
hands and shoves against her thighs with gruesome bare feet,[6]
until, so the doctors state, the patient's flesh is often torn to
ribbons by the <i>dhai's</i> long, ragged toe-nails. Or, she lays
the woman flat and walks up and down her body, like one treading
grapes. Also, she makes balls of strange substances, such as
hollyhock roots, or dirty string, or rags full of quince-seeds; or
earth, or earth mixed with cloves, butter and marigold flowers; or
nuts, or spices--any irritant--and thrusts them into the uterus, to
hasten the event. In some parts of the country, goats' hair,
scorpions' stings, monkey-skulls, and snake-skins are considered
valuable applications.[7]</p>

<blockquote>[6. <i>V.M.S.F. Report,</i> p. 99, Dr. K. O.
Vaughan.]</blockquote>

<blockquote>[7. <i>Ibid.,</i> pp. 151-2, Mrs. Chowdhri,
sub-assistant surgeon.]</blockquote>

<p>These insertions and the wounds they occasion commonly result in
partial or complete permanent closing of the passage.</p>

<p>If the afterbirth be over five minutes in appearing, again the
filthy, ringed and bracelet-loaded hand and wrist are thrust in,
and the placenta is ripped loose and dragged away.[8]</p>

<blockquote>[8. <i>V.M.S.F. Report,</i> p. 86, Dr. M. A.
Wylie.]</blockquote>

<p>No clean clothes are provided for use in the confinement, and no
hot water. Fresh cow-dung or goats' droppings, or hot ashes,
however, often serve as heating agents when the patient's body
begins to turn cold.[9]</p>

<blockquote>[9. <i>Ibid.,</i> p. 152, Miss Vidyabai M.
Ram.]</blockquote>

<p>In Benares, sacred among cities, citadel of orthodox Hinduism,
the sweepers, all of whom are "Untouchables," are divided into
seven grades. From the first come the <i>dhais;</i> from the last
and lowest come the "cord-cutters." To cut the umbilical cord is
considered a task so degrading that in the Holy City even a sweep
will not undertake it, unless she be at the bottom of her kind.
Therefore the unspeakable <i>dhai</i> brings with her a still more
unspeakable servant to wreak her quality upon the mother and the
child in birth.</p>

<p>Sometimes it is a split bamboo that they use; sometimes a bit of
an old tin can, or a rusty nail, or a potsherd or a fragment of
broken glass. Sometimes, having no tool of their own and having
found nothing sharp-edged lying about, they go out to the neighbors
to borrow. I shall not soon forget the cry: "Hi, there, inside!
Bring me back that knife! I hadn't finished paring my vegetables
for dinner."</p>

<p>The end of the cut cord, at best, is left undressed, to take
care of itself. In more careful and less happy cases, it is treated
with a handful of earth, or with charcoal, or with several other
substances, including cow-dung. Needless to add, a heavy per cent,
of such children as survive the strain of birth, die of
lock-jaw[10] or of erysipelas.</p>

<blockquote>[10. "Ordinarily half the children born in Bengal die
before reaching the age of eight years, and only one-quarter of the
population reaches the age of forty years...As to the causes
influencing infant mortality, 50 per cent, of the deaths are due to
debility at birth and 11.4 per cent, to tetanus." <i>54th Annual
Report of the Director of Public Health of Bengal,</i> pp.
8-10.]</blockquote>

<p>As the child is taken from the mother, it is commonly laid upon
the bare floor, uncovered and unattended, until the <i>dhai</i> is
ready to take it up. If it be a girl child, many simple rules have
been handed down through the ages for discontinuing the unwelcome
life then and there.</p>

<p>In the matter of feeding, practice varies. In the Central
Provinces, the first feedings are likely to be of crude sugar mixed
with the child's own urine.[11] In Delhi, it may get sugar and
spices, or wine, or honey, Or, it may be fed for the first three
days on something called <i>gutli,</i> a combination of spices in
which have been stewed old rust-encrusted lucky coins and charms
written out on scraps of paper. These things, differing somewhat in
different regions, castes and communities, differ more in detail
than in the quality of intelligence displayed.</p>

<blockquote>[11. <i>V.M.S.F. Report,</i> p. 86, Dr. M. A.
Wylie.]</blockquote>

<p>As to the mother, she, as has already been said, is usually kept
without any food or drink for from four to seven days from the
outset of her confinement; or, if she be fed, she is given only a
few dry nuts and dates. The purpose here seems sometimes to be one
of thrift--to save the family utensils from pollution. But in any
case it enjoys the prestige of an ancient tenet to which the
economical spirit of the household lends a spontaneous
support.[12]</p>

<blockquote>[12. Edris Griffin, in <i>National Health,</i> Oct.,
1925, p. 124.]</blockquote>

<p>In some regions or communities the baby is not put to the breast
till after the third day[13]--a custom productive of dire results.
But in others the mother is expected to feed not only the newly
born, but her elder children as well, if she have them. A child
three years old will not seldom be sent in to be fed at the
mother's breast during the throes of a difficult labor. "It
cried--it was hungry. It wouldn't have other food," the women
outside will explain.</p>

<blockquote>[13. <i>V.M.S.F. Report,</i> p. 86.]</blockquote>

<p>As a result, first, of their feeble and diseased ancestry;
second, of their poor diet; and, third, of their own infant
marriage and premature sexual use and infection, a heavy percentage
of the women of India are either too small-boned or too internally
misshapen and diseased to give normal birth to a child, but require
surgical aid. It may safely be said that all these cases die by
slow torture, unless they receive the care of a British or American
woman doctor, or of an Indian woman, British-trained.[14] Such
care, even though it be at hand, is often denied the sufferer,
either by the husband or by the elder women of the family, in their
devotion to the ancient cults.</p>

<blockquote>[14. For the male medical student in India, instruction
in gynecology and midwifery is extremely difficult to get, for the
reason that Indian women can rarely be persuaded to come to
hospitals open to medical men. With the exception of certain
extremely limited opportunities, therefore, the Indian student must
get his gynecology from books. Even though he learns it abroad, he
has little or no opportunity to practice it. Sometimes, it is true,
the western-diplomaed Indian doctor will conduct a labor case by
sitting on the far side of a heavy curtain calling out advice based
on the statements shouted across by the <i>dhai</i> who is handling
the patient. But this scarcely constitutes "practice" as the word
is generally meant.]</blockquote>

<p>Or, even in cases where a delivery is normal, the results, from
an Indian point of view, are often more tragic than death. An able
woman surgeon, Dr. K. O. Vaughan, of the Zenana Hospital at
Srinagar, thus expresses it:[15]</p>

<blockquote>[15. <i>VMS.F. Report,</i> pp. 98-9.]</blockquote>

<p class="quote">Many women who are childless and permanently
disabled are so from the maltreatment received during parturition;
many men are without male issue because the child has been killed
by ignorance when born, or their wives so mangled by the midwives
they are incapable of further childbearing...<br>
<br>
I [illustrate] my remarks with a few cases typical of the sort of
thing every medical woman practising in this country
encounters.<br>
<br>
A summons comes, and we are told a woman is in labour. On arrival
at the house we are taken into a small, dark and dirty room, often
with no window. If there is one it is stopped up. Puerperal fever
is supposed to be caused by fresh air. The remaining air is
vitiated by the presence of a charcoal fire burning in a pan, and
on a <i>charpoy</i> [cot] or on the floor is the woman. With her
are one or two dirty old women, their clothes filthy, their hands
begrimed with dirt, their heads alive with vermin. They explain
that they are midwives, that the patient has been in labour three
days, and they cannot get the child out. They are rubbing their
hands on the floor previous to making another effort. On inspection
we find the vulva swollen and torn. They tell us, yes, it is a bad
case and they have had to use both feet and hands in their effort
to deliver her...Chloroform is given and the child extracted with
forceps. We are sure to find hollyhock roots which have been pushed
inside the mother, sometimes string and a dirty rag containing
quince-seeds in the uterus itself...<br>
<br>
Do not think it is the poor only who suffer like this. I can show
you the homes of many Indian men with University degrees whose
wives are confined on filthy rags and attended by these Bazaar
<i>dhais</i> because it is the custom, and the course for the B.A.
degree does not include a little common sense.</p>

<p>Doctor Vaughan then proceeds to quote further illustrations from
her own practice, of which the following is a specimen:[16]</p>

<blockquote>[16. <i>V.M.S.F. Report,</i> pp. 99-100.]</blockquote>

<p class="quote">A wealthy Hindu, a graduate of an Indian
University and a lecturer himself, a man who is highly educated,
calls us to his house, as his wife has been delivered of a child
and has fever...We find that [the <i>dhai</i>] had no disinfectants
as they would have cost her about Rs. 3 [one dollar, American], and
the fee she will get on the case is only Rs. I and a few dirty
clothes. The patient is lying on a heap of cast-off and dirty
clothes, an old waistcoat, an English railway rug, a piece of
water-proof packing from a parcel, half a stained and dirty shirt
of her husband's. There are no sheets or clean rags of any kind. As
her husband tells me: "We shall give her clean things on the fifth
day, but not now; that is ou&iuml; custom."<br>
<br>
That woman, in spite of all we could do, died of septicaemia
contracted either from the dirty clothing which is saved from one
confinement in the family to another [unwashed], or from the
<i>dhai,</i> who did her best in the absence of either hot water,
soap, nail-brush or disinfectants.</p>

<p>Evidence is in hand of educated, traveled and wellborn Indians,
themselves holders of European university degrees, who permit their
wives to undergo this same inheritance of darkness. The case may be
cited of an Indian medical man, holding an English University's
Ph.D. and M.D. degrees, considered to be exceptionally able and
brilliant and now actually in charge of a government center for the
training of <i>dhais</i> in modern midwifery. His own young wife
being recently confined, he yielded to the pressure of the elder
women of his family and called in an old-school <i>dhai,</i> dirty
and ignorant as the rest, to attend her. The wife died of puerperal
fever; the child died in the birth. "When we have the spectacle of
even educated Indians with English degrees allowing their wives and
children to be killed off like flies by ignorant midwives," says
Doctor Vaughan again, "we can faintly imagine the sufferings of
their humbler sisters."</p>

<p>But the question of station or of worldly goods has small part
in the matter. To this the admirable sisterhood of English and
American women doctors unites to testify.</p>

<p>Dr. Marion A\Wylie's words are:[17]</p>

<blockquote>[17. <i>Ibid.,</i> p. 86.]</blockquote>

<p class="quote">These conditions are by no means confined to the
poorest or most ignorant classes. I have attended the families of
Rajahs, where many of these practices were carried out, and met
with strenuous opposition when I introduced ventilation and aseptic
measures.</p>

<p>Sweeper-girl or Brahman, outcaste or queen, there ia essentially
little to choose between their lots, in that fierce moment for
which alone they were born. An. Indian Christian lady of
distinguished position and attainment, whose character has opened
to her many doors that remain to others fast closed, gives the
following story of her visit of mercy to a child-princess.</p>

<p>The little thing, wife of a ruling prince and just past her
tenth year, was already in labor when her visitor entered the room.
The <i>dhais</i> were busy over her, but the case was obviously
serious, and priestly assistance had been called. Outside the door
sat its exponent--an old man, reading aloud from the scriptures and
from time to time chanting words of direction deciphered from his
book.</p>

<p>"Hark, within, there!" he suddenly shouted. "Now it is time to
make a fire upon this woman's body. Make and light a fire upon her
body, quick!"</p>

<p>Instantly the <i>dhais</i> set about to obey.</p>

<p>"And what will the fire do to our little princess?" quietly
asked the visitor, too practiced to express alarm.</p>

<p>"Oh," replied the women, listlessly, "if it be her fate to live,
she will live, and there will, of course, be a great scar branded
upon her. Or, if it be her fate to die, then she will die"--and on
they went with their fire-building.</p>

<p>Out to the ministrant squatting at the door flew the
quick-witted visitor. "Holy One," she asked, "are you not afraid of
the divine jealousies? You are about to make the
Fire-sacrifice--but this is a queen, not a common mortal. Will not
Mother Ganges see and be jealous that no honor is paid to her?"</p>

<p>The old man looked up, perplexed. "It is true," he said, "it is
true the gods are ever jealous and easily provoked to anger--but
the Book here surely says--" And his troubled eyes turned to the
ancient writ outspread upon his knees.</p>

<p>"Have you Ganges water here in the house?" interrupted the
other.</p>

<p>"Surely. Dare the house live without it!" answered the old
one.</p>

<p>"Then here is what I am given to say: Let water of Holy Ganges
be put upon bright fire and made thrice hot. Let it then be poured
into a marvel-sack that the gods, by my hand, shall provide. And
let that sack be laid upon the Maharani's body. So in a united
offering--fire and water together--shall the gods be propitiated
and their wrath escaped,"</p>

<p>"This is wisdom. So be it!" cried the old man. Then quick ran
the visitor to fetch her Bond Street hot-water bag.</p>

<p>Superstition, among the Indian peoples, knows few boundary lines
of condition or class. Women in general are prone to believe that
disease is an evidence of the approach of a god. Medicine and
surgery, driving that god away, offend him, and it is ill business
to offend the Great Ones; better, therefore, charms and
propitiations, with an eye to the long run.</p>

<p>And besides the gods, there are the demons and evil spirits,
already as many as the sands of the sea, to whose number more must
not be added.</p>

<p>Among the worst of demons are the spirits of women who died in
childbirth before the child was born. These walk with their feet
turned backward, haunting lonely roads and the family hearth, and
are malicious beyond the rest.</p>

<p>Therefore, when a woman is seen to be about to breathe her last,
her child yet undelivered--she may have lain for days in labor for
a birth against which her starveling bones are locked--the
<i>dhai,</i> as in duty bound, sets to work upon precautions for
the protection of the family.</p>

<p>First she brings pepper and rubs it into the dying eyes, that
the soul may be blinded and unable to find its way out. Then she
takes two long iron nails, and, stretching out her victim's
unresisting arms--for the poor creature knows and accepts her
fate--drives a spike straight through each palm fast into the
floor. This is done to pinion the soul to the ground, to delay its
passing or that it may not rise and wander, vexing the living. And
so the woman dies, piteously calling to the gods for pardon for
those black sins of a former life for which she now is
suffering.</p>

<p>This statement, horrible as it is, rests upon the testimony of
many and unimpeachable medical witnesses in widely separated parts
of India. All the main statements in this chapter rest upon such
testimony and upon my own observation.</p>

<p>It would be unjust to assume, however, that the <i>dhai,</i> for
all her monstrous deeds, is a blameworthy creature. Every move that
she makes is a part of the ancient and accepted ritual of her
calling. Did she omit or change any part of it, nothing would be
gained; simply the elder women of the households she serves would
revile her for incapacity and call in another more faithful to the
creed.</p>

<p>Her services include attendance at the time of confinement and
for ten days, more or less, thereafter, the approximate interval
during which no member of the family will approach the patient
because of her un-cleanness. During this time the <i>dhai</i> does
all that is done for the sick woman and the infant. At its end she
is expected to clean the defiled room and coat with cow-dung its
floor and walls.</p>

<p>She receives her pay in accordance with the sex of the child
that was born. These sums vary. A rich man may give her for the
entire period of service as much as Rs. 15 (about $5.00) if the
child be a son. From the well-to-do the more usual fee is about R.
I ($.33) for a son and eight annas ($.16) for a daughter. The poor
pay the <i>dhai</i> for her fortnight's work the equivalent of four
or five cents for a son and two to three cents for a daughter.
Herself the poorest of the poor, she has no means of her own
wherewith to buy as much as a cake of soap or a bit of clean
cotton. None are anywhere provided for her. And so, the slaughter
goes on.[18]</p>

<blockquote>[18. <i>VMS.F. Report,</i> p. 89.]</blockquote>

<p>Various funds subscribed by British charity sustain maternal and
child-welfare works in many parts of India, whose devoted British
doctors and nurses attempt to teach the <i>dhais.</i> But the task
is extremely difficult. Invariably the <i>dhais</i> protest that
they have nothing to learn, in which their clients agree with them.
One medical woman said in showing me her <i>dhai</i> class, an
appalling array of decrepit old crones:</p>

<p>"We pay these women, out of a fund from England, for coming to
class. We also pay some of them not to practice, a small sum, but
just enough to live on. They are too old, too stupid and too
generally miserable to be capable of learning. Yet, when we beg
them not to take cases because of the harm they do, they say: 'How
else can we live? This is our only means to earn food.' Which is
true."</p>

<p>A characteristic incident, freshly happened when it came to my
knowledge, concerned a Public Health instructor stationed, by one
of the funds above mentioned, in the north. To visualize the scene,
one must think of the instructor as what she is--a conspicuously
comely and spirited young lady of the type that under all
circumstances looks <i>chic</i> and well-groomed. She had been
training a class of <i>dhais</i> in Lahore, and had invited her
"graduates" when handling a difficult case to call her in for
advice.</p>

<p>At three o'clock one cold winter's morning of 1926, a graduate
summoned her. The summons led to the house of an outcaste, a little
mud hut with an interior perhaps eight by twelve feet square. In
the room were ten people, three generations of the family, all save
the patient fast asleep. Also, a sheep, two goats, some chickens
and a cow, because the owner did not trust his neighbors. No light
but a glim in an earthen pot. No heat but that from the bodies of
man and beast. No aperture but the door, which was closed.</p>

<p>In a small alcove at the back of the room four cot beds, planted
one upon another, all occupied by members of the family. In the cot
third from the ground lay a woman in advanced labor.</p>

<p><i>"Dhai</i> went outside," observed Grandmother, stir-ting
sleepily, and turned her face to the wall.</p>

<p>Not a moment to be lost. No time to hunt up the
<i>&agrave;hai.</i> By good luck, the cow lay snug against the
cot-pile. So our trig little English lady climbs up on the back of
the placid and unobjecting cow, and from that vantage point
successfully brings into the world a pair of tiny Hindus--a girl
and a boy.</p>

<p>Just as the thing is over, back comes the <i>dhai,</i> in a
rage. She had been out in the yard, quarreling with the husband
about the size of the coin that he should lay in her palm, on which
to cut the cord--without which coin already in her possession no
canny <i>dhai</i> will operate.</p>

<p>And this is merely an ordinary experience.</p>

<p>"Our Indian conduct of midwifery undoubtedly should be otherwise
than it is," said a group of Indian gentlemen discussing the whole
problem as it exists in their own superior circle, "but is it
possible, do you think, that enough English ladies will be found to
come out and do the work inclusively?"</p>

<p>A fractional percentage of the young wives are now found ready
to accept modern medical help. But it is from the elder women of
the household that resistance both determined and effective
comes.</p>

<p>Says Dr. Agnes C. Scott, M.B., B.S., of the Punjab, one of the
most distinguished of the many British medical women today giving
their lives to India:[19]</p>

<blockquote>[19. <i>V.M.S.F. Report,</i> p. 91. Cf. Sir Patrick
Hehir, <i>The Medical Profession in India,</i> Henry Frowde &amp;
Hodder and Stoughton, Ion-don, 1923, pp. 125-31.]</blockquote>

<p class="quote">An educated man may desire a better-trained woman
to attend on his wife, but he is helpless against the stone wall of
ignorance and prejudice built and kept up by the older women of the
<i>zenana</i> who are the real rulers of the house.</p>

<p>Dr. K. O. Vaughan says upon this point:[20]</p>

<blockquote>[20. <i>Ibid.,</i> p. 101.]</blockquote>

<p class="quote">The women are their own greatest enemies, and if
any one can devise a system of education and enlightenment for
grandmother, great-grandmother and great-great-grandmother which
will persuade them not to employ the ignorant, dirty Bazaar
<i>dhai,</i> they will deserve well of the Indian nation. In my
opinion that is an impossible task.</p>

<p>And another woman surgeon adds:[21]</p>

<blockquote>[21. <i>Ibid,,</i> p. 71.]</blockquote>

<p class="quote">Usually a mother-in-law or some ancient dame
superintends the confinement, who is herself used to the old
traditions and insists on their observance...It has been the
immemorial custom that the management of a confinement is the
province of the leading woman of the house, and the men are
powerless to interfere.</p>

<p>Thus arises a curious picture--the picture of the man who has
since time immemorial enslaved his wife, and whose most vital need
in all life, present and to come, is the getting of a son; and of
this man, by means none other than the will of his willing slave,
balked in his heart's desire! He has thought it good that she be
kept ignorant; that she forever suppress her natural spirit and
inclinations, walking ceremonially, in stiff harness, before him,
her "earthly god." She has so walked, obedient from infancy to
death, through untold centuries of merciless discipline, while he,
from infancy to death, through untold centuries, has given himself
no discipline at all. And now their harvests ripen in kind: hers a
death-grip on the rock of the old law, making her dead-weight
negative to any change, however merciful; his, a weakness of will
and purpose, a fatigue of nerve and spirit, that deliver him in his
own house, beaten, into the hands of his slave.</p>

<p>Of Indian babies born alive about 2,000,000 die each year.
"Available statistics show," says the latest Census of India, "that
over forty per cent, of the deaths of infants occur in the first
week after birth, and over sixty per cent, in the first
month."[22]</p>

<blockquote>[22. <i>Census of India,</i> 1921, Vol. I, Part I, p.
133.]</blockquote>

<p>The number of still births is heavy. Syphilis and gonorrhea are
among its main causes, to which must be added the sheer inability
of the child to bear the strain of coming into the world.</p>

<p>Vital statistics are weak in India, for they must largely depend
upon illiterate villagers as collectors.</p>

<p>If a baby dies, the mother's wail trails down the darkness of a
night or two. But if the village be near a river, the little body
may just be tossed into the stream, without waste of a rag for a
shroud. Kitea and the turtles finish its brief history. And it is
more than probable that no one in the village will think it worth
while to report either the birth or the death. Statistics as to
babies must therefore be taken as at best approximate.</p>

<p>It is probable, however, in view of existing conditions, that
the actual figures of infant mortality, were it possible to know
them, would surprise the western mind rather by their smallness
than by their height. "I used to think," said one of the American
medical women, "that a baby was a delicate creature. But experience
here is forcing, me to believe it the toughest fabric ever made,
since it ever survives." <a name="ch-9" id="ch-9"></a></p>

<hr align="center" width="25%">

<h2>CHAPTER IX - BEHIND THE VEIL</h2>

<p>The chapters preceding have chiefly dealt with the Hindu, who
forms, roughly, three-quarters of the population of India. The
remaining quarter, the Mu-hammadans, differ considerably as between
the northern element, whose blood contains a substantial strain of
the old conquering Persian and Afghan stock, and the southern
contingent, who are, for the larger part, descendants of Hindu
converts retaining in greater or less degree many of the qualities
of Hindu character.</p>

<p>In some respects, Muhammadan women enjoy great advantages over
their Hindu sisters. Conspicuous among such advantages is their
freedom from infant marriage and from enforced widowhood, with the
train of miseries evoked by each. Their consequent better
inheritance, supported by a diet greatly superior to that of the
Hindu, brings them to the threshold of a maturity sturdier than,
that of the Hindu type. Upon crossing that threshold the advantage
of Muhammadan women of the better class is, however, forfeit. For
they pass into practical life-imprisonment within the four walls of
the home.</p>

<p><i>Purdah,</i> as this system of women's seclusion is called,
having been introduced by the Muslim conquerors and by them
observed, soon came to be regarded by higher caste Hindus as a
hall-mark of social prestige. These, therefore, adopted it as a
matter of mode. And today, as a consequence of the growing
prosperity of the country, this mediaeval custom, like the
interdiction of remarriage of virgin widows among the Hindus, seems
to be actually on the increase. For every woman at the top of the
scale whom western influence sets free, several humbler but
prospering sisters, socially ambitious, deliberately assume the
bonds.</p>

<p>That view of women which makes them the proper loot of war was
probably the origin of the custom of <i>purdah.</i> When a man has
his women shut up within his own four walls, he can guard the door.
Taking Indian evidence on the question, it appears that in some
degree the same necessity exists today. In a part of India where
<i>purdah</i> but little obtains, I observed the united request of
several Hindu ladies of high position that the Amusement Club for
English and Indian ladies to which they belong reduce the minimum
age required for membership to twelve or, better, to eleven years.
This, they frankly said, was because they were afraid to leave
their daughters of that age at home, even for one afternoon,
without a mother's eye and accessible to the men of the family.</p>

<p>Far down the social scale the same anxiety is found. The Hindu
peasant villager's wife will not leave her girl child at home alone
for the space of an hour, being practically sure that, if she does
so, the child will be ruined. I dare not affirm that this condition
everywhere obtains. But I can affirm that it was brought to my
attention by Indians and by Occidentals, as regulating daily life
in widely separated sections of the country.</p>

<p>No typical Muhammadan will trust another man in his
<i>zenana,</i> simply because he knows that such liberty would be
regarded as opportunity. If there be a handful of Hindus of another
persuasion, it is almost or quite invariably because they are
reflecting some part of the western attitude toward women; and this
they do without abatement of their distrust of their fellow-men.
Intercourse between men and women which is both free and innocent
is a thing well-nigh incredible to the Indian mind.</p>

<p>In many parts of India the precincts of the <i>zenana,</i> among
better-class Hindus, are therefore closed and the women cloistered
within. And the cloistered Muhammadan women, if they emerge from
their seclusion, do so under concealing veils, or in concealing
vehicles. The Rolls-Royce of a Hindu reigning prince's wife may
sometimes possess dark window-glasses, through which the lady looks
out at ease, herself unseen. But the wife of a prosperous
Muhammadan cook, if she go out on an errand, will cover herself
from the crown of the head downward in a thick cotton shroud,
through whose scant three inches of mesh-covered eye-space she
peers half-blinded.</p>

<p>I happened to be present at a <i>"purdah</i> party"--a party for
veiled ladies, attended by ladies only--in a private house in Delhi
when tragedy hovered nigh. The Indian ladies had all arrived,
stepping heavily swathed from their close-curtained motor cars.
Their hostess, wife of a high English official, herself had met
them on her threshold; for, out of deference to the custom of the
<i>purdah,</i> all the men servants had been banished from the
house, leaving Lady ------ alone to conduct her guests to the
dressing room. There they had laid aside their swathings. And now,
in all the grace of their native costumes, they were sitting about
the room, gently conversing with the English ladies invited to meet
them. The senior Indian lady easily dominated her party. She was
far advanced in years, they said, and she wore long, light blue
velvet trousers, tight from the knee down, golden slippers, a smart
little jacket of silk brocade and a beautifully embroidered Kashmir
shawl draped over her head.</p>

<p>We went in to tea. And again Lady ------, single-handed, except
for the help of the English ladies, moved back and forth, from
pantry to tea-table, serving her Indian guests.</p>

<p>Suddenly, from the veranda without, arose a sound of
incursion--a rushing--men's voices, women's voices, loud, louder,
coming close. The hostess with a face of dismay dashed for the
door. Within the room panic prevailed. Their great white mantles
being out of reach, the Indian ladies ran into the corners, turning
their backs, while the English, understanding their plight, stood
before them to screen them as best might be.</p>

<p>Meantime, out on the veranda, more fracas had arisen--then a
sudden silence and a whir of retreating wheels. Lady ------
returned, panting, all apologies and relief.</p>

<p>"I am <i>too</i> sorry! But it is all over now. Do forgive it!
Nothing shall frighten you again," she said to the trembling Indian
ladies; and, to the rest of us: "It was the young Roosevelts come
to call. They didn't know!"</p>

<p>It was in the talk immediately following that one of the
youngest of the Indian ladies exclaimed:</p>

<p>"You find it difficult to like our <i>purdah.</i> But we have
known nothing else. We lead a quiet, peaceful, protected life
within our own homes. And, with men as they are, we should be
miserable, terrified, outside."</p>

<p>But one of the ladies of middle age expressed another mind: "I
have been with my husband to England," she said, speaking quietly
to escape the others' ears. "While we were there he let me leave
off <i>purdah,</i> for women are respected in England. So I went
about freely, in streets and shops and galleries and gardens and to
the houses of friends, quite comfortable always. No one frightened
or disturbed me and I had much interesting talk with gentlemen as
well as ladies. Oh, it was wonderful--a paradise! But here--here
there is nothing. I must stay within the <i>zenana,</i> keeping
strict <i>purdah,</i> as becomes our rank, seeing no one but the
women, and my husband. We see nothing. We know nothing. We have
nothing to say to each other. We quarrel. It is <i>dull.</i> But
they," nodding surreptitiously toward the oldest woman, "will have
it so. It is only because of our hostess that such as she would
come here today. More they would never consent to. And they know
how to make life horrible for us in each household, if we offer to
relax an atom of the <i>purdah</i> law."</p>

<p>Then, looking from face to face, one saw the illustration of the
talk--the pretty, blank features of the novices; the unutterable
listlessness and fatigue of those of the speaker's age; the
sharp-eyed, iron-lipped authority of the old.</p>

<p>The report of the Calcutta University Commission says:[1]</p>

<blockquote>[1. VoL II, Part I, pp. 4-5.]</blockquote>

<p class="quote">All orthodox Bengali women of the higher classes,
whether Hindu or Muslim, pass at an early age behind the
<i>purdah,</i> and spend the rest of their lives in the complete
seclusion of their homes, and under the control of the eldest woman
of the household. This seclusion is more strict among the
Musal-mans than among the Hindus...A few westernised women have
emancipated themselves,...[but] they are regarded by most of their
countrywomen as denationalised.</p>

<p>Bombay, however, practices but little <i>purdah,</i> largely, no
doubt, because of the advanced status and liberalizing influence of
the Parsi ladies; and in the Province of Madras it is as a rule
peculiar only to the Muhammadans and the wealthy Hindus. From two
Hindu gentlemen, both trained in England to a scientific
profession, I heard that they themselves had insisted that their
wives quit <i>purdah,</i> and that they were bringing up their
little daughters in a European school. But their wives, they added,
unhappy in what seemed to them too great exposure, would be only
too glad to resume their former sheltered state. And, viewing
things as they are, one can scarcely escape the conclusion that
much is to be said on that side. One frequently hears, in India and
out of it, of the beauty of the sayings of the Hindu masters on the
exalted position of women. One finds often quoted such passages as
the precept of Manu:</p>

<p class="quote">Where a woman is not honoured Vain is sacrificial
rite.</p>

<p>But, as Mr. Gandhi tersely sums it up: "What is the teaching
worth, if their practice denies it?"[2]</p>

<blockquote>[2. Statement to the author, Sabarmati, Ahmedabad,
March 17, 1926.]</blockquote>

<p>One consequence of <i>purdah</i> seclusion is its incubation of
tuberculosis. Dr. Arthur Lankester[3] has shown that among the
<i>purdah-keeplng</i> classes the mortality of women from
tuberculosis is terribly high. It is also shown that, among persons
living in the same locality and of the same habits and means, the
men of the <i>purdah-keeping</i> classes display a higher incidence
of death from tuberculosis than do those whose women are less shut
in.</p>

<blockquote>[3. <i>Tuberculosis in India,</i> Arthur Lankester,
M.D., Butterworth &amp; Co., London, 1920, p. 140.]</blockquote>

<p>The Health Officer for Calcutta declares in his report for
1917:</p>

<p class="quote">In spite of the improvement in the general
death-rate of the city, the death-rate amongst females is still
more than 40 per cent, higher than amongst males...Until it is
realised that the strict observance of the <i>purdah</i> system in
a large city, except in the case of the very wealthy who can afford
spacious homes standing in their own grounds, necessarily involves
the premature death of a large number of women, this standing
reproach to the city will never be removed.</p>

<p>Dr. Andrew Balfour, Director of the London School of Hygiene and
Tropical Medicine, in pointing out how perfectly the habits of the
Indian peoples favor the spread of the disease, speaks of "the
system by which big families live together; the <i>purdah</i>
custom relegating women to the dark and dingy parts of the house;
the early marriages, sapping the vitality of thousands of the
young; the pernicious habit of indiscriminate spitting."[4] These,
added to dirt, bad sanitation, confinement, lack of air and
exercise, make a perfect breeding-place for the White Death.
Between nine hundred thousand and one million persons, it is
estimated, die annually of tuberculosis in India.[5]</p>

Balf our and Dr. H. H. Scott, Collins, London, 1924, p.

<blockquote>[5. <i>Ibid.,</i> p. 285.]</blockquote>

<p>It has been further estimated that forty million Indian women,
Muhammadan and Hindu, are today in <i>purdah.</i>[6] In the
opinion, however, of those experienced officers whom I could
consult, this estimate, if it is intended to represent the number
of women kept so strictly cloistered that they never leave their
apartments nor see any male save husband and son, is probably three
times too high. Those who never see the outer world, from their
marriage day till the day of their death, number by careful
estimate of minimum and maximum between 11,250,000 and 17,290,000
persons.</p>

<blockquote>[6. <i>India and Missions,</i> The Bishop of
Dornakal.]</blockquote>

<p>As to the mental effect of the <i>purdah</i> system upon those
who live under it, one may leave its characterization to Indian
authorities.</p>

<p>Says Dr. N. N. Parakh, the Indian physician:[7]</p>

<blockquote>[7. <i>Legislative Assembly Debates,</i> Vol. Ill, Part
I, p. 881.]</blockquote>

<p class="quote">Ignorance and the <i>purdah</i> system have
brought the women of India to the level of animals. They are unable
to look after themselves, nor have they any will of their own. They
are slaves to their masculine owners.[8]</p>

<blockquote>[8. Cf., however, <i>ante,</i> pp. 77, 80, 109, 116,
etc.]</blockquote>

<p>Said that outstanding Swarajist leader, Lala Lajpat Rai, in his
Presidential address to the Hindu Maha-sabha Conference held in
Bombay in December, 1925:</p>

<p class="quote">The great feature of present-day Hindu life is
passivity. "Let it be so" sums up all their psychology, individual
and social. They have got into the habit of taking things lying
down. They have imbibed this tendency and this psychology and this
habit from their mothers. It seems as if it was in their
blood...Our women labour under many handicaps. It is not only
ignorance and superstition that corrode their intelligence, but
even physically they are a poor race...Women get very little open
air and almost no exercise. How on earth is the race, then, to
improve and become efficient? A large number of our women develop
consumption and die at an early age. Such of them as are mothers,
infect their children also. Segregation of cases affected by
tuberculosis is almost impossible...There is nothing so hateful as
a quarrelsome, unnecessarily assertive, impudent, ill-mannered
woman, but even if that were the only road which the Hindu woman
must traverse in order to be an efficient, courageous, independent
and physically fit mother, I would prefer it to the existing state
of things.</p>

<p>At this point, the practical experience of a schoolmistress, the
English principal of a Calcutta girls' col-lege, may be cited.
Dated eight years later than the Report of the Calcutta Health
Officer already quoted, it concerns the daughters of the most
progressive and liberal of Bengal's families.[9]</p>

<blockquote>[9. Sister Mary Victoria, Principal of the Diocesan
College for Girls, <i>Fifth Quinquennial Review of the Progress of
Education in Bengal,</i> paragraphs 521-4.]</blockquote>

<p class="quote">They dislike exercise, and take it only under
compulsion. They will not go into the fresh air if they can avoid
doing so. The average student is very weak. She needs good food,
exercise, and often remedial gymnastics. The chest is contracted,
and the spine often curved. She has no desire for games...We want
the authority...to compel the student to take those remedies which
will help her to grow into a woman.</p>

<p>But the introduction of physical training as a help to the
bankrupt physiques of Hindu girls is thus far only a dream of the
occidental intruder. Old orthodoxy will not have it so.</p>

<p class="quote">The Hindu father is prone to complain that he does
not want his daughter turned into a <i>nautch</i> girl. She has to
be married into one of a limited number of families; and there is
always a chance of one of the old ladies exclaiming, "This girl has
been taught to kick her legs about in public. Surely such a
shameless one is not to be brought into our house!"[10]</p>

<blockquote>[10. The Inspectress for Eastern Bengal, <i>Calcutta
University Commission Report,</i> Vol. II, Part I, p.
23.]</blockquote>

<p>"It is, indeed, only among the orthodox," says the authority
quoting this testimony, "that this kind of objection is taken. But
the orthodox are the majority."[11]</p>

<blockquote>[11. <i>Ibid.,</i> p. 24.]</blockquote>

<p>Under the caption, "Thou Shalt Do No Murder," the Oxford Mission
of Calcutta printed, in its weekly journal of February 20, 1926, an
editorial beginning as follows:</p>

<p class="quote">A few years ago we published an article with the
above heading in which was vividly described by a woman writer the
appalling destruction of life and health which was going on in
Bengal behind the <i>purdah</i> and in <i>zenanas</i> amongst the
women herded there. We thought that the revelations then made,
based on the health officer's reports, would bring to us a stream
of indignant letters demanding instant reform. The effect amongst
men folk was entirely <i>nil.</i> Apparently not a spark of
interest was roused. An article condemning the silly credulity of
the use of charms and talismans at once evokes criticism, and the
absurdities of superstition are vigorously defended even by men who
are graduates. But not a voice was raised in horror at the fact
that for every male who dies of tuberculosis in Calcutta five
females die.</p>

<p>Yet among young western-educated men a certain abstract
uneasiness begins to appear concerning things as they are. After
they have driven the Occident out of India, many of them say, they
must surely take up this matter of women. Not often, however, does
one find impatience such as that of Abani Mohan Das Gupta, of
Calcutta, expressed in the journal just quoted.</p>

<p class="quote">I shudder to think about the condition of our
mothers and tisters in the "harem."...From early morn till late at
night they are working out the same routine throughout the Whole of
their lives without a murmur, as if they are patience incarnate.
There are many instances where a woman has entered the house of her
husband at the time of the marriage and did not leave it until
death had carried her away. They are always in harness as if they
have no will or woe but only to suffer--suffer without any
protest...I appeal to young Indians to unfurl their flag for the
freedom of women. Allow them their right...Am I crying in the
wilderness?</p>

<p>Bengal is the seat of bitterest political unrest--the producer
of India's main crop of anarchists, bomb-throwers and assassins.
Bengal is also among the most sexually exaggerated regions of
India; and medical and police authorities in any country observe
the link between that quality and "queer" criminal minds--the
exhaustion of normal avenues of excitement creating a thirst and a
search in the abnormal for gratification. But Bengal is also the
stronghold of strict <i>purdah,</i> and one cannot but speculate as
to how many explosions of eccentric crime in which the young
politicals of Bengal have indulged were given the detonating touch
by the unspeakable flatness of their <i>purdah</i>-deadened home
lives, made the more irksome by their own half-digested dose of
foreign doctrines. <a name="ch-10" id="ch-10"></a></p>

<h2>CHAPTER X - WOMAN THE SPINSTER</h2>

<p>Less than 2 per cent, of the women of British India are literate
in the sense of being able to write a letter of a few simple
phrases, and read its answer, in any one language or dialect. To be
exact, such literates numbered, in 1921, eighteen to the
thousand.[1] But in the year 1911 they numbered only ten to the
thousand. And, in order to estimate the significance of that
increase, two points should be considered: first, that a century
ago literate women, save for a few rare stars, were practically
unknown in India; and, second, that the great body of the peoples,
always heavily opposed to female education, still so opposes it,
and on religio-social grounds.</p>

<blockquote>[1. <i>India in 1914-25,</i> L. F. Rushbrook Williams,
C.B.E., p. 276.]</blockquote>

<p>Writing in the beginning of the nineteenth century, the
Abb&eacute; Dubois said:[2]</p>

<blockquote>[2. <i>Hindu Manners, Customs and Ceremonies,</i> pp.
336-7.]</blockquote>

<p class="quote">The social condition of the wives of the Brahmins
differs very little from that of the women of other castes...They
are considered incapable of developing any of those higher mental
qualities which would make them more worthy of consideration and
also more capable of playing a usefuf part in life...As a natural
consequence of these views, female education is altogether
neglected. A young girl's mind remains totally uncultivated, though
many of them have good abilities...It would be thought a disgrace
to a respectable woman to learn to read; and even if she had learnt
she would be ashamed to own it.</p>

<p>This was written of the Hindu. But Islam in India has also
disapproved of the education of women, which, therefore, has been
held by the vast majority of both creeds to be unnecessary,
unorthodox, and dangerous.</p>

<p>In the year 1917, the Governor-General of India in Council
appointed a commission to inquire and recommend as to the status of
the University of Calcutta and of tributary educational conditions
in Bengal. This commission comprised eminent British educators from
the faculties of the Universities of Leeds, Glasgow, Manchester,
and London, allied with eminent Indian professionals. Bengal, the
field of inquiry, has long stood distinguished among all other
provinces of British India for its thirst for learning. The
testimonies accumulated by the Commission during its three years'
work may consequently be taken as not unkindly reflecting the wider
Indian horizon.</p>

<p>With regard to the education of women, it is therefore of
interest to find Mr. Brajalal Chakravarti, Secretary of the Hindu
Academy at Daulatpur, affirming:[3]</p>

<blockquote>[3. <i>Calcutta University Commission Report,</i> Vol.
XII, p. 414.]</blockquote>

<p class="quote">It is strictly enjoined in the religious books of
the Hindus that females should not be allowed to come under any
influence outside that of the family. For this reason, no system of
school and college education can be made to suit their
require-ments...Women get sufficient moral and practical training
in the household and that is far more important than the type of
education schools can give.</p>

<p>Another of the Commission's witnesses, Mr. Hari-das Goswamy,
Head Master of the High School at Asansol, amplified the thought,
saying:[4]</p>

<blockquote>[4. <i>Ibid.,</i> p. 426.]</blockquote>

<p class="quote">It is not wise to implant in [girls] by means of
education tastes which they would not have an opportunity to
gratify in their after life, and thus sow the seeds of future
discontent and discord.</p>

<p>And Mr. Rabindra Mohan Dutta,[5] member of the faculty of the
University itself, even while deploring that "darkness of ignorance
and superstition" which, he asserts, puts the women of India "in
continual conflict and disagreement with their educated husbands,
brothers or sons," would yet follow the orthodox multitude,
genuinely fearful of importing into the Indian home, from the
distaff side,</p>

<p class="quote">the spirit of revolutionary and rationalistic
iconoclasm condemning all our ancient institutions that are the
outcome of a long past and are part of our flesh and blood as it
were.</p>

<blockquote>[5. <i>Ibid.,</i> p. 422.]</blockquote>

<p>When, however, the topic of women's education comes up for
discussion in Indian political bodies, speakers arise on the side
of change. In the Delhi Legislative Assembly, Dr. Hari Singh Gour
[6] denounces the sequestration and suppression of women. And
Munshi Iswar Saran, [7] member for the cities of the United
Provinces, points out, in a spirit of ridicule, that it is</p>

<blockquote>[6. <i>Legislative Assembly Debates,</i> 1921, Vol. I,
Part I, p. 363.]</blockquote>

<blockquote>[7. <i>Ibid.,</i> 1922, Vol. II, Part II, p.
1631.]</blockquote>

<p class="quote">...the sin of this <i>Kali Yuga</i> [Age of
Destruction] that youngsters receive education and then decline to
be ordered about by their elders...Such is our foolhardiness that
we have started giving education to our girls...If this is going
on, I ask whether you believe that you will be able <b>to</b>
dictate to your daughters?</p>

<p>I recall the heat with which a wealthy young Hindu of my
acquaintance, but just returned from an English university,
asserted that he would never, never take an Indian bride, because
he would not tie himself to "a wife of the tenth century." And
among western-educated Indians in the higher walks of life, the
desire for similarly educated wives sometimes rises even to a
willingness to accept such brides with dowries smaller than would
otherwise be exacted.</p>

<p>But this factor, though recognizable, is as yet small. Bombay,
perhaps, gives its women more latitude than does any other
province. Yet its Education Report asserts:[8]</p>

<blockquote>[8. Quoted in <i>Progress of Education in India,</i>
1917-22, Eighth Quinquennial Review, pp. 129-30.]</blockquote>

<p class="quote">Educated men desire educated wives for their sons
and presumably educate their daughters with the same object in
view, but they generally withdraw them from school on any
manifestation of a desire to...push education to any length which
might interfere with or delay marriage.</p>

<p>The Report of the Central Provinces affirms:[*]</p>

<blockquote>[*. <i>Ibid.</i>]</blockquote>

<p class="quote">Even those parents who are not averse to their
daughters' being literate consider that the primary course is
sufficient, and that after its completion girls are too old to be
away from their homes.</p>

<p>And Assam adds:[*]</p>

<blockquote>[*. <i>Ibid.</i>]</blockquote>

<p class="quote">[Parents] send their girls to school in order to
enable themselves to marry them better and occasionally on easier
terms. But as soon as a suitable bridegroom is available the girl
is at once placed in the seclusion of the <i>purdah.</i></p>

<p>Certainly the great weight of sentiment remains intact in its
loyalty to ancient conditions. To disturb them were to risk the
mould of manhood. The metaphor of Dr. Brajendranath Seal, M.A.,
Ph.D., Professor of Mental and Moral Science in Calcutta
University, implies the dreaded risk: "Man," writes this Hindu
philosopher, "is a home-brew in the vat of woman the brewster, or,
as the Indian would put it, a home-spun in the loom of woman the
spinster."[9]</p>

<blockquote>[9. <i>Calcutta University Commission Report,</i> Vol.
XII, p. 62.]</blockquote>

<p>On such general grounds, says the Calcutta University
Commission,[10] is the feeling against women's education "very
commonly supported by the men, even by those who have passed
through the whole course of western education." If the child be
sent to school at all, it is more often to put her in a safe place
out of the family's way, rather than to give her instruction for
which is felt so faint a need and so great a distrust.</p>

<blockquote>[10. <i>Ibid</i>.,VoLII, Parti, p. 5.]</blockquote>

<p>To use the words of Mr. B. Mukherjee, M.A., F.R.E.S.:[11]</p>

<blockquote>[11. <i>Calcutta University Commission Report,</i> Vol.
XII, p. 440.]</blockquote>

<p class="quote">The strict social system which makes the marriage
of a girl religiously compulsory at the age of twelve or so also
puts an end to all hope of continuing the education of the ordinary
Hindu girl beyond the [marriageable] age.</p>

<p>It is estimated that over 73 per cent, of the total number of
girls at school are withdrawn before they achieve literacy, and in
the year 1922, in the great Bengal Presidency, out of every hundred
girls under instruction but one was studying above the primary
stage.[12]</p>

<blockquote>[12. <i>Progress of Education in Bengal,</i> J. W.
Holme, M.A,, Sixth Quinquennial Review.]</blockquote>

<p>Such small advance as has been achieved, in the desperately
up-hill attempt to bestow literacy upon the women of India,
represents, first and foremost, a steady and patient effort of
persuasion on the part of the British Government; second, the toil
of British and American missionaries; and, third, the ability of
the most progressive Indians to conceive and effect the
transmission of thought into deed. But it is estimated that,
without a radical change in performance on the part of the Indians
themselves, ninety-five more years of such combined effort will be
required to wrest from hostility and inertia the privilege of
primary education for as much as 12 per cent, of the female
population."</p>

<p>The Seva Sadan Society, pioneer Indian women's organization to
provide poor women and girls with training in primary teaching and
useful work, was started in 1908, in Poona, near Bombay. By the
latest report at hand, it has about a thousand pupils. This
society's success shows what the happier women of India could do
for the rest, were they so minded. But its work is confined wholly
to Bombay Presidency; and unfortunately, it has no counterpart,
says the official report, in any other part of India.[13]</p>

<blockquote>[13. Cf. <i>Village Schools in India,</i> Mason Olcott,
Associated Press, Calcutta, 1926, p. 90.]</blockquote>

<p>As will be shown in another chapter, the administration of
education as a province of Government has of late years rested in
Indian hands.</p>

<p>In 1921-2, British India possessed 23,778 girls' schools,
inclusive of all grades, from primary schools to arts and
professional colleges. These schools contained in the primary stage
1,297,643 pupils, only 24,555 in the Middle Schools and a still
smaller number--5,818--in the High Schools.[14]</p>

<blockquote>[14. The figures in this paragraph are drawn from
<i>Progress of Education in India,</i> 1917-22, Vol.
II.]</blockquote>

<p>"Although," says the report, "the number of girls who proceed
beyond the primary stage is still lamentably small--30,000 in all
India out of a possible school-going population of fifteen
millions--still it shows an increase of thirty per cent, over the
attendance in 1917."[15]</p>

<blockquote>[15. <i>Progress of Education in India,</i> Vol. I, p.
135.]</blockquote>

<p>In Bombay Presidency, in 1924-5 only 2.14 per cent, of the
female population was under instruction of any kind,[16] while in
all India, in 1919, .9 per cent, of the Hindu female population,
and 1.1 per cent, of the Muhammadan females, were in
school.[17]</p>

<blockquote>[16. <i>Bombay,</i> 1924-25, Government Central Press,
Bombay, 1926, pp XV-XVI.]</blockquote>

<blockquote>[17. <i>Progress of Education in India,</i> 1917-22,
Vol. I, p.] 126.]</blockquote>

<p>"It would be perfectly easy to multiply schools in which little
girls would amuse themselves in preparatory classes, and from which
they would drift away gradually during the lower primary stage. The
statistical result would be impressive, but the educational effect
would be <i>nil</i> and public money would be indefensibly
wasted."[18]</p>

<blockquote>[18. <i>Ibid.,</i> pp. 138-9.]</blockquote>

<p>But, in the fight for conserving female illiteracy, as in those
for maintaining the ancient midwifery and for continuing the
cloistering of women, the great constant factor on the side of
Things-As-They-Were will be found in the elder women themselves.
Out of sheer loyalty to their gods of heaven and their gods of
earth they would die to keep their daughters like themselves.</p>

<p>As that blunt old Sikh farmer-soldier, Captain Hira Singh Brar,
once said, speaking from his seat in the Legislative Assembly on a
measure of reform:[19]</p>

<blockquote>[19. <i>Legislative Assembly Debates,</i> 1925, Vol. V,
Part III, p. 2830.]</blockquote>

<p class="quote">So many Lalas and Pandits get up on the platforms
and say, "Now the time has come for this .reform and that." But
what happens? When they go home and when we meet them next morning
they say, "What can we do? We are helpless. When we went back home,
our ladies would not allow us to do what we wanted to do. They say
they do not care what we talk, but they would not allow us to act
accordingly."</p>

<p>Abreast of these priestesses of ancient custom in pre-serving
the illiteracy of women, stands another mighty influence--that of
economic self-interest; a man must marry his daughter or incur an
earthly and eternal penalty that few will face. He can rarely marry
her without paying a dowry so large that it strains his resources;
to which must be added the costs of the wedding--costs so excessive
that, as a rule, they plunge him deep into debt. This heavy tax he
commonly incurs before his daughter reaches her teens. Why, then,
should he spend still more money on her, to educate her; or why, if
he be poor and can use her labor, should he go without her help and
send her to school, since she is so early to pass forever into
another man's service? The idea has been expressed by Rai Harinath
Ghosh, Bahadur,[20] fellow of Calcutta University:</p>

<blockquote>[20. <i>Calcutta University Commission Report,</i> Vol.
XII, p. <i>425.</i>]</blockquote>

<p class="quote">People naturally prefer to educate their boys,
well knowing that in future they will make them happy and
comfortable in their old age, and glorify their family, whilst the
girls, after marriage, will be at the mercy of others.</p>

<p>To the average Indian father, of whatever estate, this range of
reasoning appears conclusive. And so the momentous opportunities of
the motherhood of India continue to be intrusted to the wisdom and
judgment of illiterate babies.</p>

<p>Given such a public sentiment toward even rudimentary schooling
for girl children, the facts as to more advanced learning may be
easily surmised. Mr. Mohini Mohan Bhattacharjee, of the Calcutta
Univer sity faculty, expressed it in these words:[21]</p>

<blockquote>[21. <i>Calcutta University Commission Report,</i> Vol.
XII, p. 411.]</blockquote>

<p class="quote">The higher education of Indian women...may almost
be said to be beyond the scope of practical reform. No Hindu or
Muhammadan woman of an orthodox type has ever joined a college or
even read up to the higher classes in a school. The girls who
receive university education are either Brahmo[22] or
Christian...The time is far distant when the University will be
called upon to make arrangements for the higher education of any
large or even a decent number of girls in Bengal.</p>

<blockquote>[22. The Brahmo or Brahmo Samaj is a sect numbering
6,388 persons, as shown in the <i>Census of India</i> of 1921, p.
119.]</blockquote>

<p>By the latest available report, the women students in arts and
professional colleges, in all British India, numbered only 961. But
a more representative tone than that of Mr. Bhattacharjee's rather
deprecatory words is heard in the frank statement of Rai Satit
Chandra Sen, Bahadur:[23]</p>

<blockquote>[23. <i>Calcutta University Commission Report,</i> Vol.
XII, p 449.]</blockquote>

<p class="quote">Amongst advanced communities in the West, where
women are almost on a footing of equality with men and where every
woman cannot expect to enter upon married life, high education may
be a necessity to them. But...the western system...is not only
unsuitable, but also demoralising to the women of India...and
breaks down the ideals and instincts of Indian womanhood.</p>

<p>There remains, then, the question of education after marriage.
Under present conditions of Indian thought, this may be dismissed
with a word--"impracticable."[24] Directly she enters her husband's
home, the little wife, whatever her rank, is at once heavily
burdened with services to her husband, to her mother-in-law and to
the household gods. Child-bearing quickly overwhelms her and she
has neither strength nor leave for other activities. Further, she
must be taught by women, if taught at all, since women, only, may
have access to her. And so you come to the snake that has swallowed
his tail.</p>

<blockquote>[24. The Seva Sadan Society in Bombay has among its
pupils a certain percentage of married women of the laboring class
who come for two or three hours' instruction daily.]</blockquote>

<p>For, as we have just seen, the ban that forbids literacy to the
women of India thereby discourages the training of women teachers
who might break the ban. Those who have such training barely and
feebly suffice for the schools that already exist. <i>Zenana</i>
teaching has thus far languished, an anaemic exotic--a failure, in
an undesiring soil.</p>

<p>Returning to the conviction of the uselessness of spending good
money on a daughter's education, this should not be supposed a
class matter. Nobles and rich men share the sentiment with their
lesser compatriots.</p>

<p>The point is illustrated in Queen Mary's College in Lahore. This
institution was founded years ago by two English ladies who saw
that the fractional percentage of Indian girls then receiving
education came chiefly if not wholly from the low castes, whilst
the daughters of princes, the wives and mothers of princes to come,
the future regents, perhaps, for minor sons, were left in untouched
darkness. The undertaking that the two ladies began enlisted the
approval of Government. The reigning princes, spurred on by the
visit of Queen Mary to India, subscribed a certain sum. This sum
Government tripled. Suitable buildings were erected and equipped,
and there the liberality of the princes practically ceased.</p>

<p>For, as will be found in every direction in which the trait can
be expressed, the raising of a building as a monument to his name,
be it school, hospital, or what not, interests the wealthy Indian;
but for its maintenance in service he can rarely if ever be induced
to give one penny. In this case it was necessary, in order to
combat initial indifference, to present schooling practically free.
Today, the charges have been advanced to stand approximately thus:
day scholars, junior, $1.50 per month; senior, $3.00 per month;
boarding scholars, $10 to $20 per month, inclusive of all tuition,
board, laundry, and ordinary medical treatment.</p>

<p>These terms contemplate payment only for the time actually spent
at college. And still some of the fathers are both slow and
disputatious over the settlement of accounts. "You send a bill of
two rupees [$.66] for stationery, all used up in your school by my
two daughters in only two months. I consider this bill excessive.
They should not be allowed to use so much costly material; it is
not right. It should not be paid," protests one personage; and the
representative of another conducts a three weeks' correspondence of
inquiry, remonstrance, and reproach over a charge for two yards of
ribbon to tie up a little girl's bonnie black locks.</p>

<p>Partly because of the original policy of nominal charges adopted
by Government to secure an entering wedge, partly because of their
traditional dissociation of women and letters, the rich men of
India as a whole remain today still convinced at heart that, if
indeed their daughters are to be schooled at all, then Government
should give them schooling free of charge.</p>

<p>Queen Mary's College, a charming place, with classrooms,
dormitories, common rooms and gardens suitably and attractively
designed, is staffed by British ladies of university training. The
curriculum is planned to suit the needs of the students.
Instruction is given in the several languages of the
pupils--Arabic, Urdu, Hindi, etc., and, against the girls' pleas,
native dress is firmly required--lest the elders at home take
fright of a contagion of western ideas. Throughout the school's
varied activities, the continuous effort is to teach cleanliness of
habit; and marks are given not only on scholarship but on
helpfulness, tidiness, truthfulness, and the sporting spirit.</p>

<p>Outdoor games in the gardens are encouraged to the utmost
possible degree, and a prettier sight would be hard to find than a
score or so of these really lovely little gazelle-eyed maidens
playing about in their floating gauzes of blue and rose and every
rainbow hue.</p>

<p>"They have not ginger enough for good tennis," one of the
teachers admits, "but then, they have just emerged from the hands
of grandmothers who think it improper for little girls even to walk
fast. Do you see that lively small thing in pink and gold? When she
first came, two terms ago, she truly maintained that her 'legs
wouldn't run.' Now she is one of the best at games.</p>

<p>"But what a pity it is," the teacher continues, "to think of the
life of dead passivity to which, in a year or two at best, they
will all have relapsed!"</p>

<p>"Will they carry into that after-life much of what they have
learned here?" I ask.</p>

<p>"Think of the huge pervading influence that will encompass them!
The old palace <i>zenana,</i> crowded with women bowed under
traditions as fixed as death itself! Where would these delicate
children find strength to hold their own alone, through year upon
year of that ancient, changeless, smothering domination? Our best
hope is that they may, somehow, transmit a little of tonic thought
to their children; that they may send their daughters to us; and
that so, each generation adding its bit, the end may justify our
work."</p>

<p>Queen Mary's is the only school in all India instituted
especially for ladies of rank. Not unnaturally, therefore, some of
the new Indian officials, themselves without rank other than that
which office gives, covet the social prestige of enrolling their
daughters in Queen Mary's. The question of enrollment rests as yet
with an English Commissioner, and the Commissioner lets the young
climbers in. With the result that the princes, displeased, are
sending fewer of their children than of yore.</p>

<p>"Shall our daughters be subjected to the presence of daughters
of <i>babus--</i>of upstart Bengali politicians!" they exclaim,
leaving no doubt as to the reply.</p>

<p>And some of the resident faculty, mindful of the original
purpose of the school, anxiously question:</p>

<p>"Is it wise to drive away the young princesses? Their future
influence is potentially so much further-reaching than that of
other women, however intelligent. Should we not strain all points
to get and to hold them?"</p>

<p>But to this question, when asked direct, the Commissioner
himself replied:</p>

<p>"In British India we are trying to build a democracy. As for the
Native States, undoubtedly it would be well to educate the future
<i>Maharanis; 1</i> say to their fathers, the Princes: 'If you want
to keep for your daughters a school for their own rank, it can
easily be done--but not on Government funds. You must pay for the
school yourselves.' But this, invisible as the cost would be to men
of their fortunes, they are not apt to do."</p>

<p>Another center of interest in Lahore is the Victoria School,
occupying the palace of a grandson of the famous Ranjit Singh, in
the heart of the old city, just off the bazaar. The head of this
institution is an extremely able Indian lady, Miss K. M. Bose, of
the third generation of an Indian Christian family. Miss Bose's
firm and powerful character, her liberal and genial spirit, her
strong influence and fine mind, indicate the possibilities of
Indian womanhood set free.</p>

<p>In Victoria School are five hundred girl pupils. "Some are rich,
some poor," says Miss Bose, "but all are of good caste, and all are
daughters of the leading men of the city. If we took lower caste
children here, it would increase expense to an impossible degree.
The others would neither sit nor eat with them. Separate classes
would have to be maintained, an almost double teaching staff
employed, and so on through innumerable embarrassments.</p>

<p>"'The tuition fees?' Merely nominal; we Indians will not pay for
the education of our daughters. In days but just gone by, the
richest refused to pay even for lesson books. Books, teaching, and
all, had at first to be given free, or we should have got no
pupils. This school is maintained by Government grant and by
private subscriptions from England."</p>

<p>Many rooms on many floors honeycomb the old barren rabbit-warren
of a palace, each chamber filled with children, from mites of four
or five in Montessori classes up to big, hearty Muhammadan girls of
fifteen or sixteen, not yet given in marriage. Like Queen Mary's,
this is a strict <i>purdah</i> school. The eye of man may not gaze
upon it. When it is necessary to introduce some learned pundit to
teach his pundit's specialty, he is separated from th&eacute; class
he teaches by a long, deep, thick, and wholly competent curtain.
And he is chosen, not only for learning, but also for tottering
age.</p>

<p>"I am responsible for these schools," says the Commissioner,
smiling ruefully, "and yet, being a man, I may never inspect
them!"</p>

<p>Work, in Victoria School, is done in six languages--Urdu,
Persian, Hindi, Punjabi, and Sanskrit, with optional English.</p>

<p>"We give no books to the children until they can really read,"
says Miss Bose. "Otherwise they merely memorize, learning
nothing."[25] And the whole aim and hope of the scheme is to
implant in the girls' minds something so definitely applicable to
their future life in the <i>zenana</i> that some part of it may
endure alive through the years of dark and narrow things so soon to
come.</p>

<blockquote>[25. The Muslim Indian boy may be letter-perfect in
long sections of the Arabic Koran without understanding one word
that he speaks; similarly the young Hindu, so both English and
Indian teachers testify, easily learns by rote whole chapters of
text whose words are mere meaningless sounds to his
mind.]</blockquote>

<p>Reading, writing, arithmetic enough to keep simple household
accounts; a little history; sewing--which art, by the way, is
almost unknown to most of the women of India; a little drawing and
music; habits of cleanliness and sanitary observance--both subjects
of incredible difficulty; first aid, to save themselves and their
future babies as far as mayties of the domestic code--these are the
main studies in this practical institution. Added to them is simple
cooking, especially cooking for infants and invalids, using always
the native type of stove and utensils; and the handling and serving
of food, with particular emphasis on keeping it clean and off the
floor.</p>

<p>"Their cooking, in later life, they would never by nature do
with their own hands, but would leave entirely to filthy servants,
whence come much sickness and death," says the instructress. "Our
effort here is to give them a conviction of the use and beauty of
cleanliness and order in all things."</p>

<p>Miss L. Sorabji, the Indian lady-principal of the Eden High
School for girls at Dacca, thus discreetly suggests the nature of
the teacher's struggle:[26]</p>

<blockquote>[26. <i>Calcutta University Commission Report,</i> Vol.
XII, p. 453.]</blockquote>

<p class="quote">Undesirable home influences are a great hindrance
to progress. Unpunctuality, sloth, untidiness, carelessness
regarding the laws of health and sanitation, untruthfulness,
irresponsibility, absence of any code of honour, lack of home

our schools. Character-building is what is most needed.</p>

<h1>PART III</h1>

<h2>INTERLUDE - THE BRAHMAN</h2>

<p>Rattling south by rail, out of Bengal into Madras. Square masses
of elephant-colored rock piled up to build rectangular hills,
sitting one upon another in segments, like Elephant Gods on
pedestals.--Miles and more miles of it.</p>

<p>On and on. Then a softer country, where the earth is orange and
the only trees are small-topped palms scratched long across the sky
like penstrokes ending in a splutter.</p>

<p>Much cultivation, rice fields marked off in slips and fragments
by hand-high earth-ridges to hold the precious water. Little dark
people with cherry-colored garments, almost black people, with big,
bristling mops of curly black hair, drawing water out of wells as
they drew it a thousand years ago, or threshing grain under the
circling feet of bullocks. Stands of sugar cane, high and
four-square. Small clay villages, each small clay house eclipsed
under a big round palm-leaf roof like a candle-snuffer. Flocks of
orange-colored goats. Patches of orange, on the ground--palm-nuts
for betel chewing, spread out to dry. Big orange hawks with proud,
white heads. Orange afterglow of sunset, flooding orange over the
stubble fields of rice. An orange world, punctuated by black human
bodies with cherry-colored splashes.</p>

<p>Madras, citadel of Brahmanic Hinduism. Citadel also of the
remnant of the ancient folk, the dark-skinned Dravidians. Brahmanic
Hinduism broke them, cast them down and tramped upon them,
commanded them in their multi-millions to be pariahs, outcasts,
ignorant and poor. Then came the Briton, for whatever reason,
establishing peace, order, and such measure of democracy as could
survive in the soil.</p>

<p>Gradually the Dravidian raised his eyes, and then, most timidly,
his head. With him, also, the multitudes of the low castes of the
Brahman's world. And no\&lt; all these, become an Anti-Brahman
party, had developed strength enough, for the time at least, to
snatch from the Brahman his political majority in the Legislative
Council of Madras Presidency.[1] Which, in itself, constituted an
epoch in Indian history.</p>

<blockquote>[1. In the fall elections of 1926, the Brahmans
regained the majority in the Legislative Council of Madras
Presidency.]</blockquote>

<p>With one of these low-caste men become rich, respected and
politically powerful, I sat in private conference, in the city of
Madras. A little, vivacious person he was, full of heat and free of
tongue. "Will you draw me your picture of the Brahman?" 1 asked. He
answered--and these are his actual words, written down at the
moment:</p>

<p>"Once upon a time, when all men lived according to their choice,
the Brahman was the only fellow who applied himself to learning.
Then, having become learned, and being by nature subtle-minded, he
secretly laid hold upon the sacred books, and secretly wrote into
those books false texts that declared him, the Brahman, to be lord
over all the people. Ages passed. And gradually, because the
Brahman only could read and because he gave out his false texts
that forbade learning to others, the people grew to believe him the
Earthly God he called himself and to obey him accordingly. So in
all Hindu India he ruled the spirit of man, and none dared dispute
him, not till England came with schools for all.</p>

<p>"Now, here in this Province, Madras, we fight the Brahman. But
still he is very strong, because the might of thousands of years
breaks slowly, and he is as shrewd as a host of demons. He owns the
press, he sways the bench, he holds eighty per cent, of the public
offices, and he terrorizes the people, especially the women. For we
are all superstitious and mostly illiterate. The 'Earthly God' has
seen to that. Also, he hates the British, because they keep him
from strangling us. He makes much 'patriotic' outcry, demanding
that the British go. And we--we know that if they go now, before we
have had time to steady ourselves, he will strangle us again and
India will be what it used to be, a cruel despotism wielded by fat
priests against a mass of slaves, because our. imaginations are not
yet free from him. Listen:</p>

<p>"Each Hindu in India pays to the Brahman many times more than he
pays to the State. From the day of his birth to the day of his
death, a man must be feeding the Earthly God. When a child is born,
the Brahman must be paid; otherwise, the child will not prosper.
Sixteen days afterward, to be cleansed of 'birth pollution,' the
Brahman must be paid. A little later, the child must be named; and
the Brahman must be paid. In the third month, the baby's hair must
be clipped; and the Brahman must be paid. In the sixth month, we
begin to feed the child solids; and the Brahman must be paid. When
the child begins to walk, the Brahman must be paid. At the
completion of the first year comes the birthday ceremony and the
Brahman must be paid. At the end of the seventh year the boy's
education begins and the Brahman must be paid well. In well-to-do
families he performs the ceremony by guiding golden writing-sticks
placed in the boy's hand; and the sticks also go to the
Brahman.</p>

<p>"When a girl reaches her first birthday, her seventh, or her
ninth, or when a boy is one and a half, or two years old, or
anywhere up to sixteen, comes the betrothal, and big pay to the
Brahman. Then, when puberty comes, or earlier, if the marriage is
consummated earlier, rich pay to the Brahman. At an eclipse, the
Brahman must be paid heavily. And so it goes on. When a man dies,
the corpse can be removed only after receiving the blessing of the
Brahman, for which he is paid. At the cremation, again a lot of
money must be paid to many Brahmans. After cremation, every month
for a year, the dead man's son must hold a feast for Brahmans--as
great a feast as he can--and give them clothes, ornaments, food and
whatever would be dear to the dead. For whatever a Brahman eats,
drinks or uses is enjoyed by the dead. Thereafter, once a year,
during the son's life, he must repeat this observance.</p>

<p>"All such ceremonies and many more the Brahman calls his 'vested
rights,' made so by religious law. Whoever neglects them goes to
eternal damnation. During the performance of each rite we must wash
the Brahman's feet with water and then we must drink some of that
water from the palm of our hand. The Brahman is indolent, produces
nothing, and takes to no calling but that of lawyer or government
official. In this Province he numbers one and a half million and
the rest of us, over forty-one millions, feed him.</p>

<p>"Now do you understand that, until we others are able to hold
our own in India, we prefer a distant King beyond the sea, who
gives us peace, justice, something back for our money and a chance
to become free men, to a million and a half masters, here, who eat
us up, yet say our very touch would pollute them?" <a name="ch-11"
id="ch-11"></a></p>

<hr align="center" width="25%">

<h2>CHAPTER XI - LESS THAN MEN</h2>

<p>The conundrums of India have a way of answering themselves, when
one looks close.</p>

<p>Long and easily we have accepted the catchword "mysterious
India." But "mystery," as far as matters concrete are concerned,
remains such only as long as one persists in seeking a mysterious
cause for the phenomena. Look for a practical cause, as you would
do in any bread-and-butter country not labeled "inscrutable," and
your mystery vanishes in smoke.</p>

<p>"Why, after so many years of British rule, do we remain 92 per
cent, illiterate?" reiterates the Hindu politician, implying that
the blame must be laid at the ruler's door.</p>

<p>But in naming his figure, he does not call to your attention a
fact which, left to yourself, you would be slow to guess: he does
not tell you that of the 247,-000,000 inhabitants of British India,
about 25 per cent.--60,000,000--have from time immemorial been
specially condemned to illiteracy, even to sub-humanity, by their
brother Indians. Surely, if there be a mystery in India, it lies
here--it lies in the Hindu's ability anywhere, under any
circumstances, to accuse any man, any society, any nation, of "race
prejudice," so long as he can be reminded of the existence in India
of sixty million fellow Indians to whom he violently denies the
common rights of man.[1]</p>

<blockquote>[1. Indian politicians have for some time heen
directing a loud and continuous fire upon the British Home
Government for not finding means to coerce the Government of the
Union of South Africa into a complaisant attitude toward British
Indian immigrants in that country. It is worthy of note that of the
original 130,000 British Indian immigrants to South Africa,
one-third were "Untouchables," mostly from Madras Presidency, whose
condition in India is indicated in this chapter, and who would find
themselves again in such status, were they to return to Hindu
India. The British Indians in South Africa in 1922 numbered, as
shown in the official Year-Book, a little over 161,000. This figure
includes a later immigration of 10,000 traders, and the natural
increase of the combined body.]</blockquote>

<p>In the beginning, it is explained, when the light-skinned
ancestors of the present Hindus first came to India, they found
there a darker, thicker-featured native race, the Dravidians,
builders of the great temples of the South. And the priests of the
newcomers desired that the blood of their people be not mixed with
the native stock, but be kept of one strain. So they declared
Dravidians to be unclean, "untouchable."</p>

<p>Then the old lawmakers, gradually devising the caste system,
placed themselves at the head thereof, under the title of "earthly
gods"--Brahmans. Next beneath them they put the Kshattryas, or
fighting men; after the fighters, the Vaisyas, or cultivators, upon
whom the two above look down; and finally, the fourth division, or
Sudra caste, born solely to be servants to the other three. Of
these four divisions, themselves today much subdivided, was built
the frame of Hindu society. Outside and below all caste, in a limbo
of scorn earned by their sins of former existences, must forever
grovel the Untouchables.</p>

<p>A quotation from the rule by which the unfortunates were nailed
to their fate will suffice to show its nature; the
<i>Bhagavata,[2]</i> treating of the murder of a Brahman,
decrees:</p>

<blockquote>[2. Chief of the eighteen <i>Puranas,</i> sacred books
of India. The translation here given is that of the Abb&eacute;
Dubois, <i>Hindu Manners, Customs and Ceremonies,</i> p.
558.]</blockquote>

<p class="quote">Whoever is guilty of it will be condemned at his
death <b>to</b> take the form of one of those insects which feed on
filth. Being reborn long afterwards a Pariah [Untouchable], he will
belong to this caste, and will be blind for more than four times as
many years as there are hairs on the body of a cow. He can,
nevertheless, expiate his crime by feeding forty thousand
Brahmins.</p>

<p>Thus, at one sweep, is explained the Untouchable's existence as
such; are justified the indignities heaped upon him; is emphasized
his unspeakable degradation; and is safeguarded the oppressor from
the wrath of him oppressed. Even as the Hindu husband, by the
horrors imposed upon widowhood, is safeguarded from a maddened
wife's revolt.</p>

<p class="quote">If a Brahmin kills a Sudra,[3] it will suffice to
efface the sin altogether if he recites the <i>gayatri</i> [a
prayer] a hundred times, continues the scripture, by opposites
driving home its point.</p>

<p>Leaving the ancient roots of things, and coming down to the year
1926 A.D., we find the orthodox Hindu rule as to Untouchables to be
roughly this:</p>

<blockquote>[3. A member of the fourth division, lowest Hindu
caste, yet far above the Untouchable.]</blockquote>

<p>Regarded as if sub-human, the tasks held basest are reserved for
them; dishonor is associated with their name. Some are permitted to
serve only as scavengers and removers of night soil; some, through
the ignorance to which they are condemned, are loathsome in their
habits; and to all of them the privilege of any sort of teaching is
sternly denied. They may neither possess nor read the Hindu
scriptures. No Brahman priest will minister to them; and, except in
rarest instances, they may not enter a Hindu temple to worship or
pray. Their children may not come to the public schools. They may
not draw water from the public wells; and if their habitation be in
a region where water is scarce and sources far apart, this means,
for them, not greater consideration from others, but greater
suffering and greater toil.</p>

<p>They may not enter a court of justice; they may not enter a
dispensary to get help for their sick; they may stop at no inn. In
some provinces they may not even use the public road, and as
laborers or agriculturists, they are continually losers, in that
they may not enter the shops or even pass through the streets where
shops are, but must trust to a haphazard chain of hungry
go-betweens to buy or sell their meager wares. Some, in the abyss
of their degradation, are permitted no work at all. These may sell
nothing, not even their own labor. They may only beg. And even for
that purpose they dare not use the road, but must stand far off,
unseen, and cry out for alms from those who pass. If alms be given,
it must be tossed on the ground, well away from the road, and when
the giver is out of sight and the roads empty then, and not till
then, the watcher may creep up, snatch, and run.</p>

<p>Some, if not all, pollute, beyond caste men's use, any food upon
which their shadow falls. Food, after such defilement, can only be
destroyed.</p>

<p>Others, again, exude "distance pollution" as an effluvium from
their unhappy bodies. If one of these presumes to approach and
linger by a highroad, he must measure the distance to the highroad.
If it be within two hundred yards, he must carefully place on the
road a green leaf weighted down with a handful of earth, thereby
indicating that he, the unclean, is within pollution distance of
that point. The passing Brahman, seeing the signal, halts and
shouts. The poor man forthwith takes to his heels, and only when he
has fled far enough calls back, "I am now two hundred yards away.
Be pleased to pass."</p>

<p>Still others--the Puliahs of the Malabar Coast--have been
forbidden to build themselves huts, and permitted to construct for
houses nothing better than a sort of leaf awning on poles, or nests
in the crotches of big trees. These may approach no other type of
humanity. Dubois recorded that, in his day, a Nair (high-caste
Hindu) meeting a Puliah on the road, was entitled to stab the
offender on the spot.[4] Today the Nair would hesitate. But still,
today, the Puliah may approach no caste man nearer than sixty or
ninety feet.</p>

<blockquote>[4. <i>Hindu Manners, Customs and Ceremonies,</i> pp.
60-1. See also <i>Three Voyages of Vasco da Gama,</i> Caspar
Correa, Hakluyt Society, London, 1869, p. 155.]</blockquote>

<p>Under such conditions of preordained misery, certain communities
among the Untouchables have developed a business in the practice of
crime. These communities specialize, one in pocket-picking, another
in burglary, yet others in forging, in highway robbery, in murder,
etc., often combining their special trade with prostitution as a
second industry. Scattered all over India and known as the Criminal
Tribes, they number today about four and a half million
persons.</p>

<p>Now it must not be forgotten that the matter of Untouchability,
like almost all other Hindu concerns, is woven, warp and woof, into
the Hindu religion; and that the Hindus are a tremendously
religiose people. To quote the words of that prominent Indian, Sir
Surendranath Banerjea:[5]</p>

<blockquote>[5. <i>A Nation in Making,</i> London, Humphrey
Milford, 1925, p 396.]</blockquote>

<p class="quote">You cannot think of a social question affecting
the Hindu community that is not bound up with religious
considerations; and when divine sanction, in whatever form, is
invoked in aid of a social institution, it sits enthroned in the
popular;l heart with added firmness and fixity, having its roots in
sentiment rather than in reason.</p>

<p>And dire experience shows to what lengths of blood-drenched
madness the people can be goaded by a whisper that their caste is
threatened or that insult is offered to their gods. That this was
from the beginning understood by Government, is shown in an
unequivocal clause in the Queen's Proclamation of December 2,
1858:</p>

<p class="quote">We do strictly charge and enjoin all those who may
be in authority under us that they abstain from all interference
with the religious belief or worship of our subjects, on pain of
our highest displeasure.</p>

<p>Nevertheless the immediate impulse of the Briton in India was to
espouse the cause of the social victim. The Directors of the East
India Company, as early as 1854, recommended that "no boy be
refused admission to a Government school or college on ground of
caste," and stuck to the principle until their authority was sunk
in that of the Crown. Thenceforward it was continually reaffirmed,
yet pushed with a caution that might seem faint-hearted to one
unfamiliar with the extreme delicacy of the ground. Little or
nothing was to be gained m any attempt to impose a foreign idea, by
force, on unready and non-understanding millions.</p>

<p>Nor must the workings of caste be confused with snobbery. A
man's caste is the outward sign of the history of his soul. To
break caste by infringing any one of the multitudinous caste laws
brings down an eternal penalty. If, as a Hindu, in obeying these
laws, you inflict suffering upon another, that is merely because
his soul-history has placed him in the path of pain. You have no
concern in the matter; neither will he, thinking as a good Hindu,
blame you. For both you and he are working out your god-appointed
destiny.</p>

<p>Today almost all that can be accomplished by civil law for the
Untouchable has been secured. Government has freely opened their
way, as far as Government can determine, to every educational
advantage and to high offices. And Government's various
land-development and cooperative schemes, steadily increasing, have
provided tremendous redeeming agencies and avenues of escape.</p>

<p>But for Provincial Governments to pass legislation asserting the
rights of every citizen to enjoy public facilities, such as public
schools, is one thing; to enforce that legislation over enormous
countrysides and through multitudinous small villages without the
cooperation and against the will of the people, is another. Witness
that paragraph in the Madras Government Order of March 17, 1919,
reading:</p>

<p class="quote">Children of Panchamas [Untouchables] are admitted
only into 609 schools out of 8,157 in the Presidency, although the
regulations state that no boy is to be refused admission merely on
the ground of caste.</p>

<p>Yet, rightly read, the announcement proclaims a signal advantage
won. Six hundred and nine schools in a most orthodox province
admitting outcastes, as against only twelve times that number who
refuse!</p>

<p>In the Bombay Legislative Council, one day in August, 1926, they
were discussing a resolution to coerce local boards to permit
Untouchables to send their children to schools, to draw water from
public wells, and to enjoy other common rights of citizenship. Most
of the Hindu members approved in principle. "But if the resolution
is put into effect we would be faced with a storm of opposition,"
demurred one member, representative of many others. "Orthodox
opinion is too strong, and while I sympathize with the resolution I
think that...given effect, it may have disastrous effect."[6] And
he submits that the path of wisdom, for friends of the
Untouchables, is not to ask for action, but, instead, to content
themselves with verbal expressions of sympathy, such as his
own.</p>

<blockquote>[6. <i>Bombay Legislative Council Debates,</i> 1926,
Vol. XVIII, Part IX, p. 717.]</blockquote>

<p>A second Hindu member, with characteristic nimble-ness,
pitchforks the load toward shoulders broad enough to bear
it:[7]</p>

<blockquote>[7. <i>Ibid.,</i> p. 728.]</blockquote>

<p class="quote">I think the British Goyernment have followed a
very timid policy in this presidency. They have refused to take
part in any social legislation. Probably, being an alien
Government, they were afraid that they would be accused of
tampering with the religion of the various communities. In spite of
the Proclamation of Queen Victoria about equality between the
different classes and communities, Government have not given
practical effect to it.</p>

<p>It remains, however, to a Muhammadan, Mr. Noor Mahomed, of Sind,
to strike the practical note:[8]</p>

<blockquote>[8. <i>Ibid.,</i> August <i>5,</i> p.
721.]</blockquote>

<p class="quote">I think the day will not be distant when the
people who are placed by the tyranny of the higher classes into the
lower grade of society...will find themselves driven to other
religious folds. There will then be no reason at all for the Hindu
society to complain that Mahomedan or Christian missionaries are
inducing members of depressed classes to change the religion of
their birth...If the Hindu society refuses to allow other human
beings, fellow creatures at that, to attend public schools, and
if...the president of a local board representing so many lakhs[9]
of people in this House refuses to allow his fellows and brothers
the bare elementary human right of having water to drink, what
right have they to ask for more rights from the
bureaucracy?...Before we accuse people coming from other lands, we
should see how we ourselves behave toward our own people...How can
[we] ask for greater political rights when [we ourselves] deny
elementary rights of human beings?</p>

<blockquote>[9. A lakh is one hundred thousand.]</blockquote>

<p>Regulations may prevail to bring the outcaste to the school
door, but his courage may not suffice to get him across the
threshold, for his self-assertion was done to death centuries ago.
So that his admission to the school will mean, at best, permission
to sit on the veranda and pick up from that distance whatever he
can by his unaided ears.</p>

<p>Says the Village Education Commission:[10]</p>

<blockquote>[10. <i>Village Education in India,</i> London, Oxford
University Press, 1922, p. 21.]</blockquote>

<p class="quote">Speaking generally, it is still the case that the
caste man not only does nothing for the enlightenment of the
outcaste, but puts positive obstacles in his way, knowing that if
he is enlightened he can no longer be exploited. Outcastes who have
the temerity to send their children to school--even if the school
be in their quarter, so that there can be no complaint of defiling
caste children by contact--find themselves subject to such violence
and threatening that they yield and withdraw their children. If the
outcastes want not only education but Christian teaching, the
persecution, for a time, is all the fiercer, for the caste people
are afraid that if the outcastes become Christians they will no
longer be available for menial service.</p>

<p>An exceedingly small percentage of the outcastes are yet in
school, but he of their number who pursues education past all the
dragons that bar the door is likely to be one of the best of his
kind. And, in spite of his immemorial history of degradation, the
seed of the power to rise is not dead within him. The Nama-sudras
of Bengal, an Untouchable class there numbering about 1,997,500,
have, under the encouragement of the new light, made a vigorous,
steady, and successful fight for self-elevation, and have organized
to support schools of their own. By the last report they had in
Bengal over 49,000 children under tuition, of whom 1,025 had
reached the High School and 144 the Arts Colleges,[11] where,
because of caste feeling, Government has been obliged to set aside
special hostels for their lodging. This community is rapidly
raising its status.</p>

<blockquote>[11. <i>Progress of Education in Bengal,</i> Sixth
Quinquennial Review.]</blockquote>

<p>In the Punjab, where Government irrigation work is destroying
many ancient miseries, appears evidence of a weakening of the ban
that bars the outcaste from the common schools; although some of
the Punjab municipalities have displayed a genius in tricking these
most needy of their citizens out of the privileges of
education.[12] Bombay's educational reports also indicate a
significant advance in the percentage of Untouchables receiving
tuition, largely under mission auspices. And the net results point
to some interesting surmises.</p>

<blockquote>[12. Cf. <i>Report on the Progress of Education in the
Punjab,</i> 1924-25. Lahore, 1926, p. 71.]</blockquote>

<p>Thus, the "depressed classes" have begun holding annual
conferences of delegates to air their wrongs and to advance their
rights. Their special representatives, now appointed to
legislatures and to local bodies, grow more and more assertive.
Their economic situation under Government's steady effort, is, in
some communities, looking up. With it their sense of manhood is
developing in the shape of resentment of the degradation to which
until now they have bowed. Among them a few men of power and parts
are beginning to stand out.</p>

<p>Finally, their women, as Christian converts, furnish the main
body of Indian teachers for the girls of India of all castes, and
of trained nurses for the hospitals; both callings despised and
rejected by the superior castes, both necessitating education, and
both carrying the possibility of increasing influence.</p>

<p>The first time that I, personally, approached a realizing sense
of what the doctrine of Untouchability means, in terms of man's
inhumanity to man, was during a visit to a child-welfare center in
a northerly Indian city.</p>

<p>The place was crowded with Indian women who had brought their
babies to be examined by the English professional in charge, a
trained public health nurse. Toward her their attitude was that of
children toward a wise and loving mother--confiding, affectionate,
trusting. And their needs were inclusive. All morning I had been
watching babies washed and weighed and examined, simple remedies
handed out, questions answered, advice and friendly cautions given,
encouragement and praise. Just now I happened to be looking at a
matronly high-caste woman with an intelligent, clean-cut face. She
was loaded with heavy gold and silver jewelry and wore a silken
mantle. She sat down on the floor to show her baby, unrolling him
from the torn fragment of an old quilt, his only garment. This
revealed his whole little body caked in a mass of dry and half-dry
excreta.</p>

<p>"She appears unconcerned," I remarked to the Sister. The Sister
replied:</p>

<p>"We try to get such women to have napkins for their babies, but
they won't buy them, they won't wash them themselves, and they
won't pay washers to wash them, although they are quite able to do
so. This woman is well born. Her husband is well educated--a
technical man--and enjoys a good salary. Sometime it may please her
to hang that bit of quilt out in the sun in her courtyard, and,
when it is dry, to brush off what will come off. That's all. This,
incidentally, helps explain why infantile diarrhoea spreads through
the families in a district. They will make no attempt whatever to
keep things clean."</p>

<p>As the Sister spoke, a figure appeared before the open
doorway--a young woman so graceful and with a face so sweet and
appealing as to rivet attention at once. She carried an ailing baby
on her arm, but came no farther--just stood still beyond the
doorway, wistfully smiling. The Sister, looking up, smiled
back.</p>

<p>"Why does she not come in?" I asked.</p>

<p>"She dare not. If she did, all these others would go. She is an
Untouchable--an outcaste. She herself would feel it wicked to set
her foot upon that sill."</p>

<p>"She looks at least as decent as they," I remarked.</p>

<p>"Untouchables may be as intelligent as any one else--and you see
for yourself that they couldn't be dirtier," said the Sister. "But
such is the custom of India. Since we can't alter it, we just plod
on, trying to help them all, as best we can."</p>

<p>And so the gentle suppliant waited outside, among a crowd of
others of her kind, till Sister could go to them, bringing to this
one ointment for baby's eyes, to that one a mixture for baby's
cough, and hearing the story of another.</p>

<p>But they might not bring their little ones in, to the mercy of
the warm bath, as the other women were doing at will. They might
not come to the sewing class. They might not defile the scales by
laying their babies in its basket, to see what the milk-dole was
doing. For they were all horrible sinners in aeons past, deserving
now neither help nor sympathy while they worked out their curse.

<h2>CHAPTER XII - BEHOLD, A LIGHT!</h2>

<p>Much is said of the inferiority of character that has resulted
from the Untouchables' long degradation, But evidence of the
survival of virtues, through all the crushing of the centuries, is
by no means lacking. The Mahars, for example, outcastes used by
caste villagers as are the Palers of Madras, practically as slaves
<i>[1]</i> and for the basest tasks, are now employed by Government
as couriers. In that capacity they are said to be entirely
trustworthy, transporting hundreds of rupees without abstracting
the smallest coin. The Dheds, Untouchables from whom, in the Bombay
region, most Britons' servants are drawn, and whom few high caste
Indians would tolerate near their persons, are, as a rule, honest,
sober, and faithful.</p>

<p>As to the rating of converts to Christianity--there are now
about five million of them--opinions differ; but in any case the
fact stands that these converts are set free, as far as they can
grasp freedom, from caste bonds. The faces of the Hindus are fixed
against them, to be sure. But of the converts of the third
generation many experienced persons are found to say that they are
the hope of India.</p>

<blockquote>[1. <i>Joint Select Committee on the Government of
India .,</i> Vol. II, <i>Minutes of Evidence,</i> p. 188, Rai
Bahadur K. V. Reddi; "They are the slaves of the
Nation."]</blockquote>

<p>So much, thus far, Britain, greatly aided By the Christian
Missions, has accomplished for the outcaste, by patient, up-hill
work, teaching, persuading, encouraging, on either side of the
social gulf. And the last few years have seen the rise of new
portents in the sky.</p>

<p>One of these is the tendency, in the National Social Conference
and in Hindu political conventions, to declare openly against the
oppression of the outcaste. But these declarations, though
eloquent, have as yet borne little fruit other than words. A second
phenomenon is the appearance of Indian volunteer associations
partially pledged against Untouchability. These include the
Servants of India,[2] avowedly political; Lord Sin-ha's society for
the help of the outcastes of Bengal and Assam; the Brahmo Samaj,
and others. Their work, useful where it touches, is sporadic, and
infinitesimal compared to the need, but notable in comparison with
the nothingness that went before.</p>

<blockquote>[2. <i>A Brief Account of the Work of the Servants of
India Society,</i> Aryabhushan Press, Poona, 1924, pp.
60-1.]</blockquote>

<p>For no such conception is native to India. "All our Indian
social work of today," the most distinguished of the Brahmo Samaj
leaders said to me, "is frankly an imitation of the English and an
outgrowth of theii influence in the land." Again and again I heard
the gist of that statement from the lips of thoughtful Indians, in
frank acknowledgment of the source of the budding change.</p>

<p>"The curse of Untouchability prevails to this day in all parts
of India," said Sir Narayan Chandravarkar,[3] adding, "with the
liberalizing forces of the British Government, the problem is
leaping into full light. Thanks to that Government, it has
become...an all-India problem."</p>

<blockquote>[3. Hindu reformer, Judge of the High Court of Bombay,
quoted in <i>India in 1920,</i> p. 135.]</blockquote>

<p>Mr. Gandhi has been less ready to acknowledge beneficent
influence from such a source--has, in fact, described the whole
administrative system in India as "vile beyond description." But
for the last five years his own warfare on Untouchability has not
flagged even though his one unfaltering co-worker therein has been
the British Government, aided preeminently by the Salvation Army.
In its course he reprinted from the Indian vernacular press a
learned Brahman pundit's recent statement on the subject, including
this passage:[4]</p>

<blockquote>[4. <i>Young India,</i> July 29, 1926, p. 268. Mr.
Gandhi's phrase quoted a few lines above will be found in
<i>Gandhi's Letters on Indian <b>Af*</b> fairs,</i> Madras, V.
Narayanah and Co., p. 121.]</blockquote>

<p class="quote">Untouchability is a necessity for man's
growth.<br>
<br>
Man has magnetic powers about him. This <i>sakti</i>[5] is like
milk. It will be damaged by improper contacts. If one can keep musk
and onion together, one may mix Brahmans and Untouchables.</p>

<blockquote>[5. Energy, or the power of the Supreme
personified.]</blockquote>

<p class="quote">It should be enough that Untouchables are not
denied the privileges of the other world.</p>

<p>Says Mr. Gandhi, in comment on the pundit's creed:[6]</p>

<blockquote>[6. <i>Young India,</i> July 29, 1926.]</blockquote>

<p class="quote">If it was possible to deny them the privileges of
the other world, it is highly likely that the defenders of the
monster would isolate them even in the other world.</p>

<p>"Among living Indians," says Professor Rushbrook Williams,[7]
"Mr. Gandhi has done most to impress upon his fellow countrymen the
necessity for elevating the depressed classes...When he was at the
height of his reputation, the more orthodox sections of opinion did
not dare to challenge his schemes."</p>

<blockquote>[7. <i>India in 1924-25,</i> p. 264.]</blockquote>

<p>But today the defenders of Untouchability are myriad, and,
though Mr. Gandhi lives his faith, but few of his supporters have
at any time cared to follow him so far.</p>

<p>On January 5, 1925, a mass meeting of Hindus was held in Bombay
to protest against Mr. Gandhi's "heresy" in attacking
Untouchability. The presiding officer, Mr. Manamohandas Ramji,
explained that Untouchability rests on a plane with the segregation
of persons afflicted with contagious diseases. Later he interpreted
the speaker who pointedly suggested lynching for "heretics" who
"threaten the disruption of Hindu society," to mean only that
Hindus are "prepared to sacrifice their lives for the Hindu
religion in order to preserve its ancient purity." The meeting
closed after appointing a committee specially to undermine Mr.
Gandhi's propaganda.</p>

<p>And it is fair to say that the discussions of Untouchability
evoked by successive introductions of the subject in the great
Hindu conventions show mainly by the heat of the system's defenders
that ground has been won.</p>

<p>"You saw," said Mr. Gandhi, "the squabble that arose over it, in
the Hindu <i>Mahasabha."</i> But Untouchability is going, in spite
of all opposition, and going fast. It has degraded Indian humanity.
The 'Untouchables' are treated as if less than beasts. Their very
shadow denies in the name of God. I am as strong or stronger in
denouncing Untouchability as I am in denouncing British methods
imposed on India. Untouchability for me is more insufferable than
British rule. If Hinduism hugs Untouchability, then Hinduism is
dead and gone."[8][9]</p>

<blockquote>[8. A hot and disorderly demonstration directed against
those who would relax the pains of the Untouchables had persisted
in the session of this great Hindu Convention of
1926.]</blockquote>

<blockquote>[9. Verbal statement to the author. Revised by Mr.
Gandhi.]</blockquote>

<p>Meantime another and a curious development has come to the
Untouchables' aid. With the rapid Indianization of Government
services, with the rapid concessions in Indian autonomy that have
characterized British administration since the World War, an
intense jealousy has arisen between the Hindu three-quarters and
the Muhammadan fourth of the population. This subject will be
treated elsewhere. Here it will suffice merely to name it as the
reason why the Untouchables, simply because of numbers, have
suddenly become an object of solicitude to the Hindu world. Sir T.
W. Holderness, writing in 1920, put the point thus:[10]</p>

<blockquote>[10. <i>Peoples and Problems of India,</i> Revised
Edition, London, Williams and Norgate, 1920, pp.
101-2.]</blockquote>

<p class="quote">The "depressed classes" in India form a vast
multitude...A question that is agitating Hinduism at the present
moment is as to whether these classes should be counted as Hindus
or not. Ten years ago the answer would have been emphatically in
the negative. Even now the conservative feeling of the country is
for their exclusion. But the conscience of the more advanced
section of the educated Hindus is a little sensitive on the point.
It is awkward to be reminded by rival Muhammadan politicians that
more than one-third of the supposed total Hindu population is not
accepted by Hindus as a part of themselves, is not allowed the
ministration of Brahman priests, is excluded from Hindu shrines. It
is ob-viously desirable, in presence of such an argument, to claim
the "depressed castes" as within the pale of Hinduism. But if they
are to be so reckoned, logic demands that they should be treated
with greater consideration than at present. Educated Hindus see
this, and the uplifting of these castes figures prominently on the
programmes of Indian social conferences. But the stoutest-hearted
reformer admits to himself that the difficulties in the way of
effective action in this matter are great, so strong is the hold
that caste has on the Indian mind.</p>

<p>But here a fresh element comes in--another disturbing fruit of
the intrusion of the West--a likelihood that, stimulated by the
strange new foreign sympathy, the Untouchable may not much longer
leave his religious status to be determined at the leisure and
pleasure of the Hindu caste man. Islam, utterly democratic, will
readily receive him into full partnership in the fold. Christianity
not only invites him, but will educate and help him. The moment he
accepts either Islam or Christianity, he is rid of his shame. The
question, then, is chiefly a question of how long it takes a man,
ages oppressed, to summon courage, spirit, and energy to stand up
and shake off the dust.</p>

<p>In the autumn of 1917, the then Secretary of State for India,
Mr. Montagu, chief advocate of the speedy Indianization of the
Government, sat in Delhi receiving deputations from such elements
of the Indian peoples as were moved to address him on that subject.
All sorts and conditions of men appeared, all sorts of documentary
petitions were submitted, all sorts of angles and interests. Among
these, not meanly represented, loomed an element new on the Indian
political stage--the Untouchables, awake and assertive, in many
organized groups entreating the Secretary's attention.</p>

<p>Without one divergent voice they deprecated the thought of Home
Rule for India. To quote them at length would be repetition. Their
tenor may be sufficiently gathered from two excerpts.</p>

<p>The Panchama Kalvi Abivirthi-Abimana Sanga, a Madras Presidency
outcastes' association,[11] "deprecates political change and
desires only to be saved from the Brahmin, whose motive in seeking
a greater share in the Government is...that of the cobra seeking
the charge of a young frog."</p>

<blockquote>[11. <i>Addresses Presented in India to His Excellency
the Viceroy and the Right Honourable the Secretary of State for
India,</i> London, 1918, p. 87.]</blockquote>

<p>The Madras Adi Dravida Jana Sabha, organized to represent six
million Dravidian aborigines of Madras Presidency, said:[12]</p>

<blockquote>[12. <i>Ibid.,</i> pp. 60-1.]</blockquote>

<p class="quote">The caste system of the Hindus stigmatises us as
untouchables...Caste Hindus could not, however, get on without our
assistance. We supplied labour and they enjoyed the fruit, giving
us a mere pittance in return. Our improvement in the social and
economic scale began with and is due to the British Government. The
Britishers in India--Government officers, merchants, and last, but
not least, Christian missionaries--love us, and we love them in
return. Though the general condition of the community is still very
low, there are some educated men amongst us. But these are not
allowed to rise in society on account of the general stigma
attached by the Hindus to the community. The very names by which
these people refer to us breathe contempt.<br>
<br>
We need not say that we are strongly opposed to Home Rule. We shall
fight to the last drop of our blood any attempt to transfer the
seat of authority in this country from British hands to so-called
high caste Hindus who have ill-treated us in the past and would do
so again but for the protection of British laws. Even as it is, our
claims, nay, our very existence, is ignored by the Hindus; and how
will they promote our interests if the control of the
administration passes into their hands?</p>

<p>"We love them," said these spokesmen of the out-caste--and the
expression strikes home with a certain shock. But one is forced to
remember that the sorrows of these particular under-dogs have never
before, in all their dim centuries of history, elicited from any
creature a thought or a helping hand. Here is a tale, as told to
me, to show that even the degradation of ages cannot kill that in a
man which lifts up his heart to his friend.</p>

<p>It concerns a command of Madrassi Sappers--coal-black Dravidians
from around Bangalore--Untouchables all, or almost all. And it
happened in the World War, at the taking of Kut.</p>

<p>"The river," said the witness, "is about three hundred yards
wide at that point and swift. Our job was to cross in pontoons in
the dim first gray of the morning, hoping to surprise the Turk. The
duty of the sappers was to take the boats up the night before,
under cover of darkness, and to make them ready; then to stand back
while the combatant troops rowed themselves across.</p>

<p>"The sappers did their job. But just as the moment came to
embark our men, the Turk waked up and opened fire. Our surprise was
a washout. But we carried on, all the same.</p>

<p>"Now, the troops could lie flat in the bottom of the boats, but
their rowers must sit on the thwarts and pull--three hundred yards,
slantwise, in point-blank rifle range. Why, they hadn't a
chance!</p>

<p>"What happened? What but those little Madrassis, pushing
forward, all eagerness, begging: 'Sahibs, you want rifles over
there. <i>Rifles,</i> Sahibs, <i>rifles!</i> We are only sappers.
Let <i>us</i> row!'</p>

<p>"So the troops, rushing down, sprang into the boats and
stretched flat. And the sappers jumped into the thwarts and pulled.
And then--the Turk's machine-guns!</p>

<p>"When the boats came back, out of seventy rowers scarcely a man
was left unhurt and many were dead. But those little sapper fellows
ashore, they swarmed down, hove their dead out on the bank, jumped
into their places, and, as each boat filled with men, shoved off
into their comrades' fate. That is how the rifles got over to Kut.
And those were coal-black Dravidians, mind you--'Untouchables,'
unless they had turned Christian--which a fair lot of them
had."</p>

<p>When the Prince of Wales sailed to India, late <b>in</b> 1921,
Mr. Gandhi, then at the height of his popularity, proclaimed to the
Hindu world that the coming visit was "an insult added to injury,"
and called for a general boycott.[13]</p>

<blockquote>[13. <i>Gandhi's Letters on Indian Affairs,</i> pp.
96-7.]</blockquote>

<p>Political workers obediently snatched up the torch, rushing it
through their organizations, and the Prince's landing in Bombay
became thereby the signal for murderous riot and destruction. No
outbreak occurred among the responsible part of the population, nor
along the line of progress, which was, of course, well guarded. But
in the remoter areas of the city, hooliganism ran on for several
days, with some fifty killings and four hundred woundings, Indian
attacking Indian, while arson and loot played their ruinous
part.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the Prince, seemingly unmoved by the first unfriendly
reception of all his life, proceeded to carry out his officially
arranged programme in and about the city. On the evening of
November 22 it was scheduled that he should depart for the
North.</p>

<p>As he left Government House on the three- or four-mile drive to
the Bombay railway station, his automobile ran unguarded save for
the pilot police car that went before. Where it entered the city,
however, a cordon of police lined the streets on both sides. And
behind that cordon pressed the people--the common poor people of
the countryside in their uncountable thousands; pressed and pushed
until, with the railway station yet half a mile away, the police
line bent and broke beneath the strain.</p>

<p>Instantly the crowd surged in, closing around the car, shouting,
fighting each other to work nearer--nearer still. What would they
do? What was their temper? God knew! Gandhi's hot words had spread
among them, and God alone, now, could help. Some reached the
running-boards and clung. Others shoved them off, for one instant
to take their places, the next themselves to be dragged away. And
what was this they shouted? At first nothing could be made of it,
in the bedlam of voices, though those charged with the safety of
the progress strained their ears to catch the cries.</p>

<p>Then words stood out, continuously chanted, and the words were
these:</p>

<p><i>"Yuvaraj Maharaj ki jai!"</i> "Hail to the Prince!" And: "Let
me see my Prince! Let me see my Prince! Let me only see my Prince
just once before I die!"</p>

<p>The police tried vainly to form again around the car. Moving at
a crawl, quite unprotected now, through an almost solid mass of
shouting humanity, it won through to the railway station at
last.</p>

<p>There, within the barriers that shut off the platform of the
royal train, gathered the dignitaries of the Province and the City,
to make their formal farewells. To these His Royal Highness
listened, returning due acknowledgments. Then, clipping short his
own last word, he turned suddenly to the aide beside him.</p>

<p>"How much time left?"</p>

<p>"Three minutes, sir," replied the aide.</p>

<p>"Then drop those barriers and let the people in"--indicating the
mobs outside.</p>

<p>"Our hearts jumped into our mouths," said the men who told me
the tale, ''but the barriers, of course, went down."</p>

<p>Like the sweep of a river in flood the interminable multitudes
rolled in--and shouted and adored and laughed and wept, and, when
the train started, ran alongside the royal carriage till they could
run no more.</p>

<p>After which one or two super-responsible officials went straight
home to bed.</p>

<p>So the Prince of Wales moved northward. And as he moved, much of
his wholesome influence was lost, through the active hostility of
the Indian political leader.</p>

<p>But if Gandhi's exhortations traveled, so did the news of the
Prince's aspect--traveled far and fast, as such things do amongst
primitive peoples.</p>

<p>And when he turned back from his transit of the Great North
Gate--the Khyber Pass itself--a strange thing awaited him. A swarm
of Untouchables, emboldened by news that had reached them,
clustered at the roadside to do him reverence, "Government <i>ki
jai!"</i> "Hail to the Government!" they shouted, with cheers that
echoed from the barren hills.</p>

<p>And when the Prince slowed down his car to return their
greetings, they leapt and danced in their excitement.</p>

<p>For nowhere in all their store of memory or of legend had they
any history of an Indian magnate who had noticed an Untouchable
except to scorn him. And here was a greater than all India
contained--the son of the Supreme Power, to them almost divine, who
deigned not only to receive but even to thank them for their
homage! Small wonder that their spirits soared, that their eyes saw
visions, that their tongues laid hold upon mystic words.</p>

<p>"Look! Look!" they cried to one another. "Behold, the Light! the
Light!"</p>

<p>And such was their exaltation that many of them somehow worked
through to Delhi to add themselves to the twenty-five thousand of
their kind who there awaited the Prince's coming. The village
people from round about flocked in to join them--the simple people
of the soil who know nothing of politics but much of friendship as
shown in works. And all together haunted the roadside, waiting and
hoping for a glimpse of his face.</p>

<p>At last he came, down the Grand Trunk Road, toward the Delhi
Gate. And in the center of the hosts of the Untouchables, one,
standing higher than the rest, unfurled a flag.</p>

<p><i>"Yuvaraj Maharaj ki jai! Raja ke Bete ki jai!</i>
</p>

<p>"Hail to the Prince! Hail to the King's Son!" they all shouted
together, to burst their throats. And the Prince, while the
high-caste Indian spectators wondered and revolted within
themselves at his lack of princely pride, ordered his car
stopped.</p>

<p>Then a spokesman ventured forward, to offer in a humble little
speech the love and fealty of the sixty millions of the Unclean and
to beg the heir to the throne to intercede for them with his father
the King Emperor, never to abandon them into the hands of those who
despised them and would keep them slaves.</p>

<p>The Prince heard him through. Then--whether he realized the
magnitude of what he did, or whether he acted merely on the impulse
of his natural friendly courtesy toward all the world--he did an
unheard-of thing. He stood up--stood up, for them, the "worse than
dogs," spoke a few words of kindness, looked them all over, slowly,
and so, with a radiant smile, gave them his salute.</p>

<p>No sun that had risen in India had witnessed such a sight. As
the car started on, moving slowly not to crush them, they went
almost mad. And again their eastern tongues clothed their thought.
"Brother--that word was truth that our brothers brought us. Behold,
the Light is there indeed! The Light--the Glory--on his face!"

<h2>CHAPTER XIII - GIVE ME OFFICE OR GIVE ME DEATH</h2>

<p>Education, some Indian politicians affirm, should be driven into
the Indian masses by compulsory measures. "England," they say,
"introduced compulsory education at home long ago. Why does she not
do so here? Because, clearly, it suits her purpose to leave the
people ignorant."</p>

<p>To this I took down a hot reply from the lips of the Raja of
Panagal, then anti-Brahman leader of Madras Presidency.</p>

<p>"Rubbish!" he exclaimed. "What did the Brahmans do for our
education in the five thousand years before Britain came? I remind
you: They asserted their right to pour hot lead into the ears of
the low-caste man who should dare to study books. All learning
belonged to them, they said. When the Muhammadans swarmed in and
took us, even that was an improvement on the old Hindu
r&eacute;gime. But only in Britain's day did education become the
right of all, with state schools, colleges, and universities
accessible &icirc;o all castes, communities, and peoples."</p>

<p>"[The Brahmans] saw well enough," says Dubois,[1] what a moral
ascendancy knowledge would give them over the other castes, and
they therefore made a mystery of it by taking all possible
precautions to prevent other classes from obtaining access to
it."</p>

<blockquote>[1. <i>Hindu Manners, Customs and Ceremonies,</i> p.
376.]</blockquote>

<p>But the Brahmans, whatever their intellectual achievement in
earliest times, rested quiescent upon these laurels through the
succeeding centuries. They were content, while denying light to the
remainder of their world, to abide, themselves, in the ever-fading
wisdom of the ever-dimmer past. Says the Abb&eacute; Du-bois again,
writing in the beginning of the nineteenth century:[2]</p>

<blockquote>[2. <i>Ibid.,</i> pp. 376-7.]</blockquote>

<p class="quote">I do not believe that the Brahmins of modern times
are, in any degree, more learned than their ancestors of the time
of Lycurgus and Pythagoras. During this long space of time many
barbarous races have emerged from the darkness of ignorance, have
attained the summit of civilization, and have extended their
intellectual researches...yet all this time the Hindus have been
perfectly stationary. We do not find amongst them any trace of
mental or moral improvement, any sign of advance in the arts and
sciences. Every impartial observer must, indeed, admit that they
are now very far behind the peoples who inscribed their names long
after them on the roll of civilized nations.</p>

<p>This was written some half-century before the British Crown
assumed the government of India.</p>

<p>During that fifty years a new educational movement sprang up in
the land. The design of Warren Hastings and later of the East India
Company, impelled by the British Parliament, had been to advance
Indian culture, as such, toward a native fruition. It remained for
a private citizen, one David Hare, an English merchant domiciled in
India, to start the wheels turning the opposite way.</p>

<p>David Hare, no missionary, but an agnostic, was a man with a
conviction. Under its impulse he gave himself and his all to "the
education and moral improvement of the natives of Bengal." Parallel
to him worked the famous Hindu, Raja Ram Mohan Roy, a solitary soul
fired to action by the status of his own people in the intellectual
and social-ethical world. And these two, one in purpose, at length
joined to create a secular Hindu College, whose object they
announced as "the tuition of the sons of respectable Hindoos in the
English and Indian language and in the literature and science of
Europe and Asia."</p>

<p>The project, however, only roused the wrath and distrust of the
orthodox Hindu. This was in 1817.</p>

<p>A year later three Baptist missionaries, Carey, Marshman and
Ward, founded a still-extant school near Calcutta. In 1820 the
Anglican Church opened a college. In 1830 Alexander Duff, again
with the help of Ram Mohan Roy, instituted a fourth college for the
giving of western science to India. A network of primitive
vernacular schools at that time existed throughout Bengal, but it
was Raja Ram Mohan Roy himself who continuously urged upon the
British authorities the necessity, if "the improvement of the
native population" were contemplated, of doing away with the old
code and system, of teaching western sciences, and of conducting
such teachings in the English language.[3] While these influences
were still combating the earlier attitude of the British with its
basic tenet that Indian education should run along Indian lines,
came a new force into the field--one Thomas Babington Macaulay, to
be Chairman of a Committee of Public Instruction. Lord Macaulay
declared, and with tremendous vigor, on the side of the western
school. In the name of honor and of humanity the full light of
western science must, he felt, be given to the Indian world. And he
demanded,[4] with fervor, to know by what right, when</p>

<p class="quote">...we can patronise sound philosophy and true

doctrines, which would disgrace an English farrier,--astronomy,
which would move laughter in girls at an English boarding
school,--history, abounding with kings thirty feet high, and reigns
thirty thousand years long,--and geography, made up of seas of
treacle and seas of butter?...What we spend on the Arabic and
Sanskrit colleges is not merely a dead loss to the cause of truth;
it is bounty money paid to raise up champions of error.</p>

<p>This new advocate, welcomed with acclaim by a few modernist
Hindus facing the condemnation of their community, finally cast the
expenditures of public educational monies from oriental into
western channels. Departments of Public Instruction were now set up
in each province and practical steps taken to stimulate private
effort in the establishment of schools and colleges.</p>

<p>All this was done with a definitely stated object--to give into
the hands of the peoples the key to health and prosperity and
social advance, and to rouse them to "the development of the vast
resources of their country...and gradually, but certainly, confer
upon them all the advantages which accompany the healthy increase
of wealth and commerce."[5]</p>

<blockquote>[5. Despatch of Sir Charles Wood, 1854.]</blockquote>

<p>It should not, however, be understood either that Government now
discouraged oriental learning as such or that it excluded the
vernacular. On the contrary, it insisted on the proper teaching of
the vernacular in all schools, looking forward to the day when that
vehicle should achieve a development sufficient to convey the ideas
of modern science.[6] Meantime, it chose to teach in English rather
than in either of the two classic Indian languages, for the reasons
that any one of the three would have to be learned as a new
language by all save the most exceptional students, and that the
necessary books did not exist in either eastern tongue.</p>

<blockquote>[6. See <i>Calcutta University Commission Report,</i>
Vol. I, Chapter III; and Vol. II, Chapter XVIII; also <i>The
Educational Despatch of 1854.</i>]</blockquote>

<p>Centers of teaching now gradually multiplied. In the thirty
years following 1857, five universities were established--in
Calcutta, Bombay, Madras, Lahore, and Allahabad. Aside from
literacy courses, instruction in practical, non-literary branches
was urged upon the attention of all minded to learn.</p>

<p>But the difficulty then as now was that commerce, scientific
agriculture, forestry, engineering, teaching, none of these avenues
for service smiled to Indian ambition. India as a national entity
was ever an unknown concept to the Indian. And thought for the
country at large holds little or no part in native ethical
equipment</p>

<p>This last-named fact, damaging as it is from our viewpoint,
should be thoughtfully taken as a fact and not as an accusation. It
is the logical fruit of the honestly held doctrines of fate and
transmigration and of the consequent egocentric attitude.</p>

<p>For present purposes, the history of modern India's educational
progress may be passed over, to reach statistics of today.</p>

<p>In 1923-4 thirteen universities of British India put forth a
total of 11,222 graduates. Of these, 7,822 took their degrees in
arts and sciences, 2,046 in law, 446 in medicine, 140 in
engineering, 546 in education, 136 in commerce, and 86 in
agriculture. At the same time, the universities showed an
enrollment of 68,530 undergraduates, not dissimilarly
apportioned.[7] The high figures consistently stand opposite the
arts and law courses, while such vital subjects as agriculture,
hygiene and sanitation, surgery, obstetrics, veterinary science and
commerce, under whatever aegis offered, still attract few
disciples.</p>

<blockquote>[7. <i>Statistical Abstract for British India,</i>
1914-15 to 1923-24, p. 279.]</blockquote>

<p>For example, the agricultural school maintained by the American
Presbyterian Mission near Allahabad, although equipped to receive
two hundred scholars, had in 1926 only fifty men in residence.</p>

<p>"We don't care to be coolies," the majority say, turning away in
disgust when they find that the study of agriculture demands
familiarity with soil and crops.</p>

<p>"If," says the director, "we could guarantee our graduates a
Government office, we should be crowded."</p>

<p>I heard of few technical schools, anywhere in India, that are
pressed for room.</p>

<p>The representative Indian desires a university Arts degree, yet
not for learning's sake, [8] but solely as a means to public
office. To attain this vantage-ground he will grind cruelly hard,
driven by the whip and spur of his own and his family's ambition,
and will often finally wreck the poor little body that he and his
forebears have already so mercilessly maltreated.</p>

<blockquote>[8. Cf. Mr. Thyagarajaiyer (Indian), Census
Superintendent of Mysore, <i>Census of India,</i> Vol. I, p. 182:
"The pursuit of letters purely as a means for intellectual growth
is mostly a figment of the theorists."]</blockquote>

<p>Previous chapters have indicated the nature of this
maltreatment. One of its consequences is to be seen in the sudden
mental drooping and failure--the "fading," as it has come to be
called, that so frequently develops in the brilliant Indian student
shortly after his university years.</p>

<p>Meantime, if, when he stands panting and exhausted, degree in
hand, his chosen reward is not forthcoming, the whole family's
disappointment is bitter, their sense of injury and injustice
great.</p>

<p>Then it is that the young man's poverty of alternatives stands
most in his light and in that of Mother India. A land rich in
opportunities for usefulness pleads for the service of his brain
and his hands, but tradition and "pride" make him blind, deaf and
callous to the call.</p>

<p>As Sir Gooroo Dass Banerjee mildly states it:[9]</p>

<blockquote>[9. <i>Calcutta University Commission Report,</i> Vol.
III, p. 161.]</blockquote>

<p class="quote">The caste system . , . has created in the higher
castes a prejudice against agricultural, technological, and even
commercial pursuits.</p>

<p>The university graduate m these latter days may not be a
high-caste man. But if he is not, all the more is he hungry to
assume high-caste customs, since education's dearest prize is its
promise of increased <i>izzat--</i>prestige. Whatever their birth,
men disappointed of office are therefore apt flatly to refuse to
turn their energies in other directions where their superior
knowledge and training would make them infinitely useful to their
less favored brothers. Rather than take employment which they
consider below their newly acquired dignity, they will sponge
forever, idle and unashamed, on the family to which they
belong.</p>

<p>"I am a Bachelor of Arts," said a typical youth, simply; "I have
not been able to secure a suitable post since my graduation two
years ago, so my brother is supporting me. He, having no B.A., can
afford to work for one-third the wages that my position compels me
to expect."</p>

<p>Nor had the speaker the faintest suspicion that he might be
presenting himself in an unflattering light. Even the attempt to
capture a degree is held to confer distinction. A man may and does
write after his name, "B.A. Plucked" or "B.A. Failed," without
exciting the mirth of his public.[10]</p>

<blockquote>[10. The terms are actually used in common parlance as
if in themselves a title, like M.A. or Ph.D.--as: "The school...is
now under an enthusiastic B.A. plucked teacher." <i>Fifteenth
Annual Report of the Society for the Improvement of the Backward
Classes, Bengal &amp; Assam,</i> Calcutta, 1925, p.
12.]</blockquote>

<p>A second case among those that came to my personal attention was
that of a young university graduate, disappointed of Government
employment, who petitioned an American business man for relief.</p>

<p>"Why do you fellows always persist in pushing in where you're
not needed, and then being affronted and outraged because there's
no room?" asked the American, with American bluntness. "How can you
possibly all be Government clerks? Why on earth don't any of you
ever go home to your villages, teach school, or farm, or do
sanitation and give the poor old home town a lift, out of what
you've got? Couldn't you make a living there all right, while you
did a job of work?"</p>

<p>"Doubtless," replied the Indian, patiently. "But you forget.
That is beneath my dignity now. I am a B.A. Therefore, if you will
not help me, I shall commit suicide."</p>

<p>And he did.</p>

<p>Lord Macaulay, over ninety years ago, observed the same
phenomenon in the attitude of the Indian educated at Government
expense. Regarding a petition presented to his committee by a body
of ex-students of the Sanskrit College, he says:[11]</p>

<blockquote>[11. <i>Minute on Education,</i> Feb. 2,
1835.]</blockquote>

<p class="quote">The petitioners stated that they had studied in
the college ten or twelve years; that they had made themselves
acquainted with Hindoo literature and science; that they had
received certificates of proficiency; and what is the fruit of all
this!..."We have but little prospect of bettering our
condition...the indifference with which we are generally looked
upon by our countrymen leaving no hope of encouragement and
assistance from them." They therefore beg that they may be
recommended...for places under the Government, not places of high
dignity or emolument, but such as may just enable them to exist.
"We want means," they say, "for a decent living, and for our
progressive improvement, which, however, we cannot obtain without
the assistance of Government, by whom we have been educated and
maintained from childhood." They conclude by representing, very
pathetically, that they are sure that it was never the intention of
Government, after behaving so liberally to them during their
education, to abandon them to destitution and neglect.</p>

<p>The petition amounts to a demand for redress brought against a
Government that has inflicted upon them the injury of a liberal
education. "And," comments Macaulay:</p>

<p>I doubt not that they are in the right...[for] surely we might,
with advantage, have saved the cost of making these persons useless
and miserable; surely, men may be brought up to be burdens to the
public...at a somewhat smaller charge to the State.</p>

<p>Sanskrit scholars of a century ago or B.A.'s of today, whether
plucked or feathered, the principle remains the same, though the
spirit has mounted from mild complaint to bitterness.</p>

<p>All over India, among politicians and intelligentsia, Government
is hotly assailed for its failure to provide offices for the yearly
output of university graduates. With rancor and seeming conviction,
Indian gentlemen of the highest political leadership hurl charges
from this ground.</p>

<p>"Government," they repeat, "sustains the university. Government
is responsible for its existence. What does it mean by accepting
our fees for educating us and then not giving us the only thing we
want education for? Cursed be the Government! Come, let us drive it
out and make places for ourselves and our friends."</p>

<p>Nor is there anywhere that saving humor of public opinion whose
Homeric laugh would greet the American lad, just out of Yale or
Harvard or Leland Stanford, who should present his shining
sheepskin as a draft on the Treasury Department, and who should
tragically refuse any form of work save anti-government agitation
if the draft were not promptly cashed. <a name="ch-14" id=

<h2>CHAPTER XIV - WE BOTH MEANT WELL</h2>

<p>Between the years 1918 and 1920, compulsory education laws for
primary grades were, indeed, enacted in the seven major provinces
of India. This was largely the effect of an Indian political
opinion which saw, in principle, at least, the need of a literate
electorate in a future democracy.</p>

<p>The laws, however, although operative in some few localities,
are permissive in character and have since remained largely
inactive[1]--a result partly due to the fact that the period of
their passage was the period of the "Reforms." "Dyarchy" came in,
with its increased Indianization of Government. Education itself,
as a function of Government, became a "transferred subject" passing
into the hands of Indian provincial ministers responsible to
elected legislative councils. The responsibility, and with it the
unpopularity to be incurred by enforcement of unpopular measures,
had now changed sides. The Indian ministers, the Indian municipal
boards, found it less easy to shoulder the burden than it had been
to blame their predecessors in burden-bearing. No elected officer,
anywhere, wanted either to sponsor the running up of budgets or to
dragoon the children of a resentful public into schools
Undesired.</p>

<blockquote>[1. For example: "The Bengal Legislature...passed an
Act introducing the principle of compulsory primary education in
May, 1919; but it does not appear that a single local authority in
the province has availed itself of the option for which the Act
provides"--"Primary Education in Bengal," London <i>Times,</i>
Educational Supplement, Nov. 13, 1926, p. 484.<br>
<br>
A recent official report prepared by Mr. Govindbhai H. Desai, Naib
Dewan of Baroda, by order of the reigning prince, shows that
although that state has had compulsory education for twenty years,
its proportion of literacy is less than that of the adjoining
British districts where education began much earlier than in
Baroda, but where compulsion scarcely exists.]</blockquote>

<p>Compulsory education, moreover, should mean free education. To
build schools and to employ teachers enough to care for all the
children in the land without charge would mean money galore--which
must be taxed out of the people.</p>

<p>In one province--the Punjab--the Hindu element in the
Legislature tried to meet one aspect of the crux by saddling the
compelling act with a by-law exempting from school attendance all
"Untouchables," otherwise known as "depressed classes." This idea,
pleasant as it was for the &eacute;lite, withered in the hands of
unsympathetic British authority. As with the Maharajas,[2] so at
the other end of the social scale, it would sanction no class
monopoly of public education.</p>

<blockquote>[2. See <i>ante,</i> p. 137.]</blockquote>

<p>Thus Government spoke. But negative weapons, ever India's most
effective arms, remained unblunted. How two Punjab cities used them
is revealed as follows:[3]</p>

<blockquote>[3. <i>Progress of Edvfdtion in India,</i> Eighth
Quinquennial Review, Vol. I, p. 108.]</blockquote>

<p class="quote">The percentage of boys of compulsory age at school
has risen with the introduction of compulsion in Multan from 27 to
54 and in Lahore from 50 to <i>62.</i> Since no provision has been
made at either place for the education of the children belonging to
the depressed classes and no proceedings have yet been taken
against any defaulting parent, it is improbable that a much higher
percentage of attendance can be expected in the near future.</p>

<p>Showing that there are more ways than one to keep the under-dog
in his kennel!</p>

<p>In all British India, the total number of primary schools,
whether for boys or girls, was, by latest official report, [4]
168,013. Their pupils numbered approximately 7,000,000. But there
are in British India about thirty-six and a half million children
of primary school age,[5] 90 per cent, of whom are scattered in
groups averaging in school attendance forty children each." The
education of these children presents all the difficulties that
beset education of difficult folk in other difficult countries,
plus many that are peculiar to India alone, while offsetting
advantages are mainly conspicuous by their absence.[7]</p>

<blockquote>[4. <i>Statistical Abstract for British India,</i>
1914-15 to 1923-24, p. 263.]</blockquote>

<blockquote>[5. <i>Ibid.,</i> p. 24.]</blockquote>

<blockquote>[6. <i>Progress of Education in India 1917-22,</i> Vol.
II, p. ??]</blockquote>

<blockquote>[7. Cf. <i>Village Education in India,</i> pp.
176-7.]</blockquote>

<p>We of America have prided ourselves upon our own educational
efforts for the Philippines, and in India that performance is
frequently cited with wistful respect. Parallels of comparison may
therefore be of interest.</p>

<p>We recall that in the Philippines our educational work has been
seriously burdened by the fact that the islanders speak
eighty-seven dialects [8] and have no common tongue. Against this,
set the two hundred and twenty-two vernaculars spoken in India, [9]
with no common tongue.</p>

<blockquote>[8. <i>Population of the Philippine Islands In
1916,</i> H. Ot&icirc;ey Beyer, Manila, 1917, pp.
19-20.]</blockquote>

<blockquote>[9. <i>Census of India, 1921,</i> Vol. I, Part I, p.
193.]</blockquote>

<p>In the Philippines, again, no alphabet or script aside from our
own is used by the natives. In India fifty different scripts are
employed, having anywhere from two hundred to five hundred
characters each; and these are so diverse as to perplex or defeat
understanding between dialects.</p>

<p>In the Philippines and in India alike, little or no current
literature exists available or of interest to the masses, while in
both countries many dialects have no literature at all. In the
Philippines and in India alike, therefore, lack of home use of the
shallow-rooted knowledge gained in the school produces much loss of
literacy--much wastage of cost and effort.</p>

<p>In the Philippines, no social bars exist--no caste distinctions
except the distinction between <i>cacique</i> and <i>tao--</i>rich
man and poor man--exploiter and exploited. In India something like
three thousand castes [10] split into mutually repellent groups the
Hindu three-quarters of the population.</p>

<blockquote>[10. <i>Oxford History of India,</i> p.
37.]</blockquote>

<p>In the Philippines, whatever may be said of the quality of the
native teachers, especially as instructors in English, their good
will suffices to carry them, both men and women, from the training
schools into little and remote villages and to keep them there, for
two or three years at least, delving on their job. In India, on the
contrary, no educated man wants to serve in the villages. The
villages, therefore, are starved for teachers.</p>

<p>In the Philippines the native population hungers and thirsts
after education and is ready to go all lengths to acquire it, while
rich Filipinos often give handsomely out of their private means to
secure schools for their own localities. In India, on the contrary,
the attitude of the masses toward education for boys is apathy.
Toward education for girls it is nearer antagonism, with a general
unwillingness on the part of masses and classes alike to pay any
educational cost.</p>

<p>The British Administration in India has without doubt made
serious mistakes in its educational policies. As to the nature of
these mistakes, much may be learned by reading the Monroe Survey
Board's report[11] on education in the Philippine Islands. The
policies most frequently decried as British errors in India are the
very policies that we ourselves, and for identical reasons, adopted
and pursued in our attempt to educate our Filipino charges. Nothing
is easier than to criticize from results backward, though even from
that vantage-point conclusions vary.</p>

<blockquote>[11.<i>A Survey of the Educational System of the
Philippines,</i> Manila Bureau of Printing, 1925.]</blockquote>

<p>Queen Victoria, in 1858, on the assumption by the Crown of the
direct Government of India, proclaimed the royal will that:[12]</p>

<blockquote>[12. Foreshadowed in Lord Hardinge's Resolution
o&icirc; 1844]</blockquote>

<p class="quote">So far as may be, our subjects, of whatever race
or creed, be freely and impartially admitted to office in our
service, the duties of which they may be qualified by their
education, ability, and integrity duly to discharge.</p>

<p>Similarly President McKinley, in his instructions to the Hon.
William H. Taft, as President of the first Philippines Commission,
laid down that:[13]</p>

<blockquote>[13. Letter from the Secretary of War, Washington,
April 7, 1900.]</blockquote>

<p class="quote">The natives of the islands...shall be afforded the
opportunity to manage their own local affairs to the fullest extent
of which they are capable, and...which a careful study of their
capacities and observation of the workings of native control show
to be consistent with the maintenance of law, order, and
loyalty.</p>

<p>On both congeries of peoples the effect of these pronouncements
was identical. Their small existing intelligentsia, ardently
desiring office, desired, therefore, that type of education which
prepares for office-holding.</p>

<p>Britain, as we have seen, began with another idea--that of
developing Indian education on native lines. But under Indian
pressure she soon abandoned her first policy;[14] the more readily
because, counting with-out the Indian's egocentric mentality, she
believed that by educating the minds and pushing forward the men
already most cultivated she would induce a process of
"infiltration," whereby, through sympathetic native channels,
learning converted into suitable forms would rapidly seep down
through the masses.</p>

<blockquote>[14. <i>The Heart of Aryavarta,</i> the Earl of
Ronaldshay, London, 1923, Chapters II and III.]</blockquote>

<p>America, on her side, fell at once to training Fili-pino youths
to assume those duties that President Mc-Kinley had indicated. At
the same time, we poured into the empty minds of our young Asiatics
the history and literature of our own people, forgetting, in our
ingenuous altruism, the confusion that must result.</p>

<p>Oblivious of the thousand years of laborious nation-building
that linked Patrick Henry to the Witenage-mot, drunk with the new
vocabulary whose rhythm and thunder they loved to roll upon their
nimble tongues, but whose contents they had no key to guess,
America's new charges at one wild leap cleared the ages and perched
triumphant at Patrick Henry's side: "Give us liberty or give us
death!"</p>

<p>"Self-government is not a thing that can be 'given' to any
people...No people can be 'given' the self-control of maturity,"
said President Wilson, [15] commenting on the situation so evoked.
But such language found no lodgment in brains without background of
racial experience. For words are built of the life-history of
peoples.</p>

<blockquote>[15. <i>Constitutional Government in the United
States,</i> Woodrow Wilson, New York, 1908, pp. 52-3.]</blockquote>

<p>And between the Filipino who had no history, and the Hindu,
whose creative historic period, as we shall see, is effectively as
unrelated to him as the period of Pericles is unrelated to the
modern New York Greek, there was little to choose, in point of
power to grasp the spirit of democracy.</p>

<p>Schools and universities, in the Philippines and in India, have
continued to pour the phrases of western political-social history
into Asiatic minds. Asiatic memories have caught and held the
phrases, supplying strange meanings from their alien inheritance.
The result in each case has been identical. "All the teaching we
have received...has made us clerks or platform orators," said Mr.
Gandhi.[16]</p>

<blockquote>[16. Statement to the author, Ahmedabad, March,
1926.]</blockquote>

<p>But Mr. Gandhi's view sweeps further still:[17]</p>

<blockquote>[17. <i>Indian Home Rule,</i> M. K. Gandhi, Ganesh
&amp; Co., Madras, 1924, pp. 97-8, loo, 113.]</blockquote>

<p class="quote">The ordinary meaning of education is a knowledge
of letters. To teach boys reading, writing and arithmetic is called
primary education. A peasant earns his bread honestly. He has
ordinary knowledge of the world. He knows fairly well how he should
behave towards his parents, his wife, his children and his fellow
villagers. He understands and observes the rules of morality. But
he cannot write his own name. What do you propose to do by giving
him a knowledge of letters? Will you add an inch to his
happiness?...<br>
<br>
It now follows that it is not necessary to make this educa-tion
compulsory. Our ancient school system is enough...We consider your
[modern] schools to be useless.</p>

<p>On such views as this, the Swarajist leader Lala Lajpat Rai
makes caustic comment:[18]</p>

<blockquote>[18. <i>The Problem of National Education in India,</i>
George Alien anc. Unwin, London, 1920, pp. 79-80.]</blockquote>

<p class="quote">There are some good people in India who do, now
and then, talk of the desirability of their country leading a
retired, isolated, and self-contained life. They pine for good old
days and wish them to come back. They sell books which contain this
kind of nonsense. They write poems and songs full of soft
sentimentality. I do not know whether they are idiots or traitors.
I must warn my countrymen most solemnly and earnestly to beware of
them and of that kind of literature...The country must be brought
up to the level of the most modern countries...in thought and
life.</p>

<p>But whose shoulder is being put to the wheel in the enormous
task of bringing 92 per cent, of the populace of British
India--222,000,000 Indian villagers--"up to the level of the most
modern countries," even in the one detail of literacy? Who is going
to do the heavy a-b-c work of creating an Indian electorate on
whose intelligence the work of a responsible government can be
based?</p>

<p>A little while ago a certain American Mission Board, being well
replenished in means from home and about to embark on a new period
of work, convened a number of such Indian gentlemen as were
strongest in citizenship and asked their advice as to future
efforts. The Indian gentlemen, having consulted together, proposed
that all higher education (which is city work), and also the
administration of all funds, be at once turned over to them, the
Indians.</p>

<p>"Does that, then, mean that you see no more use for Americans in
India?"</p>

<p>"By no means! You Americans, of course, will look after the
villages."</p>

<p>"To you, perhaps, it sounds dubious," said a British Civil
Servant of thirty years' experience, to whom I submitted my doubts,
"but we who have spent our lives in the work know that the answer
is this: We must just plod along, giving the people more and yet
more education, as fast as we can get them to take it, until
education becomes too general to arrogate to itself, as it does
today, a distinction by rights due only to ability and character."

<h2>CHAPTER XV - "WHY IS LIGHT DENIED?"</h2>

<p>The illiteracy of India is sometimes attributed to her
poverty--a theory as elusive as the famous priority dispute between
the hen and the egg. But Indian political critics are wont to
charge the high illiteracy rate to the inefficiency, even to the
deliberate purpose, of the sovereign power. Thus, Lala Lajpat Rai,
the Swaraj political leader, refers to the Viceregal Government as
having "so far refused even elementary instruction in the three R's
to our masses."[1] And Mr. Mahomed Ali Jinnah [2] accusingly asks,
"Why is light denied?"</p>

<blockquote>[1. In 1923-24, India's total expenditure of public
funds on education, including municipal, local, Provincial and
Central Government contributions, reached 19.9 crores of rupees, or
$66,333,300. This sum is much too small for the work to be done.
Nevertheless, when taken in relation to the total revenue of
British India it compares not unfavorably with the educational
allotments of other countries. See <i>India <b>in</b> 1924-25,</i>
P- 278; and <i>Statistical Abstract for British India,</i> p.
262.]</blockquote>

<blockquote>[2. Leader of the Nationalist party in the Legislature
of 1925-26.]</blockquote>

<p>But, before subscribing to the views of either of these
legislative leaders, before accepting either India's poverty or
Britain's greed as determining the people's darkness, it may be
well to remember the two points recently examined, and to record a
third.</p>

<p>First, of British India's population of two hundred and
forty-seven million persons, about 50 per cent, are women. The
people of India, as has been shown, have steadfastly opposed the
education of women. And the combined efforts of the British
Government, the few other-minded Indians, and the Christian
missions, have thus far succeeded in conferring literacy upon less
than 2 per cent, of the womankind. Performing the arithmetical
calculation herein suggested, one arrives at an approximate figure
of 121,000,000, representing British India's illiterate women.</p>

<p>Secondly, reckoned in with the population of British India [3]
are sixty million human beings called "Untouchables." To the
education of this element the great Hindu majority has ever been
and still is strongly, actively and effectively opposed.
Subtracting from the Untouchables' total their female half, as
having already been dealt with in the comprehensive figure, and
assuming, in the absence of authoritative figures, 5 per cent, of
literacy among its males, we arrive at another 28,500,000,
representing another lot of Indians con-demned to illiteracy by
direct action of the majority will.</p>

<blockquote>[3. <i>Census of India iczi,</i> Vol. I, Part I, p.
225.]</blockquote>

<p>Now, neither with the inhibition of the women nor with the
inhibition of the Untouchables has poverty anything whatever to do.
As to the action of Government, it has displayed from the first,
both as to women and as to outcastes, a steadfast effort in behalf
of the inhibited against the dictum of their own people. Expressed
in figures, the fact becomes clearer:</p>

<pre>
Illiterate female population of British India 121,000,000
Illiterate male Untouchables                   28,500,000
                                              149,500,000

Total population of British India             247,000,000

Percentage of the population of British India
kept illiterate by the deliberate will of the
orthodox Hindu                                      60.53%
</pre>

<p>Apart from these two factors appears, however, a third of
significance as great, to appreciate whose weight one must keep in
mind that the total population of British India is 90 per cent.
rural--village folk.</p>

<p>As long, therefore, as the villages remain untaught, the
all-India percentage of literacy, no matter what else happens, must
continue practically where it is today--hugging the world's
low-record line.</p>

<p>But to give primary education to one-eighth of the human race,
scattered over an area of 1,094,300 square miles, in five hundred
thousand little villages, obviously demands an army of
teachers.</p>

<p>Now, consider the problem of recruiting that army when no native
women are available for the job. For the village school ma'am, in
the India of today, does not and cannot exist.</p>

<p>Consider the effect on our own task of educating the children of
rural America, from Canada to the Gulf, from the Atlantic to
California, if we were totally debarred from the aid of our legions
of women and girls.</p>

<p>No occidental country has ever faced the attempt to educate its
masses under this back-breaking condition. The richest nation in
the world would stand aghast at the thought.</p>

<p>As for the reason why India's women cannot teach India's
children, that may be re-stated in few words. Indian women of
child-bearing age cannot safely venture, without special
protection, within reach of Indian men.</p>

<p>It would thus appear clear that if Indian self-government were
established tomorrow, and if wealth tomorrow rushed in, succeeding
poverty in the land, India, unless she reversed her own views as to
her "Untouchables" and as to her women, must still continue in the
front line of the earth's illiterates.</p>

<p>As to the statement just made concerning women's unavailability
as teachers in village schools, I have taken it down, just as it
stands, in the United Provinces, over the Punjab, in Bengal and
Bombay Presidencies, and across Madras, from the lips of Hindu and
Muhammadan officials and educators, from Christian Indian educators
and clergy, from American and other Mission heads, and from
responsible British administrators, educational, medical, and
police. So far as I know, it is nowhere on official record, nor has
it been made the subject of important mention in the legislatures.
It is one of those things that, to an Indian, is a natural matter
of course. And the white man administering India has deliberately
adopted the policy of keeping silence on such points--of avoiding
surface irritations, while he delves at the roots of the job.</p>

<p>"I should not have thought of telling you about it," said an
Indian gentleman of high position, a strong nationalist, a
life-long social reformer. "It is so apparent to us that we give it
no thought. Our attitude toward women does not permit a woman of
character and of marriageable age to leave the protection of her
family. Those who have ventured to go out to the villages to
teach--and they are usually Christians--lead a hard life, until or
unless they submit to the incessant importunities of their male
superiors; and their whole career, success and comfort are
determined by the manner in which they receive such importunities.
The same would apply to women nurses. An appeal to departmental
chiefs, since those also are now Indians, would, as a rule, merely
transfer the seat of trouble. The fact is, we Indians do not credit
the possibility of free and honest women. To us it is against
nature. The two terms cancel each other."</p>

<p>The Calcutta University Commission, made up, as will be
recalled, of British, Muhammadan, and Hindu professional men, the
latter distinguished representatives of their respective
communities, expressed the point as follows:[4]</p>

<blockquote>[4. <i>Report,</i> Vol. II, Part I, p.9.]</blockquote>

<p class="quote">The fact has to be faced that until Bengali men
generally learn the rudiments of respect and chivalry toward women
who are not living in <i>zenanas,</i> anything like <b>a service
of</b> women teachers will be impossible.</p>

<p>If the localizing adjective "Bengali" were withdrawn, the
Commission's statement would, it seems, as fairly apply to all
India. Mason Olcott [5] is referring to the whole field when he
says:</p>

<blockquote>[5. <i>Village Schools in India,</i> p.
196.]</blockquote>

<p class="quote">On account of social obstacles and dangers, it is
practically impossible for women to teach in the villages, unless
they are accompanied by their husbands.</p>

<p>Treating of the "almost desperate condition" of mass education
in rural parts, for lack of women teachers, the late Director of
Public Instruction of the Central Provinces says:[6]</p>

<blockquote>[6. <i>The Education of India,</i> Arthur Mayhew,
London, Faber and Gwyer, 1926, p. 268.]</blockquote>

<p class="quote">The general conditions of <i>mofussll</i> [rural]
life and the Indian attitude toward professional unmarried women
are such that life for such as are available is usually
intolerable,</p>

<p>"No Indian girl can go alone to teach in rural tricts. If she
does, she is ruined," the head of a large American Mission college
in northern India affirmed. The speaker was a widely experienced
woman of the world, characterized by as matter-of-fact a freedom
from ignorance as from prejudice. "It is disheartening to know,"
she went on, "that not one of the young women that you see running
about this campus, between classroom and classroom, can be used on
the great job of educating India. Not one will go out into the
villages to answer the abysmal need of the country. Not one dare
risk what awaits her there, for it is no risk, but a certainty. And
yet these people cry out to be given
<i>self-</i>government!"[7]</p>

<blockquote>[7. Statement to the author, February,
1926.]</blockquote>

<p>"Unless women teachers in the <i>mofussil</i> are provided with
protected residences, and enabled to have elderly and near
relatives living with them, it is more than useless, it is almost
cruel, to encourage women tf become teachers," concludes the
Calcutta University Commission after its prolonged survey.[8]</p>

<blockquote>[8. <i>Calcutta University Report,</i> Vol. II, Part I,
p. 9.]</blockquote>

<p>And the authors of an inquiry covering British India, one of
whom is the Indian head of the Y.M.C.A., Mr. Kanakarayan T. Paul,
report:[9]</p>

<blockquote>[9. <i>Village Education in India, the Report of a
Commission of inquiry,</i> Oxford University Press, 1922, p.
98.]</blockquote>

<p class="quote">The social difficulties which so militate against
an adequate supply of women teachers are well known, and are
immensely serious for the welfare of the country. All the primary
school work in the villages is preeminently women's work, and yet
the social conditions are such that no single woman can undertake
it...The lack of women teachers seems to be all but insuperable,
except as the result of a great social change.</p>

<p>That a social stigma should attach to the woman who, under such
circumstances, chooses to become <i>a.</i> teacher, is perhaps
inevitable. One long and closely familiar with Indian conditions
writes:[10]</p>

<blockquote>[10. <i>Census of India,</i> E. A. H. Blunt, C.I.E.,
O.B.E., I.C.S., 1911, Vol. XV, pp. 260-1.]</blockquote>

<p class="quote">It is said that there is a feeling that the
calling cannot he pursued by modest women. <i>Prima facie,</i> it
is difficult to see how such a feeling could arise, but the Indian
argument to support it would take, probably, some such form as
this: "The life's object of woman is marriage; if she is married
her household duties prevent her teaching. If she teaches, she can
have no household duties or else she neglects them. If she has no
household duties she must be unmarried, and the only unmarried
women are no better than they should be. [11] If she neglects her
household duties, she is...no better than she should be.</p>

<blockquote>[11. <i>Census of India,</i> 1911, Vol. XV, p. 229. "It
is safe to say that after the age of seventeen or eighteen no
females are unmarried who are not prostitutes or persons suffering
from some bodily affliction such as leprosy or blindness; the
number of genuine spinsters over twenty is exceedingly small and an
old maid is the rarest of phenomena." These age figures are set
high in order to include the Mu-aammadan women and the small
Christian and Brahmo Samaj element, all of whom marry later than
the Hindu majority.]</blockquote>

<p>This argument might seem to leave room for the deployment of a
rescue contingent drafted from India's 26,800,000 widows, calling
them out of their dismal cloister and into happy constructive work.
The possibility of such a move is, indeed, discussed; some efforts
are afoot in that direction, and a certain number of widows have
been trained. Their usefulness, however, is almost prohibitively
handicapped, in the great school-shy orthodox field, by the
deep-seated religious conviction that bad luck and the evil eye are
the widow's birthright. But, as writes an authority already
quoted:[12]</p>

<blockquote>[12. <i>The Education of India,</i> Arthur Mayhew, p.
268.]</blockquote>

<p class="quote">A far more serious objection is the
difficulty...to safeguard these ladies who take up work outside the
family circle. Their employment without offense or lapse seems
possible only in mission settlements and schools under close and
careful supervision. In a general campaign [widows] can play only
an insignificant part.</p>

<p>In other words, the young widow school-teacher would meet in the
villages the same temptations from within, the same pressure,
exaction of complaisance, and obloquy from without, that await the
single girl.</p>

<p>Thus is reached the almost complete ban which today brands
teaching as socially degrading, and which, as an Indian writer puts
it, [13] "condemns women to be economically dependent upon men, and
makes it impossible for them to engage in any profession other than
that of a housewife."</p>

<blockquote>[13. <i>Reconstructing India,</i> Sir M. Visvesvaraya,
London, P. S. King and Sons, 1920, p. 243.]</blockquote>

<p>The rule has, however, its exceptions. In the year 1922, out of
British India's 123,500,000 women, 4,391 were studying in teachers'
training schools. But of that 4,391, nearly half--2,050--came from
the Indian Christian community, [14] although this body forms but
1.5 per cent, of the total population. And exceedingly few of the
few who are trained serve their country's greatest need.</p>

<blockquote>[14. <i>Progress of Education in India,</i> 1917-22,
Vol. II, pp. 14-15.]</blockquote>

<p>Says a professional educator:[15]</p>

<blockquote>[15. <i>Quinquennial Review of Education in Eastern
Assam and Bengal.</i>]</blockquote>

<p class="quote">It is notoriously difficult to induce Indian women
of goot. position, other than Christians and Brahmos, to undergo
training for the teaching profession; and even of those who are
trained...the majority refuse to go to places when they are
wanted.</p>

<p>Now it chanced, in my own case, that I had seen a good deal of
Indian village life before opportunity arose to visit the women's
training schools. When that opportunity came, I met it, therefore,
with rural conditions fresh in mind and with a strong sense of the
overwhelming importance of rural needs in any scheme for serving
the body politic.</p>

<p>"What are you training for?" I asked the students, "To be
teachers," they generally replied. "Will you teach in the
villages?" "Oh, no!" as though the question were curiously
unintelligent.</p>

<p>"Then who is to teach the village children?" "Oh--Government
must see to that." "And can Government teach without teachers?" "We
cannot tell. Government should arrange." They apparently felt
neither duty nor impulse urging them to go out among their people.
Such sentiments, indeed, would have no history in their mental
inheritance; whereas the human instinct of self-protection would
subconsciously bar the notion of an independent life from crossing
their field of thought.</p>

<p>It would seem, then, taking the several elements of the case
into consideration, that utterances such as Mr. Jinnah's and Lala
Lajpat Rai's[16] must be classified, at best, as relating to the
twig-tips, rather than to the root and trunk, of their "deadly upas
tree."</p>

<blockquote>[16. See <i>ante,</i> p. 199.]</blockquote>

<p>Coming now to the villager himself--the cultivator or the
<i>ryot,</i> as he is called--one finds him in general but slightly
concerned with the village school. Whenever his boy can be useful
to him--to watch the cattle, to do odd jobs--he unhesitatingly
pulls him out of class, whereby is produced a complete uncertainty
in the matter of attendance. Often the <i>ryot</i> is too poor to
keep his little family alive without the help of the children's
labor and of such wages as they can earn. Sickness, too, plays a
large part in keeping school-going down--hookworm, malaria,
congenital weakness. Or, often, the village astrologer, always a
final authority, discovers in the child's horoscope periods
inauspicious for school-going. And in any case, the Indian farmer,
like the typical farmer of all countries, is skeptically inclined
toward innovations. His fathers knew nothing of letters. He knows
nothing of letters himself. [17] Therefore who is to tell him that
letters are good? Will letters make the boy a better bargainer? A
better hand at the plow?</p>

<blockquote>[17. Adult education, in connection with Government's
rural cooperative credit movement, is now doing signal work among
the peasant farmers of the Punjab.]</blockquote>

<p>"The school curriculum is not sufficiently practical," say many
of the British working to better it. "Show the <i>ryot</i> that his
boy will be worth more on the land after a good schooling, and he
will find means somehow to send the boy to school." And such a
writer as the Hindu Sir M. Visvesvaraya does not hesitate to accuse
Government of deliberately making economic education unattractive
in order to keep India dependent. [18] The report of Mr.
Kanakarayan T. Paul's committee, based upon its India-wide
inspection, gives, however, different testimony, saying:[19]</p>

<blockquote>[18. <i>Reconstructing India,</i> p. 258.]</blockquote>

<blockquote>[19. <i>Village Education in India,</i> p.
20.]</blockquote>

<p class="quote">It is often assumed that the education given in
the village school is despised because it is not practical enough.
In many cases, however, the parent's objection is just the
opposite. He has no desire to have his son taught agriculture,
partly because he thinks he knows far more about that than the
teacher, but still more because his ambition is that his boy should
be a teacher or a clerk. If he finds that such a rise in the scale
is improbable, his enthusiasm for education vanishes. Of the mental
and spiritual value of education...he is ignorant.</p>

<p><i>"It is not change in the curriculum in this early stage"</i>
pursues the authority just quoted, "that is going to affect the
efficiency of the school or the length of school attendance, <i>but
the ability ana skill of the teaching staff."</i> <a name="ch-16"

<h2>CHAPTER XVI - A COUNSEL OF PERFECTION</h2>

<p>It was one of the most eminent of living Indians who gave me
this elucidation of the attitude of a respected Hindu nobleman
toward his own "home town."</p>

<p>"Disease, dirt and ignorance are the characteristics of my
country," he said in his perfect English, sitting in his city-house
library where his long rows of law-books stand marshaled along the
walls. "Take my own village, where for centuries the head of my
family has been chief. When I, who am now head, left it seventeen
years ago, it contained some eighteen hundred inhabitants. When I
revisited it, which I did for the first time a few weeks since, I
found that the population had dwindled to fewer than six hundred
persons. I was horrified.</p>

<p>"In the school were seventy or eighty boys apparently five or
six years old. 'Why are you teaching these little children such
advanced subjects?' I asked.</p>

<p>"'But they are not as young as you think,' the school-teacher
replied.</p>

<p>"They were stunted--that is all; stunted for lack of intelligent
care, for lack of proper food, and from malaria, which, say what
you like about mosquitoes, comes because people are hungry. Such
children, such men and women, will be found all over western
Bengal. They have no life, no energy.</p>

<p>"My question, therefore, is plain: <i>What have the British been
doing in the last hundred years that my village should be like
this?</i> It is true that they have turned the Punjab from a desert
to a garden, that they have given food in abundance to millions
there. But what satisfaction is that to me when they let my people
sit in a corner and starve? The British say: 'We had to establish
peace and order before we could take other matters up'; also, 'this
is a vast country, we have to build bridges and roads and
irrigation canals.' But surely, surely, they could have done more,
and faster. And they let my people starve!"</p>

<p>Now this gentleman's village, whose decadence he so deplored,
lies not over four hours by railroad from the city in which he
lives. He is understood to be a man of large wealth, and himself
informed me that his law practice was highly lucrative, naming an
income that would be envied by an eminent lawyer in New York. Yet
he, the one great man of his village, had left that village without
help, advice, leadership, or even a friendly look-in, for seventeen
years, though it lay but a comfortable afternoon's ride away from
his home. And when at last he visited it and found its decay, he
could see no one to blame but a Government that has 500,000 such
villages to care for, and which can but work through human hands
and human intelligence.</p>

<p>Also, he entirely neglected to mention, in accounting for the
present depopulation of his birthplace, that a large industrial
plant lately erected near it had drawn away a heavy percentage of
the villagers by its opportunities of gain.</p>

<p>It would be a graceless requital of courtesy to name the
gentleman just quoted. But perhaps I may without offense name
another, Sirdar Mohammed Nawaz Khan, lord of twenty-six villages in
Attock District, northern Punjab.</p>

<p>This young Muslim went for his early education to the College
for Punjab Chiefs, at Lahore, and thence to the Royal Military
College at Sandhurst, to earn a commission in the Indian Army.
During his stay in England, being from time to time a guest in
English country houses, his attention was caught and fixed by the
attitude of large English landlords toward their tenants.</p>

<p>Coming as a living illustration of the novel principles of
landlord's duties laid down by the English headmaster of his
college in Lahore, the thing struck root in his mind and soon
possessed him. Dashing young soldier that he made, after eighteen
months' service with a Hussar regiment, popular with officers and
men, he resigned his commission and returned to his estates. "For I
see where my place is now," he said.</p>

<p>There he spends his time, riding from village to village,
working out better conditions, better farming methods, better
sanitation, anything that will improve the status of his people.
Twenty-seven years old and with an annual income of some four lakhs
of rupees, he is an enthusiastic dynamo of citizenship, a living
force for good, and the sworn ally of the equally enthusiastic and
hard-working English Deputy Commissioner.</p>

<p>Curiously enough, he strongly objects to Government's new policy
of rapid Indianization of the public services, takes no interest in
Swaraj politics, and less than none in criticism of Government's
efforts to clean up, educate, and enrich the people. His whole time
goes to vigorous cooperation with Government betterment schemes,
and to vigorous original effort.</p>

<p>If the good of the people is the object of government, then
multiplication of the type of Sirdar Mohammed Nawaz Khan, rather
than of the talkers, would produce the strongest argument for more
rapid transfer of responsibility into Indian hands.</p>

<p>Meantime, of those who remain in the little towns and hamlets,
"the upper classes and castes," says Ol-cott, [1] "are often not
only indifferent to the education of the less fortunate villagers,
but are actively opposed to it, since it is likely to interfere
with the unquestioning obedience and service that has been offered
by the lowest castes through the ages."</p>

<blockquote>[1. <i>Village Schools In India,</i> p.
93.]</blockquote>

<p>"There is in rural India very little public opinion in favour of
the education of the common folk," says the Commission of Inquiry,
and "the wealthy land-owner or even the well-to-do farmer has by no
means discovered yet that it is to his interest to educate the
agricultural labourer."[2]</p>

<blockquote>[2. <i>Village Education in India,</i> p.
<i>26.</i>]</blockquote>

<p>The village school-teacher is in general some dreary
incompetent, be he old or young--a heavy wet blanket slopped down
upon a helpless mass of little limp arms and legs and empty,
born-tired child noddles. Consequently anything duller than the
usual Indian village school this world will hardly produce.
Fish-eyed list-lessness sits upon its brow, and its veins run flat
with boredom.</p>

<p>But I, personally, could find nothing to justify the belief that
melancholy, as distinct from the viewpoint produced by the Hindu
religion, is a necessary inborn trait of the Indian. The roots of
joy certainly live within young and old. A smile, I found, brings
forth a ready smile; a joke, a laugh; an object of novelty evokes
interest from all ages, in any village gathering; and serious
philosophical consideration crowned with ripe speech awaits new
thoughts. The villagers are dignified, interesting, enlisting
people, commanding affection and regard and well worthy the service
that for the last sixty-odd years they have enjoyed--good men's
best effort. Without their active and intelligent partnership, no
native Government better than an oligarchy can ever exist in
India.</p>

<p>But it is only to the Briton that the Indian villager of today
can look for steady, sympathetic and practical interest and steady,
reliable help in his multitudinous necessities. It is the British
Deputy Commissioner, none other, who is "his father and his
mother," and upon the mind of that Deputy Commissioner the
villagers' troubles and the villagers' interests sit day and in my
own experience, it was an outstanding fact that in every one of the
scores of villages I visited, from one end of India to the other, I
got from the people a friendly, confiding, happy reception. King
George and the young god Krishna, looking down from the walls of
many a mud cottage, seemed to link the sources of benefit. All
attempts to explain myself as an American proving futile, since a
white face meant only England to them, an "American" nothing at
all--I let it go at that, accepting the welcome that the work of
generations had prepared.</p>

<p>Yet there are so few Britons in India--fewer than 200,000
counting every head, man, woman and child--and there are 500,000
British Indian villages!</p>

<p>"Would not your educated and brilliant young men of India," I
once asked Mr. Gandhi, "be doing better service to India, if,
instead of fighting for political advantage, social place and, in
general, the limelight, they were to efface themselves, go to the
villages, and give their lives to the people?"</p>

<p>"Ah, yes," Mr. Gandhi replied, "but that is a counsel of
perfection."</p>

<p>To four interesting young Indian political leaders in Calcutta,
men well considered in the city, I put the same question: "Would
not you and all like you best serve your beloved Mother India by
the sacrifice to her of your personal and political ambitions--by
losing yourselves in your villages, to work there for the people,
just as so many British, both men and women, are doing today? In
twenty years' time, might not your accomplishment be so great that
those political powers you now vainly and angrily demand would fall
into your hands simply because you had proved yourselves their fit
custodians?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps," said the three. "But talk, also, is work. Talk is now
the only work. Nothing else can be done till we push the alien out
of India."</p>

<p>"If I were running this country, I'd close every university
tomorrow," said the chief executive of a great American business
concern, himself an American long resident in India, deeply and
sympathetically interested in the Indian. "It was a crime to teach
them to be clerks and lawyers and politicians till they'd been
taught to raise food."</p>

<p>"After twenty-odd years of experience in India," said an
American educator at the head of a large college, "I have come to
the conclusion that the whole system here is wrong. These people
should have had two generations of primary schools all over the
land, before ever they saw a grammar school; two generations of
grammar schools before the creation of the first high school; and
certainly not before the seventh or eighth generation should a
single Indian university bave opened its doors." <a name="pt-4" id=

<h1>PART IV</h1>

<h2><i>Interlude</i> - MR. GANDHI</h2>

<p>A small stone house, such as would pass unremarked in any small
town in America. A wicket gate, a sunbaked garden, a bare and clean
room flooded with light from a broadside of windows. In the room,
sitting on a floor cushion with his back to a blank wall, a man. To
his right two younger men, near a slant-topped desk perhaps
eighteen inches high. To his left, a backless wooden bench for the
use of western visitors. If there are other objects in the room,
one does not see them for interest in the man with his back to the
wall.</p>

<p>His head is close-shaven, and such hair as he has is turning
gray. His eyes, small and dark, have a look of weariness, almost of
renunciation, as of one who, having vainly striven, now withdraws
from striving, unconvinced. Yet from time to time, as he talks, his
eyes flash. His ears are large and conspicuously protruding. His
costume, being merely a loin-cloth, exposes his hairy body, his
thin, wiry arms, and his bare, thin, interlaced legs, upon which he
sits like Buddha with the soles of his feet turned up. His hands
are busy with a little wooden spinning-wheel planted on the ground
before him. The right hand twirls the wheel while the left evolves
a cotton thread.</p>

<p>"'What is my message to America?'" he repeated in his light,
dispassionate, even voice. "My message to America is the hum of
this spinning-wheel."</p>

<p>Then he speaks at length, slowly, with pauses. And as he speaks
the two young men, his secretaries, lying over their slant-topped
desk, write down every word he says.</p>

<p>The wheel hums steadily on. And the thread it spins for America
appears and reappears in the pages of this book. <a name="ch-17"

<h2>CHAPTER XVII - THE SIN OF THE SALVATION ARMY</h2>

<p>"Why, after so many years of British rule, is India still so
poor?" the Indian agitator tirelessly repeats.</p>

<p>If he could but take his eyes from the far horizon and direct
them to things under his feet, he would find an answer on every
side, crying aloud for honest thought and labor.</p>

<p>For example, the cattle question, by itself alone, might
determine India's poverty.</p>

<p>India is being eaten up by its own cattle. And even at that the
cattle are starving.</p>

<p>The Live-Stock Census taken over British India in 1919-20 showed
a total of 146,055,859 head of bovine cattle. Of these, 50 per
cent., at a flattering estimate, are reckoned unprofitable. Because
of their uneconomic value, the food they consume, little as it is,
is estimated to represent an annual loss to the country of
$588,000,000, or over four times more than the total land revenue
of British India.[1]</p>

<blockquote>[l. See <i>Proceedings of Board of Agriculture of
India, at Bangalore,</i> <b>Jan. 21,</b> 1924, and following days.
Also see <i>Round Table,</i> No. 59, <b>June,
1925</b>]</blockquote>

<p>The early Hindu leaders, it is surmised, seeing the importance
of the cow to the country, adopted the expedient of deifying her,
to save her from and for the people. Accordingly, Hindu India today
venerates the cow as holy. In the Legislative Assembly of 1921, a
learned Hindu member phrased the point in a way that, probably, no
Hindu would dispute:[2]</p>

<blockquote>[2. <i>Legislative Assembly Debates,</i> 1921, Rai
Bahadur Pandit J. L. Bhargava, Vol. I, Part I, p. 530. See also
<i>Commentaries of the Great Afonso Dalboquerque,</i> translation
of Walter de Gray, London, Hak&laquo; &icirc;uyt Society, 1877. VoL
II, p. 78.]</blockquote>

<p class="quote">Call it prejudice, call it passion, call it the
height of religion, but this is an undoubted fact, that in the
Hindu mind nothing is so deep-rooted as the sanctity of the
cow.</p>

<p>To kill a cow is one of the worst of sins--a deicide. His
Highness, the late Maharaja Scindia of Gwalior, once had the
misfortune to commit that sin. He was driving a locomotive engine
on the opening run over a railway that he had just built. The cow
leaped upon the track. The engine ran her down before the horrified
Prince could forestall his fate. "I think," he told a friend, years
after, "that I shall never finish paying for that disaster, in
penances and purifications, and in gifts to the Brahmans."</p>

<p>Prince or peasant, the cow is his holy mother. She should be
present when he dies, that he may hold her tail as he breathes his
last. Were it only for this reason, she is often kept inside the
house, to be in readiness. When the late Maharaja of Kashmir was
close upon his end, the appointed cow, it is said, refused all
inducements to mount to his chamber; wherefore it became necessary
to carry the Prince to the cow, and with a swiftness that
considered the comfort of his soul only.</p>

<p>Also, the five substances of the cow--milk, clarified butter
(<i>ghee),</i> curds, dung, and urine, duly set in a row in five
little pots, petitioned in prayer for forgiveness and assoilment
and then mixed together and swallowed, surpass in potency all other
means of purifying soul and body. This combination, known as
<i>pancha-gavia,</i> is of grace sufficient to wipe out even the
guilt of sin intentionally committed. Says the Abb&eacute;
Dubois:[3]</p>

<blockquote>[3. <i>Hindu Manners, Customs and Ceremonies,</i> p.
43. See also pp. 152; 195 and 529.]</blockquote>

<p class="quote">Urine is looked upon as the most efficacious for
purifying any kind of uncleanness. I have often seen...Hindus
following the cows to pasture, waiting for the moment when they
could collect the precious liquid in vessels of brass, and carrying
it away while still warm to their houses. I have also seen them
waiting to catch it in the hollow of their hands, drinking some of
it and rubbing their faces and heads with the rest. Rubbing it in
this way is supposed to wash away all external uncleanness, and
drinking it, to cleanse all internal impurity.</p>

<p>Very holy men, adds the Abb&eacute;, drink it daily. And
orthodox India, in these fundamentals, has changed not a whit since
the Abbe's time.</p>

<p>We of the West may reflect at our leisure that to this eventual
expedient are we driving our orthodox Hindu acquaintances when,
whether in India or in America, we, cow-eaters, insist on taking
them in greeting by the hand. One orthodox Prince, at least,
observes the precaution, when going into European society, always
to wear gloves. But it is told of him that, at a certain London
dinner party, when he had removed his gloves, the lady beside him
chanced to observe a ring that he wore.</p>

<p>"What a beautiful stone, your Highness!" she remarked. "May I
look at it?"</p>

<p>"Certainly," said he, and, removing the ring from his finger,
laid it by her plate.</p>

<p>The lady, a person of rank, turned the jewel this way and that,
held it up to the light, admired it as it deserved, and, with
thanks, laid it beside the plate of the owner. The latter then, by
a sidewise glance, indicated the ring to his own attendant who
stood behind his chair.</p>

<p>"Wash it," ordered the Prince, and, undisturbed, resumed his
conversation.</p>

<p>This seeming digression from the chapter's original text may
help to make clear the nature of the cow's hold upon India. And, as
you see them of mid-mornings, trooping in hundreds out from the
cities and villages on their slow, docile way to jungle pasturage,
you might well fancy they know and are glad of their place in the
people's mind. Bright strings of beads--blue, coral, red--adorn
their necks. And in their eyes and the eyes of the bullocks, their
sons, lies a look of slumbrous tranquillity.</p>

<p>That tranquil, far-off gaze is, indeed, often remarked and
acclaimed by the passing traveler as an outward sign of an inner
sense of surrounding love. In Holland, in England, you may observe
an extraordinary tranquillity, peacefulness, friendliness, even in
pastured bulls, which may reasonably be attributed to the gentle
handling to which they are accustomed, to good food and much
grooming, and to the freedom they enjoy. But in India, after
examining facts, one is driven to conclude that the expression in
the eyes of the cows is due partly to low vitality, partly to the
close quarters with humanity in which they live, and for the rest,
simply to the curious cut of the outer corner of the lid, subtly
beautiful like an Aubrey Beardsley woman's.</p>

<p>Fifty years ago, the political Indians say, India had pasturage
enough for all her cattle. However that may have been, judged by a
western definition of "enough," the facts today are otherwise. One
of Mr. Gandhi's Indian writers, Mr. Desai, sees the matter in this
way:[4]</p>

<blockquote>[4. <i>Young India,</i> June 3, 1926, V. G. Desai, p.
200.]</blockquote>

<p class="quote">In ancient times and even during the Musalman
period, cattle enjoyed the benefit of common pastures and had also
the free run of the forests. The maintenance of the cattle cost
their owners practically nothing. But the British Government cast a
greedy eye upon this time-honoured property of the cattle, which
could not speak for themselves and which had none else to speak on
their behalf, and confiscated it, sometimes with an increase in the
land-revenue in view, and at other times in order to oblige their
friends, such as the missionaries.</p>

<p>This writer then supports his last-quoted phrase by the
statement that the Salvation Army was once allowed by Government to
take up 560 acres of public grazing-ground in Gujarat for farm
purposes. He continues:</p>

<p class="quote">The result of this encroachment upon grazing areas
has been that at the present day in India the proportion of grazing
grounds to the total area is the smallest of all countries...It is
not therefore a matter for surprise that our cattle should have
rapidly deteriorated under British rule.</p>

<p>And he cites figures for the United States as leading the list
of happier peoples whose grazing areas are large.</p>

<p>But unfortunately, in choosing his American statistics, Mr.
Desai omits those which carry most value for needy India. We have,
it is true, great grazing areas--but we rotate them and protect
them from over-grazing--a matter unconceived by the Indian. And
even in the section where this area is widest, our semi-arid and
arid western range country, we devote three-fifths of our total
cultivated ground to raising feed for our cattle. Our cotton belt
gives 53 per cent, of its crop area to live-stock feed, as corn,
cow-peas, beans, peanuts, against 10 per cent, used to grow food
for man; our corn and winter wheat belt uses 75 per cent, of its
cultivated land to grow similar forage for its cattle; our corn
belt gives 84 per cent, of its crop-land to forage-growing, and
only 16 per cent, to man's food; and the North and East devote
about 70 per cent, of their crops to fodder. Seven-tenths of our
total crop area is devoted to harvested forage. We have 257,000,000
acres in crops for cattle's feed, against 76,000,000 acres in crops
for human food, and we have one milking cow to every family of
5.[5]</p>

<blockquote>[5. <i>U. S. Department of Agriculture Bulletin No.
895,</i> "Our Forage Resources," Government Printing Office, 1923,
pp. 312-26.]</blockquote>

<p>These are figures that should concern the Indian sincerely
interested in the welfare of his great agricultural country, and I
confess to placing them here at such length in the hope that they
may challenge his eye.</p>

<p>Still pursuing the question of India's cattle, Mr. Gandhi
invoked the counsel of an Italian-trained specialist, domiciled in
India. From him came the impatient reply of the practical man who
sees small beauty in the spared rod where childish folly is wasting
precious substance. If the Indian were not so callous, and so
unintelligent as to the needs of his cattle--if he were only
compelled to rotate crops and to grow fodder as Italians do in
circumstances no better than the Indians', his troubles were done,
says this witness, continuing:[6]</p>

<blockquote>[6. <i>Young India,</i> May 13, 1926, Mr.
Galletti-di-Cadilhac. "The Cattle Problem," p. 177.]</blockquote>

<p class="quote">Rotated crops require no more expenditure of money
than stable crops. In Java the Dutch forced paddy rotation on the
people a century ago, by the <i>sjambok</i> [rhinoceros-hide whip].
The population of Java has increased from 2 million to 30 million
during their rule, and the yield of the rice and sugar fields has
increased prooortionately. The change was brought about not by
capital expenditure but by an intelligent government using force.
In India there is no question of using the <i>sjambok.</i> We wish
to convince, not to compel.</p>

<p>The writer continues:[7]</p>

<blockquote>[7. <i>Young India,</i> p. 109.]</blockquote>

<p class="quote">Where the cow is a valuable possession [as in
Italy], she is tended with care and love, and crops are grown for
her and palaces are built for her. Here [where] she is merely an
object of veneration, she is left to stand and starve in the public
standing- and starving-grounds, which are miscalled grazing-grounds
in India. India should abolish these places of torture and
breeding-grounds of disease and abortion, and every Indian should
devote three-fifths or two-thirds of his land to growing grass and
fodder for his cattle.</p>

<p>No one who has seen the public pasturage will be likely to
dispute the accuracy of the last-quoted witness. "Public standing-
and starving-grounds" they are, nor is there the faintest reason,
despite the celebrants of the past, for supposing that they were
ever materially better. Bernier, the French traveler of the
Mussalman period, testifies:[8]</p>

<blockquote>[8. <i>Travels in the Mogul Empire,</i> p.
326.]</blockquote>

<p class="quote">Owing to the great deficiency of pasture land in
the Indies, it is impossible to maintain large numbers of
cattle...The heat is so intense, and the ground so parched, during
eight months of the year, that the beasts of the field, ready to
die of hunger, feed on every kind of filth, like so many swine.</p>

<p>And one's own eyes and common sense, together with the history
of men and forests, are enough to satisfy one's mind.</p>

<p>Further, the general conditions under which Indian animals have
lived and propagated might have been specially devised for breeding
down to the worst possible type.</p>

<p>Cattle experts know that if a hundred and twenty cows are put
without other food on pasturage that will keep alive only one
hundred, the twenty that perish will be the twenty best milkers;
for the reason that a good milch cow throws her strength to her
milk production, leaving herself a diminished maintenance reserve.
The Indian practice of selection by starvation, therefore, works
the breed downhill, through the survival of the least useful
strain. Again, in India the bull runs with the herds, which may
number three hundred cows. Though he were of the best, such
extravagance; must exhaust him. But, on the consistent contrary, he
is so far from the best as to be deliberately of the worst that can
be found.</p>

<p>When a man needs specially to placate the gods, as upon the
death of his father, he may vow a bull to the temple. And, since
one bull will do as well as another, he naturally chooses his
feeblest, his most misshapen. Or, if he buys the offering, he buys
the cheapest and therefore the poorest to be had. The priests
accept the animal, which, receiving the temple brand, thereupon
becomes holy, goes where he pleases, and serves as sire to a
neighborhood herd. Straying together, starving together, young and
old, better and worse, the poor creatures mingle and transmit to
each other and to their young their manifold flaws and diseases.
Half of India's cattle,[9] if given the food consumed by the worse
half, would produce, it is affirmed, more than India's present
total milk supply.</p>

<blockquote>[9. Samuel Higginbottom, Director of the Allahabad
Agricultural Institute, testimony before the Indian Taxation
Enquiry Committee, 3924-25.]</blockquote>

<p>In eastern Bengal, one of the most fertile countries of the
world, pasturage scarcely exists, the country being entirely taken
up with rice-paddy and jute. They grow no fodder crops for their
cattle and feed a bit of chopped rice-straw or nothing. In western
Bengal, some districts report the loss of 25 per cent, of the
cultivated crops by depredations of hungry stock. The country being
everywhere without fences qr hedges, a man may easily turn his cows
into his sleeping neighbors' crops. The sin is small--the cows are
holy as well as hungry, and the neighbor's distress is both his
illusion and his fate.</p>

<p>I have seen the cow driven by starvation so far from her natural
niceness as to become a scavenger of human excrement. The sight is
common.</p>

<p>In certain districts some green fodder is grown, to be sure, and
during the rains and the earlier cold weather a poor sort of grass
exists on the grazing-grounds of all but the most desert sections.
By January, however, the gray cracked earth is eaten bare, so to
remain until the late spring rains set in--and starvation begins in
earnest.</p>

<p>Mr. Gandhi's correspondent has shown us in the cow's hunger one
of the evil effects of British rule.</p>

<p>And British rule is indeed largely responsible for the present
disastrous condition.</p>

<p>Up to the advent of the British in India, raids great and small,
thieving, banditry and endless internal broils and warfares kept
the country in chronic distress; and a sure butt of every such
activity was the cattle of the attacked. Consequently, with a
spasmodic regularity whose beneficent effect is more easily
appreciated today than can well have been possible at the time, the
cattle of any given area were killed off or driven away, the
grazing-grounds of that area, such as they were, got an interval of
rest, and, for the moment, inbreeding stopped. For new animals had
to be slowly accumulated.</p>

<p>Upon this order broke the British with their self-elected
commitment, first of all, to stop banditry, warfare and destruction
and to establish peace. The task was precisely the same that
America set for herself in the Philippines. As we achieved it in
the Philippines, so did the British achieve it in India--in a
greater interval of time commensurate with the greater area and
population to be pacified. About fifty years ago Britain's work in
this respect, until then all-absorbing, stood at last almost
accomplished. Life and property under her controlling hand had now
become as nearly safe as is, perhaps, possible. Epidemics, also,
were checked and famine largely forestalled. So that, shielded from
enemies that had before kept down their numbers, men and cattle
alike multiplied. And men must be fed. Therefore Government leased
them land[10] in quantity according to their necessities, that they
might raise food for themselves and not die.</p>

<blockquote>[10. By ancient law all land ownership is vested in
Government.]</blockquote>

<p>They have raised food for themselves, but they will not raise
food for their mother the cow. So the cow starves. And the
fault--is the greed of Britain or of the Salvation Army.[11]</p>

<blockquote>[11. Government has largely entrusted to the Salvation
Army, because of its conspicuous success therewith, the reformation
of the criminal tribes, nomads, whose first need is domestication
in a fixed habitat where they may be trained to earn an honest and
sufficient livelihood by agriculture, cattle-raising, and
handiwork. For this purpose and to further its excellent work for
the Untouchables in general, the Salvation Army has received from
Government the use of certain small and scattered tracts of
uncultivated land in Gujerat and elsewhere. It is to this step that
Mr. Gandhi's organ objects. See <i>ante,</i> p. 227. See, further,
<i>Muktifauj,</i> by Commissioner Booth-Tucker, Salvationist
Publishing and Supplies, London.]</blockquote>

<h2>CHAPTER XVIII - THE SACRED COW</h2>

<p>Turning from the people and the cattle within their gates to
Government's experimental work on Government farms, we find one
world-contribution. They have solved a main domestic problem of low
latitudes--how to get milk for the babies.</p>

<p>Only those who have lived in the tropics are likely to
appreciate what this means, in terms of family security, health and
happiness. In the Philippines our own hopeful work was nipped in
the bud by the Filipiniza-tion of the Agricultural Department. From
that day, cattle-breeding became a farce, played out in office
chairs by vague young men spinning webs of words learned by rote in
one or another American college, while a few rough and neglected
animals wearied out a beggar's existence in the corral. And so, as
far as colonial America is concerned, the old notion still
reigned--that the cow can neither be bred nor led to give real
milk, in real quantity, in the tropics.</p>

<p>In other words, our work in that field is yet to do.</p>

<p>But the British in India have given us a tremendous lift and
encouragement to effort. On the Imperial Dairy Farm at Bangalore
their breeding experiments have conclusively proved that, with
skill, care and persistence, a cow can be developed that will stand
up against the tropical climate for fifteen lactations and still
produce well, doing her duty as a human life-saver. In the
Government Military Dairy Farm at Lucknow, I saw "Mongia," a
half-bred cow. sired by an imported American Friesian on a native
dam of the Punjab Hariana stock. Mongia, with her eighth calf, had
given 16,000 pounds[1] of milk in a lactation period of 305 days.
With her seventh calf she gave 14,800 pounds. "Edna," another of
the herd, had reached a production of 15,324 in 305 days.
Butter-fat, with these sturdy half-breeds, runs from 4.05 per cent,
in full lactation to about 5.05 per cent, during hottest weather,
which is beyond even our American home requirements.</p>

<blockquote>[1. 2.15 pounds of milk make a quart]</blockquote>

<p>Again, these cows' milk production drops scarcely at all in hot
weather. Edna began her 1925 lactation in August, starting off at a
steady seventy-pound daily yield. Edna and Mongia are, to be sure,
admittedly stars; but the average daily production of the Lucknow
herd of 105 milking cows of Indo-western crosses was twenty-one
pounds per capita, and the work is yet young.</p>

<p>The best milch breed native to India is the Saniwal, of the
Punjab, which averages only 3,000 pounds a lactation period, and is
too small to be usefully crossbred with our big western milch
stock. But Government within the last ten years have developed on
their farm in Pusa a cross-breed of Saniwal with Montgomery, a
second Punjabi strain, that has more than doubled the previous
Saniwal record, while further interesting experiments, as of
crossing native Sindi stock with imported Ayrshires, are in course
of development at other Government breeding stations.</p>

<p>The significance of all this may be measured in part by the fact
that over 90 per cent. of the cows in India give less than 600
pounds of milk a year, or less than a quart a day.[2]</p>

<blockquote>[2. <i>The Gospel and the Plow,</i> London, 1921.
Samuel Higginbottom, p. 69.]</blockquote>

<p>Government began experiments in the year 1912, Then came the
Great War, preventing the bringing of animals from abroad. Directly
the war was over, Government imported from America, for the Lucknow
farm, two more Friesian bulls, "Segis" and "Elmer." Other
experimental stations were similarly supplied, and the work went
on.</p>

<p>Enough has now been accomplished to prove that stamina goes with
the half-breed, and that, beyond the fifty-fifty point, imported
blood weakens the result, creating extra-susceptibility to the many
diseases of the country. Every cow over half-blood, therefore, is
now bred back to a native bull.</p>

<p>Thus, by selective breeding, by crossing, and by better feeding
and housing, slowly and steadily the results of centuries of
inbreeding, starvation, infection, and of breeding from the worst
are being conquered; definite pedigree types are being fixed; and
the foundations of distinct breeds are building.</p>

<p>The trail is opened, the possibilities revealed. When the people
of India are ready to accept it, their profit is ready to their
hand.</p>

<p>Cattle-lovers, at this point, will be interested in the fact
that India demands a dual-purpose cow, but that "dual purpose," in
India, signifies, not the combination upon which some of us in
America look askance--milk and beef, but--milk and muscle!</p>

<p>The sale of cattle as beef is small; the price of beef in
Lucknow in 1926 was two cents a pound. The Indians' use for a cow,
aside from her religious contribution earlier described, is to
produce, first, milk and butter; second, dung to be used as fuel or
to coat the floors and walls of their dwellings; and, third, to
produce draft animals for the cart and plow. To breed for milk and
for draft might seem a self-canceling proposition. But such is the
demand of the country, and the concern of Government is to get on
with the job and strike the best possible compromise.</p>

<p>On the Government farms, foreign fodder crops, such as Egyptian
clover, have also been introduced; much emphasis is laid on fodder
developments; and the use of silage, economically stored in pits,
is demonstrated. Men are sent out to deliver illustrated lectures
and to install silage pits in the villages. And young pedigreed
herd bulls, whether as loans, or as gifts, or to purchase, are
offered to the people.</p>

<p>All the fine animals produced at Lucknow, Pusa, Bangalore and
the other Government plants, are con-scientiously watched over by
British breeders. In point of general competence, of cleanliness
and order, and of simple practicality, the plants stand inspection.
But all such matters are utterly foreign to the minds of the Indian
peasant, and for those who might best and quickest teach the
peasant--the Indian aristocrat, the Indian intelligentsia--rarely
do peasant or cattle carry any appeal.</p>

<p>With the exception of certain princes of Indian states who have
learned from England to take pride in their herds, and again with
the exception of a mere handful of estate-holders scattered over
the country, cattle-breeding is left entirely to a generally
illiterate class known as <i>gvalas,</i> who lack enterprise,
capital and intelligence to carry on the work.</p>

<p>I saw little, anywhere, to suggest a real appreciation of the
importance of change and much of opposite import, such, for
example, as the spectacle of a fine pedigreed herd bull, lent by
Government for the improvement of the cattle of a village and
returned a wreck from ill-usage. He was brought into a Government
Veterinary Hospital during my visit in the place, and it needed no
testimony other than one's eyes to see that he had been starved,
cruelly beaten and crippled, while the wounds on one leg, obviously
inflicted by blows, were so badly infected that healing seemed
scarcely possible.</p>

<p>"What will you do?" I asked the British official in charge.</p>

<p>"Fine the head man of the village, probably. But it does little
good. It is a human trait not to appreciate what one doesn't pay
for. And they won't pay for bet &bull; tering their cattle."</p>

<p>Further, to take at random another point, it is difficult to get
intelligent selective breeding work out of a people who, for
example, refuse to keep record of the milk-yield of a cow on the
ground that to weigh or to measure the gift of God is impious. "We
will not do it!" the milkers of the Punjab declare. "If we did, our
children would die."</p>

<p>Meantime, aside from the selection of the worst, by starvation
and by breeding from the worst through sacred runt bulls, a third
force works to remove the best milch cows from a land whose supply
of milk is already tragically short. Government, at Karnal, has
amply demonstrated the feasibility of producing milk in the country
and transporting it to the city in bulk, even as far as a thousand
miles. And the Calcutta cooperative dairies have shown the
possibilities of local service from suburb to town. But the Indian
milk purveyor in general sees naught in that. His practice is to
buy the best up-country young milch cows he can find, bring them to
the city in calf, keep them during their current lactation, to
prolong which he often removes their ovaries, and then to sell them
to the butcher. This happens on the grand scale, kills off the best
cows, and thereby constitutes a steady drain on the vital resources
of the country.</p>

<p>The Indian holds that he cannot afford to maintain an animal in
the city during her dry season, and he has no plan for keeping her
elsewhere. Therefore he exterminates her after her lactation; most
of the cost of her raising goes to waste, and her virtues die with
her.[3]</p>

<blockquote>[3. W. Smith, Imperial Dairy Expert, in <i>Agricultural
Journal of India,</i> Vol. XVII, Part I, January,
1922.]</blockquote>

<p>Government, all over India, have learned to prepare for trouble
on the annual Muhammadan feast one of the features of which is the
sacrificial killing of cows. Hindu feeling, at that period, rises
to the danger pitch, and riots, bloodshed and destruction are
always the likely outcome. For is not the embodied Sacrosanctity
that lies at the root of Hinduism being done to der.cn by the
infidel in the very arms of her adorers?</p>

<p>Given this preliminary reminder, nothing is more characteristic
of the Indian mentality than the balancing facts pointed out in Mr.
Gandhi's <i>Young India</i> of November 5, 1925:</p>

<p class="quote">We forget that a hundred times the number of cows
killed for <i>Kurbanl</i>[4] by the Musalmans are killed for
purposes of trade...The cows are almost all owned by Hindus, and
the butchers would find their trade gone if the Hindus refused to
sell the cows.</p>

<blockquote>[4. The annual Muhammadan feast above
mentioned.]</blockquote>

<p>Four weeks after the publication of the leading article above
quoted, Mr. Gandhi returns to the subject, citing what he describes
as "illuminative extracts" from a report of the Indian Industrial
Committee sitting in Bengal and the Central Provinces.[5] The
hearing is on the commercial slaughter of cows for beef and hides.
The investigating committee asks, concerning the attitude of the
surrounding Hindu populace toward the industry:</p>

<blockquote>[5. <i>Young India,</i> Nov. 26, 1925, p.
416.]</blockquote>

<p class="quote">Have these slaughterhouses aroused any local
feeling in the matter?</p>

<p>The witness replies:</p>

<p class="quote">They have aroused local feelings of greed and not
of indig-nation. I think you will find that many of the municipal
members are shareholders in these yards. Brahmans and Hindus are
also found to be shareholders.</p>

<p>"If there is any such thing as a moral government in the
universe, we must answer for it some day," Mr. Gandhi's commentor
helplessly laments.</p>

<p>This example of the selling of the cow by the Hindu for
slaughter--he who will rise in murdering riot if a Muhammadan,
possibly not too averse to the result, kills a cow outside a Hindu
temple door--opens a topic that should perhaps be examined for
other than its face value.</p>

<p>We of the West are continually in danger of misunderstanding the
Indian through supposing that the mental picture produced by a
given word or idea is the same in weight and significance to him
and to us. His facility in English helps us to this error. We
assume that his thought is like his tongue. He says, for example,
that he venerates all life and is filled with tenderness for all
animals. Lecturing in America, he speaks of the Hindu's sensitive
refinement in this direction and of his shrinking from our gross
unspirituality, our incomprehension of the sacred unity of the
vital spark.</p>

<p>But if you suppose, from these seemingly plain words, that the
average Hindu in India shows what we would call common humaneness
toward animal life, you go far astray.</p>

<p>To the highly intelligent Brahman foreman of the Goverment farm
at Bangalore, I one day said: "I regret that all over India you
torture most bullocks and some cows by the disjointing of their
tails. Look at the draft bullocks in that cart over there. Every
vertebra in their tails is dislocated. As you are aware, it causes
exquisite pain. Often the tail is broken short off."</p>

<p>"Ah, yes," replied the young Brahman, indifferently, "it is
perfectly true that we do it. But that, you see, is necessary. The
animals would not travel fast enough unless their tail-nerves are
wrenched."</p>

<p>You may stand for hours on the busy Howrah Bridge in Calcutta,
watching the bullock carts pass, without discovering a dozen
animals whose tails are not a zig-zag string of breaks. It is
easier, you see, for the driver to walk with the animal's tail in
his hand, twisting its joints from time to time, than it is to beat
the creature with his stick. If you ride in the bullock cart,
however, with the driver riding before you, you will discover that,
from this position, he has another way of speeding the gait. With
his stick or his long hard toe-nails he periodically prods his
animals' genital glands.</p>

<p>And only the alien in the land will protest. <a name="page244"
id="page244"></a></p>

<p>It is one of the puzzles of India that a man whose bullock is
his best asset will deliberately overload his animal, and then,
half starved as it is, will drive it till it drops dead. The steep
hillsides of Madras are <i>a.</i> Calvary of draft bullocks. One
sees them, branded from head to tail, almost raw from brands and
blows, forced up-hill until they fall and die. If a British
official sees this or any other deed of cruelty, he acts. But the
British are few in the land. Yet far fewer are the Indians whose
sensibilities are touched by the sufferings of dumb beasts, or
whose wrath is aroused by pain and abuse inflicted upon defenseless
creatures.</p>

<p>The practice of <i>ph&uacute;k&aacute;</i> is common in most
parts of India. Its object is to increase and prolong the milk
production of cows. It is committed in several ways, but usually
consists in thrusting a stick on which is bound a bundle of rough
straw into the vagina of the cow and twisting it about, to produce
irritation. The thing gives intense pain to the cow, and also
produces sterility--&bull; a matter of indifference to the
dairyman, since he will in any case sell her for slaughter when she
dries. Mr. Gandhi cites authority[6] that out of ten thousand cows
in Calcutta dairy sheds, five thousand are daily subjected to this
process.</p>

<blockquote>[6. <i>Young India,</i> May 6, 1926, pp.
166-7.]</blockquote>

<p>Mr. Gandhi quotes another authority on the manufacture of a dye
esteemed by Indians and known as peuri:[7]</p>

<blockquote>[7. <i>Ibid.,</i> p. 167.]</blockquote>

<p class="quote">By feeding the cow only on mango leaves, with no
other form of feed nor even water to drink, the animal passes in
the form of urine a dye which is sold at high rates in the bazaar.
The animal so treated does not last long and dies in agony.</p>

<p>The young milch cow is usually carrying her calf when she is
brought to the city. The Hindu dairyman does not want the calf, and
his religion forbids him to kill it. So he finds other means to
avoid both sin and the costs of keeping. In some sections of the
country he will allow it a daily quarter- to half-cup of its
mother's milk, because of a religious teaching that he who keeps
the calf from the cow will himself suffer in the next life. But the
allowance that saves the owner's soul is too small to save the calf
who staggers about after its mother on the door-to-door milk route
as long as its trembling legs will carry it. When the end comes,
the owner skins the little creature, sews the skin together, stuffs
it crudely with straw, shoves four sticks up the legs, and, when he
goes forth on the morrow driving his cow, carries his handiwork
over his shoulder. Then, when he stops at a customer's door to
milk, he will plant before the mother the thing that was her calf,
to induce her to milk more freely. Or again, in large plants, the
new-born calves may be simply tossed upon the morning garbage
carts, at the dairy door, and carried away to the dumps where they
breathe their last among other broken rubbish.</p>

<p>The water buffalo--the carabao of the Philippines--is in India
an immensely useful creature. The best of the Delhi blood give
yearly from six to ten thousand pounds of milk carrying from 7.5 to
9 per cent, butter-fat. The buffalo bull makes a powerful draft
animal for cart and plow. But the species is large, and expensive
to raise. Therefore it is usual for milk dealers to starve their
buffalo calves outright. <i>Young India</i>[8] quotes testimonies
showing various phases of this practice. One of these draws
attention to</p>

<blockquote>[8. May 6, 1926, p. 167.]</blockquote>

<p class="quote">...the number of buffalo calves...being abandoned
to die of starvation in public streets, and often when they fall
down through sheer exhaustion, being mutilated by trams, motor-cars
and carriages. These animals are generally driven out from, the
cattle stables at night...simply to save all the milk the mother
has, for sale.</p>

<p>Otherwise, the calf is tied to a stake anywhere about the place
and left without food or water till it dies.</p>

<p>The water buffalo, having no sweat-glands, suffers severely in
the hot sun and should never be compelled to endure it unprotected.
Therefore, says another of <i>Young India's</i> authorities, "one
finds that [the starving buffalo calves] are usually tied in the
sunniest part of the yard. The dairymen appear systematically to
use these methods to kill off the young stock."</p>

<p>And then, turning from city dairymen to country owners and
country regions, Mr. Gandhi gives us this picture:[9]</p>

<blockquote>[9. <i>Young India,</i> May 6, 1926, p.
167.]</blockquote>

<p class="quote">In Gujarat [northern Bombay Presidency], the
he-calf is simply starved off by withholding milk from him. In
other parts he is driven away to the forests to become the prey of
wild beasts. In Bengal he is often tied up in the forest and left
without food, either to starve or be devoured. And yet the people
who do this are those who would not allow an animal to be killed
outright even if it were in extreme suffering!</p>

<p>In this, one is reminded of the fate of the villagers' cows,
which, when they are too diseased or too old to give further
service, are turned out of the village, to stand and starve till
they are too weak to defend themselves with heel or horn and then
are pulled down and devoured by the starving village dogs.</p>

<p>Surely no Westerner, even the most meteoric tourist, has passed
through India without observing those dogs. They haunt every
railway platform, skulking along under the car windows. Bad dreams
out of purgatory they look, all bones and sores and grisly hollows,
their great, undoglike eyes full of terror and furtive cunning, of
misery and of hatred. All over the land they exist in hosts,
forever multiplying. In the towns they dispute with the cows and
goats for a scavenger's living among the stalls and gutters of the
bazaars. Devoured with disease and vermin, they often go mad from
bites received from mad jackals of the packs that roam even city
parts by night.</p>

<p>And, according to the Hindu creed, nothing can be done for them.
Their breeding may not be stopped, their number may not be reduced,
and since a dog's touch defiles, their wounds and sores and broken
bones may not be attended.</p>

<p>In this connection an interesting discussion has recently
developed in the pages of <i>Young India.</i>[10] Ths incident that
gave it birth was the destruction of sixty mad dogs, collected on
the premises of an Ahmedabad mill-owner. The mill-owner himself,
though a Hindu, had ordered their killing. This act aroused much
ill feeling in the town, and the Hindu Humanitarian League referred
the question to Mr. Gandhi, as a religious authority, asking:</p>

<blockquote>[10. October and November, 1926. The issue of November
il, 1926, gives the following figures for cases of hydrophobia
treated in the Civil Hospital of the town of Ahmedabad: Jan. to
Dec., 1925, 1117; Jan. to Sept., 1926, 990.]</blockquote>

<p class="quote">When Hinduism forbids the taking of the life of
any living being,...do you think it right to kill rabid dogs?...Are
not the man who actually destroys the dogs, as also the man at
whose instance he does so, both sinners?...The Ahmedabad
Municipality...is soon going to have before it a resolution for the
castration of stray dogs. Does religion sanction the castration of
an animal?</p>

<p>Mr. Gandhi's reply is full of light on Hindu thinking:</p>

<p>There can be no two opinions on the fact that Hinduism regards
killing a living being as sinful...Hinduism has laid down that
killing for sacrifice is no <i>himsa</i> [violence]. This is only a
half-truth...But what is inevitable is not <i>regarded</i> as a
sin, so much so that the science of daily practice has not only
declared the inevitable violence involved in killing for sacrifice
as permissible but even regarded it as meritorious...[But the man]
who is responsible for the protection of lives under his care and
who does not possess the virtues of the recluse [to heal by
spirit], but is capable of destroying a rabid dog, is faced with a
conflict of duties. If he kills the dog he commits a sin. If he
does not kill it, he commits a graver sin. So he prefers to commit
the lesser one...It is therefore a thousand pities that the
question of stray dogs, etc., assumes such a monstrous proportion
in this sacred land of <i>ahimsa</i> [non-violence]. It may be a
sin to destroy rabid dogs and such others as are liable to catch
rabies. ...It is a sin, it should be a sin, to feed stray dogs.</p>

<p>In the land of <i>ahimsa,</i> the rarest of sins is that of
allowing a crumb of food to a starving dog, or, equally, of putting
him out of his misery. Mr. Gandhi's approval of the latter step,
even as to animals gone mad, has brought down upon him such an
avalanche of Hindu protest that he sighs aloud under its burden
upon his time.</p>

<p>And since the only remaining resource, castration, lies under
religious ban because it interrupts the ordained stages of life,
the miseries of the dog, like many another misery of India,
revolves in a circle. <a name="ch-19" id="ch-19"></a></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIX - THE QUALITY OF MERCY</h2>

<p>"We will pose as protectors of the cow, and quarrel with
Mussalmans in her sacred name, the net result being that her last
condition is worse than the first,"[1] laments the faithful accuser
on Mr. Gandhi's staff, and again:</p>

<blockquote>[1. May 6, 1926, V. G. Desai, p. 167.]</blockquote>

<p class="quote">"In spite of our boasted spirituality, we are
still sadly backward in point of humanity and kindness to the lower
animals."[2]</p>

<blockquote>[2. August 26, 1926, p. 303.]</blockquote>

<p>Legislation for the prevention of cruelty to animals was enacted
in the early years of Crown rule in India. But such legislation,
anywhere, must rest for effectiveness on public opinion, and the
opinion of Mr. Gandhi's paper is, in this matter, as a voice crying
in the wilderness, awakening but the faintest of echoes. If the
people feel no compassion; if the police, themselves drawn from the
people, privately consider the law a silly, perhaps an irreligious
law, whose greatest virtue lies in the chance it gives them to fill
their pockets; and if little or no leaven of another sentiment
exists in the higher classes, Government's purpose, as far as it
means immediate relief, is handicapped indeed.</p>

<p>Laws in India for the prevention of cruelty to animals have
uniformly originated as Government bills. Whether of the Central or
of the Provincial Adminis-trations, measures for the protection of
animals frort. cruelty have been passed over the indifference, if
not over the pronounced hostility, of the Indian
representation.</p>

<p>Thus, a bill to limit the driving of water buffaloes, heavily
laden, through the hottest hours of the day in the midst of the
hottest season of the year, was introduced in the Bengal
Legislative Council by Government, on March 16, 1926. In the
streets of Calcutta the sufferings of buffaloes so driven had long
been, to Western susceptibilities, a public scandal. But this
proposal for the animals' relief was finally enacted into law
despite the resistance of the leading Indian merchants, who saw in
it merely a sentimentality inconvenient to their trade.</p>

<p><i>The practice of &lt;&gt;i&gt;ph&uacute;k&aacute;</i>, the
deliberate daily torture of the cow in order that the worth of a
few more pennies may be wrung from her pain, has been forbidden and
heavily penalized by the Governor-General-in-Council and by
successive provincial laws. Mr. Gandhi finds room, in the columns
of <i>Young India,</i>[3] to print an Englishman's protest against
<i>ph&uacute;k&aacute;.</i> But if any mass of Hindu feeling exists
against it, the vitality of that feeling is insufficient to bring
it forth into deeds.</p>

<blockquote>[3. May 13, 1926, p. 174.]</blockquote>

<p>In 1926, the Government of Bombay Presidency introduced in the
Bombay Legislative Council a measure[4] amending the Police Act of
the City of Bombay so that police officers should have power to
kill any animal found in such a condition, whether from hurt or
from disease, that it would be sheer cruelty to attempt to remove
it to a dispensary. In order to safeguard the owner's interests in
the matter, the amendment further provided that, if the owner is
absent, or if he refuses to consent to the destruction of the
suffering animal, the police officer must secure, before he can
proceed under the law, a certificate from one of several
veterinarians whom the Governor-in-Council should appoint.</p>

<blockquote>[4. <i>Bill No. V of 1926,</i> "A Bill Further to Amend
the City of Bombay Police Act, 1902."]</blockquote>

<p>No small part of the necessity for a law such as this would
arise from the Indians' habit, already described, of turning
diseased and dying cows, and calves that he is in process of
starving to death, into the streets to wander until they die what
he calls "a natural death." As their strength fails, they become
less and less able to guide their movements, and, in the end, are
often caught and crushed by some vehicle against whose wheels they
fall.</p>

<p>The debates evoked by the Bombay Government's proposal of relief
throw so much general light on Indian modes of thought that their
quotations at some length may be justified. On the introduction of
the measure, a Hindu member, Mr. S. S. Dev, came at once to his
feet with:[5]</p>

<blockquote>[5. <i>Bombay Legislative Council Debates,</i> Official
Report, 1926, <b>Vol.</b> XVII, Part VII, pp. 579-80.]</blockquote>

<p class="quote">The principle of the bill is revolting to an
Indian mind...If you will not shoot a man in similar circumstances,
how can you shoot an animal, in the name of preventing cruelty to
animals?...Further, the bill, if it becomes law, may in actual
operation give rise to fracas in public streets.</p>

<p>Then follows Mr. Pahalajani, of Western Sind. Says he:[6]</p>

<blockquote>[6. <i>Ibid.,</i> 580.]</blockquote>

<p class="quote">This section makes no exception whatever whether
the animal is a cow or a horse or a dog. The policeman with the
certificate of the veterinary practitioner can destroy any animal.
The official [British] members of the Council ought to know--some
of them have remained here for over 30 years--that no Hindu would
allow a cow to be destroyed in whatsoever condition it is. There
are <i>pinjrapoles</i>[7] in which the worst diseased animals are
nursed and fed...[This measure] proceeds on the assumption that
animals have no soul, and they deserve to be shot if they are not
in a condition to live. The Hindu idea of soul is quite different
from that held by Westerners...A measure of this kind would wound
the religious susceptibilities of Hindus.</p>

<blockquote>[7. Animal asylums, later to be
described.]</blockquote>

<p>To this declaration Mr. Montgomerie, Secretary to Government,
responds, with a picture from the daily life of the city:[8]</p>

<blockquote>[8. <i>Bombay Legislative Council Debates,</i> p.
581.]</blockquote>

<p class="quote">I can hardly think that the honourable member
means what he says. Is it a decent sight to see some poor animal
disembowelled, legs broken and bleeding, in the streets of Bombay?
The only humane thing...is to put the beast out of misery. It is
inhumanity to allow this animal to suffer and remove it with the
probability that it may break to pieces while being so moved.</p>

<p>But Hindu after Hindu decries the measure, and <b>on</b> grounds
of offended sentiment alone, save that one of their number, Mr.
Soman, takes thought that a question of expense is involved. For
the bill empowers Government to appoint a few area veterinarians,
to be locally handy to the police. This charge upon public funds,
Mr. Soman feels, goes beyond any suffering animal's proper claim.
As he puts it:[9]</p>

<blockquote>[9. <i>Bombay Legislative Council Debates,</i> March 2,
1926, p. 583.]</blockquote>

<p class="quote">If any generous minded practitioners come forward
to help the police officers, so much the better. But if any new
posts are to be created, which are to be maintained at public
expense, I would like certainly to oppose the bill.</p>

<p>And the debate, for the day, closes on the note of fate. Says
Rao Sahib D. P. Desai, member from Kaira.[10]</p>

<blockquote>[10. <i>Ibid.,</i> p. 585.]</blockquote>

<p class="quote">All the trouble arises from having two conflicting
ideals of mercy. The f ramers of the bill think that shooting an
animal which is diseased and which could not be cured is much
better. We on the other hand think that God himself has ordained
what is to come about.</p>

<p>On the resumption of the reading of the bill, over three months
later,[11] the Honorable Mr. Hotson, Chief Secretary to Government,
assumes the labor of trying to win Indian support. He
pleads:[12]</p>

<blockquote>[11. July 26, 1926.]</blockquote>

<blockquote>[12. <i>Bombay Legislative Council Debates,</i> Vol.
XVIII, Part I, pp. 70-1.]</blockquote>

<p class="quote">The one object of this bill is to make it possible
to deal with injured animals which are lying in the street or in
any other public place in a state of suffering and pain, for which
there is no relief for them. It is open to the owners of such
animals to remove them, [or] to have them taken away by other
charitable persons to a <i>pinjrapole</i> or to any other place
where animals are received and cared for. It is only in cases where
the animal is neglected in its misery, where, as things are now,
the animal has to lie in the public streets of Bombay for many
hours, perhaps until death brings relief, that the power...will be
exercised. That such an animal should be in such a condition in a
public place where there are many passers-by in a great city like
Bombay...causes pain to observers of all classes and it is
desirable not only that the animal should be relieved...but that
the feelings of the passers-by should be saved from the extreme
discomfort caused by such sights. That is all that this bill seeks
to attain.</p>

<p>But the Hindu position remains unshaken. The old arguments[13]
come forward until, presently, they arouse the Honorable All
Mahomed Khan Dehlavi, Muham-madan, Minister of Agriculture in the
Bombay Government. Says he, expressing himself as "rather anxious
in the interests of agriculturists":[14]</p>

<blockquote>[13. <i>Ibid.,</i> pp. 72-3.]</blockquote>

<blockquote>[14. <i>Ibid.,</i> p. 73.]</blockquote>

<p class="quote">It was argued at the last session that every
animal having a soul should not be destroyed. I have been tackled
severely in this House by honourable members on the opposite
benches for not taking sufficient precaution and for not spending
sufficient money to kill elephants, [wild] pigs and rats in the
interests of agriculturists. And if this is a question of killing a
soul, I think an elephant has a bigger soul than a pig, and the
latter a bigger soul than a rat. If that principle were applied to
the agricultural department, I shall be asked to stop killing the
animals I have mentioned. The result will be that the
agriculturists in the country will suffer very much. I say, Sir,
there is absolutely no difference at all between the case of an
animal in the streets of cities like Bombay, or in the jungles or
fields in the country outside.</p>

<p>The concern of the Minister of Agriculture for the cultivators,
his special charges, again uncovers the usual attitude of the
Indian politician toward that body of humanity which constitutes
over 72 per cent, of the people of India. Says Rao Sahib D. P.
Desai, frankly tossing off their case:[15]</p>

<blockquote>[15. <i>Bombay Legislative Council Debates,</i> p.
76.]</blockquote>

<p class="quote">The agriculturists should not be taken as the
whole of Indian society...But even if the agriculturist thinks that
it is desirable that any animals that are dangerous to agriculture
should be destroyed, it should not be taken that the whole Hindu
society agrees with that view of the agriculturists, and I think
that no weight should be given such views in this House.</p>

<p>Out of the remainder of the day's debate emerge much sterile
criticism and accusation of Government's effort and no fresh
thought excepting that of the old Muhammadan member from the
Central Division, Moulvi Rafiuddin Ahmad, who counsels,
Nestor-wise:[16]</p>

<blockquote>[16. <i>Ibid.,</i> pp. 77-8.]</blockquote>

<p class="quote">It is not the intention in the remotest degree of
the Government to injure the susceptibilities of any classes of His
Majesty's subjects in India...If [anything] can be done by any
other means than by the provisions of this bill, I think Government
will be only too pleased to adopt them, and as far as I know--and I
have been in this house long enough--there has never been any
question of sentiment which Government have not taken into
consideration, and I do admire them for that...In this House Hindus
and Muhamma-dans have joined to oppose Government if in any remote
degree they thought that Government were mistaken and on many
occasions Government have conceded...It is no use coming here with
empty heads, there must be some suggestions offered, it is easy to
criticise, but it is at the same time our duty also to suggest
better measures. I appeal to all those persons that have raised
objections...Government is quite open to reason.</p>

<p>"Are you authorized to speak on behalf of Government?" a Hindu
hotly interrupts.</p>

<p>"I am authorized to speak on behalf of every person with whom
this Council is concerned. I do say this, this objection is
altogether unreasonable," the other returns.</p>

<p>But his appeal wins no response. On the contrary, a Hindu member
grimly suggests that if by chance a Muhammadan were to be appointed
veterinary and were to approve the killing of a sick cow, the peace
of the city as between Hindus and Muhammadans would go up in
smoke.</p>

<p>And the discussion ends by the referring of the bill to a select
committee of the House, composed of nine Indians--Hindu,
Muhammadan, and Parsi, and of two Britons.</p>

<p>In the second reading of this bill,[17] we find the Chief
Secretary of Government, Mr. Hotson, presenting the select
committee's report with the comment that the committee "has gone so
far m the desire to avoid giving offense to any of our brethren"
that the usefulness of the bill has been impaired--a mild and
diplomatic phrasing of the emasculation that has taken place.</p>

<blockquote>[17. August 5, 1926.]</blockquote>

<p>Cows and bulls are now excepted from the proposed law, and
temple precincts are put beyond its reach; anything may happen
there. Yet, without a single constructive proposal of any sort, the
Hindu opposition keeps up. Members urge that legislation be delayed
if not abandoned, that Government are indiscreet in urging any
action; that "the agonies of the animals" are not so great that
sympathy need pass the point of theory; that, in any event, Hindu
policemen should be exempt from the duty of shooting animals, since
to do so is contrary to their religion; that to avoid invidious
distinctions Muhammadan officers may likewise claim exemption;
that, because Indian officers bungle with firearms, British police
sergeants "whose marksmanship is perfect" be charged with the duty.
Says Mr. Surve, Hindu member from Bombay City, advocating the last
suggestion:</p>

<p>"To kill a disabled animal which is just about to die, that kind
of butchery we are incapable of...that is not our
chivalry."[18]</p>

<blockquote>[18. <i>Bombay Legislative Council Debates,</i> August
<i>S</i> 1926, p. 716.]</blockquote>

<p>So failed, for this time at least. Government's attempt to
defend the cow from her worshipers. With its intended chief
beneficiary left out, the bill passed. Yet, Government's argument,
so patiently and courteously pursued, did, as it continued, educe a
certain amount of Indian support. And in view of the fact that the
principle involved is a complete exotic in minds committed to the
expiatory journey of the soul, each bit of ground so gained speaks
of reward, however distant.</p>

<p>It was in 1890 that the Governor-General-in-CounciJ passed the
Act for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, of which Act the
fifth section prohibited the killing of any animal in an
unnecessarily cruel manner. In 1917 it was found necessary to
clarify the intentions of Section V, expressly directing it upon
persons cruelly killing a goat, or having in their possession the
skin of a goat so killed. Provincial Governments have enacted the
same laws. And yet the offense against which these measures are
aimed continues in the land.</p>

<p>It is the skinning of goats alive.</p>

<p>The skin stripped from a living goat can be stretched a little
larger, and therefore brings a little higher price, than one
removed after killing.</p>

<p>It will scarcely be necessary to amplify this point. In the
Province of Behar and Orissa in the year 1925, thirty-four cases of
the flaying alive of goats were brought to court by the police. But
light fines, meted out by Indian judges whose sentiment is not
shocked, are soon worked off in the extra price fetched by the next
batch of flayed-alive skins. The risk of prosecution is small; and
"there is every reason," concludes the Provincial Police
Administration report, "to suppose that the number of reported
cases is no criterion of the prevalence of this outrage." Many
skins so stripped have been shipped to America.</p>

<p>Britain, by example and by teaching, has been working for nearly
three-quarters of a century to implant her own ideas of mercy on an
alien soil. In this and in uncounted other directions she might
perhaps have produced more visible results, in her areas of direct
contact, by the use of force. But her administrative theory has
been that small constructive value lies in the use of force to
bring about surface compliance where the underlying principle is
not yet grasped. And, given a people still barbarian in their
handling of their own I women, it is scarcely to be expected that
they should yet have taken on a mentality responsive to the appeal
of dumb creatures.</p>

<p>Unhappily for the helpless animal world, Prevention of Cruelty
to Animals is, under the current Indi-anization movement, a
"transferred subject" of Government. That is to say: in each
province working the "Reforms" the administration of this branch
has been transferred by the British Parliament into the hands of an
Indian minister. Dumb creation pays with its body the costs of the
experiment. <a name="ch-20" id="ch-20"></a></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XX - IN THE HOUSE OF HER FRIENDS</h2>

<p>"This country is the crudest in the world, to animals," said an
old veterinarian, long practicing in India. It would perhaps be
fairer to repeat that the people of India follow their religions,
which, save with the small sect called Jains, produce no mercy
either to man or to beast, in the sense that we of the West know
mercy.</p>

<p>Mr. Gandhi himself writes:[1]</p>

<blockquote>[1. <i>Young India,</i> Feb. 26, 1925.]</blockquote>

<p class="quote">In a country where the cow is an object of worship
there should be no cattle problems at all. But our cow-worship has
resolved itself into an ignorant fanaticism. The fact that we have
more cattle than we can support is a matter for urgent treatment, I
have already suggested the taking over of the question by cow
protection societies.</p>

<p>Cow Protection Societies maintain <i>gaushalas,</i> or cow
asylums. These asylums, like the <i>pinjrapoles,</i> or asylums for
all animals, are maintained by gifts, and have access, through rich
Hindu merchants, to almost unlimited funds. "Let Government of
India promise to stop the killing of cows in India and they can
have all the money they can use--plus a war with the Muhammadan,"
an experienced old Hindu official once told me.</p>

<p>A strong claim to the bounty of the gods is believed to be
established through saving the life of a cow. Yet as a Hindu, you
are not disturbed in conscience by selling your good cow to a
butcher, because it is he, not you, who will kill the cow. Then,
taking the money he gives you, you may buy of him, for a fraction
of that sum, the worst cow in his shambles, turn her over to the
<i>gaushala</i> to care for, and thereby acquire religious merit,
profiting your soul and your purse in one transaction.</p>

<p>Having personally visited a number of <i>gaushalas</i> and
<i>pinjrapoles,</i> I cannot but wonder whether those who support
them so lavishly, those who commit animals to their care, and those
who, like Mr. Gandhi, so strongly advocate their maintenance and
increase, ever look inside their gates. I first heard of them
through a western animal lover long domiciled in India. He
said:</p>

<p>"The Hindu who, as an act of piety, buys a cow of the butcher
and places her in the <i>gaushala,</i> always buys a poor diseased
animal because he gets her cheap. When he places her in the
<i>gaushala</i> he does not give money with her, or, at best, not
money enough for her decent keep. And even if he did, the keeper
would pocket most of it. The suffering in these places is terrible.
In one of them I recently saw an old cow lying helpless, being
consumed by maggots which had begun at her hind quarters. It would
take them ten days to eat up to her heart and kill her. Till then
she must lie as she lay.</p>

<p>"'Can't you do something for her?' I asked the keeper.</p>

<p>"'Why?' he replied, honestly enough. 'Why should I? What
for?"'</p>

<p>My second informant was an American cattle specialist living in
India, a highly-qualified practical man. He said:</p>

<p>"I was asked to visit some of these <i>gaushalas</i> and give
advice. And because the political unrest since the War has inclined
many of these people to shut their minds to the council of British
officials, I hoped that, as an American and an outsider, I could be
of use. But I found in every place that I visited either
intentional dishonesty or gross mismanagement. In all cases the
animals imprisoned there were the least of anybody's concern. My
advice was not welcome. When they found I would not give them a
rubber-stamp approval, they had no use for me at all."</p>

<p>I next consulted a notable religious leader, the <i>Guru</i>[2]
of Dial Bagh. His words were:</p>

<blockquote>[2. Religious master.]</blockquote>

<p>"I have visited two of these places, both times taking them by
surprise. The sights that I saw there were so horrible that for two
days afterward I could not take food."</p>

<p>Finally, I recorded the testimony of an Indian trained in the
western school of cattle-breeding and dairying and now occupying a
position of considerable responsibility in that line. Describing
the <i>pinjrapole</i> as "a lane or square full of animal's pens,"
he went on?</p>

<p>"Religious sentiment puts the creatures there, but there it
stops. They are much neglected and suffer torments through neglect.
Rich merchants and bankers subscribe annually tons of money for
their care, but the money all goes to graft and waste. The
creatures in most of the asylums are far worse off than they were
when they scavenged in the gutters for a living, with a happy
chance of getting killed by passing cars. They are miserable, dying
skeletons. The caretakers have no knowledge of the care of animals
and no previous training or experience. The money spent in such big
sums is not spent on them! There <i>are</i> good animal asylums in
India, but they are few!"</p>

<p>The first <i>gaushala</i> that I saw for myself was in the
suburbs of a central Indian city. Over the entrance gate was a
charming painting of the blue god Krishna in the forest, piping to
white cows.</p>

<p>Inside the high walls at a distance lay a large pleasant garden
of fruit-trees and vegetable beds encircling a pleasant
bungalow--the keeper's house. On the hither side of the garden was
the place of the cows. This was a treeless, shrubless, shelterless
yard of hard-trodden, cracked, bare clay, which, in the rains,
would be a wallow of foul mud, inhabited by animals whose bones, in
some cases, were literally cutting through their skins. Some lay
gasping, too weak to stand. Some had great open sores at which the
birds, perched on their hipbones or their staring ribs, picked and
tore. Some had broken legs that dangled and flopped as they
stirred. Many were diseased. All were obviously starved.</p>

<p>Bulls as wretched as the cows stood among them, and in a little
pen at the side were packed some 250 small calves. From these last
arose a pitiful outcry, at the sound of approaching steps; and as I
looked down over the pen-wall at their great brown eyes, their
hollow sides and their shaking legs, it occurred to me to ask what
they were fed. The answer, frankly given by the <i>gaushala</i>
attendant, was that each calf gets the equivalent of one small
tea-cupful of milk a day, until it dies--which as a rule, and
happily, it shortly does--the rest of the milk being sold in the
bazaar by the keeper of the <i>gaushala.</i></p>

<p>Asking next to see the daily ration of a cow, I was shown the
granary--a bin measuring perhaps five by three by two feet,
containing small seeds heavily mixed with husks. Of this each
full-grown animal got one half-pound daily. Nothing else whatever
was fed, excepting a little dry chopped straw. Straw contains no
food values, but would serve for a time to keep the creatures' two
sides from touching. No paddock was provided, and no grazing of any
sort. The animals merely stood or lay as I saw them until the
relief of death.</p>

<p>One cow had but three legs, the hind leg having been amputated
below the knee, "because she kicked when they milked her."</p>

<p>In other <i>gaushalas</i> I saw cripples who had been made
<b>so</b> in the process of creating monsters. For this purpose
they cut a leg from one calf and graft it anywhere on the body of
another, to exhibit the result for money as a natural portent. The
maimed calf, if it does not bleed or starve or rot to death, may be
bought for a song and sent to a <i>gaushala.</i> No dissatisfaction
seemed to be felt as to this history.</p>

<p>In the heart of the city of Ahmedabad, within a few miles of Mr.
Gandhi's pleasant and comfortable home in which he writes his
earnest pleas for the support of cow shelters and
<i>pinjrapoles</i>, I visited a large <i>pinjra-pole</i> whose
description, after what has already been said, need not be
inflicted upon the reader's sensibilities. I hope that every animal
that I saw in it is safely dead.</p>

<p>But from such memories it is a pleasure to turn to the one
exception that my personal experience revealed, an establishment
maintained by "The Association for Saving Milch Cattle from Going
to the Bombay Slaughter House."</p>

<p>This society is composed practically entirely of rich Indian
merchants and merchants' associations. Its latest report[3] affords
some interesting reading. It begins with a statement incorporating
the estimate that, during the five years from April 1, 1919, to
March 31, 1924, 229,257 cows were slaughtered in Bombay City, and
that 97,583 calves and young buffaloes were "tortured to death in
the stables."</p>

<blockquote>[3. <i>An Appeal by Shree Ghatkopar Sarvajanika
Jivadaya Khata,</i> 75 Mahabir Building, Bombay.]</blockquote>

<p>The report proceeds with an appeal against all slaughter, even
of bullocks, sheep and goats, for which the figures are also given.
Then it concerns itself with the question of the shortage of
milk:</p>

<p class="quote">We Hindus claim to protect the cow. If this claim
were just, India should be a land flowing with milk. But as a
matter of fact this is not the case. Milk in cow-protecting Bombay,
for instance, is nearly as dear as in cow-killing London or New
York. Good milk cannot be had for love or money and the direct
consequence of this state of things is a really terrible mortality
among infants and a heavy death rate among adults...</p>

<p>The "dairy" plant that the Association itself maintains in the
country on the outskirts of Bombay consists of a decent set of
cowsheds, substantially and practically built for shelter, air and
sanitation, and reasonably clean. The superintendent said he was
feeding fifteen pounds of hay, with eight pounds of grain and oil
cake, per head, daily. And the cattle, such as they were, did not
look hungry. The herd consisted of 277 head, whose aggregate
milking came to about 130 quarts a day, which, sold to some 130
families, gave a daily income of about $22.50 to the establishment.
Fresh cows were sold out of the plant on condition that the
purchaser should never sell them to be killed.</p>

<p>The staff, entirely Indian, impressed me as being eager and
interested as to their work. Said the chief:</p>

<p>"If this place were merely commercial there would not be so many
non-commercial cattle here. We have to buy out of the slaughter
house; but where once we bought the poorest and cheapest, now we
have learned to buy the best. And besides, the idea of any sort of
commercial element, in a <i>gaushala,</i> is new to India. Up to
the present we have not put any private milkmen out of business, or
appreciably reduced the city's slaughter. But we hope to do so, in
the long run. On my staff here I have two or three Bachelors of
Agriculture--young men trained on the Government Breeding and Dairy
farms to understand cattle. And that you will never find in any
other <i>gaushala</i> or <i>pinjrapole</i> in all India. We, here,
believe in scientific care."</p>

<p>Looked at from the point of view of an American farmer, the
whole thing was too primitive to discuss. Looked at from the Indian
background, it was a shining light, and one felt almost guilty in
noticing that all the staff were cousins, nephews, or close
relatives of the superintendent.</p>

<p>But, it was a British-trained Indian in Government employ under
the direction of a British chief, who rescued this <i>gaushala.</i>
from a bad start, devised the present advanced scheme and pursuaded
the Association to adopt it.</p>

<p>Meantime, the Indian politicians, at home and abroad, curse "the
criminal negligence of the Government," [4] beat the air with
words, spurn agriculture and the agriculturalist, and, when
publicity dictates, send small contributions to the other kind of
<i>gaushala.</i></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXI - HOME OF STARK WANT</h2>

<p>One hears a great deal from the new Indian intelligentsia about
the glories of the "Golden Age"--a period in the shadowy past when
the land smiled with health and plenty, wisdom, beauty and peace
and when all went well with India. This happy natural condition was
done to death, one is given to understand, by the mephitic
influence of the present Government.</p>

<p>The argument for the Golden Age is wont to take typical forms,
such as this:</p>

<p>"You admit that the Emperor Chandragupta lived? And that he was
the man who fought Seleucus, who fought Alexander? Very well: In
Chandragupta's day a girl of fourteen, beautiful and loaded with
jewels, could walk abroad in perfect safety. And there was perfect
peace, no poverty, no famine, no plague. But Britain ruined our
Golden Age."</p>

<p>Or again, the accuser first paints a picture of an idyllic land,
distinguished by science, philosophy and pastoral grace, then
suddenly confronts his hearer with the challenge: "Can you show me,
in all India, any remnant of that life? No? Exactly. Then, if it
exists nowhere, does it not follow that Britain must have destroyed
it?"</p>

<p>But the period of Chandragupta, whatever its quality, was
removed from that of England's first acquisition of foothold in
India by over nineteen hundred years.[1] Chandragupta's dynasty
having disappeared into mists of legend out of which the one great
figure of Asoka dimly looms, the Scythians and the Turks rode
through the northern mountain passes, helped themselves to northern
India and set up their kingdoms there. And the native Hindu mass,
as years rolled by, merged its conquerors, both Scythian and Turk,
into its own body.</p>

<blockquote>[1. Chandragupta reigned B.C. 322-298.]</blockquote>

<p>The fourth and fifth centuries, A.D., comprised the great period
of Hindu art and history--the age of the Gupta Kings. Then again
the hand grew lax that held the northern passes; and again down out
of Central Asia poured wave after wave of wild humanity, this time
the terrible nomad White Huns, brothers to the forces of Attila.
Ravenous for the wealth of the land, they had watched the frontier
for their hour. When it struck, leaping through like a loosened
torrent, they swept the country bare of all that had been its
socia] fabric.</p>

<p>By the beginning of the sixth century the northern half of the
territory we call India had become one of the provinces of the
Huns. And the impact of successive Hun hordes, striking down
through the mountain barrier, had again so thoroughly wiped out the
past that no authentic family or clan tradition of today can go
behind that point.</p>

<p>The Huns, like the Scythians and the Turks before them, were
gradually absorbed in the native stock. Hinduism, for a time
disputed by Buddhism, regained possession of the land. Its
disintegrating tenets and its cumulative millions of terrifying
gods did their work. Henceforth, save during a few years in the
seventh century, no successful attempt was made, north or south, to
establish political unity or a permanent state, while forces of
disunion multiplied and grew strong.</p>

<p>The history of northern India from the middle of the seventh
century through the next five hundred years is a tangled web of the
warfare of little clans and states, constantly changing in size and
in number with the changing fortunes of battle and intrigue. Small
chiefs march and countermarch, raid, seize, annex, destroy, slay
and are slain, each jealous of each, each for himself alone,
embroiling the entire northern and central part of the country in
their constant feuds.</p>

<p>Meantime, peninsular India remained always a place apart,
untouched by the currents of the north and defended therefrom by
the buttress of her hills and jungles. Here lived the dark-skinned
aboriginals, Tamils, without infusion of Aryan blood, fighting
their own fights and worshiping the demons of their faith. And when
at last Hindu missionaries sallied south along the coast, these
recommended their creed, it would seem, by the familiar process of
adding the local demons to the number of their own gods.</p>

<p>The Tamils had developed a rich native art; and in one at least
of their many and ever-changing little kingdoms they had brought
forth an elaborate and interesting system of village government. By
the end of the twelfth century, however, this feature had utterly
perished, crushed out. And it is well to observe that, north or
south, a history made up of endless wars and changes of dynasty
developed no municipal institutions, no free cities, no republics,
no political consciousness in the people. Each region lay forever
prostrate, supine, under the heel of a despot who in his brief hour
did as he pleased with his human herds until some other despot
pulled him down to destruction.</p>

<p>For a rapid survey of the next era in India's history one cannot
do better than turn to Sir T. W. Holder-ness's <i>Peoples and
Problems of India:</i>[2]</p>

<blockquote>[2. Williams &amp; Norgate, London, 1920, pp.
48-50.]</blockquote>

<p class="quote">The first comers were Arabs, who founded dynasties
in Sind and Multan as early as [A.D.] 800...About [the year] 1000
the terror came. By that time the Tartar races had been brought
into the fold of Islam, and the Turks, the most capable of these
races, had started on the career which in the West ended in their
establishment at Constantinople...In 997, Mahmud [a Turkish
chieftain] descended upon India. His title, "the Idol-breaker,"
describes the man. Year by year he swept over the plains of India,
capturing cities and castles, throwing down idols and temples,
slaughtering the heathen and proclaiming the faith of Muhammad.
Each year he returned with vast spoils [to his home in
Afghanistan].<br>
<br>
For five hundred years, reckoning from A.D. 1000, successive hosts
of fierce and greedy Turks, Afghans and Mongols trod upon one
another's heels and fought for mastery in India. At the end of that
time, Babar the Turk founded in 1526 the Mughal Empire;
thenceforward for two hundred years the passes into India were
closed and in the keeping of his capable successors.</p>

<p>Says Holderness on another page:[3]</p>

<blockquote>[3. <i>Peoples and Problems of India,</i> p.
53.]</blockquote>

<p class="quote">The Mughal Empire...was of the ordinary type of
Asiatic despotisms. It was irresponsible personal government. For
India it meant the substitution of a new set of conquerors for
those already in occupation. But the new comers brought with them
the vigour of the north--they came from the plains of the Oxus
beyond the Kabul hills--and they drew an unlimited supply of
recruits from the finest fighting races of Asia. In physical
strength and hardihood they were like the Norsemen and Normans of
Europe.</p>

<p>To check the Islamic tide in its flood toward the south, a Hindu
power, known as the Empire of Vi-jayanagar, sprang up among the
Tamils. Its rulers built a gorgeous city and lived in unbounded
luxury. But here, as elsewhere all over India, the common people's
misery provided the kings' and nobles' wealth, and only their
abject submission made possible the existence of the state. Yet the
glories of the Hindu stronghold soon eclipsed. In the year 1565 one
blow of Muslim arms, delivered by the sultans of small surrounding
states, slaughtered its people and reduced the splendid city to a
heap of carven stones.</p>

<p>Yet the earlier of the great Mughal Emperors tolerated the old
religion. Their chief exponent, Akbar, even married a native lady,
and admitted Rajput chiefs and Brahman scholars to place and posts.
But the Mug-hals administered always as conqueror strangers; and
though they made use of the talents or learning of individuals
among the Hindus, they took care constantly to strengthen the
Muslim hand from their own trans-montane source.</p>

<p>Then, in 1659, the Emperor Aurangzeb again brought to the Mughal
throne an Islamism that would not countenance the idolatry of the
Hindu mass. His heavy hand, destroying temples and images, broke
the Rajput's fealty and roused the Hindu low-caste peasantry of the
Deccan--the Mahrattas--in common wrath. So that when Aurangzeb, in
his ambition for more power, more wealth, attacked even the little
Mu-hammadan kings of the Deccan, the Mahrattas rose up as guerilla
bands, and, under cover of the general embroilment, robbed, slew
and destroyed on their own account, wasting the land. A
half-century of Aurang-zeb's disjointing rule so weakened the
Mughal Empire that, at his death, it fell asunder, leaving the
Mahratta hordes, now trained in raids and killings under their
bandit chiefs, to play a brief r&ocirc;le as the strong hand in
India.</p>

<p>Then again happened the historic inevitable, as happen it will
whenever the guard of the north is down. The Mughal Empire fallen,
the door open to Central Asia, Central Asia poured in. First came
the Persian, then the fierce Afghan, who, in a final battle
delivered in 1761, drove the Mahrattas with wholesale slaughter
back to their Deccan hills.</p>

<p>Now, in the scanty official records of all these troubled
centuries, little indeed is said of the common people. The
histories are histories of little kings and tribal chiefs, their
personal lives, ambitions, riches, intrigues, fights and downfalls.
Such glimpses as appear, however, show the populace generally as
the unconsidered victims of their master's greed, be that master
Hindu or Muhammadan. Hungry, naked, poverty-stricken, constantly
overridden by undisciplined mobs of soldiers, bled of their scanty
produce, swept by exterminating famines and epidemics, our clearest
knowledge of them comes from the chronicles of strangers who from
time to time visited the country.</p>

<p>Many western travelers--French, Dutch, Portuguese, Spanish--have
left records of the country, north and south, as it was during and
after Akbar's day. All agree in the main points.</p>

<p>The poor, they say, were everywhere desperately poor, the rich
forever insecure in their riches. Between common robbers and the
levies of the throne, no man dared count on the morrow. The Hindu
peoples constituted the prostrate masses. The nobles and governing
officials, few in numbers, were almost all foreigners, whether
Turks or Persians. Their luxury and ostentation arose, on the one
hand, from an insatiable hunger for sensual pleasure, and, on the
other, from the necessity not to be outshone at court. All places
and favors were bought by costly bribes, and the extravagance of
life was increased by the fact that, in northern India at least,
whatever a rich man possessed at the time of his death reverted to
the royal treasury.</p>

<p>To acquire means to keep up their gorgeous state the officials,
from the pro-consuls down, had but one method--to squeeze the
peasantry. They squeezed.</p>

<p>In Madras, wrote van Linschoten, who saw the country in the
decade between 1580 to 1590, the peasants [4]</p>

<blockquote>[4. <i>The Voyage of John Huyghen van Linschoten to the
East Indies,</i> edited for the Hakluyt Society,
1884.]</blockquote>

<p class="quote">...are so miserable that for a penny they would
endure to be whipped, and they eat so little that it seemeth they
live by the air; they are likewise most of them small and weak of
limbs.</p>

<p>When the rains failed, they fell into still deeper distress,
wandered like wild animals in vain search of food and sold their
children for "less than a rupee apiece," while the slave-market was
abundantly recruited from those who sold their own bodies to escape
starvation, of which cannibalism, an ordinary feature of famine,
was the alternative.</p>

<p>The B&aacute;dsh&aacute;h N&aacute;mah of 'Abd Ai Ham&iuml;d
L&aacute;hawri bears witness that in the Deccan during the famine
of 1631, "pounded bones of the dead were mixed with flour and
sold...Destitution at length reached such a pitch that men began to
devour each other and the flesh of a son was preferred to his love.
The number of the dying caused obstruction in the roads." The Dutch
East India Company's representative, in the same year, recorded
that in Surat the dearth was so great that "menschen en vee van
honger sturven...moeders tegen natuer haere kinderkens wt
hongers-noot op gegeten hebben." Two years later Christopher Read
reported to the British East India Company that Mesulapatam and
Armagon were "sorely oppressed with famine, the liveinge eating up
the dead and men durst scarcely travel in the country for feare
they should be kild and eaten." And Peter Mundy wrote from Gujerat
during the same period that "the famine it selfe swept away more
than a million of the Comon or poorer Sort. After which, the
mortallitie succeeding did as much more among rich and poore.
Weomen were scene to rost their Children...A man or woman noe
sooner dead but they were Cutt in pieces to be eaten." These
testimonies will be found, and at greater length, in the text and
Appendix of the Hakluyt Society's edition of the <i>Travels of
Peter Mundy,</i> Other old chronicles corroborate them.</p>

<p>Slaves cost practically nothing to keep and were therefore
numerous in each noble's household, where their little value
insured their wretched state. The elephants of the nobles wore
trappings of silver and gold, while "the people," says the
contemporaneous observer, de Laet,[5] "have not sufficient covering
to keep warm in winter."</p>

<blockquote>[5. <i>De Imperio Magni Mogolis,</i> J. de Laet,
Leyden, 1631.]</blockquote>

<p>Merchants, if prosperous, dared not live comfortably, dared not
eat good food, and buried their silver deep under ground; for the
smallest show of means brought the torturers to wring from them the
hiding-place of their wealth.</p>

<p>The village masses constituted practically the only productive
element in the land. All their production, save their bare
subsistence, was absorbed by the State. As to its redistribution,
that took a single route, into the pockets of the extremely small
body of foreigners constituting the ruling class. None of it
returned to the people. No communal benefits existed.</p>

<p>A very few bridges and such roads as are made by the plodding of
bullocks' feet through dust and mud comprised the communication
lines of the land. No system of popular education or of medical
relief wa? worked, and none of legal defense. Fine schemes were
sometimes set on paper by rulers and their ministers, but
practically nothing was actually done toward the economic
development of the country; for if any one ruler began a work, his
successor destroyed it or let it decay.[6]</p>

<blockquote>[6. <i>India at the Death of Akbar,</i> by W. H.
Moreland, Macmillan &amp; Co., London, 1920, gives an elaborate and
heavily documented digest of contemporaneous authority on this
general subject.]</blockquote>

<p>Fifteen years after the death of Akbar, or in the year 1620, the
Hollander, Francisco Pelsaert, began that seven years' residence in
India of which he left so valuable and so curious a record. In the
course of his narrative Pelsaert writes:[7]</p>

<blockquote>[7. <i>The Remonstrantie of Francisco Pelsaert,</i>
translated from the Dutch by W. H. Moreland and P. Geyl Heffers,
Cambridge, 1925, pp. 47-59.]</blockquote>

<p class="quote">The land would give a plentiful, or even an
extraordinary yield, if the peasants were not so cruelly and
pitilessly oppressed; for villages which, owing to some small
shortage of produce, are unable to pay the full amount of the
revenue-farm, are made prize, so to speak, by their masters or
governors, and wives and children sold on pretext of a charge of
rebellion. Some peasants abscond to escape their tyranny...and
consequently the fields lie empty and unsown and grow into
wildernesses.<br>
<br>
...As regards the laws, they are scarcely observed at all, for the
administration is absolutely autocratic...Their laws contain such
provisions as hand for hand, eye for eye, tooth for tooth; but who
will ex-communicate the Pope? And who would dare to ask a Governor
"Why do you rule us this way or that? Our Law orders thus."...In
every city there is a...royal court of Justice...[but] one must
indeed be sorry for the man who has to come to judgment before
these godless "un-judges"; their eyes are bleared with greed, their
mouths gape like wolves for covetousness, and their bellies hunger
for the bread of the poor; every one stands with hands open to
receive, for no mercy or compassion can be had except on payment of
cash. This fault should not be attributed to judges or officers
alone, for the evil is a universal plague; from the least to the
greatest, right up to the King himself, every one is infected with
insatiable greed.<br>
<br>
...It is important to recognise that [the King, Jahangir] is to be
regarded as king of the plains or the open roads only; for in many
places you can travel only with a strong body of men, or on payment
of heavy tolls to rebels...[and] there are nearly as many rebels as
subjects. Taking the chief cities, for example, at Surat the forces
of Raja Piepel come pillaging up to, or inside the city, murdering
the people and burning: the villages, and in the same way, near
Ahmedabad, Burhanpur, Agra, Delhi, Lahore, and many other cities,
thieves and robbers come in force by night or day like open
enemies. The Governors are usually bribed by the thieves to remain
inactive, for avarice dominates manly honour, and, instead of
maintaining troops, they fill and adorn their <i>mahals</i> with
beautiful women, and seem to have the pleasure-house of the whole
world within their walls.</p>

<p>The observant Dutchman[8] repeatedly dwells on the disastrous
contrast between</p>

<p class="quote">the manner of life of the rich in their great
superfluity and absolute power, and the utter subjection and
poverty of the common people--poverty so great and miserable that
the life of the people can be depicted...only as the home of stark
want and the dwelling-place of bitter woe.</p>

<blockquote>[8. <i>The Remonstrantie of Francisco Pelsaert,</i> p.
60.]</blockquote>

<p>Nevertheless, he says, having discovered the numbing influence
of the doctrines of fate and caste:[9]</p>

<blockquote>[9. Ibid.]</blockquote>

<p class="quote">The people endure patiently, professing that they
do not deserve anything better; and scarcely any one will make an
effort, for a ladder by which to climb higher is hard to find,
because a workman's children can follow no occupation other than
that of their father, nor can they inter-marry with other
castes...For the workman there are two scourges, the first of which
is low wages...The second is [the oppression by] the Governor, the
nobles, the Diwan...and other royal officers. If any of these wants
a workman, the man is not asked if he is willing to come, but is
seized in the house or in the street, well beaten if he should dare
to raise any objection, and in the evening paid half his wages or
nothing at all.</p>

<p>Forty years after Pelsaert's departure from India came a French
traveler, Fran&ccedil;ois Bernier. His stay covered the period from
1656 to 1668. His chronicle perfectly agrees with that of other
foreign visitors, and gives a vivid picture of men, women and
things as he found them in the reigns of Shahjahan and
Aurangzeb--the climax of the Mughal Empire. Speaking on the subject
of land-tenure and taxation, this observer writes:[10]</p>

<blockquote>[10. <i>Travels in the Mogul Empire,</i>
Fran&ccedil;ois Bernier, Oxford University Press, 1916, p.
224.]</blockquote>

<p class="quote">The King, as proprietor of the land, makes over a
certain quantity to military men, as an equivalent for their
pay...Similar grants are made to governors, in lieu of their
salary, and also for the support of their troops, on condition that
they pay a certain sum annually to the King...The lands not so
granted are retained by the King as the peculiar domains of his
house...and upon these domains he keeps contractors, who are also
bound to pay him an annual rent.</p>

<p>Bengal, he thinks probably "the finest and most fruitful country
in the world." But of the other regions he writes:[11]</p>

<blockquote>[11. <i>Ibid.,</i> pp. 226-7, 230.]</blockquote>

<p class="quote">As the ground is seldom tilled otherwise than by
compulsion, and as no person is found willing and able to repair
the ditches and canals for the conveyance of water, it happens that
the whole country is badly cultivated, and a great part rendered
unproductive from the want of irrigation&raquo;...The peasant
cannot avoid asking himself this question: "Why should I toil for a
tyrant who may come tomorrow and lay his rapacious hands upon all I
possess and value?"...The Governors and revenue contractors, on
their part reason in this manner: "Why should the neglected state
of this land create uneasiness in our minds? and why should we
expend our own money and time to render it fruitful? We may be
deprived of it in a single moment and our exertion would benefit
neither ourselves nor our children. Let us draw from the soil all
the money we can, though the peasant should starve or abscond, and
we should leave it, when commanded to quit, a dreary
wilderness."...It is owing to this miserable system of
government...that there is no city or town which, if it be not
already ruined and deserted, does not bear evident marks of
approaching decay.<br>
<br>
The country is ruined by the necessity of defraying the enormous
charges required to maintain the splendour of a numerous court, and
to pay a large army maintained for the purpose of keeping the
people in subjection.</p>

<p>Now, to touch as briefly as possible on the history of European
powers in India: At the time of Akbar's accession--1556--the
Portuguese were already rooted and fortified on the western coast
of the Peninsula, at Goa, which, with its environing territory,
they had taken from the Muhammadan kinglets of the Deccan. Thence
they controlled the merchant traffic of the Arabian Sea and the
Persian Gulf. No other European power had yet secured a base in the
land, and no Englishman had yet set foot on the soil of
India.[12]</p>

<p>The Portuguese hand in India soon weakened, on lines of
debauchery and cruelty. Thus came the decay that, in the early
sixteen hundreds, let fall all the Portuguese settlements, save
only Goa itself, into the hands of the Dutch.</p>

<p>Dutch and English merchants, at that period, were equally keen
for the trade of the East. The Dutchmen's main interest, however,
lying with Java and the Spice Islands, their English rivals soon
stood in India practically alone.</p>

<p>British merchant adventurers, by charter and concessions granted
by Queen Elizabeth and by the Mug-hal Emperor, now from time to
time established trading stations along the West coast. Their post
in the Bay of Bengal antedated by five years the settlement of
Boston by the Puritans. Nine years later the first English
proprietary holding in India was secured, by agreement between the
local Hindu ruler and the "Governor and Company of Merchants of
London, Trading with the East Indies." By this treaty the latter
were allowed to rent and fortify as a trading post a bit of rough
shoreland now the site of the city of Madras. Here, presently, was
to come Elihu Yale, once of Boston in Massachusetts, as Governor in
the Company's behalf. Here was earned the means to benefit the
Connecticut University that bears his name today. And here, in the
old house where British Governors of Madras still dwell, hangs
Elihu Yale's portrait, looking placidly out upon the scene of his
labors.</p>

<p>French merchants, they also desirous of the trade of India,
during the latter half of the seventeenth century secured several
small <i>points d'appui</i> along the southern coasts. Their
commerce never equaled that of the English; but their aspirations
and the national clashes in Europe alike led them into a series of
anti-English intrigues with small Indian rulers, resulting in
hostilities of varying result. So that while the English colonists
of New England and New York, with the aid of Indian allies, were
fighting "French and Indian Wars" for control of the future,
English colonists on the other side of the world, with the aid of
Indian allies, were fighting French and Indian wars for the same
purpose. And with a comparable outcome.[13]</p>

<blockquote>[13. As Americans we may here draw our critics' shot by
admitting that while we have done much to exterminate our Indians
and only in 1924 granted them citizenship though retaining
guardianship over them (United States v. Nice, 241 U. S. 598,
1916), our British cousins have multiplied theirs, and have led
them into a large and increasing measure of
self-government.]</blockquote>

<p>The struggle which began, openly, in 1746, when the French took
Madras, came to its close in 1761, when the French unconditionally
surrendered Pondi-cherry, their own headquarters, thus ending their
effective career in India.</p>

<p>Until well into the eighteenth century, English holdings in
India were limited to a few square miles in Madras, in the Island
of Bombay, and at three or four other points; during this period
the English representatives in India occupied themselves with trade
alone, taking no hand in local wars or politics. But with the death
of the Emperor Aurangzeb, the collapse of the Mughal Empire, and
the chaos of freebooting wars that then broke over the land, the
Company set up for the protection of its settlements a force of
European troops, supplemented by Indian auxiliaries.</p>

<p>Thenceforward it grew toward the status of a governing
corporation. In 1784 the British Government, by Act of Parliament,
assumed a degree of control over the Company's procedure. With such
authority behind it, the Company could enlarge its activities and
proceed toward establishing peace in a country teeming with
anarchy.</p>

<p>This meant reducing to order a host of robber gangs, of
marauding chieftains, of captains of the old Mughai r&eacute;gime
now out of a job and swarming like migrating bees looking for new
kingdoms and new plunder. It also meant dissuading small reigning
princes from their hereditary vocation of enlisting gangs of
mercenaries and campaigning against their neighbors. And if these
movements, which the princes themselves often requested, usually
resulted in annexing more territory to the sphere of British
influence or control, they also brought an increasing semblance of
unity to the country.</p>

<p>Once the work of pacification was well in hand, began the
attempt to build up civil institutions and public privileges and to
introduce law, justice and order, a thousand years and more unknown
in the land. The Company was still a trading company, with a
trader's chief preoccupation. But it accepted the responsibility
for the people's welfare implied in the authority it now held.</p>

<p>A human enterprise covering two centuries of human progress, the
name of the East India Company was sometimes dimmed by mistaken
judgment or by unfit agents. Some of these were overbearing, some
tactless, some wavering, one or two were base and a few succumbed
to the temptation to graft. Of their defects, however, not a little
nonsense is spun.</p>

<p>The Company, on the whole, was honored in the quality of its
officers. As time passed, a more sensitive public conscience at
home made it increasingly alive to critical observation. Its
affairs were reviewed by Parliament. And, with the general rise in
world-standards, rose its standards of administration. Its
inclusive achievement was courageous, arduous and essential towards
the redemption of the country. Whatever its faults, it cleared and
broke the ground for progress. And it lighted the first ray of hope
that had ever dawned for the wretched masses of the Indian
peoples.</p>

<p>The abolition of ancient indigenous horrors, such as the
flourishing trade of the professional strangler tribes, the Thugs;
the burning alive of widows; the burying alive of lepers, lie to
the credit of the Company. And no briefest summary of the
epoch-making elements of its concerns could be forgiven a failure
to cite the gist of Section 87 of the Parliamentary Act of 1784,
which reads:</p>

<p class="quote">No native of the said territories, nor any
natural-born subject of His Majesty resident therein, shall, by
reason only of his religion, place of birth, descent, colour,
<b>or</b> any of them, be disabled from holding any place, office
or employment under the Company.</p>

<p>A bomb, indeed, to drop into caste-fettered, feud-filled,
tyrant-crushed India! Nor was this shock of free western ideas
without its definitely unsettling influence. The Sikh Rebellion in
1845, the Indian Mutiny in 1857, were in no small degree direct
fruits of that influence. And with the conclusion of the latter
England felt that the time had come to do away with the awkward
Company-Parliament form of government, to end the control of a
great territory by commercial interest, however safeguarded, and to
bring the administration of India directly under the Crown.</p>

<p>In the year 1858 this step was taken. Shabby, threadbare, sick
and poor, old Mother India stood at last on the brink of another
world and turned blind eyes toward the strange new flag above her
head. It carried then, as it carries today, a pledge that is, to
her, incredible. How can she, the victim and slave of all recorded
time, either hope or believe that her latest master brings her the
gift of constructive service, democracy and the weal of the common
people? <a name="ch-22" id="ch-22"></a></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXII - THE REFORMS</h2>

<p>The roots of the form of government now gradually working out in
British India ramify into past centuries and are visible through
continuous growth. For the purpose of this book they may be passed
over, to reach the briefest outline of the present evolutionary
phase.</p>

<p>The supreme power over India, today, is the people of Great
Britain represented by the British Crown and Parliament, acting
through the Secretary of State in Council of India, sitting in
India Office, in London. The supreme government in India is that of
the Gov-ernor-General-in-Council, commonly called the Government of
India. The Governor-General, or Viceroy, is appointed by the Crown.
His Council, similarly appointed, consists of seven Departmental
heads--the Commander-in-Chief of the Forces, the Home Member, the
Finance Member, the Member for Railways and Commerce, and the
Members for Education, Health and Lands, for Industries and Labor,
and for Law. Of this cabinet of seven members the three last named
are Indians.</p>

<p>Next in the structure of the Central Government comes the
"Indian Legislature," with its Upper Chamber or "Council of State,"
and its Lower Chamber or "Legislative Assembly."</p>

<p>The Council of State comprises sixty members, of whom
thirty-four are elected, while twenty-six, of whom not over twenty
may be government officials, are nominated by the Viceroy.</p>

<p>The Legislative Assembly consists of one hundred and forty-four
members, of whom one hundred and three are elected. Of the
remaining forty-one, all nominated by the Viceroy, twenty-six must
be members of Government, while the rest are named to represent the
minor interests in the country, as, the Christian Indian
population, etc. Both chambers are heavily Indian, and both are
constituted with a view to due representation of the several
provinces into which, for purposes of administration, the country
is divided.</p>

<p>British India is thus divided into fifteen provinces, each with
its separate administration. Of the nine major divisions--Madras,
Bengal, and Bombay Presidencies, the United Provinces, the Punjab,
Behar and Orissa, the Central Provinces, Burma, and Assam--each is
controlled by a Governor with his Executive Council. These act in
conjunction with a Provincial Legislative Council, a legislature of
which 70 per cent, (in Burma, 60 per cent.) at least must be
elected by the people.</p>

<p>The electorate is intended to give fairly balanced separate
representation to the various races, communities and special
interests. The scale varies from province to province, with varying
local conditions. In Madras, for example, it stands as follows:</p>

<pre>
<i>Number of Members Returned</i>

<i>Class of Constituency</i>

Non-Muhammadans (meaning
Hindus, Jains, Buddhists, etc.) 65

Muhammadans                     13

Indian Christian                 5

Europeans (including British)    1

Anglo-Indian                     1

Landholders [zemindars]          6

University                       1

Commerce Industry                6
</pre>

<p>The qualifications for voters also varies in the several
provinces. In general, however, the franchise rests on a minimum
property qualification. The law, thus far, has given the vote to
some seven-and-a-half million persons[1] and has conferred upon all
the major provinces the right to enfranchise their women.[2]</p>

<blockquote>[1.<i>The India Office,</i> Sir Malcolm C. C. Seton,
Putnam, London, 1926, p. 59.]</blockquote>

<blockquote>[2. See Appendix <a href=
"#app-II">II</a>.]</blockquote>

<p>The effort to decentralize--to magnify the responsibilities of
provincial governments for the purpose of training and stimulating
Indians to handle their own affairs, stands out preeminent in the
present scheme. In part and as applied to the nine major divisions,
this makes of the provincial government a two-branched machine
operated from the office of the Governor. The Governor and his
Executive Council, all Crown appointees, form one branch. Council
membership is commonly divided between British and Indians. The
Governor and his Ministers of Departments form the second branch.
These are appointed by the Governor from the elected members of the
legislature and are themselves responsible to that body. All
ministers are Indian. Between the two branches the various
functions of government formerly handled by a single arm are now
divided, under the heads of "reserved" and "transferred"
subjects.</p>

<p>Reserved subjects, save for the ultimate power of the Central
Government, lie in the hands of the Provincial Governor in Council.
Transferred subjects are assigned to the provincial legislatures,
and are operated by the Ministers.</p>

<p>The list of transferred subjects represents authority resigned
by the British people in favor of the peoples of India. The
intention of the plan is, if the experiment succeeds, to enlarge
the list of subjects transferred. On the other hand, where the
Ministerial machine fails to work, Governors-in-Council may resume
control of a subject already transferred. Transferred subjects at
present comprise Education, Public Health, Management of Public
Works other than irrigation and railways, Development of
Industries, Excise, Agriculture, Local Self-government and others.
Reserved subjects include Maintenance of Law and Order, Defense of
India, Finance, the Land Revenue system, etc.</p>

<p>Of the provincial legislatures, known as Legislative Councils, a
recent authority[3] says:</p>

<blockquote>[3. <i>The India Office,</i> pp. 59-60.]</blockquote>

<p class="quote">The Councils have very wide powers of legislation
and the annual provincial budgets are submitted to them. In
Transferred subjects they possess the power of the purse, but the
Governor may restore grants for purposes of the Reserved side of
the administration if he considers it essential to the discharge of
his responsibility that money refused by the Council should be
provided. He can disallow an Act or reserve it for the
Governor-General's consideration, and has the exceptional right to
enact on his own authority a measure (provided that it deals with a
Reserved subject only) the passage of which he certifies to be
essential to the discharge of his responsibility. This special
power has hitherto been exercised only once.</p>

<p>Turning from provincial legislatures to that of the Central
Government, the same authority summarizes:[4]</p>

<blockquote>[4. <i>Ibid.,</i> pp. 60-2.]</blockquote>

<p class="quote">The Indian legislature, subject to the
preservation of the powers of Parliament, has power to make laws
"for all persons, for all courts, and for all places and things,
within British India," for British officials and subjects in Indian
States, for "native Indian subjects of His Majesty" beyond British
India, and for officers, soldiers and followers of the Indian Army
wherever serving. But it requires the sanction of the
Governor-General for the introduction of measures affecting the
public debt or revenues, religion, military discipline, foreign
relations, or for measures treating on matters relegated to
provincial governments...<br>
<br>
The power of the purse has been very largely entrusted to the
Legislative Assembly...The annual budget is laid before both
Chambers, and the consent of the Legislative Assembly is sought for
the grants required on most matters, though certain heads of
expenditure are classed as "non&raquo; valable."</p>

<p>The Viceroy and the Crown hold the power of veto; and the former
may enact a bill into law, subject to disallowance by the Crown,
without the consent of either Chamber. An emergency measure, such a
step would be taken only in extreme cases.</p>

<p>It will scarcely be necessary, in this place, to go further into
the machinery of the present government of British India.</p>

<p>Commonly known as "Dyarchy," or "The Reforms," it is in essence
no new thing, but merely an accelerated unfolding of the original
British theme whose <i>motif</i> is the drawing of Indians into
responsible participation in Government. India's outburst of
loyalty in the World War, her whole-hearted contribution of men and
means from every province and state save Bengal, prompted a
responsive flood of feeling in Britain and a desire to requite one
demonstration of confidence and sympathy with another in kind. But
Parliament was, in reality, only re-phrasing the original principle
embodied in the Proclamation of Queen Victoria in 1858, was only
pursuing the line of the Indian Councils Act of 1909, when, in the
Preamble of the Act of 1919, the Act now functioning, it declared
its policy[5]</p>

<blockquote>[5. Cf. pp. 193-4 and 287, <i>ante.</i>]</blockquote>

<p class="quote">...to provide for the increasing association of
Indians in every branch of Indian Administration, and for the
gradual development of self-governing institutions, with a view to
the progressive realisation of responsible government in British
India as an integral part of the empire.</p>

<p>The scheme in its shape of today has not the stability of the
slow-growing oak, root for branch, balanced and anchored. Rather,
it is a hothouse exotic, weedy, a stranger in its soil, forced
forward beyond its inherent strength by the heat of a generous and
hasty emotion. An outsider sitting today through sessions of Indian
legislatures, Central or Provincial, somehow comes to feel like one
observing a roomful of small and rather mischievous children who by
accident have got hold of a magnificent watch. They fight and
scramble to thrust their fingers into it, to pull off a wheel or
two, to play with the mainspring; to pick out the jewels. They have
no apparent understanding of the worth of the mechanism, still less
of the value of time. And when the teacher tries to explain to them
how to wind their toy up, they shriek and grimace in fretful
impatience and stuff their butterscotch into the works.</p>

<p>As to the relation of these people to their supposed job, its
most conspicuous quality, today, is its artificiality. Adepts in
the phraseology of democratic representation, they are, in fact,
profoundly innocent of the thought behind the phrase. Despotisms
induce no growth of civic spirit, and the peoples of India, up to
the coming of Britain, had known no rule but that of despots.
Britain, by her educational effort, has gradually raised up an
element before unknown in India--a middle class. But this middle
class--these lawyers and professional men--are in the main as much
dominated today as were their ancestors five hundred years ago by
the law of caste and of transmigration--com-pletest denial of
democracy. They talk of "the people" simply because the word bulks
large in the vocabulary of that western-born representative
government which they now essay.</p>

<p>A village headman knows and feels infinitely more than do these
elected "representatives" as to the duties and responsibilities of
government. An Indian prince has the inherited habit of ruling,
and, whatever his failings, whatever his purpose, keeps his people
somewhere in mind. And an American unconscious of his own civic
debt to his spiritual or blood-lineal ancestors, from Plymouth Rock
to Runnymede, may be brought to a wholesome state of humility by a
few days' watching of the anchorless legislators of India.</p>

<p>Off and on, during the winter session of 1926, in Delhi, I
listened to Assembly debates. Hour after hour, day after day, the
Swarajist bench spent their energies in sterile, obstructionist
tactics, while for the most part the rest of the House sat
apathetic save for an occasional expression of weary contempt from
some plain fighting man out of the north. Little or nothing
constructive emanated from party benches. The simplest piece of
essential legislation proposed by Government evoked from the
Swarajist orators fantastic interpretations as to sinister intent.
The gravest concerns elicited from them only a bedlam of frivolous
and abusive chatter. "We do not trust you," they would repeat in
effect; "we know your motives are bad." "We believe nothing good of
your thrice-damned alien government." And, coming down to specific
arraignments, they could solemnly produce such theories as that the
Supreme Court of the United States obeys, in its decisions, the
will of the British Crown.[6]</p>

<blockquote>[6. <i>Legislative Assembly Debates,</i> Vol. VII, p.
278.]</blockquote>

<p>Patient, unruffled, always courteous, the Government members
answered back. Not once was there a sign of irritation or annoyance
or fatigue, much less of despair of the situation thrust upon
them.</p>

<p>One day I took up this subject with one of the most notable
members of the Assembly, an Indian of superior abilities, whose
dislike of Britain is probably as sincere as that of any of those
who attack her on this floor.</p>

<p>"Your fellow-legislators of the opposition make terrible
accusations against the good faith of Government," I said. "They
impugn its honesty; they accuse it of trying to set Hindus and
Muhammadans by the ears, on the principle of 'divide and rule';
they allege that it tramples Indian interests under foot, that it
treats Indians themselves with disrespect, and that it sucks or
cripples the resources of the country for its own selfish
interests."</p>

<p>"Yes," he replied, "they say all that, and more."</p>

<p>"Do they mean it?" I asked.</p>

<p>"How could they?" he replied. "Not a man in the House believes
anything of the sort."</p>

<p>To an American having America's Philippine experience fresh in
mind, this repetition of history was infinitely saddening. One
remembered the words of the King-Emperor's Message to the Indian
Legislature and Councils at the opening of the first Sessions held
under the Reforms Act:</p>

<p class="quote">On you, the first representatives of the people on
the new Councils, there rests a very special responsibility. For on
you it lies, by the conduct of your business and the justice of
your judgment to convince the world of the wisdom of this great
constitutional change. But on you it also lies to remember the many
millions of your fellow-countrymen who are not yet qualified for a
share in political life, to work for their uplift-ment and to
cherish their interests as your own.</p>

<p>What meaning had such language in the ears of those to whom it
was addressed? What relation did they feel, between themselves and
poor old Mother India? What duty toward their own cause, to exhibit
capacity and thereby to command further concessions?</p>

<p>The history of British administration of India shows that
reactionary disorders follow attempts at speeded progress. The East
resents being hustled, even in reforms. It was perhaps specially
unfortunate for "Dyarchy" that its birthday should fall in the
season of Mr. Gandhi's ill-starred adventure into politics, when he
could turn upon it the full fire of his non-cooperative guns. His
influence in Bengal and the Central Provinces was enough at the
time to stop the experiment completely, and although that influence
has now everywhere lapsed into negligibility as a political factor,
its crippling and embittering after-effects still drag upon the
wheels of progress.</p>

<p>Without presuming to offer a criticism of the Reforms Act, it
would seem that its chief obstacle lies deeper in the roots of
things than any enmity can reach. The whole structure of the
Reforms is planned to rest on the foundation of a general
electorate which, through its directly elected legislators,
controls in each province the Ministers who handle the people's
affairs. And the difficulty is that while the structure hangs
waiting in midair, the foundation designed to sustain it yet
lingers in the blue-print stage--does not in fact exist. India has
no electorate, in any workable sense of the word, nor can have on
the present basis for many generations to come. And of this
statement the natural complement is also true: India's elected
representatives are as yet profoundly unaware of the nature of the
duties incumbent upon their office.</p>

<p>Reasons for the non-existence of an electorate will have been
gathered in the foregoing pages of this book. One of the chief
among them is, that while less than 8 per cent, of the peoples can
read at all, that literate fraction is concentrated almost entirely
in the large towns and cities, leaving the great masses spread over
the great spaces of the land, unreached and un-reachable by the
printed word.</p>

<p>This illiterate peasantry, these illiterate landholders, have no
access to and no interest in the political game, nor in any horizon
beyond that which daily meets their physical eyes. The town
politician, the legislator actual or aspirant, rarely comes near
them unless it be at election time or, as in the period of the
"non-violence" agitations, to stir them with some report of evil to
rise in blind revolt. When, recently, Swarajist members of the
legislative councils decided to try to block the wheels of
government by walking out, not one of them, as far as I was able to
learn, took the previous step of consulting his constituents. The
constituency is as yet too gauzy a figment, too abstract a theory,
too non-oriental a conception, to figure as an influence in their
minds.</p>

<p>No one who has studied the course of events in the Central and
Provincial governments during the last six years can escape the
conclusion that the British government officials charged with
administering the new law have striven with honesty, sincerity and
devotion, to make it a success. They work against great
difficulties, straining their faith and power and patience to
bridge wide voids of experience and development. Their success
sometimes seems dim and slight. But one of the finest executives of
them all used, in my hearing, these words:</p>

<p>"I would ask only this: 'Leave us alone. Don't always be
resurveying, reinvestigating, pulling up the plant to look at its
root. Each year that we get through is a gain, one year more of
peace for the people, of public works protected and advanced, of
justice given. The longer we can go on, now, without any great
storm, the better the chance of Councils and Ministers discovering
that when we oppose them it is in obedience to our conception of a
law higher than that of personal ambition or clan advantage.'"</p>

<p>In the last clause of the paragraph just quoted lies half hidden
one of the greatest stumbling-blocks in the way to sympathy and
just judgment between India and the West. To us it seems radically
obvious that personal advantage and nepotism, as motives of the
acts of public officials, can but mean, the world over, shame and
disgrace. Therefore the suggestion that Indians find difficulty in
sharing that view carries, to our ears, the taint of moral
snobbery; and so we search our own minds for other explanations of
certain phenomena that follow India's autonomization of
Government.</p>

<p>But we should be fairer to the Indian as well as wiser ourselves
if we looked in his mind, rather than in ours, for light on causes.
Then we should see that no white man in office ever labors under
such a handicap as does the average Indian official, or ever is so
largely foredoomed to defeat, in effort toward disinterested public
service.</p>

<p>With the Hindu comes, first, the ancient religious law of the
family-clan; because of this system the public office-holder who
fails to feather the nest of his kin will be branded by all his
world not only a fool but a renegade, and will find neither peace
at home nor honor abroad. No public opinion sustains him.</p>

<p>Second, beyond the family line comes the circle of caste. The
Hindu office-holder who should forget his caste's interests for
interests lying outside that circle would bring down upon his head
the opprobrium, perhaps the discipline, of his orthodox fellow
caste men. And this, be it remembered, means not only temporal
discomfort, but also dire penalties inflicted upon his soul,
determining the miseries of future incarnations.</p>

<p>Third, the political struggle between Hindu and Muslim, as will
be seen in later chapters, brings tremendous pressure to bear upon
the official from either camp, practically compelling him to
dispense such patronage as he enjoys among his co-religionists
only.</p>

<p>With these points in mind, one views with more charity and
understanding the breakdown of allegiance to western ideals that
generally occurs in even the staunchest of Indian public officials
when the British superior officer who has backed him through thick
and thin in free work for general good, is replaced by an Indian,
himself subject to the ancient code.</p>

<p>It is stiff work to maintain, alone and accursed, an alien
standard among one's own people.</p>

<p>Yet with all its increased expense and diminished efficiency,
the new constitution is, somehow, turning the wheels. Taking the
shorter view, it has improved the position of Indians in the
services. It has opened to them the height of office along many
lines. It has made Government more directly responsive to the
sentiment of vocal India, to such an extent indeed that the
onlooker is tempted to wonder whether Government's sense of
proportion is not impaired, whether it has not been nervously
stifling its conscience to save its ears, whether it is not paying
more attention to the spoiled baby's shrieks for the matches than
it is to the vital concerns of its whole big, dumb, helpless and
infinitely needy family.</p>

<p>A "hard-headed American" long resident in India, himself a
person of excellent standing, told me this incident:</p>

<p>One of the principal Swaraj politicians had just delivered
himself of a ferocious public diatribe against the Viceroy.</p>

<p>"Now tell me, Pundit," said the American, privately, "how can
you shout like that in view of the fact that only a few weeks ago
this very Vicero) went far out of his way to be courteous and
accommodating to you and to get you what you wanted?"</p>

<p>"How can I shout like that?" laughed the Indian. "Why shouldn't
I shout? Of course I shout, when every time I shout he gives me
something."</p>

<p>Thus in taking information from the Indian, at home or abroad, a
vital preliminary step is to appreciate and keep always in mind the
definition and value that he assigns to "truth."</p>

<p>The Indian may be a devoted "seeker after truth" in the sense of
metaphysical speculation; he may be of a splendid candor in dealing
with most parts of most subjects of which you speak together. And
yet he may from time to time embed in the midst of his frank speech
statements easily susceptible of proof and totally at variance with
the facts.</p>

<p>Having repeatedly come across this trait, I took it up for
examination with a distinguished Bengali, one of the most
broad-minded of Indian public men. Said he:</p>

<p>"Our <i>Mahabharata</i> preaches truth above all. If we have
deviated it is because of the adverse circumstances under which we
long lived. If we lie it is because we are afraid to face the
consequences."</p>

<p>Then I laid it before a great mystic, spiritual teacher of
multitudes, who had favored me with a classic and noble
metaphysical discourse. His reply was:</p>

<p>"What is truth? Right and wrong are relative terms. You have a
certain standard; if things help you, you call them good. It is not
a lie to say that which is necessary to produce good. I do not
distinguish virtues. Everything is good. Nothing is in itself bad.
Not acts, but motives, count."</p>

<p>Finally, I carried the matter to a European long resident in
India, and of great sympathy with the Indian mind.</p>

<p>"Why," I asked, "do men of high position make false statements,
and then name in support documents which, when I dig them out,
either fail to touch the subject at all or else prove the statement
to be false?"</p>

<p>"Because," he replied, "to the Hindu nothing is false that he
wants to believe. Or, all materiality being nothingness, all
statements concerning it are lies. Therefore he may blamelessly
choose the lie that serves his purpose. Also, when he presents to
you the picture that it suits him to offer, it never occurs to him
that you might go to the pains of checking up his words at the
source."</p>

<p>In the same line, a well-informed New York journalist, in the
winter of 1926-27, asked certain Indians who had been publicly
talking in the city: "Why do you make such egregiously false
allegations about conditions in India?"</p>

<p>"Because," said one of them, speaking for the rest, "you
Americans know nothing of India. And your missionaries, when they
come back for more money, tell too much truth, and hurt our pride.
So we have tc tell lies, to balance up."</p>

<p>As his metaphysics work out, it is no shame to a Hindu to be
"caught in a lie." You do not embarrass or annoy him by so catching
him. His morality is no more involved in the matter than in a move
in a game of chess.</p>

<p>Now, in the name of fair play, it cannot be too strongly
emphasized that this characteristic, this point of view, this
different evaluation, constitutes not necessarily an inferiority,
but certainly a difference, like the color of the skin. Yet as a
difference involved in the heart of human intercourse, it must
constantly be reckoned with and understood; else that intercourse
will often and needlessly crash. <b>[305]</b> <a name="page306" id=

<h2>CHAPTER XXIII - PRINCES OF INDIA</h2>

<p>Thus far we have been dealing mainly with British India, as
distinct from the Indian Empire composed of British India and the
Indian States. Of the total area of the Indian Empire--1,805,332
square miles--39 per cent, belongs to the Indian States. Of the
total population of the Empire--318,942,480--the Indian States hold
23 per cent., or about 72,000,000 persons.[1] Individually, the
states vary in size from properties of twenty square miles or less
to a domain as large as Italy. Each is governed by its own prince,
or, if the prince be a minor, by his regent or administrator. Some
of the ruling houses are Hindu, some Muhammadan, some Sikh, or, in
accordance with "heir history.</p>

<blockquote>[1. See <i>Statistical Abstract for British India from
1914-15 to 1923-24, pp.</i> 3-5.]</blockquote>

<p>The territorial integrity, as well as the sovereign rights of
the princes within their territories, was made the subject of
special pledge in Queen Victoria's Proclamation of 1858 on
assumption of the Paramount Power. Laying down the principle that
Britain not only desired no extension of territory for herself, but
would permit no aggression from any quarter upon the domains of the
Indian States, the Queen added:</p>

<p class="quote">We shall respect the rights, dignity and honour of
the Native Princes as our own; and we desire that they, as well as
our own subjects, should enjoy that prosperity and that social
advancement which can only be secured by internal peace and good
government.</p>

<p>The relation between the British Government and the ruling
chiefs is a treaty relation, not that of conqueror and conquered.
It leaves the princes free to determine their own types of
government, to levy their own taxes, and to wield the power of life
and death within their territories. The basis of the relation, on
the part of Britain, is (a) non-interference in the states'
internal affairs, excepting in cases of grave need, while
exercising such progressive influence as may be tactfully possible;
and (b) the safeguarding of the interests of the country as a
whole, in matters of an Imperial character. Foreign relations and
negotiations between state and state, must, however, be conducted
through the Paramount Power. A British political officer, called
Resident, is stationed in each of the larger states, to advise the
Ruling Chief. The small states, by groups similarly, have their
British advisers, members of the political branch of the Viceregal
Government.</p>

<p>Once a year the Chamber of Princes, under the chairmanship of
the Viceroy, convenes at Delhi for discussion of common policies.
This assembly is a brilliant, stately and dignified function. And
if, in ordinary times, no great weight of business confronts it,
owing to the self-contained nature of the elements represented, its
convocation nevertheless serves a wise purpose. For it tends,
through personal acquaintance under favorable auspices, to
harmonize relations between the ruling houses, while affording a
medium for rapid common action in case of need. Nevertheless to
this meeting two or three of the greatest of the princes have never
yet been persuaded to come, on the ground, it is said, that
occasions would arise on which for me~ chanical reasons some one of
their number must cede precedence.</p>

<p>In visiting Indian States it is extremely difficult to arrive at
an idea of the actual nature of the administration. One is the
guest of the prince, enjoying a lavish hospitality. Like any
private host, the prince is showing off the estate, exhibiting
those parts that are, to him, most noteworthy. From ancient palaces
to modern improvements, there is much of great beauty and interest
to occupy one's eyes. And one scarcely demands of one's host, East
or West: "Now, where are the defects of the picture?"</p>

<p>Nevertheless, it is definitely visible that several states are
well-governed, that most are fairly governed, including some that
are backward, and that a few are governed badly. These last exhibit
the famous "Golden Age," preserved like a fly in amber. Their court
life and the life of the people are sections from the unexpurgated
Arabian Nights. On the one side strange outbreaks of rage,
jealousy, violence, the sudden and final disappearance over night
of a favorite minister, lurid punishments and poisonings, and the
endless mortal intrigues of the <i>zenana.</i> On the other side a
populace too lifeless even to complain of the burden that crushes
it.</p>

<p>The old normal relation of the prince to the people was the
relation of a huge-topped plant to a poor, exhausted, over-taxed
root. He squeezed his people dry, giving little or nothing in
return. And under such a prince, unless he be too outrageous, the
people may today be fairly content. For their whole historic
experience tells them little or nothing of a possible other mode of
existence. And they dearly love the parade, the great ceremonies
and brilliant spectacles of birthdays, marriages and religious
f&ecirc;tes, that their princes so regularly provide but which,
because of the tax burdens involved, are rarely afforded under
British rule.</p>

<p>On the whole, however, it is obvious that the tendency of state
government is to level up. This is largely due to the growing
ambition of the chiefs for the condition of their properties. Or
again, progress is effected when the removal of an unfit ruler
leaves the administration of the state in the hands of the
Resident, with, it may be, a regent, during the minority of the
heir. A measure of comparison is thereby established, favoring the
birth of active discontent if a retrograde government follows and
tending gradually to force up its quality from below.</p>

<p>As a particular instance, one may cite the case of a certain
prince whose minority lasted twenty years. During this period the
British Resident administered the state, and, for the first time in
its history, its revenues went to the service of the people. Good
roads and bridges were built, schools were opened, a modern
hospital was established and endowed with a competent staff; order
was secured; trade and manufactures were fostered; the exchequer
made solvent, the reserve funds built up, justice was put within
the reach of all. And, all the years of this pleasant novelty, the
people sighed for the day when their prince, not only dearly
beloved but also ritualistically half-divine in their eyes, should
come home and rule over them as his fathers had done over their
fathers.</p>

<p>The day dawned. The boy took over. The wives and the concubines,
the court officials, the dancing girls and the ambitious relatives
at once laid hold on him, plying him with every soft temptation
that could dissolve his energy and will-power, sap his manhood and
make him easy to control. In three years' time he had ruined the
work of the preceding twenty. The treasury reserves were gone.
Taxes shot up. Public services went flat. The excellent doctor, who
cost $500 a month, had been replaced by a sixteen-dollar dealer in
charms and potions. The competent hospital staff was replaced by
useless hangers-on. The hospital itself had turned into a kennel;
and so on, through the departments, shab-biness and decay
overwhelming them all. No justice was to be had and no appeal could
be taken against bought decisions, for there was none who cared to
hear, except at a price. Graft did everything, and the people were
bled to provide money for their young ruler's extravagances and
vices.</p>

<p>At last they came to their old friend, the Resident,
pleading:</p>

<p>"We did long to have him come to live among us and rule over us.
But we knew not how it would be. We can bear no more. Let the Sahib
return and give us peace and justice and the good life we had
before."</p>

<p>The people had begun to think.</p>

<p>Scandalous tales are told of the cruelties and monstrous deeds
of certain princes, and a measure of ground work probably underlies
many such tales. But none of them can be accepted without specific
proof, for the reason that the Indian anti-government press seizes
upon every suggestion of such material, spreading it broadcast,
elaborated and magnified without regard to facts. It provides a
text to attack Government for laxness in permitting such things to
be; although where Government intervenes the same elements are
often quick to raise the cry of "alien despot."</p>

<p>The boy born to the throne comes into the world with a fearful
handicap. All want his favor, and the ancient highroad thereto is
the ministration to unbridled sensuality, arrogance and
extravagance. But sometimes there is a strong and intelligent
Queen-mother who defends her son. And sometimes the heir is sent to
a public school in England; or, he may spend some years in one of
the four Chiefs' Colleges in India, where, also, wholesome
influences are brought to bear.</p>

<p>One of these influences is the give-and-take of life among his
peers. In his home he has no equal within reach, and is, therefore,
always with inferiors or elders. A second influence for good is the
constant effort to rouse him from physical and mental sloth and to
get him to work and to play active games, especially games such as
tennis, which he can carry back to his home. Not the least factor
that the school wields in his favor is the understanding friendship
of the British headmaster, his appreciation of the boy's
difficulties, present and to come, and his quiet instillation of
that active ideal of princely pride which is the pride to
serve.</p>

<p>In some cases the work of education seems completely lost in the
boy's later life. But the development of character in others is
definitely lifting the whole standard of government in the Indian
States.</p>

<p>An outstanding example is that of the State of Mysore, a
principality of size nearly equal to that of Scotland, with some
six million inhabitants. The father of the present prince was
carefully trained for his duties under British guidance. Acceding
to a government which, during his minority, had been set in order
by British supervision, he proceeded, with the aid of a good
Dewan,[2] to administer well and faithfully to the interest of his
people. Dying in 1894, he left a minor heir, so that again the
state, in the hands of the Queen-regent, came under British
guidance, while again a young prince went into training for coming
responsibilities. In 1907 this prince was enthroned. Since that
time he has given a high example of unselfish and intelligent
devotion to his duties.</p>

<blockquote>[2. Premier.]</blockquote>

<p>A devout orthodox Hindu, his recent choice of a Muhammadan
Persian, Mr. Mirza Ismail, C.I.E., O.B.E., as Dewan, may be taken
as a proof of his single-eyed desire for the good of his state. The
cit) of Mysore, with its wide, shaded avenues, its fine modern
public buildings, its parks and gardens, and its floods of electric
light, is a model town, clean and bright. A large technical
college, a large University building with its separate library, an
extensive hospital, are among the many conspicuous and handsome
edifices. A big irrigation scheme is nearing completion. The
state's rich mineral resources, its agriculture and its peasant
industries and manufactures are being developed on progressive
lines. Wages of both skilled and unskilled labor have doubled in
late years. A system of bringing the people, through elected
representatives, into periodic communication with the head of the
state on the state's affairs, is in successful operation. And
finally, to dismiss so pleasant a subject too briefly, two blots on
the picture are being removed.</p>

<p>First; An Edict has gone forth that, as between two candidates
for administrative office, the office shall go to the better
qualified man rather than to the man of higher caste. And, second,
the state's health record being too low, the prince, through his
Dewan, has not stopped short of reaching for the best the world
affords. He has asked the International Health Board of the
Rockefeller Foundation to help him make Mysore the cynosure of
India.</p>

<p>The request, the second[3] of its sort to come from any part of
the Indian Empire, has been gladly honored. The outcome will be of
extraordinary interest.</p>

<blockquote>[3. The first request to the Rockefeller Foundation to
advise a government in India came from that of the Madras
Presidency. An officer of the Foundation is now stationed
there.]</blockquote>

<p>All of the princes keep armies, according to the needs of their
domains. Thus the Nizam of Hyderabad, with his state of nearly
83,000 square miles maintains an army of about twenty thousand men,
while the Maharaja of Datia, with but 911 square miles, commands a
full company of Infantry and a battery of seven field guns.
Infantry, cavalry, artillery, and transport corps compose the
larger commands.</p>

<p>Here is a story, from the lips of one whose veracity has never,
I believe, been questioned. The time was that stormy period in 1920
when the new Reforms Act was casting doubt over the land and giving
rise to the persistent rumor that Britain was about to quit India.
My informant, an American of long Indian experience, was visiting
one of the most important of the princes--a man of great charm,
cultivation and force, whose work for his state was of the first
order. The prince's Dewan was also present, and the three gentlemen
had been talking at ease, as became the old friends that they
were.</p>

<p>"His Highness does not believe," said the Dewan, "that Britain
is going to leave India. But still, under this new r&eacute;gime in
England, they may be so ill-advised. So, His Highness is getting
his troops in shape, accumulating munitions and coining silver. And
if the English do go, three months afterward not a rupee or a
Virgin will be left in all Bengal."</p>

<p>To this His Highness, sitting in his capital distant from Bengal
by half the breadth of India, cordially agreed. His ancestors
through the ages had been predatory Mahratta chiefs.</p>

<p>The Swarajists, it would appear, forget that, the moment
government were placed in their hands, the princes would flash into
the picture as powers in the land, severally to be reckoned with
exactly as they were a century ago; and that the Indian Army, if it
hung together at all, might be more likely to follow one of the
outstanding princes rather than the commands of a Legislative
Assembly composed of a type that India has never known or
obeyed.</p>

<p>The Indian mind is cast in the mould of autocratic aristocracy.
A natural war means a princely leader and unlimited loot. If His
Highness above had set out for Bengal, the manpower of the
countrysides, barring Britain's presence, would surely have romped
after him.</p>

<p>But the princes know well that if Britain were to withdraw from
India, they themselves, each for himself, would at once begin
annexing territory; that all would be obliged to live under arms,
each defending his own borders; and that the present-day politician
would in the first onset finally disappear like a whiff of chaff
before flame.</p>

<p>The princes, however, want no such issue. They frankly say that
they enjoy the p<i>ax Britannica,</i> which not only relieves them
from the necessity of sustaining larger military establishments,
but which gives them the enjoyment of public utilities, as
railroads, good highroads, ports, markets, mail, and wires, while
permitting them to develop their properties in peace. Their
attitude during the War was wholly loyal, and they contributed
munificently of money, men and goods to the Empire's cause. In a
word, they are a company of high-spirited, militant aristocrats
strongly interested that the British Crown shall remain suzerain in
India, but absolutely refusing to carry their complaisance so far
as to admit the Indian politician of the Reforms Government as an
agent to their courts.</p>

<p>Their supreme contempt of that class is not un-mingled with
distinct irritation that the Power to which they acknowledge fealty
stoops to parley with what seems to them an impudent and ridiculous
<i>canaille.</i></p>

<p>"Our treaties are with the Crown of England," one of them said
to me, with incisive calm. "The princes of India made no treaty
with a Government that included Bengali <i>babus.</i> We shall
never deal with this new lot of Jacks-in-office. While Britain
stays, Britain will send us English gentlemen to speak for the
King-Emperor, and all will be as it should be between friends. If
Britain leaves, we, the princes, will know how to straighten out
India, even as princes should."</p>

<p>Then I recall a little party given in Delhi by an Indian friend
in order that I might privately hear the opinions of certain Home
Rule politicians. Most of the guests were, like my host, Bengali
Hindus belonging to the western-educated professional class. They
had spoken at length on the coming expulsion of Britain from India
and on the future in which they themselves would rule the land.</p>

<p>"And what," I asked, "is your plan for the princes?" "We shall
wipe them out!" exclaimed one with conviction. And all the rest
nodded assent. <a name="pt-5" id="pt-5"></a></p>

<h1>PART V</h1>

<h2><i>Interlude</i> - INTO THE NORTH</h2>

<p>Kohat, guarding the mouth of Kohat Pass--just one little post on
the long line of the North-West Frontier defenses. All compact and
tight-set, fit for the grim work it faces. Beds of blue violets
along its streets. Beds of blue violets in gardens, for somehow
your Briton will have flowers, wherever you strand him. Barbed wire
entanglements girdling the town. Lights every hundred paces, and
heavy-armed sentries. Big arc searchlights at each corner of each
house, turned on full blaze at dusk. No shrubs, no trees or other
cover for skulkers, allowed too near a dwelling. No white woman
permitted outside the wire after daylight begins to fail; not
because of fears, but because of things that have happened. Army
officers' wives they are, the few white women in Kohat; the quiet,
comradely sort that play the whole game to the finish.</p>

<p>And not one moment of any day or night, in this or any Frontier
post, is free from mortal danger.</p>

<p>Under the wing of the Post, an Indian town, ringed about by high
mud walls. Bazaars, mosques, temples, blind-faced houses in pinched
and tortuous streets, where hawk-nosed men in sheepskin coats, with
rifles lying in the crook of their arms, shoulder bullocks and
asses for passage. Hundreds of little stalls, like booths in a
country fair, reflect the Afghan boundary. Wonderful shining
slippers, heelless and curly-toed, for the little feet of Muslim
ladies; Persian bed-posts, gayly lacquered; beautiful gauzes;
block-printed silks and cottons; vessels inlaid in tin and brass or
copper; peacock pottery; fine fox-skins from the mountains; red
rugs from Bokhara; meat, for this is a Muslim country; rice and
curry and sugar, because certain Hindus have ventured in, lending
money while they sell their wares and getting always richer with
their money-lending.</p>

<p>Getting too rich, maybe, and a little too confident. For though
the hawk-nosed man in the big sheepskin coat may not be their match
in playing with money, that lurks in his half-humorous, wholly
piercing hawk-eye that should warn the boldest.</p>

<p>Besides, this hawk-nosed, hawk-eyed citizen is here in his own
country. And no more than a revolver-shot away, in the gray,
impending crags of the Frontier mountains lurk his brother Muslims,
the wild tribes who call no man king or master, who know no
business other than that of raiding, and whose favorite year-round
sport is the kidnapping of Hindu money-lenders to hear the queer
sounds they emit in the course of the subsequent entertainment.</p>

<p>In all this world, say the men who, day and night, year in, year
out, guard the frontier of India--in all this world are no fighters
better than the tribesmen. Also, behind them lies Afghanistan, like
a couchant leopard, green eyes fixed on the glittering bait of
India. And behind Afghanistan--nay, in Kabul itself, lurks "the Man
that walks like a Bear," fingering gold and whispering ceaselessly
of the glories of a rush across the border that shall sweep the
Crescent through the strong Muslim Punjab, gathering Islam in its
train; that shall raise the Muslims of the South and so shall close
from both sides, like a tide, forever, over the heads of the
Hindus.</p>

<p>"Why not?" asks the Bear. "Are you feebler men than your
fathers? What stops you? The English? But look! I worry them on the
other flank, stirring up the silly Hindus, North and South, against
them. Already these English relax their hand, as the councils of
their home-country weaken. And, I, the Bear, am behind you. Look at
the loot and the killings! Drive in your wedge! Strike!" <a name=

<h2>CHAPTER XXIV - FIREBRANDS TO STRAW</h2>

<p>Roughly speaking, three-quarters of the population of British
India are Hindus, if the 60,000,000 Untouchables be computed with
the Hindus.[1] Roughly speaking, one quarter of the population of
British India is Muhammadan. And between the two lies a great gulf
whence issues a continuous threatening rumble, with periodic
destructive outbursts of sulphur and flame.</p>

<blockquote>[1. The Census of India, of 1921 shows about three and
a quarter million Sikhs and about one and a sixth million Jains, of
both of which sects many members call themselves Hindus. The
Buddhists, numbering eleven and a half millions, are largely
confined to the Province of Burma, outside the Indian
Peninsula.]</blockquote>

<p>This gulf constitutes one of the greatest factors in the present
Indian situation.</p>

<p>Its elements formed integral parts of the problem that the
British Crown assumed in 1858. And if for the first half-century of
Crown rule they remained largely dormant, the reason is not
obscure. During that half-century, Government was operated by
British officers of the Civil Service, both in the administrative
and in the judicial branches. These officers, in the performance of
their duties, made no difference between Hindu and Muhammadan,
holding the general interest in an equal hand. Therefore, being in
the enjoyment of justice and of care, man by man, day by day, and
from an outside authority that neither Hindu nor Muhamma-dan could
challenge, neither party was roused to jealousy, and religious
communal questions scarcely arose.</p>

<p>In 1909, however, the wind switched to a stormy quarter. The
Minto-Morley scheme was enacted by Parliament as the "Indian
Councils Act."</p>

<p>The effect of this measure was instantly to alarm the Muhammadan
element, rousing it into self-consciousness as a distinct and
separate body, unorganized, but suspicious, militant in spirit and
disturbed about its rights. For it saw, clearly enough, that in any
elected legislature, and in any advantages thereby to be gained,
the Hindu was practically sure to shoulder the Muhammadan out of
the path.</p>

<p>Now in order to understand how this situation came about, it is
necessary to recall that Muhammadanism first came to India as the
religion of the conqueror; that for five hundred years its arm
controlled the greater part of India, during which period Persian
was the language of the court, the language of literature and
verse, the language of the law. But the Muhammadan, though he
learned his Koran and his Persian verse, was as a rule an open-air
sort of man who would rarely bother his own head with pens or books
if he could find another to do the job for him. Therefore, whenever
some Brahman, with his quick brain and facile memory, acquired a
knowledge of Persian and thereby released his further store of
learning for the master's use, he was apt to find a desirable niche
in government service.</p>

<p>Consequently, for five centuries or so, the Brahman did much of
the paper work, while the Muhammadan commanded the country.</p>

<p>The history of the interval between Islam's effective dominance
and the assumption of direct administration by the British Crown
has been elsewhere outlined.[2] It was twenty-one years previous to
the latter event--back in the days of the East India Company--that
a little seed was sown with whose fruit we now deal.</p>

<blockquote>[2. <i>See</i> pp. 283 <i>et seq.,
ante.</i>]</blockquote>

<p>This was the changing of the language of the Courts of Justice
from Persian to English.</p>

<p>The change took place as a logical part of the westernizing of
Indian education. It looked simple. Its results have been simple,
like the results of a clean stroke of the ax. The Calcutta
University Commission thus suggests the initial process:[3]</p>

<blockquote>[3. <i>Report,</i> Vol. I, Part I, pp.
37-8.]</blockquote>

<p class="quote">The influence of the Act of 1837 and the
Resolution of 1844 [giving preference in government appointments to
Indians who had received a Western education] upon the Hindu
<i>bhadralok</i>[4] from among whom all the minor officials had
long been drawn, was bound to be decisive. They had long been in
the habit of learning a foreign language--Persian--as a condition
of public employment; they now learnt English instead. It was,
indeed, the Hindus who alone took advantage of the new
opportunities in public education in any large numbers. The
Musalmans naturally protested strongly against the change; which
was, indeed, disastrous for them. Hitherto their knowledge of
Persian had given them a considerable advantage. They refused to
give up learning it. It was for them the language of culture. To
take up English in addition would be too heavy a burden; moreover,
they had learnt to think of English as associated with Christian
teaching, owing to the activity of the missionaries, and they were
less willing than the Hindus to expose their sons to missionary
influences. Their pride and their religious loyalty revolted; and
they stood aloof from the movement.</p>

<blockquote>[4. Professional classes.]</blockquote>

<p>Literate or illiterate, the Muhammadan is a passionate
monotheist. "There is but One God." His mosques are clear of
images. His frequent daily prayer is offered straight to the
invisible One Omnipotent. And although he respects Christianity as
a revealed religion and reverences Christ as an inspired teacher,
the doctrine of the Trinity constitutes an impossible heresy. His
faith is his highest possession, and he would not willingly open
the door to what he considered impure doctrine by learning its
vehicle, the English tongue.</p>

<p>Deeply hurt by the alternatives forced upon it, Islam withdrew
into itself, little foreseeing the consequences of its
withdrawal.</p>

<p>As long as British officials administered the affairs of India
in town and village, the potentiality of the situation thus created
remained obscured. But the first gun of the Minto-Morley "Reforms,"
rent the curtain, and the startled Islamic chiefs, their hands on
the hilt of the sword a-rust in the scabbard, peered forth
half-awake upon a world dark with shapes of ill-omen.</p>

<p>And so, greatly at a disadvantage, the Muslims as a political
entity reappeared in the field. Yet over the wide country, in the
villages and the hamlets, the stir scarcely reached. For there,
still, the British official alone represented Government, dealing
justice and favor with an even hand, and Muslim and Hindu, side by
side, lived at peace.</p>

<p>Then came 1919, the extension of the "Reforms" of 1909, the
transfer of much power, place and patronage from British into
Indian hands, and the promise, furthermore, of a reviewal of the
field at the end of a third ten-year interval, with an eye to still
further transfers.</p>

<p>From that moment, except in country districts un-reached by
agitators, peace between the two elements became a mere name--an
artificial appearance maintained wholly by the British presence.
And now, as 1929 draws nigh, the tension daily increases, while the
two rivals pace around each other in circles, hackles up, looking
for first toothhold.</p>

<p>For a time during the political disturbances that followed the
War a brief farce of unity was played by the leaders of that day.
Mr. Gandhi embraced the Khilafat[5] agitation as embodied in those
picturesque freebooters, the Ali brothers, if thereby the
Muham-madan weight might be swung with his own to embarrass the
British administration. But the Khilafat cause itself died an early
death. And a single incident of the Gandhi-Ali alliance may be
cited to illustrate the actual depth of the brotherhood it
proclaimed.</p>

<blockquote>[5. An Islamic movement aiming at the restoration of
Turkey to prewar status, including her reconquest of the
emancipated Armenians and Arabs, and her recovery of Palestine,
Syria, Thrace, and the Dardanelles.]</blockquote>

<p>Up on the mountains overlooking the Malabar coast, among a
population of about two million Hindus, live a people known as the
Moplahs, descendants of old Arab traders and the women of the
country. The Moplahs, who themselves number about a million, live
in surprisingly clean and well-kept houses, have often intelligent,
rugged faces and, according to my own experience, are an
interesting and friendly primitive folk.</p>

<p>But, zealot Muhammadans, they have ever been prone to outbreaks
of religious passion in which their one desire is to be sent to
Paradise by a bullet or a knife, first having piled up the longest
possible list of non-believers dead by their hands.</p>

<p>Among these simple creatures, in the year of disorders 1921, the
political combination above indicated sent emissaries preaching a
special edition of its doctrines. Government's hand, these
proclaimed, was raised against the holy places of Islam. Government
was "Satanic," an enemy of the Faith. Government must and would be
driven out of India and that right soon. Swaraj must be set up.</p>

<p>From mosque to mosque, from hamlet to hamlet, from cocoanut
grove to cocoanut grove, the fiery words passed. And, whatever
meaning they might bear for an abstract philosopher, to the simple
Moplah, as, in those miserable years, to so many millions of simple
Hindus all over the land, they meant just what they said--War.</p>

<p>But, the point that Mr. Gandhi missed, whatever the humorous Ali
brothers may privately have thought about it, was this: Swaraj, to
a Moplah, could only mean the coming of the earthly Kingdom of
Islam, in which, whatever else happened or failed to happen, no
idol-worshiping Hindu could be tolerated alive.</p>

<p>So the Moplahs, secretly and as best they could, made store of
weapons--knives, spears, cutlasses. And on August 20, 1921, the
thing broke loose. As if by a preliminary gesture of courtesy to
the sponsors of the occasion, one European planter was murdered at
the start. But without further dissipation of energy the frenzied
people then concentrated on the far more congenial task of communal
war. First blocking the roads, cutting the telegraph wires and
tearing up the railway lines at strategic points, thereby isolating
the little police stations scattered through the mountains, they
set to work, in earnest and in detail, to establish a Muslim
Kingdom and to declare a Swaraj after their own hearts.</p>

<p>Their Hindu neighbors, though outnumbering them two to one, seem
to have stood no chance against them. The Hindu women, as a rule,
were first circumcised--&bull; "forcibly converted," as the process
is called--and were then added to Moplah families. The Hindu men
were sometimes given the choice of death or "conversion," sometimes
flayed alive, sometimes cutlassed at once and thrown down their own
wells. In one district, the Ernad Taluk, over nine hundred males
were "forcibly converted" and the work spread on through the
mountain-slopes.</p>

<p>As rapidly as possible police and troops were thrown into the
country, by whose work, after six months of trying service, the
disorders were quelled. But not until some three thousand Moplahs
had cast away their lives, without reckoning the Hindus they
accounted for, not until much property had been destroyed and many
families ruined, and not until a long list of prisoners awaited
trial for guilt that certainly belonged on heads higher than
theirs.</p>

<p>Meantime, the circumcised male Hindus wandered up and down the
land calling upon their brethren to take warning.</p>

<p>A trained American observer, agent of the United States
Government, chanced to be in the region at the time. His statement
follows:</p>

<p>"I saw them in village after village, through the south and east
of Madras Presidency. They had been circumcised by a peculiarly
painful method, and now, in many cases, were suffering tortures
from blood poisoning. They were proclaiming their misery, and
calling on all their gods to curse Swaraj and to keep the British
in the land. 'Behold our miserable bodies! We are defiled,
outcasted, unclean, and all because of the serpents who crept among
us with their poison of Swaraj. Once let the British leave the land
and the shame that has befallen us will assuredly befall you also,
Hindus, men and women, every one.'</p>

<p>"The terrors of hell were literally upon them.</p>

<p>"And the Brahman priests were asking one hundred to one hundred
and fifty rupees a head to perform the purification ceremony which
alone could save the poor creatures' souls.</p>

<p>"This ceremony consisted in filling the eyes, ears, mouth and
nose with soft cow-dung, which must then be washed out with cow's
urine, after which should be administered <i>ghee</i> (clarified
butter), milk and curds. It sounds simple, but can only be
performed by a Brah-man, and with proper rites and sacred verses.
And the price which the Brahmans now set upon their services was,
to most of the needy, prohibitive. Their distress was so desperate
that British officials, for once interfering in a religious matter,
interceded with the Brahmans and persuaded them, in view of the
large number concerned, to accept a wholesale purification fee of
not over twelve rupees a head."</p>

<p>I have not verified the final item in this statement. My
informant, however, besides having been on the spot at the time, is
professionally critical as to evidence.</p>

<p>If there was anything particularly Muhammadan in this outbreak,
it was in the feature of "forcible conversion" rather than in the
general barbarity educed. Less than six months before the Moplah
affair began, occurred the Chauri Chaura incident in the United
Provinces, far away from Malabar.</p>

<p>An organization called the "National Volunteers" had lately been
formed, more or less under pay, to act as a militia for the
enforcement of the decrees of the Working Committee of the Indian
National Congress. This "Congress" is a purely political
organization, and was, at the time, under the control of Mr.
Gandhi.</p>

<p>On February 4, 1921, a body of National Volunteers, followed by
a mob whom their anti-government propaganda had inflamed, attacked
the little police station at Chauri Chaura, within which were
assembled some twenty-one police constables and village watchmen,
the common guardians of the rural peace. The peasantry and the
"Volunteers," numbering altogether some three thousand men,
surrounded the police station, shot a few of its inmates dead,
wounded the rest, collected the wounded into a heap, poured oil
over them, and fried them alive.</p>

<p>This was as Hindu to Hindu.</p>

<p>Again, in the Punjab during the disorders of 1919,
anti-Government workers launched a special propaganda for the
violation of foreign women.</p>

<p>Its public declarations took the form of posters such as these:
"Blessed be Mahatma Gandhi. We are sons of India...Gandhi! We the
Indians will fight to death after you;" and "What time are you
waiting for now? There are many ladies here to dishonor. Go all
around India, clear the country of the ladies," etc., etc.[6]</p>

<blockquote>[6. See <i>Disorders Inquiry Committee, 1919-20,
Report,</i> Chapter VII, for placards posted in and around
Lyallpur, in April, 1919.]</blockquote>

<p>This was as Indian to white man.</p>

<p>Such language, to such a public, could carry neither a
figurative nor a second import. Had time been given it to do its
work, had a weak hand then held the helm of the Punjab, an
unbearable page had been written in the history of India.</p>

<p>And if these three instances are here brought forward from among
the scores of grim contemporaneous parallels with which they can be
diversified and re&euml;n-forced, it is not for the purpose of
shaming the Indian peoples, but rather to point out the wild,
primitive and terribly explosive nature of the elements that
politicians and theorists take into their hands when they ignite
those people's passions.</p>

<p>In most rural regions even now no developed Hindu-Muhammadan
animosity exists, and the two elements live together amicably
enough as neighbors, unless outside political agents have disturbed
them.</p>

<p>Instances occur, to be sure, such as that in the District of
Bulandshahr, near Delhi, in the year 1924, when the Ganges flooded.
It was a disastrous flood, sweeping away whole villages and their
inhabitants, man and beast. Upon certain Hindu ferrymen and
fishermen, the local owners of boats, depended the first work of
rescue. And these made use of the opportunity to refuse to take a
single drowning Muhammadan out of the water.</p>

<p>But, on the other hand, I recall visiting a village
night-school, set up by Muhammadans for their own boys, which was
in part supported by contributions from the Hindu neighbors. This
was in Nadia District, in Bengal, where the villagers of the two
religions seemed to bear no sort of ill-will toward each other, and
where an ever-active British Deputy Commissione!, was their
confidant and chosen counsellor in all then affairs.</p>

<p>Something, again, is to be learned from the simple history of a
park designed for the city of Lucknow. When the ground came to be
surveyed, it was found that a little Hindu temple lay in one corner
of the allotted area. Following their established policy in such
matters, the British authorities left the temple undisturbed.</p>

<p>Then came the Muhammadans of the city, saying: "We, too, desire
a place in this fine new park wherein to say our prayers."</p>

<p>So the Municipal authorities arranged that a suitable open space
be set aside at the opposite corner of the park for the
Muhammadans. And the Hindus worshiped in their temple, and the
Muhammadans worshiped in their open space, both quite happily and
innocently, for a matter of eight years.</p>

<p>In the interval came the "Reforms," came the fruit of the
"Reforms," came a tension, stiffening steadily.</p>

<p>For Lucknow is a Muhammadan city, in the sense that all the
important people, all the old families, all the great buildings and
monuments, are of the ancient Muhammadan kingdom of Oudh. Wherefore
the Muhammadans felt that if the control of India was about to
revert to Indians' hands their city of Lucknow ought to revert to
them.</p>

<p>But, though the history and the aristocracy of Luck-now are
indubitably Muhammadan, in the population of Lucknow the Hindu
outnumbers the Muhammadan three to one. Wherefore the Hindus,
filled with sudden fear of the future, now asked each other:</p>

<p>"If this Swaraj is indeed coming, where will it plant us Hindus
of Lucknow? Under Muhammadan masters? Better were we all dead
men!"</p>

<p>Upon which they began to organize, to assert themselves, perhaps
rather aggressively and offensively, and particularly to do so each
evening, toward sunset, in that little old temple by the park.</p>

<p>Now, sunset is an hour appointed for Muslim devotion. For eight
years the Muslim prayer-rugs had been spread, five minutes before
sunset, in that same little park, and the faithful, kneeling in
rows, had said their vespers there. Nor would they submit to
interruption by obstreperous Hindus now. So, they issued an edict:
The Hindus, hereafter, must choose for their temple meeting a time
that did not clash with the Muham-madans' evening prayer.</p>

<p>The Hindus resented the edict of the Muhamma-dans. The
Muhamrnadans resented the resentment of the Hindus. Tinder
smoldered up to &euro;ame. And presently big gangs of each religion
gathered in the park at one and the same hour to fight the thing to
a finish.</p>

<p>In the matter ensuing, the Muhammadans seem to have been the
more skillful, since they swept the field quickly of human
impedimenta and were about to smash the offensive temple itself,
when a detachment of police, re&euml;nforced by British troops,
intervened.</p>

<p>Thus this particular incident came to a standstill, such of the
combatants as were able dispersing to their homes. But an intense
and really dangerous feeling, bred of the battle and of the fear
and jealousy in the air, survived in full vigor. If a small lurking
party of the other side saw a Hindu or a Muhammadan pass in the
street, that party would dash out, seize and beat him. To restore
confidence it was necessary for two or three days to patrol the
city streets with British cavalry.</p>

<p>Enter, then, the British District Commissioner--for cities, as
well as rural parts, have their commissioners. And the
Commissioner, obviously, must "arrange." For the quarrel was
literally ruining the town. Trade was suffering, small shops were
failing, the people were boycotting each other, and fresh broils
and violence, promising any eruption, disfigured every day.</p>

<p>So the Commissioner invited the leaders of the factions to come
to his house and talk it over--because his house was the only place
where they would meet in peace. They came, and sat, and came again.
They sat and talked and talked again. And neither party would yield
an inch.</p>

<p>The Hindus insisted that they must begin to beat their prayer
drums five minutes before sunset. The Muhammadans as firmly
maintained: "At exactly five minutes before sunset we must begin
our evening worship, which you Hindus shall not disturb."</p>

<p>Yet at last the Commissioner prevailed. For he elicited from the
Hindus a concession of five minutes, and from the Muhammadans a
concession of five minutes. Then, with his combined winnings safe
under his feet, he proceeded to extract from the Hindus a promise
that, during the last ten minutes before sunset, they would not
play music in their temple; and from the Muhammadans a promise that
on the dot of the first of the silent ten minutes they would begin
their ten-minute vesper prayer.</p>

<p>For, during the conferences in the Commissioner's drawing room,
the fact had developed that the Muhammadans' objection lay, not to
the Hindus' praying, but to the din they made at their prayers,
hammering temple gongs and drums.</p>

<p>Those joint conferences in the Commissioner's drawing room
lasted, altogether, fifteen hours. As the fifteenth hour closed,
the Commissioner's dinner-gong rang in the hall. Whereupon one of
the Hindus pondered aloud:</p>

<p>"That gong's voice, over in our temple, wouldn't reach so
far."</p>

<p>"Will you try it and see?" asked the Commissioner, quickly. And
to this day the Hindus of that Lucknow temple worship to the low
and mellow voice of the British Commissioner's dinner-gong.</p>

<p>But that experienced official is by no means deluding himself
with the notion that he can now go to sleep on his post. <a name=

<h2>CHAPTER XXV - SONS OF THE PROPHET</h2>

<p>In December, 1916, a political body called the All-India Muslim
League united with the Indian National Congress already mentioned,
in proclaiming the identity of Muhammadan and Hindu interests, and
in asserting their common desire for Swaraj.</p>

<p>The white light of the Moplah uprising remained yet veiled on
the knees of the future, but at the joint act of the two
organizations, the Muhammadans' instinct of self-preservation, far
and wide over India, took alarm. So that when, in the autumn of
1917, Mr. Montagu, Secretary of State for India, sat in Delhi to
receive from Indian interests their views on the subject of his
proposed Reforms, association after association came forward to
deplore or to repudiate the act of the All-India Muslim League; and
the language they used was simple enough. Said the United Provinces
Muslim Defence Association:[1]</p>

<blockquote>[1. <i>Addresses Presented in India to His Excellency
the Viceroy and the Right Honourable the Secretary of State for
India,</i> London, 1918, p. 10. ]</blockquote>

<p class="quote">...any large measure of self-government which
might curtail the moderating and adjusting influence of the British
Government could be nothing short of a cataclysm.</p>

<p>Said the Indian Muslim Association of Bengal:[2]</p>

<blockquote>[2. <i>Ibid,</i> p. 30.]</blockquote>

<p class="quote">In the existing backward condition of the majority
of Hindus and Muslims, with their divergent creeds, castes,
institutions and clashing interests, the differences which separate
the Hindu from the Muslim cannot but be reflected in their dealings
and relations with each other...No careful observer will be deluded
by the deceptive unanimity of the National Congress and the Muslim
League...<br>
<br>
The Indian Muslim Association...does not agree to the wisdom of any
catastrophic changes likely to weaken the permanance and stability
of British rule in India, upon the broad foundations of which rest
all our hopes and aspirations of constitutional and administrative
progress.</p>

<p>Said the Association to Safeguard the Muslim Interests in the
Province of Bihar and Orissa:[3]</p>

<blockquote>[3. <i>Addresses Presented in India to His Excellency
the Viceroy and the Right Honourable the Secretary of State for
India,</i> p. 40.]</blockquote>

<p class="quote">We cannot deprecate too strongly the want of
foresight displayed by some of our co-religionists in endorsing in
their entirety, the views and claims of the Congress. Already there
is strong tendency visible in certain quarters to oppress and
terrorise the Musalmans and ignore...their interests. The guiding
principle of the English rule up to now has always been to
administer the affairs of Indian Empire with impartiality in the
presence of diverse religions and nationalities of which it is
composed...</p>

<p>The South India Islamia League[4] presented a plea in which they
reminded Mr. Montagu that, being a minority community, they</p>

<p class="quote">...realise the value of the British Government in
holding the scales even between different classes in this
country...[and] are opposed to any scheme of political
reconstruction which tends to undermine the authority of British
Government in India, but are strongly in favour of gradual
progressive political development.</p>

<blockquote>[4. <i>Ibid.,</i> pp. 62-3.]</blockquote>

<p>The Muttialpet Muslim Anjuman, a Muhammadan educational society
of Madras, implored Mr. Montagu to stay his reforming hand:[5]</p>

<blockquote>[5. <i>Ibid.,</i> p. 63.]</blockquote>

<p class="quote">The Britisher alone can hold the scales even
between the various communities. Whenever our interests collide
with those of other communities, it is to him we look up as the
embodiment of justice and fair play. Whatever reforms may be
introduced, we trust that nothing will be done to undermine the
authority of the British Government in India.</p>

<p>The Muhammadans of the Bombay Presidency presented an anxious
appeal which read in part:[6]</p>

<blockquote>[6. <i>Ibid.,</i> pp. 78-9.]</blockquote>

<p class="quote">It is freely asserted that in no distant future
the English bureaucracy will disappear and an Indian majority in
the Councils will take its place. Whatever may have been the
defects of that much abused bureaucracy in the past, it must be
admitted that it has had one redeeming merit, viz., that of holding
the balance even as between the two principal communities in India,
and thus protecting the weak against the strong.</p>

<p>But in view of the nature of Muhammadan thought, a more ominous
weight lay in a simpler pronouncement. The Ulema is the body of
official interpreters of the Koran which, on occasion of doubt,
delivers decisions that guide the Muslim world. The solemn verdict
of the Ulema of Madras, now laid before the British Secretary of
State for India, was expressed in three closely similar dicta, one
of which follows:[7]</p>

<blockquote>[7. <i>Addresses Presented &iuml;n India to His
Excellency the Viceroy and the Right Honourable the Secretary of
State for India,</i> pp. 63-4.]</blockquote>

<p class="quote">"Verily, Polytheists are unclean." In case the
British Gov-ernment were to hand over the administration, as
desired by the Hindus, it would be contrary to the Sacred Law of
Musulmans to live under them, Polytheists.</p>

<p>One who is forgiven!</p>

<p>The comparative numbers of the Hindu and the Muhammadan element
in the major provinces of British India may be seen from the
following table:[8]</p>

<blockquote>[8. <i>Statistical Abstract for British India, from
1914-15 to 1923-24,</i> pp. 14-5]</blockquote>

<pre>
Province                    Hindus  Muhammadans

Madras                       88.64   6.71
Bombay                       76.58  19.74

</pre>

<p>Now, in view of the militant character developed in any people
by the Islamic faith, it appears that British India's Muhammadan
factor, even where it is weakest, is strong enough to make trouble.
Always an international rather than a nationalist, all over India
the Muhammadan is saying today: "We are foreigners, conquerors,
fighting men. What if our numbers are small! Is it numbers, or men,
that count? When the British go, <i>we</i> shall rule India.
Therefore it behooves us quickly to gain such ground as we
can."</p>

<p>The Hindu, on his side, wittingly misses no step to consolidate
his own position. And so wherever choice rests in Indian hands,
every office must be filled, every decision taken, every
appropriation spent, on religious communal lines, while the other
side fights it, tooth and nail, and the actual merits of the matter
concerned disappear from the picture.</p>

<p>Heavily as this condition in all directions handicaps the public
service, nowhere is its influence more stultifying than in the
judiciary. Always an eager litigant, the Indian finds in his
religious quarrels endless occasions for appeal to law. But, if the
case must be tried before an Indian judge, one side or the other is
in despair. For, though he were, in fact, a miracle of rectitude,
he is expected to lean, in his verdict, to the side of his own
creed, and nothing can persuade the litigant of the other faith
that he will not do so.</p>

<p>The bench of India has been and is graced by some native judges
of irreproachable probity. Yet the Indian is traditionally used to
the judge who accepts a fee from either side in advance of the
trial, feeling that probity is sufficiently served if, after the
verdict, the fee of the loser is returned. Bought witnesses are
also a matter of course; you may see them today squatting before
the court house waiting to be hired. "Theoretically I know it is
irregular," said one western-educated barrister of Madras, "but
practically I cannot leave that advantage entirely in my opponent's
hands-It is our custom."</p>

<p>But when the matter of the Hindu-Muslim conflict enters in, all
else as a rule gives way. "How shall any judge decide against his
gods?" moans the unfortunate. "And does he not hold court in the
midst of my enemies? Take me, therefore, before an English judge,
who cares naught for these matters but will give me upright
judgment, though I be right or wrong."</p>

<p>A freakish case was that of an old, experienced Mu-hammadan
District Magistrate of the United Provinces before whom, last year,
were brought certain police officers of his district. These men had
grossly failed in their duty during certain religious riots,
entailing thereby the death of several persons. They richly
deserved a severe sentence. But they were Hindus. Therefore the
judge, fearing the accusation of religious animosity, let them off
with a sentence so light as to amount to an unjust award and an
offense against the public service.</p>

<p>More usual is the spirit illustrated in another incident, which
occurred in February, 1926. An old Mu-hammadan assistant engineer
who had long served in the Irrigation Department under a British
superior, suddenly found himself taking orders from a Hindu. This
young man, just out of college and full of new ideas, set himself
to worry his senior, baiting and pin-pricking till his victim could
bear no more.</p>

<p>So, accompanied by his son, the old Muslim sought out a major
British official, asking for counsel.</p>

<p>"Sahib, can't you help my father? Surely it is a shame, after
all his years of service, to treat him so! " exclaimed the son, at
the end of the story.</p>

<p>But the Briton could not resist his opportunity. "Mahmoud," said
he. "You have always wanted <i>swaraj.</i> You see, in this, what
<i>swaraj</i> does to you. How do you feel about it?"</p>

<p>"Aha!" replied the youngster. "But I've got a Deputy
Collectorship now. I take office shortly, and when I do, God help
the Hindus I get my hands on!"</p>

<p>The Muslim comprises but a bare quarter of the population of
British India. But that percentage is growing. His gains indicate
both superior fecundity and superior vitality. His brain is not
quick, but he has often a gift of horse sense. He is beginning to
see that he must go to school. Granted time, opportunity and a
sense of security, he may wipe out his handicaps and fit himself
for full participation in the administration of the country. Thrown
into the arena today, he would see but one recourse--the sword.</p>

<p>And it should never for a moment be forgotten that when the
Muslims of India draw the sword, it will not be as an isolated body
but as the advance line of an energy now banked up, like the waters
of a brimming reservoir, by the Frontier Defense of the Army.</p>

<p>A glance at the map shows a strip of territory some three
hundred and fifty miles long by from twenty to fifty miles wide,
lying along the northern boundary of the Punjab. This strip is the
North-West Frontier Province. Beyond it lies a parallel strip of
similar dimensions, tribal territory occupied by independent
Mu-hammadan clans, superb fighters whose sole business, since time
began, has been the business of raiding. Behind this, again, lies
Muhammadan Afghanistan and Muhammadan Asia, a huge primeval engine
always to be swung as one great hammer by the call to loot and a
Holy War.</p>

<p>To release that force needs at any moment but a word. Its
ceaseless pressure along the thin steel line of the frontier, its
tenseness, its snapping, stinging electric current, is scarcely
realizable until one sees and feels it for one's self.</p>

<p>Few Hindu politicians do realize it. "The Afghan has kept off us
these many long years. Why should he come through now? Bah! It is a
child's bogey!" they say with dull eyes, as unaware of their own
life-long protected state and how it is brought about as the oyster
on its sea-bed is unaware of the hurricanes that blow.</p>

<p>The North-West Frontier Province, 95 per cent. Muhammadan, lies
today quiet and contented with its government, a buffer state
between, on the one hand, the rich, part-Hindu Punjab and the vast
soft Hindu South, and on the other hand, the hungry Muslim fighting
hordes whose fingers twitch and whose mouths water to be at them.
The contentment of the North-West Frontier Province with things as
they are is invaluable to the peace of India.</p>

<p>I talked with many leading men of that province. All seemed of
one mind in the matter. Here, therefore, are the exact words of a
single representative--a mountain-bred man of Persian ancestry some
generations back--big, lean, hawk-nosed, hawk-eyed, leader of many,
sententious until his subject snatched the bridle from his
tongue:</p>

<p>"The whole province is satisfied now and desires no change. As
for those little folk of the South, we have never called them men.
There is far more difference between us and them than between us
and the British. If the British withdraw, immediate hell will
follow, in the first days of which the Bengali and all his tribe
will be removed from the earth. I can account for a few, myself,
with much pleasure. Cooperation between the British and us is our
one course. They have given us roads, telephones, good water where
no water was before, peace, justice, a revenue from trade made
possible only by their protection, safety for our families, care
for our sick and schools for our children. None of these things did
we have till they came. I ask you, is it likely we shall throw them
all away because a coward and a sneak and our own inherited enemy
calls for 'boycott,' and 'non-cooperation'? Nothing was ever gained
and much lost by that stupid 'non-cooperation.' India is a big
country and needs all our united strength can do for it. Muslims
and British and even Hindus. But without the British no Hindus will
remain in India except such as we keep for slaves."</p>

<p>On December 26, 1925, over eight years after the Indian National
Congress and the All-India Muslim League proclaimed their united
demand for the self-government of India, the former, or Hindu body,
assembled for its annual session. Its president, this time a woman,
a product of European life and education, opened the proceedings
with an address that deplored the</p>

<p class="quote">...sharp and importunate sense of aloofness on the
part of my Muslim brothers, which, to the profound alarm and
resentment of the Hindu community, manifests itself in a growing
and insistent demand for separate and preferential rights and
privileges in academic, official, civic and political circles of
life.</p>

<p>A few days later the All-India Muslim League convened. And the
address of its president, Sir Abdur Rahim, coming as a tacit reply
to the earlier pronouncement, was so clean-hewn as to constitute a
landmark in Indian history. It repays study at length.[9]</p>

<blockquote>[9. Sir Abdur Rahim's address was published in pamphlet
form by Karim Bux Brothers, Calcutta.]</blockquote>

<p class="quote">Hindus and Mussalmans are not two religious sects
like the Protestants and Catholics in England but form two distinct
communities or peoples...Their respective attitudes towards life,
their distinctive culture, civilisation and social habits, their
traditions and history no less than their religion, divide them so
completely that the fact that they have lived in the same country
for nearly a thousand years has contributed hardly anything to
their fusion into a nation.</p>

<p>Referring to recent Hindu movements set on foot to proselyte
Mussalmans, and to train Hindus in the arts of self-defense, the
speaker said:</p>

<p class="quote">The Muslims regard these movements...as the most
serious challenge to their religion which they ever had to meet not
even excepting the Christian crusades whose main objective was to
wrest back from the Muslims some places sacred to both...In fact,
some of the Hindu leaders have talked publicly of driving out the
Muslims from India as the Spaniards expelled the Moors from
Spain...We shall, undoubtedly be a big mouthful for our friends to
swallow...<br>
<br></p>

<p>Any of us Indian Mussulmans travelling, for instance in
Afghanistan, Persia, Central Asia, among Chinese Muslims, Arabs,
Turks...would at once be made at home and would not find
anything...to which we are not accustomed. On the contrary, in
India,...we find ourselves in all social matters total aliens when
we cross the street and enter that part of town where our fellow
Hindu townsmen live...<br>
<br>
It is not true that we Muslims would not like to see a
self-governing India provided the Government...is made as much
responsible to the Muslims as to the Hindu..., Otherwise, all vague
generalities such as swaraj, or commonwealth of India, or home-rule
for India have no attraction for us...But as a first step we
must...definitely check the baneful activities of those Hindu
politicians who under the protection of Englishmen's bayonets and
taking advantage of their tolerance and patience are sowing trouble
in the land to attain swaraj, the full implications of which they
do not understand and would never face...<br>
<br>
The real solution of the problem...is to bring about a state of
things in which the conditions of life of the entire
population--Hindus, Muslims, Sikhs, Parsis and Christians, the
peasants, labourers and Hindu untouchables--will be so improved
economically and intellectually and the political power so
distributed in the general population, that domination by a class
of monopolists and intelligensia, will have disappeared and with
that all strife between the different communities.<br>
<br>
It has been my lot to be in daily contact with educated Englishmen,
for nigh upon 35 years as practising barrister, as Judge,...and
last of all as Member of the Executive Council of Bengal...<br>
<br>
I wish to acknowledge without reserve that I found that I had much
to learn from my English colleagues at every stage of my career...I
have also been associated with many eminent countrymen of mine in
the discharge of public duties and I believe they will admit that
most of the progressive measures were originated by the initiative
of Englishmen...In the Government, I cannot recall even a single
occasion when there was agreement on any question among us Indians
that our opinion was disregarded...I have not known any one who has
seriously suggested that the people of this country left solely to
themselves would be able at present to set up a government of their
own and maintain it against outside attacks...It is best for us all
to recognise frankly that the presence of the English people...is
justified by necessity...England owes a great moral debt to India
and the only way she can discharge that debt is by taking all
possible measures to help her to become self-reliant and
strong.<br>
<br>
The best men of England recognise this obligation...I do not know
whether the revolutionaries have any political programme; if they
have, they have not divulged it. Their immediate objective,
apparently, is to overthrow the British regime, and with it the
entire present system of Government, We can, however, dismiss the
revolutionaries because there is not the least possible chance of
their success.<br>
<br>
We Muslims whose history for 1300 years and more has been one of
constant struggles and wars, spreading over Asia, Africa and
Europe, cannot but regard as extremely foolish and insane the men
who think that by throwing a few bombs now and then, or shooting
one or two Englishmen from behind, or by rasing and looting the
houses of unsuspecting and defenceless Indian villagers and by
killing and torturing them, they are going to shake the foundations
of British power in India...We Muslims cannot regard boys or men
suffering from hysteria as serious politicians and the fact is
significant thst not a single Muslim has joined them...<br>
<br>
Political measures are not the sole means of building up a nation.
At present we have not even a vernacular name for the people of
India including Hindus, Muslims and others, nor a common
language...It is neither by the English alone nor by the Hindus or
the Mussalmans acting singly, but by the earnest and united efforts
of all that the 300 millions of India's population can be led to a
higher destiny.</p>

<p>Sir Abdur Rahim's plain words brought down a storm of accusation
from the Hindu leaders and their press, while the rancor between
the two camps grew stronger.</p>

<p>Meantime, grim potentialities were beginning to be dimly
perceived. The Calcutta Riots broke out. By midsummer, 1926,
thirty-one murderous explosions had occurred since the beginning of
the year, some with heavy casualties.[10] It was already evident
that both sides, Muslim and Hindu, were becoming sobered by the
situation into which their mutual fears had brought them. The old
Gandhi-ist accusation that the secret hand of Britain bred their
dissensions still found its mouthpieces; but these, commonly, were
of the irresponsible firebrand type who had no stake in the country
save such as might best be served under cover of smoke. Thinking
men of either party saw the untena-bility of the idea and began,
however reluctantly, to declare the need of a strong and impartial
suzerain to give them security in the advantages already in their
possession; advantages which, they now saw clearly enough, had
their roots in the British presence and would be drowned in blood
on the day that presence was withdrawn.</p>

<blockquote>[10. For the list, see <i>Legislative Assembly
Debates,</i> Vol. VIII, Augu*t 18, 1926, p. 12.]</blockquote>

<p>The Summer Session of the Indian Legislative Assembly met in a
mood to talk reason. Said Maulvi Muhammad Yakub, a Muhammadan
member, speaking on the twenty-fourth day of August:[11]</p>

<blockquote>[11. <i>Ibid.,</i> August 24, 1926, pp.
280-3.]</blockquote>

<p class="quote">I do not agree with those who think that the
Government have a hand in fomenting communal riots and communal
feelings. I also do not think that the Government of India have
ever shown partiality towards any community in dealing with
communal matters.<br>
<br>
There can be no two opinions that communal bitterness...has now
assumed an all-India importance...<br>
<br>
Sir, we are fed up with these communal frictions, and the situation
has become so very difficult that we cannot enjoy our home life
happily, nor do our festivals bring any joy to us...Is not the time
ripe,...when we should ask the Government to come forward and help
us, since we could not solve the question ourselves?</p>

<p>A few months earlier such words could scarcely have been spoken
on that floor without rousing a flurry of rebuttal. Today not a
voice opposed them. Instead rose that king-pillar of orthodox
Hinduism, our old friend the Dewan Bahadur T. Rangachariar of
Madras, not to rail at an "alien government," not to accuse it of
clumsy or arrogant interference in Indian affairs, but to
acknowledge that[12]</p>

<blockquote>[12. <i>Legislative Assembly Debates,</i> August 24,
1925, pp. 283-4.]</blockquote>

<p class="quote">...facts are facts, and they have to be faced by
us like men...I admire the sincere spirit in which my Honourable
friend Maulvi Muhammed Yakub has come forward. He feels the
soreness of this disgraceful position...and I feel it likewise. I
am glad, and the whole country is glad, that His Excellency Lord
Irwin has taken it up in right earnest...We cannot achieve the
results which we have at heart without the co-operation of all
people, official and non-official alike. I want a majority of the
people whose hearts are really bent upon changing the
situation.</p>

<p>The doctrine of non-cooperation with the established Power led
nowhere, as all now see. The mystic doctrine of spiritual war, a
war of "soul-force," that uses the language of hate while
protesting theories of love, had logically and insistently
projected itself upon the material plane in the form of the
slaughter of men. The inability of individuals to subordinate
personal, family or clan interests and to hold together for
team-work, had been demonstrated. And the fact had been driven home
to the hilt that neither Hindu nor Muhamma-dan could think in terms
of the whole people.</p>

<p>For the moment, some of them see it. Can they hold the vision?
To have seen it at all marks gain. <a name="ch-26" id=

<h2>CHAPTER XXVI - THE HOLY CITY</h2>

<p>Edwin Arnold has written beautifully about Benares. Hundreds of
people have also written about Benares. Tourists, enraptured with
its river-front panorama, have exhausted their vocabulary in
admiration.</p>

<p>And small wonder, for the scene is beautiful, instinct with
color and grace and with that sense of souls' uplifting that
surrounds the high altar of any part of the human race.</p>

<p>Benares is the Sacred City of the Hindu world. Countless temples
adorn it, set like tiers of crowns above and among the broad
flights of stairs that ascend from the Ganges, Holy River. Chains
of yellow marigolds are stretched across that river to welcome
Mother Ganges as she comes. And as the worshipers, clad in long
robes of tender or brilliant colors, bearing their water-jars upon
their heads or shoulders, trail up and down the high gray steps,
they seem so like figures in the vision of a prophet of Israel that
one almost hears the song they sang as "they went up by the stairs
of the city of David, at the going up of the wall."</p>

<p>But my visit to Benares was made in the company of the Municipal
Health Officer, a man of whom no artist-soul is apt to think.</p>

<p>This gentleman is an Indian. Before taking up his present
duties, he made preparatory studies in America, in the enjoyment of
a Rockefeller Foundation Scholar, ship in Public Health. Without
attempting to convey an idea of his whole problem, one may indicate
here a few of its points.</p>

<p>The normal stationary population of Benares is about two hundred
thousand, of whom some thirty thousand are Brahmans connected with
the temples. In addition, two to three hundred thousand pilgrims
come yearly for transient stays. And upon special occasions, such
as an eclipse, four hundred thousand persons may pour into the city
for that day, to depart a few days later as swiftly as they
came.</p>

<p>To take care of all this humanity the Municipality allows its
chief Health Officer an annual sum equal to about ten thousand
dollars, which must cover his work in vaccination, registration of
births and deaths, and the handling of epidemics and infectious
diseases.</p>

<p>Much of his best work lies in watching the pilgrims as they
debark from the railroad trains, to catch cholera patients before
they disappear into the rabbit-warrens of the town. Let that
disappearance once be effected and the case will lie concealed
until a burst of epidemic announces the presence of the disease.
For, although the municipality pays the higher officials and the
foremen of the Public Health Department fairly well, it allows a
mere pittance to its menial staff, with the result that, if
contagion is reported and disinfection is ordered, the subordinates
harass the people for what they can wring from distress.</p>

<p>Benares is an old city. Some of its drains were built in the
sixteenth and seventeenth century. No one now knows their course
except that, wherever they start, their outlets give into the
river. Constructed of stone, their location is sometimes
disconcertingly revealed by the caving-in of their masonry beneath
a building or a street. Sometimes, silt-choked at the outlet, their
mouths have been unwittingly or unthinkingly sealed in the course
of river-wall repairs. Not a few still freely discharge their
thick[1] stream of house-sewage into the river, anywhere along its
humanity-teeming front. But most, having become semi-tight
cesspools, await the downpours of the rainy season, when their
suddenly swollen contents will push into the city's subsoil with
daily increasing force.</p>

<blockquote>[1. "Thick" in particular because of the little water
used in Indian houses.]</blockquote>

<p>The city stands on a bluff, her streets about seventy-five feet
above river level. The face of the bluff, for a distance of three
miles or more along the river front, is buttressed by stairs and by
high walls of stone. These, because of their continuity, back up
the subsoil water, which, from time to time, bursts the masonry and
seeps through into the river, all along its famous templed front.
There, among the worshiping drinkers and bathers, among the
high-born pilgrim ladies, the painted holy-men, the ash-pasted
<i>saddhus</i> and <i>yogis,</i> you may see it oozing and
trickling down from those long zigzag cracks that so mellow the
beauty of the venerable stones.</p>

<p>Against bitter religious opposition, the British, in 1905,
succeeded in getting a partial sewage system and water pipe-line
into the city. Its main pumping station is at the south end of the
town, not much habitation lying above it. The water is settled in a
tank, filtered, and then put into general distribution, the
Municipal Health Officer himself doing a weekly chemical and
bacteriological analysis from each filter.</p>

<p>But the devout will not drink this filtered water. Instead, they
go daily to the river, descend the stairs of some bathing-ghat,
scoop up a vesself ul in the midst of the bathers under the
seepage-cracked wall, and carry it home to quench the thirst of the
household. All warnings and protests of the Health Officer they
meet with supreme contempt.</p>

<p>"It lies not in the power of man to pollute the Ganges." And
"filtering Ganges water takes the holiness out," they reply,
firmly.</p>

<p>Now, whoever bathes in the Ganges at Benares and drinks Ganges
water there, having at the same time due regard to the needs of the
priests, may be cured of the worst disease that flesh is heir to.
Consequently upon Benares are deliberately focused all the maladies
of the Hindu millions. Again, whoever dies in Benares, goes
straight to heaven. Therefore endless sick, hopeless of cure, come
here to breathe their last, if possible, on the brink of the river
with their feet in the flood.</p>

<p>Many of the incidents connected with this tenet are exquisitely
beautiful and exalted in spirit. But the threat to public health
needs little emphasis.</p>

<p>One such has to do with the over-burdened burning-ghats.</p>

<p>The main burning-ghat lies directly in the middle of the
populous waterfront. "Nothing on earth can move it from there,"
says my conductor, "because the place is of particular sanctity. So
all I can do is to try to see that all bodies are completely
burned."</p>

<p>But complete burning takes a lot of wood. Not every heir will or
can face so heavy a cost. And the Indian-run municipality, thus
far, has been unable to interest itself in the matter to the extent
of giving an additional quantity of wood when necessary to complete
incineration.</p>

<p>"See those dogs nosing among the ashes. There--one has found a
piece!" said I to the doctor, as we stood looking on.</p>

<p>"Yes," he answered. "That happens often enough. For they burn
bodies here, sometimes rather incompletely, at all hours of day and
night. Still, if the dog hadn't got that bit, it would simply have
got into the river, to float down among the bathers. As the dead
babies do, in any case. No Hindu burns an infant. They merely toss
them into the stream."</p>

<p>There are no latrines along the water-front. The people prefer
to use the sandy places at the water's brink among the bathing
stairs. Thus and otherwise one typhoid or cholera carrier may,
during his stay, infect ten thousand persons. The river banks are
dried sewage. The river water is liquid sewage. The faithful
millions drink and bathe in the one, and spread out their clothes
to dry upon the other. Then in due time, having picked up what
germs they can, they go home over the length and breadth of India
to give them further currency, carrying jars of the precious water
to serve through the year.</p>

<p>Also, the beautiful and picturesque temples do their part. This
may be sufficiently indicated in the words of a distinguished
Brahman pathologist, educated in European universities and an
annual visitor to London and Paris. Said he, with deep feeling:</p>

<p>"The temples of Benares are as evil as the ooze of the
river-banks. I myself went within them to the point where one is
obliged to take off one's shoes, because of sanctity. Beyond lay
the shrines, rising out of mud, decaying food and human filth. I
would not walk in it. I said <i>No!</i> But hundreds of thousands
do take off their shoes, walk in, worship, walk out, and put back
their shoes upon their unwashed feet. And I, a Hindu and a doctor,
must bear witness to that!"</p>

<p>The position of Public Health Officer of Benares, one key to the
health of India, means so large and difficult a task that it would
seem to confer honor and distinction upon any man to whom it is
entrusted. The present incumbent appeared to be confronting his job
in a good spirit, determined to piece out his little means with his
wits. But I found in the attitude of an Indian brother doctor a
differing view. This man, also a Rockefeller Foundation scholar,
said: "That fellow has a rotten job."</p>

<p>"Why rotten?" I asked, sincerely surprised.</p>

<p>"Because it is so hard. But chiefly because of the indignity
that he, a Rockefeller scholar, should have to serve under a white
man. The Minister is an Indian, of course. But the immediate
superior, the Director of Public Health, is a Briton. It is a
miserable shame!"</p>

<p>Curiously enough, this remark was made while, with the speaker,
I was visiting an Indian attempt at sanitary self-help. The attempt
was not brilliant, but at least it was a beginning, and the workers
were simple, eager, unpretentious little folk hungry and thirsty
for encouragement. Seeing which hunger, our Rockefeller scholar,
now an official and to them a great luminary, slowly, thoroughly,
and without a glimmer of sympathy, impaled them on the
toasting-fork of his laughing scorn.</p>

<p>Other holy cities exist in India, other centers of pilgrimages.
Each, automatically, is a reservoir and a potential distributing
point of disease, demanding the utmost vigilance and the utmost
tact in handling.</p>

<p>But the public health problem presented by an ordinary Indian
city is stiff enough. Take, for example, Lahore. The European
section of the town has something about it of western America--all
of one age, new, roomy, airy, with certain of its good modern
buildings erected by the public spirit of that fine old Punjabi,
Sir Ganga Ram. But Kim's Lahore, the old Indian quarter, where the
crowds live and move, and in particular its bazaar, where the
crowds adore to congregate, is the danger-point that keeps the
Director of Health awake at night.</p>

<p>Streets about eight feet wide, twisting like earth worms after a
rain, straight up from whose edges rise solid lines of dwelling
houses sometimes several stories high. At their base, on either
side, a row of little open-fronted shops, their cottons, brasses,
holy pictures, embroideries, silks, grain-piles, jewelry, exposed
on their floors or walls. Many rickety wooden platforms, built of
intermittent slats, project from the front edge of the shop floors,
at street level, to the edge of the street. Close under these
platforms, on both sides of the road, runs an open gutter about a
foot wide. The gutter is in steady and open use as a public
latrine. Heaped on the slats of the wooden platforms, just escaping
the gutter, are messes of fried fish, rice cakes, cooked curry,
sticky sweetmeats, and other foods for sale. All the food-heaps lie
practically underfoot, exposed to every sort of accident, while
flies, dirty hands, the nosing of dogs, cows, bulls and sheep, and
scurrying rats constantly add their contributions; as do the babies
and children with sore eyes and skin diseases, pawing and rolling
in the midst of it all, enveloped in clouds of dust and of acrid
smoke.</p>

<p>And you must be careful, in walking, not to brush against the
wall of a house. For the latrines of the upper stories and of the
roofs drain down the outside of the houses either in leaking pipes
or else from small vent-holes in the walls, dripping and stringing
into the gutter slow streams that just clear the fried fish and the
lollypops.</p>

<p>Mr. Gandhi, whose early sojourn in England has influenced his
general point of view in more ways, perhaps, than he knows, has
repeatedly written on this subject. He says, for example:[2]</p>

<blockquote>[2. <i>Young India,</i> October 29, 1925, p.
371.]</blockquote>

<p class="quote">Some of the [Indian] national habits are bad
beyond description, and yet so ingrained as to defy all human
effort. Wherever I go this insanitation obtrudes itself upon my
gaze in some shape or another. In the Punjab and Sind, in total
disregard of the elementary laws of health we dirty our terraces
and roofs, breeding billions of disease-producing microbes and
founding colonies of flies. Down south we do not hesitate to dirty
our streets, and early in the morning it is impossible for any one
in whom the sense of decency is developed to walk through the
streets which are lined with people performing functions of nature
which are meant to be performed in seclusion and in spots which
human beings need not ordinarily tread. In Bengal the same tale in
varying form has to be told; the same pool in which people have
washed their dirt, their pots, and in which cattle have drunk,
supplies drinking water...These are not ignorant people; they are
not illiterate; many have travelled even beyond the borders of
India...No institution can handle this problem better and more
speedily than our Municipalities. They have...all the powers they
need in this direction, and they can get more if necessary. Only
the will is often wanting.</p>

<p>And again:[3]</p>

<blockquote>[3. <i>Ibid.,</i> November 19, 1925. Mr. Gandhi on "Our
Insanitation," p. 399. In its issue of January 21, 1926, <i>Young
India</i> all too clearly shows that the sanitary habits of the
body of Hindu political delegates just assembled at Cawnpore in the
Indian National Congress are identical with the worst that Mr.
Gandhi elsewhere describes.]</blockquote>

<p class="quote">Whilst the Government has to answer for a lot, I
know that the British officers are not responsible for our
insanitation. Indeed if we gave them free scope in this matter,
they would improve our habits at the point of the sword.</p>

<p>Mr. Gandhi's judgment of the attitude of Indian-ized municipal
governments was corroborated by my own observations in big and
little towns in many parts of India.</p>

<p>The city of Madras, for example, the third largest city in the
land, completed its present water system in 1914. The catchment
area, in the hills, includes several villages. The water, as it
reaches the city plant, is about as foul as water can be. By the
design of the system it is here passed through slow sand-filters
into a pure-water tank at the rate of 10,000,000 gallons a day.</p>

<p>But the population of Madras has increased and the capacity of
the plant is now 4,000,000 gallons short of the daily needs of the
town. Detailed plans for the construction of adequate new filters,
backed by British experts, have been laid before the Municipal
Council. But these sixty leaders and guardians of the public weal,
Indians all, have adopted a simpler scheme. As I saw and heard for
myself from the Indian Superintendent on the spot, they now filter
10,000,000 gallons of water a day, run it into the pure-water tank,
then add 4,000,000 gallons of unfiltered sewage, and dish the
mixture out, by pipes, to the citizens of the town.</p>

<p>In judging this performance, one must remember that it takes
longer to outgrow race thought and habits of life than it does to
learn English. The well-dressed man who speaks with an easy Oxford
accent may come from a village where, if they desire a new well,
they do today what their fathers did a thousand years ago; they
choose the site not by the slope of the land but by throwing a
bucket of water over a goat. The goat runs away. The people run
after. And where the goat first stops and shakes himself, though it
be in the middle of the main street, just there the new well is
dug. <a name="ch-27" id="ch-27"></a></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVII - THE WORLD-MENACE</h2>

<p>British India has half a million villages made of mud. Most of
them took all their mud from one spot, making thereby a
commensurate hole, and built themselves on the edge of the
hole.</p>

<p>The hole, at the first rains, filled with water and became the
village tank. Thenceforward forever, the village has bathed in its
tank, washed its clothes in its tank, washed its pots and its pans
in its tank, watered its cattle in its tank, drawn its cooking
water from its tank, served the calls of nature by its tank and
with the content of its tank has quenched its thirst. Being wholly
stagnant, the water breeds mosquitoes and grows steadily thicker in
substance as it evaporates between rain and rain. It is sometimes
quite beautiful, overgrown with lily-things and shaded by feathered
palms. It and its uses pretty generally insure the democratiza-tion
of any new germs introduced to the village, and its mosquitoes
spread malaria with an impartial beak--though not without some
aid.</p>

<p>Witness, small Bengali babies put out to lie in the buzzing
grass near the tank's edge.</p>

<p>"Why do you mothers plant your babies there to be eaten
alive?"</p>

<p>"Because if we protect our babies the gods will be jealous and
bring us all bad luck."</p>

<p>One of the most popular and most glorious gifts that a liberal
rich man can make to his own village is the digging of an extra
tank. One of the fondest dreams of the British Public Health
official is to get all tanks filled up.</p>

<p>Nobody knows the exact incidence of malaria in India, for
village vital statistics are, perforce, kept by primitive village
watchmen who put down to "fever" all deaths not due to snake-bite,
cholera, plague, a broken head or the few other things they
recognize. But a million deaths a year from malaria may be regarded
as a conservative estimate of India's loss by that malady.</p>

<p>Malaria originates in many places aside from tanks. There is,
for example, the water-front of the city of Bombay, needless and
deadly poison-trap for the sailors of the world. There are railway
embankments built without sufficient drainage outlets, asking for
remedy. There is the water-logged country in the Punjab; there is
the new farm-land of the United Provinces, cut out of the tiger
haunts of the Himalayan foot-hills--both by nature heavily
malarial, but both being ditched and drained as a part of the huge
agricultural irrigation schemes now under development by
Government.</p>

<p>Malaria, altogether, is one of the great and costly curses of
the land, not alone because of its huge death-rate but even more
because of the lowered physical and social conditions that it
produces, with their invitation to other forms of disease.</p>

<p>Under present conditions of Indianized control, govermental
anti-malarial work, like all other preventive sanitation, is badly
crippled. Yet it generally contrives to hold its own, though denied
the sinews of progress.</p>

<p>And one recognizes with satisfaction, here and there, a few
small volunteer seedlings springing up, strangers and aliens to the
soil. Preeminent among these is the Anti-Malaria Cooperative
Society of Bengal, an Indian organization now trying to bring
control of malaria into the lives of the people, through educating
the villagers in means of protecting their own health. Much praise
is due to the enthusiasm of its chief exponent, Rai Bahadur Dr. G.
C. Chatterjee, with his ardent coadjutors, Dr. A. N. Mitra and Babu
K. N. Banerjee. Not only are these gentlemen, whom I visited at
their center in Nimta, trying to do anti-malaria work, but also
they are raising funds to make available to the Bengali villagers
the services of Indian doctors properly trained in western
medicine.</p>

<p>Aside from its precious tank a village may have a well. The
depth of the wells averages from twenty to forty feet. Their
content is mainly surface seepage. A little round platform of
sun-dried brick usually encircles the well, a log lying across the
orifice. Squatting on that platform and on that log at all hours of
the day you may see villagers washing their clothes, taking their
baths, cleaning their teeth and rinsing their mouths, while the
water they use splashes back over their feet into the pit whence
they drew it.</p>

<p>Also, each person brings his own vessel in which to draw the
water he wants--an exceedingly dirty and dangerous vessel from a
doctor's point of view--which he lowers into the well with his own
old factotum rope. When he returns to his house, he carries his
vessel with him, filled with well-water for the family to
drink.</p>

<p>One of the great objectives of the British Sanitary
Administration is to put good wells into the villages and to
educate the people in their proper use. Now, not infrequently, one
finds such <i>pucca</i> wells. But, exactly as in the Philippines,
the people have a strong hankering for the ancestral type, and,
where they can, will usually leave the new and protected
water-source for their old accustomed squatting- and
gossiping-ground where they all innocently poison each other.</p>

<p>As for pumps, the obvious means to seal the wells and facilitate
haulage, some have been installed. But, as a rule, pumps are
impractical--for the reason that any bit of machinery is, to the
Indian, a thing to consume, not to use and to care for. When the
machine drops a nut or a washer, no one puts it back, and
thenceforth that machine is junk.</p>

<p>Now, this matter of Indian wells is of more than Indian
importance. For cholera is mainly a water-borne disease, and
"statistics show that certain provinces in British India are by far
the largest and most persistent centers of cholera infection in the
world."[1]</p>

<blockquote>[1. <i>The Prevalence of Epidemic Disease...in the Far
East,</i> Dr. F. Norman White, League of Nations, 1923, p.
24.]</blockquote>

<p>The malady is contracted by drinking water infected with the
fasces of cholera patients or cholera carriers, or from eating
uncooked or insufficiently cooked infected food. It finds its best
incubating grounds in &agrave; population of low vitality and
generally weak and unresisting condition.[2] There is a vaccine for
preventive, inoculation but, the disease once developed, no cure
<i>w</i> known. Outbreaks bring a mortality of from 15 to 90 per
cent., usually of about 40 per cent. The area of Lower Bengal and
the valley of the Ganges is, in India, the chief cholera center,
but "the disease is very gen-erally endemic in some degree
throughout the greate/ part of the whole [Indian]
peninsula."[3]</p>

<blockquote>[2. Cf. <i>Philippine Journal of Science,</i> 1914, Dr.
Victor G. Heiser.]</blockquote>

<blockquote>[3. <i>A Memoranda on the Epidemiology of Cholera,</i>
Major A. J. Russell, Director of Public Health in Madras
Presidency, League of Nations, 1925, which see, for the whole
topic.]</blockquote>

<p>Since the year 1817, ten pandemics of cholera have occurred. In
1893 the United States was attacked, and in this explosion the
speed of travel from East to West was more rapid than ever
before.[4]</p>

<blockquote>[4. <i>Recent Research on the Etiology of Cholera,</i>
E. D. W. Grieg, in <i>The Edinburgh Medical Journal,</i> July,
1919.]</blockquote>

<p>In ordinary circumstances, in places where the public water
supply is good and under scientific control, cholera is not to be
feared. But the great and radical changes of modern times bring
about rapid reverses of conditions; such, for example, as the
sudden pouring in the year 1920 of hundreds of thousands of
disease-sodden refugees out of Russia into Western Europe.</p>

<p>Without fear of the charge of alarmism, international Public
Health officers today question whether they can be sure that local
controls will always withstand unheralded attacks in force. With
that question in mind, they regard India's cholera as a national
problem of intense international import.</p>

<p>THE VILLAGE TANK</p>
</center>

<p>In estimating the safety of the United States from infection,
the element of "carriers" must be considered. Each epidemic
produces a crop of "carriers" whose power to spread the disease
lasts from one hundred and one days to permanency.[5] Moreover, the
existence of healthy carriers is conclusively proved. And India is
scarcely a month removed from New York or San Francisco.</p>

<blockquote>[5. E.D.W. Grieg in <i>Indian Journal of Medical
Research,</i> 1913; Vol. I, pp. 59-64.]</blockquote>

<p>"Whenever India's real condition becomes known," said an
American Public Health expert now in international service, "all
the civilized countries of the world will turn to the League of
Nations and demand protection against her."</p>

<p>Bengal, one of the worst cholera areas, is about the size of
Nebraska. It has a village population of over 43,500,000 persons,
living in 84,981 villages. In the year 1921, a mild cholera year,
the disease was reported from 11,592 of these villages, spread over
26 districts, the reported deaths totaling 80,547.[6] Imagine the
task of trying to inoculate 43,500,000 persons, scattered over such
an area, in advance of the hour of need; bearing always in mind the
fact that the virtue of a cholera preventive inoculation lasts only
ninety days. Imagine also the task of disinfecting all these
village wells, when first you must persuade, not compel, the
incredulous, always fatalistic and often resisting people to permit
the process.</p>

<blockquote>[6. <i>Statistical Abstract for British India, 1914-15
to 1923-24,</i> pp. <i>2</i> and 382; and <i>54th Annual Report of
the Director of Public Health of Bengal,</i> Appendix I, p.
xxviii.]</blockquote>

<p>In the winter of 1924-5 sporadic cases of cholera appeared in
the Indian state of Kashmir. The British authorities did what they
could to induce those of Kashmir to act, but the latter, Indian
fashion, could see no point in disturbing themselves about ills yet
only in bud. Consequently, in April, came an explosion, killing in
a single month 2 per cent, of the entire population of the State.
Across the border of British India, in the Punjab, the hasty
Indianization of the Public Health Service had already so far
proceeded that only one British officer remained in the department.
Result: for the first time in thirty years the deadly scourge
overflowed the Kashmir border and reaped a giant harvest among the
Punjabi peasantry.</p>

<p>In the normal course of events, however, the main danger source
for widespread cholera epidemics is the periodic concentration of
great masses of people in fairs and festivals and in pilgrimages to
holy cities. During the past twelve years or more, the British
sanitary control of the crowds, in transit and also in
concentration, where temporary latrines are built, pipe-lines for
water laid, wells chlorinated and doctors and guards stationed, has
been so efficient as greatly to lessen the risks. Of the
possibilities of the future the Kashmiri incident speaks.</p>

<p>Hookworm, an intestinal parasite, saps its victim's vitality,
eventually reducing him, body and mind, to a useless rag not worth
his keep to himself or any ont else. Hookworm is contracted by
walking with bare feet on ground contaminated with the fasces of
persons infected. The procedure against hookworm is (a) to have the
people use proper latrines, and (b) to have them wear shoes.</p>

<p>As Mr. Gandhi has shown, Hindus, anywhere, dispense with
latrines, but are not, beyond that, always greatly concerned as to
what they use. In one town I found from the municipal chairman that
latrines had been built obediently to the Health Officer's
specifications and desire; but the people, he said, were leaving
them strictly alone, preferring to do as they had always done,
using roads, alleys, gutters and their own floors.</p>

<p>This was in part because the town was short of out-castes and
therefore had no one to remove night-soil--a thing which no caste
man would do though he smothered in his own dirt; and in part
because it was easier so to observe the Hindu religious ritual
prescribed for the occasion concerned.[7] Villagers, in any case,
always use the open fields immediately surrounding their village,
fields over which they continually walk.</p>

<blockquote>[7. See <i>Hindu Manners, Customs and Ceremonies,</i>
pp. 237-40.</blockquote>

<p>To sum up in the words of Doctor Adiseshan, Indian, Assistant
Director of Public Health of Madras: "How are you to prevent
hookworm when people will not use latrines, and when no orthodox
Hindu, and certainly no woman, will consent to wear shoes?"</p>

<p>Under such circumstances it appears that, although the cure for
hookworm is well established, absolute, simple and cheap, it would
be an indefensible waste of public monies to administer that cure
to patients sur&laquo; to be immediately re-infected.</p>

<p>It is estimated that over 80 per cent, of the people of Madras
and 60 per cent, of those of Bengal, harbor hookworms. And in this
connection Dr. Andrew Bal-four makes an interesting calculation. As
to India, he says:[8]</p>

<blockquote>[8. <i>Health Problems of the Empire,</i> pp.
193-4.]</blockquote>

<p class="quote">A conservative estimate shows that 45,000,000
wage&raquo; earners in that country are infected with hookworm. In
1915 the Statistical Department calculated the average wage of an
able-bodied agricultural labourer in Bengal at 10 rupees
monthly...Assuming that the average yearly wage of the 45,000,000
infected labourers is 100 rupees each, these men are at present
earning Rs. 4,500,000,000 annually. Now the managers of tea estates
in the Darjeeling district estimate that the Rockefeller
anti-hookworm campaign there...has increased the labour efficiency
of the coolies from 25 to 50 pei cent.<br>
<br>
Suppose that in India generally only 10 per cent, increased
efficiency is achieved. Even so the Rs. 4,500,000,000
[$1,500,000,000] become Rs. 4,950,000,000 [$1,650,-000,000].</p>

<p>Bubonic plague was first introduced into India in 1896, coming
from China. Today India is the world's chief reservoir of
infection,[9] and has lost, since 1896, some 11,000,000 lives by
that cause alone. The case mortality is about 70 per cent.
<b>Of</b> pneumonic plague, which sometimes develops in conjunction
with the other form, only an occasional case survives.</p>

<blockquote>[9. <i>Prevalence of Epidemic Disease in the Far
East,</i> Dr. F. Norman White, p. 21.]</blockquote>

<p>Plague uncontrolled at its source may at any time become an
international scourge, a danger to which international health
officers are the more alive since latter-day observations continue
to show the disease breaking out in regions where its occurrence
has been unknown before.</p>

<p>Plague, unlike cholera, is not communicated by man to man, but
to man by fleas from the bodies of sick rats. The flea bites the
man and leaves a poisonous substance around the bite. Man,
scratching the bite, scratches the poison into his skin and the
deed is done. When plague breaks out in a village, the effective
procedure is to evacuate the village at once and to inoculate the
villagers with plague vaccine.</p>

<p>In most countries you simultaneously proceed to real control by
killing the rats. But. this, in a Hindu land, you cannot
effectively do, because of the religion.</p>

<p>The constant obstacle in the Public Health Officer's path is,
characteristically, a negative one--the utter apathy of the Indian
peoples, based on their fatalistic creed. The intermittent
obstacle, acute of latter years, is the political agent who runs
here and there among the villages, whispering that an evil
Government is bent on working harm. To such a pitch have these
persons from time to time wrought their victims, that the latter
have murdered the native health agent entrusted with the task of
getting them out of an infected site.</p>

<p>With repeated examples, however, of the results of following
Government's behests, a degree of improvement has taken place. In
some parts where plague has struck often, the people have begun to
evacuate of themselves, when rats begin to die, and to flock into
the nearest dispensary begging for inoculation. But in general the
darkness of their minds is still so deep that the agitator can
easily excite them to resistance, even to violence, by some tale of
wickedness afoot.</p>

<p>When the first Indian lady of the district can say to the
English lady doctor brought to her bedside: "Why should I show you
my tongue when the pain is so much lower down? And besides, if I
open my mouth like that a lot more devils will jump in"; or when
the chief landlord of the district will tie a great ape just beyond
claw-reach of his ten-day-old son and then torment the ape to fury
to make it snatch and snarl at the child, to frighten away the
demon that is giving him convulsions, what is to be expected of
the-little folk squatting by the tank?</p>

<p>In the winter of 1926 I went through a plague-infested district
in company with a British Public Health officer on tour. The first
village that we visited was a prosperous settlement of
grain-dealers--shopkeepers and money-lenders--the market town for
the surrounding farmers. Each house was stored with grain in jars
and bins, and rats swarmed. The rats had begun to die. Then two men
had died. And on that the British District Commissioner had ordered
the people out.</p>

<p>Now they were all gathered in a little temporary "straw village"
a few hundred yards beyond their town gate, there to await spring
and the end of the scourge. As the doctor, a Scotchman thirty years
in the Indian Medical Service, approached the encampment, the whole
lot, men, women and children, rushed forward to greet him and then
to ask advice:</p>

<p>"Sahib, if we build fires here to cook our food, and the wind
comes, it will blow sparks and burn these straw houses we have
made. What, then, shall we do to cook our food? Please
arrange."</p>

<p>"Build your fires over yonder, behind that mound."</p>

<p>"Ah, yes, Sahib, to be sure."</p>

<p>"Sahib, if while we sit here, outside our gates, bad folk creep
into our houses and steal our grain, what then?"</p>

<p>"Even so, is it not better that bad men die of the plague than
that the plague kills you? Also, you may set watchmen at a
distance."</p>

<p>"The Sahib is wise. Further: there is, in a tent near by, a
stranger of no merit who wishes to push medicine into our skins. Is
it good medicine? Shall we listen to him? And what is the right
price?"</p>

<p>"The man in the tent is sent by Government. The medicine is
necessary to all who wish to live. It is free medicine. There is no
price."</p>

<p>A pause, while the people exchange glances. Then the headman
speaks:</p>

<p>"It is well, indeed, that the Sahib came."</p>

<p>"It looks," says the doctor, as we move on, "as if my little
dispenser fellow had been squeezing those people for money before
inoculating them. They <i>will</i> do that! And then, if the people
won't satisfy them, they report that inoculation is refused. Except
in the case of soldiers and police, we have no authority to compel
inoculation. It is a risky business, this fighting wholesale death
with broken reeds!"</p>

<p>Later we find the "stranger of no merit" squatting in his tent,
a traveling dispenser of the Public Health Department trained and
charged to do minor surgery, well disinfection and plague
inoculation, to give simple medicines for simple ailments, to
lecture, and to show lantern slides on health propaganda. By his
own showing he had sat in this tent for a month.</p>

<p>"I call the people every day to be inoculated, but they refuse
to come forward," he complained. "'Plague-doctor,' they say, 'now
that <i>you</i> are here the plague <i>must</i> come!' and they
laugh at me. They are a backward and an ignorant people."</p>

<p>The doctor inspects his equipment. On the inner lid of his
plague box the dosage is written. Within are the serum tubes, the
needles, the disinfectant equipment, undisturbed. Also his medicine
chest--"Dyspepsia Powders," "Country Medicines," simple drugs in
tablets.</p>

<p>"Let me see your instruments," says the doctor. All are rusty,
several are broken and useless.</p>

<p>"You should have sent those in, each one as soon as you broke
it. You know it would have been replaced at once," says the doctor,
patiently. "Now you have nothing to work with."</p>

<p>"Ah, yes, I meant to send them. I forgot." <a name="ch-28" id=

<h2>CHAPTER XXVIII - "QUACKS WHOM WE KNOW"</h2>

<p>"It is better to sit than to walk, to lie down than to sit, to
sleep than to wake, and death is the best of all," says the Brahman
proverb.</p>

<p>Taking into consideration the points with which the preceding
chapter is concerned, the question naturally arises as to how the
Indian is affected by his own peculiar sanitary habits. That
question may be answered in the words of an American scientist now
studying in the country:</p>

<p>"From long consumption of diluted sewage they have actually
acquired a degree of immunity. Yet all of them are walking
menageries of intestinal parasites, which make a heavy drain upon
their systems and which inevitably tell when some infection, such
as pneumonia or influenza, comes along. Then the people die like
flies. They have no resistance."</p>

<p>These conditions, added to infant marriage, sexual recklessness
and venereal infections, further let down the bars to physical and
mental miseries; and here again one is driven to speculate as to
how peoples so living and so bred can have continued to exist.</p>

<p>A reply is thus couched by one of the most eminent of European
International Public Health authorities:</p>

<p>"It is a question of adaptation, and of the evolution of a
sub-grade of existence on which they now survive. The British are
to blame for the world-threat that they constitute. If the British
had not protected them, the virile races of the north would have
wiped them out."</p>

<p>The superior virility of the northern races--including the
Sikhs, and more especially the Pathans and other Muhammadan
stocks--is favored by their superior diet. These hardy out-door
folk are all large meat-eaters, and consume much milk and grain.
The diet of the southern Hindu has little in it to build or repair
tissue. He subsists mainly on sweets and carbo-hydrates, and, to
the degree that he is able, he leads a sedentary life. Diabetes is
often the incident that brings to its early close the career of the
southern Indian public man.[1]</p>

<blockquote>[1. For an extended exposition of this subject see
<i>The Protein Ele* ment in Nutrition,</i> Major D. McCay, I.M.S.,
London, Edward Arnold 1912.]</blockquote>

<p>Lieutenant-Colonel Christopher, I.M.S., Director of the Central
Research Institute of the Government of India, in a paper called
"What Disease Costs India," has said:[2]</p>

<blockquote>[2. <i>Indian Medical Gazette,</i> April, 1924, pp.
196-200.]</blockquote>

<p class="quote">The deaths in India annually number about
7,000,000, i.e., very nearly the population of greater London...Now
all men must die, but it is to be hoped that each will have a run
for his money...During the first year of life, the [Indian's]
expectation of life is...about twenty-three years. At the age of
five it is thirty-five years, the highest expectation at any
age."</p>

<p>And Colonel Christopher further points out that so heavy a
mortality inevitably indicates a background of widespread and
continuous sickness, of reduced productivity, of enhanced costs of
administration, and of penalized trade, whose combined tax upon the
resources of the country, though difficult to calculate, cannot but
be an enormous moral and economic burden to support, a heavy drag
upon prosperity.</p>

<p>For this great field of need the lack of means is always
conspicuous. For 1925-26, some of the provin-cial budgets showed
the following items:[3]</p>

<blockquote>[3] <i>Indian Y ear-Book, 1926,</i> pp. 89, 97, 107,
118.]</blockquote>

<pre>
                     Education   Public Health

Bombay Presidency   $6,959,700     964,700
Madras Presidency    6,211,100   1,054,500
United Provinces     5,713,000     493,700
Bengal               4,322,000     880,000
</pre>

<p>The open road to better conditions is clear, and, alas,
untrodden. One finger-post reads thus:[4]</p>

<blockquote>[4. <i>Statement Exhibiting the Moral and Material
Progress...of India During the Years 1923-24,</i> London, 1924, pp.
211-12.]</blockquote>

<p class="quote">The necessary preliminary to any satisfactory
advance...is the growth among the educated classes of a missionary
and humanitarian spirit which will lead them to consecrate time,
money and energy to the task of ameliorating the conditions in
which their less fortunate brethren live...India can never be
safeguarded from a disastrous death rate, punctuated by heavy
epidemics, until her people can be weaned from their tenacious
adherence to social observances which are as diametrically opposed
to public health as they are to economic prosperity.</p>

<p>But that humanitarian spirit does not today exist.</p>

<p>Curiously lucid contributions on this line come from Mr. Gandhi;
speaking as of Hindu medical men, he says:[5]</p>

<blockquote>[5. Mr. Gandhi's statements quoted in this chapter will
be found in his <i>Indian Home Rule,</i> Ganesh &amp; Co., Madras,
1924, pp. 61-2.]</blockquote>

<p class="quote">It is worth considering why we take up the
profession of medicine. It is certainly not taken up for the
purpose of serving humanity. We become doctors so that we may
obtain honours and riches.</p>

<p>After which he affirms:</p>

<p class="quote">European doctors are the worst of all.</p>

<p>Amplifying his accusation, Mr. Gandhi continues:</p>

<p class="quote">These [European] doctors violate our religious
instinct. Most of their medical preparations contain either animal
fat or spirituous liquors; both of these are tabooed by Hindu and
Mahomedans.</p>

<p>And again, more specifically:</p>

<p class="quote">I overeat, I have indigestion, I go to a doctor,
he gives me medicine. I am cured, I overeat again, and I take his
pills again. Had I not taken the pills in the first instance, I
would have suffered the punishment deserved by me, and I would not
have overeaten again...A continuance of a course of medicine must,
therefore, result in loss of control over the mind.</p>

<p>"In these circumstances," he concludes, "we are unfit to serve
the country." And therefore "to study European medicine is to
deepen our slavery."</p>

<p>Whatever may be thought of Mr. Gandhi's judgment, his sincerity
is not questioned. Holding such an opinion of the motives and value
of western medical men in India, it is scarcely surprising that, in
the period of his "non-cooperation" campaign against Government and
all its works, not excepting its educational efforts, he should
have exhorted medical and public health students to desert their
classes and to boycott their schools.</p>

<p>Boy-fashion, they did it--for a time--and at what a cost to
India!</p>

<p>The other side of this phase of Indian nationalism is its
enthusiasm for the Aruvedic or ancient Hindu system of medicine
under which a large part of the native population is today being
treated, more particularly in Bengal and in central and southern
India.</p>

<p>This system is held to have been handed down from the gods in
earliest times, and to be of spiritual and inspired nature. Some
hint of its quality may be gathered from an excerpt from the
Sushruta Samhita, one of the two venerable works on which the
system is based.[6]</p>

<blockquote>[6. Translation of Kaviraj Kunja Lal Bishagratna, p.
270.]</blockquote>

<p class="quote">The favourable or unfavourable termination of a
disease may be predicted from the appearance, speech, dress and
demeanour of the messenger sent to call a physician, or from the
nature of the asterism and the lunar phase marking the time of the
arrival, or from the direction of the wind blowing at the time, or
from the nature of omens seen by him on the road, or from the
posture or speech of the physician himself. A messenger belonging
to the same caste as the patient himself should be regarded as an
auspicious omen, whereas one from a different caste would indicate
a fatal or an unfavourable termination of the disease.</p>

<p>Several works on modern Aruvedic practice have been published.
These make the claim that the Sush-ruta anatomy and surgery of two
thousand years ago were far superior to those of modern western
science, and deduce that as Aruvedic methods have undergone no
serious change since that time, they must be practically perfect.
Says Sir Patrick Hehir:[7]</p>

<blockquote>[7.<i>The Medical Profession in India.</i>
Major-General Sir Patrick Hehir, I.M.S., Henry Frowde and Hodder
and Stoughton, London, 1923, p. 104.]</blockquote>

<p class="quote">One of the principles of the system is that
diseases are the result of the operations of evil spirits who have
to be pacified by various offerings and propitiated by
incantations. Regarding the diseases of children it is stated[8]
that these "are due to the action of certain spirits who were
belated in obtaining lucrative posts in the retinue of the
Destroyer and were compelled, to secure power, to tax sorrowing
parents, who might have committed any of the hundred-odd ritual
faults by afflicting their offspring." One searches in vain for
anything approaching definite and rational therapeutics in this
system. We have [here] in a <i>modern</i> Aruvedic work a complex
combination of drugs extolled as being able to cure such diverse
conditions as obesity and gonorrhea, and another extensive
combination alleged to effect a cure in all diseases of women
however caused.</p>

<blockquote>[8. Quoted from Kaviraj Nagendra Nath Sen Gupta, <i>The
System of Medicine,</i> 3 vols., Calcutta, 1909.]</blockquote>

<p>My personal enquiry into Aruvedic surgical cases Was limited to
two instances. The first was that of a little boy who walked into a
Madras Presidency hospital one day in 1925, carrying his own
forearm as a parcel, with a request to the British surgeon in
charge, from a well-known Aruvedic doctor, to sew the forearm in
place.</p>

<p>The history of this case was that the arm had sustained a
compound fracture, the bone sticking through the flesh in an open
wound. The Aruvedic doctor had first applied cow-dung to the open
wound and then had clapped on splints, which he bound tight with
strips of freshly-peeled tree-bark. The weather being hot and dry,
the bark had contracted rapidly and produced extreme pressure. The
circulation stopped, dry gangrene set in and the arm sloughed off
at the elbow. Seeing which, the Aruvedic man thought it time to
invoke the courtesies of the profession and to suggest the western
needle.</p>

<p>The second case occurred in 1926, in the same prov-ince. An
Aruvedic doctor attempted to operate according to his code upon a
man having an enlarged gland in the groin. Holding his patient
down, and without an anaesthetic, he opened the gland. As the knife
went in, the patient jumped, an artery was cut and the peritoneal
cavity slit open. The doctor, knowing no anatomy, then took his
patient to a near-by government dispensary. But there the little
dispensary man in charge, an Indian, out of sheer terror pushed the
risk away.</p>

<p>"I am not meant for this sort of thing," he protested. "I am
only meant for minor surgery. Take the man on to a hospital."</p>

<p>But before reaching the hospital the man died.</p>

<p>Action for manslaughter was brought by the police against the
Aruvedic physician. But an association of Indian doctors holding
western degrees, many of whom were in Government employ, defended
his case and paid the expenses. "Our fine old Indian system must
not be attacked," they said. Their lawyers first got the defendant
off on a technicality; and then secured the prosecution of the
little dispensary man for criminal delay.</p>

<p>The common arguments in favor of the old system are that it is
cheaper for the people, that it particularly suits Indian
constitutions and that it is of divine sanction and birth. Leaving
the last tenet aside, as not in the field of discussion, we find
that the cost of running an Aruvedic dispensary is much the same as
that of running a dispensary on western lines;[9] and that no
material difference has ever been discovered between white man and
brown, in the matter of reaction of medicines upon the system.</p>

<blockquote>[9. <i>The Medical Profession in India,</i> p.
116.]</blockquote>

<p>The Montagu-Chelmsford Reforms, however, have occasioned a great
recrudescence of native medicine. Provincial ministers dependent on
popular vote are prone to favor spending public money to erect
Aruvedic and Unani[10] colleges, hospitals and dispensaries. With
the Indian National Congress claiming that Aruvedic medicine is
"just as scientific as modern western medicine," with such men as
Sir Rabindranath Tagore, the poet, fervently declaring that
Aruvedic science surpasses anything the West can offer; and with
Swarajists in general pushing it forward on patriotic grounds, you
get the melancholy spectacle of the meager appropriations allotted
to medicine and public health, in this most disease-stricken of
lands, being heavily cut into to perpetuate a "science" on the same
level as the "voodoo doctoring" of the West Indian negro.</p>

<blockquote>[10. The ancient Arabic school of
medicine.]</blockquote>

<p>That the old native systems still exert a strong hold on the
imaginations of the masses cannot be questioned. Also, like the
voodoo doctors, they teach the use of a few good herbs. These two
points enable their practitioners to induce enough "cures" to keep
their prestige alive.</p>

<p>But once upon a time it chanced that Mr. Gandhi, having widely
and publicly announced that "hospitals are institutions for
propagating sin";[11] that "European doctors are the worst of all,"
and that "quacks whom we know are better than the doctors who put
on an air of humaneness,"[12] himself fell suddenly ill of a pain
in the side.</p>

<blockquote>[11. <i>Indian Home Rule,</i> p. 61.]</blockquote>

<blockquote>[12. <i>Ibid.,</i> p. <i>62.</i>]</blockquote>

<p>As he happened to be in prison at the time, a British surgeon of
the Indian Medical Service came straightway to see him.</p>

<p>"Mr. Gandhi," said the surgeon, as the incident was reported, "I
am sorry to have to tell you that you have appendicitis. If you
were my patient, I should operate at once. But you will probably
prefer to call in your Aruvedic physician."</p>

<p>Mr. Gandhi proved otherwise minded.</p>

<p>"I should prefer not to operate," pursued the surgeon, "because
in case the outcome should be unfortunate, all your friends will
lay it as a charge of malicious intent against us whose duty it is
to care for you."</p>

<p>"If you will only consent to operate," pleaded Mr. Gandhi, "I
will call in my friends, now, and explain to them that you do so at
my request."</p>

<p>So, Mr. Gandhi willfully went to an "institution for propagating
sin"; was operated upon by one of the "worst of all," an officer of
the Indian Medical Service, and was attentively nursed through
convalescence by an English Sister whom he is understood to have
thought after all rather a useful sort of person. <a name="ch-29"

<h2>CHAPTER XXIX - PSYCHOLOGICAL GLIMPSES THROUGH THE ECONOMIC
LENS</h2>

<p>The welfare of any people, we are wont to agree, must finally
rest upon economic foundations. In the foregoing pages certain
aspects of economic conditions in India have been indicated. To
these indications I should like now to add a few more, disclaiming
any pretense that they constitute a survey, and offering them
merely for what they are worth as scattering observations made in
the living field, entirely non-political both in character and in
purpose.</p>

<p>The Indian, aside from his grievances earlier described, has
other explanations of what he calls his depressed status, in large
part covering them with the elastic title of "economic drains" upon
the country. Compared with the matters already handled, these
considerations seem superficial, serving mainly to befog the issue.
The principal drains, as they appear to me, have been shown in the
body of this book. But the Indian native politician's category
comprises none of them. He speaks, instead, under such headings as
cotton, tea, interest on Government bonds, export of grain, army
maintenance, and the pay of British Civil Servants in India.</p>

<p>The attempt carefully to examine these or any comparable point
with the Indian intelligentsia is likely to end in disappointment
and a web of dialectics--for the reason that, as the question grows
close, the Indian, as a rule, simply drops it and shifts to another
ground where, for the moment, he has more elbow-room. To touch
briefly on the items just enumerated will, however, illustrate his
mode of thought.</p>

<p>Of cotton, his persistent statement is that the country's raw
crop, selfishly cornered, is sent to England to give employment to
Lancashire spinners, and then, brought back as cloth, is forced
upon Indian purchasers.</p>

<p>The facts are: (a) The English market stands sixth on the list
of purchasers of the Indian cotton crop.[1] (b) Indian cotton,
being of poor quality, irregular, short of staple and persistently
tampered with, to make weight, does not meet the requirements of
English cotton cloth manufacturers, (c) The cotton for the looms of
Lancashire is supplied from America and the Sudan, (d) The little
Indian cotton used in the United Kingdom goes chiefly to making
lamp-wicks, cleaning cloths and other low-grade fabrics.</p>

<blockquote>[1. See Appendix <a href="#app-IIIA">III
A</a>.]</blockquote>

<p>As affecting the present status of India's cotton import trade,
two mutually countervailing influences must be mentioned: On the
one hand stands the recent handling by Government of the old excise
duty on Indian-milled cotton goods--an imposition which no Briton
today defends; that excise duty is now wiped out, and its
disappearance would naturally serve to diminish importations and to
stimulate sales of home manufacture. On the other hand stand the
facts that the people of India acquire, year by year, a little more
money to spend and a little more habit of spending it 5 that they
like fine cloths; and that the cloth from Indian mills is mostly
coarse. Therefore, in spite of free markets, in spite of Japan's
growing competition in fine goods, in spite of Mr. Gandhi's cottage
spinning campaign and its rough product, India still chooses to
indulge in a considerable amount of Lancashire's sheer fabrics.</p>

<p>Government, meantime, has been sparing no pains to improve the
quality of the cotton crop. In the endeavor to induce the growers
to put more intelligence into the work, experimental farms and
model stations have been established in the cotton areas,
inspectional teaching has been set up, and improved implements[2]
and good seed[3] provided, with an active propaganda as to the
feasibility of higher prices.</p>

<blockquote>[2. Originally imported from America, but now made by
Indian labor jn the Government agricultural stations.]</blockquote>

<blockquote>[3. From American stock.]</blockquote>

<p>"India is actually a better cotton country than is the United
States," an American authority has said, "but the people will not
put their backs into the work, and the Swaraj politician does what
he can to discourage improved production, on the ground that 'India
must not help England by growing cotton that Lancashire will
use.'"</p>

<p>Whether unaware or regardless of the facts just recounted, the
foremost of Indian politicians repeatedly assured me that "England
takes our raw cotton away tc give work to her own unemployed,
brings the cloth back here and foists it upon us. So all the profit
is hers and India is robbed. No country can stand such a
drain."</p>

<p>"But America raises cotton, some of which England buys, makes
into cloth and sells to America again. We gladly sell to our best
bidders, and we buy where we find what we want. Also, we make some
cloth ourselves. Where is the difference," I asked, "between your
case and America's?"</p>

<p>"But consider the question of tea," replies the Indian economist
quickly. "We raise great crops of tea, and almost the whole is
swept out of India--another exhausting drain upon the country."</p>

<p>"Do you sell your tea, or give it away?"</p>

<p>"Ah, yes--but the <i>tea,</i> you perceive, is <i>gone"</i></p>

<p>The third "drain" upon the country, as named above, is the
interest upon Government's Public Utility bonds, paid to London.
The caliber of the complaint may briefly be shown through the
single instance of railways.</p>

<p>The first line of railway in India was finished in 1853. At the
end of March, 1924, India had a total length of 38,039 miles of
open system,[4] which in 1925 carried over four and a half times as
many passengers per mile of steel as did the railways of the United
States.</p>

<blockquote>[4. <i>Statistical Abstract,</i> <a href="#page413">p.
413</a>. See also <a href="#app-IIIB">Appendix III
B</a>.]</blockquote>

<p>Taking the respective viewpoints of Americans and of Indians in
the matter now in hand, we get further light on the Indian
economist. When America built her railways, she had not sufficient
means to do so without borrowing. Consequently she borrowed from
Europe, largely from Great Britain, about half the money that built
her railway system, well content to pay what it cost in view of
benefits expected from the opening of the country. These costs, in
the normal course, continued until about 1914. When India built her
railways, she also failed to find the money at home; yet in her
case not because money was lacking, but because Indian capitalists
would lend only at huge rates of interest. Consequently India
borrowed from her cheapest market, London, practically all the
money that built her railways, paying from 2.5 to 5 per cent., with
an average of 3.5 per cent, on the loans--the lowest rates that the
world knows.</p>

<p>It is the payment of the annual interest on these loans that the
Indian critic is constantly describing as an insupportable
grievance, "a drain" of the country's resources.</p>

<p>But the net profits to the Government of India brought in by the
railways after payment of interest, sinking funds, annuity charges,
etc., were, in 1924-25, $58,736,000.[5]</p>

<blockquote>[5. <i>Statesman's Year Book,</i> 1926, p.
139.]</blockquote>

<p>Mr. Gandhi's views on railways, being a conspicuous feature of
his anti-British propaganda, may be noticed here:[6]</p>

<blockquote>[6. <i>Indian Home Rule,</i> pp. 45-8.]</blockquote>

<p class="quote">Good travels at a snail's pace--it can, therefore,
have little to do with the railways. Those who want to do
good...are not in a hurry...But evil has wings...So the railways
can become a distributing agency for the evil one only. It may be a
debatable matter whether railways spread famines, but it is beyond
dispute that they propagate evil...God set a limit to man's
locomotive ambition in the construction of his body. Man
immediately proceeded to discover means of over-riding the
limit...Railways are a most dangerous institution.</p>

<p>Yet Mr. Gandhi himself sets the example of braving that danger,
in his many political tours about the country. And, despite his
doubts on the point, one effect of the existence of the railroads
has certainly been to wipe out the mortal terror of famine in
India. Whereas in the old days that threat hung always over the
land, waiting only the failure of a monsoon to reap its human
harvest, deaths from this cause are now almost unknown; because
Government's systematized famine scheme is sustained by means to
transport (a) men from famine areas to areas where labor is wanted,
and (b) food and fodder whence both exist in plenty to places
where, to save life, both are needed.</p>

<p>Beyond the railheads runs the British-built network of good
highroads, speeding motor traffic where bullock carts alone used to
creep and wallow.</p>

<p>"And every time I think of famine and the desperate work and the
wholesale death it used to mean," said one old Deputy District
Commissioner, "I say, 'God bless Henry Ford!'"</p>

<p>It is scarcely necessary to point out the further practical uses
of the railways, whether in equalization of prices, in opening of
markets, or in development of trade with its consequent increase of
individual prosperity and of Government revenues.</p>

<p>Turning now to the fourth item listed for consideration, one
finds Mr. Gandhi and other Indian critics pointing to the
exportation of grain from a country where many regions are from
time to time short of food, as an intolerable "drain" due to
administrative ill will, greed, or mismanagement. However
elaborately this idea is clothed, its bare bones tell a plain
story.</p>

<p>No man sells grain today that he needs today to put into his
mouth. If he sells grain, it is to get something that he holds more
necessary or more desirable. Government, in the last thirty years,
has created great areas of rich grain land where only desert
existed before. Millions of Indians are raising on these lands
quantities of grain far beyond their own consuming power or that of
the regions in which they live. Roads, railways, and ships have
brought the markets of the world to their doors. They sell to the
highest bidder. If Government should clap an export duty on their
produce to keep it at home, what shame would then be cried upon the
despot whose jealous grip denied to labor the fruit of its toil!
Grain travels to and from India as it does everywhere else--in
obedience to the currents of world trade.</p>

<p>For our fifth point: The cost of the army is always alleged to
be monstrous in proportion to the country's revenue. "The army is
too big," says the politician.</p>

<p>"Is it too big for the work it has to do in keeping your safety
and peace?"</p>

<p>"I don't know. I have not looked into that," is the usual reply.
"But anyway, it costs an outrageous percentage of India's
revenue."</p>

<p>In presenting this view of the subject it is the custom to speak
as of the Indian central budget only, which gives a figure of
expenditure on defense amounting to about 59 per cent. of the
total. To arrive at a just statement, the provincial budgets, which
are en-tirely free from defense items, must be reckoned in; lit is
then found that the proportion of governmental revenues assigned to
defense is about 30 per cent.[7] The Indian peoples are taxed about
$.58 per capita or the defense of their country.[8]</p>

<blockquote>[7. <i>Defence of India,</i> "Arthur Vincent," Humphrey
Milford, Oxford University Press, 1922, p. 04.]</blockquote>

<blockquote>[8. <i>India in 1924-25,</i> p. 31.]</blockquote>

<p>The people of Great Britain pay about $13 per capita on that
count, the people of America about $5; those of Japan pay for
defense six times as much as the people of India, implying a per
capita tax on that score of over $3.50.[9]</p>

<blockquote>[9. <i>The Statesman's Year Book,</i> 1926, p.
xix.]</blockquote>

<p>India possesses 1,400 miles of constantly dangerous frontier,
always actively threatened, and three times in the last century
ablaze with open war. She also has an enormous and extremely
vulnerable coast line, which without extra cost to her is defended
by the British fleet. And finally, she has a population which, time
and again, in its sudden outbursts of internecine fury, needs
protection against itself. Taxes are light because the people are
poor. Revenues are small because taxes are light. Costs of national
defense look large because revenues are small. The maintenance of
order and peace is the prime duty of Government. On that duty any
Government must spend what it must. If the total revenue be small,
the less is left for other activities. The obvious solution is to
increase the revenue.[10]</p>

<blockquote>[10. See <a href="#app-IIIC">Appendix III
C</a>]</blockquote>

<p>But the great weakness in the Indian's reasoning that the costs
of the army constitute a "drain" out of India of India's wealth
lies in the fact that practically all the pay of the Army stays in
India. The pay of the great body of troops, which is Indian,
naturally does so. That part of British soldiers' pay that goes
home to Britain is scarcely large enough to waste words upon.
British Army officers in India in practically all cases are
spending their private means there, over and above their pay.
Equipment and stores, by order, are bought in India whenever Indian
firms can provide them in suitable quality and at a reasonable
competitive price. Otherwise they are bought abroad, by the High
Commissioner for India stationed in London, who is himself an
Indian. In this matter of governmental purchase of stores, in
whatever department, a frequent disparity exists between the actual
records and the statements of the Indian politicians who, as my own
research proved, are wont to suit their allegations to their
convenience rather than to the facts.</p>

<p>The sixth conspicuous channel of "drain" upon the country's
resources is the pay of the British members of the Indian Civil
Service. Here the relevant facts are that in the beginning it was
necessary to offer good pay to get good men to take on the job; and
that, with all the upward rush of prices in the last quarter
century, no comparable increase has taken place in that pay. India,
today, is a costly place to live in, as any sojourner will find.
She is not a white man's country, in the sense that she frequently
robs him of his health if not of his life. In committing himself to
her service he must resign all home associations and privileges for
long periods of time. If he marries he must part early with his
children, and maintain them separated from their parents by a
journey three weeks long. When he retires, after twenty-five to
thirty-five years of active service, his pension of &pound;1,000
per annum loses 25 per cent, by taxes; and, last but not least, the
salaries paid to all but the few highest officials are large only
from the point of view of the Indian, with his greatly differing
standard of living which few white men would accept. The married
British Civil Servant in India, if he has children to educate and
no private resources on which to draw, must live with watchful
economy to make both ends meet. And he can save little or nothing
for a rainy day.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, the unhappy peoples of India, says Sir M.
Visvesvaraya,[11] speaking as does many another prominent Indian,
"have not only to feed and clothe themselves, but also to support
one of the costliest administrations in the world."</p>

<blockquote>[11. <i>Reconstructing India,</i> p. 7.]</blockquote>

<p>To dissect this statement were, after one glance at the Tax
Table, a waste of time. "One of the costliest administrations in
the world" cannot be supported from such resources. Including land
revenue, which is properly to be listed as rental rather than
taxation, the total per capita tax paid by the inhabitants of
British India in 1923-24 was five and a half rupees[12] or nearly
$1.82 in United States currency at the then rate of exchange. The
per capita taxation in the Philippines for the year 1923, as shown
in the Annual Report of the Insular Auditor, was $3.50.</p>

<blockquote>[12. <i>Statistical Abstract, 1914-15 to 1923-24,</i>
p. 190.]</blockquote>

<p>Even such a sum may seem large, in comparison with the general
poverty of the Indian people. Costs of Government reduced to the
irreducible are still high to a pauper. But observers are not
wanting who believe that among the causes of India's poverty is
this very lightness of taxation, which deprives the Administration
of means with which to work.</p>

<p>Now, leaving matters of argument, let us face about and look at
indisputable wastages of India's vital resources. The major
channels have been shown in earlier pages, but these leave
untouched a list of points only second in importance, such as caste
marriage costs, the usurer, the hoarding of treasure, and
mendicancy.</p>

<p>Caste laws strictly limit the range of possible marriages,
sometimes even to the confines of half-a-dozen families, so that,
despite his dread of sonlessness, a man may be forced to wait till
he is old for the birth of a girl within the circle wherein he may
marry,[13] and then may be forced to pay ruinously to secure her.
Or again, there is such a scramble for husbands of right caste
that, rather than sacrifice their own souls by leaving a girl
unmarried, fathers strain their credit to the snapping point to
secure eligible matches for their daughters.</p>

<blockquote>[13. <i>Reconstructing India,</i> Visvesvaraya, p.
241.]</blockquote>

<p>In Bengal, of late years, several cases have become public of
girls committing suicide at the approach of puberty, to save their
fathers the crushing burden of their marriage dowry.[14] And the
chorus of praise evoked from Bengal youth by this act has
stimulated further self-immolations. Nor do the father's finances
greatly affect the case. Though a man prosper and take in much
money, marriages in his family still pull him down to ruin, for the
reason that pride and custom forever urge him ahead of his
means.</p>

<blockquote>[14. <i>Legislative Assembly Debates,</i> 1922, Vol.
II, Part II, p. 1811.]</blockquote>

<p>Marriage expenses and funeral expenses, love of litigation,
thriftlessness and crop failures are among the chief roads that
lead the Indian into debt. The Indian money-lender, or
<i>bania,</i> is the same man as the usurer of the Philippines.
And, exactly as in the Philippines, the average Indian having a
little money laid by, even though he be not a <i>bania</i> by caste
and calling, will, if he be minded to lend, lend to his neighbors
at 33 per cent, and up, rather than to Government at a miserable
3.5 per cent, so that Government may build him a railway. Let the
silly folk in London do that.</p>

<p>The <i>bania</i> is the man who, foreseeing a short crop,
corners all the grain in his region, and at sowing-time sells
seed-grain to his neighbors at 200 per cent, profit, taking the
coming crop as security.</p>

<p>Once in debt to a <i>bania,</i> few escape. Clothing, oxen, and
all purchased necessities are bought of the same wise old spider.
Compound interest rolls up in the good old way as the years pass,
and posterity limps under the load unto the third and fourth
generation.</p>

<p>"The assumption that debt is due to poverty cannot be
entertained. Debt is due to credit and credit depends upon
prosperity and not poverty," writes Cal-vert. Credit, in India, is
the creation of the British Government by the establishment of
peace and security of property, coupled with public works that
increase production and the value of land. The <i>bania</i> in his
fullest glory is therefore a by-product of British rule. In the
Punjab, rich among provinces, we find him in his paradise, 40,000
strong, collecting from the people annual interest equaling nearly
three times the total sum that they annually pay to
Government.[15]</p>

<blockquote>[15. See <a href="#app-IIID">Appendix III
D</a>.]</blockquote>

<p>Everywhere, whether openly or covertly, the usurer opposes the
education of the people, because a man who can read will not sign
the sort of paper by which the <i>bania</i> holds his slave, and a
man who can figure wilJ know when his debt is cleared. As two
Indian members of the profession warmly told me, the <i>bania,</i>
hates "this meddlesome and unsympathetic foreign government that
has introduced a system of cooperative credit, which, wherever a
Briton directs it, is ruining our good old indigenous banking
business. Moreover, not content even with that mischief, it is
pushing in night schools and adult-education schemes to upset the
people's mind."</p>

<p>Intimately powerful as he is throughout the country, the
<i>bania</i> exercises a strong undercurrent of influence in the
Swarajist party, making it generally hostile to labor interests and
currency reforms.</p>

<p>A third actual drain upon prosperity, seldom advertised, yet
affecting not only India but the rest of the world, is India's
disposition of bullion. Since the early days of the Roman Empire,
western economists have been troubled over India's intake of
precious metals, rather than of foreign goods, in payment for her
produce. These metals she has always swallowed up.[16]</p>

<blockquote>[16. See <a href="#app-IIIE">Appendix III
E</a>.]</blockquote>

<p>In 1889 it was estimated that India held imprisoned "a stock of
gold bullion wholly useless for commercial purpose and increasing
at the rate of nearly 3 million sterling [$14,000,000] annually, of
the value of not less than two hundred and seventy million pounds
sterling [$1,312,000,000]."[17] This ever-accumulating treasure
lies in the hands of all conditions and orders of men, from the
poorest laborer to the most eminent prince.</p>

<blockquote>[17. <i>The Industrial Competition of Asia. An Inquiry
into the Influence of Currency on the Commerce of the Empire in the
East,</i> Clar-mont John Daniell. Kegan Paul, Trench, Trubner and
Co., Ltd., London, 1890, p. 249.]</blockquote>

<p>In 1927, Mr. D. C. Bliss, American Trade Commissioner in Bombay,
wrote of treasure in India:[18]</p>

<blockquote>[18. <i>The Bombay Bullion Market,</i> Don C. Bliss,
Jr., U. S. Bureau of Foreign and Domestic Commerce, Trade
Information Bulletin No-457, pp. 5-6.]</blockquote>

<p class="quote">Vast reserves have been accumulated,...estimated
as amounting to more than five billion dollars--but they have been
jealously hoarded in the form of unproductive precious metals. Put
to productive uses, or loaned out in the world's money-markets,
they would suffice to make India one of the powerful nations of the
world. The traditional "wealth of the Indies" is there, but in such
a form that it yields nothing to its possessors.</p>

<p>From time immemorial it has been considered improper for any
great heir to draw upon his father's hoard of precious treasure and
equally improper for him not to build up a hoard of his own. The
late Nyzam of Hyderabad collected in his vaults jewels to immense
values. The present prince is understood to prefer bullion, of
which his own accumulations are said to reach to between 150 and
200 million dollars. Equally, every peasant in the land secretly
buries silver in the earth, and loads it upon his women's necks and
wrists and ankles, for safe-keeping. Forty per cent, of the world's
total gold production, and 30 per cent, of the world's silver, is
thus annually absorbed by India. None of this gold is coined or
goes into currency, and, says Mr. Bliss, of silver: "All of the
absorption is in response to the demand for bullion
for...ornamental uses." "Undoubtedly," he adds, "an enormous
quantity of bullion has been buried and forgotten." The man heavily
in debt to the <i>bania</i> commonly possesses a store of hidden
coin, yet continues borrowing. This custom rests on the idea of
being prepared for the rainy day and on a profound distrust of the
human element in any scheme of banking.</p>

<p>The tendency of the world's gold and silver to concentrate in
India and there to disappear from action tells its own story. On
the one hand, an essentially poor country could not bring such a
thing about. On the other hand, no country that buries its wealth
ana then lies down and. sleeps on the grave can be really
prosperous.</p>

<p>Turning now to the drain incurred through robbing the soil:
India, as we know, is preeminently an agricultural country, But she
has never fertilized her soil. Continually taking from it, she puts
nothing back--and yet laments the thinness of her crops. Having
bu-. little firewood, she burns her cow-dung for fuel. And, being
under religious taboo against the handling of dead animal
substance, the Hindu majority will not use for bone-manure the
cattle bones of which they have such store, but, instead, sell them
to be exported to foreign parts. And they cultivate with a little
wooden plow that barely scratches the surface of the ground.</p>

<p>Suppose that, still respecting the taboo, they used some of
their idle buried cash, or the interest it would bring, put to
work, to buy fertilizer and machinery; what far-reaching profit
might not that one step effect, did but their general way of life
permit enduring prosperity!</p>

<p>The fragmentation of property through the ancient laws of
inheritance, until a man's holding is so split up into absurdly
shaped and widely scattered splinters that its useful cultivation
is impossible, is another formidable obstacle to the people's
welfare. Those interested in the subject will find it well
developed in Cal-vert's <i>Wealth and Welfare of the Punjab,</i>
where also is treated the great restriction of potential revenue
through lack of women's work.[19]</p>

<blockquote>[19. See <a href="#app-IIIF">Appendix III
F</a>.]</blockquote>

<p>And here, too, though at cost of repetition, must be recalled
the enormous dead loss incurred by the country through the
maintenance of its seventy-odd millions of unprofitable cattle,
which, because of religious inhibitions, may but rarely contribute
even hides and bones to the country's profit.</p>

<p>Last on our list of draughts upon the wealth of India, we find
the item of mendicancy.</p>

<p>The Brahmanic code commends renunciation of active life and the
taking up of a life of contemplation and beggary as the proper
terminal half of man's earthly career. At the same time it teaches
that he who gives to the beggar is in reality a debtor to that
beggar, in that he who receives affords the giver a priceless
opportunity to establish credit in the life to come.</p>

<p>Therefore neither shame nor gratitude attaches to the beggar's
part.[20]</p>

<blockquote>[20. See <a href="#app-IIIG">Appendix III
G</a>.]</blockquote>

<p>In the Indian Legislative Assembly, on February 2, 1926, Sir
Hari Singh Gour said:[2l]</p>

<blockquote>[21. <i>Legislative Assembly Debates,</i> Vol. VII, No.
8.]</blockquote>

<p>In the last Census Report...we find recorded as beggars,
vagrants, witches and wizards ...altogether 58 lakhs
[5,800,000]...But in point of fact their number is still greater as
to that class must be added saints and fakirs who live by
beggary.</p>

<p>Government's estimate of 1921 put the saints and fakirs then
living by beggary at 1,452,174.</p>

<p>Now and again these privileged ones gather in groups of hundreds
and stream, across country feeding off the populace as they go. The
disciple that follows each holy man holds out his master's begging
bowl. And rarely is he denied. One sees their encampments in moving
about the country. One meets them on the road, almost or quite
naked except for their coat of ashes, their enormous mops of long
snarled hair bleached to the color of ginger, their eyes reddened
with drugs. At great fairs they turn out in multitudes. A competent
witness informed me that at the latest twelfth-year fair of Madras,
the two and a half miles of road from the city to the bathing place
was lined on both sides with religious beggars sitting shoulder to
shoulder, each with an attendant squatting in front, calling out
his master's claims to alms.</p>

<p>And now we come to a more obscure question, that of the present
economic status of the peoples in comparison with their condition
in past eras. Mr. Gandhi and his school affirm that the peoples of
India have been growing steadily poorer and more miserable, as a
result of British rule. To form a close surmise of the facts is
difficult indeed. The masses have, as a whole, little ambition to
raise or to change actual living conditions. Their minds as a rule
do not turn to the accumulation of things. They are content with
their mud huts. Given windows and chimneys, they stop them up.
Given ample space, they crowd in a closet. Rather than keep the
house in repair, they let the rains wash it away, building a new
one when the old is gone. Rather than work harder for more food,
they prefer their ancient measure of leisure and just enough food
for the day.[22]</p>

<blockquote>[22. <i>Census of 1921,</i> Vol. I, Part I, p.
54.]</blockquote>

<p>But their margin of safety is indubitably greater, their power
of resistance to calamity increased, and, allegations to the
contrary notwithstanding, means of enlarging their income lie at
all times, now, within their hands. In just such measure as desire
for material advance awakens, one sees this demonstrated in
individual lives.[23] The question whether or not such desire is
good underlies one of the prime differences between eastern and
western thought and practice.</p>

<blockquote>[23. See <a href="#app-IIIH">Appendix III
H</a>.]</blockquote>

<p>Now in assigning value to these factors, one must remember that
the soil of India is today supporting the pressure of over
54,000,000 more human beings than it sustained fifty years ago,
plus an increase of 20 per cent.[24]</p>

<blockquote>[24. <i>Census of India, 1921,</i> pp. 7, 48. These
figures of increase are reached after allowing for the factor of
population added by annex' tion of territory.]</blockquote>

<p>This, again, is a result of freedom from wars and disorders and
from killing famines; of the checking of epidemics; and of the
multiplied production of food--all elements bound to produce ever
greater effect as essential features of an established government.
And the prospects it unfolds, of sheer volume of humanity piling up
as the decades pass, is staggering. For, deprived of infanticide,
of <i>suttee,</i> and of her other native escape-valves, yet still
clinging to early marriage and unlimited propagation, India stands
today at that point of social development where population is
controlled by disease, and disease only.[25]</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXX - CONCLUSION</h2>

<p>The preceding chapters of this book state living facts of India
today. They can easily be denied, but they cannot be disproved or
shaken. That there are other facts, other columns of statistics,
other angles left untouched by this research I do not contest.</p>

<p>Neither do I wish to imply that some of the most unflattering
things here affirmed of India are without counterpart in character
and tendency, if not in degree, in certain sections of our western
life. But India has carried the principles of egocentricity and of
a materialism called spirituality to a further and wider conclusion
than has the West. The results, in the individual, the family and
the race, are only the more noteworthy. For they cast a spotlight
toward the end of that road.</p>

<p>Some few Indians will take plain speech as it is meant--as the
faithful wounds of a friend; far more will be hurt at heart. Would
that this task of truth-telling might prove so radically performed
that all shock of resentment were finally absorbed in it, and that
there need be no further waste of life and time for lack of a
challenge and a declaration! <a name="appendix" id=

<h3>Appendix I - MEDICAL EVIDENCE</h3>

<p>In the Indian Legislative Assembly of 1922, the following
evidence, introduced from the floor of the House as descriptive of
the conditions of the day, aroused neither question nor opposition
from any one of the assembled Indian legislators. The fact that,
although thirty-one years old, it still remained beyond challenge,
carries a contributing significance. The evidence submitted
consists of a list, compiled in 1891 by the western women doctors
then practicing in India, and by them laid before the Viceroy, with
a petition for intervention on behalf of the children of India. It
is made up, they affirm, entirely of instances that have come under
the hands of one or another of their own number, and whose like are
continually revealed in their ordinary professional experience.</p>

<p>A.--Aged 9. Day after marriage. Left femur dislocated, pelvis
crushed out of shape, flesh hanging in shreds.</p>

<p>B.--Aged 10. Unable to stand, bleeding profusely, flesh much
lacerated.</p>

<p>C.--Aged 9. So completely ravished as to be almost beyond
surgical repair. Her husband had two other living wives and spoke
very fine English.</p>

<p>D.--Aged 10. A very small child, and entirely undeveloped
physically. This child was bleeding to death from the rectum. Her
husband was a man of about forty years of age, weighing not less
than eleven stone [154 lbs.]. He had accomplished his desire in an
unnatural way.</p>

<p>E.--Aged about 9. Lower limbs completely paralyzed.</p>

<p>F.--Aged about 12. Laceration of the perineum extending through
the sphincter ani.</p>

<p>G.--Aged about 10. Very weak from loss of blood. Stated that
great violence had been done her, in an unnatural way.</p>

<p>H.--Aged about 12. Pregnant, delivered by crani-otomy with great
difficulty, on account of the immature state of the pelvis and
maternal passage.</p>

<p>I.--Aged about 7. Living with husband. Died in great agony after
three days.</p>

<p>K.--Aged about 10. Condition most pitiable. After one day in
hospital, was demanded by her husband, for his "lawful" use, he
said.</p>

<p>L.--Aged 11. From great violence done her person, will be a
cripple for life. No use of her lower extremities.</p>

<p>M.--Aged about 10. Crawled to hospital on her hands and knees.
Has never been able to stand erect since her marriage.</p>

<p>N.--Aged 9. Dislocation of pubic arch, and unable to stand or to
put one foot before the other.</p>

<p>The list will be found in the <i>Legislative Assembly
Debates</i> of 1922, Vol. Ill, Part I, p. 919, Appendix. See also
p. 882 of the <i>Debates.</i> <a name="app-II" id="app-II"></a></p>

<h3>Appendix II - ENFRANCHISEMENT OF WOMEN</h3>

<p>In framing the Reform Bill of 1919, the British Parliament
decided that the question of enfranchisement for the women of India
could properly be determined only by the Indian peoples themselves.
Parliament accordingly allowed the old sex disqualification to
remain in the Bill; but at the same time so shaped the electoral
rules as to leave it in the power of each province's Legislative
Council to place women on the provincial electoral register by
passing a resolution to this effect.</p>

<p>Pursuant of this power, the Provinces of Madras, Bombay, Bengal,
United Provinces, Punjab and Assam have removed their sex
disqualifications, granting the vote to women on the same terms as
to the male electorate. Further, the Central Legislative Assembly
having passed a similar resolution, women may now vote not only for
their Provincial Councils but also for the Legislative Assembly.
Under the present general qualifications, however, the total number
of women entitled to vote throughout India does not exceed
1,000,000, or about 17 per cent, of the total electorate. <a name=
"page413" id="page413"></a></p>

<p>Sir Alexander Muddiman's Reform Enquiry Committee of 1924, in
opening the consideration of a further step--that of women's
candidature for elective office--reaffirmed that[1]</p>

<blockquote>[1. <i>Report of the Reforms Enquiry Committee,</i>
1924, p. 57.]</blockquote>

<p class="quote">the question went deep into the social system and
susceptibilities of India, and . , . could only with any prudence
be settled in accordance with the wishes of the Indians themselves
as constitutionally expressed.</p>

<p>It was, however, upon the Muddiman Committee's recommendation
that the rules of candidature for Provincial Councils were lately
amended, enabling the removal of the sex disqualification by vote
of Provincial Council. To this invitation Madras and Bombay have
already responded.</p>

<p>The Muddiman Committee next recommended that the electoral rules
of both chambers of the Indian Legislature--the Council of State
and the Assembly--be amended by the removal of the sex
disqualification, so that constituencies in provinces that have
enfranchised their women might at will elect women to both
Chambers. On September 1, 1926, the Indian Legislature so
voted.</p>

<p>Thus far, however, it seems to be the British Provincial
Governor rather than the Indian electorate that uses the new
privilege. From 1922 to 1926, twenty-two women had become Municipal
Councilors or Members of Local Government Boards, of whom only four
were elected, the rest being nominated by Government.[2]</p>

<blockquote>[2. <i>Indian Year Book,</i> 1926, p.
511.]</blockquote>

<p>The following statement is that of an Englishman deeply
conversant with Indian affairs, one who wields much moral influence
in India, and who vigorously used that influence to advocate the
changes above indicated. It was elicited by my request for the
grounds of his position and his view of the present status, and was
elsewhere confirmed by ranking Indians.</p>

<p class="quote">As for the reason for enfranchising Indian women,
I can give you my own reasons, which I put before the Parliamentary
Committee which framed the Act. In some places women had long
enjoyed the municipal franchise, especially in Bombay. There were a
considerable number of women, in Bombay, who took a very useful
part in our social work. Therefore I pressed for the
enfranchisement of women, both to encourage and hearten these where
actually so engaged, and to give others inducements to come
forward. The <i>purdah</i> must be broken as fast as it can...its
influence on the health of Indian women is disastrous. I looked on
the franchise as another nail in the <i>purdah</i> coffin.<br>
<br></p>

<p>As for the effect of enfranchisment in the Bombay Presidency, so
far as I can see, it has been slight; the women in public life are
the women who were there in one way or another before
enfranchisement took place. In other parts of India I should say
the effect was smaller still. Until the social conditions have
improved, the franchise can mean nothing to the Indian woman, for
she dares not use it.</p>

<p>In observing the position of the women of Bombay, outstanding in
India, one heavily contributing factor appears: This city is the
great Parsi center. Out of the total number of Parsis in all
India--101,778--nearly 93,000 are domiciled in Bombay
Presidency.[3] Descendants of old Persian stock, the Parsis are
practically all either merchants or bankers. Eight hundred per
1,000 of their men are literate, as against the 115 literates per
1,000 of male Hindus. The Parsis neither sequester nor suppress
their women, but favor their adequate education. Thus 672 per
1,000[4] of the women of the Parsis are literate, as against the 14
per 1,000 female literates of the Hindus.</p>

<p>The presence of such a body, occupying conspicuous positions,
cannot but influence the whole upper-class population. <a name=

<h3>Appendix IIIA - INDIAN COTTON</h3>

<p>The record of raw cotton exported from India in the years
1924-25 is as follows, the unit being bales of 400 pounds:[1]</p>

<blockquote>[1. <i>Review of the Trade of India in 1924-25,</i>
Calcutta, Government of India Central Publication Branch, 1926, p.
73.]</blockquote>

<pre>
Japan                        1,671,000
Italy                          485,000
China (excluding Hong Kong)    284,000
Belgium                        201,000
Germany                        174,000
The United Kingdom             162,000
</pre>

<p>Of the raw cotton exported to England the Lancashire looms use
little because of its inferior quality, buying, rather, in Egypt
and in America.</p>

<p>India's total raw cotton export, in 1924-25, was 3,326,400
bales.[2] Her consumption in Indian mills during that period was
2,050,891 bales.</p>

<blockquote>[2. <i>Ibid.,</i> pp. 21-2.]</blockquote>

<p>Japan's purchase is mostly of the poorer grades of cotton and is
mainly used in competing in China with the product of India's
mills. In 1924 there were 337 cotton mills in British India. These
are nearly all Indian-owned and as a rule have British
superintendents and foremen, with Indian labor. The following
figures[3] will further clarify the situation:</p>

<blockquote>[3. <i>Review of the Trade of India in 1924-25,</i> p.
<i>23.</i>]</blockquote>

<pre>
1913-14   1922-23   1923-24   1924-25

                                                    Million   Million   Million   Million
                                                    Yards     Yards     Yards     Yards

Production in Indian mills of cotton piece goods    1,164.3   15725.2   1,701.6   1,970.5
Export of Indian-milled piece goods                    89.2     157.0     165.3     181.5
Imports of foreign-made cotton piece-goods, from
all countries, including the United Kingdom, Japan,
Italy, Netherlands and the United States.           3,197.1   1,593.3   1,485.8   1,823.2
</pre>

<p>It will thus be seen that while the production and the export
trade of India have been rising, the import trade is about half
what it was before 1914. <a name="app-IIIB" id="app-IIIB"></a></p>

<h3>Appendix IIIC - MILITARY EXPENDITURE</h3>

<p>An acknowledged authority thus puts the frame of the
matter:[4]</p>

<blockquote>[4. <i>The Defence of India,</i> "Arthur Vincent," pp.
93-4.]</blockquote>

<p class="quote">The safe figure of a nation's military
expenditure...is fixed by considerations almost entirely beyond the
country's control; by her geographical and ethnological boundaries,
by the power and attitude of her neighbours, by her national
resources in men and material, by her racial unity or disunity, and
so on...What requires investigation is whether [India's] total
budget...is worthy of her immense territories and their prosperity.
Were that total to be increased largely, the defence item would
remain virtually stationary, and the disproportion would disappear
to the point of making India one of the best-placed nations in the
world for protective expenditure. <a name="app-IIID" id=
"app-IIID"></a></p>

<h3>Appendix IIID - USURY</h3>

<p>The usurer of the Punjab <i>bania</i> Mr. Calvert writes:[5]</p>

<blockquote>[5. <i>The Wealth and Welfare of the Punjab,</i> H.
Calvert, Lahore, 1922, p. i,10.]</blockquote>

<p class="quote">He represents the richest single class. His
profits probably exceed those of all the cultivators put together.
Beside him, the professional class is inconsiderable; the
industrial class is insignificant, even trade and commerce take
second place.</p>

<p>But the usurer is by no means peculiar to the Punjab. The total
rural debt of British India is estimated at approximately
$1,900,000,000, in the main unproductive. This burden is largely
due to the vicious usury and compound interest system, a trifling
percentage is incurred for land improvement, and the rest may be
mainly attributed to extravagant expenditures on marriages.[6]</p>

<blockquote>[6. <i>Review of the Trade of India,</i> p.
47.]</blockquote>
<a name="app-IIIE" id="app-IIIE"></a>
<h3>Appendix IIIE - BULLION</h3>

<p>The export of merchandise from India, in the year 1924-25,
exceeded the import to the value of over $500,000,000.&deg; During
that year the import of private treasure totaled
$328,000,000.[7]</p>

<blockquote>[7. <i>Ibid.,</i> p. 48.]</blockquote>

<p>America, during 1924-25, imported Indian goods[8] to the value
of $117,000,000. Yet she sold to India only $46,900,000 worth of
goods and exported to India bars of silver on private account of
approximately the same value and gold to the value of $67,700,000.
This process is steadily increasing as the years pass, raising the
world's price of bullion.</p>

<blockquote>[8. <i>Ibid,</i> pp. 48, 60-1, 76.]</blockquote>
<a name="app-IIIF" id="app-IIIF"></a>
<h3>Appendix IIIF - LOSS OF WOMEN'S LABOR</h3>

<p>Calvert says, in his <i>Wealth and Welfare of the Punjab,</i> p.
207:</p>

<p class="quote">If there were in Western countries a movement
aiming at the exclusion of female labour from all except purely
domestic tasks, that movement would endanger the whole economic
fabric, and, if successful, would involve those countries in
ruin...The fact that there are [Indian] tribes...which do not allow
their womenfolk even to work in the fields is alone sufficient to
explain their poverty.</p>

<p>The same point is recognized by the Hindu writer, Visvesvaraya,
in his <i>Reconstructing India, p,</i> 246:</p>

<p class="quote">The time has come when Indians must seriously
consider whether the passive life, to which they condemn women with
a view of preserving the so-called proprieties and decencies of
life, is worth the appalling price the country is forced to pay in
the shape of loss of work and intelligent effort from half the
population of the country.</p>
<a name="app-IIIG" id="app-IIIG"></a>
<h3>Appendix IIIG - MENDICANCY</h3>

<p>On February 2, 1926, Mr. Abdul Haye, Muham-madan member from the
East Punjab, introduced into the Indian Legislative Assembly a
resolution looking to the prohibition of beggary and vagrancy in
India. Supporting it, he said in part:[9]</p>

<blockquote>[9. <i>Legislative Assembly Debates,</i> Vol. VII, No.
8, p. 627.]</blockquote>

<p class="quote">One wonders whether the stars in heaven are more
in number or the beggars in this country...Barring agriculture
there is no other profession in India which can claim more
followers...I make bold to say and without any fear of
contradiction that every twenty-fifth man in this country is a
beggar.</p>

<p>Of these mendicants Lala Lajpat Rai says in his <i>National
Education in India <sub>y</sub></i> p. 37:</p>

<p class="quote">We find that today a good part of the nation
(sometimes estimated at one-fourth), having abandoned all
productive economic work, engages itself in...making the people
believe that next to becoming a Saddh&uacute; [a begging ascetic]
himself, the best thing for man to do to avoid damnation is to feed
and maintain Saddh&uacute;s.</p>
<a name="app-IIIH" id="app-IIIH"></a>
<h3>Appendix IIIH - ECONOMIC CONDITION OF THE MASSES</h3>

<p>As general circumstantial evidence of increased means, one sees
the consumption by the peasants of non-essentials, once beyond
their dreams. Thus, at the fair at Aligarh, in February, 1926, the
turnover of cheap boots in one week amounted to $5,000, netting a
profit of 20 per cent. Boots, to the sort of people who snapped
these up and put them on their own feet, were, twenty years ago, an
unheard-of luxury. Big stocks of umbrellas, lamps, and gayly
painted iron trunks were sold out and renewed over and over again,
on the same occasion, the buyers being the ordinary cultivators.
Tea, cigarettes, matches, lanterns, buttons, pocket-knives,
mirrors, gramophones are articles of commerce with people who,
fifteen years ago, bought nothing of the sort. The heavy
third-class passenger traffic by rail is another evidence of money
in hand. For railway travel, to the Indian peasant, takes the place
that the movie fills in America. In 1924-25, 581,804,000
third-class railway travelers, as against 1,246,000 of the
first-class, proved the presence of money to spare in the peasants'
possession. "Where are they all going?" I repeatedly asked,
watching the crowds packing into the third-class carriages.</p>

<p>"Anywhere. Visiting, pilgrimage, marriage parties, little
business trips--just 'there and back,' mostly for the excitement of
going," was the answer. <a name="index" id="index"></a></p>
