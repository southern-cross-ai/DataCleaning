<h1><a name="p01">PREFACE</a></h1>

<br>
<h2>By Allan Quatermain</h2>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>I cannot remember that anywhere in this book I have stated what it
was that first gave me the idea of attempting to visit Mone, the Holy
Lake, and the Dabanda who live upon, or, to be precise, at some
distance from its shores. Therefore I will do so now.</p>

<p>There is a certain monastery in Natal where I have been made welcome
from time to time, among whose brethren was a very learned monk, now
"gone down", as the Zulus say, who, although our faiths were different,
honoured me with his confidence upon many matters, and I think I may
add with his friendship. Brother Ambrose, as he was called in
religion--what his real name may have been I do not know--a Swede by
birth, would have been an archaeologist, also an anthropologist pure
and simple, had he not chanced to be a saint. As it was he managed to
combine much knowledge of these sciences with his noted and singular
holiness. For example, he was the greatest authority upon Bushmen's
paintings that I have ever met, and knew more of the history,
religions, customs, and habits of the inhabitants of Southern, Eastern,
and South-central Africa--well, than I did myself. Thus it came about,
our tastes being so similar on these and other subjects, that when we
could not meet and talk, often we corresponded.</p>

<p>One of his learned letters, which I still preserve, was written to
me many years ago from Mozambique, whither he had gone upon a journey
connected with the missionary enterprises of his order. From it, for
the sake of accuracy, I will quote some passages.</p>

<p>Brother Ambrose says:</p>

<p>"In this island I have come into touch with a man, a rescued slave
whom it was my privilege to baptize and to attend through his last
illness, during which he made many confidences to me. Peter, as he was
called because he was received into the Church upon the feast day of
that saint, was a man of unusual appearance. His general cast of
countenance and physique were Arab, and his native language was a
somewhat archaic dialect of Arabic. His eyes, however, were large and
round, almost owl-like, indeed--by the way, he had a singular faculty
of seeing in the dark--and his handsome features were remarkable for a
melancholy, which I think must have been inherited and not due to his
experiences of life.</p>

<p>"He told me that he belonged to a small tribe dwelling in the
neighbourhood of mountains called Ruga, far beyond a great lake--I am
not sure what lake--which mountains I gathered are not far distant from
some branch of the Congo River in the remote interior. The home of his
tribe, if I understood him aright, was a large hollow of land enclosed
by cliffs. In the centre of this hollow lies a big sheet of water
surrounded by forest which, he said, is considered holy. When I asked
him why it was holy, he replied because on an island in this water
dwelt a priestess who is a Shadow of God, or of the gods, a beautiful
woman with many magical powers, who utters oracles and bestows
blessings on her worshippers (which, being interpreted, means, I take
it, a fetish or rather the head servant of a fetish credited with the
power of making rain and of averting misfortunes). About this person he
told me many legends too absurd to record, amongst others that she and
her husband, who is the chief of the tribe--for she has a husband--are
sacrificed at a certain age, when her place is taken by another
'Shadow', who is reputed to be her daughter.</p>

<p>"One other thing he told me which I am sure will interest you very
much; indeed, although I am very busy, I write this letter chiefly in
order to pass on the superstition, or legend, or whatever it may be,
before I forget exactly what he said. You and I have often discussed
the mysteries of the African forms of taboo. Well, Peter described a
variety of it that was quite new to me. He declared that to his tribe
<i>all</i> wild game are taboo and may not be killed or eaten by any
member of the tribe, who, it seems, are largely vegetarians, but
supplement this diet with the flesh of goats and cattle, of which they
possess many herds. Nor is this all, for he assured me further that his
people exercised great power over these untamed beasts, living with
them on the same terms of familiarity as we do with dogs and horses and
other domestic animals. Thus he asserted positively that they can send
them away to or call them back from any given spot, and make them do
their bidding in various other fashions, even to the extent of being
able to cause them to attack anyone they choose.</p>

<p>"I tried to extract from him what he believed to be the reason for
this alleged remarkable authority over the wild fauna of his country,
but all I could make out was that the priests taught some form of the
old Pythagorean doctrine of metempsychosis (as you know, not uncommon
in Africa, especially when tyrannical chiefs are concerned); I mean
that the souls of men, particularly of those who had led evil lives,
are reborn in the bodies of beasts, which beasts are therefore, in a
sense, their kin, and on this account feared and venerated.</p>

<p>"It was extremely curious to hear these pre-Christian delusions from
the mouth of a modern African native, and I wonder very much if his
story has any faint foundation in fact. Probably not, but, my dear
friend, if ever you get the chance in the course of your explorations,
<i>do</i> try to find out. You know that, like you, I hold that
scattered here and there through the vast expanse of Africa are the
remains of peoples who still preserve fragments of ancient systems and
religions, such as the Babylonian star-worship or that of the gods of
old Egypt."</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Then the letter goes on to tell of the decease of Peter, before
Brother Ambrose could further pursue his inquiries about a carving that
he had discovered somewhere on the East Coast, which he thought must
have been executed by Bushmen in the remote past; although there is, or
was, no other evidence that they ever lived so far north.</p>

<p>This incident of the strange story told to Father Ambrose by the
dying native, Peter, remained fixed in my mind, and in the end was the
real cause of the journey described in the following pages.</p>

<p>I should like to take this opportunity to say that on re-reading
this record, which is an expanded version of a diary I kept at the
time, I am not sure that I have succeeded in conveying an adequate
sense of the eeriness that pervaded the Dabanda people and their
country. No wonder that added to the various humiliations which I
suffered in their land, this unearthly atmosphere, whereof dwellers in
the fetish-ridden districts of Africa have often had experience, at
last got upon my nerves to such an extent that if I had stopped there
much longer I believe I should have gone crazy.</p>

<p>Another thing that I wish to state is that on weighing the evidence,
whatever reasons old Kumpana and others may have given, I am now
convinced that Hans was right and that the real cause which led them to
procure the return of Kaneke to Mone-land, was that they might execute
him in punishment for his crime of sacrilege in earlier life. On this I
believe they were determined both from vindictiveness and because,
under their iron law, while he lived it was impossible for the
mysterious "Treasure of the Lake" to take another man to husband, as
for their own secret reasons they desired that she should do.</p>

<p>Lastly, it might be asked why I do not more accurately indicate the
exact geographic position of Mone-land and its holy hidden lake. I will
face ridicule--especially as I shall never live to feel its shafts--and
make a confession. Before I left his country, as Arkle had done in his
letter, Kumpana assured me with much quiet emphasis that if I revealed
its exact locality and explained how it could be reached by any other
white man, the results to them, also to myself and Hans in this or
later lives, would be most unpleasant. I did not and do not believe
him; still, in view of my experience of the uncanny powers of the
Dabanda priests, I thought it wise--well, to keep on the safe side and
on this point to remain a little indefinite.</p>

<h1>KANEKE'S TALE</h1>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>Now when I grow old it becomes every day more clear to me, Allan
Quatermain, that each of us is a mystery living in the midst of
mysteries, bringing these with us when we are born and taking them away
with us when we die; doubtless into a land of other and yet deeper
mysteries. At first, while we are quite young, everything seems very
clear and simple. There is a male individual called Father and a female
called Mother who, between them, have made us a present to the world,
or of the world to us, whichever way you like to put it, apparently by
arrangement with the kingdom of heaven; at least that is what we are
taught. There are the sun, the moon, and the stars above us and the
solid earth beneath, there are lessons and dinner and a time to get up
and a time to go to bed--in short there are a multitude of things, all
quite obvious and commonplace, which may be summed up in three words,
<i>the established order,</i> in which, by the decree of Papa and Mamma
and the heavens above, we live and move and have our being.</p>

<p>Then the years go by, the terrible, remorseless years that bear us
as steadily from the cradle to the grave as a creeping glacier bears a
stone. With every one of them, after the first fifteen or so when we
become adult, or in some instances earlier if we chance to be what is
called "rather unusual", a little piece of the curtain is rolled up or
a little hole is widened in the veil, and beneath that curtain, or
through that enlarging hole, we see the mysteries moving in the dusk
beyond. So swiftly do they come and go, and so dark is the background,
that we never discern them clearly. There, if time is given to us to
fix them in our minds, they appear; for a moment they are seen, then
they are gone, to be succeeded by others even yet more wondrous, or
perhaps more awful.</p>

<p>But why go on talking of what is endless and unfathomable? Amidst
this wondrous multitude of enigmas we poor, purblind, slow-witted
creatures must make our choice of those we wish to study. Long ago I
made mine, one local and terrestrial, namely the land with which I have
been connected all my life--Africa--and the other universal and
spiritual, namely human nature. What! some may ask, do you call human
nature spiritual? The very words belie you. What is there spiritual
about that which is human?</p>

<p>My friend, I answer, in my opinion, my most humble and fallible
opinion, almost everything. More and more do I become convinced that we
are nearly all spirit, notwithstanding our gross apparent bodies with
their deeds and longings. You have seen those coloured globes that
pedlars sell--I mean the floating things tinted to this hue or that,
that are the delight of children. The children buy these balls and toss
them into the air, where they travel one way or the other, blown by
winds we cannot see, till in the end they burst and of each there
remains nothing but a little shrivelled skin, a shred of substance,
which they are told is made from the gum of a tree. Well, to my fancy
that expanded skin or shred is a good symbol of the human body, so
large and obvious to the sight, yet driven here and there by the breath
of circumstance and in the end destroyed. But what was within it which
escapes at last and is no more seen? To my mind the gas with which the
globe was filled represents the spirit of man, imprisoned for a while;
then to all appearance lost.</p>

<p>I dare say that the example is faulty; still, I use it because it
conveys something of my idea. So, good or bad, I let it stand and pass
on to an easier theme, or at any rate one easier to handle, namely that
of the mysteries of the great continent of Africa.</p>

<p>Now all the world is wonderful, but surely among its countries there
is none more so than Africa; no, not even China the unchanging, or
India the ancient. For this reason, I think: those great lands have
always been more or less known to their own inhabitants, whereas
Africa, as a whole, from the beginning was and still remains
unknown.</p>

<p>To this day great sections of its denizens are quite ignorant of
other sections, as much so as was mighty Egypt of the millions of the
neighbouring peoples in the time when a voyage to the Land of Punt,
which I take to have been the country that we now know as Uganda, was
looked upon as a marvellous adventure. Again, there is the instance of
Solomon, or rather Hiram and his gold traffic with Ophir, the dim and
undefined, that doubtless was the district lying at the back of Sofala.
But why multiply such examples, of which there are many? And if this is
true of Africa, the Libya of the early world, as a country, is it not
still more true of its inhabitants, divided as these are into countless
races, peoples, and tribes, each of them with its own gods or ancestral
spirits, language, customs, traditions, and mental outlook established
in the passage of innumerable ages?</p>

<p>So far as my small experience goes, for though many might think it
large it is still small, these are my opinions which I venture to state
as an opening to what I have always considered a very curious history,
in which it was my fortune to play some small and humble part. For let
it be understood at once that I was by no means the chief actor in this
business. Indeed, I was never more than an agent, a kind of connecting
wire between the parties concerned, an insignificant bridge over which
their feet travelled to certain ends that I presume to have been
appointed by Fate. Still, I saw much of the play and now, when the
curtain has been long rung down, by help of the diary I kept at the
time and have preserved, I will try to record such memories of it as
remain to me--well, because rightly or wrongly I think that they are
worth recording.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>Years ago, accompanied by my servant Hans, the old and faithful
Hottentot with whom I have experienced so many adventures, I made a
great journey to what I may almost call Central Africa, starting in
from the East Coast. It was a hazardous adventure into which I had been
led by tales that had reached me of the enormous herds of elephants to
be found in what I suppose must now be the north of the Belgian Congo.
Or perhaps it is still No Man's Land as it was in those days--really, I
do not know. Nor is this wonderful, seeing that with a single exception
I believe that I was the first white man to set foot in that particular
district which lies beyond the Lado mountains north of Jissa and of the
Denbo River.</p>

<p>To be truthful, however, it was not only the elephants that took me
to these parts, guessing, as I did, that if I found them it might be of
little avail, since probably ivory in bulk would prove impossible to
carry. No, it was rather the desire to look upon new things, to
discover the Unknown which is so strong a part of my nature, that at
times it half reconciles me to the prospect of death which I, who
believe that we do not go out, believe also must be a land or a state
full of all that is strange and wonderful.</p>

<p>I had heard from natives in the neighbourhood of the great lake
Victoria Nyanza that there was a marvellous country between two rivers
known as M'bomu and Balo, where dwelt strange tribes who were said to
dress like Arabs and to talk a sort of Arabic; also that somewhere in
this country was a holy lake, a big sheet of water that none was
allowed to approach. Further, that in this lake, which was called Mone
(pronounced like groan), a word of unknown meaning, was an island
"where dwelt the gods", or the spirits, for the term used was capable
of either interpretation.</p>

<p>Now, when I heard of this Holy Lake called Mone, "where dwelt the
gods", at once my mind went back to the letter of which I have spoken
in the preface of this book, that long years before I had received from
my late friend, Brother Ambrose, telling me what he had learned from a
slave whom he had christened.</p>

<p>Could it be the same, I wondered, as that of which the slave had
told Brother Ambrose? Instantly, and with much suppressed excitement, I
set to work to make further inquiries, and was informed that a certain
Kaneke, a stranger who had been a slave and was now the chief or
captain of an Arab settlement some fifty miles away from where I met
these natives, could give me information about the lake, inasmuch as he
was reported to be born of the people who dwelt upon its borders.</p>

<p>Then and there I changed my plans, as indeed was convenient to me
because of the suddenly developed hostility of a chief through whose
territory I had intended to pass, and in order to seek out this Kaneke,
took a road running in another direction to that which I had designed
to travel. Little did I guess at the time that Kaneke was seeking
<i>me</i> out and that the natives who told me the legend of the lake
were, in fact, his emissaries sent to tempt me to visit him, or that it
was he who had incited the chief against me in order to block my
path.</p>

<p>Well, in due course I reached Kaneke-town, as it was called, without
accident, for although between me and it dwelt a very dangerous tribe
whom at first I had purposed to avoid, all at once their chief and
headman became friendly and helped me in every way upon my journey.
Kaneke, a remarkable person whom I will describe later, received me
well, giving me a place to camp outside his village and all the food
that we required. Also he proved extraordinarily communicative, telling
me directly that he belonged to a tribe called Dabanda, which had its
home in the wild parts whereof I have spoken. He added that he was the
"high-born" son of a great doctor or medicine-man, a calling which all
his family had followed for generations. In some curious way, of which
I did not at first learn the details, while undergoing his novitiate as
a doctor or magician, this man had been seized by a rival tribe, the
Abanda, and ultimately sold as a slave to an Arab trader, one Hassan,
who brought him down to the neighbourhood of the great lake.</p>

<p>Here also, according to his own story, it seemed that one night this
Kaneke succeeded in murdering Hassan.</p>

<p>"I crept on him in the night. I got him by the throat. I choked the
life out of him," he said, twitching his big hands, "and as he died I
whispered in his ear of all the cruel things he had done to me. He made
signs to me, praying for mercy, but I went on till I had killed him,
whispering to him all the while. When he was dead I took his body and
threw it out into the bush, having first stripped him. There a lion
found it and bore it away, for in the morning it was gone. Then,
Macumazahn" (that is the native name by which I, Allan Quatermain, am
known in Africa, and which had come with me to these parts), "I played
a great game, such as you might have done, O Watcher-by-Night. I
returned to the tent of Hassan and sat there thinking.</p>

<p>"I heard the lion, or lions come, for I think there was more than
one of them, as I was sure that they would come who had called them by
a charm, and guessed that they had eaten or carried away Hassan the
evil. When all was quiet I dressed myself in the robes of Hassan. I
found his gun, which on the journey he had taught me to use, that I
might shoot the slaves who could travel no farther for him; his pistol
also, and saw that they were loaded. Then I sat myself upon his stool
and waited for the light.</p>

<p>"At the dawn one of his women crept into the tent to visit him. I
seized her. She stared at me, saying:</p>

<p>"'You are not my master. You are not Hassan.'</p>

<p>"I answered, 'I am your master. I am Hassan, whose face the spirits
have changed in the night.'</p>

<p>"She opened her mouth to cry out. I said:</p>

<p>"'Woman, if you try to scream, I will kill you. If you are quiet I
will take you. Look on me. I am young. Hassan was old. I am a finer
man, you will be happier with me. Choose now. Will you die, or
live?'</p>

<p>"'I will live,' she said, she who was no fool.</p>

<p>"'Then I am Hassan, am I not?' I asked.</p>

<p>"'Yes,' she said, 'you are Hassan and my lord. I am sure of it
now.'</p>

<p>"For I tell you, that woman had wit, Macumazahn, and I was sorry
when, two years afterwards, she died.</p>

<p>"'Good,' I said. 'Now, when the servants of Hassan come you will
swear that I am he and no other, remembering that if you do not swear
you die.'</p>

<p>"'I will swear,' she answered.</p>

<p>"Presently the headman of Hassan came, a big fat fellow who was half
an Arab, to bring him his morning drink. I took it and drank. The light
of the rising sun struck into the tent. He saw and started back.</p>

<p>"'You are not Hassan,' he said. 'You are the slave Kaneke, whom we
bought.'</p>

<p>"'I am Hassan,' I answered. 'Ask my wife here, whom you know, if I
am not Hassan. Also, if I am not, where is Hassan?'</p>

<p>"'Yes, he is Hassan, my husband,' broke in the woman.</p>

<p>"'This is witchcraft!' he cried, and ran away.</p>

<p>"'Now he is gone to fetch the others,' I said to the woman. 'Fasten
back the sides of the tent that I may see, and give me the guns.'</p>

<p>"She obeyed, though then she sat exposed, and I took the
double-barrelled gun and held it ready.</p>

<p>"Presently, they all came, five or six Arabs, or half Arabs, and a
score or so of black soldiers. Even the slaves came, dragging their
yokes, fifty or more of them of whom perhaps thirty were men, all known
to me, for had we not shared the yoke? There they stood huddled
together behind the Arabs, staring.</p>

<p>"'Take a knife,' I whispered to the woman; 'slip out, get among the
slaves and cut the thongs of the yokes.'</p>

<p>"She nodded--have I not told you that girl had wits,
Macumazahn?--and slipped away.</p>

<p>"Cried the fat one, the captain:</p>

<p>"'This fellow, whom we all know for Kaneke, the slave whom we
bought, says that he is Hassan our lord. Yes, there he sits in Hassan's
robes and says that he is Hassan. Dog, where is Hassan?'</p>

<p>"'Inside this garment,' I answered. 'Listen. I made a bargain with
Hassan, I who am a wizard. I forgave him his sins against me, and in
return he gave me his soul while his body flew away to Paradise.'</p>

<p>"'The liar!' shouted the captain. 'Kill him!' and he brandished a
spear.</p>

<p>"'Admit that I am Hassan or I will send you to where you will learn
that I am no liar,' I said quietly.</p>

<p>"In answer he lifted the spear to stab me. Then I shot him dead.</p>

<p>"'Now am I Hassan?' I asked, while the rest stared at him.</p>

<p>"One or two who were frightened said 'Yes'. Others stood silent, and
a big fellow began to put a cap upon his gun. I shot him with the other
barrel, then, rising, roared in a great voice:</p>

<p>"'On to them, slaves, if you would be free!' for by now I saw that
the woman had cut many of the thongs.</p>

<p>"Those men were brave, they came of good stock. They heard, and
leapt on to the Arabs with a shout, knocking them down with the yokes
and throttling them with their hands. Soon it was over. Most of them
were killed, but two or three crawled before me crying that I was
certainly Hassan.</p>

<p>"'Very well,' I said. 'Take away these'--here I pointed to the dead
men--'and throw them into yonder ravine, and bid the women prepare food
while I make prayer according to my custom.'</p>

<p>"Then I took Hassan's beautiful prayer-rug, spread it and made
obeisance in the proper fashion, muttering with my lips as I had often
watched him do; after which everything went smoothly. That is all the
story, Macumazahn."</p>

<p>When he had finished this tale, which, true or false, of its sort
was remarkable even in equatorial Africa, where such things happen, or
happened, by the score without anybody hearing of them, I sat awhile
considering Kaneke.</p>

<p>To tell the truth he was worth study. A giant of a man in size, he
was not a negro by any means, for his features had a somewhat Semitic
cast and he was yellow-hued rather than black. Moreover, he had hair,
not wool, wavy hair that he wore rather long. His eyes were so
prominent, round, and lustrous that they gave an owl-like cast to his
countenance, his features well cut, although the lips were somewhat
coarse and the nose was hooked like a hawk's beak, while his hands and
feet were thin and shapely, and in curious contrast to his great
athletic frame and swelling muscles. His age might have been anything
between thirty-five and forty, and he carried his years well, moving
with the swing and vigour of youth.</p>

<p>It was his face, however, that commanded my attention as a student
of character. It was extraordinarily strong and yet dreamy, almost
mystical, indeed, when in repose, the face of a thinker, or even of a
priest. Contemplating him I could almost believe the strange tale he
had told me, which in the case of most natives I should have set down
as an outrageous lie. For here, without doubt, was a man who could
conceive a plot of the sort and execute it without hesitation. Yet he
was one to whom I took a dislike from the moment I set eyes upon him.
Instinctively, however attractive he might be in some ways, I felt that
at bottom he was dangerous and not to be trusted. Still, he interested
me very much, as did his story, especially that part of it in which he
said that he called the lions "by a charm".</p>

<p>"What happened afterwards, Kaneke?" I asked at last.</p>

<p>"Oh, very little, Macumazahn. I became Hassan, though they called me
'the Changeling'; that is all. I did not travel on towards the coast
because I thought it safer to stop where I was, not daring to go either
forward or back. So I gathered people about me and founded the town in
which you are. Once some Arabs came to kill me, but I killed them, and
after that I was no more molested, because, you see, I was looked upon
as a ghost-man, one who had a great <i>ju-ju,</i> one not to be
touched; and all were afraid of me."</p>

<p>"You mean you became a witch-doctor again, Kaneke."</p>

<p>"Yes, Macumazahn. Or, rather, I was that already, a diviner and a
master of spells, like my fathers before me. So here I set up as a sort
of wise man as well as a warrior, and soon gained a great repute, which
caused all the people round about to send to me to give them medicines
and charms, or to make rain. Thus, and with the help of trade, I became
rich and powerful as I am today."</p>

<p>"Then you are a happy man, Kaneke."</p>

<p>He rolled his big round eyes and looked at me earnestly, asking:</p>

<p>"Is any man happy, Macumazahn, or at least any man who thinks? The
beasts are happy; can man be happy like the beasts who never look to
tomorrow or to the hour of death?"</p>

<p>"Now that you mention it, Kaneke, I do not suppose that any man is
happy, except sometimes for an hour when he forgets himself in drink,
or love, or war."</p>

<p>"Or when he talks with the heavens," added Kaneke, which I thought a
strange remark. "Yes, then and in sleep he is sometimes happy till he
wakes to the sorrow of the day."</p>

<p>He paused a little and went on:</p>

<p>"If this be so with all men, how much more is it so with those who
have known the yoke and who must grow old far from their homes, as I
do? For such there is no joy, for even their dreams are haunted. In
these they see the village where they were born and the distant
mountains and the face of their mother, and hear the voices of their
playmates and of those they loved, that now are still."</p>

<p>I sighed as the truth of his words came home to me.</p>

<p>"If you feel thus," I answered presently, "why do you not return to
your home?"</p>

<p>"I will tell you, Macumazahn. There are many reasons, among them
these. Here I rule over people who would not wish to go with me and
who, if I forced them, would run away, or perhaps poison me. Indeed,
they would not let me go because I am necessary to them, protecting
them from their enemies and from wild beasts, and giving them rain, as
I can do. Again, the road is long and dangerous, and maybe I should not
live to come to its end. Also, if I did, what should I find? I was my
father's eldest son, born of his chief wife, and to me he told the
secrets of his wisdom that have come down to us through the
generations. But I have been absent for years and mayhap another has
taken my place. My people would not welcome me, Macumazahn. They might
kill me, especially if they who know all, have learned that I have
betrayed my own goddess by bending the knee to the Prophet, even though
I never bent my heart. Still, it is true that I wish to risk all and
return, even if it be to die."</p>

<p>Now I grew deeply interested, for always I have loved to discover
the mysteries of these strange African faiths.</p>

<p>"Your own goddess?" I asked. "What goddess?"</p>

<p>All this time we were seated in the shade of a flat-topped,
thick-leaved tree of the banyan species, the Tree of Council it was
called, that grew upon a little knoll at a distance from Kaneke's town.
He rose and walked all round this place, as though to make sure that no
one was near us. Then he stared up into its branches, where he
discovered a monkey sitting. I knew that it was there, but he did not
seem to have noticed it. At this monkey he began to shout out
something, as though he were giving it orders, till at last the little
beast ran along the boughs of the tree, dropped to the ground and
bolted for the bush in the distance.</p>

<p>"Why do you hunt it away?" I asked.</p>

<p>"A monkey can hear and is very like a man. Perhaps a monkey can tell
tales, Macumazahn."</p>

<p>I laughed, for of course I understood that this was an African way
of indicating that the matter to be discussed was most solemn and
private. By driving away that monkey Kaneke was swearing me to the
strictest secrecy--or so I thought.</p>

<p>He came back and moved his stool, I noted, into such a position that
the light of the westering sun striking through the lower boughs of the
tree flickered on my face and left his in shadow. I lit my pipe
leisurely, so that for some time there was silence between us. The fact
is I was determined that he should be the first to speak. It is a good
rule with any native when a subject of importance is concerned.</p>

<p>"You asked me of my goddess, Macumazahn."</p>

<p>"Did I, Kaneke?" I replied, puffing at my pipe to make it burn. "Oh
yes, I remember. Well, who is she and where does she live? On earth or
in heaven--which is the home of goddesses?"</p>

<p>"Yesterday, Macumazahn, you--or perhaps it was that little yellow
man, your servant Hans--asked me if I had ever heard of a lake called
Mone which lies in the hidden land where dwell my people, the Dabanda,
beyond the Ruga-Ruga Mountains."</p>

<p>"I dare say. I remember having heard of this lake, which interested
me because of legends connected with it, though I forget what they
were. What about it?"</p>

<p>"Only that it is there my goddess dwells, Macumazahn."</p>

<p>"Indeed. Then I suppose that she is a water-spirit."</p>

<p>"I cannot say, Macumazahn. I only know that she dwells with her
women on the island in the lake, and at night, when it is very dark,
sometimes she and her companions are heard upon the water, or passing
through the forests, singing and laughing.</p>

<p>"Did you ever see her, Kaneke?"</p>

<p>He hesitated like one who seeks time to make up a plausible story,
or so I thought, then answered:</p>

<p>"Yes. Once when I was young. I had been sent to look for some goats
of ours that had strayed, and following them into the forest which
slopes down to the lake, I lost myself there. Night came on and I lay
down to sleep under a tree, or rather to watch for the dawn, so that
with the light I might escape from that darksome, haunted place, of
which I was afraid."</p>

<p>"Well, and what happened?"</p>

<p>"So much that I cannot remember all, Macumazahn. Spirits went by me;
I heard them in the tree-tops and above; I heard them pass through the
forest, laughing; I felt them gather about me and knew that they were
mocking me. At length all those Wood-Dwellers went away, leaving me as
terrified as though a lion had come and eaten out of my bowl. The moon
rose and her light pierced down through the boughs, a shaft of it here,
a shaft of it there, with breadths of blackness between. I shut my
eyes, trying to sleep, then hearing sounds, I opened them again. I
looked up. There in the heart of one of the pools of light stood a
woman, a fair-skinned woman like to one of your people, Macumazahn. She
seemed to be young and slender, also beautiful, as I perceived when she
turned her head and the moon shone upon her face and showed her soft,
dark eyes, which were like those of a buck. For the rest she was clad
in grey garments that glimmered like a spider's web filled with dew at
dawn. There was a cap upon her head and from beneath it her black hair
flowed down upon her shoulders. Oh, she was beautiful--so beautiful . .
." and he paused.</p>

<p>"That what, Kaneke?" I asked curiously.</p>

<p>"Lord, that I committed a great crime, the greatest in the whole
world, the crime of sacrilege against her who is called the
Shadow."</p>

<p>"Shadow! Whose shadow?"</p>

<p>"The Shadow of the Engoi, the goddess who dwells in heaven and is
shone upon by the star we worship above all other stars." (This, I
found afterwards, was the planet Venus.) "Or perhaps she dwells in the
star and is shone upon by the moon--I do not know. At least, she who
lives upon the island in the lake is the shadow of the Engoi upon
earth, and that is why she is called Engoi and Shadow."</p>

<p>"Very interesting," I said, though I understood little of what he
said, except that it was a piece of African occultism to which as yet I
had not the key. "But what crime did you commit?"</p>

<p>"Lord, I was young and my blood was hot and the beauty of this
wanderer in the forest made me mad. Lord, I threw my arms about her and
embraced her. Or, rather, I tried to embrace her, but before my lips
touched hers all my strength left me, my arms fell down and I became as
a man of stone, though I could still see and hear. . . ."</p>

<p>"What did you see and hear, Kaneke?" I asked, for again he paused in
his story.</p>

<p>"I saw her lovely face grow terrible and I heard her say, 'Do you
know who I am, O man Kaneke, who are not afraid to do me violence in my
holy, secret grove where none may set his foot?' Lord, I tried to lie,
but I could not who must answer, 'I know that you are the Engoi; I know
that your name is Shadow. I pray you to pardon me, O Shadow.'</p>

<p>"'For what you have done there is no pardon. Still, your life is
spared, if only for a while. Get you gone and let the Council of the
Engoi deal with you as it will.'"</p>

<p>"And what happened then?"</p>

<p>"Then, Lord, she departed, vanishing away, and I too departed,
flying through the forest terribly afraid and pursued by voices that
proclaimed my crime and threatened vengeance. Next day the Council
seized me and passed judgment on me, driving me from the land so that I
fell into the hands of our enemies, the Abanda, who dwell upon the
slopes of the mountains, and in the end was sold as a slave."</p>

<p>"And how did this Council know what you had done, Kaneke?"</p>

<p>"What is known to the Shadow is known to her Council, and what is
known to her Council is known to the Shadow, Lord."</p>

<p>Now I considered Kaneke and his story, and came to the conclusion, a
perfectly correct one, as I think, that he was lying to me. What his
exact offence against this priestess may have been I don't know and
never learned in detail, though I believe that it was much worse than
what he described. All that was certain is that he had committed some
sacrilegious crime of such a character that, notwithstanding his rank,
he was forced to fly out of his country in order to save his life, and
to become an exile, which he remained.</p>

<p>Leaving that subject without further comment, I asked him who were
these Abanda who delivered him into slavery.</p>

<p>"Lord," he replied, "they are a branch of a people from whom we
separated ages ago and who live on the plains beyond the mountains.
They hate us and are jealous of us because the Engoi gives us rain and
fruitful season, whereas often they suffer from drought and scarcity.
Therefore they wish to take the land and Lake Mone, so that the Engoi
may once more be their goddess also. More, they are a mighty people,
whereas we are very few, for from generation to generation our numbers
dwindle."</p>

<p>"Then why do they not invade and defeat you, Kaneke?"</p>

<p>"Because they dare not, Lord; because if they set foot within the
land of Mone a curse will fall upon them, seeing that it and we who
dwell there are protected by the Stars of Heaven. Yet always they hope
that the day will come when they can defy the curse and conquer us, who
hold them back by wisdom and not by spears. And now, Macumazahn, I must
go to make my prayer before the people to that prophet in whom I do not
believe. Yet come to me again when the evening star has risen, for I
have more to say to you, Macumazahn."</p>

<p>I got up, then said:</p>

<p>"One more question before I go, Kaneke. Is this Engoi of whom you
speak, who lives in a lake, a woman or--something more?"</p>

<p>"Lord, how can I answer? Certainly she is a woman, for she is born
and dies, leaving behind her a daughter to take her place. Also she is
something more, or so we are taught."</p>

<p>"What do you mean?"</p>

<p>"I mean that the same flesh or Shadow dwells in every Engoi,
although the flesh which holds it changes from generation to
generation. There is a legend that she is an angel who sinned and fell
from heaven."</p>

<p>"What is the legend and how did she sin?"</p>

<p>A cunning look came over the face of Kaneke as he answered:</p>

<p>"The priests' tale runs, Lord, that an Engoi of long ago loved a
white man and that when he was forbidden to her, she killed him to take
him to heaven with her. Therefore she must return to the world again
and again till she finds that white man" (here he glanced at me) "and
makes amends to him for her crime. She is looking for him now, and the
Stars declare that the time is at hand when she will find him
again."</p>

<p>"Do they really?" I remarked. "Well, I hope she won't be
disappointed," I added, reflecting to myself that Kaneke was a
first-class imaginative liar, for though the idea of the sinful spirit
returning to inhabit mortal flesh is as old as the world, his
adaptation of it was ingenious.</p>

<p>What, I wondered, as I walked away, did that specious but
false-hearted ruffian Kaneke want to get out of me? Whatever his
object, certainly the man could not be trusted. According to his own
account he was a fugitive outcast who had committed murder, one also
who for his personal advantage pretended to profess a faith in which he
admitted that he had no belief, showing thereby that he was of a
traitorous and contemptible character. So sure was I of this, that but
for one thing I would have put an end to my acquaintance with him then
and there. He knew the way to Lake Mone and declared that it was his
country. And I--well, I burned to find out the truth about this holy
lake and the mysterious priestess who dwelt in the midst of its waters,
she, without doubt, of whom Brother Ambrose had written to me so many
years ago.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<h1><a name="c02">CHAPTER II</a></h1>

<br>


<h1>ALLAN'S BUSINESS INSTINCTS</h1>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>I went to my camp, which was situated upon the outskirts of Kaneke's
village in a deserted garden where bananas, oranges, papaws, and other
semi-tropical products fought for existence in a neglected confusion,
working out the problem of the survival of the fittest. Here I found
Hans the Hottentot, who had been my servant and in his own way friend
from my youth up, as he was that of my father before me. He was seated
in front of the palm-leaf shelter watching a pot upon the fire made of
mealie-cobs from which the corn had been stripped, looking very hot and
cross.</p>

<p>"So you have come at last, Baas," he said volubly. "An hour ago that
coast cook-boy, Aru, went off, leaving me to watch this stew which he
said must be kept upon the simmer, neither boiling nor going cold, or
it would be spoiled. He swore that he was going to pray to Allah, for
he is a Prophet-worshipper, Baas. But I know what his prophet is like,
for I found him kissing her last night; great fat girl with a mouth as
wide as that plate and a bold eye that frightens me, Baas, who have
always been timid of women."</p>

<p>"Have you?" I said. "Then I wish you would be timid of other things
too, gin-bottles, for instance."</p>

<p>"Ah, Baas, a gin-bottle, I mean one that is full, is better than a
woman, for of a gin-bottle you know the worst. You swallow the gin, you
get drunk and it is very sad, and next morning your head aches and you
think of all the sins you ever did. Yes, Baas, and if the gin was at
all bad, their number is endless, and their colour so black that you
feel that they can never be forgiven, however hard your reverend
father, the Predikant, may pray for you up there. But, Baas, as the
morning goes on, especially if you have the sense to drink a pint of
milk and the luck to get it, and the sun shines, you grow better. Your
sins roll away, you feel, or at least I do, that the prayers of your
reverend father may have prevailed there in the Place of Fires, and
that the slip is overlooked because Life's road is so full of greasy
mud, Baas, that few can travel it without sometimes sitting down to
think. Now with women, as the Baas knows better perhaps than anyone,
the matter is not so simple. You can't wash <i>her</i> away with a pint
of milk and a little sunshine, Baas. She is always waiting round the
corner; yes, even if she is dead--in your mind you know, Baas."</p>

<p>"Be silent, Hans," I said, "and give me my supper."</p>

<p>"Yes, Baas; that is what I am trying to do, Baas, but something has
gone wrong after all, for the stuff is sticking to the pot and I can't
get it out even with this iron spoon. I think that if the Baas would
not mind taking the pot and helping himself, it would be much easier,"
and he thrust that blackened article towards me.</p>

<p>"Hans," I said, "if this place were not Mahommedan where there is no
liquor, I should think that you had been drinking."</p>

<p>"Baas, if you believe that Prophet-worshippers do not drink, your
head is even softer than I imagined. It is true that they have no gin
here, at least at present, because they have finished the last lot and
cannot get any more till the traders come. But they make a kind of wine
of their own out of palm trees which answers quite well if you can
swallow enough of it without being sick, which I am sorry to say I
can't, Baas, and therefore this afternoon I have only had two pannikins
full. If the Baas would like to try some--"</p>

<p>Here I lifted the first thing that came to hand--it was a
three-legged stool--and hurled it at Hans, who slipped cleverly round
the corner of the hut, probably because he was expecting its
advent.</p>

<p>A while later, after I had tackled the stew--which had stuck to the
pot--with unsatisfactory results, and lit my pipe, he returned to clear
up, in such a chastened frame of mind that I gathered the
palm-wine--well, let that be.</p>

<p>"What has the Baas been doing all the afternoon in this dull place?"
he asked humbly, watching me with a furtive eye, for there was another
stool within reach, also the pot. "Talking to that giant rain-maker,
who looks like an owl in sunlight--I mean Kaneke--or perhaps to one of
his wives; she who is so pretty," he added, by an after-thought.</p>

<p>"Yes," I said, "I have--to Kaneke, I mean, not to the wife, whom I
do not know; indeed, I never heard that he had any wives."</p>

<p>Then I added suddenly, for now that he had recovered from the
palm-wine I wished to surprise the truth out of his keen mind:</p>

<p>"What do you think of Kaneke, Hans?"</p>

<p>Hans twiddled his dirty hat and fixed his little yellow eyes upon
the evening sky, then he took the pot and, finding a remaining leg of
fowl, ate it reflectively, after which he produced his corn-cob pipe
and asked me for some tobacco. This, by the way, I was glad to see, for
when Hans could smoke I knew that he was quite sober.</p>

<p>These preliminaries finished, he remarked.</p>

<p>"As to what was it that the Baas wished me to instruct him? Oh, I
remember. About that big village headman, Kaneke. Well, Baas, I have
made inquiries concerning him from his wife, who says she is jealous of
him and therefore in a mood to speak the truth. First of all he is a
great liar, Baas, though that is nothing for all these people are
liars--not like me and you, Baas, who often speak the truth, or at
least I do."</p>

<p>"Stop fooling, and answer my question," I said.</p>

<p>"Yes, Baas. Well, I said that he was a liar, did I not? For
instance, I dare say he has told the Baas a fine tale about how he came
to settle here, by killing the head of the slave-gang, after which all
the other slavers acknowledged him as their chief. The truth is that he
and the other slaves murdered the lot of them because he said he was a
good Mahommedan and could not bear to see them drinking gin against the
law, which for my part I think was clever of him. They surprised them
in their sleep, Baas, and dragged them to the top of that cliff over
the stream, where they threw them one by one into the water, except two
who had beaten Kaneke. These he flogged to death, which I dare say they
deserved. After this the people here, who hated the slavers because
they robbed them, made Kaneke their chief because he was such a holy
man who could not bear to see followers of the Prophet drink gin, also
because they were afraid lest he should throw them over the cliff too.
That is why he must be so strict about his prayers, because, you see,
he must keep his fame for holiness and show that he is as good as he
wishes others to be."</p>

<p>Hans stopped to re-light his pipe with an ember, and I asked him
impatiently if he had any more to say.</p>

<p>"Yes, Baas, lots. This Kaneke is not one man, he is two. The first
Kaneke is a tyrant, one full of plots who would like to rule the world,
a lover of liquor too, which he drinks in secret; fierce, cunning,
cruel. The second Kaneke is one who dreams, who hears voices and sees
things in the sky, who follows after visions, a true witch-doctor, a
man who would seek what is afar, but who, living in this soft place, is
like a lion in a cage. His mother must have made a mistake, and instead
of bearing twins, got two spirits into one body where they must fight
together till he dies."</p>

<p>"I dare say. Many men have two spirits in one body. Is that all,
Hans?"</p>

<p>"Yes--that is, no, Baas. You know this Kaneke brought you here,
don't you, Baas, and that all those troubles which we met with, so that
we could not go the road we wanted because that tribe sent to say they
would kill us if we did, were made by him so that you might come to his
village."</p>

<p>"I know nothing of the sort."</p>

<p>"Well, it was so, Baas. The jealous woman told me all about it."</p>

<p>"Why? What for? There is no big game here that I can shoot, and I am
not rich to give him presents. Indeed, he has asked for nothing and
feeds us without payment."</p>

<p>"I am not sure, Baas, but I think that he wishes you to go somewhere
with him; that the lion wants to come out of the cage and to kill for
himself, instead of living on dead meat of which he is tired. Has he
spoken to you about that holy lake of which we have heard, Baas? If
not, I think he will."</p>

<p>"Yes, Hans. It seems that it is in his country where he was born and
that he had an adventure there in his youth, because of which his
people drove him away."</p>

<p>"Just so, Baas, and presently you will find that he desires to go
back to his country and have more adventures or to pay off old scores,
or both. Do you wish to go with him, Baas?"</p>

<p>"Do you, Hans?"</p>

<p>"I think not, Baas. This Kaneke is a spook man, and I am afraid of
spooks who always make me feel cold down the back."</p>

<p>Here Hans stared at the sky again, then added:</p>

<p>"And yet, Baas, I'd rather go to the lake or anywhere than stop in
this place where there is nothing to do and the palm-wine makes one
sick, especially as after all, a good Christian like Hans has nothing
to fear from spooks, whom he can tell to go to hell, as your reverend
father did, Baas. Lastly, as your reverend father used to say, too,
when he stood in the box in a nightshirt, it doesn't matter what I wish
to do, or what you wish to do, since we shall go where we must, yes,
where it pleases the Great One in the sky to send us, Baas, even if He
uses Kaneke to drag us there by the hair of the head. And now, Baas, I
must wash up those things before it gets dark, after which I have to
meet that jealous wife of Kaneke's yonder in a quiet place, and learn a
little more from her, for as you know, Baas, Hans is always a seeker
after wisdom."</p>

<p>"Mind that you don't find folly," I remarked sententiously. Then
remembering my promise and noting that the evening star was showing
brightly in the quiet sky, I rose and went through the gate of the
town, for my camp was outside the fence of prickly pears which was
planted round the palisade, thinking as I walked that in his ridiculous
way Hans had spoken a great truth. It was useless to bother about
plans, seeing that we should go where it was fated that we should go,
and nowhere else. Doubtless man has free will, but the path of
circumstance upon which he is called to exercise it is but narrow.</p>

<p>At the gate I found a white-robed man waiting to guide me to
Kaneke's abode, "to keep off the dogs and see that I did not step upon
a thorn", as he said.</p>

<p>So I was conducted through the village, a tidy place in its way, to
the north end, where outside the fence was that cliff with a stream,
now nearly dry, running at the bottom of it over which Hans said Kaneke
had thrown the slave-traders.</p>

<p>Round Kaneke's house, that was square, thatched, and built of
whitewashed clay, was a strong palisade through which the only entrance
was by a double gate, for evidently this chief was one who took no
risks. At the inner gate my guide bowed and left me. As he departed it
was opened by Kaneke himself, who, I noted, made it fast behind me with
a bar and some kind of primitive lock. Then he bowed before me in
almost reverential fashion, saying:</p>

<p>"Enter, my lord Macumazahn, White Lord whose fame has travelled far.
Yes, whose fame has reached me even in this dead place where no news
comes."</p>

<p>Now I looked at him, thinking to myself for the second time, "I do
wonder what it is you want to get out of me, my friend." Then I
said:</p>

<p>"Has it indeed? That is very strange, seeing that I am no great one,
no Queen's man who wears ribbons and bright stars, nor even rich, but
only a humble hunter who shoots and trades for his living."</p>

<p>"It is not at all strange, O Macumazahn. Do you not know that every
man of account has two values?--one his public value in the
market-place, which may be much or little; and the other his private
value, which is written in all minds that have judgment. Nor is it
strange that I should be acquainted with this second and higher value
of yours that stands apart from wealth, or honours cried by heralds.
Have I not told you that I am one of the fraternity of witch-doctors,
and do you not know that throughout Africa such doctors communicate
with one another by curious and secret ways? I say that before ever you
set foot upon our shores I knew that you were coming in a ship, also
much concerning you. Amongst others a certain Zikali who dwells in the
land of the Zulus, a chief of our brotherhood, sent me a message."</p>

<p>"Oh, did he?" I said. "Well, Zikali's ways are dark and strange, so
I can almost believe it. But, friend Kaneke, is it wise to talk thus
openly here? Doubtless you have women in your house, and women's ears
are long."</p>

<p>"Women," he answered. "Do you suppose that I keep such trash about
me in my private place? Not so. Here my servants are men who are sworn
to me, and even these leave me at sundown, save for the guard without
my gates."</p>

<p>"So you are a hermit, Kaneke."</p>

<p>"At night I am a hermit, for then I commune with heaven. In the day
I am as other men are, better than some and worse than others."</p>

<p>Now I bethought me of Hans' definition of this strange fellow whom
he described as having two natures and not for the first time marvelled
at the little Hottentot's acumen and deductive powers.</p>

<p>Kaneke led me across the courtyard of beaten polished earth to the
<i>stoep</i> or verandah of his house, which was more or less square in
shape, consisting apparently of two rooms that had doors and windows
after the Arab fashion, or rather window-places closed with mats, for
there was no glass. On this <i>stoep</i> were two chairs, large
string-seated chairs of ebony with high backs, such as are sometimes
still to be found upon the East Coast. The view from the place was
fine, for beneath at the foot of a precipice lay the river bed, and
beyond it stretched a great plain. When I was seated Kaneke went into
the house where a lamp was burning, and returned with a bottle of
brandy, two glasses, curious old glasses, by the way, and an earthen
vessel of water. At his invitation I helped myself, moderately enough;
then he did the same--not quite so moderately.</p>

<p>"I thought that you were a Mahommedan," I said, with an affectation
of mild surprise.</p>

<p>"Then, Macumazahn, you have a bad memory. Did I not tell you a few
hours ago that I am nothing of the sort. In the daytime out yonder I
worship the Prophet. Here at night, when I am alone, I worship, not the
Moslem crescent, but yonder star," and he pointed to Venus now shining
brightly in the sky, lifted his glass, bowed as though to her, and
drank.</p>

<p>"You play a risky game," I said.</p>

<p>"Not very," he said, shrugging his shoulders. "There are few zealots
in this place, and I think no one who from time to time will not drink
a tot. Moreover, am I not a witch-doctor, and although such arts are
forbidden, have they not all consulted me and are they not afraid of
me?"</p>

<p>"I dare say, Kaneke, but the question is, are you not also afraid of
them?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Macumazahn, at times I am," he answered frankly, "for even a
'heaven-herd'" (he meant a rain-maker) "has a stomach, and some of
these Great Lake people understand poisons very well, especially the
women. You see, Macumazahn, I am a slave who has become a master, and
they do not forget it."</p>

<p>"What do you want with me?" I asked suddenly.</p>

<p>"Your help, Lord. Although I am rich here, I wish to get out of this
place and to return to my own country."</p>

<p>"Well, what is there to prevent you from doing so?"</p>

<p>"Much, Lord, without an excuse, as I told you before sundown.
Indeed, it is impossible. If I tried to go I should be murdered as a
traitor and a renegade. That is the tree of Truth; ask me not to count
the leaves upon it and tell you why or how they grow."</p>

<p>"Good. I see your tree and that it is large. But what do you want
with me, Kaneke?"</p>

<p>"Lord, have I not told you that your repute has reached me and the
rest? Now I add something which you will not believe, but yet is
another tree of Truth. I am not all a cheat, Lord. Visions come to me,
as they did to my fathers; moreover, I have looked upon the face of
Engoi, and he who has seen the Engoi partakes of her wisdom. Lord, in a
vision, I have been warned to seek your help."</p>

<p>"Is that why you blocked my road by raising that Lake tribe against
me, and otherwise, Kaneke, so that I was forced to come to your
town?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Lord, though I do not know who betrayed me to you. Some of the
women, perhaps, or that little yellow man of yours, who hears in his
sleep like a mere-cat--yes, even when he seems to be drunk--and is
quick as a snake at pairing-time. Because of the vision, I did bring
you here."</p>

<p>"What do you want me to do?" I repeated, growing impatient. "I am
tired of talk. Out with it that I may hear and judge, Kaneke."</p>

<p>He rose from his seat, and, stepping to the edge of the verandah,
stared at the evening star as though he sought an omen. Then he
returned and answered:</p>

<p>"You are a wanderer, athirst for knowledge, a seeker for new things,
Lord Macumazahn. You have heard of the holy hidden lake called Mone, on
which no white man has looked, and desire to solve its mysteries, and
what I have told you of it has whetted your appetite. Without a guide
you can never reach that lake. I, who am of the people of its
guardians, alone can guide you. Will you take me with you on your
journey?"</p>

<p>"Hold hard, my friend," I said. "You are putting the tail of the ox
before the horns. I may wish to find that place, or I may not, but it
seems that you <i>must</i> find it, I don't know why, and that you
cannot do so without me."</p>

<p>"It is so," he answered with something like a groan. "I will open
the doors of my heart to you. I must seek that lake, for those upon
whom the Shadow has fallen must follow the Shadow even though its shape
be changed; and it has come to me in a dream, thrice repeated, that if
I try to do so without your help, Lord, I shall be killed. Therefore, I
pray you, give me that help."</p>

<p>Now my business instincts awoke, for though some do not think so, I
am really a very sharp business man, even hard at times, I fear.</p>

<p>"Look here, friend Kaneke," I said, "I came to this country because
I have heard that beyond it is a land full of elephants and other game,
and you know I am a hunter by trade. I did not come to search for a
mysterious lake, though I should be glad enough to see one if it lay in
my path. So the point is this: if I were to consent to undertake a
journey which according to your own account is most dangerous and
difficult, I should require to be paid for it. Yes, to be largely
paid," and I looked at him as fiercely as I suppose a usurer does at a
minor who requires a loan.</p>

<p>"I understand. Indeed, it is natural. Listen, Lord, I have a hundred
sovereigns in English gold that I have saved up coin by coin. When we
get to the lake they shall be yours."</p>

<p>I sprang from my chair.</p>

<p>"A hundred sovereigns! When we get to the lake, which probably we
shall never do! Man, I see that you wish to insult me. Good night,
indeed good-bye, for tomorrow I leave this place," and I lifted my foot
to step off the verandah.</p>

<p>"Lord," he said, catching at my coat, "be not offended with your
slave. Everything I have is yours."</p>

<p>"That's better," I said. "What have you?"</p>

<p>"Lord, I deal in ivory, of which I have a good store buried."</p>

<p>"How much?"</p>

<p>"Lord, I think about a hundred bull-tusks, which I proposed to send
away at next new moon. If you would accept some of them--"</p>

<p>"Some?" I said. "You mean all of them, with the one hundred pounds
for immediate expenses."</p>

<p>He rolled his eyes and sighed, then answered:</p>

<p>"Well, if it must be so, so be it. Tomorrow you shall see the
ivory."</p>

<p>Next he went into the house and returned presently with a canvas
bag, of which he opened the mouth to show me that it was full of
gold.</p>

<p>"Take this on account, Lord," he said.</p>

<p>Again my business instincts came to my help. Remembering that if I
touched a single coin I should be striking a bargain, whatever the
ivory might prove to be worth, I waved the bag away.</p>

<p>"When I have seen the tusks, we will talk," I said; "not before. And
now good night."</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>Next morning a messenger arrived, again inviting me to Kaneke's
house.</p>

<p>I went, accompanied this time by Hans to whom I had explained the
situation, whereon that worthy gave me some excellent advice.</p>

<p>"Be stiff, Baas," he said; "be very stiff, and get everything you
can. It is unfortunate that you do not sell women like these Arabs, for
this Kaneke has a nice lot of young girls whom he would give you for
the asking, were you not too good a Christian. Listen, Baas, I have
learned that you can't ask too much, for yonder Kaneke must get out of
this place, and soon, if he wants to go on living. I am sure of it, and
without your help he is afraid to move."</p>

<p>"Cease your foolish talk," I answered, though in my heart I had come
to the same conclusion.</p>

<p>On reaching the house, as before the gate was opened by Kaneke, who
looked rather doubtfully at Hans, but said nothing. Within, for the
most part arranged against the fence, was the ivory. My eyes gleamed at
the sight of it, for it was a splendid lot though in some cases rather
black with age as if it had been hidden away for a long time, and among
it were three or four tusks as large as any that I ever shot. Hans, who
was a fine judge of ivory, went over it piece by piece, which took a
long time. I made a calculation of its value and from market rates then
prevailing, allowing twenty-five per cent for transport and other
costs, I reckoned that it was worth at least &pound;700, and Hans, I
found, put it somewhat higher.</p>

<p>Then we bargained for a long time, and in the end came to the
following agreement, which I reduced to writing: I undertook to
accompany Kaneke to his own country of the Dabanda tribe, unless,
indeed, sickness or disaster of any sort made this impossible, after
which I was to be at liberty to return or to go where I would. He, on
his part, was to pay me the ivory as a fee, also to deliver it free to
my agent at Zanzibar, a man whom I trusted, who was to sell it to the
best advantage and to remit the proceeds to my bank at Durban.</p>

<p>Further, the bag which proved to contain one hundred and three
sovereigns was handed over to me. At this I rejoiced at the time,
though afterwards I regretted it, for what is the use of dragging about
gold in wild places where it has no value? Kaneke undertook also to
guide me to his country, to arrange that I should be welcome there and
generally to protect me in every way in his power.</p>

<p>Such, roughly, was our contract which I concluded with secret
exultation while that ivory was before my eyes. I signed it in my
large, bold handwriting; Kaneke signed it in crabbed Arabic characters
of which he had acquired some knowledge; and Hans signed it as a
witness with a mark, or rather a blot, for in making it he split the
pen. Thus all was finished and I went away exultant, as I have said,
promising to return in the afternoon to make arrangements about the
despatch of the ivory and as to our journey.</p>

<p>"Hans," I said, for there was no one else to talk to, "I did that
business very well, did I not? Take a lesson from me and learn always
to strike when the iron is hot. Tomorrow Kaneke might have changed his
mind and offered much less."</p>

<p>"Yes, Baas, very well indeed, though sometimes if the iron is too
hot the sparks blind one, Baas. Only I think that tomorrow Kaneke would
have offered you double, for I know that he has much more ivory buried.
If you had taken a lesson from <i>me,</i> you would have waited, Baas.
Did I not tell you that he <i>must</i> get out of this place and would
pay all he had for your help?"</p>

<p>"At any rate, Hans," I replied, somewhat staggered, "the pay is
good, as much as I could ask."</p>

<p>"That depends upon what price the Baas puts upon his life," said
Hans reflectively. "For my part I do not see that all the tusks of all
the elephants in the world are of any use when one is dead, for they
won't even make a coffin, Baas."</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" I asked angrily.</p>

<p>"Oh, nothing, Baas, except that I believe that we shall both be dead
long before this business is finished. Also have you thought, Baas,
that probably this ivory will never get to the coast at all? Because
you see Kaneke, who, I think, is also good at business, will arrange
for it to be stolen on the road and returned to him later, just as you
or I would have done, Baas, had we been in his place. However, the Baas
has the hundred sovereigns which no doubt will be very useful to eat
when we are starving in some wilderness, or as a bribe to Kaneke's
fetish, whatever it may be. Or--"</p>

<p>Here, unable to bear any more, I turned upon Hans with intent to do
him personal injury, whereon he bolted, grinning, leaving me to wait
upon myself at dinner. It was not a cheerful meal, for, as I reflected,
the little wretch was probably right. To secure very doubtful
advantages I had to let myself in for unknown difficulties and dangers,
in company with a native of whom I knew little or nothing, except that
he was an odd fish, and whose servant I had practically become in
consideration for value received. For even if I never saw that ivory
again, or its proceeds, there were the hundred sovereigns weighing down
my pocket--and my conscience--like a lump of lead.</p>

<p>Most heartily did I wish that I had never touched the business. I
thought of sending back the gold to Kaneke by Hans, but for various
reasons dismissed the idea. Of these the chief was that probably it
would never reach him, not because Hans was dishonest where money was
concerned, but for the reason that it would go against what he called
<i>his</i> conscience, to return anything to a person of the sort from
whom it had been extracted. He might bury it; he might even give it to
that jealous wife from whom he acquired so much backstair information;
but Kaneke, I was sure, would never see its colour unless I took it
myself, which I was too proud to do.</p>

<p>Then suddenly my mood changed, transformed, perhaps, by some
semi-spiritual influence, or as is more likely, by that of a good meal,
for it is a humiliating fact that our outlook upon life and its affairs
depends largely upon our stomach. What a rabbit of a man was I that I
should be scared from a great project by the idle chatter and
prognostications of Hans, uttered probably to exercise his mischievous
mind at my expense. If I were, and on that account turned my face
towards the coast again, Hans, who loved adventure even more than I do,
would be the first to reproach me, not openly, but by means of the
casual arrows of his barbed wit. Moreover, it was useless to run away
from anything, for as he himself had said but yesterday, we must go
where Fate drives us. Well, Fate had driven me to pocket Kaneke's
sovereigns and a kind of note of hand in ivory, so there was an end of
the matter. I would start for the home of the Dabanda people, and for
the unvisited shores of the Lake Mone, and if I never got there, what
did it matter? All our journeyings must end some day, be it next month,
or next year, or a decade hence.</p>

<p>I sent for Hans, who came looking pious and aggrieved, perhaps the
most aggravating of his many moods.</p>

<p>"Hans," I said, "I have made up my mind to go with Kaneke to the
Dabanda country, and if you try to prevent me any more, I shall be
angry with you and send you down to the coast with the ivory."</p>

<p>"Yes, Baas," he answered in a meek voice. "The Baas could scarcely
do less, could he, after taking that fellow's money, which no doubt he
made by selling girls; that is, unless he wished to be called a thief.
Moreover, I never tried to stop the Baas. Why should I when I shall be
glad to go anywhere out of this place, where, to tell the truth, that
jealous little wife of Kaneke who tells me so much, is beginning to
think me too handsome and to roll her eyes and to press her hand upon
her middle whenever she sees me, which makes me feel ill, Baas."</p>

<p>"You mean you make her feel ill, you little humbug," I
suggested.</p>

<p>"No, Baas. I wish it were so, for then I could think better of her.
For the rest, Baas, if I pointed out the dangers of this journey, it
was not for my own self, but only because the Baas's reverend father
left him in my charge and therefore I must do my best to guide him when
I see him going astray."</p>

<p>At this I jumped up and Hans went on in a hurry.</p>

<p>"The Baas will not send me away to the coast with the ivory as he
threatened to do, will he? He knows that in one way I am weak and
perhaps if I was separated from him, grief might cause me to drink too
much of that palm-wine and make myself ill." Then, reading in my face
that I had no such intention, Hans took my hand, kissed it, and
departed.</p>

<p>At the corner of the cook-house he turned and said:</p>

<p>"The Baas has made his will, has he not? So I need only remind him
that if he wishes to write any good-bye-we-shall-meet-in-heaven
letters, he had better do so at once, so that they can be sent down to
the coast with the ivory."</p>

<h1><a name="c03">CHAPTER III</a></h1>

<br>


<h1>THE TRIAL OF KANEKE</h1>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>I will pass over all the details concerning the dispatch of the
ivory on its long road to Zanzibar and our other preparations for
departure. Suffice it to say that the stuff went off all right on the
shoulders of porters, together with a lot more, for Hans guessed well
when he said that Kaneke had plenty of other tusks hidden away,
although he declared that these belonged to someone else. What is more,
here I will state that, strange as it may seem, in due course the ivory
reached Zanzibar in safety and was delivered to my agent, who sold it
according to instructions and, minus his commission, remitted the
proceeds, which were more than I had expected, to my bank in Durban. So
in this matter Kaneke dealt honestly.</p>

<p>What happened to the remainder of the ivory, which I presume to have
been his, I do not know, nor can it have interested him, as he never
returned to receive its price. Nor do I know what other goods went with
that caravan which was led by Arabs, for I was careful not to
inquire.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the insinuations of Hans, I saw no girl slaves, and
imagine them to have been apocryphal. Indeed, I believe that what
Kaneke really dealt in was guns and powder. Once a year a caravan came
up from Zanzibar laden with these and other goods, such as cloth,
calico, and beads, returning with the ivory that Kaneke had collected
in the interval. The money which he made on these transactions was
large and kept in an English bank at Zanzibar, as I learned in after
years. I wonder what became of it.</p>

<p>Well, the string of porters, headed by Arabs mounted upon donkeys,
departed and were no more seen. We, too, prepared to depart. Here I
should explain that my following was limited. I had with me two
gun-bearers, skilled hunters both of them, who had been strongly
recommended to me in Zanzibar and who, having learned my repute as a
professional big-game shot, which had followed me from the South, were
very glad to enter my service. One of these men was, it appeared, an
Abyssinian by birth with a name so unpronounceable that I christened
him Tom, though the natives called him "Little Holes", because his face
was marked with small-pox.</p>

<p>The other was born of a Somali woman and an Arab, or perhaps a
European father. To tell the truth he was remarkably British in his
appearance with a round, open face and almost straight, reddish hair,
although of course--except in certain lights--his skin was dark. His
name, he informed me proudly, speaking in excellent English, for he had
been educated at one of the first Mission schools and served as
gun-bearer to several English sportsmen, was Jeremiah Jackson. Who his
father might have been he had no idea, and as his mother died before he
was five, she had never told him.</p>

<p>This man I called Jerry, because of the natural association of the
name with that of Tom, for who has not heard of Tom and Jerry, the
typical "gay dogs" of the Georgian days of whom my father used to tell
me? Both of them were of about the same age, somewhere between thirty
and forty. Both were Christians of a sort, for Tom belonged to the
Abyssinian section of that faith, and both were brave and competent
men. Of the two Tom had the more dash, but perhaps owing to a European
strain of blood Jerry was the cooler and the more dogged. Soon I became
very friendly with them, but Hans looked upon them suspiciously, at any
rate at first, I think because he was jealous.</p>

<p>These gun-bearers were well paid, according to the rate of that day;
still, as they had come with me to hunt elephants and not to make long
journeys of exploration, I thought it right to explain to them my
change of plans and to give them the opportunity of returning to the
coast with the ivory if they wished.</p>

<p>Tom said at once that he would go on with me to the end of the
journey, whatever it might be, for he was a born adventurer with that
touch of a mystic in him which I have observed to be not uncommon among
such Abyssinians as I have met. Jerry, more cautious, began to talk
about his wife, from whom it appeared he was separated, and his little
daughter who was at a Mission school, which caused Hans, who was
present, to make some sarcastic remark about "family men", who, he
said, should stop at home and nurse the babies. This caused Jerry to
fire up and say that he would come too and that Hans would see which of
them wished to nurse babies before all was done.</p>

<p>When the matter was settled I thanked them both and told them that
Kaneke had given me a hundred pounds in gold, a sum that, in view of
the dangers of the trip, I proposed to divide into three parts, one for
each of them and one for Hans. Now they thanked me warmly, only Jerry
remarked that he thought it probable he would never live to earn his
third, for which he was sorry as it would have been an endowment for
his little daughter.</p>

<p>"You are mistaken," I said. "I propose to give you this money now,
trusting to the honour of you both to stick to me to the end, so that
if there is anyone in whom you put sufficient faith, among those who
are going to the coast with the ivory,"--for this was before the
caravan had started--"you can send it to your friends in his charge."
They were much astonished and, I could see, touched, swearing, both of
them, Tom who was a Protestant by God, and Jerry by the Virgin Mary,
that they would never desert me, but would see the business through to
the end, whatever it might be. When they had finished their
protestations I turned to Hans, who all this while had stood by
twirling his hat with a superior smile upon his ugly little face, and
asked him if he did not thank me for his share.</p>

<p>"No, Baas. I am not going to take the money, so why should I thank
you for nothing? I am not a hired man like these two hunters. I am the
Baas's guardian appointed to look after him by his reverend father, and
when I want anything of the Baas, I take it as a guardian has a right
to do."</p>

<p>Then as he marched off I called after him in Dutch, which the others
did not understand:</p>

<p>"You are a jealous, ill-conditioned little begger, and I shall keep
your share for myself." This I did until eventually he drew it a long
while afterwards. I should add that besides Tom and Jerry I had about
twenty native bearers, who agreed, though very doubtfully, to go on
with me and carry the loads.</p>

<p>As the date fixed for our departure drew near, I observed that
Kaneke grew more and more nervous, though exactly of what he was afraid
I could not understand. He summoned a meeting of the headmen of his
village, at which I was present, and explained that he proposed to
accompany me upon an elephant-shooting trip whence we should return in
due course. This intimation was very ill received, although he had
added that they could elect one of their number to act as father of the
village during his absence. They said that the time was coming when
they expected him to pray for rain, and if he were not there to do so
they would get none.</p>

<p>Here I should explain that the religion of these people was a
strange mixture between that of Mahomet and the superstitions of the
East Coast savages. Indeed a man called Gaika, a truculent, fierce-eyed
fellow, not quite an Arab, for he had a dash of negroid blood, leapt up
and denounced him venomously, ostensibly because of this proposed
journey.</p>

<p>Kaneke, to my astonishment, remained very meek and calm, saying that
he would think the matter over and speak with them again, after which
the meeting broke up.</p>

<p>"What is at the back of all this?" I asked of Hans, who had been
present with me, when we were in our camp again.</p>

<p>"The Baas is very blind," he said. "Does he not see that this Gaika
wishes to kill Kaneke and take his place?"</p>

<p>I pointed out that if it were so he ought to be glad to get rid of
him out of the town.</p>

<p>"Not so," answered Hans, "for they think he is really going to
gather men from other tribes where his name as a witch-doctor is great,
with whom he will return and put them all to death. Baas," he added in
a whisper, "they have a plan to kill Kaneke, whom they both hate and
fear, but they are not quite ready with their plan, which is why they
do not want him to go away."</p>

<p>"How do you know all this--through that woman?" I asked.</p>

<p>Hans nodded.</p>

<p>"Some of it, Baas. The rest I picked up here and there when I seemed
to be asleep, or when I am asking that old fellow who is called a
Mullah to teach me the religion of Mahomet, which he thinks I am going
to adopt. Yet, Baas, I sit in that mosque-hut of his listening to his
nonsense and telling him that my soul is growing oh! so happy, and all
the while I keep my ears open and pick up lots of things. For they
think me very wise, Baas, and tell me plenty which they would not trust
to you."</p>

<p>I looked at Hans with disgust, mixed with admiration, reflecting
that without doubt he had got the hang of the business. But I said no
more, for that place was a nest of spies.</p>

<p>That afternoon I had sent our porters on to a certain spot about
three miles away, together with the loads. This I did because I was
afraid lest they should be corrupted and the goods stolen. So now only
Hans, Tom, and Jerry remained with me in the town.</p>

<p>Next morning Hans brought me my coffee as usual and said in a casual
fashion:</p>

<p>"Baas, there is trouble. Kaneke was seized while he was asleep last
night. They broke into his house and tied him with ropes. It seems that
yesterday afternoon he had a quarrel with one of them and killed him
with a blow of his fist, or with a stone that he held in his hand, for
he is strong as an ox."</p>

<p>I whistled and asked what was going to happen.</p>

<p>"They are going to try him for murder this morning, Baas, according
to their law, and they have sent to ask if you will be present at the
trial. What shall I say, Baas?"</p>

<p>At first I was inclined to answer that I would have nothing to do
with the business, but on reflection I remembered that if I did so it
would be set down to fear; also that I had taken Kaneke's ivory and
gold and that it would be mean to desert him in his trouble. So I sent
an answer to say I would attend the trial with my servants.</p>

<p>At the appointed hour we went accordingly, armed, all four of us,
and at the gate of the town were informed that the trial was to take
place at the Tree of Council, which, it will be remembered, stood
outside the village. So thither we marched and on arrival found all the
population of the place, numbering perhaps three or four hundred
people, assembled around the tree but outside of its shadow. In that
shadow sat about a dozen white-robed men, elders, I suppose, whom I
took to be the judges, some of them on the ground and some on
stools.</p>

<p>As we advanced through the crowd towards them they stared doubtfully
at our rifles, but in the end I was given a seat on the right of the
Court, if so it may be called, but at a little distance, while my three
retainers stood behind me. We were not spoken to, nor did we speak.
Presently the crowd parted, leaving an open lane up which marched
Kaneke with his hands bound behind his back, guarded by six men armed
with spears. I noted that all looked upon him coldly as he went by. To
judge by their faces he had not a friend among them.</p>

<p>Finally he was placed in such a position that he had the judges, who
sat with their backs to the trunk of the tree, in front of him, with
myself on his right, and the audience on his left. There he stood
quietly, a fine and striking figure notwithstanding his bonds, taller
by a head than any of that company. Somehow he reminded me of Samson
bound and being led in to be mocked by the Philistines, so much so that
I wondered where Delilah might be. Then I remembered Hans' tale of the
jealous wife and thought that I knew--which I didn't. He rolled his big
eyes about him, taking in everything. Presently they fell upon me, to
whom he bowed. Of his judges he took no notice at all, or, for the
matter of that, of the people either.</p>

<p>The "Mullah man", as Hans called the priest, opened the proceedings
with some kind of prayer and many genuflexions. Then Gaika, who
appeared to act as Attorney General and Chief Justice rolled into one,
set out the case at considerable length and with much venom. He
narrated that Kaneke was a slave belonging to some strange people, who
by murder many years before, and cunning, had acquired authority over
them. Then he proceeded to detail all his crimes as a ruler which, if
he could be believed, were black indeed. Among them were cruelty,
oppression, theft, robbery of women, and I know not what besides.</p>

<p>These were followed by a string of offences of another class:
necromancy which was against the law of the Prophet, bewitchments,
raising of spirits, breaches of the law of Ramadan, betrayal of the
Faith by one who was its secret enemy, worship of strange gods or
devils, drinking of spirituous liquors, plottings with their enemies
against the people, midnight sacrifice of lambs and infants to the
stars, and so forth. Lastly came the immediate charge, that of the
murder of an elder on the previous day. For all of these crimes Gaika
declared the slave and usurper Kaneke to be worthy of death.</p>

<p>Having settled his hash in this fashion, he sat down and called upon
the prisoner to plead.</p>

<p>Kaneke answered in a resonant voice that struck me, and I think all
present, as powerful and impressive.</p>

<p>"To what purpose is it that I should plead," he said, "seeing that
my chief judge and enemy has already declared me guilty of more crimes
than anyone could commit if he lived for a hundred years? Still,
letting the rest be, I will say that I am guilty of one thing, namely
of killing a man yesterday in a quarrel, in order to prevent him from
stabbing me, though it is true that I did not mean to kill him, but
only to fell him to the ground; so that it was Allah who killed him,
not I. Now I will tell you, O people, why I am put upon my trial here
before you, I who have lifted you up from nothingness into a state of
wealth and power.</p>

<p>"It is that yonder Gaika may take my place as your headman. Good. He
is welcome to my place. Know that I weary of ruling over you and
protecting you. What more need I say? It is enough. For a long while
you have plotted to kill me. Now let me go my way, and go you
yours."</p>

<p>"It is not enough," shouted Gaika. "You, O Kaneke, say that you
would accompany the white hunter, Macumazahn yonder, to shoot
elephants. It is a lie. You go to raise against us the tribes to the
north who have a quarrel with us from our father's time, saying that
these seized their young people and sold them as slaves. We know that
it is your plan and it is for that reason that for years we have never
allowed you to leave our town. Nor shall you leave it now. Nay, you
shall stay here for ever while your spirit dwells in hell, where
wizards go."</p>

<p>He ceased, and from the audience rose a murmur of applause. Whatever
his good qualities might be--if he had any--evidently Kaneke was not
popular among his flock. As the prisoner made no answer, Gaika went on,
addressing the other judges thus:</p>

<p>"My brothers, you have heard. To call witnesses is needless, since
some of you saw this Kaneke murder our brother yesterday. Is he guilty
of this and other crimes?"</p>

<p>"He is guilty," they answered, speaking all together.</p>

<p>"Then what should be his punishment?"</p>

<p>"Death," they answered, again speaking all together, while the
audience echoed the word "Death".</p>

<p>"Kaneke," shouted Gaika in triumph, "you are doomed to die. Not one
among these hundreds asks for mercy on you; no, not even the women. Nor
have you any children to plead for you, since doubtless, being a
magician, you slew them unborn lest they should grow up to kill you.
Yet according to the law it is not lawful that you should be despatched
at once. Therefore we send you back to your own house under guard, that
there you may pray to Allah and His Prophet for forgiveness of your
sins. Tomorrow at the dawn you shall be brought back here and beaten to
death with clubs, that we may not shed your blood. Have you heard and
do you understand?"</p>

<p>Then at length Kaneke spoke again. Showing no fear, he spoke
quietly, almost indifferently, yet in so clear a voice that none could
miss a word, saying in the midst of a deep silence:</p>

<p>"O Gaika, son of a dog, and all the rest of you, sons and daughters
of dogs, I hear and I understand. So tomorrow you would beat me to
death with clubs. It may happen or it may not, but if I know I shall
not tell you. Still, listen to the last wisdom that you shall hear from
my lips. You are right when you say that I am a magician. It is so, and
as such I have foreknowledge of the future. I call down a curse on you
all. Let Allah defend you if he can, and will, and Mahomet make prayer
for you. This is the curse: a great sickness shall fall on you; I think
it will begin tonight. I think that some who are already sick are
seated yonder," and he nodded towards the crowd, "although they know it
not. Yes, they began to be sick a minute ago, when the words of cursing
left my lips" (here there was a sensation among the audience, every one
of them staring at his neighbour). "Most of you will die of this
sickness because after I am gone there will be none to doctor you. The
rest will flee away. They will scatter like goats without a herd. They
will be taken by those whose sons and daughters you used to steal, and
become slaves and die as slaves."</p>

<p>Then he turned towards me and added, "Farewell, Lord Macumazahn. If
it is fated that in flesh I cannot guide you on your journey to the
place whither you would go, yet fear not, for my spirit will guide you
and when you are come there safely, then give a message from me to one
of whom I have spoken to you, which message shall be delivered to you,
perhaps in the night hours when you are asleep. I do not ask you to
lift your gun and shoot this rogue," and he nodded towards Gaika,
"because you are but one and would be overwhelmed with your servants.
Nay, I only ask you to hearken to the message when it comes and to do
what it bids you."</p>

<p>Not knowing what to say I made no answer to this peculiar appeal,
although Hans, to judge by his mumblings and fidgets, appeared to wish
me to say something. As I still declined, with his usual impertinence
he took it upon himself to act as my spokesmen, saying in his debased
Arabic:</p>

<p>"The great lord, my master, bids me inform you, Kaneke, that he is
sorry you are going to be killed. He tells me to say also that, if you
are killed and become a spook, he begs that you will keep away from
him, as spooks, especially of those who are magicians and have been put
to death for their evil deeds, are not nice company for anyone."</p>

<p>When I heard this, indignation took away my breath, but before I
could speak a word Gaika addressed me fiercely, crying out:</p>

<p>"White Wanderer, we believe that you are in league with this
evil-doer and plot mischief against us. Get out of our town at once,
lest you share his fate."</p>

<p>Now this unprovoked assault made me furious, and I answered in the
first words that came to my tongue:</p>

<p>"Who are you that tell lies and dare to talk to me of Fate? Let my
fate be, fellow, and have a care for your own, which perhaps is nearer
than you think."</p>

<p>Little did I guess when I spoke thus, at hazard as it seemed, that
very soon doom would overtake this ruffian, and by my hand. Are we
sometimes filled with the spirit of prophecy, I wonder? Or do we,
perhaps, know everything on our inmost souls whence now and again
bursts a rush of buried truth?</p>

<p>After this the company broke up in confusion. Kaneke was hustled
away by his guards; men who waved their spears in a threatening fashion
advanced upon us and were so insolent that at last I looked round and
lifted the rifle I carried--I remember that it was one of the first
Winchester repeaters of a sort that carried five cartridges. Thereon
they fell back and we were allowed to regain our huts in peace.</p>

<p>I did not stop there long. Nearly all our gear had been sent forward
with the bearers; indeed, no more of it remained than the four of us
could carry ourselves, although the arrangement was that some of
Kaneke's men should do us this service on the morrow. As this was now
out of the question we loaded ourselves, also a donkey that I
possessed, with blankets, guns, cooking-pots, ammunition, and I know
not what besides, and started, I riding on the donkey and looking, as I
have since reflected, like the White Knight in <i>Alice in
Wonderland.</i></p>

<p>Then, keeping clear of the town, we trekked for the place where our
bearers were encamped, reaching it unmolested about an hour later. This
spot, chosen by myself, was on the lowest slope of a steep hill covered
with thorn trees, through which ran a little stream from a spring
higher up the slope. The first thing I did was to cut down a number of
these thorns and drag them together into a fence, making what is called
a <i>boma</i> in that part of Africa, behind which we could protect
ourselves if necessary. By the time that this was done and my tent was
pitched, it was late in the afternoon. Feeling tired, more, I think,
from anxiety than exertion, I lay down and after musing for a while
upon the fate of the unfortunate Kaneke and wishing, much as I disliked
the man, that I could save him from a doom I believed to be unjust,
which seemed impossible, I fell asleep, as I can do at any time. In my
sleep a curious dream came to me, which after all was not wonderful,
seeing how my mind was occupied.</p>

<p>I dreamed that Kaneke spoke to me, though I could not see him, but
distinctly I heard, or seemed to hear, his voice saying:</p>

<p>"Follow the woman. Do what the woman tells you, and you will save
me."</p>

<p>Twice I heard this, and then I do not know how long afterwards, I
woke up, or rather was awakened by Hans setting some food upon the camp
table near the tent. On going out I saw that it was night, for the full
moon was just rising and already giving so clear a light in a cloudless
sky, that I could see to eat without the aid of a lamp.</p>

<p>"Hans," I said presently, "what did Kaneke mean when he talked of a
great sickness that was about to smite the town?"</p>

<p>"The Baas observes little," answered Hans. "Did he notice nothing
among the people of that caravan which took away the ivory?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I noticed that they were a dirty lot and smelt so much that I
kept clear of them."</p>

<p>"If the Baas had come a little closer, he would have seen that two
or three of them had pimples coming all over their faces."</p>

<p>"Small-pox?" I suggested.</p>

<p>"Yes, Baas, small-pox, for I have seen it before. Also, they had
been mixing with the people of the town who have not had small-pox for
many years, for Kaneke kept it away by his charms, or stopped it when
it broke out. Baas, this time he did not keep it away, and quite a
number of the townspeople, as I heard this morning, are feeling bad,
with sore throats and headaches, Baas. Kaneke knew all this as well as
I do and that is why he talked about a pestilence. It is easy to
prophesy when one knows, Baas."</p>

<p>"Is it easy to send dreams, Hans?" I asked; then before he could
answer I told him of the words I had seemed to hear in my sleep.</p>

<p>For a moment I caught sight of a look of astonishment upon Hans'
wrinkled and impassive countenance. Then he answered in an unconcerned
fashion:</p>

<p>"I dare say, Baas, if one knows how. Or perhaps Kaneke sent no
dream. Perhaps the Baas heard me and the woman talking together, for
she is here and waiting to see the Baas after he has eaten."</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<center>
<h1><a name="c04">CHAPTER IV</a></h1>

<br>


<h1>WHITE-MOUSE</h1>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>"A woman!" I said, springing up. "What woman?"</p>

<p>"Kaneke's jealous wife who likes me so much, she whom they call
White-Mouse because she is so quick and silent, I suppose. She has a
plan to save that bull of a man, just as the dream said, or you
overheard."</p>

<p>"Then she must be fond of him after all, Hans."</p>

<p>"I suppose so, Baas. Or perhaps she thinks she will get him back
again now, because some other woman, of whom she is jealous, has got
small-pox, of which she hopes that she will die, or become very ugly.
At least that is her tale, Baas."</p>

<p>"I will see her at once," I said.</p>

<p>"Best eat your supper first, Baas; it is always wise to keep women
waiting a while, for that makes them think more of you."</p>

<p>Knowing that Hans always had a reason for what he said, even when he
seemed to be talking the most arrant nonsense, I took his advice.</p>

<p>When I had finished my food he led me to a patch of bush that grew
round a pool at the foot of the slope about two hundred yards from the
camp. We entered and presently from beneath a tree a little woman
glided out so silently that she might have been a ghost, and stood
still with the moonlight falling on her white robes. She threw back a
hood that covered her head, revealing her face, which was refined and
in its way very pretty; also so fair for an Arab that I thought she
must have European blood in her. She looked at me a little while,
searching my face with her dark, appealing eyes, then suddenly threw
herself on her knees, took my hand, and kissed it.</p>

<p>"That will do," I said, lifting her up. "What do you want with
me?"</p>

<p>"Lord," she said in Arabic, speaking in a low, impassioned voice, "I
am that slave of Kaneke whom here they call White-Mouse, though
elsewhere I have another name. Although he has treated me badly, for he
who loves a Shadow cares for no woman, his spell is still upon me.
Therefore I would pray you to save him if you can."</p>

<p>"Me!"</p>

<p>"Yes, Lord, you." Then as I said nothing she went on quickly, "I
know that you white men do not work without pay, and I have nothing to
give you, except myself. I will be a good servant to you and Kaneke
will not mind. He has told me to go where I will."</p>

<p>"Don't be frightened, Baas," whispered Hans into my ear in Dutch.
"When she says you--she must mean me."</p>

<p>I hit him in the middle with the point of my elbow, which stopped
his breath. Then I said:</p>

<p>"Set out your plan, White-Mouse, if you have one. But please
understand that I do not want you as a servant."</p>

<p>"Then you can drive me away, Lord, for if you do my will, your slave
I shall be till death. Only one thing do I ask, that you do not give me
to that little yellow monkey, or to either of your hunters."</p>

<p>"How well she acts!" grunted the unconquered Hans behind me.</p>

<p>"The plan, the plan," I said.</p>

<p>"Lord, it is this: there is a path up the cliff on the crest of
which is the house of Kaneke, wherein he lies bound awaiting death at
the rising of the morrow's sun. It is known to few; indeed only to
Kaneke and myself. I will lead you with your two hunters and this
yellow one up that path and into Kaneke's house. There, if it be
needful, you can deal with those who guard him--there are but three of
them, for the rest watch without the fence--and get him away down the
cliff."</p>

<p>"This is nonsense," I said. "I examined that cliff when I visited
Kaneke. There is no fence upon its edge because it overhangs in such a
fashion that without long ropes, such as we have not got, made fast
above, it cannot be climbed or descended."</p>

<p>"It seems to do so, Lord, but beneath its overhanging crest there is
a hole, which hole leads into a tunnel. This tunnel ends beneath the
pavement of Kaneke's house just in front of where he sits to watch the
stars. Do you understand, Lord?"</p>

<p>I nodded, for I knew that she meant the <i>stoep</i> where Kaneke
and I had drunk brandy and water together.</p>

<p>"The pavement is solid," I said. "How does one pass through it?"</p>

<p>"A block of the hard floor, which is made of lime and other things
so that it is like stone, can be moved from beneath. I have its secret,
Lord. That is all. Will you come with me now? The beginning of the
gorge is not very far from this place which, as you know, by any other
road is a long way from the town. Therefore we need not start yet
because I do not wish to reach the house until two hours after
midnight, when all men are asleep, except those who watch the sick in
the town, where a pestilence has broken out, as Kaneke foretold, and
these will take little heed if they hear a noise."</p>

<p>"No, I won't," I answered firmly. "This is a mad business. Why
should I give my life and those of my servants to try to save Kaneke,
whom I have only known for a week or two and who may be all that his
enemies say?"</p>

<p>She considered the point, then answered:</p>

<p>"Because he alone can guide you to that hidden place whither you
wish to go."</p>

<p>"I don't wish to go anywhere in particular," I replied testily;
"unless it is back to Zanzibar."</p>

<p>Again she considered, and said:</p>

<p>"Because you have taken Kaneke's ivory and gold, Lord."</p>

<p>At this I winced a little and then replied:</p>

<p>"I took the ivory and gold in payment for services to be rendered to
Kaneke, if he could accompany me upon a certain journey, and he paid,
asking nothing in return if he could not do so. Through no fault of
mine he is unable to come, and therefore the bargain is at an end."</p>

<p>"That is well said, Lord, in the white man's merchant-fashion. Now I
have another reason to which I think any man will listen. You should
help Kaneke because I, your slave, who am a woman young and fair, pray
you to do so."</p>

<p>"Ah! she is clever; she knows the Baas," I heard Hans mutter
reflectively, words that hardened my heart and caused me to reply:</p>

<p>"Not for the sake of any woman in Africa, nor of all of them put
together, would I do what you ask, White-Mouse. Do you take me for a
madman?"</p>

<p>She laughed a little in a dreary fashion and answered:</p>

<p>"Indeed I do not, who see that it is I who am mad. Hearken, Lord:
like others I have heard tales of Macumazahn. I have heard that he is
generous and great-hearted; one who never goes back upon his word, a
staff to lean on in the hour of trouble, a man who does not refuse the
prayer of those in distress; brave too, and a lover of adventure if a
good cause may be served, a great one whom it pleases to pretend to be
small. All these things I have heard from that yellow man, and others;
yes, and from Kaneke himself, and watching from afar, although you
never knew I did so, I have judged these stories to be true. Now I see
that I am mistaken. This lord Macumazahn is as are other white traders,
neither better nor worse. So it is finished. Unaided I am not able to
save Kaneke, as by my spirit I have sworn that I would. Therefore I
pray your pardon, Lord, who have put you to trouble, and here before
your eyes will end all, that I may go to make report of this business
to those I serve far away."</p>

<p>While I stared at her, wondering what she meant, also how much truth
there was in all this mysterious tale, suddenly she drew a knife from
her girdle, and tearing open her robe, lifted it above her bared
breast. I sprang and seized her wrist.</p>

<p>"You must love this man very much!" I exclaimed, more, I think, to
myself than to her.</p>

<p>"You are mistaken, Lord," she answered, with her strange little
laugh. "I do not love him; indeed I think I hate him who have never
found one whom I could love--as yet. Still, for a while he is my
master, also I have sworn to hold him safe by certain oaths that may
not be broken and--I keep my word, as I must do or perish
everlastingly."</p>

<p>For a little while there was silence between us. Never can I forget
the strangeness of that scene. The patch of bush by the edge of the
pool, the little open space where the bright moonlight fell, and
standing full in that moonlight which shone upon the whiteness of her
rounded breast, this small, elfin-faced woman with the dark eyes and
curling hair, a knife in her raised right hand.</p>

<p>Then myself, much perplexed and agitated, rather a ridiculous
figure, as I suspect, clasping her wrist to prevent that knife from
falling; and in the background upon the edge of the shadow, sardonic,
his face alight with the age-old wisdom of the wild man who had eaten
of the tree of Knowledge, interested and yet indifferent, hideous and
yet lovable--the Hottentot, Hans. And the look upon that beautiful
woman's face, for in its way it was beautiful, or at any rate most
attractive, the inscrutable look, suggestive of secrets, of mysteries
even--oh! I say I shall never forget it all.</p>

<p>As we stood thus facing each other like people in a scene of a play,
a thought came to me, this thought--if that woman was prepared to die
because she had failed in an effort to save from death the man whom she
declared she hated (why was she prepared to die and why did she hate
him? I wondered), ought I not to try to save her even at some personal
risk to myself? Also if I could, ought I not to help Kaneke, whose
goods I had taken? Certainly it was impossible to allow her to immolate
herself in this fashion before my eyes. I might take away her knife,
but if I did she could find a second; also there were many other roads
to self-destruction by which she might travel.</p>

<p>"Give me that dagger," I said, "and let us talk."</p>

<p>She unclasped her hand and it fell to the ground. I set my foot upon
it and loosed her.</p>

<p>"Listen," I went on. "I am minded to do what you wish if I can."</p>

<p>"Yes, Lord, already I have read that in your face," she replied,
smiling faintly.</p>

<p>"But, White-Mouse," I continued, "I am not the only one concerned. I
cannot undertake this business alone. Others must risk their lives as
well. Hans here, for instance, and I suppose the two hunters. I cannot
lay any commands upon them in such a matter and I do not know if they
will come of their own will."</p>

<p>She turned and looked at the Hottentot, a question in her eyes. Hans
fidgeted under her gaze, then he spat upon the ground and said:</p>

<p>"If the Baas goes I think that the Baas will be a fool. Still, where
the Baas goes, there I must go also, not to pull Kaneke out of a trap,
but because I promised the Baas's reverend father that I would do so.
As for those other men I cannot say. I think they will answer, 'No,
thank you', but if they reply, 'Oh yes', then I believe that we should
be better without them, because they are so stupid and think so much
about their souls that they would be sure to grow frightened at the
wrong time, or to make a noise and bring us all to trouble. In a hole
such as White-Mouse talks of, two men are better than four. Also it
would be wiser to send Tom and Jerry on with the porters, for should we
drag Kaneke out of this hole, those Arabs will try to follow and drag
him back, and the farther off we are with the stores the safer we shall
be. Porters go slowly, so we can catch them up, Baas."</p>

<p>"You hear," I said to the woman. "What is your word?"</p>

<p>"This yellow one, whom I thought but a vain fool, is wise--for once,
Lord. What has to be done I cannot do alone, for there must be some to
deal with the guards and hold the mouth of the hole while I cut
Kaneke's bonds. Yet for this business two will serve as well as four;
indeed better, for they can get back into the tunnel more quickly.
Therefore I say do as the yellow man says. Order your hunters to march
on with the porters and the stores as long before the break of day as
the men will move. If you escape with Kaneke, you can run upon their
spoor and join them much faster than will the Arabs who must go round.
Then if the Arabs overtake you, they will be tired and you can beat
them off with your guns."</p>

<p>"And what will you do?" I asked curiously, for I noticed that she
left herself out of the plan.</p>

<p>"Oh! I do not know," she answered, with another of her strange
smiles. "Lord, have I not said that I am your slave? Doubtless in this
fashion or in that I shall follow my master as a slave should, or
perhaps I shall go before him."</p>

<p>Now I remembered that she had spoken of Kaneke as her "master", and
presumed that she alluded to him, although in the hyperbole of her
people she spoke of herself as my slave. However, I did not pursue the
subject, which at the time interested me little, who had more important
matters to consider. Indeed, I set myself to extract details from her
which I need not enumerate, and to examine her scheme of rescue.</p>

<p>When I had learned all I could, bidding the woman, White-Mouse, to
remain hidden, I went back to the camp with Hans and sent for Tom and
Jerry. In as careless a fashion as I could, I told them that with Hans
I must return towards the town to speak with a man who had promised to
meet me secretly upon a matter of importance. Then I ordered them to
rouse the porters two hours before dawn and to march on with them
towards a certain hill which we had all visited together upon a little
shooting-expedition I had made while we were at Kaneke's town, to kill
duiker buck and <i>pauw,</i> as we called bustards, for a change of
food.</p>

<p>Although I could see that they were troubled, Tom and Jerry said
that they would obey my instructions and, that there should be no
mistake, fetched the headman of the porters, that I might repeat them
to him, which I did. This done, they went away to sleep, Tom saying, as
he bade me good night, that he would have preferred to accompany me
back to the town where he thought I might come into danger. I thanked
him, remarking that I was quite safe. So we parted; I wondering whether
I should ever see them again and what they would do if I returned no
more. Travel back to the coast, probably, and become rich according to
their ideas by selling the guns and goods.</p>

<p>Then I lay down to rest for a while, making Hans do likewise.</p>

<p>At the appointed time I woke from my doze, as I can always do, and
left the tent to find Hans awaiting me without and checking such things
as we must carry. These were few--a water-bottle filled with cold tea,
a small flask of spirits, a strip or two of <i>biltong</i> or dried
meat in case we should need food, and a few yards of thin cord. For
arms I took a Winchester repeater and a pocketful of cartridges, also a
revolver and a sharp butcher's knife in a sheath. Hans had no rifle,
but carried two revolvers and a knife, also a couple of candles and a
box of matches.</p>

<p>Having made sure that we had collected everything and packed our
other belongings to be cared for by Tom and Jerry as arranged, we
slipped away to the patch of bush by the pool, taking with us extra
food, for we remembered that White-Mouse must be hungry. We did not
find her at once, whereon Hans explained to me that having made fools
of us, doubtless she had run away. While he was still talking I saw her
leaning against the trunk of a tree. Or rather I saw her eyes, which at
first I took for those of some animal, for she was no longer a white
figure, but a black, having covered her white robe with a thin dark
garment she had brought with her in a bundle. I offered her the food,
but she shook her head, saying:</p>

<p>"Nay, I eat no more"--words which frightened me a little.</p>

<p>Indeed, altogether there was something fateful and alarming about
this woman. She glanced at the moon, then whispered:</p>

<p>"Lord, it is time to depart. Be pleased to follow me and do not
smoke, or make fire, or talk too loud."</p>

<p>So off she went, gliding ahead like a shadow, while we marched
after, I with a doubting heart. Our road ran along the bank of a little
stream, of which the spring I have spoken of seemed to be the source,
that wended its way through thin bush to the mouth of the gorge, which
here sloped up to the high lands. Doubtless it was this stream, once a
primeval torrent, that in the course of thousands of years dug out this
cleft in the bosom of the earth. As we went Hans murmured his
reflections into my ear.</p>

<p>"This is a strange journey, Baas, made at night, when we ought to be
asleep. I wonder that the Baas should have undertaken it. I think,
although he does not know it, he would never have done so had not
White-Mouse been so pretty. Perhaps the Baas has noted that when a
woman asks for anything of a man, generally he finds it impossible to
give it her if she be old and ugly, and quite possible if she is young
and very pretty."</p>

<p>"Rubbish!" I answered. "I gave way because, if I had not,
White-Mouse would have killed herself, and for no other reason."</p>

<p>"Yes, but if she had been a hideous old grandmother, with a black
face wrinkled like that of the Baas, he would not have cared whether
she killed herself or not. For who wants a slave with a skin like the
hide of a buck that has lain for three months in the sun and rain?"</p>

<p>"As I have told you, I want no slave, Hans," I answered
indignantly.</p>

<p>"Ah! so the Baas says now, but sometimes he changes his mind. Thus a
little while ago the Baas swore that never, never would he go up the
hole to try to save Kaneke. And yet we are taking this long walk with
lions about and God knows what at the end of it, to do what the Baas
said could not be done. Why, then, did he change his mind, unless it is
because that woman is such a pretty mouse with big eyes and a queer
smile and not an ugly old yellow-toothed rat? Also, is he sure that all
this story of hers is true? For my part I don't believe it, and even
doubt whether she is Kaneke's wife as she pretended to me."</p>

<p>At this moment we began to enter the gorge, and our guide turned and
laid her finger on her lips in token that we must be silent. Of this I
was very glad, for really Hans' jeers were intolerable.</p>

<p>Very soon we descended into the cleft itself, which proved to be a
huge donga with sheer sides quite two hundred feet high where it was
deepest. The bottom along which the shrunken river ran was strewn with
boulders washed from the cliffs above, that made progress slow and
difficult. Especially was this so as we scrambled down the deeps, where
often little of the moonlight reached us, and sometimes even the sky
was hidden by tropical shrubs and tall palms and grasses which grew
along the edge of the torrent bed.</p>

<p>Fortunately the journey was not very long, for after about half an
hour of this break-back work White-Mouse halted.</p>

<p>"Here is the place," she whispered. "Listen. You can hear the dogs
in the town above."</p>

<p>It was true; I could, and the sound of those brutes howling at the
moon, as they do at night in Africa, was eerie enough in our depressing
circumstances.</p>

<p>"This is the place," she repeated, then after studying the sky a
while, added: "Presently will be the time. Meanwhile let us rest, for
we shall need all our strength."</p>

<p>Motioning to Hans to remain where he was, she led me to a flat stone
out of his hearing, on which I sat down, while she crouched on the
ground at my feet, native fashion, a little black ball in the shadow
with the faint light gleaming upon a white patch that I knew to be her
face.</p>

<p>"Lord," she said, "you go upon a dangerous business, yet I say to
you, fear nothing for yourself or the yellow man."</p>

<p>"Why? I fear much."</p>

<p>"Lord, those who have to do with Kaneke's people, as I have from a
child, catch something of their wisdom and mind; also I too have been
taught to read the stars he worships."</p>

<p>"So our friend is an astrologer," thought I to myself. That is new
to me in Africa, but aloud I said:</p>

<p>"Well, what wisdom have you caught or read in the stars?"</p>

<p>"Only that you are both safe, Lord, now and on the journey you will
make with Kaneke; yes, and for many years after."</p>

<p>"I am glad to hear it," I remarked somewhat sarcastically, though in
my heart I was cheered, as even the most instructed and civilized of us
are when anyone speaks words of good omen. Also in that darksome place
at the dead of night, on the edge of a desperate adventure, a little
comfort went a long way, for when the bread is dry some butter is
better than none at all, as Hans used to observe.</p>

<p>"Lord, a word more and I cease to trouble you. Do you believe in
blessings, Lord?"</p>

<p>"Oh yes, White-Mouse, though I don't see any about me just now."</p>

<p>"You are wrong, Lord; I see them. They are thick upon your head,
they shall be with you through life, and afterwards thousands shall
love you. Among them is that blessing which I lay upon you."</p>

<p>"You are very kind, I am sure, White-Mouse. But as you say you hate
this Kaneke I don't understand why you should bless me for what I am
trying to do."</p>

<p>"No, Lord, and perhaps while you live you never will. Yet I would
have you know one thing. I am not Kaneke's jealous wife as I made
yonder yellow one believe, or his wife at all, or any man's, any more
than my name is White-Mouse. Lord, you go to seek a wonderful one whom
I serve, and I think that you will find her far away. Perhaps I shall
be there in her company, and in helping her you will again help me. Now
it is time to be at our work."</p>

<p>Then she took my hand and kissed it. I remember that her kiss felt
like a butterfly alighting on my flesh, and that her breath was
wonderfully sweet. Next she beckoned to Hans, who, devoured by
curiosity, was glowering at us from a distance, and led the pair of us
a little way up the cliff which sloped at its bottom because of debris
washed up by the torrent in ancient days, or perhaps fallen from above.
We came to some bushes, in the midst of which lay a large boulder. Here
she halted and spoke to us in a whisper, saying:</p>

<p>"On the farther side of that stone is the mouth of the cleft. If you
look you will see that the crest of the cliff overhangs its topmost
part by many feet, so that it is impossible for it to be ascended or
descended, even with any rope the Arabs have, because the height is too
great. As I have told you, this tunnel, or waterway, runs to the top
for the most part underground, though here and there it is open to the
sky. After it reaches that sheer face of the cliff which the stone lip
overhangs, the passage pierces the solid rock and is very steep. Here
two lamps are hid which I will light with the little fire sticks that
your servant has given to me. One lamp must be left as a guide in the
descent when you return; the other I, who go first, will carry to show
you where to set your feet. Do you understand, Lord?"</p>

<p>"Yes, but what I want to know is, what happens when we reach the top
of the tunnel?"</p>

<p>"Lord, as I have said, at its head the hole is closed with a moving
block that seems to be part of the floor of the courtyard of Kaneke's
house. I have its secret and can cause it to open, which I will do
after I have hidden the lamp. Then we must creep into the courtyard.
Kaneke, as I believe, is on the <i>stoep</i> of the house with his
hands tied behind him, and bound with a rope round his middle to a post
that supports the roof of the <i>stoep.</i> It may be, however, that he
is in one of the rooms of the house, in which case our task will be
difficult--"</p>

<p>"Very difficult," I interrupted with a groan.</p>

<p>"My hope is," she went on, taking no heed of my words, "that those
who guard him will be asleep, or perhaps drunk, for doubtless they will
have found the white man's drink that Kaneke keeps in the house, which
they love, all of them, although it is forbidden by their law. Or
Kaneke himself may have told them where it is and begged them to get
him some of it. If so, I shall cut his bonds so that he may come to the
mouth of the hole and climb into it and thus escape."</p>

<p>"And if they are awake and sober--as they ought to be?" I said.</p>

<p>"Then, Lord, you and the yellow man must play your part; it is not
for me to tell you what it is," she answered dryly. "There will not be
many of these men set to keep one who is bound, and the most of the
guard watch outside the fence, thinking that if any rescue is
attempted, it will be from the town. Now I have told you all, so let us
start."</p>

<p>Well, start we did; White-Mouse, going first, went round the boulder
and pulled aside some loose stones, revealing an orifice, into which we
crept after her, Hans nipping in before me. For some way we crawled in
the dark up a slope of rock. Then, as she had said would be the case,
light reached us from the sky because here the cleft was open. Indeed,
there were two or three of these alternating lengths of darkness and
light.</p>

<p>After ten minutes or so of this climbing White-Mouse halted and
whispered:</p>

<p>"Now the real tunnel begins. Rest a while, for it is steep."</p>

<p>I obeyed with gratitude. Presently there was the sound of a match
being struck. She had found the lamp, an earthenware affair filled with
palm-oil such as the Arabs used in those days, and lit it. After the
darkness its light seemed dazzling. By it I saw a round hole running
upwards almost perpendicularly; it was the tunnel which she had told us
pierced the lip of solid cliff that overhung the gorge. To all
appearance it had been made by man, though a long while ago. Perhaps it
was a mine-shaft, hollowed by primeval metal-workers; after all, these
are common in Africa, where I have seen many of them in Matabele
Land.</p>

<p>At any rate, on its walls I noted gleaming specks that I took to be
ore of some sort, but of course this guess may be quite wrong. Up this
shaft ran a kind of ladder with little landing-places at intervals,
made by niches cut in the rock to give foot- and hand-holds. There was
a rope also that must have been fastened to something above, which, I
may add, looked to me rather rotten, as though it had been there a long
while. My heart sank as I contemplated it and the niches, and most
heartily did I wish myself anywhere else than in that beastly hole.
However, it was no use showing fear; there was nothing to be done
except go through with the business, so I held my tongue, though I
heard Hans praying, or cursing, or both, in front of me.</p>

<p>"Forward now. Have no fear," whispered our guide. "Set your hands
and feet in the niches as I do; they will not break away, and the rope
is stronger than it looks."</p>

<p>Then she slung or strapped to her back the second lamp, which I
forgot to say she had lit also and placed in a kind of basket so made
that it could be used in this fashion without setting fire to its
bearer, thus giving us light whereby to climb, and sprang at the face
of the rock. Up she went with an extraordinary nimbleness, which caused
me to reflect in an inconsequent fashion that she was well named Mouse,
a creature that can run up a wall.</p>

<p>We followed as best we could, clasping the rotten-looking rope,
which seemed to be made of twisted buffalo-hide, with our right hands
and the niches in which we must afterwards set our feet with our left.
I think that rope was the greatest terror of this horrible journey;
though, as we were destined to prove, White-Mouse was right when she
said that it was stronger than it looked--very strong, in truth, though
this we did not know at the time.</p>

<p>No, not the greatest, for even worse than the rope, that is when we
had ascended a long way, was the lamp which we had left burning at the
bottom of the hole, because the spark of light it gave showed what a
terrible distance there was to fall if one made a mistake. I only
looked at it once, or at most twice; it frightened me too much. Another
minor trouble in my case was my Winchester repeater that was slung upon
my back, of which the strap cut my shoulder and the lock rubbed my
spine. Much did I regret that I had not followed the example of Hans
and left it behind.</p>

<p>We reached the first landing-place and rested. After eyeing me with
some anxiety, for doubtless my face showed trepidation, Hans, I imagine
to divert my mind, took the chance to deliver a little homily.</p>

<p>"The Baas," he said, wiping the sweat from his face with the back of
his hand, "is very fond of helping people in trouble, a bad habit of
which I hope the Baas will break himself in future. For see what
happens to those who are such fools. Not even to help my own father
would I come into this hole again, especially as I don't know who he
was. However, Baas," he added more cheerfully--for secretly agreeing
with Hans, I made no reply--"if this is an old mine-shaft as I suppose,
think how much worse it must have been for the miners to climb up it
with a hundred-pound bag of ore on their backs, than it is for us;
especially as they weren't Christians, like you and me, Baas, and
didn't know that they would go to heaven if they tumbled off, like we
do. When one is fording a bad river safely, Baas, as we are, it is
always nice to remember that lots of other people have been drowned in
it."</p>

<p>Will it be believed that even then and there that little beast Hans
made me laugh, or at any rate smile, especially as I knew that his
cynicism was assumed and therefore could bring no ill luck on us? For
really Hans had the warmest of hearts.</p>

<p>Presently, off we went again for another spell of niches and
apparently rotten rope, and in due course came safely to the second
landing-place. Here White-Mouse bade us wait a little.</p>

<p>Saying that she would return presently, she went up a third flight
of niches at great speed, and reaching yet another landing-place, did
something--we could not see what.</p>

<p>Then she returned, and her descent was strange to see. Taking the
rope in both hands (afterwards we discovered that it was made fast to a
point or hook of stone on the third landing-place in such fashion that
it hung well clear of the face of the rock below), she came down it
hand over--or rather under--hand, sometimes setting her foot into one
of the niches, but more often swinging quite clear. She was wonderful
to look on; her slight figure illumined by the lantern on her back and
surrounded by darkness, appeared more like a spirit floating in mid-air
than that of a woman. Presently she stood beside us.</p>

<p>"Lord," she said, when she had rested a minute, "I have been to see
whether the catch of the stone which covers the mouth of the hole is in
order. It works well and I have loosed it. Now at a push this stone,
that like the rest of the courtyard is faced with lime plaster, will
swing upwards, for it is hung upon a bar of iron, and remain on edge,
leaving a space large enough for any man to climb into the courtyard by
the little ladder that is set upon the landing-place. Be careful,
however, not to touch the stone when you have passed the opening into
the courtyard, for if so much as a finger is laid upon it, it will
swing to again and make itself fast, cutting off retreat."</p>

<p>"Cannot it be opened from above?" I asked anxiously.</p>

<p>"Yes, Lord, if one knows how, which it is impossible to explain to
you except in the courtyard itself, as perhaps I shall have no time or
chance to do. Still, do not be afraid, for I will fix it with a wedge
so that it cannot shut unless the wedge is pulled away. Nay, ask no
more questions, for I have not time to answer them," she went on
impatiently, as I opened my mouth to speak. "Have I not told you that
all will be well? Follow me with a bold heart."</p>

<p>Then, as though to prevent the possibility of further conversation,
she went to the edge of the resting-place and began to climb, Hans and
I scrambling after her as before. Of this ascent I remember little, for
my mind was so fixed upon what was to happen when we reached the top
that, dreadful as it was, it made small impression on me. Also by now I
was growing more or less used to this steeplejack work, and since I had
seen the woman hanging on to it, gained confidence in the rope. The end
of it was that we reached the third landing-place in safety, being now,
as I reckoned, quite two hundred feet above the spot where the actual
tunnel sprang from the cleft which sometimes went underground and
sometimes was open to the sky.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<center>
<h1><a name="c05">CHAPTER V</a></h1>

<br>


<h1>THE RESCUE</h1>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>When we had recovered breath White-Mouse unfastened the lantern from
her back and showed us a stout wooden ladder with broad rungs almost
resembling steps, which ran from the edge of the resting-place to what
looked like a solid roof, but really was the bottom of the movable
stone.</p>

<p>"Examine it well," she said, "and note that this resting-place is
not beneath the stone, but to the right of it. Therefore I can leave
the lamp burning here that it may be ready for use in the descent; for
if the basket is set in front of the flame the light will not show in
the courtyard above."</p>

<p>This she proceeded to do, and it was then that I noted how the hide
rope was fastened to a hook-shaped point of rock at the edge of the
platform, also--which I did not like--that it was somewhat frayed by
this edge, although originally that length of it had been bound round
with grass and a piece of cloth.</p>

<p>Now we were in semi-darkness and my spirits sank
proportionately.</p>

<p>"What are we to do, White-Mouse?" I asked.</p>

<p>"This, Lord. I will go up the ladder and push open the stone, as I
told you. Then I will climb into the courtyard and creep to the
<i>stoep</i> where I am sure Kaneke lies bound, hoping that there I may
be able to cut his cords without awakening those who guard him, who, I
trust, will be asleep, or drunk, or both. You and Hans will follow me
through the hole and stand or kneel on either side of it with your
weapons ready. If there is trouble you will use those weapons, Lord,
and kill any who strive to prevent the escape of Kaneke."</p>

<p>Now my patience was exhausted, and I asked her:</p>

<p>"Why should I do this thing? Why should I take the lives of men with
whom I have no quarrel in order to rescue Kaneke, and very probably
lose my own in the attempt?"</p>

<p>"First, because that is what you came here to do, Lord," she
answered quietly. "Secondly, because it is necessary that Kaneke should
be saved in order that he may guide you, which he alone can do, to a
place where you will save others, and thus serve a certain holy one
against whom he has sinned in the past."</p>

<p>Now I remembered the story that this Kaneke had told me about a
mysterious woman who lived on an island in a lake whom he had
affronted, and answered:</p>

<p>"Oh yes, I have heard of her and believe nothing of the tale."</p>

<p>"Doubtless you are right not to believe the tale as Kaneke told it
to you, Lord. Learn that once he tried to work bitter wrong to that
holy one, being bewitched by her beauty; yes, to do sacrilege to our
goddess." (I remembered that "our" afterwards, though at the time I
made no comment.) "Being merciful, she spared him, but because of his
crime misfortune overtook him, and for years he must dwell afar. Now
the hour has come when for certain reasons he is bidden to return and
expiate his evil deeds, and not here must his fate find him,
Lord--"</p>

<p>"Baas," broke in Hans, "it is no use talking to this White-Mouse,
who stuffs our brains with spiders' webs and talks nonsense. She wants
us to save Kaneke for her own ends or those of others of whom she is
the voice, and we have said that we will try. Now either we must keep
our word or break it and climb down this hole again, if we can--which
would be much better. Indeed, Baas, I think we should start--"</p>

<p>Here White-Mouse looked at Hans with remarkable effect, for he
stopped suddenly and began to fan himself with his hat.</p>

<p>"Which advice does the Lord Macumazahn desire to take?" she asked of
me in a cold and quiet voice.</p>

<p>"Go on," I said, nodding towards the ladder, "we follow you."</p>

<p>Next instant she was running up it with Hans at her heels, for as
before, he slipped in before me. I may add that it was quite dark on
that ladder, which was very unpleasant.</p>

<p>Soon something above me swung back. I felt a breath of fresh air on
my face, and looking upwards, saw a star shining in the sky, for at
that moment a cloud had passed over the moon, which star gave me
comfort, though I did not know why it should.</p>

<p>I reached the top of the ladder and saw that White-Mouse had
vanished and that Hans was scrambling into the courtyard. Then he gave
me his hand and dragged me after him. The place was quite quiet and
because of the cloud I could only see the house as a dark mass and
trace the outlines of the <i>stoep,</i> which I remembered very well.
Presently I heard a faint stir upon this <i>stoep</i> and got my rifle
ready; Hans, on the other side of the mouth of the pit, already had his
revolver in his hand.</p>

<p>A while went by, perhaps a minute--it seemed an hour--and looking
upwards, to my dismay, I perceived the edge of the moon appearing
beyond the curtain of cloud. Swiftly she emerged and flooded the place
with light, as an African moon can do. Now I saw all. Coming down the
steps of the <i>stoep,</i> very slowly as though he were cramped by his
bonds, was the great form of Kaneke leaning on the shoulder of the
frail girl, as a man might upon a stick. Pieces of rope still hung to
his arms and legs, and she had a bared knife in her hand. In the shadow
of the <i>stoep</i> I made out the dim figures of men, two I saw, but
in fact there were three, who appeared to be asleep.</p>

<p>As he reached the courtyard Kaneke stumbled and fell on to his hands
and knees with a crash, but recovering himself, plunged towards us. The
men on the <i>stoep</i> sat up--then it was that I counted three.
White-Mouse flung off her dark cloak and stood there in shining white,
looking like a ghost in the moonlight; indeed, I believe her object was
to personate a ghost. If so it was successful as far as two of the men
were concerned, for they howled aloud with terror, crying out something
about <i>Afreets.</i> The third, however, who was bolder or perhaps
guessed the truth, rushed at her. I saw the knife flash and down he
went, yelling in fear and pain. The others vanished, I think into the
house, for I heard them shouting there. Kaneke reached us. The woman
flitted after him, saying:</p>

<p>"Into the pit! Into the pit! Help him, Lord!"</p>

<p>We did so and he scrambled down the ladder.</p>

<p>At this moment a terrific hubbub arose. The guard outside the fence
were rushing through the gate, a number of them, I do not know how
many.</p>

<p>Hans snatched the rifle from my hand and pushed me to the edge of
the hole--I noticed that the gallant fellow did not wish to go first
this time! I clambered down the ladder with great rapidity, calling to
Hans to follow, which he did so fast that he trod upon my fingers.</p>

<p>"Where's White-Mouse?" I said.</p>

<p>"I don't know, Baas. Talking with those fellows up there, I
think."</p>

<p>"Out of the way!" I cried. "She can't be left. They will kill
her!"</p>

<p>I climbed past him up the ladder again until I could look over the
edge of the hole.</p>

<p>This is what I saw and heard: White-Mouse, the knife in her hand,
was haranguing the oncoming Arabs so fiercely that they shrank together
before her, invoking curses on them as I imagine, which frightened them
very much, and pointing now at one and now at another with the knife.
As she called down her maledictions she retreated slowly backwards
towards the mouth of the pit, whence she must have rushed to meet the
men as they burst through the gateway, I presume in order to give us
time to get down the ladder. Suddenly the crowd of them seemed to
recover courage. One shouted:</p>

<p>"It is White-Mouse, not a ghost!" Another invoked Allah; a third
called out: "Kill the foreign sorceress who has brought the spotted
sickness on us and snatched away the star-worshipper."</p>

<p>They came forward--doubtfully lifting their spears, for they did not
seem to have any firearms.</p>

<p>"Give me my rifle," I called to Hans, for in my hurry I forgot that
I had a pistol in my pocket, my purpose being to get on the top step of
the ladder, and thence open fire on them, so as to hold them back till
White-Mouse could join us.</p>

<p>"Yes, Baas," called Hans from below as he began to climb the ladder
again with the rifle in his hand, a slow job, because it cumbered him.
I bent down as far as I could to grasp it, thus lowering my head,
although I still managed to watch what was going on in the
courtyard.</p>

<p>Just as my fingers touched the barrel of the Winchester, White-Mouse
hurled her knife at the first of her attackers. Then she turned,
followed by the whole crowd of them, and ran for the pit. One caught
hold of her, but she slipped from his grasp and, although another
gripped her garment, reached the stone which stood up edgeways some
three feet above the level of the pavement of the courtyard.</p>

<p>In a flash I divined her purpose. It was not escape she sought,
indeed, now that was impossible, but to let fall the block of rock or
cement, and thus make pursuit of us also impossible. Horror filled me
and my blood seemed to freeze, for I understood that this meant that
she would be left in the hands of her enemies.</p>

<p>It was too late to do anything; indeed, as the thought passed my
mind she hurled her weight against the stone (if she had ever wedged it
open, as she said she would, which I doubt, she must have knocked away
the prop with her foot). I saw it begin to swing downwards, and ducked
instinctively, which was fortunate for me, for otherwise it would have
struck my head and killed me. As it was it crushed in the top of the
soft hat I was wearing. Down it came with a clang, leaving us in the
dark.</p>

<p>"Hans," I cried, "bring that lantern and help me to try to push up
this stone!"</p>

<p>He obeyed, although it took a long while, for he had to go back to
the resting-place to fetch it. Then, standing side by side upon the
ladder, we pushed at the stone, but it would not stir a hair's breadth.
We saw something that looked like a bolt, and worked away at it, but
utterly without result. We did not know the trick of the thing, if
there was one. Then I bethought me of Kaneke who all this while was on
the landing-place beneath, and sent Hans to ask him how to raise the
stone. Presently he returned and reported that Kaneke said that if once
it had been slammed down in this fashion, it could only be opened from
above with much labour, if, indeed, this could be done at all.</p>

<p>I ran down the ladder in a fury and found Kaneke seated on the
landing-place, a man bemused.</p>

<p>I reviled him, saying that he must come and move the stone, of which
doubtless he knew the secret, so as to enable us to try to rescue the
woman who had saved him. He listened with a kind of dull patience, then
answered:</p>

<p>"Lord, you ask what cannot be done. Believe me I would help
White-Mouse if I could, if indeed she needs help, but the catches that
loose this mass of rock are very delicate and doubtless were destroyed
by its violent closing. Moreover by this time of a certainty she is
killed, if death can touch her, and even were it possible to lift it,
you would be killed also, for those sons of Satan will wait there
hoping that this may happen."</p>

<p>Still I was not satisfied, and made the man come up the ladder with
me, which he did very stiffly, threatening to shoot him if he did not.
This, to tell the truth, at that moment I would have done without
compunction, so enraged and horrified was I at what had happened which,
perhaps unjustly, I half attributed to him.</p>

<p>Well, he came and explained certain things to me about the catches
whereof I forget the details, after which we pushed with all our might,
till the stave of the ladder on which we stood began to crack, in fact;
but nothing happened. Evidently in some way the block was jammed on its
upper side, or perhaps the pin or hinges upon which it was balanced had
broken. I do not know and it matters nothing.</p>

<p>All was finished. We were helpless. And that poor woman--oh, that
poor woman!--what of her?</p>

<p>I returned to the landing-place and sat down to rest, almost
weeping. Hans, I observed, was in much the same state, without a gibe
or an impertinence left in him.</p>

<p>"Baas," he said, "if we had got out of the hole too, it would have
been no better; worse, indeed, for we should have been killed as well
as White-Mouse, even if we had managed to shoot some of those
Prophet-worshipping dogs before they spotted us. Alas, Baas, I think
that White-Mouse meant to get herself killed from the first. Perhaps
she had had enough of that man," and he nodded towards Kaneke, who sat
brooding and taking no heed, "or perhaps her job was done and she knew
it. Or perhaps she can't be killed, as this Kaneke seems to think."</p>

<p>Listening to him, I reflected that he must be right, for now I
remembered that White-Mouse had spoken several times of the escape of
Hans, Kaneke, and myself, and never of her own, though when she did so
I had not quite caught her drift. The woman meant to die, or knew that
she would die, it did not matter which, seeing that the end was the
same. Or she meant something else that was dark to me.</p>

<p>Presently, Hans spoke again:</p>

<p>"Baas," he said, "this place is a good grave, but I do not want to
be buried in it, and oil in these Arab lamps does not last for ever;
they are not like those of the widow, which the old prophet kept
burning for years and years to cook meal on, as your reverend father
used to tell us. Don't you think we had better be moving, Baas?"</p>

<p>"I suppose so," I answered, "but what about Kaneke? He seems in a
bad way."</p>

<p>"Oh, Baas, let him come or let him stay behind. I don't care which.
Now I will strap the basket with the lantern on to my back as
White-Mouse did, and go first, and you must follow me, and Kaneke can
come when he likes, or stop here and repent of his sins."</p>

<p>He paused, then added (he was speaking in Dutch all this time):</p>

<p>"No, Baas, I have changed my mind. Kaneke had better go first. He is
very heavy, also stiff, and if he came last and fell on to our heads,
where should we be, Baas? It is better that we should fall on Kaneke
rather than that Kaneke should fall on us."</p>

<p>Being puzzled what to do, I turned to speak to the man. Hans, who
was fixing the basket on his back, had set down the lamp which was to
be placed in such a position that its light fell full upon Kaneke. By
it I saw that his face had changed. While I was questioning him about
the bolts of the stone, it had been that of a man bemused, of one who
awakes from a drunken sleep, or has been drugged, or is in the last
stage of terror and exhaustion. Now it was very much alive and grown
almost spiritual, like to the face of one who is rapt in prayer. The
large round eyes were turned upwards as though they saw a vision, the
lips were moving as if in speech, yet no word came from them, and from
time to time they ceased to move, as though the ears listened for an
answer.</p>

<p>I stared at him, then said politely in Arabic:</p>

<p>"Might I ask what you are doing, friend Kaneke?"</p>

<p>He started and a kind of veil seemed to fall over his face; I mean
that it changed again and became normal.</p>

<p>"Lord," he answered, "I was returning thanks for my escape."</p>

<p>"You take time by the nose, for you haven't escaped yet," I replied,
adding rather bitterly, "and were you returning thanks for the great
deed of another who has not escaped, of the woman who is called
White-Mouse?"</p>

<p>"How do you know that she has not escaped?"</p>

<p>"Because you yourself said that she must be dead--if she could die,
which of course she can."</p>

<p>"Yes, I said some such words, but now I think that she has been
speaking to me, although it may have been her spirit that was
speaking."</p>

<p>"Look here!" I said, exasperated. "Who and what is, or was,
White-Mouse? Your wife, or your daughter?"</p>

<p>"No, Lord, neither," he answered, with a little shiver.</p>

<p>"Then who? Tell me the truth or I have done with you."</p>

<p>"Lord, she is a messenger from my own country who came a while ago
to command me to return thither. It is because of her that these Arabs
hate me so much, for they think she is my familiar through whom I work
magic and bring evil upon them."</p>

<p>"And is she, Kaneke?"</p>

<p>"Baas," broke in Hans, "have you finished chatting, for the oil in
that lamp burns low and I have only two candles. Those niches will not
be nice in the dark, Baas."</p>

<p>"True," I said.</p>

<p>Then I bid Kaneke go first, suggesting that he knew the road, with
Hans following him and I coming last.</p>

<p>"My legs are stiff, Lord," he said, "but my arms are recovered. I
go."</p>

<p>He went; he went with the most amazing swiftness. In a few seconds
he was over the edge of the pit and descending rapidly, hand over hand,
as it seemed to me only occasionally touching the niches with his feet.
Not that I had much time to judge of this, for presently he was out of
sight and only by the jerking of the hide rope could we tell that he
was there at all.</p>

<p>"Will it break, Baas?" asked Hans doubtfully. "That brute Kaneke
weighs a lot."</p>

<p>"I don't know and I don't much care," I answered. "White-Mouse said
we should get through safely, and I am beginning to believe in
White-Mouse. So say your prayers and start."</p>

<p>He obeyed, and I followed.</p>

<p>I will omit the details of that horrible descent. Hans and I reached
the second platform and rested. Unfortunately in starting again I
looked down, and far, far below saw the lamp we had left burning at the
bottom, which gave me such an idea of precipitous death that I grew
dizzy. My strength left me and I almost fell, especially as just then
my foot slipped in one of the niches, leaving all my weight upon my
arms. I think I should have fallen, had not a voice, doubtless that of
my subconscious self at work, seemed to say to me:</p>

<p>"Remember, if you fall, you will kill Hans as well as yourself."</p>

<p>Then my brain cleared, I recovered control of my faculties, and
slipping down the rope a little way I found the next niche with my left
foot. Doubtless this return was even more fearsome than the ascent,
perhaps owing to physical weariness, or perhaps because the object of
the effort was achieved and there was now nothing left to hope for
except personal safety, the thought of which is always the father of
fear. I am not sure; all I know is that my spine crept and my brain
sickened much more than had been the case on the upward adventure.</p>

<p>At length, thank God, the worst of it was over and we reached the
sloping passage or gulley, or whatever it may have been, that in places
was open to the sky. By help of the lamps that now were almost spent,
we scrambled down this declivity with comparative ease, and so came out
of the mouth of the hole into the little clump of bush that concealed
it.</p>

<p>I sat down trembling like a jelly; the perspiration pouring off me,
for the heat of that place had been awful. Hans, who although so tough,
was in little better case than myself, found the water-bottle full of
cold tea which, to save weight, we had left hidden with everything else
we could spare, including our jackets, and passed it to me. I drank,
and the insipid stuff tasted like nectar; then gave it to Hans,
although I could gladly have swallowed the whole bottleful.</p>

<p>When he had taken a pull I stopped him, remembering Kaneke, who must
also be athirst. But where was Kaneke? We could not see him anywhere.
Hans opined that he had bolted into some hiding-place of his own, and
being too weary to argue or even to speculate upon the matter, I
accepted the explanation.</p>

<p>After this we finished the cold tea and topped it up with a nip of
brandy apiece, carefully measured in a little cup. The flask itself, to
which the cup was screwed, I did not dare to give to Hans, knowing that
temptation would overcome him and he would empty it to the last
drop.</p>

<p>Much refreshed and more thankful than I can say at having escaped
the perils of that darksome climb, I put the extinguished lamps into
poor White-Mouse's basket, thinking that they might come in useful
afterwards (or perhaps I wished to keep them as a souvenir, I don't
remember which). Then by common consent we started for the bottom of
the great gulley, proposing to trek up it back towards the camp. On
reaching the stream we stopped to drink water--for our thirst was still
unsatisfied--and to wash the sweat from our faces, also to cool our
feet bruised by those endless niches of the shaft.</p>

<p>Whilst I was thus engaged, hearing a sound, I peeped round a stone
and perceived the lost Kaneke kneeling upon the rock like a man at
prayer, and groaning. My first thought was that he must be hurt,
perhaps in the course of his remarkably rapid descent, and my second
that he was grieving over the death of White-Mouse, or mayhap because
of his separation from his wives whom he would see no more. Afterwards,
however, I reflected that the latter was improbable, seeing that he was
so ready to leave them. Indeed, I doubted whether he had really any
wives, or children either. Certainly I never saw any about the house in
which he dwelt like a hermit; there was nothing to show that these ever
existed. If they did, I was sure that Hans would have discovered
them.</p>

<p>However, this might be, not wishing to spy upon the man's private
sorrows, I coughed, whereon he rose and came round the rock.</p>

<p>"So you are here before us," I said.</p>

<p>"Yes, Lord," he answered, "and waiting for you. The descent of the
shaft is easy to those who know the road."</p>

<p>"Indeed. We found it difficult, also dangerous. However, like the
woman called White-Mouse"--here he winced and bowed his head--"that is
done with. Might I ask what your plans are now, Kaneke?"</p>

<p>"What they have always been, Lord. To guide you to my people, the
Dabanda, who live in the land of the Holy Lake. Only, Lord, I think
that we had better leave this place as quickly as we can, seeing it is
certain that, thinking we have escaped, the Arabs, my enemies, will
follow to your camp to attack you there."</p>

<p>"I agree," I answered. "Let us go at once."</p>

<p>So off we went on our long tramp up the darksome gorge, I, to tell
the truth, full of indignation and in the worst of tempers. At length I
could control myself no longer.</p>

<p>"Kaneke," I said, for he was walking at my side, Hans being a little
ahead engaged in picking our way through the gloom and watching for
possible attacks--"Kaneke, it seems that I and my servant are suffering
many things on your behalf. This night we have run great risks to save
you from death, as has another who is gone, and now you tell me that
because of you we are to be attacked by those who hate you. I think it
would be better if I repaid to you what I have received, together with
whatever money the ivory you gave me may bring, and you went your way,
leaving me to go mine."</p>

<p>"It cannot be," he answered vehemently. "Lord, although you do not
know it, we are bound together until all is accomplished as may be
fated. Yes, it is decreed in the stars, and destiny binds us together.
You think that I am ungrateful, but it is not so; my heart is full of
thankfulness towards you and I am your slave. Ask me no more, I pray
you, for if I told you all you would not believe me."</p>

<p>"Already you have told me a good deal that I do not believe," I
replied sharply, "so perhaps you had better keep your stories and
promises to yourself. At any rate, I cannot desert you at present, for
if I did, I suppose those Arab blackguards would cut your throat."</p>

<p>"Yes, Lord, and yours too. Together we shall best them, as you will
see, but separated they will kill us both, and your servants and
porters also."</p>

<p>After this we went on in silence and in the end, without molestation
except from a lion, emerged from the gorge and came to the knoll where
I had camped. We struck this beast in the open bushy country just
outside the mouth of the gorge, or rather it struck us and followed us
very persistently, which made me think that it must have been in great
want of food. Occasionally it growled, but for the most part slunk
along not more than thirty or forty paces to our right, taking cover in
the high grass or behind bushes. Also twice it went ahead to clumps of
thorn trees as though to waylay us. I think I could have shot it then,
but Hans begged me not to fire for fear of letting our whereabouts be
known to Arabs who might be searching for us. So instead we made
detours and avoided those clumps of trees.</p>

<p>This seemed to irritate the lion, which for the third time crept
forward and, as I saw clearly by the light of the sinking moon,
crouched down on our path about fifty paces in front of us in such a
spot that, owing to the nature of the land, it was difficult to
circumvent it without going a long way round.</p>

<p>Now I thought that I must accept the challenge of this savage or
starving animal, but Hans, who was most anxious that I should not
shoot, remarked sarcastically that since the "owl-man", as he called
Kaneke, was such a wonderful wizard, perhaps he would exert his powers
and send it away.</p>

<p>Kaneke, who had been marching moodily along as fast as his legs,
still stiff from the bonds, would allow, paying little or no attention
to the matter of the lion, heard him and seemed to wake up.</p>

<p>"Yes," he said, "if you are afraid of the beast I can do that. Bide
here, I pray you, Lord, till I call you."</p>

<p>Then, quite unarmed, without so much as a stick in his hand indeed,
he walked forward quietly to where the lion, a large one with a
somewhat scrubby mane, lay upon a rock between the bank of the stream
and a little cliff. I watched him amazed, holding my rifle ready and
feeling sure that unless I could shoot it first, which was improbable
because he was in my line of fire, there would soon be an end of
Kaneke. This, however, did not happen, for the man trudged on and
presently was so close to the lion that his body hid it from my
sight.</p>

<p>After this I heard a growl which degenerated into a yelp like to
that of a beast in pain. The next thing I saw was Kaneke standing on
the rock where the lion had been, outlined very clearly against the
sky, and beckoning to us to come forward. So we went, not without
doubt, and found Kaneke seated on the rock with his face towards us as
though to rest his legs, and as it seemed once more lost in
reverie.</p>

<p>"The lion has gone," he said shortly, "or rather the lions, for
there were two of them, and will return no more to trouble you. Let us
walk on, I will go first."</p>

<p>"He is a very good wizard, Baas," said Hans reflectively in Dutch,
as we followed. "Or perhaps," he added, "that lion is one of his
familiars which he calls and sends away as he likes."</p>

<p>"Bosh!" I grunted. "The brute bolted, that is all."</p>

<p>"Yes, Baas. Still, I think that if you or I had gone forward without
a gun it would have bolted us, for as you know, when a lion follows a
man like that, its belly has been empty for days. This Kaneke's other
name must be Daniel, Baas, who used to like to sleep with lions."</p>

<p>I did not argue with Hans; indeed, I was too tired to talk, but
stumped along till presently we came to the site of the camp which we
had left early on that eventful night--days ago it seemed to be. Here I
found that my orders had been obeyed and that Tom and Jerry had gone
forward with the porters, as I judged from various indications, such as
the state of the cooking-fire, not much more than an hour before.
Therefore there was nothing to do but follow their trail, which was
broad and easy, even in the low moonlight.</p>

<p>On we marched accordingly, always uphill, which made our weary
progress slow. At length came the dawn, a hot, still dawn, and after it
the sunrise. By its bright light we saw two things: our porters camping
at the appointed spot about half a mile away among some rocks just
above a pool of water that remained in a dry river-bed; and behind us,
perhaps two miles off, tracking our spoor up the slope that we had
travelled, a party of white-robed Arabs, twenty of them or more.</p>

<p>"Now we are in for it," I said. "Come on, Hans, there is no time to
spare."</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<center>
<h1><a name="c06">CHAPTER VI</a></h1>

<br>


<h1>KANEKE'S FRIENDS</h1>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>I know of no greater pick-me-up for a tired man than the sight of a
body of enemies running on his spoor with the clear and definite object
of putting an end to his mortal existence. On this occasion, for
instance, suddenly I felt quite fresh again and covered that half-mile
which lay between us and the camp in almost record time. So did the
other two, for the three of us arrived there nearly neck and neck.</p>

<p>As we scrambled into the place I observed with joy that Tom and
Jerry had taken in the situation, for already the porters were engaged
in piling stones into a wall, or in hacking down thorn trees and
dragging their prickly boughs together so as to form a <i>boma.</i>
More, those excellent men had breakfast cooking for us upon a fire, and
coffee ready.</p>

<p>Having given such orders as were necessary, though in truth there
was little to be done, I fell upon that breakfast and devoured it, for
we were starving. Hot coffee and food are great stimulants, and in ten
minutes I felt a new man. Then the four of us, namely, Tom, Jerry,
Hans, and I, took counsel together, for at the moment I could not see
Kaneke who, having bolted some meat, had gone, as I presumed, to help
with the <i>boma</i>-building. It was needful, for the position seemed
fairly desperate.</p>

<p>By now the Arabs, who advanced slowly, were about half a mile away,
and with the aid of my glasses I saw that there were more of them than
I had thought, forty or fifty indeed, of whom quite half carried guns
of one sort or another. I surveyed the position and found that it was
good for defence. The camp was on the slope of a little koppie,
round-topped and thickly strewn with boulders. To our right at the foot
of the koppie was the long, broad pool I have mentioned.</p>

<p>Behind lay the river-bed half encircling the koppie, or rather a
swamp through which the river ran when it was full, which swamp was so
deep with sticky mud that advance over it would be difficult, if not
impossible. To our left, however, was a dry <i>vlei</i> overgrown with
tall grass and thorn trees, through which wended the native path that
we had been following. In front the veld over which we had advanced,
was open, but gave no cover, for here the grass had been burned leaving
the soil bare. Therefore the Arabs could only advance upon us from this
direction, or possibly through the thick grass and trees to our
left.</p>

<p>But here came the rub. With a dozen decent shots I should have
feared nothing. We, however, had but four upon whom we could rely, and
Kaneke, who was an unknown quantity. If these Arabs meant business our
case was hopeless, for of course no reliance could be placed on the
porters, or at any rate upon most of them, who moreover had no guns. In
short there was nothing to be done except trust in Providence and fight
our hardest.</p>

<p>We got out the guns, Winchester repeaters all of them, of which I
had six with me, and opened a couple of boxes of ammunition. The heavy
game rifles we loaded and kept in reserve, also a couple of shot-guns
charged with loopers, as we called slugs, for these are very effective
in meeting a rush. Then I told Hans to find Kaneke, that I might
explain matters and give him a rifle. He went and returned presently
saying that Kaneke was not working at the walls or cutting down
thorns.</p>

<p>"Baas," he added, "I think that skunk has run away or turned into a
snake and slid into the reeds."</p>

<p>"Nonsense," I answered. "Where could he run to? I will look for him
myself; those Arabs won't be here yet awhile."</p>

<p>So off I went and climbed to the top of the koppie to get a better
view. Presently I thought I heard a sound beneath me, and looking over
the edge of the boulder, saw Kaneke standing in a little bay of rock,
waving his arms in a most peculiar fashion and talking in a low voice
as though he were carrying on a conversation with some unseen
person.</p>

<p>"Hi!" I said, exasperated. "Perhaps you are not aware that those
friends of yours will be here presently and that you had better come to
help to keep them off. Might I ask what you are doing?"</p>

<p>"That will be seen later, Lord," he answered quietly. Then, with a
final wave of the hand and a nod of the head, such as a man gives in
assent, he turned and climbed up to where I was.</p>

<p>Not one word did he say until we reached the others, nor did I
question him. Indeed, I thought it useless as I had made up my mind
that the fellow was mad. Still; as he was an able-bodied man who said
that he could shoot, I gave him one of the rifles and a supply of
cartridges, and hoped for the best.</p>

<p>By now the Arabs had come within four hundred yards, whereon a new
trouble developed, for the porters grew frightened and threatened to
bolt. I sent Hans to tell them that I would shoot the first man who
stirred, and when, notwithstanding this, one of them did begin to run,
I fired a shot which purposely missed him by a few inches and flattened
on a rock in front of his face. This frightened him so much that he
fell down and lay still, which caused me to fear that I had made a
mistake and hit him through the head. The effect upon the others was
marked, for they squatted on the ground and began to pray to whatever
gods or idols they worshipped, or to talk about their mothers, nor did
any of them attempt to stir again.</p>

<p>At the sound of this shot the Arabs halted, thinking that it had
been fired at them, and began to consult together. After they had
talked for some time one man came forward waving a flag of truce made
of a white turban cloth tied to a spear. In reply I shook a pocket
handkerchief which was far from white, whereon he walked forward to
within twenty yards of the <i>boma.</i> Here I shouted to him to stop,
suspecting that he wished to spy upon us, and went out to meet him with
Hans, who would not allow me to go alone.</p>

<p>"What do you and your people want?" I said, in a loud voice to the
man, whom I recognized as one of the judges who had tried Kaneke.</p>

<p>"White Master," he answered, "we want the wizard Kaneke, whom you
have stolen away from us, and whom we have doomed to die. Give him to
us, dead or alive, and we will let you and your people go in peace, for
against you we have no other quarrel. If you do not, we will kill you,
every one."</p>

<p>"That remains to be seen," I answered boldly. "As for the rest, hand
over to me the woman called White-Mouse and I will talk with you."</p>

<p>"I cannot," he answered.</p>

<p>"Why not? Have you killed her?"</p>

<p>"By Allah, no!" he exclaimed earnestly. "We have not killed that
witch, though it is true we wished to do so. Somehow in the confusion
she slipped from our hands, and we cannot find her. We think that she
has turned into an owl and flown to Satan, her master."</p>

<p>"Do you? Well, I think that you lie. Now tell me why you wish to
kill Kaneke after he has run away from you, leaving you to walk your
own road?"</p>

<p>"Because," answered the Arab in a fury, "he has left his curse upon
us, which can only be loosed with his blood. Did you not hear him swear
to bring a plague upon us, and has not the spotted sickness broken out
in the town so that already many are ill and doubtless will die? Also
has he not murdered our brother and bewitched us in many other ways,
and will he not utterly destroy us by bringing our enemies upon us, as
two moons ago he swore that he would do unless we let him go?"</p>

<p>"So you were keeping him a prisoner?"</p>

<p>"Of course, White Man. He has been a prisoner ever since he came
among us, though at times it is true that he has been seen outside the
town, and now we know how he came there."</p>

<p>"Why did you keep him a prisoner?"</p>

<p>"That in protecting himself he might protect us also by his magic,
for we knew that if he should escape he would bring destruction upon
us. And now, will you give him up to us, or will you not?"</p>

<p>There was a certain insolence about the way in which the man asked
this question that put my back up at once, and I answered on the
impulse of the moment:</p>

<p>"I will not. First, I will see all of you in hell. What business
have you and your fellow half-breed Arabs to threaten to attack me, a
subject of the Queen of England, because I give shelter to a fugitive
whom you wish to murder? And what have you done with the woman called
White-Mouse who, you say, has changed into an owl? Produce her, lest I
hold you all to account for her life. Oh, you think that I am weak
because I have but few men with me here. Yet I tell you that before the
sun has set, I, Macumazahn, will teach you a lesson, if, indeed, any of
you live to learn it."</p>

<p>The man stared at me, frightened by my bold talk. Then, without a
word, he turned and ran back towards his people, zigzagging as he went,
doubtless because he feared that I would shoot him. I too, turned, and
strolled unconcernedly up the slope to the <i>boma,</i> just to show
them that I was not afraid.</p>

<p>"Baas," said Hans, as we went, "as usual you are wrong. Why do you
not surrender that big-eyed wizard who is putting us to so much
trouble?"</p>

<p>"Because, Hans, I should be ashamed of myself if I did, and what is
more, you would be ashamed of me."</p>

<p>"Yes, Baas, that is quite true. I should never think the same of you
again. But, Baas, when a man's throat's going to be cut, he doesn't
remember what he would think afterwards if it wasn't cut. Well, we are
all going to be killed, for what we can do against those men I can't
see, and when we meet your reverend father presently in the Place of
Fires, I shall tell him that I did my best to keep you from coming
there so soon. And now Baas, I will bet you that monkey-skin tobacco
pouch of mine of which you are so jealous, against a bottle of gin, to
be paid when we get back to the coast, that before the day is over I
put a bullet through that Arab villain who talked to you so
insolently."</p>

<p>We reached the <i>boma,</i> where I told Tom and Jerry, also Kaneke,
the gist of what had passed. The dashing Tom seemed not displeased at
the prospect of a fight, while Jerry the phlegmatic, shook his head and
shrugged his shoulders, after which they both retired behind a rock for
a few moments, as Hans informed me, to say their prayers and confess
their sins to each other. Kaneke listened and made but one remark.</p>

<p>"You are behaving well to me, Lord Macumazahn, and now I will behave
well to you."</p>

<p>"Thank you," I answered. "I shall remind you of that if we meet on
the other side of the sun, or in that star you worship. Now please go
to your post, shoot as straight as you can, and don't waste
cartridges."</p>

<p>Then, when the hunters had returned from their religious exercises,
we took our places, each in a little shelter of rocks, so arranged that
we could fire over the fence of the <i>boma.</i> I was in the middle,
with Hans and Kaneke on either side of me, while Tom and Jerry were at
the ends of the line. There we crouched, expecting a frontal attack,
but this did not develop. After a long talk the Arabs fired a few shots
from a distance of about four hundred yards, which either fell short or
went I know not where. Then suddenly they began to run over the open
land where, as I have said, the veld was burned, towards the tall grass
with thorn trees growing in it that lay upon our left, evidently with
the design of outflanking us.</p>

<p>At the head of their scattered band was a tall man in whom, by the
aid of my glasses, I recognized the venomous and evil-tempered Gaika,
who had acted as chief-justice at Kaneke's trial, a person who had
threatened me and of whom I had conceived an intense dislike. Hans,
whose sight was as keen as a vulture's, recognized him also, for he
said:</p>

<p>"There goes that hyena Gaika."</p>

<p>"Give me my express," I said, laying down the Winchester, and he
handed it to me cocked.</p>

<p>"Let no man fire!" I cried as I took it, and lifted the flap-sight
that was marked five hundred yards. Then I stood up, set my left elbow
upon a stone, and waited my chance.</p>

<p>It came a few moments later, when Gaika must cross a little ridge of
ground where he was outlined against the sky. The shot was a long one
for an express, but I knew my rifle and determined to risk it. I got on
to him, aiming at his middle, and swung the barrel the merest fraction
in front to allow time for the bullet to travel. Then, drawing a long
breath to steady myself, I pressed the trigger, of which the pull was
very light.</p>

<p>The rifle rang out and I waited anxiously, for, although the best of
shots need not have been ashamed to do so, I feared to miss, knowing
that if this happened it would be taken as an omen. Well, I did not
miss, for two seconds later I saw Gaika plunge to the ground, roll over
and over and lie still.</p>

<p>"Oh!" said my people simultaneously, looking at me with admiration
and pride. But I was not proud, except a little perhaps at my
marksmanship, for I was sorry to have to shoot this disagreeable and to
us most dangerous man, so much so that I did not fire the other barrel
of the express.</p>

<p>For a moment his nearest companions stopped and stared at Gaika;
then they fled on towards the high grass and reeds, leaving him on the
ground, which showed me that he must be dead. I hoped that they were
merely taking cover and that the sudden end of Gaika would have caused
them to change their minds about attacking us, which was why I shot
him. This, however, was not the case, for a while later fire was opened
on us from a score of places in these reeds. Here and there in the
centre of clumps of them and behind the trunks of thorns the Arabs had
hidden themselves, singly or in pairs, and the trouble was that we
could not see one of them. This made it quite useless to attempt to
return their fire because our bullets would only have been wasted, and
I had no ammunition to throw away in such a fashion. So there we must
lie, doing nothing.</p>

<p>It was true that for the present we were not in any great danger,
because we could take shelter behind stones upon which the missiles of
the Arabs flattened themselves, if they hit at all, for the shooting
being erratic, most of them sang over us harmlessly. The sound of these
bullets, which sometimes I think were only pebbles coated with lead, or
fragments of iron, terrified our bearers, however, especially after one
of them had been slightly wounded by a lead splinter, or a fragment of
rock. The wretched men began to jabber and now and again to cry out
with fear, nor could all my orders and threats keep them quiet.</p>

<p>At length, after this bombardment had continued for nearly two
hours, there came a climax. Suddenly, as though at a word of command,
the bearers rose and rushed down the slope like a bunch of startled
buck. They ran to the bank of the pool which I have mentioned,
following it eastwards towards Kaneke's town, till they came to the bed
of the river of which the pool formed a part in the wet season, where
they vanished.</p>

<p>Of course we could have shot some of them as they went, as Hans, who
was feeling spiteful, wanted to do, but this I would not allow, for
what was the use of trying to stop a pack of cowards who, as likely as
not, would attack us from behind if a rush came, hoped thus to
propitiate the Arabs? What happened to those men I do not know, for
they vanished completely, nor did I ever hear of them again. Perhaps
some of them escaped back to the coast, but being without arms or food,
this I think more than doubtful. The poor wretches must have wandered
till they starved or were killed by wild beasts, unless indeed they
were captured and enslaved.</p>

<p>Now our position was very serious. Here we were, five men and one
donkey; for I think I have said that I possessed this beast, a
particularly intelligent creature called Donna after a half-breed
Portuguese woman the rest of whose name I forget, who had sold it to me
with two others that died on the road. Beneath us, completely hidden,
were forty or fifty determined enemies who probably were waiting for
nightfall to creep up the koppie and cut our throats. What could we
do?</p>

<p>Hans, whose imagination was fertile, suggested various expedients.
His first was that we should try to fire the reeds and long grass in
which the Arabs had taken cover, which was quite impracticable, because
first we had to get there without being shot; also they were still too
green to burn and the wind was blowing the wrong way. His next idea was
that we should follow the example of the porters and bolt. This, I
pointed out, was foolish, for we should only be run down and killed.
Even if we waited till dark, almost certainly the end would be
disaster; moreover we should be obliged to leave most of our gear and
ammunition behind. Then he made a third proposal in a mixture of Dutch
and English, which was but an old one in a new form, namely, that we
should try to buy off the Arabs by surrendering Kaneke.</p>

<p>"I have already told you that I will do nothing of the sort. I
promised White-Mouse to try to save this man, and there's an end."</p>

<p>"Yes, Baas, I know you did. Oh, what bad luck it is that White-Mouse
was so pretty. If only her face had been like a squashed pumpkin, or if
she had been dirty, with creatures in her hair, we shouldn't be looking
at our last sun, Baas. Well, no doubt soon we shall be talking over the
business with her in the Place of Fires, where I am sure she has gone,
whatever that liar of a messenger may have said. Now I have finished
who can think of nothing more, except to pray to your reverend father,
who doubtless can help us if he chooses, which perhaps he doesn't,
because he is so anxious to see me again."</p>

<p>Having delivered himself thus, Hans squatted a little more closely
beneath his stone, over which a bullet had just passed with a most
vicious whiz, and lit a pipe.</p>

<p>Next I tried the two hunters, only to find that they were quite
barren of ideas, for they shook their heads and went on murmuring
prayers. There remained Kaneke, at whom I glanced in despair. There he
sat silent, with a face like a brickbat so impassive was it, giving me
the idea of a man who is listening intently for something. For what? I
wondered.</p>

<p>"Kaneke," I said, "by you, or on your behalf by another whom I think
is dead, we have been led into a deep hole. Here we are who can be
counted on the fingers of one hand, under fire from those who hate you,
but against whom we have no quarrel, except on your account. The
porters have fled away and our enemies, whom we cannot shoot because
they are invisible in the reeds and grass of that <i>pan,</i> only
await darkness to attack and make an end of us. Now if you have any
word of comfort, speak, for it is needed, remembering that if we die,
you die also."</p>

<p>"Comfort!" he answered in his dreamy fashion. "Oh yes, it is at
hand. I am waiting for it now, my Lord Macumazahn," and he went on
listening like one who has been interrupted in a serious matter by some
babbler of trivialities.</p>

<p>This was too much for me; my patience gave way, and I addressed
Kaneke in language which I will not record, saying amongst other
forcible things that I was sorry I had not followed Hans' advice and
abandoned him or surrendered him to the Arabs.</p>

<p>"You could not do that, my Lord Macumazahn," he answered mildly,
"seeing that you had promised White-Mouse to save me. No one could
break his word to White-Mouse, could he?"</p>

<p>"White-Mouse!" I ejaculated. "Where is she? Poor woman, she is dead,
and for you, as the rest of us soon will be. And now you talk to me
about my promises to her. How do you know what I promised her, you
anathema'd bag of mysteries?"</p>

<p>"I do know, Lord," he replied, still more vaguely and gently. Then
suddenly he added, "Hark! I hear the comfort coming," and lifted his
hand in an impressive manner, only to drop it again in haste, because a
passing bullet had scraped the skin off his finger.</p>

<p>Something caught my ear and I listened. From far away came a sound
which reminded me of that made by a pack of wild dogs hunting a buck at
night, a kind of surging, barbarous music.</p>

<p>"What is it?" I asked.</p>

<p>Kaneke, who was sucking the scraped finger, removed it from his
mouth and replied that it was "the comfort", and that if I would look
perhaps I should see.</p>

<p>So I did look through a crack between two stones towards the
direction from which the sound seemed to come, namely eastward beyond
the dry swamp where the veld was formed of great waves of land spotted
with a sparse growth of thorn trees, swelling undulations like to those
of the deep ocean, only on a larger scale. Presently, coming over the
crest of one of these waves, now seen and now lost among the thorns,
appeared a vast number of men, savage-looking fellows who wore feathers
in their hair and very little else, and carried broad, long-handled
spears.</p>

<p>"Who the deuce are these?" I asked, but Kaneke made no answer.</p>

<p>There he sat behind his stone, pointing towards the reeds in which
the Arabs were hidden with his bleeding finger and muttering to
himself.</p>

<p>Hans who, wild with curiosity, had thrust his sticky face against
mine in order to share the view through the chink, whispered into my
ear:</p>

<p>"Don't disturb him, Baas. These are his friends and he is telling
them where those Arabs are."</p>

<p>"How can he tell people half a mile away anything, you idiot?" I
asked.</p>

<p>"Oh, quite easily, Baas. You see, he is a magician, and magicians
talk with their minds. It is their way of sending telegrams, as you do
in Natal, Baas. Well, things look better now. As your reverend father
used to say, if only you wait long enough the devil always helps you at
last."</p>

<p>"Rot!" I ejaculated, though I agreed that things did look better,
that is, unless these black scoundrels intended to attack us and not
the Arabs. Then I set myself to watch events with the greatest
interest.</p>

<p>The horde of savages, advancing at a great pace--there must have
been two or three hundred of them--made for the dry <i>pan</i> like
bees for their hive. Whether Kaneke instructed them or not, evidently
their intelligence department was excellent, for they knew exactly what
they had to do. Reaching the edge of it, they halted for a while and
ceased their weird song, I suppose to get their breath and to form up.
Then at some signal the song began again and they plunged into those
reeds like dogs after an otter.</p>

<p>Up to this moment the Arabs hidden there did not seem to be aware of
their approach, I suppose because their attention was too firmly fixed
upon us, for they kept on firing at the koppie in a desultory fashion.
Now of a sudden this firing ceased, and from the thicket below arose
yells of fear, surprise, and anger. Next at its further end, that which
lay towards Kaneke's town, appeared the Arabs running for all they were
worth, and presently, after them, their savage attackers.</p>

<p>Heavens, what a race was that! Never have I seen men go faster than
did those Arabs across the plain with the wild pursuers at their heels.
Some were caught and killed, but when at last they vanished out of
sight, most of them were still well ahead. Hans wanted to shoot at
them, but I would not allow it, for what was the use of trying to kill
the poor wretches while others were fighting our battle? So it came
about that the only shot we fired that day, I mean in earnest, was that
which I had aimed at Gaika, which was strange when I had prepared for a
desperate battle against overwhelming odds.</p>

<p>All having vanished behind the irregularities of the ground, except
a few who had been caught and speared, in the silence which followed
the war-song and the shoutings, I turned to Kaneke and asked for
explanations. He replied quite pleasantly and briefly, that these black
men were some of his "friends" whom the Arabs had always feared he
would bring upon them, which was why they kept him prisoner and wished
to kill him.</p>

<p>"I had no intention of doing anything of the sort, Lord," he added,
"until it became necessary in order to save our lives. Then, of course
I asked them for help, whereon they came at once and did what was
wanted, as you have seen."</p>

<p>"And pray how did you ask them, Kaneke?"</p>

<p>"Oh, Lord, by messengers as one always asks people at a distance,
though they were so long coming I feared lest the messengers might not
have reached them."</p>

<p>"He lies, Baas," said Hans, in Dutch. "It is no good trying to pump
the truth out of his heart, for you will only tire yourself bringing up
more lies."</p>

<p>As I agreed, I dropped the subject and inquired of Kaneke whether
his friends were coming back again. He said he thought so and before
very long, as he had told them not to attack the town in which dwelt
many innocent women and children.</p>

<p>"But, Lord," he went on, with unusual emphasis, "when they do return
I think it will be well that you should not go to speak to them. To
tell the truth, they are savage people, and being very naked, might
take a fancy to your clothes, also to your guns and ammunition. I will
just go down to give them a word of thanks and bring back some porters
to take the place of those who have run away, whom, by the way, I hope
they have not met. Foreseeing something of the sort, I asked them to
bring a number of suitable men."</p>

<p>"Did you?" I gasped. "You are indeed a provident person. And now may
I ask you whether you intend to return to your town, or what you mean
to do?"</p>

<p>"Certainly I do not intend to return, Lord, in order to care for
people who have been so ungrateful. Also, that spotted sickness is most
unpleasant to see. No, Lord, I intend to accompany you to the country
of the Lake Mone."</p>

<p>"The Lake Mone!" I said. "I have had enough of that lake, or rather
of the journey to it, and I have made up my mind not to go there."</p>

<p>He looked at me, and under the assumed mildness of that look I read
intense determination as he answered:</p>

<p>"I think you will go to the Lake Mone, Lord Macumazahn."</p>

<p>"And I think I will not, Kaneke."</p>

<p>"Indeed. In that case, Lord, I must talk to my friends when they
return, and make certain arrangements with them."</p>

<p>We stared at each other for what seemed quite a long time, though I
dare say it was only a few seconds. I don't know what Kaneke read of my
mind, but what I read of his was a full intention that I should
accompany him to the Lake Mone, or be left to the tender mercies of his
"friends", at present engaged in Arab-hunting who, it seemed, had so
great a passion for European guns and garments.</p>

<p>Now there are times when it is well to give way, and the knowledge
of those times, to my mind, often marks the difference between a wise
man and a fool. As we all know, wisdom and folly are contiguous states,
and the line dividing them is very thin and crooked, which makes it
difficult not to blunder across its borders, I mean from the land of
wisdom into that of folly, for the other step is rarely taken, save by
one inspired by the best of angels.</p>

<p>In this instance, although I do not pretend to any exceptional
sagacity, I felt strongly that it would be well to stick on my own side
of the line and not defy the Fates as represented by that queer person
Kaneke, and his black "friends" whom he seemed to have summoned from
nowhere in particular. After all, I was in a tight place. To travel
back without porters, even if I escaped the "friends" and the Arabs who
now had a quarrel against me, was almost impossible, and the same might
be said of a journey in any other direction. It seemed, therefore, that
it would be best to continue to suffer those ills I knew of, namely the
fellowship of Kaneke on an expedition into the unknown.</p>

<p>"Very well," I remarked casually, after a swift weighing of these
matters and a still swifter remembrance of the prophecy of White-Mouse
that I should come safely through the business. (Why this should have
struck me at that moment I could not say.)--"Very well, it does not
much matter to me whether I turn east or west. So let us go to Lake
Mone, if there be such a place, though I wonder what will be the end of
that journey."</p>

<p>"So do I," replied Kaneke dryly.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<h1><a name="c07">CHAPTER VII</a></h1>

<br>


<h1>THE JOURNEY</h1>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>Now, for sundry reasons, I am going to follow the example of a lady
of my acquaintance who makes it a rule to read two three-volume novels
a week, and skip, by which I mean that I will compress the tale of our
journey to the land of the mysterious Lake Mone into the smallest
possible compass. If set out in full the details of such a trek as this
through country that at the time was practically unknown to white
men--it took between two and three months--would suffice to fill a
volume. It might be an interesting volume in its way, to a few who care
for descriptions of African races and scenery, but to the many I fear
that its chapters would present a certain sameness. So I shall leave
them untold and practise the art of pr&eacute;cis-writing until I come
to the heart of the story.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>After the conversation of which I have spoken, we cooked and ate
food, which all of us needed badly. Then, being very tired and worn
with many emotions, Hans and I went to sleep in the shade of some
rocks, leaving Tom and Jerry to keep watch. About three o'clock in the
afternoon one of them woke us up, or rather woke me up, for Hans, who
could do with very little sleep, was already astir and engaged in
overhauling the rifles. They told me that the black men were returning.
I asked where Kaneke was, and learned that he had gone to meet them.
Then I took my glasses and from a point of vantage kept watch upon what
happened.</p>

<p>The savages, impressive-looking fellows in their plume-crowned
nakedness, came streaming across the veld, some of them carrying in
their hands objects which I believe to have been the heads of Arabs,
though of this I cannot be sure because they were so far away. They
were no longer singing or in haste but walked quietly, with the
contented air of men filled with a sense of duty done. Appeared Kaneke
marching towards them, whereon they halted and saluted by raising their
spears, thus showing me that in their opinion he was a man of great
position and dignity. They formed a ring round Kaneke, from the centre
of which he seemed to address them. When this ring opened out again,
which it did after a while, I observed that a fire had been lit, how,
or fed with what fuel, I do not know, and that on it the savages were
laying the objects which I took to be the heads of Arabs.</p>

<p>"Kaneke is their great devil, and they are sacrificing to him,
Baas," whispered Hans.</p>

<p>"At any rate, on this occasion he has been a useful devil," I
answered, "or, rather, his worshippers have been useful."</p>

<p>A while later, when the rite, or sacrifice, or whatever it may have
been, was completed, the savages started forward again, leaving the
fire still burning on the veld, and marched almost to the foot of the
koppie, which caused me some alarm, as I thought they might be coming
to the camp. This was not so, however, for when they were within a few
hundred yards, of a sudden they broke into a chant, not the same which
they had used when advancing, but one which had in it a kind of note of
farewell, and departing at a run past the outer edge of the dry
<i>vlei</i> from which they had driven the Arabs, soon were lost to
sight. Yes, their song grew fainter and fainter, till at length it was
swallowed up in silence and the singers vanished into the vast depths
of distance whence they came.</p>

<p>Where did they come from and who were they? I know not, for on this
matter Kaneke preserved a silence so impenetrable that at length the
mystery of their appearance and disappearance began, to my mind, to
take the character of an episode in a dream. Or, rather, it would have
done so had it not been for the circumstance that they did not all go.
On the contrary, about twenty were left, who stood before Kaneke with
folded arms and bent heads, their spears thrust into the ground in
front of them, blade upwards, by means of the iron spikes that were
fixed to the handles. Also at the feet of each man was a bundle wrapped
round with a mat.</p>

<p>"Hullo!" I said. "What do those men want? Do they mean
mischief?"</p>

<p>"Oh no, Baas," answered Hans. "The Baas will remember that Kaneke
promised us some more porters, and these are the men. Doubtless he is a
great wizard, and for aught I know, may have made them and all the rest
out of mud; like Adam and Eve, Baas. Still, I am beginning to think
better of Kaneke, who is not just a humbug, as I thought, but one who
can do things."</p>

<p>Meanwhile at some sign the men picked up the bundles and slung them
over their shoulders, drew their spears from the ground and followed
Kaneke towards the camp, where we waited for them with our rifles ready
in case of accidents.</p>

<p>"Baas," said Hans, as they approached, "I do not think that these
men are the brothers of those who attacked the Arabs just now; I think
that they are different."</p>

<p>I studied them and came to the same conclusion. To begin with, so
far as I could judge who had only seen our wild rescuers from a
distance, these were lighter in colour, brown rather than black,
indeed, also they were taller and their hair was much less woolly, only
curling up at the ends which hung down upon their shoulders. For the
rest, they were magnificently built, with large brown eyes not unlike
those of Kaneke, and well-cut features with nothing negroid about them.
Nor, in truth, were they of Arab type who seemed rather to belong to
some race that was new to me, and yet of very ancient and unmixed
blood.</p>

<p>Could they, I wondered, belong to the same people as Kaneke himself?
No; although so like him, it seemed impossible, for how would they have
got here?</p>

<p>Very quietly and solemnly the men approached to where I was sitting
on a stone, walking in as good a double line as the nature of the
ground would allow, as though they had been accustomed to discipline,
and laying their right hands upon their hearts, bowed to me in a
courtly fashion that was almost European; so courtly, indeed, that I
felt bound to stand up, take off my hat, and return the bow. To Hans
they did not bow, but only regarded him with a mild curiosity, or to
the hunters either, for these they seemed to recognize were
servants.</p>

<p>The sight of the donkey, Donna, however, appeared to astonish them,
and when at that moment she broke into her loudest bray, intimating
that she wished to be fed, they looked downright frightened, thinking,
I suppose, that she was some strange wild beast.</p>

<p>Kaneke spoke a word or two to them in a tongue I did not know,
whereon they smiled as though in apology. Then he said:</p>

<p>"Lord Macumazahn, you, and still more your servant Hans, have
mistrusted me, thinking either that I was mad or leading you into some
trap. Nor do I wonder at this, seeing that much has happened since
yesterday which you must find it hard to understand. Still, Lord, as
you will admit, all has gone well. Those whom I summoned to aid us have
done their work and departed, to be seen of you no more; the Arabs over
whom I ruled and who went near to murdering me, and would have murdered
you because you refused to deliver me to them, as Hans wished that you
should do, have learned their lesson and will not trouble you again.
These men"--and he pointed to his companions--"you will find brave and
trustworthy, nor will they be a burden to you in any way; nay, rather
they will bear your burdens. Only, I pray you, do not question them as
to who they are or whence they come, for they are under a vow of
silence. Have I your promise?"</p>

<p>"Oh, certainly," I answered, adding with inward doubt, "and that of
Hans and the hunters also. And now as I understand nothing of all this
business, which I do not consider has gone as well as you say, seeing
that White-Mouse, the woman who saved your life, although, as she told
me, she was not your wife--"</p>

<p>"That is true, as I have said already," interrupted Kaneke, bowing
his head in a way that struck me as almost reverential.</p>

<p>"--Seeing that White-Mouse," I repeated, "doubtless is dead at the
hands of those Arabs of yours who hated you, which blackens everything,
perhaps you will be so good as to tell me, Kaneke, what is to happen
next."</p>

<p>"Our journey, Lord," he replied, with a stare of surprise. "What
else? Moreover, Lord, be sure that about this journey you need not
trouble any more. Henceforward, until we reach the land of my people I
will take command and arrange for everything. All that you need do is
to follow where I lead and amuse yourself, resting or stopping to shoot
when you will, and giving me your orders as to every matter of the
sort, which shall be obeyed. This you can do without fear seeing that,
as White-Mouse told you, all shall go well with you."</p>

<p>Now once more I was tempted to question him as to the source of his
information about what passed between me and White-Mouse, but
refrained, remarking only that he was very good at guessing.</p>

<p>"Yes, Lord," he replied. "I have always had a gift that way, as you
may have noticed when I guessed that those savages would come to help
us, and bring with them men to take the place of the porters who have
fled. Well, I notice that you do not contradict my guess and again I
assure you that White-Mouse spoke true words."</p>

<p>Now for a minute I was indignant at Kaneke's impudence. It seemed
outrageous that he, or any native African, should presume to put me,
Allan Quatermain, under his orders, to go where <i>he</i> liked and to
do what <i>he</i> chose. Indeed, I was about to refuse such a position
with the greatest emphasis when suddenly it occurred to me that there
was another side to the question.</p>

<p>Although I had never travelled there, I had heard from friends how
people touring in the East place themselves in charge of a dragoman, a
splendid but obsequious individual who dry-nurses them day and night,
arranges, commands, feeds, masters difficulties, wrangles with
extortioners or obstructionists, and finally gently leads his employers
whither they would go and back again. It is true I had heard, too, that
these skilled and professional persons are rather apt to melt away in
times of real danger or trouble, leaving their masters to do the
fighting, also that their bills are invariably large. For every system
has its drawbacks and these are chances which must be faced.</p>

<p>Still, this idea of being dragomanned, personally conducted like a
Cook's tourist, through untrodden parts of Africa, had charms. It would
be such a thorough change--at any rate to me. Then and there I
determined to accept the offer, reflecting that if the worst came to
the worst, I could always take command again. It was obvious that I
must accompany Kaneke or run the risk of strange things happening to me
at his hands and those of his followers whom he had collected out of
nowhere. Therefore the responsibilities of the expedition might as well
be his as mine.</p>

<p>So I answered mildly:</p>

<p>"Agreed, Kaneke. You shall lead and I will follow. I place myself
and my servants in your hands, trusting to you to guide us safely and
to protect us against every danger. Though," I added in a sterner
voice, "I warn you that at the first sign of treachery I will shoot you
dead. And now tell me, when are we to start?"</p>

<p>"At moonrise, I think, Lord, for then it will be cooler. Meanwhile
you and your servants can sleep who need rest after so many labours.
Fear nothing; I and my men will watch."</p>

<p>"Baas," said Hans as we went away to act upon this advice, "I never
thought you and I, who are getting old, would live to find a new mammy,
and such a one with eye and beak of an owl who, like an owl, loves to
stare at the stars and to fly at night. However, if the Baas does not
mind, I don't."</p>

<p>I made no answer, though I thought to myself that Kaneke's great
sleepy eyes were really not unlike those of an owl, that mysterious
bird which in the native mind is always connected with omens and magic.
Yes, in calling him an owl Hans showed his usual aptitude, especially
as he believed that he was the destroyer of that strange and beautiful
woman, White-Mouse.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>Well, we rested, and ate on waking, and at moonrise departed upon
our journey, heading nor'-west. Everything was prepared, even the loads
were apportioned among the new porters. Indeed, there was nothing left
for us to do except roll up the little tent and tie it, together with
my personal belongings, on to the back of Donna, whom Hans fed and Tom
and Jerry led alternately. We met with no adventures. The lion or
lions, on whom, according to Hans, Kaneke had thrown a charm, did not
trouble us; we saw nothing of the Arabs or the savages whom that
strange person called his "friends". In short, we just walked forward
where Kaneke guided as safely as though we had been upon an English
road, till we came to the place where he said we were to halt.</p>

<p>Such was our first march which in the weeks that followed was
typical of scores of others. Nothing happened to us upon that prolonged
trek; at least, nothing out of the way. It was as though a charm had
been laid upon us, protecting us from all evils and difficulties. A
great deal of the country through which we passed was practically
uninhabited. I suppose that the slave-traders had desolated it in
bygone years, for often we saw ruined villages with no one in them.
When they were inhabited, however, Kaneke would go in advance and speak
to their headman. What he said to them I do not know, but in the issue
we always found the people friendly and ready to supply us with such
provisions as they had, generally without payment.</p>

<p>One thing I noted: that they looked on me with awe. At first I put
this down to the fact that most of them had never before seen a real
white man, but by degrees I came to the conclusion that there was more
behind, namely that for some reason or another I was regarded as a most
powerful fetish, or even as a kind of god. Thus they would abase
themselves upon their faces before me and even make offerings to me of
whatever they had, generally grain or fruits.</p>

<p>While they confined themselves to these I took no notice, but when
at one village the chief, who could talk a little Arabic, having mixed
with slave-traders in his youth, brought a white cock and proceeded to
cut its throat and sprinkle my feet with the blood, I thought it time
to draw the line. Snatching the dead bird from his hand, I threw it
away and asked him why he had done this thing. At first he was too
terrified to answer, imagining that his offering was rejected because I
was angry with him.</p>

<p>Presently, however, he fell upon his knees and mumbled something to
the effect that he was only doing me honour, as the "messenger", or "my
messenger", had commended him. For the life of me I could not
understand what he meant, unless he alluded to Kaneke. While I was
trying to find out, that worthy arrived and gave the chief one look
which caused him to rise and run away.</p>

<p>Then I cross-examined Kaneke without result, for he only shrugged
his shoulders and said that all these people were very simple and
wished to do honour to a white man. Hans took a different view.</p>

<p>"How is it, Baas," he asked, "that they are always prepared to
receive us at these places and waiting with gifts? None of those men of
the Owl's" (he often called Kaneke the "Owl") "go forward to warn them,
for I count them continually, especially at night and in the morning,
to find if one is missing. Nor when we are travelling through bush can
they see us coming from far away. How, then, do they know?"</p>

<p>"I can't tell you."</p>

<p>"Then I will tell the Baas. The owl-man sends his spirit ahead to
give them notice." He paused, then added, "Or perhaps--" Here he
stopped, saying that he had left his pipe on the ground, or something
of the sort, and departed.</p>

<p>So this mystery remained unsolved, like others.</p>

<p>In every way our good luck was so phenomenal that with the
superstition of a hunter, which infects all of our trade, I began to
fear that we must have some awful time ahead of us. When we came to
rivers they were invariably fordable. When we wanted meat, there was
always game at hand that could be shot without trouble by Tom and
Jerry--Kaneke, I observed, would never fire at any beast even when I
offered to lend him my rifle. The weather was most propitious, or if a
bad storm came up we were under shelter. No one fell sick of fever or
any other complaint; no one met with an accident. No lion troubled us,
no snake bit us, and so forth. At last this unnatural state of affairs
began to get upon our nerves, especially upon those of Tom and Jerry,
who came to me one evening almost weeping, and declared that we were
bewitched and going to our deaths.</p>

<p>"Nonsense," I answered, "you ought to be glad that we have so much
good luck."</p>

<p>"Sugar is good," replied Tom, who loved sweet things, "but one
cannot live on nothing but sugar; it makes one sick, and I have had bad
dreams at night."</p>

<p>"I never expect to see my little daughter again, but if it is the
will of Heaven that cannot be helped," remarked the more phlegmatic
Jerry, adding, "Master, we do not like this Kaneke whom Hans calls the
Owl, and we wish that you would take command, as we do not know where
he is leading us."</p>

<p>"Nor do I, so I should be of no use as a guide. But be at ease, for
I am making a map of the road for our return journey."</p>

<p>"When we return we shall need no map," said Tom in a hollow voice.
"We have heard from Hans that the lady or the witch called White-Mouse
promised safety and good fortune to him, and to you, Lord, but it seems
that about us she said nothing--"</p>

<p>"Look here," I broke in, exasperated, "if you two men are so
frightened for no cause that I can see, except that everything goes
well with us, you had better follow the example of the porters at our
first camp, and run away. I will give you your rifles and as many
cartridges as you want, also the donkey Donna to carry them. I can see
no reason why you should not get back to the coast safely, especially
as you have money in your pockets."</p>

<p>Tom shook his head, remarking that he thought it probable that they
would be murdered before they had completed the first day's journey.
Then Jerry, the phlegmatic, showed his real quality, or perhaps the
English blood, which I am sure ran in his veins, manifested itself.</p>

<p>"Listen, Little Holes," he said to Tom. "If we go on like this, our
master Macumazahn will learn to despise us, and we shall be the
laughing stock of the yellow man Hans, and perhaps of Kaneke and his
people also. We undertook this journey; let us play the man and go
through with it to the end. We can only die once, and because we are
Christians, should we also be cowards? You have none to mourn for you,
and I have but one daughter, who has seen little of me and who will be
well looked after if I return no more. Therefore I say let us put aside
our fears, which after all are built on water, and cease to trouble the
master with them."</p>

<p>"That is well said," replied Tom, alias Little Holes, "and if it
were not for the accursed wizard, one of those who is spoken against in
the Holy Book, I should be quite happy. But while he is our guide, he
who with his people, as I have seen at night, makes incantations to the
stars--"</p>

<p>Here Tom chanced to look up and to perceive Kaneke standing at a
distance, apparently out of hearing, with his large eyes fixed upon us.
The effect was wonderful. "Be careful. Here is the wizard himself," he
whispered to Jerry, whereon they both turned and went away.</p>

<p>Kaneke came up to me.</p>

<p>"Those hunters are afraid of something, Lord," he said quietly. "For
days past I have read it in their faces. What is it that they
fear?"</p>

<p>"You," I answered bluntly--"you and the future."</p>

<p>"All men should hold the future in awe, Lord, so there they are
wise. But why should they dread me?"</p>

<p>"Because they think you are a wizard, Kaneke."</p>

<p>He smiled in his slow fashion, and answered:</p>

<p>"As others have done and do. If a man has more foresight or sees
deeper into hearts, or turns from women, or worships that which most
men do not worship, or is different from the rest in other ways, then
he is always called a wizard, as I am. Lord, what your servants need is
that which will change their minds so that they cease to think about
themselves. I have come to tell you that tomorrow we enter into forest
lands, which at this season are haunted by vast herds of elephants that
travel from different quarters and meet here for the purposes of which
we men know nothing. It might please you and those brave hunters of
yours to see this meeting and to shoot one or two of those elephants,
for among them are their kings, mighty bulls."</p>

<p>"I should like to see such a sight," I answered, "but there is
little use in shooting the beasts when one cannot carry the ivory."</p>

<p>"It might be buried till you return, Lord; at any rate it will give
the hunters occupation for a while."</p>

<p>"Very well," I answered indifferently, for to tell the truth I did
not believe in Kaneke's tale of vast herds of elephants that held a
kind of parliament in a particular forest.</p>

<p>Next night we camped on the outskirts of this forest of which Kaneke
had spoken. It was a very strange place, different from any other that
I have seen. In it grew great and solemn trees of a species that was
new to me; huge, clean-boiled trees with leafy tops that met together
and shut out the sun, so that where they were thickest there was
twilight even at midday, nor could any undergrowth live beneath them.
But the trees did not grow everywhere, for here and there were wide
open spaces in which, for some unknown reason, they refused to
flourish. These spaces, that sometimes were as much as a mile across,
were covered with scanty bush and grasses.</p>

<p>All that night we heard elephants trumpeting around us, and when
morning came found that a great herd of them must have passed within a
quarter of a mile of our camp. The sight of their spoor excited the
professional instincts of Tom and Jerry, who, forgetting their gloom,
prayed me to follow the herd. I objected, for the reason I have given,
namely that if we killed any of them it would be difficult to deal with
the ivory. Kaneke, however, hearing our talk, declared that the porters
needed rest and that he would be very glad if it could be given to them
for a day or two, while we amused ourselves with hunting.</p>

<p>Then I gave way, being anxious to learn if there was any truth in
Kaneke's story about the meeting-place of elephants that was supposed
to exist in this forest. Also I was desirous that the two hunters
should find something to do which would take their thoughts into a more
cheerful channel. Personally, too, I felt that I should be glad of a
change from this continuous marching unmarked by any incident.</p>

<p>So, after we had eaten and made our preparations, the four of us,
that is Tom, Jerry, Hans, and I, started--Kaneke would not
come--carrying large-bore rifles, a good supply of cartridges and some
food and water. All the rest of that day we followed the spoor of the
elephants, that had not stopped to feed in the glades I have described,
as I had hoped that they would do, but appeared to be pushing forward
at a great rate towards some definite objective. With one halt we
marched on steadily in the shadow of those huge trees, noticing that
the elephant-spoor seemed to follow a kind of road which wound in and
out between their trunks or struck in a straight line across the
stretches of thin bushes and grass.</p>

<p>More than once I wished to return, as did Hans who, like myself saw
no use in this adventure. Always, however, Tom and Jerry prayed to be
allowed to proceed, so on we went. Towards sunset we lost the spoor in
a thick patch of forest. Pushing on to find it again while there was
still light, we came suddenly to one of the open spaces that I have
mentioned which seemed to be much larger than any other we had seen,
also more bare of vegetation. It must have covered at least a thousand
acres of ground, and perfectly flat; indeed, I thought that at some
faraway epoch it had formed the bottom of a lake.</p>

<p>Near the centre of this oasis in the forest was a mound which, if I
may judge from pictures I have seen of them, resembled one of those
great tumuli that in certain parts of Europe the wild tribes of
thousands of years ago reared over the bones of their chieftains. Or,
as I afterwards discovered, more probably it was the natural foundation
of some lake-town where a tribe dwelt for safety when all this place
was under water. At any rate there it stood, a low, round eminence
covered with a scanty growth of flowering bushes and small trees.</p>

<p>Thinking that from this mound we might be able to see the elephants,
or at least which way they had gone, we marched thither, I reflecting
that at the worst it would be a better place for camping than the
gloomy and depressing forest. Having climbed its sloping side, we found
that on the top it was flat except for a large depression in the
centre, where perhaps once had stood the huts of its primeval
inhabitants. What was of more interest to us, however, than the past
history of the place, was that at the bottom of this depression lay a
pool of water supplied by some spring, or by rain that had fallen
recently.</p>

<p>Seeing this water, which we needed who had drunk all our own, I
determined that we would pass the night on the mound, although the most
careful search from its top failed to show any sign of the elephants we
had been spooring.</p>

<p>"Yes, Baas," said Hans, when I gave my orders, "but, all the same, I
don't like this place, Baas, and should prefer to get back to the
forest after we have drunk and filled our bottles."</p>

<p>I inquired why.</p>

<p>"I don't know, Baas. Perhaps the spooks of those who once lived here
are all about, though we can't see them. Or--but tell me, Bass, why did
that Owl-man, Kaneke, send us after those elephants?"</p>

<p>"To give Tom and Jerry something to think about, Hans."</p>

<p>He grinned and answered:</p>

<p>"Kaneke does not care whether those fellows have anything to think
about or not. I should believe that he did it to give us the slip, only
I am sure that he does not want to go on alone. So, Baas, it must be to
teach us some lesson and show us how powerful he is, so powerful that
he makes the Baas do what he wants, which no one has done before."</p>

<p>I reflected that Hans was right. I had not desired to come upon this
absurd hunt, yet somehow Kaneke had pushed me into it.</p>

<p>"I don't believe there are any elephants," went on Hans with
conviction. "The spoor? Oh, a magician like Kaneke can make spoor,
Baas. Or if there seem to be elephants, then I believe that they are
really ghosts that put on that shape. Let us go back to the forest,
Baas--if the Owl-man will give you leave."</p>

<p>Now I felt that the time had come for me to put my foot down, and I
did so with firmness.</p>

<p>"Stop talking nonsense, Hans," I said. "I don't know what's the
matter with all you fellows. Is your brain going soft as a rotten
coconut, like those of Tom and Jerry? We will sleep here tonight and
return tomorrow to the camp."</p>

<p>"Oh, the Baas thinks he is going to sleep tonight. Yes, he thinks he
is going to sleep," sniggered Hans. "Well, we shall see," and he
bolted, still sniggering, before my wrath could descend upon him.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>The sun set and presently the big moon came up. We ate of the food
we had with us; as we had nothing to cook it was needless to light a
fire, nor indeed did I wish to do so, for in such a spot a fire was a
dangerous advertisement. So, as it seemed foolish to set a watch in the
middle of that open space, where there being no buck there would be no
lions--for lions do not hunt elephants--we just lay down and went to
sleep, as tired men should do. I remember thinking, as I dropped off,
how extraordinarily quiet the place was. No beast called, no night-bird
cried, nothing stirred on that dead and windless calm. Indeed, the
silence was so oppressive that for once I should have welcomed the
familiar <i>ping!</i> of a mosquito, but here there were none.</p>

<p>So off I went and at some time unknown, to judge by the moon it was
towards the middle of the night, was awakened by a sense of oppression.
I dreamed that a great vampire bat was hanging over me and sucking my
toe. Now I was lying on my face, as I often do when camping out to
avoid the risk of moon blindness, just at the edge of that hole where,
as I have told, water had collected, in such a position that I could
look down into the pool. This water was very still and clear and thus
formed a perfect mirror.</p>

<p>As it happened there was something remarkable for it to reflect,
namely the head, trunk, and tusks of one of the hugest elephants I ever
saw--not Jana himself could have been much bigger! As my mirror showed,
he was standing over me; yes, I lay between his fore-legs, while he was
engaged in sniffing at the back of my head with the tip of his trunk
which, however, never actually touched me.</p>

<p>Talk of a nightmare, or of a night-elephant for the matter of that,
never did I know of one to touch it. Of course I thought it was a dream
of a particularly vivid order arising from undigested <i>biltong,</i>
or something of the sort. But that did not make it any better, for
although I had wakened the vision did not go away, as every decent
nightmare does. Moreover, if it were a dream, what was the hideous
stabbing pain in my leg? (Afterwards this was explained: Hans was
trying to arouse me without calling the elephant's attention to himself
by driving into my thigh the point of a "wait-a-bit" thorn which he
used to pin up his trousers.) Also was it possible that in a dream an
elephant could blow so hard upon the back of one's neck that it sent
dust and bits of dry grass up one's nostrils, inducing a terrible
desire to sneeze?</p>

<p>While I was pondering the question in a perfect agony and staring at
the alarming picture in the water, the gigantic beast ceased its
investigation of my person and stepping over me with calculated
gentleness, went to where Tom and Jerry were lying at a little
distance. Whether these worthies were awake or asleep I do not know,
for what happened terrified them so much that it produced aphasia on
this and some other points, so that they could never tell me. The beast
sniffed, first at Tom and then at Jerry; one sniff each was all it
vouchsafed to them. Then with its trunk it seized, first Tom and next
Jerry, and with an easy motion flung them one after the other into the
pool of water. This done, avoiding Hans as though it disliked his
odour, it walked away over the crest of the cup or depression in the
mound, and vanished.</p>

<p>Instantly I sat up, boxed the ears of Hans, who was still stabbing
at me idiotically with his wait-a-bit thorn and giving me great pain,
for speak to him I dared not, and slipped down the slope to the lip of
the pool to save Tom and Jerry from drowning, if indeed they were not
already dead. As it happened, my attentions were needless, for the pool
was quite shallow and this pair, whom the elephant had not hurt at all,
were seated on its bottom and indulging in suppressed hysterics, their
heads appearing above the surface of the water.</p>

<p>A more ridiculous sight than they presented, even in the terror of
that occurrence, cannot be imagined. In all my life I never saw its
like. Think of two men of whom nothing was visible except the heads,
seated in the water and gibbering at each other in a dumb paroxysm of
fear.</p>

<p>I whispered to them to come out, also that if they made a noise I
would kill them both, whereupon somewhat reassured at my appearance,
they crawled to the bank of the pool, which proved that none of their
bones were broken, and emerged wreathed in water-cresses. Then leaving
them to recover as best they could, followed by Hans and carrying my
heavy rifle, I crept to the edge of the depression and peeped over.</p>

<p>There, as the bright moonlight showed me, not twenty yards away
stood the enormous bull upon a little promontory or platform which
projected from the side of the mound, reminding one of a rostrum
erected for the convenience of the speaker at an open-air meeting. Yes,
there it stood as though it were carved in stone.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<center>
<h1><a name="c08">CHAPTER VIII</a></h1>

<br>


<h1>THE ELEPHANT DANCE</h1>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>Never shall I forget that amazing scene, bitten as it is into the
tablets of my mind by the acids of fear and wonder. Imagine it! The
wide plain or lake bottom surrounded upon all sides by the black ring
of the forest and plunged in a silence so complete that it seemed
almost audible. Then there, just beneath us, the gigantic and ancient
elephant--for it was ancient, as I could see by various signs, standing
motionless and in an attitude which gave a strange impression of
melancholy, such melancholy as might possess an aged man who,
revisiting the home of his youth, finds it a desolation.</p>

<p>"Baas," whispered Hans, "if you shift a little more to the left you
might get him behind the ear and shoot him dead."</p>

<p>"I don't want to shoot him," I replied, "and if you fire I will
break your neck."</p>

<p>Hans, I know, thought I made this answer because my nerve was shaken
and I feared lest I should bungle the job. But as a matter of fact, it
was nothing of the sort. For some unexplained reason I would as soon
have committed a murder as shoot that elephant, which had just spared
my life when I lay at its mercy.</p>

<p>Low as we spoke, I suppose that the bull must have heard us. At any
rate it turned its head and looked in our direction, which caused me to
fear lest I should be obliged to fire after all. It was not so,
however, for having apparently satisfied itself that we were harmless,
once more it fell into contemplation, which must have lasted for
another two minutes.</p>

<p>Then suddenly it lifted its trunk and emitted a call or cry louder
and more piercing than that of any trumpet. Thrice it repeated this
call, and for the third time as its echoes died the silence of the
night was broken by a terrifying response. From every part of the
surrounding ring of forest rose the sound of elephants trumpeting in
unison, hundreds of elephants, or so it seemed.</p>

<p>"Allemagter! Baas," whispered Hans in a shaky voice, "that old spook
beast is sending for his friends to kill us. Let us run, Baas."</p>

<p>"Where to, seeing that they are all round us?" I asked faintly,
adding: "If he wanted to kill us he could do so for himself. Lie still.
It is our only chance; and tell those hunters behind to stop praying so
loudly and to unload their rifles, lest they should be tempted to
fire."</p>

<p>Hans crept away to the edge of the pool, where the dripping Tom and
Jerry were putting up audible petitions in the extremity of their
terror. Then watching, I saw the most marvellous sight in my hunting
experience. As though they were the trained beasts of India or of the
ancient kings, marching in endless lines and ordered ranks, appeared
three vast herds of elephants. From the forest in front of us, from
that to our right and that to our left, and from aught I know from
behind also, though these I could not see, they came out into the
moonlit open space, and marched towards the mound with their regulated
tread, which shook the earth.</p>

<p>Perhaps I saw double. Perhaps my nerves were so shaken that I could
not estimate numbers, but I should be prepared to swear that there were
at least a thousand of them, and afterwards the others declared that
there were many more. In each troop the bulls marched first, the
moonlight shining on their white tusks. Then came the cows with calves
running at their side, and last of all the half-grown beasts, sorted
seemingly according to their size.</p>

<p>So Kaneke had not lied. This was the meeting of the elephants which
he had prophesied we should see. Only how in Heaven's name did he know
anything about it? For a few moments I began to think that he was
really what Hans and the hunters believed him to be--some kind of
magician who perhaps had sent us hither that we might be torn to pieces
or trampled to death.</p>

<p>Then I forgot all about Kaneke in the immediate interest of that
wild and wonderous spectacle. The herds arrived. They arranged
themselves in a semicircle, deep, curved lines of them, in front to the
mound upon which stood the ancient bull. For a while they were still,
then as though at a signal, they knelt down. Yes, even the calves
knelt, with their trunks stretched out straight upon the ground in
front of them.</p>

<p>"They do homage to their king, Baas," whispered Hans, and so in
truth it seemed to be.</p>

<p>The giant bull trumpeted once, as though in acknowledgment of the
salute. The herds rose, and there followed a marvellous performance
that might have been taken for a dream. The bulls massed themselves
together in squadrons, as it were, and charged past the mound from
right to left, trumpeting as they charged. After them came the
regiments of the cows, and lastly those of the partly grown beasts, all
trumpeting; even the little calves set up piercing squeals. They
re-formed, but not as they were before. For now the bulls faced the
cows and the rest. Then began a kind of dance, so swift and intricate
that I could not follow it, a kind of unearthly quadrille it seemed to
be, in which the males sought out the females, or it may have been the
other way about, and they caressed each other with their trunks.
Perhaps it was some kind of ceremony of betrothal, I do not know.</p>

<p>It ceased as suddenly as it had begun. The herds massed themselves
as at first, then wheeled and marched off in their three divisions back
to the forest whence they came. Soon all were gone except the old
king-bull, who still stood silent just beneath us, majesty and
loneliness personified.</p>

<p>"Do you think he is going to stop here always, Baas?" whispered
Hans. "Because if so, really it might be best to shoot him now that the
others have gone away."</p>

<p>"Be silent," I answered; "he may understand you."</p>

<p>Yes, my nerves were so upset by what I had seen that I was fool
enough to talk thus.</p>

<p>"Yes, Baas," assented Hans in his hoarse whisper, "I forgot that; he
may, so I didn't really mean what I seemed to say about shooting him.
It was only a joke. Also it might bring the others back."</p>

<p>At that moment, to my horror, the king-bull turned and walked
straight up to us. I couldn't have shot him if I had wished, because as
I had made the others do, I had unloaded my rifle to keep myself out of
temptation. Also I did not wish; I was too much afraid. He stood still,
contemplating us, a giant of a creature with a mild and meditative eye.
Then he lifted his trunk and I muttered a prayer, thinking that all was
over. But no, he only placed the tip of it against the middle of Hans,
who somehow had got to his knees, and let off one fearful scream
accompanied by such a blast of air that it blew Hans backwards down the
slope on to the recumbent forms of Tom and Jerry.</p>

<p>This done, the bull turned again, walked down the mound and out
across the plain, a picture of stately solitude till at last he
vanished in the dark shadow of the forest.</p>

<p>When he was lost to sight I went down to the pool and drank, for the
perspiration induced by terror seemed to have dried me up. Then I
looked at my three retainers, who were huddled in a heap on the edge of
the pool.</p>

<p>"I am dead," muttered Hans, who was lying on the other two. "That
Satan of an elephant has blown out my inside. It has gone; there is
nothing left but my backbone."</p>

<p>"No wonder, as you cursed him and wanted Macumazahn to shoot him,"
muttered Tom. "For did not that <i>afreet</i> of a beast cast us into
the pool for nothing at all?"</p>

<p>"Whether you have a stomach or not, be pleased to cease sitting on
my face, yellow man, or I will make my teeth meet in you," gurgled
Jerry.</p>

<p>Thus they went on, and so ridiculous were the aspect and the talk of
the three of them, that at last I burst out laughing, which relieved my
nerves and did me good. Then I lit my pipe, hoping that those elephants
would not see the light or smell the tobacco down in that hole, and not
caring much if they did, for I seemed to desire a smoke more than
anything on earth.</p>

<p>"Let us talk," I said to the others. "What are we to do?"</p>

<p>"Get out of this, master, and at once," said Tom. "That beast is not
an elephant, it is an evil spirit in the shape of one. Yes, I who am a
Christian and have renounced all superstitions, say that it is an evil
spirit."</p>

<p>"Little Holes is quite right," broke in Jerry. "If it had been an
elephant, it would have killed us, but being an evil spirit it threw us
into the water."</p>

<p>"Fool!" grunted Hans, rubbing his middle, "do you make an evil
spirit better than an elephant? In truth, as the Baas knows, the bull
is neither; it is a chief or a king who once lived in this place as a
man, and now had turned into an elephant, and all those other beasts
whom you did not see, being so much afraid, were once his people, but
now also are elephants. That is quite clear to the Baas, and to me who
am a better Christian than either of you. Still, I agree with you that
the sooner we see the last of this haunted place, the better it will
be."</p>

<p>Thus they wrangled on till they were tired. When they had finished I
said:</p>

<p>"Here we stop till dawn breaks. Do you three climb to the top of
this hole and keep watch. I am tired and am going to sleep. Wake me if
you see the elephants coming back."</p>

<p>So I lay down and slept, or at any rate dozed, which, as I have
said--thank Heaven!--I can do at any time after any experience. I am a
fatalist, one who does not trouble as to what is to happen in the
future, because I know it must happen and that worry is therefore
useless. If the elephants were going to kill me, I could not help it;
meanwhile I would get some rest.</p>

<p>So I slept, and dreamed that I saw this place standing in the middle
of a lake and full of people. They were tall, dark men and women, the
latter decently dressed in garments that were dyed with various
colours. The mound was covered with huts that were thatched with reeds,
and wooden jetties, to which canoes were tied, ran out into the
surrounding shallow water. On the broad surface of the lake were other
canoes, each containing one or two men who were engaged in fishing,
while round this lake lay the dense forest, as it did today. In my
dream the hollow in which now was the pool by which I lay, was thatched
over, the roof being supported by carved posts of black wood. They were
very curious carvings, but when I woke up I could not remember their
details.</p>

<p>There was a meeting going on in this large public gathering place,
and a man who wore a cloak and cap made of feathers, the chief, I take
it, had risen from a chair fashioned of four tusks of ivory with a seat
of twisted rushes, and was addressing the assembly, apparently upon
some important subject, for his audience of old men seemed to be much
impressed. He beat his breast and put some question to them. Then,
while they debated in low tones as to their answer, I woke up to find
that it was light.</p>

<p>Of course this dream was all nonsense born of imaginings as to what
might have been the previous history of that place, and I paid no
attention to it. Still, it fitted in well enough with the surroundings,
so well that had I been mystically minded, I might have been inclined
to believe that it did really portray some incident of past history
that had happened when this mound was an island in a lake inhabited by
a primeval people who dwelt there in order to be safe from the attacks
of enemies.</p>

<p>Hans, like myself, had been asleep, but the hunters, who were far
too frightened to think of shutting their eyes, reported that they had
neither seen nor heard any elephants.</p>

<p>"Then let's go off home, before they come back," I said
cheerfully.</p>

<p>So I took a drink of water, ate a handful of watercress, which I
have always found a very sustaining herb, and away we started; glad
enough to see the last of that haunted mount, as Hans called it. While
we were on the plain we felt quite merry, at least Hans and I did,
although it was strange to look at that lonesome lake bottom and think
of the scene that had been enacted within a few hours, so strange,
indeed, that I was almost tempted to believe we had been the victims of
a vision of the night, induced by Kaneke's tale as to the great herds
of elephants which came together in this district.</p>

<p>When we entered the forest, however, our mood changed, for about
this place with its endless giant trees that shut out the light of the
sun, there was an air of gloom which was most depressing. On we marched
into the depths, following our own trail backwards, for I had been
careful to mark the trunk of a tree here and there, Red Indian fashion,
so that we might make no mistake upon our return. To lose oneself in
that forest would indeed be a dreadful fate. When we had tramped for a
good while and reached the spot where we had missed the spoor on the
previous day, I observed that Hans was growing anxious, for he kept
glancing over his shoulder.</p>

<p>"What is the matter?" I asked.</p>

<p>"If the Baas will look back the Baas will see; that is, unless I
have become drunk upon water and stream grasses," he replied in a weak
voice.</p>

<p>I did look back and I did see. There, about a hundred yards behind,
standing between two tree-trunks, exactly on our spoor, was our friend
the king-elephant!</p>

<p>I halted, for I confess that for a moment my knees grew weak.</p>

<p>"Perhaps it is only a shadow--or a fancy," I said.</p>

<p>"Oh no, Baas. It's him right enough. I have felt him in the small of
my back for the last half-mile, but did not dare to look. Still, if the
Baas has any doubts, perhaps he would like to go and see."</p>

<p>At this moment, Tom and Jerry, who were well ahead, came tearing up
to announce that they had caught sight of elephants to their right and
left, and that we must go back.</p>

<p>"Oh yes," said Hans, "you are both very brave men, as you have
always told me, so please go back," and he pointed with his finger at
the apparition behind us, that seemed to have come nearer as we were
talking, although, if so, it was once more standing still.</p>

<p>They saw it, and really I thought that one or both of them would
collapse in a fit, for they were horribly frightened, as indeed I was
myself. However, I pulled myself together and spoke to them severely,
ending with an order to advance.</p>

<p>"Oh yes," repeated Hans who, in this extremity seemed to be moved to
a kind of grim humour.</p>

<p>"Advance, you brave hunters, for that is your trade, isn't it? and
please protect me, the poor little yellow man. No, don't look at those
trees, because we are not lizards or woodpeckers and nothing else could
run up them. And if we could, what would be the use, seeing that those
spook elephants would only wait till we came down again. Advance, brave
hunters, who told me only the other night that all elephants will run
away from a man."</p>

<p>So we went on till at last I cut his drivel short.</p>

<p>"Come on," I said, "and keep together, for there is nothing else to
be done. Remember that if anyone fires unless we are actually charged,
probably it will mean the death of all of us. Now follow me."</p>

<p>They obeyed; indeed they followed uncommonly close, so close that
when I halted for a moment, the barrel of the rifle of one of them,
which I observed was at full cock, poked me in the back.</p>

<p>Soon I became aware that we were absolutely surrounded by elephants.
That is to say, the great bull was behind, while unnumbered other
beasts were on our right and left, though in front I could detect none.
It was as though they were seeing us off the premises and politely
leaving a road by which we might depart as quickly as possible. They
saw us, there was no doubt of that, for occasionally one of them would
stretch out its trunk and sniff as we passed within twenty or thirty
yards of it. Moreover there was another thing. All these elephants were
standing at intervals head on to our trail, forcing us as it were to
keep to a straight and narrow road.</p>

<p>But each of them, when we had passed it, fell in behind the big bull
and marched after it. Of this there could be no question, for when we
were crossing one of the open glades that I have described, I looked
back and saw an enormous number of them, hundreds there seemed to be,
stretching along in a solemn and purposeful procession. Yet to right
and left there were more ahead. It was as though all the elephants in
Central Africa were gathered in that forest!</p>

<p>Well, it is useless to continue the description, because to do so
would only be to say the same thing over and over again. For hours this
went on, till we got near the camp, indeed, towards which we were
travelling much faster than when we left it. Here the forest thinned
and the glades were more frequent. I counted them one by one until I
knew that we were close to the last of them and about a mile from the
<i>boma,</i> or perhaps a little more. Just then one of the hunters
looked back and gasped out:</p>

<p>"Lord, the elephants are beginning to run."</p>

<p>I verified the statement. It was true. The king-bull was breaking
into a dignified trot, and all his subjects were following his example.
Needless to say, we began to run too.</p>

<p>Oh, that last mile! Seldom have I done such time since I was a boy
in the long-distance race at school, and fast as I went, the others
kept pace with me, or went faster. We streaked across that glade and
after us thundered the elephants, the ground shaking beneath their
ponderous footfall. They were gaining, they were quite close, I could
hear their deep breathing just behind. There ahead was the camp, and
there, standing on a great ant-hill just in front of it, conspicuous in
his white robe, was Kaneke watching the chase.</p>

<p>Suddenly the elephants seemed to catch sight of him, or perhaps they
saw the smoke from the fire. At any rate they stopped dead, turned, and
without a sound melted away into the depths of the forest, the
king-bull going last as though he were loth to leave us.</p>

<p>I staggered on to the camp, dishevelled, breathless, ridiculous in
my humiliation, as I was well aware. For was I not supposed throughout
much of Africa to be one of the greatest elephant-hunters of my
day?--and here I appeared running away from elephants with never a shot
fired. It is true that the audience was small, a mysterious person
called Kaneke, a very spider of a man that seemed to have got me into
his web, and a score of porters, probably his tribesmen. But that made
the matter no better; indeed, if there had been no one at all to see my
disgrace, I should have felt almost equally shamed. I was furious,
especially with Kaneke, whom I suspected, I dare say unjustly, of being
at the bottom of the business. Also I had lost my hat, and what is an
Englishman without his hat?</p>

<p>Kaneke descended from his ant-heap to meet me, all smiles and
bows.</p>

<p>"I trust that your hunting has been good, Lord, for you seem to have
found plenty of elephants," he said.</p>

<p>"You are laughing at me," I replied. "As you know, I have not been
hunting; I have been hunted. Well, perhaps one day you will be hunted
and I shall laugh at you."</p>

<p>Then I waved him aside and went into my tent to recover breath and
composure.</p>

<p>Throwing myself down on the little folding canvas stretcher-bed
which, whenever it was possible, I carried with me upon my various
expeditions, I watched the arrival of the others who, after the
elephants turned, had come on more slowly. Tom and Jerry were almost
speechless with rage. They shook their fists at Kaneke; indeed, if
their rifles had been at hand, which was not the case for these were
dropped in their last desperate race for life (they were recovered
afterwards, unhurt, together with my hat), I think it very likely that
they would have shot him, or tried to do so.</p>

<p>"You have made us cowards before our master's eyes," gasped one of
them, I forget which. Then they passed on out of my range of
vision.</p>

<p>Lastly Hans arrived (<i>he</i> had not dropped his rifle), who
squatted on the ground and began to fan himself with his hat.</p>

<p>"Why is everybody so angry with me, Hans?" said Kaneke.</p>

<p>"I don't know," answered Hans, "but perhaps if you gave me a drop
out of that bottle which you keep under your blanket I might be able to
remember--I mean the one the Baas gave you when you had the
toothache."</p>

<p>Kaneke went into the shelter made of boughs where he slept, and
returning with a flask of square-face gin, poured a stiff tot of it in
to a pannikin, which he gave to Hans, who gulped it down.</p>

<p>"Now I am beginning to remember," said Hans, licking the edge of the
empty tin. "They are angry with you, Kaneke, because they think that
you have played a great trick upon them who being a wizard, have
clothed a lot of spooks that serve you in the shapes of elephants and
caused them to hunt us that you might laugh."</p>

<p>"Yet I have done nothing of the sort, Hans," answered Kaneke
indignantly. "Am I a god that I can make elephants?"</p>

<p>"Oh no, Kaneke, certainly whatever you may be you are not a god. Nor
indeed do I believe anything of this story, like those silly hunters.
Yet for your own sake I hope that the next time you send us out
hunting, nothing of this sort will happen, because, Kaneke, we can
still shoot, and those hunters might be tempted to learn whether a
wizard's skin can turn bullets. And now, as your toothache has gone, I
will take that gin and give it back to the Baas, because he has not
much of it, and even a wizard cannot make good gin."</p>

<p>Then Hans rose and snatched the bottle out of Kaneke's hand. I must
add that to his credit he returned it to me undiminished, which--in
Hans--was an act of great virtue.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>Such was the end of that elephant-hunt, by means of which I had
hoped to relieve the tedium of that strangely uneventful journey and to
restore the moral tone of Tom and Jerry, also, to a lesser degree, that
of Hans and myself. Certainly the first end was achieved, for whatever
may be thought of our experiences at the meeting-place of elephants,
and afterwards, they were not tedious. But of the second as much could
not be said. Indeed, it left the hunters thoroughly frightened, the
more so because they did not know exactly of what they were afraid.</p>

<p>All the circumstances of the business were unnatural. None of us had
seen elephants behave as did those great herds, and the very mercy that
the beasts showed to us was beyond experience.</p>

<p>Why did not the old king-bull either run away or kill us there upon
the ground? Why did it and the rest of them hunt us back to the camp in
that fashion, yet without doing us any actual harm? No wonder that
these uneducated men saw magic at work and were scared.</p>

<p>Thrusting such nonsense from my mind, for nonsense I knew it to be,
I could not help remembering the odd coincidence that on this prolonged
adventure of our expedition, nothing seemed to materialize. So far it
had the inconsequence of a dream. Thus, at the beginning of it, when we
expected a desperate fight for our lives, there was no fight, at least
on our part. Only one shot was fired, that with which I killed the Arab
Gaika, who, be it noted, was Kaneke's particular foe, whose death he
ardently desired. In the same way when we went out with much
preparation to slay elephants and found them in enormous numbers no
shot was fired and the beasts chased us ignominiously back to our camp.
Further, there were more incidents of the same kind which I need not
particularize.</p>

<p>I was sick of the whole job and longed to escape. Indeed, that night
I went to Kaneke and told him so, pointing out that the hunters were
off their balance and that as I could not send them back alone I
thought it would be well if he parted company with me and my men, as I
proposed to retrace my steps towards the coast. Kaneke was much
disturbed and argued with me, very politely at first, pointing out the
many dangers of such a course. As I would not give way, he changed his
tone, and told me flatly that what I proposed would mean the death of
all four of us.</p>

<p>"At whose hands? Yours, Kaneke?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Certainly not, Lord," he answered. "However cruelly you break your
bargain with me, and this after taking my pay," (here he was alluding
to the cash and ivory which, like a fool, I had accepted), "I should
not be base enough to lift a hand against one who saved my life at what
he believed to be the risk of his own, although in truth no risk was
run."</p>

<p>"What do you mean? How do you know that, Kaneke?"</p>

<p>"I mean what I say, and I do know it, Lord. Even in that pit which
you thought so dangerous you were quite safe, as you were when the
Arabs attacked you and the elephants chased you, and as you will be to
the end of this adventure, if only you keep your promises. For was this
not vowed to you at the beginning?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Kaneke, by an unhappy woman whom I see no more."</p>

<p>"Those who are not seen may still be present, Lord, or their
strength may remain behind them. But if you turn back before your
mission is ended, it will depart. Those tribes who have welcomed you
upon your outward journey will one and all fight against you on your
return, until in this way or in that you are brought to your deaths.
Never again will you look upon the sea, Lord."</p>

<p>"That's pleasant!" I exclaimed, controlling my temper as best I
could. "Listen. You talk of my mission. Be so good as to tell me what
it is. The only mission that I have, or had, was to visit a certain
lake called Mone, if it exists, in order to satisfy my curiosity and
love of seeing new things. Well, I have changed my mind; I no longer
desire to travel to the Lake Mone."</p>

<p>"Yet I think you must go there, Lord, as I must, for that which is
stronger than we are draws us both. In this world, Lord, we do not
serve ourselves, we serve something else; I cannot tell what it is.
Everything we do or seem to do, good and bad together, is done to carry
out the purpose of what we cannot see. Like that beast Donna of yours,
we travel our road, sometimes willingly, sometimes to satisfy our
appetites, sometimes driven forward with strokes. Each of us has his
powers, which are given to him, not that he may gain what he desires,
but that he may fulfil an invisible purpose. Thus you have yours and I
have mine. I know that your servants and others hold me to be a
magician, and now and again you are tempted to believe them. Well,
perhaps in a certain way I am something of a magician, that is to say,
strength works through me, though whence that strength comes I cannot
say."</p>

<p>"All this does not leave me much wiser, Kaneke."</p>

<p>"How can we who have no wisdom at all ever grow wiser, Lord? To do
so, first we must be wise, and that will not happen to us until we are
dead. All our lives we toil that we may grow wise--in death, when we
may learn that wisdom is nothingness, or nothingness wisdom."</p>

<p>"Oh, have done!" I said in a rage. "Your talk goes round and round,
and ends nowhere. You are fooling me with words, but I suppose that
what you mean is, that we must go on with you."</p>

<p>"Yes, Lord, I mean that, amongst other things, unless indeed you
wish to stop altogether and go to seek wisdom in the stars, or wherever
she may dwell. Safety and good fortune have been promised to you and to
the yellow man your servant, knowledge also such as you love. These lie
in front of you, but behind lies that which all men shun, or so I read
what is written."</p>

<p>"Where do you read it, Kaneke?"</p>

<p>"Yonder," he answered, pointing to the sky that was thick with
stars, though the moon had not yet risen.</p>

<p>I stared at this solemn-faced, big-eyed man. Of all that he said I
believed nothing, holding that if not merely a clever cheat, like
others of his kind, he was a self-deluder. Yet of one thing I was sure,
that if I tried to cross his will and deserted him, his prophecies
would certainly be fulfilled, so far as we were concerned. Evidently
this Kaneke was one who had authority among natives. It would be easy
for him to pass a word back over the road that we had travelled, or in
any direction that we might go, which word would mean what he foretold
for us, four men only who must be at the mercy of a mob of savages,
namely--death. On the other hand, if we went forward, his vanity would
see to it that what he had asserted should come true, namely that we
should be safe. Not till afterwards did I remember that only Hans and I
were included in that assertion. Nothing was said about the two
hunters.</p>

<p>On the whole, after this talk I hated Kaneke more than ever.
Something told me that however plausible and smooth-tongued he might
be, at heart the man was deceitful, one, too, whose ends were not
good.</p>

<h1><a name="c09">CHAPTER IX</a></h1>

<br>


<h1>EXPLANATIONS</h1>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>Next morning early I laid all this matter before Tom and Jerry,
telling them that I had made up my mind to go forward with Kaneke and
that Hans would accompany me, as I considered on the whole that this
would be the safer course. If, however, they wished to return, I would
give them rifles with a fair share of our ammunition, also the donkey
Donna to take the place of porters. In fact, only in more detail, I
repeated the offer which I made before we went out to hunt, or rather
to be hunted by, elephants, explaining that I did so because after that
experience they might have changed their mind about its acceptance.</p>

<p>They consulted together, then Tom the Abyssinian, who was always the
spokesman, said:</p>

<p>"Master, after what we went through on the mound in the midst of the
plain and in the forest with those elephants, which we believe to have
been creatures bewitched, it is true that we are much more frightened
even than we were before. So frightened are we that were it not for one
matter, we would now do what we said we would not do, and attempt to
work our way towards the coast, even though we must go alone."</p>

<p>"What matter?" I asked.</p>

<p>"This, Macumazahn. We are men disgraced; not only did we show fear
and run when on duty, we did worse, we threw away our guns that we
might run more quickly, and therefore, although they have been found
and brought back by Kaneke's people, I say that we are men
disgraced."</p>

<p>"Oh!" I said, trying to soothe their pride. "Hans and I ran also.
Who would not have run with all those elephants thundering after him?
It was the only thing to do."</p>

<p>"Yes, Macumazahn, you ran also, and it was the only thing to do.
But, Lord, neither you nor Hans threw away your rifle against the
hunter's law--"</p>

<p>"No, we should never do that," I said, trying to interrupt, but he
went on rapidly:</p>

<p>"--So ashamed are we, Macumazahn, that I tell you, were it not that
we are Christians, both of us, we should have hung ourselves or
otherwise have put an end to our lives. But being Christians, this we
cannot do, for then we should go to answer for that crime to a greater
Master than you are. For this reason, Macumazahn, seeing that we may
not wipe out our shame as savages would do, we propose to redeem our
honour in another fashion. We hold that if we go forward with Kaneke we
shall die, for we believe ourselves to be men bewitched, yes, men
doomed by that wizard, whatever may be the fate of you, master, and of
Hans. If so, thus let it be, for we are determined that if we must die,
we will do so in some great fashion which will cause you to forget that
we are men who broke the hunter's law and threw away our guns, with
which it was our duty to defend you, and to remember us only as two
faithful servants who knew how to give their lives to save that of
their master."</p>

<p>I was so astonished at this solemn speech that I began to wonder
whether Tom, in order to console himself for the slur upon his honour,
the breach of the "hunter's law", as he called it, had got at my scanty
stock of spirits.</p>

<p>"What do you say?" I asked, looking hard at Jerry.</p>

<p>"Oh, Macumazahn," answered that phlegmatic person, "I say that
Little Holes is quite right. We two who have always had a good name--as
the writings about us told you--when trouble came have shown ourselves
to be not watch-dogs, but jackals. Yes, we are fellows who in the hour
of danger have thrown away our rifles, which we should have kept to the
last to protect the white lord who paid us. Therefore we will not go
back, although we believe that we walk to our deaths, being under a
curse. No, we will go on hoping that before the end you may learn that
we are not really jackals but stout watch-dogs; yes, if God is good to
us, that we are more, that we are bull-buffaloes, that we are
lions."</p>

<p>"Stuff and rubbish!" I exclaimed. "You make trees of grass stalks. I
never thought you jackals, who know you to be great-hearted. I dare say
if I had remembered to do so when those elephants were at my heels, I
should have thrown away my own rifle that I might run the faster.
Still, I think that on the whole you are wiser to come on than to try
to return alone, for reasons that I have told you. If there are dangers
in front of us there are worse behind, because, although he is no
wizard, as you think, Kaneke is better as a friend than as an enemy. So
I pray you to cease from dreams and quakings born of superstitions at
which Christians should mock, and to go on with bold hearts." Then, as
I thought we had talked enough, I shook them both by the hand, to show
that I was not angry with them, and sent them away.</p>

<p>Afterwards very diplomatically I began to tell Hans something of
this conversation, hoping to learn from him of what these hunters
really were afraid.</p>

<p>"Oh, Baas," he broke in, "it is no use to speak to me about what
passed between you and those fellows with half your tongue and your
head turned aside"--by which he meant telling only a part of the
truth--"because I was on the other side of that bush and heard every
word."</p>

<p>"You are a dirty little spy," I said indignantly.</p>

<p>"Yes, Baas, that's it, because if one wants to know the truth, one
must sometimes be a spy. Well, there's nothing to be said. No doubt
Little Holes and Jerry are quite right; they are bewitched, or at least
the Owl-man while he is flitting about at night has read their deaths
written in the stars, which they know. But they know also that, as they
have got to die, it doesn't matter whether they go with us or by
themselves. So, if coming on will make them depart to the place of
Fires happy and singing instead of sad and ashamed, thinking themselves
lions instead of jackals, as they said--why, Baas, let them come on and
don't trouble your head any more about them. For my part, however much
I love them, I am quite content that it should be they who have to die,
and not you and me. So cheer up, Baas, and take things as they
happen."</p>

<p>"Get out, you heartless little beast," I said, and Hans got out. But
all the while I knew that he was not really heartless, and, what is
more, he knew that I knew it. Hans in his own way was, on the outside,
just a rather cynical and half-savage philosopher, but within, a very
warm-natured person.</p>

<p>The end of it all was that we marched on as before, and, as before,
nothing particular happened. Kaneke, our guide, for I had not the
faintest idea where we were going, led us through every variety of
African country. We forded rivers, or if they were too deep and wide,
were conveyed across them by friendly natives on rafts or in canoes,
for when Kaneke had spoken to their chiefs, all the natives became most
helpful. On one occasion, it is true, as there were no natives, or such
as there were had no boats or rafts, we were obliged to swim, which I
did with trembling, being afraid of crocodiles. However, the
crocodiles, if there were any, politely left us alone, so that as usual
we came over safely.</p>

<p>After passing the last of these rivers our path ran through a dense
forest for two days. On the afternoon of the second day the forest grew
thinner and at length changed to a plain, or rather barren land that
was covered with small timber, bush-veld in short. This place was
intensely hot, filled with game of every kind and, as we soon
discovered from numerous bites, infested with tsetse-fly which lived
upon the game. As tsetse, except for the irritation of their bites, are
harmless to man and we had no horses or cattle, they did not alarm us,
for up to that time I shared the belief that donkeys were immune as men
and buck to their poison. This, however, proved not to be the case, at
any rate in the case of Donna that I was riding a good deal because the
heat made walking a most laborious business.</p>

<p>One day I noticed that she seemed suddenly to have grown weak and
stumbled so frequently that at length I dismounted. Relieved of my
weight she came on well enough without being led, for the intelligent
and affectionate beast would follow me or Hans, who fed her, like a
dog. When we camped that night she would not eat and was seized with a
fit of staggering.</p>

<p>At once I guessed what must be the matter. Probably she had been
infected a long while before and the added doses of the poison in this
fly-haunted plain had brought matters to a crisis, helped by a shower
of rain, which often develops the illness. There was nothing to be
done, for this venom has no known antidote. So we lay down and went to
sleep as usual. In the middle of the night I was awakened by feeling
something pushing at me. At first I was frightened, thinking it must be
a lion or some other beast, until I discovered that poor Donna had
managed to thrust her way through the thorn fence we had built and even
into my tent, of which the flaps were open because of the heat, and by
prodding at me with her nose, was calling attention to her state and
asking my assistance.</p>

<p>Of course I could do nothing except lead her out of the tent and
offer her water, which she would not drink. I tried to go away, but
whenever I moved she made piteous efforts to follow me, for the poor
thing was growing weaker every minute, till at last she tumbled down. I
sat myself at her side and presently she rolled over, laying her head,
whether by accident or design, upon my knee and died.</p>

<p>I have told of her end in some detail, because with the single
exception, that of a dog named Stump which once I owned when I was
young, it was the most touching and piteous that I have known where an
animal is concerned. Surely if there is any other life for us men,
there must be one also for creatures which are capable of so much
affection; at least I do not think I should care for a heaven where
these were not.</p>

<p>When it was all over I went back to my tent and slept as best I
could, to be awakened at the first dawn by a sound of lamentation.
Rising, I peeped over the fence to discover its origin and in the faint
light saw--what do you think?--Hans, whom it pleased to seem so callous
and hard-hearted, seated on the ground blubbering--there is no other
word for it--and kissing poor Donna's nose. Then I went back to bed,
where in due course he brought me my coffee, as was his custom at
sunrise.</p>

<p>"Baas," he said in a cheerful voice, "there is good news this
morning. Those tsetse-flies have finished off Donna."</p>

<p>"Why is that good news?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Oh, Baas, because the Owl-man, Kaneke, says there are mountains
ahead of us which she could not have climbed. He told me only the other
day that we should have to shoot her there, or leave her to be eaten by
lions, which would have been a pity. Also she was growing weak and
really was of very little use, so I am glad that she is dead, as now I
shall be saved the trouble of feeding her."</p>

<p>"Yes, Hans," I answered, "I saw how glad you were when I looked over
the fence just as the light began to glint upon the spears of Kaneke's
porters."</p>

<p>At this Hans put down the coffee in a hurry and departed, apparently
much ashamed of himself, because, as he said after I had told him the
story, he did not like being spied upon when his stomach was upset and
made him behave like a fool. I should add that the hunters were
depressed at this incident, not that they cared particularly for Donna,
but because they said that now our luck had changed and that death was
"a hungry lion", who, having tasted beast's flesh, would long for that
of men.</p>

<p>They were right. Our luck had changed. The decease of poor Donna
marked the end of our peaceful progress.</p>

<p>A few days later we came to mountains which for a long time past we
had seen in the distance, bold hills upon which at nightfall a
wonderful and mysterious blue light seemed to gather--the Ruga
Mountains, I believe they were called. It was quite true that here we
should have been obliged to leave Donna, dead or alive, for their
ascent proved to be a most precipitous business. Indeed, had not Kaneke
known the path, never could we have climbed them, because of certain
precipices that rose in tiers of terraces and must be circumvented,
since to scramble up the faces of them was impossible.</p>

<p>However he did know it, though to call it a path is a misnomer,
because there was nothing to show that it was used by man. For three or
four days we crept along the base of those great bare cliffs, always at
length finding some crack by which their flanks could be turned. So it
went on, an exhausting business, and as we mounted higher, very cold at
night, for although there was no snow, the air grew thin and
piercing.</p>

<p>At length we reached the summit of the mountains, which I found to
be table-topped, a very common African formation. (What caused it? I
wonder. Were the crests shorn off by ice in some remote era of the
world's history, say, a few hundred million years ago?) As it was
nightfall I could see no more, especially as a sort of blinding Scotch
mist, the fog called the "table-cloth" which so often hangs about these
flat-topped mountains, came up and obscured everything.</p>

<p>Next morning before the dawn Hans woke me up saying that Kaneke
wished to speak with me. I went grumbling in all the clothes I had,
with a blanket on the top of them and an old otter-skin kaross, that I
used above the thin cork mattress of my portable bedstead, thrown over
that, for the cold was bitter, or seemed so, after those hot
tsetse-haunted lowlands. I found Kaneke seated on a stone near to the
edge of the tableland. He rose and greeted me in his ceremonious
fashion, saying:</p>

<p>"Lord, you should not have slept so long, for after midnight the
mist melted or was blown away, and the stars were more beautiful and
brighter than I have seen them since last I stood upon this place a
long while ago. Indeed, so clear were they that in them I read many
things which hitherto had been hidden from me."</p>

<p>"Did you?" I exclaimed. "I hope that among them you read that we
shall soon escape from this cold which is gnawing my bones."</p>

<p>"Yes, Lord, I can promise you that before long you will be hot
enough. Hearken," he went on with a change of tone, "the time has come
when I must tell you something of my country and of what lies before
us. Look! The sun rises in the east. The sight is fine, is it not?"</p>

<p>I nodded. It was very fine. The rays of the morning light revealed a
vast plain lying some thousands of feet beneath us, and far away, set
apparently in the centre of this plain, other mountains shaped like a
flattened ring. Or perhaps it was a single mountain; at that distance I
could not be sure.</p>

<p>"See," went on Kaneke, pointing to this mass, "yonder within that
wall of cliff is the home of my people, the Dabanda, and there too is
the holy lake, Mone. From here the place looks small, but it is not
small. For a whole day a swift-footed man might run and not cross it
from side to side."</p>

<p>"What is it?" I asked. "A valley?"</p>

<p>"I think not, Lord. I think that it is the cup of one or more of
those great mountains that once vomited out fire; a huge basin with
steep walls that cannot be climbed, and slopes within that run down to
the forest at its base, which forest surrounds the Holy Lake."</p>

<p>"How large is this lake, Kaneke?"</p>

<p>"I do not know. Perhaps if a man could walk on water it would take
him two hours to reach the island in its centre; one hour to cross that
island and another two hours to come to the farther shore."</p>

<p>"That is a big piece of water, Kaneke, which means that the whole
space within the lip of the rock must be large. Are your people who
dwell in it also large?"</p>

<p>"Nay, Lord. Perhaps they can count five hundred men of an age to
bear arms; not more. Still, they are strong because they are holy, and
for another reason."</p>

<p>"What other reason?"</p>

<p>He dropped his voice as he answered:</p>

<p>"Did I not tell you the story of the goddess who dwells in my
country, she whose title is Engoi the Divine, and whose name is
Shadow?"</p>

<p>"You told me a story of which I remember something, as I remember
also that I did not believe a word of it."</p>

<p>"There you are both right and wrong, Lord Macumazahn, because some
of that story was lies with which I filled your ears for my own
purposes, and some was true. For instance, what I said about the Engoi
waiting for a white man was a lie. It was a bait in my trap. Lord, it
was necessary that you should come with me; why, I do not quite know,
but so I was commanded."</p>

<p>"Who commanded you?"</p>

<p>"That is my secret, Lord."</p>

<p>Now I bethought me of the deceased White-Mouse, and did not pursue
the matter, but asked:</p>

<p>"What do you mean by telling me that this lie was a bait?"</p>

<p>"What I say, Lord. I have learned through your servant, the yellow
man, who told it not to me but to another, that you worship all that is
beautiful, especially beautiful women, who when they see you, so you
announce, fall in love with you at once. Now you will understand, Lord,
why I baited my trap with this story of one who was very lovely and
waited for a white man, namely because I knew that you would believe
yourself to be that man and come with me upon that journey, being sure
that she who is named Shadow would reward you by kissing your feet and
redeeming you from your sins towards the other beautiful women, whom
the yellow man says you throw aside one after another as soon as you
are tired of them."</p>

<p>Now when I heard this preposterous and most shameless yarn, it is
true that, cold as it was, I nearly burst with heat and rage. If that
mischievous and romancing little Hans had been there, which he was not,
I declare that it would have gone ill with him; indeed, so angry was I
with Kaneke for repeating his calumnies, that I nearly made a physical
attack upon him. On second thoughts, however, I refrained--first,
because he was a much larger and stronger man than myself, and,
secondly, because I wished to get at the kernel of this mystery, for I
felt that, divested of the trappings invented by Kaneke, there remained
something most unusual to be elucidated. So I put the brake upon my
temper and answered:</p>

<p>"I thought that in your way you were a wise man, Kaneke, but now I
see that after all you are but a fool, who otherwise would have known
that Hans is an even bigger liar than you announce yourself to be, and
that the last thing I wish is to run after beautiful women, or any
woman, which always ends like our adventures with the elephants, in the
hunter being hunted. But let that be. Was any of your story true?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Lord, much. We have a goddess who is called Shadow, and who,
as we believe and not we alone, controls the gifts of heaven, sending
rain or withholding it, causing women to bear children or making them
barren, and doing many such things that bring happiness or misery to
men, though this goddess I have never seen, except once, as I told
you."</p>

<p>"A goddess! Do you mean that she is immortal?"</p>

<p>"No, Lord, but I mean that her power is immortal, or at least that
it goes on from generation to generation. The goddess, as I think, when
her office is fulfilled, dies or perhaps is killed."</p>

<p>"What office?"</p>

<p>"Lord, the Chief of my tribe, the Dabanda, is her head-priest. When
the goddess is of ripe age he is married to her, and in due time
becomes the father of a daughter, of which she is the mother. Perhaps
he is also the father of male children, but if so they are never heard
of, so I suppose that they are killed. When this daughter, the
Engoi-to-be, grows up, her mother, the Engoi-that-was, vanishes
away."</p>

<p>"Vanishes! How does she vanish?"</p>

<p>"I do not know, Lord. Some say that she who is called Shadow is
drawn up to heaven, some that she who is also called the Lake-dweller,
or Treasure of the Lake, swims out into the lake and is lost beneath
its waters, and some that the virgins who attend her, poison her with
the scent of certain flowers that bloom upon the island. At least she
departs, and her daughter, the new Engoi, reigns in her place and, like
her mothers before her, is married to her high-priest, the Chief of the
Dabanda."</p>

<p>"What!" I asked, horrified. "Do you mean to say that this chief
marries his own daughter?"</p>

<p>"Oh no, Lord. The chief never outlives the Shadow. He knows when she
is going to fade, and he fades at the same time, or earlier."</p>

<p>"How does he 'fade', as you call it?"</p>

<p>"That is a matter for him to choose, Lord. Generally, if he seeks
honour, in fighting our enemies the Abanda, among whom he will rush
alone until he is cut down. Or sometimes he chooses other roads to
darkness. At least he must walk one of them, because if he does not he
is seized and burnt alive; as the end is the same it does not matter
how it is reached."</p>

<p>"My word," I exclaimed, "it is strange that this goddess finds it
easy to get a husband!"</p>

<p>"It is not at all strange, Lord," answered Kaneke haughtily, "seeing
that to wed the Engoi is the greatest honour that can befall any man in
the world. Moreover, he knows that when his life here is over he will
dwell with her for ever in joy in heaven. Yes, they will be twin stars
shining to all eternity. Therefore before the Chief marries the Shadow,
he names some child he loves to be the husband of the Shadow which
shall appear.</p>

<p>"Thus it came about, Lord, that when I was but little, I was named
by the Chief, the half-brother of my mother, to wed the Engoi-to-be.
But I committed the great crime. I entered the sacred forest, hoping to
look upon the Engoi, of whose beauty I had heard, not her whom I should
wed, for as yet she did not live, but one who went before her. It was
for this crime that misfortunes fell upon me, as I have told you, and I
was driven from the land to atone my sins. Now I have been called back
again to become the husband of the new Engoi, for such is my glorious
destiny."</p>

<p>"Oh," I said, "now at last I get the hang of the thing. Well, every
man to his taste, but after what you have told me, I am glad that no
one nominated me to marry an Engoi or Shadow, or whatever you call
her."</p>

<p>"Strange are the varying ways of men! That which you, White Lord,
think of small account, we hold to be the greatest honour which can
befall one born of woman. It is true that death lies beyond the honour,
but what of this, seeing that soon or late death must come? It is true
also that he who is named and consecrated the spouse of the Engoi of
days to come, must look upon no other woman."</p>

<p>Here I could not help remarking:</p>

<p>"But surely, Kaneke, you told me a story of a woman who helped you
to become chief of the Arabs in your town yonder, saying that you
grieved much when she died; also I think you spoke to me of your wives
who dwelt without your fence."</p>

<p>"Very likely, Lord, for have I not told you many things? Also, did I
say that the child that brought the woman to her death was mine, or
show you the wives who dwelt without my fence? Learn that I had not,
nor even had a wife, which is one of the reasons why those Arabs held
me a magician. What does a man want with wives who is sealed as the
husband of the Engoi, yes of the Shadow herself, if only for a year, or
even for an hour?"</p>

<p>"Nothing. Of course, nothing," I answered with enthusiasm. Then a
thought struck me, and I added, "But supposing that when at last he
sees this Engoi, he does not like her, or that she does not like him,
having met some other man whom she prefers?"</p>

<p>"Lord Macumazahn, you speak in ignorance, therefore I forgive you
what might otherwise be considered insult, or even blasphemy. It is not
possible that her appointed husband should not like the Engoi. Even
were she hideous he would adore her, seeing the soul within. How much
more, then, will he do so, since she is always the loveliest woman on
the earth, filled with light like a star and crowned with wisdom from
above."</p>

<p>"Indeed! In that case there is nothing more to be said. Only then,
Kaneke, why do her adoring people drown or otherwise make away with
such divine beauty and wisdom as soon as her daughter begins to grow
up?"</p>

<p>"As regards your second question," went on Kaneke, taking no notice
of an interruption which doubtless he considered irreverent and
trivial, "still less is it possible that the Engoi should prefer any
other man to him to whom she is vowed, for the reason that she never
sees one."</p>

<p>"Oh," I said, "now I understand. That accounts for everything,
including your banishment from your home. A woman who never sees any
man except the one she must marry is of course easily pleased, even if
she is called a goddess."</p>

<p>"Lord Macumazahn," replied Kaneke, much offended, "I see that you
wish to make a mock of me and my faith."</p>

<p>"As you did of that of the Mahommedans," I suggested mildly.</p>

<p>"I see also," he went on, "that you think I tell you lies."</p>

<p>"As you have just admitted you did in the past."</p>

<p>He waved his hand, as though to thrust this trifle aside, and went
on;</p>

<p>"Yet you will learn that as to the Lady Shadow, Treasure of the
Lake, and her husband, who is called 'Shield of the Shadow', I speak
the truth. Indeed, you should have learnt it already, for have I not
told you that amongst other powers, he who is affianced to her whose
title is Engoi, yes, even before he has married her, has command over
wild beasts and men. What of the lion that I turned aside on that night
when you climbed the pit? What of those whom I called to rescue you
when the Arabs came up against you? What of the elephants which hunted
you when you went out to hunt them, and ceased when they saw me?"</p>

<p>"What indeed?" I echoed. "Perhaps when you have time you will answer
your own questions. Meanwhile I will put one more to you. Why have you
plotted and planned and so brought it about that I should be your
companion upon this very mysterious business?"</p>

<p>"Because it was conveyed to me that I must do so, Lord Macumazahn,
for reasons that as yet are not made clear to me. Doubtless you are
appointed to be of service to the Engoi and therefore to me. Also I
know that there will be a great war between my people, the Dabanda, and
the Abanda, who dwell in their thousands upon the farther side of
yonder mountain and who desire--as they have always done--that their
chief should wed the Shadow and thus bring rain and prosperity upon
them, and in this war you, who are a great general or so I have heard,
and who are so skilled with a rifle as I have seen, may be of use to
me."</p>

<p>"I see," I said. "As I was when I rescued you from your house and
afterwards when I shot that fellow Gaika. Well, perhaps I may and
perhaps I mayn't, since no one knows to whom he will be of use.
Meanwhile I thank you for telling me many things, some of which may be
true. And now I will go to breakfast, so good-bye for the present," and
I departed, aware that if I had disliked Kaneke before, now I
positively detested him.</p>

<p>To me the man seemed to be a mixture of a liar, a braggart, a
self-seeker, and a mystic, a most unpleasant compound, or so I thought.
Yet I had taken his money and was bound to serve him, or at any rate to
serve this wonderful Engoi, whose personal name was Shadow, if such a
woman existed. Possibly she might be better than Kaneke; at any rate I
hoped so.</p>

<h1><a name="c010">CHAPTER X</a></h1>

<br>


<h1>THE WANDERER</h1>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>By evening that day we had reached the plain at the foot of the
mountain and advanced some little way into its desolation. I use this
word advisedly, for when once we had got away from the foothills where
there was water, we entered most unpromising country upon which it was
evident rain fell but seldom.</p>

<p>The vegetation here was almost entirely of the cactus order, grey or
green prickly growths that stored up moisture within themselves. Some
of these were enormous, thick and tall as moderate-sized trees, and, as
I should judge, of great antiquity, their form suggesting huge
candelabra (for they had no proper leaves) or straight fingers pointing
up to heaven from flat bases, shaped like to the palm of the hand.
Others again were round green lumps, ranging from the size of a
football down to that of a pin-cushion, all of them, big or little,
being covered with sharp spikes, which made progress among them
difficult and, indeed, dangerous, for the prick of some of the species
is poisonous. These cacti, I should add, or a large proportion of them,
bore the most beautiful but unnatural-looking flowers of every size and
brilliant hue.</p>

<p>Another feature of this strange semi-desert area was the outcrop
here and there of columns of stone that from a distance looked like
obelisks, monoliths sometimes, but generally formed of round,
water-worn rocks resting one upon another. How they came here I cannot
imagine; it is a matter for geologists, but I noticed that they seemed
to be composed of hard rock left, perhaps, when millions of years ago
the lava from the great extinct volcanic area towards which we were
heading, was washed away by floods.</p>

<p>Through this curious country we travelled for three days, coming on
the second day to a small oasis where there was a spring of water,
which I was glad to see for our bottles were empty and we had begun to
thirst. I must add that we went at a great rate. Two or three of the
porters, relieved of their loads, which the others added to their own,
marched ahead, quite five hundred yards ahead, which, as Hans remarked,
showed that they knew the way and were scouts sent out to guard against
surprise. Kaneke followed, in the midst of the remaining porters, who
acted as his bodyguard. Then came Hans and I, the two hunters bringing
up the rear.</p>

<p>"Now I begin to believe, Baas," said Hans to me, "that something of
all that story which Kaneke has told is true, for though they will
never say so, it is evident that these men who know the road so well
belong to his people, also that they are afraid of being attacked.
Otherwise they would not go so fast through this wilderness of thorns,
or look so frightened."</p>

<p>"How do you know what tale Kaneke told me? Were you listening behind
a stone?" I asked, but got no answer, for at that moment Hans pricked,
or pretended to prick, his foot upon a cactus, and dropped behind to
dig out the thorn.</p>

<p>I pass on to the evening of the third day. We were at length getting
clear of the cactus scrub and reaching the foot of the westernmost
slope of the huge and massive mountain, which Kaneke had told me was
the shell of an extinct volcano within whose crater dwelt his people,
the Dabanda. There was but an hour to sunset, and though much
distressed by the heat and the lack of water, we were marching at a
great rate to reach a point where Kaneke said we should find a spring.
This he was anxious to do before dark, for now the nights were almost
moonless. Presently as we trudged forward, begrimed with dust and
gasping from the still heat, Hans, who was at my side, poked me in the
ribs, exclaiming in Dutch:</p>

<p><i>"Kek!"</i> (that is, "Look!")</p>

<p>I did look in the direction to which he pointed, and saw so strange
a sight that at first I thought I must be suffering from delusions.
There, running towards us down the slope of a low ridge of the mountain
mass where it merged into the plain, appeared a man, a very exhausted
man, who came or rather staggered forward in short rushes, halting
after every few paces as though to get his breath. This much I could
see with my eyes, but when I took my glasses, which I always carry with
me, I saw more, namely that this man was white! Yes, there could be no
mistake, for his garments, which seemed to have been torn from his
shoulders, showed the white skin beneath. Moreover his beard and hair
were red, or even golden, and his height and breadth were greater than
are those of most natives.</p>

<p>Next moment I saw something else also, for on that ridge of ground
which he had crossed, appeared a number of black spearsmen, who
evidently were hunting him. Dropping the glasses into my pocket, I sang
out to Tom and Jerry to give me my Winchester, which one of them
carried as well as his own, the heavy rifles and ammunition being in
charge of the bearers. In a minute it was in my hands, with a bagful of
cartridges.</p>

<p>"Now follow me," I said, and the four of us ran forward, passing
through the bearers.</p>

<p>By this time the exhausted white man was within about fifty paces of
us, while his pursuers, not more than six yards or so behind, were
beginning to throw spears at him as though they were determined to kill
him before he could reach us. As it chanced it was some of them who
were killed, for at my word we opened fire, and being decent shots, all
four of us, down they went. The man arrived, unhurt, and sank to the
ground, gasping out:</p>

<p>"My God! you are white! Give me a rifle."</p>

<p>I didn't, because I hadn't one at hand, nor, indeed, was he in a fit
state to handle a gun. Also, next minute there began a general
engagement on a small scale.</p>

<p>More spearsmen--tall, shapely fellows--appeared over the ridge,
thirty of forty of them perhaps. Our bearers threw down their loads and
came into action with great vigour, uttering a war-cry of
<i>"Engoi!</i>--<i>Engoi!"</i> We fired away with the repeating
rifles.</p>

<p>It was all over in a few minutes, for a good many of the attackers
were down and the rest had bolted back across the ridge, while our
losses were nil, except for one man who had received a spear-cut in the
shoulder. They had gone, pursued by the porters who, from peaceful
bearers of baggage suddenly were turned into perfect tigers, furious
fighting-men who, weary as they were, rushed into battle like the best
of Zulu veterans. The transformation was so marked and instantaneous
that it astonished me, as it did Hans, who said:</p>

<p>"Look at those fellows, Baas. They are fighting, not strangers, but
old enemies whom they have hated from their mothers' breasts. And look
at Kaneke. He bristles with rage like a porcupine." (This was quite
true; the man's hair and beard seemed to be standing on end and his
eyes, usually so sleepy, flashed fire.)</p>

<p>"Did you see him tackle that tall one whom you missed," (this was a
lie. I never shot at the man), "the warrior who threw a knife at
you--snatching the spear from his hand and driving it through him? I
think they must be Abandas whom, as we have heard, the Dabandas
hate."</p>

<p>"I dare say," I answered, "but if so they are uncommonly like
Kaneke's crowd; of the same blood perhaps."</p>

<p>Then I bethought me of the white man, whom I had forgotten in the
excitement of the scrap, and went to look for him. I found him seated
on the ground, having just emptied a water-bottle that Jerry had given
him.</p>

<p>"There is something in horoscopes, after all," he panted out, for he
had not yet recovered his breath.</p>

<p>"Horoscopes! What the devil do you mean?" I asked, thinking that he
must be crazy.</p>

<p>"What I say," he answered. "My father was cracked on astrology and
cast mine when I was born. I remember that it foretold that I should
meet a white man in a desert and that he would save me from being
killed by savages."</p>

<p>"Did it indeed? To change the subject, might I ask your name?"</p>

<p>"John Taurus Arkle," he murmured. "Taurus from the constellation
under which I was born, or so I understand," he added with a little
smile and in the voice of one whose mind wandered; then shut his eyes
and began to faint.</p>

<p>Faint he did; so thoroughly that he had to be revived from my scanty
store of spirits. While he was recovering I took stock of the man, who
evidently was off his head from exhaustion. That he was an Englishman
of good birth was clear from that unfailing guide, his voice and manner
of speaking. Also he was well named John Taurus, <i>i.e.</i> John Bull,
though perhaps if the constellation Leo had been in the ascendant or
whatever it is called when he was born, that of Lion would have suited
him even better.</p>

<p>To tell the truth his physical qualities partook of both a taurine
and a leonine character. The wide breast, the strong limbs and the
massive brow were distinctly bull-like, while the yellow beard and hair
which, having been neglected, hung down on to his shoulders like a
mane, also the eyes which, when the sun shone on them, gleamed with a
sort of golden hue, as do those of lions, did suggest something
leonine.</p>

<p>In short, although not handsome, he was a most striking person, like
to no one else I had ever seen; aged, as I guessed, anything between
thirty and thirty-five years. Much did I wonder how he came to be in
this strange place where, as I believe from what Kaneke had told me, at
that time I was the first white man to set foot.</p>

<p>The gin did its work, and in due course John Taurus Arkle--a strange
name enough--regained his wits. While he was still unconscious Kaneke,
looking both disturbed and fierce, the spear with which he had killed
its owner still in his hand, came up and stared at him.</p>

<p>"It's all right," I said; "only a swoon. He will recover
presently."</p>

<p>"Is it so, Lord?" he answered, staring at Arkle with evident
disapproval and, I thought, dislike. "I hoped that he was dead."</p>

<p>"And why, pray?" I inquired shortly.</p>

<p>"Because this white man will bring trouble on us, as I always
feared."</p>

<p>"As you feared! What do you mean?"</p>

<p>"Oh, only that the stars told me something about him; as I read
them, that we should find his body."</p>

<p>Stars, I thought to myself; more stars. But aloud I said:</p>

<p>"Well, you read them wrongly--if at all, for he is alive, and please
understand that I mean to keep him so. But what is this talk of
trouble?"</p>

<p>"Talk," said Kaneke, pointing with the spear to certain silent forms
that lay around. "Is there not already trouble here? Moreover I learned
something from one of those Abanda fellows before he died, namely that
this white man had forced his way over the mountain crest into my
country of the Dabanda; that he had been driven out into that of the
Abanda; that he was forced to fly before them who wished to kill him,
as they do all strangers; that he fled, and being very strong and swift
of foot, outran them, till at last, when he was being hunted down like
a tired buck by wild dogs, he met us, and that happened which was
decreed."</p>

<p>"Yes," I repeated after him, "that happened which was decreed,
whether in your stars or elsewhere. But I want to know what is to
happen next. It appears that neither the Dabanda nor the Abanda like
this white lord, who henceforth must be our companion."</p>

<p>"Why must he be our companion, Macumazahn? See, he is senseless. One
tap on the head and he so will remain for ever, who, if he comes on
with us among peoples whom he has offended--I know not how--may cost us
our lives."</p>

<p>In an absent-minded fashion I took the revolver from my belt and
began to examine it as though to see whether it were loaded.</p>

<p>"Look here, Kaneke," I said, "let us come to an understanding. You
have just been suggesting to me that to suit some purpose of your own I
should murder, or allow you to murder, one of my own countrymen who has
been attacked by your people and other savages, and escaped. Perhaps
you do not understand what that means to a white man, so I am going to
tell you."</p>

<p>Here suddenly I lifted the revolver and held it within a few inches
of his eyes. Then I said in a quiet voice:</p>

<p>"Look here, my friend, in your country when you take an oath that
may not be broken, by whom do you swear?"</p>

<p>"By the Engoi, Lord," he answered in a startled voice. "To break an
oath sworn by the Engoi is death, and more than death."</p>

<p>"Good. Now swear to me by the Engoi that you will not harm this
white lord or cause him to be harmed."</p>

<p>"And if I refuse?" he asked sullenly.</p>

<p>"If you refuse, Kaneke, then I will give you time to change your
mind, while I count fifty between my teeth. If, after I have counted
fifty, you still refuse, or are silent, then I will send a bullet
through your head, because, friend Kaneke, it is time to settle which
of us two is master."</p>

<p>"If you kill me, my people will kill you, Macumazahn."</p>

<p>"Oh no, they won't, Kaneke. Have you forgotten that a certain lady
called White-Mouse, in whom I put much faith, promised me that I should
come quite safe out of this journey. Don't trouble yourself about that
matter, for I will settle with your people after you are dead. Now I am
going to begin to count."</p>

<p>So I counted, pausing at ten and at twenty. At thirty I saw Kaneke's
fingers tighten on the handle of the spear with which he had killed the
Abanda man.</p>

<p>"Be pleased to drop that spear," I said, "or I shall stop
counting."</p>

<p>He opened his hand and it fell to the ground.</p>

<p>Then I counted on to forty, and pausing once more, remarked that
time was short, but that perhaps he was right to have done with it and
to take his chance of what awaited him in or beyond the stars he
worshipped, seeing that this world was full of sorrows.</p>

<p>I counted on to forty-five, at which number I aligned the pistol
very carefully on a spot just above Kaneke's nose.</p>

<p>"Forty-six, forty-seven, forty-eight," I said, and began to press
upon the trigger.</p>

<p>Then came the collapse, for Kaneke threw himself down and in truly
Eastern fashion began to kiss the ground before my feet. As he did so I
fired, the bullet of course passing over his head.</p>

<p>"Dear me!" I exclaimed, "how fortunate that you made up your mind.
This pistol is much lighter triggered than I thought or perhaps the
heat has affected the spring. Well, do you swear?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Lord," he said hoarsely. "I swear by the Engoi that I will not
harm yonder white man, or cause him to be harmed. That was the oath you
asked, but I know that in it lies one that is wider, namely that
henceforth, instead of your serving me, I must serve you, who have
conquered me."</p>

<p>"That's it. You have put it very well," I replied cheerfully. "And
now--a gift for a gift. I am quite ready to renounce my new-won
lordship over you, and taking this white wanderer with me if he will
come, to leave you to go your own ways, while I and my servants go
mine, you promising not to follow or molest me in any manner. Is that
your wish?"</p>

<p>"No, Lord," he answered sullenly. "You must accompany me to the Lake
Mone."</p>

<p>"Very good, Kaneke, so be it. Tell me how matters stand and I will
give you my orders. But remember that if you disobey one of them or try
to trick me, or to injure this white lord, I who have only counted
forty-eight, shall count forty-nine and fifty. It is agreed?"</p>

<p>"It is agreed, Lord," he replied humbly. "Hearken. Yonder," and he
pointed to some rocks upon a slope not more than a few hundred yards
away, where grew trees of a different and more vigorous character from
any about us--"yonder, I say, is the spring we seek. Lord, we must
reach it at once, for our water is done, the white man has drank the
last, and very soon it will be quite dark and impossible to
travel."</p>

<p>"Good," I said. "Go on with your men and prepare the camp. I will
follow with the wanderer as soon as he can walk. Afterwards we can
talk."</p>

<p>He looked at me doubtfully, wondering, I was sure, whether I had it
in my mind to give him the slip. If so, probably he concluded that
without water and with a sick man it would not be possible for me to do
so. At least he went to collect his people, and presently I saw them
march with the loads up to the rocks where grew the green trees. To
make certain of his movements I sent Hans with them, telling him to
return at once and report if there was a spring and if so whether
Kaneke was preparing to camp.</p>

<p>To tell the truth I was by no means certain as to his intentions.
Possibly he meant to melt away in the darkness, leaving us in the
wilderness to our fate. This would not have troubled me very much had
it not been for the fact that nearly all the ammunition and food, also
some of my rifles, were among the loads. Otherwise, indeed, I should
have been glad to see the last of Kaneke, for I was filled with doubts
of him and of the business into which he was dragging me. However, I
must take my chance; amongst so many risks what was one more?</p>

<p>When he had gone I went to where the stranger lay behind some
stones, and to my joy found that he was coming out of his swoon, for he
had sat up and was staring about him.</p>

<p>"Who are you and where am I? Oh, wasn't there a fight? Give me
water."</p>

<p>"Keep quiet a little, Mr. Arkle," I said. "I hope to have some water
presently." (I had given Hans a bottle to fill.) "There has been a
fight. By God's mercy we managed to save you. You shall tell me about
your adventures afterwards."</p>

<p>He nodded, fixing his attractive eyes, which reminded me of those of
a retriever, on my face. Then, doubtless unaware that he was speaking
out loud, he said something rather rude, namely:</p>

<p>"Queer-looking little chap; hair like that of a half-clipped poodle;
skin like an old parchment, but tough as nails; and straight. Yes, I am
sure, straight. John Taurus, you are in luck. Well, it's time."</p>

<p>Of course I took no notice, but went to speak to Tom and Jerry, who
were standing close by bewildered and whispering, asking them how many
cartridges they had fired in the scrap, and answering their questions
as best I could, till presently in the waning light I caught sight of
Hans returning.</p>

<p>"It is all right, Baas," he said. "There's a good spring yonder, as
the Owl-man said, and he is camping by it. Here's water."</p>

<p>I took the bottle and handed it to Arkle, who seized it eagerly.
Then suddenly a thought struck him and he held it out to me, saying in
his pleasant, cultivated voice:</p>

<p>"You too look thirsty, sir. Drink first," words that showed me that
I had to deal with a gentleman.</p>

<p>To tell the truth I was dry, perished with thirst, indeed. But not
to be outdone I made him take the first pull. Then I drank and gave
some to Tom and Jerry. Between us those two quarts did not go far;
still, a pint apiece was something.</p>

<p>"Can you walk a little?" I asked Arkle.</p>

<p>"Rather," he said. "I'm a new man, and thank God those scoundrels
didn't get my boots. But where are we going?"</p>

<p>"To the camp yonder first. Afterwards to the Lake Mone if we
can."</p>

<p>A flash of joy passed across his face.</p>

<p>"That will suit me very well," he said. Then it fell, and he added:
"You are very good to me, and it is my duty to warn you that the
journey is dangerous, and if we get there, that the place and people
are--well, not canny. Indeed, you would be wise to turn back, for I
think that death is very fond of Lake Mone."</p>

<p>"I guessed as much," I said. "Have you been there, Mr. Arkle?"</p>

<p>He nodded.</p>

<p>"Then take my advice and say nothing of your experiences to those
with whom we are going to camp, for I suppose you talk Arabic. I will
explain why afterwards."</p>

<p>He nodded again, then asked:</p>

<p>"What is your name, sir?"</p>

<p>I told him.</p>

<p>"Allan Quatermain," he said. "Seems familiar to me somehow. Oh, I
remember, a man I knew--Lord Ragnall--told me about you. Indeed, he
gave me a letter of introduction in case I went south. But that's gone
with the rest. Odd to have met you in this fashion, but so is
everything in this place. Now, Mr. Quatermain, if I may put my hand on
your shoulder, for my head still swims a bit, I am ready to walk."</p>

<p>"Right," I answered, "but again I beg you not to be ready to talk,
at any rate in any language but our own, for except Hans, who can be
trusted on all important matters"--and I pointed to the
Hottentot--"none of these people understand English."</p>

<p>"I see," he said, and we started, Arkle, who limped badly, towering
above me, for he was a very big man, and leaning on me as though I were
a stick.</p>

<p>We reached the camp without difficulty just as darkness fell. While
the hunters pitched my tent which, although low, was large enough to
cover two men, Arkle lay down by the stream and drank until I begged
him to stop. Then he poured water over his head, and thrust his arms
into it to the shoulders, as though to take up moisture like a dry
sponge, after which he asked for food. Fortunately, we had still plenty
to eat--of a kind, hard cakes made of crushed corn that we had obtained
from the last natives we had met, and sliced <i>biltong,</i> that is
buck's flesh dried in the sun. These he devoured ravenously, as though
they were delicious, which showed me that he was almost starved. Then
he lay down in the tent and fell at once into a profound sleep.</p>

<p>For a while I sat listening to his breathing, which sounded quite
loud in the intense stillness of the place, and staring at the stars
that in the clear sky shone with wonderful brilliance. By their light I
saw Kaneke glide past me and, taking his stand upon a flat stone at a
little distance, make strange motions with his arms, which he held up
above his head.</p>

<p>"The Owl-Man is talking to his star, Baas; that bright one up
there," whispered Hans at my side, pointing to the planet Venus. "He
does that every night, Baas, and it tells him what to do next day."</p>

<p>"I am glad to hear it," I answered, "for I am sure I do not know
what we are to do."</p>

<p>"Oh, just go on, Baas," said Hans. "If you only go on long enough
you always come out the other side," a remark which I thought contained
a deal of true philosophy, though it left the question of what one
would find on the other side quite unsolved.</p>

<p>After this, having arranged that Hans and the two hunters were to
keep watch alternately, which was unnecessary where Hans was concerned,
seeing that he always slept with one eye open, I lay down in the tent,
and having said a short prayer, as I am not ashamed to confess I have
always done since boyhood, or at any rate nearly always, fell instantly
into a profound slumber.</p>

<p>While it was still dark--although, as I could tell by the stars and
the smell of the air, the night drew towards morning, I was awakened by
Arkle creeping into the tent.</p>

<p>"Been to get a bathe in that spring," he said, when he found that I
was awake. "Needed it when one hasn't washed for a week. I feel all
right again now."</p>

<p>I remarked that I was glad to hear it, and that he seemed to have
had a squeak for his life.</p>

<p>"Yes," he added thoughtfully, "it was a very close thing. Lucky that
I am a good runner. I won the three-mile race two years in succession
at the Oxford and Cambridge sports. Look here, Mr. Quatermain, you must
be wondering who I am and how I came here. I will tell you while it's
quiet, if you care to listen.</p>

<p>"The Arkles, though that isn't the name of the firm, for some
generations have been in a big way of business in Manchester and
London; colonial merchants they call themselves. They deal all over the
world, with West Africa among other places. My father, who has been
dead some years, struck out a line of his own, however. He was a dreamy
kind of a man, a crank his relatives called him, who studied all sorts
of odd subjects, astrology among them, as I think I told you. Also he
refused to have anything to do with trade, and insisted upon becoming a
doctor, or rather a surgeon. He met with great success in his
profession, for notwithstanding his fads, he was a wonderful operator.
Being well-off he took little private practice, but worked almost
entirely at hospitals for nothing.</p>

<p>"When I left college, by his wish I became a doctor too, but shortly
after I qualified at Bart's my father, whose only child I was, died.
Also my cousin, the only son of my uncle, Sir Thomas Arkle the baronet,
was killed in an accident, and my uncle begged me to enter the
business. In the end I did so, very unwillingly, to please my
relations. To cut the story short, I did not care for business, and
when there was so much property entailed upon me with the baronetcy, I
could not see why it was necessary that I should remain in an office.
On the other hand my uncle did not wish me to return to practice.</p>

<p>"So we compromised; I agreed to travel for some years in the
interests of the firm, specially in West Africa, where they wanted to
develop their trade, and incidentally in my own interest, because I
wanted as a physician to observe man in his primitive state and to
study his indigenous diseases. When the tour was finished I was to
return and put up for Parliament and in due course inherit the Arkle
fortunes, which are large, and advance the Arkle dignity, which is
nothing in particular, by the judicious purchase of a peerage, for that
is what it came to. That, more or less, was the arrangement."</p>

<p>"Quite so," I said, "or as much of it as you choose to tell me,
though perhaps there is a good deal more behind which, quite properly,
you prefer to keep to yourself."</p>

<p>"Perfectly true, Mr. Quatermain. By the way, as I am telling you
about myself, would you mind telling me who and what you are?"</p>

<p>"Not in the least. I was born in England of a good family, and
received a decent education from my father, who was a scholar, a
gentleman, and something of a saint. For the rest I am nobody and
nothing in particular, only a hunter with some skill at his trade, an
observer, like you, of mankind in the rough, and one cursed with a
curiosity and a desire to learn new things which, in the end, will no
doubt put a stop to all my foolishness."</p>

<p>"Oh no, it won't," he answered cheerfully, "that is, not until the
time appointed. I'll cast your horoscope for you, if you like--my
father taught me the trick--and tell you when it will happen."</p>

<p>"No, you won't," I answered firmly.</p>

<p>At this moment Hans arrived with the coffee and informed me that
Kaneke was anxious that we should march at sunrise, as here we were in
danger.</p>

<p>Then followed anxious consultations. Arkle had a coat, or rather a
Norfolk jacket, but no shirt; and one of my spares, a flannel garment
that had cost me fifteen shillings at Durban and had never been used,
must be provided for him. Luckily it was over-size, so he managed to
drag it on to his great frame. Then a hat must be found, and so forth.
Lastly it was necessary to provide him with one of the spare Winchester
rifles and some cartridges.</p>

<p>Even before we were ready Kaneke arrived, not a little agitated, as
I could see, and prayed us to hasten.</p>

<p>"Where to, Kaneke?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Up the side of the mountain and over its lip, Lord, that we may
take shelter among my people the Dabanda. For be sure that after what
happened yesterday, the Abanda will kill us if they can. If this white
wanderer whom your servants call Red-Bull cannot march, he must be left
behind."</p>

<p>Here Arkle, who it seemed understood and could speak Arabic
perfectly, looked Kaneke up and down and replied that this was
unnecessary, as he believed that he could get along.</p>

<p>So, having swallowed some food, presently off we went, guided by
Kaneke up the steep mountain side.</p>

<p>"Did you call that man, Kaneke?" Arkle inquired when that worthy was
out of earshot.</p>

<p>"Yes," I answered; "but why do you ask?"</p>

<p>"Oh, only because of late I have heard a good deal of a person named
Kaneke from a native I know. But perhaps there are two Kanekes. The one
he spoke of was a young fellow who committed a great crime."</p>

<p>Then rather abruptly he changed the subject, leaving me
wondering.</p>

<p> </p>

<h1><a name="c011">CHAPTER XI</a></h1>

<br>


<h1>ARKLE'S STORY</h1>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>At first Arkle walked rather lamely, being troubled with stiffness
and his sore heel, but soon these wore off for the time, and in the
fresh air of the morning his vigour returned to him. Certainly he was a
splendid-looking man, I reflected, as I marched at his side, a perfect
specimen of the finest stamp of the Anglo-Saxon race.</p>

<p>While we went he continued his story.</p>

<p>"You were quite right in supposing that there were other reasons
which induced me to come to Africa besides those I mentioned. I will
tell them to you, if you care to hear them, for I may as well put my
cards on the table. If not, please say so, for I do not wish to bore
anybody with my affairs."</p>

<p>I replied that nothing would please me better, for to tell the truth
my curiosity was much excited.</p>

<p>"Here goes, then," he said, "though I expect that the tale won't
raise your opinion of me and my intelligence. As I have said, I am what
is called a man with prospects or rather I was, for these seem far
enough off today, and as such, having plenty of money to spend, I was
exposed to many temptations. Mr. Quatermain, I cannot pretend that
these were always resisted. I will pass over my follies, of which I am
ashamed, with the remark that they were such as are common to impetuous
young men.</p>

<p>"In short, I lived fast, so fast that my uncle and connections--my
mother, by the way, died when I was young--being nonconformist of that
puritanical stamp which often combines piety with a continual thirst
for worldly advancement, were quite properly scandalized, and
remonstrated. They said that I must change my mode of life, and as a
first step, get married. This my uncle desired above all things, for
there was no other heir, and as he often used to remark in a solemn
voice, life is uncertain.</p>

<p>"At length I gave way and became engaged to a lady very well born
indeed and very handsome, but without means, which, as I would have
plenty, did not matter. To be honest, I did not greatly care for this
lady, nor did she care for me, being, as I discovered afterwards, in
love with somebody else. In fact the marriage would have been one of
mutual convenience, nothing more. Now I am going to make you laugh.</p>

<p>"Although no one knew it and I scarcely expect you to believe it, I,
a man who, as I have said, could and did plunge into dissipations, have
another side to my nature. At times, Mr. Quatermain, I am a dreamer and
what is called a mystic. I suppose I inherited it from my father, at
any rate there it is."</p>

<p>"There is nothing wonderful in that," I remarked; "the old story of
the flesh and the spirit, nothing more."</p>

<p>"Perhaps. At least I put faith in queer and unprovable things, for
instance in what are called 'soul affinities', and even in the theory
that we have lived before. Would you believe that the great lump of
British flesh and blood which you see before you developed a 'soul
affinity', if that is the right term, with someone I had never
met?"</p>

<p>I looked at him doubtfully, reflecting that the hardships through
which he had passed had probably touched his brain. He read my mind,
for he went on:</p>

<p>"Sounds as though I were a bit cracked, doesn't it? So I thought
myself, and should still think, were it not for the fact that I have
found this affinity in Africa."</p>

<p>"Where?" I asked lightly. "At Lake Mone?"</p>

<p>"Yes," he replied, "at Lake Mone, where I always expected that I
should find her."</p>

<p>I gasped, and felt as though I should like to sit down, which, owing
to our hurry, was impossible. Evidently the poor man was rather
mad.</p>

<p>"As I have begun it I had better go on with my story, taking things
as they happened," he continued in a matter-of-fact voice. "I tell you
that in the midst of my wild and rather unedifying career I began to be
haunted by visions which came upon me at night."</p>

<p>"Dreams?" I suggested.</p>

<p>"No, always when I was awake and looking at the stars, and generally
when I was in the open air. The first, I remember, developed in
Trafalgar Square at three in the morning after I had been to a
dance."</p>

<p>"The wine is not always very good at those dances, I have been told,
or if it is, sometimes one drinks too much of it," I suggested
again.</p>

<p>"Quite true, but as it happened this one was given by a relative of
mine who is a strict teetotaller and never allows anything spirituous
in her house. I had to go to meet my fianc&eacute;e; it was a terrible
affair. When it was over I went for a walk and came to Trafalgar
Square, which at that hour was very quiet and lonely. There I stood
staring at the Nelson Column, or rather at the stars above it, for it
was frosty and they were beautiful that night. Then the thing came. I
saw a desolate sheet of water lit up by the moon, an eerie kind of a
place. Presently a form, that of a woman draped in white, appeared
gliding over the water towards me, floating, not walking. It reached
the shore and advanced to where I stood, and I saw that this woman was
young and very beautiful, with large, tender eyes.</p>

<p>"She stopped opposite to me, considering me, and a change came over
her face as though after long search she had found that which she
sought. Looking at her, I too seemed to have found that which I sought.
She held out her arms, she spoke to me; distinctly I heard her words,
not with my ears but through some inner sense. What is more, I
understood one or two of them, though they were in Arabic.</p>

<p>"I have always had a taste for studying out-of-the-way subjects, and
it happened that in my medical reading I had become interested in the
works of some of the old Arabian physicians, and in order to understand
them had found it necessary to master something of the language in
which they were written. This was some years before, and I had
forgotten most of what I had learned, but not everything. So it came
about that I caught the meaning of a sentence here and there--such as
these:</p>

<p>"'At last, O long sought. At last upon the earth.' . . . 'Not in
dreams.' . . . 'Follow, follow.' . . . 'Far away you will find and
remember.' . . . 'Yes, there the gates will be opened, the gates of the
past and the future.'</p>

<p>"At this point the vision, or whatever you like to call it, came to
a prosaic end, for a policeman arrived, eyed me suspiciously, and
said:</p>

<p>"'Move on, young gentleman. This ain't no place for the likes of you
on a cold night. Go home and sleep it off.'</p>

<p>"I remember that I burst out laughing; the contrast was so
ridiculous. Then because my heart was full of a strange joy, such as is
described by the old mystics who think that they have been in
communication with things Divine, I presented that policeman with half
a sovereign, wished him good night, walked away quietly to my rooms in
St. James's Place, and went to bed a changed man."</p>

<p>"What do you mean by 'a changed man'?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Oh, only that I seemed different in every way. It was as though
something had been torn, or a veil had been lifted from my eyes, so
that now I saw all sorts of new things; at least the old things took on
new aspects. From that moment, for example, I hated the dissipations
which had attracted me. I acquired different and higher objectives; I
came to know, what doubtless is true, that here in the world we are but
wanderers lost in a fog which shuts off glorious prospects, divine
realities, so that we can see little except dank weeds hanging from the
rocks by which we feel our way, and pebbles shining in the wet beneath
our feet. We make crowns of the weeds and fight for the bright pebbles,
but the weeds wither, and the pebbles when they are dry prove to be but
common slate. The dream woman that I had seen in Trafalgar Square
showed me all this, and a great deal more. I was changed! I who had
been a greedy caterpillar, devouring all that I could find, in that
half-hour in Trafalgar Square became a chrysalis, and then was
transformed into a butterfly."</p>

<p>"Most interesting!" I exclaimed, and with sincerity, for
notwithstanding Arkle's fine words and metaphors which I found rather
difficult to follow, this story did interest me very much. I didn't
believe in the Trafalgar Square vision, but, as an American would say,
I did hitch on to that transformation which, in our degree, most of us
have experienced at one time or another, however impermanent its
results may have proved. In some private Trafalgar Square of their own,
nearly all have met the Ideal, or the Divine, and in its unearthly
light have seen things high and strange; have seen also how petty and
how foul are the objects of their temporal desire.</p>

<p>Half an hour later it is probable that they will have forgotten the
former, and be hunting the latter even more fiercely than before.
Still, they have had the vision, and those to whom such visions came
may always hope. They have learned that there are gates in the gross
wall that is built about their souls. . . .</p>

<p>"Most interesting," I repeated, "but how about the lady to whom you
were engaged? Did you tell her what you had seen and heard in Trafalgar
Square?"</p>

<p>"No, I didn't, at least not all of it. The only difference was that
whereas I had merely disliked her before, afterwards I detested her,
that is, as a prospective matrimonial partner. However, I may add at
once that this engagement affair cleared itself up in a most
satisfactory fashion. The lady's aversion to me was even more real than
mine to her. Also she was rude enough to believe and to tell me she
believed that I was mad."</p>

<p>"That was pretty straight, though if you talked to her--well, as you
are doing now, not altogether surprising," I said.</p>

<p>"Quite straight, but I respected her for it. Lastly, as I have said,
there was a gentleman in the case. Now can you guess what
happened?"</p>

<p>"Of course. You broke it off, that's all."</p>

<p>"Not a bit. We didn't dare, for the row in both families would have
been too terrific. No, my hated rival was impecunious like my beloved
betrothed, whereas I had a good lump of cash at call, which my father
had left me. So I lent him &pound;5000--it's more polite to call it
lent--and they bolted to Florida to start orange-farming. I need not
say that I proclaimed myself broken-hearted and everyone sympathized
with me to my face and laughed at me behind my back, almost as heartily
as I laughed myself behind their backs. Meanwhile, I studied Arabic
like anything, which amused me, as I am rather quick at languages, and
took long midnight walks to develop my spiritual side."</p>

<p>"I say," I said doubtfully, "you are not making fun of me, are you,
Mr. Arkle?"</p>

<p>"Certainly not. At least I think I am not, for those Abanda have
killed my sense of humour. But you shall judge by the sequel. To cut it
short, I did seem to come more and more in touch with that lady of the
lake. Yes, in those starlit midnight hours she appeared to talk to me
more and more as my Arabic improved, and to tell me all sorts of
curious things about the past, the very distant past, I gathered, in
which we had been intimately connected and taken part in various
adventures, some of them tragic and all in their way striking and even
beautiful. I will skip these, for what is the use of repeating a lot of
old love-affairs that apparently took place in remote ages, only saying
that in the last of them at some indefinite date she brought about my
death and her own, that we might go to heaven together or rather to a
certain star, a crime for which, according to the visions, she is most
anxious to make amends. That is why, still according to the visions,
she must live in the distant spot where it happened, for as I
understand, the experiment did not succeed--I mean that we never got to
that star."</p>

<p>"Look here," I said, "all this sounds rather like a nightmare,
doesn't it?"</p>

<p>Yet as the words passed my lips, I remembered Kaneke's yarn about
his goddess in the lake who was supposed to have descended from heaven
and fallen in love with a man. Surely he said that she had killed this
man to take him back to heaven with her, which was not allowed.
Therefore she waited in the lake until he appeared again, after which I
did not gather what was to happen. The legend was of a sort that is not
unknown in Central and West Africa, but really it was odd to hear
another version of it from Arkle's lips.</p>

<p>"Very much like a nightmare," he assented cheerfully. "Being a
doctor I came to the same conclusion, as did some of the most eminent
of my profession whom I consulted. One of them asked me if I had
spotted the <i>locale</i> of these strange happenings. I replied, yes,
somewhere near some mountains in the central parts of Africa that were
called Ruga, where, as I believed, no white man had ever been, though I
had found them marked on an old map. 'Well,' he replied, with a twinkle
in his eye, 'if I were you I should go and look for the lady there. At
the worst you will get some good big-game shooting, and I have noticed
that people with hallucinations never come to any harm.'</p>

<p>"I thought this an excellent idea, and shortly afterwards I began to
work upon my uncle to send me out to Africa to advance the trade
interests of the firm. In the end he and the other partners agreed; you
see they sympathized with me very much on my matrimonial fiasco and
thought that a change would do me good.</p>

<p>"'In such a case,' said my uncle, who has a gift for platitude, 'new
countries, new customs, and new faces are most helpful.' I sighed and
shook my head, but said that I hoped so."</p>

<p>"How long have you been here?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Oh, I landed on the West Coast about three years ago. It took me a
long while to find those confounded Ruga Mountains, and I met with many
adventures on the way. However, at last I fetched up all right with
about half a dozen coast servants, good men all of them, for the rest
of the crowd had bolted at one time or another. And now I come to the
interesting part of the story, if you care to hear it."</p>

<p>"Of course I do. Who wouldn't?" I answered. "Go on."</p>

<p>"Well, I had heard of Lake Mone, the holy lake as it is called;
right away from the Congo and beyond it, indeed, rumours of this place
had reached me. I have told you that I am not bad at languages, and
during my first year in Africa, while I was attending to the business
of the firm, I also studied local tongues and customs on every possible
occasion. Thus I would get servants who could not talk a word of
English, and learn from them. Then I began to work my way up country
and at every tribe I came to, or rather at every village, I always made
a friend of the chief witch-doctor, for the African witch-doctors know
everything that is passing for hundreds of miles around them. Indeed
often they seem to know more than this, how or why I can't tell."</p>

<p>"That's quite true," I said, thinking of Zikali, "Opener of Roads",
the great wizard of Zululand of whom I have told some tales.</p>

<p>"Now," went on Arkle, "I must explain that I was not certain for
what I was searching. The visions which I had experienced in England
had shown me the desolate lake and a beautiful woman who spoke about
the past and our relations together in that past. But beyond saying, or
conveying, that it was in Central Africa she had never mentioned the
name of the lake, or told me how to get there, and from the moment that
I sailed from Liverpool the visions, or whatever they may have been,
ceased. In short I was left without any guidance whatsoever.</p>

<p>"It was here that the witch-doctors came in. I explained my case to
several of them, and when their mouths were opened by gifts, also by a
belief that although my skin was white I was one of their fraternity,
they became communicative. They had heard something of a sacred lake
that was inhabited by a great fetish, they believed this fetish was a
woman; they would inquire. That was the burden of their song. What is
more, they <i>did</i> inquire, once or twice by means of drum messages
which, as you know, the natives can send over hundreds of miles, but
generally in fashions that were dark to me. Also answers came, from
which in the end I learned that the lake where the great rain-doctoress
dwelt was named Mone, that her title was the Engoi, and that she was
known among the people round her as Shadow, or The Shadow.</p>

<p>"Following these clues, such as they were, though of course all the
while I understood that this Engoi, or Shadow, might be quite different
from her of whom I had dreamed, I worked my way slowly eastwards and
southwards, till at last I came to certain mountains which I was told
bordered the country where the Engoi lived. Indeed, from the crest of
them I was shown this great volcano, or whatever it may be, that we are
climbing now, which was declared to be her home. Also, I was informed
that between it and me dwelt a fierce and numerous tribe called the
Abanda, whose habit it was to kill anyone who set foot within their
borders.</p>

<p>"It was here that the last six men who had clung to me struck. They
were good fellows, faithful and brave; I never had to do with better.
Still, they came in a body and explained that although they feared no
man, they did fear wizards and ghosts. The country of the Abanda, and
more especially that of the Dabanda beyond it was, they had sure
information, full of both, and the stranger who entered there never
came out alive, 'even his spirit remained captive after he was dead'.
For these reasons they would not go one step farther.</p>

<p>"I saw that it was quite useless to argue, and therefore I made a
bargain. The village where this talk took place was inhabited by some
very friendly and peaceful agriculturists in country that the Abanda
never visited. This was my bargain: that those men should rest here for
one year awaiting my return. If at the end of that time I did not
appear again or send them further orders, they were to be at liberty to
divide my goods and go wherever they liked. These goods, I should
explain, are, or were, of some value, trade-stuff of all kinds for
presents or barter, rifles, ammunition, clothes, etcetera."</p>

<p>"How did six men manage to carry all these things?" I asked.</p>

<p>"They didn't. After most of my people deserted, by the help of the
witch-doctors and chiefs I arranged for their transport from town to
town or from tribe to tribe, letting the bearers go back and procuring
others when I moved forward. So if I appear no more those six coast
men, old soldiers most of them, will be rich, that is if they can get
the stuff away."</p>

<p>"Unless they are more honest than most of their kind, I expect that
they have done that already," I said, smiling.</p>

<p>"Possibly. I don't know, and to tell the truth I do not much care,
because it is improbable that we shall ever meet again. I realized this
when I made up my mind to continue the journey to Lake Mone alone."</p>

<p>"Do you mean to say that you tried to do that, Mr. Arkle?"</p>

<p>"Yes, and what is more, I succeeded. No, that isn't true; I did not
go quite alone. At the last moment, when I was about to start, a
sharp-eyed, wrinkled old fellow turned up, where from no one seemed to
know, who said that he was one of the people who lived in the Land of
the Holy Lake, whither he wished to return. He said that his name was
Kumpana, and that he wanted no reward except my companionship upon the
journey. That was all I could get out of him. Of course this sounded
fishy enough, but as I was going on anyhow, it did not matter, although
my hunters and the chief of the tribe--which, by the way was called
Ruga-Ruga, I suppose after the mountains--implored me not to trust
myself to such a guide. You see, I knew I should arrive and therefore I
wasn't anxious."</p>

<p>"Now I understand what faith is," I said.</p>

<p>"Yes, faith is everything. We are taught that in the Bible, you
remember. Well, I started; by the state of the moon it must be a month
ago. I took a gun and as much ammunition as I could carry, also a
pistol, a hunting-knife, and a few other necessaries, including an
extra pair of boots, while the mysterious old fellow, Kumpana, carried
the food. I say that he was old, for he looked so, but I should add
that he was one of the finest walkers and the best guide that I ever
knew.</p>

<p>"In three days, travelling down hill, we came to the country of the
Abanda, or rather to its outskirts. They are a numerous people who live
on a great plain upon the other side of this mountain, also on its
western slope, in a number of unfortified villages, with one central
town, which is much bigger than the rest. Their land, consisting
chiefly of decomposed lava, is extremely fertile when there is rain,
but just now it is suffering from a severe drought which, Kumpana said,
though how he knew it I can't tell you, has endured for three years, so
that they are almost starving, and consequently in a state of great
excitement.</p>

<p>"This drought, he said also, they attribute to the magic of the
Dabanda who live over the rim of the mountain, that is in the great
crater of the extinct volcano or group of volcanoes. Therefore--if they
dared--they would attack these Dabanda and destroy them, in order to
occupy their country and become the subjects of their goddess the
Engoi. But for some strange reason, which Kumpana could not or would
not explain, they do not dare."</p>

<p>"I have heard something of that tale--with differences," I said.
"Did you meet any of these Abanda?"</p>

<p>"No, not at that time, thanks to Kumpana. But you know what they are
like, for yesterday you saw some of them. In point of fact they almost
exactly resemble those bearers of yours, who from the look of them
might be either Abanda or Dabanda, for the two people are doubtless of
one blood and even speak the same dialect of Arabic."</p>

<p>"How did you avoid them?" I asked, making no comment on this
statement.</p>

<p>"By lying hidden during the day and travelling at night. As there
was no moon visible we must journey by starlight, and even that failed
sometimes when mist or cloud came up. But it seemed to make no
difference to old Kumpana, who must know the country like a book. On he
went up the steep mountain paths, seeing and climbing like a cat in the
dark, and leading me by a string tied to his wrist, for we were afraid
to speak except in the lowest whisper. Once or twice we passed quite
close to villages, so close that we could see the people gathered round
the fires. Here our danger was from the dogs, which smelt us and rushed
out barking, but fortunately their masters took no notice, thinking, I
suppose, that they smelt jackals or hyenas.</p>

<p>"On the third morning we came to the lip of the crater and had no
more to fear from the Abanda. Now another danger arose, for the pass,
which was nothing but a cleft in the rock, only large enough in places
for one man to squeeze through at a time, was occupied by Dabanda
watchmen, who of course challenged us, and were much astonished at my
appearance, for I think they had never seen a white man. Kumpana they
seemed to know (indeed, I believe that they were waiting for him
there), for they talked with him in a friendly and deferential fashion,
though I was not allowed to hear what they said. The end of it was that
we were detained here for a day and a night while messengers were sent
to a body of priests who are called 'The Council of the Engoi'.</p>

<p>"At dawn of the following day, that is twenty-four hours after our
arrival, these messengers returned, saying that we were to proceed to
the chief town upon the edge of the forest that surrounds the lake. So
off we went, escorted by some of the Dabandas, through a lovely
country, rich beyond imagining, for there had been plenty of rain here.
It reminded me of some of the lands that border on the Rhine, and lower
down, of those about Naples, and lower still of the South Sea Islands.
That is until I came to the deep belt of forest which surrounds the
Holy Lake where no man may set his foot."</p>

<p>"Did you see that lake?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Later I saw it and once or twice on the journey I caught a glimpse
of it, a black and gloomy sheet of water with an island in its midst.
In the evening we came to a large village where the huts or houses,
some of them round and some square, were white and stood in gardens. I
was taken to a large one of the square variety with a courtyard outside
of it, where soon I found I was a prisoner.</p>

<p>"After dark a man visited me. As there was no light in the hut I
could not see his face, but he told me that he was a priest of the
Engoi. Then, in the presence of Kumpana, he cross-examined me sharply
as to the reason of my visit, and affected surprise when I answered him
in his own tongue--Arabic. I told him all sorts of lies; that I wished
to see his country; that I was a white merchant and wanted to open
trade; that I desired to learn the wisdom of the Dabanda; and I know
not what besides. He replied that by rights I should be burnt alive for
sacrilege, but as a white man was expected in the country and possibly
I might be that man, the matter must be referred to the Engoi.
Meanwhile I was to remain a prisoner. If I left the courtyard of the
hut I should be seized and burned.</p>

<p>"A prisoner I did remain accordingly. For ten long days I sat about
in that horrible hut and high-fenced courtyard, overeating myself, for
I was supplied with plenty of excellent food, and driven nearly frantic
by doubts and anxieties. I felt that I was close to her whom I had come
to see, and yet in a sense farther away than I had been in London years
before. No more visitors reached me, nothing happened. At last I drew
near to madness. I even thought of suicide--anything to get out of that
intolerable hut and courtyard, for I saw, or thought I saw, that I had
been the victim of delusions.</p>

<p>"One evening when I was at my worst, Kumpana, my old guide, who from
something the priest said was, I discovered, a person of great
importance, came to visit me for the first time for days. He asked me
if I had a bold heart and was one who would dare much to satisfy the
desire of his heart, and if so, what was that desire. I replied that it
was to speak with a certain holy one whom already I had met in dreams,
she who was called Shadow and dwelt in a lake. He did not seem in the
least surprised, indeed he said he knew that this was so. Then he
added:</p>

<p>"'When the moon appears, walk out of the hut boldly towards the
darkness of the forest. There you will find those who will guide you.
Go with them to the borders of the lake, where perchance "one" will
meet you. After that I do not know what may happen. It may be
death--understand that it may be death. If you fear this adventure I
will guide you back out of the country of the Dabanda, but, then, know
that never more, in dreams or otherwise, at least during this life,
will you meet her whom you seek. Now choose.'</p>

<p>"'I have chosen,' I answered. 'I go into the forest.'</p>

<p>"'A certain holy one has judged you well. Speak with her if you
will, yet beware that you touch her not. Again I warn you to beware,'
he said, and bowing left me.</p>

<p>"At the appointed time I walked out of the door of the hut, my rifle
in my hand, for my arms had been left to me, perhaps because my captors
did not understand their use. The gate of the fence was open and the
guards had gone. I went through it and, following a path, came to the
edge of the forest. Here beneath the trees the darkness was intense and
I stood still, not knowing which way to turn. Shadows glided up to me.
Who or what they were I could not see, nor did they speak. They did not
touch me, so far as I could feel, yet they seemed to push me along.
Surrounded by them I walked forward.</p>

<p>"I confess that I was afraid. It came into my mind that my
companions were not human, that they were the spirits of the forest, or
ghosts of those long dead returned to their earthly habitations. Their
company frightened me; I spoke to them, but there was no answer, only I
thought that cold hands were laid upon my lips as though to enjoin
silence. Whither was I going in pursuit of a dream that had haunted me
for years? Perhaps not to find the lovely woman of that dream, but in
her place some blood-stained African fetish, some evil-haunted symbol
to which I should be offered as a sacrifice. My blood ran cold at the
thought, and I tell you, Mr. Quatermain, that had I known which way to
go, I would have turned and fled, for in this last trial my faith
failed me.</p>

<p>"But it was too late, and now I must face that risk of death of
which the old messenger had warned me.</p>

<p>"In dead silence I went on and on through the endless trees. My
hands brushed their trunks, I stumbled over their roots, but I never
struck them and I never fell. I could see nothing, could hear nothing
except my own footfall. Yes, by a pressure like to that of wind, I was
guided and sustained for hour after hour.</p>

<p>"At length we were out of the forest, for I saw the stars and the
faint effulgence of the hidden moon, also the gleam of water at my
feet. My guides seemed to have left me as though their task was done. I
was utterly alone, and the sense of that great solitude appalled my
soul.</p>

<p>"What was that upon the waters, just discernible, or perhaps
imagined? No, for it glided forward as a canoe glides that drifts in a
current, since of oars I heard no sound. It drew near, a magic boat; a
white veiled figure stepped upon the shore and stood before me. The
veil was drawn, I saw the outline of a face, I saw the starlight
mirrored in eyes that gleamed like stars.</p>

<p>"'You have dared much to come, O friend of my heart,' said a sweet
voice, speaking in Arabic, 'and I have dared much to bring you here
that I might talk with you a little while.'</p>

<p>"'Who and what are you, lady?' I asked.</p>

<p>"'I am one whose soul spoke with you in your great city far away.
Ay, and afterwards until I drew you to this land to find me in the
flesh. For I know that from of old your destiny and mine have been
intertwined, and so it must be till that end which is the real
beginning.'</p>

<p>"'Yes, perhaps. Indeed, I think I feel that this is so,' I answered.
'Yet what is your office here, you who live upon a lake surrounded by
savages?'</p>

<p>"'For my sins, O Friend, I must play the queen to these savages, and
be their oracle.'</p>

<p>"'Are you, then, divine?'</p>

<p>"'Are we not all divine, spirits fallen from on high to expiate our
sins and to draw upwards those against whom we have sinned?'</p>

<p>"'I do not know, Lady Shadow--for I suppose that you are she who in
this land is known as Shadow--since on this matter the different faiths
teach differently. Yet it may well be so, seeing that this world is no
happy home for man, but rather a place of bondage and of tears. But let
such questions be and tell me first--are you woman?'</p>

<p>"'I am woman,' she answered very softly.</p>

<p>"'Then being woman, why have you called me--a man--to your side from
half across the earth?'</p>

<p>"'Because it was so fated, and for the sake of ancient love.'</p>

<p>"'And now having heard your call and come and found you in the place
of which I dreamed, what must I do to win you?"</p>

<p>"'Look on me,' she said, 'and having looked, say whether you still
wish to win me, and if it is between us as it was in days you have
forgotten.'</p>

<p>"She came a little nearer; she loosened that enveloping veil and
stood before me, perfect and entrancing. The starlight gathered upon
her pure and lovely face; to my fancy it was as though she herself
radiated light. She was human and yet a mystery. She was a woman and
yet half spirit.</p>

<p>"'Of the past I know nothing,' I said, hiding my eyes with my hand,
'and of the present only that I desire you more than life and all it
has to give.'</p>

<p>"'I thank you, and I am glad,' she replied humbly. 'Yet know that I
may not be lightly won. Great dangers threaten me and those over whom I
rule and whom I must save before I satisfy my soul--and yours. How are
you now named in the world?'</p>

<p>"'John Arkle,' I answered.</p>

<p>"'Is it so? Then, O Arkle, you must return over the lip of this
mountain, and there find a white man who comes to help us and my people
in the war that is at hand. When you have found him and that war is
won, we will talk again. Go now. Your guides await you.'</p>

<p>"'I do not wish to go,' I said. 'Let me return with you to where you
dwell.'</p>

<p>"She became agitated. I saw her tremble as she answered
hurriedly:</p>

<p>"'It is not lawful; first all must be accomplished; that is the
price. No, lay no hand upon me, for I tell you we are watched by those
you cannot see, and if you touch me I shall find it hard to save
you.'</p>

<p>"I heard, but took no heed who was seized with a kind of madness,
and forgot Kumpana's warning. I had found one whom I had sought for
years. Was I to lose her thus, perhaps for ever? I stretched out my
arms and swept her to my breast. I kissed her brow.</p>

<p>"Then came a tumult; it was as though some frightful tempest had
broken over us. She was wrenched away and vanished. I was seized and
shaken as though by the hands of giants; my senses left me.</p>

<p>"When they returned again--it must have been long afterwards--I was
running on the mountain side, hunted by those savages whom you met and
drove away."</p>

<h1>KANEKE SWEARS AN OATH</h1>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>Arkle's story came to an end, and I said nothing. Luckily, he did
not appear to expect me to speak, for, glancing at him, I saw that he
was limping on like one in a dream, his eyes set upon the mountain lip
above us as though he were looking over, or rather through it at some
vision beyond, and that on his face was a faint, fixed smile such as I
have seen upon those of persons under hypnotic influence while they go
about the behests of the master of their will.</p>

<p>Evidently the man was not with me. He, or rather his mind, was fixed
upon that lake and its mysterious lady, if such a woman lived.
Contemplating him I came to the conclusion that he was the victim of
hallucination, or to put it bluntly--mad. For years he had been haunted
by this dream of a spiritualized maiden who was his twin soul, a very
ancient fantasy after all, and one still believed in by thousands.</p>

<p>For it is interesting to imagine that somewhere, in the universe or
beyond it, is hidden a counterpart, or rather a complement, of the
other sex who exists for us alone and thinks of us alone, he or she
from whom Fate has separated us for a while and laid upon us the need
to find again in life or death.</p>

<p>Such a dream is always popular because it flatters our human vanity
to believe that however lonesome and unappreciated we may seem to be,
always somewhere waits that adoring and desiring mate who burns to
welcome and to hold us everlastingly.</p>

<p>Without doubt Arkle was subject to this common craze, only in his
case, instead of keeping it to himself, as do the more modest, he
proclaimed it aloud, as might be expected of one of his robust and
sanguine temperament, streaked as it was with veins of inherited
mysticism. He had followed his clues, such as they were; he who had
dreamed of a lake-goddess, had heard of a holy lake supposed to be
presided over by some local and female spirit, and with wonderful
courage and resistance he had fought his way half across Africa to the
neighbourhood of this place.</p>

<p>Here he had fallen into the hands of a tribe hostile to those who
worshipped the water-fetish, or witch-doctoress, or rainmaker (nearly
all these African superstitions are connected with rain). Naturally,
never having seen a white man before, they seized him and kept him
prisoner. Ultimately they determined to kill him, but getting warning
of their kind intentions, he made a run for it, and so blundered on to
us with his would-be assassins at his heels.</p>

<p>This, I doubted not, was the whole story, all the rest about the
visit to the lady who met him on the shores of the lake being pure
imagination, or rather dementia. Still it was true that Kaneke told
somewhat similar tales--a puzzling fact. Oh, how I wished to heaven
that I had never tied myself to this Kaneke by accepting his ivory and
cash! But there it was: I had, as it were, signed the note of hand, and
must honour the bill.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact, at this very moment an instalment was ripe for
discharge.</p>

<p>We had stopped for a few minutes to rest and drink some water from a
mountain stream, and eat a few mouthfuls of food. Just as we had
finished our hasty meal, Kaneke, who was seated on higher ground fifty
yards ahead, turned and beckoned to me to come to him. I went, and when
I reached him, without a word he pointed to our left.</p>

<p>I looked, and there, advancing along a fold of the mountain at a
considerably higher level than ourselves, just at the foot of the
precipitous crater cliff a mile and a half, or perhaps two miles away,
I caught sight of glittering specks which I knew must be the points of
spears shining in the sun.</p>

<p>"What is it?" I said.</p>

<p>"The Abanda, Lord, coming to block our road, two or three hundred of
them. Listen, now. There in that cliff far above us is the only pass on
this side of the mountain which runs through the cleft to the crater.
The Abanda know that if they can reach the cliff before us we shall be
cut off and killed, every one. But if we can reach it before them, we
shall win through in safety to my own country, for there they will not
follow us. Now it is a race between us as to which of us will first
gain the mouth of the pass. See, already I have sent on the bearers,"
and he pointed to the line of them scrambling up the mountain-side
several hundred yards ahead of us. "Let us follow them if you would
continue to live."</p>

<p>By this time Arkle, Hans, and the two hunters had joined me. A few
words sufficed to explain the situation, and off we went. Then ensued a
struggle that I can only describe as fearsome. We who had marched far
with little rest were tired; moreover we must climb uphill, whereas the
Abanda savages were comparatively fresh and their path though rough lay
more or less upon the flat; therefore they could cover twice the
distance in the same time. Lastly, Arkle, although so strong, was still
stiff and footsore after his race for life upon the yesterday, which
delayed his progress. The bearers who, it will be remembered, had the
start of us, made wonderful time, notwithstanding their loads;
doubtless too they knew the Abanda and what would happen to them if
they were overtaken. As we clambered up the mountain-side--heavens! how
the sun-scorched lava burned my feet--Hans gasped out:</p>

<p>"A lot of those fellows who were hunting the Bull-Baas, whom I wish
we had never met, got away yesterday evening, Baas, and told their
brothers, who have come to make us pay for those who didn't get
away."</p>

<p>"No doubt," I grunted, "and what's more, I think they will reach the
mouth of the pass--if there is one--before us."</p>

<p>"Yes, Baas, I think so too, for the Bull-Baas has a sore heel and
walks slowly and that cliff is still some way ahead. But, Baas, the
ones who escaped yesterday have told these fellows about what happened
to those who didn't escape and what bullets are like. Perhaps we can
hold them back with the rifles, Baas."</p>

<p>"Perhaps. At any rate we'll try. Look how fast Kaneke is going."</p>

<p>"Yes, Baas, he climbs like a baboon or a rock-rabbit. <i>He</i>
doesn't mean to be caught by the Abanda, Baas, or his porters either,
whatever happens to us. Suppose I sent a bullet after him, Baas, before
he is out of shot, aiming at his legs to make him go a bit slower."</p>

<p>"No," I answered. "Let the brute run. We must take our chance."</p>

<p>At this moment Arkle, who was growing lamer, called out:</p>

<p>"Quatermain, get on with your servants. I'll look after myself."</p>

<p>"No, you won't," I replied. "We will sink or swim together."</p>

<p>Then I looked at Tom and Jerry and saw that they were alarmed, as
well they might be. Hans saw it too, and began to fire sarcasms at
them.</p>

<p>"Why don't you run, you brave hunters?" he asked. "Will you let
yourselves be beaten by the Owl-man? If the rifles are heavy, you might
leave them behind, as you remember you did when the elephants were
after us."</p>

<p>Such were his rather bitter jests, for Hans would crack jokes at
Death itself. I know that afterwards he regretted them earnestly
enough, as we often regret unkind words which it is too late to recall.
They stung Tom to fury, for I heard him mutter:</p>

<p>"I'll kill you for this afterwards, yellow man," a threat at which
Hans grinned.</p>

<p>The more phlegmatic Jerry, however, only smiled in a sickly fashion
and made no reply.</p>

<p>At length we were quite close to the face of the cliff, into which
we saw the porters vanishing, showing us where the pass or cleft began.
Unfortunately, too, the Abanda were quite close to us; indeed, their
leading spearsmen had emerged from the fold in the mountain-side about
three hundred yards away on to the open slope of lava, and were racing
to cut off Kaneke. That active person, however, was too quick for them,
as before they came within spear-cast of him he bolted into the
cliff-face like a meer-cat into its hole--perhaps a snake would be a
better simile.</p>

<p>"Now we are done," I said. "We can't get there before those brutes
and it's no use trying to run down the hill, for they would overtake
us. So we had better stay where we are to get our breath and make the
best end we can."</p>

<p>"No, Baas," puffed Hans, who had been searching the scene with his
hawk-like eyes. "Look. The Abanda are halting. They want to kill us,
Baas, but there is a donga between them and the hole in the cliff. See,
one of them is beginning to climb down it."</p>

<p>I looked. Although I had not observed it before, because it curved
away from us, on our left there was a donga, that is a gully or crack,
formed no doubt when the hot lava contracted ages before, which crack
the Abanda must cross to reach us.</p>

<p>"Push on!" I cried. "We may beat them yet."</p>

<p>Forward we went, the lame Arkle resting his hand upon my shoulder.
Now at last we were near the face of the cliff and, not more than sixty
or seventy yards ahead of us, could see the crevice into which Kaneke
and his crowd had vanished. Could we reach it? As I wondered an Abanda
appeared on this side of the donga. I halted, lifted my rifle, fired,
and, so blown was I, missed him. Yes, I missed him clean, for I saw the
bullet strike the spear-blade three feet above his head and shatter it
to pieces. This seemed to frighten him, however, for he dropped back
into the donga, and we pressed on.</p>

<p>When we had all but reached the cleft in the precipice that once had
been the lip of the extinct volcano, whence I trusted, quite vainly as
it proved, that Kaneke and his people would sally forth to help us, out
of the donga appeared six or seven men who rushed between us and the
cliff face in which we hoped to refuge.</p>

<p>There they stood preparing to attack us with their spears. We opened
fire on them and this time did not miss. They went down, but as they
fell more appeared, brave and terrible-looking fellows, furious at the
death of their companions. We fired rapidly, forcing our way forward
all the while, but I saw that the game was almost hopeless, for every
moment more of these Abanda crawled up some narrow ladder or pathway
from the bottom of the donga.</p>

<p>Then it was that I heard the Abyssinian hunter Tom call out:</p>

<p>"Run on, Macumazahn, with the lame master. Run on. I see how to stop
them."</p>

<p>Without waiting to reflect how he proposed to do this, for at such
moments one has little time to think; with Arkle leaning on my shoulder
and Hans at my side, I charged forward to the mouth of the cleft.
Certain of the Abanda were between us and it, but with this we managed
to deal with the help of our revolvers before they could stab us. Thus
we reached the cleft and plunged into it, for, to my relief, no more
Abanda appeared. Once in the mouth of the place, which was very narrow,
so narrow and twisted that a few men could have held it against a
thousand, as Horatius and his two companions held the bridge in the old
Roman days, I stopped, for I heard firing still going on outside.</p>

<p>"Who is shooting?" I asked, peering about me in the gloom of that
hole, and as I spoke the echoes of the last shot died away and were
followed by a savage yell of triumph.</p>

<p>"Little Holes and Jerry, I believe, Baas," answered Hans, wiping his
brow with his sleeve, "though I do not think they will shoot any more.
You see, Baas, for once in their lives they behaved very nicely. Yes,
they ran to the edge of that donga and stuffed themselves into the
mouths of the two paths by which these Abanda are climbing up it,
firing away until they were speared, thus giving you and the Bull-Baas
time to get into this hole, for of course they did not care what
happened to me who was their friend. So I suppose that they are now
dead, although perhaps they may have been taken alive."</p>

<p>"Great heavens!" I exclaimed. Then after a moment's reflection, in
spite of the remonstrances of Hans (at the moment Arkle was ahead of
us), I crept back to the mouth of the cleft and looked out, taking the
risk of being speared.</p>

<p>He was right. Yonder on the lava plateau lay the bodies of Tom and
Jerry, dragged there by the Abanda, one of whom was engaged in cutting
off poor Jerry's head with a spear.</p>

<p>Filled with grief and fury, I put a bullet through that savage,
which caused them all to scuttle back into their donga. Then, before
they could recover from their surprise, followed by Hans I rushed out,
seized Tom's rifle which one of them had been carrying and let fall in
his fright, and bolted back with it into the mouth of the cleft. That
of Jerry unfortunately we could not recover. I suppose it was carried
away.</p>

<p>That was the end of those two brave but ill-fated hunters who, from
the first day of our journey, had seemed to walk in the shadow of
approaching doom. It was a very gallant end, for without doubt they had
given their lives to save us, or rather to save me.</p>

<p>This indeed they had done, for by blocking the two exits of the
steep-sided donga for a few minutes, they had enabled us to fight our
way through into the cleft. Whether their courage was spontaneous, or
whether it was induced by a sense of their previous failure when they
had thrown away their guns, a trivial incident that seemed to prey upon
their minds, and by the gibes of Hans, I do not know. At least in this
moment of trial it asserted itself, with the result that they died and
we lived. All honour to their memory! One of my hopes is that in some
place and time unknown I may be able to thank them face to face.</p>

<p>I returned into the cleft filled with sorrow and told the others
what had happened. Hans, to do him justice, when he saw that his
guess--it was nothing more--had come true and that Tom and Jerry were
really dead, was also much distressed. He began to talk of their many
virtues and to rejoice that they, like himself, were "good Christians",
and therefore had nothing to fear in the "Place of Fires", his synonym
for heaven, which doubtless they were now inhabiting. Perhaps also his
conscience smote him a little for all the sharp things which jealousy
had caused him to say about them while they remained upon earth.</p>

<p>Arkle's attitude was different.</p>

<p>"These hunters," he said, "have died doing their duty, and therefore
are not to be pitied, for how can one make a better end? But what of
that fellow Kaneke, who ran ahead with his men and deserted you, his
companions? I say nothing of myself, for I am a stranger towards whom
he had no obligations. Why did he bolt?"</p>

<p>"I don't know," I answered wearily, "to save his skin, I suppose.
You had better ask him if we ever meet again."</p>

<p>"I will!" exclaimed Arkle, and as he spoke I noted that his face was
white with rage.</p>

<p>Soon the opportunity came. We thought it unwise to remain so near to
the mouth of the cleft, although none of the Abanda so far had
attempted to follow us, why, I could not imagine at the time, though it
is true Kaneke had said it would be so. Therefore I suggested that we
had better go on and find out whither the road led.</p>

<p>On we went accordingly, a darksome journey at first, for little
light reached us in that deep and narrow hole. Presently, however, it
widened and we found ourselves upon a kind of plateau bordered by
cliffs.</p>

<p>Here Kaneke was waiting for us seated on a rock, the bearers having
gone on; at any rate I could see nothing of them. He stared at us with
his sombre eyes and said to me:</p>

<p>"Knowing that you would be safe, Lord, I entered this passage before
you and have waited for you here, where the Abanda will not follow
us."</p>

<p>"So I see," I said sarcastically, "but pray, how did you know that
we should be safe?"</p>

<p>"I knew it, Lord, because it is written in your stars, as I knew
that the two hunters would die because I saw death in their stars; and
they are dead, are they not? As for the fate of the strange white man,"
and he looked at Arkle--malevolently, I thought--"I knew nothing, for I
have not yet had time to study it in the heavens."</p>

<p>Before I could answer Arkle broke in, speaking very quietly in a
low, fierce voice.</p>

<p>"No, you knew nothing, dog that you are, but I think that you hoped
much, for you believed that to save himself this white lord would
desert me who am lame, as you did, and that I should be speared. Well,
I can read stars better than you, and I tell you that you will die
before I shall and that what you lose I shall gain. Do you understand
me?--you who hope to be Chief of the Dabanda and Lord of the Lake with
its Treasure, as I learned before ever I set eyes on you."</p>

<p>How had he learned this? I wondered. At the moment I could not
guess, but it was quite obvious to me, watching him, that Kaneke
understood these dark words better than I did, for their effect upon
him was remarkable. First he turned pale, or rather a kind of dirty
white, as though with fear, a mood that was followed at once by one of
fury. His big eyes rolled, foam appeared at the corners of his mouth,
the hair of his face seemed to bristle.</p>

<p>"I know you," he cried, pointing to Arkle, "and why you have come
here. Long ago my spirit warned me concerning you and your purpose. You
hope to rob me again, as once you robbed me in the past, though that
you have forgotten. For this reason I bribed the white hunter
Macumazahn to accompany me here, knowing that without his help I was
doomed to perish. But Fate has played me an evil trick. It was revealed
to me that I should reach the land before you and be ready to make an
end of you; revealed falsely, for while I tarried you came--you, the
white thief. Still there is time. Never again shall you look upon the
Treasure of the Lake."</p>

<p>As he hissed out these last words, suddenly Kaneke drew knife, a
hideous curved knife of the Somali sort, and sprang at Arkle. He sprang
swiftly as a lion on a drinking buck, and it flashed through my mind
that all was over. Standing at a little distance with Hans, I could do
nothing; there was no time, not even to draw a pistol; nothing except
watch the end. It came, but in a strange fashion.</p>

<p>Arkle must have been waiting and ready. He did not move; he only
stretched out his arms. Next instant, with his left hand he gripped the
right arm of Kaneke, which was raised for the blow, and twisted it with
such a grasp of iron that the knife fell to the ground. With his right
he seized him by the throat and shook him as a mongoose shakes a snake.
Then, putting out all his strength which in truth was that of a bull,
Arkle loosed Kaneke's throat, gripped him in his arms, lifted him from
his feet, and hurled him away so that he fell to the rocky ground,
striking it with his back, and lay there senseless.</p>

<p>At this moment a little withered, keen-eyed man whom I had never
seen before appeared from round a corner and, running across the open
space to Arkle, whispered rapidly into his ear after the fashion of one
who gives instructions. For quite a long time, or so it seemed to me,
he whispered thus, while now and again Arkle nodded, showing that he
understood the meaning of what he heard. At last the old fellow uttered
a warning exclamation and pointed to Kaneke who, I saw, was recovering
from his swoon. Then he ran back across the open space towards the
corner of the cleft whence he had appeared, and for a minute I lost
sight of him in its shadow.</p>

<p>Arkle picked up the knife, and, springing forward, set his foot upon
the breast of Kaneke, who was trying to rise.</p>

<p>"Now, dog," he said, "shall I treat you as you would have treated
me? I think it would be wisest. Or will you swear an oath?"</p>

<p>"I will swear," muttered Kaneke, fixing his eyes upon the knife.</p>

<p>"Good. Kneel before me."</p>

<p>Kaneke scrambled stiffly to his knees, and at this moment Hans
nudged me and pointed. I looked and saw that from the corner of the
cleft where the old man had vanished on the farther side of the open
space, were advancing a number of the Dabanda, led, I think, by some of
our bearers who no doubt had summoned them. They were tall, big-eyed
men of the same type as Kaneke and the Abanda who had attacked us; by
no means naked savages, however, as every one of them wore a long
garment, apparently of linen, for the most part white in colour, though
in some instances these robes had been dyed blue.</p>

<p>"Keep your rifle ready," I said to Hans, and waited
developments.</p>

<p>If these men had meant to attack us--which I do not think--the
strange sight before them caused them to abandon the idea, for all
their attention seemed to be concentrated upon Kaneke kneeling at the
white man's feet.</p>

<p>Arkle saw them also and called out in his big, booming voice:</p>

<p>"Welcome, Kumpana, and you, men of the Dabanda, guardians of the
Treasure of the Lake. You come in a good hour. Listen now, while this
Kaneke who I hear is a great one among you swears an oath of allegiance
to me, the white wanderer from beyond the seas. Learn that but now he
tried to murder me, springing at me with this knife to take me unaware,
and that I overthrew him and spared his life. I say listen to the
oath--and do you, O Snake Kaneke, repeat in a loud voice the words that
I shall speak, so that all may hear them and make them known to the
people of the Dabanda, the guardians of the Treasure of the Lake.
Repeat them, I say, for if you refuse, you die."</p>

<p>Then he began thus, doubtless as Kumpana had taught him, and
sentence by sentence Kaneke echoed his words:</p>

<p>"I, Kaneke, of the people of the Dabanda, tried teacherously to
murder you, the white man from beyond the seas, but, being strong, you
overcame me and gave me my life. Therefore I, Kaneke, bow myself to you
henceforth, as your servant. All my rights and place among the Dabanda
I give over to you<i>.</i> Where I stood, there you stand; henceforward
my blood is in your body and all that comes to me with this blood is
yours. So I swear by the Engoi, the Shadow that rests upon the holy
lake, and if I break the oath in word or deed, may the curse of the
Engoi fall upon me."</p>

<p>All of this Kaneke repeated readily enough until he came to the
words "So I swear by the Engoi", at which he jibbed, and indeed stopped
dead.</p>

<p>"Continue," said Arkle, but he would not.</p>

<p>"As you will," went on Arkle, "but understand that if you refuse,
you die, as a murderer deserves to do," and, bending down, he seized
Kaneke by the hair with his left hand, preparing to cut off his head
with the curved Somali knife.</p>

<p>Now Kaneke, evidently in a great fright, appealed to me.</p>

<p>"O Lord Macumazahn," he cried, "save my life, I pray you!"</p>

<p>"Why should I?" I answered. "Just now you deserted me and my people,
so that my two brave hunters are dead. Had you with the bearers stayed
behind to fight with us, I think that they would not have been
dead--but this you can talk over with them in that land whither you are
going. Again, you tried to murder the white lord for reasons which I do
not understand, and after you had sworn to me that you would not harm
him. By his strength he overthrew you, and now your life is justly
forfeit to him. Yet out of the greatness of his heart he offers to
spare you if you will swear a certain oath to him upon a certain name.
You refuse to swear that oath upon that name. So what more is there to
be said?"</p>

<p>By this time, although he had not seen them, for his back was
towards them and they remained silent, watching these proceedings with
a kind of fascinated stare, evidently Kaneke remembered that Arkle had
addressed some of the Dabanda people, who must therefore be present. To
these he made his next appeal, calling out:</p>

<p>"Help me, O my brothers, you over whom I have been appointed to
rule. Would you see me done to death by this white wanderer who comes
to our land for no good purpose? Help me, O Guardians of the Holy Lake
and of the Shadow that rests upon the lake."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Arkle. "Come forward, you Dabanda, laying down your
spears, for know that he who first lifts a spear shall be dealt with by
the Lord Macumazahn. Come forward, I say, and judge between me and this
man."</p>

<p>To my astonishment those Dabanda obeyed. They laid down their
spears, every one of them, and advanced to within a few paces of us,
led by the little withered old man with keen eyes, who moved as lightly
and silently as does a cat, the same man who had whispered into Arkle's
ear. Arkle looked at this man and said:</p>

<p>"Greeting, Kumpana, my friend and guide. I thank you for the counsel
you gave to me but now, for I know you to be wise and great among your
people and it was you who taught me all that I have learned of them and
of this Kaneke. Judge now between me and him. You have heard the story.
According to your custom, is not this man's life forfeit to me whom he
strove to murder?"</p>

<p>"It is forfeit," answered Kumpana, "unless he buys it back with the
oath which you have demanded of him."</p>

<p>"And if he swears that oath, must he not, under it, become my
servant and give to me his place, his power, and his rights among the
Dabanda?"</p>

<p>"That is so, White Lord."</p>

<p>"And if he swears it and breaks the oath, what then, Kumpana?"</p>

<p>"Then, Lord, you can loose upon him the curse of the Engoi, and it
will surely be fulfilled. Is it not so, Dabanda?"</p>

<p>"It is so," they assented.</p>

<p>"You have heard, Kaneke; yes, out of the lips of your own people you
have learned their law. Choose now. Will you swear, or will you
die?"</p>

<p>"I swear," said Kaneke hoarsely, as the sharp knife--his
own--approached his neck. "I swear," and slowly he repeated those words
which before he had refused to speak, transferring all his rights and
privileges to Arkle and calling down upon his own head the curse of the
Engoi if he should break the oath. I noticed that as he invoked this
fate upon himself, the man shivered, and reflected that after all there
might be something in the curse of the Engoi, or that he believed there
was. Indeed, sceptical as I am, I began to feel that all this queer
story had more in it than I had hitherto imagined, and that I was
coming to the heart of one of those Central African mysteries of which
most white men only learn in the vaguest fashion, perhaps from
prejudiced and unsympathetic sources, and then often enough but by
obscure hints and symbolical fables.</p>

<p>The oath finished, Kaneke kissed the white man's foot, which I
suppose was part of the ceremony, and strove to rise. But forcing him
to his knees again, Arkle addressed the little withered old man who
stood watching all.</p>

<p>"Tell me," he said, "who and what are you, Kumpana?"</p>

<p>"Lord, though I until now have hid it from you, I am the head of the
Council of the Shadow, he who rules in this land when the Shadow has
passed from the world and before she returns again."</p>

<p>"Are you then he who weds the Shadow, Kumpana?"</p>

<p>"Nay, Lord. He who is called Shield of the Shadow dies when the
Shadow passes. I am but a minister, an executor of decrees. As such I
led you to this land, whence you were hunted because you would not be
obedient, but broke the law. Mighty must be the strength that guards
you, or by now you would be dead."</p>

<p>"If I have erred, O Kumpana, I have paid the price of error. Am I,
then, forgiven?"</p>

<p>"Lord, I think that you are forgiven, as this Kaneke, who also erred
in his youth in a worse fashion, was forgiven, or rather," he added,
correcting himself, "suffered to go unpunished."</p>

<p>"Who and what is Kaneke?" Arkle asked again.</p>

<p>"Kaneke is he who was destined to be the Shield of the Shadow when
she appears to rule for her appointed day. For his sin against the
Engoi he was driven from the land and lived far off, where the white
lord who is called Watcher-by-Night found him. At the proper time he
was ordered back that his fate might be fulfilled, and returned
bringing the white lord, Watcher-by-Night, with him, as also was
decreed. The rest you know."</p>

<p>"Kaneke tried to murder me and bought his life by a certain oath,
selling to me his place and rights. Shall I then be known and named
Shield of the Shadow in place of this Kaneke?"</p>

<p>"It would seem so, Lord," answered Kumpana, a little doubtfully as I
thought. "But first the matter must be submitted to the Council of the
Shadow, of which I am only one. It may be," he added after a pause,
"that the Council will call upon you to buy the Shadow at a great
price."</p>

<p>Then I, Allan, took up my parable, saying:</p>

<p>"Kumpana and men of the Dabanda, I, a white hunter, have been led,
or trapped, into a land that is full of mysteries which as yet I do not
understand. I have rescued this white lord when he was about to be
killed. I have brought him here, fighting my way through warriors who
seemed to be your enemies. In so doing I have lost two servants of
mine, brave men whom I loved, who came to their deaths by the treachery
of yonder Kaneke and therefore my heart is sore. He deserted us, hoping
that in like fashion I should desert the other white lord who is lame,
that thereby I might save my life. I did not desert him, and you have
seen the end of that story. Now we are all weary, and sad because of
the death of the two hunters who sacrificed themselves for us; hungry
also, needing food and rest and sleep. The white lord whom you name
Wanderer has made his bargain with you, a strange bargain which
bewilders me. I would make mine, which is simpler. If I and my servant
here, the yellow man, come on into your country, have we peace? Do you
swear by the Engoi, who seems to be your goddess, and by the Shadow her
priestess, that no harm shall come to us and that when I desire it in
the future, I shall be helped to leave your country again, you giving
me all that I may need for my journey? If you do not swear, then I turn
and go back whence I came, if Heaven permits me to do so."</p>

<p>Kumpana spoke with some of his companions. Then he said:</p>

<p>"O Macumazahn, Watcher-by-Night, we swear these things to you by the
Engoi. At least we swear that after you have finished the service, to
work which we caused you to be brought hither, then you shall be sent
hence in safety as you demand."</p>

<p>I reflected to myself that this promise was vague and qualified. Yet
remembering that I should certainly extract none more favourable and
being thoroughly worn out and quite unfit to face the Abanda who
probably were waiting outside, I accepted it for what it was worth, and
requested Kumpana to lead us to where we could eat and rest in
safety.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<center>
<h1><a name="c013">CHAPTER XIII</a></h1>

<br>


<h1>BEFORE THE ALTAR</h1>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>By the time that we emerged from the pass, that really was nothing
but a cleft or crack zig-zagging through the lava rock of the volcano's
lips, which we did in complete safety, seeing no more of the Abanda, it
was drawing towards evening and the plain beneath us was flooded with
the light of the westering sun. It was a very wonderful plain, though,
except for its size, of a sort not uncommon in the immense wilds of
Africa. Looking at it stretching away for miles and miles, it was
difficult to realize that it was nothing but the crater of some huge
volcano, or group of volcanoes, which millions of years ago had been a
lake of seething fire. Yet undoubtedly this was the case, for all round
ran the precipice of rock that once had formed the wall of the outer
crater. Now this wall enclosed a vast expanse of fertile land that
sloped gently down to the confines of a forest.</p>

<p>Nor was that all, for from this height we could see that within the
ring of forest, at the bottom of the crater-pit as it were, lay a great
sheet of water, the holy lake that was named Mone. It looked handsome
and terrifying enough at this hour when the tall forest trees that grew
around cut off from its surface the light of the sinking sun, such a
place as might well be the home of mysteries.</p>

<p>At that time, however, I was too tired to study scenery or indulge
in speculations, and glad enough I felt when we were led to a kind of
rest-house, or perhaps it was a watchman's shelter, that was hidden
away in a grove of mountain palms. This place consisted of a thatched
roof supported upon tree-trunks and enclosed with a fence of what
looked like dried bulrushes, which formed the walls of the house. It
was clean, comfortable, and airy; moreover there must have been a
cooking-place outside, for hot food was brought to us, of which I ate
thankfully, being too exhausted to inquire its nature or whence it
came.</p>

<p>Only one thing did I ask of Kumpana--whether it was necessary to set
a guard. When he assured me that we were absolutely safe, I took him at
his word and went to sleep, hoping for the best. I remember reflecting
as my eyes closed that for some reason or other, humble individual as I
was, I seemed too valuable to these people for them to wish to make
away with me. So having ascertained that Kaneke was elsewhere, I just
turned in and slept like a dog that has hunted all day, and I believe
that Arkle did likewise.</p>

<p>When I woke the sun was high and Arkle had gone. I asked Hans what
had become of him, saying that I feared foul play.</p>

<p>"Oh no, Baas," answered Hans. "You see that Baas Red-Bull, having
conquered Kaneke, and bought his birthright from him in exchange for
not sticking him like a pig--just like the man in the Bible, Baas--is
now a great chief. So because he is lame those Dabanda brought a litter
in which they set him and have carried him off. He told me to tell you
that he did not wake you up because you were so tired, but that you
would meet again at their head place, which is called Dabanda-town,
Baas. Meanwhile you were to fear nothing."</p>

<p>"Which means that he has deserted us," I said.</p>

<p>"Oh no, Baas, I think not; I think he went because he was obliged,
and that we shall find him later on. You see, Baas, the Baas Red-Bull
has become a priest and a chief, and such people are never their own
masters. They seem to rule spirits and men, but really these rule them
and order them about as they like. For the rest, Kumpana stays here to
guard us, and breakfast is coming, so let us eat and be happy while we
may, Baas."</p>

<p>The advice was good and I acted upon it at once. After a wash at the
spring by which the rest-house was built, I ate an excellent breakfast,
a stew of kid's flesh with quails in it, I remember it was, made
memorable by the fact that after it Hans produced a skin bag full of
excellent tobacco. On inquiry it appeared that the Dabanda grew this
herb, and what is more, smoked it in cigarettes made of the soft sheath
which covers the mealie cobs. Also, like the Bantu, they took it in the
form of snuff.</p>

<p>By the way, what an interesting study would be that of the history
of tobacco in Africa. Is it indigenous there, or was it perhaps
introduced from some other land by the Arabs, or later by the
Portuguese? I don't know, but I remember how delighted I was to see it
upon this occasion, when ours was exhausted and the spare supply a
bearer carried in a box was discovered to have got wet in crossing a
river and to be nothing but a mass of stinking mould. Some people
inveigh against the use of tobacco, but to my mind it is one of the
best gifts that Heaven has given to man.</p>

<p>Just as I had lit my pipe with delight and was testing the sample,
which proved to be sweet and cool though rather strong, Kumpana arrived
and asked if I was ready to start. I said yes, and off we went with a
guard of ten Dabandas, marching downhill in the direction of the
forest.</p>

<p>Now I saw that this vast crater was a wondrous and a most beautiful
place, though it is true that its climate is hot. For the most part it
was lightly timbered with large trees, a species of mahogany, many of
them, mixed with cedars, growing in groups or singly, and interspersed
with grassy glades after the fashion of some enormous park. Among these
trees wandered great quantities of game; thus I saw eland, koodoo,
sable-antelope of a very large variety, and blue wildebeest, to mention
a few of them, also bush-buck of a bigger kind than I had ever found
anywhere in Africa.</p>

<p>It seemed, however, that the elephant and the rhinoceros did not
live here; nor, strange to say, were there any lions, which perhaps
accounted for the great number of the various species of buck. The
birds, too, were numerous and beautiful; and everywhere I noted lovely
butterflies, some of which, of a brilliant blue colour, were of great
size and flew high and as fast as swallows. In short, so far as its
natural conditions were concerned, after the arid plains beyond the
mountains, the place was a kind of earthly paradise; well watered,
also, by little streams that came from springs and ran down fern-clad
ravines towards the lake.</p>

<p>As we went I talked with Kumpana, who, outwardly at any rate, proved
to be a most agreeable and candid old gentleman. From him I gathered
much information, true or false. Thus I learned that his people were
really star-worshippers, as were the Abanda who lived without the
mountain, and knew a good deal of crude astronomy.</p>

<p>It seemed that originally the Abanda and the Dabanda were one race,
but that "thousands of years ago", as he put it, they were ruled by two
brothers, twins, who quarrelled. Then ensued a civil war, in the course
of which one brother murdered the other treacherously. This angered the
Engoi of that day, whom both of them aspired to wed; indeed, this was
the cause of their difference. She called down the curse of heaven upon
the murderer and those who clung to him, divorcing them from her
worship and causing them to be driven (whether by force of arms or by
supernatural means, I could not discover) out of the earthly paradise
of the crater on to the mountain slopes and plains beyond.</p>

<p>From that time forward, Kumpana explained, the Abanda had sought
reunion with the goddess, both because of the material benefits they
believed to be in her gift, such as rain and plenty, and for some
spiritual reason that had to do with the fate of their souls after
death. This, however, they had never achieved, since the curse upon
them continued from age to age. Indeed, the prophecy was that their
desire could not be fulfilled until a high priest of the Engoi, the
husband or the affianced of the Shadow, she who was also called "the
Treasure of the Lake" came to lead them back into the land of the
Dabanda and made peace between them and the Engoi incarnate in the
priestess known from generation to generation by the name of "Shadow",
who, from birth till death, dwelt on the island in the holy Lake Mone.
Until that hour, went on Kumpana, none of the Abanda dared to attempt
to re-enter Mone-land, as the country encircled by the crater's walls
was called.</p>

<p>"Why not, if they are so brave and numerous?" I asked,
astonished.</p>

<p>"Because, Lord, if they did the curse would fall upon them and they
would perish miserably, I know not how. At least, so they believe, as
we do; and it is for this reason that from the moment you entered the
pass of the cliff yesterday, you were safe. Had it been otherwise the
Abanda would have followed you and killed you in the pass, for they
were many and you were few. For this reason, too, we do not so much as
guard that path and certain others."</p>

<p>Hearing this I reflected, first that I liked not the security. For
what was the sum of it? That a vast horde of savages, or semi-savages,
who believed themselves to have been driven out of a kind of Garden of
Eden by the flaming sword of a heavenly curse, although they were much
more numerous and stronger than those who still dwelt in the Garden,
and although the gates of that garden stood open, dared not enter them
because they were sure that if they did so, the invisible sword of the
curse that always hung over them would smite and destroy them.</p>

<p>Still, there seemed to be truth in the story, for otherwise why were
we not followed into the unguarded cleft? Doubtless the Abanda were
frightened of our firearms, but seeing that we were but three men
against hundreds, this was not enough to have held them back. No, the
mighty hand which restrained them must, as Kumpana declared, have been
that of spiritual fear.</p>

<p>Oh, what a force is superstition; as I sometimes think, the greatest
in the whole world, or at any rate in Africa. So mighty is it that when
I contemplate its amazing power, at times I wonder whether in many of
its developments it is not rooted deep in the soil of unappreciated and
unknown truths.</p>

<p>Of these reflections of mine, however, I said nothing to my
companion, because I thought it wiser to be silent. Yet I did ask
him--if he felt at liberty to tell me and had the necessary
knowledge--what part I and Arkle, whom he called "The Wanderer", had in
all this business.</p>

<p>To my astonishment, instead of refusing to answer the question or
thrusting it aside as natives can, he replied quite frankly that he did
not know, or at any rate knew very little.</p>

<p>"The stars guide us, Lord," he said. "We consult them, as our
fathers have done from the beginning; we read their messages and obey
their commands. Long ago the stars told us, speaking through the mouth
of her who is named Shadow, not she who rules today, but she who went
before her and has been gathered to the heavens, that in this year a
great war would fall upon us--we do not know what war. More recently we
were told, through the mouth of that Shadow who has faded, to call back
Kaneke from the land where he dwelt because of his crime against her,
that he might bring with him a certain white man whose name was your
name, namely Watcher-by-Night. This command was sent to Kaneke and he
obeyed it, as he must do or die; for if he disobeyed, the messenger was
commanded to bring death upon him, as she was commanded, if he obeyed,
to protect him from all dangers. That is all we know of the reason of
your coming, though now I see that if you had not come the other white
lord would have been killed."</p>

<p>Reflecting that this tale about myself was, with variations, much
the same as that told by Kaneke, something real enough to these people,
but to me a mystery, and wondering if by any chance this fate-dealing
messenger was White-Mouse, I left the subject and attacked one of more
immediate interest, namely that of Arkle, saying outright:</p>

<p>"The white lord Wanderer told me that you, Kumpana, met him beyond
the country of the Abanda and guided him into your own land. Why did
you do this?"</p>

<p>Kumpana's face changed; it was as though a veil fell over his eyes
and mild, intelligent features, a veil of secrecy.</p>

<p>"Lord," he answered, "there are matters of which it is scarcely
lawful that I should speak, even to you who have come here to be our
friend. I would have you understand that we Dabanda are not as other
folk. We are a small people and an ancient who live by wisdom, not by
strength, and this wisdom comes to us from heaven. We worship the
stars, or rather the Strength beyond the stars, and from them come
spirits who teach us through the mouth of the Lake-Dweller, Shadow, or
otherwise, much that is not known even to the wise of the earth, such
as yourself, Lord. They give us gifts of vision also, so that at times
we can see into the darkness of the past, and even look beneath its
curtain into the light of the future that blinds the eyes of other
men.</p>

<p>"Moreover we, or some of us, have certain powers over Nature. Death
indeed we must suffer like all who live. Yet we know that it is not
death; that it is but a door of darkness through which we pass to
another house of flesh, a better or a worse house according to our
deserts, that is yet inhabited by the same spirit. So, too, we have
strength over beasts" (here I bethought me of Kaneke and the
elephants), "which we can cause to obey us as though they were our
dogs. You smile. Then, look upon those buck," and he pointed to a bunch
of blue wildebeests, which I have always found wild and savage
creatures, that were staring at us from among some trees about a
hundred and fifty yards away. "Now I will call them, that you may
believe."</p>

<p>Well, stepping a few paces to my right, call them he did, uttering
cries in a kind of sing-song voice. The wildebeests seemed to listen.
Then presently they moved slowly towards us, and soon were standing
within a few yards of Kumpana, as cows might do that are waiting to be
milked. There they stood, patient and submissive, until they caught my
wind, when they snorted, whisked their tails, put down their heads and,
to my great alarm, prepared to charge me. Just as Hans and I were about
to fire to keep them off, Kumpana said something and waved his hands,
as a beast-tamer does to his performing animals, whereon those gnus
turned and gambolled off in their well-known lumbering fashion.</p>

<p>"They are no wildebeests, Baas," whispered Hans to me. "Like the
elephants, they are men wearing the shape of brutes."</p>

<p>"Perhaps," I answered, for I was too mystified to argue; also
Kumpana was speaking again, saying:</p>

<p>"Now mayhap you will believe me when I tell you that we have power
over the animals, who are as our brothers and not to be harmed by us;
so much power that we have driven those of them that can hurt men, such
as lions, from our land; yes, and evil reptiles also. Search where you
will here, Lord, you will find no snakes," a statement which caused me
to reflect that St. Patrick must have bequeathed his mantle to the
Dabanda. "Thus, too," he went on, "we control sicknesses, summon rain,
and hold off tempests, which is why we are reported to be a people of
wizards."</p>

<p>"If so," I replied, "all this does not tell me why the white man
Wanderer was guided by you and why afterwards he was driven away, as it
seemed, to death."</p>

<p>"I guided him, Macumazahn, because I was so commanded, and because
he is appointed to play a great part in our history, as once before he
did in the past. He was driven away because he was disobedient and
suffered folly to master him, for which causes he must be punished and
learn the taste of terror. Ask me no more concerning this lord, for I
cannot answer you. Yet it may happen that before all is done you will
learn the answer for yourself."</p>

<p>Now I proposed, in my thirst for information, to put some questions
to him concerning the wondrous woman, or sacred personage who was said
to dwell in the lake, and who, as I suspected, was an African version
of the old legend of the Water-Spirit which is to be found in many
lands. But when I mentioned her name of Shadow, Kumpana turned upon me
with so fierce a look in his eyes, hitherto mild enough, that I grew
silent.</p>

<p>"Lord Macumazahn," he said, "I see that you do not believe in our
priestess, the Shadow of the Engoi whom we worship. Though you have
never said so to me, it is written on your face. That is to be
understood, for white men, I have heard, can be very ignorant and
scornful of faiths that are not their own. Yet I pray you do not make a
mock of her to me, as I am sure you were about to do. I have answered
all your other questions as best I might, but as to her I answer none.
Nay, of her you must learn for yourself"; and before I could reply or
explain, he departed to join the guard, leaving me alone with Hans.</p>

<p>"Baas," said that worthy, "you are always seeking new adventures and
strange peoples, and this time I think you have found both. These folk
are all wizards, Baas, like Kaneke, and we are caught in their web,
where I expect they will suck us dry. I think the Baas Red-Bull is a
wizard also, for otherwise why was he not killed; and unless he is one
of their brothers, why are these Dabandas so glad to see him? Also, how
did he learn so quickly all that oath which he made Kaneke swear? Then
there was White-Mouse who, I am sure, was a witch, though a very pretty
one, for otherwise how could she have deceived <i>me,</i> Hans, as she
did, making me believe all sorts of things that were not true, such as
that she was a jealous wife of Kaneke who liked me for myself? Oh, we
have come into a land of spells where the fierce wildebeests are as
dogs and the passes are held by ghosts, and I do not think we shall
ever get out of it alive, Baas, unless indeed, for their sport they
turn us into animals, like elephants and the wildebeests and hunt us
hence."</p>

<p>Now I remembered that Tom and Jerry had talked in this fashion, with
good reason in their case; and looked at Hans doubtfully, fearing lest
he might have caught the infection. However, this was not so, for as is
common with primitive men of mercurial nature, suddenly his mood
changed, and, grinning, he said:</p>

<p>"Yet, Baas, though White-Mouse did blind me for a little while,
these wizards will have to be very clever if they hope to deceive Hans,
who is such a good Christian that he can defy the devil and who,
moreover, has the reverend predicant, your father, for his friend and
guide. Cheer up, Baas, for I think I shall bring you through safely, if
only you will be guided by me and not let that Shadow woman make a fool
of you, as White-Mouse did. Yes, yes, everything may still be well, and
after all, perhaps those wildebeests were just tame buck like some that
the Scotchman kept on his farm near Durban which used to come and feed
out of his hand."</p>

<p>"Yes," I said, "no doubt they were tame, and I don't believe in the
magic. Still, I should like to know what has become of the Baas
Arkle."</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>Well, we walked on all day through that most lovely land, until
towards evening we came upon patches of cultivated ground and drew near
to the edge of the forest, where I saw that there was a town.</p>

<p>It was a straggling place and quite unprotected; just a number of
neat houses built of whitened clay and thatched with palm-leaves, or in
some cases, having flat roofs of lime cement, standing, each of them,
in a garden of its own on the borders of wide roads or streets. In
short, this Dabanda town had nothing in common with the crowded cities,
if they may be so called, which exist in Nigeria and elsewhere. It was
just a sparsely populated village, such as may be seen by scores in
certain districts of Eastern and Central Africa.</p>

<p>"If this is their big kraal, these Dabanda are but a little people,
Baas," said the observant Hans.</p>

<p>I agreed with him. As I had noted during our march, their
crater-land was wide and most fertile, but until we approached the town
I saw few signs of cultivation. Here and there on the track that ran to
the pass were two or three huts surrounded by gardens. Nor in these
outlying districts were there many domestic animals; they were almost
entirely occupied by wild game. Near the town, however, we did see
herds of cattle of a small breed, also flocks of long-haired goats.
Clearly the Dabanda, so far as numbers were concerned, must have been
but an insignificant tribe, relying for their protection upon moral
forces rather than those of arms, a fact that seemed to bear out some
of Kumpana's statements as to the reason why the passes were left
unfortified.</p>

<p>We entered the main street of the town which began nowhere in
particular, and walked down it without exciting much attention.
Occasionally a woman stared at us from the door-way of her house, or an
old man stopped his work in a garden to see who the passers-by might
be. Also from time to time a few grave-faced children, three or four
perhaps, followed us for a little way, then stopped and returned whence
they came. This I thought strange, for they could never before have
seen a white man, except perhaps Arkle. But then everything about the
Dabanda was strange; evidently they were a folk apart, one of whose
characteristics was a lack of curiosity.</p>

<p>To tell the truth, they gave me the impression of people living in a
dream, or under a spell, human in form and mind, yet lacking some of
the human attributes; lotus-eaters who felt no need for energy or
effort, because Nature fed them and they were, or considered themselves
to be, god-guarded. Such was my first impression of these Dabanda,
which in the main was confirmed by what I saw and learned of them in
after days. I should add that they were all extremely good-looking, men
and women together, but very like one another, as though from continual
in-breeding; remarkable, too, for their fine-cut features,
light-coloured skin like to that of half-castes or Persians, straight
hair and large, sleepy, owl-like eyes, of which I observed the pupils
seemed to grow bigger after nightfall, as do those of certain animals
that seek their food by night.</p>

<p>The long, wide street ended in an open area that for want of a
better name I will call a market-place, where the ground was levelled
and trodden hard. At intervals round half this area stood houses of a
larger size than those that we had passed, occupied, as I guessed
rightly, by the chief men of the tribe, with their wives and children,
if they had any. The other half of the area was bounded by a dense
forest formed of tall and solemn trees, which forest ran down to the
borders of the lake that, as I had judged from my view of it from the
higher land, lay at a distance of several miles from the town. In the
centre of this open space stood three curious erections; two pointed
towers of rough stone, fifty or sixty feet high perhaps, with spiral
stairways winding round them to their tops, and between these a large
platform twenty feet or so in height, that looked like the base of an
uncompleted pyramid, on which platform burned a fire.</p>

<p>"What are those, Baas?" asked Hans.</p>

<p>"Watch-towers," I answered.</p>

<p>"What is the good of towers whence one can see nothing except the
sky?" asked Hans again.</p>

<p>Then I guessed their real object. They were observatories, and the
truncated pyramid was a great altar where priests gathered and offered
sacrifices. Of this I had little doubt, though I wondered what they
sacrificed.</p>

<p>At the moment I had no time to make further observations, for just
then we reached a house where Kumpana, who had rejoined us on the
outskirts of the town, informed me I was to lodge. Though flat-roofed
and somewhat larger than the rest, except one adjoining which I took to
be that of the chief, like the others it was situated in a garden and
had a veranda, from which a door-way led into the building. It
consisted of one big, white-washed room, without windows. Such light as
there was came through the open door-way, over which a mat was hung, to
be used at night, for there was no door. Like the passes, the houses
were undefended against attack or thieves; indeed I learned afterwards
that such a crime as theft was quite unknown in Mone-land.</p>

<p>In this room, to my delight, I found all our goods which had been
carried by the Dabanda porters for so many weary marches. There were
the spare rifles, the ammunition, the medicines, the cooking-pots, the
clothes, the beads and cloth for presents--everything; even the
suspicious Hans could not discover that a single article was missing.
While we were checking them, food that had been prepared in a cook-hut
in the garden at the back of the house, was brought to us by a decently
clothed old woman, who seemed to accept our presence without curiosity,
also earthenware jars full of water and a tub burnt out of a block of
wood in which to wash. This we did on the veranda, for the surrounding
fence made the place quite private, and afterwards sat ourselves upon
wooden stools which we found in the room, and ate a good meal.</p>

<p>By the time we had finished our food it was dark, and the old woman
appeared again carrying two lighted earthenware lamps of an elegant
boat-shaped pattern, filled with some kind of sweet-smelling vegetable
oil in which floated wicks made of pith or fibre.</p>

<p>As there seemed nothing else to do and no one came near us, I began
to take off my clothes in order to turn in upon one of the very
comfortable-looking wooden bedsteads that had been provided for us.
This bedstead was of the kind that is common in Eastern Africa, having
a cartel, as the Boers call it, strung with green hide and a mattress
stiffed with dried grasses that gave a scent of hay. Already my boots
were off when Kumpana appeared and said that he had come to conduct us
to a ceremony where we should see the other white lord who was called
Wanderer. This being what I most desired, I put them on again in a
hurry and away we went.</p>

<p>Kumpana led us to the market- or gathering-place that I have
described. Here we found what I suppose was the entire adult population
of the town, seated on the ground in front of the truncated pyramid of
which I have spoken, the men upon one side and the women upon the
other, as they might be in some high churches. They were very quiet and
orderly and for the most part engaged in smoking their native
cigarettes. We were conducted along a broad passage which was left
between the men and the women, to the foot of the pyramid and up some
twenty rough steps to the platform that proved to be quite a large
place.</p>

<p>Here in front of a low altar, a primitive erection about twelve feet
square built of blocks of black lava, upon which altar burned the fire
that I have mentioned, stood three white-robed men facing the fire,
whom I took to be priests, for their heads were shaved and they seemed
to be engaged in prayer. To the right of this altar, seated on a stool
and clothed in a white robe like a Dabanda, was none other than Arkle,
who, I am bound to say, so far as the firelight revealed him to me,
looked very imposing in this costume. Opposite to him, also clad in
white and seated on a stool, was his enemy Kaneke. Very fierce and
sullen did he appear as he glowed at Arkle with his great, round eyes.
I noted at once that he was guarded, probably to prevent him from
making another attack upon his rival, for behind him stood three tall
men armed with spears.</p>

<p>A second stool was set by that of Arkle and to this I was conducted,
Hans, who seemed rather uncomfortable and kept his hand upon the hilt
of his revolver, being directed to stand behind me. Then Kumpana left
us and took up a position facing the audience midway between Arkle and
Kaneke, with his back to the altar and the priests. Here he stood
silent; indeed, everyone was silent, and when I tried to whisper
something to Arkle, he shook his head and laid his finger on his
lips.</p>

<p>Very impressive was that silence. Never shall I forget the scene as
I saw it by the light of the young moon which changed its quarter that
day, and of the bright stars burning in the deep-blue sky. Not a breath
of air was stirring. To my left the great trees of the forest stood
motionless in endless rows. To my right were the dim grey roofs of the
town, and between them the crouching audience of robed Dabandas,
looking few and small upon that wide expanse, the glowing tips of their
cigarettes marking the ordered lines in which they sat, like men and
women stricken with dumbness. Then, within a few paces, the primeval
altar upon which even the fire seemed to be subject to the general
spell, for it burned brightly without a sound, and the three shaven
priests bowing and waving their hands, but uttering no word.</p>

<p>I felt like one under a charm, which was not strange; for so deep
was this quiet that when I shifted my foot, causing the nails in my
boot to grate upon the stone platform, the noise seemed quite loud, so
loud that all turned their heads and looked at me as though I had done
something outrageous and indecorous. This went on for quite a long
time, till at length I felt an hysterical desire to rise and make a
speech, just to show that I was still alive. Indeed, I think that very
soon our strained nerves would have caused either Hans or me to commit
some indiscretion involving sound, when suddenly the chain of silence
was broken by a melodious voice above us.</p>

<p>I stared to see whence it came, and for the first time observed that
on the top of each of the tall columns which rose in front of the
platform stood a white-robed figure, evidently engaged in observing the
stars. Instantly the chanting voice on the right-hand column was
answered by a similar voice upon the left-hand column. Then both of
them sang something in unison, something sweet and solemn, though what
it meant I could not understand, and as they sang, pointed with wands
they held upwards to the heavens.</p>

<p>At this signal all present seemed to come to life, as in the story
did the Sleeping Beauty and her court at the kiss of the Fairy Prince.
The audience or congregation below us began to talk with some
eagerness, men calling across the passage to women, and <i>vice
versa.</i> Evidently they were discussing the message conveyed to them
in the chant of the astrologers on the towers, telling them, I suppose,
what those astrologers had read in the stars. In the same way the three
priests, ceasing from dumb show, broke into open prayer, which again I
could not understand, because the language was probably archaic. At any
rate it differed so much from the dialect of Arabic used by these
people that I could only distinguish one word, "Engoi", which was their
name for the Divine.</p>

<p>Encouraged by this change of demeanour, I asked Arkle in English
what it all meant and what he was doing there dressed up like a
Dabanda.</p>

<p>"You forget, Quatermain," he answered, "that I have become a chief
or a priest, or both, by virtue of what happened yesterday between me
and the gentleman opposite. At least, I fill these offices on
probation, for my true position is about to be settled at this meeting.
For the rest, those men on the towers have been reading omens in the
stars, though exactly what they read I cannot tell you. Now I think
that they are about to make prayers or offerings to the planet Venus,
which you can see blazing away up there near the moon, after which my
case will be tried."</p>

<p>He was right. Having thrown something on to the fire, what it was I
could not see, the three priests turned so as to face the congregation
below and, pointing to Venus, began a hymn in which the whole audience
joined, also pointing at the planet with their right hands. Even the
astrologers on the towers pointed with their wands and took part in
this chant, which was really very fine and moving, a great volume of
rhythmical sound.</p>

<p>Presently Kumpana, who now stood in front of the three priests,
acting apparently as a master of ceremonies, waved his arms, whereon
the song ceased with a crash of sound. In the silence that ensued he
began to speak, but so rapidly that I could make out very little of
what he said. He may have been reciting ritual, as was suggested by the
strange words and forms he used. Or perhaps he was repeating passages
from ancient history. At length his address became less impetuous. He
spoke more slowly, and in language that was easier to understand, so
that I had no difficulty in discovering that he was telling the story
of what had happened between Arkle and Kaneke in the pass; of the
attempted assassination of Arkle, of the overthrow of Kaneke, and of
the oath that he had sworn to the victor. Finally he said:</p>

<p>"The stars, having been consulted by those who can read them,
declare that Kaneke, who by the choice of that chief who went before
him, was appointed to follow him as Chief of the Dabanda, the Holy
People of the Lake and the Guardian of the Treasure of the Lake, and,
after long punishment and exile, was named to be the Lord and Shield of
the Shadow, is rejected from his place and stripped of his offices.
They declare also that the stranger, who in this land is named
Wanderer, he whom Kaneke tried to murder and to whom he swore the oath
of submission and fidelity, giving up to him all rights and power in
exchange for life, henceforward stands where Kaneke stood. Do you, O
People of the Dabanda, to whom is revealed the secret mystery of the
stranger that for ages has been hidden, accept the decree of the stars
and depose Kaneke, setting up in his place the white lord, his
conqueror?"</p>

<p>"We do," answered the audience, with such singular unanimity that I
guessed all this scene to be formal and arranged.</p>

<p>"Kaneke," cried Kumpana, "you have heard the decrees of the stars
and of the Holy People confirming your own oath. Do you obey?"</p>

<p>Now Kaneke sprang to his feet and answered in a great voice that
seemed alive with rage:</p>

<p>"I do not obey. What I swore was to save my life and such oaths are
binding upon no man. As for the decrees of the stars and of the people
of the Dabanda, these are but tricks. I, too, am a master of the stars,
and I read their writing otherwise, while the people are in the hands
of the priests, who in their turn are in the hands of Kumpana and the
Council who plot against me. The sin that I sinned in my youth against
the Shadow, who has passed back to the Light which cast it, is purged
by punishment. Moreover, was it half as great as that of this white
thief, whom most justly I would have killed, he who, as I have heard,
strove to do violence to the Treasure of the Lake, and for that cause
was hunted from the land? But let that matter be. Who is this foreign
man that you name Wanderer? What does he in our country? I know what
the magicians declare, namely that, like myself, he is one long dead
who has returned again; that he is the very king who fought with his
brother to win the Treasure of the Lake, and drove his brother and
those who clung to him over the mountain edge, where they became exiles
and the fathers of the people of the Abanda. Yes, that king who, being
wed to the Treasure of the Lake, was so beloved of her that when she
knew death was near to her, she killed him that he might accompany her
to heaven, a crime for which heaven brought woe upon her.</p>

<p>"So runs the tale, but I say that it is a lie told by the Council of
the Shadow to favour this white wanderer, who has made great promises
to them if they will give the Shadow into his keeping that he may steal
her away, leaving them to rule the land."</p>

<p>This statement, I noticed, seemed to disturb the audience below,
among whom, it appeared afterwards, Kaneke had many friends, members of
his family and others who desired that he should be chief and wed the
Shadow. These stirred impatiently as the meaning of the sacrilege came
home to them and whispered to one another.</p>

<p>"Yes," went on Kaneke, "such is the accursed plot of the white
stranger who is named Wanderer which has been revealed to me, a plot so
wicked that the guardian spirits of the Lake and Forest cast him from
our land that he might die by the spears of the Abanda. Yet he did not
die, because he was saved by the other white man, the Lord Macumazahn
whom I was commanded to lead to our country, doubtless that he might
play his part in the plot and be rewarded of the thief his friend."</p>

<p>Here I remarked in a loud voice to Kaneke that he was a liar as well
as a traitor, for I knew nothing of any plots, but he took no heed of
me and continued:</p>

<p>"Therefore it was that I sought to execute justice upon this
red-bearded lord who had escaped from the Abanda. Yet I was overcome
not by strength, but by evil magic, and swore an oath to save my life
who desired to live on that I might avenge you, the Holy People, upon
him who would rob you of your Treasure and your Oracle."</p>

<p>At this point Arkle intervened in a businesslike and British
fashion.</p>

<p>"You dirty dog!" he said. "You snake who spits poison at me whom you
have failed to reach with your fangs. You traitor who deserted the lord
Watcher-by-Night and brought about the death of his servants, because
you hoped that it would mean my own death also, and afterwards tried to
stab me whom you had sworn not to harm. You oath-breaker. I will not
reason with you as to your falsehoods, but I am ready to fight you
again, here and now and to the death. Yes, weary and lame as I am, I am
ready to fight you under the stars you worship, before their altar and
in the presence of your people and thus let Fate judge between us.
Answer. Will you fight me again?"</p>

<p>"I will not fight you, Red Wanderer, that I may once more be
overcome by magic and butchered," shouted Kaneke. "Nay, I appeal from
you and from your fellow plotters to our Lady, the Voice of the Engoi.
If I am justly judged, if I have spoken what is not true, let her
appear here and now and pass sentence on me with her own lips. Ay,
Kumpana, chief of the Council of the Shadow, summon the Shadow if you
can, and let the people see her and hear her voice."</p>

<p>Thus he spoke in tones of triumph who, as I learned afterwards, knew
well that never in their history had the Lake-dweller who was named
Shadow come from the lake to the town to judge of any matter, and
having spoken, sat himself down and waited.</p>

<p>Then in quiet tones Kumpana answered:</p>

<p>"O Kaneke, I will make prayer to the Shadow. Perchance she may be
pleased to do as you desire, and come hither to give judgment in this
cause in the presence of her people."</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<center>
<h1><a name="c014">CHAPTER XIV</a></h1>

<br>


<h1>SHADOW</h1>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>"Will she come?" I whispered to Arkle.</p>

<p>"Yes, I think so--that is, I hope so," he replied.</p>

<p>Then I guessed it was arranged that on one pretext or another the
holy personage called Shadow or the Lake-Dweller, should make a public
appearance that night. It might well be, and indeed probably was the
case, that Kaneke's appeal to the head and source of the local law was
but a happy accident which chanced to fit in with a preconceived plan.
But, putting two and two together, that such a plan existed seemed to
me more probable. After all there might be something in Arkle's story,
which up till now I had held to spring from the illusions of a man who
had suffered great hardships and had been hunted almost to death. I
allude not to his dreams of a twin-soul awaiting him in some far-off
place, which were of a character that has been heard of before in the
case of young men and women of strong imagination and romantic nature,
but to his tale of having actually met this lady on the shore of the
sacred lake, after which he remembered no more until he found himself
running for dear life from the spears of the Abanda.</p>

<p>According to this tale on that occasion his love-affair had made
most satisfactory progress. The lady, it seemed, was a thorough convert
to the twin-soul theory and alleged that what he had experienced were
no myths but spiritual realities, or in other words that for years the
two of them had been in some kind of mystical communion. Moreover the
not unnatural conclusion of the matter was that he had embraced her. It
was true that she protested, yet why? Not because she was personally
offended, and much less shocked or pained; but for the reason that he
was violating the sacred law of her country and thereby exposing
himself, and possibly her also, to very terrible risks and danger, even
of death--which in fact, whether from this or some other cause, nearly
overtook him.</p>

<p>Well, always presuming that some such event took place, what was
more natural than that these two young people should wish to meet again
and to, so to speak, regularize their relationship? Nothing can be more
dangerous to either party among savage or semi-savage peoples, than
that a stranger should become extremely intimate with a sanctified lady
who by the custom of ages is vowed and sealed to the ruler of her
tribe. But if that stranger himself becomes the ruler, the face of the
problem changes.</p>

<p>Now it appeared that, for reasons which I could not pretend to
fathom, this was exactly what was desired by the priestess herself and
by some of her most important adherents. Otherwise why did Kumpana, the
Prime Minister or head of the Council of the Shadow, go to meet Arkle
far away and guide him through the Abanda and into the hidden country
at great risk to himself? And having done this and other things, would
it be surprising if he had arranged a dramatic public appearance of
that priestess, at which she was to recognize the stranger as the man
of the prophecy, as chief, too, in place of one who had been given his
life in exchange for his abdication of that and other offices, and
consequently as her future husband? Oh, the whole business was as clear
as the tall observation tower in front of me; such obvious manoeuvres
could not deceive a person of my acumen for a moment--or so I
thought.</p>

<p>Now while I was reflecting thus, Kumpana had passed between the
priests and, standing with his face to the fire upon the altar, was
engaged in uttering some petition in a voice which I could not hear
because he spoke very low and his back was towards me. Nor could I see
much of him or anything else, for the reason that the observation tower
I have just spoken of as so plainly visible, vanished from my sight,
being suddenly obscured by clouds which appeared upon the face of the
sky. They were thick tempest clouds, for I heard the muttering of
distant thunder, and a breath of cold wind passed through the forest
with a moaning noise. Indeed, everything became so dark that I
whispered to Arkle to look out lest Kaneke should take advantage of the
gloom to attack him. He made no answer; his attention was so fixed upon
other matters that he did not seem to hear me. He leaned forward,
breathing heavily like a man under the stress of emotion, and stared at
the fire upon the altar. I, too, stared at this fire, because in that
gloom I could see little else except figures moving dimly against the
background of the fire, which I took to be those of Kumpana and the
priests.</p>

<p>The heart of the distant storm rolled away over the western cliffs
of the crater, drawing the clouds after it and the half-moon appeared
again. Its light falling direct upon the platform revealed a single
figure standing in front of the altar, the tall figure of a woman
arrayed in glittering robes, green they seemed to be, sewn with silver.
Of her face I could only see that it was young, and fair-skinned like
to that of a white woman, for it was shadowed by a dark veil which hung
from her head, unless indeed what I took to be a veil was the mass of
her black hair flowing over her shoulders. Her arms were bare except
for bracelets of what looked like pearls fastened upon the wrists and
above the elbows, and on her head she wore some kind of crown or fillet
which added to her height and shone, but of what it was made I do not
know.</p>

<p>The whole effect of this figure seen thus in the half-light and
against a background of the altar with its flickering fire, was
strangely impressive, mystic, and beautiful; so much so that I remember
catching my breath at its first appearance. If I had any doubt as to
who this woman might be, it was removed by the audience on the plain
who, with one voice cried:</p>

<p><i>"Engoi! Engoi!"</i> (a word that among them means, it seems,
"Spirit" as well as "Divinity") and prostrated themselves.</p>

<p>Arkle, too, muttered something about "Shadow" and half rose as
though to go to her, when an instinct warned me to catch him by the
arm, whereon he sat down again and waited.</p>

<p>She fixed her fine eyes upon the face of old Kumpana, who stood in
front of her but to her left, and began to speak in a very sweet low
voice, that gave the suggestion of a chant learnt by heart rather than
of ordinary talk, for in it was something dreamlike and rather
unearthly. Indeed, it was unlike the voice and speech of any woman that
I had ever heard, except one--and she was in an hypnotic trance. In
fact, it reminded me forcibly of what the prophet Isaiah describes as
the voice "of one that hath a familiar spirit" speaking "low out of the
dust". Hearing it for the first time I felt rather frightened, because
it suggested to my mind that this fair creature might be under an
unholy spell, or even something more or less than mortal. Evidently
Hans thought the same, for he muttered into my ear:</p>

<p>"Keep clear of that one, Baas, or she will bewitch you worse than
White-Mouse. She is not a maiden but a spook. Yes, she is the queen of
the spooks."</p>

<p>I hit him in the face with my elbow as a sign to be silent, though
the thought did pass through my mind that there was an air about this
lady which reminded me of White-Mouse, White-Mouse grown taller and
more imposing. To my fancy they might well have been sisters.</p>

<p>Then in the midst of the deep quiet she spoke, or chanted as an
oracle might do.</p>

<p>"I have been called. I come from where I dwell upon the water. In my
secret place where I dwell with my maidens and no man may set his foot
save he who is appointed to be my lord; yes, there in the ancient halls
built by a people that is no more, the swift messenger has brought me
the message of my priests, and I have considered of their riddle. To it
I, the Oracle inspired, give answer in the hearing of my people that
all may learn my will and the will of That I serve:</p>

<p>"One," and she pointed to Kaneke with something in her hand, it
looked like a little wand or sceptre of ivory, "who sinned against the
Shadow that has faded, and was driven from the land, has returned again
to take the place that was sworn to him according to the ancient law
and to wed the Shadow that has risen from the House of Shadows. One,"
and she pointed to Arkle, "called hither by the decree of Fate, a
wanderer from far, has come to the hidden land and suffered many things
because in ignorance he broke its customs. One," and she pointed to me,
"who, like the Wanderer also called hither by the decree of Fate,
rescued him, the Wanderer, from death at the hands of the Abanda, my
enemies. He who should be chief of the people and Shelter of the
Shadow, foully strove to murder the white Wanderer, but was overthrown
of him, and to save his life swore an oath upon my name and upon that
whereof I am the Voice, that in return for breath he would sell his
lordship and its rights. So he was spared and not slain, and became the
servant of the Wanderer whom he would have murdered. Now, the message
tells me, he takes back his oath and claims the chieftainship that was
his heritage, and with it the Holy Bride. Is the case thus, O Priests
and Ministers and People?"</p>

<p>"It is thus," all answered with one voice, for even Kaneke attempted
no denial.</p>

<p>Now she stared hard at Kumpana, as an actor might at the prompter in
the wings, then seemed to catch her cue and went on:</p>

<p>"I, the Voice, speak the judgment that is set within my lips.
Hearken. It is told, ay, and written in the secret records which are
hidden yonder where I dwell, that once in a far age it chanced that he
who was appointed to be the Shield of the Shadow, sought to slay
another foully. But this other conquered that murderer, and in exchange
for the gift of life bought from him his place and power and the Shadow
of his day herself. Thence came a great war and the division of the
people which endures until this hour. As it was, so let it be. I, the
Voice, decree and declare that Kaneke, the murderer at heart and the
oath-breaker, is no longer chief of the Dabanda and that never shall he
be the Shield of the Shadow and her spouse. I decree and declare that
his chieftainship has passed to the Wanderer lord whom he would have
slain, and that with it passes the Shadow herself, should the Wanderer
desire to clasp her for his hour. The Voice has spoken. Is the decree
accepted, O Priests and Ministers and People?"</p>

<p>The dreamy, mysterious tones died in the silence and again in a
great volume of sound came the answer:</p>

<p>"It is accepted!" and a priest speaking out of the darkness added,
"Kaneke called upon the Shadow to appear and give the judgment of the
Engoi. The judgment has been given; the Engoi has spoken by its oracle;
it is finished."</p>

<p>"It is not finished; it is but begun," shouted Kaneke. "You who have
bewitched the Shadow, call down a curse upon your souls and on her the
curse of war."</p>

<p>Here his words came to a sudden end, for what reason I could not
see, but I think that the guards threatened him with their spears,
commanding his silence. Nor did she who was called Shadow seem to hear
them, for once more she spoke in her cold, chirping voice like one who
repeats a lesson in her sleep.</p>

<p>"Come hither, O Wanderer," she said, "to do me homage, and take from
me the lordship of the Land of the Holy Lake, and if it be your
pleasure, swear yourself to me, as I will swear myself to you. Or, do
not come, if such be your will. For know, O Wanderer, that with this
rule goes trouble and the dread of death. Yonder man who would have
murdered you spoke truth. War is at hand, and of that war the end is
not shown to me. Mayhap in it you will find nothing save doom and loss.
Choose, then."</p>

<p>"I have chosen," said Arkle, and rising, strove to walk to her, only
to find that his hurts had stiffened so that now he could scarcely
stand unaided.</p>

<p>"Help me!" he said, and a few seconds later was limping towards the
altar supporting himself upon my shoulder. It was but a little way, yet
that journey seemed long to me, perhaps because of its strangeness,
perhaps because the concentrated interest of every watching man and
woman beat upon me with such intensity that it hampered my physical
powers. At length we reached the altar and the big, golden-bearded
Arkle sank on to his knees before the goddess, for so they held
her.</p>

<p>For the first time I could see her face, though even now not too
clearly because her back was to the fire. Certainly it was beautiful;
the fine features, the curving lips, the large eyes, dark and tender,
shining under the ivory pallor of her brows, the masses of the black
hair flowing from beneath her coronal--all were beautiful, as were her
arms and shapely, tapering hands. Her tall figure, too, was full of
girlish grace and yet of dignity, that of one born to command, while
her shimmering robes, how fashioned or of what stuff I know not, were
such as might have been worn by the creature of a dream and even
suggested something unfamiliar to our world.</p>

<p>What could this woman be, I wondered, and from what blood did she
spring? Arab, Egyptian, Eastern? I never learned the answer. One thing,
however, I did learn then and there, namely that when the shell was off
her, at heart she was very human. Her face showed it as she bent down
over this man whom in some strange fashion she had drawn to her from
half across the world. It was not the face of the priestess of some
ancient, secret faith welcoming a worshipper, but rather that of a
woman greeting her lover won at last. The lips trembled, the eyes
filled with happy tears, her figure drooped; she grew languid as though
with an access of passion, her arms opened as if they would clasp him,
then fell again when she remembered that eyes were on her--oh, that
this man was everything to her I could not doubt!</p>

<p>With an evident effort of the will she recovered herself and began
to speak again, but in a fuller and more natural voice than she had
used when she played her part of oracle. Indeed it was so different
that if her face had been hidden from me, I should not have thought the
speaker to be the same.</p>

<p>"Wilt thou serve my people and accept lordship over them, O
Wanderer?" she asked, probably in the adapted words of some ancient
ritual.</p>

<p>"The lordship I have bought already, and I will serve them as best I
may," he answered.</p>

<p>"Wilt thou do homage, O Wanderer, to me, Shadow, the Dweller in the
Lake, the Oracle, the Priestess of the Engoi?"</p>

<p>"I will do you homage, O Shadow," he answered, and bent his head as
though to kiss her sandalled feet or the hem of her robe.</p>

<p>She saw it and swiftly stretched out her arm, murmuring so low that
only he and I could hear.</p>

<p>"Not my foot, my hand."</p>

<p>He took it and pressed it to his lips. Then with her little ivory
sceptre she touched him on the brow twice, once to accept the homage,
and next to give him all authority. Now she spoke for a third time,
asking,</p>

<p>"Wilt thou swear thyself to me, that at the time appointed thou
mayest take the Shadow to thee and for thine hour protect her on the
path of Fate?"</p>

<p>This she said out loud so that all should hear, then before he could
answer, made a sign to him to be silent, and added in a whisper,</p>

<p>"Bethink thee, O Beloved, before thou dost answer. Thou knowest the
mystery and that our hearts have spoken together across the empty air,
as once they spoke in an age bygone. Yet remember that I am not of thy
land and race, that I am strange and secret, full of a wisdom that thou
dost not understand, that my day is short and that when I die it is the
law that thou diest also, so that together we may pass to another home
of which thou dost not know and in which thou mayest not believe.
Remember also that dangers are many, and it may be that never wilt thou
hold me to thy heart. Therefore be warned ere thou tiest a cord that
cannot be undone save by the sword of death. Dost thou understand?"</p>

<p>"I understand," he whispered back, "and on the chance that thou
mayest be mine if only for an hour, I, who have risked much already,
will risk the rest, I who love thee, and if need be, for love will
die."</p>

<p>She sighed, so deeply that her whole frame shook as though with the
joy of an intense relief, saying, still beneath her breath,</p>

<p>"So be it. Now take the oath."</p>

<p>Then in a loud voice he said,</p>

<p>"I swear myself to thee, O Shadow. Dost thou swear thyself to
me?"</p>

<p>"I swear myself," she began, but said no more, for at that moment
Kaneke leapt upon her, swiftly as a leopard leaps upon a buck. I
suppose that while all watched the remarkable scene I have described,
he had slipped from his guards. What he meant to do I am not sure, but
I imagine that trusting to his great strength, he intended to carry her
off with the help of confederates among the people. Or perhaps it was
in his mind to kill her out of jealousy rather than see her give
herself to another man.</p>

<p>The sequel was both swift and most amazing. I did nothing, to my
shame be it said; I was taken too much by surprise, and before I
recovered myself that sequel was accomplished. The priests did nothing
either, being like myself overcome with astonishment. Arkle was on his
knees and even if he understood what was passing, being lame and stiff,
could not rise from them without assistance. Only from either side of
the altar, or from behind it, white-draped figures seemed to flit
forward. I suppose these were the virgins of the Shadow, but really I
cannot say, for their appearance was so quick, so mysterious and so
vague that in that light they might quite well have been shades born of
imagination, or even large white-winged birds seen for a moment in the
light of the fire. Nor, whatever they were, did they take any action
that I could discern; they just came and presently were gone again.
Further, my attention was not fixed upon these appearances which I only
saw out of the corner of my eye, as it were, but on the central
figures, the lady called Shadow, and on her assailant, the owl-eyed
Kaneke.</p>

<p>Evidently she saw him come, for her face grew frightened and she
uttered a little cry. Then in a twinkling her aspect changed, or so I
fancied. She drew herself up to her full height, her face hardened and
became stern, the fear passed from it and was replaced by a cold anger.
As the man leapt on her she stretched out her arm, that in which she
held the little sceptre and exclaimed.</p>

<p><i>"Be accursed!"</i></p>

<p>The effect upon Kaneke of these words, or of her mien, or of both,
or of something that I could not see or appreciate, unless it were the
flitting white figures, was wonderful. I have compared his rush with
that of a leopard. Well, have you ever seen such a beast stopped by a
bullet, not a bullet that killed it dead, but one that paralysed its
nervous system with the shock of its impact, taking all the courage out
of it, causing it to stop, to tremble, and finally to turn and flee for
shelter? If so, you will understand what happened to Kaneke better than
I can describe it in writing.</p>

<p>He came to a standstill, so sudden that the weight of his charge
caused him to slide forward for a foot or two upon the pavement. Then
he appeared to collapse; at least to my sight he looked actually
smaller, I suppose because his breath left him, causing his body to
shrink. Next he uttered a low cry of fear and, turning, fled like a
flash, bounding down the steps that led to the altar and vanishing into
the gloom.</p>

<p>I think that some ran after him, but of this I am not sure. If so,
perhaps it was the faint indefinite figures that I have described, for
I lost him in a kind of white mist that may of course have been an
effect caused by the robes of those who followed.</p>

<p>To tell the truth I did not look long, because Arkle, who was
struggling to his feet, uttered an exclamation which caused me to turn
my head and perceive that the Shadow lady was no longer there.</p>

<p>"Where is she?" I asked.</p>

<p>"I don't know," he answered. "I think women came and took her away,
but it was all so confused I cannot swear."</p>

<p>Then the gathering broke up in tumult. Kumpana and others escorted
us down the steps, Arkle still leaning on my shoulder and
expostulating, for naturally enough he wished to follow the Shadow,
which he was not allowed to do. At the foot of the steps we were
separated, he being helped off I knew not where, while I was taken back
to the guest-house.</p>

<p>"We will meet tomorrow," he called after me, and I replied that I
hoped so. Then he and his escort vanished into the darkness.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>"Baas," said Hans, as I began to undress, "it is almost a pity that
those Abanda did not catch the Baas Red-Bull."</p>

<p>"Why?" I asked wearily.</p>

<p>"For two reasons, Baas. If he had been killed he would have been
saved a great deal of trouble, who now is caught like a fly in a
spider's web. You know the sort of spider, Baas, which bites the fly
and sends it to sleep for days or weeks, until it wants to eat it. The
fly looks quite happy and so it is until the eating begins, when it
wakes up and kicks because it can't buzz as its wings have been pulled
off. Well, that is what will happen to the Red Baas. The pretty-painted
spider has got him and made him drunk and he will be quite happy, not
knowing that his wings have been pulled off until the time comes when
he wakes up to be sacrificed, or something of that sort, Baas. That's
the first reason."</p>

<p>Now I bethought me that as usual there was wisdom in Hans' cynical
remarks and metaphors. Undoubtedly Arkle was entangled in an evil web,
and what was the fate which lay before him, a white man of good birth
and education and presumably a Christian? He was beloved of a beautiful
and mystic woman whom he in turn adored and probably in due course
would marry.</p>

<p>This seemed pleasant enough, and natural--if bizarre. Could he have
taken the lady away to his own land perhaps the adventure might even
have proved successful in a matrimonial sense. But what were the facts?
Departure was impossible for her and for him also. Once he was wed to
her, here he must remain to the end of the chapter.</p>

<p>Moreover for a bridal dower he took with her a mass of obscure and
dangerous superstitions, as to which only one thing was clear, namely
that, as I had heard her declare with her own lips, these would involve
the pair of them in certain death, possibly quite soon, and surely at
no very distant date. Of course he might maintain that he had been
given fair warning and that the price he must pay was not too high for
what he won. But then he was not in a state to judge with an even mind,
and as an individual of his own race and standing with some experience
of the world, I could not agree with this view of his case.</p>

<p>Such were some of the thoughts that passed through my mind but of
these I said nothing to Hans, contenting myself with asking his second
reason.</p>

<p>"Oh, Baas, it is this," he answered. "If the Red Baas were out of
the way, you would have been put in his place, as I dare say will
happen after all if Kaneke manages to murder him, or those priests
change their minds about him."</p>

<p>"Thank you," I said, "and what then?"</p>

<p>"Then, Baas, as happy married pair always does, you would set up
house on that island, which otherwise we shall never see, and find out
where they keep their gold and other things that are worth money, of
which I learn they have plenty hidden away on the island, although this
silly people does not use them because they are a holy, ancient
treasure, Baas, that has been there for hundreds or thousands of
years."</p>

<p>"And if this treasure exists and I found it, what next Hans?"</p>

<p>"Why, then, Baas, of course you would steal it and get away, leaving
the lady to look at the empty boxes, Baas. Perhaps you think it would
be difficult, but Hans would manage it all for you. Priests can always
be bought, Baas, and as for oaths and the rest," he added, springing to
a very pinnacle of immorality, "good Christians like you and me
wouldn't need to bother about <i>them,</i> Baas, because you see they
have all to do with the devil. So we should get away very rich and be
happy to the end of our lives. But," he went on with a sigh, "it is
nothing but a nice dream, because the Red Baas stands in our way.
Unless indeed"--here he brightened up--"we can make a bargain with him
and go shares in everything that he gets."</p>

<p>I did not try to argue with Hans because his lack of moral sense,
real or assumed, was, so to speak, quite out of shot of argument. So I
only said:</p>

<p>"I should be glad enough to get out of this place without any
treasure, if only I could do so with a whole skin. Did you hear all the
talk about war?"</p>

<p>"Oh yes, Baas. From the beginning that owl-man Kaneke has said that
there would be war, which was why he brought you here."</p>

<p>"Well, Hans, if it is to be with the Abanda, I don't see what chance
these Dabanda will have, for they are but a handful."</p>

<p>"None, Baas, if the fight were with spears. But they don't trust to
spears; they trust to magic of which there is plenty in this land.
Didn't you see when the Engoi woman cursed Kaneke, how he curled up,
just as though she had kicked him in the stomach, Baas, and ran away,
although a minute before he had meant to carry her off with the help of
his friends, of whom no doubt he has plenty? That was magic, Baas."</p>

<p>I shrugged my shoulders and answered:</p>

<p>"I think it was scare and a guilty conscience. But I don't
understand about this Kaneke. Why, if they don't like him, was he ever
brought away from the place where he was living? Why did White-Mouse
insist upon our rescuing him, and a dozen other things?"</p>

<p>"Oh, for lots of reasons, Baas. While he was named as the
Chief-to-be, no one else could take his place according to their law.
That is one. Also no one else could guide you to this country. That is
another. Also he had to come because the Shadow Lady said so, something
to do with their fetish business, or prophecies, Baas; you will never
learn what makes the minds of spook-people like these Dabanda turn this
way or that."</p>

<p>"I dare say not. What I should like to learn is whether our friend
Kaneke is alive or dead."</p>

<p>"Alive, I think, Baas; yes, I am almost sure that he got away by the
help of his friends in the crowd below, though I dare say that the
curses of the Shadow Queen went with him; indeed I thought I saw them
following him like white owls. I expect we shall see and hear plenty
more of Kaneke, Baas."</p>

<p>As usual Hans was quite right; we did.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<h1><a name="c015">CHAPTER XV</a></h1>

<br>


<h1>LAKE MONE AND THE FOREST</h1>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>After this tumultuous and exciting night I spent a very quiet time
at Dabanda-town, where for the next ten days or so nothing happened
that could be called remarkable.</p>

<p>Grateful enough I was to rest thus awhile, because our long journey
had tired me out and I found it delightful to enjoy repose and leisure
in a climate which although hot, was on the whole delicious. Still as I
am an active-minded person, I took advantage of this pause to learn all
I could about the Dabanda and their enemies, the Abanda, only to find
that in the end I had really learned very little. Kumpana and other
members of the Council came to see me frequently and talked with great
openness upon many matters, but when I came to boil down their
conversation, the residium was small enough.</p>

<p>I was told that Kaneke had escaped, as they said, "by making himself
invisible", a feat in which no doubt the darkness helped him. Where he
had gone, they were not sure. Possibly, they said, he had turned
traitor and run away to the Abanda, though such a crime had never been
heard of in their history. Or he might have returned towards the
country where I had met him. Or possibly he was dead, killed by the
curse of the Engoi, though they did not think this probable, for being
himself a magician and one of the initiated, he knew how to fashion
shields which would turn aside or delay the deadliest curses.</p>

<p>My inquiries upon other matters were almost equally unfruitful. I
asked when the promised war would come and was informed that they did
not know, but that no doubt it "would happen at the time
appointed".</p>

<p>Nor would they tell me anything definite about the lady called
Shadow, whom I had seen upon the altar platform. They were, they
asserted, ignorant of what caused her to be fairer-skinned and more
beautiful than other women; they only knew that for many generations
the Lake-Dweller always had been so; it was a family gift. They
admitted that she lived upon an island in the waters of Mone, in the
company of certain virgins who dwelt with her in ancient buildings
erected by an unknown and forgotten people, but of these buildings and
the fashion of her life there they could say nothing, as none of them
had ever visited the place, upon which it was unlawful for any man to
set foot except the husband of the Engoi after marriage, and so on.</p>

<p>Thus it came about that at last I abandoned inquiries, which led to
no result, for the very good reason that those whom I questioned were
determined to tell me nothing, and fell back upon my own powers of
observation, assisted by those of Hans. Being allowed to do so with an
escort, I walked about the country, but saw nothing worthy of note.</p>

<p>Here and there were little villages inhabited by a handful of
people, and round these some cultivated fields, also grazing grounds on
which were herded cattle of a small breed and goats, but no true
woolled sheep, creatures that would not thrive in so hot a district.
The rest of the land, which was of extraordinary richness and could
have supported ten times as many people, was given up to game of every
variety except, as I have said, those that are harmful to man, which
did not exist there.</p>

<p>The animals were wonderfully tame; indeed one could walk among them
as Adam and Eve are reported to have done in the Garden of Eden. Again
I asked Kumpana and others how this came about and was
answered--because of the spell laid upon them, also because they were
never molested or killed for food. I inquired why and was informed
because they were holy, taboo in short, as Father Ambrose had heard
from the slave in bygone years. Then for the first time I discovered
that the Dabanda believed that after death the spirits of men, or those
of certain men of their race, passed into the bodies of animals; also
that sometimes this happened before birth.</p>

<p>It was for this reason that the beasts were not touched, since
nobody likes to put a spear through his grandmother or his future
child.</p>

<p>Next I referred to the elephants we had met outside their country,
over which Kaneke seemed to have control, and inquired how this
happened. The reply was that these beasts or their progenitors had once
lived in Mone-land, whence they were driven, or "requested to leave" as
Kumpana put it, because they did so much mischief, which accounted for
the mystery.</p>

<p>My own view, of course, is (or, perhaps I should say, was) that the
creatures were tame because no man ever harmed them, but I quote the
story as an example of the superstitions of these star-worshippers. To
many African tribes certain creatures are taboo, but never before or
since have I heard of one to which all game was sacred, perchance
because no other of small numbers has so rich a food supply that it
needs to be supplemented by the flesh of wild animals. Among the
Dabanda, however, this was so.</p>

<p>Their fertile soil, amply watered by rain and streams, needed but to
be scratched to yield abundantly of corn and various roots and
vegetables, while their numerous flocks and herds furnished all the
milk and meat they required. Therefore there was no necessity for them
to undertake the risk and toil of hunting, with the result that those
beasts which they never killed, in the course of time naturally became
both tame and sacred.</p>

<p>Having finished such investigation of the country as I was allowed
to make--all approach to the lip of the crater was, I should explain,
forbidden to me--I was seized with a great desire to explore the forest
land and to look upon the sacred waters of the Lake Mone.</p>

<p>At first, when I mentioned this matter, Kumpana always turned the
subject, but ultimately on the day of full moon, he said that if I so
desired, he was ready to conduct me through the forest so that I might
look upon the lake by moonlight, adding that it was not lawful for any
man to enter this forest, much less to see the lake, in the
daytime.</p>

<p>Of course I jumped at the offer, and shortly after moonrise we
started, three of us, Kumpana, I, and Hans, whom at first Kumpana
wished to leave behind. Indeed he only gave way on the point when I
refused to go without him, while Hans on his part remarked, in infamous
Arabic, that it has always been his custom to shoot anyone who tried to
separate him from his master.</p>

<p>Within five minutes we found ourselves in a pit of blackness. That
forest must have been dark at noonday, and at night, even when there
was a full moon, it was like a coal-mine. We could only get along at
all by help of some yards of the stem of a creeper of which Kumpana
held one end. Then I grasped it at a distance of a few feet, and lastly
came Hans holding to the other end.</p>

<p>It may be asked how Kumpana could see his way.</p>

<p>The answer is--that I do not know, but he led us quite briskly along
some path that I was unable to perceive, which wound in and out through
the trunks of giant trees, and skirted some that had fallen. Thus we
walked for some hours, only seeing a ray of light now and then where a
tree, dead and devoid of leaf, allowed it to reach the ground.</p>

<p>At length this forest ceased as suddenly as it had begun, and we
stood upon the broad beach of the lake, most of which doubtless was
covered in times of heavy rain.</p>

<p>Oh, how desolate was that great sheet of water glimmering in the
bright moonlight, and yet how beautiful, set in its ring of forest
land. Save for the soughing sound of wildfowl flighting far out of
sight, and the occasional croak of a frog, it was utterly silent. Its
lonesomeness was oppressive, almost terrible, for no beasts seemed to
frequent it; nor did I see or hear so much as a fish stirring; well
could I understand that a semi-savage race should deem it to be holy
and haunted. Far away I could see the island on which the priestess
Shadow was said to dwell, and noted that it was large, over a mile long
as I judged, though how wide it may have been of course I did not know.
What is more, I could distinguish buildings amidst the palms which grew
upon this island.</p>

<p>Taking my glasses, very good ones of a German make which were fitted
with a lens for use at night, I studied the place and saw at once that
these building were large, massive, and apparently covered with
sculpture. They seemed to be constructed of limestone or alabaster, or
some other white rock such as marble, and before them stood gateways
and towers, certain of which looked as though they were half in ruins.
In architecture and style they were totally different from any that I
knew of in Africa, not excepting the Zimbabwe ruins.</p>

<p>They had, however, a distinct resemblance to the remains of the
temples of Old Egypt which at that time I had never seen except in
pictures. There were what might be pylon gates; there were walls
covered with great carvings; there were courts with pillars in them,
for the end of one of these had fallen down or never been completed,
and with the glasses I could see the columns.</p>

<p>The sight thrilled me. Was it possible that these mysterious
buildings had been erected by people from Ancient Egypt, or even by
some race that afterwards had migrated to Egypt, taking their
architecture with them? Now that I come to think of it, the truncated
pyramid outside the town where stood the stone altar upon which the
fire burned, suggested that this might be so.</p>

<p>I turned to Kumpana and questioned him closely, but he could, or
would, tell me very little. He repeated that he had never been on the
island "in the flesh" for the reasons that he had already explained,
but that he understood the buildings there to be tremendous, of a sort
indeed to defy time for thousands upon thousands of years. There was no
record of their construction, or of the people who had accomplished
this mighty work and dwelt there. Not so much as a tradition survived.
Time had eaten up their name and race, though perhaps the sculptures
might tell something to anyone who learned enough to understand them.
For the rest from generation to generation they had always been sacred
to the Engoi and the home of her who for her day was known as Shadow,
and her virgins.</p>

<p>"Can I not visit them?" I asked.</p>

<p>I saw a sarcastic smile upon Kumpana's wrinkled old face as he
answered.</p>

<p>"Oh yes, Lord, if you are a very good swimmer. Only should you live
to reach the island the women there will tear you to pieces."</p>

<p>Now since then I have often thought that this was rubbish, for
surely women who lived in such an unnatural state would be glad to
satisfy their curiosity by inspecting even so unfavourable a specimen
of the male sex as myself, that is, if there were any truth at all in
this tale of an African nunnery or Order of Virgins, like those of the
Sun in Old Peru or the Vestals of Rome. At the time, however, all I
thought of was the fate of the men who intruded upon the women's
mysteries in ancient Greece, which was not one that I wished to
share.</p>

<p>Today I am sorry that I did not show more pluck and have a try to
reach that island, but then the adventure appalled me and our lost
chances never return again. Not that I believed the story about the
nuns, for I felt quite sure that if no one ever visited the island,
these sometimes made a trip to the lake shore, as, according to Arkle,
the Shadow herself had done. Kumpana's tale, however, was that their
numbers were kept up by votaries who joined them every year from the
mainland, picked girls of the age of twelve who were called "slaves of
the Engoi".</p>

<p>While I was talking to him Hans, who had the sight of a vulture,
said in Dutch,</p>

<p>"Look, Baas. The women are coming out of that big house."</p>

<p>Raising my glasses I saw that he was right, for a procession of
white-robed figures emerged from under a gateway and walked in
procession down to the water's edge. Here they must have entered boats,
though, owing to the shadow of palms which grew upon the island shore,
I could not see them do so, for presently three large canoes, each
containing five or six women, appeared upon the tranquil bosom of the
lake and were paddled slowly towards us. (Who made the canoes if no man
ever visited the island? I wondered.) In much excitement I asked if
they were coming to see me as I might not go to see them; but again
Kumpana smiled and shook his head.</p>

<p>On they glided till they were within about two hundred yards from
where we stood. Then they halted in a line and began a sweet and
plaintive chant, of which in that great stillness the sound reached us
clearly.</p>

<p>"What are they doing?" I asked. "Making an offering to the full
moon?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Lord," Kumpana answered, "and I think something more."</p>

<p>He was right. There was "something more", for presently the women in
the central canoe bent down and lifted a white draped form which they
cast over the prow, so that it fell into the water with a large splash
and vanished there.</p>

<p>"Is it a funeral?" I asked again.</p>

<p>"No doubt, Lord. See, they throw flowers on to the water where the
body sank."</p>

<p>That was his reply, but something in his tone caused uncomfortable
doubts to rise in my mind. What if the form wrapped in those white
veils was quick--not dead? What if this rite was not one of burial but
of sacrifice or execution? Here I may state that afterwards Hans swore
that he saw the draped shape struggle, but as I did not, this may have
been his imagination.</p>

<p>Still the business was eerie and made me shiver; so much so that I
was not sorry when the women turned the canoe-heads islandwards, and
departed still singing, or even when Kumpana said it was time for us to
follow their example and go home. To my mind there was something weird,
even unholy, about this sacred lake and island, where rose fantastic
buildings of unknown age inhabited by night-haunting women who made
offerings to the full moon, as the old Egyptians might have done, and I
believe did to Nut or Hathor, ominous offerings shaped like a human
corpse. And if this was so with these, the forest was even worse, as I
have now to tell.</p>

<p>We entered its shapes guided as before by Kumpana with the help of
the creeper-stem. Somehow it depressed me more even than it had done
upon our journey lakewards, perhaps because my nerves were jangled by
all that I have described. At any rate, I suppose in an instinctive
endeavour to keep up my spirits, I entered into conversation with Hans
behind me, speaking perhaps rather more loudly than was necessary as a
kind of challenge to that overpowering silence.</p>

<p>I need not repeat our conversation in detail, or further than to say
that it had to do with the Dabandas, their superstitions, and their
pretentions to magical powers. Speaking in Dutch, and sometimes in
English, so that Kumpana might not understand me, I criticized these in
no measured terms, announcing my belief that they were rubbish and that
the Dabanda priests and magicians were a set of infernal humbugs. Hans,
always argumentative, combated this view and gave it as his opinion
that the Dabanda, from Kaneke and Kumpana down, were particular
favourites of the devil.</p>

<p>At this point Kumpana looked back and remarked somewhat sternly that
it was well not to talk so loudly in the forest lest the spirits who
had their home there should be angered.</p>

<p>Then I lost my temper and expressed entire disbelief in these
spirits, asking him too well what he meant by trying to fool a white
man with talk of tree-dwelling spirits, and whether he was referring to
monkeys which we knew lived in such places and were reported sometimes
to pelt travellers through them with sticks or nuts.</p>

<p>Apparently Kumpana did not appreciate the joke, for he looked back
at me (I could see him because at the moment we were wading through a
little swamp where no trees grew), with an expression on his face that
I thought threatening, and said with cold courtesy:</p>

<p>"I pray you to be silent, Lord Macumazahn, and above all not to
offer insults to the masters of this place."</p>

<p>This made me angrier than ever. Was I, a more or less educated
Christian man, to have my mouth stopped with the mud of such heathen
mumbo-jumbo stuff? Certainly not. Therefore I continued my argument
with Hans, speaking more loudly than before. Hans replied with sarcasm
which was the more irritating because it contained a grain of truth,
that the real reason I talked thus was that I was afraid and therefore
made a noise to shout down my fear, as children do. Then he went on
with a garbled version of the story of the Witch of Endor who, he
declared, I think erroneously, also lived in a wood, and to quote
absurd remarks about witchcraft, which he attributed to my poor old
father, adding his devout hope that he, "the reverend Predikant" as he
called him, was keeping an eye upon us at that moment.</p>

<p>Truly I believe that there must have been some exciting quality in
the air of that forest, exhaled perhaps by the foliage or flowers of
certain trees or creepers that grew there, for at this point a kind of
rage possessed me which caused me to rate and objurgate Hans, begging
him to be good enough not to take my father's name in vain and put
words in his mouth that he had never spoken, in order to justify his
low, savage beliefs in ghosts and magic.</p>

<p>Just then we came to a spot where a great tree had fallen, breaking
down others in its descent and allowing the moonlight to reach us for a
few paces. As we went round the stump of this prostrate tree Kumpana
turned again, saying:</p>

<p>"I have warned you and you will not listen. White stranger, I shall
warn you no more."</p>

<p>I looked at the man and it struck me that his aspect had changed. No
longer did he seem the little withered old fellow with shrewd eyes and
a wrinkled, rather kindly, if cunning, face to whom I was accustomed.
He appeared to have grown taller and to have acquired a fierce cast of
countenance, while his eyes glowed like those of a lion in a cave.</p>

<p>Remembering that moonlight plays strange tricks and that his added
height must be due to the fact that he was standing on a root of the
fallen tree, I took no heed, but continued to wrangle with Hans like
one who has had too much to drink, or is half under the influence of
laughing-gas. Then we proceeded as before and presently were again
enveloped in the utter gloom of the forest. Suddenly I was brought to a
standstill by butting into the trunk of a tree, while Hans behind ran
the muzzle of his rifle into my back.</p>

<p>"Where are you going, Kumpana?" I asked indignantly, but there was
no answer.</p>

<p>Then to call his attention I pulled at the vine-like creeper that
served us as a rope. It flew back and flicked me in the face; no one
was holding it!</p>

<p>"Hans!" I exclaimed. "Kumpana has given us the slip."</p>

<p>"Yes, Baas," he answered. "I thought something of that sort would
happen, Baas, if you would keep on spitting in the faces of the forest
spirits, of which probably he is one himself."</p>

<p>I reflected a while and had an idea.</p>

<p>"Let us get back to the place where there is light, and think things
over," I said.</p>

<p>"Yes, Baas," he answered. "Lead on, Baas, for I don't know the way
and can't see our spoor in the dark."</p>

<p>I turned and started, with the most disastrous results. Before we
had gone ten paces I crashed into another tree-trunk and hurt myself
considerably. Circumventing this, presently I plunged into a piece of
swampy ground and sank over my knees in tenacious mud, out of which
Hans pulled me with difficulty. Once more we started with my boots full
of water, but before I had taken five steps I became entangled in some
thorny creeper which pricked me horribly. Freeing myself at length I
stepped forward again, only to catch my foot in a root and fall on my
face. Then I sat down and said things which I prefer not to record.</p>

<p>"It is very difficult, Baas, to find one's way in a big wood when it
is quite dark," remarked Hans blandly. "What does the Baas wish to do
now?"</p>

<p>"Stop here till it grows lighter, I suppose, if it ever does in this
infernal place," I answered. Then I filled my pipe and finding that I
had lost my matches, probably when I fell, I asked Hans for one.</p>

<p>He produced his cherished box, of which we had not too many left,
and having first filled his own pipe, struck a match and handed it to
me. As I took it I remembered noticing how steadily the flame burned in
that utterly still air. Then I lifted the match to my pipe and as I did
so something blew it out.</p>

<p>"Why did you do that?" I asked angrily of Hans. "Are you afraid of
setting the forest on fire?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Baas--I mean no, Baas. I mean I didn't blow it out, Baas. A
monkey blew it out; I saw its ugly face," replied Hans in a voice that
suggested to me that he was frightened.</p>

<p>"Rubbish!" I exclaimed. "Give me another match."</p>

<p>He obeyed rather unwillingly and the same thing happened, no doubt
because there was a current of air which passed between the tree-trunks
in puffs.</p>

<p>Well, my desire to smoke suddenly departed and I told Hans that we
must not waste any more matches in such a draughty spot. He agreed and
set his back firmly against mine, explaining that he was cold, a
palpable lie as the heat in that stifling place was so great that we
both ran with perspiration.</p>

<p>"Now be still and don't talk; I am going to sleep. You can wake me
up at dawn," I said.</p>

<p>Scarcely were the words out of my mouth, when distinctly I heard
laughter, of a queer sort it is true, for it was singularly mirthless,
but still eerie laughter which appeared to come first from one quarter
and then another.</p>

<p>"That old fool, Kumpana, is making fun of us all the time," I said.
"He shall laugh the wrong side of his mouth--if I catch him."</p>

<p>"Yes, Baas, only now he seems to be laughing on all sides of his
face and from everywhere at once--" Hans began, but the rest of his
remarks were lost in a peal of unholy merriment.</p>

<p>It came, as he said, "from everywhere at once", and seemingly even
from above our heads.</p>

<p>"What the deuce is it--hyenas?" I asked.</p>

<p>"No, Baas, it's spooks, very bad spooks. Oh, Baas, why would you
come into this accursed forest to look at a lake where they drown
people at midnight, and then sneer at the devils of the place and call
them monkeys? I am going to pray to your reverend father, Baas, hoping
that he will hear me in the Place of Fires. For if he can't help us, no
one can."</p>

<p>I did not answer him, for when Hans was in this superstitious mood
argument was useless. Moreover I was trying to remember a very
interesting lecture I had once heard about echoes and how these are
multiplied by natural causes. The laughter had died away and I was just
recovering the thread of the lecture when something else happened. A
great stone or clod of earth fell with a thud close to me, and was
followed presently by scores of similar missiles. None of these touched
us, it is true, but they struck everywhere around and even against the
trees above our heads.</p>

<p>After that I really cannot recall what followed, for between
weariness, bewilderment, and exhaustion I grew confused, so that my
mind became torpid. I remember all kinds of sounds, some of them very
loud as though trees were crashing at a distance, and some of them
small and sharp and close at hand, like the agonizing squeals idle
children can produce with a slate-pencil. I remember a feeling on my
face which suggested that my ears and nose were being pulled by tiny
hands.</p>

<p>I remember, too, Hans announcing in a voice which was full of fear
that gorillas with eyes of fire were dancing round us, though if so I
never saw them. Lastly I remember that he fired his rifle, I suppose at
one of the nightmare gorillas, or some other dream-beast, for the sound
of it reverberated through the forest as though it had been a
cannon-shot. Also in its blinding flash I thought I saw queer figures
round us with fantastic faces.</p>

<p>Then I remember nothing more of all those noises and visions, which
were more appropriate to a victim of <i>delirium tremens,</i> than to a
strictly sober man lost in a wood, till at length I heard a gentle
voice say in Arabic:</p>

<p>"Rise, Macumazahn. You have wandered from your path and the air
beneath these trees is poisonous and gives bad dreams. I have been sent
to guide you and your servant back to Dabanda-town."</p>

<p>I obeyed in a great hurry and presently felt a soft hand leading me
I knew not where. Or perhaps I should say that I thought I felt it, for
I dare say this was part of the nightmare from which doubtless I was
suffering, and seemed to be led forward, Hans clinging to my coat-tails
like a child to its mother's skirts, for how long I cannot tell. All I
know is that just as the dawn was breaking we found ourselves upon the
edge of the forest, for there in front of us was the truncated pyramid
upon which burned the altar fire, and beyond it the town. Here in the
shadow of the last trees our guide departed, or seemed to depart. I
noted vaguely in the gloom that she was a woman wrapped in white and of
a graceful figure.</p>

<p>"Farewell," she said with a suspicion of mockery in her voice that
somehow I thought familiar, adding:</p>

<p>"You are very wise, Macumazahn, yet, I pray you, grow a little
wiser, for then you will not mock at what you do not understand, and
will learn that there are powers in the world known to its ancient
peoples of which even white men have not heard."</p>

<p>As she spoke she stepped backwards and before I could answer her had
vanished, although still out of the darkness of that accursed forest I
could hear her musical voice repeating:</p>

<p>"Farewell, Macumazahn, and mock no more at the powers of the ancient
peoples."</p>

<p>"Baas," said Hans as we staggered into our house, "I think that
missie must have been White-Mouse come to life again."</p>

<p>"I don't want to know if she was White-Mouse, or Black-Mouse, or
Piebald-Mouse, or no Mouse at all. What I want is to get out of this
accursed country," I replied savagely, as I kicked off my boots and
threw myself down upon the bed.</p>

<h1><a name="c016">CHAPTER XVI</a></h1>

<br>


<h1>KANEKE'S MESSAGE</h1>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>It may be wondered why I have said so little about Arkle, the real
hero of this story, whom Hans and the natives named Red-Bull because of
his taurine build and great strength. The reason is that I saw little
of the man. After the appearance of Shadow, "the Treasure of the Lake",
that night before the altar and the disappearance of Kaneke laden with
curses like the scapegoat of the ancient Jews, he was laid up for a
while in the Chief's big house or hut with a sore heel. Notwithstanding
their alleged mastery over diseases, this heel, which resulted from his
race for life before the Abanda and his subsequent tramp to the
Lake-town, defied all the skill and spells of the Dabanda doctors or
magicians, for they had but one word to describe the followers of both
these trades.</p>

<p>So I was called in and tackled the case with the help of a pot of
antiseptic ointment bought originally in some chemist's shop, and lint
that I made by picking a rag of linen to pieces. While visiting him for
this purpose of course I talked to him, but even then with a sense of
restraint. The truth was that already the man was hedged round with
ceremonial. Yes, this English gentleman was, as it were, guarded by a
pack of heathen priests; white-robed mystics who never left us alone.
Of course they could not understand our language, but on the other hand
they were preternaturally shrewd at reading our faces and what was
passing in our minds, as I found out from remarks that they made now
and again.</p>

<p>Thus I always had a sense of being spied on, and so, I think, did
Arkle. If I tried to talk to him about the lady Shadow, I saw their
large eyes fixed upon me and their ears, as it were, stretched out
towards me, till at length I came almost to believe that after all they
understood or guessed the meaning of every word I uttered. This did not
tend to promote candid conversation, indeed it was paralysing, and at
last reduced me to prattling about the weather or other trivial
subjects.</p>

<p>At last I could bear no more, and taking advantage of the temporary
absence of the priest on guard, for I guessed that he had only retired
behind a mat curtain, I said outright, "Tell me, Mr. Arkle, if you like
this kind of life. You seem to me to be a prisoner in all except name,
though they call you a chief. Do you think such a position right for a
white man of your upbringing?"</p>

<p>"No, I don't, Quatermain," he answered with vigour. "I hate the
business, but I tell you that I am a man under a spell. I see you
smile, yet it is true. Years ago it began with those dreams in London.
Then I kissed, you know whom, down by that lake, and the spell became a
madness. Lastly I swore allegiance to her and all the rest of it that
night upon the platform yonder, and the madness became a fate. I am
bound by chains that cannot be broken, this chieftainship is one that
you can see; but there are others--and that's the end--or the
beginning."</p>

<p>"Do you wish to break them?" I asked.</p>

<p>"My reason does, but my spirit, or my heart, or whatever you choose
to call it, does not. I must win that woman, even if it costs me my
life; if I do not I shall go mad."</p>

<p>"Forgive me," I answered, "but don't you think that in a way it may
cost you more than your life: that is, your honour?"</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" he asked.</p>

<p>"I mean that like all of us you were brought up with certain
traditions and, as you have told me, in a certain faith; in short, you
are a white man. Now a love-affair with a woman who has other
traditions and who is of another faith, or even a marriage is well
enough sometimes--as Saint Paul points out. But this business is bigger
than that, for in practice you must adopt <i>her</i> traditions and
<i>her</i> faith and give the lie to your own. Further, you don't know
what these are or where they will lead you. Remember, she warned you
herself, for I heard her before that altar."</p>

<p>"No, Quatermain, I don't know, and she did warn me. But I took the
oath all the same and I've got to keep it; moreover, I wish to keep it,
for love sanctifies everything, doesn't it? And if ever a man was in
love, I am."</p>

<p>"That's an old argument," I said, "and I am not sure. For love means
passion and passion is a blind leader of the blind."</p>

<p>Here my wise remarks were cut short by the re-entry of the priest,
who I was quite sure had been listening through the mat curtain and
making out all he could from the tone of our voices. He was accompanied
by Kumpana whom I had not seen since we parted in the forest.
Remembering the trick he had played me there, and all that followed,
the sight of this old fellow looking more bland and amiable than usual
made me indignant, especially when he asked me how I was and if I and
my servant had been taking any more walks in the dark.</p>

<p>"Listen, Kumpana," I said. "You played me an evil trick when you
left us alone the other night in that thick wood, and still worse ones
afterwards, of which I will not speak. You should be ashamed of
yourself, Kumpana, seeing that I am a stranger whom you are bound to
help and not to desert as you did."</p>

<p>"I ask your pardon," he replied very courteously, "if I say that I
think it is you who should be ashamed, Lord Macumazahn, for although I
prayed you not to do so, you reviled what I hold to be holy until I was
forced to leave you to your punishment, which might have ended worse
than it did. However, you are not at all to blame, because the air of
that forest sometimes goes to the head, like strong drink, and takes
away the judgment. Therefore let us forgive each other and say no
more."</p>

<p>He spoke so courteously that I felt abashed and even humbled, for
after all he had some reason on his side; acting under influences which
I did not understand, I <i>had</i> offered insult to the spirits or
elementals, or natural forces, which he revered. So I turned the
subject by saying that Hans and I were now rested from our journey and
should be glad to say good-bye to him as soon as possible, if the
Council of the Shadow would be so kind as to help us to leave the
country.</p>

<p>"You are free to go when you will, Macumazahn," he answered, "but if
you attempt to do so before the time appointed, I warn you that it will
be at great risk to yourself."</p>

<p>"I am not afraid of risks--!" I exclaimed, and that moment Arkle
broke in, saying:</p>

<p>"For God's sake don't go, Quatermain. Stop here as long as you can,
that is, until I vanish from your sight, I mean until we are separated,
as I gather that we must be. For when this business is finished I have
to begin a new life, but until then, don't leave me to deal with war
and trouble alone."</p>

<p>Anxious as I had become now that my curiosity about Lake Mone was
satisfied by an actual sight of its waters, to get clear of these eerie
people who depressed me and of the land where even the air was so
strange and unnatural that it affected the nerves and made one behave
like a drunkard, I was touched by this appeal. I felt that there was a
struggle in the heart of Arkle between his inherited convictions, or
perhaps I should say all the impulses and associations of a man of his
race and class, and the devouring passion which possessed him for a
lovely and mystical woman, a priestess of some faith with which it was
not healthy for one of white blood to have to do.</p>

<p>Perhaps if I stayed I might yet be able to save him from this snare;
or circumstances might arise which would cut its claims. Whereas if I
went his fate was sure. One by one the barriers of civilization and
Christianity, which protected him from the inroads of primeval
instincts and engulfment in the dark superstitions surviving from the
ancient world that flourished here untouched by time, would be broken
down. He would become in fact what already he was in name, the chief of
these star-worshipping Dabanda. He would dwell upon the island with
their priestess, his country would see him no more, and at last, when
his part was played, there would be some unholy scene of sacrifice,
mayhap such a one, if Hans were right, as we had been shown beneath the
midnight moon on the waters of that lonesome mere beyond the
forest.</p>

<p>I shuddered as a vision of it rose in my mind: the drugged man,
helpless in his encircling cerements, being cast with songs and
offerings of flowers into the bottomless crater-lake, there to seek the
woman who, her day of power done, had preceded him to doom. Or there
might be other fates yet more awful, such as madness induced by
disillusionment, despair, and the impossibility of escape, or even by
long-continued terrors like those of which we had tasted in the forest.
Oh, the bait was rose-scented and set with jewels, but what of the hook
within, I wondered, I before whose eyes it did not dangle.</p>

<p>All this and more that I do not remember passed swiftly through my
mind with the result that I was about to say that I would stop and see
the business through, when suddenly the mat which hung in the door-way
of the room was thrust aside and there entered a priest conducting two
men. These men, whom I recognized at once as belonging to the farming
class of the Dabanda, prostrated themselves before Arkle, showing me
that he was now acknowledged as Chief by all the people. Then the
priest, bowing, informed him that they had a tale to tell and a message
to deliver.</p>

<p>He bade them speak, whereon the elder of the two husbandmen
said:</p>

<p>"Last evening towards sunset, O Chief and Father of the Dabanda, to
whom it is promised that he shall be the Shield of the holy Shadow and
father of the Shadow that is to be, I and my son here were tracking a
lost goat. We followed this goat into the western pass that leads
through the lip of the mountain from the holy Land to that of the
Abanda on the slopes and plains beyond.</p>

<p>"At length we caught sight of the goat near to the farther mouth of
the cleft, and ran fast to catch it before it strayed into the country
of the Abanda, whither we might not follow. The goat heard us and,
being wilful, leaped ahead, so that before we could reach it, it was
out of the mouth of the pass and into Abanda-land.</p>

<p>"Here, then, we sat on the border line, since we dared not pursue
farther, and called to the goat to return to us. It knew our voices and
was coming, when suddenly between us and it appeared armed men out of
the bushes, and at the head of them no other than Kaneke, he who has
forfeited the chieftainship and been cursed of the Engoi.</p>

<p>"'Stay still and listen,' he said, 'for if you stir we will throw
spears and kill you.' So we stood still and he went on:</p>

<p>"'I, Kaneke, of the pure blood, the Chief of the Dabanda and the
Shield of the Shadow, am now Chief of the Abanda also. Yes, I have
brought together under one rule the two peoples who were divided long
ago. Go you therefore to Kumpana, the first of the Council of the
Shadow, and say to him that he may tell it to the Shadow, that the
Abanda perish for the want of rain, which is withheld from them by the
witchcraft of the priests and Council of the Dabanda. Their crops
wither, their cows and goats give no milk, their springs dry up, and
their children are in want and like to die.'</p>

<p>"'Therefore if within six days no rain falls upon their land, I,
their chief and yours, will lead them in their thousands through the
passes of the mountain-lip, fearing no curses such as of old have held
them back, now that I, Shield to be of the Shadow, am their captain. We
will kill any that oppose us; we will kill Kumpana and the Council of
the Shadow who guide her ill; we will kill the priests of the Shadow
who are evil wizards, practisers of black magic; we will pass the
forest, not fearing the wood-dwellers; we will cross the lake, and I
will take the Shadow and make her mine, and thenceforward rule over the
two people become one again. Lastly, we will kill the white thief who
is named Wanderer, and by the people Red-Bull. Yes, we will kill him by
torture as an offering to the moon and the host of heaven, that
henceforth rain may fall without the mountain as well as within its
circle, giving plenty, so that all the people may increase and grow
fat.'</p>

<p>"'With him we will kill the white hunter named Macumazahn, because
now I know that I was made to buy him to come to this land, not to give
me help as I believed, but to work me evil and to set in my place the
thief Red-Bull; and the yellow man his servant we will also kill,
burying them alive or burning them upon the altar. None of them shall
escape us, for night and day all the passes are watched and any that
set foot outside of them shall be hunted to death for our sport, as the
thief Red-Bull would have been, had he not been saved by Macumazahn.
Now go and at this same hour on the second day return with the answer
to my message.'</p>

<p>"Then, Lords, Kaneke and those with him went away laughing together,
killing our goat as they went, and my son and I came here to deliver
the message."</p>

<p>For a while there was silence in that room. Kumpana seemed to be
perplexed; the priests were speechless with indignation; I was horribly
frightened at the prospect of the fate promised to me, and so was Hans
who all this while had been sitting on the ground behind me, smoking
and pretending to hear nothing, for he whispered:</p>

<p>"Oh, Baas, why did you ever come to this land of spooks? Why did you
not run away after you had got Kaneke's ivory? Now we shall be buried
alive. Or be grilled on that altar fire--just like buck's flesh,
Baas."</p>

<p>"If so, it won't be Kaneke who will do the grilling, that is if ever
he comes within three hundred yards of me," I answered savagely in
Dutch.</p>

<p>Then I stopped short to consider Arkle in whom I noticed a curious
change. A few minutes before he was looking troubled and unhappy, for
reasons that may be guessed. Now he had brisked up and seemed quite
cheerful, as is the way of some Anglo-Saxons (I am not one of them)
when there is the prospect of a fight.</p>

<p>"When did you say I should be able to get about as usual,
Quatermain? Was it tomorrow?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I think so, if you will keep a bandage on your heel," I said,
then was silent, for Kumpana was speaking to the peasants, telling them
to go away and rest until he sent for them.</p>

<p>When they had departed he bade the priests summon the Council of the
Shadow, which they did with marvellous rapidity, for within five
minutes they arrived in the room, six or seven old fellows. I suppose
they were hanging about outside, having scented trouble. At any rate
they appeared, bowed to Arkle and to me and sat down upon the ground.
Kumpana repeated to them the tale of the two peasants which did not
seem to surprise them; indeed they appeared to know it already. Next he
asked them what they thought should be done, and they gave various
replies which I scarcely understood, because they all talked together
and very fast, using terms that were not familiar to me. Nor in fact
did Kumpana appear to pay much attention to what they said, which gave
me the idea that this asking of their advice was more or less of a
formality. When they had finished he turned to Arkle and with much
deference inquired his views.</p>

<p>"Oh, fight the beast--I mean Kaneke," answered Arkle with emphasis,
adding, "but first ask Macumazahn there; he is a wise man and has seen
many things."</p>

<p>So Kumpana repeated his question, inquiring of me whether I also
held that we should fight.</p>

<p>"Certainly not, if you can do anything else," I replied, "for you
are few and the Abanda are many. They say that they want rain and I
have heard you declare that you, or some of you, can cause rain to
fall. If this is true, do so. Give the Abanda as much water as they
want and there will be no war."</p>

<p>This I said not because I believed that the priests or the Shadow,
or anyone else, could break the drought and bring rain from the heavens
upon the parched fields of the Abanda, but because I wanted to hear
Kumpana's views upon the suggestion. To my surprise he accepted it with
great respect, saying that the plan was good and worthy of
consideration and that it should be submitted to the Engoi--that is to
the Lady Shadow--for her decision.</p>

<p>"Do you mean that she can give the Abanda rain if she chooses?"</p>

<p>"Certainly," he answered with an air of mild astonishment, "at any
time and in any quantity."</p>

<p>Then I collapsed, for what is the use of arguing with cranks or
lunatics, although of course I knew that many natives hold similar
beliefs as to the powers of their rain-makers.</p>

<p>Now, to my surprise Hans took up his parable. Squatted there upon
the floor, he said in a brazen fashion:</p>

<p>"The Baas thinks himself wise, you all think yourselves wise, but
Hans is much wiser than any of you. This is what you should do. Kaneke
is the post that holds up the roof of the Abanda house. They dare to
offer to fight you and to say that they will take away your priestess
who lives in the lake, because Kaneke, whom they believe to be your
real chief and high-priest with a right to the Lake Lady, has become
their captain, so they are no longer afraid of you or of the curses of
your Engoi. Kill Kaneke and once more they will be afraid of you, for
without him they dare not invade your land which they have always held
to be holy."</p>

<p>"And how are we to kill Kaneke?" asked Kumpana.</p>

<p>"Oh, that is easy. When those two men take your answer--unless the
Baas would rather do it himself--I will go with them and hide behind a
stone, or disguise myself as a Dabanda . . ."</p>

<p>Here Kumpana looked at Hans and shook his head.</p>

<p>". . . then when Kaneke comes to listen I will shoot him dead; that
is all and there will be no more trouble."</p>

<p>On hearing this cold-blooded proposition Kumpana expressed doubts as
to whether Kaneke could be disposed of in this way. It seemed to be his
idea that a priest of the Engoi could only meet his end in certain
fashions which he did not specify, and he added that had it been
possible for him to die otherwise, Kaneke would have done so before,
especially not long ago when he had tried to seize the Shadow, and
afterwards. However, he was prepared to consider Hans' suggestion which
did not seem to shock him in the least.</p>

<p>Having collected all our views Kumpana announced coolly that he
would now lay them before the Engoi and learn that celestial
potentate's will through the mouth of its earthly incarnation and
minister, the Shadow. Of course, I thought that he meant to pay a visit
to the island in the lake and remembering the riddle of those ancient
buildings which I yearned to explore, I began to wonder if I could not
persuade him to allow me to be his companion on the trip, though it is
true that I had no liking for another midnight journey through that
forest.</p>

<p>But not a bit of it. His methods were very different. Suddenly he
commanded silence and ordered extra mats to be hung over the door-way
and window-places, so that the room became almost dark. Then he sat
down on the floor, the two priests kneeling on either side of him,
while the Council of the Shadow, also sitting on the ground and holding
one another's hands made a circle round the three of them. Hans, who,
scenting spooks showed a strong disposition to bolt. I and--as I was
relieved to observe--Arkle remained outside this circle playing the
part for audience.</p>

<p>"By Jove," thought I to myself, for I did not dare open my lips, "we
are in for a s&eacute;ance."</p>

<p>A s&eacute;ance it was. Yes, there in Central Africa a
s&eacute;ance, or something uncommonly like it, which once more caused
me to remember the saying of wise old Solomon, that there is no new
thing under the sun. Doubtless for tens of thousands of years there
have been s&eacute;ances among almost every people of the earth,
civilized and savage, or at any rate similar gatherings having for
their object consultation with spirits or other powers of which
ordinary men know nothing.</p>

<p>The priests said some prayer in archaic language which I did not
understand, if indeed they understood it themselves. I gathered,
however, that it was an invocation. Then the circle began to sing a low
and solemn hymn, Kumpana seated in the centre keeping time to the chant
with motions of his hands and head. By degrees these motions grew
fainter, till at last his chin sank upon his breast and he went into a
deep trance or sleep.</p>

<p>Then I understood. Kumpana was what in spiritualistic parlance is
called a medium. Doubtless, I reflected, it was because of this gift of
his which enabled him to put himself in communication, real or fancied,
with intelligences that are not of the earth and with human beings at a
distance, also to exercise clairvoyant faculties, that he had risen to
the high estate of President of the Council of the Shadow, the real
governing body of the land. Afterwards I found that I was quite right
in this supposition, for Kumpana was humble by birth and not a member
of one of the priestly families; yet owing to his uncanny powers he
outdistanced them all and in fact was the ruler of the Dabanda. The
chief of the tribe was but an executive officer who acted upon the
advice of the Council and in due course became the husband of the
Shadow of the day, destined to the dreadful fate of dying with her when
the Council so decreed.</p>

<p>As for the Shadow herself, she was nothing but an oracle, the Voice
of some dim divinity through whom the commands of that divinity were
made known to the Council, which interpreted them as it pleased, if
indeed it did not inspire them as even then I suspected. The priests,
by comparison, played a small part in the constitution of this State.
For it was a State in miniature, the survival and remnant, I imagine,
of what once had been a strong and in its way highly civilized
community, whose principal gods were the moon and the planets (not the
sun, so far as I could learn), one that had owed any greatness it might
possess to its religious reputation and alleged magical powers, rather
than to strength in war.</p>

<p>Therefore in the end it had gone down before the fighting peoples,
as in this carnal world the spirit so often does in its struggle with
the flesh, for as someone remarked, I think it was Napoleon, Providence
is, or seems to be, on the side of the big battalions. These priests, I
should add, in addition to attending to the religious rites and
offerings before the altar, were the learned men and doctors of the
tribe. It was they who studied the stars, drawing horoscopes and
reading omens in them, not without some knowledge; for I have reason to
believe that they could predict eclipses with tolerable accuracy. Also
they kept records, though whether these were in any kind of writing, or
merely by means of signs, I am sorry to say I was never able to
ascertain, because on this point their secrecy was strict.</p>

<p>This is all I could discover, during my brief sojourn among them, as
to the mystical religion of the Dabanda, if religion it can be called,
of which I was now witnessing one of the manifestations.</p>

<p>After Kumpana had sunk into his trace the chant continued for a
considerable time, growing fainter by degrees till at length it seemed
to come from very far away like distant music heard across the sea. At
least that was the effect it produced upon me, one as I think, of a
semi-hypnotic character, for undoubtedly this hymn had a mesmeric
power. At any rate, either owing to it or to the gloom and closeness of
that room, I fell into a kind of bodily torpor which left my mind
extremely active, as happens to us when we dream.</p>

<p>In my imagination I seemed to see a shadowy Kumpana standing before
the beautiful woman upon whom I had looked on the altar platform, and
speaking to her in some great dim hall.</p>

<p>She listened; then stood a while with outstretched hands and
upturned eyes, like one who waits for inspiration. At last it came, for
tremblings ran up and down her limbs, a slight convulsion shook her
face, her eyes rolled and grew wild; the pythoness was possessed of her
spirit or familiar. Then her lips moved rapidly as though from them
were pouring a flood of words, and the fancy faded.</p>

<p>Of course it was nothing but a dream induced by my surroundings and
some heavy perfume, which I forgot to say, unseen by me, evidently the
priests had sprinkled or scattered about the room. Yet probably this
dream represented faithfully enough what took place when the oracle was
consulted, for whether such ceremonies occurred in ancient Greece or
are practised by the witch-doctors or diviners of Africa, there is much
similarity in their methods.</p>

<p>I woke up, Kumpana woke up, everybody woke up. (Both Arkle and Hans
told me afterwards that, like myself, they went to sleep and dreamed
dreams.) The old seer yawned, rubbed his eyes, stretched himself and
said quietly that he had received full directions from the Engoi as to
what was to be done to meet the danger which threatened the Dabanda,
but what those directions might be he declined to reveal. Then he sent
for the two husbandmen and, pointing to one of the priests, said to
them:</p>

<p>"Return to the Western pass with this man, and tomorrow at sunset,
be at that spot where Kaneke spoke with you. If he comes again or sends
messengers, as he will, say that his words have been delivered to the
Engoi, and that this is the answer: 'Remember that you are accursed, O
traitor Kaneke. Take what road you will, but learn that every one of
them leads you to the grave.' Say also that the rain which the people
of the Abanda demand shall fall upon them in plenty, for the time of
drought is done. Let them be content therewith and know that if any of
them dare to follow Kaneke into the land of the Holy Lake, a curse
shall fall upon them also, such a curse as has not been told of among
them or their fathers. Add these words: 'O Kaneke, the Engoi reads your
heart. You do not seek rain to make fruitful the fields of the Abanda.
You seek the Shadow. Kaneke, for you that Shadow has faded; for you she
is dead. She whom you strove to bear away is dead and there awaits you
only the fate of one who has slain the Shadow.'"</p>

<p>This cryptic message Kumpana caused the two peasants, also the
priest who was to accompany them, to repeat twice. When he was sure
that they had it by heart to the last word, he sent them away without
any ceremony, as though he attached no particular importance to their
mission.</p>

<p>Now I could no longer suppress my irritation, or rather my wrath. I
was most heartily sick of the whole affair. I saw that there was going
to be fighting of some sort in which no doubt I should be expected to
take part, and I did not want to fight. What had I to do with this
ancient quarrel between two long-separated sections of a tribe, who
were at loggerheads over the possession of a priestess supposed to be
gifted with powers as a rainmaker?</p>

<p>Moreover, the moral atmosphere of the place was unwholesome and
jarred upon me. African customs of the more recondite sort and ancient
superstitions are very interesting, but I could have too much of them,
especially if certain, as I was, that behind their outward
harmlessness, lies hid some red heart of secret cruelty. I wanted to
get out of the place before that cruelty became manifest, or before
something horrible happened to me--with Arkle if possible, but if he
would not come, without him.</p>

<p>To tell the truth I was frightened. I suppose that my dreams in the
forest and the occurrences of this s&eacute;ance, if I may so call it,
had got upon my nerves, just as old Zikali used to do in the Black
Kloof. I have always believed that there are forces round us which our
senses do not appreciate, secret doors in the natural boundary wall of
life that most of us never find, though to them some may have the key.
But I also believe that it is most dangerous and unwholesome to come
into touch with those forces, or to peep through those doors when they
are opened by others. Here in Dabanda-land, however, they always stood
ajar, or so I imagined, and through them came experiences and what Hans
called "spooks", which thrust themselves upon the attention of those
who did not desire their company. In short I wished to be gone back to
a wholesome, everyday existence and never to see or hear anything more
of Lake Mone, its priestess, or her votaries.</p>

<p>"Kumpana," I said, "is there to be a war between your people and the
Abanda?"</p>

<p>"Yes," he answered with a slow and rather creepy smile, "there is to
be war--of a sort."</p>

<p>"Then I want to have nothing to do with it. Kumpana, I want to get
out of your country at once; risks or no risks, I wish to be off."</p>

<p>"I fear that is impossible, Lord Macumazahn," he answered. "Have you
not heard the word of the Engoi that the drought which has endured
beyond the mountain for three years is at an end? That word is true;
great storms are coming up through which you could not travel. The rain
would stop you even if you escaped the spears of the Abanda. Moreover,"
he added quickly before I could express disbelief in the arrival of
these storms, and with a faint sneer, "we have been told that the Lord
Macumazahn is a very brave man, one who loves fighting."</p>

<p>"Then you have been told a lie. Also, who told you?"</p>

<p>"That does not matter. We know more about you than you think,
Macumazahn. Also we have been told that you accepted payment from
Kaneke to come to this country and not to leave it until the object of
your coming was accomplished, payment in ivory and gold; and we
believed, Lord Macumazahn, that you were a very honest man who always
fulfilled your promises, especially when your services had been
bought."</p>

<p>Here Arkle, to his credit, intervened sharply, saying:</p>

<p>"Be silent, Kumpana. Would you insult your guest--?"</p>

<p>"Thank you, Arkle," I broke in in English, "but I can look after
myself. He will only tell you that you are now the Chief of his people
and that I am your guest, not his."</p>

<p>Then addressing Kumpana in his own language, I went on.</p>

<p>"You have been misinformed. I never pretended to great courage,
especially in wars that do not concern me. For the rest my bargain was
to accompany Kaneke to his country, not to fight battles there, as I
could prove to you if you were able to read my language. This Kaneke
who was to be your chief, said that he could not travel here without
me, which is true, for had it not been for me and Hans he would never
have started. Further, had it not been for us he would have been killed
by the Abanda who were hunting the white lord who is now your chief. So
I came, not for that reason but because he paid me, for in such
fashions I earn my living. Yet I should not have come for this cause
alone. I had another. It was that I had heard of your holy lake and a
little of your people and their customs, and being curious in such
matters I desired to look upon the one and to study the others for
myself--"</p>

<p>"Which things you have done to your heart's content," broke in
Kumpana.</p>

<p>"Still," I went on not heeding him, "never shall it be said that I,
Macumazahn, took pay that I did not earn to the full. Therefore I will
take my share in your war, doing all that is asked of me as best I can,
especially as I have a score to settle with this Kaneke, who by his
treachery brought my two servants to their death. Only I demand your
promise and that of the Council of the Shadow and that of the white
lord who has now become your chief against my counsel, that when this
war is finished, I and my servant shall be allowed to depart at once in
peace and with such help as you can give me."</p>

<p>"It is yours, Lord, we swear it by the Engoi!" exclaimed Kumpana in
a humble voice and with the air of one who is ashamed of himself.
"Pardon my words if they offended you, for know that as to your love of
fighting I have but repeated what your servant Hans told me, and for
the rest I learned it from Kaneke."</p>

<p>"Whom you have proved to be a traitor and a liar," I said
angrily.</p>

<p>Then I turned to Arkle and asked him whether he also gave me his
promise that I should be allowed to go when the war was ended.</p>

<p>"Of course, if you wish it," he answered in English, "though I hoped
that you would stop here with us a while. The truth is, Quatermain,
that I shall be very lonely without you," he added with a sigh, which I
thought pathetic, knowing all it meant.</p>

<p>"Then why do you stay here?" I asked bluntly.</p>

<p>"Because I must; because it is my fate; because I am under a charm
that may not be broken. Also, Quatermain, do you not understand" (this
he said rapidly and in a low voice) "that if I were to break my oaths,
or try to--which I cannot--I should not live another day?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Arkle, I understand and I am sorry," I replied, and, bowing to
them all, left the house.</p>

<p>"Baas," said Hans outside, "do you remember that trap of willow-rods
I made once to catch eels" (he meant barbel mudfish) "down on the
Tugela when we could get nothing else to eat? It was a very good trap,
Baas, for when the eel had pushed its way in, the willow rods shut up
behind it, so that it could not get out again, and afterwards we ate
it. This land is a trap like that, and the Baas Red-Bull is the eel and
the Shadow lady is the bait, and by and by I think these spook people
will cook and eat him."</p>

<p>I shivered at Hans' suggestive illustrations, and answered:</p>

<p>"Look out that they do not cook and eat us too."</p>

<p>"Oh no, Baas, they won't do that because they haven't found the
right bait to catch you. Luckily there are not two Shadow-ladies, Baas,
and the trap is no good without the right bait."</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<h1><a name="c017">CHAPTER XVII</a></h1>

<br>


<h1>THE GREAT STORM</h1>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>That evening clouds like to those of a monsoon began to bank up over
lake-land and all the country round so far as the eye could see.</p>

<p>"That Shadow-lady is a very good rain-doctoress, Baas," said Hans.
"You remember Kumpana said that she promised rain to those Abanda who
have had none for three years, or very little. Now I think that they
are going to get plenty."</p>

<p>"Then perhaps they won't make war," I answered indifferently.</p>

<p>Certainly the weather was very peculiar. The heat, which had been
considerable for some days before, now grew intense; I should imagine
that on this particular evening it must have risen to 108 or 110
degrees in the shade. Moreover it was of a most oppressive character;
the air was so thick that I felt as though I were breathing cream and I
could not make the slightest effort without bursting into profuse
perspiration.</p>

<p>There I lay upon my bed stripped to the shirt in the best draught
that I could find, which was none at all, and gasped like a fish out of
water, praying that the storm would burst and bring coolness. In the
lady Shadow's powers I had no faith. I was quite certain, however, that
Kumpana and the other old men were well acquainted with the signs of
the local weather, and knew that it was about to undergo a general
break after the long drought. Hence the prophecy so confidently
announced by the Council. This drought, for some reason which I cannot
explain, never affected the crater area unduly, for the Dabanda had
just gathered in an excellent harvest.</p>

<p>Hans, who like most Hottentots was quite indifferent to heat, went
out into the town to prospect and returned saying that the people
showed considerable alarm. Some were looking to the roofs of their
houses, while others were driving their stock into caves and sheltered
places, or carrying home the last of the harvest in baskets, even the
children, of whom there were not many, being pressed into this service.
The priests, too, he said, were engaged in building a kind of palm-leaf
tent over the altar on the stone platform, presumably to prevent the
rain from putting out the fire, which it seemed had always burned there
from time immemorial.</p>

<p>The night came, a night of dreadful heat in which I could not sleep
a wink, or do anything except swallow quantities of water mixed with
the juice of a sub-acid, plum-like fruit that grew wild in the crater,
which made an astringent and most refreshing drink. The dawn that
followed was as dark as that of a November day in London, but as yet
there was no rain nor any lifting of the heavy silence.</p>

<p>After eating, or pretending to eat, I crept across to the Chief's
house, to be informed by a priest outside that I could not be admitted,
as the lord Wanderer was engaged with the Council. I took the hint and
went home again, feeling sure that the plan was to cut me off from
Arkle over whom my influence was feared. It almost seemed as though
Kumpana and his companions were psychological experts, if that is the
right description, who could read what was passing in the minds of
others. Indeed, I began to believe that although they could not
understand our words when we spoke in English in their presence, they
understood the drift of them, also that I wished to persuade him to
shake off their shackles and get out of their clutches.</p>

<p>Why were they so anxious to keep him here? I wondered. I wonder
still. Doubtless there was some overwhelming reason which they would
not reveal. As I do today, I inclined to the view that mainly they were
actuated by ambition. They, a dwindling, superstition-ridden race,
desired once more to become a power in their world. To accomplish this
they must add to their number, which could only be done by
incorporating the thousands of the virile Abanda under the rule of a
man of force and ability who understood the arts of civilization. This
to my mind is why Arkle was brought to Mone-land, tempted by the bait
of the beautiful woman called Shadow to whom he had been so
mysteriously drawn.</p>

<p>That is the best explanation which I can offer; not a very
satisfactory one, I admit, because it presupposes that this lady Shadow
could impress her personality upon him from a great distance, as he
alleged that she had done, and also some knowledge of the future on the
part of her priests and advisers. Or mayhap these were only acting upon
the dictates of some ancient prophecy of a sort that is common enough
among the more mystical of the African peoples, although such
prophecies rarely come to the knowledge of Europeans, save in forms too
obscure and tangled to be understood by them. The same reason, if to a
less degree, made them so anxious that I should visit their country for
a while. They wanted to pick my brains as to our system of government
and the rest, which indeed they did upon every opportunity, although I
have not recorded their questions. They were a little, buried folk,
which its astute rulers, especially that very clever man Kumpana,
desired to build up again into a nation. This, I believe, was the true
key to the secret of all their plottings.</p>

<p>When I got back I found men strengthening the roof of my house and
others digging a trench round it, connecting it with a sluice or
water-course not far away, which showed me what they expected in the
way of a storm. I went indoors and tried to take a nap, but could not
because of curious noises that I was unable to explain and felt too
languid to investigate.</p>

<p>Towards sunset Kumpana came to see me. Although I received him
somewhat coldly he was very polite. Having inspected the arrangements
for the protection of the house, he apologized for having sneered at me
on the previous day, saying that he did it for a reason and not because
he believed that I was a coward or had taken pay for which I did not
intend to give consideration. This reason, he explained frankly, was
that he knew I should get angry and promise to stop with them till the
end of the war, and that having once given my word I should not break
it.</p>

<p>I sat amazed at his cunning, which showed so deep a knowledge of
human nature and such insight into my character, but I really was too
hot to argue with him. Then, leaving the subject quickly, he begged me
not to go out, as the storm might begin at any minute, and also for
another cause.</p>

<p>"You are wondering what the strange sounds you hear may mean," he
said. "Come up to the roof of the house and I will show you."</p>

<p>As I have said I had heard such sounds, which I thought were like to
those of the galloping of herds of cattle, mixed with grunts and
bellowings. When I reached the roof I saw whence they came. On either
side of the town enormous numbers of every kind of game were rushing
towards the forest, doubtless to shelter there from the approaching
tempest. There were elands, hartebeest, gnus, sable-antelope, oryx,
buffaloes, quaggas, and a host of smaller animals, all possessed by
fear and all galloping towards the trees.</p>

<p>"These beasts understand what is coming," said Kumpana, "and are mad
with terror. They will not hurt us Dabanda because they know us, and,
as you have seen, we have power over them; but if they smelt you, a
stranger, they would toss and trample you."</p>

<p>I admitted that it was very probable, and stood a while staring at
this, the strangest sight, perhaps, that I have seen in all my
experience as a hunter. Presently I turned to descend, but Kumpana bade
me wait a while if I would see something still more strange.</p>

<p>As he spoke I heard a sound which I could not mistake: that of an
elephant trumpeting shrilly.</p>

<p>"I thought you told me that all the elephants had been driven out of
Mone-land," I said, astonished.</p>

<p>"So I did, Lord," answered Kumpana, "but it seems that they have
come back again, flying before the great storm or earthquakes for
shelter to the country where some of them were bred generations ago,
before we sent them away."</p>

<p>As he spoke, emerging from a cloud of dust to the right of the town
there appeared an enormous bull elephant running rapidly, and behind it
many others. I knew the beast at once by its size, the grey markings on
its trunk and forehead, and certain peculiarities of its huge tusks. It
was the king-elephant with which we had experienced so curious an
adventure upon the mound in the midst of the plain that Kaneke had
called the gathering-place of elephants; the very beast which we had
seen being greeted by the countless company of its fellows, which, too,
with them, had afterwards pursued us back to our camp. Its appearance
here was so marvellous, so utterly unexpected even in that eerie land
of strange happenings, that really I turned quite faint. As for Hans,
who was beside me, he sank down in a heap, muttering:</p>

<p>"<i>Allemagter!</i> Baas, here is that ugly old devil which threw
Little Holes and Jerry into the pool and nearly blew my stomach out. He
has come after us, Baas, and all is finished."</p>

<p>"Not yet," I answered as quietly as I could. "Also perhaps he has
come after someone else."</p>

<p>Then I turned and watched the majestic creature rush past the town,
followed by a great number of others, between fifty and seventy, I
should say; all of them, I noted, mature bulls, for not a cow or a
half-grown beast could I see among them.</p>

<p>Kumpana seemed to understand my wonder at this circumstance and
without its being explained to him, for he said:</p>

<p>"These elephants are the bulls that were bred in this country long
years ago in our fathers' days, and have now returned to their home.
The cows and all their progeny have gone elsewhere, and indeed we did
not need them."</p>

<p>"What do you mean by that?" I asked sharply, but he pretended not to
hear me, or at any rate he made no answer.</p>

<p>When the herd of elephants had thundered past and, following all the
other creatures, had vanished into the forest, we descended from the
roof into the house, where Kumpana began to say farewell, cautioning me
not to leave its shelter until the coming storm was over.</p>

<p>"Wait a minute," I said. "Where is the white lord, your new
Chief?"</p>

<p>"In his own place where he must stay, Macumazahn," he answered.</p>

<p>"I perceive that you wish to separate us," I said again.</p>

<p>"Perhaps for a while, Macumazahn, for the good of both of you. You,
for your part, wish to separate him from us which, though it is natural
enough, may not be. The white lord has sworn himself to the Dweller in
the Lake and must abide with her and us. Should he try to break his
oath, he would be slain; and should you tempt him to do so, you would
be slain also. Therefore it is best that you should remain apart till
this war is accomplished."</p>

<p>"Is it certain that there will be a war?" I asked, "and, if so,
when?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Lord, I think there will be a war of men after that of heaven
is finished," and he pointed towards the sky, "for Kaneke will surely
strive to win back all that he has lost. In that war, Lord, you will be
called upon to take your share, though perhaps it will not be such a
one as you expect. When the time comes I will wait upon you, and now
farewell, for the great storm is at hand and I must seek shelter while
it rages."</p>

<p>When he had gone I talked to Hans about the arrival of the
mysterious old elephant and its herd, which upset him very much, for he
answered:</p>

<p>"I tell you, Baas, that these beasts are not elephants; they are men
bewitched by the Dabanda wizards, and, Baas, there is something
terrible going to happen in this accursed land."</p>

<p>As he spoke "something terrible" began to happen, for the dense air
was filled with a moaning sound, the exact like of which I had never
heard before, caused, I suppose, by wind that as yet we did not feel,
stirring in the tops of the trees of the vast forest. It was as though
all the misery in the wide world had gathered and was giving utterance
to its pain and sorrows in prolonged, half-stifled groans.</p>

<p>"The ghosts are flying over us, Baas," began Hans, but he did not
finish his sentence, for at that moment the solid ground began to heave
beneath our feet. It heaved slowly in a sickening fashion that made my
vitals writhe within me and threw to the floor articles from some rough
shelves which Hans had made.</p>

<p>"Earthquake! Out you go before the roof comes down!" I exclaimed to
Hans, quite unnecessary advice in his case, for he was already through
the door-way. I followed, running across the little garden to the open
space where there was nothing to fall upon us. Here I was brought to a
standstill, for another prolonged heave threw me to the ground where I
thought it safer to remain, praying that it would not open and swallow
me.</p>

<p>"Look!" said Hans at my side, pointing to one of the two column-like
towers whence the Dabanda astrologers observed the stars, or rather at
what had been the tower, for as he spoke it bowed gracefully towards
us, as did the forest trees, as though they were making an obeisance.
Then down it fell with a crash--which, however, we could not hear
because of the moaning sound that I have described.</p>

<p>The heaving ceased; that earthquake went by, and with it the
moaning, which was succeeded by an intense and awful silence. It was
now the hour of sunset and the air seemed to be alight with a red glow
like to that of molten iron, though the sun itself could not be seen.
This glow, in which everything appeared monstrous and distorted,
suddenly broke up into great flakes of furious colour, which to my
fancy resembled wide-winged and fantastic creatures, such as haunted
the earth in the reptile age, only infinitely larger, flitting away
into the darkness overhead.</p>

<p>These shapes departed on rainbow-tinted wings and the darkness fell,
a palpable thing, a mass of solid night stretching from earth to
heaven. A minute later this inky blackness ceased to be, for it was
changed to fire. All space was filled with lightnings, not here and
there only, but everywhere those lightnings blazed, and in the glare of
them we could see for miles and miles. They seemed to be striking all
about us. Thus I saw trees collapse and vanish in clouds of dust, and a
great rock that lay not far off shatter to pieces. By common consent we
rose and ran back to the house, and as we passed its door came the
thunder.</p>

<p>I have listened to much thunder of the African brand during my
roving life, but over it all that of Lake Mone can claim supremacy.
Never have I heard its equal. Some thunder cracks, like a million rifle
shots, some roars like the greatest guns, and some rolls and mutters.
This did all three, and at once; moreover, the cliffs of the huge
crater in which the Dabanda lived caused it to echo backwards and
forwards, multiplying the volume of its sound. The general effect was
fearsome and overwhelming; combined with that of simultaneous and
continual lightnings it crushed the mind.</p>

<p>Through the tumult I was aware of Hans staring at me with a
terrified countenance which the blue gleam of the flashes had turned
livid, and heard him shouting out something about Judgment Day, a quite
unnecessary reminder, as my own thoughts were already fixed upon that
event, which almost I believed to be at hand. I do not know for how
long we endured this awful demonstration of Nature at her worst,
because I grew bewildered and could take no count of time, but at
length the turmoil lessened somewhat and the flashes blazed at longer
intervals. Then, just as I hoped that the storm was passing, the rain,
or rather the water-spout, began. Seldom have I seen such rain; it fell
in a sheet and with an incessant roar for hours.</p>

<p>Our house had stood the shakings of the earthquake, which still
continued at intervals, because its walls were made of tree-trunks
plastered over, and therefore being non-rigid, gave to the shock. But
these had cracked the roof in two places, with the result, of course,
that the water poured into the building, so that soon we were half
flooded. Indeed had not the cement-like mixture, as yet not firmly set,
which had been poured on to the roof that day to strengthen it, been
driven into those cracks, and closed them, I think that we should have
been washed out of the house. But luckily this happened and we only
experienced great discomfort. Luckily, too, our beds stood upon a kind
of raised platform, so that the water did not reach them and we were
able to lie down, and after the earth-tremors ceased, at last to
sleep.</p>

<p>When I woke daylight, of a sort, had come and it was raining less
heavily. Throwing a skin rug over my head, I climbed to the roof, and
beheld a scene of desolation. All the country was more or less under
water, some of the houses of the town had been shaken down by the
earthquake or washed away, and many of the forest trees were shattered
by lightning.</p>

<p>The open place on which stood the stone platform was a lake, and the
shelter which had been erected to protect the fire upon the altar was
crushed or shaken flat, having as we learned afterwards, extinguished
the fire, to the great consternation of the Dabanda people and
especially of their priests. Moreover, although there was less rain
falling within the crater-ring, over the country beyond, as the sky
there showed, it was pouring as heavily as ever. Also new thunderstorms
were in progress far away.</p>

<p>For three days this miserable weather continued, marked by
constantly recurring tempests beyond the borders of Mone-land, and a
few more slight shocks of earthquake. During all this time Hans and I
scarcely left the house, nor were we visited by anyone, except the
women who waited on us and brought us food. With great courage these
women stuck to their duty through everything, and from them we learned
that all the people were terrified, for no such tempest was told of in
their annals.</p>

<p>On the fourth morning old Kumpana appeared, looking as calm as ever.
He told us that, so far as they could learn, no one had been killed in
Mone-land which, as the crops had been harvested, had taken little
harm. Reports reached them, however, that the Abanda who lived on the
outer slopes of the mountains and plains beyond had suffered terribly.
Some had been drowned by the torrents which rushed down the hillsides,
and some crushed in their houses that, owing to their lack of timber,
were largely built of stone, and therefore were overthrown by the
earthquake. Also such crops as they had, which ripened later than those
in Mone-land, were flattened and destroyed.</p>

<p>I remarked that all these misfortunes must have taken the heart out
of them, with the result that they would probably give up the idea of
making war, especially as they had now got all the rain they
wanted.</p>

<p>"Not so," answered Kumpana, "for they need food of which they know
there is plenty in our country and nowhere else. Tomorrow, Lord, we
shall ask you to march with us to fight them."</p>

<p>"Where?" I inquired.</p>

<p>"I am not sure, Lord. The order that we have received is that we
should march to the western pass. Doubtless when we come to it, other
orders will reach us, telling us what we must do."</p>

<p>"Whose orders?" I asked, exasperated. "Those of your new Chief?"</p>

<p>"No, Lord, those of the Engoi which come to us through the air."</p>

<p>"Oh," I exclaimed, "do they? And does your Chief, the Wanderer, come
with us to this battle?"</p>

<p>"No, Lord, he stays to guard the town. Now I must bid you farewell
as there is much to do. Tomorrow, when it is time to march, I will send
for you."</p>

<p>"Well, I'm blessed!" I said as the door closed behind him.</p>

<p>"No, Baas," said Hans, "not blessed; another word, Baas, which your
reverend father would never let me speak. As he used to say, Baas, the
world is full of wonders and it is nice to see as many of them as one
can before we go to the place where there is nothing but fire, like
there was here the other night when the storm burst. This will be a
very funny war, Baas, in which the orders reach the generals through
the air and they don't know what they are going to do until they get
them. That war will be a fine thing to think about afterwards, Baas,
when we are back in Durban or in the Place of Fires, whichever it may
be."</p>

<p>"Stop your ugly mouth and listen," I said. "I mean to get out of
this hole. We are going to march to the western pass; well, I shall run
through it and desert."</p>

<p>"Yes, Baas, and leave the guns and everything else behind, and be
killed by the Abanda on the other side, or lose our way and starve if
we escape them. Well, it will be soon over, Baas, and we shan't have a
long journey to make this time."</p>

<p>So he went on, talking sound enough sense in his silly, topsy-turvy
idioms, but I paid no more heed to him.</p>

<p>So sick and tired was I of the whole business that I did not care
what happened. I would just go as the wind took me, hoping that it
would blow me out of Mone-land as soon as possible. If it were fated
otherwise I could not help it and there was nothing more to be
said.</p>

<p>That day I made yet another effort to see Arkle, but when we had
tramped through the mud to the Chief's house, it was only to find it
guarded by soldiers, who politely turned us back. Then understanding
that a wall had been built between him and me which I could not climb,
I returned and wrote up my diary. Those pages of smudged pencil, by
help of which I indite this record, are before me now and their
language is so lurid that it is difficult to believe they were written
by a man as temperate in all things, and especially on paper, as
myself.</p>

<p>That night some solemn ceremony took place on the altar platform, to
which I was not asked and, I think, should not have attended if I had
been. I believe that it had to do with the relighting of the fire, for
from our roof we saw this blaze up suddenly. It was witnessed by a
great number of people, Arkle among them, for Hans caught sight of him
arrayed in Dabanda dress and escorted by priests with torches.</p>

<p>It distressed me to think of him playing the part of a high-priest
among these uncanny other-world kind of folk, but like the rest, there
it was and could not be helped.</p>

<p>The religious function, for I supposed it to be religious, was
accompanied by much melancholy music and many songs, also by
drum-beating, which I had not heard before. It went on for a long while
and ended with a torchlight procession back to the town.</p>

<p>After we had breakfasted next morning, Kumpana arrived, accompanied
by a guard of thirty spearmen, and remarked casually, just as though an
evening party were concerned, that if we were ready, it was time to
start to the war. I replied in an airy fashion that, being impatient
for battle, I had been waiting for him, for I wished to give him the
impression that I was pawing the ground with eagerness, like the
warhorse in the Book of Job.</p>

<p>He smiled and said he was glad to hear it and that he hoped I should
remain in the same mind, adding that he knew I could run fast from the
rate at which I entered Mone-land.</p>

<p>I reflected to myself that this would be nothing compared with the
rate at which I should leave it, if I got the chance, but contented
myself with inquiring who would look after our possessions while we
were away. He replied that they would be removed to a hiding-place and
well cared for; which left me wondering whether they would ever come
out of it again.</p>

<p>So off we went, closely surrounded by the guard, two soldiers
carrying our spare rifles, ammunition, and necessary kit. As we marched
through the town where I saw women, but no men, repairing the damage
done to the houses and gardens by the storm, a girl pushed through the
soldiers and gave me a note. It was from Arkle and read:</p>

<p> </p>

<blockquote>
<p><i>My Dear Quatermain,</i></p>

<p><i>Don't misjudge me, as I fear you must. I cannot go with you. It
is impossible, for reasons you would scarcely understand. Also if I
could, my foot is not well enough yet. Whatever you see, do not be
astonished, for these Dabanda are not as other people and play their
own game, which is dark and difficult to follow. Above all, don't try
to escape. It would only mean your death and that of Hans.</i></p>
</blockquote>

<p> </p>

<p>That was all, except his initials, and quite enough too, as I
thought. Evidently Arkle was an eel in a trap, as Hans put it, or a
bull in a net, a better simile in his case. Also he or some of his
confounded councillors had guessed my desire to escape, for in this
country a bird of the air seemed to carry the matter even faster than
it does in others, and he warned me against it, having been told what
the result would be. Well, the idea must be abandoned; from the first
it was madness to think that such an attempt could succeed.</p>

<p>About three miles away at a village, or what remained of it after
the storm, we met the "army", to give it Kumpana's imposing name. It
consisted of some two hundred and fifty spearmen! I asked him where the
rest of it was and he replied, with his odd little smile, that it did
not exist, for all the other able-bodied men had been left to defend
the town and the Chief. Then I asked him what strength the Abanda could
put into the field. He replied that he was not sure, but he thought
from ten to twelve thousand warriors, for they were a large people
accustomed to the use of arms, and sometimes they warred with other
tribes and, always conquering, absorbed those who were left of
them.</p>

<p>Lastly I inquired in mild exasperation how he expected to fight ten
thousand men with two hundred and fifty. He replied blandly that he did
not know, being himself a councillor and seer, not a soldier, but that
doubtless it would be done somehow according to the directions he might
receive; adding, I presume in a sarcastic spirit, that my presence
would be worth many regiments, because Kaneke and the Abanda were
afraid of me and my white man's wisdom and weapons. Then I gave up,
fearing lest more of such gibes should cause me to lose my temper and
say things I might regret.</p>

<p>We marched on for the most of that day through the beautiful crater
country where flooded rivulets--for it had no large streams, some of
which we forded with difficulty--gave evidence of the great tempest, as
did landslides on the slopes and lightning-shattered trees. But not one
soul did we meet, although I saw a few cattle grazing, apparently
unherded. The land seemed to be quite deserted, even by the game which
I presumed was still hiding in the forest, and when I asked Kumpana
where the people had gone, he said he did not know, but he supposed
that they were in hiding fearing a return of the storm. Or perhaps, he
added, as though by an after-thought, it was the Abanda that they
feared, knowing that now they were under the command of Kaneke who
might dare to enter the land.</p>

<p>At length in the afternoon we came to a village, to reach which we
had to march round some deep clefts that, from their fresh appearance
and great depth must, I saw, have been caused by the recent
earthquakes. Here a few old men, and some women, also old, were engaged
in cooking large quantities of food, evidently in preparation for our
arrival.</p>

<p>We were now within five or six miles of the wall of cliff which
surrounded the whole crater, although we could scarcely see this cliff,
because the village lay in a hollow and for some time we had been
passing through park-like country where tall trees grew so thickly that
they cut off the view.</p>

<p>We ate of the food, which was excellent, and rested, because Kumpana
told us that we should remain at this place until far on into the
night, when we must march again, so as to reach the cliff by dawn. I
asked what we were to do when we did reach it. Again he replied that he
did not know; perhaps we should go through the pass and attack the
Abanda, or perhaps we should wait for them to attack us, or perhaps we
should retire. Then he hurried off before I could put more
questions.</p>

<p>The last thing I saw as the sun set was the party of old men and
women who had cooked the food tramping off eastwards with their bundles
on their backs, which suggested that they did not mean to return. Then,
in order that I might be fresh in the face of emergencies, I went to
sleep, and so remained till about three on the following morning when
Kumpana woke us and suggested that we should breakfast, as the army was
about to start.</p>

<p>Having swallowed something, presently off we went, travelling by the
light of the waning moon and the stars. It was so dark among those
trees that had not a man led me by the hand I should not have been able
to see where to go, but the gloom did not seem to incommode the
Dabanda, a people who must have had the eyes of cats. On we travelled,
always uphill, for we were now climbing the slope of the cliff, till at
length the sky grew grey with dawn. Then we halted, waiting for the
sun.</p>

<p>Presently with startling suddenness it appeared over the eastern
edge of the crater far away, its level beams striking upon the western
cliffs, although the crater itself was still shrouded in mist and
gloom. Or rather, immediately in front of us, they struck upon where
the cliff should have been and showed us a strange and terrible sight,
which caused a gasp of astonishment to burst from the lips of even
those cold, silent men. For behold, it was riven from crest to foot by
the shock of earthquake, and in place of the narrow pass a few yards
wide, was a vast gulf that could not have measured less than a quarter
of a mile across!</p>

<p>The great mass of the precipice was torn asunder and hurled, I
suppose, down the outer slopes; at any rate there was but little debris
in the cleft itself, which suggested that the earth-waves that did the
damage must have rolled from within the crater outwards towards the
plain. Why it should have concentrated its terrific strength and centre
of disturbance upon this particular spot I cannot say who am ignorant
of the ways of earthquakes, unless it was because here the wall of
cliff was thinner and weaker than elsewhere; also it may have been
destroyed in other sections of the gigantic ring of precipice upon
which I never looked.</p>

<p>The result of the cataclysm, so far as the Dabanda and their country
were concerned, was obvious. They were no longer protected by a mighty
natural wall pierced only with a few narrow clefts that could be held
by a handful of men, for there was now, as Hans remarked, a fine open
road between them and the rest of Africa, on which an army could march
in safety without breaking its ranks. Their seclusion was gone and
their secret land lay open to the world.</p>

<p>Did Kumpana understand this and all it meant? I wondered as I gazed
at his impassive face. More, did he know what had happened before we
reached the place, and, if so, why did he come there with his beggarly
little force? Was it with some subtle hidden object? I cannot tell,
though in view of what happened afterwards I have my own opinion of the
matter.</p>

<p> </p>

<h1><a name="c018">CHAPTER XVIII</a></h1>

<br>


<h1>ALLAN RUNS AWAY</h1>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>"If you intended to hold the pass with these, Kumpana," I said,
pointing to the redoubtable two hundred and fifty, "now that it has
grown so wide, that cannot be done."</p>

<p>"No, Lord," he answered, "it is not possible by strength alone; even
charging cattle could sweep us away with their horns if there were
enough of them."</p>

<p>"Then what do you mean to do, Kumpana? Return home again?"</p>

<p>"I cannot say, Lord. Let us go forward and look through the gap in
the cliff, for then perhaps we shall learn what we must do. It may be
that the Abanda, frightened by its fall, have run away, or that they
are afraid to enter lest another earthquake should come out of
Mone-land and swallow them up living."</p>

<p>"Perhaps," I answered, but to myself I thought that unless I were
mistaken, it would take more than this to frighten the furious and
desperate Kaneke.</p>

<p>Kumpana issued an order to his men who, with a kind of stolid
indifference which suggested fatalism or a knowledge that they were
protected by unseen forces, instantly marched forward towards the new
pass.</p>

<p>"Baas," said Hans to me, "we are not captains here, but only
'luck-charms', so let us keep behind. I don't like the look of that
place, Baas."</p>

<p>As usual there was practical wisdom in Hans' suggestion, for if
there should happen to be an ambush, or anything of the sort, I did not
see why we should be its first victims. So, taking my chance of again
being sneered at by Kumpana, I kept well to the rear of the little
column, among the carriers indeed.</p>

<p>Well, there <i>was</i> an ambush, in fact a first-class specimen of
that stratagem of war. In one of Scott's poems I remember a description
of how a highland hillside which seemed to be quite deserted, suddenly
bristled with men springing up from behind every bush and fern-brake.
Substituting rocks, of which thousands lay about in the newly opened
pass, for bushes and bracken, the scene repeated itself in that Central
African gorge.</p>

<p>Indeed, unless their Engoi had developed wonderful spiritual
activity for their protection, I suppose that every Dabanda spears-man
would have been killed, had not some donkey among their enemies made
the mistake of blowing a horn before they had advanced into the mouth
of the pass, thereby giving a premature signal to attack. At the sound
of this horn the rocks became alive with Abanda warriors who rushed to
the onslaught with a savage yell. Our heroes gave one look, then turned
and bolted in a solid mass, I presume without waiting for orders. Or
perhaps their orders were to bolt at this critical moment, which had
been foreseen. Really I neither know nor care.</p>

<p>"Run, Baas," said Hans, wheeling round and giving me the example,
and off I went back upon our spoor. Never a shot did I fire, or do
anything except foot it as hard as I was able.</p>

<p>I think I have told how Kumpana remarked at the beginning of this
expedition that he believed I was a good runner, which is, or was,
true, for in those days I was very light and wiry with an excellent
pair of lungs. Now I determined to show him that he had not
over-estimated my powers. In fact, for quite a long way I led the field
with Hans, who also knew how to step out when needful, immediately at
my heels.</p>

<p>"Baas," puffed that worthy when we had done a mile or two down the
slope, "if we did not lead these dogs to battle, at least we are
leading them out of it."</p>

<p>So we were, but just then some of the most active of them got ahead
of us.</p>

<p>Well, to cut a long story short, we ran all day, with short
intervals for repose and refreshment. Looking back just as we entered
the more densely wooded country where we had camped the night before, I
saw that this strategical retreat was quite necessary, for at a
distance followed the Abanda army by the hundred, or, unless my fears
multiplied their number, by the thousand. But they could not run as we
did, though once they made a spurt and pressed us hard. Or perhaps they
feared lest they too were being led into an ambush and therefore
advanced with caution, sending scouts ahead. At any rate, after this
rush from which we escaped with difficulty, they fell back again, and
when we reached Dabanda-town, which we did before evening, for we
returned at about twice the rate of our outward journey, they were not
in sight.</p>

<p>Some of the Council and a few others were waiting for us in the
town. Evidently they knew we were coming, how I cannot say, but there
they were with watchmen set upon the altar platform. Also most
fortunately they had prepared food and native beer for the consumption
of their retiring heroes. Good heavens! how we fell upon it, especially
upon the drink, of which Hans swallowed so much that at last I was
obliged to knock the pot out of his hand.</p>

<p>Whilst we were devouring this meal, with anxious eyes fixed upon the
route we had followed, I realized the fact that except for the few
people I have mentioned, the town was quite deserted; nobody could be
seen.</p>

<p>"Where have they gone?" I said to Hans.</p>

<p>"Into the forest to join the spook-elephants, I expect, Baas," he
replied, stuffing a lump of meat into his mouth, "and that is where we
shall have to follow them."</p>

<p>So it was, for just then Kumpana arrived, quite calm but looking a
little the worse for wear. Having congratulated me upon "the strength
of my legs", he remarked that we must take refuge by the lake at once,
and that as the forest was a difficult place in which to find one's
way, we should do well to keep close to him.</p>

<p>"Certainly," I replied, "and I hope that this time you, Kumpana,
will keep close to us."</p>

<p>So we started, wearily enough, and without an opportunity being
given to us to visit our house, as I wished to do. As we reached the
first of the trees, looking back I saw the Abanda hordes running into
the town, which was quite undefended. They did not stay to plunder or
to burn it; they simply ran through it on our tracks. When they reached
the stone platform, however, they stopped, and one of them, I think it
was Kaneke himself, rushed up the steps followed by some others, and
scattered the sacred fire, extinguishing it for the second time.</p>

<p>Kumpana, at my side, shuddered at the sight.</p>

<p>"He shall pay. Oh, certainly he shall pay!" he muttered, adding,
"Come on, you fools, come on. The Engoi awaits you!"</p>

<p>Then we plunged into the thick of the forest and lost sight of
them.</p>

<p>This happened while it was still afternoon, some time before
night-fall, so that light of a sort befriended us until we were well
into the wood. Just before the perennial gloom of the place, deepened
by the advance of evening, turned to darkness, we reached a spot where
few trees grew because of the swampy nature of the soil. Here, on the
shore of a shallow lake formed by flood water, Kumpana announced that
we must camp till the following morning, as so many men ignorant of its
paths could not travel through the forest before the sun rose.</p>

<p>"What if the Abanda overtake us here?" I asked.</p>

<p>"They will not overtake us," he answered. "They dare not enter the
trees until there is light, and then I think that only the boldest will
come, because they know this place to be holy, one forbidden to
them."</p>

<p>As I was too tired to inquire further about this or any other
matter, I accepted the explanation and just lay down to sleep, hoping
that Kumpana would not give us the slip for the second time. To tell
the truth I was so exhausted after racing along all day in a hot
climate, that I was ready to trust to luck, not caring much what
happened.</p>

<p>On the whole I rested well, which is not always the case when one is
over-weary with mental and physical exertion, and without suffering
from any of the unpleasant experiences which had afflicted Hans and
myself on our return from our visit to the lake. Once I did wake up,
however; I think it was after midnight, for the moon, now in its last
quarter, shone brightly overhead and was reflected in the flood-water.
By its light I saw a long line of shadowy and gigantic forms marching
between the trees upon the farther side of this water, and for a moment
wondered what they were, or whether I was dreaming. Then I remembered
the elephants that we had seen fleeing before the storm and
earth-tremblings to refuge in this forest, where doubtless they still
remained with the other wild beasts.</p>

<p>After this I went to sleep again, nor did I wake until the sun was
up. We rose and ate of food that was given to us. Whether the soldiers
carried it with them from the town, or whether it was brought to them
during the night, I do not know, but both then and afterwards there was
plenty for us all.</p>

<p>Our meal finished, Kumpana gave the order to march, and off we went,
walking slowly round the stretch of flood-water which I have mentioned
into the dense woodland beyond. While we crossed this patch of
comparatively open ground, I observed that our numbers were now much
diminished. We had entered the forest over two hundred and fifty
strong. Now I could not count more than five and twenty men, the rest
had vanished.</p>

<p>I asked Kumpana where they had gone.</p>

<p>"Oh," he answered, "this way and that to talk to the wild beasts, of
which the wood is full after the storm, and tell them that we are
friends whom they must not harm," a reply I thought so crazy that I did
not continue the conversation.</p>

<p>When I discussed the matter with Hans, however, he took another
view.</p>

<p>"They are spook-beasts, as I have told you before, Baas," he said,
"especially the elephants. These wizards have command over them, as we
have seen with our eyes, and doubtless have gone to order them out of
our path, as Kumpana says. It is as well, Baas," he added meaningly,
"seeing that we are without rifles."</p>

<p>"Have you not been able to find that man to whom I gave mine to
carry?" I asked, colouring.</p>

<p>"No, Baas. He is not to be found; perhaps he is dead or perhaps he
has stolen it, or hidden it away. Nor are those who carried the spare
guns to be found."</p>

<p>"And where is yours?" I asked sharply.</p>

<p>"Baas," he answered in a dejected voice, "I threw it away. Yes, when
I thought those Abanda were going to catch us, I threw it away that I
might run the faster."</p>

<p>We looked at each other.</p>

<p>"Hans," I said, "do you remember that Tom and Jerry did this same
thing when we were hunted by the elephants, and how I told them that
this <i>we</i> should never do, whereon they said that if they were not
Christians they would hang themselves for very shame? And do you
remember that only just before they died so bravely to save us, you
taunted them about that business, bidding them throw away their guns
again if they were too heavy to carry?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Baas, I have been thinking of it all night."</p>

<p>"And yet, Hans, we have done worse than they did, for they were only
being hunted by beasts, while we fled from men, so that now when
presently we may have to fight, we have no rifles."</p>

<p>"I know it all, Baas, and I am so ashamed that almost I could hang
myself as Little Holes and Jerry wished to do."</p>

<p>"Then we ought to hang together, for what you did I did. At least I
gave my rifle to a savage, knowing that very likely I should never see
it again, so that we shall be defenceless before the enemy and these
Dabanda will make a mock of me, the white man who has promised to serve
them."</p>

<p>Here Hans became so deeply affected that I saw him draw the back of
his hand over his flat little face to wipe away the tears of shame.</p>

<p>For a while we trudged on in silence, then he said in a broken
voice:</p>

<p>"Baas, it was quite right of you to give your rifle to a black man
to carry, as it is the custom of white masters to do, and if he stole
it or was killed, it cannot be helped. But it is different with me.
Baas, I am a yellow cur, but even curs can learn a lesson, as I
have."</p>

<p>"What lesson, Hans?"</p>

<p>"That we shouldn't judge each other, Baas, as I did when I mocked
Tom and Jerry, because you see we may always do the same things or
worse ones. Baas, if ever we get back to Zanzibar I will give all the
money I earn upon this journey to Jerry's daughter, who is in a school;
yes, and my share of that which Kaneke gave you, and not spend one
shilling upon gin or new clothes."</p>

<p>"That shows a good spirit," I said, "but what should I do?"</p>

<p>Now all this requires a little explanation. When writing about our
flight before the Abanda hordes, I was ashamed to tell what after all I
have been obliged to record because of this talk between Hans and
myself, and what happened afterwards. As I have said, there was a time
during that flight when the Abanda, rushing forward, pressed us very
hard, and because of the heavy rifles and ammunition which we carried,
Hans and I were dropping behind and likely to be speared. Then it was
that I gave my gun and cartridges to a long-legged soldier who bore
nothing except his spear, and Hans, seeing me do so, bettered my bad
example by throwing his away, which enabled us to put on the pace and
again draw out of danger.</p>

<p>It may be argued that we were justified by the circumstances, and,
so far as Hans was concerned, doubtless this is true. But I was not
justified, I, the white man to whom all these people looked up as one
braver and superior to themselves, and at whom now doubtless they
jeered as Hans had done at Tom and Jerry. There is nothing more to say,
except that I look upon this incident as one of the greatest
humiliations of my career. Not only to Hans did it teach a lesson as to
loose and easy criticism of others, for from it I learned one which I
shall never forget throughout my life.</p>

<p>For most of that day, stopping now and again at the command of
Kumpana, we marched on slowly and with caution through the forest, of
which the dense gloom did not tend to raise our spirits, that were
already low enough. From time to time I caught sight of elephants and
other wild game, which stared at us as we went by, but neither ran away
nor attempted to attack. It was as though they knew these Dabanda, to
whom they were taboo, to be their friends. Indeed, during that march I
grew quite convinced that Kumpana's story as to the mastery of his
people over the beasts of the field was true, for, as will be seen,
they were savage enough where others were concerned, whom, I suppose,
they recognized to be different by their smell. Of course, as I have
said, Hans had another explanation, for he was, and always remained,
convinced that these animals had the spirits of men in them, which is
absurd.</p>

<p>At length towards evening we emerged from the forest and saw the
great lake in front of us. Also we saw that on its shores were gathered
several hundreds of the Dabanda, a sight that gladdened my eyes, and in
the midst of them Arkle himself, easy to recognize by his great height
and size and red beard, although he wore Dabanda dress and carried a
long spear.</p>

<p>Presently we were among them and I was shaking Arkle by the
hand.</p>

<p>"I see that you look depressed," he said, "and I fear that you have
had a bad time."</p>

<p>"Very bad," I answered. "I have run from enemies faster than ever I
ran before, and I have lost my arms, which a soldier should not
do--they were heavy to carry, you see. Nor indeed did I want to shoot
people with whom I had no quarrel."</p>

<p>"I don't wonder you threw them away, Quatermain. I did the same when
the Abanda hunted me. I had rather live without a rifle than stick to
it and die."</p>

<p>"The point could be argued," I answered, "but there isn't time. Tell
me, what the devil does all this play-acting mean? Why was I dragged
out with two hundred and fifty men to fight thousands of Abanda, which,
of course, was impossible?"</p>

<p>"I am not sure. You see, Quatermain, I am only a figurehead in this
country, and figureheads are not told everything. But if you ask me, I
believe you were sent to be a bait. You see, Kaneke thinks you a very
great man, and it seems he had announced that if he could capture you,
or, failing this, if he could kill you, the Abandas must win, he would
get all he wanted--you know what it is--and they would grow into a
mighty people, never lacking rain or anything else. Also the Dabanda
would become their slaves and the power and wisdom of the Engoi would
go with them ever more."</p>

<p>"Still I don't understand why we went out to fight," I said,
"without the ghost of a chance of winning, or doing anything except run
away."</p>

<p>"Because you were meant to run away, Quatermain, in order that you
might draw the Abanda after you. Unless you had run they would not have
followed, for not even Kaneke could make them enter the Land of the
Holy Lake. You see the ruse has succeeded, for presently they will be
here. Don't look at me angrily, for on my honour I had nothing to do
with the business."</p>

<p>"I should hope not!" I exclaimed. "For if I thought you could play
such a trick upon a white man who has done his best to help you, I
would never speak to you again. Besides, what is the object of it all?
Why have the Abanda been tempted to take possession of this country,
from which you will never be able to drive them out again?"</p>

<p>"I cannot tell you," he answered in a low voice, "but I think in
order that their fighting men may be destroyed. Quatermain, I believe
that something terrible awaits those unfortunate people, but I swear to
you that I do not know what it is; those priests will not tell me."</p>

<p>At this moment Hans nudged me.</p>

<p>"Look," he said, pointing towards the edge of the forest.</p>

<p>I did so and perceived a great body of men, a thousand or more of
them, emerging from its shadows, drawn up in companies. The Abanda were
upon us with Kaneke at the head of them. Arkle saw them also, for I
heard him utter an exclamation.</p>

<p>"Well," I said, "we can't run away this time, so I suppose that we
must fight until we are killed. Have you your rifle? If so, give it me
and I will shoot that Kaneke."</p>

<p>"It has been taken from me," he answered, shaking his head. "When I
protested they told me that the white man's weapons were unlawful for
me, and would not be needed."</p>

<p>As he spoke a number of Dabanda priests ran up and surrounded Arkle,
so that for the time I saw no more of him. Confusion ensued while
Kumpana and other officers tried to marshal their men into a double
rank. Hans and I found ourselves pushed into a place in the centre of
the first line. There we stood, unarmed, except for our revolvers and a
few cartridges, which fortunately we had preserved. Arkle, still
surrounded by priests and others, was kept at the back of the second
rank in such a position and with such precautions as to give me the
idea that the business of this force was to act as a bodyguard and
safeguard him, rather than to fight the Abanda. Yet it seemed that
fight it must, for the lake, into which retreat was impossible, was
behind it and the enemy was in front.</p>

<p>The Abanda marched on. Scrutinizing their faces as they came, it
struck me that there was something the matter with these men. Of course
they were tired, which was not strange, seeing that after enduring the
terror of the earthquake and the storm, they had pursued us all the way
from their own boundary and through the forest. But their aspect
suggested more than weariness; terror was written on their faces. Why?
I wondered; since although they must have left most of their army
behind, perhaps in occupation of Dabanda-town, they still outnumbered
our force by three or four to one.</p>

<p>Had they perhaps met with strange adventures in the forest, as once
Hans and I had done? Or were they overcome by a sense of their
sacrilege in violating the forbidden land, upon whose soil for
generations none of them had set a foot, except their leader, the
renegade Kaneke, and were fearful of some supernatural vengeance? I
could not tell, but certainly they had a frightened air, very different
from that of the bold fellows whom we had met hunting Arkle and who had
tried to cut us off from the mountain pass.</p>

<p>Still they advanced in good order, as I supposed to attack and make
an end of us. Yet this was not so, for at a little distance they formed
themselves into three sides of a square and halted. Now, while I
marvelled what was going to happen (had I been in command of the
Dabanda I should have rushed at them), Kaneke emerged from their ranks
and walked to within fifty paces of us, which he was quite safe in
doing, for the Dabanda had no bows, being armed only with long and
heavy spears that could not be thrown.</p>

<p>"Men of the Dabanda," he cried in his big voice, "though you ran
fast, I have caught you at length, and with nothing but water behind
you, you are in my power, for I see that the white man, Macumazahn, has
lost the weapon with which he is so skilled." (Here I was minded to see
whether I could not reach him with a pistol shot, but remembering that
the quarrel was none of mine and that I had very few cartridges, I
refrained from trying.)</p>

<p>"Yet, men of the Dabanda," went on Kaneke, "I do not wish to kill
you among whom I was bred and who I hope will live on to be my
subjects. I do not even wish to kill Macumazahn and his servant,
because once they saved me from murderers, and we have been companions
upon a long journey. There is only one whom I will kill, and that is
the white thief, whom I see skulking yonder behind your lines, who has
stolen my place and heritage, and would steal the Shadow, my appointed
wife. Therefore give him up to me that I may make an end of him before
your faces and submit yourselves to me, who will harm no other man
among you; no, not even that cunning jackal, Kumpana."</p>

<p>Now Kumpana stepped forward and said clearly but quietly:</p>

<p>"Cease from your boastful talk, Kaneke, wizard and traitor, who sold
your birthright to save your life, you who did violence to the Engoi
before her altar, you who but yesterday scattered the holy fire of the
altar and stamped it out, you who are accursed. Hear me, men of the
Abanda," he went on, raising his voice, "what is the quarrel with us?
You asked for rain. Has not rain been sent to you in plenty? Do not
your lands run with water? Give us this man who has beguiled you and
depart in peace--or keep him and be destroyed.</p>

<p>"Has not the ancient prophecy been handed down to you by your
fathers, that the very rocks will hurl themselves upon those of your
people who dare to set foot within the forest and to look upon the holy
lake, and that the wild beasts will rend them, and that those who
escape the rocks and the beasts will be seized with madness? And have
not the rocks already hurled themselves upon you, killing many who
dwelt beneath them? Will you wait till all the curse fulfils itself, or
will you give up this man and depart in peace unharmed? Answer while
you may, for by sunset it will be too late."</p>

<p>Now I could see that the Abanda soldiers were much disturbed. They
whispered one to another, and some of their captains began to consult
together. How it would have ended I do not know, though I doubt whether
these Abanda, who seemed to me to be brave and loyal savages, would
have consented to surrender the man whom they had chosen as their
general in the attempt to possess themselves of Dabanda-land, with its
material riches and the boon of what they believed to be an especial
spiritual protection. This matter, however, remained undecided, for
Kaneke, who doubtless feared the worst, cried out:</p>

<p>"Men of the Abanda, am I not the appointed Shield of the Shadow, a
greater wizard than yonder low-born Kumpana, the son of a slave? When
the mountain heaved did I not open a roadway through it, making the two
lands one, and as for the beasts, are they not also at my command? If
you doubt it, ask the white lord, Watcher-by-Night, and the yellow man,
his servant, to whom I showed my power over them. And remember that but
now I have led you unharmed through a host of elephants that fled at my
word. Ho! you white thief"--and he pointed at Arkle with his spear--"I
have an offer to make to you. If you are not a coward, come out and
fight me man to man, and let the conqueror take the Shadow. Come out
and fight me, I say! Or go tell the Shadow that he who woos her and has
come from far to win her, is but a coward with a heart whiter than his
face."</p>

<p>Arkle heard him; with a roar of rage he shook off the priests who
held him and charged through our lines straight at Kaneke. To my horror
I saw as he passed me that he was quite unarmed, for either he had
dropped his spear or it had been taken from him by the priests; yes, he
was attacking the man with nothing but his naked hands.</p>

<p>"Let none come between us!" he shouted as he went.</p>

<p>Kaneke lifted his spear to pierce him, but somehow Arkle avoided the
thrust and, rushing in, gripped its haft and snapped it like a twig, so
that the broad blade fell between them. Then he threw his arms round
Kaneke and they wrestled. They were mighty men, both of them, but once
that spear was gone I had little doubt of the issue. Still, the end
came sooner than I expected, for Arkle seemed to lift Kaneke from his
feet and dash him to the ground, where he lay half stunned. Then,
before the Abanda could come to the help of their captain, he picked
him up as though he were a child, carried him to the ranks of the
Dabanda and through them, and cast him down at the feet of the
priests!</p>

<h1><a name="c019">CHAPTER XIX</a></h1>

<br>


<h1>THE BRIDAL AND THE CURSE</h1>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>The torrential rains which fell during the storm had reached the
lake by many streams, with the result that its waters had enlarged
themselves. The old shore-line, fringed with tall reeds, where I had
stood on my first visit, was quite a hundred yards away. Thus the
reeds, or rather the upper halves of them, now stood like a thicket at
that distance from the shore, cutting off the view from the stretch of
water that was beyond but near to them, while the rest of the lake and
the distant island were turned to a dazzle of gold by the fierce rays
of the sinking sun.</p>

<p>Out of these reeds, at the exact moment when Arkle cast down the
great form of Kaneke before the priests, suddenly emerged a large
canoe, or rather a barge, for its stern was square. It was paddled by
white-robed women, quite thirty of them, I should say, seated upon
either side of the craft, which had a gangway running down its centre.
Upon the broad poop was a curious carved seat, large enough, I noted,
to accommodate two persons, and in the centre of this seat sat a woman
whom I knew must be she who was called the Engoi, or Shadow, a tall and
beautiful young woman whose gauzy robes glittered in the sunlight as
though they were sewn with gold and gems, which perhaps they were. She
wore a high head-dress with wings, not unlike to those of a viking's
helm, from which, half hiding her face, flowed down a veil spangled
with stars.</p>

<p>On came the boat, so gently that one could not hear the paddles'
dip, and as its prow touched the shore, priests sprang forward and held
it fast. The regal-looking woman rose to her feet, while there went up
a great shout of:</p>

<p><i>"Engoi! Engoi!"</i></p>

<p>Clothed, as it were, with burning light, she stood above us on the
high poop, gazing at the prostrate form of Kaneke, at the man who had
cast him there, at the tall, white-robed, large-eyed Dabanda spearsmen,
and at the Abanda warriors beyond. Then she spoke in a clear,
flute-like voice, which in that silence could be heard by all.</p>

<p>"I, the Treasure of the Lake, greet you, servants of the Engoi; I
greet you, White Lord from far away" (this was addressed to Arkle; of
me she took no notice). "I greet you all. Tell me, O Kumpana, Father of
my Council, what host is this that threatens you with spears?"</p>

<p>"That of the Abanda, O Engoi, who, breaking the oath sworn by their
forefathers and braving the curse, have dared to enter the holy land of
Mone to slay us and to give you, the divine Shadow, to be the wife of
this dog." Here he pointed to Kaneke, who, I noted, had recovered his
senses, for he raised himself upon his arm and listened.</p>

<p>"Take him and judge him, the accursed, according to your law," she
said, "for on him I will never look again." Then added in louder tones
that trembled with cold anger: "Men of the Abanda, the curse with which
Kaneke is cursed, clings to you also and the mercy that you would not
take departs from you. <i>Begone to the beasts for judgment and become
as beasts,</i> till Heaven lifts its wrath from off you and creep to my
feet as slaves to pray pardon for your sins."</p>

<p>The Abanda heard. They stared at the priestess clothed with light,
they spoke together, as I supposed making ready to attack us. But it
was not so, for, of a sudden, panic seemed to seize them. I saw it pass
from face to face, I saw them tremble and cover their eyes with their
hands. Then without a word they turned and ran back to the shelter of
the forest, an army that had become a terror-stricken mob.</p>

<p>They were gone, the thunder of a thousand feet died away into
silence; not one of them could be seen; they were lost among the
darksome trees.</p>

<p>The beautiful maiden called Shadow, whose eyes had been fixed upon
the water, lifted her head and looked at Arkle, saying softly:</p>

<p>"White Lord from afar, our dream is fulfilled and once more we meet,
as was foretold, and I am yours and you are mine. Yet if you would
depart with your companion"--here for the first time she glanced at
me--"still the road lies open. Go, then, if it pleases you; only if you
go, learn that henceforth for this life and all that are to come we
separate for ever. Learn, too, that if you stay, there is no power in
heaven or in earth that shall part us while time endures and the star
we follow shines in the sky. Choose, then, and have done."</p>

<p>Arkle stared at the ground, like to one who is lost in doubt. Then
he lifted his eyes and met hers that were fixed upon him, till the
radiance which shone upon her face seemed to pass to his, and I knew
that she had conquered. He turned and spoke to me, saying:</p>

<p>"Farewell, my friend whom I shall see no more. I know you believe me
mad, even wicked perhaps, and so I am according to your judgment and
that of the world we know. Yet my heart tells me that love can do no
wrong and that in my madness is the truest wisdom, for yonder stands my
destiny, she whom I was born to win, she who was lost and is found
again. Farewell once more, and think of me at times as we shall of you,
until perchance elsewhere"--and he pointed upwards--"we meet again, and
you too understand all that I cannot speak."</p>

<p>He took my hand and pressed it, then very slowly stepped on to the
prow of the boat, and passing down its length between the two lines of
women who sat like statues, came to her who stood upon its poop. As he
came she opened her arms and received him in her arms, and there they
kissed before us all. For thus was the shadow wed in the presence of
her people.</p>

<p>Side by side they sat themselves upon the throne-like seat. The
priests thrust the boat out into the water, the paddlers turned its
prow towards the reeds and the island that lay beyond them, and the sun
sank.</p>

<p>The sun sank, the waters of the holy lake grew dark, and these
strange travellers departed into gloom. Once more only did I see them
after they had passed through the reeds out on to the darkened bosom of
the lake. Some cloud above caught the last rays of the sun that had
vanished behind the crater cliffs, and reflected them in a shaft of
light on to the water and the boat that floated there, turning those it
bore to shapes of glory. Then the ray passed and the shadows hid
them.</p>

<p>"That's a good omen for the Red Baas and the pretty spook-lady who
has carried him off," remarked Hans reflectively, "for you see after
the sun seemed to be dead, it came to life again to wish them luck,
Baas."</p>

<p>"I hope so," I replied, turning my back upon that melancholy lake
and not in the best of spirits. Arkle at least had won the lady whom he
so passionately desired, but I, who had won nothing and nobody, felt
very much alone. My part in all this business had been to do
everybody's dirty work--that of White-Mouse, of Kaneke, of Arkle, and
of Kumpana--and to tell the truth I did not like it. No one really
enjoys the humble office of a tool which is thrown aside when done
with.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>That night we camped by the lake, and I have seldom passed one that
was more disturbed. From its solemn and mysterious depths came the
mournful cries of wildfowl and the drear sighing of the wind among the
reeds. But these were as nothing compared with the sounds which
proceeded from the forest. Fierce trumpeting of infuriated elephants,
bellowing of other beasts, and, worst of all, what sounded like the
screams of terrified and tortured men, which were so loud and
persistent that if I had known where he was sleeping I would have gone
to Kumpana and asked their cause. But I did not know and probably if I
had found him he would have told me nothing. At length, too, these
noises ceased, and I got some rest.</p>

<p>Before sunrise, when the sky grew grey and the night mist still hid
the face of the lonesome lake, Kumpana appeared, bringing us some food
and saying that we must eat it as we marched, because it was time to be
gone. So off we went, and entered that hateful forest just as the sun
rose. Before I had gone three hundred paces between the trees, I
stumbled over something soft and, looking down, to my horror discovered
that it was the mutilated body of an Abanda warrior, who from various
signs I knew must have been killed by an elephant.</p>

<p>"See here, Hans!" I said, pointing to the dreadful thing.</p>

<p>"I have seen, Baas," he answered, "and there are plenty more of them
about. Didn't you hear those spook elephants hunting them last night as
the Dabanda wizards brought them here to do?"</p>

<p>"I heard something," I answered faintly, remembering as I spoke the
words of Shadow when she told the Abanda "to begone to the beasts for
judgment"! Great God, this was the judgment!</p>

<p>Hans was quite right. There were plenty more of the poor creatures
lying about, indeed I imagine that some hundreds of them must have been
killed. What an end! To be hunted in the darkness of night and when
caught, stamped flat or torn to pieces by these maddened animals which
probably tracked them by their scent. If this were the fate of his
tools, what, I wondered, was that reserved for Kaneke, who by the way,
as I supposed, had been taken on ahead of us for I saw nothing of
him?</p>

<p>Until then I had merely disliked the Dabanda, now I hated them and
desired nothing so much as to get out of this land of cruelty and
African witchcraft. For although I had tried to find other
explanations, such as the fact that all game was taboo to them, what
but witchcraft or some force which we white men do not understand,
could account for the dominion of these people over wild animals? It
may be thought that the attack upon these Abanda by the elephants was
an accident resulting from their breaking into the herd in their
terrified retreat after they fled from the presence of one whom they
believed to be almost a goddess. But this could scarcely be so seeing
that when, following on our footsteps, the Abanda passed through the
forest to the lake, the elephants must have been all round them, for as
I have said, I saw the great beasts watching us from between the
trees.</p>

<p>Why, then, were they not attacked upon this outward journey? I can
only suggest one explanation. At that time Kaneke was with them whom
the beasts knew and obeyed, as they did other leaders of his tribe, for
had he not shown his power over these very elephants long before we
entered Dabanda-land? When the Abanda soldiers were deprived of his
protection the case was different, for then they were fallen upon,
trampled and torn to pieces as Hans and I should have been if we had
been alone.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact, however, we should have had nothing to fear on
this return journey, for we never saw these beasts again. Indeed, I
heard afterwards that when they had wreaked vengeance on the Abanda,
led by the ancient bull, they marched solemnly out of the forest and
across the crater-land to the pass through which they had appeared.
What became of them I do not know, but I suppose that they departed
back to their own haunts where we had first met them.</p>

<p>After sundry halts, of which I was not told the reason, towards
evening we emerged from that awful forest, only to be confronted with
more terrors. On the open space which surrounded the altar platform and
in the streets of the town beyond, hundreds of men of the Abanda army
were running to and fro, some with torn robes and some stark naked,
shrieking and staring about them with eyes that were full of fear. A
mob of raving maniacs who seemed hardly human, they foamed at the
mouth, they rolled upon the ground, they tore their hair and bit each
other's flesh.</p>

<p>"They are all mad, Baas," said Hans, getting behind me, for as is
common with African natives, he had a great horror of the insane and
supposed them to be inspired by heaven. "Don't touch them, Baas, or we
shall go mad too."</p>

<p>His exhortation was needless, for my one desire was to get as far as
possible from the hideous sight of these poor creatures. What could
have brought them to such a pass, I marvelled, as I do today. I can
only suppose that when the survivors of the regiments which had
followed us to the lake arrived among the army that awaited them at the
town, they communicated to their brothers the terror which had driven
them crazy.</p>

<p>Or perhaps now that Kaneke had disappeared, the superstitions he had
kept in check broke out among them with a force so irresistible that
they lost their minds, remembering the ancient curse which was said to
overtake any of their people who set foot in the land of Lake Mone,
whence they had been driven in past ages. I cannot tell, but certainly
they had "become as beasts", as the priestess Shadow foretold. It was
shocking, it was terrible, and thankful indeed was I when, on catching
sight of us, with howls and lamentations they drew together and fled
away, I suppose back to their own land.</p>

<p>Soon they were gone into the gathering darkness, thousands of them,
and quiet fell upon the town, which was quite unharmed. Hans and I made
our way to our own house where we found a lamp lit and food prepared, I
presume by the women who waited upon us, who all this while had
remained faithfully at their post. The first thing that we saw were our
lost rifles and ammunition, carefully laid upon our beds.</p>

<p><i>"Allemagter!"</i> exclaimed Hans, pointing first to the lamp and
food next to the rifles. "We have met many strange peoples in our
journeys, Baas, but never any like these. But, Baas, they are not men
and women, they are witches and wizards, every one of them, whose
master is the devil, as those Abanda will think when they get their
minds again."</p>

<p>Then, quite overcome, he sank on to a stool and began to devour his
meal in silence. I, too, collapsed; no other word describes my state,
brought about by physical fatigue and mental astonishment. At that
moment I was almost inclined to agree with Hans, though now of course I
know that these events which at the time seemed so strange were quite
susceptible of a natural interpretation. It was not wonderful that the
Abanda soldier should have been attacked in the forest by a herd of
elephants whose tempers were upset by storm and earthquake, or that the
survivors of them and their fellows should have been crazed by the
experience, added to the effect of their inherited superstitions.</p>

<p>Nor was it wonderful that an ardent man like Arkle should have
succumbed to the charm of a beautiful priestess, whose personal
attractions were enhanced by the mystery with which she was surrounded,
though I admit that I do not understand the tale of his previous
telepathic intercourse with her, if it may be so described. Very
possibly, however, this existed only in his imagination, and the real
romance began, on his part at any rate, when he first saw her upon the
borders of the lake.</p>

<p>Still, the cumulative effect of so many eerie happenings, reinforced
by the legends with which my ears were filled, and the constant
ceremonies and experiences of an abnormal and unwholesome nature in
which I had been forced to take a part, together with the vanishing
away of Arkle into what I understood to be a kind of Eastern
<i>houri</i> paradise, was crushing; at least this was its effect upon
a tired and puzzled man.</p>

<p>So I went to bed with an attack of fever and low spirits that kept
me there for a week, after which I took another week to recover my
strength.</p>

<p>During all this time very little happened, for Hans reported that
everything in the town went on as it used to do before the great storm.
The people were cultivating their gardens; the sacred fire was re-lit
upon the altar and the priests had rebuilt their fallen observation
tower, whence they watched the stars nightly as of old. To judge from
the aspect of the people, indeed one might have thought that nothing
unusual had occurred, or at any rate that it was quite forgotten.</p>

<p>Now, being filled with nervous apprehensions and extremely anxious
to escape from this country as soon as I was well enough to face the
journey, I tried several times to get into touch with Kumpana, the only
man in the place who seemed to have any real authority, but was always
told that he was absent.</p>

<p>At length he came, bland and smiling as ever, and apologized for not
having done so before, "For then," he added, "I, who am a doctor,
should have been able to cure you more quickly."</p>

<p>I replied that it did not matter, as I was now quite recovered who
never suffered from serious illness. Then I asked him the news.</p>

<p>"There is little, Lord," he answered. "From the lake we hear that
the Engoi and her husband, the Shield of the Shadow, are well and most
happy. The Abanda, now that they have reached their own land and found
their wits again--for only about two hundred of them were killed by the
elephants--are very humble and have sent to make their submission,
promising henceforth to be our faithful servants and to live with us as
one people."</p>

<p>"So you have got what you want," I said.</p>

<p>"Yes, Lord, for now we shall become a great tribe, a nation, indeed,
as once we were hundreds of years ago, because these Abanda are brave
fighting men and their women have many children, whereas ours bear few
or none at all. Never again will they threaten us, but, directed by our
wisdom, will do all that we command."</p>

<p>"Which was your object throughout, I suppose, Kumpana?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Lord, it was our object, which explains much that you have
never been able to understand, amongst other things, why you were
brought to Mone-land. Without you Kaneke could not have been saved from
the Arabs, and the White Lord, Shield of the Shadow, could not have
been saved from the Abanda after his madness had caused him to be cast
out of our country, which even I was unable to prevent."</p>

<p>"But why did you want Kaneke back, Kumpana, seeing that at once you
took away his chieftainship and made him an outlaw?"</p>

<p>"Because, amongst other reasons, if he had not returned and been
driven out again, he would not have fled to the Abanda and led them to
attack us, as we wished that he should do, knowing the fate that would
overtake them. Even then I do not think that the Abanda, who fear the
Engoi and her servants, would have followed him, had they not seen you,
the great white lord whose fame is everywhere, running before them like
a hunted jackal, which was why we took you with us to the pass, telling
you that it was to fight them."</p>

<p>Now controlling my wrath as best I could, for it was useless to
argue with Kumpana about this disgraceful episode of my career, I said
with sarcasm:</p>

<p>"So you foresaw all these things, Kumpana, and arranged
accordingly?"</p>

<p>"Of course, Lord, for we have that gift," he replied in the mild,
protesting voice of one who humours an ignorant fool.</p>

<p>This amazing lie took away my breath, but again feeling it useless
to argue, I changed the subject, by asking:</p>

<p>"And why did you bring him who is now her husband here to marry the
Shadow, instead of giving her to Kaneke, to whom she was promised, or
to some other man of your people?"</p>

<p>"Because, Lord, our men are--" and he used an Arabic word which I
can only translate by the English phrase 'played out'. "The race has
grown too ancient and too interbred. Therefore it was necessary that
she who is now the Engoi upon earth should wed one of a different stock
who has knowledge of the arts and laws of the great white races. For,
Lord, from this marriage will spring a woman, the Engoi to be, who will
be very great of heart. It is she," he went on with a ring of triumph
in his voice, "who will once more make the Dabanda mighty among the
peoples of Africa, not the lady who now rules over us, or the white
wanderer who is her spouse."</p>

<p>"So that is another of your prophecies, Kumpana?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Lord, and one which most certainly will be fulfilled," he
answered in the same triumphant tone. Then, as though the matter were
one which he declined to discuss, he said in his ordinary voice:</p>

<p>"This is the night of full moon, and there is a ceremony before the
altar which we pray you to attend. For tomorrow doubtless you will wish
to bid us farewell as it has been arranged that you should do."</p>

<p>"I am glad to hear that," I exclaimed, "but I don't want to be
present at any more of your ceremonies."</p>

<p>"Yet, Lord," he answered with his queer little smile, "I am sure you
will do what we wish, now, as always before."</p>

<p>"Which means that I must come."</p>

<p>"Oh, Lord, I never said so. Still I am certain that you will come
and shall send an escort to attend upon you, that you may fear no
harm."</p>

<p>Then he rose and bowed himself out.</p>

<p>Not until he was gone did I remember that I had never asked him what
had become of Kaneke.</p>

<p>"Baas," said Hans, "I always thought you clever in your way, but
this Kumpana is much cleverer than you, or even than I am, because you
see in the end he always makes us do, not what we want but what he
wants, and then laughs at us about it afterwards. We shall have to go
to that fetish business tonight, because if we won't walk, we shall be
carried there, quite nicely, of course, by the men he is sending to
protect us. I wonder what we shall see, Baas."</p>

<p>"How do I know?" I snapped, for the gibes of Hans irritated me.
"Perhaps the lady Shadow and her husband will come to visit us."</p>

<p>"I don't think so, Baas. I think that they are sitting holding each
other's hands and making faces at each other, and saying silly things
about the moon. If it were six months later when they want to hold
other people's hands and to look into new faces and have forgotten all
about the moon, then they would come, Baas, but not now. But perhaps
Kaneke will visit us, unless he is dead, which we haven't heard, and
I'd much rather see him, Baas, than two people who keep saying
'Sweetie-Sweet' and 'there's no one else in the world, Pretty'."</p>

<p>"Would you, you ugly little sinner?" I replied, and walked away.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>As it happened, Hans, who could smell out the truth like any
witch-doctor, had made no mistake, for when, conducted by our promised
escort, a strong one by the way, we reached the altar platform that
night, it was to find that the centre of interest proved to be Kaneke
and no one else, and that for the second time it was our lot to see him
tried for his life. What is more, even among that undemonstrative
people, made apathetic by the passage of many ages of plenty, and by
iron priestly rule, the event excited keen and universal interest.</p>

<p>This might be seen from the fact that every creature from the town
who could walk or be carried, was gathered upon the marketplace beneath
the platform, and with them a great number of people from the villages
and farms beyond its borders. The priests too were present in force;
the astrologers watched the heavens from their towers and shouted out
the messages of the stars; a choir hidden behind the altar sang solemn
chants at intervals; and the sacred fire blazed like a signal beacon
upon a mountain, as though to make up for the fact that very recently
it had twice been extinguished. Indeed it was a veritable furnace.</p>

<p>In front of it, its fierce light playing on him, stood Kaneke, bound
and closely guarded, while on either side sat the white-robed Council
of the Shadow, whose office seemed to be that of judge or jury, or
both. Near to them, so placed that he could be heard from the audience
below as well as by all upon the platform, stood Kumpana, who in this
drama played the part of the prosecuting counsel.</p>

<p>When I arrived with Hans and had been given a seat not far from
Kumpana and facing Kaneke, the proceedings began. I need not detail
them further than to say that they consisted of a recitation of all his
crimes, starting with a long account of the act of sacrilege he had
committed in his youth against a former Engoi, that apparently was much
worse than he had intimated to me, and had resulted in his banishment
or flight, and going on to those offences with which I had some
acquaintance.</p>

<p>At length the tale was finished, and Kaneke was called upon to
answer. This he did with a certain dignity, pleading that his judges
had no jurisdiction over him, that he was their lawful chief and could
not be tried by any court. The crimes alleged against him he made no
attempt to deny or explain, perhaps because they were too flagrant to
admit of defence.</p>

<p>When he had finished speaking, Kumpana said to the Council and the
priests:</p>

<p>"What say you?"</p>

<p>Whereupon they answered all together:</p>

<p>"We say that he is guilty!" and the people gathered in the
market-place beneath echoed the words in a roar of sounds.</p>

<p>Then Kumpana cried aloud to the astrologers upon their towers,
asking:</p>

<p>"What reward is appointed to this traitor Kaneke, the accursed of
the Engoi, for his sins against the Shadow and against the people?"</p>

<p>The diviners on the towers stared at the stars, making a pretence of
consulting them, then spoke together in a secret language I did not
understand. At last one of them, he on the right, called out:</p>

<p>"Hear the voice of Heaven! Let him who quenched the fire, feed the
fire."</p>

<p>I contemplated the leaping flames upon which the priests had just
hurled more wood, and not understanding all that these words meant,
remarked to Hans that it did not seem to want feeding.</p>

<p>"Oh, Baas," he replied, "why are you so stupid? Don't you see that
they are going to burn this owl-man as an offering? The woman in the
hut told me that it is what they always do to anyone who has tried to
lay hands upon the Shadow of the Engoi, and sometimes to her husband
also if she gets tired of him."</p>

<p>"Great heavens!" I exclaimed, turning quite faint. Then, before I
could get out another word, Kaneke, who was a coward at heart, as he
had shown when he bartered his birthright to Arkle in exchange for his
life, with ashen face and bulging eyes began an impassioned appeal to
me to save him.</p>

<p>I did try to say something on his behalf, I forget what it was, but
at once Kumpana cut me short with the remark that there was plenty of
room for two upon that altar. He added in explanation that in his
country under an ancient law, he who tried to save a criminal condemned
to death must share his punishment.</p>

<p>Hearing this, as I was helpless and could not stop there to see a
man burned alive, however great a blackguard he might be, I rose and
with the best dignity I could command, walked down the platform steps
and through the people at the foot of them, back to our house. As I
passed him Kaneke shouted out:</p>

<p>"Farewell, Macumazahn, whom I met in an evil hour. If, before you
leave this land, you see your friend, the white thief who has stolen
her that was mine, tell him that in a day to come, instead of her lips
he too shall kiss the altar flames."</p>

<p>Now all my pity departed, for I knew well that these cruel words had
been spoken to create baseless fears and doubts in my mind and in that
of Arkle also, should they reach him.</p>

<p>"Cease from lying and die like a man," I said.</p>

<p>If he answered me I did not hear him, for just then the priests set
up a song, a very savage song, which prevented his words from reaching
me. At the edge of the market-place some impulse caused me to look
back, just in time to see the great shape of Kaneke outlined against
the flames into which he was being tossed whilst the people around, who
till now had remained silent, uttered a shout of joy.</p>

<p>A while later Hans joined me.</p>

<p>"Baas," he said, "I am glad they burned that beast Kaneke."</p>

<p>"Why?" I asked, for I thought the remark pitiless.</p>

<p>"For two reasons, Baas. First because he left Little Holes and Jerry
to be killed when we were running for the pass, being a coward who
could desert his friends; and secondly because he called out after you
that if he had won, he would have burned you and the Red Baas and me,
Hans, as well. That is why I stopped to see the end of him, Baas."</p>

<p>"Let us pack up," I said, "for tomorrow we start."</p>

<p>"Yes, Baas, but where to, Baas?"</p>

<p>"I don't know and I don't care," I answered, "so long as it is out
of this accursed country. Why on earth they ever brought me into it I
can't understand even now."</p>

<p>"That you might bring Kaneke, Baas."</p>

<p>"But why did they want Kaneke? They would have got on quite as well
without him."</p>

<p>"To burn him, Baas. He had sinned against another Shadow who is dead
and ran away, and the priests, who never forget, brought him back that
he might be killed for his sin. That is why White-Mouse was sent to
tempt him from home, telling him that he was to marry the new Shadow,
and that is why she was so much afraid lest he should be killed by the
Arabs and cheat the fire on the altar. Oh, they had thought it all out
quite nicely, Baas, as Kaneke has learned."</p>

<p>"Perhaps. Well, they won't tempt <i>me</i> back," I said.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<h1><a name="c020">CHAPTER XX</a></h1>

<br>


<h1>FAREWELL</h1>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>Now with the execution of Kaneke in the savage fashion that I have
described, the story of my visit to the sacred lake called Mone, and
the people who dwelt there comes to an end. Perhaps, however, there are
one or two things that I should mention.</p>

<p>All the day following the horrible scene upon the altar platform,
Hans and I spent in getting ready, tying up loads for the bearers who,
we were informed, would be provided on the next morning, superintending
the cooking of food to take with us, seeing to our boots that were much
the worse for wear, and so forth. In our spare time I tried also to
think out the great problem as to the route that we should take. Were
we to return by that which we had followed into the Lake-country, or to
strike out on a desperate journey for the West Coast? Upon my soul I
did not know, and all that Hans would do was to point out the
difficulties and dangers of either course.</p>

<p>When I lay down that night I was still quite unable to make up my
mind, and went to sleep determined to postpone further consideration
till the morrow, hoping that meanwhile some inspiration might come to
me. As a matter of fact it did, and in a curious fashion.</p>

<p>About midnight I woke up and saw, by the light of the lamp which I
kept burning, the white-draped form of a woman, standing at the foot of
the bed, who appeared to be looking at me.</p>

<p>"What the dickens--" I began in a hurry, when she stopped me with a
motion of her hand.</p>

<p>Then she drew her veil aside so that I could see her face. It was
that of White-Mouse!</p>

<p>Surely I could not be mistaken, although I had only seen her twice
or thrice upon a single night. There was the same delicate shape, the
same pleading, dark eyes, the same curling hair, and the same sweet,
plaintive face so suggestive of mystery and acquaintance with secret
things.</p>

<p>"White-Mouse!" I murmured beneath my breath, for to tell the truth I
was half afraid to speak aloud, fearing lest what I saw before me was a
ghost, or at the best a dream.</p>

<p>"Yes, Lord Macumazahn; at least once I bore that name far away among
the Arabs."</p>

<p>"But you are dead! They killed you there in the courtyard of
Kaneke's house."</p>

<p>"No, Lord, they could not kill me. I escaped out of their hands and
returned to this country before you, making your road smooth and
easy."</p>

<p>"Before us! How did you do that?"</p>

<p>"It is one of the secrets which I may not reveal, Lord, nor does it
matter. Also we have met since then when you were in trouble yonder
with the 'dwellers in the forest' and one came to guide you."</p>

<p>"I thought it!" I exclaimed; "but before I could make sure you were
gone, so that almost I believed you to be--not a woman but--well--one
of the dwellers in the forest."</p>

<p>"I knew it," she replied with a sweet little smile, "and for the
rest, even now are you sure that I am a woman?"</p>

<p>"No, I am not," I answered.</p>

<p>"Nor am I quite sure, Lord Macumazahn, but that is another of the
secrets, and it does not matter. See, I am a messenger tonight whatever
else I may be and I have brought you a letter which you can read when I
am gone, for I think that to it there is no answer. Or if there should
be an answer, shape it in your mind and I shall learn it there and
deliver it word for word."</p>

<p>"Again I begin to think that you are a ghost, White-Mouse, for women
do not talk thus," I said as I took the little roll of paper which she
handed to me and laid it down upon the bed.</p>

<p>The truth was that at the moment I was more interested in
White-Mouse than in what might be written in the roll.</p>

<p>"Although some do not know it, we are all of us ghosts, are we not,
Lord Macumazahn? Though often if the veil of flesh be gross, the light
of the ghost-lamp that shines within you cannot be seen. Lord, my time
is short and I have something to say to you. Will it please you to
listen?"</p>

<p>"When you speak, what could please me better, especially in this
land, White-Mouse?"</p>

<p>Again there flitted across her face a quick smile so strangely sweet
that it thrilled the nerves, as do certain notes of music we hear upon
a violin. At least for some indefinable reason I always connect that
smile of hers with such vibrating notes.</p>

<p>"Yet it would not please you in other lands, Lord, for there among
your own people nothing would delight you less than to hear the voice
of a ghost-woman, the dweller in a spell-bound, haunted place. Were it
otherwise, perchance I should accompany you, as, although you will not
see me, I may do yet."</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" I asked rather anxiously.</p>

<p>"Nothing that you need fear, Lord, except that I like you well, and
both ghosts and women are pleased to be with those whom they like. Oh,
I have watched you from the first and noted how you have borne many
troubles that were not of your seeking, and read your heart and found
it worthy to be praised. In this land, Lord, such are not found."</p>

<p>"I am glad to hear it," I said, who had little admiration for the
Dabanda. Then to change the subject which I found somewhat personal and
embarrassing, especially to a modest man who could neither rise nor
escape, I added, "Will you do something for me, White-Mouse, and before
you go? Tell me, why I was ever brought to your land?"</p>

<p>"You wished to come, Lord; and if they be real, wishes always fulfil
themselves soon or late. Moreover, besides those you know which Kumpana
has set out to you, there are other reasons, which, even if I might
explain them, you would not understand."</p>

<p>"Why not?"</p>

<p>"Because they have to do with things which you have forgotten; yes,
with other lives that lie buried in the past, when you and I and two
great ones who dwell in the midst of Lake Mone, and Kumpana and Kaneke
knew each other, as we do today. Man's life is a long story, Lord, of
which we read but one mad chapter at a time, thinking that it is all
the book, and not knowing what went before, nor what shall follow
after."</p>

<p>Now I reflected that many wise men, of all epochs, such as Plato and
others, as I have heard, were of this opinion--one that it is not
impossible though difficult to accept at any rate in the West, whatever
the East may hold. Not wishing, however, to enter upon so vast a
subject, I merely said:</p>

<p>"And do <i>you</i> know, White-Mouse?"</p>

<p>"I know something, Lord, and I guess more. For the Dwellers in the
Lake, whom doubtless you believe to be savages blinded by the teachings
of a false faith, yet have the wisdom of our race."</p>

<p>"Yes," I answered sharply, "wisdom of which I saw the fruits last
night when a man was burned living upon your altar fire."</p>

<p>"You are wrong, Lord. In our wisdom of the Lake, cruelty has no
place, and with it she who rules the Lake has naught to do, though the
Dabanda be given to her for servants, and in a fashion, for masters.
When she learned what had chanced to Kaneke and to those whom he led
astray, she wept, though she knew that these things must come and
uttered the decree of death. Yes, we women of the Lake renounce the
world and fix our thoughts on heaven, which is our home. Therefore do
not judge us hardly, Lord, or measure us with the Dabanda rule. Now I
have done, who may say no more, save this: Have no fear upon your
journey, for we know that you will accomplish it safely and live on for
many years. Go where fortune seems to lead you and all will succeed
with you. So farewell, Lord Macumazahn. Think kindly of us of the Lake,
although we be women, for as you have learned, or will learn, women,
with all their faults, are better and wiser than men, for sometimes to
them is shown the light that is hidden from the eyes of men."</p>

<p>Then she bent down, took my hand, kissed it, and turning lifted the
curtain of the door-way of the house and glided away into the darkness,
leaving me glad that I had found one person whom I could like in
Mone-land, one, too, who liked me!</p>

<p>From the bed on the other side of the room came the stifled voice of
Hans, whom all this while I had quite forgotten, saying:</p>

<p>"Is that the last kiss, Baas, and if so, may I put out my head? It
is very hot here under this skin rug, where I have hidden my eyes for
so long without being able to breathe, Baas."</p>

<p>"Well, you haven't hidden your ears," I said, "so stop talking
rubbish and tell me what you think of White-Mouse."</p>

<p>"Oh, Baas," he said, sitting up, "I think that she is a spook, more
so than all the rest of them. But I think also that she is a nice
spook, although she did deceive me yonder in the Arab town, making me
believe that she was a jealous wife of the Owl-man Kaneke, and that she
liked me much more than she did him. Also I am happy now, Baas, because
she, who being a spook knows all about it, said that we shall come
safely to the end of our journey. But of course you are very unhappy
because you have seen the last of one of whom you think so much, that
you have even forgotten to read the letter she brought you, for reading
letters is much duller than being kissed, Baas."</p>

<p>"Bring me the lamp," I said as I loosened the string of scented
grass with which it was bound and undid the little roll.</p>

<p>It was of paper cut from a note-book, and, as I expected, from
Arkle. It ran thus:</p>

<p> </p>

<blockquote>
<p><i>Dear Quatermain,</i></p>

<p><i>We know that you are going, and I send you this by a sure hand to
bid you farewell. Do not think badly of me, Quatermain, because I have
forsaken my country and put aside all the traditions in which I was
brought up, in order to marry the priestess of a strange faith, here in
Central Africa. Love is stronger than are the ties of country or of
tradition, and in our case it is a force which will not be denied: a
destiny indeed. Probably you put little faith in the stories I have
told you of how I came to be drawn to my wife, thinking them the
harmless imaginations of a romantic mind. Therefore of them I will only
say that to me they seemed real enough and to be justified by the
event, though of course here coincidence might have played its part.
Probably, too, you set little store by the occult powers and
superstitions of this secret and ancient people, finding for all, or
most of them, a natural explanation.</i></p>

<p><i>For many reasons I wish that I could share this view, but alas! I
believe those powers to be very real. And here I want to make one thing
clear: they do not reside in the spirit of her who amongst other titles
is given that of the Engoi or rather of the Shadow of the Engoi! She is
but the medium. The strength lies with others, in the present case
principally with the head of the Council, Kumpana.</i></p>

<p><i>Did you notice the voice with which she spoke when first you saw
her upon the altar platform, and again in the boat on the day of our
marriage, and that it was not natural? At least to me it seemed very
different from that which she used when addressing me directly, as a
woman addresses the man she loves. For example she seemed to pass
sentence upon the Abanda giving them into the power of the beasts, over
which undoubtedly the Dabanda have command, and to the fate of madness,
which I learn fell upon them afterwards.</i></p>

<p><i>Yet I assure you that she never knew she had spoken these words,
any more than she knew that the rascal, Kaneke, was doomed to be burned
alive, in short they were uttered by her under an obscure, hypnotic
influence. Further, it seems that these mediumistic gifts pass away in
the course of years, and that is why the Dabanda priests kill their
Engoi at a certain age, and her husband with her and choose another
Shadow to fill her place.</i></p>

<p><i>You will say that for her and for me the prospect therefore is
terrible enough. But I want you to understand, Quatermain, that I have
no intention of sitting still and allowing such a fate to overtake us.
I mean to match myself against those priests and the Council and to
overthrow them</i>--<i>how I do not know</i>--<i>and to establish in
their place a pure and kindly rule. If I find that this is not
possible, then I mean to escape from this country with my wife. So do
not look upon us as lost, or on me as wholly a renegade and an
apostate, but rather as one who is hidden for awhile.</i></p>

<p><i>Meanwhile, I assure you that I am intensely happy and that the
book of an ancient wisdom which I thought lost to the world, is being
opened to my eyes. I would that you could see this place and the
buildings on it, and the old writings it contains in a language I have
not yet learned to decipher. But that cannot be, for any such attempt
would certainly cost you your life. So you must go your way while I go
mine, hoping that our paths may cross again, even in this
world.</i></p>

<p><i>Meanwhile, I thank you for all you have done for me, and trust
that your strange experiences may bring you some reward for your work
and the dangers you have run. God bless you, my friend, if I may call
you so, and farewell! I beg you and Hans to talk as little as possible
about me or the Dabanda and Mone, the Holy Lake. Above all, do not try
to return, or to send other white men to explore, or to search me out,
for such attempts would certainly end in death. Let me vanish away as
many a white man does in Africa, and my story with me.</i></p>

<p><i>Again farewell,</i></p>

<p><i>J. T. Arkle.</i></p>

<p><i>P.S.</i>--<i>I enclose a note addressed to the captain of the
hunters whom I left in charge of stores and equipment at a place to
which you will be guided. He can read more or less, and it commands him
to hand these over to you absolutely, and with them a sealed box that
contains a sum in gold, which I hope you will find useful. I recommend
you to head for the West Coast, as the hunters can guide you on that
road, at any rate for part of the way till you come into touch with
white men.</i></p>

<p><i>J. T. A.</i></p>
</blockquote>

<p> </p>

<p>Such was this strange letter, which I was most glad to receive. For
did it not give me hope that one day Arkle would escape from this
accursed country, either with or without the woman whom fate had
appointed to him as his wife? Further, did it not explain much, or at
any rate something, of mysteries that hitherto had been as black as
night to me? I think so.</p>

<p>Here I will stop this tale, for to describe all my adventures and
experiences on my way to the West Coast would take another book, which
I have neither the time nor the inclination to write. Suffice it to say
that all went well. I was guided to Arkle's camp, and by help of the
outfit I found there, to say nothing of the money, of which there was
much, ultimately I came to the sea and took ship back to South Africa,
where I gave it out that I had been for a long hunting-trip in
Portuguese territory.</p>

<p>"Baas," said Hans to me one day when we had been talking over Arkle
and his great passion, "what are the 'twin hearts' of which you
talk?"</p>

<p>I explained as best I could, and he replied:</p>

<p>"Baas, you remember that Kaneke said just before they put him on the
fire, that the Red Baas would follow him there one day. If that is what
must be paid for having a 'twin heart', I am glad I haven't got
one--unless it is for you, Baas!"</p>

<p>I should add that of Arkle, if this was his real name (which I
doubt), I have heard no more. Nor until now, when after many years I
write it down, have I ever told his story.</p>
