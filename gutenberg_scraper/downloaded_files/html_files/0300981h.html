<h2><a name="ch1" id="ch1">I. &mdash; THE JUNGLE</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">"My Lord, I may go no farther," said the
Cambodian.</p>

<p>The young white man turned in astonishment upon his native
guide. Behind them lay the partially cleared trail along which they
had come. It was overgrown with tall grass that concealed the
tree-stumps that had been left behind by the axes of the
road-builders. Before them lay a ravine, at the near edge of which
the trail ended. Beyond the ravine was the primitive jungle
untouched by man.</p>

<p>"Why, we haven't even started yet!" exclaimed the white man.
"You cannot turn back now. What do you suppose I hired you
for?"</p>

<p>"I promised to take my lord to the jungle," replied the
Cambodian. "There it is. I did not promise to enter it."</p>

<p>Gordon King lighted a cigarette. "Let's talk this thing over, my
friend," he said. "It is yet early morning. We can get into the
jungle as far as I care to go and out again before sundown."</p>

<p>The Cambodian shook his head. "I will wait for you here, my
lord," he said; "but I may not enter the jungle, and if you are
wise you will not."</p>

<p>"Why?" demanded King.</p>

<p>"There are wild elephants, my lord, and tigers," replied the
Cambodian, "and panthers which hunt by day as well as by
night."</p>

<p>"Why do you suppose we brought two rifles?" demanded the white.
"At Kompong-Thom they told me you were a good shot and a brave man.
You knew that we should have no need for rifles up to this point.
No, sir, you have lost your nerve at the last minute, and I do not
believe that it is because of tigers or wild elephants."</p>

<p>"There are other things deep in the jungle, my lord, that no man
may look upon and live."</p>

<p>"What, for example?" demanded King.</p>

<p>"The ghosts of my ancestors," answered the Cambodian, "the
Khmers who dwelt here in great cities ages ago. Within the dark
shadows of the jungle the ruins of their cities still stand, and
down the dark aisles of the forest pass the ancient kings and
warriors and little sad-faced queens on ghostly elephants. Fleeing
always from the horrible fate that overtook them in life, they pass
for ever down the corridors of the jungle, and with them are the
millions of the ghostly dead that once were their subjects. We
might escape My Lord the Tiger and the wild elephants, but no man
may look upon the ghosts of the dead Khmers and live."</p>

<p>"We shall be out before dark," insisted King.</p>

<p>"They are abroad both by day and by night," said the Cambodian.
"It is the curse of Siva, the Destroyer."</p>

<p>King shrugged his shoulders, stamped out his cigarette and
picked up his rifle. "Wait for me here, then," he said. "I shall be
out before dark."</p>

<p>"You will never come out," said the Cambodian.</p>

<p>Beyond the ravine, savage, mysterious, rose the jungle, its
depth screened from view by the spectral trunks of fromagers and a
tangle of bamboo. At first the man could find no opening in that
solid wall of vegetation. In its sheath, at his side, hung a heavy
knife, but already the young day was so oppressively hot that the
man did not relish the idea of exhausting himself at the very
outset of his adventure if he could find some easier way. That it
would be still hotter he knew, for Cambodia lies but twelve degrees
above the equator in the same latitude as Nicaragua, the Sudan, and
other places infamous for their heat.</p>

<p>Along the edge of the ravine he searched, until at last he was
rewarded by what appeared to be not by any means a trail but a far
less formidable growth of bamboo through which he saw that he might
easily force his way. Glancing back, he saw his Cambodian guide
squatted upon his heels in mournful meditation. For an instant the
young man hesitated, as though he was of a mind to try again to
persuade the Cambodian to accompany him; but, as though immediately
conscious of the futility of any such appeal, he turned again and
pushed his way into the jungle.</p>

<p>He had advanced but a short distance when the heavy undergrowth
gave way to a much more open forest. The spreading branches of the
lofty trees cast upon the ground a perpetual shade, which had
discouraged a heavy growth of underbrush.</p>

<p>How different looked the jungle from any picture that his
imagination had conjured! How mysterious, but above all, how gloomy
and how sinister! A fitting haunt, indeed, for the ghosts of
weeping queens and murdered kings. Beneath his breath King cursed
his Cambodian guide. He felt no fear, but he did feel an
unutterable loneliness.</p>

<p>Only for a moment did he permit the gloom of the jungle to
oppress him. He glanced at his watch, opened his pocket compass,
and set a course as nearly due north as the winding avenues of the
jungle permitted. He may have realized that he was something of a
fool to have entered upon such an adventure alone; but it was
doubtful that he would have admitted it even to himself, for,
indeed, what danger was there? He had, he thought, sufficient water
for the day; he was well armed and carried a compass and a heavy
knife for trail-cutting. Perhaps he was a little short on food, but
one cannot carry too heavy a load through the midday heat of a
Cambodian jungle.</p>

<p>Gordon King was a young American who had recently graduated in
medicine. Having an independent income, he had no need to practice
his profession; and well realizing, as he did, that there are
already too many poor doctors in the world, he had decided to
devote himself for a number of years to the study of strange
maladies. For the moment he had permitted himself to be lured from
his hobby by the intriguing mysteries of the Khmer ruins of
Angkor&mdash;ruins that had worked so mightily upon his imagination
that it had been impossible for him to withstand the temptation of
some independent exploration on his own account. What he expected
to discover he did not know; perhaps the ruins of a city more
mighty than Angkor Thom; perhaps a temple of greater magnificence
and grandeur than Angkor Wat; perhaps nothing more than a day's
adventure. Youth is like that.</p>

<p>The jungle that had at first appeared so silent seemed to awaken
at the footfall of the trespasser; scolding birds fluttered above
him, and there were monkeys now that seemed to have come from
nowhere. They, too, scolded as they hurtled through the lower
terraces of the forest.</p>

<p>He found the going more difficult than he had imagined, for the
floor of the jungle was far from level. There were gullies and
ravines to be crossed and fallen trees across the way, and always
he must be careful to move as nearly north as was physically
possible, else he might come out far from his Cambodian guide when
he sought to return. His rifle grew hotter and heavier; his canteen
of water insisted with the perversity of inanimate objects in
sliding around in front and bumping him on the belly. He reeked
with sweat, and yet he knew that he could not have come more than a
few miles from the point where he had left his guide. The tall
grasses bothered him most, for he could not see what they hid; and
when a cobra slid from beneath his feet and glided away, he
realized more fully the menace of the grasses, which in places grew
so high that they brushed his face.</p>

<p>At the end of two hours King was perfectly well assured that he
was a fool to go on, but there was a certain proportion of bulldog
stubbornness in his make-up that would not permit him to turn back
so soon. He paused and drank from his canteen. The water was warm
and had an unpleasant taste. The best that might be said of it was
that it was wet. To his right and a little ahead sounded a sudden
crash in the jungle. Startled, he cocked his rifle and stood
listening. Perhaps a dead tree had fallen, he thought, or the noise
might have been caused by a wild elephant. It was not a ghostly
noise at all, and yet it had a strange effect upon his nerves,
which, to his disgust, he suddenly realized were on edge. Had he
permitted the silly folk tale of the Cambodian to so work upon his
imagination that he translated into a suggestion of impending
danger every unexpected interruption of the vast silence of the
jungle?</p>

<p>Wiping the sweat from his face, he continued on his way, keeping
as nearly a northerly direction as was possible. The air was filled
with strange odors, among which was one more insistent than the
others&mdash;a pungent, disagreeable odor that he found strangely
familiar and yet could not immediately identify. Lazy air currents,
moving sluggishly through the jungle, occasionally brought this
odor to his nostrils, sometimes bearing but a vague suggestion of
it and again with a strength that was almost sickening; and then
suddenly the odor stimulated a memory cell that identified it. He
saw himself standing on the concrete floor of a large building, the
sides of which were lined with heavily barred cages in which lions
and tigers paced nervously to and fro or sprawled in melancholy
meditation of their lost freedom; and in his nostrils was the same
odor that impinged upon them now. However, it is one thing to
contemplate tigers from the safe side of iron bars, and it is quite
another thing suddenly to realize their near presence unrestrained
by bars of any sort. It occurred to him now that he had not
previously considered tigers as anything more serious than a noun;
they had not represented a concrete reality. But that mental
conception had passed now, routed by the odor that clung in his
nostrils. He was not afraid; but realizing for the first time, that
he was in actual danger, he advanced more warily, always on the
alert.</p>

<p>Some marshy ground and several deep ravines had necessitated
various detours. It was already almost noon, the time upon which he
was determined he must turn back in order that he might reach the
point where he had left his guide before darkness fell upon the
jungle. Constantly for some time there had lurked within his
consciousness a question as to his ability to back-track upon his
trail. He had had no experience in woodcraft, and he had already
found it far more difficult than he had imagined it would be to
maintain a true course by compass; nor had he taken the precautions
to blaze his trail in any way, as he might have done by marking the
trees with the heavy trail cutter that he carried.</p>

<p>Gordon King was disgusted with himself; he had found no ruins;
he was hot, tired and hungry. He realized that he had lost all
interest in ruins of any and all descriptions, and after a brief
rest he turned back towards the south. It was then, almost
immediately, that he realized the proportions of the task that lay
ahead of him. For six hours he had been plodding deep into the
jungle. If he had averaged two miles an hour, he had covered a
distance of twelve miles. He did not know how fast he had walked,
but he realized that twelve miles was bad enough when he considered
that he had started out fresh and well fortified by a hearty
breakfast and that he was returning empty, tired, and footsore.</p>

<p>However, he still believed that he could make the distance
easily before dark if he could keep to the trail. He was well
prepared physically by years of athletic training, having been a
field and track man at college. He was glad now that he had gone in
for long distance running; he had won a marathon or two and was
never appalled at the thought of long distances to be covered on
foot. That he could throw the javelin and hurl the discus to almost
championship distances seemed less helpful to him in an emergency
of the present nature than his running experience. His only regret
on this score was that during the year that he had been out of
college he had permitted himself to become soft&mdash;a condition
that had become increasingly noticeable with every mile that he put
behind him.</p>

<p>Within the first minute that Gordon King had been upon the
back-trail toward his guide he had discovered that it was
absolutely impossible for his untrained eyes to find any sign of
the trail that he supposed he had made coming in. The way that he
thought he had come, his compass told him, led towards the
south-west; but he could find no directing spoor.</p>

<p>With a shake of his head, he resorted again to his compass; but
due south pointed into a dense section of jungle through which he
was positive he had not come. He wondered whether he should attempt
to skirt every obstacle, thereby making long and wide detours or
continue straight toward the south, deviating from his direct line
only when confronted by insurmountable obstacles. The latter, he
felt, would be the shortest way out of the jungle in point of
distance, and he was confident that it would bring him as close to
his Cambodian guide as any other route that he might elect to
follow.</p>

<p>As he approached the patch of jungle that had seemed at first to
bar his way completely, he found that it was much more open than he
had suspected and that, while the trees were large and grew rather
close together, there was little or no underbrush. Glancing often
at his compass, he entered the gloomy forest. The heat, which had
grown intense, possibly aggravated the fatigue which he now
realized was rapidly attaining the proportions of a real menace. He
had not appreciated when he stepped out upon this foolish adventure
how soft his muscles had become, and as he contemplated the miles
and hours of torture that lay ahead of him, he suddenly felt very
helpless and alone.</p>

<p>The weight of his rifle, revolver, ammunition, and water
represented a definite handicap that he knew might easily defeat
his hope of escaping from the jungle before dark. The smell of the
great cats was heavy in the air. Against this ever-present
premonition of danger, however, was the fact that he had already
spent over six hours in the jungle without having caught a glimpse
of any of the dread Carnivore. He was convinced, therefore, that he
was in little danger of attack by day and that he might have a
better chance of getting out of the jungle before dark if he
discarded his weapons, which would unquestionably be useless to him
after dark.</p>

<p>And then again, he argued, perhaps, after all, there were no
man-eaters in the jungle, for he had heard that not all tigers were
man-eaters. For the lesser cats, the panthers and leopards, he did
not entertain so great a fear, notwithstanding the fact that he had
been assured that they were quite as dangerous as their larger
cousins. The size, the reputation and the fearful mien of My Lord
the Tiger dwarfed his estimate of the formidable nature of the
others.</p>

<p>A large, flat stone, backed by denser foliage, suggested that he
rest for a moment while deliberating upon the wisdom of abandoning
his weapons. The canteen of water, with its depleted store of warm
and unpleasant-tasting liquid, he knew he must cling to until it
had been emptied. Before he sat down upon the stone he leaned his
rifle against a tree, and unbuckling the belt which supported his
revolver and also held his ammunition, he tossed it upon the ground
at his feet. What a relief! Instantly there left him the fear that
he might not be able to get out of the jungle before dark. Relieved
of what had become a constantly increasing burden, he felt like a
new man and equal to any efforts that the return march might demand
of him. He seated himself upon the flat rock and took a very small
swallow from the contents of his canteen. He had been sparing of
his water and he was glad that he had been, for now he was
convinced that it would last him through the remainder of the day,
giving him strength and refreshment when he would most need
them.</p>

<p>As he replaced the screw cap upon his canteen, he chanced to
glance at the rock upon which he was sitting and for the first time
was struck by the fact that it seemed incongruously out of place in
the midst of this jungle of great trees and foliage. Idly he
brushed an accumulation of leaf mould from its surface, and what he
saw revealed beneath increased his curiosity sufficiently to cause
him to expose the entire surface of the rock, disclosing in bold
bas-relief the head and shoulders of a warrior.</p>

<p>Here, then, was the reward for which he had struggled; but he
found that it left him a little cold. His interest in Khmer ruins
seemed to have evaporated beneath the torrid heat of the jungle.
However, he still maintained sufficient curiosity to speculate upon
the presence of this single relic of the past. His examination of
the ruins of Angkor Thom suggested that this must have been a part
of some ancient edifice and if this were true the rest must be
close at hand&mdash;perhaps just behind the screen of jungle that
formed the background of this solitary fragment.</p>

<p>Rising, he turned and tried to peer through the foliage,
separating the leaves and branches with his hand. A few hours
before his heart would have leaped at what he glimpsed vaguely now
through the leafy screen&mdash;a vast pile of masonry through whose
crumbling arches he saw stately columns still defying the ruthless
inroads of the jungle in the lonely, hopeless battle they had been
waging through the silent centuries.</p>

<p>And then it was that, as he stood gazing, half-fascinated by the
tragic magnificence that still clung to this crumbling monument to
the transient glories and the vanities of man, his eye was
attracted by a movement within the ruins; just a glimpse he got
where a little sunlight filtered through a fallen roof&mdash;a
little patch of fawn with dark brown stripes. In the instant that
he saw it, it was gone. There had been no sound, just a passing of
something among the ruins. But Gordon King felt the cold sweat upon
his brow as hastily he gathered up his belt and buckled it about
his waist and seized his rifle. Blessed weight! He thanked God that
he had not gone on without it.</p>

<p>Forgotten were the ruins of the Khmers as he strode cautiously
on through the forest, constantly alert now, looking to the right
and to the left, and turning often a hasty glance behind him. Soft
are the pads of the carnivores. They give forth no sound. When the
end came, if it did come, he knew that there would be a sudden rush
and then the terrible fangs and talons. He experienced the uncanny
sensation of unseen eyes upon him. He was sure that the beast was
stalking him. It was maddening not to be able to see it again.</p>

<p>He found it necessary to consult his compass frequently in order
to keep to his course. His instrument was a small one, constructed
like a hunting-case watch. When the catch was released the cover
flew open, releasing the needle, which, when the cover was closed,
was locked in position, that its bearings might not be injured by
sudden changes of position.</p>

<p>King was on the point of checking his direction; but as he held
the compass open in his hand, he thought that he heard a slight
noise behind him. As he glanced back the toe of his boot struck a
rock; and trying to regain his equilibrium, he stumbled into a
patch of tumbled sandstone rocks, among which he sprawled heavily
upon his face. Spurred by thoughts of the sound that he had heard
behind him, he scrambled quickly to his feet; but though he
searched the jungle as far as his eyes could reach in every
direction, he could discern no sign of any menacing beast.</p>

<p>When he had fallen he had dropped his compass, and now that he
was satisfied that no danger lurked in his immediate vicinity, he
set about to recover the instrument. He found it quickly enough,
but one glance at it sent his heart into his boots&mdash;his
compass was broken beyond possibility of repair. It was several
seconds before the full measure of this calamity unfolded itself to
his stunned consciousness.</p>

<p>For a moment Gordon King was appalled by the accident that had
befallen him, for he knew that it was a real catastrophe.
Practically unversed in woodcraft, he found himself in a jungle
overhung by foliage so dense that it was impossible to get his
bearings from the sun, menaced by the ever-present danger of the
great cats and faced with what he felt now was definite assurance
that he would have to spend the night in these surroundings with
only a remote likelihood that he ever would be able to find his way
out in the event that he did not fall prey to the carnivores or to
thirst.</p>

<p>But only momentarily did he permit himself to be crushed by
contemplation of his predicament. He was well armed, and he knew
that he was resourceful and intelligent. Suddenly there came to him
a realization of something that gave him renewed strength and
hope.</p>

<p>Few men know until they are actually confronted by lethal danger
whether at heart they are courageous or cowardly. Never before had
Gordon King been called upon to make such an appraisal of himself.
Alone in this mysterious forest, uninfluenced by the possibilities
of the acclaim or reproaches of another, there was borne in upon
his consciousness a definite realization of self-sufficiency. He
fully realized the dangers that confronted him; he did not relish
them, but he felt no sensation of fear.</p>

<p>A new feeling of confidence pervaded him as he set out again in
the direction that he had been going before he had fallen and
broken his compass. He was still alert and watchful, but he did not
glance behind him as much as he had previously. He felt that he was
making good headway, and he was sure that he was keeping a true
course toward the south. Perhaps, after all, he would get out
before dark, he thought. The condition that irritated him most was
his increasing thirst, against which he was compelled to pit every
ounce of his will power that he might conserve the small amount of
water that remained in his canteen.</p>

<p>The route he was following was much more open than that along
which he had entered the jungle, so that he was buoyantly hopeful
that he would come out of his predicament and the jungle before
night had enveloped the gloomy haunt of the great cats; yet he
realized that at best he would win by but a small margin.</p>

<p>He was very tired now, a fact that was borne in upon him by the
frequency with which he stumbled, and when he fell he found that
each time it was only with increased effort that he rose again to
his feet. He was rather angry with himself for this seeming
weakness. He knew that there was only one thing that he could do to
overcome it, and that thing he could not afford to do, for the
fleeting minutes of precious daylight would not pause in their
flight while he rested.</p>

<p>As the miles fell slowly and painfully behind him and the
minutes raced as though attempting to escape him and leave him to
the mercy of the darkness and the tigers, the hope that had been
newborn in him for a while commenced to desert him; yet he stumbled
wearily on, wondering if the jungle had no end and hoping against
hope that beyond the next wall of verdure he would break through
into the clearing that would mean life and food and water for
him.</p>

<p>"It can't be far now," he thought, "and there must be an hour of
full daylight ahead." He was almost exhausted; a little rest would
renew his strength, he knew, and there, just ahead of him, was a
large, flat rock. He would rest for a moment upon it and renew his
strength.</p>

<p>As he seated himself upon this hard resting-place, something
upon its surface caught his horrified gaze. It was the head and
shoulders of a warrior, cut in bold bas-relief.</p>

of men experience a hopelessness of utter despair. Such was King's
state of mind when he realized that he had wandered in an aimless
circle since noon and was back again at his starting-point.
Weakened by physical exhaustion and hunger, he contemplated the
future with nothing but pessimism. He had had his chance to escape
from the jungle, and he had failed. There was no reason to believe
that another day might bring greater opportunity. Rest might recoup
his strength slightly, but what he needed was food, and on the
morrow he would set forth not with a canteen full of water, but
with only a few drops with which to moisten his parched throat. He
had stumbled through plenty of mud-holes during the day, but he
knew that it would doubtless prove fatal to drink from such wells
of pollution.</p>

<p>As he stood there with bowed head, searching his mind for some
solution of his problem, his eyes gradually returned to focus, and
as they did so he saw on the surface of the soft ground beneath his
gaze something that, for the moment, drove thoughts of hunger and
thirst and fatigue from his mind&mdash;it was the pug of a tiger,
fresh made in the soft earth.</p>

<p>"Why worry about tomorrow?" murmured King. "If half what that
Cambodian told me about this place at night is true, I'll be in
luck if I see another tomorrow."</p>

<p>He had read somewhere that tigers started to hunt late in the
afternoon, and he knew that they seldom climbed trees; but he was
also aware of the fact that leopards and panthers do and that the
latter, especially, on account of their size and inherent
viciousness, were fully as much to be dreaded as My Lord the Tiger
himself. Realizing that he must find some sort of shelter as
quickly as possible and recalling the ruins that he had seen
through the screen of foliage behind the rock before which he
stood, he parted the leafy screen ahead of him and forced his way
through.</p>

<p>Here the vegetation was less dense, as though the lesser growth
of the jungle had halted in fearful reverence before this
awe-inspiring work of man. Majestic even in its ruin was the great
rectangular pile that loomed clearly now before the eyes of the
American. But not all of the jungle had feared to encroach upon its
sanctity. Great trees had taken root upon its terraced walls, among
its columns and its arches, and by the slow and resistless pressure
of their growth had forced aside the supporting foundation and
brought much of the edifice into complete ruin.</p>

<p>Just before him rose a tower that seemed better to have
withstood the ravages of time than other portions of the building.
It rose some sixty feet above the ground, and near the summit was
carved in heroic size the face of a god that King suspected was
Siva, the Destroyer. A few feet above the rectangular doorway was a
crumbling ledge and just above that a smaller opening that might
have been a window. Behind it all was dark, but it carried to
King's mind the suggestion of a hiding-place&mdash;a sanctuary in
the very bosom of Siva.</p>

<p>The face of the weather-worn tower offered sufficient foothold
for an agile climber, and the way was made easier by the corbeled
construction that supported a series of bas-reliefs rising one
above another from the ground level to the edge above the doorway.
It was not, however, without considerable difficulty that King,
already almost exhausted, finally reached the ledge, where he sat
down for a moment's rest. Just above him was the opening which he
wished to investigate. As he let his thoughts precede him in that
investigation of this possible refuge, they discovered, as thoughts
are prone to do, enough unpleasant possibilities to cast a pall of
gloom over him. Doubtless it was the den of a panther.</p>

<p>What more secluded spot could this horrid beast discover in
which to lie up after feeding or in which to bear and rear its
young?</p>

<p>The suggestion forced him to immediate action. He did not
believe that there was any panther there, but he could not endure
the suspense of doubt. Cocking his rifle, he arose and approached
the opening, the lower sill of which was just about level with his
breast as he stood upon the ledge above the doorway. Within all was
black and silent. He listened intently. If there were anything
hiding there, he should hear it breathe; but no sound broke the
utter silence of the tomb-like vault. Pushing his rifle ahead of
him, King climbed to the sill, where he remained in silence for a
moment until his eyes became accustomed to the gloom of the
interior, which was slightly relieved by light filtering in through
a crack at one side. A few feet below him was a stone floor, and he
could see dimly now that the chamber extended the full breadth and
width of the tower. In the center of the apartment rose something,
the nature of which he could not distinguish; but he was sure that
it was inanimate.</p>

<p>Stepping down to the floor and advancing cautiously, his rifle
ready, King made a complete circuit of the walls. There was no
panther there, nor any signs that one ever had been there.
Apparently the place had never been entered by any creature since
that day of mystery, centuries gone, when the priests and temple
girls had departed never to return. Turning toward the object in
the center of the room, King quickly identified it as the symbol of
Siva and realized that he was doubtless in the Holy of Holies.</p>

<p>Walking back to the window, he seated himself upon the sill,
took a small swallow from his scant store of water and lighted a
cigarette; and as the sudden night fell upon the jungle, he heard
the crisp fall of padded feet upon dry leaves in the courtyard of
the temple beneath him.</p>

<p>His position, well above the floor of the jungle, imparted a
feeling of security; and the quiet enjoyment of a cigarette soothed
his nerves and, temporarily at least, allayed the gnawing pangs of
hunger. He derived a form of mild enjoyment by speculating upon the
surprise and consternation of his friends could they visualize his
present situation. Perhaps uttermost in his thoughts was Susan Anne
Prentice, and he knew that he would be in for a good scolding could
she be aware of the predicament into which his silly and
ill-advised adventure had placed him.</p>

<p>He recalled their parting and the motherly advice she had given
him. What a peach of a girl Susan Anne was! It seemed strange to
him that she had never married, for there were certainly enough
eligible fellows always hanging around her. He was rather glad that
she had not, for he realized that he should feel lost without the
promise of her companionship when he returned home. He had known
Susan Anne as far back as he could remember, and they had always
been pals. In the city of their birth their fathers' grounds
adjoined and there was no fence between; at the little lake where
they spent their summers they were next-door neighbors. Susan Anne
had been as much a part of Gordon King's life as had his father or
his mother, for each was an only child and they had been as close
to one another as brother and sister.</p>

<p>He remembered telling her, the night before he had left home for
this trip, that she would doubtless be married by the time he
returned. "No chance," she had said with an odd little smile.</p>

<p>"I do not see why not," he had argued. "I know at least half a
dozen men who are wild about you."</p>

<p>"Not the right one," she had replied.</p>

<p>"So there is someone?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps."</p>

<p>He wondered who the fellow could be and decided that he must be
an awful chump not to appreciate the wonderful qualities of Susan
Anne. In so far as looks were concerned, she had it on all the
girls of his acquaintance, in addition whereto she had a good head
on her shoulders and was a regular fellow in every other respect.
Together they had often bemoaned the fact that she was not a man,
that they might have palled around on his wanderings together.</p>

<p>His reveries were blasted by a series of low, coughing roars
down there somewhere in the darkness at a little distance from the
ruins. They were followed by a crashing sound, as of a large body
dashing through underbrush. Then there was a scream and a thud,
followed by low growls and silence. King felt his scalp tingle.
What tragedy of the jungle night had been enacted in that black,
mysterious void?</p>

<p>The sudden and rather terrifying noise and its equally abrupt
cessation but tended to impress upon the man and to accentuate the
normal, mysterious silence of the jungle. He knew that the jungle
teemed with life; yet, for the most part, it moved as silently as
might the ghosts of the priests and the temple girls with which
imagination might easily people this crumbling ruin of the temple
of the Destroyer. Often from below him and from the surrounding
jungle came the suggestion of noises&mdash;furtive, stealthy sounds
that might have been the ghosts of long-dead noises. Sometimes he
could interpret these sounds as the cracking of a twig or the
rustling of leaves beneath a padded paw, but more often there was
just the sense of things below him&mdash;grim and terrible
creatures that lived by death alone.</p>

<p>And thus the night wore on, until at last day came. He had dozed
intermittently, sitting upon the window ledge with his back against
its ancient stone frame, his rifle across his lap. He did not feel
much refreshed, but when the full light of the day had enveloped
the jungle he clambered swiftly down the ruins to the ground and
set out once again toward the south, filled with a determination to
push on regardless of hunger and fatigue until he had escaped the
hideous clutches of this dismal forest, which now seemed to him to
have assumed a malignant personality that was endeavoring to foil
his efforts and retain him for ever for some sinister purpose of
its own. He had come to hate the jungle; he wanted to shout aloud
against it the curses that were in his heart. He was impelled to
discharge his rifle against it as though it were some creature
barring his way to liberty. But he held himself in leash,
submerging everything to the desire for escape.</p>

<p>He found that he moved more slowly than he had upon the
preceding day. Obstacles were more difficult to surmount, and he
was forced to stop more often to rest. These delays galled him; but
when he tried to push on more rapidly he often stumbled and fell,
and each time he found it more difficult to arise. Then there
dawned upon him the realization that he might not have sufficient
strength to reach the edge of the jungle, and for the first time
unquestioned fear assailed him.</p>

<p>He sat down upon the ground and, leaning his back against a
tree, argued the matter out thoroughly in his own mind. At last his
strength of will overcame his fears, so that realization of the
fact that he might not get out that day no longer induced an
emotional panic.</p>

<p>"If not today, tomorrow," he thought; "if not tomorrow, then the
day after. Am I a weakling that I cannot carry on for a few days?
Am I to die of starvation in a country abounding in game?"</p>

<p>Physical stamina being so considerably influenced as it is by
the condition of the mind, it was with a sense of renewed power
that King arose and continued on his way, but imbued now not solely
with the desire to escape immediately from the jungle but to wrest
from it sustenance and strength that it might be forced to aid him
in his escape even though the consummation of his hope might be
deferred indefinitely. The psychological effect of this new mental
attitude wrought a sudden metamorphosis. He was no longer a hunted
fugitive fleeing for his life; he had become in fact a jungle
dweller hunting for food and for water. The increasing heat of the
advancing day had necessitated inroads upon his scant supply of the
latter, yet he still had a few drops left; and these he was
determined not to use until he could no longer withstand the
tortures of thirst.</p>

<p>He had by now worked out a new and definite plan of procedure;
he would work constantly downhill, keeping a sharp look out for
game, knowing that eventually he must come to some of the numerous
small streams that would ultimately lead him to the Mekong, the
large central river that bisects Cambodia on its way to the China
Sea; or perchance he might hit upon one of those streams that ran
south and emptied into the Tonle-Sap.</p>

<p>He found it much easier going downhill, and he was glad on this
account that he had adopted his present plan. The nature of the
country changed a little, too; open spaces were more numerous.
Sometimes these flats were marshy, requiring wide detours, and
usually they were covered with elephant grass that resembled the
cat tails with which he had been familiar as a boy during his
summer vacations in the country. He did not like these spaces
because they appeared too much the natural habitat of snakes, and
he recalled having read somewhere that in a single year there had
been sixteen thousand recorded deaths from snake bites in British
India alone. This recollection came to him while he was in the
center of a large patch of elephant grass, and consequently he
moved very slowly, examining the ground ahead of him carefully at
each step. This, of course, necessitated pushing the reeds apart, a
slow and laborious procedure; but it also resulted in his moving
more quietly; so that when he emerged from the reeds a sight met
his eyes that doubtless he would not have seen had he crashed
through noisily.</p>

<p>Directly in front of him and maybe fifty paces distant under a
great spreading banyan tree lay several wild pigs, all of them
comfortably asleep except one old boar, which seemed to be on
guard. That King's approach had not been entirely noiseless was
evidenced by the fact that the great beast was standing head-on and
alert, his ears up-pricked, looking straight at the point at which
the man emerged from the elephant grass.</p>

<p>For an instant man and beast stood silently eyeing one another.
King saw lying near the boar a half-grown pig, that would make
better eating than the tough old tusker. He brought his rifle to
his shoulder and fired at the sleeping pig, expecting the remainder
of the herd to turn and flee into the jungle; but he had not taken
into consideration the violent disposition of the boar. The rest of
the herd, awakened with startling suddenness by the unaccustomed
report of the rifle, leaped to their feet, stood for an instant in
bewilderment, and then turned and disappeared among the
undergrowth. Not so the boar. At the crack of the rifle he
charged.</p>

<p>There is something rather awe-inspiring in the charge of a wild
boar, especially if one happens to be in the path of it, as King
was. Perhaps because of his unfamiliarity with the habits of wild
boars, the charge was entirely unexpected; and in the brief instant
that he had in which to defend himself, he realized that he did not
know what was the most vulnerable spot in a boar's anatomy. All
that he sensed in that all too short interval were a pair of great
flashing tusks, huge jowls, two red-rimmed wicked little eyes, and
a stiffly upright tail bearing down upon him with all the velocity
and apparently quite the weight of a steam locomotive.</p>

<p>There seemed to be nothing to shoot at but a face. His first
shot struck the boar squarely between the eyes and dropped him, but
only for an instant. Then he was up again and coming. Giving thanks
for a magazine rifle, King pumped three more bullets straight into
that terrifying countenance, and to the last one the great beast
rolled over against King's feet. None too sure that he had more
than stunned him, the man quickly put a bullet through the savage
heart.</p>

<p>It had been a close call, and he trembled a little to think what
his fate might have been had he been seriously wounded and left
there dying in the jungle. Assured that the boar was dead, he went
quickly to the pig that had been killed instantly by his first
shot. As his knife sank into the flesh, he became suddenly
conscious of a change within him. He was moved by urgings that he
had never sensed before. He was impelled to bury his teeth in the
raw flesh and gorge himself. He realized that this was partially
the result of gnawing hunger; but yet it seemed deeper, something
primitive and bestial that always had been a part of him but that
never before had had occasion to come to the surface. He knew in
that brief instant the feeling of the wild beast for its kill. He
looked quickly and furtively about to see if there might be any
creature bold enough to contest his possession of the fruit of his
prowess. He felt the snarling muscles of his upper lip tense and he
sensed within him the rumblings of a growl, though no sound passed
his lips.</p>

<p>It required a determined effort of will power to refrain from
eating the flesh raw, so hungry was he; but he managed to conquer
the urge and set about building a fire, though the meal that he
finally produced was scarcely more than a compromise, the meat
being charred upon the outside and raw within. After he had eaten
he felt renewed strength, but now the tortures of thirst assailed
him more poignantly than before. His canteen was empty; and though
he had passed by stagnant pools of water during the day, he had
been able to resist the temptation to drink, realizing, as he did,
the germs of terrible fever that lurked in these slimy pools.</p>

<p>The next few days constituted a long nightmare of suffering and
disappointment. He found his path toward the Mekong barred by
impassable swamps that forced him northward over a broken terrain
of ravines and ridges that taxed his rapidly waning strength. For
some time after leaving the marshes he had seen no water, but upon
the third day he came to a pool in the bottom of a ravine. That it
was the drinking-hole of wild beasts was evidenced by the multitude
of tracks in the muddy bank. The liquid was green and thick, but
not for an instant did the man hesitate. Throwing himself upon his
belly, he plunged his hands and face into the foul mess and drank.
Neither fever nor death could be worse than the pangs of
thirst.</p>

<p>Later that day he shot a monkey and, cooking some of the flesh,
appeased his hunger; and thus for several days he wandered,
shooting an occasional monkey for food and drinking water wherever
he found it. He was always conscious of the presence of the great
cats, though only upon one or two occasions did he catch fleeting
glimpses of them; but at night he heard them moving softly beneath
some tree in which he had found precarious sanctuary, where he
crouched nursing the hope that no leopard or panther would discover
him. Occasionally he saw small herds of wild elephants, and these
he always gave a wide berth. He had long given up all hope of
escaping from the jungle, and he could not but wonder at man's
tenacity in clinging to life in the face of suffering and hardship
when he knew that at best he was but prolonging his agony and only
temporarily delaying the inevitable.</p>

<p>Seven days and seven nights he had spent in the jungle, and the
last night had been the worst of all. He had dozed intermittently.
The jungle had been full of noises, and he had seen strange, dim
figures passing beneath him. When the eighth morning broke, he was
shivering with cold. His chattering teeth reminded him of
castanets. He looked about him for dancers and was surprised that
he saw none. Something moved through the foliage of the jungle
beneath him. It was yellowish-brown with dark stripes. He called to
it and it disappeared. Quite remarkably he ceased to be cold, and
instead his body burned as though consumed by internal fires. The
tree in which he sat swayed dizzily, and then with an effort he
pulled himself together and slipped to the ground. He found that he
was very tired and that he was forced to stop to rest every few
minutes, and sometimes he shook with cold and again he burned with
heat.</p>

<p>It was about noon; the sun was high and the heat terrific. King
lay shivering where he had fallen at the foot of a silk-cotton
tree, against the bole of which he leaned for support. Far down a
jungle aisle he saw an elephant. It was not alone; there were other
things preceding it&mdash;things that could not be in this deserted
primeval jungle. He closed his eyes and shook his head. It was only
an hallucination brought on by a touch of fever, of that he was
certain. But when he opened his eyes again the elephant was still
there, and he recognized the creatures that preceded it as warriors
clothed in brass. They were coming closer. King crawled back into
the concealing verdure of the underbrush. His head ached terribly.
There was a buzzing hum in his ears that drowned all other sounds.
The caravan passed within fifty feet of him, but he heard no sound.
There were archers and spear men&mdash;brown men with cuirasses of
burnished brass&mdash;and then came the elephant trapped in regal
splendor, and in a gorgeous howdah upon its back rode a girl. He
saw her profile first, and then as something attracted her
attention she turned her face full toward him. It was a face of
exquisite and exotic beauty, but a sad face with frightened eyes.
Her trappings were more gorgeous than the trappings of the
elephant. Behind her marched other warriors, but presently all were
gone down the aisles of the jungle in spectral silence.</p>

<p>"Weeping queens on misty elephants!" He had read the phrase
somewhere in a book. "Gad!" he exclaimed. "What weird tricks fever
plays upon one's brain. I could have sworn that what I saw was
real."</p>

<p>Slowly he staggered to his feet and pushed on, whither or in
what direction he had no idea. It was a blind urge of
self-preservation that goaded him forward; to what goal, he did not
know; all that he knew was that if he remained where he was he must
inevitably perish. Perhaps he would perish anyway, but if he went
on, there was a chance. Figures, strange and familiar, passed in
jumbled and fantastic procession along the corridors of his mind.
Susan Anne Prentice clothed in brass rode upon the back of an
elephant. A weeping queen with painted cheeks and rouged lips came
and knelt beside him offering him a draft of cold, crystal-clear
water from a golden goblet, but when he lifted it to his lips the
goblet became a battered canteen from which oozed a slimy green
liquid that burned his mouth and nauseated him. Then he saw
soldiers in brass who held platters containing steaming sirloin
steaks and French-fried potatoes, which changed magically to
sherbet, iced tea, and waffles with maple syrup.</p>

<p>"This will never do," thought King. "I am going absolutely
daffy. I wonder how long the fever lasts, or how long it takes to
finish a fellow."</p>

<p>He was lying upon the ground at the edge of a little clearing
partially hid by the tall grass into which he had sunk. Suddenly
everything seemed to whirl around in circles, and then the world
went black and he lost consciousness. It was very late in the
afternoon when he came to; but the fever seemed to have left him,
temporarily at least, and his mind was clear.</p>

<p>"This can't go on much longer," he soliloquized. "If I don't
find some place pretty soon where I can lie in safety until after
the fever has passed entirely, it will be just too bad. I wonder
what it feels like to be mauled by a tiger."</p>

<p>But when he attempted to rise he discovered to his horror that
he had not sufficient strength to get to his feet. He still clung
to his rifle. He had long since made up his mind that in it lay his
principal hope of salvation. Without it, he must go hungry and fall
prey to the first beast that attacked him. He knew that if he
discarded it and his heavy belt of ammunition he might stagger on a
short distance and then, when he fell again, he would be
helpless.</p>

<p>As he lay there looking out into the little clearing,
speculating upon his fate and trying to estimate the number of
hours of life that might remain to him, he saw a strange figure
enter the clearing. It was an old man with a straggly white beard
growing sparsely upon his chin and upper lip. He wore a long,
yellow cloak and a fantastic headdress, above which he carried a
red umbrella. He moved slowly, his eyes bent upon the ground.</p>

<p>"Damned fever," muttered King, and shut his eyes.</p>

<p>He kept them closed for a minute or two, but when he opened them
the old man was still in sight, though by this time he had almost
crossed the clearing, and now there was another figure in the
picture. From out of the foliage beyond the clearing appeared a
savage, snarling face&mdash;a great, vicious, yellow-fanged face;
yellowish-white and tan with broken markings of dark brown stripes
that looked almost black&mdash;a hideous head, and yet, at the same
time, a gorgeously majestic head. Slowly, silently the great tiger
emerged into the clearing, its gaunt, flat-sided body moving
sinuously, its yellow-green eyes blazing terribly at the back of
the unconscious old man.</p>

<p>"God, how real!" breathed King. "I could swear that I really saw
them both. Only the impossible figure of that old man with the red
parasol could convince me that they are both made of the same
material as the spectral elephant, the weeping queen, and the
brass-bound soldiers."</p>

<p>The tiger was creeping rapidly toward the old man. His speed
gradually accelerated.</p>

<p>"I can't stand it," cried King, raising his rifle to his
shoulder. "They may be only an hallucination&mdash;"</p>

<p>There was a short coughing roar as the tiger charged, and at the
same instant King squeezed the trigger of his rifle and
fainted.</p>

<h2><a name="ch3" id="ch3">III. &mdash; THE HUNTER</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">Vay Thon, high priest of the temple of Siva in the
city of Lodidhapura, was the source of much anxiety on the part of
the lesser priests, who felt responsible to Siva and the King for
the well-being of Vay Thon. But how might one cope with the
vagaries of a weakness so holy and, at the same time, so erratic as
that which occasionally claimed the amnesic Vay Thon? They tried to
watch over him at all times, but it is difficult to maintain
constant espionage over one so holy, whose offices or whose
meditations may not lightly be broken in upon by lesser mortals,
even though they be priests of the great god, Siva.</p>

<p>All was well when Vay Thon confined himself in his meditations
to the innermost sanctum of the Holy of Holies; here, in the
safe-keeping of his god, he was isolated from mankind and safe from
danger. But the meditations of Vay Thon were not always thus
securely cloistered. Often he strolled along the broad terrace
beside the mighty temple, where wrapped in utter forgetfulness of
himself and of the world he walked in silent communion with his
god.</p>

<p>With his long, yellow cloak and his red parasol he was also a
familiar figure upon the streets of Lodidhapura. Here he was often
accompanied by lesser priests, who walked in cuirasses of polished
brass, who marched ahead and in the rear. Of all these symbols of
worldly pomp and power, Vay Thon was entirely unconscious. During
those periods that he was wrapped in the oblivion of meditation and
upon the numerous occasions when he had managed to leave the temple
ground unperceived, he had walked through the streets of the city
equally unaware of all that surrounded him. Upon three separate and
distinct occasions he had been found wandering in the jungle, and
Lodivarman, the King, had threatened to wreak dire punishment upon
the lesser priests should harm ever befall Vay Thon during one of
these excursions.</p>

<p>It so happened that upon this very day Vay Thon had walked out
of the city and into the jungle alone. That he had been able to
leave a walled city, the gates of which were heavily guarded by
veteran warriors, might have seemed a surprising thing to the
citizens of Lodidhapura; but not so to the one familiar with the
secret galleries that lay beneath the temple and the palace,
through which the ancient builders of Lodidhapura might well have
expected to flee the wrath of the downtrodden slaves who comprised
75 per cent of the population. Though times have changed with the
passing centuries, the almost forgotten passageways remain. It was
through one of these that Vay Thon reached the jungle. He did not
know that he was in the jungle. He was as totally oblivious of his
surroundings as is one who is wrapped in deep and dreamless
sleep.</p>

<p>The last that the lesser priests had seen of Vay Thon was when
he had entered the Holy of Holies, which houses the symbol of Siva.
As they had noticed a glassy expression in his eyes, they had known
that he was entering upon a period of meditation. Therefore, they
maintained a watch at the entrance to the chamber, but felt no
concern during the passing hours since they knew that Vay Thon was
safe. What they did not know of was the loose stone in the flooring
of the chamber directly behind the symbol of Siva, or the
passageway beneath, which led to a ravine in the jungle beyond the
city wall. And so during those hours Vay Thon wandered far into the
jungle, and with him, perhaps, walked Siva, the Destroyer.</p>

<p>His rapt meditation, which amounted to almost total
unconsciousness of his mundane surroundings, was shattered by a
noise of terrific violence such as had never before impinged upon
the ears of Vay Thon or any other inhabitant of Lodidhapura,
Awakened suddenly as from a deep sleep, the startled priest wheeled
about amazed at his surroundings, but more amazed by the sight
which greeted his eyes. Wallowing in its own gore scarce three
paces behind him lay a great tiger in its death throes; and a
little to his right, a wisp of blue smoke rose from some grasses at
the edge of the clearing.</p>

<p>When King regained consciousness he was vaguely aware of voices
that seemed to be floating in the air about him. The sounds were
meaningless, but they conveyed to his fevered brain an assurance of
human origin. He opened his eyes. Above him was a brown face.
Supporting his head and shoulders he felt the naked flesh of a
human arm. His eyes wandered. Standing close was a woman, naked but
for a sampot drawn diaperwise between her legs and knotted at the
belt. Hiding fearfully behind her was a naked child. The man who
supported him spoke to him, but in a language that he could not
understand.</p>

<p>From whence had these people come, or were they but figments of
his fevered imagination like the old man with the yellow cloak and
the red parasol? Were they no more real than the spectral tiger
that he had shot at in his delirium? He closed his eyes in an
effort to gain control of his senses, but when he opened them again
the man and the woman and the child were still there. With a sigh
of resignation he gave it up. His throbbing temples were unequal to
the demands of sustained thought. He closed his eyes, and his chin
dropped upon his breast.</p>

<p>"He is dying," said Che, looking up at the woman.</p>

<p>"Let us take him to our dwelling," replied Kangrey, the woman.
"I will watch over him while you lead the holy priest back to
Lodidhapura."</p>

<p>As the man lifted King in his arms and turned to carry him away,
the American caught a glimpse of an old man in a long, yellow cloak
and a strange headdress, who carried above his head a red parasol.
The American closed his eyes against the persistent hallucination
of his fever. His head swam, and once again he lost
consciousness.</p>

<p>King never knew how long he remained unconscious, but when he
next opened his eyes he found himself lying upon a bed of grasses
in the interior of a dark retreat which he thought, at first, was a
cave. Gradually he discerned the presence of a man, a woman, and a
child. He did not remember ever having seen them before. The child
was naked, and the man and woman were clothed only in sampots. The
woman was ministering to him, forcing a liquid between his
lips.</p>

<p>Slowly and sluggishly his mind commenced to function, and at
last he recalled them&mdash;the creatures of the hallucination that
had conjured the image of the old man in the yellow cloak with the
red parasol, and the charging tiger that he had dreamed of
shooting. Would the fever never leave him? Was he to die thus alone
in the somber jungle tortured by hallucinations that might
terminate only with his discovery by a tiger?</p>

<p>But yet how real was the feeling and taste of the liquid that
the woman was forcing between his lips. He could even feel the
animal warmth of the bare arm that was supporting his head and
shoulders. Could any figment of a fever-tortured brain be as
realistic as these? Repeatedly he closed his eyes and opened them
again, but always the same picture was there before him. He raised
one hand weakly and touched the woman's shoulder and face. They
seemed real. He was almost convinced that they were when he sank
again into unconsciousness.</p>

<p>For days Gordon King hovered between life and death. Kangrey,
the woman, ministered to him, utilizing the lore of the primitive
jungle dweller in the brewing of medicinal potions from the herbs
of the forest. Of equal or perhaps greater value were certain
incantations which she droned monotonously above him.</p>

<p>Little Uda, the child, was much impressed with all these unusual
and remarkable occurrences. The stranger with the pale skin was the
first momentous event of his little life. The strange clothing that
his parents had removed from their helpless charge thrilled him
with awe, as did the rifle, the knife, and the revolver, which he
rightfully guessed to be weapons, though he had no more conception
of the mechanism of the firearms than did his parents. Uda was
indefatigable in his search for the herbs and roots that Kangrey,
his mother, required; and when Che returned from the hunt it was
always Uda who met him first with a full and complete history of
their patient's case brought down to the last minute with infinite
attention to details.</p>

<p>At last the fever broke. Though it left King weak and helpless
in body, his mind was clear, and he knew at last that the man and
the woman and the child were no figments of his imagination. Of
course, the old man with the yellow cloak and the red parasol had
been but an hallucination of a kind with the charging tiger; but
this kindly brown woman, who was nursing him back to health, was
real; and his eyes filled as the thanks which he could not voice
welled up within his breast.</p>

<p>A day and a night without any return of the fever or
hallucination convinced King that the ministration of the kindly
natives had rid him of the illness that had nearly killed him, yet
he was so weak that he still had little or no hope of ultimate
recovery. He had not the strength to raise a hand to his face. It
required a real physical effort to turn his head from side to side
upon the rough pallet of grasses upon which he lay. He noticed that
they never left him alone for long. Either the woman or the child
was with him during the day, and all three slept near him upon the
floor of their little den at night. In the daytime the woman or the
child brushed the flies and other insects from him with a leafy
branch and gave him food at frequent intervals. What the food was
he did not know except that it was semi-liquid, but now that his
fever had passed he was so ravenous that whatever it was they gave
him he relished it.</p>

<p>One day when he had been left alone with the little boy longer
than usual, the child, possibly tiring of the monotony of brushing
insects from the body of the pale one, deserted his post, leaving
King alone. King did not care, for much of his time, anyway, was
spent in sleep and he had become so accustomed to the insects that
they no longer irritated him as they formerly had. He was awakened
from a sleep by the feel of a rough hand upon his face. Opening his
eyes, he saw a monkey squatting beside him. When King opened his
eyes the animal leaped nimbly away, and then the American saw that
there were several monkeys in the chamber. They were quite the
largest that he had seen in the jungle, and in his helpless
condition he knew that they might constitute a real menace to his
life. But they did not attack him, nor did they come close to him
again; and it soon became evident that their visit was prompted
solely by curiosity.</p>

<p>A little later he heard a scraping sound behind him in one
corner of the chamber. Having regained his strength during the past
few days sufficiently to be able to move his head and hands with
comparative ease, he turned his head to see what was going on. The
sight that met his eyes would have been highly amusing had it not
been fraught with the possibility of such unhappy results.</p>

<p>The monkeys had discovered his weapons and his clothing. All had
congregated at the point of interest. They were dragging the things
about and chattering excitedly. They seemed to be quarrelling about
something; and their chattering and scolding rose in volume until
finally one old fellow, who was apparently contesting possession of
the rifle with two others, leaped angrily upon them, growling and
biting. Instantly the other two relinquished their holds upon the
firearm and scurried to a far corner of the chamber; whereupon the
victor seized the weapon again and dragged it toward the
doorway.</p>

<p>"Hey!" shouted King in the loudest voice he could muster. "Drop
that; and get out of here!"</p>

<p>The sound of the human voice seemed to startle the monkeys, but
not sufficiently to cause them to relinquish the purpose they had
in mind. It is true that they scampered from the chamber, but they
gathered up all of King's belongings and took them with them, even
to his socks.</p>

<p>King shouted to the boy whom he had heard the parents address as
Uda; but when at last the little chap came, breathless and
frightened, it was too late to avert or remedy the catastrophe,
even if King had been able to explain to Uda what had happened.</p>

<p>The night when she returned, Kangrey found her patient very
weak, but she did not guess the cause of it since she could not
know that in the mind of the pale one was implanted the conviction
that his only hope for eventual escape from the jungle had lain in
the protection that the stolen weapons would have afforded him.</p>

<p>The days and nights wore slowly on as gradual convalescence
brought returning strength to the sick man. To while away the
tedious hours he sought to learn the language of his benefactors;
and when, finally, they understood his wish they entered with such
spirit into its consummation that he found himself deluged with
such a variety of new words that his mind became fogged with
information. But eventually some order and understanding came out
of the chaos, so that presently he was able to converse with Che
and Kangrey and Uda. Thereafter his existence was far less
monotonous; but his slow recovery irked and worried him, for it
seemed impossible that his strength ever would return. He was so
emaciated that it was well for his peace of mind that he had no
access to any mirrors.</p>

<p>Yet surely though slowly, his strength was returning. From
sitting up with his back against the wall he came at length to
standing upon his feet once more; and though he was weak and
tottering, it was a beginning; and each day now he found his
strength returning more rapidly.</p>

<p>From talking with Che and Kangrey, King had learned the details
of the simple life they led. Che was a hunter. Some days he brought
back nothing, but as a rule he did not return without adding to the
simple larder. The flesh was usually that of a monkey or bird or
one of the small rodents that lived in the jungle. Fish he brought,
too, and fruit and vegetables and sometimes wild honey.</p>

<p>Che and Kangrey and Uda were equally proficient in making fires
with a primitive fire stick, which they twirled between the palms
of their hands. Kangrey possessed a single pot in which all food
was cooked. It was a brass pot, the inside of which she kept
scrupulously polished, using earth and leaves for this purpose.</p>

<p>Che was, indeed, a primitive hunter, armed with a spear, bow and
arrows, and a knife. When King explained to him the merits of the
firearms that had been stolen by the monkeys, Che sympathized with
his guest in their loss; but he promised to equip King with new
weapons such as he himself carried; and King expressed his
gratitude to the native, though he could not arouse within himself
much enthusiasm at the prospect of facing a long trip through this
tiger-infested forest armed only with the crude weapons of
primitive man, even were he skilled in their use.</p>

<p>As King's strength had returned, he had tried to keep together
in his mind the happenings that had immediately preceded his
illness, but he always felt that the old man with the yellow cloak
and the red parasol and the charging tiger that had fallen to a
single shot were figments of a fever-tortured brain. He had never
spoken to Che and Kangrey about the hallucination because it seemed
silly to do so; yet he found its memory persisting in his mind as a
reality rather than an hallucination, so that at last, one evening,
he determined to broach the subject, approaching it in a roundabout
way.</p>

<p>"Che," he said, "you have lived in the jungle a long while, have
you not?"</p>

<p>"Yes," replied the native. "For five years I was a slave in
Lodidhapura, but then I escaped, and all the rest of my life I have
spent in the jungle."</p>

<p>"Did you ever see an old man wandering in the jungle," continued
King, "an old man who wore a long yellow cloak and carried a red
parasol?"</p>

<p>"Of course," replied Che, "and you saw him, too. It was Vay
Thon, whom you saved from the charge of My Lord the Tiger."</p>

<p>King looked at the native in open-mouthed astonishment. "Have
you had a touch of fever too, Che?" he asked.</p>

<p>"No," replied the native. "Che is a strong man; he is never
ill."</p>

<p>"No," Kangrey said proudly. "Che is a very strong man.
In all the years that I have known him, he has never been
ill."</p>

<p>"Did you see this old man with the yellow cloak and the red
parasol, Kangrey?" asked King, skeptically.</p>

<p>"Of course I did. Why do you ask?" inquired the woman.</p>

<p>"And you saw me kill the tiger?" demanded the American.</p>

<p>"I did not see you kill him; but I heard a great noise, and I
saw him after he had died. There was a little round hole just
behind his left ear; and when Che cut him open to see why he died,
he found a piece of metal in his brain, the same metal that the
walls of the palace of Lodivarman are covered with."</p>

<p>"That is lead," said Che with an air of superiority.</p>

<p>"Then you mean to tell me that this old man and the tiger were
real?" demanded King.</p>

<p>"What do you think they were?" asked Che.</p>

<p>"I thought they were of the same stuff as were the other dreams
that the fever brought into my brain," replied King.</p>

<p>"No," said Che, "they were not dreams. They were real. And it
was good for you and for me and for Vay Thon that you killed the
tiger, though how you did it neither Vay Thon nor I can
understand."</p>

<p>"It was certainly good for Vay Thon," said King.</p>

<p>"And good for you and for me," insisted Che.</p>

<p>"Why was it so good for us?" asked the American.</p>

<p>"Vay Thon is the high priest of Siva in the city of Lodidhapura.
He is very powerful. Only Lodivarman, the King, is more powerful.
Vay Thon had wandered far from the city immersed in deep thought.
He did not know where he was. He did not know how to return to
Lodidhapura. Kangrey and I are runaway slaves of Lodidhapura. Had
we been discovered before this happened, we should have been
killed; but Vay Thon promised us our freedom if I would lead him
back to the city. In gratitude to you for having saved his life he
charged Kangrey and me to nurse you back to health and to take care
of you. So you see it was good for all of us that you killed the
tiger that would have killed Vay Thon."</p>

<p>"And you would not have nursed me back to health, Che, had Vay
Thon not exacted the promise from you?" inquired King.</p>

<p>"We are runaway slaves," said the native. "We fear all men, or
until Vay Thon promised us our freedom, we did fear all men; and it
would have been safer for us to let you die, since you were unknown
to us and might have carried word to the soldiers of Lodidhapura
and led them to our hiding-place."</p>

<p>For a time King remained in silent thought, wondering, in view
of what he had just heard, where the dividing line had lain between
reality and hallucination. "Perhaps, then," he said with a smile,
"the weeping queen on the misty elephant and the many soldiers in
cuirasses of polished brass were real too."</p>

<p>"You saw those?" asked Che.</p>

<p>"Yes," replied King.</p>

<p>"When and where?" demanded the native excitedly.</p>

<p>"It could not have been very long before I saw the high priest
and the tiger."</p>

<p>"They are getting close," said Che nervously to Kangrey. "We
must search for another hiding-place."</p>

<p>"You forget the promise of Vay Thon," Kangrey reminded him. "We
are free now; we are no longer slaves."</p>

<p>"I had forgotten," said Che. "I am not yet accustomed to
freedom, and perhaps I think, too, that possibly Vay Thon may
forget."</p>

<p>"I do not think so," said the woman. "Lodivarman might forget,
but not Vay Thon, for Vay Thon is a good man. Every one in
Lodidhapura said so."</p>

<p>"You really believe that I saw an elephant, a queen, and
soldiers?" demanded King.</p>

<p>"Why not?" asked Che.</p>

<p>"There are such things in the jungle?" inquired the young
man.</p>

<p>"Of course," said Kangrey.</p>

<p>"And this city of Lodidhapura?" demanded King. "I have never
heard of it before. Is that close beside the jungle?"</p>

<p>"It is in the jungle," said Che.</p>

<p>King shook his head. "It is strange," he said. "I wandered
through the jungle for days and never saw signs of a human being or
a human habitation."</p>

<p>"There are many things in the jungle which men do not always
see," replied Che. "There are the Nagas and the Yeacks. You may be
glad that you did not see them."</p>

<p>"What are the Nagas and the Yeacks?" asked King.</p>

<p>"The Nagas are the Cobra people," replied Che. "They live in a
great palace upon a mountain and are very powerful. They have seven
heads and can change themselves into any form of creature that they
desire. They are workers of magic. It is said that Lodivarman's
principal wife is the queen of the Nagas and that she changed
herself into the form of a beautiful woman that she might rule
directly over the mortals as well as the gods. But I do not believe
that, because no one, not even a Naga, would choose to be the queen
of a leper. But the Yeacks are most to be feared because they do
not live far away upon a mountain-top, but are everywhere in the
jungle."</p>

<p>"What are they like?" asked King.</p>

<p>"They are horrible Ogres who live upon human flesh," replied
Che.</p>

<p>"Have you ever seen them?" asked King.</p>

<p>"Of course not," replied the native. "Only he who is about to be
devoured sees them."</p>

<p>Gordon King listened with polite attention to the folk tales of
Che and Kangrey, but he knew that they were only legends of a kind
with the fabulous city of Lodidhapura and its Leper King,
Lodivarman. He was somewhat at a loss to account for Vay Thon, the
high priest, but he decided finally that the old man was an
eccentric hermit who had come into the jungle to live and that to
him might be attributed many of the fabulous tales that Che and
Kangrey narrated so glibly. That his two friends were runaway
slaves from the fabulous city of Lodidhapura, King doubted,
attributing their story to the desire of primitive minds to inject
a strain of romance into their otherwise monotonous lives.</p>

<p>As King's strength returned rapidly, he insisted more and more
upon getting out into the open. He was anxious to accompany Che
upon his hunting trips, but the native insisted that he was not yet
sufficiently strong. So the American had to content himself with
remaining with Kangrey and Uda at home, where he practised using
the weapons that Che had made for him, which consisted of a bow and
arrow and a short, heavy javelin-like spear. Thanks to the training
of his college days, King was proficient in the use of the latter;
and he practised assiduously with his bow and arrows until his
marksmanship aroused the admiring applause of even Kangrey, who
considered Che the best bowman in the world, to whose expert
proficiency no other mortal might hope to attain.</p>

<p>The dwelling of Che and Kangrey and Uda was in an ancient Khmer
ruin and consisted of a small room which had withstood the march of
the centuries&mdash;a room that was peculiarly suited to the
requirements of the little jungle family since it had but a single
entrance, a small aperture that could be effectually blocked at
night with a flat slab of stone against the depredations of
marauding cats.</p>

<p>Their existence was as simple and primitive as might have been
that of the first man; yet there was inherent in it an undeniable
charm that King felt in spite of the monotony and his anxiety to
escape from the jungle.</p>

<p>Che knew nothing but the jungle and the fabulous city of
Lodidhapura. It is difficult for us to conceive of an endless
infinity of space, but Che could imagine an endless jungle. The
question of limitation did not enter his mind and, therefore, did
not confuse him. To him, the world was a jungle. When King realized
this, he knew, too, that it was hopeless to expect Che to attempt
to lead him out of a jungle that he believed had no end.</p>

<p>For some time King had been making short excursions into the
jungle in search of game while he repeatedly sought to impress upon
Che that he was strong enough to accompany the native upon his
hunts; but he was met with so many excuses that he at last awoke to
the fact that Che did not want him along; and so the American
determined to set out by himself upon a prolonged and determined
effort to prove his efficiency. He left one morning after Che had
departed, turning his steps in a different direction from that
taken by the native. He was determined to bring back something to
demonstrate his prowess to Che, but though he moved silently
through the jungle, keeping the sharpest look out, he saw no sign
of game of any description; and having had past experience of the
ease with which one might become lost in the jungle, he turned back
at last empty-handed.</p>

<p>During his long convalescence King had had an opportunity to
consider many things, and one of them had been his humiliating lack
of jungle craft. He knew, therefore, that he must mark the trail in
some way if he were to hope to return to the dwelling of Che and
Kangrey. He could not blaze the trees with his knife on a hunting
excursion since the noise would unquestionably frighten away the
game, and so he invented several other ways of marking the
trail&mdash;sticking twigs in the rough bark of trees that he
passed, scraping the ground with the sharp point of his javelin,
and placing three twigs in the form of an arrow, pointing backward
along the trail over which he had come. Accordingly, he had little
difficulty today in back-tracking along the way to the home of
Che.</p>

<p>Practising jungle craft necessitated moving as noiselessly as
possible, and so it was that he came as silently as might a hunting
cat to the edge of the ruin where lay the dwelling of his friend.
As King came within sight of the familiar entrance, a scene met his
eyes that froze his blood and brought his heart into his throat. In
the small clearing that Che had made, little Uda was at play. He
was digging with a sharp stick in the leafy mould of the ground,
while watching him at the edge of the clearing crouched a great
panther.</p>

<p>King saw the beast gradually drawing its hind feet well beneath
its body as it prepared to charge.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch4" id="ch4">IV. &mdash; FOU-TAN</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">Returning early from a successful hunt, Che
approached the clearing. He, too, moved silently, for thus he
always moved through the jungle. Along a forest aisle he could see
the clearing before he reached it. He saw Uda digging among the dry
leaves, which made a rustling sound that would have drowned the
noise of the approach of even a less careful jungle animal than
Che. The father smiled as his eyes rested upon his first-born, but
in the same instant the smile froze to an expression of horror as
he saw a panther leap into the clearing.</p>

<p>Kangrey, emerging at that moment from their gloomy dwelling, saw
it too, and screamed as she rushed forward barehanded, impelled by
the mother instinct to protect its young. And then, all in the same
brief instant, Che saw a heavy javelin streak lightning-like from
the jungle. He saw the panther crumple in its charge, and as he ran
forward he saw the pale one leap into the clearing and snatch Uda
into his arms.</p>

<p>Che, realizing, as had King, the fury of a wounded panther,
rushed upon the scene with ready spear as the pale one tossed Uda
to Kangrey and turned again to face the great cat. But there was no
necessity for the vicious thrust with which Che drove his spear
into the carcass of the beast, for the panther was already
dead.</p>

<p>For a moment they stood in silence, looking down upon the
kill&mdash;four primitive jungle people, naked but for sampots. It
was King's first experience of a thrill of the primitive hunter. He
trembled a little, but that was reaction to the fear that he had
felt for the life of little Uda.</p>

<p>"It is a large panther," said Che simply.</p>

<p>"Only a strong man could have slain it thus," said Kangrey.
"Only Che could thus have slain with a single cast so great a
panther."</p>

<p>"It was not the spear of Che. It was the spear of the pale one
that laid low the prince of darkness," said Che.</p>

<p>Kangrey looked her astonishment and would not be convinced until
she had examined the spear that protruded from beneath the left
shoulder of the great cat. "This, then, is the reward that Vay Thon
said would be ours if we befriended the pale one," she
declared.</p>

<p>Uda said nothing, but, squirming from his mother's arms, he ran
to the side of the dead panther and belabored it with his little
stick.</p>

<p>The next day Che invited King to accompany him upon his hunt.
When after a hard day they returned empty-handed, King was
convinced that in the search for small game a lone hunter would
have greater chances for success. In the morning, therefore, he
announced that he would hunt alone in another part of the jungle,
and Che agreed with him that this plan would be better.</p>

<p>Marking his trail as he had before, King hunted an unfamiliar
territory. The forest appeared more open. There was less
underbrush; and he had discovered what appeared to be a broad
elephant trail, along which he moved with far greater speed than he
had ever been able to attain before in his wanderings through this
empire of trees and underbrush.</p>

<p>He had no luck in his hunting; and when he had about determined
that it was time to turn back, his ears caught an unfamiliar sound.
What it was he did not know. There was a peculiar metallic ring and
other sounds that might have been human voices at a distance.</p>

<p>"Perhaps," soliloquized King, "I am about to see the Nagas or
the Yeacks."</p>

<p>The sound was steadily approaching; and as he had learned enough
from his intercourse with Che and Kangrey to know that no friendly
creatures might be encountered in the jungle, he drew to one side
of the elephant trail and concealed himself behind some
shrubbery.</p>

<p>He had not waited long when he saw the authors of the sounds
approaching. Suddenly he felt his head. It did not seem over-hot.
As he had upon other similar occasions, he closed his eyes tightly
and then opened them again, but still the vision persisted&mdash;a
vision of brown-skinned soldiers in burnished brass cuirasses over
leather jerkins that fell midway between their hips and their
knees, with heavy sandals on their feet, strange helmets on their
heads, and armed with swords and spears and bows and arrows.</p>

<p>They came on talking among themselves, and as they passed close
to King he discovered that they spoke the same language that he had
learned from Che and Kangrey. Evidently the men were arguing with
their leader, who wanted to go on, while the majority of his
followers seemed in favor of turning back.</p>

<p>"We shall have to spend the night in the jungle as it is," said
one. "If we go on much farther, we shall have to spend two nights
in the jungle. Only a fool would choose to lair with My Lord the
Tiger."</p>

<p>They had stopped now almost opposite King, so that he could
clearly overhear all that passed between them. The man in charge
appeared to be a petty officer with little real authority, for
instead of issuing orders he argued and pleaded.</p>

<p>"It is well enough for you to insist upon turning back," he
said, "since if we return to the city without the apsara you
expect that I alone shall be punished; but let me tell you that, if
you force me to turn back, the entire truth will be made known and
you will share in any punishment that may be inflicted upon
me."</p>

<p>"If we cannot find her, we cannot find her," grumbled one of the
men. "Are we to remain in the jungle the rest of our lives
searching for a runaway apsara?"</p>

<p>"I would as lief face My Lord the Tiger in the jungle for the
rest of my life," replied the petty officer, "as face Lodivarman if
we return without the girl."</p>

<p>"What Vama says is true," said another. "Lodivarman, the King,
will not be interested in our reason for returning empty-handed.
Should we return to the city tomorrow without the girl and Vama
charged that we had forced him to turn back, Lodivarman, if he were
in ill-humor, as he usually is, would have us all put to death; but
if we remain away for many days and then return with a story of
many hardships and dangers he will know that we did all that might
be expected of brave warriors, and thus the anger of Lodivarman
might be assuaged."</p>

<p>"At last," commented Vama, "you are commencing to talk like
intelligent and civilized men. Come, now, and let us resume the
search."</p>

<p>As they moved away King heard one of the men suggest that they
find a safe and comfortable camp site where they might remain for a
sufficient length of time to impress upon the King the verity of
the story that they would relate to him. He waited only until they
were out of sight before he arose from his place of concealment,
for he was much concerned with the fact that they were proceeding
in the general direction of the dwelling of Che and Kangrey. King
was much mystified by what he had seen. He knew that these soldiers
were no children of a fevered brain. They were flesh and blood
warriors and for that reason a far greater mystery than any of the
creatures he had seen in his delirium, since they could not be
accounted for by any process of intelligent reasoning. His judgment
told him that there were no warriors in this uninhabited jungle and
certainly none with the archaic accoutrements and weapons that he
had seen. It might be reasonable to expect to meet such types in an
extravaganza of the stage or screen; and, doubtless, centuries ago
warriors such as these patrolled this very spot which the jungle
and the tiger and the elephant had long since reclaimed.</p>

<p>He recalled the stories that his guide had told him of the
ghosts of the ancient Khmers, which roamed through the somber
aisles of the forest. He remembered the other soldiers that he had
seen and the girl with the frightened eyes that rode upon the great
elephant, and the final result was a questioning of his own sanity.
Since he knew that a fever, such as the one through which he had
passed, might easily affect one's brain either temporarily or
permanently, he was troubled and not a little frightened as he made
his way in the direction of the dwelling of Che and Kangrey. But
the fact that he took a circuitous route that he might avoid the
warriors indicated that either he was quite crazy or, at least,
that he was temporizing with his madness.</p>

<p>"'Weeping queens on misty elephants!'" he soliloquized.
"'Warriors in brass!' 'A mystery of the Orient.' Perhaps after all
there are ghosts. There has been enough evidence accumulated during
historic times to prove that the materialization of disembodied
spirits may have occurred upon countless occasions. That I never
saw a ghost is not necessarily conclusive evidence that they do not
exist. There are many strange things in the Orient that the western
mind cannot grasp. Perhaps, after all, I have seen ghosts; but if
so, they certainly were thoroughly materialized, even to the dirt
on their legs and the sweat on their faces. I suppose I shall have
to admit that they are ghosts, since I know that no soldiers like
them exist in the flesh anywhere in the world."</p>

<p>As King moved silently through the jungle, he presented an even
more anachronistic figure than had the soldiers in brass; for they,
at least, personified an era of civilization and advancement, while
King, to all outward appearances, was almost at the dawn of human
evolution&mdash;a primitive hunter, naked but for a sampot of
leopard skin and rude sandals fashioned by Kangrey because the
soles of his feet, innocent of the callouses that shod hers and
Che's, had rendered him almost helpless in the jungle without this
protection. His skin was brown from exposure to the sun, and his
hair had grown thick and shaggy. That he was smooth-shaven was the
result of chance. He had always made it a habit, since he had taken
up the study of medicine and surgery, to carry a safety razor blade
with him, for what possible emergency he could not himself have
explained. It was merely an idiosyncrasy, and it had so chanced
that among several other things that the monkeys had dropped from
his pockets and scattered in the jungle the razor blade had been
recovered by little Uda along with a silver pencil and a handful of
French francs.</p>

<p>He moved through the jungle with all the assurance of a man who
has known no other life, so quickly does humankind adapt itself to
environment. Already his ears and his nostrils had become inured to
their surroundings to such an extent, at least, as to permit them
to identify and classify easily and quickly the more familiar
sounds and odors of the jungle. Familiarity had induced increasing
self-assurance, which had now reached a point that made him feel he
might soon safely set out in search of civilization. However,
to-day his mind was not on this thing; it was still engaged in an
endeavor to solve the puzzle of the brass-bound warriors. But
presently the baffling contemplation of this matter was rudely
interrupted by a patch of buff coat and black stripes of which he
caught a momentary, fleeting glimpse between the boles of two trees
ahead of him.</p>

<p>A species of unreasoning terror that had formerly seized him
each time that he had glimpsed the terrifying lord of the jungle
had gradually passed away as he had come to recognize the fact that
every tiger that he saw was not bent upon his destruction and that
nine times out of ten it would try to get out of his way. Of
course, it is the tenth tiger that one must always reckon with; but
where trees are numerous and a man's eyes and ears and nose are
alert, even the tenth tiger may usually be circumvented.</p>

<p>So now King did not alter his course, though he had seen the
tiger directly ahead of him. It would be time enough to think of
retreat when he found that the temper and intentions of the tiger
warranted it, and, further, it was better to keep the brute in
sight than to feel that perhaps he had circled and was creeping up
behind one. It was, therefore, because of this that King pushed on
a little more rapidly; and soon he was rewarded by another glimpse
of the great carnivore and of something else, which presented a
tableau that froze his blood.</p>

<p>Beyond the tiger and facing it stood a girl. Her wide eyes were
glassy with terror. She stood as one in a trance, frozen to the
spot, while toward her the great cat crept. She was a slender girl,
garbed as fantastically as had been the soldiers that had passed
him in the jungle shortly before; but her gorgeous garments were
soiled and torn, and even at a distance King could see that her
face and arms were scratched and bleeding. In the instant that his
eyes alighted upon her he sensed something strangely familiar about
her. It was a sudden, wholly unaccountable impression that
somewhere he had seen this girl before; but it was only a passing
impression, for his whole mind now was occupied with her terrifying
predicament.</p>

<p>To save her from the terrible death creeping slowly upon her
seemed beyond the realms of possibility, and yet King knew that he
must make the attempt. He recognized instantly that his only hope
lay in distracting the attention of the tiger. If he could center
the interest of the brute upon himself, perhaps the girl might
escape.</p>

<p>He shouted, and the tiger wheeled about. "Run!" he cried to the
girl. "Quick! Make for a tree!"</p>

<p>As he spoke, King was running forward. His heavy spear was ready
in his hand, but yet it was a mad chance to take. Perhaps he forgot
himself and his own danger, thinking only of the girl. The tiger
glanced back at the girl, who, obeying King's direction, had run
quickly to a nearby tree into which she was trying to scramble,
badly hampered by the long skirt that enveloped her.</p>

<p>For only an instant did the tiger hesitate. His short and ugly
temper was fully aroused now in the face of this rude interruption
of his plan. With a savage snarl and then the short coughing roars
with which King was all too familiar, he wheeled and sprang toward
the man in long, easy bounds. Twelve to fifteen feet he covered in
a single leap. Flight was futile. There was nothing that King could
do but stand his ground and pit his puny spear against this awful
engine of destruction.</p>

<p>In that brief instant there was pictured upon the screen of his
memory a tree-girt athletic field. He saw young men in shirts and
shorts throwing javelins. He saw himself among them. It was his
turn now. His arm went back. He recalled how he had put every ounce
of muscle, weight, and science into that throw. He recalled the
friendly congratulations that followed it, for every one knew
without waiting for the official verdict that he had broken a
world's record.</p>

<p>Again his arm flew back. Today there was more at stake than a
world's record, but the man did not lose his nerve. Timed to the
fraction of an instant, backed by the last ounce of his weight and
his skill and his great strength, the spear met the tiger in
mid-leap; full in the chest it struck him. King leaped to one side
and ran for a tree, his single, frail hope lying in the possibility
that the great beast might be even momentarily disabled.</p>

<p>He did not waste the energy or the time even to glance behind
him. If the tiger were able to overtake him, it must be totally a
matter of indifference to King whether the great brute seized him
from behind or in front&mdash;he had led his ace and he did not
have another.</p>

<p>No fangs or talons rent his flesh as King scrambled to the
safety of the nearest tree. It was not without a sense of
considerable surprise that he found himself safely ensconced in his
leafy sanctuary, for from the instant that the tiger had turned
upon him in its venomous charge he had counted himself already as
good as dead.</p>

<p>Now that he had an opportunity to look about him, he saw the
tiger struggling in its death throes upon the very spot where it
had anticipated wreaking its vengeance upon the rash man-thing that
had dared to question its right to the possession of its intended
prey; and a little to the right of the dying beast the American saw
the girl crouching in the branches of a tree. Together they watched
the death throes of the great cat; and when at last the man was
convinced that the beast was dead, he leaped lightly to the ground
and approached the tree among the branches of which the girl had
sought safety.</p>

<p>That she was still filled with terror was apparent in the
strained and frightened expression upon her face. "Go away!" she
cried. "The soldiers of Lodivarman, the King, are here; and if you
harm me they will kill you."</p>

<p>King smiled. "You are inconsistent," he said, "in invoking the
protection of the soldiers from whom you are trying to escape; but
you need not fear me. I shall not harm you."</p>

<p>"Who are you?" she demanded.</p>

<p>"I am a hunter who dwells in the jungle," replied King. "I am
the protector of high priests and weeping queens, or so, at least,
I seem to be."</p>

<p>"High priests? Weeping queens? What do you mean?"</p>

<p>"I have saved Vay Thon, the high priest, from My Lord the
Tiger," replied King; "and now I have saved you."</p>

<p>"But I am no queen and I am not weeping," replied the girl.</p>

<p>"Do not disillusion me," insisted King. "I contend that you are
a queen, whether you weep or smile. I should not be surprised to
learn that you are the queen of the Nagas. Nothing would surprise
me in this jungle of anachronism, hallucination, and
impossibility."</p>

<p>"Help me down from the tree," said the girl. "Perhaps you are
mad, but you seem quite harmless."</p>

<p>"Be assured, your majesty, that I shall not harm you," replied
King, "for presently I am sure there will emerge from nowhere ten
thousand elephants and a hundred thousand warriors in shining brass
to succor and defend you. Nothing seems impossible after what I
have witnessed; but come, let me touch you; let me assure myself
that I am not again the victim of a pernicious fever."</p>

<p>"May Siva, who protected me from My Lord the Tiger a moment ago,
protect me also from this madman!"</p>

<p>"Pardon me," said King. "I did not catch what you said."</p>

<p>"I am afraid," said the girl.</p>

<p>"You need not be afraid of me," King assured her; "and if you
want your soldiers I believe that I can find them for you; but if I
am not mistaken, I believe that you are more afraid of them than
you are of me."</p>

<p>"What do you know of that?" demanded she.</p>

<p>"I overheard their conversation while they halted near me,"
replied the American, "and I learned that they are hunting for you
to take you back to someone from whom you escaped. Come, I will
help you down. You may trust me."</p>

<p>He raised his hands toward her, and after a moment's hesitation
she slipped into his arms and he lowered her to the ground.</p>

<p>"I must trust you," she said. "There is no other way, for I
could not remain for ever in the tree; and then, too, even though
you seem mad there is something about you that makes me feel that I
am safe with you."</p>

<p>As he felt her soft, lithe body momentarily in his arms, King
knew that this was no tenuous spirit of a dream. For an instant her
small hand touched his shoulder, her warm breath fanned his cheek,
and her firm, young breasts were pressed against his naked body.
Then she stepped back and surveyed him.</p>

<p>"What manner of man are you?" she demanded. "You are neither
Khmer nor slave. Your color is not the color of any man that I have
ever seen, nor are your features those of the people of my race.
Perhaps you are a reincarnation of one of those ancients of whom
our legends tell us; or perhaps you are a Naga who has taken the
form of man for some dire purpose of your own."</p>

<p>"Perhaps I am a Yeack," suggested King.</p>

<p>"No," she said quite seriously, "I am sure you are not a Yeack,
for it is reported that they are most hideous, while you, though
not like any man I have ever seen, are handsome."</p>

<p>"I am neither Yeack nor Naga," replied King.</p>

<p>"Then perhaps you are from Lodidhapura&mdash;one of the
creatures of Lodivarman."</p>

<p>"No," replied the man. "I have never been to Lodidhapura. I have
never seen the King, Lodivarman, and, as a matter of fact, I have
always doubted their existence."</p>

<p>The girl's dark eyes regarded him steadily. "I cannot believe
that," she said, "for it is inconceivable that there should be
anyone in the world who has not heard of Lodidhapura and
Lodivarman."</p>

<p>"I come from a far country," explained King, "where there are
millions of people who never heard of the Khmers."</p>

<p>"Impossible!" she cried.</p>

<p>"But nevertheless quite true," he insisted.</p>

<p>"From what country do you come?" she asked.</p>

<p>"From America."</p>

<p>"I never heard of such a country."</p>

<p>"Then you should be able to understand that I may never have
heard of Lodidhapura," said the man.</p>

<p>For a moment the girl was silent, evidently pondering the logic
of his statement. "Perhaps you are right," she said finally. "It
may be that there are other cities within the jungle of which we
have never heard. But tell me&mdash;you risked your life to save
mine&mdash;why did you do that?"</p>

<p>"What else might I have done?" he asked.</p>

<p>"You might have run away and saved yourself."</p>

<p>King smiled, but he made no reply. He was wondering if there
existed any man who could have run away and left one so beautiful
and so helpless to the mercies of My Lord the Tiger.</p>

<p>"You are very brave," she continued presently. "What is your
name?"</p>

<p>"Gordon King."</p>

<p>"Gordon King," she repeated in a soft, caressing voice. "That is
a nice name, but it is not like any name that I have heard
before."</p>

<p>"And what is your name?" asked King.</p>

<p>"I am called Fou-tan," she said, and she eyed him intently, as
though she would note if the name made any impression upon him.</p>

<p>King thought Fou-tan a pretty name, but it seemed banal to say
so. He was appraising her small, delicate features, her beautiful
eyes and her soft brown skin. They recalled to him the weeping
queen upon the misty elephant that he had seen in his delirium, and
once again there arose within him doubts as to his sanity. "Tell
me," he said suddenly. "Did you ever ride through the jungle on a
great elephant escorted by soldiers in brass?"</p>

<p>"Yes," she said.</p>

<p>"And you say that you are from Lodidhapura?" he continued.</p>

<p>"I have just come from there," she replied.</p>

<p>"Did you ever hear of a priest called Vay Thon?"</p>

<p>"He is the high priest of Siva in the city of Lodidhapura," she
replied.</p>

<p>King shook his head in perplexity. "It is hard to know," he
murmured, "where dreams end and reality begins."</p>

<p>"I do not understand you," she said, her brows knit in
perplexity.</p>

<p>"Perhaps I do not understand myself," he admitted.</p>

<p>"You are a strange man," said Fou-tan. "I do not know whether to
fear you or trust you. You are not like any other man I have ever
known. What do you intend to do with me?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps I had better take you back to the dwelling of Che and
Kangrey," he said, "and then tomorrow Che can guide you back to
Lodidhapura."</p>

<p>"But I do not wish to return to Lodidhapura," said the girl.</p>

<p>"Why not?" demanded King.</p>

<p>"Listen, Gordon King, and I shall tell you," said Fou-tan.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch5" id="ch5">V. &mdash; THE CAPTURE</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">"Let us sit down upon this fallen tree," said
Fou-tan, "and I shall tell you why I do not wish to return to
Lodidhapura."</p>

<p>As they seated themselves, King became acutely conscious of the
marked physical attraction that this girl of a forgotten age
exercised over him. Every movement of her lithe body, every gesture
of her graceful arms and hands, each changing expression of her
beautiful face and eyes were provocative. She radiated magnetism.
He sensed it in the reaction of his skin, his eyes, his nostrils.
It was as though ages of careful selection had produced her for the
purpose of arousing in man the desire of possession, and yet there
enveloped her a divine halo of chastity that aroused within his
breast the protective instinct that governs the attitude of a
normal man toward a woman that Fate has thrown into his keeping.
Never in his life had King been similarly attracted to any
woman.</p>

<p>"Why do you look at me so?" she inquired suddenly.</p>

<p>"Forgive me," said King simply. "Go on with your story."</p>

<p>"I am from Pnom Dhek," said Fou-tan, "where Beng Kher is king.
Pnom Dhek is a greater city than Lodidhapura; Beng Kher is a
mightier king than Lodivarman.</p>

<p>"Bharata Rahon desired me. He wished to take me to wife. I
pleaded with my father the&mdash;I pleaded with my father not to
give me in marriage to Bharata Rahon; but he told me that I did not
know my own mind, that I only thought that I did not like Bharata
Rahon, that he would make me a good husband, and that after we were
married I should be happy.</p>

<p>"I knew that I must do something to convince my father that my
mind and soul sincerely revolted at the thought of mating with
Bharata Rahon, and so I conceived the idea of running away and
going out into the jungle that I might prove that I preferred death
to the man my father had chosen for me.</p>

<p>"I did not want to die. I wanted them to come and find me very
quickly, and when night came I was terrified. I climbed into a tree
where I crouched in terror. I heard My Lord the Tiger pass beneath
in the darkness of the night, and my fear was so great that I
thought that I should faint and fall into his clutches; yet when
day came again I was still convinced that I would rather lie in the
arms of My Lord the Tiger than in those of Bharata Rahon, who is a
loathsome man whose very name I detest.</p>

<p>"Yet I moved back in the direction of Pnom Dhek, or rather I
thought that I did, though now I am certain that I went in the
opposite direction. I hoped that searchers sent out by my father
would find me, for I did not wish to return of my own volition to
Pnom Dhek.</p>

<p>"The day dragged on and I met no searchers, and once again I
became terrified, for I knew that I was lost in the jungle. Then I
heard the heavy tread of an elephant and the clank of arms and
men's voices, and I was filled with relief and gratitude, for I
thought at last that the searchers were about to find me.</p>

<p>"But when the warriors came within view, I saw that they wore
the armour of Lodivarman. I was terrified and tried to escape them,
but they had seen me and they pursued me. Easily they overtook me,
and great was their joy when they looked upon me.</p>

<p>"'Lodivarman will reward us handsomely,' they cried, 'when he
sees that which we have brought to him from Pnom Dhek.'</p>

<p>"So they placed me in the howdah upon the elephant's back and
took me through the jungle to Lodidhapura, where I was immediately
taken into the presence of Lodivarman.</p>

<p>"Oh, Gordon King, that was a terrible moment. I was terrified
when I found myself so close to the leper king of Lodidhapura. He
is covered with great sores, where leprosy is devouring him. That
day he was ugly and indifferent. He scarcely looked at me, but
ordered that I should be taken to the quarters of the apsaras,
and so I became a dancing girl at the court of the leper king.</p>

<p>"Not in a thousand years, Gordon King, could I explain to you
what I suffered each time that we came before Lodivarman to dance.
Each sore upon his repulsive body seemed to reach out to seize and
contaminate me. It was with the utmost difficulty that, half
fainting, I went through the ritual of the dance.</p>

<p>"I tried to hide my face from him, for I knew that I was
beautiful and I knew the fate of beautiful women in the court of
Lodivarman.</p>

<p>"But at last, one day, I realized that he had noticed me. I saw
his dead eyes following me about. We were dancing in the great hall
where he holds his court. Lodivarman was seated upon his throne.
The lead-covered walls of the great apartment were gorgeous with
paintings and with hangings. Beneath our feet were the polished
flagstones of the floor, but they seemed softer to me than the
heart of Lodivarman.</p>

<p>"At last the dance was done, and we were permitted to retire to
our apartments. Presently there came to me a captain of the King's
household, resplendent in his gorgeous trappings.</p>

<p>"'The King has looked upon you,' said he, 'and would honor you
as befits your beauty.'</p>

<p>"'It is sufficient honor,' I replied, 'to dance in the palace of
Lodivarman.'</p>

<p>"'You are about to receive a more signal manifestation of the
King's honor,' he replied.</p>

<p>"'I am satisfied as I am,' I said.</p>

<p>"'It is not for you to choose, Fou-tan,' replied the messenger.
'The King has chosen you as his newest concubine. Rejoice,
therefore, in the knowledge that some day you may become
queen.'</p>

<p>"I could have fainted at the very horror of the suggestion. What
could I do? I must gain time. I thought of suicide, but I am young,
and I do not wish to die. 'When must I come?' I asked.</p>

<p>"'You will be given time to prepare yourself,' replied the
messenger. 'For three days the women will bathe and anoint your
body, and upon the fourth day you will be conducted to the
King.'</p>

<p>"Four days! In four days I must find some way in which to escape
the horrid fate to which my beauty had condemned me. 'Go!' I said.
'Leave me in peace for the four days that remain to me of even a
semblance of happiness in life.'</p>

<p>"The messenger, grinning, withdrew, and I threw myself upon my
pallet and burst into tears. That night the apsaras were to dance
in the moonlight in the courtyard before the temple of Siva; and
though they would have insisted that my preparation for the honor
that was to be bestowed upon me should commence at once, I begged
that I might once more, and for the last time, join with my
companions in honoring Siva, the Destroyer.</p>

<p>"It was a dark night. The flares that illumined the courtyard
cast a wavering light in which exaggerated shadows of the apsara
danced grotesquely. In the dance I wore a mask, and my position was
at the extreme left of the last line of apsaras. I was close to
the line of spectators that encircled the courtyard, and in some of
the movements of the dance I came quite close enough to touch them.
This was what I had hoped for.</p>

<p>"All the time that I was dancing I was perfecting in my mind the
details of a plan that had occurred to me earlier in the day. The
intricate series of postures and steps, with which I had been
familiar since childhood, required of me but little mental
concentration. I went through them mechanically, my thoughts wholly
centered upon the mad scheme that I had conceived. I knew that at
one point in the dance the attention of all the spectators would be
focused upon a single apsara, whose position was in the center of
the first line, and when this moment arrived I stepped quickly into
the line of spectators.</p>

<p>"Those in my immediate vicinity noticed me, but to these I
explained that I was ill and was making my way back to the temple.
A little awed by my close presence, they let me pass unmolested,
for in the estimation of the people the persons of the apsaras
are almost holy.</p>

<p>"Behind the last line of the audience rose a low wall that
surrounds the temple courtyard. Surmounting it at intervals rise
the beautifully carved stone figures of the seven-headed
cobra&mdash;emblem of the Royal Nagas. Deep were the shadows
between them; and while all eyes were fixed upon the leading
apsara, I clambered quickly to the top of the low wall, where for
a moment I hid in the shadow of a great Naga. Below me, black,
mysterious, terrifying, lay the dark waters of the moat, beneath
the surface of which lived the crocodiles placed there by the King
to guard the Holy of Holies. Upon the opposite side the level of
the water was but a few inches below the surface of the broad
avenue that leads to the stables where the King's elephants are
kept. The avenues were deserted, for all who dwelt within the walls
of the royal enclosure were watching the dance of the
apsaras.</p>

<p>"To Brahma, to Vishnu, and to Siva I breathed a prayer, and then
I slid as quietly as possible down into the terrifying waters of
the moat. Quickly I struck out for the opposite side, every instant
expecting to feel the hideous jaws of a crocodile close upon me;
but my prayers had been heard, and I reached the avenue in
safety.</p>

<p>"I was forced to climb two more walls before I could escape from
the royal enclosure and from the city. My wet and bedraggled
costume was torn, and my hands and face were scratched and bleeding
before I succeeded.</p>

<p>"At last I was in the jungle, confronted by danger more deadly,
yet far less horrible, than that from which I had escaped. How I
survived that night and this day I do not know. And now the end
would have come but for you, Gordon King."</p>

<p>As King gazed at the sensitive face and delicately moulded
figure of the girl beside him, he marvelled at the courage and
strength of will, seemingly so out of proportion to the frail
temple that housed them, that had sustained her in the conception
and execution of an adventure that might have taxed the courage and
stamina of a warrior.</p>

<p>"You are a brave girl, Fou-tan," he said.</p>

<p>"The daughter of my father could not be less," she replied
simply.</p>

<p>"You are a daughter of whom any father might be proud," said
King, "but if we are to save you for him we had better be thinking
about getting to the dwelling of Che and Kangrey before night
falls."</p>

<p>"Who are these people?" asked Fou-tan. "Perhaps they will return
me to Lodidhapura for the reward that Lodivarman will pay."</p>

<p>"You need have no fear on that score," replied King. "They are
honest people, runaway slaves from Lodidhapura. They have been kind
to me, and they will be kind to you."</p>

<p>"And if they are not, you will protect me," said Fou-tan with a
tone of finality that evidenced the confidence which she already
felt in the dependability and integrity of her newfound friend.</p>

<p>As they set out in the direction of Che's dwelling, it became
apparent to King immediately that Fou-tan was tired almost to the
point of exhaustion. Will-power and nerve had sustained her so far;
but now, with the discovery of someone to whom she might transfer
the responsibility of her safety, the reaction had come; and he
often found it necessary to assist and support her over the rough
places of the trail. She was small and light, and where the going
was exceptionally bad he lifted her in his arms and carried her as
he might have a child.</p>

<p>"You are strong, Gordon King," she said once as he carried her
thus. Her soft arms were around his neck, her lips were very close
to his.</p>

<p>"I must need be strong," he said. But if she sensed his meaning
she gave no evidence of it. Her eyes closed wearily and her little
head dropped to his shoulder. He carried her thus for a long way,
though the trail beneath his feet was smooth and hard.</p>

<p>Vama and his warriors had halted in a little glade where there
was water. While two of them hunted in the forest for meat for
their supper, the others lay stretched out upon the ground in that
silence which is induced by hunger and fatigue. Presently Vama sat
up alert. His ears had caught the sound of the approach of
something through the jungle.</p>

<p>"Kau and Tchek are returning from the hunt," whispered one of
the warriors who lay near him and who, also, had heard the
noise.</p>

<p>"They did not go in that direction," replied Vama in a low tone.
Then signalling his warriors to silence, he ordered them to conceal
themselves from view.</p>

<p>The sound, already close when they had first heard it,
approached steadily; and they did not have long to wait ere a
warrior, naked but for a sampot, stepped into view, and in his arms
was the runaway apsara whom they sought. Elated, Vama leaped from
his place of concealment, calling to his men to follow him.</p>

<p>At sight of them King turned to escape, but he knew that he
could make no speed while burdened with the girl. She, however, had
seen the soldiers and slipped quickly from his arms. "We are lost!"
she cried.</p>

<p>"Run!" cried King as he snatched a handful of arrows from his
quiver and fitted one to his bow. "Stand back!" he cried to the
warriors. But they only moved steadily forward. His bow-string
twanged, and one of Lodivarman's brass-bound warriors sank to
earth, an arrow through his throat. The others hesitated. They did
not dare to cast their spears or loose their bolts for fear of
injuring the girl.</p>

<p>Slowly King, with Fou-tan behind him, backed away into the
jungle from which he had appeared. At the last instant he sped
another arrow, which rattled harmlessly from the cuirass of Vama.
Then, knowing that he could not fire upon them from the foliage,
the soldiers rushed forward, while King continued to fall back
slowly with Fou-tan, another arrow fitted to his bow.</p>

<p>Kau and Tchek had made a great circle in their hunting. With
their arrows they had brought down three monkeys, and now they were
returning to camp. They had almost arrived when they heard voices
and the twang of a bow-string, and then they saw, directly ahead of
them, a man and a girl crashing through the foliage of the jungle
toward them. Instantly, by her dishevelled costume, they recognized
the apsara and guessed from the attitude of the two that they were
backing away from Vama and his fellows.</p>

<p>Kau was a powerful, a courageous, and a resourceful man.
Instantly he grasped the situation and instantly he acted. Leaping
forward, he threw both his sinewy arms around Gordon King, pinning
the other's arms to his body; while Tchek, following the example of
his companion, seized Fou-tan. Almost immediately Vama and the
others were upon the scene. An instant later Gordon King was
disarmed, and his wrists were bound behind him; then the soldiers
of Lodivarman dragged the captives back to their camping place.</p>

<p>Vama was tremendously elated. Now he would not have to make up
any lies to appease the wrath of his king but could return to
Lodidhapura in triumph, bearing not only the apsara for whom he
had been dispatched, but another prisoner as well.</p>

<p>King thought that they might make quick work of him in revenge
for the soldier he had killed, but they did not appear to hold that
against him at all. They questioned him at some length while they
cooked their supper of monkey meat over a number of tiny fires; but
as what he told them of another country far beyond their jungle was
quite beyond their grasp, they naturally believed that he lied and
insisted that he came from Pnom Dhek and that he was a runaway
slave.</p>

<p>They were all quite content with the happy outcome of their
assignment; and so, looking forward to their return to Lodidhapura
on the morrow, they were inclined to be generous in their treatment
of their prisoners, giving them meat to eat and water to drink.
Their attitude toward Fou-tan was one of respectful awe. They knew
that she was destined to become one of the King's favorites, and it
might prove ill for them, indeed, should they offer her any hurt or
affront. Since their treatment of Gordon King, however, was not
dictated by any such consideration, it was fortunate, indeed, for
him that they were in a good humor.</p>

<p>Regardless, however, of the respectful attention shown her,
Fou-tan was immersed in melancholy. A few moments before, she had
foreseen escape and counted return to her native city almost an
accomplished fact; now, once again, she was in the clutches of the
soldiers of Lodivarman, while simultaneously she had brought
disaster and, doubtless, death to the man who had befriended
her.</p>

<p>"Oh, Gordon King," she said, "my heart is unstrung; my soul is
filled with terror and consumed by horror, for not only must I
return to the hideous fate from which I had escaped, but you must
go to Lodidhapura to slavery or to death."</p>

<p>"We are not in Lodidhapura yet," whispered King. "Perhaps we
shall escape."</p>

<p>The girl shook her head. "There is no hope," she said. "I shall
go to the arms of Lodivarman, and you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And I?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Slaves fight with other slaves and with wild beasts for the
entertainment of Lodivarman and his court," she replied.</p>

<p>"We must escape then," said King. "Perhaps we shall die in the
attempt, but in any event death awaits me and worse than death
awaits you."</p>

<p>"What you command I shall do, Gordon King," replied Fou-tan.</p>

<p>But it did not appear that there was to be much opportunity for
escape that night. After King had eaten they bound his wrists
behind his back again and also bound his ankles together securely,
while two warriors remained constantly with the girl; the others,
their simple meal completed, stripped the armour and weapons from
their fallen comrade and laid him upon a thick bed of dry wood that
they had gathered. Upon him, then, they piled a great quantity of
limbs and branches, of twigs and dry grasses; and when night fell
they lighted their weird funeral pyre, which was to answer its
other dual purpose as a beast fire to protect them from the
prowling carnivores. To King it was a gruesome sight, but neither
Fou-tan nor the other Khmers seemed to be affected by it. The men
gathered much wood and placed it near at hand that the fire might
be kept burning during the night.</p>

<p>The flames leaped high, lighting the boles of the trees about
them and the foliage arching above. The shadows rose and fell and
twisted and writhed. Beyond the limits of the firelight was utter
darkness, silence, mystery. King felt himself in an inverted
cauldron of flame in which a human body was being consumed.</p>

<p>The warriors lay about, laughing and talking. Their
reminiscences were brutal and cruel. Their jokes and stories were
broad and obscene. But there was an undercurrent of rough kindness
and loyalty to one another that they appeared to be endeavoring to
conceal as though they were ashamed of such soft emotion. They were
soldiers. Transplanted to the camps of modern Europe, given a
modern uniform and a modern language, their campfire conversation
would have been the same. Soldiers do not change. One played upon a
little musical instrument that resembled a Jew's harp. Two were
gambling with what appeared to be very similar to modern dice, and
all that they said was so interlarded with strange and terrible
oaths that the American could scarcely follow the thread of their
thought. Soldiers do not change.</p>

<p>Vama came presently and squatted down near King and Fou-tan. "Do
all the men in this far country of which you tell me go naked?" he
demanded.</p>

<p>"No," replied the American. "When I had become lost in the
jungle I was stricken with fever, and while I was sick the monkeys
came and stole my clothing and my weapons."</p>

<p>"You live alone in the jungle?" asked Vama.</p>

<p>King thought quickly; he thought of Che and Kangrey and their
fear of the soldiers in brass. "Yes," he said.</p>

<p>"Are you not afraid of My Lord the Tiger?" inquired Vama.</p>

<p>"I am watchful and I avoid him," replied the American.</p>

<p>"You do well to do so," said Vama, "for even with spear and
arrows no lone man is a match for the great beast."</p>

<p>"But Gordon King is," said Fou-tan proudly.</p>

<p>Vama smiled. "The apsara has been in the jungle but a night and
a day," he reminded her. "How can she know so much about this man
unless, as I suspect, he is, indeed, from Pnom Dhek?"</p>

<p>"He is not from Pnom Dhek," retorted Fou-tan. "And I know that
he is a match for My Lord the Tiger because this day I saw him slay
the beast with a single spear-cast."</p>

<p>Vama looked questioningly at King.</p>

<p>"It was only a matter of good fortune," said King.</p>

<p>"But you did it nevertheless," insisted Fou-tan.</p>

<p>"You killed a tiger with a single cast of your spear?" demanded
Vama.</p>

<p>"As the beast charged him," said Fou-tan.</p>

<p>"That is, indeed, a marvelous feat," said Vama, with a soldier's
ungrudging admiration for the bravery or prowess of another.
"Lodivarman shall hear of this. A hunter of such spirit shall not
go unrecognized in Lodidhapura. I can also bear witness that you
are no mean bowman," added Vama, nodding toward the blazing funeral
pyre. Then he arose and walked to the spot where King's weapons had
been deposited. Picking up the spear he examined it closely. "By
Siva!" he ejaculated. "The blood is scarcely dry upon it. Such a
cast! You drove it a full two feet into the carcass of My Lord the
Tiger."</p>

<p>"Straight through the heart," said Fou-tan.</p>

<p>The other soldiers had been listening to the conversation. It
was noticeable immediately that their attitude toward King changed
instantly, and thereafter they treated him with friendliness tinged
by respect. However, they did not abate their watchfulness over
him, but rather were increasingly careful to see that he was given
no opportunity to escape, nor to have his hands free for any length
of time.</p>

<p>Early the next morning, after a meager breakfast, Vama set out
with his detachment and his prisoners in the direction of
Lodidhapura, leaving the funeral fire still blazing as it eagerly
licked at a new supply of fuel.</p>

<p>The route they selected to Lodidhapura passed, by chance, close
to the spot where King had slain the tiger; and here, in the
partially devoured carcass of the great beast, the soldiers of
Lodivarman found concrete substantiation of Fou-tan's story.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch6" id="ch6">VI. &mdash; THE LEPER KING</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">It was late in the afternoon when the party
emerged suddenly from the jungle at the edge of a great clearing.
King voiced an involuntary exclamation of astonishment as he saw at
a distance the walls and towers of a splendid city.</p>

<p>"Lodidhapura," said Fou-tan; "accursed city!" There was fear in
her voice, and she trembled as she pressed closer to the
American.</p>

<p>While King had long since become convinced that Lodidhapura had
an actual existence of greater reality than legend or fever-wrought
hallucination, yet he had been in no way prepared for the reality.
A collection of nippa-thatched huts had comprised the extent of his
mental picture of Lodidhapura, and now, as the reality burst
suddenly upon him, he was dumbfounded.</p>

<p>Temples and palaces of stone reared their solid masses against
the sky. Mighty towers, elaborately carved, rose in stately
grandeur high over all. There were nippa-thatched huts as well, but
these clustered close against the city's walls and were so
overshadowed by the majestic mass of masonry beyond them that they
affected the picture as slightly as might the bushes growing at its
foot determine the grandeur of a mountain.</p>

<p>In the foreground were level fields in which labored men and
women, naked mostly, but for sampots&mdash;the nippa-thatched huts
were their dwellings. They were the laborers, the descendants of
slaves&mdash;Chams and Annamese&mdash;that the ancient, warlike
Khmers had brought back from many a victory in the days when their
power and their civilization were the greatest upon earth.</p>

<p>From the edge of the jungle, at the point where the party had
emerged, a broad avenue led toward one of the gates of the city,
toward which Vama was conducting them. To his right, at a distance,
King could see what appeared to be another avenue leading to
another gate&mdash;an avenue which seemed to be more heavily
travelled than that upon which they had entered. There were many
people on foot, some approaching the city, others leaving it. At a
distance they looked small, but he could distinguish them and also
what appeared to be bullock carts moving slowly among the
pedestrians.</p>

<p>Presently, at the far end of this distant avenue, he saw the
great bulks of elephants; in a long column they entered the highway
from the jungle and approached the city. They seemed to move in an
endless procession, two abreast, hundreds of them, he thought.
Never before had King seen so many elephants.</p>

<p>"Look!" he cried to Fou-tan. "There must be a circus coming to
town."</p>

<p>"The King's elephants," explained Fou-tan, unimpressed.</p>

<p>"Why does he have so many?" asked King.</p>

<p>"A king without elephants would be no king," replied the girl.
"They proclaim to all men the king's wealth and power. When he
makes war, his soldiers go into battle upon them and fight from
their backs, for those are the war elephants of Lodivarman."</p>

<p>"There must be hundreds of them," commented the American.</p>

<p>"There are thousands," said Fou-tan.</p>

<p>"And against whom does Lodivarman make war?"</p>

<p>"Against Pnom Dhek."</p>

<p>"Only against Pnom Dhek?" inquired King.</p>

<p>"Yes, only against Pnom Dhek."</p>

<p>"Why does he not make war elsewhere? Has he no other
enemies?"</p>

<p>"Against whom else might he make war?" demanded Fou-tan. "There
are only Pnom Dhek and Lodidhapura in all the world."</p>

<p>"Well, that does rather restrict him now, doesn't it?" admitted
King.</p>

<p>For a moment they were silent. Then the girl spoke. "Gordon
King," she said in that soft, caressing voice that the man found so
agreeable, that often he had sought for means to lure her into
conversation. "Gordon King, soon we shall see one another no
more."</p>

<p>The American frowned. He did not like to think of that. He had
tried to put it out of his mind and to imagine that by some chance
they would be allowed to be together after they reached
Lodidhapura, for he had found Fou-tan a cheery and pleasant
companion even when her hour was darkest. Why, she was the only
friend he had! Certainly they would not deny him the right to see
her. From what he had gleaned during his conversation with Vama and
the other warriors, King had become hopeful that Lodivarman would
not treat him entirely as a prisoner or an enemy, but might give
him the opportunity to serve the King as a soldier. Fou-tan had
rather encouraged this hope too, for she knew that it was not at
all improbable of realization.</p>

<p>"Why do you say that?" demanded King. "Why shall we not see one
another again?"</p>

<p>"Would you be sad, Gordon King, if you did not see Fou-tan any
more?" she asked.</p>

<p>The man hesitated before he replied, as though weighing in his
mind a problem that he had never before been called upon to
consider; and as he hesitated a strange, hurt look came into the
eyes of the girl.</p>

<p>"It is unthinkable, Fou-tan," he said at last, and the great
brown eyes of the little apsara softened and tears rose in them.
"We have been such good friends," he added.</p>

<p>"Yes," she said. "We have known each other but a very short
time, and yet we seem such good friends that it is almost as though
we had known each other always."</p>

<p>"But why should we not see one another again?" he demanded once
more.</p>

<p>"Lodivarman may punish me for running away, and there is only
one punishment that would satisfy his pride in such an event and
that is death; but if he forgives me, as he doubtless will, because
of my youth and my great beauty and his desire for me, then I shall
be taken into the King's palace and no more then might you see me
than if I were dead. So you see, either way, the result is the
same."</p>

<p>"I shall see you again, Fou-tan," said the man.</p>

<p>She shook her head. "I like to hear you say it, even though I
know that it cannot be."</p>

<p>"You shall see, Fou-tan. If we both live I shall find a way to
see you; and, too, I shall find a way to take you out of the palace
of the King and back to Pnom Dhek."</p>

<p>She looked up at him with earnest eyes, full of confidence and
admiration. "When I hear you say it," she said, "the impossible
seems almost possible."</p>

<p>"Cling to the hope, Fou-tan," he told her; "and when we are
separated, know always that my every thought will be centered upon
the means to reach you and take you away."</p>

<p>"That will help me to cling to life until the last horrible
minute, beyond which there can be no hope and beyond which I will
not go."</p>

<p>"What do you mean, Fou-tan?" There had been that in her voice
which frightened him.</p>

<p>"I can live in the palace of the King with hope until again the
King sends for me, and then&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And then?"</p>

<p>"And then&mdash;death."</p>

<p>"No, Fou-tan, you must not say that. You must not think it."</p>

<p>"What else could there be&mdash;after?" she demanded. "He is a
leper!" The utter horror in her voice and expression, as her lips
formed the word, aroused to its fullest the protective instinct of
the man. He wanted to throw an arm about her, to soothe and
reassure her; but his wrists were bound together behind him, and he
could only move on dumbly at her side toward the great, carved gate
of Lodidhapura.</p>

<p>The sentry at the gate halted Vama and his party, though his
greeting, following his formal challenge, indicated that he was
well aware of the identity of all but King, a fact which impressed
the American as indicative of the excellent military discipline
that obtained in this remote domain of the leper king.</p>

<p>Summoned by the sentry, the captain of the gate came from his
quarters within the massive towers that flanked the gateway to
Lodidhapura. He was a young man, resplendent in trappings of gold
and blue and yellow. His burnished cuirass and his helmet were of
the precious metal, but his weapons were stern and lethal.</p>

<p>"Who comes?" he demanded.</p>

<p>"Vama of the King's guard, with the apsara from Pnom Dhek, who
ran away into the jungle, and a warrior from a far country whom we
took prisoner," replied the leader of the detachment.</p>

<p>"You have done well, Vama," said the officer, as his eyes
quickly appraised the two captives. "Enter and go at once to the
palace of the King, for such were his orders in the event that you
returned successful from your quest."</p>

<p>The streets of Lodidhapura, beyond the gate, were filled with
citizens and slaves. Tiny shops with wide awnings lined the street
through which Vama's captives were conducted. Merchants in long
robes and ornate headdresses presided over booths where were
displayed a bewildering variety of merchandise, including pottery,
silver and gold ornaments, rugs, stuffs, incense, weapons, and
armour.</p>

<p>Men and women of high rank, beneath gorgeous parasols borne by
almost naked slaves, bartered at the booths for the wares
displayed; high-hatted priests moved slowly through the throng,
while burly soldiers elbowed their way roughly along the avenue.
Many turned to note the escort and its prisoners, and the sight of
Fou-tan elicited a wealth of ejaculation and many queries; but to
all such Vama, fully aware of his importance, turned a deaf
ear.</p>

<p>As they approached the center of Lodidhapura, King was amazed by
the evident wealth of the city, by the goods displayed in the
innumerable shops, and by the grandeur of the architecture. The
ornate carvings that covered the facades of the great buildings,
the splendor of the buildings themselves, filled him with awe; and
when at last the party halted before the palace of Lodivarman, the
American was staggered by the magnificence which confronted
him.</p>

<p>They had been conducted through a great park that lay below, and
to the east of the stately temple of Siva, which dominated the
entire city of Lodidhapura. Great trees and gorgeous shrubbery
shadowed winding avenues that were flanked by statues and columns
of magnificent, though sometimes barbaric, design; and then the
palace of the King had burst suddenly upon his astonished
gaze&mdash;a splendid building embellished from foundation to
loftiest tower with tile of the most brilliant coloring and
fanciful design.</p>

<p>Before the entrance to the palace of Lodivarman stood a guard of
fifty warriors. No brass-bound soldiers these, resplendent in
shining cuirasses of burnished gold, whose haughty demeanor bespoke
their exalted position and the high responsibility that devolved
upon them.</p>

<p>Gordon King had difficulty in convincing himself of the reality
of the scene. Again and again his sane Yankee head assured him that
no such things might exist in the jungles of Cambodia and that he
still was the victim of the hallucinations of high fever; but when
the officer at the gate had interrogated Vama and presently
commands were received to conduct the entire party to the presence
of Lodivarman, and still the hallucination persisted in all its
conclusiveness, he resigned himself to the actualities that
confronted him and would have accepted as real whatever grotesque
or impossible occurrences or figures that might have impinged themselves
upon his perceptive faculties.</p>

<p>Escorted by a detachment of the golden warriors of Lodivarman,
the entire company was conducted through long corridors toward the
center of the palace and at last, after a wait before massive
doors, was ushered into a great hall, at the far end of which a
number of people were seated upon a raised dais. Upon the floor of
the chamber were many men in gorgeous raiment&mdash;priests,
courtiers, and soldiers. One of the latter, resplendent in rich
trappings, received them and conducted them toward the far end of
the chamber, where they were halted before the dais.</p>

<p>King saw seated upon a great throne an emaciated man, upon every
exposed portion of whose body were ugly and repulsive sores. To his
right and below him were somber men in rich garb, and to his left a
score of sad-eyed girls and women. This, then, was Lodivarman, the
Leper King of Lodidhapura! The American felt an inward revulsion at
the mere sight of this repulsive creature and simultaneously
understood the horror that Fou-tan had evinced at the thought of
personal contact with the leper into whose clutches fate had
delivered her.</p>

<p>Before Lodivarman knelt a slave, bearing a great salver of food,
into which the King continually dipped with his long-nailed
fingers. He ate almost constantly during the audience, and as King
was brought nearer he saw that the delicacies intended to tempt the
palate of a king were naught but lowly mushrooms.</p>

<p>"Who are these?" demanded Lodivarman, his dead eyes resting
coldly on the prisoners.</p>

<p>"Vama, the commander of ten," replied the officer addressed,
"who has returned from his mission, to the honor of the King, with
the apsara for whom he was dispatched and a strange warrior whom
he took prisoner."</p>

<p>"Fou-tan of Pnom Dhek," demanded Lodivarman, "why did you seek
to escape the honor for which I had destined you?"</p>

<p>"Great King," replied the girl, "my heart is still in the land
of my sire. I would have returned to Pnom Dhek, for I longed for
the father and the friends whom I love and who love me."</p>

<p>"A pardonable desire," commented Lodivarman, "and this time thy
transgression shall be overlooked, but beware a repetition. You are
destined to the high honor of the favor of Lodivarman. See that
hereafter, until death, thou dost merit it."</p>

<p>Fou-tan, trembling, curtsied low; and Lodivarman turned his
cold, fishy eyes upon Gordon King. "And what manner of man bringeth
you before the King now?" he asked.</p>

<p>"A strange warrior from some far country, Glorious King,"
replied Vama.</p>

<p>"A runaway slave from Pnom Dhek more likely," commented
Lodivarman.</p>

<p>"Even as I thought, Resplendent Son of Heaven," answered Vama;
"but his deeds are such as to leave no belief that he be either a
slave or the son of slaves."</p>

<p>"What deeds?" demanded the King.</p>

<p>"He faced my detachment single-handed, and with a lone shaft he
slew one of the best of the King's bowmen."</p>

<p>"Is that all?" asked Lodivarman. "A mere freak of Fate may
account for that."</p>

<p>"No, Brother of the Gods," replied Vama. "There is more."</p>

<p>"And what is it? Hasten, I cannot spend the whole evening in
idle audience over a slave."</p>

<p>"With a single spear-cast he slew My Lord the Tiger," cried
Vama.</p>

<p>"And you saw this?"</p>

<p>"Fou-tan saw it, and all of us saw the carcass of the tiger the
following morning. O King, he drove his spear a full two feet into
the breast of the tiger as the great beast charged. He is a
marvelous warrior, and Vama is proud to have brought such a one to
serve in the ranks of the army of Lodivarman."</p>

<p>For a while Lodivarman was silent, his dead eyes upon King,
while he helped himself from time to time to the tender-cooked
mushrooms with which the slave tempted him.</p>

<p>"With a single cast he slew My Lord the Tiger?" demanded
Lodivarman of Fou-tan.</p>

<p>"It is even so, Great King," replied the girl.</p>

<p>"How came he to do it? Surely no sane man would tempt the great
beast unless in dire predicament."</p>

<p>"He did it to save me, upon whom the tiger was preparing to
spring."</p>

<p>"So I am doubly indebted to this stranger," said Lodivarman.
"And what gift would suit your appetite for reward?" demanded the
King.</p>

<p>"I desire no reward," replied the American, "only that you will
permit Fou-tan to return to her beloved Pnom Dhek."</p>

<p>"You do not ask much!" cried Lodivarman. "I like your ways. You
shall not be destroyed, but instead you shall serve me in the
palace guards; such a spear-man should prove worth his weight in
gold. As for your request, remember that Fou-tan belongs to
Lodivarman, the King, and so may no longer be the subject of any
conversation, upon pain of death. Take him to the quarters of the
guard!" he directed one of his officers, nodding at King, "and see
that he is well cared for, trained and armed."</p>

<p>"Yes, most magnificent of kings," replied the man addressed.</p>

<p>"Take the girl to the quarters of the women and look to it that
she does not again escape," commanded Lodivarman, with a gesture
that dismissed them all.</p>

<p>As he was escorted from the audience chamber through one exit,
King saw Fou-tan led away toward another. Her eyes were turned back
toward him, and in them was a haunting suggestion of grief and
hopelessness that cut him to the heart.</p>

<p>"Good-by, Gordon King!" she called to him.</p>

<p>"Until we meet again, Fou-tan," he replied.</p>

<p>"You will not meet again," said the officer who was escorting
him, as he hustled the American from the chamber.</p>

<p>The barracks to which King was assigned stood a considerable
distance in the rear of the palace, not far from the stables in
which were housed the King's elephants, yet, like the latter,
within the grounds of the royal enclosure. The long, low buildings
that housed the soldiers of Lodivarman's royal guard were plastered
inside and out with mud and thatched with palm fronds. Along either
wall upon the handpicked dirt floors were pallets of straw, where
the common soldiers were bedded down like horses. A space of some
four feet in width by seven in length was allotted to each man, and
into the wall above his pallet pegs had been driven upon which he
might hang his weapons and his clothing, a cooking-pot, and a
vessel for water. Along the centers of the buildings was a clear
space about eight feet wide, forming an aisle in which soldiers
might be formed for inspection. Just beneath the eaves was an open
space running the full length of both walls, giving ample
ventilation but very little light to the interior of the barracks.
The doors were at either end of the buildings.</p>

<p>The building to which King was escorted was about two hundred
feet long and housed a hundred men. It was but one of a number of
similar structures, which he later learned were placed at strategic
positions just inside the wall of the royal enclosure, where five
thousand men-at-arms were constantly maintained.</p>

<p>At Vama's request King was assigned to his unit of ten to
replace the soldier that he had slain in the jungle, and thus the
American took up his life in the unit of ten, with Kau and Tchek
and Vama and the others with whom he was already acquainted as his
companions.</p>

<p>From a naked jungle hunter to a soldier of a Khmer king, he had
crossed in a single step long ages of evolution, and yet he was
still a thousand years from the era into which he had been
born.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch7" id="ch7">VII. &mdash; A SOLDIER OF THE GUARD</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">The lives of private soldiers of the royal guard
of a Khmer king were far from thrilling. Their most important
assignment was to guard duty, which fell to the lot of each soldier
once in every four days. There were drills daily, both upon foot
and upon elephants, and there were numerous parades and
ceremonies.</p>

<p>Aside from the care of their own weapons they were called upon
for no manual labor, such work being attended to by slaves. Once a
week the straw which formed their pallets was hauled away upon
bullock-carts to the elephants' stables, where it was used to bed
down the great pachyderms, and fresh straw was brought to the
barracks.</p>

<p>Their leisure, of which they usually had a little at various
times during the day, the soldiers utilized in gossiping or
gambling, or listening to the story-tellers, certain of whom were
freely admitted to the royal grounds. Many were the stories to
which King listened&mdash;stories of ancient power and stories of
kings who owned a million slaves and a hundred thousand elephants;
stories of Kambu, the mythical founder of the Khmer race; of
Yacovarman, the king of glory; and of Jayavarman VIII, the last of
the great kings. Interwoven throughout all the fabric of these
hoary tales were the Nagas and the Yeacks, those ever-recurring
mythological figures that he had met in the folk-lore of the people
beyond the jungle, in the dark dwelling of Che and Kangrey, and now
in the shadow of the palace of the great King, Lodivarman.</p>

<p>Or when there were no story-tellers, or he tired of listening to
the idle gossip of his fellows, or became bored by their endless
games of chance, King would sit in silence, meditating upon the
past and seeking an answer to the riddle of the future.
Recollection of his distant home and friends always raised a vision
of Susan Anne Prentice&mdash;home and friends and Susan
Anne&mdash;they were all one; they constituted his past and
beckoned him into the future. It seemed difficult to think of life
without home and friends and Susan Anne when he thought of them,
but always the same little figure rose in front of them, clear and
distinct, as they faded slowly out of the picture: sad eyes in
which there yet dwelt a wealth of inherent happiness and mirth, a
piquant face, and gleaming teeth behind red lips. Always his
thoughts, no matter how far they roamed, returned to this dainty
flower of girlhood, and then his brows would contract and his jaws
clench and he speculated upon her fate and chafed and fretted
because of his inability to succor her.</p>

<p>And one day as he sat meditating thus he saw a strange figure
approaching across the barracks yard. "Ye gods!" he exclaimed,
almost audibly; "one by one my dreams are coming true! If it isn't
the old bird with the red umbrella that I saw just before Che and
Kangrey rescued me, I'll eat my shirt."</p>

<p>King had had considerable difficulty in differentiating between
the fantastic figures of his fever-induced hallucinations and the
realities of his weird experiences in the jungle, so that though
Che and Kangrey had insisted that there had been an old man with a
long yellow robe and a red umbrella and although King had believed
them, yet it was with somewhat of a shock that he recognized the
reality. As Vay Thon passed among the soldiers, they arose to their
feet and bowed low before him, evincing the awe and reverence in
which they held him. He passed them with nodding head and mumbled
benediction, gazing intently at each face as though he sought some
particular warrior.</p>

<p>Seeing that the others rose and bowed before the high priest,
King did likewise; and when Vay Thon's eyes fell upon him they
lighted with recognition. "It is you, my son," he said. "Do you
recall me?"</p>

<p>"You are Vay Thon, the high priest of Siva," replied the
American.</p>

<p>"He whom you saved from My Lord the Tiger," replied the
priest.</p>

<p>"An obligation which you fully discharged when you commanded Che
and Kangrey to nurse me back to life."</p>

<p>"An obligation that I may never fully discharge," replied Vay
Thon; "and because of this I came to search for you, that I may
offer you proof of my undying gratitude."</p>

<p>"How did you know that I was here?" asked King.</p>

<p>"I have talked with Fou-tan," replied Vay Thon, "and when she
had described the warrior who had rescued her, I knew at once that
it must be you."</p>

<p>"You have seen Fou-tan and talked with her?" asked King.</p>

<p>The high priest nodded.</p>

<p>"And she is well&mdash;and safe?" demanded King.</p>

<p>"Her body is well, but her heart is sick," replied the high
priest; "but she is safe&mdash;those who find favor in the eyes of
the King are always safe, while the King's favor lasts."</p>

<p>"Has she&mdash;has he&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I understand what you would ask, my son," said Vay Thon.
"Lodivarman has not yet sent for her."</p>

<p>"But he will," cried King.</p>

<p>"Tonight, I think," said Vay Thon.</p>

<p>The anguish in the young man's eyes would have been apparent to
one of far less intelligence and discernment than Vay Thon. He laid
his hand in compassion upon the shoulder of the American. "If I
could help you, my son, I would," he said; "but in such matters
kings may not be crossed even by gods."</p>

<p>"Where is she?" asked King.</p>

<p>"She is in the King's house," replied Vay Thon, pointing toward
a wing of the palace that was visible from where they stood.</p>

<p>For a long moment the eyes of the American, lighted by
determination and by a complexity of other fires that burned within
him, remained riveted upon the house of the King.</p>

<p>Vay Thon, the high priest of Siva, was old and wise and shrewd.
"I read your heart, my son," he said, "and my heart goes out in
sympathy to yours, but what you plan is impossible of execution; it
would but lead to torture and to death."</p>

<p>"In what room is she in the house of the King?" demanded the
American.</p>

<p>Vay Thon shook his head sadly. "Forget this madness," he said.
"It can lead but to the grave. I am your friend and I would help
you, but I would be no friend were I to encourage you in the mad
venture that I can only too well guess is forming in your mind. I
owe you my life; and always shall I stand ready to aid you in any
way that lies within my power, except in this. And now, farewell;
and may the gods cause you to forget your sorrow."</p>

<p>As Vay Thon turned and walked slowly back in the direction of
the temple, Gordon King stood gazing at the house of Lodivarman;
forgotten were Vay Thon; forgotten were his wise words of counsel.
King seemed hypnotised; a single figure filled the retina of his
mind's eye&mdash;a tiny figure, yet it crowded out all
else&mdash;through walls of tile and lead he saw it crouching in
despair in the house of the King.</p>

<p>The afternoon was drawing to a close. The warriors who were to
relieve the palace guard at sundown were already buckling on their
brass cuirasses, straightening their leather tunics, adjusting
their helmets, polishing weapons until they glistened even in the
dark interior of the barracks.</p>

<p>Gordon King was recalled to his surroundings by two tardy
warriors who were hastening to accoutre themselves for guard duty;
and in that instant was born the mad scheme that, without the
slightest consideration, he was to attempt to put into
execution.</p>

<p>Turning quickly, he overtook the men just before they entered
the barracks and touched one of them upon the shoulder. "May I have
a word with you?" he asked.</p>

<p>"I have no time. I am already late," replied the warrior.</p>

<p>"I shall be quick, then," replied King. "Let me take your place
on the guard tonight, and I will give you all of my next pay."</p>

<p>Instantly the man was all suspicion. "That is a strange
request," he said. "Most warriors would pay to be relieved of guard
duty. What is your purpose?"</p>

<p>"There is a certain slave girl attached to the house of the
King, and to-night she will be looking for a certain warrior." And
the American nudged the other in the ribs and gave him a sly
wink.</p>

<p>The warrior's face relaxed into a grin. "It might go hard with
us if we were caught," he said; "but, by Siva, three months' pay is
not to be considered lightly. Quick! Get into your harness, while I
explain the matter to the others of the ten. But be sure that you
do not say anything about the pay, for if they knew that, each
would want his share."</p>

<p>"You are doing it for friendship," said King with a laugh, as he
hastened into the interior of the barracks. As he hurriedly
adjusted his cuirass and helmet, the warrior whose place he was to
take was explaining the matter to the other members of the ten, who
received it with rough laughter and broad jokes.</p>

<p>At first the petty officer in command of the ten positively
forbade the exchange, and it was necessary for King to promise him
a month's pay before he, at last, reluctantly acceded. "But
remember," he admonished them, "I know nothing of it, for no such
thing may be done with my knowledge."</p>

<p>As the ten marched toward the house of the King, the American's
excitement increased, though outwardly he was calm. Just what he
was going to do and just how he was going to execute it, the man
could not know, because he had no idea as to what obstacles would
present themselves, or, upon the other hand, what good fortune
might lie in store for him. He fully appreciated that his proposed
action was unwise, ill-considered, and almost definitely doomed to
defeat; but could he have turned back he would not have done
so.</p>

<p>Presently they were halted at the King's house, a little to one
side of the main entrance and before a low doorway. Other
contingents of the guard were arriving from other barracks, while
members of the old guard emerged from the low doorway and were
formed for the brief ceremony that marked the changes of the
guard.</p>

<p>Immediately following the ceremony a number of the new guard
were told off to relieve the sentries upon their posts about the
grounds and within the interior of the palace, and King happened to
be among these. As he was marched away he could not help but wonder
what post Fate would select for him, though wherever it should be
he was determined that he would find the means for gaining access
to the interior of the palace.</p>

<p>The detail of the guard was first marched to the far end of the
wing, and here a sentry was relieved who paced back and forth in
front of a tiny doorway, shadowed by trees and shrubbery. King
thought that this would have been an excellent post; but it did not
fall to him; and as they continued on about the wing of the palace,
relieving sentry after sentry, he began to fear that he was not
going to be posted at all; and, indeed, the detail traversed the
outside of the entire wing, and still the American had been
assigned no post. And then they came at last before the ornate
entrance to the King's house, where ten men were detached from the
detail to relieve those posted at this important spot.</p>

<p>All the sentries hitherto relieved were then marched away, and
King found himself one of five who had not as yet been posted.
These, to the astonishment and gratification of the American, were
marched into the palace. Three were detailed to posts in the long
entrance corridor, while King and the other remaining warrior were
marched to the doorway of a large and luxuriously furnished
apartment. At one end of the chamber, raised slightly above the
floor level, was a dais covered with gorgeous rugs. Upon it stood a
low table laid with a service of solid gold, with bowls of fruit
and sweetmeats, several massive golden jugs, and ornately carved
goblets. Behind the table was a pile of pillows covered with rich
stuff, and over all a canopy of cloth of gold. On the floor of the
chamber, below the dais, was a long table, similarly though not so
richly laid; and this was entirely surrounded by rich cushions.</p>

<p>On either side of the doorway, facing the interior of the room,
stood King and his fellow warrior, two bronze statues cuirassed in
burnished brass. For five minutes they stood there thus facing the
empty chamber; and then a door at the far side opened, and a file
of slaves entered, some twenty-five or thirty in all. Two of these
took their places at opposite ends of the dais back of the table
and the pillows, standing erect with arms folded and eyes staring
straight to the front. The other slaves took similar positions at
intervals behind the long table on the main floor and faced the
dais. Between the long table and the dais and facing the latter
stood a richly garbed individual whom King mentally classified as a
sort of major-domo.</p>

<p>Again there was a wait of several minutes, during which no one
spoke or moved. Then, through the doorway which King and his fellow
guarded, a party of men entered the chamber. Some were warriors,
cuirassed and helmeted in gold, while others were garbed in long
robes of vivid hues, richly embroidered. A number of these wore
fantastic headdresses, several of which were over two feet in
height.</p>

<p>These banquet guests formed in little groups behind the long
table, engaged in low-toned conversation. There was no laughter now
and they spoke scarcely above a whisper. It was as though a pall of
gloom had enveloped them the instant they entered the gorgeously
appointed chamber. Almost immediately an arras at the rear of the
dais was drawn aside, revealing a warrior of the guard, who sounded
a fanfare upon a golden trumpet. As the last note died away, the
slaves in the chamber prostrated themselves, pressing their
foreheads to the floor, while the guests kneeled with bowed heads;
and then Lodivarman, the Leper King of Lodidhapura, came slowly
through the opening at the rear of the dais. Only the trumpeter and
the two guards at the door remained standing as Lodivarman advanced
and seated himself upon the pillows behind his table. For a moment
he looked about the apartment through his dull eyes, and then,
apparently satisfied, he struck his palms together a single
time.</p>

<p>Immediately all in the apartment arose to their feet. The
major-domo bowed low three times before the King. Each of the
guests did the same, and then, in silence, took their places at the
banquet table. When all had been seated, Lodivarman struck his
palms together a second time; and immediately the slaves stepped
forward upon noiseless feet and commenced to serve the viands and
pour the wine. A third time Lodivarman gave the signal, upon which
the guests relaxed and entered into low-voiced conversation.</p>

<p>From his post at the entrance-way, Gordon King noticed the
bountiful array of food upon the long banquet table. Only a few of
the articles did he recognize, but it was evident that fruit and
vegetables and meat were there in abundance. The largest bowl upon
the little table of the King was filled with mushrooms, aside from
which there was little else upon Lodivarman's table other than
fruit, sweetmeats, and wine. From what he had previously seen of
Lodivarman and from the gossip that he had heard in the barracks he
was aware that this monarch was so addicted to the use of mushrooms
that the eating of them had become a fixed habit with him almost to
the exclusion of proper and natural food, and his taste for them
was so inordinate that he had long since ordained them royal food,
forbidden under pain of death to all save the King.</p>

<p>As the tiresome meal progressed, the banqueters carried on their
forced and perfunctory conversation, while Lodivarman sat silent
and morose, his attention divided between his mushrooms and his
wine. As King watched he could not but compare this meal with
formal dinners he had attended in New York and Washington, and he
sympathized with the banqueters in the hall of Lodivarman, because
he knew that they were suffering the same boredom that he had once
endured, but with the advantage that they did not have to appear to
be happy and gay.</p>

<p>Presently Lodivarman made a sign to the major-domo, who clapped
his hands twice; and immediately all eyes turned to a doorway at
one side of the chamber, through which there now filed a company of
apsaras. About the hips the girls wore girdles of virgin gold,
which supported skirts that fell to within a few inches of their
ankles. From their hips two stiff-pointed panels of cloth bowed
outward, falling almost to the floor. Above the hips their bodies
were naked, except for rich armlets and necklaces. Their
headdresses were fantastic contrivances that resembled ornate
candelabra, heavy ear-rings fell to their shoulders, and above
their bare feet were anklets of precious metal. A few wore masks of
hideous design, but the painted lips and cheeks and darkened eyes
of most of them were pretty; but there was one among them who was
gorgeous in her loveliness. As the eyes of Gordon King fell upon
her face, he felt his heart quicken, for she was Fou-tan. She had
not seen him when she entered; and now she danced with her back
toward him, a dance that consisted of strange postures of the feet
and legs, the hips, the arms and hands and heads of the little
dancers. As they went through the slow steps of the dance, they
bent their fingers, their hands, and their arms into such unnatural
positions that Gordon King marvelled, not only upon the long hours
and days of practice that must have been necessary for them to
perfect themselves, but also upon the mentality of an audience that
could find entertainment in such a combination of beauty and
grotesqueness. That the dance was ritualistic and had some hidden
religious significance was the only explanation that he could place
upon it, yet even so he realized that it was fully as artistic and
beautiful and intelligent as much of the so-called aesthetic
dancing that he had been compelled to endure in modern America and
Europe.</p>

<p>There were twenty apsaras taking part in the dance, but King
saw only one&mdash;a lithe and beautiful figure that moved
faultlessly through the long sequences of intricate and difficult
posturing. Mad scheme after mad scheme passed through his mind as
he sought for some plan whereby he might take advantage of their
proximity to effect her release from the palace of the King, but
each one must needs be discarded in the light of sober reflection.
He must wait, but while he waited he planned and hoped.</p>

<p>As the long dance drew to a close, Gordon King saw Lodivarman
beckon the major-domo to him and whisper briefly to that
functionary; and as the apsaras were withdrawing from the room,
the man hastened after them and touched Fou-tan upon the shoulder.
He spoke to her, and King could see the girl shrink. Lodivarman
clapped his hands three times, and again the slaves prostrated
themselves and the guests kneeled; while Lodivarman rose to his
feet and walked slowly from the chamber through the same doorway by
which he had entered. Immediately after he was gone the guests
arose and left the chamber, apparently only too glad to be released
from the ordeal of a state banquet. The slaves began to gather up
the dishes and bear them away, while the major-domo led Fou-tan
across the chamber, up on to the royal dais and bowed her into the
doorway through which Lodivarman had disappeared.</p>

<p>Gordon King could scarce restrain himself as the full import of
what he had just witnessed revealed itself to his tortured mind.
Inclination prompted him to run across the chamber and follow
Lodivarman and Fou-tan through that doorway of mystery, but again
sane judgment interposed.</p>

<p>With the passing of the King and the guests, the American's
fellow guardsman had relaxed. He no longer stood in statuesque
immobility, but lounged carelessly against the wall watching the
slaves bearing away the trays of unfinished food. "We should enjoy
that more than the guests seemed to," he said to King, nodding
toward the viands.</p>

<p>"Yes," replied the American, his mind upon other matters.</p>

<p>"I have stood guard here many times in the past," continued the
warrior, "and never have I gone hungry after a banquet."</p>

<p>"I am not hungry now," said King shortly.</p>

<p>"I am," said the warrior. "Just beyond that door they stack up
the dishes. If you will watch here, I can go in there and eat all
that I want."</p>

<p>"Go ahead," said the American.</p>

<p>"If you see an officer approaching, whistle once."</p>

<p>"If I see one I shall whistle. Go ahead," said King, seeing here
a God-given opportunity to carry out the plan that the presence of
the other warrior would have thwarted.</p>

<p>"It will not take me long," said the warrior, and with that he
hurried quickly toward the little door through which the slaves
were carrying the food.</p>

<p>Scarcely had the door closed behind his companion when King
crossed the apartment and leaped to the dais. At the moment the
chamber was empty, not even a single slave remaining within it, and
there was no witness as the American parted the hangings and
disappeared through the doorway that shortly before had swallowed
Lodivarman and Fou-tan.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch8" id="ch8">VIII. &mdash; IN THE HOUSE OF THE
KING</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">The major-domo led Fou-tan through a dimly lighted
corridor to a small apartment not far from the banquet hall. The
interior walls of thin sheet lead, hand-pounded upon great blocks
of stone, were covered with paintings depicting scenes of war, the
chase, the palace, and the temple. There were spearmen and bowmen
and great elephants trapped for war. A king upon horseback,
followed by his courtiers, rode down a tiger and slew him with a
spear. Countless apsaras posed in wooden postures of the dance.
Priests in long robes and fantastic headdresses marched in
interminable procession toward a temple to Siva, and everywhere
throughout the decorations of the chamber was the symbol of the
Destroyer. Upon the floor were costly rugs and the skins of tigers
and leopards. There were low tables with vessels containing fruit
or sweets and statuary of pottery and stone. At one side of the
chamber, depending from the ceiling by three chains, swung an
elaborately carved vessel from which arose the smoke and the heavy
fragrance of burning incense, while upon the floor was an abundance
of cushions covered by rich embroidery of many hues. The whole
apartment was a blaze of color, softened and subdued in the light
of three cressets burning steadily in the quiet air.</p>

<p>"Why have you brought me here?" demanded Fou-tan.</p>

<p>"It is the will of Lodivarman, the King," replied the
major-domo.</p>

<p>"I should be allowed three days to prepare myself," said the
girl. "It is the custom."</p>

<p>The major-domo shook his head. "I know nothing beyond the orders
I received from Lodivarman," he said. "Customs are made by
kings&mdash;and unmade."</p>

<p>Fou-tan looked apprehensively about her, taking in the details
of the apartment. She saw that in addition to the door through
which they had entered there was another door at one end of the
room and that along one side there were three windows, entirely
covered now by the hangings that had been drawn across them. She
moved uneasily about while the major-domo remained standing, always
facing her. "Will you not be seated?" he asked.</p>

<p>"I prefer to stand," she replied, and then, "What are your
orders?"</p>

<p>"To bring you here," replied the major-domo.</p>

<p>"And that was all?"</p>

<p>"That was all."</p>

<p>"Why was I brought here?" persisted the girl.</p>

<p>"Because the King ordered it," replied the man.</p>

<p>"Why did he order it?"</p>

<p>"It is not for me to know or to seek to know more than the King
divulges. I am but a servant." For a time the silence of the room
was broken only by their breathing and the soft movements of the
girl's skirt as she paced nervously the length of the gorgeous
apartment that, had its walls been of cold granite, could have
meant no more a prison to her.</p>

<p>Her thoughts were confused by the hopelessness of her situation.
She had had no time to prepare for this, not in the sense of the
preparation that was customary for a new bride for Lodivarman, but
in a sterner, a more personal sense. She had sworn to herself that
she would die before she would submit to the loathsome embraces of
the Leper King; but taken thus unaware she had no means for death,
so that now she concentrated every faculty of her ingenuity to
discover some plan whereby she might postpone the fatal hour or
find the means to liberate herself at once from the hateful crisis
which she felt impended.</p>

<p>And then the door at the end of the room opened and Lodivarman
entered. He halted just within the threshold, closing the door
behind him, and stood thus for a moment in silence, his dead eyes
upon her where, reacting unconsciously to a lifetime of training,
she had gone on her knees before the King, as had the
major-domo.</p>

<p>"Arise!" commanded Lodivarman, including them both in a gesture,
and then he turned to the man. "You may go," he said. "See that no
one enters this wing of the palace until I summon."</p>

<p>The major-domo, bowing low, backed from the room, closing the
door softly as he departed. Then it was that Lodivarman advanced
toward Fou-tan. He laid a hand upon her naked shoulder as she
shrank back involuntarily.</p>

<p>"You fear me," he said. "To you I am a loathsome leper. They all
fear me; they all hate me, but what can they do? What can you do? I
am King. May the gods help the poor leper who is not a king!"</p>

<p>"Oh, King, I am not a king," cried the girl. "You call upon the
gods to help the poor leper who is not a king, and yet you would
make a leper of me, you who could save me!"</p>

<p>Lodivarman laughed. "Why should I spare you?" he demanded. "It
was a woman who made me a leper. Let her sin be upon all women. The
accursed creature! From that moment I have hated women; even while
I have held them in my arms I have hated them, but some malignant
demon has thwarted me. Never has a woman contracted leprosy from
me; yet I always hope, and the more beautiful and young they are
the higher rises my hope, for once I was young and beautiful until
that accursed woman robbed me of happiness and took away from me
all except the life I had grown to hate; but perhaps in you my
revenge shall be consummated as I have always hoped. With you it
seems that it must be fulfilled, for you are very young and by far
the most beautiful woman that has been offered in atonement for the
sin of her sister. I shall tell you the story; I tell it to each of
them that they may know how well they deserve whatever fate the
gods may hold in store for them, because, like the accursed one,
they are women.</p>

<p>"It was many years ago. I was in the prime of my youth and my
beauty. I had ridden out to hunt My Lord the Tiger with a hundred
courtiers and a thousand men-at-arms. The hunt was a success. Upon
that wall beside you the artist has painted Lodivarman slaying the
great beast. Never shall I forget the day of our triumphal return,
of Lodidhapura. Ah, Siva, no, never shall I forget. It was a day of
triumph, a day of discovery, and the day of my cruel undoing by the
foul creature whose sin you are to expiate.</p>

<p>"It was upon that day that I first tasted a mushroom. At a
little village in the jungle a native upon bended knee offered me a
platter of this then strange food. I partook. Never in my life had
I tasted a viand more delicious. Dismounting, I sat beneath a tree
before the hut of the poor peasant, and there I ate all of the
mushrooms that he had prepared&mdash;a great platter of
them&mdash;but I did not seem able to satisfy my craving for them,
nor have I since then. I questioned him as to what they were and
how they grew, and I gave orders that he be brought to Lodidhapura
and given the means to propagate the royal food. He still lives. He
has been showered with honors and riches, and still he raises
mushrooms for Lodivarman; nor may any other in the realm raise
them, nor any but the King partake of them. And thus there occurred
a great happiness and a great satisfaction upon the selfsame day
that saw all else snatched from me.</p>

<p>"As we entered Lodidhapura later in the day, crowds lined the
avenue to see their King. They sang and shouted in welcome and
threw blossoms at us. My charger, frightened by the noise and the
bombardment of blossoms, became unmanageable, and I was hurled
heavily to the ground; whereat a woman of the crowd rushed forward
and threw herself upon me and with her arms about me covered my
face and mouth with kisses. When my courtiers reached my side and
dragged her from me and lifted me to my feet, it was seen that the
woman was a leper. A great cry of horror arose, and the people who
had come to applaud me shrank away, and even my courtiers drew to
one side; and alone I mounted my horse and alone I rode into the
city of Lodidhapura.</p>

<p>"Within an hour I was stricken; these hideous sores came upon my
body as by magic, and never since have I been free from them. Now
you shall have them, woman&mdash;daughter of a woman. As I have
rotted, so shall you rot; as I am loathed, so shall you be loathed;
as my youth and beauty were blasted, so shall yours be. Come!" and
he laid a heavy hand upon the arm of Fou-tan.</p>

<p>Gordon King, entering the dimly lighted corridor, paused a
moment to listen, to note if he might not hear voices that would
guide him to those he sought. As he stood there thus, he saw a door
open farther along the corridor and a man back out whom he
instantly recognized as the major-domo. King looked for a place to
hide, but there was no hiding-place; the corridor was straight and
none too wide, and it was inevitable that he would be discovered if
the major-domo came that way, as he did immediately after he had
closed the door of the apartment he had just quitted.</p>

<p>King grasped at the only chance that occurred to him for
disarming the suspicions of the major-domo. Snapping to rigid
attention, he stood as though a posted sentry just inside the
entrance to the corridor. The major-domo saw him, and a puzzled
frown crossed the man's face as he approached along the corridor,
halting when he came opposite King.</p>

<p>"What do you here, man?" he demanded suspiciously.</p>

<p>"By the command of Lodivarman, the King, I have been posted here
with orders to let no one enter."</p>

<p>The major-domo seemed puzzled and rather at a loss as to what
action he should take in the matter. He thought of returning to
Lodivarman for verification of the warrior's statement, but he knew
the short temper of his King and hesitated to incur his wrath in
the event that the warrior had spoken the truth. "The King said
naught to me of this," he said. "He commanded me to see that no one
entered this wing of the palace."</p>

<p>"That is what I am here for," replied King; "and, furthermore, I
must tell you that nothing was said to me about you and, therefore,
I must order you to leave at once."</p>

<p>"But I am the major-domo," said the man haughtily.</p>

<p>"But I am the King's sentry," replied the American, "and if you
wish to question the King's orders, let us go to Lodivarman
together and see what he has to say about it."</p>

<p>"Perhaps he forgot that he had ordered a sentry posted here,"
temporized the major-domo. "But how else could you have been posted
here other than by orders from an officer of the King?"</p>

<p>"How else indeed?" inquired the American.</p>

<p>"Very well," snapped the major-domo. "See that you let no one
enter," and he was about to pass on when King detained him.</p>

<p>"I have never been posted here before," he said; "perhaps you
had better tell me if there is any other doorway in the corridor
through which anyone might enter this section of the palace, that I
may watch that also; and also if there is anyone here beside the
King."</p>

<p>"Only the King and an apsara are here," replied the man. "They
are in that room from which you saw me come. The doorway this side
upon the right leads down a flight of steps to a corridor that
terminates at a door opening into the royal garden at this end of
the palace. It is never used except by Lodivarman, and as the door
is heavily barred upon the inside and a sentry posted upon the
outside, there is no likelihood that anyone will enter there, so
that there remains only this doorway to be guarded."</p>

<p>"My zeal shall merit the attention of the King," said the
sentry, as the major-domo passed on into the banquet hall and
disappeared from view.</p>

<p>The moment that the man was out of sight King hastened quickly
up the corridor and paused before the door, behind which the
major-domo told him he had left Lodivarman and Fou-tan. As he
paused he heard a woman's voice raised in a cry of terror; it came
from beyond the heavy panels of the door, and it was scarcely
voiced ere Gordon King pushed the portal aside and stepped into the
room.</p>

<p>Before him Fou-tan was struggling to release herself from the
clutches of Lodivarman. Horror and revulsion were written large
upon her countenance, while rage and lust distorted the hideous
face of the Leper King.</p>

<p>At the sight of the warrior Lodivarman's face went livid with
rage even greater than that which had been dominating him.</p>

<p>"How dare you!" he screamed. "You shall die for this. Who sent
you hither?"</p>

<p>Gordon King closed the door behind him and advanced toward
Lodivarman.</p>

<p>"Gordon King!" cried the girl, her astonishment reflected in her
tone and in the expression upon her face. For an instant hope
sprang to her eyes, but quickly it faded to be replaced by the fear
that she felt for him now as well as for herself. "Oh, Gordon King,
they will kill you for this!"</p>

<p>And now Lodivarman recognized him, too. "So you are the warrior
who slew the tiger single-handed!" he cried. "What brought you
here?"</p>

<p>"I have come for Fou-tan," said King simply.</p>

<p>Lodivarman's rotting face twitched with rage. He was rendered
speechless by the effrontery of this low knave. Twice he tried to
speak, but his anger choked him; and then he sprang for a cord that
depended against one of the walls, but King guessed his purpose and
forestalled him. Springing forward, he grasped Lodivarman roughly
by the shoulder and hurled him back. "Not a sound out of you," he
said, "or Lodidhapura will be needing a new king."</p>

<p>It was then that Lodivarman found his voice. "You shall be
boiled in oil for this," he said in a low voice.</p>

<p>"Then I might as well kill you," said Gordon King, "for if I
have to die, it is well that I have my vengeance first," and he
raised his spear as though to cast it.</p>

<p>"No, no!" exclaimed Lodivarman. "Do not kill me. I grant you
pardon for your great offence."</p>

<p>King could not but marvel at the workings of the great law of
self-preservation that caused this diseased and rotten thing,
burdened by misery, hatred, and unhappiness, so tenaciously to
cling to the hope of life.</p>

<p>"Come, come!" cried Lodivarman. "Tell me what you want and be
gone."</p>

<p>"I told you what I wanted," said King. "I came for Fou-tan."</p>

<p>"You cannot have her," cried Lodivarman. "She is mine. Think you
that a woman would leave a king for you, knave?"</p>

<p>"Ask her," said King; but there was no need to ask her. Fou-tan
crossed quickly to the American's side.</p>

<p>"Oh, Lodivarman," she cried, "let me go away in peace with this
warrior."</p>

<p>"It is that or death, Lodivarman," said King coldly.</p>

<p>"That or death," repeated Lodivarman in a half whisper. "Very
well, then, you have won," he added presently. "Go in peace and
take the girl with you." But even if he had not noted the cunning
expression in the King's eyes, Gordon King would not have been
deceived by this sudden acquiescence to his demand.</p>

<p>"You are wise, Lodivarman," he said&mdash;"wise to choose the
easiest solution to your problem. I, too, must be guided by wisdom
and by my knowledge of the ways of tyrants. Lie down upon the
floor."</p>

<p>"Why?" demanded Lodivarman. "What would you do to me? Do you
forget that I am a king, that my person is holy?"</p>

<p>"I remember that you are a man and that men may die if, living,
they present an obstacle to another man who is desperate.
Lodivarman, you must know that I am desperate."</p>

<p>"I have told you that you might go in peace," said the monarch.
"Why would you humiliate me?"</p>

<p>"I have no desire to humiliate you, Lodivarman. I only wish to
assure myself that you will not be able to give the alarm before
Fou-tan and I are beyond the walls of Lodidhapura. I would secure
you so that you cannot leave this chamber; and as you have given
orders that no one is to enter this part of the King's house until
you summon, it will be morning, at least, before you can despatch
warriors in pursuit of us."</p>

<p>"He speaks the truth," said Fou-tan to the King; "you will not
be harmed."</p>

<p>For a moment Lodivarman stood silent as though in thought, and
then suddenly and quite unexpectedly he leaped straight for King,
striking up the warrior's spear and endeavoring to clutch him by
the throat. Lodivarman was no coward.</p>

<p>So impetuous was the leper's charge that King was borne backward
beneath the man's weight. His heel caught in the fold of a tiger
skin upon the floor, and he fell heavily backward with Lodivarman
upon him. The fingers of the leper were already at his throat; the
rotting face was close to his; the odor of fetid breath was in his
nostrils. But only for an instant did the Khmer King have an
advantage. As he raised his voice to summon help, the hand of the
American found his throat, choking out the sound even as it was
born. Youth and strength and endurance all were upon the side of
the younger man. Slowly he wormed his body from beneath that of the
King; and then, kicking one of Lodivarman's braced feet from
beneath him, he rolled the Khmer over upon his back and was upon
him. Lodivarman's grip was wrenched from King's throat, and now the
Khmer was gasping for breath as he fought, violently but futilely,
to disengage himself from the clutches of the man upon him.</p>

<p>"Lie still," said King. "Do not force me to kill you." The
repulsive sores upon the face of the King were directly beneath his
eyes. Even in this tense moment that was so closely approaching
tragedy, the habits of his medical training were still sufficiently
strong to cause the American to give considerably more than cursory
attention to these outward physical symptoms of the dread disease
that had given Lodivarman the name of the Leper King; and what the
doctor in him saw induced a keen regret that he could not
investigate this strange case more fully.</p>

<p>At King's last command and threat, Lodivarman had ceased his
struggles, and the American had relaxed his grasp upon the other's
throat. "Are there any cords attached to the hangings in the room,
Fou-tan?" he demanded of the girl.</p>

<p>"Yes, there are cords at the windows," replied she.</p>

<p>"Get them for me," said the American.</p>

<p>Quickly Fou-tan wrenched the cords loose from their fastenings
and brought them to King, and with them the man bound the wrists
and ankles of the Khmer King. So securely did he bind them and so
tightly did he tie the knots that he had no fear that Lodivarman
could release himself without aid; and now to be doubly certain
that he could not summon assistance, King stuffed a gag of soft
cloth into the mouth of his royal prisoner and bound it tightly
there with another cord. Then he sprang to his feet.</p>

<p>"Come, Fou-tan," he said, "we have no time to lose; but wait,
you cannot go abroad in that garb. You are to accompany me as a
slave girl, not as an apsara."</p>

<p>Fou-tan snatched off her ornate headdress and threw it upon the
floor; then she loosened the golden girdle that held her voluminous
skirt in place, and as it dropped to the floor King saw that she
wore a silken sampot beneath it. Across a taboret was a long drape,
the ends of which were spread upon the floor. This Fou-tan took and
wound about her lithe form as a sarong.</p>

<p>"I am ready, Gordon King," she said.</p>

<p>"The ear-rings," he suggested, "the necklace, and your other
wrist ornaments. They look too royal for a slave."</p>

<p>"You are right," she said, as she removed them.</p>

<p>King quickly extinguished the cressets, leaving the room in
darkness. Then together the two groped their way to the door.
Opening it a little, King looked about. The corridor was empty. He
drew Fou-tan into it and closed the door behind him. To the next
door in the corridor he stepped and tried it; it was not locked. He
could just see the top of a flight of stone steps leading down into
utter darkness. He wished that he had brought one of the cressets,
but now it was too late. He drew Fou-tan within and closed the
door, and now they could see nothing.</p>

<p>"Where does this lead?" asked Fou-tan in a whisper.</p>

<p>"It is the King's private passage to the garden," replied the
American, "and if I have made no mistake in my calculations, the
other end of it is guarded by a sentry who will pass us with a
wink."</p>

<p>As they groped their way slowly down the steps and along the
corridor King explained to Fou-tan the subterfuge he had adopted to
obtain a place upon the guard that night and that he had
particularly noticed the little door at the end of this wing of the
palace and when the major-domo had told him of the private passage
leading to the garden he had guessed that it ended at this very
door. "The sentry there," he had concluded, "is from my own
barracks and knows the story. That is why you must be a little
slave girl tonight, Fou-tan."</p>

<p>"I do not mind being a slave girl&mdash;now," she said, and King
felt the little fingers of the hand he held press his own more
tightly.</p>

<p>They came at last to the end of the corridor. In the darkness
King's fingers ran over the surface of the door in search of bars
and bolts. The fastening, which he found at last, was massive but
simple. It moved beneath the pressure of his hand with only a
slight grating sound. He pushed the door slowly open; the fresh
night air blew in upon them; the starlit heavens bathed the garden
in gentle luminosity. Cautiously King crossed the threshold. He saw
the warrior upon his post without, and instantly the man saw
him.</p>

<p>"Who comes?" demanded the sentry, dropping his spear-point on a
level with King's breast as he wheeled quickly toward him.</p>

<p>"It is I&mdash;King&mdash;of Vama's ten. I have found the slave
girl of whom I told you, and I would walk in the garden with her
for a few moments."</p>

<p>"I do not know you," snapped the warrior. "I never heard of you
or your slave girl," and then it was that King realized that he had
never seen this man before&mdash;that the sentries had been changed
since he had entered the palace. His heart sank within him, yet he
maintained a bold front.</p>

<p>"It will do no harm to let us pass for a while," he said, "you
can see that I am a member of the guard, as otherwise I could not
have gained access to the King's house."</p>

<p>"That may be true," replied the warrior, "but I have my orders
that no one shall pass either in or out of this doorway without
proper authority. I will summon an officer. If he wishes to let you
pass, that is none of my affair."</p>

<p>Fou-tan had been standing at King's side. Now she moved slowly
and languorously toward the sentry. Every undulating motion of her
lithe body was provocative. She came very close to him and turned
her beautiful face up toward his. Her eyes were dreamy wells of
promise. "For me?" she asked in a soft, caressing voice. "For me,
warrior, could you not be blind for a moment?"</p>

<p>"For you, yes," said the man huskily, "but you are not for me;
you belong to him."</p>

<p>"I have a sister," suggested Fou-tan. "When I return within the
King's house, perhaps she will come to this little door. What do
you say, warrior?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps it can do no harm," he said hesitatingly. "How long
will you remain in the garden?"</p>

<p>"We shall be in the garden only a few minutes," said King.</p>

<p>"I shall turn my back," said the sentry. "I have not seen you.
Remember that, I have not seen you."</p>

<p>"Nor have we seen you," replied King.</p>

<p>"Do not forget your sister, little one," said the sentry, as he
turned away from them and continued along his post, while Gordon
King and Fou-tan merged with the shadows of the trees beyond.</p>

<p>Perhaps, hours later, when he was relieved, the sentry realized
that he had been duped, but there were excellent reasons why he
should keep a still tongue in his head, though he intended at first
opportunity to look up this warrior who said that his name was King
and demand an accounting from him. Perhaps, after all, the slave
girl had had no sister, with which thought he turned on his pallet
of straw and fell asleep.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch9" id="ch9">IX. &mdash; THE FLIGHT</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">True to their promise to the sentry, Fou-tan and
King did not remain long within the garden of Lodivarman, the Leper
King. Inasmuch as the walls had been built to keep people out of
the royal enclosure, rather than to keep them in, it was not
difficult to find a spot where they might be scaled, since in many
places trees grew near, their branches overhanging.</p>

<p>Along the unlighted streets of the city proper the sight of a
warrior and a girl was not so uncommon as to attract attention, and
so it was with comparative ease that they made their way to the
city's outer wall. Here, once more, a like condition prevailed. Low
sheds and buildings abutted against the inner surface of the city's
ramparts, and presently King found a place where they could ascend
to the roof of a building and surmount the wall itself. The drop to
the ground upon the outside, however, was considerable, and here
they were confronted with the greatest danger that had menaced them
since they had passed the sentry. For either one of them to suffer
a sprained ankle or a broken leg at this time would have been fatal
to both.</p>

<p>In the darkness King could not determine the nature of the
ground at the foot of the wall; the light of the stars was not
sufficient for that.</p>

<p>"We shall have to take a chance here, Fou-tan," he said.</p>

<p>"It is high, Gordon King; but if you tell me to I will
jump."</p>

<p>"No," he said, "that is not necessary. I judge that the wall is
about twenty feet high here. My spear is six feet long; your sarong
must be at least eight feet, possibly longer."</p>

<p>"Yes, it is much too long," she said; "it was not intended for a
sarong. But what has that to do with it?"</p>

<p>"I am going to tie one end of the sarong to the end of my spear;
I shall tie a knot in the other end of the sarong. Do you think
that you are strong enough to cling to that knot while I lower you
as near the ground as I can?"</p>

<p>"I am very strong," said Fou-tan, "and desperation lends even
greater strength." As she spoke she commenced to remove her sarong,
and a moment later King was lowering her slowly over the edge of
the wall.</p>

<p>"When I have lowered you as far as I can," he whispered in her
ear, "I shall tell you to drop. After you have done so, stand
quickly to one side, and I will drop my spear. Then you must take
it away so that I will not fall upon it; and also if the ground is
rough, smooth it a little for me."</p>

<p>"Yes," she said, and King lowered her away down the outside of
the wall of Lodidhapura.</p>

<p>Presently he was clinging only to the end of the spear and was
leaning far over the edge of the wall. "Drop," he said in a low
voice. Instantly the pull of her weight was gone from the spear
handle in his hand. "Are you all right?" he asked in a low
voice.</p>

<p>"Yes," she replied. "Drop the spear," and then an instant later:
"the grass is thick and soft here."</p>

<p>King lowered himself over the edge of the wall and hung an
instant by his fingers. Then he released his hold and dropped. As
he rolled over in the tall grass, considerably jarred but unhurt,
Fou-tan was at his side. "You are all right, Gordon King?" she
demanded. "You are not hurt?"</p>

<p>"I am all right," he said.</p>

<p>"I shall sacrifice a bullock in the temple of Siva when we reach
Pnom Dhek," she said.</p>

<p>"For your sake, Fou-tan, I hope that it will not be long before
you are able to sacrifice the bullock, but we are not at Pnom Dhek
yet; I do not even know where it is."</p>

<p>"I do," replied the girl.</p>

<p>"In what direction?" he asked.</p>

<p>She pointed. "There," she said, "but the way is long and
difficult."</p>

<p>Near them was a group of native huts, clustered close to the
foot of the wall, and so they moved out straight across the
clearing to the edge of the jungle and then, turning, paralleled
the jungle until they had passed the city.</p>

<p>"When we were brought into Lodidhapura I saw an avenue leading
into the jungle somewhere in this direction," said King.</p>

<p>"Yes," replied Fou-tan, "but that does not lead to Pnom
Dhek."</p>

<p>"Which is the reason that I wish to find it," said King. "The
pursuit will be directed straight in the direction of Pnom Dhek,
you may be assured. Men upon elephants and upon horses will travel
after us much more rapidly than we can travel and we shall be
overtaken if we take the road toward Pnom Dhek. We must go in some
other direction and hide in the jungle for days, perhaps, before we
may dare to approach Pnom Dhek."</p>

<p>"I do not care," she said, "and I shall not be afraid if you are
with me, Gordon King."</p>

<p>It was not long before they found the road that he sought. In
the open starlit night the transition to the jungle was depressing
and, too, as they both realized, it was highly dangerous. All about
them were the noises of the gloomy nocturnal forest. The mysterious
rustling of underbrush as some beast passed on padded feet, a
coughing growl in the distance, a snarl and a scream, followed by a
long silence that was more terrifying than the noise.</p>

<p>A few months ago King would have considered their position far
more precarious than he did this night, but now long familiarity
with the jungle had so inured him to its dangers that he had
unwittingly acquired that tendency to fatalism that is a noticeable
characteristic of primitive people who live constantly beneath the
menace of beasts of prey. He was, however, no less aware of the
dangers that confronted them, but held them the lesser of two
evils. To remain in the neighborhood of Lodidhapura would most
certainly result in their early capture and subject them to a fate
more merciless and more cruel than any which might waylay them
along the dark aisles of the forest. Propinquity had considerably
altered his estimation of the great cats; whereas formerly he had
thought of them as the fearless exterminators of mankind, he had
since learned that not all of them are mankillers and that more
often did they avoid man than pursue him. The chances, then, that
they might come through the night without attack were greatly in
their favor; but should they meet a tiger or a leopard or a panther
which, because of hunger, old age, or viciousness, should elect to
attack them, their doom might well be sealed; and whether they were
moving away from Lodidhapura upon the ground or hiding in a tree,
they would be almost equally at the mercy of one or another of
these fierce carnivores.</p>

<p>The avenue that they were following, which entered the jungle
from Lodidhapura, ran broad and clear for a considerable distance
into the forest, dwindling at last to little more than an ordinary
game-trail. To elude their pursuers, they must leave it; but that
they might not attempt until daylight, since to strike out blindly
into the trackless jungle, buried in the impenetrable gloom of
night, must almost assuredly have spelled disaster.</p>

<p>"Even if they find Lodivarman before morning," he said, "I doubt
that they will commence their search for us before daylight."</p>

<p>"They will be ordered out in pursuit the instant that Lodivarman
can issue a command," replied Fou-tan; "but there is little
likelihood that anyone will dare to risk his anger by approaching
the apartment in which he lies until his long silence has aroused
suspicion. If your bonds hold and he is unable to remove the gag
from his mouth, I doubt very much that he will be discovered before
noon. His people fear his anger, which is quick and merciless, and
there is only one man in all Lodidhapura who would risk incurring
it by entering that apartment before Lodivarman summoned him."</p>

<p>"And who is that?" asked King.</p>

<p>"Vay Thon, the high priest of Siva," replied the girl.</p>

<p>"If I am missed and the word reaches the ears of Vay Thon," said
King, "it is likely that his suspicion may be aroused."</p>

<p>"Why?" asked Fou-tan.</p>

<p>"Because I talked with him this afternoon, and I could see that
he guessed what was in my heart. It was he who told me that
Lodivarman would send for you tonight. It was Vay Thon who warned
me to attempt no rash deed."</p>

<p>"He does not love Lodivarman," said the girl, "and it may be
that if he guessed the truth he might be silent, for he has been
kind to me; and I know that he liked you."</p>

<p>For hour after hour the two groped their way along the dark
trail, aided now by the dim light of the moon that the canopy of
foliage above blocked and diffused until that which reached the
jungle floor could not be called light at all, but rather a lesser
degree of darkness.</p>

<p>With the passing of the hours King realized that Fou-tan's steps
were commencing to lag. He timed his own then, to suit hers and,
walking close beside her, supported her with his arm. She seemed so
small and delicate and unsuited to an ordeal like this that the man
marvelled at her stamina. More of a hot-house plant than a girl of
flesh and blood seemed Fou-tan of Pnom Dhek, and yet she was
evincing the courage and endurance of a man. He recalled that not
once during the night had she voiced any fear of the jungle, not
even when great beasts had passed so close to them that they could
almost hear their breathing. If Khmer slaves were of this stock, to
what noble heights of courage must the masters achieve!</p>

<p>"You are very tired, Fou-tan," he said; "we shall rest
presently."</p>

<p>"No," she replied. "Do not stop on my account. If you would not
rest upon your own account, it must be that you do not think it
wise to do so; that I am with you should make no difference. When
you feel the need of rest and believe that it is safe to rest, then
I may rest also, but not until then."</p>

<p>Stealthily the dawn, advance guard of the laggard day, crept
slowly through the jungle, pushing back the impenetrable shadows of
the night. Shadowy trees emerged from the darkness; armies of gaunt
grey boles marched in endless procession slowly by them; the trail
that had been but a blank wall of darkness before projected itself
forward to the next turn; the hideous night lay behind them, and a
new hope was born within their bosoms. It was time now to leave the
trail and search for a hiding-place, and conditions were
particularly favorable at this spot, since the underbrush was
comparatively scant.</p>

<p>Turning abruptly to the left, King struck off at right angles to
the trail; and for another hour the two pushed onward into the
untracked mazes of the forest. This last hour was particularly
difficult, for there was no trail and the ground rose rapidly,
suggesting to King that they were approaching mountains. There were
numerous outcroppings of rocks; and at length they came to the edge
of a gorge, in the bottom of which ran a stream of pure water.</p>

<p>"The gods have been good to us," exclaimed King.</p>

<p>"I have been praying to them all night," said Fou-tan.</p>

<p>The little stream had cut deeply into its limestone bed; but at
last they found a way down to the water, where the cool and
refreshing liquid gave them renewed strength and hope.</p>

<p>The evidences of erosion in the limestone about them suggested
to King that a little search might reveal a safe and adequate
hiding-place. Fortunately the water in the stream was low, giving
them dry footing along its side as they followed the gorge upward;
nor had they gone far before they discovered a location that was
ideal for their purpose. Here the stream made a sharp bend that was
almost a right angle; and where the waters had rushed for countless
ages against the base of a limestone cliff, they had eaten their
way far into it, hollowing out a sanctuary where the two fugitives
would be safe from observation from above.</p>

<p>Leaving Fou-tan in the little grotto, King crossed the stream
and gathered an armful of dry grasses that grew above the high
water-line upon the opposite side. After several trips he was able
to make a reasonably comfortable bed for each of them.</p>

<p>"Sleep now," he said to Fou-tan; "and when you are rested, I
shall sleep."</p>

<p>The girl would have demurred, wishing him to sleep first; but
even as she voiced her protest, exhaustion overcame her and she
sank into a profound slumber. Seated with his back against the
limestone wall of their retreat, King sought desperately to keep
awake; but the monotonous sound of the running water, which drowned
all other sounds, acted as a soporific, which, combined with
outraged Nature's craving for rest, made the battle he was waging a
difficult one. Twice he dozed and then, disgusted with himself, he
arose and paced to and fro the length of their sanctuary, but the
instant that he sat down again he was gone.</p>

<p>It was mid-afternoon when King awoke with a start. He had been
the victim of a harrowing dream, so real that even as he awoke he
grasped his spear and leaped to his feet, but there was no danger
menacing. He listened intently, but the only sound came from the
leaping waters of the stream.</p>

<p>Fou-tan opened her eyes and looked at him. "What is it?" she
asked.</p>

<p>He grimaced in self-disgust. "I slept at my post," he said. "I
have been asleep a long time, and I have just awakened."</p>

<p>"I am glad," she said with a smile. "I hope that you have slept
for a long time."</p>

<p>"I have slept almost as long as you have, Fou-tan," he replied;
"but suppose that they had come while I slept."</p>

<p>"They did not come, however," she reminded him.</p>

<p>"Well, right or wrong, we have both slept now," he said, "and my
next business is to obtain food."</p>

<p>"There is plenty in the forest," she said.</p>

<p>"Yes, I noted it as we came this way in the morning."</p>

<p>"Will it be safe to go out and search for food?" asked the
girl.</p>

<p>"We shall have to take the chance," he replied. "We must eat and
we cannot find food at night. We shall have to go together,
Fou-tan, as I cannot risk leaving you alone for a moment."</p>

<p>As King and Fou-tan left their hiding-place and started down the
gorge toward a place where they could clamber out of it into the
forest in search of food, a creature at the summit of the cliff
upon the opposite side of the stream crouched behind a low bush and
watched them. Out of small eyes, deep-set beneath a mass of tangled
hair, the creature watched every movement of the two; and when they
had passed, it followed them stealthily, stalking them as a tiger
might have stalked. But this was no tiger; it was a man&mdash;a
huge, hulking brute of a man, standing well over six-feet-six on
its great flat feet. Its only apparel was a G string, made from the
skin of a wild animal. It wore no ornaments, but it carried
weapons&mdash;a short spear, a bow, and arrows.</p>

<p>The jungle lore that the American had learned under the tutorage
of Che stood him in good stead now, for it permitted him quickly to
locate edible fruit and tubers without waste of time and with a
minimum of effort. Fou-tan, city-bred, had but a hazy and most
impractical knowledge of the flora of the jungle. She knew the
tall, straight teak standing leafless now in the dry season and the
India-rubber tree; and with almost childish delight she recognized
the leathery laurel-like leaves of the tree from whose gum resin
gamboge is secured; the tall, flowering stems of the cardamon she
knew too; but the sum total of her knowledge would not have given
sustenance to a canary in the jungle. It was therefore that King's
efficiency in this matter filled her with awe and admiration. Her
dark eyes followed his every move; and when he had collected all of
the food that they could conveniently carry and they had turned
their steps back toward their hiding-place, Fou-tan was bubbling
over with pride and confidence and happiness. Perhaps it was as
well that she did not see the uncouth figure hiding in the
underbrush as they passed.</p>

<p>Back in their retreat they partially satisfied their hunger with
such of the food as did not require cooking.

<p>"Tonight we can have a
fire," said King, "and roast some of these tubers. It would not be
safe now, for the smoke might be seen for a considerable distance;
but at night they will not be searching for us, and the light of a
small fire will never escape from this gorge."</p>

<p>After they had eaten, King took his spear and walked down to the
stream where he had seen fish jumping. He was prompted more by a
desire to pass away the time than by any hope of success in this
piscatorial adventure, but so numerous were the fish and so
unafraid that he succeeded in spearing two with the utmost ease
while Fou-tan stood at his elbow applauding him with excited little
exclamations and squeals of delight.</p>

<p>King had never been any less sensitive to the approbation of the
opposite sex than any other normal man, but never, he realized, had
praise sounded more sweetly in his ears than now. There was
something so altogether sincere in Fou-tan's praise that it never
even remotely suggested adulation. He had always found her such an
altogether forthright little person that he could never doubt her
sincerity.</p>

<p>"Now we shall have a feast," she exclaimed, as they carried the
fishes back into their grotto. "It is a good thing for me that you
are here, Gordon King, and not another."</p>

<p>"Why, Fou-tan?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Imagine Bharata Rahon or any of the others being faced with the
necessity of finding food for me here in the jungle!" she
exclaimed. "Why, I should either have starved to death or have been
poisoned by their ignorance and stupidity. No, there is no one like
Gordon King, as Fou-tan, his slave, should know."</p>

<p>"Do not call yourself that," he said. "You are not my
slave."</p>

<p>"Let us play that I am," she said. "I like it. A slave is great
in the greatness of his master; therefore, it can be no disgrace to
be the slave of Gordon King."</p>

<p>"If I had not found you here in the jungles of Cambodia," he
said; "I could have sworn that you are Irish."</p>

<p>"Irish?" she asked. "What is Irish?"</p>

<p>"The Irish are a people who live upon a little island far, far
away. They have a famous stone there, and when one has kissed this
stone he cannot help thereafter speaking in terms of extravagant
praise of all whom he meets. It is said that all of the Irish have
kissed this stone."</p>

<p>"I do not have to kiss a stone to tell the truth to you, Gordon
King," she said. "I do not always say nice things to people, but I
like to say them to you."</p>

<p>"Why?" he asked.</p>

<p>"I do not know, Gordon King," said Fou-tan, and her eyes dropped
from his level gaze.</p>

<p>They were sitting upon the dry grasses that he had gathered for
their beds. King sat now in silence, looking at the girl. For the
thousandth time he was impressed by her great beauty, and then the
face of another girl arose in a vision between them. It was the
face of Susan Anne Prentice. With a short laugh King turned his
gaze down toward the stream; while once again, upon the opposite
cliff-top, the little eyes of the great man watched them.</p>

<p>"Why do you laugh, Gordon King?" asked Fou-tan, looking up
suddenly.</p>

<p>"You would not understand, Fou-tan," he said. He had been
thinking of what Susan Anne would say could she have knowledge of
the situation in which he then was&mdash;a situation which he
realized was not only improbable but impossible. Here was he,
Gordon King, a graduate physician, a perfectly normal product of
the twentieth century, sitting almost naked under a big rock with a
little slave girl of a race that had disappeared hundreds of years
before. That in itself was preposterous. But there was another
matter that was even less credible; he realized that he enjoyed the
situation, and most of all he enjoyed the company of the little
slave girl.</p>

<p>"You are laughing at me, Gordon King," said Fou-tan, "and I do
not like to be laughed at."</p>

<p>"I was not laughing at you, Fou-tan," he replied. "I could not
laugh at you. I&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You what?" she demanded.</p>

<p>"I could not laugh at you," he replied lamely.</p>

<p>"You said that once before, Gordon King," she reminded him. "You
started to say something else. What was it?"</p>

<p>For a moment he was silent. "I have forgotten, Fou-tan," he said
then.</p>

<p>His eyes were turned away from her as she looked at him keenly
in silence for some time. Then a slow smile lighted her face and
she broke into a little humming song.</p>

<p>The man upon the opposite cliff withdrew stealthily until he was
out of sight of the two in the gorge below him. Then he arose to an
erect position and crept softly away into the forest. Ready in his
hands were his bow and an arrow. For all his great size and weight
he moved without noise, his little eyes shifting constantly from
side to side. Suddenly, and so quickly that one could scarcely
follow the movements of his hands, an arrow sped from his bow, and
an instant later he stepped forward and picked up a large rat that
had been transfixed by his missile. The creature moved slowly
onward, and presently a little monkey swung through the trees above
him. Again the bowstring twanged, and the little monkey hurtled to
the ground at the feet of the primitive hunter. Squatting on his
haunches the man-thing ate the rat raw; then he carried the monkey
back to the edge of the gorge, and after satisfying himself that
the two were still there he fell to upon the principal item of his
dinner; and he was still eating when darkness came.</p>

<p>Fou-tan had not broken King's embarrassed silence, but presently
the man arose. "Where are you going, Gordon King?" she asked.</p>

<p>"There is some driftwood lodged upon the opposite bank, left
there by last season's flood waters. We shall need it for our
cooking fire tonight:"</p>

<p>"I will go with you and help you," said Fou-tan, and together
they crossed the little stream and gathered the dry wood for their
fire.</p>

<p>From Che and Kangrey the American had learned to make fire
without matches; and he soon had a little blaze burning, far back
beneath the shelter of their overhanging rock. He had cleaned and
washed the fish and now proceeded to grill them over the fire,
while Fou-tan roasted two large tubers impaled upon the ends of
sticks.</p>

<p>"I would not exchange this for the palace of a king, Gordon
King," she said.</p>

<p>"Nor I, Fou-tan," he replied.</p>

<p>"Are you happy, Gordon King?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Yes," he replied. "And you, Fou-tan, are you happy?"</p>

<p>She nodded her head. "It is because you and I are together," she
said simply.</p>

<p>"We come from opposite ends of the earth, Fou-tan," he said, "we
are separated by centuries of time, we have nothing in common, your
world and my world are as remote from one another as the stars; and
yet, Fou-tan, it seems as though I had known you always. It does
not seem possible that I have lived all my life up to now without
even knowing that you existed."</p>

<p>"I have felt that too, Gordon King," said the girl. "I cannot
understand it, but it is so. However, you are wrong in one
respect."</p>

<p>"And what is that?" he asked.</p>

<p>"You said that we had nothing in common. We have."</p>

<p>"What is it?" demanded King.</p>

<p>Fou-tan shuddered. "The leprosy," she said. "He touched us both.
We shall both have it."</p>

<p>Gordon King laughed. "We shall never contract leprosy from
Lodivarman," he said. "I am a doctor. I know."</p>

<p>"Why shall we not?" she demanded.</p>

<p>"Because Lodivarman is not a leper," replied the American.</p>

<h2><a name="ch10" id="ch10">X. &mdash; LOVE AND THE BRUTE</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">From the opposite side of the gorge the brute,
gnawing upon a leg bone of the monkey, watched the two below. He
saw the fire kindled and it troubled him. He was afraid of fire.
Muddily, in his undeveloped brain, it represented the
personification of some malign power. The brute knew no god; but he
knew that there were forces that brought pain, disaster, death, and
that oftentimes these forces were invisible. The visible causes of
such effects were the enemies he had met in the jungle in the form
of men or of beasts; therefore, it was natural that he should endow
the invisible causes of similar effects with the physical
attributes of the enemies that he could see. He peopled the jungle
accordingly with invisible men and invisible beasts that wrought
pain, disaster, and death. These enemies he held in far greater
fear than those that were visible to him. Fire, he knew, was the
work of one of these dread creatures, and the very sight of it made
him uncomfortable.</p>

<p>The brute was not hungry; he harbored no animosity for the two
creatures he stalked; he was motivated by a more powerful urge than
hunger or hate. He had seen the girl!</p>

<p>The fire annoyed him and kept him at bay; but time meant little
to the brute. He saw that the two had made beds, and he guessed
that they would sleep where they were during the night. On the
morrow they would go out after food, and there would be no fire
with them. The brute was content to wait until the morrow. He found
some tall grass and, getting upon his hands and knees, turned about
several times, as bedding dogs are wont to do, and then lay down.
He had flattened the grasses so that they all lay in one direction,
and when he turned upon his bed he always turned in that direction,
so that the sharp ends of the grasses did not stick into his flesh.
Perhaps he had learned this trick from the wild dogs, or perhaps
the wild dogs first learned it from man. Who knows?</p>

<p>In the darkness Fou-tan and King sat upon their beds and talked.
Fou-tan was full of questions. She wanted to know all about the
strange country from which King came. Most of the things he told
her she could not understand; but her questions were quite often
directed upon subjects that were well within her ken&mdash;there
are some matters that are eternal; time does not alter them.</p>

<p>"Are the women of your country beautiful?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Some of them," replied the man.</p>

<p>"Have you a wife, Gordon King?" The question was voiced in a
whisper.</p>

<p>"No, Fou-tan."</p>

<p>"But you love someone," she insisted, for love is so important
to a woman that she cannot imagine a life devoid of love.</p>

<p>"I have been too busy to fall in love," he replied
good-naturedly.</p>

<p>"You are not very busy now," suggested Fou-tan.</p>

<p>"I think I shall be a very busy man for the next few days trying
to get you back to Pnom Dhek," he assured her.</p>

<p>Fou-tan was silent. It was so dark that he could scarcely see
her. But he could feel her presence near him, and it seemed to
exert as strong an influence upon him as might have physical
contact. He had recognized the power of that indefinable thing
called personality when he had talked with people and looked into
their eyes; but he never had had it reach out through the dark and
lay hold of him as though with warm fingers of flesh and blood, and
King found the sensation most disquieting.</p>

<p>They lay in silence upon their beds of dry grasses, each
occupied with his own thoughts. The heat of the jungle day was
rising slowly from the narrow gorge, and a damp chill was replacing
it. The absolute darkness which surrounded them was slightly
mitigated in their immediate vicinity by an occasional flame rising
from the embers of their dying fire as some drying twigs of their
fuel ignited. King was thinking of the girl at his side, of the
responsibility which her presence entailed, and of the duty that he
owed to her and to himself. He tried not to think about her, but
that he found impossible, and the more that she was in his mind the
stronger became the realization of the hold that she had obtained
upon him; that the sensation that she animated within him was love
seemed incredibly preposterous. He tried to assure himself that it
was but an infatuation engendered by her beauty and propinquity,
and he girded himself to conquer his infatuation that he might
perform the duty that had devolved upon him in so impersonal a way
that there might be no regret.</p>

<p>In order to fortify this noble decision he cast Fou-tan from his
mind entirely and occupied himself with thoughts of his friends in
far-away America. In retrospect he laughed and danced again with
Susan Anne Prentice; he listened to her pleasant cultured voice and
enjoyed once more the sweet companionship of the girl who was to
him all that a beloved sister might have been; and then a little
sigh came from the bed of grasses at his side, and the vision of
Susan Anne Prentice faded into oblivion.</p>

<p>Again there was a long silence, broken only by the murmur of the
tumbling stream.</p>

<p>"Gordon King!" It was just a whisper.</p>

<p>"What is it, Fou-tan?"</p>

<p>"I am afraid, Gordon King," said the girl. How like a little
child in the dark she sounded. Before he could answer, there came
the sound of a soft thud down the gorge and the rattle of loose
earth falling from above.</p>

<p>"What was that?" asked Fou-tan in a frightened whisper.
"Something is coming, Gordon King. Look!"</p>

<p>Silently the man rose to his feet, grasping his spear in
readiness. Down the gorge he saw two blazing points of flame; and
quickly stepping to their fire, he placed dry twigs upon the
embers, blowing upon them gently until they burst into flame. At a
little distance those two glowing spots burned out of the
darkness.</p>

<p>King piled more wood upon the fire until it blazed up bravely,
illuminating their little grotto and revealing Fou-tan sitting up
upon her bed of grasses, gazing with wide horror-filled eyes at
those two silent, ominous harbingers of death fixed so menacingly
upon them. "My Lord the Tiger!" she whispered; and her low, tense
tones were vibrant with all the inherent horror of the great beast
that had been passed down to her by countless progenitors, for whom
My Lord the Tiger had constituted life's greatest menace.</p>

<p>Primitive creatures, constantly surrounded by lethal dangers,
sleep lightly. The descent of the great cat into the gorge,
followed by the sounds of the falling earth and stones it had
dislodged, brought to his feet the sleeping brute upon the opposite
summit. Thinking that the noise might have come from the quarry in
the gorge below, the creature moved quickly to the edge of the
cliff and looked down; and as the mounting blazes of King's fire
illuminated the scene, the brute saw the great tiger standing with
upraised head, watching the man and the woman in their rocky
retreat.</p>

<p>Here was an interloper that aroused the ire of the brute; here
was a deadly enemy about to seize that which the brute had already
marked as his own. The creature selected a heavy arrow, the
heaviest arrow that he carried, and, fitting it to his bow, he bent
the sturdy weapon until the point of the arrow touched the fingers
of his bow-hand; then he let drive at a point just behind the
shoulders of the tiger.</p>

<p>What happened thereafter happened very quickly. The arrow drove
through to the great cat's lungs; the shock, the surprise and the
pain brought instant reaction. Not having sensed the presence of
any other formidable creature than those before him, My Lord the
Tiger must naturally have assumed that they were the authors of his
hurt. This supposition, at least, seemed likely if judged by that
which immediately occurred.</p>

<p>With a hideous roar, with blazing eyes, with wide distended
jaws, revealing gleaming fangs, the great cat charged straight for
King. Into the circle of firelight it bounded like a
personification of some hideous force of destruction.</p>

<p>Little Fou-tan, on her feet beside King, seized a blazing brand
from the fire and hurled it full into the face of the charging
beast; but the tiger was too far gone in pain and rage longer to
harbor fear of aught.</p>

<p>King's spear-arm went back. Through his mind flashed the
recollection of the other tiger that he had killed with a single
spear cast. He had known then that he had been for the instant the
favored child of Fortune. The laws of chance would never
countenance a repetition of that amazing stroke of luck; yet there
was naught that he could do but try.</p>

<p>He held his nerves and muscles in absolute control, the servants
of his iron will. Every faculty of mind and body was centered upon
the accuracy and the power of his spear-arm. Had he given thought
to what might follow, his nerves must necessarily have faltered,
but he did not. Cool and collected, he waited until he knew that he
could not miss nor wait another moment. Then the bronze skin of his
spear-arm flashed in the light of the fire, and at the same instant
he swept Fou-tan to him with his left arm and leaped to one
side.</p>

<p>Not even My Lord the Tiger could have acted with greater
celerity, calmness, and judgment. A low grunt of surprise and
admiration burst from the lips of the brute watching from the
summit of the opposite cliff.</p>

<p>The charge of the tiger carried it full into the fire,
scattering the burning branches in all directions. The dry grasses
of the beds burst into flame. Blinded and terrified, the tiger
looked about futilely for his prey; but King had leaped quickly
across the stream to the opposite side of the gorge, having learned
by experience that a creature near the fire can see nothing in the
outer darkness. The great cat, clawing and biting at the spear
protruding from its chest, rent the air with its screams of pain
and growls of rage. Suddenly it was quiet, standing like a yellow
and black statue carved from gold and ebony; then it took a few
steps forward, sagged, and slumped lifeless to the ground.</p>

<p>Gordon King felt very weak in the knees, so weak that he sat
down quite suddenly. He had rung the bell twice in succession, but
he could scarcely believe the evidence of his own eyes. Fou-tan
came and sat down close beside him and rested her cheek against his
arm. "My Gordon King!" she murmured softly.</p>

<p>Almost without volition he put his arm about her. "My Fou-tan!"
he said. The girl snuggled close in his embrace.</p>

<p>For a time they sat watching the tiger, hesitating to approach
lest there might remain a spark of life within the great form, each
knowing that one little instant of life would be sufficient to
destroy them both were they near the beast; but the great cat never
moved again.</p>

<p>The dissipated fire was dying down, and realizing more than ever
now the necessity for keeping it up, King and Fou-tan arose and,
crossing the stream, scraped together the remaining embers of their
fire and rebuilt it with fresh wood.</p>

<p>From the cliff above the brute watched them, and once again
grunted his admiration as he saw King withdraw his spear from the
body of the fallen tiger. Placing one foot against the breast of
the great beast, the American was forced to exert every ounce of
his weight and strength to withdraw the weapon, so deeply was it
embedded in the bone and sinew of its victim.</p>

<p>"I am afraid that we shall not get much sleep tonight, Fou-tan,"
said King as he returned to the fire.</p>

<p>"I am not sleepy," replied the girl; "I could not sleep, and
then, too, it is commencing to get cold. I would rather sit here by
the fire until morning. I would rather have my eyes open than
closed in the night when My Lord the Tiger walks abroad."</p>

<p>Once more they sat down side by side, their backs against the
rocky wall that had been warmed by the heat of the nearby fire.</p>

<p>The brute, realizing that they had settled themselves for the
night, returned to his primitive bed and settled himself once more
for sleep.</p>

<p>Fou-tan cuddled close to Gordon King; his arm was about her. He
felt her soft hair against his cheek. He drew her closer to him.
"Fou-tan!" he said.</p>

<p>"Yes, Gordon King, what is it?" she asked. He noted that her
voice trembled.</p>

<p>"I love you," said Gordon King.</p>

<p>A sigh that came in little gasps was his reply. He felt her
heart pounding against his side.</p>

<p>A soft arm crept upward to encircle his neck, drawing him gently
down to the sweet face turned toward his. Eyes, dimmed with unshed
tears, gazed into his eyes. Trembling lips fluttered beneath his
lips, and then he crushed her to him in the first kiss of love.</p>

<p>The flower-like beauty of the girl, her softness, her
helplessness, combined with the exaltation of this, his first love,
enveloped Fou-tan with an aura of sanctity that rendered her almost
an object of veneration in the eyes of the man&mdash;a high
priestess enshrined in the Holy of Holies of his heart. He
marvelled that he had won the love of so glorious a creature. The
little slave girl became an angel, and he her paladin. In this
thought lay the secret of King's attitude toward Fou-tan. He was
glad that she was small and helpless, for he liked to think of
himself as her champion and protector. He liked to feel that the
safety of the girl he loved lay in his hands and that he was
physically and morally competent to discharge the obligations that
Fate had reposed within him.</p>

<p>Despite the fact that she was soft and small, Fou-tan was not
without self-reliance and courage, as she had amply proved when she
had run away from the palace of Lodivarman and risked the perils of
the savage jungle; yet she was still so wholly feminine that she
found her greatest happiness in the protection of the man she
loved.</p>

<p>"I am very happy," whispered Fou-tan.</p>

<p>"And so am I," said King, "happier than I have ever been before
in my life, but now we must make our plans all anew."</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" she asked.</p>

<p>"We may not go to Pnom Dhek now. We must find our way out of the
jungle so that I can take you to my own country."</p>

<p>"Why?" she demanded.</p>

<p>"Before I answer you," he replied, "there is one question that I
have not asked but that you must answer before we make our plans
for the future."</p>

<p>"What is that?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Will you be my wife, Fou-tan?"</p>

<p>"Oh, Gordon King, I have answered that already, for I have told
you that I love you. Fou-tan would not tell any man that whom she
could not or would not take as her husband; but what has that to do
with our returning to Pnom Dhek?"</p>

<p>"It has everything to do with it," replied King, "because I will
not take the woman who is to be my wife back into slavery."</p>

<p>She looked up into his face, her eyes alight with a new
happiness and understanding. "Now I may never doubt that you love
me, Gordon King," she said.</p>

<p>He looked at her questioningly. "I do not understand what you
mean," he said.</p>

<p>"Though you thought that I was born a slave, you asked me to be
your wife," she said.</p>

<p>"You told me from the first that you were a slave girl," he
reminded her.</p>

<p>"I was a slave girl in Lodidhapura," she explained, "but in Pnom
Dhek I am no slave. I must return there to my father's house. It is
my duty. When the King learns what a great warrior you are, he will
give you a place in his guard. Then you will be able to take a
wife, and, perhaps, my father will not object."</p>

<p>"And if he does?" asked King.</p>

<p>"Let us not think of that," replied Fou-tan.</p>

<p>As the night wore on, a slow rain commenced to fall, herald of
the coming rainy season. King kept the fire replenished, and its
heat warmed them as they sat and talked of their future, or spoke
in half-awed whispers of the transcendent happiness that had come
into their lives.</p>

<p>Before dawn the rain ceased and the skies cleared, and when the
sun rose he looked upon a steaming jungle, where strange odors,
long imprisoned by drought, filled the air as they wandered through
the forest.</p>

<p>King rose and stretched himself. Near him the carcass of the
great beast he had slain aroused within him regret that he must
leave such a trophy to the carrion creatures or to decay.</p>

<p>From the tiger's back protruded the feathered shaft of an arrow.
King was puzzled. He tugged upon the missile and withdrew it. It
was a crude thing&mdash;much more primitive than those made by Che.
It created a mystery that appeared little likely of solution. The
best that he could do was guess that the tiger had carried it for
some time before he attacked them. Then, for the time, he forgot
the matter, which later was to be recalled in poignant grief.</p>

<p>Across the gorge the brute bestirred himself. He had lain
quietly throughout the rain, keeping the spot beneath him dry.
Physical discomfort meant little to him; he was accustomed to it.
He arose, and, like King, stretched himself. Then he crept to the
edge of the gorge and looked down at the man and the woman.</p>

<p>Fou-tan, who had been dozing, awoke now and rose to her feet.
With the undulating grace of youth and health and physical
perfection she came and stood beside King. She leaned close against
the man, who put an arm about her and, bending, kissed her upturned
mouth. The brute moistened his thick lips with a red tongue.</p>

<p>"And now," said King, "I am going up into the forest to get some
more fruit. It will be a light breakfast, but better than none; and
I do not dare build up the fire again by daylight."</p>

<p>"While you are gone I shall bathe myself in the stream," said
Fou-tan; "it will refresh me."</p>

<p>"I am afraid to leave you here alone," said King.</p>

<p>"There is no danger," replied Fou-tan. "The beasts are not
hunting now, and there is little likelihood that the soldiers who
are searching for us have broken camp so early. No, I shall remain
here. Let me have my bath, Gordon King, and do not return too
quickly."</p>

<p>As King walked down the gorge to the place where he could ascend
into the forest, the brute upon the opposite side watched his every
move and then proceeded quickly up the farther bank of the gorge in
the opposite direction from that taken by King. There was no trail
in the jungle that the brute did not know, so that he was aware of
a place where he might easily descend into the gorge a short
distance above the spot where Fou-tan bathed.</p>

<p>The girl wore only two garments beside her sandals&mdash;a
silken sampot and the makeshift sarong&mdash;so that scarcely was
King out of sight before she was splashing in the cold waters of
the stream. The temperature of the water that came down from the
high hills, coupled with her fear that King might return too soon,
prompted her to haste. Having no towel, she used one end of the
sarong to dry herself, adjusted her sampot and wound the sarong
about her lithe body. Then she stood looking down the gorge in the
direction from which King would return. Her heart was filled with
her new happiness, so that it was with difficulty that she
restrained her lips from song.</p>

<p>From up the gorge, behind her, crept the brute. Even if he had
approached noisily, the rushing waters would have drowned the
sound, but it was not the way of the brute to move noisily. Like
the other carnivores, stealth was habitual to him. The brute was
the personification of the cunning and malignity of the tiger; but
there the parallel ceased, for the tiger was beautiful and the
brute was hideous.</p>

<p>It is remarkable that there should be so many more beautiful
creatures in the world than man, which suggests a doubt of man's
boast that he is made in the image of God. There are those who
believe that the image of God must transcend in its beauty the
finite conceptions of man. If that be true and God chose to create
any animal in His own likeness, man must have trailed at the far
end of that celestial beauty contest.</p>

<p>The brute crept stealthily down upon the unsuspecting girl. He
rounded the corner of a cliff and saw her standing with her back
toward him. He moved swiftly now, crouched like a charging tiger,
yet his naked feet gave forth no sound; while Fou-tan, with
half-closed eyes and smiling lips, dreamed of the future that love
held in store.</p>

<p>The brute sprang close behind her. A filthy, calloused paw was
clapped across her mouth. A rough and powerful arm encircled her
waist. She was whirled from her feet, her cries stifled in her
throat, as the brute wheeled and ran swiftly up the gorge, bearing
his prize.</p>

<p>King quickly found the fruit he sought, but he loitered in
returning to give Fou-tan an opportunity to complete her toilet. As
he idled slowly back to the gorge, his mind was occupied with plans
for the future. He was considering the advisability of remaining in
hiding where they were for several days on the chance that the
soldiers of Lodivarman might in the meantime give up the search and
return to Lodidhapura. He determined that they might explore the
gorge further in the hope of finding a safer and more comfortable
retreat, where they might be less at the mercy of night prowlers
and even more securely hidden from searchers than they were at
present. He was also moved by the prospect of a few idyllic days
during which there would be no one in the world but himself and
Fou-tan.</p>

<p>Filled with enthusiasm for his heaven-sent plan, King descended
into the gorge and approached the now hallowed precincts of his
greatest happiness; but as he rounded the last bend he saw that
Fou-tan was not there. Perhaps she had gone farther up the stream
to bathe. He called her name aloud, but there was no reply. Again
he called, raising his voice, but still there was only silence. Now
he became alarmed and, running quickly forward, searched about for
some sign or clue to her whereabouts; nor had he long to search. In
the soft earth, damp from the recent rain, he saw the imprints of a
huge foot&mdash;the great bare foot of a man. He saw where the
prints had stopped and turned, and it was easy to follow them up
the gorge. Casting aside the fruit that he had gathered, he
hastened along the well-marked trail, his mind a fiery furnace of
fear and rage, his heart a cold clod in his leaden breast.</p>

<p>Now, quite suddenly, he recalled the arrow he had found embedded
behind the shoulders of the tiger that he had killed. He recalled
the beast's sudden scream of rage and pain as it had charged so
unexpectedly toward him, and quite accurately he reconstructed the
whole scene&mdash;the man had been spying upon them from the top of
the gorge; he had seen the tiger and had shot it to save his quarry
to himself; then he had waited until King had left Fou-tan alone;
the rest was plainly discernible in the footprints that he
followed. He was confident that this was no soldier of Lodivarman;
the crude arrow refuted that idea, as did the imprints of the great
bare feet. But what sort of man was it and why had he stolen
Fou-tan? The answer to that question goaded King to greater
speed.</p>

<p>A short distance up the gorge King discovered where the tracks
turned to the right, up the bed of a dry wash and thus to the level
of the forest above. He gave thanks now for the providential rain
that rendered the spoor easily followed. He knew that the abductor
could not be far ahead, and he was sure that he could overtake him
before harm could befall Fou-tan. However, as he hastened on, he
was chilled by the thought that no matter how plain the spoor, the
necessity for keeping it always in sight could but retard his
speed; and his fear was that the slight delay might permit the man
to outdistance him; and then he came to a patch of rocky ground
where the trail, becoming immediately faint, suddenly disappeared
entirely. Sick with apprehension, the American was forced to stop
and search for a continuation of the tracks, and when, at last, he
found them he knew that his quarry had gained greatly upon him
during this enforced delay.</p>

<p>Again he sped along as rapidly as he could through a forest
unusually devoid of underbrush. As he advanced he presently became
aware of a new sound mingling with the subdued daylight noises of
the jungle. It was a sound that he could not identify, but there
was something ominous about it; and then, quite suddenly, he came
upon the authors of it&mdash;great grey bulks looming among the
boles of the trees directly in his path.</p>

<p>Under other circumstances he would have halted or, at least,
changed his route; and had he reflected even for an instant, his
better judgment now would have prompted him to do the latter; but
uppermost in his mind and entirely dominating him was the great
fear that he felt for Fou-tan's safety; and when he saw this
obstacle looming menacingly before him, his one thought was to
override it by sheer effrontery that it might not even delay him,
much less thwart him in the pursuit of his object.</p>

<p>Had he been vouchsafed from his insanity even a single brief
moment of lucidity, he would have avoided those ominous bulks
moving restlessly to and fro among the boles of the giant trees,
for even at the best wild elephants are nervous and short-tempered;
and these, obviously disconcerted and suspicious by reason of some
recent occurrences, were in a particularly hysterical and ugly
mood. There were young calves among them and, therefore, watchful
and irritable mothers; while the great bulls, aroused and on guard,
were in no mood to be further provoked.</p>

<p>A huge bull, his ears outspread, his tail erect, wheeled toward
the advancing man. The forest trembled to his mad trumpeting, and
in that instant King realized for the first time the deadly peril
of his position and knew that it would serve Fou-tan nothing were
he to rush headlong into that inevitable death.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch11" id="ch11">XI. &mdash; WARRIORS FROM PNOM
DHEK</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">As the hideous creature bore her on, Fou-tan
struggled to release herself; but she was utterly helpless in the
Herculean grasp of her gigantic captor. She tried to wrench the
creature's hand from her mouth that she might scream a warning to
King, but even in this she was doomed to failure.</p>

<p>The creature had at first been carrying her under one arm, with
her face down; but after he reached the floor of the forest he
swung her lightly up in front of him, carrying her so that she had
a clear view of his face; and at sight of it her heart sank within
her. It was a hideous face, with thick lips and protruding teeth,
great ears that flapped as the creature ran, and a low, receding
forehead hidden by filthy, tangled hair that almost met the bushy,
protruding eyebrows, beneath which gleamed wicked, bloodshot
eyes.</p>

<p>It did not require a second look to convince Fou-tan that she
had fallen into the hands of one of the dread Yeacks.
Notwithstanding the fact that she had never before seen one of
these ogre people, nor had known anyone who had, she was
nevertheless as positive in her identification as though she had
come in daily contact with them all her life, so strongly implanted
in the mind of man are the superstitions of childhood. What else,
indeed, could this creature be but a Yeack?</p>

<p>The horror of her situation was augmented by its contrast to the
happy state from which it had snatched her. Had her Gordon King
been there she would have been sure of rescue, so absolute was her
conviction of his prowess. But how was he to know what had become
of her? Being city-bred, it did not immediately occur to her that
King might follow the tracks of her abductor, and so she was borne
on more deeply into the somber forest without even the slightly
alleviating reassurance of faint hope. She was lost! Of that
Fou-tan was convinced; for was it not well known that the Yeacks
fed upon human flesh?</p>

<p>The brute, sensing muddily that he would be pursued, and having
witnessed something of the prowess of King, did not pause in his
flight but hastened steadily on toward a rocky fastness which he
knew, where one might hide for days or, if discovered, find a cave,
the mouth of which might be easily defended.</p>

<p>As he strode steadily through the forest his keen ears were
presently attracted by a familiar sound, a sound which experience
told him was a warning to change his course. A moment later he saw
the elephants moving slowly across his path toward his left. He had
no wish to dispute the right-of-way with them; so he veered to the
right with the intention of passing behind them. They did not see
him, but they caught his scent spoor, and an old bull left the herd
and came ponderously down toward the point where the brute had
first sighted them. The rest of the herd halted and then followed
the old bull. The scent spoor of the man grated upon the nerves of
the pachyderms. They became restless and irritable, more so because
they could not locate the authors of this disturbing scent.</p>

<p>As the brute moved quickly to the right to circle to the rear of
the herd and resume his interrupted course toward the wild
sanctuary that was his objective, he kept his eyes turned to the
left upon the members of the herd, lest, by chance, one of them
might discover him and charge. A remote possibility, perhaps, but
it is by guarding against remote possibilities that the fittest of
primitive creatures survive. So, because of the fact that his
attention was riveted in one direction, he did not see the danger
approaching from another.</p>

<p>A score of soldiers, their brass cuirasses dulled and tarnished
by the rain and dirt of jungle marches, halted at the sight of the
brute and the burden he bore. A young officer in charge whispered a
few low words of command. The soldiers crept forward, forming a
half-circle as they went, to intercept the brute and his captive.
One of the soldiers stumbled over a branch that had fallen from the
tree above. Instantly the brute wheeled toward them. He saw twenty
well-armed men advancing, their spears menacingly ready; and
responding to the urge of Nature's first law, the brute cast the
girl roughly to the ground and, wheeling, broke for freedom. A
shower of arrows followed him and some of the soldiers would have
pursued, but the officer called them back.</p>

<p>"We have the girl," he said; "let that thing go. We were not
sent out for him. He is not the man who abducted the apsara from
the palace of Lodivarman."</p>

<p>At the moment that the brute had seen the soldiers, so had
Fou-tan; and now she scrambled quickly to her feet, from where he
had hurled her to the ground, and turned in flight back toward the
gorge where she had last seen King.</p>

<p>"After her!" cried the officer; "but do not harm her."</p>

<p>Fou-tan ran fleetly and perhaps would have gotten away from them
had not she tripped and fallen; as she scrambled to her feet, they
were upon her. Rough hands seized her, but they did not harm her,
nor did they offer her insult; for she who was to have been the
favorite of Lodivarman might yet be, and it is not well to incur
the displeasure of a king's favorite.</p>

<p>"Where is the man?" asked the officer, addressing Fou-tan.</p>

<p>The girl thought very quickly in that instant, and there was
apparently no hesitation as she nodded her head in the direction
that the fleeing brute had taken. "You know as well as I do," she
said. "Why did you not capture him?"</p>

<p>"Not that man," said the officer. "I refer to the soldier of the
guard who abducted you from the palace of Lodivarman."</p>

<p>"It was no soldier of the guard who abducted me," replied the
girl. "This creature stole into the palace and seized me. A soldier
of the guard followed us into the jungle and tried to rescue me,
but he failed."</p>

<p>"Lodivarman sent word that it was the strange warrior, Gordon
King, who stole you from the palace," said the officer.</p>

<p>"You saw the creature that stole me," said Fou-tan. "Did it look
like a soldier of Lodivarman?"</p>

<p>"No," admitted the officer, "but where is this Gordon King? He
has disappeared from Lodidhapura."</p>

<p>"I told you that he tried to rescue me," explained Fou-tan. "He
followed us into the jungle. What became of him I do not know.
Perhaps the Yeacks wrought a magic spell that killed him."</p>

<p>"Yeacks!" exclaimed the officer. "What do you mean?"</p>

<p>"Did you not recognize my captor as a Yeack?" asked Fou-tan. "Do
you not know a Yeack when you see one?"</p>

<p>Exclamations arose from the soldiers gathered about them.</p>

<p>"By the gods, it was a Yeack," said one.</p>

<p>"Perhaps there are others about," suggested another.</p>

<p>The men looked about them fearfully.</p>

<p>Fou-tan thought that she saw in their superstitious terror,
which she fully shared herself, a possibility of escape. "The
Yeacks will be angry with you for having taken me from one of their
number," she said. "Doubtless he has gone to summon his fellows.
You had best escape while you can. If you do not take me with you,
they will not follow you."</p>

<p>"By Siva, she is right!" exclaimed a warrior.</p>

<p>"I am not afraid of the Yeacks," said the officer bravely; "but
we have the apsara and there is no reason why we should remain
here longer. Come!" He took Fou-tan gently by the arm.</p>

<p>"If you take me they will follow you," she said. "You had better
leave me here."</p>

<p>"Yes, leave her here," grumbled some of the warriors.</p>

<p>"We shall take the girl with us," said the officer. "I may
escape the wrath of the Yeacks, but if I return to Lodidhapura
without the apsara I shall not escape the wrath of Lodivarman,"
and he gave the command to form for the march.</p>

<p>As the party moved away down toward the trail that leads to
Lodidhapura, many were the nervous glances that the warriors cast
behind them. There was much muttering and grumbling, and it was
apparent that they did not relish being the escort of a recaptured
prisoner of the Yeacks. Fou-tan fed their fears and their
dissatisfaction by constant reference to the vengeance that would
fall upon them in some form when the Yeacks should overtake
them.</p>

<p>"You are very foolish to risk your life needlessly," she told
the young officer. "If you leave me here you will be safe from the
Yeacks, and no one in Lodidhapura need know that you have found
me."</p>

<p>"Why should you wish to remain and become the victim of the
Yeacks?" demanded the officer.</p>

<p>"It makes no difference whether you are with me or not,"
insisted Fou-tan. "The Yeacks will get me again. In some form they
will come and take me. If you are with me they will slay you
all."</p>

<p>"But there is a chance that we may escape them and get back to
Lodidhapura," insisted the officer.</p>

<p>"I would rather remain with the Yeacks than go back to
Lodivarman," said the girl. But in her breast was the hope that she
could find Gordon King before the Yeacks overtook her; and,
notwithstanding her superstitious fear of them, so great was her
faith in the prowess of her man that she had no doubt but that he
could overcome them.</p>

<p>Her arguments, however, were unavailing. She could not swerve
the young officer from his determination to take her back to
Lodidhapura. From the first however, it was apparent that the
common soldiers were less enthusiastic about her company. The
warriors of Pnom Dhek they could face with courage, or the charge
of My Lord the Tiger, but contemplation of the supernatural powers
of the mythological Yeacks filled their superstitious breasts with
naught but terror. There were those among them who even discussed
the advisability of murdering the officer, abandoning the girl, and
returning to Lodidhapura with some plausible explanation, which
their encounter with the Yeack readily suggested; but none of these
things were they destined to do.</p>

<p>As King saw the great elephant advancing toward him he became
seriously alive to the danger of his situation. He looked hurriedly
about him, searching for an avenue of escape, but nowhere near was
there a single tree of sufficient size to have withstood the
titanic strength of the great bull should he have elected to fell
it. To face the bull or to attempt to escape by running seemed
equally futile; yet it was the latter alternative which commended
itself to him as being the less suicidal.</p>

<p>But just then something happened. The bull stopped in his
advance and looked suddenly toward his left. His trumpeting ceased,
and then most unexpectedly he wheeled about and bolted directly
away from King to be immediately followed by the entire herd, which
went crashing through the jungle, bowling over trees in their mad
progress until finally they disappeared from view.</p>

<p>With a sigh of relief King took up his interrupted pursuit,
following in the wake of the elephants, which had disappeared in
the direction taken by the abductor of Fou-tan. What had brought
about the sudden change in the attitude of the bull King could not
guess, nor did he ever discover. He attributed it to the mental
vagaries of a naturally timid and nervous animal. He did not know
that a changing breeze had brought to the nostrils of the pachyderm
the scent spoor of many men&mdash;the soldiers of
Lodivarman&mdash;nor was the matter of any particular importance to
King, whose mind was occupied now with something of far greater
moment. The stampeding elephants had entirely obliterated the
tracks that King had been following, and this it was that gave him
the greatest concern. It seemed that everything militated against
the success of his pursuit. He zigzagged to the right and left of
the elephant tracks in the hope of picking up the footprints of the
fleeing man. When he had about abandoned hope, he saw in the soft
earth a single familiar spoor&mdash;the imprint of a great flat
foot. By what seemed little less than a miracle this single
tell-tale clue had escaped the rushing feet of the herd. It pointed
on in the direction that King had been going; and, with renewed
hope, he hurried forward.</p>

<p>Among fallen trees, bowled over by the terrified elephants, King
pursued his quarry until he was brought to a sudden stop by a
tragic tableau of the jungle that instantly filled him with dire
misgiving. A short distance ahead of him lay a man pinioned to the
earth by a small tree that had fallen across his legs. Facing the
man, crouching belly to the ground, advancing slowly inch by inch,
was a great leopard. The man was helpless. In another instant the
cat would be upon him, rending and tearing. Naturally the first
thought that entered King's head was that this was the man who had
abducted Fou-tan, and, if so, where was the girl? Until that
question was answered the man must not die.</p>

<p>With a cry of warning intended to distract the attention of the
leopard, King sprang forward, simultaneously fitting an arrow to
his bow. The leopard leaped to its feet. For an instant it stood
glaring menacingly at the advancing man; and seeing it hesitate,
King did not launch his shaft, for he saw now that he might come
within effective spear range of the beast before it charged; and he
guessed that an arrow might only serve to infuriate it.</p>

<p>Disconcerted by this unexpected interference with its plans and
with the interloper's bold advance, the brute hesitated a moment
and then, wheeling, bounded off into the jungle.</p>

<p>The man lying upon the ground had been a witness to all this. He
was saved from the leopard, but he looked apprehensively at King as
the latter stopped beside him, for he recognized the newcomer as
the man from whom he had stolen the girl. If he had any doubts as
to the other's awareness of his guilt, it was dissipated by King's
first words.</p>

<p>"Where is the girl?" demanded the American.</p>

<p>"The soldiers took her from me," replied the brute sullenly.</p>

<p>"What soldiers?"</p>

<p>"They were soldiers from Lodidhapura," replied the other.</p>

<p>"I believe that you are lying," said King, "and I ought to kill
you." He raised his spear.</p>

<p>The brute did not wish to die. He had lost the girl, but he did
not wish to lose his life also; and now, with effort, spurred by
the desire to live, his brain gave birth to a simple idea. "You
have saved my life," he said. "If you will raise this tree from my
legs, I will help you to find the girl and take her away from the
soldiers. That I will do if you do not kill me."</p>

<p>The man's spear had fallen beside him. As King considered the
proposition he recovered the weapon and then took the bow and
arrows from the man also.</p>

<p>"Why do you do that?" asked the brute.</p>

<p>"So that if I decide to release you, you may not be tempted to
kill me," replied King.</p>

<p>"Very well," replied the brute, "but I shall not try to kill
you." King stooped and seized the bole of the tree. It was not a
very large tree, but it had fallen in such a way that the man,
unassisted, could not have released himself; and as King raised it,
the brute drew his legs from beneath it.</p>

<p>"Any bones broken?" asked King.</p>

<p>The brute rose slowly to his feet. "No," he said.</p>

<p>"Then let's be on our way," urged King. "We have no time to
lose."</p>

<p>As the two men set out King walked a little in the rear of the
other. He had been impressed from the first by the savage
bestiality of his companion's face and now by his tremendous size.
His huge, drooped shoulders and his long arms seemed capable of the
most titanic feats of strength; yet the creature, who seemingly
could have slain him as easily without weapons as with, led
docilely on, until at last King was convinced that the fellow
contemplated no treachery, but would carry out his part of the
bargain with simple-minded loyalty.</p>

<p>"Who are you?" demanded King after they had walked in silence
for a considerable distance.</p>

<p>"I am Prang," replied the brute.</p>

<p>"What were you doing out here in the jungle?" asked King.</p>

<p>"I live here," replied the brute.</p>

<p>"Where?"</p>

<p>"Anywhere," replied Prang with a broad gesture.</p>

<p>"Where are your people?" asked King.</p>

<p>"I have none; I live alone."</p>

<p>"Have you always lived in the jungle?"</p>

<p>"Not always, but for a long time."</p>

<p>"Where did you come from?"</p>

<p>"From Pnom Dhek."</p>

<p>"Then you are a runaway slave?" asked King.</p>

<p>The brute nodded his head. "But you need not try to return me.
If you did that I should kill you."</p>

<p>"I do not intend to try to return you to Pnom Dhek. I am not
from Pnom Dhek."</p>

<p>"Yes, I knew that from your armor," said the brute. "You are
from Lodidhapura. You stole the girl and they sent soldiers after
you. Is that not true?"</p>

<p>"Yes," replied King.</p>

<p>"It may be hard to take the girl away from the soldiers of
Lodidhapura," said Prang. "We cannot do it by day, for they are
many and we are few; but we can find them and follow them; and at
night, perhaps, you can sneak into their camp and steal the girl,
if she will come with you willingly."</p>

<p>"She will," said King; and then: "How long have you lived alone
in the jungle, Prang?"</p>

<p>"I ran away when I was a boy. Many rains have come since then. I
do not know how many, but it has been a long time."</p>

<p>As Prang led on through the jungle they conversed but little;
enough, however, to assure King that the great, hulking brute had
the mind of a little child, and as long as King did nothing to
arouse his suspicions or his fears he would be quite docile and
tractable. King noticed that Prang was not leading him back over
the same route that they had come, and when he asked the man why
they were going in a different direction, Prang explained that he
knew the trail that the warriors would take in returning to
Lodidhapura and that this was a short-cut to it.</p>

<p>In places the jungle was quite open and covered with tall, dry
elephant grass, which, growing higher than their heads, obstructed
their view in all directions, while the rustling of its leaves as
they pushed their way through it drowned all other sounds. At such
times King always felt particularly helpless and was relieved each
time they emerged from the stifling embrace of the tall grasses;
but Prang seemed not at all concerned, although he was walking
almost naked and unarmed.</p>

<p>They had passed through a particularly long stretch of elephant
grass when they emerged into a clearing entirely destitute of
either grass or trees. Beyond the clearing, in front of them, they
could see the forest at no great distance, but there was still a
narrow belt of elephant grass which they must pass through before
they reached the trees.</p>

<p>When they had advanced almost to the center of this clearing,
simultaneously their attention was attracted to a movement among
the grasses ahead and to the left of them, and almost at the same
moment a cuirassed soldier stepped into view, to be followed
immediately by others. At the first glance King recognized that
these men were not soldiers from Lodidhapura, for though their
armour and harness were similar, they were not identical, and their
helmets were of an entirely different pattern from that which he
wore. At sight of them Prang halted, then he turned and started to
run back in the direction from which they had come. "Run!" he
cried, "They are warriors from Pnom Dhek."</p>

<p>Instantly King realized that these newcomers might prove to be
Fou-tan's salvation if he could guide them to her, but without
Prang that might be impossible, and therefore he turned and pursued
the fleeing brute. Into the tall elephant grasses, close upon his
heels, ran King. "Stop!" commanded the white man.</p>

<p>"Never!" screamed Prang. "They will take me back into slavery.
Do not try to stop me, or I shall kill you." But the capture of
Prang meant more to Gordon King than his life, and so he only
redoubled his efforts to gain upon the fleeing man. Gradually he
crept up upon him until at last he was within reach.</p>

<p>How futile it seemed to attempt to seize that mountain of muscle
and bone, yet if he could detain him even momentarily he was
positive that the soldiers would overtake them, for at the instant
that they had turned to flee he had seen the soldiers from Pnom
Dhek start in pursuit.</p>

<p>In King's experience he had learned but one way to stop a
fleeing man without maiming or killing him, which he had no desire
to do, although he held in his hands lethal weapons with which he
might easily have brought down his quarry; and so he threw aside
the spear that he carried and launched himself at the great legs of
Prang. It was a noble tackle, and it brought Prang to earth with a
resounding crash that almost knocked the wind out of him.</p>

<p>"Hurry!" yelled King to the soldiers of Pnom Dhek. "I have him!"
He heard the warriors crashing through the dry grasses behind
him.</p>

<p>"Let me go," cried the struggling Prang. "Let me go or they will
take me back into slavery." But King clung to him in desperation,
though it was much like attempting to cling to the business end of
a mule, so mighty and vigorous were the kicks of Prang; and then
the soldiers of Pnom Dhek arrived and fell upon both of them
impartially.</p>

<p>"Don't kill him!" cried King as he saw the menacing spears of
the warriors. "Wait until you hear me."</p>

<p>"Who are you?" demanded an officer. "What does this all mean? We
saw you in company with this fellow; and now, though you are a
soldier of Lodivarman, you turn upon your companion and capture him
for us. What does it mean?"</p>

<p>"It is a long story," said King, "and there is no time for
explanations now. Somewhere ahead of us there is a girl from Pnom
Dhek whom I helped to escape from Lodidhapura. She has just been
recaptured by some of Lodivarman's warriors. This man was guiding
me to her. Will you help me to rescue this girl?"</p>

<p>"You are trying to lead me into a trap," said the officer
suspiciously. "I do not believe that there is any girl."</p>

<p>"Yes, there is a girl," said Prang.</p>

<p>"Her name is Fou-tan," said King.</p>

<p>Interest was immediately evident in the eyes of the officer and
excitement in the attitude of his men. "I will go with you," said
the officer. "If you have lied to me and this is indeed a trap, you
shall die at the first indication of treachery."</p>

<p>"I am content," said King; "but there is one more condition. I
cannot lead you to the girl; but this man says that he can, and I
know that he will do it willingly and quickly if you will promise
him his freedom in return for his assistance."</p>

<p>A sudden gleam of hope shone in Prang's eyes as he heard King's
words; and he looked up expectantly at the officer, awaiting his
reply.</p>

<p>"Certainly," said the latter. "If he leads us to Fou-tan, he
shall have not only his liberty but any other reward that he may
desire. I can promise him that."</p>

<p>"I wish only my freedom," said Prang.</p>

<p>"Lead on, then," said the officer. And then as the march started
he detailed two warriors to remain constantly at Prang's side and
two with King, and these warriors he instructed to kill their
charges at the first indication of treachery.</p>

<p>Evidently interested in King, the officer walked beside him. It
was apparent that he had noticed the lack of physical resemblance
to the Khmers and his curiosity was aroused. "You do not greatly
resemble the men of Lodidhapura," he said finally.</p>

<p>"I am not of Lodidhapura," said King.</p>

<p>"But you are in the armour of Lodivarman's warriors," insisted
the officer.</p>

<p>"I am from a far country," explained King. "Lost in the jungle,
I was taken prisoner by Lodivarman's warriors. I pleased the King,
and he gave me service in the royal guard."</p>

<p>"But how is it, then, that you are befriending a girl from Pnom
Dhek?"</p>

<p>"That, as I told you, is a long story," said King, "but when we
have found her she will corroborate all that I have said. I was
forced into the service of Lodivarman. I owe him no loyalty, and
should I fall into his hands again I can expect no mercy.
Therefore, it had been my intention, when I reached Pnom Dhek with
Fou-tan, to seek service in your army."</p>

<p>"If you have befriended Fou-tan, your petition will not go
unheeded," said the officer.</p>

<p>"You have heard of her, then?" asked King.</p>

<p>The officer gave the American a long, searching look before he
replied. "Yes," he said.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch12" id="ch12">XII. &mdash; GUEST AND PRISONER</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">The captors of Fou-tan were exerting no effort to
make haste. For almost two days they had been marching rapidly
through the jungle, searching for a clue to the whereabouts of
Fou-tan and her escort; and now that they had found her, they were
taking it easy, moving slowly toward the spot where they were to
camp for the night. Knowing nothing of the presence of the soldiers
of Beng Kher of Pnom Dhek, they anticipated no pursuit. Their
conversation was often filled with conjecture as to the identity of
Fou-Tan's companion. Some of them insisted that the Yeack and King
were one and the same.</p>

<p>"I always knew that there was something wrong with the fellow,"
opined a warrior; "there was a peculiar look about him. He was no
Khmer; nor was he of any race of mortal men."</p>

<p>"Perhaps he was a Naga, who took the form first of a man and
then changed himself into a Yeack," suggested another.</p>

<p>"I think that he was a Yeack all along," said another, "and that
he took the form of man only to deceive us, that he might enter the
palace of Lodivarman and steal the girl."</p>

<p>It was while they were discussing this matter that a warrior
marching at the rear of the column was attracted by a noise behind
him. Turning his head to look, he gave a sudden cry of alarm, for
in their rear, creeping upon them, he saw the brute and a body of
soldiers.</p>

<p>"The Yeacks are coming!" he cried.</p>

<p>The others turned quickly at his warning cry. "I told you so,"
screamed one. "The Yeack has brought his fellows."</p>

<p>"Those are soldiers of Pnom Dhek," cried the officer. "Form line
and advance upon them. Let it not be said that men of Lodidhapura
fled from the warriors of Beng Kher."</p>

<p>"They are Yeacks who have taken the form of soldiers of Pnom
Dhek," cried a warrior. "Mortals cannot contend against them," and
with that he threw down his spear and fled.</p>

<p>At the same instant the soldiers of Pnom Dhek leaped forward,
shouting their war-cry.</p>

<p>The defection of the single Lodidhapurian warrior was all that
had been needed to ignite the smoldering embers of discontent and
mutiny already fully fed by their superstitious fears. To a man,
the common soldiers turned and ran, leaving their officer and
Fou-tan alone. For an instant the man stood his ground and then,
evidently realizing the hopelessness of his position, he, too,
wheeled and followed his retreating men at top speed.</p>

<p>What Fou-tan's feelings must have been, it was difficult to
imagine. Here, suddenly and entirely without warning, appeared a
company of soldiers from her native city, and with them were the
horrid Yeack that had stolen her away from King and also Gordon
King himself. For a moment she stood in mute and wide-eyed
wonderment as the men approached her, and then she turned to the
man she loved. "Gordon King," she said, "I knew that you would
come."</p>

<p>The soldiers of Pnom Dhek gathered around her, the common
warriors keeping at a respectful distance, while the officer
approached and, kneeling, kissed her hand.</p>

<p>King was not a little puzzled for an explanation of the evident
respect in which they held her, but then he realized that he was
not familiar with the customs of the country. He was aware,
however, that the apsaras, or dancing girls of the temples, were
held in considerable veneration because of the ritualistic nature
of their dances, which identified them closely with the religious
life of the nation and rendered them, in a way, the particular
wards of the gods.</p>

<p>The officer questioned her briefly and respectfully; and, having
thus assured himself of King's loyalty and integrity, his attitude
toward the American changed from suspicion to cordiality.</p>

<p>To Fou-tan's questions relative to Prang, King explained by
telling the story of the brute as he had had it from his own lips;
yet it was evidently most difficult for Fou-tan to relinquish her
conviction that the creature was a Yeack; nor could any other have
assured her of Prang's prosaic status than Gordon King, in whose
lightest words she beheld both truth and authority.</p>

<p>"Now that I have led you to the girl," said Prang, addressing
the officer, "give me the liberty that you promised me."</p>

<p>"It is yours," said the officer; "but if you wish to return and
live in Pnom Dhek I can promise you that the King will make you a
free man."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Fou-tan, "and you shall have food and clothing as
long as you live."</p>

<p>The brute shook his head. "No," he said. "I am afraid of the
city. Let me stay in the jungle, where I am safe. Give me back my
weapons and let me go."</p>

<p>They did as he requested, and a moment later Prang slouched off
into the forest soon to be lost to their view, choosing the freedom
of the jungle to the luxuries of the city.</p>

<p>Once again the march was resumed, this time in the direction of
Pnom Dhek. As Fou-tan and King walked side by side the girl said to
him in a low voice, "Do not let them know yet of our love. First, I
must win my father, and after that the whole world may know."</p>

<p>All during the long march King was again and again impressed by
the marked deference accorded Fou-tan. It was so noticeable that
the natural little familiarities of their own comradeship took on
the formidable aspects of sacrilege by comparison. To King's
western mind it seemed strange that so much respect should be paid
to a temple dancing girl; but he was glad that it was so, for in
his heart he knew that whatever reverence they showed Fou-tan she
deserved, because of the graces of her character and the purity of
her soul.</p>

<p>The long march to Pnom Dhek was uneventful, and near the close
of the second day the walls of the city rose before them across a
clearing as they emerged from the forest. In outward appearance
Pnom Dhek was similar to Lodidhapura. Its majestic piles of masonry
arose in stately grandeur above the jungle. Its ornate towers and
splendid temples bore witness to the wealth and culture of its
builders, and over all was the same indefinable suggestion of
antiquity. Pnom Dhek was a living city, yet so softened and
mellowed by the passing centuries that even in life it suggested
more the reincarnation of ancient glories than an actuality of the
present.</p>

<p>"Pnom Dhek!" whispered Fou-tan, and in her tone there were love
and reverence.</p>

<p>"You are glad to get back?" asked King.</p>

<p>"That can scarcely express what I feel," replied the girl. "I
doubt if you can realize what Pnom Dhek means to one of her sons or
daughters; and so, too, you cannot guess the gratitude that I feel
to you, Gordon King, who alone are responsible for my return."</p>

<p>He looked at her for a moment in silence. As she stood devouring
Pnom Dhek with her eyes there was a rapturous exaltation in her
gaze that suggested the fervor of religious passion, and the
thought gave him pause.</p>

<p>"Perhaps, Fou-tan," he suggested, "you have mistaken gratitude
for love."</p>

<p>She looked up at him quickly. "You do not understand, Gordon
King," she said. "For two thousand years love for Pnom Dhek has
been bred into the blood that animates me. It is a part of me that
can die only when I die; yet I could never see Pnom Dhek again and
yet be happy; though should I never see you again, I might never be
happy again even in Pnom Dhek. Now do you understand?"</p>

<p>"That I was jealous of stone and wood shows how much I love you,
Fou-tan," he said.</p>

<p>A soldier, lightened of his cuirass and weapons, had run swiftly
ahead to the city gates, which they were approaching, to announce
their coming; and presently there was a blare of trumpets at the
gate, and this was answered by the sound of other trumpets within
the city and the deep booming of gongs and the ringing of bells
until the whole city was alive with noise. Then once again was King
mystified; but there was more to come.</p>

<p>As they moved slowly now along the avenue toward the city gates,
a company of soldiers emerged and behind them a file of elephants,
gaudily trapped, and surging forward upon either side of these were
people&mdash;men, women and children&mdash;shouting and singing,
until from hundreds their numbers grew to thousands. So quickly had
they gathered that it seemed as much a miracle to King as did the
occasion for their rejoicing, and now he became convinced that
Fou-tan must be a priestess at least, if all this rejoicing and
pandemonium were in honor of her return.</p>

<p>The populace, outstripping the soldiers, were the first to reach
them. Quickly the warriors that composed their escort formed a ring
about Fou-tan and King, but the people held their distance
respectfully, and now out of the babel of voices King caught some
of the words of their greeting&mdash;words that filled him with
surprise.</p>

<p>"Fou-tan! Fou-tan!" they cried. "Welcome to our beloved Princess
that was lost and is found again!"</p>

<p>King turned to the girl. "Princess!" he exclaimed. "You did not
tell me, Fou-tan."</p>

<p>"Many men have courted me because I am a princess," she said.
"You loved me for myself alone, and I wanted to cling to that as
long as I might."</p>

<p>"And Beng Kher is your father?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Yes, I am the daughter of the King," replied Fou-tan.</p>

<p>"I am glad that I did not know," said King simply.</p>

<p>"And so am I," replied the girl, "for now no one can ever make
me doubt your love."</p>

<p>"I wish that you were not a princess," he said in a troubled
voice.</p>

<p>"Why?" she demanded.</p>

<p>"None would have objected had the slave girl wished to marry
me," he said, "but I can well imagine that many will object to a
nameless warrior taking the Princess of Pnom Dhek."</p>

<p>"Perhaps," she said sadly, "but let us not think of that
now."</p>

<p>In the howdah of the leading elephant sat a large, stern-faced
man, beneath a parasol of cloth of gold and red. When the elephant
upon which he rode was stopped near them, ladder-like steps were
brought from the back of an elephant in the rear and the man
descended to the ground, while the people prostrated themselves and
touched their foreheads to the earth. As the man approached,
Fou-tan advanced to meet him, and when she was directly in front of
him, she kneeled and took his hand. There was moisture in the man's
stern eyes as he lifted the girl to her feet and took her into his
arms. It was Beng Kher the King, father of Fou-tan.</p>

<p>After the first greeting Fou-tan whispered a few words to Beng
Kher, and immediately Beng Kher directed Gordon King to advance.
Following Fou-tan's example, the American knelt and kissed the
King's hand. "Arise!" said Beng Kher. "My daughter, the Princess,
tells me that it is to you she owes her escape from Lodidhapura.
You shall be suitably rewarded. You shall know the gratitude of
Beng Kher." He signalled to one of his retinue that had descended
from the elephant in his rear. "See that this brave warrior lacks
for nothing," he said. "Later we shall summon him to our presence
again."</p>

<p>Once more did Fou-tan whisper a few low words to her father, the
King.</p>

<p>The King knit his brows as though he were not entirely pleased
with whatever suggestion Fou-tan had made, but presently the lines
of his face softened and again he turned to the official to whom he
had just spoken. "You will conduct the warrior to the palace and
accord him all honor, for he is to be the guest of Beng Kher."
Then, with Fou-tan, he ascended into the howdah of the royal
elephant, while the officer, whom he had designated to escort
Gordon King, approached the American.</p>

<p>King's first impression of the man was not a pleasant one.</p>

<p>The fellow's face was coarse and sensual and his manner haughty
and supercilious. He made no attempt to conceal his disgust as his
eyes appraised the soiled and tarnished raiment of the common
warrior before him. "Follow me, my man," he said. "The King has
condescended to command that you be quartered in the palace," and
without further words of greeting he turned and strode toward the
elephant upon which he had ridden from the city.</p>

<p>In the howdah with them were two other gorgeously dressed
officials and a slave who held a great parasol over them all. With
no consideration for his feelings and quite as though he had not
been present, King's companions discussed the impropriety of
inviting a common soldier to the palace. Suddenly his escort turned
toward him. "What is your name, my man?" he demanded,
arrogantly.</p>

<p>"My name is Gordon King," replied the American; "but I am not
your man." His voice was low and even and his level gaze was
directed straight into the eyes of the officer.</p>

<p>The man's eyes shifted and then he flushed and scowled. "Perhaps
you do not know," he said, "that I am the prince, Bharata Rahon."
His tone was supercilious, his voice unpleasant.</p>

<p>"Yes?" inquired King politely. So this was Bharata
Rahon&mdash;this was the man whom Beng Kher had selected as the
husband of Fou-tan. "No wonder she ran away and hid in the jungle,"
murmured King.</p>

<p>"What is that?" demanded Bharata Rahon. "What did you say?"</p>

<p>"I am sure," said King, "that the noble prince would not be
interested in anything a common warrior might say."</p>

<p>Bharata Rahon grunted and the conversation ended; nor did either
address the other again as the procession wound its way through the
avenues of Pnom Dhek toward the palace of the King. The way was
lined with cheering people, and strongly apparent to King was the
sincerity of their welcome to Fou-tan and the reality of their
happiness that she had been returned to them.</p>

<p>The palace of Beng Kher was a low rambling building covering a
considerable area. Its central portion had evidently been conceived
as a harmonious unit, to which various kings had added without much
attention to harmony; yet the whole was rather impressive and was
much larger than the palace of Lodivarman. The grounds surrounding
it were beautifully planted and maintained with meticulous care.
The gate through which they passed into the royal enclosure was of
great size and had evidently been designed to permit the easy
passage of a column of elephants, two abreast.</p>

<p>The avenue from the gate led straight between old trees to the
main entrance to the palace, and here the party descended from
their howdahs and followed in the train of Beng Kher and Fou-tan as
they entered the palace amidst such pomp and ceremony as King never
before had witnessed. It occurred to him that if such things must
follow the comings and goings of kings, the glory of sovereignty
had decided drawbacks. There were at least two hundred soldiers,
functionaries, courtiers, priests, and slaves occupied with the
ceremony of receiving the King and the Princess into the palace,
and with such mechanical accuracy did they take their posts and
perform their parts that it was readily apparent to the American
that they were observing a formal custom to which they had become
accustomed by long and continued usage.</p>

<p>Down a long corridor, those in the royal party followed Beng
Kher and Fou-tan to a large audience chamber, where the King
dismissed them. Then he passed on through a doorway with Fou-tan;
and when the door closed behind them, most of the party immediately
dispersed.</p>

<p>Bharata Rahon beckoned King to follow him and, conducting him to
another part of the palace, led him into a room which was one of a
suite of three.</p>

<p>"Here are your quarters," said Bharata Rahon. "I shall send
slaves with apparel more suitable for the guest of Beng Kher. Food
will be served to you here. Do not leave the apartment until you
receive instructions from the King or from me."</p>

<p>"I thought that I was a guest," said King, "but it appears that
I am a prisoner."</p>

<p>"That is as the King wills," replied the prince. "You should be
more grateful, fellow, for the favors that you already have
received."</p>

<p>"Phew!" exclaimed King as Bharata Rahon left the room. "It is
certainly a relief to get rid of you. The more I see of you the
easier it is to understand how Fou-tan preferred My Lord the Tiger
to Prince Bharata Rahon."</p>

<p>As King examined the rooms assigned to him, he saw that they
overlooked the royal garden at a particularly beautiful spot; nor
could he wonder now why Fou-tan loved her home.</p>

<p>His reveries were interrupted by the coming of two slaves; one
carried warm water for a bath, and the other raiment suitable for a
king's guest. They told him that they had been assigned to serve
him while he remained in the palace and that one of them would
always be in attendance, remaining in the corridor outside his
door. The water, which was contained in two earthen vessels and
supported at the ends of a pole that one of the slaves carried
across his shoulders, was taken to the innermost of the three rooms
and deposited beside a huge earthen bowl that was so large that a
man might sit down inside it. Towels and brushes were brought and
other necessary requisites of the toilet.</p>

<p>King stripped and entered the bowl, and then one of the slaves
poured water over him while the other scrubbed him vigorously with
two brushes. It was, indeed, a heroic bath, but it left King
stimulated and exhilarated and much refreshed after his tiresome
journey.</p>

<p>The scrubbing completed to their satisfaction, they bade him
step out of the bowl on to a soft rug, where they oiled his body
from head to foot and then proceeded to rub his skin vigorously
until all of the oil had disappeared. Following this, they anointed
him with some sweet-smelling lotion; and while the water-carrier
emptied the bowl and carried the bath water away, the other slave
assisted King as he donned his new clothing.</p>

<p>"I am Hamar," whispered the fellow after the other slave had
left the apartment. "I belong to Fou-tan, who trusts me. She sent
this to you as a sign that you may trust me also."</p>

<p>He handed King a tiny ring, a beautiful example of the
goldsmith's art. It was strung upon a golden chain. "Wear it about
your neck," said Hamar. "It will take you in safety many places in
Pnom Dhek. Only the King's authority is greater than this."</p>

<p>"Did she send no message?" asked King.</p>

<p>"She said to tell you that all was not as favorable as she had
hoped, but to be of good heart."</p>

<p>"Convey my thanks to her if you can," said King, "and tell her
that her message and her gift have cheered me."</p>

<p>The other slave returned now, and as King had no further need of
them, he dismissed them both.</p>

<p>The two had scarcely departed when a young man entered,
resplendent in the rich trappings of an officer.</p>

<p>"I am Indra Sen," announced the new-comer. "Bharata Rahon has
sent me to see that you do not lack for entertainment in the palace
of Beng Kher."</p>

<p>"Bharata Rahon did not seem to relish the idea of entertaining a
common warrior," said King with a smile.</p>

<p>"No," replied the young man. "Bharata Rahon is like that.
Sometimes he puts on such airs that one might think him the King
himself. Indeed, he has hopes some day of becoming king, for it is
said that Beng Kher would marry Fou-tan to him, and as Beng Kher
has no son, Fou-tan and Bharata Rahon would rule after Beng Kher
died, which may the gods forbid."</p>

<p>"Forbid that Beng Kher die?" asked King; "or that Fou-tan and
Bharata Rahon rule?"</p>

<p>"There is none but would serve Fou-tan loyally and gladly,"
replied Indra Sen; "but there is none who likes Bharata Rahon, and
it is feared that as Fou-tan's husband he might influence her to do
things which she would not otherwise do."</p>

<p>"It is strange," said King, "that Beng Kher has no son in a land
where a king takes many wives."</p>

<p>"He has many sons," replied Indra Sen, "but the son of a
concubine may not become king. Beng Kher would take but one queen,
and when she died he would have no other."</p>

<p>"If Fou-tan had not been found and Beng Kher had died, would
Bharata Rahon have become king?" asked the American.</p>

<p>"In that event the princes would have chosen a new king, but it
would not have been Bharata Rahon," replied the officer.</p>

<p>"Then his only hope of becoming king is by marrying
Fou-tan?"</p>

<p>"That is his only hope."</p>

<p>"And Beng Kher favors his suit?" continued King.</p>

<p>"The man seems to exercise some strange influence over Beng
Kher," explained Indra Sen. "The King's heart is set upon wedding
Fou-tan to him, and because the King is growing old he would have
this matter settled quickly. It is well known that Fou-tan objects.
She does not want to marry Bharata Rahon, but though the King
indulges her in every other whim, he is adamant in this matter.
Once Fou-tan ran away into the jungle to escape the marriage; and
no one knows yet what the outcome will be, for our little princess,
Fou-tan, has a will and a mind of her own; but the King&mdash;well,
he is the King."</p>

<p>For three days Indra Sen performed the duties of a host. He
conducted King about the palace grounds; he took him to the temples
and out into the city, to the market place, and the bazaars.
Together they watched the apsaras dance in the temple court; but
during all this time King saw nothing of Fou-tan, nor did Beng Kher
send for him. Twice he had received brief messages from Fou-tan
through Hamar, but they were only such messages as might be
transmitted by word of mouth through a slave and were far from
satisfying the man's longing for his sweetheart.</p>

<p>Upon the fourth day Indra Sen did not come, as was his custom,
early in the morning; nor did Hamar appear, but only the other
slave&mdash;an ignorant, taciturn man whom King never had been able
to engage in conversation.</p>

<p>King had never left his apartment except in the company of Indra
Sen, and while Bharata Rahon had warned him against any such
independent excursion the American had not taken the suggestion
seriously, believing it to have been animated solely by the choler
of the Khmer prince. Heretofore, Indra Sen had arrived before there
might be any occasion for King to wish to venture forth alone; but
there had never been anything in the attitude of the young officer
to indicate that the American was other than an honored guest, nor
had there been any reason to believe that he might not come and go
as he chose. Having waited, therefore, for a considerable time upon
Indra Sen on this particular morning, King decided to walk out into
the royal garden after leaving word with the slave, who always
attended just outside his door, that the young officer, when he
came, might find him there; but when he opened the door into the
corridor there was no slave, but, instead, two burly warriors, who
instantly turned and barred the exit with their spears.</p>

<p>"You may not leave your quarters," said one of them gruffly and
with a finality that seemed to preclude argument.</p>

<p>"And why not?" demanded the American. "I am the King's guest and
I only wish to walk in the garden."</p>

<p>"We have received our orders," replied the warrior. "You are not
permitted to leave your quarters."</p>

<p>"Then it would appear that I am not the King's guest, but the
King's prisoner."</p>

<p>The warrior shrugged. "We have our orders," he said; "other than
this we know nothing."</p>

<p>The American turned back into the room and closed the door. What
did it all mean? He crossed the apartment to one of the windows and
stood looking out upon the garden. He rehearsed his every act and
speech since he had entered Pnom Dhek, searching for some clue that
might explain the change of attitude toward him; but he found
nothing that might warrant it; and so he concluded that it was the
result of something that had occurred of which he had no knowledge;
but the natural inference was that it was closely allied to his
love for Fou-tan and Beng Kher's determination that she should wed
Bharata Rahon.</p>

<p>The day wore on. The taciturn slave came with food, but Hamar
did not appear; nor did Indra Sen. King paced his quarters like a
caged tiger. Always the windows overlooking the garden attracted
him, so that often he paused before them, drawn by the freedom
which the garden suggested in contrast to the narrow confines of
his quarters. For the thousandth time he examined the quarters that
had now become his prison. The paintings and hangings that covered
the leaden walls had always aroused his interest and curiosity; but
today, by reason of constant association, he found them palling
upon him. The familiar scenes depicting the activities of kings and
priests and dancing girls, the stiffly delineated warriors whose
spears never cast and whose bolts were never shot oppressed him
now. Their actions for ever inhibited and imprisoned in the
artist's paint suggested his own helpless state of
imprisonment.</p>

<p>The sun was sinking in the west; the long shadows of the parting
day were creeping across the royal garden of Beng Kher; the
taciturn slave had come with food and had lighted lamps in each of
the three rooms of his apartment&mdash;crude wick floating in oil
they were, but they served to dispel the darkness of descending
night. King, vibrant with the vitality of youth and health, had
eaten heartily. The slave removed the dishes and returned.</p>

<p>"Have you further commands for the night, master?" he asked.</p>

<p>King shook his head. "No," he said, "you need not return until
the morning."</p>

<p>The slave withdrew, and King fell to playing with an idea that
had been slowly forming in his mind. The sudden change in his
status here that had been suggested by the absence of Hamar and
Indra Sen and by the presence of the warriors in the corridor had
aroused within him a natural apprehension of impending danger, and
consequently directed his mind toward thoughts of escape.</p>

<p>The windows not far above the garden, the darkness of the night,
his knowledge of the city and the jungle&mdash;all impressed upon
him the belief that he might win to freedom with no considerable
risk; yet he was still loath to make the attempt because as yet he
had nothing definite upon which to base his suspicion that the
anger of Beng Kher had been turned upon him, and further, and more
important still, because he could not leave Pnom Dhek without first
having word with Fou-tan.</p>

<p>As he inwardly debated these matters he paced to and fro the
length of the three rooms of his apartment. He had paused in the
innermost of the three where the flickering light of the cresset
projected his shadow grotesquely upon an ornate hanging that
depended from the ceiling to the floor. He had paused there in deep
thought, his eyes, seeing and yet unseeing, fastened upon this
splendid fabric, when suddenly he saw it move and bulge. There was
something or someone behind it.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch13" id="ch13">XIII. &mdash; FAREWELL FOR EVER!</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">For the first time since Gordon King had entered
the palace of Beng Kher as a guest he was confronted with the
realization that the ornate apparel and trappings that had been
furnished him had included no weapons of defence; and now as he saw
the hanging bulging mysteriously before his eyes he stepped quickly
toward it, prepared to meet either friend or foe with his bare
hands. He saw the bulging fold move slowly behind the fabric toward
its outer edge, and he followed, ready for any eventuality. With a
quick movement the margin of the fabric was pulled aside as Hamar,
the slave, stepped into the room, and at the same instant King
seized him by the throat.</p>

<p>Recognition was instantaneous and, with a smile, the American
released the slave and stepped back. "I did not know whom to
expect, Hamar," he said.</p>

<p>"You were well to be prepared for an enemy, master," said the
slave in low tones, "for you have powerful ones in Pnom Dhek."</p>

<p>"What brings you here, Hamar, in secrecy and in such mystery?"
demanded King.</p>

<p>"Are you alone?" asked Hamar in a whisper.</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Then my mission is fulfilled," said Hamar. "I do but ensure the
safety and the secrecy of another who follows me."</p>

<p>Again the hanging bulged as someone passed behind it; and an
instant later Fou-tan stood before Gordon King, while the slave,
Hamar, bowing low, withdrew.</p>

<p>"Fou-tan!" exclaimed Gordon King, taking a step toward the
girl.</p>

<p>"My Gordon King!" whispered Fou-tan as his arms closed about
her.</p>

<p>"What has happened that you come to me in this way?" asked King.
"I knew that there was something wrong because neither Hamar nor
Indra Sen came to-day and there were warriors posted at my door to
keep me prisoner. But why talk of such things when I have you?
Nothing else counts now, my Fou-tan."</p>

<p>"Ah, Gordon King, but there is much else that counts," replied
the girl. "I should have come before, but guards were placed to
keep me from you. The King, my father, is mad with rage. Tomorrow
you are to be destroyed."</p>

<p>"But why?" demanded King.</p>

<p>"Because yesterday I went to my father and confessed our love. I
appealed to his gratitude to you for having saved me from
Lodivarman and to his love for me, believing that these might
outweigh his determination to wed me to Bharata Rahon, but I was
mistaken. He flew into an uncontrollable rage of passion. He
ordered me to my apartment and he commanded that you be destroyed
upon the morrow; but I found a way, thanks to Hamar and Indra Sen,
and so I have come to bid you farewell, Gordon King, and to tell
you that wherever you may go my heart goes with you, though my body
may be the unwilling slave of another. Indra Sen and Hamar will
guide you to the jungle and point the way toward the great river
that lies in the direction of the rising sun, upon whose opposite
shore you will be safe from the machination of Beng Kher and
Bharata Rahon."</p>

<p>"And you, Fou-tan&mdash;you will go with me?"</p>

<p>The girl shook her head. "No, Gordon King, I may not," she
replied sadly.</p>

<p>"And why?" he asked. "You love me and I love you. Come away with
me into a land of freedom and happiness, where no one will question
our right to love and to live as the gods intended that we should;
for you, Fou-tan, and I were made for one another."</p>

<p>"It cannot be, Gordon King," replied the girl. "The thing that
you suggest offers to me the only happiness that can be possible to
me in life, but for such as I there is an obligation that
transcends all thoughts of personal happiness. I was born a
princess, and because of that there have devolved upon me certain
obligations which may not be escaped. Had I brothers or sisters
born of a queen it might be different, but through me alone may the
royal dynasty of Pnom Dhek be perpetuated. No, Gordon King, not
even love may intervene between a princess of Pnom Dhek and her
duty to her people. Always shall my love be yours, and it will be
harder for me than for you. If I, who am weak, am brave because of
duty, how can you, a man, be less brave? Kiss me once more, then,
and for the last time, Gordon King; then go with Hamar and Indra
Sen, who will lead you to the jungle and point the way to
safety."</p>

<p>As she ceased speaking she threw her arms about his neck and
drew his lips to hers. He felt her tears upon his cheeks, and his
own eyes grew dim. Perhaps not until this instant of parting had
King realized the hold that this dainty flower of the savage jungle
had taken upon his heart. As fragile and beautiful as the finest of
Meissen ceramics, this little, painted princess of a long dead past
held him in a bondage beyond the power of steel.</p>

<p>"I cannot give you up, Fou-tan," he said. "Let me remain.
Perhaps if I talked with your father&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It would be useless," she said, "even if he would grant you an
audience, which he will not."</p>

<p>"Then if you love me as I love you," said King, "you will come
away with me."</p>

<p>"Do not say that, Gordon King. It is cruel," replied the girl.
"I am taught to place duty above all other considerations, even
love. Princesses are not born to happiness. Their exalted birth
dedicates them to duty. They are more than human, and so human
happiness often is denied them. And now you must go. Indra Sen and
Hamar are waiting to guide you to safety. Each moment of delay
lessens your chances for escape."</p>

<p>"I do not wish to escape," said King. "I shall remain and face
whatever consequences are in store for me, for without you,
Fou-tan, life means nothing to me. I would rather remain and die
than go away without you."</p>

<p>"No, no," she cried. "Think of me. I must live on, and always,
if I believe you to be alive, I shall be happier than I could be if
I knew that you were dead."</p>

<p>"You mean that if I were alive there still would be hope?" he
asked.</p>

<p>She shook her head. "Not in the way you mean," she replied; "but
there would be happiness for me in knowing that perhaps somewhere
you were happy. For my sake, you must go. If you love me you will
not deny me this shred of happiness."</p>

<p>"If I go," he said, "you will know that wherever I am, I am
unhappy."</p>

<p>"I am a woman as well as a princess," she replied, "and so
perhaps it will give me a sad happiness to know that you are
unhappy because I am denied you." She smiled ruefully.</p>

<p>"Then I shall go, Fou-tan, if only to make you happy in my
unhappiness; but I think that I shall not go far and that always I
shall nurse hope in my breast, even though you may have put it from
you. Think of me, then, as being always near you, Fou-tan, awaiting
the day when I may claim you."</p>

<p>"That will never be, Gordon King," she replied sadly; "yet it
will do no harm if in our hearts we nurse a hopeless hope. Kiss me
again. It is Fou-tan's last kiss of love."</p>

<p>An eternity of love and passion were encompassed in that brief
instant of their farewell embrace, and then Fou-tan tore herself
from his arms and was gone.</p>

<p>She was gone! King stood for a long time gazing at the hanging
that had moved for a moment to the passage of her lithe figure. It
did not seem possible that she had gone out of his life for ever.
"Fou-tan!" he whispered. "Come back to me. You will come back!" But
the dull pain in his breast was his own best answer to the
anguished cry of his stricken soul.</p>

<p>Again the hanging moved and bulged, and his heart leaped to his
throat; but it was only Hamar, the slave.</p>

<p>"Come, master!" cried the man. "There is no time to be
lost."</p>

<p>King nodded. With leaden steps he followed Hamar to an opening
in the wall behind the hanging, and there he found Indra Sen in the
mouth of a corridor, a flickering torch in his hand.</p>

<p>"In the service of the Princess," said the officer.</p>

<p>"May the gods protect her and give her every happiness," replied
King.</p>

<p>"Come!" said Indra Sen, and turning he led the way along the
corridor and down a long flight of stone steps that King knew must
lead far beneath the palace. They passed the mouths of branching
corridors, attesting the labyrinthine maze that honeycombed the
earth beneath the palace of Beng Kher, and then the tunnel led
straight and level out beneath the city of Pnom Dhek to the jungle
beyond.</p>

<p>"That way lies the great river, Gordon King," said Indra Sen,
pointing toward the east. "I should like to go with you farther,
but I dare not; if Hamar and I are suspected of aiding in your
escape, the blame may be placed upon the Princess, since Hamar is
her slave and I an officer of her guard."</p>

<p>"I would not ask you to go farther, Indra Sen," replied King,
"nor can I find words in which to thank either you or Hamar."</p>

<p>"Here, master," said Hamar, "is the clothing that you wore when
you came to Pnom Dhek. It will be more suitable in the jungle than
that you are wearing," and he handed King a bundle that he had been
carrying. "Here, also, are weapons&mdash;a spear, a knife, a bow
and arrows. They are gifts from the Princess, who says that no
other knows so well how to use them."</p>

<p>The two waited until King had changed into his worn trappings,
and then, bidding him good-bye, they entered the mouth of the
tunnel, leaving him alone in the jungle. To the east lay the
Mekong, where he might construct a raft and drift down to
civilization. To the south lay Lodidhapura, and beyond that the
dwelling of Che and Kangrey. King knew that if he went to the east
and the Mekong he would never return. He thought of Susan Anne
Prentice and his other friends of the outer world; he thought of
the life of usefulness that lay ahead of him there. Then there came
to him the vision of a dainty girl upon a great elephant, reminding
him of that moment, now so long ago, that he had first seen
Fou-tan; and he knew that he must choose now, once and for all,
between civilization and the jungle&mdash;between civilization and
the definite knowledge that he would never see her again or the
jungle and hope, however remote.</p>

<p>"Susan Anne would think me a fool, and I am quite sure that she
would be right," he murmured, as with a shrug he turned his face
squarely toward the south and set off upon his long and lonely
journey through the jungle.</p>

<p>In his mind there was no definite plan beyond a hazy
determination to return to Che and Kangrey and to remain there with
them until it would be safe to assume that Beng Kher had ceased to
search for him. After that, perhaps, he might return to the
vicinity of Pnom Dhek. And who could say what might happen then?
Thus strongly is implanted in the breast of man the eternal seed of
hope. Of course, he knew that he was a fool, but it did not
displease him to be a fool if his foolishness kept him in the same
jungle with Fou-tan.</p>

<p>The familiar odors and noises of the jungle assailed his
nostrils and his ears. With spear in readiness he groped his way to
the trail which he knew led toward the south and his destination.
When he found it, some caprice of hope prompted him to blaze a tree
at the spot in such a way that he might easily identify it, should
he chance to come upon it again.</p>

<p>All night he travelled. Once, for a long time, he knew that some
beast was stalking him; but if it had evil intentions toward him it
evidently could not muster the courage to put them into action, for
eventually he heard it no more. Shortly thereafter dawn came and
with it a sense of greater security.</p>

<p>Shortly after sunrise he came upon a herd of wild pigs, and
before they were aware of his presence he had sunk an arrow into
the heart of a young porker. Then an old boar discovered him and
charged, its gleaming tusks flecked with foam, its savage eyes
red-rimmed with rage; but King did not wait to discuss matters with
the great beast. Plentiful and inviting about him grew the great
trees of the jungle, and into one of these he swung himself as the
boar tore by.</p>

<p>The rest of the herd had disappeared; but for a long time the
boar remained in the vicinity, trotting angrily back and forth
along the trail beneath King and occasionally stopping to glare up
at him malevolently. It seemed an eternity to the hungry man, but
at length the boar appeared to realize the futility of waiting
longer for his prey to descend and trotted off into the jungle
after his herd, the sound of his passage through the underbrush
gradually diminishing until it was lost in the distance. Then King
descended and retrieved his kill. Knowing the cunning of savage
tuskers of the jungle, King was aware that the boar might return to
the spot; and so he did not butcher his kill there, but, throwing
it across his shoulder, continued on for about a mile. Then,
finding a suitable location he stopped and built a fire, over which
he soon was grilling a generous portion of his quarry.</p>

<p>After eating, he left the trail and, going into the jungle a
short distance, found a place where he could lie down to sleep; and
as he dozed he dreamed of snowy linen and soft pillows and heard
the voices of many people arguing and scolding. They annoyed him,
so that he determined to sell his home and move to another
neighborhood; and then seemingly in the same instant he awoke,
though in reality he had slept for six hours. Uppermost in his mind
was his complaint against his neighbors, and loud in his ears were
their voices as he opened his eyes and looked around in puzzled
astonishment at the jungle about him. Then he smiled as the dream
picture of his home faded into the reality of his surroundings. The
smile broadened into a grin as he caught sight of the monkeys
chattering and scolding in the tree above him.</p>

<p>Another night he pushed on through the jungle, and as morning
came he guessed that he must be approaching the vicinity of
Lodidhapura. He made no kill that morning and built no fire, but
satisfied himself with fruits and nuts, which he found in
abundance. He had no intention of risking discovery and capture by
attempting to pass Lodidhapura by day, and so he found a place
where he could lie up until night.</p>

<p>This time he dreamed of Fou-tan and it was a pleasant dream, for
they were alone together in the jungle and all obstacles had been
removed from their path, but presently they heard people
approaching; they seemed to be all about them, and their presence
and their talk annoyed Fou-tan and angered King; in fact, he became
so angry that he awoke. As the figure of Fou-tan faded from his
side, he kept his eyes tight shut, trying to conjure her back
again; but the voices of the intruders continued, and that seemed
strange to King. He could even hear their words: "I tell you it is
he," said one voice; and another cried, "Hey, you, wake up!" Then
King opened his eyes to look upon twenty brass cuirasses upon
twenty sturdy warriors in the uniform of Lodivarman.</p>

<p>"So you have come back!" exclaimed one of the warriors. "I did
not think you were such a fool."</p>

<p>"Neither did I," said King.</p>

<p>"Where is the girl?" demanded the speaker. "Lodivarman will be
glad to have you, but he would rather have the girl."</p>

<p>"He will never get her," said King. "She is safe in the palace
of her father at Pnom Dhek."</p>

<p>"Then it will go so much the harder for you," said the warrior,
"and I am sorry for you, for you are certainly a courageous
man."</p>

<p>King shrugged. He looked about him for some avenue of escape,
but he was entirely surrounded now and the odds were twenty to one
against him. Slowly he arose to his feet. "Here I am," he said.
"What are you going to do with me?"</p>

<p>"We are going to take you to Lodivarman," replied the warrior
who had spoken first. Then they took his weapons from him and tied
his wrists behind his back. They were not cruel nor unduly rough,
for in the hearts of these men, them-selves brave, was admiration
for the courage of their prisoner.</p>

<p>"I'd like to know how you did it," said a warrior walking next
to King.</p>

<p>"Did what?" demanded the American.</p>

<p>"How you got into the King's apartment unseen and got out again
with the girl. Three men have died for it already, but Lodivarman
is no nearer a solution of the puzzle than he was at first."</p>

<p>"Who died and why?" demanded King.</p>

<p>"The major-domo, for one," said the warrior.</p>

<p>"The major-domo did naught but obey the orders of Lodivarman,"
said King.</p>

<p>"You seem to know a lot about it," replied the warrior; "yet
that is the very reason that he died. For once in his life he
should have disobeyed the King, but he failed to do so, and
Lodivarman lay bound and gagged until Vay Thon came to his
rescue."</p>

<p>"Who else died?" asked King.</p>

<p>"The sentry who was posted at the banquet door with you. He had
to admit that he had deserted his post, leaving you there alone;
and with him was slain the officer of the guard who posted you, a
stranger inside the King's palace."</p>

<p>"And these were all?" asked King.</p>

<p>"Yes," said the warrior. And when King smiled he asked him why
he smiled.</p>

<p>"Oh, nothing of any importance," replied the American. "I was
just thinking." He was thinking that the guiltiest of all had
escaped&mdash;the sentry who had permitted Fou-tan to beguile him
into allowing them to pass out of the palace into the garden. He
guessed that this man would not be glad to see him return.</p>

<p>"So even now Lodivarman does not know how I escaped from the
palace?" he demanded.</p>

<p>"No, but he will," replied the man with a sinister grin.</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" asked the American.</p>

<p>"I mean that before he kills you he will torture the truth from
you."</p>

<p>"Evidently my stay in Lodidhapura is to be a pleasant one," he
said.</p>

<p>"I do not know how pleasant it will be," replied the warrior;
"but it will be short."</p>

<p>"Perhaps I shall be glad of that," said King.</p>

<p>"It will be short, man, but it will seem an eternity. I have
seen men die before to satisfy Lodivarman's wrath."</p>

<p>From his captors King learned that his discovery had been purely
accidental; the party that had stumbled upon him constituted a
patrol, making its daily rounds through the jungle in the vicinity
of Lodidhapura. And soon the great city itself arose before King's
eyes, magnificent in its ancient glory, but hard as the stone that
formed its temples and its towers, and hard as the savage hearts
that beat behind its walls. Into its building had gone the sweat
and the blood and the lives of a million slaves; behind its
frowning walls had been enacted two thousand years of cruelties and
bloody crimes committed in the names of kings and gods.</p>

<p>"The mills of the gods!" soliloquized King. "It is not so
remarkable that they grind exceedingly fine as it is that their
masters can reach out of the ages across a world and lay hold upon
a victim who scarce ever heard of them."</p>

<p>They were rapidly approaching one of the gates of Lodidhapura,
at the portals of which King knew he must definitely abandon hope;
and all that King found to excite his interest was his own apathy
to his impending fate. He knew that his mind should be dwelling
upon thoughts of escape, and yet he found himself assuming a
fatalistic attitude of mind that could contemplate impending death
with utmost composure, for, indeed, what had life to offer him? The
orbit of his existence was determined by that shining sun about
which his love revolved&mdash;his little flaming princess. Denied
for ever the warmth and light of her near presence, he was a lost
satellite, wandering aimlessly in the outer darkness and the cold
of interstellar space. What had such an existence to offer against
the peaceful oblivion of death?</p>

<p>Yet whatever his thoughts may have been there was no reflection
of them in his demeanor, as with firm stride and high-held head he
entered once again the city of Lodidhapura, where immediately he
and his escort were surrounded by curious crowds as word travelled
quickly from mouth to mouth that the abductor of the dancing girl
of the Leper King had been captured.</p>

<p>They took him to the dungeons beneath the palace of Lodivarman,
and there they chained him to a wall. As if he had been a wild
beast they chained him with double chains, and the food that they
brought was thrown upon the floor before him&mdash;food that one
would have hesitated to cast before a beast. The darkness of his
cell was mitigated by a window near the low-ceiling&mdash;an
aperture so small that it might scarcely be dignified by the name
of window, since nothing larger than a good-sized cat could have
passed through it; yet it served its purpose in a meager way by
admitting light and air.</p>

<p>Once again, as it had many times in the past, a conviction
sought foothold in King's mind that he was still the victim of the
hallucinations of fever, for notwithstanding all his experiences
since he had entered the jungle it did not seem possible that in
this twentieth century he, a free-born American, could be the
prisoner of a Khmer king. The idea was fantastic, preposterous,
unthinkable. He resorted to all the time-worn expedients for
proving the fallacy of mental aberration, but in the end he always
found himself double-chained to a stone wall in a
dark, foul, stinking dungeon.</p>

<p>Night came and with it those most hideous of nocturnal dungeon
dwellers&mdash;the rats. He fought them off, but always they
returned; and all night he battled with them until, when daylight
came and they left him, he sank exhausted to the stone flagging of
his cell.</p>

<p>Perhaps he slept then, but he could scarcely know, for it seemed
that almost instantly a hand was laid upon his shoulder and he was
shaken to wakefulness. It was the hand of Vama, the commander of
the ten who first had captured him in the jungle; and so it was
neither a rough nor unfriendly hand, for the brass-bound warrior
could find in his heart only admiration for this courageous
stranger who had dared to thwart the desires of the Leper King,
whom he feared more than he respected.</p>

<p>"I am glad to see you again, Gordon King," said Vama, "but I am
sorry that we meet under such circumstances. The rage of Lodivarman
is boundless and from it no man may save you, but it may lessen the
anguish of your last hours to know that you have many friends among
the warriors of Lodidhapura."</p>

<p>"Thank you, Vama," replied King. "I have found more than
friendship in the land of the Khmers, and if I also find death
here, it is because of my own choosing. I am content with whatever
fate awaits me, but I want you to know that your assurances of
friendship will ameliorate whatever pangs of suffering death may
hold for me. But why are you here? Has Lodivarman sent you to
execute his sentence upon me?"</p>

<p>"He will not finish you so easily as that," replied Vama. "What
he has in his mind I do not know. I have been sent to conduct you
to his presence, a signal honor for you, attesting the impression
that your act made upon him."</p>

<p>"Perhaps he wants to question me," suggested King.</p>

<p>"Doubtless," replied Vama, "but that he could have delegated to
his torturers, who well know how to elicit whatever they wish from
the lips of their victims."</p>

<p>Vama bent and unlocked the padlock that fettered King to the
wall and led him into the corridor upon which his cell opened,
where the rest of Vama's ten awaited to escort the prisoner into
the presence of Lodivarman. Kau and Tchek were there with the
others with whom King had become familiar while he served as a
warrior of the royal guard of Lodivarman, Leper King of
Lodidhapura. Rough were the greetings that they exchanged, but none
the less cordial; and so, guarded by his own friends, Gordon King
was conducted toward the audience chamber of Lodivarman.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch14" id="ch14">XIV. &mdash; MY LORD THE TIGER</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">Lodivarman, a malignant scowl upon his face,
crouched upon his great throne. Surrounding him were his warlords
and his ministers, his high priests and the officers of his
household; and at his left knelt a slave bearing a great golden
platter piled high with mushrooms. But for the moment Lodivarman
was too intent upon his vengeance to be distracted even by the
cravings of his unnatural appetite, for here at last he had within
his grasp the creature that had centered upon itself all the
unbridled rage of a tyrant.</p>

<p>Trembling with the anger that he could not conceal, Lodivarman
glared at Gordon King as the prisoner was led to the foot of the
dais below his throne.</p>

<p>"Where is the girl?" demanded the King angrily.</p>

<p>"The Princess Fou-tan is safe in the palace of Beng Kher,"
replied King.</p>

<p>"How did you get her away? Some one must have helped you. If you
would save yourself the anguish of torture, speak the truth," cried
Lodivarman, his voice trembling with rage.</p>

<p>"Lodivarman, the King, knows better than any other how I took
Fou-tan from him," replied the American.</p>

<p>"I do not mean that," screamed Lodivarman, trembling. "Siva will
see that you suffer sufficient agonies for the indignity that you
put upon me, but I can curtail that if you will reveal your
accomplices."</p>

<p>"I had no accomplices," replied King. "I took the Princess and
walked out of your palace and no one saw me."</p>

<p>"How did you get out?" demanded Lodivarman.</p>

<p>King smiled. "You are going to torture me, Lodivarman, and you
are going to kill me. Why should I give you even the gratification
of satisfying your curiosity? Wantonly you have already destroyed
three men in your anger. I shall be the fourth. The life of any one
of us is worth more than yours. If I could I would not add further
to the debt that you must pay in the final accounting when you face
God beyond the grave."</p>

<p>"What do you know, stranger, of the gods of the Khmers?"
demanded Lodivarman.</p>

<p>"I know little or nothing of Brahma, of Vishnu, or Siva,"
replied King, "but I do know that above all there is a God that
kings and tyrants must face; and in His eyes even a good king is
not greater than a good slave, and of all creatures a tyrant is the
most despicable."</p>

<p>"You would question the power of Brahma, of Vishnu, and of
Siva!" hissed Lodivarman. "You dare to set your God above them!
Before you die then, by the gods, you shall seek their mercy in
your anguish."</p>

<p>"Whatever my suffering may be, you will be its author,
Lodivarman," replied King. "The gods will have nothing to do with
it."</p>

<p>A minor priest came near and whispered in the King's ear. Vay
Thon, the high priest, was there, too. The old man stood with his
eyes fixed compassionately upon King, but he knew he was powerless
to aid his friend, for who should know better than a high priest
the power of kings and the futility of gods.</p>

<p>The priest appeared to be urging something upon his ruler with
considerable enthusiasm.</p>

<p>Lodivarman listened to the whispered words of counsel, and then
for some time he sat in thought. Presently he raised his eyes to
King again. "It pleases us to prove the power of our Gods,
revealing their omnipotence to the eyes of our people. My Lord the
Tiger knows no god; you shall contend with him. If your God be so
powerful let him preserve you from the beast." Lodivarman helped
himself to mushrooms and sank back in his throne. "Take him to the
pit of My Lord the Tiger," he said presently; "but do not liberate
the great beast until we come."</p>

<p>The soldiers surrounded King and led him away, but before they
had reached the doorway leading from the audience chamber
Lodivarman halted them. "Wait!" he cried. "It shall not be said the
Lodivarman is unfair even to an enemy. When this man enters the pit
with My Lord the Tiger, see that he has a javelin wherewith to
defend himself. I have heard stories of his prowess; let us see if
they were exaggerated."</p>

<p>From the palace, King was led across the royal garden to the
great temple of Siva; and there, upon one of the lower levels, a
place where he had never been before, he was conducted to a small
amphitheater, in the center of which was sunk a deep pit that was,
perhaps, a hundred feet square. The entrance to the pit was down a
stairway and along a narrow corridor of stone to massive wooden
doors which the soldiers threw open.</p>

<p>"Enter, Gordon King," said Vama. "Here is my javelin, and may
your God and my gods be with you."</p>

<p>"Thanks!" said King. "I imagine that I shall need them all," and
then he stepped into the sunlit pit as the doors were closed behind
him.</p>

<p>The floor and walls of the cubicle were of blocks of stone set
without mortar, but so perfectly fitted that the joints were
scarcely discernible. As King stood with his back against the
doorway through which he had entered the pit, he saw in the wall
opposite him another door of great planks, a low sinister door,
behind which he guessed paced a savage, hungry carnivore.</p>

<p>King hefted the javelin in his hand. It was a sturdy,
well-balanced weapon. Once again he recalled his college days when
he had hurled a similar weapon beneath the admiring eyes of his
mates; but then only distance had counted, only the superficial
show that is the keynote of civilization had mattered.</p>

<p>What mattered it that other men might cast a javelin more
accurately? Which after all would be the practical test of
efficiency. Gordon King could cast it farther than any of them,
which was a feat far more showy than accuracy; but from the
unlettered Che he had learned what college had failed to teach him
and had acquired an accuracy as uncanny as the great distances that
had won him fame.</p>

<p>Twice already had he met My Lord the Tiger and vanquished him
with his javelin. Each time it had seemed to King a miracle. That
it could be repeated again, that for the third time he could
overcome the lord of Asia seemed incredible. And what would it
profit him were he to succeed? From the cruel fangs and talons of
the tiger he would be transferred to the greater cruelties of
Lodivarman.</p>

<p>As he stood there upon the stone flagging of the pit beneath the
hot sun that poured its unobstructed rays into the enclosure, he
saw the audience sauntering to the stone benches that encircled the
arena. It was evident that those who were to witness his
destruction were members of the household of the King; princes and
nobles and warriors there were and ministers and priests, and with
them were their women. Last of all came Lodivarman with his
bodyguard and slaves. To a canopied throne he made his way while
the audience knelt, the meeker of them touching their foreheads to
the stone flagging of the aisles. Before his throne Lodivarman
halted, while his dead eyes swept quickly over the assembly,
passing from them to the arena and the solitary warrior standing
there below him. For a long moment the gaze of the King was riveted
upon the American; hatred and suppressed rage were in that long,
venomous appraisal of the man who had thwarted and humiliated
him&mdash;that low creature that had dared lay profaning hands
upon the person of the King.</p>

<p>Slowly Lodivarman sank into his throne. Then he made a brief
sign to an attendant, and an instant later the notes of a trumpet
floated out across the still air of the arena. The kneeling men and
women arose and took their seats. Once again Lodivarman raised his
hand, and again the trumpet sounded, and every eye was turned upon
the low doorway upon the opposite side of the arena from the
American.</p>

<p>King saw the heavy barrier rise slowly. In the darkness beyond
it nothing was visible at first, but presently he was aware that
something moved within, and then he saw the familiar yellow and
black stripes that he had expected. Slowly a great tiger stepped
into the doorway, pausing upon the threshold, blinking from the
glare of the sunlight. His attention was attracted first by the
people upon the stone benches above him, and he looked up at them
and growled. Then he looked down and saw King. Instantly his whole
attitude changed. He half crouched, and his tail moved in sinuous
undulations; his head was flattened, and his eyes glared
fiercely.</p>

<p>Gordon King did not wait for the attack. He had a theory of his
own based upon his experience with wild beasts. He knew them to be
nervous and oftentimes timid when confronted by emergencies that
offered aspects that were new and unfamiliar.</p>

<p>A gasp of astonishment, not unmingled with admiration, arose
from the people lining the edges of the pit, for the thing that
they witnessed was as surprising to them as King hoped it would be
to the tiger&mdash;instead of the beast charging the man, they saw
the man charging the beast. Straight toward the crouching carnivore
King ran, his spear balanced and ready in his hand.</p>

<p>For an instant the tiger hesitated. He had expected nothing like
this; and then he did what King had hoped that he might do, what he
had known there was a fair chance that he would do. Fearful of the
new and unexpected, the beast turned and broke, and as he did so he
exposed his left side fully and at close range to the quick eye of
his antagonist.</p>

<p>Swift as lightning moved King's spear-arm. The heavy javelin,
cast with unerring precision and backed to the last ounce by the
strength and the weight of the American, tore into the striped side
just behind the left shoulder of the great beast. At the instant
that the weapon left his hand King turned and raced to the far
extremity of the arena. The running tiger, carried by his own
momentum, rolled over and over upon the stone flagging; his horrid
screams and coughing roars shook the amphitheater. King was
positive that the beast's heart was pierced, but he knew that these
great cats were so tenacious of life that in the brief instant of
their dying they often destroyed their adversaries also. It was for
this reason that he had put as much distance as he could between
himself and the infuriated animal, and it was well that he had done
so, for the instant that the tiger had regained his feet he
discovered King and charged straight for him.</p>

<p>Unarmed and helpless, the man stood waiting. Breathless, the
spectators had arisen from their stone benches and were bending
eagerly forward in tense anticipation of the cruel and bloody
end.</p>

<p>Half the length of the arena the tiger crossed in great bounds.
A sudden conviction swept the man that after all he had missed the
heart. He was poised for what he already knew must be a futile leap
to one side in an effort to dodge the first charge of the onrushing
beast, when suddenly the tiger collapsed, seemingly in mid-air; and
his great carcass came rolling across the flagging to stop at
King's feet.</p>

<p>For an instant there was utter silence, and then a great shout
rose from the spectators. "He has won his life, Lodivarman! He has
won his freedom!" arose here and there from the braver among them,
and the others cheered in approval.</p>

<p>Lodivarman, crouching in his throne with an ugly sneer upon his
lips, called a functionary to him for a few, brief whispered
instructions, and then the Leper King arose and passed through the
kneeling people as he departed from the amphitheater.</p>

<p>A moment later the door that had opened to admit King to the pit
creaked again upon its hinges to admit Vama and an escort of
warriors.</p>

<p>King greeted his former comrade with a smile. "Have you come to
finish the work that the tiger failed to do," he asked, "or have
you come to escort me to freedom?"</p>

<p>"Neither," replied Vama. "We have come to return you to your
cell, for such are the commands of the King. But if he does not set
you free eventually," added Vama in low tones, "it will be to the
lasting disgrace of Lodivarman, for never was a man more deserving
of his life and liberty than you. You are the first man, Gordon
King, who has ever faced the tiger in this pit and come out
alive."</p>

<p>"Which does not at all satisfy Lodivarman's craving for
revenge," suggested the American.</p>

<p>"I am afraid you are right," said Vama, as they moved along the
corridor toward the dungeon, "but you must know that today you have
made many new friends in Lodidhapura, for there are those among us
who can appreciate courage, strength and skill."</p>

<p>"My mistake," said King, "was not in my selection of friends,
but in my selection of an enemy; for the latter, I have found one
from whom all the friends in the world may not save me."</p>

<p>Once again in his gloomy, cheerless cell King was fettered to
the cold, familiar stone; but he was cheered by the kind words of
Vama and the friendly expressions of other members of the guard
that had escorted him hither; and when presently a slave came with
food he, too, had words of praise and friendliness; and the food
that he brought was well prepared and plentiful.</p>

<p>The day passed and the long night followed, and toward the
middle of the next forenoon a visitor came to King's cell; and as
he paused in the doorway, the prisoner recognized the yellow robe
and the white beard of Vay Thon, the high priest of Siva, and his
face lighted with pleasure, as the old man peered into the dim
interior of his prison.</p>

<p>"Welcome, Vay Thon!" he exclaimed, "and accept my apologies for
the mean hospitality that I may offer so distinguished and so
welcome a guest."</p>

<p>"Give that no thought, my son," replied the old man. "It is
enough that so courageous a warrior should receive a poor old
priest with such pleasure as is evidenced by your tone. I am glad
to be with you, but I wish that it might be under happier
circumstances and that I might be the bearer of more welcome
news."</p>

<p>"You have brought news to me, then?" asked King.</p>

<p>"Yes," replied Vay Thon. "Because of what I owe you and for the
friendship that I feel for you I have come to warn you, though any
warning of your impending doom can avail you nothing."</p>

<p>"Lodivarman will not give me my liberty or my life, then?" asked
King.</p>

<p>"No," replied Vay Thon. "The affront that you put upon him he
considers beyond forgiveness. You are to be destroyed, but in such
a way that the responsibility shall not rest upon the shoulders of
Lodivarman."</p>

<p>"And how is this to be accomplished?" asked the American.</p>

<p>"You are to be summoned to the audience chamber of Lodivarman to
receive your freedom and then you are to be set upon and
assassinated by members of his guard. The story is to be spread
that you sought to take the life of Lodivarman, so that his
soldiers were compelled to slay you."</p>

<p>"Vay Thon," said King, "perhaps the warning that you bring me
may not save me from the fate that Lodivarman has ordained; but it
has demonstrated your friendship; and my last hours, therefore,
will be happier because you came. And now go, for if the knowledge
that you have imparted prompts me to take advantage of some
opportunity for revenge or escape, there must be no clue to suggest
that you are in any way responsible."</p>

<p>"I appreciate your thoughtfulness, my friend," replied the old
priest, "and as I can be of no service to you I shall leave you,
but know that constantly I shall supplicate the gods to protect
you." He came and placed his hands upon King's shoulders.
"Good-bye, my son, my heart is heavy," and as the tears welled in
his old eyes he turned and left the cell.</p>

<p>Vay Thon had been gone but a short time when King heard the
sound of footsteps approaching, and with these were mingled the
clank of armour and the rattling of accoutrements. Presently, when
the men halted before the doorway of his cell, he saw that they
were all strangers to him. The officer who commanded them entered
the cell, greeting King pleasantly.</p>

<p>"I bring you good news," he said, as he stooped and unlocked the
padlock and cast King's fetters from him.</p>

<p>"Any news would be good news here," replied the American.</p>

<p>"But this is the best of all news," said the officer.
"Lodivarman has commanded that you be conducted to him that he may
grant you your freedom in person."</p>

<p>"Splendid," said King, though he could scarcely repress a smile
as he recalled the message that Vay Thon had brought him.</p>

<p>Back to the now familiar audience chamber of the King they
conducted the prisoner, and once again he stood before the throne
of Lodivarman. There were few in attendance upon the monarch, a
fact which suggested that he had not cared to share the secret of
his perfidy with more than was absolutely necessary. But few though
they were, the inevitable slave was there, kneeling at Lodivarman's
side with his platter of mushrooms; and it was the sight of these
lowly fungi that instantly riveted the attention of the doomed man,
for suddenly they had become more important than brass-bound
soldiers, than palace functionaries, than the King himself, for
they had suggested to the American a possible means of
salvation.</p>

<p>He knew that he must think and act quickly, for he had no means
of knowing how soon the signal for his assassination would be
given.</p>

<p>Surrounded by his guards, he crossed the audience chamber and
halted before the throne of Lodivarman. He should have prostrated
himself then, but he did not; instead he looked straight into the
dead eyes of the tyrant.</p>

<p>"Lodivarman," he said, "listen to me for a moment before you
give the signal that will put into execution the plan that you have
conceived, for at this instant your own life and happiness hang in
the balance."</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" demanded Lodivarman.</p>

<p>"You questioned the power of my God, Lodivarman," continued
King, "but you saw me vanquish My Lord the Tiger in the face of the
wrath of Siva, and now you know that I am aware of just what you
planned for me here. How could I have vanquished the beast, or how
could I have known your plans except through the intervention and
the favor of my God?"</p>

<p>Lodivarman seemed ill at ease. His eyes shifted suspiciously
from one man to another. "I have been betrayed," he said
angrily.</p>

<p>"On the contrary," replied King, "you have been given such an
opportunity as never could have come to you without me. Will you
hear me before I am slain?"</p>

<p>"I do not know what you are talking about. I sent for you to
free you; but speak on, I am listening."</p>

<p>"You are a leper," said King, and at the hideous word Lodivarman
sprang to his feet, trembling with rage, his face livid, his dead
eyes glaring.</p>

<p>"Death to him!" he cried. "No man may speak that accursed word
to me and live."</p>

<p>At Lodivarman's words warriors sprang menacingly toward King.
"Wait!" cried the American. "You have told me that you would
listen. Wait until I have spoken, for what I have to say means more
to you than life itself."</p>

<p>"Speak, then, but be quick," snapped Lodivarman.</p>

<p>"In the great country from which I come," continued King, "there
are many brilliant physicians who have studied all of the diseases
to which mankind is heir. I, too, am a physician, and under many of
those men have I studied and particularly have I studied the
disease of leprosy. Lodivarman, you believe this disease to be
incurable; but I, the man whom you would destroy, can cure
you."</p>

<p>King's voice, well modulated but clear and distinct, had carried
his words to every man in the audience chamber, and the silence
which followed this dramatic declaration was so profound that one
might have said that no man even breathed. All felt the tenseness
of the moment.</p>

<p>Lodivarman, who had sunk back into his throne after his wild
outburst of anger, seemed almost to have collapsed. He was
trembling visibly, his lower jaw dropped upon his chest. King knew
that the man was impressed, that all within the audience chamber
were impressed, and his knowledge of human nature told him that he
had won, for he knew that Lodivarman, king though he was, was only
human and that he would grasp at even the most impalpable
suggestion of hope that might be offered him in the extremity of
his fear and loathing for the disease that claimed him.</p>

<p>Presently the tyrant found his voice. "You can cure me?" he
asked, almost piteously.</p>

<p>"My life shall be the forfeit," replied King, "on condition that
you swear before your gods in the presence of Vay Thon, the high
priest, that in return for your health you will grant me life and
liberty&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Life, liberty, and every honor that lies within my power shall
be conferred upon you," cried Lodivarman, his voice trembling with
emotion. "If you rid me of this horrid sickness, aught that you ask
shall be granted. Come, let us not delay. Cure me at once."</p>

<p>"The sickness has held you for many years, Lodivarman," replied
King, "and it cannot be cured in a day. I must prepare medicine,
and you must carry out the instructions that I shall give you, for
I can cure you only if you obey me implicitly."</p>

<p>"How do I know that you will not poison me?" demanded
Lodivarman.</p>

<p>King thought for a moment. Here was an obstacle that he had not
foreseen, and then suddenly a solution suggested itself. "I can
satisfy you as to that, Lodivarman," he replied, "for when I
prepare medicine for you I shall take some of it myself in your
presence."</p>

<p>Lodivarman nodded. "That will safeguard me," he said, "and now
what else?"</p>

<p>"Put me where Vay Thon, the high priest, can watch me always.
You trust him, and he will see that no harm befalls you through me.
He will help me to obtain the medicine that I require, and tomorrow
I shall be ready to commence the treatment. But in the meantime
your system must be prepared to permit the medicine to take effect,
and in this I can do nothing without your co-operation."</p>

<p>"Speak!" said Lodivarman. "Whatever you suggest I shall do."</p>

<p>"Have every mushroom in Lodidhapura destroyed," said King. "Have
your slave burn those that have been prepared, and determine never
to taste another."</p>

<p>Lodivarman scowled angrily. "What have mushrooms to do with the
cure?" he demanded. "They afford me the only pleasure that I have
in life. This is naught but a trick to annoy and discomfort
me."</p>

<p>"As you will," said King with a shrug. "I can cure you, but only
if you obey my instructions. My medicines will have no effect if
you continue to eat mushrooms. But it is up to you, Lodivarman. Do
as you choose."</p>

<p>For a time the ruler sat tapping nervously upon the arm of his
throne, and then suddenly and almost savagely he turned upon the
kneeling slave at his side. "Throw out the accursed things," he
cried. "Throw them out! Destroy them! Burn them! And never let me
set my eyes upon you again."</p>

<p>Trembling, the slave departed, carrying the platter of mushrooms
with him, and then Lodivarman directed his attention upon one of
the officers of his household. "Destroy the royal mushroom bed," he
cried, "and see to it that you do it thoroughly," and then to
another, "Summon Vay Thon." As the officers left the room
Lodivarman turned to King again. "How long will it be before I am
cured?" he asked.</p>

<p>"I cannot tell that until I see how you react to my medicine,"
replied the American; "but I believe that you will see almost
immediate improvement. It may be very slow, and on the other hand,
it may come very rapidly."</p>

<p>While they waited for Vay Thon, Lodivarman plied King with
question after question; and now that he was convinced that men had
been cured of leprosy and that he himself might be cured, a great
change seemed to come over him. It was as though a new man had been
born; his whole aspect appeared to change, as the hideous burden of
fear and hopelessness that he had carried for so many years was
dissipated by the authoritative manner and confident pronouncement
of the American. And when Vay Thon entered the audience chamber, he
saw a smile upon Lodivarman's face for the first time in so many
years that he had almost forgotten that the man could smile.</p>

<p>Quickly Lodivarman explained the situation to Vay Thon and gave
him his instructions relative to the American, for he wished the
latter to hasten the preparation of his medicine.</p>

<p>"Tomorrow," he cried, as the two men were backing from the
apartment, "to-morrow my cure shall commence." And Gordon King did
not tell him that his cure already had started, that it had started
the instant that he had given orders for the destruction of the
royal mushroom bed, for he did not wish Lodivarman to know what he
knew&mdash;that the man was not a leper and never had been, that
what in his ignorance he had thought was leprosy was nothing more
than an aggravated form of dermatitis, resulting from
food-poisoning. At least King prayed that his diagnosis was
correct.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch15" id="ch15">XV. &mdash; WAR</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">From the quarters of Vay Thon slaves were
despatched into the jungle for many strange herbs and roots, and
from these King compounded three prescriptions, but the basis of
each was a mild laxative. The purpose of the other ingredients was
chiefly to add impressiveness and mystery to the compounds, for
however much King might deplore this charlatanism he was keenly
aware that he must not permit the cure to appear too simple. He was
dealing with a primitive mind, and he was waging a battle of wits
for his life&mdash;conditions which seemed to warrant the adoption
of means that are not altogether frowned upon by the most ethical
of modern practitioners.</p>

<p>Three times a day he went in person to a small audience chamber
off the bedroom of Lodivarman, and there, in the presence of Vay
Thon and officers of the royal household, he tasted the medicine
himself before administering it to Lodivarman. Upon the third day
it became apparent that the sores upon the body of the King were
drying up. Exsiccation was so manifest that Lodivarman was
jubilant. He laughed and joked with those about him and renewed his
assurances to the American that no reward within the power of his
giving would be denied him when Lodivarman was again a whole man.
Each day thereafter the improvement was marked and rapid, until, at
the end of three weeks, no trace remained of the hideous sores that
had so horribly disfigured the monarch for so many years.</p>

<p>Gradually King had been diminishing the dosages that he had been
administering and had tapered off the treatment from three to two a
day and finally to one. Upon the twenty-first day King ordered
Lodivarman to his bedroom; and there, in the presence of Vay Thon
and three of the highest officers of the kingdom, he examined the
King's entire body and found the skin clear, healthy, and without
blemish.</p>

<p>"Well?" demanded Lodivarman, when the examination had been
completed.</p>

<p>"Your Majesty is cured," said King.</p>

<p>The King arose from his bed and threw a robe about him. "Life
and liberty are yours, Gordon King," he said. "A palace, slaves,
riches are at your disposal. You have proven yourself a great
warrior and a great physician. If you will remain here you shall be
an officer in the royal guard and the private physician of
Lodivarman, the King."</p>

<p>"There is but one reason why I care to remain in the land of the
Khmers," replied King, "and that reason you must know, Lodivarman,
before I can accept the honors that you would bestow upon me."</p>

<p>"And what is that?" demanded Lodivarman.</p>

<p>"To be as near as possible to the Princess Fou-tan of Pnom Dhek
in the hope that some day I may claim her hand in marriage as
already I have won her love."</p>

<p>"Already have I forgiven you for that act of yours which
deprived me of the girl," said Lodivarman, without an instant's
hesitation. "If you can win her, I shall place no obstacles in your
path, but on the contrary I shall assist you in every way within my
power. Let no man say that the gratitude of Lodivarman is tinged
with selfishness or with revenge."</p>

<p>Lodivarman did even more than he had promised, for he created
Gordon King a prince of Khmer, and so it was that the American
found himself elevated from the position of the condemned criminal
to that of the titled master of a palace&mdash;a lord over many
slaves and the commander of five hundred Khmer warriors.</p>

<p>Great was the rejoicing in Lodidhapura when the King's cure
became known; and for a week the city was given over to dancing, to
pageants, and to celebration. In the howdah of the royal elephant
at Lodivarman's side, King rode along the avenues of Lodidhapura in
the van of a procession of a thousand elephants trapped in gorgeous
silks and gold and jewels.</p>

<p>And then upon the last day, when the rejoicing was at its
height, all was changed in the brief span of an instant. A
sweat-streaked, exhausted messenger staggered to the gates of
Lodidhapura; and ere he swooned from fatigue he gasped out his
brief message to the captain of the gates.</p>

<p>"Beng Kher comes with a great army to avenge the insult to his
Princess," and then he fell unconscious at the feet of the
officer.</p>

<p>Quickly was the word carried to Lodivarman and quickly did it
spread through the city of Lodidhapura. The gay trappings of a fete
vanished like magic to be replaced by the grim trappings of war.
Well worn and darkened with age were the housings and harnesses of
the elephants as a thousand strong they filed from the north gates
of Lodidhapura, bearing upon their backs the sturdy archers and
spearmen of Lodivarman; and with them rode Gordon King, the prince,
at the head of his new command. Alone upon a swift elephant he rode
with only the mahout seated before him on the head of the great
beast.</p>

<p>Little or nothing did the American know of the tactics of Khmer
warfare, except that which he had derived from fellow warriors
while he served among them and from other officers since his
appointment. He had learned that the battles consisted principally
of individual combat between elephant crews and that the duties of
an officer did little more than constitute him a focal point upon
which his men might rally for the pursuit if the enemy broke and
retreated.</p>

<p>With long, rolling strides the elephants of war swung along the
avenue into the jungle. Here and there were bits of color or a
glint of sunlight on a shining buckle, but for the most part the
beasts were caparisoned with stern simplicity for the business of
war. From the howdahs the burnished cuirasses of the warriors gave
back the sunlight, and from the shaft of many a spear floated a
colored ribbon. The men themselves were grim and silent, or moved
to coarse jokes and oaths as suited the individuality of each; and
the music was from rough-throated trumpets and booming drums.</p>

<p>Toward a great clearing the army made its way and there awaited
the coming of Beng Kher, for wars between Lodidhapura and Pnom Dhek
were governed by age-old custom. Here for a thousand years their
armies had met whenever Pnom Dhek attacked Lodidhapura. Here the
first engagement must take place; and if the soldiers of Beng Kher
could not pass the forces of Lodivarman, they must turn back in
defeat. It was a game of war governed by strict rules up to the
point where one side broke and fled. If the troops of Lodivarman
broke here they would be pursued to the gates of Lodidhapura; and
there, within the walls of the city, they would make their final
stand. But if Beng Kher's troops broke first, Lodivarman could take
credit for a victory and might pursue them or not as he chose. To
elude one another by strategy, to attempt to gain the rear of an
enemy were not to be countenanced, largely so, perhaps, from the
fact that flanking and enveloping movements were impossible with
elephant troops in a dense forest, where the only avenues of
advance or retreat were the well-marked trails that were known to
all.</p>

<p>The clearing, along the south side of which the troops of
Lodivarman were drawn up, was some two miles in length by a half or
three-quarters of a mile in width. The ground was slightly rolling
and almost entirely denuded of vegetation, since it was in almost
constant use for the training and drilling of elephant troops.</p>

<p>As the last of the great pachyderms wheeled into place, the
drums and the trumpets were silent; and from out of the north, to
the listening ears of the warriors, came faintly the booming of
Pnom Dhek's war drums. The enemy was approaching. The men looked to
arrows and bowstrings. The mahouts spoke soothingly and
encouragingly to their mighty charges. The officers rode slowly up
and down the line in front of their men, exhorting them to deeds of
courage. As the sound of the enemy drums and trumpets drew nearer,
the elephants became noticeably nervous. They swayed from side to
side, raising and lowering their trunks and flapping their great
ears.</p>

<p>In each howdah were many extra spears and great quantities of
arrows. King, alone, had twenty spears in his howdah and fully a
hundred arrows. When he had first seen them loaded upon his
elephant it had not seemed possible that he was to use them against
other men, and he had found himself rather shrinking from
contemplation of the thought; but now with the sound of the war
drums in his ears and the smell of leather and the stink of war
elephants in his nostrils and with that long line of grim faces and
burnished cuirasses at his back, he felt a sudden mad blood lust
that thrilled him to the depths of his being. No longer was he the
learned and cultured gentleman of the twentieth century, but as
much a Khmer warrior as ever drew a bow for ancient Yacovarman, The
King of Glory.</p>

<p>The enemy is coming. The blare of his trumpets resounds across
the field of battle, and now the head of the enemy column emerges
on to the field. The trumpets of Lodidhapura blare and her drums
boom. An elephant lifts his trunk and trumpets shrilly. It is with
difficulty now that the mahouts hold their charges in line.</p>

<p>The enemy line is finally formed upon the opposite side of the
great field. For a moment drums and trumpets are stilled, and then
a hoarse fanfare rolls across the clearing from the trumpeters of
Beng Kher. "We are ready," it seems to say, and instantly it is
answered from Lodivarman's side. Simultaneously now the two lines
advance upon one another; and for a moment there is a semblance of
order and discipline, but presently here and there an elephant
forges ahead of his fellows. They break into a trot. King is almost
run down by his own men.</p>

<p>"Forward!" he shouts to his mahout.</p>

<p>Pandemonium has broken loose. Trumpets and drums merge with the
battle cries of ten thousand warriors. The elephants, goaded to
anger, scream and trumpet in their rage. As the two lines converge,
the bowmen loose a shower of arrows from either side; and now the
curses and cries of wounded men and the shrill screaming of hurt
elephants mingle with the trumpets and the bugles and the war cries
in the mad diapason of war.</p>

<p>King found himself carried forward on the crest of battle
straight toward a lone officer of the enemy forces. He was riding
the swaying howdah now like a sailor on the deck of a storm-tossed
ship. The antagonist approaching him was balancing his javelin,
waiting until they should come within surer range; but King did not
wait. He was master of his weapon, and he had no doubts. Behind him
were his men. He did not know that they were watching him; but they
were, for he was a new officer and this his first engagement. His
standing with them would be determined now forever. All of them had
heard of his prowess and many of them had doubted the truth of the
stories they had heard. They saw his spear-arm come back, they saw
the heavy weapon flying through the air and a hoarse cheer broke
from their throats as the point crashed through the burnished
cuirass of the enemy.</p>

<p>An instant later the two lines came together with such terrific
force that a score of elephants were overthrown. King was almost
pitched from his howdah; and an instant later he was fighting hand
to hand, surrounded by the warriors of Beng Kher. The battle now
resolved itself into a slow milling of elephants as the mahouts
sought to gain advantageous positions for the crews in their
howdahs. Here and there a young elephant, or one sorely wounded and
driven mad by pain, broke from the melee and bolted for the jungle.
Warriors leaped from their howdahs, risking injury rather than the
almost certain death that would await them as the frightened beasts
stampeded through the forest. Only the mahouts clung to their
posts, facing death rather than the disgrace of abandoning their
charges. The hot sun blazed down upon the stinking, sweating mass
of war. The feet of the milling elephants raised clouds of dust
through which it was sometimes difficult to see more than a few
yards.</p>

<p>In the moment that King was surrounded an arrow grazed his arm,
while a dozen glanced from his helmet and his cuirass. His
impressions were confused. He saw savage, distorted faces before
him, at which he lunged with a long javelin. He was choked with
dust and blinded by sweat. He heard the savage trumpeting of his
own elephant and the shouts and curses of his mahout. It seemed
impossible that he could extricate himself from such a position, or
that he could long survive the vicious attack that was being
directed upon him by the men of the officer he had slain; and then
some of his own elephants came charging in, and a moment later he
was surrounded by the warriors of his own command.</p>

<p>Ever forward they pushed. What was happening elsewhere in the
line they did not know, for obscuring dust hid all but those close
to them. The line before them gave; and then it held and pushed
them back again, and so the battle surged to and fro and back and
forth. But always it seemed to King that his side gained a little
more at each advance than it lost. Presently the enemy line gave
way entirely. King saw the elephants of Pnom Dhek turn in the murky
dust and race toward the north. Just what the rest of the line was
doing he did not know; and for the moment none of his own men was
visible, so thick and heavy hung the pall of dust upon the field of
battle.</p>

<p>Perhaps King forgot what little of the rules of Khmer warfare he
had ever learned. Perhaps he thought only of following up an
advantage already gained; but be that as it may, he shouted to his
men to follow and ordered his mahout to pursue the fleeing warriors
to Pnom Dhek. Amid the din of battle his men did not hear him, and
so it was that, alone, Gordon King pursued that part of the enemy
line that had broken directly in front of him.</p>

<p>Presently, as they drew away from the center of the field and
the dust clouds became less impenetrable, King saw the grey bulk of
an elephant moving just ahead of him; and then as the visibility
increased he saw still other enemy elephants farther in advance.
Now he could see that there were two men in the howdah of the
elephant just in front of him; but as he raised his javelin to cast
it, he suddenly recognized the man at whom his weapon was to be
directed&mdash;it was Beng Kher, King of Pnom Dhek and father of
Fou-tan. King lowered his spear-arm; he could not slay the father
of the girl he loved. But who was his companion? Through the
lessening dust King sensed a vague familiarity in that figure. It
occurred to him that he might take Beng Kher prisoner and thus
force him to sanction his marriage with Fou-tan. Other mad schemes
passed through his head as the two swift elephants raced across the
clearing.</p>

<p>Neither Beng Kher nor his companion appeared to be paying any
attention to the warrior pursuing them, which convinced King that
they believed him to be one of their own men. King saw Beng Kher's
companion lean forward over the front of the howdah as though
issuing instructions to the mahout; and almost immediately their
course was changed to the right, while ahead of them King saw the
other elephants that had accompanied Beng Kher disappearing into
the forest to the north.</p>

<p>The air about them was comparatively free from dust now, so that
King could see all that transpired about him. He glanced behind;
and from the clouds of dust arising from the center of the field he
knew that the battle was still raging, but he kept on in pursuit of
the King of Pnom Dhek.</p>

<p>To his dismay he saw that the royal elephant was drawing away
from him, being swifter than his own. He saw something else,
too&mdash;he saw Beng Kher remonstrating with his companion, and
then for the first time he recognized the other man in the howdah
as Bharata Rahon.</p>

<p>King was exhorting his mahout to urge the elephant to greater
speed; and when he glanced up again at the two men in the howdah
ahead of him, he saw Bharata Rahon suddenly raise a knife and
plunge it into the neck of Beng Kher. The King staggered backward;
and before he could regain his equilibrium Bharata Rahon leaped
forward and gave him a tremendous shove, and King saw Beng Kher,
the ruler of Pnom Dhek, topple backward out of the howdah and
plunge to the ground below.</p>

<p>Horrified by the ruthless crime he had witnessed and moved by
the thought of Fou-tan's love for her father, King ordered his
mahout to bring their elephant to a stop; and then sliding quickly
from the howdah, he ran to where Beng Kher lay. The King was half
stunned and blood was gushing from the wound in his neck. As best
he could and as quickly, King stanched the flow; but what was he to
do? Beng Kher was indeed his prisoner, but what would it profit him
now?</p>

<p>He signalled his mahout to bring the elephant closer and make it
lie down, and then the two men lifted the wounded Beng Kher into
the howdah.</p>

<p>"What do you want with a wounded enemy?" demanded the mahout,
and it was evident to King that the fellow had not recognized Beng
Kher as King of Pnom Dhek. "Why do you not kill him?" continued the
man.</p>

<p>"You were detailed to drive my elephant and not to question my
acts," snapped King shortly, and whatever thoughts concerning the
matter the mahout had thereafter he kept to himself.</p>

<p>"Whither, my lord?" he asked presently.</p>

<p>That was the very question that was bothering
King&mdash;whither! Were he to take Beng Kher back to Lodidhapura,
he did not know but that Lodivarman might destroy him. If he tried
to take him back to Pnom Dhek, Beng Kher might die before they
reached the city, or if he lived, doubtless he would see that King
died shortly thereafter. The American had no love for Beng Kher,
but if he could protect Fou-tan from grief by saving the life of
her father, he would do so if he could but find the means; and
presently a possible solution of his problem occurred to him.</p>

<p>He turned to his mahout. "I wish to go to the jungle south of
Lodidhapura, avoiding the city and all men upon the way. Do you
understand?"</p>

<p>"Yes, my lord," replied the man.</p>

<p>"Then make haste. I must reach a certain spot before dark. When
we have passed Lodidhapura I will give you further directions."</p>

<p>Little Uda was playing before the dwelling of Che and Kangrey
when he heard a sound that was familiar to him&mdash;the approach
of an elephant along the jungle trail that passed not far from
where he played. Now and then elephants passed that way and
sometimes little Uda saw them, but more often he did not. Uda and
Che and Kangrey had no fear of these passing elephants, for the
massive stone ruin in which they lived was off the beaten trail
among a jumble of fallen ruins that was little likely to tempt the
feet of the great pachyderms; so little Uda played on, giving scant
heed to the approaching footsteps, but presently his keen ears
noted what his eyes could not see; and leaping to his feet, he ran
quickly into the dwelling, where Kangrey was preparing food for the
evening meal before the return of Che.</p>

<p>"Mamma," cried Uda, "an elephant is coming. He has left the
trail and is coming here."</p>

<p>Kangrey stepped to the doorway. To her astonishment she saw an
elephant coming straight toward her dwelling. She only saw his feet
and legs at first; and then, as he emerged from behind a tree that
had hidden the upper part of his body, the woman gave a cry of
alarm, for she saw that the elephant was driven by a mahout and
that there was a warrior in the howdah upon its back. Grasping Uda
by the hand, she sprang from her dwelling, bent upon escaping from
the feared power of Lodivarman; but a familiar voice halted her,
calling her by name.</p>

<p>"Do not be afraid, Kangrey," came the reassuring voice. "It is
I, Gordon King."</p>

<p>The woman stopped and turned back, a smile of welcome upon her
face. "Thanks be to the gods that it is you, Gordon King, and not
another," she exclaimed. "But what brings you thus upon a great
elephant and in the livery of Lodivarman to the poor dwelling of
Kangrey?"</p>

<p>The mahout had brought the elephant to a stop now before
Kangrey's doorway, and at his command the great beast lowered its
huge body to the ground.</p>

<p>"I have brought a wounded warrior to you, Kangrey," said King,
"to be nursed back to life and health as once you nursed me," and
with the help of the mahout he lifted Beng Kher from the
howdah.</p>

<p>"For you, Gordon King, Kangrey would nurse Lodivarman himself,"
said the woman.</p>

<p>They carried Beng Kher into the dwelling and laid him upon a
pallet of dry grasses and leaves covered with the pelts of wild
animals. Together King and Kangrey removed the golden cuirass from
the fallen monarch. Taking off the rough bandages with which the
American had stanched the flow of blood and covered the wounds, the
woman bathed the gashes with water brought by Uda. Her deft fingers
worked lightly and quickly; and while she prepared new bandages she
sent Uda into the jungle to fetch certain leaves, which she laid
upon the wounds beneath the bandages.</p>

<p>The mahout had returned to his elephant; and as Kangrey and King
were kneeling upon opposite sides of the wounded man, Beng Kher
opened his eyes. For a moment they roved without comprehension
about the interior of the rude dwelling and from the face of the
woman leaning above him to that of the man, upon whom he noted the
harness of Lodivarman, and King saw that Beng Kher did not
recognize him.</p>

<p>"Where am I?" asked the wounded man. "What has happened? But I
need not ask. I fell in battle and I am a prisoner in the hands of
my enemy."</p>

<p>"No," replied King, "you are in the hands of friends, Beng Kher.
This woman will nurse you back to health; after that we shall
decide what is to be done."</p>

<p>"Who are you?" demanded Beng Kher, scrutinising the features of
his captor.</p>

<p>From beneath his cuirass and his leather tunic the American
withdrew a tiny ring that was suspended about his neck on a golden
chain, and when Beng Kher saw it he voiced an exclamation of
surprise.</p>

<p>"It is Fou-tan's," he said. "How came you by it, man?"</p>

<p>"Do you not recognize me?" demanded the American.</p>

<p>"By Siva, you are the strange warrior who dared aspire to the
love of the Princess of Pnom Dhek. The gods have deserted me."</p>

<p>"Why do you say that?" demanded King. "I think they have been
damn good to you."</p>

<p>"They have delivered me into the hands of one who may profit
most by destroying me," replied Beng Kher.</p>

<p>"On the contrary, they have been kind to you, for they have
given you into the keeping of the man who loves your daughter. That
love, Beng Kher, is your shield and your buckler. It has saved you
from death, and it will see that you are brought back to
health."</p>

<p>For a while the King of Pnom Dhek lay silent, lost in
meditation, but presently he spoke again. "How came I to this sorry
pass?" he asked. "We were well out of the battle, Bharata Rahon and
I&mdash;by Siva, I remember now!" he exclaimed suddenly.</p>

<p>"I saw what happened, Beng Kher," said King. "I was pursuing you
and was but a short distance behind when I saw Bharata Rahon
suddenly stab you and then throw you from the howdah of your
elephant."</p>

<p>Beng Kher nodded. "I remember it all now," he said. "The
traitorous scoundrel! Fou-tan warned me against him, but I would
not believe her. There were others who warned me, but I was
stubborn. He thought he had killed me, eh? but he has not. I shall
recover and have my revenge, but it will be too late to save
Fou-tan."</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" demanded Gordon King.</p>

<p>"I can see his plan now as plainly as though he had told me in
his own words," said Beng Kher. "By now he is on his way to Pnom
Dhek. He will tell them that I fell in battle. He will force
Fou-tan to marry him, and thus he will become King of Pnom Dhek.
Ah, if I had but one of my own people here I could thwart him
yet."</p>

<p>"I am here," said Gordon King, "and it means more to me to
prevent Bharata Rahon from carrying out his design than it could to
any other man." He rose to his feet.</p>

<p>"Where are you going?" demanded Beng Kher.</p>

<p>"I am going to Pnom Dhek," replied King, "and if I am not too
late I shall save Fou-tan; and if I am, I shall make her a
widow."</p>

<p>"Wait," said Beng Kher. He slipped a massive ring from one of
his fingers and held it out to the American. "Take this," he said.
"In Phom Dhek it will confer upon you the authority of Beng Kher,
the King. Use it as you see fit to save Fou-tan and to bring
Bharata Rahon to justice. Farewell, Gordon King, and may the gods
protect you and give you strength."</p>

<p>Gordon King ran from the dwelling and leaped into the howdah of
his elephant. "Back to Lodidhapura," he commanded the mahout, "and
by the shortest route as fast as the beast can travel."</p>

<h2><a name="ch16" id="ch16">XVI. &mdash; IN THE PALACE OF BENG
KHER</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">Lodivarman, the King, was resting after the battle
that had brought victory to his arms. Never had he been in a
happier mood; never had the gods been so kind to him. Free from the
clutches of the loathsome disease that had gripped him for so many
years and now victorious over his ancient enemy, Lodivarman had
good reason for rejoicing. Yet there was a shadow upon his
happiness, for he had lost many brave soldiers and officers during
the engagement, and not the least of these was the new prince,
Gordon King, whom he looked upon not only as his saviour, but as
his protector from disease in the future. At his orders many men
had searched the battlefield for the body of his erstwhile enemy,
whom he now considered his most cherished captain; but no trace of
it had been found, nor of his elephant nor his mahout; and it was
the consensus of opinion that the beast, frenzied by wounds and
terrified by the din of conflict, had bolted into the forest and
that both men had been killed as the elephant plunged beneath the
branches of great trees. A hundred warriors still were searching
through the jungle, but no word had come from them. There could be
but slight hope that the new prince lived.</p>

<p>While Lodivarman lay upon his royal couch, grieving perhaps more
for himself than for Gordon King, a palace functionary was
announced. "Admit him," said Lodivarman.</p>

<p>The courtier entered the apartment and dropped to one knee.
"What word bring you?" demanded the King.</p>

<p>"The prince, Gordon King, seeks audience with Lodivarman,"
announced the official.</p>

<p>"What?" demanded Lodivarman, raising himself to a sitting
position upon the edge of his couch. "He lives? He has
returned?"</p>

<p>"He is alive and unhurt, Your Majesty," replied the man.</p>

<p>"Fetch him at once," commanded Lodivarman, and a moment later
Gordon King was ushered into his presence.</p>

<p>"The gods have been kind indeed," said Lodivarman. "We thought
that you had fallen in battle."</p>

<p>"No," replied King. "I pursued the enemy too far into the
jungle, but in doing so I discovered something that means more to
me than my life, Lodivarman, and I have come to you to enlist your
aid."</p>

<p>"You have but to ask and it shall be granted," replied the
King.</p>

<p>"The prince, Bharata Rahon, of Pnom Dhek, assassinated Beng Kher
and is now hastening back to Pnom Dhek to force the Princess,
Fou-tan, to wed him; and I have hastened to you to ask for men and
elephants wherewith I may pursue Bharata Rahon and save Fou-tan
from his treachery."</p>

<p>Perhaps this was a bitter pill for Lodivarman to swallow, for no
man, not even a king, may easily forget humiliation&mdash;perhaps a
king least of all&mdash;and he did not like to be reminded that
Fou-tan had spurned him and that this man had taken her from him.
But more powerful than his chagrin was his sincere gratitude to
Gordon King, and so it is only fair to record that he did not
hesitate an instant when he had heard the American's request.</p>

<p>"You shall have everything that you require&mdash;warriors,
elephants, everything. You have heard?" he demanded, turning to an
official standing near him.</p>

<p>The man nodded. "It is the King's command, then," continued
Lodivarman, "that the prince be furnished at once with all he
requires."</p>

<p>"A hundred elephants and five hundred men will answer my
purpose," said King, "the swiftest elephants and the bravest
warriors."</p>

<p>"You shall have them," said Lodivarman.</p>

<p>"I thank Your Majesty," said King. "And now permit me to depart,
for if I am to be successful there is no time to lose."</p>

<p>"Go," said Lodivarman, "and may the gods accompany you."</p>

<p>Within the hour a hundred elephants and five hundred warriors
swung through the north gate of Lodidhapura along the broad avenue
beyond and into the jungle.</p>

<p>Far to the north, hastening through the forest to Pnom Dhek,
moved Beng Kher's defeated army; and in the van was the Prince,
Bharata Rahon, gloating in anticipation over the fruits of his
villainy. Already was he demanding and receiving the rights and
prerogatives of royalty, for he had spread the word that Beng Kher
had been killed in battle and that he was hastening to Pnom Dhek to
wed the Princess Fou-tan.</p>

<p>Early in the forenoon of the second day following the battle,
Fou-tan, from her palace window, saw the column of returning
elephants and warriors emerge from the forest. That the trumpets
and the drums were mute told her that defeat had fallen upon the
forces of the King, her father, and there were tears in her eyes as
she turned away from the window and threw herself upon her
couch.</p>

<p>Perhaps an hour later one of her little ladies-in-waiting came
to her. "The Prince, Bharata Rahon, awaits you in the audience
chamber, my Princess," she said.</p>

<p>"Has not my father, the King, sent for me?" demanded
Fou-tan.</p>

<p>"The Prince brings word from your father," replied the girl, and
there was that in her tone more than in her words that sent a qualm
of apprehension through the heart of the little Princess.</p>

<p>She arose quickly. "Send word to Bharata Rahon, the Prince, that
the Princess comes," she said. Quickly her slaves attended to her
toilet, removing the traces that the tears had left and replacing
the loosened strands of her hair.</p>

<p>In the corridor outside of her apartment awaited the
functionaries that would accompany her to the audience chamber and
Indra Sen in command of a detachment of the warriors of her guard,
for the little Princess Fou-tan moved only with pomp and
ceremony.</p>

<p>Through her own private entrance she came into the audience
chamber, where she saw congregated the high officers of Pnom Dhek,
the priests of the temple, and the captains in their burnished
cuirasses and helmets; and as she came they knelt until she had
reached the foot of the empty throne, where Bharata Rahon stood to
receive her.</p>

<p>"Where is the King, my father?" she asked in a frightened
voice.</p>

<p>"Beloved Princess," replied Bharata Rahon, "I bring you sad
news."</p>

<p>"The King is dead!" cried Fou-tan.</p>

<p>Bharata Rahon inclined his head in assent. "He fell in battle
bravely," he said, "but before he died he entrusted to me his last
command to you."</p>

<p>"Speak," said the girl.</p>

<p>"It is believed that Lodivarman will follow up his victory and
attack Pnom Dhek, and in addition to this we are threatened by
enemies within our own walls&mdash;conditions which require a king
upon the throne; and so it was your father's dying command that you
wed at once, that Pnom Dhek may be ruled and guided by a man
through the dangers which confront her."</p>

<p>"And the man that I am to marry is you, of course," said Fou-tan
coldly.</p>

<p>"Who other could it be, my Princess?" asked Bharata Rahon.</p>

<p>"This is a matter which I do not care to discuss in public
audience," said Fou-tan. "After a suitable period of mourning for
my father, the King, we may perhaps speak of the matter again."</p>

<p>Bharata Rahon quelled the anger that arose in his heart and
spoke in soft tones. "I can well appreciate the feelings of Your
Majesty at this time," he said, "but the matter is urgent. Please
dismiss everyone and listen to me in patience for a moment."</p>

<p>"Send them away then," said Fou-tan wearily, and when the
audience chamber had been cleared, she nodded to Bharata Rahon.
"Speak," she said, "but please be brief."</p>

<p>"Fou-tan," said the Prince, "I would that you would wed me
willingly, but the time now has passed for all childishness. We
must be wed tonight. It is imperative. I can be King without you,
for I have the men and the power. But there are others who would
rally around you, and Pnom Dhek would be so weakened by civil war
that it would fall an easy prey to Lodivarman. Tonight in this hall
the high priest shall wed us, if it is necessary to drag you here
by force."</p>

<p>"It will be by force then," said Fou-tan, and, rising, she
called to her guard that stood waiting just beyond the doorway.</p>

<p>"By force then," snapped Bharata Rahon, "and you will see how
easily it may be done." As he spoke he pointed to the guardsmen
entering the audience chamber to escort Fou-tan to her
quarters.</p>

<p>"These are not my men," she cried. "Where is Indra Sen? Where
are the warriors of my guard?"</p>

<p>"They have been dismissed, Fou-tan," replied Bharata Rahon. "The
future King of Pnom Dhek will guard his Queen with his own
men."</p>

<p>The Princess Fou-tan made no reply as, surrounded by the
soldiers of Bharata Rahon, she left the audience chamber and
returned to her own apartment, where a new surprise and indignity
awaited her. Her slaves and even her ladies-in-waiting had been
replaced by women from the palace of Bharata Rahon.</p>

<p>Her case seemed hopeless. Even the high priest, to whom in her
extremity she might have turned for succor, would be deaf to her
appeal, for he was bound by ties of blood to the house of Bharata
Rahon and would be the willing and eager tool of his kinsman.</p>

<p>"There is only one," she murmured to herself, "and he is far
away. Perhaps, even, he is dead. Would that I, too, were dead." And
then she recalled what Bharata Rahon had said of the great danger
that menaced Pnom Dhek, and her breast was torn by conflicting
fears, which were lighted by no faintest ray of hope or
happiness.</p>

<p>All during the long hours that followed, Fou-tan sought for some
plan of escape from her predicament; but at every turn she was
thwarted, for when she sought to send a message to Indra Sen,
summoning him to her, and to other officials of the palace and the
state whom she knew to be friendly to her, she found she was
virtually a prisoner and that no message could be delivered by her
except through Bharata Rahon, nor could she leave her apartment
without his permission.</p>

<p>She might have melted into tears in her grief and anger, but the
Princess of Pnom Dhek was made of sterner stuff. Through the long
hours she sat in silence while slaves prepared her for the nuptial
ceremony; and when at last the hour arrived, it was no little
weeping queen that was escorted through the corridors of the palace
toward the great audience chamber where the ceremony was to be
performed, but a resentful, angry little queen with steel in her
heart and another bit of shining, sharpened steel hidden in the
folds of her wedding gown; and on her lips was a whispered plea to
Siva, the Destroyer, to give her the strength to plunge the slim
blade into the heart of Bharata Rahon or into her own before
morning dawned again.</p>

<p>Through the dark forest from the south moved a hundred
elephants, their howdahs filled with grim, half-savage warriors. At
their head rode Gordon King chafing at the slow pace which the
darkness and the dangers of the jungle imposed upon them.</p>

<p>Riding the howdah with King was an officer who knew well the
country around Pnom Dhek and he it was who directed the mahout
through the night. Presently he caused the elephant to be
halted.</p>

<p>"We are nearing Pnom Dhek now," he said, "and are very close to
the point upon the trail which you described to me."</p>

<p>"Bring the torch then and come with me," said King, and together
the two men descended to the ground where the officer lighted the
flare and handed it to King.</p>

<p>Moving slowly along the trail, the American carefully examined
the trees at his left, and within a hundred yards of the point at
which they had left the column he halted.</p>

<p>"Here it is," he said. "Go and fetch the warriors, dismounted.
Direct the mahouts to hold the elephants here until we return or
until they receive further orders from me. Make haste. I shall
await you here."</p>

<p>In the great assembly hall of the palace of Beng Kher were
gathered the nobles of Pnom Dhek. The captains and the priests were
there in glittering armour and gorgeous vestments, their women
resplendent in silks and scintillating gems. Upon a raised dais the
Prince Bharata Rahon and the Princess Fou-tan were seated upon
thrones. The high priest of Siva stood between them, while massed
in a half-circle behind them stood the nobles of the house of
Bharata Rahon and the glittering warriors, who were their
retainers. Among these was none of Fou-tan's allies. Neither Indra
Sen nor any other officer or man of her personal guard was in the
audience chamber, nor had she seen or heard aught of these since
she had been conducted to the audience chamber in the morning. She
wondered what fate had befallen them, and her heart was filled with
fear for their safety, realizing as well she might the extremes to
which Bharata Rahon might go in his ruthless greed for power.</p>

<p>Before the dais the apsaras were dancing to drum and
xylophone, cymbal and flute. The little dancers, nude above the
waist, stepped and postured through the long ritual of the sacred
dance; but Fou-tan, though her eyes stared down upon them, did not
see them. All that she saw was the figure of a warrior in battered
brass&mdash;a warrior with bronzed skin and clear eyes, who had
held her in his arms and spoken words of love into her ear. Where
was he? He had told Indra Sen that he would never leave the jungle,
that always he would be near; and Indra Sen had repeated his words
to Fou-tan&mdash;words that she had cherished in her heart above
all the jewels of memory. How close he seemed to-night! Never since
he had departed had Fou-tan so felt his presence hovering near, nor
ever had she so needed him. With a quick, short sigh that was half
a gasp she shook herself into a realization of the futility of her
dreams. Now she saw the apsaras. Their dance was drawing to a
close. When it was over the high priest and his acolytes would
initiate the ceremony that would make Fou-tan the wife of Bharata
Rahon and give Pnom Dhek a new king.</p>

<p>As the girl shuddered at the thought and her fingers closed upon
the hilt of the dagger beneath her gorgeous robe, a man stumbled
through the darkness of the night toward the outer walls of Pnom
Dhek; and behind him, silent as specters from another world, came
five hundred brass-bound men-at-arms.</p>

<p>No light guided them now, for they were approaching the guarded
walls of the city; but so indelibly fixed in the memory of Gordon
King was this way which he had traversed but once before that he
needed no light. Into the mouth of a shallow ravine he led his
warriors; and toward its head, where the wall of Pnom Dhek crossed
it, he found a little doorway, well hidden by shrubbery and vines.
So well hidden was this secret passage, planned by some long dead
king, that no bar secured the door that closed its entrance&mdash;a
precaution made necessary, doubtless to satisfy the requirements of
a king who might find it necessary to enter as well as to leave the
city in haste and secrecy. But whatever the reason it was a godsend
this night to Gordon King as he led his spearmen and his archers
beneath the city of Pnom Dhek toward the palace of Beng Kher.</p>

<p>Once safely within the corridor, they lighted their torches; and
in the flickering, smoky flame the column moved noiselessly toward
its destination. They had gone a considerable distance passing the
openings to other corridors and to dark chambers that flanked their
line of march, when Gordon King was confronted by the disheartening
realization that he had lost his way. He knew that when Indra Sen
and Hamar had led him from the palace they had not passed through
any corridor resembling that in which he now found himself. For the
moment his heart sank, and his high hopes waned.</p>

<p>To be lost in this labyrinthine maze beneath the palace and the
city was not only discouraging but might well prove fatal to his
plan and, perhaps, to the safety and the lives of his command. He
felt that he must keep the truth from his followers as long as
possible, lest the effect upon their morale might prove disastrous;
and so he moved boldly on, trusting that chance would guide him to
a stairway leading to the level of the ground above.</p>

<p>His mind was harassed by unhappy apprehensions concerning
Fou-tan. He was obsessed by the conviction that she was in dire and
imminent peril, and the thought left him frantic because of his
helplessness.</p>

<p>Such was his state of mind when, as he was passing along a
corridor flanked on either side by dark and gloomy doorways, he saw
that the passageway he was following ended at a transverse
corridor. Which way should he turn? He knew that he could not
hesitate, and at that moment he heard a voice calling his name from
the interior of a dark cell beyond one of the gloomy doorways.</p>

<p>King halted as did the men near him, startled and apprehensive,
their weapons ready. King stepped toward the doorway from which the
voice had come.</p>

<p>"Who speaks?" he demanded.</p>

<p>"It is I&mdash;Indra Sen," replied the voice, and with a sigh of
relief that was almost a gasp King stepped quickly to the low
doorway.</p>

<p>The light of his torch illuminated a narrow cell, upon the floor
of which squatted Indra Sen, chained to the wall.</p>

<p>"May the gods be thanked that you have come, Gordon King," cried
the young Khmer officer; "and may they grant that you are not too
late to prevent a tragedy."</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" demanded King.</p>

<p>"Fou-tan is to be forced to wed Bharata Rahon tonight," replied
Indra Sen. "Perhaps the ceremony already has been performed. All
those whose duty it is to defend Fou-tan have been chained in the
dungeon here."</p>

<p>"Where is the ceremony to be performed?" demanded King.</p>

<p>"In the great audience chamber," replied Indra Sen.</p>

<p>"Can you lead me there by the shortest route?"</p>

<p>"Take off my fetters and those of my men and I will not only
lead you, but we will strike with you in the service of our
Princess."</p>

<p>"Good!" exclaimed Gordon King. "Where are your men?"</p>

<p>"Along both sides of this corridor."</p>

<p>To release them all was the work of but a few moments, for
willing hands, and strong, struck off the fetters; and then,
directed by Indra Sen, the party moved quickly on to its work. The
warriors of Fou-tan's guard had no weapons other than their bare
hands and the hatred that was in their hearts, but once within the
audience chamber they knew that they would find weapons upon the
bodies of their antagonists.</p>

<p>The high priest of Siva stepped forward and, turning, faced
Bharata Rahon and Fou-tan. "Arise," he said, "and kneel."</p>

<p>Bharata Rahon stepped from his throne half-turning to await
Fou-tan, but the girl sat rigid on her carved chair.</p>

<p>"Come," whispered Bharata Rahon.</p>

<p>"I cannot," said Fou-tan, addressing the high priest.</p>

<p>"You must, my Princess," urged the priest.</p>

<p>"I loathe him. I cannot mate with him."</p>

<p>Bharata Rahon stepped quickly toward her. His lips were smiling
for the benefit of those who watched from below the dais; but in
his heart was rage, and cruel was the grip that he laid upon the
gentle wrist of Fou-tan.</p>

<p>"Come," he hissed, "or by the gods you shall be slain, and I
shall rule alone."</p>

<p>"Then slay me," said Fou-tan. But he dragged her to her feet;
and those below saw his smiling face and thought that he was merely
assisting the little Princess, who had been momentarily overcome by
the excitement of the occasion.</p>

<p>And then a great hanging parted at the rear of the dais behind
the throne, and a warrior stepped out behind the semicircle of
those that half-surrounded Bharata Rahon and his unwilling bride.
Perhaps some in the audience saw the tall warrior; perhaps at the
instant they were moved to surprise, but before they could give an
alarm, or before they could realize that an alarm was necessary, he
had shouldered his way roughly through the cordon of warriors
standing between him and the three principals at the front of the
dais, and behind him the doorway through which he had come spewed a
torrent of hostile warriors.</p>

<p>Cries of alarm arose simultaneously from the audience and from
the warriors of Bharata Rahon who stood upon the dais, and above
all in sudden fury burst the war-cry of Lodidhapura.</p>

<p>Simultaneously Bharata Rahon and Fou-tan wheeled about and
instantly recognized Gordon King, but with what opposite
emotions!</p>

<p>With a curse Bharata Rahon drew his sword. A dozen spearmen
leaped toward the rash intruder only to be hurled back by the
warriors of Lodidhapura and the unarmed soldiers of Fou-tan's
guard, led by Indra Sen.</p>

<p>"Dog of a slave!" cried Bharata Rahon, as the two men stood face
to face, and at the same time he swung a heavy blow at King's
helmet&mdash;a blow that King parried and returned so swiftly that
the Khmer prince had no defence ready.</p>

<p>It was a fearful blow that Gordon King struck, for love of a
princess and to avenge a king. Down through the golden helmet of
the false prince his blade clove into the brain of Bharata Rahon;
and as the body lunged forward upon the dais, King swung around to
face whatever other antagonist might menace him. But he found
himself entirely surrounded by his own warriors, and a quick glance
about the audience chamber showed him that his orders had been
followed to the letter. So quickly had they moved that at every
entrance now stood a company of his brass-bound soldiers.</p>

<p>There had been little resistance, for so sudden had been the
attack and so overwhelming the surprise of the men of Pnom Dhek
that those in the audience chamber had been completely surrounded
by a superior force before many of them had realized what was
happening.</p>

<p>Indra Sen and his warriors had succeeded in wresting weapons
from the men of Bharata Rahon, and with them King now dominated the
situation, at least in the audience chamber; though in the city
without were thousands of warriors who might easily overcome them.
But this King had foreseen and had no intention of permitting.</p>

<p>Turning toward the surprised men and women in the audience
chamber, he raised his hand. "Silence!" he cried. "Let no man raise
a weapon against us, and none shall be harmed. I came here not to
attack Pnom Dhek but to avenge her King. Beng Kher did not fall in
battle; he was stabbed by Bharata Rahon. He is not dead. Beng Kher
is still King of Pnom Dhek."</p>

<p>A cheer arose from Indra Sen and his warriors, in which joined
many in the audience chamber, for with Bharata Rahon dead they no
longer feared him and quickly returned their allegiance to their
King.</p>

<p>Fou-tan came close to the tall warrior standing there beside the
body of Bharata Rahon and facing the officers and the dignitaries
of the court of Beng Kher. She touched him gently. "My Gordon
King!" she whispered. "I knew that you were near. I knew that you
would come. But tell me again that my father is not dead and that
he is safe."</p>

<p>"He is wounded, Fou-tan; but I have left him with honest people
who will nurse him, the same who nursed me when I was lost and ill
in the jungle. He sent me here to save you from Bharata Rahon,
though I would have come without the sending. Here is the priest,
Fou-tan, and you are in your wedding-gown. Is it in your heart to
deny me again?"</p>

<p>"What would my father say?" she murmured, hesitatingly, and then
suddenly she raised her head proudly. "He is not here, and I am
Queen!" she exclaimed. "I care not what any man may say. If you
will have me, Gordon King, I am yours!"</p>

<p>King turned toward the audience. "The scene is set for a
wedding," he said in clear tones. "The priest is here; the bride is
ready. Let the ceremony proceed."</p>

<p>"But the groom is dead!" cried one of Bharata Rahon's
lieutenants.</p>

<p>"I am the groom," said King.</p>

<p>"Never!" cried another voice. "You are naught but a
Lodidhapurian slave."</p>

<p>"He is neither slave nor Lodidhapurian," said Fou-tan. "He is
the man of my choice, and tonight I am Queen."</p>

<p>"Never! Never!" shouted many voices.</p>

<p>"Listen!" exclaimed the American. "It is not within your power
to dictate, for tonight the Princess Fou-tan is Queen; and I am
your conqueror."</p>

<p>"You are already surrounded by the soldiers of Beng Kher," said
the partisan of Bharata Rahon who had before spoken. "Several
escaped the audience chamber when your men entered, and already
they have taken word to the warriors in the barracks. Presently
they will come and you and your warriors will be destroyed."</p>

<p>"Perhaps," assented King; "but with us, then, shall die every
man in this room, for I hold you as hostages to ensure our safety.
If you are wise you will send a messenger at once to order your
warriors to return to their barracks." And then to his own warriors
he cried: "If a single warrior of Pnom Dhek enters this apartment
without my authority, you will fall upon those here and slay them
to a man, sparing only the women. And if my word is not sufficient
I bring you the authority of your own King," and with that he
displayed the King's ring, where all might see it.</p>

<p>Beaten at every turn, the followers of Bharata Rahon were forced
to accept the inevitable, while those who had hated him were
secretly delighted now that they were assured that both the
Princess and the King had vouched for this strange warrior. Then in
the great audience chamber of the Khmer King, Beng Kher, Fou-tan
the Princess, dancing girl of the Leper King, was joined to the man
she loved.</p>

<h2><a name="ch17" id="ch17">XVII.&mdash; CONCLUSION</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">That night, for the first time in a thousand years
perhaps, the soldiers of Lodidhapura and the soldiers of Pnom Dhek
sat at the same board and laughed and joked and swore strange oaths
and feasted and drank together; and the soldiers of Lodidhapura
bragged of the prowess of their Prince, who single-handed and armed
only with javelin had slain My Lord the Tiger; and the soldiers of
Pnom Dhek boasted of the beauty of their Princess until presently
those who were not sleeping beneath the table were weeping upon one
another's brass cuirasses, so that when morning broke it was with
aching heads that the soldiers of Lodidhapura climbed into the
howdahs upon their great elephants and started back upon their
homeward journey.</p>

<p>At the same time a strong force from Pnom Dhek, including many
high officials of the court, together with the Princess Fou-tan and
Gordon King, mounted upon swift elephants, set out through the
jungle toward the dwelling of Che and Kangrey.</p>

<p>Upon the afternoon of the second day they reached their
destination. Che and Kangrey and little Uda were overcome by the
magnificence of the spectacle that burst suddenly upon their simple
and astonished gaze; nor were they entirely free from apprehension
until they had made sure that Gordon King was there to protect
them.</p>

<p>"How is the patient, Kangrey?" asked King.</p>

<p>The woman shook her head. "He does not mend," she said.</p>

<p>Together Fou-tan and Gordon King, accompanied by the high priest
of Siva from Pnom Dhek and several of the highest officers of the
court, entered the simple dwelling.</p>

<p>Beng Kher lay stretched upon his mean cot of straw and hides.
His eyes lighted as they rested upon Fou-tan, who ran forward and
kneeled beside him. The old warrior took her in his arms and
pressed her to him, and though he was very weak he insisted that
she tell him all that had transpired since King had left him to
return to Pnom Dhek.</p>

<p>When she had finished, he sighed and stroked her hair; and when
he motioned to Gordon King, and the man came and knelt at Fou-tan's
side, Beng Kher took their hands in his.</p>

<p>"Siva has been kind to me in my last hour," he said. "He has
saved Pnom Dhek and Fou-tan from the traitor, and he has given me a
new son to rule when I am dead. All praise be to Siva."</p>

<p>The King, Beng Kher, closed his eyes. A tremor passed through
his frame, which seemed suddenly to shrink and lie very still.</p>

<p>Gordon King lifted the weeping Fou-tan to her feet. The highest
officer of the Khmer court came and knelt before them. He took the
hand of Gordon King in his and pressed it to his lips. "I salute
the son of Beng Kher," he said, "the new King of Pnom Dhek."</p>
