<h1>CHAPTER I</h1>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>In the darkness of the country road after midnight the car was
speeding, but the three young men jammed together in the one seat
did not worry. They were exhilarated by the violence of the
speeches they had heard at the strikers' mass meeting in the
factory town of Cathay. When the car skidded slightly on a turn
and the left-hand wheels crunched on the gravelled shoulder, the
driver yelped, 'Hey, whoa-up!' But she did not whoa-up.</p>

<p>They were not drunk, except with high spirits. They had had a
few bottles of beer, but what intoxicated them was the drama of
thick-necked, bright-eyed strike leaders denouncing the tyranny
of the bosses, the press, the taxpayers and all other oppressors.
Two of the young men were juniors in Truxon College, and as they
considered themselves to have been frequently and ludicrously
misjudged by their own bosses, their parents and professors, they
would (they told themselves) have stayed on in Cathay, joined the
picket line, brave with bricks and pick handles, and probably
have been gloriously killed, had it not been for a critically
important fraternity dance at Truxon next evening.</p>

<p>As a substitute for thus entering the martyrs' profession,
they now howled a song which stated that Labour was a Mighty
Giant which was going to smash all its foemen immediately.</p>

<p>The third young man did not sing with them. He was a radical
agitator; his name was Eugene Silga; he was slim and taut, with
skin the colour of a cigar; and he had had quite enough singing
in Cathay County Jail, a month ago. When the students stopped for
breath, he protested, in the easy voice of a professional
speaker, 'You seem to think it's going to be a cinch to overthrow
the exploiting capitalist class--your own class, remember, you
cursed sons of aristocrats. It's not! It'll take a lot more than
singing to make Wall Street apologize to the Proletariat and go
crawl in a hole.'</p>

<p>'Hurray! Wall Street in a hole! Lez go dig the hole!' bawled
the driver.</p>

<p>This driver was a tall, wide young man, with wavy hair of red
gold, a Norse god with eyes like the Baltic Sea in summer, and a
face handsome as a magazine cover and stupid as a domesticated
carp. His name was Howard Cornplow, and he was an adept in
football, in golf, and in finding reasons why, at any particular
recitation hour, he knew nothing whatever about the epistemology
of Plato's <i>Meno.</i> He did know a great deal about the crawl
stroke, however, which may have been just as well.</p>

<p>Howard Cornplow was a hearty young man, and he loved to argue.
Accelerating a little, occasionally looking away from the road
toward the agitator Silga, who sat in the dimness over beside the
right-hand door, he shouted, 'Oh, rats, Gene! Don't you think if
all us educated guys gang up on our folks, they'll snap out of
their fool ex-up-expropriating attitude?'</p>

<p>'I do not!'</p>

<p>'Now look here. You take my dad. Old Fred. I can argue him
down till he skips out and slams the door.'</p>

<p>As Howard continued, it was revealed that this 'dad', motor
dealer in the city of Sachem Falls, N.Y., was an acceptable
fellow, and that he was chronically overcome by his son's
eloquence. Just to clarify it, Howard gave samples of the
eloquence, and during the spirited recital he forgot that he was
driving an automobile, and at sixty-five miles an hour.</p>

<p>The other student, Guy Staybridge, scrawny, big-nosed,
spectacled, eager, wailed, 'Hey, watch what you're doing, will
you, young Cornplow?'</p>

<p>'Don't you worry. I'm a careful driver,' clucked the Norse
god, as he happily developed his theme that, in order to be
converted to loving communism, the stuffy, prosperous,
middle-class merchants like Fred Cornplow needed nothing more
than friendly tips from such up-to-date examples of the Youth
Movement as Howard Cornplow, Eugene Silga, and Guy Staybridge,
with a few explanations about how the economic system really
worked.</p>

<p>The car swayed on an abrupt turning. Howard kept it snugly to
the right. But this was an S-curve, and as Howard looked away
from the road towards Eugene, accelerating a little in his
triumphant high spirits, the car, in a hundredth of a second, in
a madness of speed that had nothing to do with time by the watch,
bolted across the ditch, bounded on turf, twisted--crushing the
three young men closer together--half swung around, grazed a
birch tree, smashed a fender and a headlight and half the hood,
and came up short, while the huddle of three were jerked
sidewise, then hurled toward the windshield.</p>

<p>Instantly, an incredible silence of night. The car's lights
were gone. Stillness and darkness clothed them in unreality.
Nothing had happened. They were dead, worried Eugene Silga, as
slowly he came to believe that he was not dead.</p>

<p>He was on his hands and knees on the wet turf of early winter;
his cheek seemed to be bleeding, and his left shoulder stung; he
could feel that his sleeves had been slashed to rags. But Gene
Silga had been through riots, through club and paving-stone
battles between strikers and policemen; he had been beaten by
deputies; he was a veteran; and for all the reeking ache of his
shoulder, he was not hysterical as he decided that the right-hand
door must have burst open and himself been hurled out. He crawled
to his feet, more conscious of the cold grass than of his pain,
and sloped toward the car. No sound save hoarse breathing in this
obscene silence.</p>

<p>He lit a cigar lighter--it was a trinket of gold--foppish and
expensive for an agitator like Gene Silga; and the wife of a
cement manufacturer had given it to him when he was abetting a
strike against her husband. He saw that Howard Cornplow and Guy
Staybridge were bleeding from cut foreheads, both of them
unconscious, both alive.</p>

<p>He felt them over. He quietly set the flaming cigar lighter in
a crevice of the crumpled dashboard, and with his handkerchief
and others from the boys' pockets, bound their heads. He tugged
Howard out of the car and laid him on the earth, his own coat
under the Norse god's head. He propped up Guy in the seat. He
stepped down from the running board, wincing as, to his sick
fancy, his shoulder seemed to howl with pain. He staggered into
the road and looked methodically back and ahead.</p>

<p>He made out a tiny light back along the road and went swaying
toward it, his thin hand pressed tight to his shoulder. As he
plodded, he hummed the 'Internationale', though it was punctuated
with small groans.</p>

<p>The source of the light was a farmhouse, a bulk of
darkness--and instantly there was a hateful dog pattering toward
him, snarling. Gene kicked to right and left, felt a stone with
his toe, stooped, cringing with pain, to pick up the stone, and
marched on to meet the coming dog . . . For more than a year,
once, Gene had been a hobo and learned the harsh wisdom of
outfacing dangers: deppities and railroad dicks and their
relatives, the savage dogs. He gushed, in the tone of a spinster
lady addressing her Pekinese: 'Why Towser I'm tho ashamed of you!
Don't oo remember oo's old friend Gene, oo sweet dirty son of a
so and so, darling?'</p>

<p>The dog was puzzled. In a truce, but a truce still armed, it
sniffed at Gene and followed him to the farmhouse door, from
which an old man was peering.</p>

<p>Gene droned, 'Motor accident--smash-up--got a telephone I can
use?'</p>

<p>'Guess so. Thought I heard a crash. Come in, boy.'</p>

<p>Gene telephoned on to Truxon village, site of the college, for
an ambulance, a doctor. When he turned, the farmer called from an
adjoining room, 'Be right with you, soon 's I dress.'</p>

<p>'Thanks, sir. I'll go ahead.'</p>

<p>'Want a flashlight?'</p>

<p>The question seemed to stir in Gene Silga some startling
thought, and he sounded doubtful as he muttered, 'Oh. Oh, sure,
you bet. Thanks.'</p>

<p>He was too reflective, as he trembled out of the house, to pay
much heed to the still grumbling dog; he absently patted its
head, while its tail wagged as finally it recognized a fellow
killer.</p>

<p>On his way to the car, Gene thought angrily: 'Well, why not?
Why shouldn't I? These snobs like Howard--oh, they'll buy you a
dinner, yes, with beer and highballs, if they've recently gouged
any money out of their slave-drivers of dads. That's so they can
show off how liberal and brave they are. But do they care a hoot
whether an organizer has one cent for breakfast--whether you
sleep in a lousy lodging house--whether you have to hitch-hike to
the next town? They do not! They've got to be <i>made</i> to
care, and to pay. It's not for me personally. It's for the
Revolution . . . Stealing? . . . Nothing but a word. One of my
last holdovers from bourgeois morals . . . Didn't Stalin
himself,' and mentally, Gene crossed himself, 'didn't he rob
banks, as a youngster, to get money for the Cause? . . . Of
course I'll do it.'</p>

<p>He had reached the wrecked car.</p>

<p>He ran the glow of the flashlight over Howard and Guy
Staybridge. They were still out. With fingers sensitive as those
of a miniature painter, or even a pickpocket, he searched them.
From inside Howard's coat he took a billfold which contained
three ten-dollar bills, six ones and a five. He removed one ten
and three ones; with precise care he folded them small and tucked
them into his shoe; and more delicately than ever he slid the
billfold back into the pocket where (but only according to
outmoded bourgeois ethics, of course) it belonged.</p>

<p>He examined Howard's bandage, straightened it a little, and
sat on the running board till the farmer and the ambulance should
come. He had already forgotten the pleasant addition to his war
chest. He was thinking of the editorial on the flimsiness of
college courses in economics which he was going to write as soon
as he succeeded in founding a communist magazine.</p>

<p>The farmer loomed up, grunted, looked, exhibited the proper
pleasure at seeing a real accident so near his hearthstone, made
sure that he got his flashlight back from Gene and went away
after, surprisingly, asking no questions beyond: Who were these
three young men? Their occupations? Their parentage? Dates of
birth? Place of birth? Their opinions of Franklin D. Roosevelt?
And where had they been going, and why were they going so fast,
considering that the farmer himself never drove over 30
m.p.h.--though, course, it was true that he didn't have no car
like this Triumph Special, a dandy job that Special was, and how
many m.p.h. did Gene, upon reasoned opinion, think a Triumph
could do?</p>

<p>The coming ambulance smashed the grateful peace after the
farmer had gone his ways, provided with new breakfast
conversation.</p>

<p>The doctor in the Truxon ambulance found that there was among
the three young men no mortal injury: Howard Cornplow had a
superficial frontal cut and two ribs cracked against the steering
wheel; Guy Staybridge, a fractured arm and a contusion probably
not serious; Gene Silga, a broken shoulder-blade.</p>

<p>'Of course you young college geniuses . . .' began the
interne, on the front seat with Gene and the driver.</p>

<p>'I'm no young college genius. I got kicked out of City College
of New York six years ago, when I was twenty, for
insubordination: to wit, telling a prof that he was a fat-headed
grafter and beating up a tin soldier who tried to stop a pacifist
parade,' said Gene, in the gentlest of purrs.</p>

<p>'Well anyway, you young hell-raisers think you've got more zip
than four thousand pounds of steel and petrol. Anybody that ever
drives over forty miles an hour is a fool,' said the interne--as
the ambulance accelerated to fifty. Fretfully he added, to the
driver, 'Step on it, can't you? I got to get back to my poker
game. I need a little sleep, but, as I was telling you, what
could I do when I had a full house, and Doc Brady lays for me,
and seems he has four kinks, cold, and so I kep' raising him and
he raised back . . . What's the matter with this bus, anyway?
Crawls along like a steam-roller.'</p>

<h1>CHAPTER II</h1>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>To Frederick William Cornplow, this day was as another. The
round little man, district agent for Triumph and Houndtooth
automobiles in the Sachem Falls territory, had finished his
cornflakes and bacon and poached eggs, in the
scarlet-and-canary-yellow breakfast porch, which was not a porch,
when he was called to the telephone and learned that his son,
Howard, was in the hospital with injuries from a motor
accident.</p>

<p>'I'll be there right away,' answered Fred Cornplow evenly.</p>

<p>He told neither his good wife, Hazel, nor his daughter, Sara,
of the accident. For Hazel, who always drifted down to breakfast
late, a soft and smiling sleepyhead, he left a note, 'Had to
hustle office to see a man. F.'</p>

<p>The distance from his brick Colonial house, on the corner of
Fenimore Cooper Boulevard and Tuke Street, Sachem Falls, N.Y., to
the William Jackson Belch Infirmary, Truxon College, was seventy
and a half miles, with a good deal of factory trucking traffic.
He drove it in two hours flat. He got up to seventy on stretches,
but through villages he dropped to twenty-five. He was a veteran
driver and rigidly careful. He decidedly did not sing about
Labour being a giant or anything else. He did not think much of
Labour anyway. He employed it.</p>

<p>Through the drive, never taking his eyes from the road, he
alternately decided that Howard could not be badly hurt,
therefore Howard was a young fool and ought to have his car taken
away from him, and that Howard was nigh unto death, in which case
he was a superb driver whose accident was due to some
double-damned garage mechanic's carelessness with steering gear
or brakes . . . and that, in either case, the Norse god, with his
kinky copper hair and his easy smile, was his father's heart and
soul and means of immortality.</p>

<p>Fred jumped out at the Truxon infirmary, just back of the
white and pillared official residence of the college president,
and ran up the steps, but to the reception girl he said with
gravity, 'My name is Cornplow. I believe my son was injured in a
smash.'</p>

<p>'Oh yes. He's not badly hurt. The doctor isn't here, but I
think you can go in and see Mr. Cornplow--he's in Room E, with
some other stoodents.'</p>

<p>As Fred clumped up the linoleum-shining stairs, he reflected
that it was startling to hear Howard called 'Mr. Cornplow'. He,
Fredk Wm, was Mr. Cornplow. Howard--heck!--he was
<i>Howard!</i></p>

<p>He peeped into Room E, where, sunk on their pillows or sitting
on the edges of their beds, were six young men, all bandaged, all
pale, and all--in Fred's opinion--crazy as ticks, for they were
screaming their opinions (or the opinions of whichever newspaper
they happened to read) of Russia, Roosevelt, Manchuria,
backgammon, biochemistry, and the ham and cabbage at the college
dining hall.</p>

<p>Howard was on his back. As Fred walked between the rows of
beds, shy in the presence of these gilded young strangers,
irritated that he had been so yearningly sentimental all the way
from Sachem, Howard saw him and bellowed, 'Hello, Dad! Swell of
you to come. I'm O.K. Couple of ribs K.O.'d. They don't hurt
much, but gosh almighty, the doc insisted on putting a big, thick
adhesive-tape bandage on me, it's like a double-strength corset,
and wow, does it itch, ask me, <i>does</i> it, and the bandage so
thick you can't scratch through it, and say, I figure there's a
whole war manoeuvres going on underneath it--there's six
regiments of fleas and a troop of light-mounted lice and . .
.'</p>

<p>Fred sat on a chair by the bed and he, the round, the cheery,
the jesting salesman, was solemn, feeling that the other crocks
were inspecting this phenomenon, a Visiting Father. He
interrupted:</p>

<p>'How'd it happen?'</p>

<p>'Happen? Nobody could've avoided it. Car jumped the road and
hit a tree. And I was cold sober, and tending strictly to
business . . .'</p>

<p>'How fast?'</p>

<p>'Fast? You mean how fast was I going?'</p>

<p>'I do.'</p>

<p>'Oh, I dunno--not more 'n forty . . .'</p>

<p>'Or maybe sixty?'</p>

<p>'Well, you know--just a fair cruising speed. There was an
S-curve there--absolutely a disgrace--entirely the fault of the
county authorities--simply a crime--and when I get out of this,
I'm going to sue the county. Oh say, Dad, you know Guy
Staybridge, from Sachem, don't you--old hawkface, there in the
next bed?'</p>

<p>Fred bowed. Guy waggled a melancholy fingertip. 'Oh, yes--the
son of Putnam Staybridge?' Fred murmured.</p>

<p>'I--I understand so,' said Guy.</p>

<p>Fred was almost reverent. Like most Americans, he was
perfectly democratic, except, perhaps, as regards social
standing, wealth, political power, and club membership; but was
not Mr. Putnam Staybridge believed to be a descendant of the
<i>Mayflower?</i> Was he not the chief aristocrat of Sachem
Falls?</p>

<p>Howard was volleying on: 'Yessir, absolutely county
supervisors' fault, and they ought to be shown up. Just like all
governments, except in Russia--oppress the people and kill 'em by
tyranny and darn careless sloppiness. Dad, did you realize that
in the past year--and the Americans thinking <i>they're</i> so
efficient--the growth in production in heavy industry in the Ural
section of Russia has been two hundred and seventeen per
cent?'</p>

<p>'So? What is this "heavy industry"?'</p>

<p>'Heavy industry? Oh, you know. Darn it, I guess Gene
Silga--say, now I think of it, I wonder where they took Gene when
they brought us here, Guy?--but anyway, I don't believe Gene said
anything about what heavy industry does cover. It's machines and
so on, isn't it? What d'you think, Dad?'</p>

<p>Fred Cornplow, in the manner of a Roman candle on Fourth of
July evening, suddenly flowered and flamed in parental rage. But
he spoke so softly that not even Guy, in the next bed, could
overhear.</p>

<p>'Think? Think? I think you're a conceited, inconsiderate young
pup! I think you're so self-centred and so dog<i>gone</i>
satisfied with yourself that it never occurs to you to remember
how you might scare your mother and Sara and me, or how you hurt
our feelings! I think it would be a bright idea to keep your
scholarship marks from dropping about two hundred and seventeen
per cent per each and every doggone annum, instead of going
around feeling good because you've personally whooped up Soviet
production so doggone much. And finally, I suppose you'll expect
me to pay for having your car fixed after you've deliberately
been and gone and driven so carelessly that I know doggone well
you weren't keeping your eyes on the road and you ran off it! And
of course, pass the buck to the county--and to me, to get it
fixed!'</p>

<p>Howard's blue eyes of a young Balder, Norse godling of the
summer radiance, looked hurt.</p>

<p>'But gee, Dad, it won't cost so much, will it, if you have it
done in your own repair shop, at the agency?'</p>

<p>Fred was glaring now, and Howard begged, 'Gosh, honest, I
wasn't driving fast, Dad. I don't <i>think</i> I was. I'm awfully
sorry.'</p>

<p>'Grrrrr!' said Fredk Wm. For this was the third calamitous
accident Howard had achieved in two years, and each time Fred had
determined that it was his duty, finally, to say 'Grrrrr!'</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<center>
<h1>CHAPTER III</h1>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>'It might have been something I ate. That's what it was.
Prob'ly something I ate,' said Fred. 'Or maybe it was the snow
glare. Made me dizzy. Or prob'ly that cold I had last week. But
chances are,' and he spoke with solidity and conviction, 'it was
something I ate.'</p>

<p>He crawled from under the mountain range of bedclothes, he
rubbed his forehead, he scratched his ruddy moustache, which
resembled half a doughnut, he flapped his tongue in an interested
and speculative manner, he took a romantic position, eyes closed
and forefinger to temple, as befitted one who was importantly
ill, and he croaked, 'I'll bet it was the pie.'</p>

<p>'If you know just what you're talking about, dear, I'd be glad
of a tip on the subject,' sighed his wife, from the other twin
bed in their pink and creamy chamber.</p>

<p>'If I--if I <i>know--</i>what I'm talking about!' He was moved
to light a cigarette, though normally he was not one to sit in
his nightshirt, upon the edges of beds, after midnight, and toy
with cigarettes. 'Of course--of course. Man dying of pneumonia or
malaria or something--just dying, that's all--and all his family
is interested in is: "Does he know what he's talking about?"'</p>

<p>'Dear, I just meant. . . What is it, really?'</p>

<p>'I've got a fever.'</p>

<p>'You? A fever?'</p>

<p>'Yes, me. Not Sara, nor Howard, nor the cat, nor the maid's
second cousin's brother-in-law, but me! F-e-v-e-r!'</p>

<p>Hazel Cornplow, plump little wife of the plump little man,
climbed out of the misty layers of sleep in which she had been
nestling, out of the downy strata of the very best poplin and
blankets and foamy pink comforter, appropriate to this February
night, drowsily wrapped herself in something that was a cross
between, a feather boa and a Persian rug ($31.98 at Swazey &amp;
Lindbeck's, this past Christmas), and laid her plump, kind hand
on his forehead.</p>

<p>'My! It does seem hot!' she exulted, with the pleasure all
right-thinking persons feel in discovering that the best-beloved
is helpless and that we shall be allowed to manage him.</p>

<p>'Something I ate. Lunch at the Elks' Club,' he croaked,
ignorant of how fondly, in what he believed to be a grand and
impressive tantrum, he was looking at her.</p>

<p>'What did you have?'</p>

<p>'Well--you know--just an ordinary lunch--I was lunching with
Walter Lindbeck and Doc Kamerkink--we were talking about coddling
the unemployed. I said to the doc, "Where's this business going
to end, that's what I want to know;" and Walter says . . .'</p>

<p>'But what did you eat, dear?'</p>

<p>'Oh. Eat? Well, zy remember it, I had some corn soup, and I
wish to thunder you'd try to coax that hired girl to make it for
me oftener, no better soup made than a good corn soup with
<i>corn</i> in it, and I had couple pork chops and some pickled
beets and pickled watermelon rind and some cucumbers and some pie
<i>a la mode--</i>raisin pie it was, with orange ice on it. .
.'</p>

<p>Over Hazel's face--after slumber she looked not her
fifty-three, but a fresh thirty--quivered a grin.</p>

<p>Fred held up his hand like a traffic policeman and
protested:</p>

<p>'No! Wait! I know! I guess maybe it wasn't an entirely
sensible lunch. But still, I don't rate this awful fever just
from mixing up my grub a little. Are you going to sit there and
gabble while I'm practically dying, you might say?'</p>

<p>'Oh, I know, Fred. Listen. Sara's got a clinical thermometer
up in her room--she used it for something or other when she was
doing charity work in New York. It'll tell if you really feel
bad.'</p>

<p>'I don't need any clinical thermometer to tell me how I feel!
I just listen to the voice of my inner conscience, and it tells
me I feel like the wrath of God!'</p>

<p>'I'm not,' she said, with that power of ignoring chatter which
a professional wife develops after thirty years, 'I'm not sure I
can read the thermometer right. Isn't it funny how we brought up
two children without thermometers or bran or psychology or any of
those new inventions! But I'll try it.'</p>

<p>She paddled into the wide hall with its landscape wallpaper.
She did not seem oppressively worried. When she returned with the
thermometer, which she held as though it were composed of
dynamite, she spoke not of woe and mortalities, but gossiped,
'Almost one o'clock, and Sara not in yet.'</p>

<p>'Where the dickens that young woman goes . . . These modern
girls. Sit <i>around.</i> Drink gin and try to talk politics!
Discuss Conditions and Situations. Never get any sleep. They'll
never have our pep at our age. When I was twenty-eight, like Sara
. . . Brugluph!'</p>

<p>Hazel, with the rapture of an amateur nurse, had taken
advantage of him by jamming the thermometer under his tongue. He
sat slowly wobbling it with his lips, trying to continue his look
of brave suffering, though by now he had almost forgotten from
what he suffered. The sight of the black-rubber thermometer case
in Hazel's hand recalled to him a new grievance, and as soon as
she had slid the glass tube out of his mouth, he exploded:</p>

<p>'And another thing! You been using my fountain pen again! Oh,
I can tell! The cap was on loose.'</p>

<p>She did not listen to this entirely justified charge. Like any
other sound wife, she intended to go right on using his pen, as
well as his razor and even his portable typewriter.</p>

<p>Studying the thermometer, she worried:</p>

<p>'Fred! Darling! You <i>have</i> got a fever!'</p>

<p>'Whadie tell you!'</p>

<p>'But it seems quite bad. If I make this thing out correctly,
your temperature is a hundred and twenty degrees!'</p>

<p>'You're crazy! Gimme that thing! Hundred and twenty! If I had
that, I'd be dead. I'll show you.'</p>

<p>He sucked the thermometer again, removed it, glanced at it
with the careless mastery of a veteran salesman, and howled,
'Good heavens, girl, I <i>have</i> got a temperature of a hundred
and twenty! I'm dead as a doornail!'</p>

<p>Side by side, hands clinging, they sat worrying.</p>

<p>His lament had covered a sound of footsteps in the hall, and
neither of them was conscious of their daughter till she stood in
the door, demanding, like an inspector out raiding, 'Why the
wailing, Dad? What may all the trouble be?'</p>

<p>Pitifully, like a child showing a broken toy, Fred held up the
thermometer, protesting, 'I've got a temperature of a hundred and
twenty!'</p>

<p>'Oh, stuff!' Sara was, at twenty-eight, a perfect Queen
Elizabeth. (Her name had been Sarah until, as a junior in high
school, she had decapitated it.) 'You can't even read a
thermometer. A fine lot of good you'd be if you were over in
China now, fighting. Couldn't even care for the wounded. As
untrained as Howard.'</p>

<p>'I don't intend to be over in China now, fighting, nor any
other time, neither. The home talent there takes plenty care of
that.'</p>

<p>'Huh! Here, open your mouth, Dad.'</p>

<p>She stood regally tall, silver cape about her seal-brown
evening frock, while Fred, not the meekest of little men, had his
temperature taken for the third time within ten minutes.</p>

<p>The lady Storm Trooper firmly removed the thermometer, and
crowed, 'You haven't even half a degree of temperature. What you
need is more sleep--at your age. G' night.'</p>

<p>She was gone, trailing behind her that magnificent
intolerance.</p>

<p>Hazel looked at Fred, just looked, understandingly, and he
trembled into speech:</p>

<p>'"At your age". And me only fifty-five! I ask you, is
fifty-five any "your age"? It is not! And here I'd intended to
find out what she means, staying out till all hours. That's where
I lost out--when I first gave her a latchkey without a
struggle.</p>

<p>'And . . . I suppose a fellow always loves his own daughter,
don't he?' Fred pondered.</p>

<p>'Why, of course!'</p>

<p>'You do read in these novels and stories and everything where
sons and daughters don't always love their parents, though, don't
you?'</p>

<p>'Yes, I . . . I guess maybe you do.'</p>

<p>'Think their folks are just cranks and stuffed shirts?'</p>

<p>'Yes, but--oh, she's young, Fred.'</p>

<p>'Her? I'd been married three years, at her age.'</p>

<p>'Sara is so clever and educated and all. And she does look
exactly like Diana. So tall and elegant. . .'</p>

<p>'Diana who?'</p>

<p>'The goddess--you know--in that green book.'</p>

<p>And, indeed, Hazel did not exaggerate. The supple, grey-eyed,
neat-nosed, swift-moving Miss Sara Cornplow did look exactly like
Diana--not that anybody knows how Diana looked.</p>

<p>'That don't excuse her for being so superior,' complained
Fred. 'It beats the dickens how smart she is at making a fellow
feel guilty all the time about things that aren't any of his
business. Conditions and Situations! Inhibitions and Hormones!
Russia! Share croppers! Miners' wages! Rats!'</p>

<p>Always Fred would mix the literacy of his college days with
the colloquialisms of repair shop and junction lunchroom, till a
foreigner would be puzzled as to whether he might be a scholar or
a comedian.</p>

<p>'Doggone it, I don't own any mines! I'm not underpaying any
miners! I don't have to feel guilty! I've always treated my
family O.K., haven't I?'</p>

<p>'Of course.'</p>

<p>'Ain't a man in the motor game that can say Fred Cornplow ever
done them, not even in the second-hand business. Why, say, I
don't suppose I've pepped up some old plug with ether, not more'n
half a dozen times in my life. But Sara--say, she even says, just
because I like a good healthy nightshirt better 'n I do pyjamas,
that I belong to the horse-and-buggy era--me that invented an oil
filter that almost got taken up by Ford--and prob'ly she thinks
you're a secret tobacco-chewer.</p>

<p>'And now that Howard seems to have gone and become a Red,
guess it's from some brain injury he got in that last accident,
him and Sara will gang up on me. I could always count on their
bucking each other. When she come out of Vassar and first got
noble and humanitarian on me, and had that six-months' charity
job in New York, Howard was all for athletics; and when she
managed to hitch up socialism and high sassiety, me having about
an equal grouch on both of 'em, Howard decided he was a hairy
pioneer and liked camping. But if they work together, what a run
they'll give us.</p>

<p>'Still, maybe I am hard on Sara. She don't know yet what she
wants to do--sits around waiting for Santa Claus--can't decide
will she get married or be a missionary or raise wire-haired
terriers. Poor kid, she's kind of lost, don't you think so?'</p>

<p>'Of course, dear.'</p>

<p>Hazel was wide asleep. But so wrathful was he that, though he
had principles about 'getting your beauty sleep', he opened his
current detective story and found happiness again: the delights
of Chinese daggers, robbers' castles on the Yorkshire moors,
baronets bleeding in rooms with locked doors and no windows.</p>

<p>He sighed happily as he came to the end of the tale:</p>

<p>'". . . that whatever you say will be taken down in writing
and may be used against you", said Superintendent McCleaver.</p>

<p>'The professor coughed and raised a delicate hand to his
pallid lips.</p>

<p>'"Seize him, men!" shouted the superintendent, lumbering out
of the unwieldy Tudor chair. Sergeant McBeaver sprang at the
professor, then stood appalled as that slim febrile body, all
steel and rubber, slumped in the chair, and his head fell
sidewise.</p>

<p>'P.C. McDeaver growled, "He must 've had potassium cyanide
(KCN) concealed in his hand."</p>

<p>'The superintendent and Dr. Rosecliff exchanged slight smiles,
and the Doctor murmured, "Oh no, that wouldn't be, would it? Or
would it?"'</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>Fred Cornplow joined them in the slight smiles. This was fine.
He was glad that they had captured the professor; a really
dangerous, anti-social gent, given to murdering with fishhooks
the spinster aunts of rural deans; but the poor maniac had been
helpful to the soya-bean farmers of West Wiltshire. Fred looked
tenderly at Hazel and turned off the light, and not till 8 a.m.
did he think again of the slings and arrows of outrageous Sara,
the sea of troubles that was certain to lave the golden feet of
Howard.</p>

<p> </p>

<h1>CHAPTER IV</h1>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>Frederick William Cornplow was in his office, at the Triumph
agency, and he was busy. He had perceived that it was time to add
an agency for trailers to his business, and he had sent his
foreman and assistant manager, Paul Popple, out to Chicago to
look into the matter of the Duplex Trailer, a new make, only just
now in production but promising well.</p>

<p>That left Fred shorthanded. He had no one to sell cars except
salesmen, and they had one fault: they could not endure just
selling a car; they had to go through their little pieces about
the Triumph which, with such agony, they had learned from Fred,
and if a customer should attempt to buy a car off the floor,
without letting the salesman lift the bonnet and point out that
those funny jiggers there were the spark plugs, the salesman
would go to pieces.</p>

<p>Fred had finished the morning mail. He had dictated to his
secretary his decisions that he wouldn't really care to donate a
free car to the Navaho, New Hampshire, Orphanage; nor serve as a
committeeman for the Chamber of Commerce annual banquet in honour
of Commodore Perry; nor contribute a hundred dollars to the
Truxon College badminton association. Pleased that this morning
he had been satisfactorily hardhearted, Fred lighted his first
cigar of the day (the cigarettes began just after the
cornflakes), and clucked, as into the office was ushered his
sub-agent, Bert Whizzle, Triumph representative at
Enigmaville.</p>

<p>'Well, well, well, Bert, how's the boy?' he said.</p>

<p>'Fine, fine! How's everything by you, Fred?'</p>

<p>'Swell! Couldn't be better! The new Houndtooth station wagon
is simply wiping all the other boys off the map. You bet. Well,
how's the little woman, Bert?'</p>

<p>'Fine, fine! Just fine and dandy.'</p>

<p>'Fine! And how's the three young uns, Bert?'</p>

<p>'Fine and dandy. Just fine. Say,' and Mr. Whizzle laughed a
good deal, 'here was the funniest thing. Here couple nights ago
we had the kids' grandma over for supper, and I let Peggy--she's
the youngest--only six but bright's a dollar--I let her stay up
to say howdy to the old dame, and what d' you think she said to
her?'</p>

<p>'What was it? Tell me!' Fred's enthusiasm was as untarnished
as on the day, twenty-nine years ago, when, a cadet travelling
man in hardware, he had sold his first glamorous order of sixteen
tack hammers and one three-tined manure fork.</p>

<p>'Well sir, believe me or not, the little tyke took one look at
her grandmother and she pipes up and says, "Say, Gramma, does oo
smoke cigarettes?" Well, sir, I thought I'd die! What d' you
think of Roosevelt's New Deal, Fred?'</p>

<p>Fred meditated swiftly. Confound it, he couldn't remember
whether Mr. Whizzle was a Democrat or a Republican. (It may be
added that there were times when Fred could not remember whether
he himself was a Sterling Republican or a Loyal Democrat.) He
said weightily, 'Way I see it: now you take F.D.R. I'm perfectly
certain there ain't a more humanitarian politician in the
country--and what a voice on the radio! But same time, the needs
and aspirations of the Republicans have got to be given every
consideration. Way I see it!'</p>

<p>'You bet! You're dead right,' said Mr. Whizzle feelingly.
'Well say, Fred, got any interest in a couple 'r three orders
this morning? Like to make a little dough?'</p>

<p>'Oh, I guess I could stand up under the foul blow--or fell
blow, whichever it is. But the fact is . . . Now I don't know
whether you'll believe this or not, but I'm not half as
interested in the cash as I am in the fun of the game.' He did
not believe that Mr. Whizzle believed that he believed anything
of the sort, but it made a nice, refined atmosphere.</p>

<p>'Sure. Same way myself, Fred. Well, I've got orders for a
Houndtooth convertible coop, de luxe, Persian green; a Triumph
two-ton truck, closed body; and a Triumph special four-door
sedan, Garden of Allah sand colour.'</p>

<p>'Have 'em for you by to-morrow, if they aren't already in
stock,' chuckled Fred, as into the office charged his assistant,
Paul Popple, bawling, 'Mr. Cornplow, we've got hold of the
biggest thing . . .!'</p>

<p>'Just a minute! Just a minute, Paul! Can't you see I'm busy?
You know Mr. Whizzle?'</p>

<p>'Oh--oh sure,' said Popple, as vaguely as a bridegroom. When
Mr. Whizzle was gone, Fred turned on Popple with, 'Look here,
son! Am I never going to learn you that it's these sub-agents
that push off most of the cars we sell? Who do you think you are,
anyway?'</p>

<p>'Oh, I'm sorry, but I was all excited. You will be, too.'</p>

<p>'How'd you get back from Chicago so quick? Didn't expect you
till to-morrow.'</p>

<p>'Flew, sir.'</p>

<p><i>'Flew?'</i></p>

<p>'You bet.'</p>

<p>'In an aeroplane?'</p>

<p>'Nothing less.'</p>

<p>'Well, I'll be doggoned! I've flown, couple of times. But
don't know's I liked it so much. Kept wanting to pull up beside
the road and rest a little and maybe chew the rag with a
filling-station attendant, and then I'd look down and there
wasn't any road--just spider webs, down there. I felt like a toad
in a cyclone.' His recollections were interrupted by the
realization that Popple was jittery with a grandiose impatience,
and he complained, 'But what was the idea? What was all the
rush?'</p>

<p>'Mr. Cornplow, I think we've gotten hold of a whale of a
proposition. I've brought with me a contract giving us not just a
district agency but the whole of northern New York State for the
Duplex Trailer! I looked it up, and there are six million people
in the territory, and if we can't sell fifty thousand Duplexes in
the next five years--'</p>

<p>'Take it easy! Get down to brass tacks, Paul. What is this
machine for counterfeiting money that you think you've
discovered?'</p>

<p>'Honest, Mr. Cornplow, the Duplex is a natural! It's got
everything. On the road, it looks like an ordinary high-class
passenger trailer, except that it's about eighteen inches
higher--which still gives it as much clearance for railroad
underpasses as any big furniture truck. Well, in that extra
eighteen inches, there's an entire extra story to the trailer,
collapsed like a bellows when you're driving.</p>

<p>'The roof of the second story--it's of aeroplane linen, with
ribs of ribbon steel--drops right down on the flat roof of the
first story, with room between them for collapsible
aluminum-alloy beds and chairs, and even collapsible washstands.
The sides of the second story are of tarpaulin, and they cave in
like an accordion.'</p>

<p>Fred was not interrupting. Fred was a lively enough chatterer
when the customers wanted encouragement, but he had trained
himself to utter stillness of listening when it should be
useful.</p>

<p>'When you make camp, you raise the top roof with compressed
air worked from the engine--in two minutes you can raise it, and
you've added three separate bedrooms, with tarpaulin partitions
and a gangway. And that leaves you a really comfortable big
living room and kitchen downstairs. So Pop and Mom and two-three
kids can all travel together with some privacy. It's a real
moving home! It's a knockout! Look at these photos!'</p>

<p>Fred did look and felt like the first time he had put on radio
earphones, heard Philadelphia talking, and guessed that someday
he would listen from afar to presidents and kings. Fred had
always found business a diverting struggle; he could not
understand these superior people who considered trade mechanical
and witless; and in the Duplex Trailer he smelled a new
adventure.</p>

<p>'I kind of trust your mechanical sense, and you seem to think
this Duplex is O.K., Paul. I'll think it over.'</p>

<p>'But I'm afraid you'll have to jump. They can only keep it
open for us a few days. Honestly! You'll have to put up ten
thousand cash for a start. All they need is that and your
signature on the contract.'</p>

<p>And Fred signed. And the bookkeeper notarized. And the
office-boy galloped off to the post-office to catch the air mail.
And just as Fred leaned back, fretting a little, the Norse god
Howard glowed into the office.</p>

<p>'Hello, Dad. H'are you, h'are you?'</p>

<p>'Fine and dandy, Howard. Ribs all right?'</p>

<p>'Grand!'</p>

<p>'What you doing in town?'</p>

<p>'Li'l' party with the Staybridges--Guy's going to introduce
Sara and me to his Dad, you know, old Putnam, and his sister
Annabel. Course I've met Annabel, dances and so on, but I don't
really know her. And a friend of mine, a labour leader--Eugene
Silga, his name is--is coming along.'</p>

<p>(It is true that, with 125,000 inhabitants in Sachem Falls,
sound burghers like the Cornplows would not, save by accident, be
intimate with the proud Staybridges.)</p>

<p>'All right, son. Staying at the house to-night?'</p>

<p>'No, got to buzz back to Truxon and . . . No, no, now wait,
Dad. I'll drive like an old lady.'</p>

<p>'You will not! And if you want to break your neck, that's your
business, but I'm getting good and tired of paying fines and
repair bills, while you loaf through college!'</p>

<p>'But,' with wide, glad innocence, 'that's just what I came to
see you about! Dad, I'm not getting anything out of college. The
professors are the darnedest lot of crabs and bookworms. What
good does it do me to learn about the--the--well, all these
things they teach you? Couldn't you give me a job here in the
agency?'</p>

<p>'Son, someday I hope you do really settle down and look at
things seriously and want to come in with me. Someday I'll be
thinking about retiring.'</p>

<p>'You? Never! You like your hand on the steering wheel too
well! You'll be shoving off Triumphs on the sub-agents when
you're eighty. But how about me starting in here . . .'</p>

<p>'Howard, I don't want to be any crankier than the law allows,
but I certainly don't want you here, filling this place up with a
lot of your fancy college friends, Guy Staybridge and God knows
who all else, smoking and singing and playing contract.'</p>

<p>'Dad, you don't understand! Eugene has shown both Guy and me
where . . . We've cut out being aristocrats.'</p>

<p>'Don't tell me!'</p>

<p>'We have. We see now that there's got to be a new world. Youth
has got to take charge. Gene and Guy and me have been thinking
about starting a cell of the Workers' International Cohesion in
Sachem--the "Coheeze" they call it--you know, to make a United
Front of all socialists and democrats and liberals and the whole
bloomin' lot. I don't intend to have anything more to do with all
those snobs and idlers. I'm going to go to work for you, and Guy
and me are going to just associate with the intellectuals.'</p>

<p>'D'you think I'd be so crazy to have <i>them</i> make this
shop a hangout? It wouldn't be any very big help to my business
to have Reds and Bolsheviks and these new Coheezers of yours
making speeches from running boards in the showroom, all day
long. No, I'm sorry, but you can't come in here till you really
want to sell cars because you want to sell cars, if I'm making it
clear.'</p>

<p>'You're not, Dad, but . . . Lookit: course I don't want to be
a fanatic about these revolutionary activities. Fact, I'd just
soon chuck Eugene--you know: I mean, not let him have too much of
an undue influence on me. How about me quitting school and taking
up aviation? You know what a good driver I am . . .'</p>

<p>'Eh?'</p>

<p>'. . . and I'm dead certain I'd be a good aviator--you know,
cross the ocean and everything. Or what do you think of starting
a silver fox farm?'</p>

<p>'Or grow frogs' legs?'</p>

<p>It was Fred's supposition that he was being bitter, but the
Norse god answered with bright gladness:</p>

<p>'Oh, there'd probably be a lot of money in that, too, but I
don't believe frogs would be as much fun to raise as
foxes--<i>or</i> aviation. How about it? Do something
useful.'</p>

<p>A little wearily, a little savagely, altogether patiently,
Fred explained, 'Howard, two years ago you wanted to quit and go
to Hollywood. A year ago, when you had that piece about your
fraternity dance in your college paper, you were ready to quit
and take up your burden as London correspondent for the
Associated Press. Listen! I don't necessarily think so much of
college. But you've only got a year and a half to go before you
get your degree, and if you can't stick that out, you'll have to
get along on your own. My guess is that you'd make a first-rate
coat holder for some posthole digger on a WPA project that ain't
started yet!'</p>

<p>'Why Dad!' It was clear that Howard was hurt. Shocked,
surprised, wounded in his filial piety. 'You mean, if I quit
college and tried to really make something of myself, say wanted
to buy an interest in one of these small broadcasting agencies,
you wouldn't back me up?'</p>

<p>'Exactly!'</p>

<p>'Then, gosh, it's all true what Silga says about the Youth
Movement: the older generation is trying to crush our aspirations
and throttle us economically . . . Oh say, Dad, this Gene is a
grand guy, and awfully hard up. Could you let me have twenty-five
bucks to lend him?'</p>

<p>'I could not!'</p>

<p>'Well--well--see you again soon.'</p>

<p>Howard departed in complete cheerfulness.</p>

<p>In the heart of Fred, sitting motionless, there was
considerably less cheer. He glanced irritably about his office.
Yesterday it had been a sparkling gem of efficiency; now it
seemed drearily commonplace: merely a desk, a couple of filing
cabinets, a tableful of bright catalogues; the inner walls half
wood and half clouded glass; the outer windows looking on a
cemented yard full of dejected turn-ins with one horrible wreck
that confessed a windshield jagged and stained. The only sounds
were the rasping screech of valve-grinding, and from the sales
floor, just outside, the voice of a salesman: 'Not a chance of
your shimmying with a job like this. You can drive over
cobblestones like you were in your cradle.'</p>

<p>'Dumb place. Never anything new,' Fred grunted.</p>

<p>It was running smoothly, it was his own machine, but suddenly
he did not care whether it ran or not. Was that all that Howard
and Sara wanted from him, just to 'back them up'?</p>

<p>This Duplex business: It might be too successful.</p>

<p>He might be caught up again in a delirium of business. Why
wasn't it possible, just possibly possible, for Hazel and him to
take a little time off, to flee from the pleasant padded
servitude of the office, of their home, and see the world? Do a
few crazy things like learning to ride horseback--gambling not
more'n once or twice at Monte Carlo--trying to play the
piano--seeing the Midnight Sun--building furniture--sitting at a
small table in the piazza of Venice?</p>

<p>As a voice from beyond the clouds came the thought that,
actually, they could do some of those things--do all of them! He
was not rich, but he had money enough; the agency was not perfect
but, under Paul Popple (not under Howard, by jiminy!), it would
get along.</p>

<p>Almost frightened, he ran from the heretical inspiration;
jammed on his hat and heavy overcoat; fled to the Sachem Club and
the comforting dull talk of Doc Kamerkink and Walter Lindbeck and
Ed Appletree.</p>

<p>For--he put it to himself in protest against himself--what the
dickens would happen to the world if people ever did what they
wanted to?</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<center>
<h1>CHAPTER V</h1>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>The present house of the Frederick Cornplows was a good brick
Georgian house, on a good street, with a good little lawn and a
good big maple tree, and it proved to their world that they were
successful. But it was like fifty other residences on Fenimore
Cooper Boulevard, which was like five hundred and fifty other
handsome boulevards in America.</p>

<p>The residence of Mr. Putnam Staybridge--he who with seeming
indifference bore the honour of being the father of Guy--was a
museum piece: a square, white, frame object, with a cupola. It
seemed to have been built of ice and icily to have defied the
common sun. Every piece of furniture, to the last console table
and damask-seated chair, belonged rigidly to the period--had in
fact been created by one of the most eminent fakers of
antiques.</p>

<p>This was fitting, because Mr. Staybridge was what is
technically known as of a 'better family' than Fred Cornplow.</p>

<p>A better family is one that has had money or land longer than
most; there is nothing more to the trick, and titles and armorial
bearings are merely to fool the eye. Nor is it always good taste
to ask where the family got the land and money in the first
place. The truth about the Norman families of England is that
William the Conqueror, a folio edition of Al Capone, stole the
country from the Saxons (who had stolen it from the Early
English) and divided it among his gang, not yesterday, which
would make it criminal, but back around 1100, which is
aristocratic, and renders Norman lineage even more important than
your golf handicap.</p>

<p>If it had been the Eskimos who had seized England and picked
out pretty titles as earls eight hundred years ago, then the Best
Families, both British and American, would to-day be claiming
descent from Oley the Blubber.</p>

<p>Just so, a Staybridge ancestor, in Salem in the early 1700's,
a pious man, fond of sermons about hell-fire, was a shipowner who
from the West Indies brought molasses which he distilled into
rum, which he shipped to Africa, where it was exchanged for
kidnapped Negroes, who were taken as slaves to the West Indies,
to be exchanged for molasses, with a profit at every corner of
the triangle. So his descendants were able to become college
founders, cabinet members, and Putnam Staybridges.</p>

<p>Putnam was so aristocratic that he dared, even in 1936, to
wear a small beard. Perhaps he had slid down a little from the
family standard, in that he was merely a clock manufacturer and a
bank director, but he was first or second cousin to an
ambassador, a Harvard professor, an Episcopalian bishop, and to
the spouse of a Neapolitan duke; and his stamp collection
contained a unique hexagonal black Swiss-Guiana specimen.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>When Howard Cornplow lumberingly, Sara tensely, and the
black-enamel-eyed organizer, Eugene Silga, placidly, came roaring
with Guy into the Staybridge mansion, Putnam was artistically
seated in the library, holding an Elzevir Apuleius in his lap and
tapping the walnut chair arm with his eyeglasses . . . He had
owned the Apuleius for ten years and had not, to date, read ten
words beyond the title page. And he had been arranged here,
tapping the glasses, for half an hour, ever since Guy had
telephoned to announce this dreadful visitation.</p>

<p>He arose, for the purpose of bowing to Sara, looking
quizzically at Howard, and snubbing Gene Silga, and went back to
sitting, to tapping, and to glancing at his book.</p>

<p>Behind him was his daughter, Annabel, and Annabel was, to be
brief, a darling. She was a tousled, smiling, shy, sloppy,
brown-haired, easygoing, very pretty, happily cynical darling of
nineteen or twenty, and Howard looked upon her--she looked upon
the Norse god--with young rapture. Years ago they had met, at
dances, but since she had been chased off to school at
Farmington, they had never said anything more ardent than 'Mave
nexdance?'</p>

<p>Howard was jarred out of his adoration by Mr. Putnam
Staybridge's answer to whatever it was Guy had been babbling:</p>

<p>'So you intend to inaugurate in Sachem Falls a chapter of the
Workers' International Cohesion--the Coheeze? Delightful name; so
suitable to a young man like yourself, Guy, who was brought up to
the traditions of Henry Adams. You purpose to start a monthly
called <i>Protest &amp; Progress,</i> nicknamed "P. &amp; P.", to
be cheaply printed and to unite the underprivileged of the entire
world--no mean feat for three young men, even when abetted by so
charming a young lady as Miss Sara Cornplow, considering that all
the revolutionists in the world, including the accomplished Mr.
Lenin, have hitherto failed to achieve this. And you wish me to
contribute a sum which, I should judge from your slightly
hysterical exposition, Guy, would be approximately a hundred
dollars? . . . Now, Mr. Silga, will you be so good as to tell me
whether this <i>Protest &amp; Progress</i> will be definitely
communistic?'</p>

<p>'Not in the least, sir.' Gene was calm, and Gene's smile was
tender.</p>

<p>'It will not be under the eventual control of the Party, or
whatever you may call the organization that receives orders from
Moscow?'</p>

<p>'Oh no. The purpose of the "P. &amp; P.", Mr. Staybridge, will
be to unite people of all political faiths who believe in
scientific control of politics, whether they are Republicans or
Reds--except that, I'm sure, the Reds will denounce us as
wishy-washy.'</p>

<p>Mr. Staybridge arose quietly. He murmured, 'In that case, I
shall give Guy a cheque for one hundred dollars for your
enterprise, on <i>condition</i> that no copy of the blasted sheet
shall ever be brought into this house!'</p>

<p>He went beautifully up to his bedroom and read the same
detective story that Fred Cornplow was, just then, reading at
home.</p>

<p>When his father was safely gone, Guy fretted:</p>

<p>'But lookit, Gene, of course "P. &amp; P." <i>will</i> be
pro-communist.'</p>

<p>'Of course.'</p>

<p>'But you told Father it wouldn't be.'</p>

<p>'Of course I did.'</p>

<p>'But that's a lie.'</p>

<p>'Of course it is. Do you intend to go down to police
headquarters and pin up posters announcing we're going to take
over the constabulary, soon as we get the strength?'</p>

<p>Howard intruded, while the thrushlike Annabel Staybridge
admired his copper-shining nobleness:</p>

<p>'Thunder, no, Guy, you certainly wouldn't do that?'</p>

<p>'No, maybe not,' said Guy, rubbing his large Staybridge nose,
wiping his spectacles, in a jittery manner. It was only of late
that he had gone from poetry into the lusher fields of communism
and Holy Russia.</p>

<p>Gene exulted, 'With the seven-fifty the New York Coheeze has
promised us, that makes eleven hundred and fifty dollars we've
raised to start <i>Protest &amp;</i> <i>Progress.</i> Think you
can get a hundred out of your father, Howard--Sara?'</p>

<p>'Well, the old man is pretty down on the Reds, but he's a
kindhearted old skate, if you're patient and let him get his
bellyaching over,' rejoiced Howard.</p>

<p>'Even without it, we'll be able to get out one number,
anyway--and what a terrible printing job <i>that's</i> going to
be!' said Gene.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>Eugene was a year or two younger than the Dianic Sara, a
quarter of an inch shorter, and not having, like Sara, studied
French at Vassar, he could not speak it. (Neither could Sara.)
But so easy was he, so understandingly did those bright dark eyes
look into her, that Sara was flattered to be called by her first
name, was captivated by Gene's power--the result of his excellent
endocrine glands--and interpreted it as her conversion to
communism. She had done a little communism, just as she had done
a little tennis, Thomas Wolfe, golf, Bach diving, William
Faulkner, biochemistry, Buddhism, vegetarianism, and Buchmanism.
Now she plunged deep, and at one end of Putnam Staybridge's
chaste drawing-room Guy and Eugene and she happily agreed that
within five years Putnam would be set by the American Soviets to
digging canals.</p>

<p>But Annabel and Howard were at the other end of the apartment,
and nothing like so revolutionary.</p>

<p>'Gosh, Miss Staybridge, I'm sorry I never really had a chance
to get acquainted with you. You must of been just a kid when you
went off to school.'</p>

<p>'Yes, I was--just a skinny awkward kid. But then I guess I
still am, Mr. Cornplow.'</p>

<p>'You are not! Say, gosh, Miss Staybridge, you got more darn
gracefulness and the loveliest lips I ever did see.'</p>

<p>'Oh, now you're flattering me, Mr. Cornplow. You college
pundits! I'm just another young female, where you're a regular
movie star. You play football at Truxon, don't you?'</p>

<p>'Well--that is--course I'm on the scrub team. The captain and
the coach ganged up on me. They claim I'm lazy, just because they
said I had to live on prunes and bran and go to bed at nine, and
I told 'em where they got off! "I'm not going to bed at any nine
o'clock and I'm not going to eat any prunes", I told 'em. No sir!
Prunes! Don't you think so?'</p>

<p>'Oh, absolutely, Mr. Cornplow . . . Prunes!'</p>

<p>'I bet you love to dance, Miss Staybridge.'</p>

<p>'Oh, I adore it, but not with any of these little
shrimps--only with tall men--and I've noticed that all you
golden-haired boys, I don't know <i>why</i> it is, but somehow,
you always dance so well.'</p>

<p>'Me? Golden-haired? It's just plain, dumb <i>red--</i>tray
ordinary.'</p>

<p>'Oh, it is not red! It's gold.'</p>

<p>'It's red!'</p>

<p>'Gold!'</p>

<p>They dived into laughter--Romeo and Juliet, Tristan and
Isolde, Mrs. Nickleby and the vegetable marrows.</p>

<p>At the other end of the room, Gene Silga explaining that in
Russia--to which he had never been nearer than Fall River--the
least skilful workman has a better time than any Detroit foreman:
free lectures and a chance to do parachute jumping.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>The revolutionary conspirators, the two lovers, could hear
from above them an irritable pacing.</p>

<p>'That's Father, registering indignation,' sighed Guy. 'Don't
it beat the Dutch how unsympathetic all fathers are!'</p>

<p>This beginning of the open season on parents drew the
romantics back to the general hunting party, as Sara observed,
'Doesn't it! My father, old Freddie, wants to do the right thing
by his offspring, sometimes dismayingly so, but he has no
imagination; he can't understand that young people aren't
altogether content to play bridge every evening and go to bed at
ten-thirty. Why--why--he still wears a nightshirt instead of
pyjamas!'</p>

<p>'No!' marvelled Guy.</p>

<p>'He's lucky. I usually don't have on anything at night except
an undershirt,' said Gene.</p>

<p>'I'll bet Mr. Cornplow does so have imagination,' protested
Annabel. 'I mean, I don't really know your father very well, but
I talked to him once about getting a new car--Mr. Putnam
Staybridge sure quenched <i>that</i> maiden's dream--and I
thought your father was swell. He was so kind and he joked so . .
.'</p>

<p>'Naturally, if he thought he could sell you a car!' said Sara.
'Oh, Dad really is kind, or means to be, but he hasn't got the
imagination to see that the younger generation wants something
more than being a respected resident of Cooper Boulevard. It's
impossible for him to conceive that we, that Youth, no longer
wants anything merely for itself, but demands that the whole
world be freed of the bonds of capitalism.' She looked to Eugene
for approval, and got it, from his well-trained professional
smile. 'Why . . . Look, Annabel--I may call you Annabel, mayn't
I?--doesn't your father travel a lot?'</p>

<p>'Sure. Comrade Putnam is even worse than the kind of
globe-trotter that shows you his snapshots--he's the kind that
sneaks off to Vienna and Rio and then gloats at you and won't
even tell you what he's seen.'</p>

<p>Sara was relentless: 'Well, Dad won't travel one bit. Doesn't
want to travel. And he can perfectly well afford to, the rest of
his life. Why, time and again I've offered to take him to
Paris--think of it, I've never been there myself!--and he always
says, "We'll see", and sneaks out of it. Positively, Freddie
<i>enjoys</i> being an old horse in a treadmill. I believe, no
matter how he kicks about it, he's secretly pleased when we
sponge on him. Shows what a noble, stalwart pillar of society he
is! We must see to it that he contributes to the Coheeze.'</p>

<p>'Yes, we must see to that,' said Gene.</p>

<p>'Anyway, this whole business of parents,' began Guy, the poet,
philosopher and pal, 'is a funny--well, it's a funny business. I
think they ought to appreciate their children for taking the
trouble to represent them in the new social movements, the
socialization of education and the extension of labour unionism,
since they're too old-fashioned to do it themselves. But say,
speaking of your dad, how's to skip down to your house? There's
Putnam making unfriendly noises upstairs again.'</p>

<p>'Grand! Come along! It's only ten-forty. Dad will be glad to
see us.'</p>

<p>Howard was buoyant, and Annabel followed him in demure
obedience. And Sara hinted no opposition after she had looked at
Eugene and found him ready, and after she covered all points by
explaining:</p>

<p>'Well . . . All right.'</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<h1>CHAPTER VI</h1>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>Fred had wound his watch, he had listened to the broadcaster's
opinion that to-morrow it would rain in Omaha and parts of West
Virginia, and he had proffered to Hazel his nightly observation,
'How about turning in and getting a little sleep?' The front door
crashed, and in, like a flock of sheep with the voices of crows,
tumbled Sara, Howard, Eugene, Guy, Annabel.</p>

<p>But when Fred had been presented to Annabel, he was sweet to
her--too sweet, thought Hazel.</p>

<p>Sara purred, 'Father, Mother, this is Eugene Silga of the
Workers' International Cohesion. I think you've heard Howard
speak of him.'</p>

<p>'Oh yes, yes, sure, you bet!' crowed Fred, shaking hands.</p>

<p>Gene's thin hands were hard, and his eyes half friendly, half
shrewd, altogether cynical. The comedian Fred, who all day long
shouted stories, became cautious and dead quiet.</p>

<p>'Sara has been telling me about your two-story trailer,' said
Eugene to him.</p>

<p>'Yes?'</p>

<p>'I'll remember it, next time I have anything to do with a
demonstration in Union Square. Speech from the second story might
go over big. I'm not sure you approve, but I'm interested in
radical labour unions, Mr. Cornplow.'</p>

<p>Sara flared, 'Oh, why don't you <i>tell</i> 'em you're a
communist and a party member, Mr. Silga--Eugene? It won't hurt
'em!'</p>

<p>Fred was more cautious than ever. 'No, it won't hurt us at
all. I heard you were a communist, Mr. Silga, when you were mixed
up in the Pragg glass-works strike. But here's something even
stranger than that. Me, I'm a Republican and go to church!'</p>

<p>From Hazel there was a faint squawk that sounded like,
<i>'When?'</i> as Fred went on selling:</p>

<p>'I'm glad to meet you, I won't pretend I like communism, but I
much prefer you out-and-out advocates to the limousine
socialists, like Sara here, who say, No, it wasn't the communism,
it was something they ate; who cuss out capitalism and go right
on living on it.'</p>

<p>'I don't know, Mr. Cornplow. An agitator finds limousines
awfully useful sometimes, for escaping from the cops.'</p>

<p>'Hm. Yes. Glad meet you. I've been reading where it's become
the fashion for the Reds to shave and bathe and leave the bombs
home . . .'</p>

<p>'Sorry, never seen a bomb.'</p>

<p>'. . . in the bottom bureau drawer, and I'm interested to see
that it's true, Gene.'</p>

<p>With warm-hearted aid from Guy and Howard, derisiveness from
Annabel, and watchful silence from Eugene, Sara portrayed for
Fred and Hazel the future of the Coheeze, and of the monthly
<i>Protest &amp;</i> <i>Progress,</i> which was to bring to
far-flung workers in byre and grange and speak-easy the
surprising news that, if they were real toilers and not
parasites, like Fred, all Irishmen, Chinese, Japanese, Germans,
Frenchmen, Spanish leftists, Spanish rightists, Negroes,
Californians, Floridians, New York garment workers, Vermont apple
growers, and pearl divers in Borneo loved one another to
death.</p>

<p>'What do I do about it?' weasled Fred.</p>

<p>'Why, you contribute!' Sara laughed heartily.</p>

<p>'Not me. I laid off loving the workers when the last
automobile strike prevented my getting any cars to sell for
couple of months, right at the height of the season.'</p>

<p>Sara protested, 'Guy's father, Mr. Staybridge, has given us a
hundred dollars. Are you going to let him beat you?'</p>

<p>'Absolutely! Guy, you tell your father I'll let him contribute
the whole doggone fund, if he wants to.'</p>

<p>'Oh, Dad!' (That was Sara again.)</p>

<p>Hazel spoiled everything:</p>

<p>'Fred, if Sara is enjoying this so much, and I'm sure Mr.
Silga could tell us such interesting things about Russia, sex and
divorces and how much the servants get and all--I do hope he'll
be willing to lecture before the Egeria Club, it's my turn next
month to get a speaker--and if Sara is having a good time out of
it, I'm going to donate fifty dollars myself! Out of my own
money, I mean!'</p>

<p>Fred goggled, remembering that Hazel's 'own money', from the
estate of an unexpected uncle, had last year brought in $786.10,
of which, to his knowledge, she had spent over nine hundred.
While Hazel was being thanked, Fred craftily led Annabel apart
and fished:</p>

<p>'Didn't know you knew my boy, Miss Staybridge.'</p>

<p>'Oh, I don't, really. I've just met him at dances.'</p>

<p>'That's probably the best place to meet him. I'd steer clear
of him in the classroom.'</p>

<p>'Don't you guarantee him?'</p>

<p>'Well, he uses an awful lot of oil and gas and he backfires
going uphill, not down, and his brakes are slipping. But he's got
a nice three-coat finish, and I kind of like him.'</p>

<p>'So do I!'</p>

<p>Everyone else was lounging; everyone was chattering; Hazel was
explaining to Gene Silga what a wonderful time they had had at
the Egeria Club when they had entertained a pupil of Dale
Carnegie, who had informed them that the ability to express one's
self on one's feet was as important to a clubwoman as it was even
to a senator or a lubricant salesman. But Annabel sat straight,
her hands folded in her lap, her eyes straight ahead, in a
trance. Her lips seemed very soft; Fred thought that they would
tremble, if she was hurt. She seemed to him made not of patches
of prejudice and unimportant informations, like the rest, but to
be all of one piece, clear and sure and kind.</p>

<p>'She'll fall in love with Howard because he looks like a movie
star, and then keep it up because she'll be sorry for him,'
sighed Fred to himself. 'He'll wear her out. Here, quit it! Don't
crab about your own son. Way Annabel's looking round, guess she
likes it here--kind of free and easy--or would be if Sara wasn't
so doggone high-minded--in comparison with Staybridge, that old
stiff. But Annabel--got the friendliest eyes I ever saw--friendly
's a pup--I'd like to have Howard safely married to a good loyal
girl like her, but do I want to see <i>her</i> married to a
loafer? Duties of parents? Someday I'll chuck the lot of 'em . .
. I won't!'</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>By request of Sara, Eugene Silga outstayed Annabel and Guy.
After ten minutes' discussion of the fact that, if he started in
five minutes, he could be in Truxon at a fair hour, Howard went
up to bed; and Eugene and Fred, with the Cornplow women for
gallery, circled about each other.</p>

<p>Let us be clear about the political activities of Eugene
Silga. He was not at all like the melodramatic Bolsheviks of
British detective stories; he had no secret gang with an abbey
crypt for hideout, no beautiful phoney countess (in black with a
platinum dog collar) for spy. Fred suspected that Sara's radical
toying, suddenly become so active this evening, meant nothing
more than a desire to be important, to be Different, and to
associate with romantic young men. But Gene's purpose was clear.
He had hated the bland and rich ever since his infanthood in a
riverside slum in Brooklyn. Making his way at City College of New
York by pressing clothes had not improved his benevolence. He
wanted power and revenge; he was willing to risk death in the
hope of smashing the entire democratic system and winding up with
the factory workers dictatorially running the country, and
himself running the workers.</p>

<p>Both Sara and he did love humanity. Whether either of them
loved a single individual human being was less certain.</p>

<p>Eugene did not come out of the comic papers. He was neither
dirty-necked nor bellowing, nor had he any especial tropism for
soapboxes. He was neat and quiet-voiced; he smiled
affectionately; and he was, to the world of Fred Cornplow--to the
world of Franklin and Emerson and Mark Twain, of Willa Cather and
William Allen White--as dangerous as a rattlesnake.</p>

<p>There is a vulgar error about rattlesnakes. Hordes of sensible
people assume that it is treacherous in a rattlesnake to bite the
tourists, but to himself a rattlesnake is an honest, kind-hearted
family man who believes that human beings treacherously kill a
lot more rattlesnakes than snakes kill humans.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>Eugene was telling Fred about the Youth Movement.</p>

<p>'It's not purely a communist doctrine. We're willing to make a
United Front with the liberals and even lukewarm socialists. I've
just been out at a Youth Convention in Cincinnati. We're
demanding of Congress . . .'</p>

<p>'Demanding?'</p>

<p>'Certainly! Demanding that all young people up to
twenty-five--oh, I'm a year beyond that limit, so it's not
personal--be granted college educations with all expenses paid,
free cigarettes, free movies twice a week, and jobs at union
wages guaranteed after college.'</p>

<p>Fred was gulping, but Sara stopped him with, 'Now, Dad, please
don't tell us again how you waited on table at college, and then
went to work at seven dollars a week.'</p>

<p>It was Hazel who, surprisingly, led the attack: 'I never could
quite understand the Youth Movement. I know; so many of the boys
and girls are having a dreadful time getting started, nowadays.
But is it any harder on them when they can't find a job than it
is on a man of forty-five, with a sick wife and three
children?'</p>

<p>'That's scarcely an answer,' condescended Eugene, while
inwardly Fred began to rage that, 'Doggone it, this Silga fellow
acts like he owned the house. Pretty soon he'll give us lessons
in how to drive a car, if we'll just pay strict attention.'</p>

<p>'That's scarcely an answer. Naturally, I believe in
guaranteeing work, with a maximum week's labour of thirty hours
and a minimum wage of fifty dollars, for all workers, whether
they are twenty-five or sixty-five. But our chief concern is with
Youth, because it has a chance to be educated: it isn't blinded
by the American myth that this is a democracy and that everybody
still has a chance.'</p>

<p>While Fred tried to look relaxed and impartial, and did look
as relaxed and impartial as a cat on flypaper, Eugene informed
him that all automobile workers' wages could easily be doubled if
the manufacturers would get rid of the middleman (such as Fred
Cornplow); that it was a good thought that Great Britain would
soon lose India and Egypt, France lose Indo-China, and Holland
lose Java; that it was an even better thought that during the
first three months of the Next War, Russia would take over
Alaska, western Canada, China, Scandinavia and Poland, and make
their inhabitants as joyous as the Russian peasants. So, by easy
stages, they came to Spain, where, everyone said, there would be
a dangerous right revolution before long.</p>

<p>Eugene announced, and quite politely, 'I've talked it all over
with Sara, Mr. Cornplow and--I hope you won't think it's
impertinent of us, but we find that the only way to get proper
contributions for the Spanish government is to figure out quotas
for different contributors, and let them know.'</p>

<p>'But I'm not a con . . .'</p>

<p>'And Sara and I feel that you could show that you really do
believe in democracy and popular rule by contributing five
hundred dollars to the Spanish government and . . .'</p>

<p>'Five hun . . .'</p>

<p>'Certainly! Heaven knows I can't give anything, with my
wretched income,' snarled Sara.</p>

<p>Fredk Wm, who gave her that income, didn't think it was at all
wretched, considering his own resources. A thousand a year and
all found? So that was wretched, was it? He spoke with spirit and
wrath:</p>

<p>'Look here, you young people, I'm getting tired of being
badgered. I know I'm just a millionaire capitalist--just a
multi-millionaire, that's all, nothing but a face grinder and an
orphan robber, just a foe of the oppressed. Sure, I understand
that horny-handed proletarians like you two have got to destroy
capitalists like me--certainly--just take us out and destroy
us--put us up against a wall and destroy us--take away my steam
yacht and my French ch&acirc;teau and my wife's ruby
necklace--just take 'em away and stick us up against a wall and
fill us full of holes. That's the proper caper, just destroy us.
Only, I don't expect to contribute for the privilege of being
destroyed! I'll be content with just being shot; let the other
fellow pay for the bullets.</p>

<p>'No, wait now, Sara. I know, when you open your mouth like a
fish, I'm going to get hell. But you listen to me first, for a
while.</p>

<p>'I do read the newspapers. Seriously, I do know there's a lot
of things wrong in this world; mining is dangerous and badly
paid; Tom Mooney was rail-roaded and ought to be released; the
Southern share croppers have a terrible time--<i>and</i> so do
most of the plantation owners!--a lot of priests and college
professors get sent to prison in Europe for telling the truth;
the Negroes get an awful deal; a lot of farmers just work to feed
their mortgages.</p>

<p>'But unlike you communists, I don't feel that I'm Almighty
God. I can't do everything in the world at once. I'm the
president of the Mind Your Own Business Association. I'm just not
rich enough and not smart enough to rebuild the New York slums
and stop all war at one and the same time. I don't think I've
done so bad with my own job. My workmen and my customers both
seem pretty well satisfied. I get along all right with my own
family . . .'</p>

<p>'Do you?' breathed Sara.</p>

<p>That hurt. It seemed to Fred equally pertinent and
impertinent. He went on less confidently.</p>

<p>'I mean . . . And so . . . Well, as I was trying to say: I
don't pretend to be a Rockefeller. I'm just a plain ordinary
citizen of Sachem Falls, N.Y., and you highbrows, who love to
talk so much about realism and seeing clearly, ought to
appreciate the fact that I know what I am.'</p>

<p>Hazel had looked at Fred sympathetically, and she charged up
with reinforcements. With the most restful prosiness, she told
Eugene about the Spreadeagle Little Theatre of Sachem, about
Howard's remarkable success in baseball, as a boy, and about her
cousins in California. This warm bath soothed them all, and
Eugene eased out, with an abstracted farewell which said that he
would never come back.</p>

<p>'Did you really have to go out of your way to be insulting?'
demanded Sara.</p>

<p>'Not very far! I never could understand why it was that thirty
years ago we were supposed to be apologetic to all the visiting
firemen from France and England for being American, and now we're
expected to apologize to Russia. When this young pup hits me in a
tender spot . . .'</p>

<p>'Your pocket-book, Father!'</p>

<p>'You bet! It's what you've always lived on, isn't it, young
lady, if you want me to be vulgar?'</p>

<p>'I don't!'</p>

<p>'Well, when he sashays in here and tells me my duty . . .'</p>

<p>'I wonder you didn't spring on him something refreshing like,
"If you don't like it here, why don't you go back where you came
from?"'</p>

<p>'Well, I did think of taking that up, but I wasn't sure he
came from some country I disliked enough to wish him off on it!
But I respect him more than I do you. He has the decency to be
openly a threat to every doggone thing I stand for, and risk his
life in strikes, and prob'ly he lives on fifteen-twenty bucks a
week, while the young folks like you sponge on your parents for
all you can get, and are ashamed of yourselves for it, and take
it out on us!'</p>

<p>'Father!'</p>

<p>'Absolutely. Maybe you're not to blame personally. Whole
country's full of smart young people whose folks have sent 'em to
school and done all they could to help 'em socially and
financially, and the kids despise 'em for being so soft, and
don't for one second hesitate to correct their parents' manners
and historical dates! But I don't intend to have any of those
intellectual snobs in my house, not if I know it! Young lady,
after children get to be eighteen or so, they have no more claim
on their parents' affection than anybody else. They've got to
earn it!'</p>

<p>Sara rushed from the room, sobbing.</p>

<p>Fred paced a good deal.</p>

<p>'Oh, hang it, I didn't mean . . . But that girl, Sara, she got
me so riled up, just when I'd laid myself out to be so polite to
her and that dark-eyed comrade, that Bolshevik gigolo! Why can't
they be nice, like Annabel? There's <i>my</i> daughter. Not sure
I'll let her marry Howard, the stuffed sweater! But Sara . . .
All right, all <i>right!</i> Shall I wait and apologize to her
to-morrow, or go up and get it over now?'</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<center>
<h1>CHAPTER VII</h1>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>The renowned Old Home Week of Sachem Falls was held in March,
however inclement, because that month marked the birthday of the
city's one revolutionary hero, General Abram Pough, of whom no
one knew anything except that he had been a hero, that he had
almost certainly been born, that he had been born in March, and
that he had not been born at the celebrated Pough Birthplace, on
Beecher Street. The annual Home Week parade was, by custom, the
occasion for the first outdoor showing of the new automobile
models, an attraction altogether more interesting than General
Pough to the citizenry.</p>

<p>It was in this parade that Fred exhibited the first Duplex
Trailers beheld in Sachem. His assistant, Paul Popple, had
fretted, 'Say, Chief, I've got the low-down on what the Conqueror
people are going to do. They're showing six models, all decorated
with hot-house flowers. What say we have ours tied up with gold
ribbons?'</p>

<p>'I'm not selling ribbons. Nor gold. Nor flowers. I'm selling
automobiles. I'll work out our display,' snorted Fred.</p>

<p>Paul Popple was doubtful, Hazel was doubtful, and Sara was
shocked when, in the Old Home Week parade, after floats showing
the Dutch first settlers making cheese and consequently being
scalped by the Iroquois, after the American Legion and the Sons
of Sweden and the pickle-works exhibit and the Woodmen of
America, rich in axes and badges, after the elegant display of
the rival Conqueror Motor Company, ornate with roses and
daffodils, came the eccentric display arranged by Fred. Leading
it was a Triumph town car, and in that car was the mayor of
Sachem, who owed Fred three hundred dollars. The spectators,
packed in like baled hay and encouraged by dollar-a-day clappers
hired by Fred, applauded with an apparent feeling that this was
official and the Triumph must, therefore, be a very good car
indeed. Following was a Houndtooth Six, and, to Sara's wan
disapproval, it lacked not only flowers and ribbons, but even a
decent body. There was only the chassis, without fenders and with
the driver on a greasy wooden box. But the crowd was stirred by
seeing the wheels go round, and jammed in close to the
Houndtooth, crying, 'Look, Bill, the way them brakes work!'</p>

<p>After it rolled six Duplex Trailers, and this was the first
time that any outsider in Sachem had seen a Duplex.</p>

<p>The trailers were in busy action. The extra second story of
each was being raised or taken down. The crowd gasped and
gurgled, and Hazel patted Fred's cheek in wonder, as she saw
three bedrooms magically created out of air.</p>

<p>The news stories about the parade, later, in all three papers,
could not ignore this innovation--particularly as Fred had
promised each of them a full-page Duplex advertisement. In each
news story was a paragraph to the effect: 'The surprise of the
show, however, was a fleet of Duplex Trailers, which unfold to
provide a second story.'</p>

<p>Fred had sold six Duplexes before twilight the next day.</p>

<p>But at home, quiet beside Hazel on the couch, listening to a
nostalgic Hawaiian radio quartette (from the Bronx), Fred
pondered, 'Yuh, it was a good show. I'm a swell salesman
<i>and</i> a good showman. But--funny--the kick don't seem to
last. I felt kind of naked out there, watching the Duplexes dress
and undress in public. Am I getting tired of just being a
showman, honey? Then what 'll I <i>do?</i></p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>He did not speak to Hazel, he didn't even speak to himself,
about the important occurrence of the Old Home Week parade.</p>

<p>During the passing of the Duplexes, Fred had wandered away
from Hazel, to greet possible customers, and in the crowd had
come upon Putnam Staybridge and Annabel.</p>

<p>But for the treachery of George Washington, Mr. Staybridge
would now be Gen. the Rt. Hon. Sir Putnam Staybridge, P.C.,
D.S.O., K.C.M.G., and though he had been robbed of this rightful
label, yet in the precision of his little beard, the quiet
intolerance of his grey eyes, the erectness of his frail
shoulders, Mr. Staybridge showed his private knightliness. He was
devoting it now to sneering at the Duplex demonstration, and it
did not help Fred to know that Mr. Staybridge had some
unacknowledged interest in the opposition Conqueror Motor
Company.</p>

<p>'How d'you do, Mr . . . Cornplow,' said Mr. Staybridge. But
Fred felt that he didn't really much care how he did, or whether
he did at all. Putnam was already ignoring him while he
acknowledged the passing of a woman acquaintance by pinching the
top of his hat and slightly widening his lips, like the
stretching of a rubber band.</p>

<p>But Annabel was beaming. Fred flagrantly winked at her.</p>

<p>Five minutes later, while Fred was watching the passing of the
Boy Scouts, someone plucked at his sleeve, and he looked
down--not very far down--on a shy Annabel.</p>

<p>He comprehensively remarked, 'Well, well!'</p>

<p>'Father's gone and . . .'</p>

<p>'You stay with me. I'll guard you. I used to be a G-man.'</p>

<p>'Honestly?'</p>

<p>'Absolutely. I captured Jesse James.'</p>

<p>'Jesse James wasn't captured. He was shot in the back by a
member of his gang.'</p>

<p>Fred looked on Annabel with favour. How rare it was, he
thought, to find anyone under thirty these days who was not
dazzled by the movies and aviation, but knew such sanctities of
American history as the James Boys. 'Good girl,' he said. He
could not treat her like a Staybridge. She really seemed human.
He grumbled, 'Afraid your father didn't care much for my trick
trailers, Miss Staybridge.'</p>

<p>'I'm afraid he enjoys not caring for much of anything. Uh . .
. uh . . .' Annabel twisted a button of his coat. 'Have you seen
Howard?'</p>

<p>'Not for a few days. He's coming down for my birthday party,
at the house, week from next Tuesday. Look! Why don't you
come?'</p>

<p>'I'd love to, Mr. Cornplow!'</p>

<p>He envied the clear light of Annabel in a foggy, complicated
world.</p>

<p>'By golly,' he swore, 'if Howard don't fall properly in love
with her, I'll--well, I'll do the worst thing to him I possibly
can: I'll let him do what he thinks he wants to do--leave college
and go to work!'</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<h1>CHAPTER VIII</h1>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>The house of Frederick William Cornplow was filled with openly
secret preparations for his fifty-sixth birthday, next day. He
sat in plump contentment, awaiting dinner and snorting over the
evening paper, and all life seemed secure.</p>

<p>The doorbell rang then, and all the forgotten sorrows of life
trooped in.</p>

<p>Hilda, the maid, announced, 'There's some folks here, name of
Tillery, Enos Tillery and his folks; they say they want to see
you.'</p>

<p>'Tillery? Never heard . . . Oh, wait.'</p>

<p>With creeping horror Fred remembered that he did have some
second-hand cousins of that ominous name. One Joe Tillery, from
back yonder. Not since boyhood had he seen any of the tribe, but
he remembered them, in a paintless farm shanty, unbathed,
uncombed, insolvent and full of jolly music; he remembered his
father giving Joe a tenth of the ten dollars which Joe had
modestly solicited. This Enos Tillery would be Joe's faithful
son.</p>

<p>Fred stalked into the hall. With touching trustfulness he
hoped that the Tillerys would get no farther.</p>

<p>By the door, looked appallingly friendly, was a man of Fred's
own age--Enos, presumably--whose hair had not been cut for two
months nor his cheeks shaven for four days, but who displayed
checked plus-fours, golf stockings purple and leaf-green, and a
moth-eaten red sweater. Enos was reinforced by his wife, in a
tweed coat with a fur collar which needed combing, as did her
greasy black hair, and by two lumps of grown sons and a small boy
and a small girl.</p>

<p>Now Fred had resolutely freed himself of the heresy, held by
his father and his father's friends, that there was disgrace in
poverty and evil in the poor. On the other hand, he had not
slipped into the new credo that poverty and bad luck and dirt are
always and necessarily superior to thrift and good fortune and
soap . . . And perhaps he wouldn't have cared a hang, one way or
the other, but he was that most shrewdly disciplined of beings, a
Good Family Man, and as the Tillerys broke out in a rash of
smiles that to the experienced tradesman meant cases of the
helping-themselves hand, Fred was itchily conscious that Hazel
might be peeping around a corner and refusing to forgive him for
having brought these relatives into the world.</p>

<p>Enos was shouting, 'Well, well, it's fat little Freddie
Cornplow, the old thief! Remember how you used to pinch apples,
at our farm, and Dad walloped the daylights out of you? Remember
how you were scared to go swimming in the crick? Oh, those were
the great days!'</p>

<p>From the blue distances of jocund Youth, there seemed to float
past Fred a delicate odour of the Tillery pigpen. But he got out
shakily:</p>

<p>'Oh, yuh, sure--yuh, that's right. So this is the family.'</p>

<p>'Yes, here's Edna, the wife, and Mac and Cal, the big fellows,
and little Tom and Sagittaria.'</p>

<p>Fred did not understand it, but somehow they were no longer in
the hall; they were in the living-room, seated, and Cal had
helped himself to a cigarette, Mrs. Tillery to candy, while Tom
and Sagittaria were bouncing gleefully on the couch, whose
springs were none too hale.</p>

<p>(But you couldn't turn down your relatives, your own cousins,
now could you? Blood thicker than--thicker 'n glue, this time . .
. But golly, if Sara came in!)</p>

<p>Enos was caroling, 'Well, sir, we're kind of driving down
towards West Virginia--fellow told us there was some kind of
Rural Resettlement project down there where we could get a farm
free, and all the tools. I noticed we was right near here, and I
says to Edna, that's the wife, "We'll just drop in on fat little
Freddie--not make any trouble--maybe he's got engagements--not
give him and his woman . . ." Eglantine, that's your wife's name,
ain't it?'</p>

<p>'Hazel.'</p>

<p>'Hazel? Kind of a hick name. She just a plain farmer, too,
like you and me, Fred? Well, anyway, Edna says no--says it's
almost forty years since you and me have seen each other--you
wouldn't want to entertain us, she says, but I says "Of course
he'll want to see a <i>cousin!"</i> I says. "Wouldn't I be
tickled to death to give <i>him</i> a shakedown if I had a house
and if him and his family come along?" . . . How many kids you
got, Fred?'</p>

<p>'Two.'</p>

<p>'Oh well, you never were much good. Six, I've got--these four,
and another one that's got a fine job selling patent medicines,
and the other--well, he had kind of bad luck, and 's matter of
fact, he was innocent, but he's in the reformatory, and . . .
Anyway, "No," I says to Edna, "of course he'll be glad to see us.
What's relatives for?" I says. "Fred may have gone and got rich,
but I'll bet he don't think he's too good for his own
people--I'll bet that at heart he's just a dumb, plain rube like
the rest of us." Is that steak I smell?'</p>

<p>Fred was by now in a simple state of dementia. Beyond question
he knew that if he invited his kin, and perhaps kind, to dinner,
Hazel would kill him and Sara cremate him. He stuttered:</p>

<p>'H-had your supper, E-Enos?'</p>

<p>'Not yet! Ready to eat an ox!'</p>

<p>'How you fixed for money?'</p>

<p>Enos laughed. His wife laughed. His young laughed. Enos
giggled, 'You wouldn't kid me, would you? You always were a great
little kidder.' He arose to run at Fred and jab him in the
ribs--unnecessarily, Fred thought. 'Between us, we've got about a
dollar and a half.'</p>

<p>'Well, you let this be my treat. Here's five dollars,
Enos.'</p>

<p>Enos took the bill not at all reluctantly; the only reluctance
was in his yearning venture, 'But wouldn't it maybe be cheaper to
feed us here, Freddie? Not but what I could take the five bucks
too, if you insist!'</p>

<p>Enos laughed. His wife laughed. His young . . .</p>

<p>Reduced already to the state of a pitiful liar, and not a very
good liar, Fred implored, 'We've got some folks coming in for
dinner . . .'</p>

<p>'That's all right with me, if it is with you. I could run down
to the store and get couple cans of beans . . .'</p>

<p>Desperately, 'No, guess we better have it this way.'</p>

<p>'Well, look, Freddie, I don't want to be a nuisance. No man
living can say I've ever been a bother to nobody. I've often
said, "I may not have much of this world's goods, but I've worked
and worked hard for what I've got, and one thing I always been
proud of is, I've been independent." Neither a borrower be nor a
lender, like the fellow says. But I was wondering if you happened
to have any spare rooms we could stay in, just for
to-night--maybe a couple of nights, so the children could look
over the town. Educate 'em. We wouldn't be a bit of trouble. The
younger kids could just well sleep here in the sitting-room.'</p>

<p>'Uh--uh--afraid our guests will be staying . . .'</p>

<p>Fred's brow was sopping; he wished that he could again try
Sara's clinical thermometer.</p>

<p>'Enos!' said his wife.</p>

<p>'Huh?'</p>

<p>'Beat it!' said his wife.</p>

<p>'Me?'</p>

<p>'All of us. Scram!' said his wife.</p>

<p>'All right . . . Now there's just one other thing, Freddie.
Happen to know about any jobs for Mac and Cal here? Course I want
to grab me that Gov'ment farm, but the boys are real good at
fixing cars. Both worked in filling stations, and of course with
your big agency . . .'</p>

<p>'What have they done?'</p>

<p>'Cal, he was in the CCC for a while, but he didn't care so
much for it, and then he hitched up with the WPA, but say, those
WPA bosses are fierce, they expect you to work like it was a real
paid job, and then he was kind of a sweeper in a factory and
afterwards, he had a couple of days cooking in a lunch wagon when
the fellow was sick, but Cal didn't seem to take to that so much,
and here lately he hasn't hardly been doing anything, you might
say, just travelling with us--we had a real interesting
time--most of the winter we was in Florida, but we had kind of a
run-in with the authorities. Oh yes, Cal's a good worker,
providin' he has a boss that understands he's high-strung and
nobody that you can cuss and knock around. But Mac . . . Well, he
reads a lot, but he hasn't had Cal's experience. But what the
dickens! No use worrying. Gov'ment owes everybody a living, don't
it?'</p>

<p>Fred rose. The others didn't. He had to make it severe--at
least he tried to make it severe, even in face of Enos's leering
remembrance of himself as fat little Freddie Cornplow:</p>

<p>'Enos! Have Cal and Mac come to see me at the Triumph agency
to-morrow, between ten and twelve. I'll see if I can't put them
to work.'</p>

<p>It took half an hour before the Tillerys oozed out of the
house, during which period Hazel peeped in and looked at Fred
like the Gorgon sisters; it took five days and a hundred dollars
before Fred coaxed them to ooze out of Sachem. As Mac and Cal
were only half an hour late in coming to see him the next day, he
put both of them at work, washing though rarely cleaning
cars.</p>

<p>The brief comedy of the Tillerys affected him as biliously as
Sara's conversion to communism or Howard's desire to leave
college.</p>

<p>Fred had not hugely differed from Enos Tillery in a simple
faith that a man is as chained to his family, even to all of his
blessedly lost relatives, as he is to the law and the prophets
and his most understanding friends. But the affaire Tillery,
coming just a day before the family gathering on his fifty-sixth
birthday, left him in a shocking state of tribal infidelity.</p>

<p>'My own bunch are Hazel, and now Annabel, and friends like Doc
Kamerkink and Walter Lindbeck--none of them blood relations,
thank heaven!' he blasphemed, and, greatly daring, he wondered
whether he was compelled to serve the desires of even Howard and
Sara, unless they should choose to be his friends as well as his
children.</p>

<p>At dinner, Hazel said, 'Did I hear those people say they were
cousins of yours? Why didn't you invite them to dinner?'</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<center>
<h1>CHAPTER IX</h1>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>The living-room was littered with crocuses and daffodils,
lilies and hothouse roses, for Fred's birthday party, and he, who
hated this clammy reminder of advancing years, grumbled, 'Sure!
Getting me used to my funeral by degrees!'</p>

<p>The dining-room was set out with the gold-and-sky-blue Limoges
plates, cut-glass dishes of Hazel's celebrated brandied peaches,
and gold-rimmed, faintly etched wineglasses, from which they
would each drink two doses of champagne, except for Fred, who
would have three, and Annabel Staybridge, who would have ginger
ale.</p>

<p>The more he disliked birthdays, the more Fred drove himself to
be merry and grateful, particularly when they produced the
surprise gifts, which he had already viewed, in their
hiding-place in the linen closet, with disapproval. The gifts
were also a give-away of the donors. Fred had complained that he
hadn't a dressing-gown long enough to cover his nervous feet on a
winter morning, and from Hazel he had a woolly robe large enough
to cover the feet of Jumbo. But it was of a dizzying purple,
edged with fiery red cord, and the sash, he was certain, would
never stay tied. Howard gave him a framed photograph--of Howard;
and from his friends and guests Dr. and Mrs. Kamerkink, he had a
pipe. It was the second pipe they had given him, and Fred never
smoked a pipe, but the Doc believed that for a gentleman of forty
and upwards a pipe was more manly and hygienic than
cigarettes.</p>

<p>Fred gabbled, 'Mighty handsome pipe. Imported from England?
Golly!'</p>

<p>Sara was responsible for a dreadful bottom-shelf book, <i>A
Statistical Survey of the Diminishing Returns of the Capitalist
System,</i> whose sour cover contrasted with the frock of silver
lam&eacute; which she wore as the result of capitalist returns.
Fred was meanly suspicious about her having really spent
three-fifty on a book for him, and later he privily investigated.
Sure enough; on the flyleaf there had previously been a pencilled
name, now erased.</p>

<p>But from the blessed Annabel was an omnibus of Dorothy Sayers'
detective stories, with the promise that for his next birthday he
should have a set of Agatha Christie. 'Girl, you're walking out
with the wrong generation of Cornplows,' he said, and he kissed
her, Howard kissed her, and Hazel, who had watched all this
foolishness without applause, kissed her with an entirely
different accent.</p>

<p>The dinner was lush but difficult.</p>

<p>The extra maid, brought in temporarily for waiting on table,
had been trained in a laundry, so that while she was warm and
quick, she did rather slop things, and things you would not have
expected to be slopped: not only the soup and champagne, but the
currant jelly and the ice cream. Sara, the socialist, was testy
with her, as Sara always was with waiters, taxi-drivers and
telephone girls. Hazel was bland and forgiving, but then, Sara
sniffed, Hazel was still afraid of servants.</p>

<p>With the hors d'oeuvres which Fred called the 'duffers'--there
were anchovies and sardines and two kinds of potato salad--they
all asked with considerable politeness about the progress of the
Duplex Trailer and happily turned to boasting of their own
troubles: Howard's fascinating troubles with the Truxon proctor
who disliked the melodies of a mouth organ at two a.m.; Sara's
troubles with finding a 'half-way human' hairdresser in Sachem;
Doc Kamerkink's troubles with a scoundrel who had developed a
coronary thrombosis on the day when he had promised to pay his
bill.</p>

<p>With the mushroom soup, Howard talked about the probability of
his being student commandant of the Truxon R.O.T.C. next year,
while Sara informed them that in Russia, though under the Tsar
music and dancing had been unknown, the peasantry now spent
practically every moment from five p.m. to eight next day in
dancing by moonlight.</p>

<p>But with the duck, and continuing through the ice cream and
chocolate sauce, Howard really got under way, and every moment,
as he became more exhilarated, Miss Annabel Staybridge looked at
him more proudly. The glances she telegraphed to Fred indicated
that she was not deceived; she considered Howard a good deal of a
baby, but adored him nevertheless.</p>

<p>It was a little hard for the others, particularly the
Kamerkinks, to understand just what it was that Howard expected
to do.</p>

<p>It seemed that he was going to remain in college, thwart his
enemies and play in the college football team; yet simultaneously
march out of college and do something thrilling and lucrative
with rockets, which, he rejoiced, were shortly to replace
gasoline motors for flying, and propel a plane from New York to
London in five hours. At the same time, apparently, he was going
to start a cabaret near Truxon. All he needed was a few thousand
dollars--and in the bright buoyancy of youth, he beamed at Fred,
who flinched.</p>

<p>'Cal Tillery's cousin, that's who Howard is,' thought
Fred.</p>

<p>With the apricot brandy, a drink which Fred considered related
to pink silk underwear and rose-tipped cigarettes, Howard had
managed to bring off an entirely new victory. Apparently he was
now with the Triumph-Houndtooth-Duplex agency, as assistant and
future successor to Fred, and was making things not merely hum
but yell.</p>

<p>'You've certainly done a grand job, Dad, but there's a lot of
new ideas that would quadruple the racket. Pretty soon, I think,
we could add television sales to our other junk, and say, I've
got some real ideas about the kind of showroom we ought to
have--knock the eyes out of every other dealer in town--place
right on Chester Avenue, all black glass and mirrors and red
leather upholstery, and maybe a private bar for the big shots,
and we could keep open evenings in summer and have an
orchestra.'</p>

<p>Fred saw, instantly, that so insane is the world that Howard's
hysterical plans for the Triumph agency might actually succeed.
They really might 'quadruple the racket', and quadruple his work;
and if that happened, he wanted to be out of it, hiding in a
haystack.</p>

<p>He recalled that for more than thirty years he had been
slapping almost unslappable backs, taking buyers to caf&eacute;s
when he had longed for his slippers, enduring more talk about the
weather than there had been weather. He saw that it had been with
the tension of a crusade that he had engaged himself in loving
like a brother anybody who had $1100 for a car. He was suddenly
and inexplicably weary. It would be a pleasure to refuse ever to
sell anything else to anybody.</p>

<p>'Certainly, Mr. Jones, we have five million television sets,
1943 model, on hand, and I wouldn't sell you one for five million
dollars! I don't like your split infinitives!'</p>

<p>Fred heard himself saying, but not in the least believing,
'You better get busy and learn something about motor engineering,
Howard, if you're going into my firm, because pretty soon I'm
going to sell it and retire.'</p>

<p>The entire company, who had hardened into the affable boredom
suitable to a birthday party, sat up.</p>

<p>'You're going . . .'</p>

<p><i>'You're</i> going . . .'</p>

<p>'To retire?'</p>

<p>'Nonsense!'</p>

<p>'You?'</p>

<p><i>'When?'</i></p>

<p>Fred enjoyed it. He had not been so important in his family
since he had bought his opera hat. It pleased his vanity to see
that his reputation for Being Different was so solid that he had
taken in all of them, except perhaps Hazel, and that even she was
wondering a little.</p>

<p>'And when would you pull this big hermit-and-monastery act?'
Dr. Kamerkink demanded.</p>

<p>'One year from now.'</p>

<p>Howard bleated, 'Dad! You couldn't possibly! Whether I stick
it out in college or not, I've got to get started, somehow, and
you're the only one that'll help me!'</p>

<p>But it was Annabel's eyes that most pleaded for Howard.</p>

<p>'Good Lord, son, I expect to help you get started. But only
started. I don't expect to carry you for years and years, like a
lot of parents are doing, nowadays. I guess that's another demand
the Youth Movement is making on Congress--let the old folks do
it--penalize the folks that like to work by making 'em support
the ones that don't.'</p>

<p>Hazel, rather sharply for Hazel: 'Don't tease him, Fred.'</p>

<p>'Me? I'm not teasing.' And Fred wondered if he really had been
only teasing.</p>

<p>Howard, shocked at the threat to his one sure lifelong
profession, was begging, 'But Dad, if you retired in ten-fifteen
years from now, when I had things going . . .'</p>

<p>'No. One year. You can go to work and learn the motor car
business from Paul Popple.'</p>

<p>'But Dad, oh, Paul is O.K., but he isn't even a college
man!'</p>

<p>It was Sara who cut through the argument; who killed the
epigrams which Fred was trying to work out, to the effect that a
couple of fellows named Washington and Lincoln and Henry Ford and
Thomas Edison had got along without college. She explained, more
affectionately than usual:</p>

<p>'Father, of course we know you don't mean it, but please don't
dramatize yourself, like a child playing soldiers. You aren't one
bit abused; you like the game of selling things to people who
don't want them, and you like seeing us dependent on you and
turning to you for everything.'</p>

<p>Fred winced.</p>

<p>'I think your Duplex Trailer is absurd; in the very worst
taste, and too horribly inconvenient--like those covered wagons
of the pioneers, that always seem so romantic, but they must have
been beastly uncomfortable to ride in and impossible to sleep in.
But I do believe the thing may make a lot of money, and so might
these nuisances that Howard raves about: television and nasty
airships with rockets in their tails. There'll be a lot of cash,
and of course you want to get it while the getting's good!'</p>

<p>'Why, Sara, I thought you were so much against all this
doggone capitalistic acquisition of wealth and everything!'</p>

<p>'If I had--if we had the money, I could do such splendid
things for <i>Protest &amp; Progress</i> and the Workers'
International Cohesion, an organization which . . .'</p>

<p>'You mean the Coheeze?'</p>

<p>'I believe it is sometimes so called.'</p>

<p>Believe? reflected Fred. She knew doggone good and well it was
so called. He had heard her so-calling it on the telephone, that
evening.</p>

<p>She was continuing, in the benign manner of St. Patrick
watching the last snake leave Ireland: 'I'm working with Eugene
Silga every day now, making plans to start the "P. &amp; P." Of
course we're not communists, but we believe the Soviets must have
a chance, and we want to expose the beastly libel that the
Bolsheviks have ever liquidated one . . .'</p>

<p>'"Liquidate!" That mean "slaughter"?'</p>

<p>'. . . single person unless they were traitors and spies for
Trotsky, and trying to wreck the people's state. What would you
do, if you were Stalin?'</p>

<p>'Now how the devil do I know what I'd do if I were Stalin? I
don't even know what I'd do if I were Max Schmeling or Mae West.
I never claimed to be much good on deciding what other people
ought to do.'</p>

<p>'And yet you're constantly deciding what Howard and Mother and
I ought to do.'</p>

<p>'Ow. You win, girl.' For the first time since his confession
of desertion, there were smiles at the table. 'But look here;
you're crowding me. You're getting me away from the subject in
hand--the fact that I am going to retire in one year, and your
mother and I are going to enjoy ourselves. Anybody got any real
objections?'</p>

<p>'Yes. I have,' said his wife.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<center>
<h1>CHAPTER X</h1>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>'I don't suppose for a minute,' said Hazel, 'that you mean any
of this, but what would you do with yourself if you did
retire?'</p>

<p>'Prob'ly travel.'</p>

<p>'You remember our one big trip together? Didn't we see
everything--Washington, Mount Vernon, Chicago, the Yellowstone,
the Grand Canyon? But all I can recall is how sore our feet
got.'</p>

<p>'Well, thunder, we went too fast. Day and a half in
Washington! Too quick. Why, Washington's a darn interesting town.
Worth maybe three days of anybody's time. I'd like to go to
Europe, say, and really sit around.'</p>

<p>'Can't we sit around here? Just think, dear, how uncomfortable
you'd be in a strange bed. Or having waiters carve the roast
beef. No, no! You stay on the job and have the fun of working
with Howard and seeing the business expand. You'll never retire!
You don't <i>want</i> to. You want to see the children get along,
and help 'em.'</p>

<p>'Of course. You'd be bored to death travelling,' shouted
Howard.</p>

<p>Annabel now burst:</p>

<p>'Please excuse me--I'm a dreadful outsider--but why shouldn't
Mr. Cornplow go off bumming if he wants to, after all these
years? I think it would be swell if he went and sat under a palm
tree and threw rocks at the whales! Instead of teaching you which
part of a car the engine's in, Howard!'</p>

<p>All of them stared at her severely, all but Howard, who was
bothered, and Fred, who did not see her at all.</p>

<p>For this moment, during a rather pointless talk at a rather
pointless birthday party, was suddenly and appallingly the most
important in his life.</p>

<p>Whether it was the addition of another year to his age, or the
toothaching memory of the cousinly Tillerys' sponging, or
Howard's picture of an expanded agency with Fred as leading
lunatic, or Sara's explanation that he was useless except as a
feeder for communism, or whether it was some hidden impatience
that for years he had struggled against recognizing, he knew, in
this half-second, and knew terrifyingly, that what he had said as
jest was devastating truth. He perceived that he did want to
retire and, with Hazel, try to discover what manner of man he was
and might become . . . that he <i>intended</i> to retire . . .
that he might even actually do it.</p>

<p>He looked puzzled. He coughed a little. He scratched his ear.
He jiggled his watch chain. The table and the guests came back to
him out of the mist. He informed himself that he had returned to
his senses, that the retirement notion was fantastic and that no
sane fella like himself could be so anarchistic as to do
something merely because he wanted and intended to do it.</p>

<p>He was conscious that Howard was finishing what had,
apparently, been a lengthy speech:</p>

<p>'. . . and in my opinion, if you care for it, Dad, I think
you'd be making a big mistake. But I agree with Mother that you
don't mean it. You couldn't possibly retire. In one
year--impossible! Because, to be specific, as my history prof
says, aside from coupla months travelling in Europe, what could
you <i>do?</i>'</p>

<p>It was hard for Fred to outface their pity. He waggled his
fingers while he fumbled and mumbled:</p>

<p>'Do? Oh. <i>Do.</i> There's a lot of things I could do. I've
been a good salesman; I've helped spread mechanical conveniences
among a lot of stubborn dumb-bells, and I'm glad of it. Sara
thinks I've been a pedlar; I think I've been a missionary. But
I'd hate to pass out thinking I couldn't do anything else. Do?
Travel, like I said, and not just two months in Europe, either.
Nosir! Study it thoroughly, every corner; take an entire year!
And learn things, like languages and music. And this manual
stuff, carpentry and fixing clocks--nice, clean, interesting
work. Maybe wind up in the country and have a crossroads store
and a small farm, just to have something to fuss with.'</p>

<p>Hazel was worried. Better than any of them she knew that Fred
had possibilities of madness, and she said luringly, 'But, dear,
you'd be bored, after the city and contacting all these different
people--stimulus, you might say.'</p>

<p>'Think I get so much kick out of "contacts" with Bert Whizzle
and Paul Popple--and Cal and Mac Tillery, the rubber-boot twins?
High-class stimulus that is!'</p>

<p>'But we can't just consider ourselves in this life, Fred.
After all, we have got a duty to our family and friends.'</p>

<p>'Duty! Duty! Duty!' Was this the conservative Fred Cornplow?
'I'm sick of hearing about duty. Duty of husbands to come home to
their wives every night, when it would be better for everybody's
temper if they stayed downtown and had a little poker and liquor
with the boys! Duty of wives to stay home instead of going out to
the movies, just because Pa has his slippers on! Duty of Howard
and Sara here to pretend they think I went to college once, and
read a book. Duty of Annabel and the Kamerkinks to pretend
they're not embarrassed by this family's undressing in public . .
.'</p>

<p>'Not at all,' said Dr. Kamerkink.</p>

<p>'Ought to hear the Staybridges,' said Annabel.</p>

<p>'Duty! I figger life would be a lot better for everybody if
more folks did things because it was fun and not because it was
their dumb duty! Remember what Chum Frink wrote:</p>

<p> </p>

<blockquote>
<p>'"Lives of great men all remind us<br>
 We can make our lives sublime<br>
 If we nag the kids and neighbours<br>
 And look noble all the time!"'</p>
</blockquote>

<p> </p>

<p>'Duty!' said Fred.</p>

<p>'Horrid word,' said Annabel.</p>

<p>'Shut up, dearest,' said Howard.</p>

<p>'O.K.,' said Annabel.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<h1>CHAPTER XI</h1>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>As the Cornplows' family physician, Dr. Kamerkink must have
known that there was no use in giving Fred any advice which Fred
was not, beforehand, prepared to hear and pay for. But the Doc
had recently begun a book which showed that the latest thing in
medical practice--true, it was known to the ancient Greeks, but
without the sparkling terms which now made it interesting--was to
use psychiatry on the patients: not let an honest citizen develop
cramps or colitis because, subconsciously, he didn't like his
wife's new green dress. No. Change the dress. Or change the
wife.</p>

<p>Unfortunately the Doc hadn't got far enough into the book to
learn what, in detail, you did with psychic therapeutics, but he
took a shot with what he had:</p>

<p>'Now, Fred, if you'll allow me to give you some advice both as
your physician and old golfing companion . . . This idea of yours
about retiring and going off and making yourself uncomfortable is
just an incipient psychosis. Course, I advise you to cut down
your smoking and drinking and eat at regular periods and get a
lot of rest.'</p>

<p>'No!'</p>

<p>'Oh yes. I told you that before. But the thing to correct is
your--uh--your conditioned reflexes.'</p>

<p>This time it was Annabel who jeered 'No!'--but softly, almost
inoffensively, with lips puckered in Fred's direction.</p>

<p>'Just as important as these somatic corrections, however, is
the mental hygiene, and in good old cart horses like you and me,
Fred, that implies a steady carrying on of your normal
occupation. Any man who retires from his natural work before he's
finally carted off to the hospital is a sap! None of these
high-class psychiatrists, that get a hundred bucks an hour for
telling you what you already know, could beat me at advocating
plenty of good, juicy vacations and hobbies. Why, I knew one
insurance agent with dyspepsia who, on my humble advice, took up
archery, with the result that his wife--I want you to listen to
this carefully now, Fred; it's quite a sensational case, and I'd
of written it up for the <i>Journal of Psychiatry</i> if I'd had
the time--and the result was that his wife, who was about twenty
years younger than he was and who he suspected of sneaking off to
dances with younger men, began to join him in archery. . .'</p>

<p>'Archery? Shooting arrows? No! I won't shoot any arrows!'</p>

<p>'Well, she became his real pal. But appetite ticklers like
that are just the opposite of retiring. Fellow's got to be an
authority on one thing, and stick by it, if he's going to win
people's respect. Suppose, say, you were on a steamer and . .
.'</p>

<p>'Steamer to where?' demanded Annabel.</p>

<p>'Heavens! Steamer to anywhere! I'm just imagining a case.'</p>

<p>'Oh,' said Annabel.</p>

<p>Fred chuckled, and Dr. Kamerkink looked at both of them
suspiciously as he struggled on:</p>

<p>'You're on this steamer, and somebody asks you, "Who's that
guy?" Do you answer, "Why, he's the fellow that sang 'Trees' at
the ship's concert," or "He's the one that knows the difference
between Barbados and Haitian rum." No! What you answer is, "Him?
He's the biggest manufacturer of automobile tops west of the
Mississippi!" and the other fellow gets interested and says, "Is
that a fact! Say, I've got an automobile top! I'd like to get
acquainted with him." See how I mean, Fred?'</p>

<p>'I see,' said Fred.</p>

<p>Hadn't Doc Kamerkink been saying something about how to get
along well on steamers? He'd like to get along on steamers, well
or ill.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>Sara finished it--Sara tore it.</p>

<p>'But of course if you ever did retire, actually you wouldn't
stay away for more than a month, Father. Impossible!'</p>

<p>'How so?'</p>

<p>'You're too much a creature of habit. You've often laughed and
told us about how fussy Grandpa Cornplow was: had to have the
wastebasket or his footstool in exactly the same place, and
carried on if anybody moved his ruler, which he never used, one
inch from its proper place. And of course you're precisely like
him!'</p>

<p>'Me? That've always made such fun of him . . .'</p>

<p>'Precisely! If the cleaning woman ever changes the order you
always keep your toothbrushes in, you have three fits before
breakfast. You're as fixed in your routine as if you were in a
plaster cast, and you'd be chilly without it!'</p>

<p>'Wh-why--me--why, I'm known throughout the entire motor
business as a lone wolf. Do just what I please . . .'</p>

<p>'But, darling, you're always pleased to do exactly the same
thing at exactly the same second every day, and if you went
travelling and had to change your habits, you'd go crazy. Please,
Father, this isn't any criticism. Since you'd rather play cards
than read anything new and discover what's going on in the world,
it doesn't matter. Gives you a stability that, maybe, the rest of
us do depend on, as you hinted--not awfully politely, I thought.
But it does mean you'll never in the world be able to do anything
different from selling Triumphs and coming home to hear Lowell
Thomas on the radio.'</p>

<p>'Why--why . . .' said Fred.</p>

<p>'Isn't that just what I told you!' crowed Doc Kamerkink, who
hadn't.</p>

<p>There was a certain listlessness, as the party broke up, in
all of them except Howard and Annabel, who trotted off
together.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>'Routine? Fixed habits? <i>Me?'</i> raged Fred, as he drank a
glass of sodium bicarbonate--remembering that it had been his
father's habit, also, to think that after every company dinner he
needed soda.</p>

<p>Hazel raised her eyes at him and dropped them, silent.</p>

<p>While he worried his undershirt off, even during the pleasure
of scratching his back, he studied her, and sighed to himself,
'Hazel's the best woman I know.'</p>

<p>But, he fretted, she was fanatically devoted to possessions,
to things. Perhaps she coddled her belongings just to keep from
being bored to death, but still . . . She was the cave woman who
desired a larger fire, a thicker bearskin, than the lady in the
next-door den.</p>

<p>Almost the only jealousy that had ever spotted her life was a
small, annoying envy of the possessions of others. In the cottage
of her Utica father she had lived meagrely, with any new
purchase, a new doormat, a fly net for the horse, a matter to be
discussed by the family for days. Yet at fifty-three she believed
that she would be miserable if she were deprived of her
candle-wick bedspreads, the grand piano she had bought for Sara,
her private jar of balsam-scented bath salts.</p>

<p>'You and I really could skip off together and have a handsome
time, if you weren't so set on having things just so,' he
sighed.</p>

<p>'Fred! If you ever really <i>want</i> to travel, or do
anything else, anything at all, I'll always be right there with
you. But we mustn't fool ourselves. I've always said it would be
a great treat to see Europe, but honestly, we wouldn't be happy,
trying to get along without our comforts. I suppose in London, or
even in Paris, there's hotels modern as anything in Sachem, but
how would you like to go back to sleeping on a horrible hard
mattress, like you probably had as a boy? Cornhusks! You can say
what you want to, but it's awfully important to have an
advertised mattress.'</p>

<p>'If I liked the scenery, I wouldn't care if I slept on a
board.'</p>

<p>'But you can't very well look at the scenery while you're
sleeping.'</p>

<p>'Oh, you know what I mean.'</p>

<p>'And since when did you ever sleep on a board? Not since you
were arrested for rioting in college!'</p>

<p>'Arrested? Me? You know doggone good and well I've never been
arrested in my life--except maybe ten-twelve times for speeding,
and that time when I was a kid and punched the fresh waiter . . .
Say, there's a button off this clean shirt, and I was going to
wear it to-morrow!'</p>

<p>'Put it there on the chair; I'll sew it on . . .'</p>

<p>'But I was going to wear it . . .'</p>

<p>'Oh, wear another one! And you know, it isn't just
<i>things,</i> that we've got fixed up so nice now, as we want
'em. It's our children and friends--people you can trust and
count on. Course it's pleasant to meet strangers, but you can't
understand 'em and feel <i>safe,</i> not like with your own
folks.'</p>

<p>'Oh--well--thunder--gee--I guess maybe you're right. Don't
meet many fellows like Doc Kamerkink, or Walter Lindbeck--even if
he is fifteen-sixteen years younger than me, but how he can play
poker!' Fred smacked his head on the pillow, turned the pillow
over and pulled the blanket up under his chin, 'And Annabel's a
peach.'</p>

<p>'And Sara, of course.'</p>

<p>'Except when she says fool things like my being a slave of
habit.'</p>

<p>Resolutely he flopped on the pillow again. A truce to all this
chatter. He was a man of resolute action, and he was going to
sleep. Yes, he'd never be able to get away; he had enough nerve
to admit it, when he had taken a licking.</p>

<p>He lay awake watching the shadows move against the yellow
window blinds and trying to remember where he had heard a phrase,
meaningless to him and exciting and a little sad:</p>

<p>'We take the Golden Road to Samarkand.'</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<center>
<h1>CHAPTER XII</h1>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>The morning after his birthday, he wondered what it was that
had been plaguing his sleep--something confused and risky. He was
aghast as he remembered that he had made threats about becoming a
Kipling hero.</p>

<p>But slowly, as morning strength flowed into him, he rejoiced.
Yes! They hadn't licked him! He would do it! He would see many
golden roads beyond the walls of Samarkand . . . Incidentally,
where the deuce was Samarkand?</p>

<p>It was a frowsy day, cold for mid-spring, with a meaningless
drizzle that seemed more to rise from the sticky brown earth than
to drop from the disapproving skies. The rain was as dreary as
Sara's charge of last evening that he had been so imprisoned in
ruts that he couldn't even look over the edges.</p>

<p>In his shaky zest for freedom, he tried to defy the thought of
Sara, but he shrewdly watched himself during the routine of
dressing; he really saw himself; and that is, for any man over
thirty-five, no joyful sight before breakfast. He stood apart and
spied on his own fussing. He noticed that always, on rising, he
first looked at the still-sleeping Hazel, to see if she was
really there and still alive. On chilly mornings he always
completed the first layers of dressing in the warm bathroom. He
discovered that he always--but invariably with the prickliest
discomfort if he failed to follow the rite--hung his underclothes
on the bathroom hooks in the same order, with some fidgety notion
of its being easier thus to dress after his bath.</p>

<p>He noticed that, perhaps every morning for a good many years,
he had daily protested, 'All nonsense, this daily bath business.
As kids we only got bathed once a week, didn't we, and we didn't
smell so bad, did we?'</p>

<p>He noticed that he always soaped his feet before soaping his
knees, and that it was a struggle to reverse that order. He
noticed that it maddened him to find that the maid had left his
bottle of mouthwash on the window-sill instead of where, by all
the ritual proprieties, it belonged--in the medicine chest, and
not just stuck any old where in the medicine chest either, but
put away nicely and correctly between the sodium bicarbonate and
the aspirin.</p>

<p>Where it <i>belongs?</i> he queried, in rebellion against his
own pattern. Who passed that law?</p>

<p>He discovered that he always closed his eyes when he brushed
his teeth; furiously discovered that he had to close his
eyes.</p>

<p>It was distressing to admit that Sara could be right. Then it
was time to break the mould of his job and household and tricks
of personal habit, do anything, go anywhere, before he was
encased in the coffin of routine, a living dead man.</p>

<p>Yes, and he'd do it, too. Wasn't going to permit even the best
of habits to be his master. Already, he exulted, as he drew on
his coat and started downstairs, he was changing . . . and
noticed then that he had, as on every morning these last twenty
years, coughed a tiny and perfectly meaningless cough at the
exact moment when he tucked his watch into his lower left-hand
vest pocket . . . and that if he had inconceivably ever found the
watch in any other pocket, he would have felt naked.</p>

<p>So, with his exultations quenched, he went down to breakfast,
in the scarlet-and-canary-yellow 'nook' off the butler's pantry,
and as he heard himself muttering to the maid, 'I'll have my
coffee right with my porridge', he realized that he had said this
once a day for decades . . . and realized that if the <i>Morning
Recorder</i> had not been there, exactly where it 'belonged', six
inches to the right of his water glass, he would have felt
himself betrayed by his nearest and dearest.</p>

<p>'Looks like I've gotten in such a habit I simply can't start
the day without coffee and the baseball news. I better get out of
this quick.'</p>

<p>It was rather too bad, because for years he had enjoyed his
anecdotes about how ludicrously punctual his father had always
been. 'Yessir, neighbours used to set their clocks by him. Made
it kind of hard for a wild bunch like us young uns!' . . . How
many times, for how many years, had he been saying that? he
wondered.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>Hazel, as always--and he now perceived that she had her own
rigidities of habit--came down to breakfast as he was finishing.
She was, as always, drowsily apologetic for being late, but she
was so downy, so soft in her grey-and-crimson
<i>n&eacute;glig&eacute;,</i> so like a robin with ruffled
feathers, that her comfortableness reassured him. He would
achieve freedom, yes; but no concept of freedom that did not
include the presence of Hazel was imaginable. He was as married
as a cooing dove or an Anglican bishop. Once or twice in his
cheery life he may have looked with approval upon a cigar-store
wench or a grass-widow customer, but he had never wanted to live
on either cream puffs or caviare; and he knew that he would be
for ever hungry without the honest bread and butter of Hazel.</p>

<p>'Well, still like to maybe travel a little?' he said.</p>

<p>'Oh, yes,' Hazel babbled. 'I think it would be grand. My, I
would like to see this Westminster Cathedral or Monastery or
whatever it is where they're going to have the Coronation. It
must be a lovely church. Honestly, do you think we could go . . .
for a few weeks?'</p>

<p>'Could we? Say, we can do any doggone thing we doggone well
want to!' swore Fred.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>Sara made her entrance as he was leaving. She was less
purposeful and disciplinary this morning; she was, indeed, all
one youthful yawn, and she spoke to him tolerantly:</p>

<p>'Say, Dad, I hate most awfully to bother you, but my allowance
is nearly overdrawn. I wonder if you could let me have
twenty-five dollars? I had to lend twenty-five to a poor fellow
that came in to see Gene and me at the Coheeze yesterday.'</p>

<p>'Who? Why?'</p>

<p>'He's been out in Detroit helping organize the automobile
workers, and the cops were after him and he had to scram.'</p>

<p>'Scram--cops! What kind of language d'you call that, young
lady? Think that's what I sent you to Vassar to learn? Doggone
it, I'll be everlastingly doggoned if I'll stand for anybody
slinging that kind of slang and colloquialisms around this shack!
And just kindly lemme call to your attention the fact that I
happen to deal in motor cars, and I'm not any too darn rapturous
about sit-down strikes and Lord knows what all darn shenanigans
that keep me from getting cars to sell!'</p>

<p>'So you think the poor workers have no right to organize!'</p>

<p>'Sure they have, if they can get away with it. But we poor
God-forsaken bourjoyces also got the right to organize against
their sitting down on our pocket-books. Why should I hand
twenty-five bucks to your little comrade to help him keep me from
making a living! Go on and read the <i>Daily Worker</i> about
people like me, girl. It'll explain that I'm such a dirty dog
that it's a waste of time to expect me to dig down and support a
revolution against everything I stand for. That's all, just a
dirty dog, nothing but a dirty dog, just a bourjoyce bum--go on,
read your communist paper, just read it, that's all. Yessir,
dirty dog. And your allowance is overdrawn $68.60 already. Good
morning!'</p>

<p>Sara stared at the menacing purple aura left behind him when
the hall door had closed. Not since she had won the high-school
literary medal with an essay on the errors of Thomas Jefferson
had her muttonheaded parent dared so to speak to her. Her lips
flattened in rage, and she stormed, 'I see that, for your own
sake, darling, so you won't make yourself publicly ridiculous,
you will have to be taken in hand!'</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<center>
<h1>CHAPTER XIII</h1>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>Despite streets slippery as a soapy bathtub, grey as a kitchen
mop, Fred drove merrily to his office.</p>

<p>Shame to have to jump on poor Sara like that, but he'd had to
do it for her own sake, so that she wouldn't make herself
publicly ridiculous. And wasn't he already doing something about
his chronic routinitis? Hadn't he shown independence in refusing
to let the parental Sara nag him any longer?</p>

<p>Retire? Prob'ly not, but he certainly was going to take longer
vacations. He was going to study this travel proposition a little
more.</p>

<p>He came into the office whistling, with a feeling that it was
somehow particularly suitable, 'Columbia, the Gem of the Ocean'.
But he was restless. After the mail and the daily balance sheet,
he jumped up abruptly and announced to Paul Popple, 'Going out
for a breath of fresh air.'</p>

<p>'This time of day?'</p>

<p>'Yes, this time of day. I'm good and sick of being expected to
have my breakfast every morning at eight-fifteen, rain, pour or
shine, and always be in the office at eight forty-five, and sit
here all day and listen to every sub-agent that thinks he can
just walk in and waste my time. Don't know when I'll be back.
Don't ever get into too much of a rut, Paul. Learn to dominate
your habits, way I do.'</p>

<p>Fredk Wm, that man of mechanisms, usually drove, even in the
city, and economized on time by taking fifteen minutes to find a
parking space in order to avoid an eight-minute walk. But to-day
he tramped out into the rain, the collar of his leather jacket
high and a handkerchief thrust inside it. His legs had no
protection; presently his knees were itching with wetness, his
shoes were like sponges soaked in ice water, but he walked
sturdily and in bliss.</p>

<p>Everything in this sober inland city was inexplicably
transformed; everything was rosy as the hills of Georgia, blue as
the Caribbean.</p>

<p>At the window of a hardware shop, a row of dangling new
dishpans did not remind this ex-hardware-drummer of wholesale
prices on kitchenware, but of an Algerian market square. There
would be camels there prob'ly and mouse-coloured asses with tiny
bells, white-hooded men with red pointed shoes, and the smell of
musk and attar of rose. The blue and yellow dressing-gowns of
silk in Swazey &amp; Lindbeck's windows were to Fred nothing so
domestic; they belonged to mandarins in porcelain temples where
the doomed gongs boomed. The red pumps at a filling station were
letter boxes on Piccadilly, and in a 'gents' furnishing store'
there were orange bathing suits for Deauville.</p>

<p>He came to a liquor store, and saw vodka from Poland, rice
wine from Canton, and Moselle with castles upon the labels.</p>

<p>He sighed, and wilfully, just at the time when the office
would be busy and he sorely needed, he turned into the lunchroom
of 'Nick from Naples' and ordered coffee and sinkers.</p>

<p>'Ever go back to Naples, Nick?' he demanded.</p>

<p>'Sure. That's a fine place.'</p>

<p>'Can you sure enough see Vesuvius from there?'</p>

<p>'Sure, smoke alla time.'</p>

<p>'You can see smoke coming out of the volcano?'</p>

<p>'Sure. Smoke, coals, fire--ev'thing--shine like hell all
night.'</p>

<p>'Well sir, I cer'nly would like to see that. Glows at night,
eh? Well sir, that must be mighty interesting.' Fred turned to
the amiable, unshaven taxi-driver beside him and chuckled, 'Be
kind of nice to travel in Europe, if a fellow could afford
it.'</p>

<p>'O.K., I guess. My old man was born in Jugoslavia.'</p>

<p>'Is that a fact! Hear they got old walled cities there--yuh,
great, big thick long walls--built by the Romans! I'd like to see
'em.'</p>

<p>'Yuh.'</p>

<p>'By the Romans! Dog<i>gone!'</i></p>

<p>He was now emboldened to risk the implications suggested in
actually entering a travel bureau.</p>

<p>The clerk was amused by the excitement of what was to him just
a round little business man in a leather driving jacket, a
jesting, over-cordial little man, for this clerk was a person who
hated his job, who stood behind counters only till it should be
time to escape, and dash to the Y.M.C.A. and gloriously race with
himself on the rowing machine. He did not know that he was a
merchant of adventure; he supposed that he was selling minimum
rates, and tariffs on dogs and children, and reservations on
steamer chairs, and not the mist of dawn over rosy seas, Norman
cathedrals, goat-loud uplands in the Massif Central. But he will
have been of some use to civilization, for he enabled Fred to
walk out with pamphlets on Why Not Winter in Flowery South
Africa, Native Dances in the Island of Celebes, and Ski Haunts in
the Tyrol.</p>

<p>Fred could not promise himself that he would ever know his
South Africa, or speak whatever it is they do speak in the Island
of Celebes, and he professionally loathed skis--with a ski you
couldn't just put it in low and grind comfortably uphill. But he
liked the idea.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>While the mere body of Frederick William Cornplow, plump and
sometimes panting, unmagically draped in double-breasted blue
suits and startling red and green neckties, went about the office
correctly doing the correct things--delivering selling talks like
a phonograph, signing papers, planning a sales-floor addition to
house the trailers--the person inside Fred would have astounded
the customers, for he was not a man but a credulous child. Fred
was nourishing an idea greater than himself. He was like a small
boy who has, in a forest, found the entrance to a cave which
surely leads to the centre of the earth. He was playing with the
concept that there is no law that a man of fifty-six must stop
all of living except sleeping and reading the newspapers and
going to the bathroom. Why, he might have another thirty years of
vigour and experiment, and that was a journey which lay as far
ahead of him as was the journey back to the time when he had been
a brat of twenty-six, younger than Sara now! But he had to start
his pilgrimage out of hand; he had to undergo the ticklish
complications of retiring in a year or of taking a whole year's
vacation.</p>

<p>Having made this reasonable decision, in three days he
abruptly changed it--and with that the whole world changed. And
why not? For who in the world has ever been more important than
Fred Cornplow?</p>

<p>He has, at times, been too noisy or too prosy, he has now and
then thought more of money than of virtue and music; but he has
been the eternal doer; equally depended upon--and equally
hated--by the savage mob and by the insolent nobility.</p>

<p>When Fred Cornplow was an Egyptian, it was he who planned the
pyramids, conciliated the mad pharaohs, tried to make existence
endurable for the sweating slaves. In the days when he was called
a Roman Citizen, he was a centurion and he conquered Syria and
ruled his small corner of it with as much justice as the day
allowed.</p>

<p>As Fr. Abbot Cornplow, in the bright Dark Ages, he developed
agriculture and the use of building stone; later, as a captain
under Cromwell, he helped tame the political power of the
ecclesiastics. The American Civil War was not fought between
General Grant and General Lee, but between Private Fred Cornplow
of Massachusetts and Private Ed Cornplow of Alabama; and a few
years later it was they who created bribery and railroads and
gave all their loot to science.</p>

<p>From Fred Cornplow's family, between B.C. 1937 and A.D. 1937,
there came, despite an occasional aristocratic Byron or an
infrequent proletarian John Bunyan, nearly all the medical
researchers, the discoverers of better varieties of wheat, the
poets, the builders, the singers, the captains of great ships.
Sometimes his name has been pronounced Babbitt; sometimes it has
been called Ben Franklin; and once, if Eugene O'Neill may be
trusted, he went by the style of Marco Polo and brought back from
civilized China to barbaric Europe the sound of camel bells, and
the silken tents, scented with sandalwood, which have
overshadowed the continent ever since.</p>

<p>He is the eternal bourgeois, the bourjoyce, the burgher, the
Middle Class, whom the Bolsheviks hate and imitate, whom the
English love and deprecate, and who is most of the population
worth considering in France and Germany and these United
States.</p>

<p>He is Fred Cornplow; and when he changes his mind that crisis
is weightier than Waterloo or Thermopylae.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>No, Fred decided, he couldn't either retire or take a year's
vacation. Howard, confound him, was right; just now, he had to
stay by the ship. But he certainly wouldn't drudge on for another
ten or fifteen years. He would retire in five years from now,
exactly; he had made up his mind, and dog<i>gone,</i> let anybody
try to change it! And meantime he would gorgeously 'get in
shape.'</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>He felt absurd in doing it, but Fred was in training for
adventure. He stopped smoking before breakfast; he occasionally
walked to the office; and once or twice a week, with intense
distress and a feeling of being silly, he wabbled dumb-bells in
the Elks' gymnasium or joined in the calisthenics of a squad of
bankers and brokers and superintendents of schools, worthy
gentlemen who as dancers and high kickers resembled a mixed group
of turkeys and hippopotami enacting an Andalusian flower
song.</p>

<p>But he persisted. He had worked out for himself a principle:
'You'll never make any change in your life that you haven't
already begun.'</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>A fortnight after the beginning of Fred's madness, Howard
appeared in the office and croaked, 'Of course all those jokes
you pulled at your birthday party about retiring--I know you're
too responsible to do anything like that.'</p>

<p>'Well, <i>you</i> know, son--fellow sometimes feels like
kicking the dashboard.'</p>

<p>'Sure. I didn't take you seriously.'</p>

<p>'No? Well . . . Gosh it's hot for May.' Indeed, Fred was
wiping his forehead.</p>

<p>'Sure is. Yessir, actually hot!'</p>

<p>'Guess I'll drop in at Swazey &amp; Lindbeck's, this noon, and
pick me out a summer suit.'</p>

<p>'No, no.' Howard was pretty firm. 'They'll sting you. Go to
the Gotham Mart.'</p>

<p>'You think so?'</p>

<p>'I know it. And I don't want you to stop carrying a silk
muffler yet. Pretty fickle weather.'</p>

<p>'Yuh, I suppose . . . Though I bet your mother is sweating to
death, this morning, laying out her sweet peas.'</p>

<p>'And that's another thing. I've told Mother and I've told her,
but I just can't get her to listen to me. It's all foolishness,
her trying to grow sweet peas. Why don't she put in some good
sturdy rose bushes that don't need so much attention? But think
she'd pay any attention to me? Oh no!'</p>

<p>When Howard was gone, to drive back to Truxon College at a
conservative sixty miles an hour, Fred mused, 'So if the young
man should make good, and not always lean on me, fifteen years
from now he'd be tying up Hazel and me by the fireplace and
telling us when to breathe. Nothing doing! He travels the fastest
who travels alone . . . Always providing, of course, he has Hazel
with him, you understand.'</p>

<p> </p>

<h1>CHAPTER XIV</h1>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>No doubt Sara and Eugene Silga didn't deserve any particular
credit for it.</p>

<p>Their office was one stingy room on the third floor of the
Stiggis Building, between a photographer of riotous babies and
the agency for a platinum mine. They had nothing but two kitchen
tables, four kitchen chairs, a wire basket filled with bills, a
pile of rival radical magazines which damned one another for
luke-warmness in revolution, one window--dirty; and a
telephone--in arrears, but no doubt they enjoyed it more than a
plush and walnut office with respectful attendants. You can feel
more heroic in shirt-sleeves than in ermine.</p>

<p>In this primitive office of the Sachem Falls Cell of the
Workers' International Cohesion, and of <i>Protest &amp;
Progress,</i> Sara was luxuriously misreading proof on the
forthcoming first number, while Gene sputtered on the
telephone:</p>

<p>'Why, certainly, comrade, we'll provide the speakers . . .
Good? Listen! One of 'em's been beaten by the gorillas seven
times . . . Sure, all the decorations; I've got a
four-by-seven-foot poster of Lenin . . . No. Fifty per cent of
the gate . . . No, won't touch it for less . . . All right, you
talk to 'em and give me a ring.'</p>

<p>Gene glanced at her with those eyes, daring and amused, that
seemed to understand her every foolishness and desire. She didn't
<i>care,</i> resolved Sara; she would marry Gene even if they had
to live in a one-room flat and she do the cooking. Oh yes; that
was what she had been trying to remember: she must learn to
cook.</p>

<p>She chucked the proofs and swam shyly toward him. She panted
as he smiled at her with his especial smile of friendliness, but
what he said was:</p>

<p>'Sara!'</p>

<p>'Yes, Gene!'</p>

<p>'I, uh . . . You know these Channing Praggs--the glass
manufacturer? Think you could get old lady Pragg to pull a
soir&eacute;e, or whatever she calls it, for me? I'll spiel on
birth control in Russia and pass the hat. Isn't it funny,
darling!' He patted her hand, which was clenching the edge of his
table-desk. 'Nobody comes through with funds for the revolution
like the wives of millionaires, even after we've openly announced
we intend to overthrow the Democratic State and institute a real,
honest-to-God dictatorship of the rednecks like me. How come?
You're a capitalist, darling. Why do you guys in the ruling class
let us get away with it?'</p>

<p>'I don't think Mr. Frederick W. Cornplow is as keen on our
getting away with it as I'd like to see. We'll have to work on
him a lot yet, dear.'</p>

<p>Their laughter was a gust that blew away all such
featherbrains as Fred. She was certain that Gene was going to
show a little more affection now than just the patting of hands
which had been his only gesture, and she leaned over the shining
blackness of his hair--as Frieda Kitz clumped into the
office.</p>

<p>Frieda earned her living in a wall-paper warehouse; she was
treasurer of the Coheeze; she never laughed except for a
triumphant snort at the thought of a firing squad's converting
the Praggs and Cornplows; and though she had a tranquil
broad-browed loveliness, she wore her hair tight and never
dressed in anything but stiff corduroy suits and flat low
shoes.</p>

<p>Sara looked at Frieda with hatred--she at Sara with
contempt--while Gene greeted Frieda all too quietly, too
understandingly, 'Good morning, comrade.'</p>

<p>Sara felt that she had been sent back to the kitchen. She had
been snubbed by amateur snobs like Mrs. Channing Pragg; not till
now had she been snubbed by an expert like Comrade Kitz. She
crept to her desk and the suddenly hateful proofs.</p>

<p>Gene and the Comrade did not seem to think that she was
important enough to hide their secrets from her as they talked
softly at his desk of orders from the great lords of communism in
New York. Sara was as uncomfortable as she had felt when, at ten,
she had blundered into one of her mother's tiny coffee parties
and heard those shocking bores, the Grown-up Ladies, confiding,
'Oh, they say he drinks', and 'In October, she told me.'</p>

<p>She was sickened by the easy intimacy with which Gene and
Frieda shook hands at parting, needing to say nothing beyond a
soft, revealing, 'So long, comrade.' But she made no comment on
Frieda, as Gene again pulled toward him the telephone on which,
all day long, he placidly forwarded his plans to smash the
American government. She buckled to work. She had not learned
until now that most banal, most ancient, most weighty truth, that
there is refuge in work.</p>

<p>Sara was magnificently playing the role of new broom. She was
assistant secretary of the Coheeze, and managing editor (the
other editors were Eugene Silga) as well as two-finger
stenographer and advertising solicitor of <i>Protest &amp;
Progress.</i> She wrote the minor editorials, with happy thought
of how much they were going to annoy Fred, and in them felt
herself a combination of Queen Marie, Emma Goldman, Lady Astor,
Virginia Woolf and Charlotte Corday. It was a good job, this
profession of being not merely allowed but encouraged to clout
every head that rose above the mob, and of actually being paid
for doing it--provided she went out and raised funds for the
payment.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>Into the office exploded their collaborators, Howard Cornplow
and Guy Staybridge, with the uncollaborative, the hopelessly
<i>bourgeois</i> Annabel tagging after them.</p>

<p>'Gene! Gene! I've got a poem for you! Wrote it in biology
class!' crowed Guy. "This'll stir up the fakers in Washington.
Listen:</p>

<p> </p>

<blockquote>
<p>'"Here is a dime," the President said,<br>
 "If you'll vote for me twice and bow your head.<br>
 Red roses rioting North and South--<br>
 Think of them buddy, and shut your mouth.<br>
 Go buy you a suit of clothes," he said,<br>
 "But careful, buddy, the coat ain't red!"'</p>
</blockquote>

<p> </p>

<p>'Fine! Fine!' said Gene easily, and for that ease Sara loved
him. He dropped the poem into the pasteboard box which, Sara
knew, held the manuscripts he had accepted and would never
publish. He gushed, 'Hope you've been able to raise a little
dough, Guy. Kind of a crisis with the "P. &amp; P." If our
friends will help us to get through this month . . .'</p>

<p>'Yeh, I got fifteen dollars from Dr. Gomber, the professor of
drama--he sympathizes with communism--he's got plenty money--his
father owns in on the Piping Rock Explosives Corporation.' Guy
handed over a wrinkled ten-dollar bill and a five. These did not
go into any pasteboard box, but into Gene's vest pocket, and Gene
turned on Howard with an affectionate, 'How about you, old
man?'</p>

<p>Howard was looking vaguely at the window. 'You ought to have
more air in here, Gene. If I had time I could fix it so you'd
have more air in here, Gene.'</p>

<p>'I'm sure you could, Howard, but did you manage to raise any
funds?'</p>

<p>'Oh, I was going to, but I've been awful busy.'</p>

<p>'Sure, but the world revolution has to be pretty busy, too,
Howard.'</p>

<p>'Well now, I'll tell you how I feel about that, Gene. I can't
say I'm entirely sold on communism.' Howard looked as handsome as
Pike's Peak at sunset and as dumb. 'With my scientific training,
Gene, you got to show me the data--show me the data; the thing is
. . .'</p>

<p>'The data,' chirped Annabel, sitting on a pile of 'Proletarian
Art'.</p>

<p>Howard faced her crossly. 'Well, what about it? Don't
<i>you</i> think you gotta have the data, Bell?'</p>

<p>'Sure. Data is the goods.'</p>

<p>'You're so frivolous all the time! You got no idea the risks I
take, in a conservative dump like Truxon, coming right out for
the left wing. Are you with me or aren't you?'</p>

<p>'I'm with you, beautiful, just the same as your mother will be
with your father, no matter how much she may kick beforehand, if
he ever decides to go and do something sweet and crazy.'</p>

<p>Sara and Howard swapped glances of surprise. It had not
occurred to them that anybody, certainly not a flippant young
woman, certainly not a superior Staybridge, could speak of their
matter-of-fact parents with enthusiastic affection.</p>

<p>'Howard!' Sara demanded. 'Tell me something more about rockets
for aerial power. Just exactly how do they work,
mechanically?'</p>

<p>'Rockets?'</p>

<p>'Good heavens, don't you remember that the other day you were
making a fortune out of them? Come through now; don't hold out
all this priceless information on your comrade and sister,
stupid. How do the rockets work? I've got to write something
about 'em.'</p>

<p>Annabel was helpful: 'The aviator wears an opera hat with the
rockets in 'em, and every time he shuts the thing, a rocket goes
off.'</p>

<p>'Can it!' said Howard.</p>

<p>'Don't be an idiot,' said Sara.</p>

<p>'Darling!' said Gene.</p>

<p>'Check,' said Annabel.</p>

<p>'Now rockets,' said Howard, 'these rockets--well, if you want
a technical explanation, they're affixed to the, I think it's the
rear of the fuselage, I think it's the fuselage, and--well, they
go off, and the sum of the reaction is equal to the reaction, I
mean to the action, and there you are, Sara, can't you see? If
you'd only studied physics, instead of all this literature and
stuff!'</p>

<p>'My beautiful,' yearned Annabel.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>Winnie Weston Blear's Tea Room was to Sachem Falls a
combination of all the Greenwich Village restaurants that begin
with Ye and all the Broadway restaurants in which legitimate
theatrical producers have a farewell drink before catching the
train for Hollywood. Mrs. Blear's establishment had caviare once
or twice a year, you could get slivovitz if you knew the head
waitress, and English muffins were practically obligatory. Here
exhibited themselves the featured players of the Spreadeagle
Little Theatre, all the violin teachers in town, and the local
literary celebrity--the dramatic critic on the <i>Evening
Tidings,</i> who had written a book on his travels in New
Zealand.</p>

<p>Guy took all of the 'P. &amp; P.' conspirators, except Gene,
who had a rendezvous with the telephone, over to Mrs. Blear's and
went cosmopolitan on them. His father, the bleak Mr. Putnam
Staybridge, had once suffered Guy's presence for two weeks in
London and one in Paris, and Guy explained now, to the
untravelled Howard and Sara and Annabel, how sophisticated were
cream cheese with bar le duc, avocado soaked with cura&ccedil;ao,
and Stilton with port--while the nearest they came to these
elegances was cinnamon toast with chilly tea.</p>

<p>Annabel paid attention to her brother not with her ears but
with her memory. For years she had listened to her father and Guy
being airy about European food, and that may explain why she
looked so fondly on a Howard who confessed that he knew no more
about Stilton (which he seemed to regard as some variety of
sponge cake) than a rabbit. Howard warmed handsomely to her
stilly gaze, and suddenly, to the disgust of those hard-boiled
communist warriors, Sara and Guy, he demanded of Annabel:</p>

<p>'Are you crazy about me?'</p>

<p>'Absolutely.'</p>

<p>'How crazy?'</p>

<p>'Catatonics, catelepsies and cataclysms.'</p>

<p>Sara barked, 'I'm going to the office.'</p>

<p>'And me,' said Guy. 'When do you publish my poem?'</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<center>
<h1>CHAPTER XV</h1>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>While Fred, with Hazel on the arm of his chair, was reading
the first copy of <i>Protest &amp;</i> <i>Progress,</i> Sara
pretended to be lost in the <i>Daily Worker,</i> and over it she
watched them with what she hoped was cynical amusement.</p>

<p>On the 'P. &amp; P.' cover, in a technique familiar to Fred
from the high-school papers his children had once brought home,
was a caricature labelled 'A Dictator of the Auto Industry',
depicting a grossly fat man drinking champagne from a magnum.
That was fairly easy for Hazel to understand, but she balked at
two other caricatures, 'Workers Unite!' and 'The Newest Deal'. In
the first, 'Labour' was revealed as an agonized dwarf lashed by a
diabolic monster named 'Capital', but in the second Labour was a
young and singing giant who laughed at a wizened Capital held in
the palm of his brawny hand: a hand worthy of a structural steel
worker or even of Litvinoff.</p>

<p>Hazel worried, 'Look, Fred, I don't get that. If Labour is
such a shrimp in one place and gets all beat up by Capital, how
come he can squeeze Capital so, two pages farther on?'</p>

<p>'Hush, Hazel. That shows how fast the Coheeze is working.
Don't be bourjoyce.'</p>

<p>Sara sniffed.</p>

<p>The bourjoyces studied, then, the 'P. &amp; P.'s' news from
Russia.</p>

<p>With only nineteen years since the revolution, it appeared,
the Soviets had built factories, railroads, playgrounds and a
twelve-story hotel.</p>

<p>'Hm. Pretty good. Still, that's the same period as from 1865
to 1884, when America built up the entire West, after having had
the stuffin's knocked out of her in the Civil War,' said
Fred.</p>

<p>To his delight, that did draw Sara. 'Entirely different,' she
proclaimed. 'How?' said Fred. 'Any number of ways,' said
Sara.</p>

<p>He was not so well pleased when he read Eugene Silga's
interview with the executive vice-president of the Colonial Motor
Car Company, which presented the executive as a languider,
pouchier and more mulish version of George III, ignorant alike of
motor engineering and of the living conditions of the workers.
This demon Fred had met in Detroit; he knew that he was the son
of a blacksmith, an engineer who was equally interested in
rear-end motors, in mountain climbing and in hospitals. 'We are
not amused,' felt Fred.</p>

<p>'Huh. Oh, Hazel--jus' second--almost forgot--phone the
Kamerkinks about Sunday--c'mon, jus' second,' he blurted. As
Hazel opened her mouth, he pinched her arm in caution, and she
followed him into the hall. He led her not to the telephone but
to the coat closet.</p>

<p>'Eh?' she wondered.</p>

<p>'Hush. Take a swig of this. Maybe it'll get us through the
intelligence test without our kicking Sara.'</p>

<p>He had taken from the inside pocket of an aged raincoat a
bottle of gin; he gargled at it and handed it over.</p>

<p>'Oh, so that's where you keep it! No. I can't drink the
beastly stuff . . . Straight? I never heard--I never heard of . .
. My, that has got a kick . . . I do feel better!'</p>

<p>They read through the editorials, two of which began:</p>

<p> </p>

<blockquote>
<p>So-called modern ingenuity is producing a wealth of mechanical
gadgets which, if they were conceived of as serving the
Proletariat and as vehicles for sound Propaganda, would be
triumphs of popular achievement. Such innovations as trailers,
easily transported and opening out into four- or five-room
houses, television, and the probable future of propulsion of
airships by rockets, so that one could go from New York State to
Moscow in six or eight hours, should institute a new
civilization, but to the dull, greedy, cruel and unimaginative
mind of the American 'business man' they are nothing but future
sources of profit wherewith he can the better contribute to the
funds of the Fascist armies threatening Russia.</p>
</blockquote>

<p> </p>

<p>And:</p>

<p> </p>

<blockquote>
<p>A sardonically amusing revelation of the mind of the American
'business man' is found in the fact that as soon as he can pile
up the swag, he betrays his real lack of interest in his calling
by hoping to retire. Naturally! He has none of the deep inner
satisfaction felt by Soviet experts in building permanently and
for the people.</p>
</blockquote>

<p> </p>

<p>'Now who do you suppose could have written those two gems?'
said Fred. 'Sara!'</p>

<p>Coolly: 'Yes?'</p>

<p>'I've been looking at your new Coheeze paper.'</p>

<p>'Yes?'</p>

<p>'I've got a new title for it; same alliteration: "Prig and
Prattle".'</p>

<p>'Are you being humorous, Father?'</p>

<p>'Not very. When you get a real communist fanatic that's as het
up as a prohibition reformer or a censorship maniac, and let him
also use machine-guns and firing squads the way he wants to,
maybe it sounds humorous, but I don't suppose it is.'</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<center>
<h1>CHAPTER XVI</h1>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>Her mother had gone to bed; her father, Sara guessed, with
just a little uneasiness, had shown unusual powers of keeping his
mouth shut and, without any lecture on the subject, had made it
clear that he would not contribute to the Coheeze. But that was
only part of her troubles, and she said to him coaxingly:</p>

<p>'Sometimes you think I don't appreciate how hard you work,
Father, but I do. I've been learning about real work. Not only at
the Coheeze . . . I don't suppose you care to talk much about
that. But I have so many other activities, too. Did you know I'm
going to enter the club tennis tournament this summer?'</p>

<p>'That sounds better.'</p>

<p>'And I'm afraid I'll have to contribute to the courts fund and
my allowance is so shamefully overdrawn . . .'</p>

<p>'Ten dollars be enough? . . . No? . . . Fifteen? . . . No?
Well, twenty-five, and that's my limit!'</p>

<p>'Oh, I suppose we can get away with that . . .'</p>

<p>'"We"?'</p>

<p>'But if the club were only the end of it! Here I've gone and
got myself mixed up with the amateur summer theatre that the
Spreadeagle Little Theatre is sponsoring, and they've elected me
chairman of the Box Office, Seats, and Ushering Committee--of
course it is quite an honour, with Mrs. Channing Pragg and Putnam
Staybridge (and how <i>he</i> ever came to have a tacky daughter
like Annabel I don't know; wait; don't shoot; if Howard and you
say she's pretty, I suppose she must be)--and with them on the
board of directors, it's quite a social honour, and so of course
I'll have to try and raise a fifty- or seventy-five-dollar
subscription, somehow or other . . .'</p>

<p>And Fred fired, after keeping his powder so dry so long:</p>

<p>'I know I'm just a clodhopper, that's all, nothing but a
clodhopper, just a clown, that's all, nothing but a dumb bunny,
but I'll be everlastingly doggoned if I can understand how you
can hook up your doggoned Young Men's Anarchist Association with
guzzling tea with Sister Pragg and kissing the doggone snobs in
the tennis association . . .'</p>

<p>'Yes? Perhaps I might just happen to convert them to
socialism.'</p>

<p>'And perhaps you might just happen to not do anything of the
kind. You look here, Sara: I've always given you all the
allowance I thought I could afford, but now you're proposing to
support not only Holy Russia and Holy Joe Stalin but also the
white-pants aggregation, and this amateur-dramatics-in-a-barn . .
.'</p>

<p>'"Dramatics"!'</p>

<p>'. . . circus, that Sister Pragg would do anything for it
except ever come through with a cent, I--well, I'm afraid you'll
have to get Comrade Silga to increase your salary--from about ten
bucks a week minus to something plus--and then devote that to
these children's games.'</p>

<p>At the end of that scene, as he described it to Hazel in their
bathroom, 'She went and got hurt, and then she walked out on me.
Oh, I don't want to be mean, but I don't like to see her--yes, or
see me--falling for people that just use her for what they can
get out of her,' he worried, while Hazel, smoothing his cheek,
was worried along with him.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>He was the more dependent upon the security of home because he
was too busy and doing too well. The Triumph and Houndtooth were
prospering; the Duplex Trailer was a sensation; and he had to
bounce all over his district, leasing out Duplex rights to
sub-agents, and thus getting rid, wherever he could, of
responsibility. That he also got rid thus of much of his profits
he did not tell his family.</p>

<p>He said nothing about retiring; he did not think about it very
clearly; but he kept up his absurdly grave 'training'; and he was
giving Paul Popple more experience in accounting and sales.</p>

<p>''F anything ever happened to me, ought to be somebody else
could kind of take charge--just temporarily,' he said to
Paul.</p>

<p>In one bright idea he had a regrettable failure.</p>

<p>Among the less desirable features of the Triumph shop, along
with rats, high insurance rates and a smell of sewer gas, was the
continued presence of his near-cousins, Cal and Mac Tillery. Fred
had, briefly, been too much of a coward to fire them and to risk
receiving the hurt letter which their sire, Cousin Enos, would
inevitably write.</p>

<p>He had tried them at cleaning cars, until too many owners
complained of wet upholstery, and of running boards abloom with
soaked cigarette butts; he had tried them at selling gasoline,
until he noticed that with each gallon they donated five minutes
of bright backwoods chatter about the weather--'Hot, I'll say
it's hot. Oh boy, is it hot to-day--say, it was hot when I woke
up this morning--oh boy, was it hot!' Painting did not seem
suited to the particular talents of Cal and Mac; they broke spray
guns and made the car bodies contrasts of gummy spots with
patches entirely bare. At last Fred had put them to packing and
toting boxes in the supply department, which they did fairly
well, except when they dropped the boxes, lost them or used them
as targets for tobacco juice.</p>

<p>In whatever job they might be, they told all colleagues and
all customers, 'We're Fred Cornplow's own cousins. He's learned
how to get away with it, but say, is that guy a hick! Oh
boy!'</p>

<p>Fred begged of them, tenderly, 'Boys, now summer's coming,
don't you suppose your dad will need you on his farm?'</p>

<p>'His what?'</p>

<p>'His farm. In West Virginia. From the government.'</p>

<p>'Oh. That. Oh, Dad never got there. He run into a cousin of
Ma's, on the way, that's got a wild animal farm, and he and Ma
and the kids are staying there to help train the tigers.'</p>

<p>'Well, well, Cal! That's fine, Mac! That must be mighty
interesting! Don't you want to join him? I hear tigers make fine
pets. I'd be glad to pay your railroad fares.'</p>

<p>'Naw. Dad wrote me a postcard; he said Cousin Albert was an
awful tightwad and gives 'em rotten grub. He got so sore he
prett' near left Cousin Albert flat. No, we like it all right
here, Fred. We'll stick by you.'</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>By Sara, Fred sent word to Gene Silga that if he could use one
or two fine young men, just the sort of real proletarians to whom
Gene wished to hand the control of the American government, Fred
could supply them, and he might even contribute to the
Coheeze.</p>

<p>Eugene sent back jeering word: 'The Soviets and their fellow
travellers don't want shiftless bums any more than the
capitalists do; in fact, not being sentimental like the soppy
American capitalists, the Bolsheviks give slackers a choice
between working and losing citizenship.'</p>

<p>It was at that moment that Fred almost joined the communists.
And he felt thus for a second time when Howard dragged in his
playful friend, Ben Bogey, whose slogan was 'Homes that are nice
at lowest price'.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<center>
<h1>CHAPTER XVII</h1>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>Having had words with the dean on the matter of tooting his
horn in front of Henry Ward Beecher Hall at dawn, Howard came
down to Sachem and the Coheeze office to have company during the
agony of being solitary and rebellious.</p>

<p>It was all off with Annabel; she had told him that she
regarded his well-considered plan of studying finger-prints and
becoming a G-man as less than practical; love's labour was lost
and Annabel could go to the devil.</p>

<p>There were but two weeks before commencement, but he still had
his lamentable senior year to undergo, and he hit on the good new
notion that it would be sensible to spend it in Moscow. Gene
Silga hadn't exactly said so, but Howard was fairly sure that he
remembered hearing somebody say that, in Russia, university
students spent most of their time shooting, leaping out of
aeroplanes with absolutely safe parachutes, and bathing with lady
students who were crazy about Americans.</p>

<p>At a cost in oil, gasoline, depreciation and sustaining hot
dogs--to omit the interest and overhead--of approximately seven
times what it would have cost to have the envelopes addressed
professionally, Howard had come down from Truxon and was sitting
now on a small box in front of a big box, addressing Coheeze
letters which informed their 'friends and loyal supporters' that
if they could just come through once more, <i>Protest &amp;</i>
<i>Progress</i> would get along prosperously for ever. Gene was
telephoning to the local liberal pastor; Sara was picking out on
a portable typewriter an editorial revealing that Kathleen
Norris, Andrew Mellon and Dizzy Dean were plotting against the
independence of Mexico.</p>

<p>Their happy hour of conspiracy was interrupted by the entrance
of a bald but youthful male in spats and a belted coat, who
handed to each of them a card:</p>

<p>'What would I do with a home?' said Gene.</p>

<p>'Too much home already,' said Sara.</p>

<p>'Can I sell you a subscription to <i>Protest &amp;
Progress?'</i> said Howard.</p>

<p>'You bet; I'll take a subscription right now!' said Ben.</p>

<p>'Well, I'll be darned . . . How much does one cost?' Howard
inquired of Gene.</p>

<p>Ben Bogey cheerfully handed over two dollars and a half, which
was more real money than that office had seen for a week; he
popped his hat off his head in greeting to Sara; he patted it
back on again with a gesture like a vaudeville hoofer's; he sat
on the edge of Sara's table and went into action:</p>

<p>'The home I'm thinking of just now isn't for you folks
personally. You can kid me, but I'm sure you've got cosy little
hideaways of your own. The home I'm thinking about is for your
magazine, and your society, this International Workers'
whatever-it-is--I forget. My firm is developing a new development
on a new principle of developing. It's going to be the first
addition in the world that's got culture for a selling point. We
don't want to contact brokers or even bankers, but docs and
lawyers and advertising men and radio announcers and real
intellectuals like that. I can offer you a whole floor in a fine,
made-over, old, ancient house, built back in 1890 but with all
necessary modern improvements, including electric ice-water
cooler, for a mere two hundred dollars a month.</p>

<p>'You'll be taken right into the social and artistic activities
of the community. Why, I wouldn't wonder if you'd be invited to a
reception-tea by Mrs. Stotes Emery--and there's a real author for
you--her husband is the big bond house, and she's had poems
published in a bound book that, I know for a fact, has been sent
to G. B. Wells and a number of other famous foreign scribes for
their criticism, and she'd be tickled to death to advise and
inspire you . . .'</p>

<p>'Comrade Bogey!' Gene was smiling; Gene sounded affectionate.
'We're both working the same side of the avenue! I address street
meetings myself. I'm afraid you don't understand that our little
sheet is entirely subversive. We're what is known as
Reds--Radicals--Dangerous Alien Elements; and I'm afraid that
Pansy Park . . . You did say, didn't you, that was the name of
your garden suburb?'</p>

<p>'No; it's Lilac Lane. Pansy Park would make a swell name to
use, though. Excuse me if I jot it down.'</p>

<p>'Certainly, comrade. What I'm getting at is that your sterling
community would throw us out on our ears.'</p>

<p>'That's just where you're off your base. Red Radicalism is the
newest, the most fashionable racket there is to-day. Nothing a
banker's wife likes so much as to hear that her husband may get
stuck up before a firing squad. Say, nothing will get publicity
and pack his pews for a liberal clergyman, with a wife and seven
children and a mortgage, as much as to say at a society dinner
party that family life is going to be abolished. No. You boys
come in with us and we'll give you three months' rent free.'</p>

<p>'So kind of you, comrade, but we happen to believe in our
"racket". We don't like rich women that give you tea and
advice.'</p>

<p>'Good God, who does! I'm not talking about liking it; I'm
talking about young fellows trying to get along!'</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>Not for fifteen minutes did Gene make a real effort to get rid
of Ben Bogey, for like all people who work in offices, including
magazine offices, publishers' offices and the clangorous offices
of latter-day authors, with their lecture and radio and cinema
departments, Gene was pleased by anything like an excuse to stop
telephoning. When Ben went cheerily out, Howard stuttered,
'S-s-say, could I see you for just a minute, Mr. Bogey? Let's go
across the street and have a cuppacoffee.'</p>

<p>At Ye Olde Robin's Egg Rotisserie, Howard confided, 'I'm
finishing up college next year, and I've been thinking right
along I'd like to go into the real-estate game. Course I've been
offered chances in developing television and frog farms and all
that sort of bunk, but real estate has always been my one
ambition.'</p>

<p>Howard was not lying; he was merely being dramatic and
self-convinced, as was Howard's father when he said that he liked
writing orders in triplicate.</p>

<p>'I'm not a communist, you understand, Mr. Bogey; I was just in
there because I've got a sister works there. Say, I've got a
swell idea for a new kind of suburb.'</p>

<p>'Yeah?' cautiously.</p>

<p>'Instead of measly little houses, everybody live in one big
skyscraper--go call on your neighbours, winter evenings, not have
to get your feet wet--and use all the land for playgrounds and
great, big, huge gardens. And grottos, maybe.'</p>

<p>'Yeah?' wearily. 'Listen, brother. In the real-estate game you
don't want ideas--you want prospects.'</p>

<p>'But I was thinking--I'm sure I could get my dad to back
me--he don't know what to do with all the money he makes, he's
such a slave of routine, and with him behind me . . .'</p>

<p>'Who is your dad?'</p>

<p>'F. W. Cornplow, the district agent for the Triumph.'</p>

<p>'Oh yes, sure. I heard him talk once at the Boosters' Club.
Great salesman. Great! Wish I could interest him in a new rental.
I've got the sweetest proposition for a motor agency in this
man's town . . .'</p>

<p>'Let's go and see him. Got your bus here? Shall I give you a
lift?'</p>

<p>'Got my coop parked right across. You go ahead and I'll trail
you.'</p>

<p>'O.K., Ben.'</p>

<p>'Swell. What do they call you for short, baby?'</p>

<p>Arm in arm, the two swarmed into Fred's office.</p>

<p>'Dad, want you to meet Ben Bogey, the best little real-estate
salesman in Sachem, and he's got the slickest proposition for a
motor-agency rental in this man's town . . .'</p>

<p>Fred considered Ben's spats, he considered Ben's belted coat,
and he was noticeably uncordial. 'I've got a rental!'</p>

<p>Ben Bogey stepped forward and took the limelight away from
Howard. 'I know what a busy man you are, Mr. Cornplow . . .'</p>

<p>'I am!'</p>

<p>'. . . and I won't take your time just now, but if you are
interested in air, light, space, costs-saving . . .'</p>

<p>'I am not. I loathe all of 'em.'</p>

<p>'I see, but . . .'</p>

<p>Howard laughed. 'You better listen to the old scoundrel, Dad,
because Ben and me have just fixed it up to start a real-estate
firm.'</p>

<p>'On who? On Ben?'</p>

<p>'Not exactly, Dad. I'm sure that when you hear our plans
you'll be able to see your way clear . . .'</p>

<p>'Come back next year, Howard, and we'll talk it over, and
now--please--go--<i>away!'</i></p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>Annabel was small and forlorn, at the end of a mahogany couch,
pride of the Staybridge Mansion. She peeped at the telephone out
in the hall. By now, she thought, the instrument must be so well
trained that she would have but to pick up the receiver to be
connected with Truxon College.</p>

<p>Why, she thought, did she ever call him up? Howard never said
anything on the telephone but 'Ullo, ullo, ullo' in what he
considered an English accent. But he was so cheerful and
knowable, in contrast to her cultured Parent, whose level voice
was always a veil, soaked in ice water, between them.</p>

<p>Forlorn and very small. Actually, Annabel was as tall as her
father, who sat in elegant flowing lines at the other end of the
drawing-room. But so erect was his pride and self-satisfaction
that, beside her, he seemed like an obelisk.</p>

<p>He did not pretend to be reading; frankly he was watching her,
everything she did, and she became jerky. She looked away from
the telephone. She rose and paced toward the fireplace, airily
swinging her hands, trying to think of any reason why she should
go to the fireplace. She moved the brass Buddha on the
mantelpiece two inches to the right; she felt her father's
condemnatory glance scorching her back, and hastily she moved
Buddha back again. With a fine fingertip, she smoothed the cool
glossy cover of a garden magazine--and peeped at the
telephone.</p>

<p>Her fingers wandered through the poems of Yeats; the old
edition, with the cross and the mystic rose and falling leaves
upon the cover, which her father had brought home from London
thirty years ago and which, after her mother's death, he had been
wont to read to her until suddenly she had awakened to the charm
of the lines, at which he immediately became impatient of them,
said they were sentimental, for milk-sick girls, and threw the
book on the floor. She had picked it up and defiantly treasured
it.</p>

<p>He was half sneering at her now as she read again:</p>

<p> </p>

<blockquote>
<p>. . . the land of faery<br>
 Where nobody gets old and godly and grave,<br>
 Where nobody gets old and crafty and wise,<br>
 Where nobody gets old and bitter of tongue;<br>
 And she is still there, busied with a dance,<br>
 Deep in the dewy shadow of a wood,<br>
 Or where stars walk upon a mountain-top.</p>
</blockquote>

<p> </p>

<p>Again she looked toward the telephone, and he spoke suavely,
like a man superior to all emotion:</p>

<p>'It would be obvious, wouldn't it, Ann, that you are expecting
a telephone call from this bloated young bruiser, Cornplow, this
study in the mind of primitive man, whom you have been seeing
lately?'</p>

<p>'He isn't bloated. But I am expecting him to phone . . .'</p>

<p>'The word is "telephone".'</p>

<p>'. . . or to drop in.'</p>

<p>'Drop into what? The speech of youth to-day is very
picturesque. It lacks only one thing that speech normally should
have--an intelligible meaning . . .'</p>

<p>She was screaming.</p>

<p>'Stop, stop, stop, stop! Dear God, I get so sick of your
making spider webs of words that choke me! Howard <i>is</i>
simple! That's one reason I like him! He's like daylight and
fresh air, and this place is like a dungeon!'</p>

<p>'I trust you like his family, also--they are certainly on the
simple, fresh-airish side.'</p>

<p>'I do! Especially his father. There's such nice wiggly lines
beside his eyes, where he laughs. And you dare to patronize him!
Oh, I do hate you!'</p>

<p>'Are you quite sure, my dear Ann? I suspect that, at least, my
superciliousness will keep you from making a fool of yourself . .
.'</p>

<p>And then, astonishingly, Howard was ringing the doorbell.
After her father's wry, dark, feline teasing, the young man
seemed to Annabel like a jolly St. Bernard. She clasped his solid
chunk of a hand and towed him into the drawing-room.</p>

<p>Mr. Putnam Staybridge was a successful experimenter in moods.
He had already dropped the venom and honey, the purr of a cat
with a mouse, and he barked like a terrier:</p>

<p>'Good evening, Howard, I daresay you would agree that the
weather is warm.'</p>

<p>'Uh . . .'</p>

<p>'I see that we are in accord about the weather.'</p>

<p>'Uh . . .'</p>

<p>'But there is, perhaps, a weightier topic. I don't know
whether you have the intelligence to perceive it, but it looks to
me as though you either had grossly improper intentions, as they
call 'em, toward my daughter, or else you are young idiot enough
to think that you could marry her. Which, eh? Which?'</p>

<p>'W-why, I'll tell you, Mr. Staybridge . . .'</p>

<p>'Don't stammer!'</p>

<p>'Well, golly, springing things like that so suddenly--hard for
a fellow to answer, right off the bat . . .'</p>

<p>Light fingers on his arm, Annabel had guided Howard to a stiff
Colonial settee, and she perched beside him, like a cowbird
chaperoning an ox, while he struggled:</p>

<p>'Course, maybe I suppose I ought to finish college before I
think about getting married, sir, but I certainly am crazy about
Bell, and the minute I get out, I hope to land a good job and be
able to support her.'</p>

<p>'It is your notion, then, that all Miss Annabel needs is to be
provided with food and lodging? She seems to me to be quite
adequately cared for already. Has it occurred to you that it
would also be necessary for you to learn her language; the
language I've reared her to speak?'</p>

<p>'Her language?'</p>

<p>'Quite! If you see this as in a glass, darkly, Miss Annabel
might be willing to explain.'</p>

<p>Mr. Staybridge did not, as usual, embarrass them by snatching
up his toys and going home; he embarrassed them more by sitting
in easy indifference, reading Baron Corvo. If in the chill of
that dry ice Annabel and Howard were too congealed for speech,
their touching hands were voluble, and soundlessly they crept
into the hall, out to a stiff white bench beside a stiff red plot
of roses.</p>

<p>June, moon, tune--roses red and joybells soon; it should all
have been a comedy of boy meets girl; but actually the young
people were shaken with fear of Putnam Staybridge's contempt,
fear of a world where the commonplaces of jobs and rent and food
had become as difficult as winning an empire; and most of all,
fear of their own overwhelming and illogical love, released now
by Putnam's jibes.</p>

<p>Annabel dropped her protective street-corner flipness, all the
'O.K.s' and 'Swells' she had adopted equally from shopgirls and
from the elegant Junior Leaguers. Howard was frightened out of
his heavy humour. With his arm desperate about her shoulder, he
could feel her tremble, her arm and shoulder tremble, as though
every muscle were a shaken cord, and he was trembling himself as
he struggled:</p>

<p>'G-golly, I g-guess we got to do something about it. I can't
stand being away from you any more. All the fellows at Truxon,
yellin' and throwing books around, and even drinking gin, and I'm
beginning to think gin is awfully bad for your digestion, and the
bums, they come bursting into my room any hour, day or night, in
those dirty ole sweaters and grey pants, and I want to throw 'em
out--honest, Bell, I guess maybe I'm kind of crazy, but I can see
you there standing in the dormitory hall, in a white dress, like
a white flower the wind has blown there, and . . . But gosh, I
wonder if I'm very intelligent? I don't know if I really care so
much for reading, except the comic strips.'</p>

<p>'Dear, my dear, your heart is intelligent . . . I think it is!
God help me if it isn't! Oh, it is!'</p>

<p>'Say, I'll settle down and read like the dickens--Tolstoi and
biology and all those things.'</p>

<p>'We'll read together. I don't really know anything except what
I parrot from Father.'</p>

<p>'You'll have to stand for keeping after me and making me
work--be hard on you, but now we can't help it--this love
business got so hold of me--feel like I was swimming in some
rapids. We'll be married before this week is up!'</p>

<p>'But don't they expel students that marry, at Truxon?'</p>

<p>'Um-huh.'</p>

<p>'But don't you think you have to finish college?'</p>

<p>'We can't go on pretending to be a couple of monks.'</p>

<p>'No. Perhaps not.'</p>

<p>'I'll get a job right away. Dad bellyaches about it, but I can
depend on him to find . . .'</p>

<p>'No! Howard! We mustn't depend on anybody! And besides! I have
a hunch that Father Cornplow, the darling, is getting pretty fed
up on having a bunch of grown-up huskies like you and Sara, and
maybe me, hanging on to him as if we were babies with the
measles. Be nice if he would give you a job, but . . . He's not
like Putnam. That One enjoys having me stick around, so he can
nag me and try out all the nifties he heard in Munich and
Florence. Father Fred doesn't owe us a thing, not any longer, and
he's beginning to suspect it . . .'</p>

<p>'He's <i>got</i> to help us! The world and the government and
your own folks owe everybody a living.'</p>

<p>'You know: my father--sometimes he's pretty bright, or else he
knows what books to steal from--he was saying that there isn't
any government; there's nothing but a lot of people that are the
government only they don't know it.'</p>

<p>'Maybe, but a fellow's own parents . . . I never asked to be
born.'</p>

<p>'I doubt if anybody invited you to, either! No. If Father Fred
gets sick of nursing us, I won't blame him. He's not asking us to
marry--if we do get married . . .'</p>

<p>'We do!'</p>

<p>'Looks so, from this side. But I want us to economize. I'm
crazy to. Honestly, honey, I'd get more kick out of having the
nerve to do without things than I ever would getting them. Live
in one room, if necessary. And I really am a pretty good
cook--Putnam, the old gourmet, has seen to that. Let's live on
eighteen dollars a week, if we have to . . .'</p>

<p>'Sure. That's O.K. by me. But before we start, there's a few
things we'll have to have, and I'm busted just this minute, so
Brother Cornplow will have to come through. We'll need a new
radio--I haven't anything but my little portable--and the one in
the car, of course--but that's a cinch; I'd be perfectly
satisfied with a radio that didn't cost over fifty bucks.'</p>

<p>'Howard!' She was not trembling now, but rigid.</p>

<p>'Think that'd be too much? Well, all right. We could wait to
get that--maybe months. But I've simply got to have a new
Tuxedo.'</p>

<p>'My child, my child! Good-bye, Mr. Yeats! Goodbye, dove-grey
edge of the sea and stormy sunset on doomed ships!' Annabel put
on again her mask of country-club vulgarity. 'What a job <i>I</i>
went and picked out for myself!' She kissed him on the lips.
'Call me ten to-morrow morning, when That One is off to his den,'
and she fled into the gloomy house, while he wailed, 'But
wait--wait--just minute . . . Aw, Bell, please . . . I'll be
doggoned!'</p>

<p> </p>

<h1>CHAPTER XVIII</h1>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>Three p.m. A June day. Office of the Triumph Motor Agency,
also the Duplex Trailer, the Nation's Movable Home. Mr. Putnam
Staybridge calling on Mr. Frederick William Cornplow.</p>

<p>'How d'you do, Mr. Staybridge! What can I do for you to-day?
Can I have one of the salesmen show you the mid-year model
Triumphs?'</p>

<p>'Thanks, no. Do you mind if I sit down?'</p>

<p>'Why, no.'</p>

<p>'Cornplow, I have ventured on a course, somewhat rare in these
complex days--I'm quite old-fashioned, you see--of coming to you
and speaking directly. Are you aware that your son and my
daughter, mere children both of them, and perhaps neither of them
very wise, apparently think they are in love?'</p>

<p>Fred was as angry at the smooth and supercilious tone as he
had ever been in his life. Sitting behind his desk, he pressed
his fingertips together till his knuckles felt as though they
were breaking, but never in his life had he sounded more
civil:</p>

<p>'I've noticed something of the kind, Mr.--uh--yes, I have
noticed it, Staybridge.'</p>

<p>'You realize that it would be entirely unsuitable for Miss
Annabel to marry your son.'</p>

<p>'Possibly.'</p>

<p>Mr. Staybridge waited for wrath, but had to carry on the play
without it:</p>

<p>'I suppose your son has no money?'</p>

<p>'Not unless he's been holding out on me!'</p>

<p>'Nor prospects?'</p>

<p>'He tells me he may play in the college team, next
autumn.'</p>

<p>'I'm being serious, Cornplow.'</p>

<p>Fred grunted.</p>

<p>'And I think that in other respects they aren't exactly
mated,' said Putnam.</p>

<p>'Such as?'</p>

<p>'Oh, need we go into details, my dear fellow?'</p>

<p>Fred tramped the floor for almost a quarter of a minute before
he was able to answer with suavity:</p>

<p>'Want me to tell you what you're trying to say, Staybridge?
No. I don't suppose you do. But I'll be doggoned if I'm not going
to. The idea is that you come from an aristocratic family, and me
and the boy from a bunch of plain farmers and blacksmiths. That's
the bunk. If it were true, which it doesn't happen to be . .
.'</p>

<p>'Aren't you rather assuming . . .'</p>

<p>'. . . as I say, it doesn't happen to <i>be</i> true, because
there's about six hard-up school teachers or government clerks
among the Staybridge gang to one rich one . . .'</p>

<p>'If you <i>please!'</i></p>

<p>'<i>. . .</i> but what of it? We're dealing with to-day.
You're the kind of snob, Putnam, that thinks a manufacturer is
socially 'way ahead of a wholesaler, and a wholesaler has got it
all over a retailer, God knows why, and . . . And it happens that
you aren't even a strictly kosher manufacturer--you own in pretty
heavily, as a sleeping partner, on the Conqueror Company, which
is engaged in peddling cars, same as I am. Oh, Putnam, how could
you, my boy!'</p>

<p>Fred had seated himself again, very red; the pearl-pale Putnam
had risen, even redder, and was shrieking, 'There happens also to
be a question of breeding and manners!'</p>

<p>Quite gallantly Putnam took the risk of turning his back to
Fred the Terrier and walking out.</p>

<p>Fred was brooding, 'And now, by golly, I'll be doggoned if I
won't go and make those doggoned young idiots go and get married
even if they doggoned don't want to! . . . Huh? No, I'm busy.
Have Paul Popple talk to him.'</p>

<p>Later: 'But the little rat was right about one thing. Annabel
certainly has got better manners than my brat, and I suspect she
can read and write.'</p>

<p>Much later: 'What can a parent, that isn't more'n average
bright himself, do for his children? Maybe leave them alone? If I
only knew! . . . Maybe the poor, conceited little flute player
loves his daughter, in his fool fashion. Wants to keep her . . .
He's lost her. Do we always lose the people we love; only keep
the people that we don't plague with loving? I guess those are
the real wars--men against women--parents against children--and
not all this monkey business in Europe. I'd like an armistice!
I'd like to go off someplace to a valley where there's
peace.'</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<center>
<h1>CHAPTER XIX</h1>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>The first fireflies of the summer beckoned in the garden
beside the Staybridge Mansion. There was a smell of rain-wet
rhododendrons, and beside the white gate a girl in a white cloak
was waiting.</p>

<p>With muted engine, the car crept through the little street of
maples and apple trees, stopped with the engine throbbing, and
the horn, thrice sounded, was only a whimpering murmur. Annabel
rustled through the gate. The right-hand front door was held open
for her, and she crept into the car in silence; in silence they
slipped away.</p>

<p>Annabel could see that Howard was driving. In the back seat
were Sara, Eugene Silga and her brother, Guy.</p>

<p>'Got the licence in my pocket,' muttered Howard.</p>

<p>She patted his arm nervously.</p>

<p>'You're of age, anyway, aren't you, Bell?' said Sara, leaning
forward, hands on the back of the front seat.</p>

<p>'Just.'</p>

<p>'Then your father couldn't do anything.'</p>

<p>Annabel sighed. 'You never know what that man might do . . .
Howard, did you see your father?'</p>

<p>'Yes. But I didn't say anything about the marriage. Neither
did he. He just looked sort of funny.'</p>

<p>'"Marriage!" It sounds so solemn and scary,' said Sara.</p>

<p>'To me it sounds like whiskers and horsehair sofas and
whalebone corsets,' sniffed Gene.</p>

<p>Annabel seemed to be talking in sleep: 'Yes. I don't believe
we're going to do it. We're putting on an amateur play, and
afterwards, pretty soon now, Putnam S. will come back to my
dressing-room and say, "Ann, if you had more discipline, if you
didn't let the emotion govern you, you wouldn't be a bad
actress". Maybe he's right.'</p>

<p>'Him? Never!' from Howard.</p>

<p>'Wasn't he right when he thought me up?'</p>

<p>'Yes, he did have a pretty good idea that time!'</p>

<p>They were coming into the business section, garish with lights
from movie theatres. Howard drove scarily, as swiftly as he
could, bounding ahead as the lights turned from red to green,
till his shaken passengers nodded like Asian gods. Their escape
from the stillness beside Putnam Staybridge's garden enlivened
them, and they became hysterical:</p>

<p>'Don't forget to stop at the cathedral and pick up the bish
and the canon . . .'</p>

<p>'And the trench mortar . . .'</p>

<p>'I've arranged for a hillbilly choir and six Jugoslav maestri
playing twelve pianos . . .'</p>

<p>'But how can they . . .'</p>

<p>'With their feet, of course, idiot . . .'</p>

<p>'We can't get the bishop. He's playing poker down at Honest
Tom's, and I heard he picked up his skirts and chased the cop on
the beat seven blocks with a bung starter . . .'</p>

<p>'Annabel can have a choice of a rabbi, a Mormon missionary,
and a Kentucky cardinal . . .'</p>

<p>'That's a bird, my good fool.'</p>

<p>'So is he!'</p>

<p>'Well, all you true-blue Aryan Tories and goyim can have your
marriages, but I'd rather learn bezique . . .'</p>

<p>'Howard, for heaven's sake, you're doing fifty-five!'</p>

<p>'Fifty-seven,' said Howard.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>Guy Staybridge had been looking through the back window.
'Howard! Ann! I think there's somebody following us. He's been
making every turn we make and there's darn little traffic on this
Patchin route, so I can pick him out.'</p>

<p>'The road is free, white and twenty-one,' said Howard,
contentedly--accelerating.</p>

<p>'The horn sounds to me like my father's Conqueror--I know that
horn,' said Guy.</p>

<p>'All right. We'll ditch him. Not that I'm scared of him or
nobody,' growled Howard and, after thinking it over thoroughly,
'never!'</p>

<p>But he sped up, turned off on a side street so sharply that
they were almost thrown from their seats, missed a station
waggon, circled a block and came back on the main road.</p>

<p>'Have we lost him?' Howard demanded.</p>

<p>Guy speculated, 'I think so, but it's hard to figure
out--these headlights.'</p>

<p>'Do you mind slowing up?' begged Annabel. 'I'd hate to have
"Arrived at her wedding minus seven ribs" on my tombstone.'</p>

<p>'Personally, I'm scared to death,' said Gene.</p>

<p>Guy, still taking sight through the rear window and feeling
important in the role of detective on guard, said with fake calm,
'I don't think that was his horn just now. These Conquerors got a
whale of a lot of power--more'n your Triumph, I believe.'</p>

<p>Annabel hooted hysterically.</p>

<p>'What's the matter with you?' Howard was stolid and
disapproving.</p>

<p>'Oh, darling! Don't you <i>see?</i> A curse on both your
supply houses! Howardeo Montague Triumph and Annabel Capulet
Conqueror!'</p>

<p>'I don't get that. Explain it to me afterwards, when I'm not
so busy,' said Howard.</p>

<p>Annabel, with a small sound like a moan, looked closely at him
and, no longer speaking, leaned forward, chin in hand.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>The parsonage in Patchin, which was half suburb to Sachem and
half country village, was a white box, more porch than house.</p>

<p>Sara had imagined aloud: 'The preacher will be a sweet old
soul with spectacles, and his wife will be a dumpling, and
they'll both be colossal bores. They'll kiss everybody that
doesn't skip fast, and tell you two idiots to try to stand for
each other, which is plainly unreasonable.'</p>

<p>But the minister and his wife, who came worrying out on to the
porch as soon as the car hooted, were a timid, awkward pair,
nearly as young as Howard and Annabel, though they possessed a
pair of twins, whom they introduced as Abner and Bernice and sent
protesting up to bed. They seemed more frightened about the
marriage than did the brazen principals, and the pastor's lady
begged them all to have 'just a bite to eat--just a little
something--maybe some nice fresh doughnuts.'</p>

<p>She did kiss Annabel, and tenderly, but after looking Sara,
Guy and Eugene over with anxiety, dismissed them as one of those
accidents that just will happen.</p>

<p>The scanty living-room could not have been changed much since
1890. It still displayed a parlour organ and a brocade
table-cover with ball fringes. On hanging shelves were the little
pastor's books, each volume painstakingly covered with
oilcloth.</p>

<p>'This isn't a wedding! Didn't I say it was just a play!'
Annabel whispered to Howard, as they lined up.</p>

<p>'Bell, you must stop and realize that this is a very solemn
moment in the lives of both of us,' he began, and she cut it
short with 'You're telling <i>me?'</i> as the little pastor
quavered, 'If you please now!'</p>

<p>Hearing an entirely illegitimate sound above them, Annabel
looked up and discovered that the pastor's twins were peering
down at the enchanted mystery through the hot-air register in the
ceiling, vigorously pushing each other and commenting, 'She's
kind of a nice-looking lady. I bet she paid anyways five dollars
for that hat. What do they want to get married for? Hey, quit
shoving me!'</p>

<p>She wanted to laugh, but she grew sober as she understood that
the pastor was cutting her off from all the white, shy, maiden
life she had known, with the timid solemnity of his question, 'Do
you take this man to be your lawful husband?'</p>

<p>After the ceremony, the little pastor said only, 'Dearly
beloved, I am not wise, and I don't know much about the rich city
you come from, and all I can do is hope and pray you two will be
as happy as my wife and I have been in our little house, and help
each other the way she helps me every day.'</p>

<p>Annabel wanted to cry, then. She looked at Howard. His mouth
was open, his eyes beseeching, and on his nose a tear was absurd
and beautiful. But the time when she suddenly did cry, whooping
like an indignant baby, was when she looked around to find,
standing by the door, unexpected, unexplained, Fred and Hazel
Cornplow, holding out to her their plain plump hands.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<h1>CHAPTER XX</h1>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>The initial salary received by Howard Cornplow, a new
apprentice at the Triumph Motor Agency, was twenty-five dollars a
week, which was eighteen a week as a worker and seven a week as a
son. He started in as a salesman, and he liked it. He pictured
himself in a silver-and-scarlet automobile, spurting all over the
district, crowing over his former fellow prisoners at Truxon
College next autumn, and with lush commissions investing in the
stock market and becoming a millionaire. He bought a suit of
imported Harris tweed and, for no reason that he could ever
explain, a pair of binoculars, which he kept in his demonstrator.
Meanwhile, on one day at least, he borrowed lunch money from his
shaggy second cousin, Cal Tillery.</p>

<p>But he did not sell any cars, not any cars at all, and Fred
noticed this more than he did the Harris tweeds. After a week,
Fred summoned him to the office, at close of the day's work.</p>

<p>Swinging his foot good-naturedly, Howard chuckled 'Can't take
very long, Dad. Bell and I are going out and shoot some
golf.'</p>

<p>'Son, I don't want you to think I'm grouchy. But it's time now
. . .'</p>

<p>'Oh, golly, Dad, Bell is always saying "it's time now" to do
some confounded thing or other!'</p>

<p>'Dry up till I finish! I said it's time for you to settle down
to work. No employer is going to pay you for looking
handsome--not even Hollywood, because you do have to be on time
there, I understand, and in the nine days you've worked here now,
you've been on an average of twenty-one minutes late in the
morning, and you've taken an average of an hour and twenty-two
minutes for lunch.'</p>

<p>'You've checked up on me--spied on me--like that?'</p>

<p>'I have. Any other employer would just have fired you. But
your unpunctuality isn't as bad as the fact that you don't know a
single thing about automobiles.'</p>

<p>'Now look here, Dad! Fair's fair! I've been driving cars since
I was fifteen . . .'</p>

<p>'And you still don't know what all those funny tubes under the
hood are for! Before you can sell, you've got to be able to take
down a motor. I'm going to put you in the repair shop. I'm going
to have Bill Merman teach you how to use a lathe and a hammer and
a cold chisel . . .'</p>

<p>'Me work for that greasy, tobacco-spitting roughneck?'</p>

<p>'Maybe chewing tobacco is what makes a good machinist. Maybe
you better learn . . . Wait! Excuse me. I didn't mean to get
flip. I called you in here so we could get right down to brass
tacks and cut out this fencing and covering up that we've always
done, all our lives, doggone it! You're no longer a nice kid that
I'm responsible for. You're a grown, married
man--theoretically--and you're responsible for yourself and for
Annabel. So you'll either put on overalls, and really go to work,
and maybe some day I may put you to selling again, or else you'll
get out and find work somewhere else.'</p>

<p>'And if I can't? With the raw deal Youth is getting . . .'</p>

<p>'Then you'll probably starve.'</p>

<p>Howard struck attitudes by the dozen, heroic ones: 'Oh, I can
take it! I can live on handouts! I can sleep in the hay! But what
about Annabel? Her father won't speak to her.'</p>

<p>'Your mother and I would be very pleased to have Annabel stay
with us while you're sleeping in the hay, but if you come to our
house to call on her, please brush off the hayseed . . . Howard!
Damn it! Have I got to wake up and find I have a fool for a son?
You can get to work or get out, and I've got so now's I don't
care which . . . Oh, son, son, don't make me angry! I want to
help you. Can't you see that?'</p>

<p>'Oh, all right, Dad. I'll try. I'll spit tobacco juice, if you
say so, and pinch every penny . . . Want to drive out with me and
meet Bell? I'll buy you a dry martini.'</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>While Howard and Annabel had been on their honeymoon of a week
(which Fred had felt was all he ought, for their own sakes, to
give them), he had found for them a three-room flat with
appreciable light and air. Three months' rent he paid, and Hazel
and he, somewhat timidly, provided electric stove and
refrigerator, beds and a few chairs, and painted dining
furniture. They called in Sara to approve and were flattered when
she found these intrusions tolerable.</p>

<p>When Annabel returned, Fred called her to his office and
ventured:</p>

<p>'It'll be a long time before Howard is able to do much more. I
want to lend you, uh, lend you personally, Annabel, a thousand
dollars, so you can finish the furnishing. I want you to give me
your personal note for it--thousand bucks to be paid back in, uh,
say ten years, at, uh, shall we say two per cent interest? Oh,
it'll be a good investment for me, the way things are!'</p>

<p>'Dad, I don't want to take it. You've already given us enough
furniture to scrape along on. I'd rather save, and buy things bit
by bit. Howard is sweet, but . . .'</p>

<p>'Doggone it, Annabel, will you stop being so doggone noble?
I'm being noble and you're being noble and no wonder Howard goes
haywire with everybody forgiving him the whole doggone time,
doggone it! Here, you take this thousand bucks and sign this note
and get out of here and go buy that furniture, do you hear?'</p>

<p>'O.K., Chief!'</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>From the sketchiness of the lounge chairs, the couch, the
occasional tables, the dressing-table and bureau that she bought,
Fred suspected that Annabel had thriftily kept half of the
thousand. He came in for coffee or lunch once or twice a week; he
found that, as she often asserted, Putnam Staybridge had taught
her perfection in making soups and desserts, canap&eacute;s and
salads. But she had never learned to cook roast beef or bread
pudding or porridge, she was not precise in bed-making, and she
belonged to the school of sweepers who leave rolls of dust under
the bureau. She did perceive the sloppiness of her housekeeping,
and day after day he saw her trying to remember where she had put
the ice pick, trying to clean the ash trays and the glasses which
their friends had left on every chair and table at last night's
party.</p>

<p>He sighed, 'Dunno how come, but I feel more at home eating
sinkers and lukewarm coffee off a soap-box with Annabel than I
would having a bottle of champagne with Sara.'</p>

<p>(There were, to him, only five types of wine: champagne wine,
sherry wine, red wine, California wine and cowslip wine, of
which, as he understood it, only the first was to be drunk for
pleasure and not to flatter one's host.)</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>The third issue of <i>Protest &amp; Progress</i> contained two
articles which irritated Fred beyond tolerance. He read them on
an evening when Sara was away and, despite the sweet vision of
sleep, he stayed up, girt for battle.</p>

<p>The first article stated that rarely had there been so
persuasive a proof that all Americans were fools as had been seen
during the recent visit of General Kynok, of the Soviet Air
Corps. Aside from being entertained by the American airmen,
invited to lunch by the President, urged to lecture in several
cities, and shown all our landing fields and aeroplane factories,
he had been ignored.</p>

<p>This curtain lecture was accompanied by a few sound
generalizations: (1) It is glorious for a Russian to be a soldier
and ready to defend his country. (2) Any American who is ready to
defend his country and has become a soldier is either a
bloodthirsty fiend or has been misled by the paid hypnotizers of
Capitalism. (3) The Russian air fleet is stronger than those of
any other three countries combined. (4) America, if she had any
sort of nice feeling, would be devoting herself to helping
defenceless and aeroplaneless Russia. (5) General Kynok was at
once a Wellingtonian commander and a true-blue, tail-wagging
Proletarian comrade.</p>

<p>That essay was merely an appetizer for the article in which
Gene Silga urged that the Pragg Glassworks, the largest industry
in Sachem Falls, be organized forthwith as a closed shop, and
since it had been successful in resisting organization, that this
be done by violence. He advised the workers to buy rifles, to
form classes in marksmanship, to study Georges Sorel.</p>

<p>Fred was raving, when Sara appeared, after midnight.</p>

<p>'Wait a minute,' she said crisply. 'You're just an amateur
scold. Look what the professionals have done.'</p>

<p>She gave him an early edition of the Sachem Falls
<i>Recorder,</i> the morning paper, open at the third page. The
right-hand column was filled with a story headed: 'Mayor and
Council Denounce Local Red', which announced that one Eugene
Silga was a notorious Bolshevik, that his paper was inciting to
riot, and that the Board of Aldermen, with the mayor in
attendance, would take up, to-morrow, means of ridding the city
of Silga and his followers.</p>

<p>'You better get out of town!' agonized Fred.</p>

<p>'No. I can't run away.'</p>

<p>'Yes. That's so. You oughtn't to. But I certainly think you
ought to stay away from Gene and your office a few days.'</p>

<p>'I suppose you're ashamed of me! Perhaps it's Mother and you
that will want to run away!'</p>

<p>Mildly, rather surprised: 'No--no. I don't have to tell you I
don't like what "P. &amp; P." is doing--trying to make the whole
country a WPA with unemployability the only test of
employability. But of course I want to help you any way I can . .
.'</p>

<p>'There is one thing you can do: help straighten up the office
accounts. With this beastly attack, I expect all our beastly
creditors will be surging into the office to-morrow, clamouring
to be paid.'</p>

<p>'They might be. Some business men do like to be paid! I'll
step around in the morning.'</p>

<p>'If you'd care to,' she said indifferently, as she started up
stairs.</p>

<p>Fred's splendid rage had gone damp. Once more he had
discovered that even when you have a sinner exactly where you
want him, he still may have something to say; that it is,
perhaps, a mistake to rehearse a play without inquiring whether
your opposite is going to have some lines also.</p>

<p>He did not long brood on his failure. He knew that his
daughter, beneath her icing, must be disheartened. He paddled to
the upper hall and, after she should have been asleep, heard her
softly thumping about her room. He longed to go in and have what
he called a 'real talk with her'. Suddenly, feeling lonely, he
saw that not for years had Sara and he talked with easy
simplicity. This Coheeze disaster might be a bridge between
them.</p>

<p>Did children, afraid to ask their parents for favours, know
how often those parents were afraid of seeming ridiculous or
bossy, and how they hovered, hesitating, outside bedroom
doors?</p>

<p>He knocked.</p>

<p>There was no hearty 'Come in'. Sara evidently burrowed around
for a dressing-gown before she opened the door, with an annoyed
'Yes?'</p>

<p>'Nothing, nothing, daughter. Just--well, I wanted you to know
I'd help, any way I can.'</p>

<p>'Oh, thanks,' she said bleakly.</p>

<p>Fred had never been in the Coheeze office, and when he climbed
to it, at ten the next morning, he felt uncomfortably that he had
returned to his early days of canvassing. The unpainted, boxed-in
stairs were littered with papers and muddy heelprints, they
smelled of yellow soap, and they displayed the signs of an
electric healer and of a philanthropist who sold loaded dice 'for
scientific purposes only'.</p>

<p>In his one glance about the Coheeze office, Fred rather liked
it, reminded of the crazy tents, littered with fishing tackle and
old shoes, in which he had camped as a boy. Gene and Sara were
sitting on their tables, muttering anxiously.</p>

<p>'Well, Gene, this is kind of hard luck.'</p>

<p>'Eh? Oh, how d'you do, Mr. Cornplow. Hard luck is right. I get
all the blame, but how could I guess?'</p>

<p>'You might've known . . .'</p>

<p>'I was following instructions absolutely. Now, I suppose, I
won't get a cent more money.'</p>

<p>'You could hardly expect the Channing Praggs to come through
when you've jumped on the source of all their cash . . .'</p>

<p>'Praggs? <i>Praggs?</i> Oh! Them! We aren't talking about the
same thing, Mr. Cornplow.'</p>

<p>Sara said witheringly, 'Of course not!' while the young Fred
felt like a calf in the scornful company of these, his elders.
Gene condescended:</p>

<p>'I don't mind the Press roasting me, either. That's my job,
stirring them up. My trouble is with the C.P.'</p>

<p>'Oh yes. The C.P.?'</p>

<p>'Good heavens, Father!' from Sara. 'The Communist Party, of
course.'</p>

<p>'Oh, I see.'</p>

<p>Gene sighed, 'I've just had a long wire from them this morning
. . . I'm a good radical, but I never did understand why it is
that the harder up a left-wing organization is, the more it sends
out hundred-word night letters that could just as well go under a
three-cent stamp . . . Happen to notice that in the last "P.
&amp; P." I gave quite a boost to the Russian general,
Kynok?'</p>

<p>'Um-uhh.'</p>

<p>'The real model for all American soldiers that might want to
go revolutionary?'</p>

<p>'Um-huh.'</p>

<p>'Well the Party wires me that Comrade Kynok was secretly
arrested in Moscow day before yesterday, as a spy for Japan, and
tried last night, and of course he will be shot this morning.
Kynok! That stood with Stalin's arm about his shoulders while
175,000 children marched past them, saluting, a month ago! How
could I know? Now, I suppose I'm a Jap spy and a Trotskyite,
too!'</p>

<p>'But big leader like that, Gene, prob'ly they'll find him
innocent.'</p>

<p>Gene turned on his smile, friendly, a little cynical.</p>

<p>'Nope. They don't waste time in Moscow. They don't spend the
State's money inquiring whether somebody's innocent unless they
can prove he's guilty. It's a new system of justice! Good Lord, I
sound like a counter-revolutionary! Sorry. Well, I've got to get
to work writing a piece telling how I finally got on to Kynok,
the dirty, treacherous rat! The enemies of the Proletarian State
must be rooted out ruthlessly! Rat--root--rut'less, that's my
tune--my rune--oh hell!'</p>

<p>Gene's typewriter began firing, shooting out flames, the
platen turning red hot, the gunner's face grim.</p>

<p>Sara suggested almost civilly, 'You wanted to look over our
accounts, Father?'</p>

<p>He indicated that such had been his presumptuous longing.</p>

<p>She led him to a third kitchen table, which the Coheeze office
had extravagantly added to its equipment; she pointed to a mess
of letters, bills and ten-cent notebooks, and said casually:
'There's our books.'</p>

<p>After half an hour of rustling through papers like a
discouraged sparrow scratching up gravel, Fred decided that he
was not going to be able to 'straighten up their accounts'. For
there were no accounts. Except for transactions during their
first week, they had noted down nothing whatever. Uncashed
donation cheques were mixed with unpaid bills. On torn slips of
paper were such helpful notes as 'Recd cash from J.K., ten.' In
one envelope he found a cheque for one hundred dollars from the
Southside Marxian and Literary Club and a bill for sixty-five
from a stationery firm, and the envelope was from neither party
but from the Maplehurst Labour College.</p>

<p>Fred was opening his mouth in wrath at such sacrilege against
bookkeeping when the tramp of a dozen heavy feet came from the
rickety stairs below them.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<center>
<h1>CHAPTER XXI</h1>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>At the tramping on the stairs, the three sprang up, Gene with
quivering hand at his lips.</p>

<p>'You scared?' demanded Sara.</p>

<p>'You bet I am! Sounds like the cops. I've been beaten by cops
before!'</p>

<p>'They've got no reason to arrest us.'</p>

<p>'They don't arrest you for reason--just for fun!'</p>

<p>Fred took command--not these many years had he dared to
command Sara. 'You two get out of this! Hustle up on the roof and
hide. I know lots of the cops.' They hesitated, and his voice
became military. 'Hear me? Get out! Beat it!'</p>

<p>The two revolutionaries beat it.</p>

<p>He made much of looking as though he had proper business here.
He sat squarely at the table, pencil in hand, note-book and bills
before him, but he was trembling, and afterward he found that the
only entry he had made in the note-book was: 'Scared myself.' He
was gravely drawing ballet girls on a blotter when, like pigs
bursting out of an opened pen, into the room sprang a police
sergeant and five patrolmen, all with clubs in their fists, a
couple with hands on pistol holsters.</p>

<p>'What the!' grunted the sergeant.</p>

<p>'Well I'll be!' intelligently commented the others.</p>

<p>'Hello, Sergeant. Afraid you're too late. Your birds have
flown the coop,' Fred carolled.</p>

<p>He remained seated; he knew that to be the safest position
against a thug not too drunk.</p>

<p>'Who are you? Oh. It's Mr. Cornplow. What you doing here?
Where's this anarchist guy?'</p>

<p>'Skipped town, I'm afraid. I'm here representing the
creditors. This fellow Silga owes me for a light truck, damn
him!'</p>

<p>'What makes you think he's gone?'</p>

<p>'My daughter saw him off at the train.'</p>

<p>'Oh, that's so! She was mixed up in this.'</p>

<p>'She just worked here--she talked it over with my friend, the
mayor, before she took the job. She has no responsibility.'</p>

<p>'Well, I don't want her, anyway. Get busy, boys!'</p>

<p>It was appalling to the placid Fred, the gloating frenzy with
which the boys 'got busy'. From somewhere out in the hall axes
were brought, and they gleefully went to work. There is no
greater bliss than to be destructive as hell while being moral as
heaven. The guardians of the law smashed tables, threw a
typewriter through a closed window, with hysterical laughter.
Reporters and news photographers were somehow suddenly there,
very cheerful, and it was the glare of a flashlight bulb that
startled Fred into action. He rose; he faced the sergeant as he
would have faced a chronic dead beat.</p>

<p>'Stop this business or I'll have the whole bunch of you kicked
off the force! I represent the creditors, and you have no court
order . . .'</p>

<p>'Don't need none.'</p>

<p>'I'll sue you, personally, for every cent of damage! Look,
Sergeant--chase all these roughnecks out of here, and I'll
explain.'</p>

<p>'Outside youse,' said the sergeant, wiping his hand on the
seat of his trousers, that it might be clean to receive the dirty
money.</p>

<p>Fred's argument was brief: it consisted entirely in a
twenty-dollar bill and the reminder that, already, the sergeant
had been photographed enough to ensure publicity.</p>

<p>'I would like to get hold of that there atheist Silga, though.
Hate to have the cops in the next town find we let him go without
marking him,' mourned the faithful sergeant, as he departed,
after giving his inspiring lesson in How to Make Communists.</p>

<p>Fred sat down, unsteadily. As Gene and Sara crept back into
the room, he, who had hated all Reds, was positively loving in
his address:</p>

<p>'Son, better get going quick--get out of town. They want to
beat you. I finagled the cops out, but they might come back.'</p>

<p>Sara said sniffily, 'I suppose you bribed them! I suppose you
were humble to them!'</p>

<p>'I certainly was--I bribed and humbled and I lied, you little
prig, you Soviet Salvation Army lassie, you . . . Grrrr! Gene,
got any compromising papers here? Get 'em out quick.'</p>

<p>'Only the C.P. telegram this morning. I burn 'em.'</p>

<p>That telegram Gene was taking from a telephone book and
tucking into his pocket.</p>

<p>'Want to hide out at my house, Gene? Seeing Sara was in this
with . . .'</p>

<p>'I do not! I'm leaving town.'</p>

<p>'You probably aren't very flush. Can you use this ten
bucks?'</p>

<p>Gene took the bill disdainfully--oh, he took it, just the
same!--and without thanks headed for the door.</p>

<p>'Gene!' wailed Sara.</p>

<p>'Well?'</p>

<p>'Can't we help you with your baggage?'</p>

<p>'Baggage? You're very funny, Comrade Cornplow!' Gene snarled.
'My baggage consists of two suitcasefuls--one of them
books--which is what I have to show for my twenty-seven
years--six of 'em spent in either being beaten by cops, or
enduring middle-class females playing at being free souls, like
you!'</p>

<p>'Gene!' It slashed Fred's heart to see with what agonized
fondness his daughter was looking at the young man.</p>

<p>'But you remind me, Sara,' remarked Gene, and for a second his
reckless smile came back. He dialled on the telephone, and
murmured, 'Miss Kitz, please . . . Oh, Frieda, this is Gene . . .
Yes, they've been here--wrecked everything. I'm hitch-hiking out
of town and glad of it. I'll meet you in the old place in Albany,
'bout eight to-night. O.K.? . . . Fine. <i>Auf
Wiedersehen!'</i></p>

<p>He turned debonairly on the Cornplows with, 'You see, you
needn't worry about my future now, Mr. Cornplow! You wouldn't be
a bad sort, if you just had the sense to realize that your
good-natured democratic sort of middle-roadishness is plumb
finished--or will finish, in front of a stone wall.'</p>

<p>'I suppose you want me to play safe and join the Communist
Party!'</p>

<p>Fred believed that he had been chillingly sarcastic, but Gene
answered serenely, 'No I'm afraid we wouldn't want you!' and Gene
was gone.</p>

<p>Fred turned pitifully to Sara, who was standing mute, hands at
her breast. 'Honey, it's what you get if you mix up with folks
that are crazy for power. Were you awfully fond of Gene?'</p>

<p>The tornado struck him squarely:</p>

<p>'Gene? You call that little guttersnipe "Gene"? I hate him! I
always did! He was just an experiment in psychology to me.
"Fond"? Oh, can't you even begin to understand me? . . . I'm
going to the tennis club. I've been neglecting my game. I'm going
out for it seriously now. But before I play, I'm going to have a
Tom Collins and see if I can't wash the taste of all this
vulgarity out of my mouth.' She looked indignantly down on the
parent who had wished upon her these unpleasantnesses, the
Coheeze and <i>Protest &amp; Progress</i> and the police. She
said, from the doorway, 'It's all very distasteful to me.
Bribery! Insisting that I'm such a fool as to like that little
rat, Silga. Very--distasteful--indeed!'</p>

<p>Fred was left alone with a mess of unpaid bills.</p>

<p>'I won't pay one cent of 'em,' he stormed--with
twenty-five-per-cent honesty.</p>

<p>An hour later, in front of a miraculously straightened table,
he added, 'I'd like to get out of this! I suppose I love my
grateful son and daughter, but now I know what old man Solomon
meant when he said, "Comfort me with apples for I am sick of
love!"'</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<center>
<h1>CHAPTER XXII</h1>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>As an apprentice mechanic at the Triumph Agency, Howard was
popular. For a couple of days he sulked at grease and overalls,
the time clock and an aching back, but he discovered that the
workmen were as individual as the pedigreed young gentlemen he
had known in college, and more vigorous in humour. Their stories
of jobs and girls and drunks, of the navy, the Pacific Coast,
Detroit, seemed to him better than the giggling of young
collegians, and it became important to him to be one of the
boys.</p>

<p>He learned that nobody will find it out--at least not till the
rear-end burns out, months later--if you save your energy by
squirting only a quarter enough grease into the differential. He
learned to get something very like a nap, after lunch and a
couple of Bourbons, by lying under a car and in a friendly manner
tapping the springs with a hammer now and then. And the chief
mechanic was indulgent when the Son of the Boss got a group about
him and taught them 'Three Cheers for Old TruxON'.</p>

<p>Howard perceived that he had been wrong in regarding his
second cousin, Cal Tillery, as a lout and a bore. Cal might never
achieve life's prime purpose and learn to sell motor cars to
bankers; Cal's hair might resemble a ravelled gunnysack; but in
the wholesome fastnesses of the Adirondacks, Cal had developed a
rustic slyness that to Howard seemed sharper than the book-taught
perceptions of Guy Staybridge. He played poker with the tenacity
of one who had learned it in the hay-mow; waitresses might laugh
at him, but they did walk out with him; and for all city slickers
and their rules, Cal had contempt. No scolding from his father
could embarrass Howard so much as Cousin Cal's drawling, 'You
going to go society on us, are you, Big Boy, and put on the
Tuxedo and play bridge whist with the old girls with the red
fingernails?'</p>

<p>Cal started by borrowing money from Howard; it ended with
Howard's borrowing from Cal and nervously volunteering to his
father that Cal was a jewel and they must never lose him.</p>

<p>Fred listened with no comment beyond that of his wrinkling
eyebrows.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>Fred was calling upon Ben Bogey, 'Homes that are nice at
lowest price'.</p>

<p>'Cutting out the bunk, Mr. Bogey, how much chance do you think
you'd stand of making a living if you and my son started a firm
together?'</p>

<p>'A living? Why, Mr. Cornplow, as sure as I'm sitting here,
we'd make twenty per cent on the investment . . .'</p>

<p>'Whoa-up! I asked could you two make a <i>living?</i> In my
experience, that totals a lot more than the twenty per cent that
you boys seem to figure out on some kind of arithmetic different
from what I studied. What real prospects you got?'</p>

<p>Mr. Bogey showed letters. Three firms were willing to let him
handle their apartment-house rents; another firm congratulated
him on 'developing' a cow pasture into a human pasture.</p>

<p>Fred mused, 'Well, now, you take Howard, and what's he got for
you?'</p>

<p>'Oh, everything, Mr. Cornplow! Simply everything! I cer'nly
understand why you're so proud of that boy. Good looks, nice
voice, athletic training--gracious, how the ladies that are
looking for suburban homes would fall for that fellow! And fine
education and nice dependable manners--why, everything! You don't
have to tell me!'</p>

<p>'As matter of fact, I <i>was</i> going to tell you a few
interesting facts about him. His education is phony. He can
mis-spell in three languages. He hasn't just learned the history
of the U.S.--no indeed--he's forgotten the dates and names in the
history of the whole world. But aside from all this modern
education stuff, he's unpunctual, he chatters like a monkey all
day long, when he's supposed to be reconditioning cars, he wastes
material, he boasts that he's the son of the boss, and he borrows
money. Think you could do anything with him?'</p>

<p>'Sure. He's the kind that needs freedom.'</p>

<p>'How much would I have to put up for him, if he went in
partnership with you?'</p>

<p>'I figured it would be five thousand dollars.'</p>

<p>'Can't do it possibly. I'll tell you. I'll put up two thousand
now. Three months from now, if you two are making a real,
honest-to-God beginning, I may put in another two.'</p>

<p>'It's a go!'</p>

<p>So was Howard kicked upstairs; so was the Triumph Agency saved
from becoming a glee club; and in the innocent belief that his
own overwhelming charm had done it all, Howard began his career
as a builder of cities, a king of contracts, a viceroy of choice
rentals.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>Annabel was hanging the curtains in the bright new three-room
office of the bright new firm of Bogey &amp; Cornplow, Realtors.
Ben had chosen the city's northern outskirts, a pouncing place
for the best suburbs, and for their office chosen the ground
floor of a cheerful-looking building filled with doctors and
dentists. Already he was out hustling for prospects, while Howard
conducted the office, a task which, so far, had consisted in
watching Annabel fill flower vases and the girl stenographer type
'The quick brown fox jumped with zest over the gay lady'. He
lighted a thin cigar with an air he had never shown in lighter
college days, and to Annabel he pontificated:</p>

<p>'This is something like it! Course at the Triumph the trouble
was, I was kept back by being the owner's son. Everybody took
advantage of it and tried to borrow money . . .'</p>

<p>'Howard! Please! Howard!'</p>

<p>He threw down the cigar; he became serious.</p>

<p>'I know what you're going to say, dear, every word; and most
of its true. I was loafing. And I did kinda borrow a little. But
what was there ahead, stuck in that dirty shop? Now I'm free!
I've got the world by the tail! I'm going to work twenty hours a
day, every day, by golly--uh--just soon as there's any customers
to work on!'</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>The Cornplow family had always taken its vacations together,
in August or September, at some lakeside hotel. This year, with
Howard's marriage, with Sara's revolution, with Coheeze creditors
still to be pacified, with the Duplex booming, their vacation
plans had been unmade.</p>

<p>Fred sat with Hazel on the screened porch at the side of their
house on a late July evening, very hot, conducive to bad tempers
and rebellion. It seemed to him that he had been fighting a
battle in the fog, with shadows that proved to be armed enemies,
and enemies that were mist; and that he could depend only on the
fixed cool light that was Hazel.</p>

<p>'Say, uh, Hazel, don't you think we better start thinking
about what we're going to do for vacation? Looks like with the
boy married, and Sara so doggone busy at the tennis club
explaining she never was a communist, just you and I'll go off
together. First time in all these years, and will I enjoy it!
Let's drive up to the Gasp&eacute;. Or how about putting the car
on a lake steamer and going out to Duluth? We'll have some
adventures, too--no Sara along to highhat the populace! Just us
two old bums!'</p>

<p>'It would be nice, Fred, but . . . The children have been
talking with me. I know Howard expects to take Annabel and come
with us.'</p>

<p>'Now? Just started in business? Just married?'</p>

<p>'He says it would be cheaper . . .'</p>

<p>'I see. He don't so much want a trip with us as on us!'</p>

<p>'And Sara has an idea. She expects to play in a tennis
tournament in the South, in October--down at Wormtail Hot Springs
. . .'</p>

<p>'That doggone dump? Where the politicians boil out enough
alcohol so they can enjoy a fresh filling? If she goes there, she
goes by herself, lemme tell you!'</p>

<p>'She feels that after the mistake she made about this fellow
Silga's character, she's got to be extra respectable, and she has
an idea that if we took a cottage at Wormtail together . . .'</p>

<p>'Of all the . . .'</p>

<p>'I know, Fred, I know, but I also know how Sara is, and if she
makes up her mind and starts nagging, we'll give in to her to
save trouble. The only way you could handle it would be to run
away from her.'</p>

<p>'Well, and what's the matter with running away? Hm! Think I'll
take a little walk.'</p>

<p>Hazel stared after him. Fred was excited, and she was afraid
of spontaneous combustion.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<center>
<h1>CHAPTER XXIII</h1>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>At ten next morning, a dusty and discouraged morning of July,
Fred telephoned from the office:</p>

<p>'Oh, Hazel? Sara there?'</p>

<p>'No, she's at the club. Anything I can do?'</p>

<p>'Just something I wanted to ask about.'</p>

<p>'I'll be going down town shopping, in about an hour,
Fred.'</p>

<p>'Say, wait for me at the house, will you? Got anything
important on for to-day?'</p>

<p>'No, just coffee at Louise Kamerkink's this afternoon.'</p>

<p>'Fine. Wait for me.'</p>

<p>He looked embarrassed, she was puzzled and a little anxious,
when he came into the house at this unexampled hour of the
day.</p>

<p>'Lookit, Hazel. Grand day, and I'm kind of tired. What say we
jump in the car and skip off for two-three days?'</p>

<p>'To-day?'</p>

<p>'Why not?'</p>

<p>'Heavens, you have to make preparations!'</p>

<p>'Don't need any. Gas and oil and a toothbrush and a comb and a
nightshirt--what more do you need? If you have to get a lipstick
along the way, prob'ly there are some stores outside Sachem
Falls! I brought some cash from the office.'</p>

<p>'If you'd just told me a few days ago. I've made some dates .
. .'</p>

<p>'Anything you can't bust?'</p>

<p>'I don't think that would be awfully nice of me.'</p>

<p>'What 'd you do if you stepped off the kerb and got killed by
an auto? Wouldn't be able to keep your dates then, would
you?'</p>

<p>'Why, what a perfectly awful suggestion!'</p>

<p>'Well, it does happen sometimes, don't it? Hop to it and call
'em off.'</p>

<p>'You're just as arbitrary as Sara.'</p>

<p>'Sure. I inherited it from her. Can do?'</p>

<p>'Oh, I suppose . . .'</p>

<p>'Get at it, then, and pack a bag--just toilet things and some
underwear.'</p>

<p>'But where--what . . .'</p>

<p>'Thought maybe we'd run over to Saratoga Springs and see the
new buildings there. But the point isn't where we're going; it's
the fun of us two running off together.'</p>

<p>'I think I might like it.'</p>

<p>She was already dialling Mrs. Kamerkink.</p>

<p>Fred hurried upstairs and packed one bag--the chief necessity
in it, the latest P. G. Wodehouse novel. He telephoned to his
secretary, at the office, that it was such a hot day--going take
little run to Saratoga--would she call up Mr. Howard and Miss
Sara and--tell 'em be back endaweekmiddlanext.</p>

<p>When Howard telephoned, as Howard was certain to, Fred was
densely misunderstanding about the overwhelming need of Bogey
&amp; Cornplow for his advice on importunate problems. He merely
chuckled a little, inanely babbled, 'Yuh, thought I'd check out
for couple days--Saratoga', hung up on Howard--though, to any
salesman, hanging up is a crime ranking with malfeasance and
conversion--and did not answer the telephone when it rang again.
That would be Sara. He knew that Sara would hurry right back to
the house, but he also knew that Sara could never hurry right
back anywhere without stopping to nag somebody about something,
and indeed she did not arrive until five minutes after Fred had
set the nickled snout of his Triumph Special Convertible
Coup&eacute; eastward on Fenimore Cooper Boulevard, with Hazel
warm and bewildered beside him.</p>

<p>Though he felt that in his flight into Egypt there were
several important principles illustrated, he was thinking less
about his boldness in running away from the parental tyranny of
his children than about the fact that in the taut grey suit and
the small tricorne hat which Hazel had assumed for motoring she
looked ten years younger than when, soft and flowing, hinting of
the harem, she appeared in an afternoon frock, phony jewellery
and household cares. He observed that she was beginning to permit
herself the questionable privilege of enjoying life. Could she
ever be cured of her servitude to Things, her love of Possessions
and of establishing her secure respectability by showing them
off? Could she ever be free of blue china and of lacy mats?</p>

<p>She said cheerfully, 'It'll be interesting to see Saratoga
Springs.'</p>

<p>'Yes, I guess maybe it would be, some day.'</p>

<p>'How do you mean? What are you being so mysterious about?'</p>

<p>'You don't know half of it. Listen, honey! I'm the most
mysterious guy in this whole length and breadth of Sachem Falls!
I'm Frenzied Fred, the Masked Menace. I'm right out of Edgar
Wallace. I'm J. G. Reeder, with a dagger in my fountain pen.'</p>

<p>'Idiot! What <i>are</i> you . . .'</p>

<p>'I'm the man with three faces--all of 'em prob'ly a
mistake.'</p>

<p>'Darling, I thought I heard you sneak downstairs last night
and have a little nip.'</p>

<p>'It's worse than liquor, woman. It's the wine of life. It's .
. .'</p>

<p>'Please stop trying to be cute, Fred, and tell me what you're
up to.'</p>

<p>'Oh, we're merely taking the Golden Road to Samarkand!'</p>

<p>'Well, it may look so to you, but it looks to me like Route
29; and it may be gold, but right along here, there seem to be
patches of cement.'</p>

<p>'Don't notice it. Some poor cusses on the WPA came along last
night and pinched this stretch of gold. You'll see it again in
couple blocks.'</p>

<p>'Fred, dearest, I don't mind, but are you cuckoo?'</p>

<p>'Completely! See that man there?'</p>

<p>'What man, where?'</p>

<p>'Sitting up on the bonnet of the car--the little fellow with
the pointed hat and the green whiskers?'</p>

<p>'Oh--yes--well--I can't say I see him very clearly.'</p>

<p>'You will, if you stick around with me long enough. That
clears it all up, don't it?'</p>

<p>Not a word more would he say till he had turned at right
angles off Fenimore Cooper Boulevard, which led straight to
Saratoga. Now, the car was headed south-east.</p>

<p>'Where are we going?' wondered Hazel. But she said it without
alarm, for whatever she might think of Fred's capacity as a
romantic lover, he was to her the Beethoven of motoring.</p>

<p>'What's trouble?' he droned.</p>

<p>'Why, the car seems headed in the wrong direction.'</p>

<p>'It does? Doggone! We'll just have to go along with it, I
guess. Too fast for us to jump.'</p>

<p>'Frederick, will you please stop all this coyness . . .'</p>

<p>'I know. But I feel so cheerful and free--and unusual--and
therefore silly!'</p>

<p>'Well, quit it a moment, won't you? I'm sorry, but this is not
the road to Saratoga!'</p>

<p>'Whoever said it was?'</p>

<p>'Aren't we going to Saratoga?'</p>

<p>'Whatever made you think we were?'</p>

<p>'I heard you telephoning to Howard . . .'</p>

<p>'Has it ever been your opinion that our darling son is a safe
man to trust the truth with?'</p>

<p>'Then where are we going?'</p>

<p>'I think--unless we change my mind--we're going to an inn at
Stonefield, Mass., east of Lenox. But does it matter where we
land up, as long as nobody can catch us, and we can quit being
responsible parents for a few days and see if we're still human
beings also? How about it?'</p>

<p>'I--I don't think it's such a bad idea. I do like going with
you.'</p>

<p>'Remember one evening I was kind of talking about retiring? I
haven't forgotten it. Maybe I'm not so satisfied with what Fred
Cornplow has done with life. I want to try and see--just
experiment and try and see if there aren't some new things I'm
not too old to learn, just for the fun of learning 'em. And then
. . . About Sara and Howard. One reason for this running off is,
I figure that if I can be plumb away from 'em for a while, where
they can't find us and interfere, I'll get over my irritation and
quit being so mean to 'em.'</p>

<p>'I didn't think you were so mean.'</p>

<p>'Well, if you didn't, then I missed the target pretty bad,
because I certainly set out to be mean. Maybe what I'll get out
of this trip will be ability to be a whole lot meaner. Anyway,
something interesting is bound to happen to anybody nowadays who
has the nerve to buck this Reign of Youth. Rights for the
Uptrodden!'</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>They sat for half an hour on a hilltop of rough upland
pasture, loud with insects; they sat on the running board,
contentedly saying nothing at all, and his cigarette tasted
good.</p>

<p>They had lunch at a farmhouse, under the maples, and he
crowed, 'You simply can't get real fried chicken and home-made
ice cream like this in the city!' She did not explain that the
chicken had undoubtedly come from a can, the ice cream from a
renowned creamery in Troy.</p>

<p>They had, in mid-afternoon, an old-fashioned milk shake in a
village drug-store and, while Hazel cooed at them to make them
feel neighbourly, Fred and the druggist told each other that they
had elegant motors, handsome and co-operative children,
constructive ideas about the future of the Republican party, and
that life was a good idea. Grey-haired, grey-browed, in grey
alpaca jacket, his grey hands thin and long, the druggist leaned
his elbows on the counter and meditated, 'Nice thing about my
business is, grand people like you come in and pass the time of
day.'</p>

<p>Fred went out to the car in a one-man parade. He liked to be
grand people, reflected Hazel. 'Set that man down in Warsaw or
Tokyo', she thought proudly, 'and inside an hour he'd know the
names of all the children of the nearest cigar-store man and all
the taxi-drivers and the policeman on the block . . . In that,
he's like Howard. Maybe some day I'll get my two men
together!'</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>It was not over a hundred and fifty miles from Sachem to
Stonefield, and for Fred, normally, that was one-third of a day's
driving, but they so happily dawdled, enchanted by deep meadows
and thick trees, that at five they were still fifty miles from
Stonefield, and filling up with petrol at the Daisy Dell Cabins
and Caf&eacute;, All Home Comforts, Flats Fixed.</p>

<p>The Daisy Dell establishment seemed to have been constructed
by the carpentry class of a kindergarten. The only reason, Hazel
surmised, why no resolute burglar had picked up a couple of the
cabins and carried them away was that they would have been of use
for nothing but kindling.</p>

<p>With distress she heard Fred cackling, 'Say, I got an idea!
What say we spend the night at this dump?'</p>

<p>'But we could be in Stonefield in time for dinner, easy, and I
think these cabins look awfully sloppy.'</p>

<p>'Sure. Prob'ly are. But be kinda fun--be a change, camping
out.'</p>

<p>'And terrible mattresses. Lumpy.'</p>

<p>'Be good for our souls to not be so dunked in luxury for one
night.'</p>

<p>'Well, if you'd like to. But I never did think much of
martyrdom if it's going to be uncomfortable.'</p>

<p>'Huh! Think of the lousy camel drivers' huts we'll have to
sleep in along the road to Samarkand.'</p>

<p>'And think of what a joke it'll be on us if we wake up in one
of those huts and find it's on the wrong road.
<i>However!'</i></p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<center>
<h1>CHAPTER XXIV</h1>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>The Daisy Dell Cabins were thin and tall, with a list to
leeward; they were of clapboards, once painted white, but the raw
pine had soaked up the paint. The yard before them was lined with
gravel and cinders and inhabited by a shamefaced dog given to
constant scratching. Something more had been done with the
'caf&eacute;', the camp's central building, a four-room shanty
with a public room fresh painted a bright yellow and containing
chairs and tables in booths, and a counter for five-cent bars of
decayed candy, cigarettes, pies, and 'souvenirs' in a way of
china ash trays lettered 'Greetings from Butiful Daisy Dell'.</p>

<p>Pa and Ma Stickle were the proprietors. Pa had a moustache
apparently made of raw cotton, which needed changing, and the
tails of his collarless shirt should have been tucked in oftener,
and Ma had smut on her nose. Yet they were friendly as old
milk-route horses, and seemed instantly to recognize Fred as one
of their own disreputable race of vagabonds.</p>

<p>When Fred had registered--he wrote it down 'Frederick
Williams, N.Y.', so that he might not be traced--Pa Stickle
whispered, 'Say, neighbour, of course we haven't got a licence
here, but a fellow I don't know his name left some applejack and
I thought maybe you might be thirsty after driving . . .'</p>

<p>Fred drank, then choked, gurgled, looked around as though
wondering who had hit him, and immediately became hilarious.
Hazel had a finger of applejack in ginger-ale, hiccupped,
murmured, 'Gracious sakes alive!' and began to giggle. When she
heard Fred laughing at her, she stared at him with mild bovine
disapproval and suddenly became as hilarious as he.</p>

<p>They did not dine till seven, two hours later, but they were
enchanted out of the flow of time. They told Pa Stickle all about
themselves and listened while Pa narrated that he had been a
ship's cook, a vaudeville dancer, an arctic explorer and (since
Fred and Hazel seemed to have swallowed all this, as safely as
they had the applejack) a trader in the Solomon Isles.</p>

<p>'That's a grand old boy, and I'll bet anyway five per cent of
his stories are true,' glowed Fred, as Pa departed to bring their
hamburg steak with fried onions.</p>

<p>Hazel was more or less serious. 'But d'you think we ought to
start off our journey by associating with such low people?'</p>

<p>'Low? Low? Thank God they're low! After Sara, Pa tastes good
to me--like a mutton chop after a diet of cheese souffl&eacute;.
I love to be low. Like getting back to earth. Provided it ain't
Cousin Enos Tillery's earth. Don't want any earth in my
ears!'</p>

<p>'Well . . . But I'm sure the hamburgs won't be very good.'</p>

<p>They weren't, but Hazel left unconsumed only one snippet of
fried butcher's paper which had got in among the onions.</p>

<p>From the Daisy Dell, only a couple of farmhouses were to be
seen, far off, but by eight o'clock the place was filled with
rustic versions of Sara and Howard. The caf&eacute; did smell,
rather, of frying pans, paraffin, cabbage and Stickles, but it
was lively with yellow paint and pink paper doilies and
soft-drink posters showing bathing girls, and it crackled now
with jokes fresh from the radio. Fred admired one young lady in a
silk frock decorated with red poppies, in silk stockings and
silver slippers, who sat on a high stool delicately sipping a
lemonade into which her escort, a young man with a plaid pullover
and an irremovable camel's-hair cap, kept pouring gin.</p>

<p>'Expensive-looking pair,' Fred hinted to Pa Stickle. 'The
young lady in silk.'</p>

<p>'Her? Oh yes. Smart girl. She's daughter of Ole Man Bocks, up
the road here a piece--the one that's doing time for burning down
folks' barns, seems like he just can't keep from it, somehow, and
she's got a fine job, working for Doc Onderdonck's folks down in
the village--eight dollars a week, yessir, and the washing sent
out.' You bet. But that ain't no silk--it's rayon--eleven-fifty
for the dress and 'tain't paid for, neither!'</p>

<p>'Oh dear, I'm afraid this place is too fast for conservative
people like us,' yawned Hazel. 'I'm going to bed right away.'</p>

<p>'I'm going to hit the hay pretty sudden myself,' agreed
Fred.</p>

<p>But at eleven, when Hazel had slipped off to their cottage,
Fred was playing poker in the kitchen with Pa Stickle, a brush
salesman, the local auctioneer, who was also the local
assemblyman, and a hired man, and was losing steadily to all of
them and enjoying it. Afterward Ma Stickle invited them to share
what she called 'couple sandwiches or something', which proved to
consist of beans, brown bread, clam chowder, honey, cold fish and
applejack. All of it Fred devoured; he imitated Pa Stickle in
lying preposterously about his travels; and he went across the
cinder courtyard to bed in his cabin, weaving and inclined to
music.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>Fred did not look very closely at their cabin at Daisy Dell
until he awoke, in the sway-backed bed, on a mattress filled with
iron ore and paving stones, at eight in the morning. He had a
head, and he knew that Dr. Kamerkink would have been profane
about his liver and blood pressure, but he lay and chuckled at
his idiocy of the night before.</p>

<p>With slight whimpers as the sutures of his skull cracked open
and closed again, he sat on the bed, surveying the caravansary in
Samarkand for which they had given up their pink-and-cream
bedroom. It was the largest cabin at the Dell; a double one,
containing no furniture except the two wiggly iron beds, two
straight chairs, a piano lamp minus its shade, a mirror, and a
bureau which lacked one drawer. The wall was covered with plaster
the colour of withered lettuce, with map-shaped holes where the
plaster had fallen, but gloriously, startlingly, on it were hung,
by count, nine pictorial calendars, presenting kittens in
baskets, cherries in baskets, little girls tormenting little
dogs, and a church beside a moonlit lake.</p>

<p>Fred turned to look at Hazel, and she was lying drowsily
awake, smiling at him.</p>

<p>'Isn't it lovely--the room,' she said, blessedly making no
comment whatever upon his hour of returning last night. 'But what
I was thinking was: I never enjoyed a drive in my life as much as
yesterday. When we were a young married couple, there were always
the children along, bawling and asking questions. Remember how
Sara used to say "Why?" . . . "Ma-ma, why is that man ploughing
the field?" "So he can plant his seed--now hush, dear." "Why?"
"So he can grow crops." "Why?" "So he can sell them." "Why?" "So
he can support his family." "Why?"'</p>

<p>'Sensible question, the last one.'</p>

<p>'And ever since, seems like we've always had to get somewhere
on time, and then get right back for an "important
engagement".'</p>

<p>'I didn't know how you'd feel this morning, when you woke up
and had another look at this dump.'</p>

<p>'I don't mind it, because I don't have to worry about whether
Hilda will get around to vacuum-cleaning it to-day. Honestly, did
I ever worry about things like that? Seems so long ago.'</p>

<p>'Don't it!' What a little wizard he was, Fred exulted. Already
he had Hazel half-cured of her slavery to possessions. Then she
was firmly remarking:</p>

<p>'Fun here--for a change--for one night. But of course I didn't
sleep much. This mattress is like a relief map of the
Adirondacks. But it might be nice to have a nice cottage in the
country.'</p>

<p>'Yes!'</p>

<p>'But of course we'd want it nice--you know--a swimming pool
and a greenhouse, oh, just a little one. But nice. And I do
think, mornings when you don't feel so good, it's economy in the
long run to have the girl bring you a nice breakfast in bed.'</p>

<p>'Well,' said the diminished Fredk Wm.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<center>
<h1>CHAPTER XXV</h1>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>The hills were not so proud as their own Adirondacks, but
softer, more feminine, thought Fred, as they came to Stonefield,
a dormered and white-spired hamlet in the Berkshires. The tavern,
where Fred again craftily registered as Frederick Williams, N.Y.,
was no Daisy Dell, but a competent grey-shingled inn, and the
annex cottages were isolated on the slope of a hillside dark with
pines, light with maples, gleaming with a cleared meadow.</p>

<p>In front, the Cornplows' cottage looked from a half-screened
wide porch, through the columns of a pine grove, to a meadow, and
to a pond which would be silver at dawn, blazing in late
afternoon, a shield of rose and black just after sunset. At the
back, from a minute brick terrace edged with gloxinia, it looked
up to the hills, which led the exploring eye from a mountain
ridge to ever higher ridges beyond. There were but three rooms:
living-room, double bedroom, and kitchen with dining alcove. The
cottagers could prepare their own meals or dine at the
tavern.</p>

<p>The rooms were ceiled with soft-stained pine; the only
pictures were a few sharply coloured prints; the fireplace was of
the simplest--brick with a pine mantel; and everything possible
had been built in: bookshelves, bureau, dressing-table, couch.
The dishes, Hazel found, gently squealing with domestic fervour,
were of the best five-and-ten-cent native pottery, made by
handmade machinery; there were, incredibly, enough ash trays, and
these devised to hold ashes and butts and not to display
reproductions of the higher-class barnyard fauna; the screen
doors closed tightly without a bang; and there was a shower as
well as a smallish tub.</p>

<p>'It's swell!' said Fred, with an idiotic look of bliss.</p>

<p>He paraded around and around the cottage, as proud as once he
had been, years ago, when he had first become an owner of
property. That had been one lot, with a four-room yellow house,
but every foot was miraculously different from all other earth.
Why, its one maple tree had roots and branches and a real
bird's-nest, and the sun clung to its trunk, as it never did
elsewhere on the block!</p>

<p>He discovered that the name of their cottage was William Tyler
Longwhale. Anyway, said Hazel, that was better than naming the
cottages Romeo and Portia and Desdemona. They never did find out
who the historical William Tyler Longwhale may have been, but
Fred insisted on giving their hermitage its full fruity name.</p>

<p>They sat on their porch at dusk. There had been strawberry
shortcake for dinner, down at the tavern; they were full of
shortcake and humanitarianism. The meadow below them was
hysterical with unusually late fireflies; it resembled a still,
dark pool reflecting transient stars.</p>

<p>'D'you realize,' marvelled Hazel, 'that this is the first time
we've had a house that's entirely our own?'</p>

<p>'I had some such an idee,' said Frederick William.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>Not even to a sub-agent who might order fifty cars had Fred
ever paid such court as he now was paying to Hazel. He had
brought his clubs, and Hazel expected him to spend hours a day
golfing, during which time she planned to do a little happy,
unnecessary cleaning. But he was irritated at having to do
anything, even follow the rules of golf. 'Coupla days, what say
we just stroll; not go anywhere in particular,' he proposed to
Hazel, and she pondered, 'Why, yes, I suppose we
<i>could!'</i></p>

<p>Panting a little, very sweaty, observing that Fred's 'wind'
had not been improved by cigarettes, carrying extra sweaters and
wishing they hadn't, delighted at the convenience of stopping to
see a view without having to find a parking place, they crawled,
like two benevolent caterpillars gone vertical, up peaks from
which they peered at the placid valley of the Housatonic, into
orchards where early apples were afire in the long sweet grass,
through pine groves which remembered old German fairy stories. On
the multi-coloured stone flagging of the terrace at the King's
Arms, the grand hotel of the region, where Austrian counts, their
Chicago countesses, and even proud Amherst and Williams students
skied all winter, they lazily drank to each other, not to a
nervous gang of Sachem citizens determined to be gay and like
it.</p>

<p>But Fred's favourite goal was the country store in Stonefield
Centre, with its back door opening on forty acres of pasture and
sugar maples. Amid the overalls, slabs of dried codfish, patent
medicines, and country-auction posters, Hazel and he sat on boxes
and listened to the storekeeper's libellous stories about Judge
Basser, down the road, of whose housekeeper, who had been with
him for twenty-seven years now, people were beginning to suspect
the worst.</p>

<p>When they had left this refuge, scented with the molasses
sweetness of chewing tobacco, dusty and quiet and serene, Hazel
sighed, 'I like going there. Oh dear, I don't suppose there'll be
any old-fashioned stores left in ten years--just glass and
air-conditioning and telephone.'</p>

<p>'I thought you were the one that liked all these modern
improvements--electric kitchens,' he jeered.</p>

<p>'Well, that's different,' she answered in her adequate, wifely
way.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>Their house in Sachem, he perceived, no longer belonged to
them except by the artificial convention of deeds and lawbooks.
It belonged to Sara, to Howard, to Annabel, to their friends, to
the telephone company and the gas-furnace man and the meter
reader, to their maid, and to their maid's sister, sister-in-law,
and sister-in-law's sister's son and his large red toy
automobile. But William Tyler Longwhale was theirs alone.</p>

<p>Hazel had so zealously taken to housekeeping that she wanted
to prepare not only breakfast but lunch and dinner. He caught her
just in time to keep her from putting on the hair shirt of
domestic discipline. 'That's why we ran away, to avoid
fussing.'</p>

<p>'Well, I just thought I'd fix up a bit for lunch--just some
cold meat--no real cooking.'</p>

<p>'I see. Just cold meat. And a little soup, maybe?'</p>

<p>'Oh yes, I thought I might make a little hot soup . . .'</p>

<p>'And a couple hot vegetables?'</p>

<p>'No, only one. Honestly. Just some nice peas.'</p>

<p>'And hot potatoes, of course.'</p>

<p>'Oh, of course, <i>potatoes!'</i></p>

<p>'How about dessert?'</p>

<p>'Oh, a tiny bit of prune whip--so light--nothing to make . .
.'</p>

<p>'You know, Hazel, you read where women are so much more
dependable about bringing up kids and caring for property than
men. Fact is, women over-elaborate everything and make life twice
as complicated as any normal man ever would, and then they kick
because the men don't jump in and kill themselves taking care of
things they never wanted in the first place. You can bet no male
ever invented dancing schools for children, or lace collars, or
sweet little bows to parents, or eating with forks, or saying
"please" and "thank you". No man ever invented perfume or round
flower beds or service plates or doilies or velvet upholstery or
dress suits and boiled shirts--and if some tailor invented 'em,
well, he didn't do it; his wife did!'</p>

<p>'In other words, women have been trying to make life a little
pleasant and civilized, while men prefer to live in mud dug-outs
and never wash,' said Hazel, firmly, as she started to make the
prune whip.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<h1>CHAPTER XXVI</h1>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>Men at the dangerous age, between forty-five and sixty,
occasionally do land in court and have to writhe over their
letters beginning 'Sweetest little earwig', but most of them have
not only forgotten how to make love but forgotten that there ever
has been so extraordinary a mania as that in which competent
young males believe that some run-of-the-mill female, of a
physique set forth in the anatomy books without any deception or
anything up the sleeve, a young woman with toothaches, freckles,
the hives, and admitted ignorance of Bach and bio-chemistry, is a
new Helen of Troy.</p>

<p>Fred was of the more fortunate fraction. He exalted Hazel, not
as a being of fire, ice and chronic hysteria, but as a companion
true as bread and salt.</p>

<p>He had heard that a man sees the ageing of his contemporaries
but never sees it in himself. But while he was conscious of his
own swelling middle, his violent lack of interest in anything
happening after one a.m., and the torture of trying to interest
elfin young females skipping about at dances, yet in Hazel he
could see no change. Oh yes. She did have grey hair. What of it?
Went beautifully with her blue-eyed pinkness. And maybe the least
bit more plump? Improved her. Didn't he seem to remember that,
thirty years ago, she had been too skinny?</p>

<p>He sang to her 'Ev'ry morn I bring thee vi'lets', but what he
actually brought her every morn was fresh eggs. He walked all the
way to the King's Arms for chocolate pralines and the New York
tabloids, and what could more add to a vagabond vacation than
pictures of hammer slayers and punctured gunmen? Every night he
kissed her; every morning he patted her hand. He admitted that
these attentions might fall short of rapture, but he guessed that
if he had done anything more, she would have been justifiably
suspicious about his recent private conduct. He knew that in
exile she was happy. She smiled at him naturally, and she hummed
over the morning ham and eggs.</p>

<p>He was not conscienceless enough to be quite happy in
deserting his family. When he walked alone at twilight, or in the
tavern lounge he heard the radio play old songs, he remembered
the curly-headed, tiny Howard, with a kitten, and the minute
Sarah--not Sara, then--who had demanded the string cradles that
no one but Daddy could make. The worst thing about real babies
and kittens is that they look so much like sentimental chromos of
babies and kittens.</p>

<p>In such an hour of grey nostalgia he could not have endured
exile without the presence of Hazel. He dashed back to her for
protection, and he fretted, while she sat before the rustic
dressing-table, her handsome arms upraised to her hair, 'Say,
hon, maybe we ought to write the folks now--see how the Duplex
and the new-married couple are getting on.'</p>

<p>'Don't you do any such a thing, Fred. Let 'em learn how to get
along by themselves for a while.'</p>

<p>'Well, if you think so . . .' he said.</p>

<p>And next morning when Hazel was brisk over the stove, and he
came in with an armful of wood, feeling like Paul Bunyan, the god
of the lumber-choppers, he crowed, 'Are you happy?'</p>

<p>Once, placidly knitting on the shadow-dancing porch of William
Tyler Longwhale, Hazel explained, 'Of course you spoiled both our
children. You always were a man to go to extremes. First you
encourage 'em to walk over you, and then you fly right to the
other extreme and want to run off to Abyssinia to get away from
'em.'</p>

<p>'Maybe. But isn't it the craziest doggone thing in this crazy
world to-day, where half the nations are willing to go to war for
the right to be slaves, that children have become the bossy
parents, now, and the parents scared kids! Say, how did an
easy-going couple like me and you ever have such a pair of
Japanese waltzing mice for children?'</p>

<p>'Spoiled 'em, I tell you. You <i>and</i> me.' Hazel was more
placid than ever.</p>

<p>'Maybe.'</p>

<p>'Let's go up to the King's Arms and have a cocktail.'</p>

<p>'Fine. Happy?'</p>

<p>'So happy!'</p>

<p>On the seventh morning of their refuge in Stonefield, Fred
awoke at six-thirty, too gay and clearheaded to lie abed. He
marched out to the porch, down to the drift of pine needles, in
his nightshirt and bare feet. He knew the earth was chilly, yet
he did not seem to be chilled. 'Reg'lar grizzly, that's what I
am!' he gloated. The ticklish needles felt good to his feet, and
the scent of pines and earth and grass and dew was a curtain
shutting him away from the odours of gasoline and wet cement.</p>

<p>From inside he could hear the sleepy-headed Hazel grousing,
'<i>What</i> an hour to be getting up!'</p>

<p>He bellowed that she was to stay in bed. In the kitchen he
plugged in the coffee percolator and returned to the porch to
loll on a swing couch, violently at peace. He heard Hazel padding
about the kitchen; she could not yet believe that a man could
master so difficult a domestic task as measuring coffee and water
into a percolator. She came out with two cups on a very fine tray
which they had bought at the country store for ten cents; she
perched beside him and kissed his cheek.</p>

<p>'What say we take William Tyler Longwhale for all summer?'
suggested Fred. 'Every couple weeks or so, I could go back to
Sachem for maybe one day.'</p>

<p>'Yes. Let's! Oh, good heavens! Oh, <i>no!'</i></p>

<p>A Triumph Special sedan had slid out of the pine grove and up
the grassy road to their porch, and out of it were dribbling Sara
and Howard.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>With suspicious sweetness, Sara commented, 'Oh, Father! Bare
feet? How cute!'</p>

<p>Fred glanced down. They looked worse than cute; they looked
absurd, those objects called feet which till now he had taken for
granted; those flat blobs of flesh, pallid from city living,
fringed with imitation fingers. But he flung at Howard, bravely
enough, 'How d'you ever find us here?'</p>

<p>'Oh, it took Ben Bogey all of half an hour on the
long-distance telephone--he just described you and the car--a
cinch, with those red fenders. We've known where you were for
three-four days now, but we thought we'd let you enjoy yourselves
and imagine you'd made a getaway. But now . . . You promised Ben
to let us have some more capital, and we need it pretty bad. And
we got a chance for the contract on a new development, Capitola
Lodge, but the owners want to talk to you.'</p>

<p>'And the cook has quit--and I swear I don't know why--I gave
her so much attention,' said Sara.</p>

<p>'And Annabel is awfully worried about you two getting
rheumatism here.'</p>

<p>'And I had to go to the Rochester tournament without any
chaperon--oh, that was so thoughtless of you!'</p>

<p>'And Cal Tillery had a run-in with Paul Popple, and he thinks,
and so do I, you ought to take a look at the way Popple tries to
run things.'</p>

<p>'And Louise Kamerkink says you promised to go to dinner there
last Thursday.'</p>

<p>'And Popple's got some papers for you to sign--he's simply
going nuts.'</p>

<p>'And everybody's talking--wondering whatever possessed
you.'</p>

<p>'And Annabel says that her father says that he knows this
dump, and why didn't you go to the King's Arms?'</p>

<p>'And the way I've had to lie to people, and I hate to lie
except when it's necessary, and the Coheeze bills are still
coming in, and not one word from Gene Silga. The double-crosser!
Honestly, I hate to say it, but don't you think it was a little
thoughtless of you?'</p>

<p>'And of course, after all, Sara and Bell and I are only kids,
and we've done our best to carry on, but . . . I'd never think of
trying to tell you your duty, but . . .'</p>

<p>'Well, I would! Honestly, my dears, I wish I could get the
picture. What is it? Brave bold pioneers, right out of the
movies, returned to the simple days of our forefathers, when men
were men and never bathed, and the brats weren't demanding, like
Howard and me, but always did what they were told to, and
ploughed before breakfast, and walked six miles to the li'l' red
schoolhouse and liked it?'</p>

<p>'Grrrrr!' said Fred.</p>

<p>Sara was laughing in quite a well-bred, filial manner as she
went on:</p>

<p>'Darlings, I do wish I could see you as tanned and resolute
frontiersmen, but I just don't; I see you as pretty pale and
overweight, and--do forgive me--in terrible shape for lack of
exercise. You'd have done much better, in my humble opinion, if
you'd stayed home and seen Dr. Kamerkink and dieted and played
golf. And, honestly, I don't think a pre-Civil-War nightshirt is
such a romantic garment! And your dear li'l' hide-away--rather
damp, isn't it? And <i>did</i> they have to go and give it a name
like "William Tyler Longwhale"?'</p>

<p>Oh yes, even with her dark Dianic power, that was the most
that Sara could do to them: take away all their joy in the
adventure; make the still nights they had known, and the placid
days, the sight of distant valleys and their sharing of renewed
love seem the vain calf sickness of a premature senility. That
was all she could do, but such as it was, she accomplished it
with the skill she had learned in her diversified training as
outlaw communist and polite tennis star.</p>

<p>So Fred and Hazel went back into captivity.</p>

<p>A week after their return to Sachem, Fred applied for their
passports. When, or whether, they would ever be used, he did not
know.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<center>
<h1>CHAPTER XXVII</h1>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>The autumn, no very great season in the selling of motor cars,
had become lively with the sale of trailers in which those
citizens of Sachem Falls who had retired from the economic
struggle, because they had too much money or too little, planned
to go to Florida or California for winter. The Duplex had been
booming all summer, but in September, Fred's treacherous rivals,
the Conqueror Motor Company, dealt the Duplex a nasty blow with
its announcement of the Allover Caravan.</p>

<p>The Allover was not a trailer, but built like a bus, with the
motor contained in the body. It burst on Sachem with full-page
newspaper advertisements which asserted convincingly that the
Allover was easier to drive, easier to park, and much easier to
handle in passing other cars. As a minor virtue, in this war of
transportation with its almost theological disputation, the
Allover's furnishings could readily be removed, turning it into a
truck.</p>

<p>A sound commercial warrior like Fred would have hated any
opposition at all which took money away from him, but in this
particular attack, he persuaded himself, there was something
malign, for Putnam Staybridge, putative father to Annabel, was
known to be part owner of the Conqueror company. And, Fred
complained, hadn't he gone and made a fool of himself and thought
the Cornplows and the Staybridges were getting on to better
terms? For the good Putnam had invited Howard and Annabel for a
week at his Adirondack cabin, and Sara for a week-end . . .
Everybody except the persons concerned seemed to feel that Fred
and Hazel had already had as much vacation as was good for
them.</p>

<p>The day after the Allover advertisements appeared, Staybridge
invited Fred to call upon him, at the general offices of the
Liberty Bell Clock Company. 'Hell with him; let him come here and
call on me; I won't go a step,' growled Fred, as he reached for
his hat.</p>

<p>Staybridge's office, with its large mahogany table for the
directors and the small polished desk for the president, looked
like a Colonial dining-room. You could almost smell boiled
codfish.</p>

<p>Staybridge was cautiously cordial in his 'How do'.</p>

<p>'Hear you all had a fine time at the cottage, Brother
Staybridge.'</p>

<p>'Oh yes. Very agreeable. Your son--uh, Howard, uh--is an
excellent swimmer. Really! So sorry we didn't have room to invite
Mrs. Cornplow and yourself.'</p>

<p>'Oh, we had our vacation . . . I suppose you might say. And
what can I do for you?'</p>

<p>Staybridge looked as though he thought Fred was being rude.
Fred was sorry, but he felt rude; in the damp cold air that
Staybridge perpetually exuded, he always felt rude. But the
gentlemanly assassin of Duplexes was saying graciously:</p>

<p>'No doubt you will have noted the advertisements of the
Allover Caravans--the Conqueror company.'</p>

<p>'Good ads! Fine!'</p>

<p>'Kind of you to say so. It just happens that I have some small
interest in the Conqueror company.'</p>

<p>'Ur.'</p>

<p>'And I have thought of suggesting to them that they come to
some agreement with you, possibly even joint advertising. Since
your Duplex is a trailer, and the Allover not, they need not
exactly be in competition, and I was thinking that if we--or
rather, I should say, they--combined, you might in a way dominate
the field together--freeze out the others, I believe it is
called.'</p>

<p>'Yes. It's called that. It's also called stifling competition,
and ganging up on the other racketeers.'</p>

<p>'Oh? What I was really thinking was that since the Duplex is
not made by the Triumph company, you might conceivably try to
arrange with the makers to dispose of it to us. Particularly
since I understand from your son--uh, from Howard--that you are
giving some thought to retiring in four or five years.'</p>

<p>Staybridge's persistent objection to remembering Howard's name
would have been enough to irritate Fred handsomely; it wanted
only the pinch-nosed patronage with which Staybridge was going
on:</p>

<p>'Of course I don't know what you plan to do, if you retire. I
shouldn't have thought you were cursed with hobbies, as I am. But
no doubt you'll find something with which to busy yourself, more
or less. But the point is, if you feel like retiring, just
possibly you might not care to face the rather sharp opposition
that, I'm afraid, the Conqueror company, with its large
resources, is planning to give you. I'm sure you'd be wise to
take it easy.'</p>

<p>This to Fred Cornplow, who had never in his life evaded a
fight--except with Sara. He exploded up from his chair, but he
managed to be fairly calm as he croaked:</p>

<p>'Me? Retire? Where d'you suppose Howard (that's my son) ever
got such a foolish idea? Not me! I like a scrap too well. But
thanks for the tip. Morning!'</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>Opposite the large Conqueror agency, Fred hired a vacant lot,
and within three days he had installed there a Duplex Trailer
display in open air. He had one side ripped off a Duplex, so that
its hidden domesticities were revealed. He engaged two men and
two young women of a stranded night-club troupe, with a couple of
children, and this theatrical family was displayed living the
life of Riley in the trailer. They prepared and smackingly
devoured large meals; on the roof they drank tea and afterward
danced to a radio; they modestly retired, in the several chambers
provided when the roof was hoisted; and all one night they
remained abed in the Duplex, before a tremendous crowd which
stayed up till two a.m. to behold human beings engaged in so very
odd a practice as sleeping.</p>

<p>Duplex sales doubled, and Fred's spy in the Conqueror agency
reported that salesmen who attempted to demonstrate Allover
Caravans were answered with jeers. A week after the opening of
Fred's circus, Staybridge telephoned him again, but Fred found
himself too busy to call. The next day Annabel came in, and
Annabel was near to giggling.</p>

<p>'My father asked me to tell you he thinks your Duplex cabaret
is vulgar.'</p>

<p>'Do you think so?'</p>

<p>'Yes.'</p>

<p>'So what?'</p>

<p>'Oh, I like vulgarity. All the interesting things in life are
so vulgar, Father Cornplow: birth and death and battles. Have I
done my job?'</p>

<p>'Eh?'</p>

<p>'Have I complained properly about the vulgarity?'</p>

<p>'Darling!'</p>

<p>Next night a curious thing happened. A man named Tom McKuffee,
a truck farmer who lived nine miles south-east of Sachem, and who
had bought an Allover Caravan that afternoon, had an unfortunate
accident at or near midnight. In front of the Duplex show lot he
tried to park his Allover, but the brakes failed, the Allover
dashed in to the lot and was wrecked against a pile of rocks
which no one seemed previously to have noticed there. McKuffee,
though he could not stop the caravan, had time to jump.</p>

<p>Now he was no hit-and-run driver, even if the object of his
solicitude was merely a pile of rocks. He walked to the police
station, admitted the accident, and explained that the brakes had
failed; explained it so eloquently that a green reporter noted
the fact in his story. The detail got past the copyreaders, and
in the paper next morning there was an almost libellous statement
about the brakes of an Allover.</p>

<p>It was only an item, but the scene of one caravan wrecked,
while hard by, in another, night-club ladies were dancing and
sipping ginger ale from highball glasses, was too much for the
art editor of the evening paper. By this time, the struggle
between Duplex and Allover was so familiar to all Sachem
motorists that there was no need of a legend to explain what were
the makes of the caravans in the newspaper photograph.</p>

<p>All the day after, persons who looked as though they might
have trailer money in their pockets stood and admired the
cabaret, snickered at the wreck. McKuffee happened, by a
coincidence, to be there, and he seemed glad to explain how the
accident had occurred, and to point out how flimsy were the
smashed and exposed furnishings of the Allover. By another
coincidence, Fred Cornplow knew McKuffee, who had once been the
Triumph foreman.</p>

<p>'You <i>are</i> rubbing it in. Old Putnam will never speak to
any of us again,' Sara reproached her father, yet in her he
detected admiration.</p>

<p>In another day there were double-page advertisements of the
Allover in the papers, but people in limousines, in shops, on
street corners laughed at them. The Allover wreck remained there
for a week. Then came the chief of police to Fred and offered to
cart it away.</p>

<p>'No, you needn't. Glad to accommodate the fellow that owns the
thing--what's his name?--McGurrey?--till he raises the money to
get it overhauled.'</p>

<p>'There was something funny about this accident,' said the
chief darkly and returned to his bezique, after a telephone
call.</p>

<p>For a week, not one Allover Caravan was sold. This fact Fred
conveyed to Hazel, who protested:</p>

<p>'Why, you absolute pirate! I thought you'd reformed!'</p>

<p>'Look here! I tried to reform. I tried to go off on a
pilgrimage and become a better and tenderer man, and my two brats
objected. Can I help it?'</p>

<p>Mr. Putnam Staybridge telephoned to Mr. Frederick
Cornplow:</p>

<p>'Uh, I thought you might just possibly be interested to know
that the Conqueror agency, or so I am informed, intend to reduce
their advertising for Allover Caravans to, uh, to approximately
the same space used for Duplexes.'</p>

<p>'Thanks,' said Fred. He removed the show trailer, and
McKuffee's wreck vanished. But he learned later, all his kindness
could not stir up a proper sale of Allovers.</p>

<p>Hazel sighed, 'Well, now you've had another big success, I
suppose you've got your teeth in it so firm that you and I'll
never be running off together again.'</p>

<p>'You mean it? You'd like to?'</p>

<p>'I <i>think</i> so.'</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<center>
<h1>CHAPTER XXVIII</h1>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>The scene was, for Fred, too fragile and artificial for
comfort, yet he admired its gaiety: the club tennis courts, the
white cement, the green balls flying, and the young people in
white, young men with blue and crimson scarves above white
shirts, girls with white shorts and honey-coloured legs, all
against hills flamboyant with late September. He particularly
liked the tall umpire's chair, now empty. To be perched up there,
above the conflict yet close to it and dominating it, would be
kingly, he explained to Walter Lindbeck.</p>

<p>'Awful. I knew a fellow got a tennis ball in his eye just when
Fred Perry was smacking the hands across the sea,' argued
Walter.</p>

<p>Mr. Walter Lindbeck, junior partner by inheritance of the
large department store of Swazey &amp; Lindbeck, was fifteen or
sixteen years younger than Fred, but he had by chance, on a
fishing trip, become one of Fred's intimates. Though he had gone
to a large university and spent a year abroad in fruitfully doing
nothing, Walter had, in Sachem, the high moral rank of: 'Steady
but progressive; a fine, conservative, forward-looking young
fella, and got no bad habits even if he is a bachelor.' He
belonged to a chess club, but he also rode horseback; he went
annually to New York City for the grand opera, but it was said
that at the S. &amp; L. Employees' Association he played pool
with the elevator men and packers. Altogether, a high type of the
youngish captain of commerce, though Sara sniffed that with a man
like Mr. Lindbeck, whose thin face, and a black moustache small
and neat as a cigarette, looked poetic, it 'made her tired' to
see him interested only in sales leaders and invoices.</p>

<p>Fred and Lindbeck had done eighteen holes of golf, and after a
quick one, they relaxed by watching Sara play tennis. Fred was
proud of her feverish speed--even prouder than of his new
waist-pleated slacks. She was opposing a dull-faced dumpy girl of
eighteen who played with the efficiency of a chopping knife. The
girl lacked all of Sara's dramatic gestures and elegant
backhands; her serves just missed the net and dropped dead before
Sara could reach them, though she galloped in like the Light
Brigade. In grieved wrath, Sara threw down her racket and
screamed, 'Can't you put some fun into the game, Daugherty? We're
not digging ditches!'</p>

<p>'Tst! Tst! Tst!' Fred clucked. 'Sara oughtn't to lose her
temper that way.'</p>

<p>Walter Lindbeck sounded partisan. 'I don't blame her a bit.
I've played that Daugherty girl. She's like lard; just plays to
win, while your daughter has so much fire and gracefulness . . .
Tell me, Fred, why the dickens did she ever get mixed up with
this communist sheet? Doesn't believe all that stuff, does
she?'</p>

<p>'I don't think so. But we've got to admit, way things are now,
the young folks and the working men are demanding more say, and
you can't blame 'em entirely.'</p>

<p>'That's so.'</p>

<p>Both men exhibited almost frightened admiration of their
liberalism.</p>

<p>'Tell you, Walter, trouble with Sara is, she hasn't got enough
to do, and she's got too much brains and energy to just stick
around. She'd like to follow the tennis tournaments to Bermuda
and Florida this winter, but I can't afford it. Say, I've got an
inspiration! She's got a great eye for colours and all that junk.
Why don't you give her a job in your interior-decorating
department? If there's any way you could fix it in your
accounting, I'd be willing to finance the scheme to the tune of a
few hundred bucks, provided she never knew it. She's so doggone
proud she wouldn't take a job like that if she found out I'd
rigged it.'</p>

<p>'Oh, that wouldn't be necessary. Matter of fact, we do need a
little new blood in the decorating department. Old Mrs. Vix is
about the period of Edward the Seventh, and I always did think
Sara had a lot of dash and go. I'd be glad to try her, if she was
interested.'</p>

<p>'She wouldn't touch it, if she thought I'd butted in. You know
how touchy all these blasted young people are to-day. If you're
interested, too--and I can't tell you how much I appreciate
it--let's get her to sell herself to you.'</p>

<p>When Sara had finished her act, Fred beckoned, and she rode up
cavalierly to sit between the two ancients. (Lindbeck was
thirteen years her senior.)</p>

<p>'Didn't seem to have such a high old time with Miss Daugherty,
Sara.'</p>

<p>'Oh, she's the dumbest cluck in the club! It's like playing
with a steam roller.'</p>

<p>Lindbeck bubbled, 'I agree.'</p>

<p>Fred chattered, 'I seem to be the only cheerful guy here
to-day, in all this lovely autumn weather, with the maples
turning. Walter's been kicking because he can't find the right
person to put some pep in his foolish furnishing-and-decorating
department--somebody that knows the local swells with money to
spend and that has got an artistic eye for design. Don't suppose
you'd pay real money for the job, Walter?'</p>

<p>'Not at first. Twenty a week for a start, with a small
commission. But there wouldn't be any limit on the future, and
the right man, or possibly it might be a woman, might work up to
ten thousand a year or more. I'm not looking for an ex-charwoman,
or on the other hand for some tired lily that thinks he's arty.
I'd like to find some college graduate with a knowledge of the
history of art and with a lot of energy and sense . . .'</p>

<p>Fred was amused, then a trifle guilty, to see the way in which
Sara turned on Lindbeck her full flashlight:</p>

<p>'Funny you should speak of that, Mr. Lindbeck! I've always
been so interested in both painting and furniture and, in a
modest way of course, I think I know quite a little about them. I
have some ideas about decorating . . . It seems to me that people
are stupid in just using chromium and red leather and mirrors and
rounded corners, so that every room that calls itself "moderne"
looks like a caf&eacute;. I think you could take Biedermeyer
models and Duncan Phyfe motifs and modernize them so that they'd
be original, and do so many unconventional things with concealed
lighting . . .'</p>

<p>'Yes, yes, that's so. Would you like to drop into my office
to-morrow and talk with Mr. Swazey and myself?'</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>As they drove back home, Sara babbled to her parent, 'I talked
Mr. Lindbeck right into it! He had no idea I was thinking about a
job. I just talked about decoration in general, as though I
hadn't the slightest notion of going to work, and he, the poor
little man, thought it was all his own precious idea, getting me
to accept a position. I think I might like it. Decorating, in
this dull town--why, I can do it on my head, and please the
stupid plutocrats like the Praggs almost to death! Father, my
darling, you're always fussing about me, but you wouldn't have
thought of a career like this for me in a thousand years, now
would you!'</p>

<p>'That's so,' said Fred.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>For two weeks he rarely saw her, so absorbed was she in her
new job of plotting against every innocent rocker and club chair
left in town; for two weeks he had peace; but on a day just after
the two weeks' truce, he came home from the office to find Sara,
triumphant, and Hazel, very anxious, standing in the hall and
looking mysteriously into the living-room.</p>

<p>'What's all the excitement?'</p>

<p>'I tell you, he won't like it!' said Hazel.</p>

<p>'He will as soon as he gets used to it. If my own family can't
appreciate creative ideas, how can you expect anybody else to?'
said Sara.</p>

<p>'Where's the fire?' said Fred.</p>

<p>'Look at it, and don't blame me . . . It is pretty lovely
though . . . I think I'd come to like it a lot,' said Hazel,
waving her hand in the direction of the living-room and standing
aside.</p>

<p>The room had been magicked. Gone were all the pieces of
furniture that to Fred meant home and security; gone was his
sacred, rather shabby, rather faded red arm-chair, in which,
alone, the evening paper tasted right; gone the couch on which,
ritually, Hazel and he had listened to the radio side by side;
gone the Maxfield Parrish painting of maidens dancing in
twilight; gone the shiftless pile of magazines on a table with
dragons' feet clasping glass balls; gone the stuffed head of the
deer he had (illegally) shot in Quebec; gone was everything that
made home stuffy, ugly and lovable.</p>

<p>Sara had redecorated the room in plum colour and dull gold,
rich as mince pie and sombre as the thoughts of a defeated
Congressman. The furniture was dethroned Louis Quinze. And on the
walls, replacing a nest of cheerful photographs showing Hazel
with a watering pot, Fred in wading boots, complete with shotgun,
Howard with a toy wagon, and Sara reciting James Whitcomb Riley,
was one lone painting of the Towers of Rouen, which towers, taken
jointly, resembled a fish fork.</p>

<p>'Isn't it distinguished! Hasn't it real dignity!' bubbled
Sara.</p>

<p>'I didn't--I don't . . .' endeavoured Fred.</p>

<p>'It's just on trial, of course.'</p>

<p>'Well, it's certainly swell, but I don't think it quite suits
your mother and me.'</p>

<p>'Suits me, all right,' said the treacherous Hazel, all the
fanatical love of possessions in her eyes.</p>

<p>'Look, Father; if one's own people don't back you up, how can
you expect me to make a career with other people?'</p>

<p>He was warning himself, 'She's got some reason. You were
asking for it, Freddie.' He temporized, 'If I did decide I liked
the room, when I got used to it, how much would all this set me
back?'</p>

<p>'I can do it for nineteen hundred dollars, Father.'</p>

<p>'Ouch!' said Fred, but feebly, as he turned for comfort to
Hazel, saw her acquisitive glow and knew that he was sold.</p>

<p>'We-ll, I couldn't possibly pay it all in a lump.' So, for
Fredk Wm, his home was turned into a house; and a house was
easier to leave than was a home.</p>

<p> </p>

<h1>CHAPTER XXIX</h1>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>Cold ham, pineapple-and-cream-cheese salad, scalloped
potatoes, tea, beer, vanilla ice cream with caramel sauce--it was
a Cornplow family supper again, with Cornplow family food, at
Howard's flat.</p>

<p>Before supper, Howard and he had what Fred would have
called--would have called? He did call it that!--a heart-to-heart
talk, taking refuge in the bedroom from the bustling domesticity
of Hazel and Annabel and the stateliness with which Sara sat and
read the <i>New Yorker.</i></p>

<p>Not in the four and a half months since the firm of Bogey
&amp; Cornplow had been founded had they been out of the red. It
was only slightly irritating to Fred to go on contributing, but
it was disturbing to have Howard expect advice on every contract,
expect him to lure to the Bogey &amp; Cornplow office every
prosperous person Fred met in agency or club or church.</p>

<p>Howard was gushing, 'Dad, I think you'll agree with me . .
.'</p>

<p>'Rarely!'</p>

<p>'. . . that if I'm going to rent and build swell houses, I've
got to prove my standing and show my good taste . . .'</p>

<p>'Your what?'</p>

<p>'. . . by living in a nice house myself, and not in this
dump.'</p>

<p>'What d'you mean, "dump"? Wish you could've seen the four-room
shack that your mother and I had when we were first married. Only
stoves, and no bathroom, just outdoor service. I tell you, in
those days a real man was glad to shovel coal and lug the doggone
ashes, instead of just moving a lever with one finger. We had
oilcloth on the table. And,' Fred added, without great
originality, 'guess we were just about as happy as the young
folks to-day, that expect to start in where their folks left
off!'</p>

<p>'Um--yes. But I want you to look at this as an investment. I
know where I can get a dandy, up-to-date modern house, six and a
half rooms, for a hundred and ten a month, and then I can take
prospects home for dinner. I want you to understand, Dad, I've
turned over an entirely new leaf. Golly, Ben Bogey is twice as
hard on me as you or Paul Popple ever were. I don't even take a
single drink--oh, maybe just a cocktail before dinner . . .'</p>

<p>'Or maybe two?'</p>

<p>'Well, of course, if there's a dividend left in the shaker,
there's no sense wasting it . . .'</p>

<p>'Son, if you expect me to put up the hundred and ten a month
for your rent, I'm simply not going to do it, do you hear me,
won't do it, simply won't do it, do you understand, and that's
<i>flat!'</i></p>

<p>Privately, he hoped it was flat.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>All through supper Howard seemed to have the hives. He kept
winking at Annabel, clucking at her, and once he reached out and
tenderly slapped her hand. There seemed to be nothing in the
conversation to stir up such fervour. It consisted in Sara's
detailed account of wishing a bedroom in powder blue and crocus
yellow upon Mrs. Kamerkink, Howard's speculation as to whether he
could 'interest' Dr. Kamerkink in a lot at Capitola Lodge, and
Annabel's dutiful plea to Hazel for the name of her
hairdresser.</p>

<p>Yet Howard was certainly exhilarated, and after the ice cream
he pounded the table and gave tongue:</p>

<p>'I've got a very important announcement to make . . . Now,
Bell, don't blush!'</p>

<p>'I don't intend to!' said Annabel, blushing.</p>

<p>'Mother and Dad, along about next March, you are going to have
your first lovely little grandchild--and you, your first nephew,
sister!'</p>

<p>'Oh, Howard--<i>Annabel!'</i> said Hazel.</p>

<p>'Heh? Oh. You mean you're going to have a baby? Fine,' said
Fred.</p>

<p>'Yessir!' Howard roared. 'And if it's a son, and I've got a
good strong hunch it will be, I'm going to name him . . .'</p>

<p>'Heh! I'm in on this, too, aren't I? Won't I be related to the
infant?' protested Annabel.</p>

<p>'Why, yes, very much so,' said Howard. He was indulgent about
it, too.</p>

<p>'He's going to be called Little Nero, no matter what's entered
in the registry. I've always wanted to name a child "Little
Nero". It may take the curse off him.'</p>

<p>'Well now, Bell, you just forget that silly idea, and keep
your little head clear for action. But Dad and Mother, there's
another point to this announcement that I don't want you to
forget. Because now, Dad--hard luck, old man, but that's the way
life goes!--you'll have to help me make a great place in the
world for the little cuss! Your grandson!'</p>

<p>Annabel was snappish: 'I don't see why Father Cornplow should
do any such a fool thing! He's not responsible for our having
Little Nero . . .'</p>

<p>'I simply do not like that nickname, even joking.'</p>

<p>'. . . and how about your doing a little great-place-making
yourself? The Gimme Generation!'</p>

<p>'Annabel, I think this is in the worst possible taste. And at
such a moment!' Howard was stern but refined.</p>

<p>'If you couldn't find jobs . . . But, you great, big, darling,
beautiful, dumb Greek god, you and all your vintage have the
chronic gimmes.'</p>

<p>'That will do, Bell, and if it weren't for your condition . .
.'</p>

<p>'Just the gimmes, that's all; just the plain old-fashioned
gimmes!'</p>

<p>'Annabel!'</p>

<p>'And that's why I'm going to call him Little Nero, so he won't
grow up to have the gimmes too, and expect you to stick at
work--I mean, go to work--for him at seventy!'</p>

<p>'I've never heard you talk such beastly nonsense before! What
can Father and Mother Cornplow be thinking of you!' Howard turned
grandly upon his parents. 'At least, <i>you're</i> glad the baby
is coming, aren't you, Mammy?'</p>

<p>'Oh, simply delighted, dear. You mustn't mind Annabel's
teasing you a little.'</p>

<p>'Just the gimmes,' chirped that lady, so beatifically that
Fred wondered if she had sneaked in a couple of drinks before
supper. He decided that she had had no such luck. No. The sound
of Howard's mellifluous optimism, day by day, would in itself
produce spontaneous intoxication accompanied by tremor and slight
delirium.</p>

<p>'And you, Dad, you're glad too, aren't you?' insisted
Howard.</p>

<p>'Why, of course! Tickled to death. Lit--I mean, our first
little grandchild! Gracious!'</p>

<p>'Swell!' said Sara mechanically. 'But you look here, Howard.
Don't you go and get the idea you're the only one Father has to
look out for. With the good luck I've been having, I wouldn't
wonder if I didn't start a decorating shop of my own, and of
course it would have to be financed. Of course. But
congratulations and all that sort of thing on the baby.'</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>'You <i>are</i> glad about the baby, aren't you?' hinted
Hazel, back home.</p>

<p>'What baby?'</p>

<p>'Howard's baby.'</p>

<p>''Tain't Howard's baby. He's just an accident.'</p>

<p>'Well then, our coming grandchild.'</p>

<p>'Oh, I guess so. May be kind of hard on Little Nero himself .
. .'</p>

<p>'I <i>don't</i> think it's nice . . .'</p>

<p>'. . . but it will amuse Annabel, and it will be swell for
Howard. Think of what a chance he'll have now to go swelling
around being guide, philosopher and friend to the defenceless
kid! There is one thing. You know how often the pendulum swings
back to the grandparents. Maybe Little Nero will have some of our
independence, and not be a fat-head like his father.'</p>

<p>'Why, Fred! Who ever heard or imagined grandparents not being
just pleased to death at the coming of their first
grandchild!'</p>

<p>'Well, I am pleased. Don't get me wrong. Only I don't figure
on being both granddad and dad. You've read about grandchildren
that didn't spend any too much time longing to support their
grandparents, haven't you?'</p>

<p>'I suppose so.'</p>

<p>'Why shouldn't it more or less work both ways? You know Howard
darned well meant it when he hinted he expected us to drop any
personal plans we might have and stick around and nurse the royal
heir.'</p>

<p>'Ye-es.'</p>

<p>'And you know, don't you, that if we <i>do</i> stick around,
he'll probably make us do anything he wants us to--there not
being any more powerful influence on God's green earth than the
smile that wins, when it's got a bottom layer of good, sticky
self-approval. He'll be too strong for us, and too dumb. So we
better not stick around. Ain't there something to what I say?
Ain't there?'</p>

<p>'Um--anyway, it really is a little too much, expecting you to
support four generations.'</p>

<p>'How d' you mean?'</p>

<p>'You helped your father pay off his mortgage when you were a
travelling man, didn't you? And you helped your sister start her
dressmaking business . . .'</p>

<p>'How that would grind Putnam Staybridge! Aristocratic to wear
swell dresses, but low-class to make 'em.'</p>

<p>'And you certainly have always supported your own self since
you were a brat--and I'll bet you were a brat, too! No, I don't
bet any such thing. I bet you were a cute baby.'</p>

<p>'I don't know about when I was a baby, but 'long 'bout
six-seven, I was such a fat, sweet-looking kid, with long curls,
that I had to lick the everlastin' daylights out of about one
neighbouring kid per day, to keep my standing. Golly--I hope Sara
don't come in on us, but that certainly does feel better.'</p>

<p>They were on the new settee in the living-room, the radio
turned on so low that it emitted only a background of music, like
wind in the trees, but amid all this refinement, Fred had
sighingly removed his shoes.</p>

<p>'Well, you and your sister make a second generation you've
supported. And you certainly saw Howard and Sara through
everything. And now, apparently, Howard expects you to be
responsible for this fourth generation--Little Nero. It's a
little too much.'</p>

<p>'Maybe that's so,' and Fred looked upon her with such
lovelight in his eyes as not even eighteen holes in seventy-five
could have set there. 'I wouldn't mind supporting Little Nero. I
just hate to think about his being brought up to correct all my
breaks.'</p>

<p>'Well, if Little Nero is really <i>our</i> sort, he'd rather
have a high-stepping, jolly, independent old grandfather than a
reservoir!'</p>

<p>That night, remembering Howard's old contention that he was
fast in the handcuffs of routine, Fred so far flaunted the ritual
of fetishism as to throw his shirt on the floor instead of, as
was his compulsion, hanging it smoothly over his coat on the back
of the one habitual chair.</p>

<p>Hazel picked it up. She supposed that it was a shirt that had
been flung down, and not the strait-jacket of timidity.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<h1>CHAPTER XXX</h1>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>All his life until now, night had been to Frederick William
Cornplow only a blank of sleep. Even as a travelling salesman,
thirty years ago, waiting at vile junction depots till after
midnight or snoozing on bumpy branch trains, though he might have
had but six hours' sleep, it had been profound.</p>

<p>Now he took worries to bed with him; they cuddled up beside
him when he retired, then laughed and bit him. As long as he
tried to lie still, he went tediously over and over his
frets:</p>

<p>Howard's extravagance; the probability that he would not
support Little Nero and the certainty that he would grieve young
Annabel.</p>

<p>Sara's new job, in which she would spare him and his
pocketbook no more than she would spare herself.</p>

<p>Hazel's alternation between miserly pride in adornment and a
desire to see what the world was like.</p>

<p>Paul Popple's reluctance to take authority at the agency. The
wonder whether, if he left them to themselves, Paul and Howard
would be forced to become dependable, or simply break.</p>

<p>Always, his own timidity and his meagre learning.</p>

<p>Worst of all, the neighbourhood opinion which kept him a
steady and commonplace little citizen: the opinion of Dr.
Kamerkink, Ed Appletree, the lawyer, even of Walter Lindbeck,
that he would be a fool to do anything save settle inoffensively
into old age. He saw that most of us do what most of the people
about us mostly expect us to do, become brave or criminal or
both, and he knew definite fear of the compulsion upon him to
remain safe and dreary, a compulsion which could be escaped only
by running away.</p>

<p>Running where? For what?</p>

<p>But when he sprang up from bed, scoffing at the need of sleep,
then night became an adventure; sometimes wry, sometimes
dismaying, always an excitement. He sat trying not to disturb
Hazel, or he crept down to make coffee for himself and to sit
brooding at the kitchen table.</p>

<p>He longed for Stonefield and the cottage William Tyler
Longwhale. That elopement had proved that he could get along, be
amused, without the crutch of daily industriousness which his
friends so recommended.</p>

<p>Hazel was conscious of his rebellion and sometimes cocked a
drowsy eye at him as he crept out of the room, but she guessed
that he wanted to be left alone. Sara was conscious of it--she
was a night prowler herself--but for a time he avoided her
probing.</p>

<p>In this unearthly second life he didn't always brood.
Sometimes he read, soaked himself in the oddest magazine articles
and in books stolen from Sara's shelves: articles about Javanese
coffee culture, dialects in Burma, the roof of Ely Cathedral,
Cycling in Tanganyika with Notes on Hotels in Dar es Salaam. He
laid the magazine down to dream out one-dimensioned pictures
woven of coloured cloud: Pike's Peak in the sun, bell towers of
Bruges, himself playing the piano in an English cottage, himself
chatty at the counter of the general store in Stonefield, with
Hazel gaily clattering pans in the kitchen.</p>

<p>Most embarrassing of all were the nights when he did not lie
awake, when the worries treacherously let him go to sleep, then
woke him jeeringly at three o'clock or four or five.</p>

<p>It was cold downstairs then, even when it wasn't cold.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>This November morning, at four-thirty, he knew that he was
caught and would not sleep again until an hour at which a
responsible man would be brightly awakening.</p>

<p>He bundled himself up grotesquely: sweater as well as
dressing-gown, with an old golf stocking about his neck. The
house was so still that it was noisy with creeping burglars. He
looked out of a window and shivered. The street was bitterly
empty; the pavements, and a fire plug that should have been a
lively red but was now grey, seemed lonely.</p>

<p>He sat in the kitchen, at the metal-topped table, an illicit
cup of coffee and a folder showing the Australian airlines before
him. He startled at distant shuffling feet, the creak of the
swing door between dining-room and butler's pantry. He beamed
with comfort as Sara's face, sharpened with weariness, came
peering at him.</p>

<p>She smiled, and she sounded genial:</p>

<p>'Why, you disreputable old tramp! Couldn't you sleep? Neither
could I.'</p>

<p>Sara tucked the ridiculous golf stocking in about his neck,
she clucked at him and kissed his ear. She seemed more truly his
little girl than since she had been a lanky child. She sat
opposite him, chin in hand, and said softly, 'This insomnia is
the worst idea I ever met. I've got some little pills for it.
Don't you want some?'</p>

<p>'No indeed.'</p>

<p>'But you've got to sleep!'</p>

<p>'Why? What's the difference, as long as you get rest? The need
for sleep is kind of a superstition. I enjoy breaking up my old
routine. And besides, I don't want to get this little pill
habit.'</p>

<p>'Mine aren't habit-forming, not a bit.'</p>

<p>'But the habit of taking them, of depending on taking anything
at all to make you sleep, is habit-forming. Don't get to depend
on it, sweetie.'</p>

<p>The whole hour, the empty hour that was neither night nor day,
seemed to him strange as Sara's abnormal kindness. He was too
listless for self-defence, and thus was he betrayed into
honesty.</p>

<p>Sara hinted, a little more sharply:</p>

<p>'Curious, you, of all people, can't sleep. Worried,
Father?'</p>

<p>'No, not exactly.'</p>

<p>'I noticed you were reading a lot of travel stuff . . . Do you
still want to retire and go places?'</p>

<p>'Maybe. Sort of.'</p>

<p>'But you wouldn't really go to Europe, would you, or some
other place far off from us?'</p>

<p>'Well, thunder, if you're going to make a break, might's well
make a good one. No particular novelty for me, going out to the
club for golf!'</p>

<p>'It'd be fierce for me if you did go away, Father; especially
if Mother went, too.'</p>

<p>'Why?'</p>

<p>'Oh, Howard would think he was head of the family and the
boss, then, and he's such a dope! I suppose Annabel is all right,
but Howard's one of these curly-headed boys. He's the kind that
reads books about How to Sell, and gets so busy rushing out and
selling that he never takes time to find out what he's going to
sell.'</p>

<p>'But why do you worry so? You're smart enough. You're making a
go of this decoration thing.'</p>

<p>'But if I start my own shop, I'd never get away with it
without your help.'</p>

<p>'Then why start it? You got a good boss in Walter
Lindbeck.'</p>

<p>'Yes, he's kind of a nice little man. But . . . Probably I
wouldn't bare my throbbing little heart if it weren't such an
ungodly hour, but I don't always want to be a lone spinster, and
between us, as man to man, I don't seem to click with the boys,
except rootless freaks like Gene Silga, curse him!'</p>

<p>'I suppose Gene was sort of on the free-love side.'</p>

<p>'And how! And theoretically, I agree. I never did think much
of getting caged up with a man you've hardly been introduced to!
But practically, I guess I've got too much Cornplow and Jenkins
in me, doggone it . . . Heavens! I'm talking just like you!'</p>

<p>'What's the matter with talking like me? I always do!'</p>

<p>'Not always, darling. Sometimes you forget yourself and become
quite literate.'</p>

<p>'Well, I did more or less go to college, and recent years,
I've been brought up on luncheon-club oratory: "Fellow members,
real and enduring prosperity lies in the abandonment of the
antiquated ethic of every guy for himself." I have got some
vocabulary, but mostly I leave it up in the attic, with the
trunks.'</p>

<p>'Of course you have. But, Father, I wonder if you're really
and truly quite on to yourself? If you'd still like to go off and
be a hobo . . .'</p>

<p>'I would!'</p>

<p>'But why don't you face it as you would a business problem?
Suppose you were in a European hotel, where almost every guest
was a globe-trotter. You'd feel as out of place as a stray pup.
Oh, I know you have worries; you've always worked so hard. In
fact, I have an idea you're more exhausted than Mother or even
you suspect. You don't know how I've been watching you. But it
wouldn't be any remedy to go roaming. That's hard work for
anybody that isn't used to it. I wish you'd just relax and rest.
I wish you'd get help from somebody who understands these things.
I wish you'd get well!'</p>

<p>'Now what the . . . Get well from <i>what?</i> What's supposed
to be my fatal sickness?'</p>

<p>'This insomnia. All this fretting about Howard and me. And--do
let me say it, Father, in all friendliness--this crazy
restlessness. The idea that you'd enjoy wandering, or taking up
some hobby that you're too old to start on. Please! I don't think
you're selfish in being willing to leave us flat--not entirely
selfish, at least; I won't even say it's utterly absurd; but I do
think you fool yourself. If instead of riding off in all
directions at once, like Leacock's hero, you would relax and go
to some place where the doctors are accustomed to advise people
and help them to get into shape . . .'</p>

<p>Fred was angry now:</p>

<p>'"Get in shape"! "Get well"! Good Lord, girl! I've been told
there are wives who believe that any husband who doesn't
absolutely slave himself to death for the little woman is a dirty
traitor, and ought to have his head examined by the docs. Now
looks as though wives are getting over that notion, and the
children are taking it up. By golly, I thought the younger
generation during Prohibition was bad enough--the generation of
Flaming Gin--but I swear they were better than the present Youth,
that despise their folks if they forget a quotation they haven't
looked at these thirty years, or if they think they got just as
much right to travel and buy clothes with their own money as
their kids have and . . . I couldn't get your switching from Red
Radicalism to Society Upholstering, but now I see you're
consistent: in both cases, you think that the world was born in
1917, and everything we thought we knew or we thought we were
doing before then was idiotic. Well, let me tell you . . .'</p>

<p>'Father, have you had a drink of liquor this morning?'</p>

<p>It was almost a knockout, but he rallied.</p>

<p>'I have not, and you know it.'</p>

<p>'Well, certainly you'd never talk in such a wild, senseless,
exaggerated way if you really were <i>well.</i> And this insomnia
of yours . . .'</p>

<p>'Got it yourself, ain't you?'</p>

<p>'With me, it's different. I'm a creative artist.'</p>

<p>'And I suppose I'm just a pedlar!'</p>

<p>'You used the word, dear! I didn't!'</p>

<p>'Oh, Sara, don't let's scrap! You almost seemed like my girl,
to-night, when you came in first. You're too young to understand
that old codgers like me can change, too--a few of us--and push
out old habits with a set of new ones--same as when I get to
humming a tune till it bores me, I start another tune to chase it
out.'</p>

<p>'That's curious! That's practically what Dr. George Janissary
says--you know, the famous psychiatrist--I met him once at
dinner, when I lived in New York. You sounded like him--for a
moment, I mean.'</p>

<p>'Huh! These mind doctors, like Friend Janissary, haven't
patented psychology and mental hygiene, have they? I guess Ben
Franklin and Voltaire and Dickens must have known something!'</p>

<p>'Father, you wouldn't think I was too rude . . .'</p>

<p>'Prob'ly would!'</p>

<p>'. . . if I pointed out that you're not Franklin or Voltaire?
Honestly, the help a man like Dr. Janissary could give you in
re-education, by constructive personal conferences . . .'</p>

<p>'I don't know the gent. Maybe he might re-educate me into
being some kind of a tabby cat I wouldn't want to be. Yes,
there's something I am getting well from, all right: from
crawling along through life and being doped by routine. But
Howard and you never thought that was a disease. You thought it
was pretty convenient for you!'</p>

<p>'Oh, Father, to talk like that--if Dr. Janissary heard
you!--to make us out monsters . . .'</p>

<p>'You're not, of course. But neither am I. We're just normal
people, up to the oldest trick in the world: nagging your
relatives for nagging you. I didn't want to be rude, girl. But
get right over this idea you can coax me out of my idea of
turning myself from a Parent into a Human Being. Good
night--uh--good morning!'</p>

<p>So Fred clumped up to bed, with the intention of lying awake
to lick his parental wounds, and went to sleep blissfully and at
once.</p>

<p>Belowstairs, Sara was still in the kitchen, vowing, 'His idea
of leaving us in the lurch--it's insane--it's beastly--and now
I've got to do something about it!'</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<h1>CHAPTER XXXI</h1>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>There is no way in which a normally stubborn husband can more
fruitfully surprise and annoy his loved ones than by being a
'good patient', which means a man who brightly agrees with the
family doctor even when the doctor isn't sure that he agrees with
himself.</p>

<p>Another technical phrase that goes along with 'good patient'
is 'worried about his health', and it happened to Fredk Wm now
that his wife decided to be worried about his health.</p>

<p>'Don't you think you ought to go to Dr. Kamerkink and have a
general physical overhauling?' she said, on a beautifully
Saraless evening.</p>

<p>He had watched her nervously approaching this bold position by
way of chatter about a respected neighbour who, at eighty-one,
probably from gross over-use of coffee, alcohol, tobacco and
attendance on baseball games, had astounded the community by
popping off. So Fred was ready for the attack and able to be
genial:</p>

<p>'Why?'</p>

<p>'Oh, no special reason. I just think everybody past fifty
ought to look after his health.'</p>

<p>'But not before fifty?'</p>

<p>'Wellofcoursebutimean . . .'</p>

<p>'My state of health been bothering anybody lately?'</p>

<p>'No, but . . .'</p>

<p>'Pains in the back, dizziness, sudden loss of memory, B.O.,
athlete's foot? Do they laugh when I say I can speak French?
Won't my best friends tell me? Delusions of persecution? Violent
and unexpected assault on man believed to be income-tax
collector?'</p>

<p>'Don't be so silly!'</p>

<p>'Comrade Sara been hinting I'm losing grip--unable to see
smart decorator's shop as an investment?'</p>

<p>'Well, she is a little worried. So am I!'</p>

<p>'What's the matter with old Fred?'</p>

<p>'You know you don't sleep right.'</p>

<p>'If I can get along without sleep--and all through the ages
people been kicking because that's the worst waste of time there
is--then I must be in swell shape!'</p>

<p>'I wish you would have Lafe Kamerkink look you over. Please
do.'</p>

<p>'All right. I will.'</p>

<p>'When?'</p>

<p>'Next Saturday.'</p>

<p>'I'll be hanged!' she said, unprophetically but with the most
gratifying astonishment.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>After the usual assaults and embarrassments which doctors call
an examination, Dr. Kamerkink illustrated the advance of
medicine, and proved that he had kept up, by grunting:</p>

<p>'You'll have to take a basal-metabolism test, and I want a
blood count.'</p>

<p>'All right.'</p>

<p>Kamerkink looked suspicious. He was certain that Fred had
something up his sleeve.</p>

<p>'I said I want a B.M.R.'</p>

<p>'Whatever it is, I'm for it.'</p>

<p>'For a B.M.R., I want to have it taken after twelve-fourteen
hours' complete rest, without food and even without your smoking
a cigarette.'</p>

<p>'O.K.'</p>

<p>'I wouldn't trust you to do that at home.'</p>

<p>'Neither would I.'</p>

<p>'So you'll have to spend a night in a hospital.'</p>

<p>'O.K.'</p>

<p>Dr. Kamerkink was overwhelmed. Was Fred concealing a flask, or
drugs, or a revolver? Never in these years of acquaintanceship
had Fred given him any reason to suppose that he could be so
abnormal as to act like a sane and normal patient. Doubtfully,
wondering when he would find the trick in it, Dr. Kamerkink
telephoned to engage Fred's room in the hospital and lighted a
cigarette, prefatory to telling Fred about cutting down the
cigarettes.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>Fred liked his hospital room. He had declined Hazel's company
and all offers of flowers and depressingly cheerful bedside
books. It was refreshing to have, without the penalty of pain,
this simple room that was pictureless, pinkless and
candlewick-spreadless, and that falsely seemed to get itself
cleaned with none of the horrors of hiring maids, seeing that
they were transported to the movies and otherwise entertained,
and listening to the whine of their vacuum cleaners. The better
rooms in heaven must be automatic cells like this, he
thought.</p>

<p>They did let him undress himself and get into his fine small
high bed without tender helping hands. The one thing he had
feared, in contemplating this adventure, had been that with
mocking jeers some pretty young nurse would snatch his protective
clothes away and show him up as just a skinned rabbit. But he
certainly had no intention, he assured himself, of missing any of
his opportunity to be waited on.</p>

<p>Hazel was fond enough of him, but Hazel wouldn't think at all
well of bringing him cooling fruit juices all evening, and extra
pillows, of smoothing the bedclothes if he was such a fool as to
keep on violently turning over, or of listening to his oldest
jokes, as did the floor nurse who--usually--answered the bell
this evening.</p>

<p>He thought it was a splendid idea to have a call bell on the
end of a cord, hanging beside his head. He wanted to introduce it
at home, though he had the sanity to admit that he didn't know
what would happen if he pressed it with any idea that it would
influence Hedgar the Hun.</p>

<p>He had heard (though he was to discover that the tale was
false, and told only to make the narrator seem heroic) that in
taking a basal-metabolism test he would find it difficult to
breathe, and he had every intention of enjoying himself by lying
awake and worrying about it. But in the pleasure of not having to
wonder whether Howard would call up, late, or wonder at what time
Sara would be coming home, he forgot about being insomniac, fell
sweetly asleep at ten and awoke in daylight to find a keen young
woman in white wheeling into his room what resembled a trench
mortar polished up for the use of the crown prince.</p>

<p>The floor nurse was chirping at Fred with the sugared
cheerfulness reserved for children, manic-depressives and
patients, 'This is the technician.'</p>

<p>Fred had time only to note that he ought to look into this
fact that all hospital technicians were beautiful before the lady
pinched his nose with a glorified clothespin and fitted over his
amazed and protesting mouth a rubber apparatus through which, she
told him coolly, he was to breathe.</p>

<p>That breathing, it seemed, caused a polished plunger to rise
up and down in the trench mortar. Instantly scared, but resolved
to be gallant, he enjoyed fighting against choking, his body
tense, his breath labouring. But he discovered that he was merely
making things hard for himself. He quit being gallant and
energetic, and therewith the breathing was as natural as though
he stood on a hilltop, free of rubber gadgets and hospital
beds.</p>

<p>'Good man! That's fine,' said the technician.</p>

<p>He was to treasure that commendation along with the highest
distinctions he had known in life; with the letter from the
president of the Duplex company saying that his agency had the
best credit in the East; with the admission of the golf
professional that he had a fairly accurate swing; with the sigh
of a very young Hazel that he had been so nice to her father;
with his election as vice-president of the Boosters' Club; and
with the remark of his professor of rhetoric, back in Truxon,
that his essay on The Character of Portia hadn't been bad at
all.</p>

<p>He was still in the glow of this honour, and the rubber mask
had been removed, when the technician, taking his hand tenderly,
turned savage and jabbed into his finger a needle stuck in a
cork.</p>

<p>'Ouch!' he wailed in protest.</p>

<p>It was true that it hadn't hurt, but he felt that the
principle was very bad. Then he was asleep, before he could do
anything about it; and he awoke to a tray of ham and eggs, and to
Dr. Kamerkink by the bed, saying suspiciously, 'Why, there
doesn't seem to be one darn thing the matter with you!'</p>

<p>'But did they look at your teeth and tonsils, too?' said Sara
when, at home, Fred crowed over his superiority.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<center>
<h1>CHAPTER XXXII</h1>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>In all innocence and glee, Fred was playing poker at the
residence of his friend and lawyer, Edward McTavish Appletree,
and the conversation was hearty with humour:</p>

<p>'By me.' 'I'll whoop you two.' Knock, knock. 'What're you
trying to do with that hooch, Ed--save it for your
grandchildren?'</p>

<p>But he was also present, though not physically, in his own
house, where Hazel, Sara, Howard, Annabel and Dr. Kamerkink were
sitting as comfortably as possible, which wasn't very
comfortably, on Louis Quinze. Sara was holding forth:</p>

<p>'You may think I'm absolutely silly, maybe a little
melodramatic, in asking you to meet, but we've really got to be
serious and practical. I don't mean Father is the least bit
insane, of course, but I do feel he's got some pretty queer ideas
that might make him do things that, afterward, he'd be the first
to regret.'</p>

<p>'Oh, come down to cases. What's so queer?' fretted Hazel.</p>

<p>'These ideas about going off and being some kind of a John
Ruskin, wandering around Europe studying art. Father's one of the
dearest, most dependable men living--or at least he has been--but
even you, Mother, have got to admit that he can never be anything
except a completely unimaginative small-city merchant; and with
all affection, we ought to keep him from making himself
ridiculous.'</p>

<p>They spoke together:</p>

<p>'Only one of the whole lot of us that <i>has</i> imagination!'
from Annabel.</p>

<p>'I think there's a lot to what Sara says,' from Howard.</p>

<p>'He's never even pretended he wanted to go Ruskin-ing around
Europe,' from Hazel.</p>

<p>'His euphoria does kind of puzzle me,' from Dr. Kamerkink.</p>

<p>'His what? Is that one of these things you take this to your
druggist now and he'll fill it, take three times daily just
before meals?' from Annabel.</p>

<p>'Euphoria. State of gaiety and well-being. I don't,' said the
doctor resentfully, 'see what the dickens Fred has got to be
cheerful about!'</p>

<p>Sara took over the debate again:</p>

<p>'I don't want to be an alarmist. I suppose Father is perfectly
all right, really. But you all know of cases where a man who has
been a reliable husband and father has suddenly gone haywire, and
at just about Father's age, and started gambling or drinking or
chasing women, and left his family . . .'</p>

<p>('With all their gimmes,' murmured Annabel.)</p>

<p>'. . . unprovided for. Of course Father has built up a good
business, but you know what can happen to any business, these
days, if the responsible head starts neglecting it. So far as I
know, the only real safeguard any of his family has is Father's
fifty-thousand-dollar life insurance. Now I'm the last person in
the world to be grasping or dependent. I belong to the new race
of women who want to carve out their own destinies, but at the
same time, I have to make a start. It's not my fault if I have to
have lots more training before I can achieve a great position and
get my own shop. I'm simply not going to let Father let me down!
Considering that we are, after all, the only people that Father
depends on, if we stick together, he'll just have to give up any
ideas of ditching us . . . And of course Howard's career also, I
suppose, and your child coming, Annabel.'</p>

<p>('Howard, is this true? Why didn't you tell me?')</p>

<p>('Oh, shut up, Bell.')</p>

<p>('Do you belong to the new race of men, beautiful?')</p>

<p>'Now I'm sure Dr. Kamerkink will back me up in saying that the
comparatively new science of psychiatry has developed to a point
where they can cure a twisted mind just as they cure a twisted
foot, and I happen to know slightly the most wonderful
psychiatrist in New York: Dr. George Janissary. His patients look
up to him with absolute reverence--and, mind you, they're not a
bunch of hysterical spinsters, but a lot of them are brokers and
engineers and college professors and doctors, too. Why, ever so
many of them come back to him every year.'</p>

<p>Annabel snorted: 'If a doctor cured my twisted foot but I had
to go back every year, I'd think he was a bum untwister.'</p>

<p>'For heaven's sake, Annabel, will you please permit <i>me,</i>
at least, to be serious?'</p>

<p>('Butting in again . . . Gimmes.' Annabel's mutter was like
the muted bark of a small dog that has been told to dry up.)</p>

<p>'I ventured to talk over all this with Dr. Janissary when I
was in New York on my last buying trip, and he says it would be a
cinch--very common psychosis, mild delusions of grandeur--and he
says he can easily guide Father into getting well.'</p>

<p>Through it all, though she had not glibly interrupted like
Annabel, Hazel had looked shocked. She stammered now, 'B-but did
this doctor make a diagnosis just from what you told him?'</p>

<p>'After all, a daughter, and living right in the same house
with her father, ought to understand him, if she's reasonably
intelligent.'</p>

<p>('If!' from Annabel.)</p>

<p>Hazel struggled on, 'I'm perfectly certain you're wrong. I've
never known your father clearer-headed.'</p>

<p>'But you'll admit, Mother, it wouldn't hurt Father to
<i>see</i> Dr. Janissary? Weren't you glad when he had his
general physical examination?'</p>

<p>'Ye-es . . . though he did crow so, afterwards!'</p>

<p>'And what do you think, Doctor?'</p>

<p>Dr. Kamerkink said benignly, 'Well, I don't suppose it would
hurt Fred any, though I certainly don't see any need,' but he
barely got it out, so vigorously did Hazel take over the
conference:</p>

<p>'Sara! Listen to me for a moment--even if I am only your
mother! Strikes me this all comes down to how honest a man your
Janissary person is. I'm not so behind-the-times that I don't
know that psychiatry, or however you pronounce it, does do
wonders; helps ever so many people get straight what it is that's
worrying them. But to a lot of folks, and I confess I'm one of
'em, it still seems a little like magic, and if they depended on
a psychiatrist that was money-grabbing, and if they thought he
was an all-powerful medicine man, wouldn't it be dangerous? Seems
to me I have heard about American women going to Europe and
getting into the clutches of fancy psychologists . . .'</p>

<p>('With whiskers!')</p>

<p>'. . . that got them all confused and milked 'em.'</p>

<p>'Foreigners? Yes, possibly. Foreigners are often crooked. But
Dr. Janissary is a real American. And he speaks five languages
and plays the violin and goes trout fishing.'</p>

<p>'The fishing part sounds fine,' said Dr. Kamerkink.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<center>
<h1>CHAPTER XXXIII</h1>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>Fred was flattered to a point of grinning when Sara invited
him to accompany her to New York City on a buying trip for Swazey
&amp; Lindbeck. He accepted with zeal and with the notion that he
would show the little girl a thing or two: the best restaurant in
New York, and how a real salesman could order. He swallowed her
statement that she wanted the aid of his common sense in buying
furniture for game rooms--those assemblages of pool tables, card
tables, private bars, and grills for cooking chops which were
decidedly the thing in Sachem domestic architecture. But on the
train she so buttered his good taste that, remembering the Louis
Quinze into whose chill lap he had been enticed, he became
suspicious.</p>

<p>In the city he was so lulled by the toe-tapping music of 'Kiss
Me Quick', so youthfully enchanted by an Italian caf&eacute; and
by memories of the Paris boulevards which he had never seen, that
he trusted her as though she were not a relative, and he agreed
gaily, next morning, when she invited, 'Come along with me, will
you? I want you to meet such a nice man.'</p>

<p>Their taxicab stopped at an uptown apartment house. A chaste
bronze sign in the lobby announced that the Janissary Sanatorium
occupied Floors 7-10 Incl. &amp; Roof. Still was he gullible . .
. Some pleasant man living upstairs whom Sara had known in New
York days, or met in this decoration game? . . . Would he be
married? Oh, surely . . . Would he have a handsome flat? . . .
Would he offer Fred a drink, and would Fred take it, so early in
the day? . . . Probably!</p>

<p>They entered a room which didn't in the least suggest a
friendly flat, nor yet a drink. At first, indeed, it suggested
nothing whatever to Fred except quantities of money. It seemed to
be a combination of a baronial hall in the North Riding, an
operating room, and a beauty parlour in Hollywood. On either side
of a high oak Tudor fireplace were oak thrones, but at one end of
the room, modestly, was a young woman in a white uniform at a
desk of white-enamelled metal, with a glass top, uncomfortably
hinting of surgical knives. And the lulling voice with which she
sang 'Your names, <i>if</i> you please!' wafted the sweet fumes
of ether.</p>

<p>They waited ten minutes.</p>

<p>'What the deuce are you up to?' protested the aroused Fredk
Wm.</p>

<p>'I wanted you to meet Dr. George Janissary, the
psychiatrist--the grandest man--you'll love him.'</p>

<p>'I doubt it. Somehow this shack he's got here don't seem to
rouse any stirrings of love. Psychiatrist? Mind doc?'</p>

<p>'You appreciate them, don't you?'</p>

<p>'Of course. For those that need 'em. I don't. I also don't
need a chiropodist or an aviator.'</p>

<p>They argued in the most spirited manner, those ten minutes.
Sara asserted that it was handy for almost anybody to drop in on
his psychiatrist now and then, and find out what phobias,
schizophrenic reactions, paranoid behaviours, or
obsessive-compulsive neuroses he might have developed this past
week. Fred said that, in his experience, if your carburetor is
working right, don't let any mechanic monkey with it.</p>

<p>He could not have been expected to know that, in a
psychologist's or a psychiatrist's office, the only person who is
ever permitted to say 'in my experience' is the healer.</p>

<p>They were admitted then to the friendly presence of George
Carlyon Janissary, B.A., M.A., M.D., L.H.D.; and Fred, who had
come to expect a point-headed wizard in a black gown sprinkled
with crimson stars, was relieved. Dr. Janissary was a jolly,
tweedish, sporting, lanky gentleman, with a long red moustache
and sun-browned hands. He smelled of heather, good pipe tobacco
and the best soap; he shook hands merrily and spoke in
baritone:</p>

<p>'I don't really know why you're here, Brother Cornplow, but
Miss Sara seems to have some kind of an idea that I might be able
to advise you on how to get the most fun out of your
retiring--great idea, retiring; majority of us keep our noses to
the grindstone too long. Just as you might advise me about buying
an automobile.'</p>

<p>This was fine.</p>

<p>Fred beamed. Sara beamed. Dr. Janissary beamed more than twice
as much as both of them put together. But he somewhat less
suggested golf courses and the fishing camp on the Ouareau River
as he reached for a handful of filing cards and demanded: 'What
was the date of your birth?'</p>

<p>'What was the calling of your father--his father--his mother's
father--their financial condition?'</p>

<p>'What do you believe to be your ambition in life?'</p>

<p>'Do you usually consider yourself passionate or frigid by
nature?'</p>

<p>'Have you any hobby--any interest outside of making money and
caring for your family?'</p>

<p>Till this point, Fred had been too hypnotized to do anything
but answer meekly, and inadequately, but he shook himself
loose:</p>

<p>'Say, what's the idea of all this, anyway? Sara, have you
signed up for my giving a lecture on my life and adventures? And
who pays who for it?'</p>

<p>Dr. Janissary did not think this was in the least funny--for
that matter, Fred didn't think it was so very funny himself.</p>

<p>The doctor was grave and warning:</p>

<p>'Mr. Cornplow, from what Sara has told me and from what I have
already observed, it is clear that you have lost grip--oh, just
the least bit; nothing that can't readily be corrected by
psychobiologic re-education. Lost grip on your personal affairs.
Don't be frightened.'</p>

<p>'I'm not!'</p>

<p>'That's splendid. It happens to the most competent men of
affairs, sometimes, from exhaustion and worry. I'm quite sure
that your hallucination about being an explorer is temporary.
Quite a satisfactory prognosis, I should think. Your only real
danger is the practical one that in your state . . .'</p>

<p><i>'My state?'</i></p>

<p>'. . . you might be led into extravagances that would
dissipate your entire small fortune. But of course, my dear
fellow, you're not even sure that you want us to do our modest
best for you, as yet. Do let me show you our place here--our
"plant" you would no doubt call it.'</p>

<p>Fred had swung between amusement and exasperation till now,
but he found nothing amusing at all in the four floors and roof
which made up the sanatorium. The bedrooms, though small, were
bright enough with red-and-yellow upholstery, and there were no
bars on the windows, but the corridors smelled of drugs, and he
saw a male attendant, a shaved gorilla, standing in a niche,
watchfully looking up and down a corridor--up and down, with
surly slowness. His forearms, revealed by the cut-off sleeves of
his white jacket, were strong and horribly well scrubbed.</p>

<p>Half a floor was given over to the workshop activities which
Dr. Janissary called Occupational Therapy, Dr. Kamerkink called
Hobbies, and the untutored Fred Cornplow called Tinkering. There
was apparatus for basket making, model-boat making, carpentry and
knitting, and there, most busily knitting, was, to Fred's
embarrassment, an aged gentleman with a white beard.</p>

<p>'Knitting?' said Fred.</p>

<p>'Yes, it's so soothing. Very recreational. Last year we had an
ex-United States senator here, seventy years old, and he knitted
a sweater for his wife.'</p>

<p>'What she do with it? Give it to her gigolo or to the
Salvation Army?' said Fred.</p>

<p>In the light of Sara's look of affliction, Janissary's look of
pain, he warned himself he was nothing but an upstate hick and
mustn't annoy these sophisticates with his rustic American jeers.
He wanted to, but didn't, ask whether men patients got well
because they knitted, or got sick in the first place because they
were the kind that would knit.</p>

<p>He fell into low humour once more when Dr. Janissary had
showed them the roof of the building, which he called the
'recreational garden'. As a garden, it wasn't so much, thought
Fred. Besides the gravelled roofing, parallel bars and a few
deck-chairs, forlorn under December sky, it exhibited no
entertaining features save a view of the Hudson and a brewery
across it, and a high woven-wire fence. Before Fred could check
his unfortunate humour, he had demanded, 'What's fence for? Keep
the nuts from jumping off?'</p>

<p>Dr. Janissary did not answer, but so queerly did he glance at
Sara that Fred felt boorish. He looked about the roof, trying to
think of something agreeable to say.</p>

<p>A few feet behind him, the same male attendant was standing,
rigid, his arms folded.</p>

<p>(Now the truth is that the attendant was not following Fred.
He had sneaked up to the roof for an illegal cigarette. But it is
a principle known to soldiers that it is as bad to be frightened
to death as it is to be killed.)</p>

<p>As they descended from the roof, Sara said, and her tone was
infuriatingly kind and maternal. 'Now don't you think that's a
lovely fresh-air nook?'</p>

<p>'A <i>nook!'</i> was all that Fred could get out.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>He really spoke up when they were back in Dr. Janissary's
office:</p>

<p>'Well, Doctor, I'm glad to have seen your shop. I'm sure you
could do a lot for people who are disturbed and puzzled. But I
hope you don't think any of this is for me! Nosir! Well, Sara,
let's skip back to the hotel.'</p>

<p>But Dr. Janissary would not let him go. Presumably there was
no law by which he could force Fred to sit there, sweating, yet
Fred felt as though a couple of deputies stood behind his chair,
ready to spring, while the doctor said amiably:</p>

<p>'I'm afraid you're not entirely original or unusual, Mr.
Cornplow, in thinking that while we could do something for the
other fellow, you're too clear-headed and self-analytical for us
to do anything for <i>you.</i> What we strive for here chiefly,
perhaps, is to train our friends to understand themselves. People
have so many blind spots in their mental steering vision.'</p>

<p>Bluntly, 'You got any blind spots, too, Doc?'</p>

<p>He felt slightly astonished that Janissary neither hit him nor
called for handcuffs, but merely hesitated, 'Oh yes--yes, of
course.'</p>

<p>'So we can call it quits, eh, Doc?' (Within, 'Why can't you be
refined with these highbrows, Fred, and not try to jolly 'em the
way you would Cal Tillery?') 'Because I certainly hope neither
you nor Sara have any idea I'd ever let myself be cooped up here
and have somebody try to "do some constructive psychiatric work"
with me, as I believe you call it.'</p>

<p>Dr. Janissary did not, thereafter, sound so tolerant as one
would have expected in a teacher of toleration:</p>

<p>'About your condition, my dear Mr. Cornplow . . .' ('I'll be
everlastingly doggoned if I'll let any doggone man say I've got a
"condition"!') '. . . there can be no question whatever. You are
suffering from disassociation and a toxic condition probably due
to drug escapism. And, to scotch one of the commonest lay errors,
no one can do anything permanent by the use of his own so-called
"will power". You need the help of trained experts.'</p>

<p>'You mean nobody at all can get in shape by his own will
power?'</p>

<p>'Oh, there are apparent exceptions.'</p>

<p>'And maybe I'm an exception! And maybe there's more'n you
think. Because sensible people don't worry too much about
worrying. And maybe a lot of 'em steer clear of you. So, Sara,
let's beat it.'</p>

<p>'Mr. Cornplow, let me say, in this amiable parting, that in a
way I agree with you in your own diagnosis.'</p>

<p>'Eh? What's wrong with it, then?'</p>

<p>'I wouldn't consider taking your case useless I had complete
authority--which I'm afraid you wouldn't agree to, as you suffer
from the very common complaint of thinking you know as much as
the doctor!--unless you agreed to stay under control for, at the
least, six months.'</p>

<p>'Six . . . Sara! We're going.'</p>

<p>He had no farewell for the doctor. In the reception room, the
white-clad secretary said tenderly, 'It will be one hundred
dollars for the consultation, please, and if you don't mind, with
new cases the doctor would prefer cash.'</p>

<p>Fred choked a little before chuckling (and it was his only
chuckle of the day), 'This young lady will pay. She brought the
Case here. He can't. He has a Condition!'</p>

<p>At the lower door of the apartment house, he said, 'Get this
straight, Sara. I don't blame Janissary. I blame you and whatever
you've been telling him. You take a taxi. I'm going to walk. And
I shan't see you in New York again. I'm taking the noon train to
Sachem . . . Shan't see you again. No!'</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<h1>CHAPTER XXXIV</h1>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>On the noon train to Sachem there was a celebrated lecturer
who beguiled the tedium by analysing the people he saw along the
way. He devoted only one glance to Fred Cornplow, sitting in
dumpy stiffness in his Pullman chair. There he was, merely a
round little man with a round little head and half-round little
moustache and round little hands, his fingers tapping with slow
regularity on the side of a folded magazine, his glance straight
ahead and uncommunicative.</p>

<p>Obviously a petty business man, too unimaginative, too
regimented, too incapable of strange sorrows and of fierce
achievement, to be worthy the contemplation of a celebrated
lecturer who, only eight hours from now, would be explaining to
an audience with nice clean shirts and nice earnest smiles that
life would be ever so much more amusing if you trained your
eyes.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>Fred had heard, as something that might happen to people whom
you never met, that there had been cases in which entirely sane
persons had been forced into private institutions, that were
really private insane asylums, by relatives who were grasping or
simply stupid. They had been penned in for years, and the more
they protested, the more they had been considered dangerous,
until they had sunk into the belief that they really were
cracked.</p>

<p>He did not know whether these stories were ever true. He did
know that Hazel and Annabel, certainly, Dr. Kamerkink and Walter
Lindbeck and Lawyer Appletree, probably, would not find anything
unsound in his sudden protest at being a combination of mint and
treadmill. But he also knew that a whole world of easy-going
people can be swayed by such single-track, demanding minds as
Sara's. And he believed, perhaps foolishly, that a week at such a
hospital as Janissary's, with that skilled finger hooking out of
him the quirks and crankinesses all of us possess, would really
make him unwell. It wouldn't be anything so melodramatic as
padded cells and strait-jackets; it would be just the spying,
pitying, incessant care that would turn him feeble-minded.</p>

<p>Didn't he know, Fred insisted to himself, in terror--at the
moment when the skilled lecturer was dismissing him as a human
polyp--that sound fellows, competent enough in their professions
and their homes, when they were drafted into an army often
appeared as clumsy plodders scorned by every boneheaded sergeant,
or even as quivering, yelping cowards? Why shouldn't a sanatorium
be as black with magic as an army?</p>

<p>Fred half opened his magazine, closed it and went to tapping
it again.</p>

<p>He drove out his nagging thoughts and began swiftly to scheme
what he would do. Absorbed though he was in planning, he was
sensitive to every smell, every sound, as he had never been since
boyhood, when he had gone off to college in a grimy day coach and
everything had been new and promising and terrifying and
beautiful. His senses were heightened to ecstasy. (Dr. Janissary
would probably have smirked and called him 'hypomanic'.)</p>

<p>This was not a familiar Pullman chair car, such as he took
forty times a year; it was a coloured jungle swaying in an
earthquake. He smelled the plush of the seat, the metal and
leather of his bag beside him, the gasoline-washed gloves of the
woman across the way, the cellared grey air from the vestibule.
He heard the steady bang of chains between the cars. He was
conscious of the dustiness in his throat, and in imagination he
tasted the thin, vintage coolness of a glass of ice water which
had ripened till the ice had almost melted.</p>

<p>He was emotionally aware of fellow passengers whom normally he
would never have seen. He hated the bushy-haired, vellum-faced
man with a cord on his eyeglasses. (It was the celebrated
lecturer.) He loved the powdery-cheeked old woman who sat so
primly, soft old hands quietly folded. He was agitated by the
sharp-nosed thin man far down the car . . . Could he be a shadow,
sent by Sara to spy on him? Why did the man watch him so? Hell
with him!</p>

<p>At a station stop he heard a radio, in a standing taxi,
blatting 'Coming Round the Mountain', cloying as eggnog, and he
wanted to weep. 'Oh, stop it, you sentimental old hen!' he jeered
at himself, but that liquid oozing sweetness made him yearn over
everything tender and banal: church bells on a June morning,
babies laughing on a lawn, sunset over a lake, the cottage
William Tyler Longwhale, and Hazel polishing glasses.</p>

<p>He was aware of the stream of life on which he was floating,
and aware of himself as not being, any longer, merely Our Mr.
Cornplow, Sr., a suit of clothes sitting at a desk, but a
separate and exciting soul, a little different from any other. He
rejoiced in his self, selfishness, self-consciousness. Why, he
demanded, shouldn't he be as gloriously self-conscious as any of
the great souls of which he had read: Napoleon or St. Francis or
Philip Sidney? Perhaps a part of their greatness had been an
unwillingness to be cogs.</p>

<p>He had only this one life to live; on this side Jordan, he
still had, at most, some thirty years for seeing all the hills
and headlands and bright rivers, and he must hasten about his
business of seeing.</p>

<p>Perhaps he would yet walk up the Champs-Elys&eacute;es.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>He was in Sachem Falls a little after four. With no
telephoning, he took a taxi to the Triumph agency. He cut short
the greetings. He summoned Paul Popple, his aide.</p>

<p>'Paul, I want you to stick around till you hear from me. It
may be about six o'clock. It may not be till late evening. Now
send me in Cal and Mac Tillery. When I get through with 'em, give
'em each a month's salary and make sure, you personally, that
they're out of this place before six.'</p>

<p>Cal and Mac ranged in, looking slyly confident.</p>

<p>'You boys are fired. You're no good. You'll get a month's
pay.'</p>

<p>'Say, Cousin Freddie, I think you're making a big mistake. Mac
and me are always watching out for your interests. The mechanics
you got out there are no good.'</p>

<p>'For once, I'm not going to argue. I don't want any long song
and dance. Let's admit you're related to me. So is Judas
Iscariot, if you carry it far enough. You two pose as the simple
country boys that get done by the city slickers. Fact is, you're
wolves. They're rustic, too! Your only idea of a job is that it's
a fight between you and the boss, and every minute you can loaf,
every time you can duck a piece of work, is just one skirmish
you've won. It's never occurred to you there could ever be
anything but hatred between you and the man you've consented to
work for. You're fired, and you might write this to your father:
When he comes around to ask me, "You can't let your own relatives
starve, can you?" I'll tell him, "With pleasure." Now get
out!'</p>

<p>They fled.</p>

<p>The grim little round man at the desk was saying within
himself, 'I don't know how long I can keep up this hard-boiled
attitude. I better work quick, while it lasts . . . Don't it
prove Dr. Janissary <i>is</i> good? One hour with him, this
morning, and I'm re-educated already.'</p>

<p>He telephoned to the house, then to a series of half a dozen
other numbers, found Hazel at a hat shop, and demanded, 'Be home
in half an hour, could you? Something important I want to tell
you'.</p>

<p>He telephoned to a tourist agency in Sachem and to one in
Boston.</p>

<p>He telephoned to Lawyer Appletree.</p>

<p>When he left the office, he did not look back.</p>

<p>He took a taxicab home. In it, over and over, without quite
knowing it, he repeated:</p>

<p> </p>

<blockquote>
<p>'For to admire an' for to see,<br>
 For to be'old this world so wide--<br>
 It never done no good to me,<br>
 But I can't drop it if I tried.'</p>
</blockquote>

<p> </p>

<p>He became conscious of what he was quoting, and laughed at
himself--not bitterly, now.</p>

<p>'Old Freddie, the International Bum! Remember that time we met
the tea planter at the Shanghai Club bar and went up the Wing
Wang Wong in a catamaran--now what the deuce <i>is</i> a
catamaran, I wonder?'</p>

<p>Hazel was at home. Before he could attack, she kissed him,
unexcitedly, and said, 'Howard has been trying to get you on the
phone. I couldn't quite make out what he wanted: something about
Sara telephoning from New York, about how you met a Dr. Janissary
and liked him so much, and Sara thinks we ought to get this
doctor to come to Sachem and look you over some more. Is anything
the matter with you?'</p>

<p>'Not any more! Not ever again! Hazel, I don't want to take a
lot of time explaining, but Sara is bound and determined to keep
me from retiring, or even taking a year's layoff.'</p>

<p>'But how could she keep you?'</p>

<p>'I don't know. But she's a smart girl and awfully
determined--and if you don't believe it, look at this doggone
inhuman furniture that somehow, I swear I don't know how, she
wished on to me. Hazel, I'm leaving for Europe . . .'</p>

<p><i>'Europe?'</i></p>

<p>'. . . to-night, and I want . . .'</p>

<p><i>'To-night?'</i></p>

<p>'. . . you to go with me. I won't stop to explain why I want
to get out and get out quick. Let's say it's just for the fun of
it. That's really the best reason, anyway, I'm <i>going.</i>
To-night. Are you with me or against me?'</p>

<p>'Why . . .'</p>

<p>'Are you?'</p>

<p>'Why, yes, of course, though . . . I'd love to go to Europe
with you. I think it would be lovely. But start to-night? It's
crazy.'</p>

<p>'Certainly. So am I. At least, I'm doggone serious, and seems
that's the same as being insane. Coming?'</p>

<p>'You're joking. We'd have to have two weeks, at the very
least, to get ready.'</p>

<p>'What ready?'</p>

<p>'Clothes.'</p>

<p>'You'd be surprised, but they sell clothes in Europe, too. And
I'll bet anything, maybe you could buy toothbrushes there.'</p>

<p>'But why . . .'</p>

<p>'Because Howard and Sara will gang up on me, on us, and if
they get us to delay our leaving--call it our sneaking off like
cowards, if you want to--we never will make a break. They'll put
up such an argument about my having to stay here and get them
started standing on their own feet--keep on for the next twenty
years getting 'em started. Oh, Sara wouldn't ever let us go.'</p>

<p>'Don't be silly! How could she prevent it?'</p>

<p>'Oh, maybe she couldn't absolutely prevent it, if we kicked
and screamed, but I'll tell you what she doggone well could do:
she'd sneer so and jeer so that she'd spoil the whole thing, same
as she spoiled William Tyler Longwhale and our second honeymoon;
she'd manage to take all the fun out of it and make us feel we
were irresponsible old fools if we ever did anything except sit
and knit. <i>Knitting!</i> We either go quick, and go secret, and
go to-night, or we never go at all. And I'm going. Are you going
with me? Are you my wife?'</p>

<p>'I--I think I am, Fred. What time do we leave?'</p>

<p>'Before midnight.'</p>

<p>'I'll start packing . . . Will you want your winter
underwear?'</p>

<p>'Yes--no--I don't know--and if Howard calls up again, stall
him off.'</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>To Lawyer Appletree's considerable indignation, Fred insisted
that they stop only for a sandwich, instead of dinner, before
they set to work, at Appletree's house.</p>

<p>A bank cashier, who on the telephone had even more indignantly
complained, 'But what's all the hurry?' went wearily into the
closed bank and met Fred at Appletree's with twenty-five hundred
dollars in travellers' cheques.</p>

<p>Paul Popple arrived at Appletree's with Fred's car, which Paul
himself had been greasing and inspecting. To Appletree and Paul,
Fred stated, with a refusal to argue:</p>

<p>'Paul is left in charge of the agency, entirely, for the next
three months, possibly much longer. Ed, I want you to draw up
some kind of a fancy power of attorney for him, showing he's the
boss. He is to receive his present salary, plus fifteen per cent
of all profits. The rest are to be deposited to my account in the
Grangers' National.</p>

<p>'Against that account, you are to pay Howard fifteen hundred
dollars to-morrow, and Sara five hundred, and thereafter, a
thousand a year to each of them, except that if Sara marries,
which don't look any too doggone probable, she gets only five
hundred. She is to stay in our house, meanwhile, and you are to
pay the servants and taxes and insurance--I'll give you a list of
all those items--but if I send you word at the end of three
months, you are to let the place furnished.</p>

<p>'Now you, Ed--you have a complete power of attorney, and all I
ask you to do is not follow my example and begin enjoying
yourself. Because, as you are about to tell me--I'll admit it's a
dirty trick to spoil your speech--sane, normal, honest-to-God
citizens with a stake in the community don't do anything so crazy
as pull up stakes and hike out for no reason except they merely
want to. No indeed! They sit around and think it over and make
preparations for going so carefully that when they're ready to
go--they don't go!'</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<center>
<h1>CHAPTER XXXV</h1>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>Not till ten minutes before midnight were they off for Boston,
which Fred had chosen as a safer port than New York, where Saras
and Janissarys lurked in every alley.</p>

<p>When he returned from Appletree's, Hazel had begun to pack,
but had not finished. She was sitting on the floor of a closet,
whimpering like a baby, her wet face wrinkled like a baby's, as
she pawed over a box filled with the shabby treasures of lost
youth. Silently she held up to him a report card of Howard from
the fourth grade--Deportment was Fair; Drawing and Language,
Excellent; Arithmetic, Geography and the rest were Poor.</p>

<p>Fred chuckled, 'He used to draw curlicues, and he said they
were smoke from a chimney, but I'd turn the house into a
pig!'</p>

<p>She held up the gilt-lettered invitation to Sara's first
public dance, the High School Assembly, when she had been
fifteen. He remembered Sara in the preposterously short skirt of
the day, her legs so long and reedy: remembered that her hair had
been short and choppy and uncombable as a boy's. Such a gallant
little tike she had been.</p>

<p>Hazel was sobbing, 'Oh, Fred, must we . . . They're so sweet.
And they're all we have.'</p>

<p>Just then the one thing in the world he wanted to do was not
to do the intemperate thing that was the one thing in the world
he wanted to do. As desperately as a man who has got himself into
a fight that is too big for him, he wished that he had never
started the commotion. He struggled:</p>

<p>'I know. But we'll mean all the more to them if they see us as
something besides a couple of stand-bys that they can take for
granted.'</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>He helped her finish packing. She had brilliantly foreseen
that they mustn't take anything they didn't indisputably need;
they kept the luggage down to eight bags, and perhaps a canvas
roll and a few odd bundles; and in all of them, later, they found
nothing unnecessary except, possibly: A large framed photograph
of Sara aged eleven and Howard aged four; photographs of the same
ones, two, five and nine years later; a handsome binocular case
which proved to contain not the binoculars but shells for a
sixteen-gauge shotgun; a map of New England; volume two of <i>Tom
Jones--</i>neither of them had read volume one; a guidebook of
Austro-Hungary dated 1913; half pair gent's alligator-hide
slippers; a bar of almond chocolate; an extra hairbrush, which
each of them had thought belonged to the other; four sheets of
letter paper headed 'Olympia Hotel, East Utica'; a pair of round
golf garters; nail tint, which Hazel never used; an empty box for
digestive pills; and a magnificent, transparent, purple
waterproof, which proved to be split down the back.</p>

<p>Their bags were all in the Triumph coup&eacute;; they sat
outside, in a forbidding world of frost, looking up at their
home. It seemed kind and secure, built not of bricks but of
hopes. The street before them was a corridor of forbidding
steel.</p>

<p>She gasped, resolutely turning her face from the house, 'Oh,
go, go quick--while we can.'</p>

<p>It was miles afterward that she asked, 'Do you happen to know
what ship we're going on, what port we're going to? I don't
suppose it matters, really, now that we've given up everything
we've loved and trusted, but it might be interesting!'</p>

<p>He stopped the car. 'Sure. It's hard. We can go back, of
course. It all comes down to--and I'm not so doggone certain I've
got a right to ask it--but it's a question of do you trust
me?'</p>

<p>She rubbed her left forefinger, in its knitted glove, on the
seat between them; she hesitated; and said, a little doubtfully,
'Yes, I . . .' Then, strongly, almost gaily, <i>'Yes</i>!'</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>From Sachem to Boston the distance was two hundred and
forty-two miles, and they drove it in seven hours and forty
minutes, with Hazel cautiously deputing at the wheel for seventy
miles of the way, while Fred leaned his cheek on his fist and
tried to sleep.</p>

<p>They seemed to be slipping through no living world at all, but
through unending cemetery aisles lined with pale tombstones. The
car fled smooth and effortless as the passage of a ghost. Between
the tombs, now and then, were lights that might have been
villages, but they passed so quickly that Fred could not be
certain that he had seen them. Only when a bridge bumbled quickly
under the car, or they heard the swishing that marked their rush
through a narrow defile between hills, was he sure that he had
not really died, but was actually going forward to more life.</p>

<p>Then around and in front of them was Albany, a cauldron that
bewildered and frightened them, and they stopped hastily, climbed
stiffly out, to demand coffee and to gulp its scorching
bitterness. Again they drank coffee in a sleeping Pittsfield, and
he thought of Stonefield near by, of William Tyler Longwhale, and
the happy evening carelessness in which, decades and decades ago,
Hazel and he had lounged on the porch there and tried to sing
'Seeing Nellie Home'.</p>

<p>He tried to hum it now, as they creaked on, flipped around a
corner and shot straight ahead, but it died on the dead air
inside the car.</p>

<p>Hazel was intimidatingly silent and withdrawn beside him. But
once, beyond Stonefield, she fondly touched his arm, and he was
moved to crow, 'The golden road to Samarkand--we're on the
way--the golden road!'</p>

<p>He was certain, presently, that she had gone to sleep, and he
could drive as fast as he wanted. It lulled his nostalgia to
watch the needle of the illuminated speedometer, only spot of
light in the gloomy car, flicker up to fifty-five, sixty,
sixty-five. Hills arose before him, as dark mounds beyond the
headlights, and he flung the car at them with joyful viciousness.
Flats spread beside them; he imagined that--in snowy December--he
could hear frog choruses, and he pushed the wheels into eating up
the level road. Village lights came up at him and he scorched by
them, ever faster, so that they slipped past like clusters of
fireflies.</p>

<p>He felt sleepiness parching his eyes and, as a veteran driver,
stopped by the road, let Hazel jolt awake in the motion of
stopped motion, turned the wheel over to her and tried to doze
off.</p>

<p>He startled as he remembered that on his desk at home he had
left a marked list of sailings from Boston.</p>

<p>Would it lead Howard or Sara to him? Would their complaints,
their drugging appeals to his sense of duty, paralyse him again
and at the last moment prevent his going?</p>

<p>No. They'd never find it till morning. And so indirect were
the flying routes that they would not be able to catch him even
by plane.</p>

<p>He gave up sleep. When he lighted a cigarette, in the glow of
the match he saw Hazel's face tense. 'Lemme drive again,' he
grunted, with no shadings from the tenderness he felt.</p>

<p>The route nicked off only a corner of Worcester, and instantly
they were again in the graveyard lane. But at Waltham there was a
shivering hint of daylight, and he suddenly felt strong and gay.
Almost in Boston! Almost on a ship! Almost bucking the winter
ocean! So he cheerfully slowed up for the first traffic, after
their dash across one wide state and half another, and decorously
he slipped up to a hotel on Beacon Street, in winter
daylight.</p>

<p>The doorman yawned, 'Like your car garaged for all day?'</p>

<p>Fred slightly alarmed him by sighing, 'I want to pay in
advance for storing it, dead, for three months,' and by
sentimentally smoothing the hot cheeks of its bonnet.</p>

<p>Would he ever drive a Triumph again?</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>He slept for two hours; Hazel, so far as he knew, till noon.
He hastened to the tourist agency to which he had telephoned from
Sachem and bought two tickets from Boston to Constantinople
(Constantinople!), on the <i>Aranjuna Queen,</i> a cargo ship
which carried some twenty passengers and which was headed for
Channel ports, Lisbon, Gibraltar and clear round the
Mediterranean. (But he did not call it a 'cargo ship' as yet; not
till he had been baptized with salt water and the chief officer's
salty jeers would he know how land-lubberly he had once been in
calling the <i>Aranjuna</i> a 'freight boat'.)</p>

<p>He galloped about Boston, being polylingual to the extent of
always saying 'Jah' for 'Yes,' and timidly demanded visas for
Great Britain, Portugal, Jugoslavia and other patently fictional
lands. He bought a book called <i>A Satchel Guide to Europe,</i>
and a small motion-picture camera with which he hoped to snap
Hazel walking in front of the pyramids, Hazel feeding pigeons at
St. Mark's, Hazel fishing in a Norwegian fjord.</p>

<p>And he bought for her six winter roses--very expensive.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>At two o'clock that afternoon they stood amidships on the S.S.
<i>Aranjuna Queen,</i> looking down on the freight-littered pier.
From the bridge, they heard the captain shouting to the chief
officer, up on the forecastle head, 'Single up, fore and aft,'
and the bosun bellowing to the sailors, 'Heave the gangway
aboard.'</p>

<p>Hazel clutched his arm. 'Our last link with shore! In a
minute, it'll be too late!'</p>

<p>'Yes, too late,' he croaked.</p>

<p>The gangway was slid up and flopped on the deck.</p>

<p>The last lines were let go. The captain, above them, cried to
the third mate, at the engine-room telegraph, 'Slow astern.' They
were incredibly moving; going, for the first time in either of
their lives, from the security of land to the savage unknown.
They held each other like terrified children as the whistle burst
into obscene blatting.</p>

<p>Just then two people galloped along the pier below them,
screaming.</p>

<p>'Good Lord! It's Howard and Annabel! How'd they ever know? Can
they grab us and make us come back now? No! We're safe!' rattled
Fred.</p>

<p>Out on the perilous edge of wharf beside the dock-house ran
the little couple. Annabel was crying, 'Take me with you! Please!
Take me along!'</p>

<p>Hazel sobbed. The ship was quivering now and moving more
swiftly. Howard had been waving imploringly. Now, as the black
side of the ship drew definitely away, he stopped waving, and his
whole face puckered with weeping.</p>

<p>'My boy--my little boy that we're deserting! He's so unformed
yet. He can't take care of himself,' whimpered Hazel.</p>

<p>The <i>Aranjuna Queen</i> snorted regally again and drew out
into the harbour, and they could see their children only as
doll-like figures, faithfully waving to the last.</p>

<p>'How did we ever get here on this boat?' marvelled the
completely astonished Fredk Wm.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<center>
<h1>CHAPTER XXXVI</h1>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>'Poor kid! I know--I know! Howard, the poor kid, he's never
had to take anything seriously, not even his marriage. I guess it
does jar him to see us running out on him. I've got a hunch it's
been our fault; we never worked much at teaching him to stand on
his own feet. Maybe he'll learn now. And then someday he'll want
to get a little acquainted with himself, too, and maybe he'll
have to run away from Little Nero!'</p>

<p>He had been trying to comfort Hazel, down in their stateroom,
but out of all his chatter nothing was distinct except 'Poor
kid'. In a few days, he assured her, they would forget Howard and
enjoy being wrecked on the mobile desert island that is a
ship.</p>

<p>'I'm going to hate it! I'll want to come back the minute we
land! I'll see poor Howard crying there, all the time,' she
bawled, while Fred mechanically tapped her back . . . and, no
longer listening much, over her shoulder surveyed their first
stateroom . . . He carefully did not tell her that there was such
a thing as returning to Boston on the pilot boat.</p>

<p>The room, rather humble, delighted him more than a
rosewood-and-tapestry suite on any cruising hotel would have
done. Its stripped neatness belonged to ships. There were two
beds, as promised by the travel circulars on which he had become
such an authority, and between them was a bedside table with
electric reading lamp, but the chairs were straight and small,
the wash-bowl was of the tricky, delightful, old-fashioned sort
that folded up like a shelf, and one side of the stateroom, of
white-daubed bolts and steel plates curving up to an honest
porthole, was frankly the side of the vessel.</p>

<p>'I'm sure enough on a ship!' he exulted.</p>

<p>That moment the ship rolled heavily, and his stomach did not
exult.</p>

<p>'Guess better guppon deck get li'l' fresh air,' he panted.</p>

<p>They struggled, step by swaying step, up the forward stairs,
and in the beginnings of distress Hazel began to neglect being
homesick. Astern they saw a grey bank--she did not know whether
it was fog or land, but she decided on land, so that she could
agonize over leaving it.</p>

<p>'Take a last look. Snow and ice. Next land we see--golly,
think!--it'll be foreign land!--a strange country!--and I reckon
it'll be all green,' he said with false buoyancy.</p>

<p>'By the way, Fred, where are you going?'</p>

<p>'How do you mean? I showed you the ticket--all these different
countries--whole slew of 'em!'</p>

<p>'But what port, what country, do we touch first of all? Where
are we <i>going?'</i></p>

<p>'Golly, I was so busy getting away, I forgot to ask!'</p>

<p>It was to Hull, in Yorkshire, that they were going, said the
purser.</p>

<p>'Oh yes, that's what I thought,' said Fred.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>Never, not even in William Tyler Longwhale, had they been so
lured to each other as in the three days, out of a ten-day
crossing, when they idled in the stateroom, never getting out of
dressing-gowns, always in the not too disagreeable state between
seasickness and a bounding health that would have compelled them
to go up and be athletic and social. In the Cornplow home, meals
had been brought up to bedrooms on trays only in case of definite
illnesses, and with increasing sense of power and travelled
sophistication they enjoyed ringing for the steward and for tea
and toast and orange juice all day long.</p>

<p>'I just can't face the thought of leaving our nice little room
and meeting a lot of strangers,' Hazel sighed. 'I'm sorry, Fred,
but I can see now I'm not going to be any good as a traveller.
I'm too shy of new people and new ways. But you'll be grand at
it, you old mixer, and I'll just stick along . . . till you get
tired of it and want to trot back home.'</p>

<p>So all day, contentedly, for hours at a time forgetting that
they had shamefully deserted their helpless brood, they talked of
themselves; recalled, with snorts or giggles, old, far-off,
unhappy things and battles long ago, such as the quarrel, comic
now but devastating then, when he had been discovered, during a
stately ball, shooting craps with a bunch of chauffeurs in the
basement, with his dress coat hung on a coal shovel, and on his
proud shirt front a skull and bones drawn in lipstick.</p>

<p>Never had Hazel found out what female serpent had drawn it . .
. Neither had Fred.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>They first emerged from their cave for dinner in the saloon.
Hazel wailed, 'I'm going to be embarrassed to death--all those
people staring at me.' So she was embarrassed by nobody's staring
at all. The company didn't even cackle at her having failed to
show up. They had been sufficiently seasick themselves.</p>

<p>The eighteen passengers were divided among four tables in the
saloon. As members of the wholesale-selling, or knightly, caste,
Fred and Hazel were seated at the captain's table, where they
found no one more intimidating than a Mr. and Mrs. Alphen, of
Joliet, and Miss Pablum, a school teacher from Minneapolis, all
three of whom seemed to have no particular reason in going abroad
except to inspect things, to be found only in Europe, called
Culture, Castles, Napoleon Brandy, and Points of Historical
Interest.</p>

<p>The captain was a very good captain, and as such his chief
interest was in real-estate investment in Mount Vernon, New York,
where he resided. He was tall and thin, he told jokes about
nagging wives, and he played the piano.</p>

<p>Mrs. Alphen showed the Cornplows, at the very first meal,
pictures of her grandchildren. Miss Pablum lent them a lively
book called <i>In the Footsteps of British Bards.</i> As for Mr.
Alphen, he was that vestigial remain, a State Patriot. He
asserted, touchily, that Illinois air was tastier than Wisconsin
air, Illinois taxes lower than New York taxes, Illinois Swedes
more Swedish than Minnesota Swedes, and Joliet penitentiary more
flourishing than Sing Sing.</p>

<p>'Why, they're all nice, friendly people, just like home,' said
Hazel.</p>

<p>There was a good deal of merry jesting between table and
table; each insisting that it possessed more wit, more skill in
bridge playing, than the others. But, complained Hazel, the other
passengers seemed even shyer than herself; they did not 'get
together in social activities'.</p>

<p>It was she who organized them.</p>

<p>In company with the purser, who pleased her very much indeed
by insisting that she must have 'crossed' at least ten or twelve
times, Hazel got up a bridge tournament, a backgammon tournament,
a shuffle-board tournament, a masquerade ball, and a Reading, by
Miss Pablum, who led them plodding from footstep to footstep of
the bards.</p>

<p>On vacations Fred had noticed that Hazel took cheerfully to
new people and to those extraordinary games by which adults
escaped sitting and thinking, but he had explained it as a few
days' excitement in getting away from domestic chores. He
perceived, now, that she had more talent than he for liking
strangers and strange ways and for being noisy and jokey with
them. She became, indeed, Queen of the Ship, and it was she whom
the other passengers asked about the day and hour of their
arrival in Hull, the amount to tip, the name of the what-is-it
that swings out the boats, the rules for deck tennis and the
latitude of Spitzbergen.</p>

<p>Fred was merely her Prince Consort.</p>

<p>He had pictured, as a chief joy of travelling, greater than
ancient abbeys and beards on the Boulevard, being intimate with
ever so many new wandering gentlemen. Was he not the trained
salesman, the jolly good fellow, who could enter an unfamiliar
hotel lobby and be calling five men by their first names within
ten minutes?</p>

<p>But, released from having to be any particular sort of person,
he found that he wanted to get acquainted only with himself.
Brother Alphen, he admitted, was a swell fellow; but somehow, he
marvelled to Hazel, he didn't want to hear anything more about
the New Deal or the convenience of oil furnaces. He had had to
listen to so many hearty citizens, for so many years, at the
Triumph Agency, and to Hazel and Sara at home afterward. He
thought it queer in himself; he wondered what Dr. Janissary would
have said; but he enjoyed silence. Doc Kamerkink would have
ridiculed the notion that the breezy and back-slapping Fred was
actually an introvert, interested only in the forms and colours
of his hidden little soul; and Hazel an extrovert, and not at all
the inward-looking sensitive plant that the seclusion of
domesticity made her appear. But a great deal of the ten days
Fred spent in circling the deck by himself, or in standing at the
forward rail, while Hazel was in the lounge, playing
contract.</p>

<p>Mrs. Alphen, from her deck-chair, would call at him brightly,
'Aren't you ashamed of yourself, being so selfish and neglecting
us ladies and all!' and she would gesture at the deck-chair
beside her, but he would only smile and scuttle away, realizing
that he was asocial and a scoundrel.</p>

<p>Hour-long, as the ship rolled, he watched the forward derrick
sway against the seas rushing at him. In the power of the waves
he felt freedom; in the bows, tenderly swelling to a piercing
point, he felt speed; and in the pendulum of the derrick, a
rhythm of security . . . Perhaps in wandering he could be
minutely great, as in room-bound labour he had, these years, been
greatly small.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>Toward the end of the passage, Hazel spoke of home and of
Howard and Sara barely once a day, as if merely by habit. Her
homesickness, and his, was acute only at Christmas, which they
spent on the <i>Aranjuna Queen</i> in the English Channel, with a
dim sight of Margate and the mouth of the Thames.</p>

<p>'B-but anyway, we aren't any homesicker than the others, I
guess!' she sobbed gallantly.</p>

<p>Indeed, the more the <i>Aranjuna's</i> passengers tried to be
festive and bear in the garlands and the Yule log, the more
veiled and timid were their eyes. They had a Christmas tree in
the lounge, and the captain swore it was a damn fine tree, for
hadn't he brought it himself from Mount Vernon? The head steward
rather mechanically produced silver cord and crimson glass balls,
and rather mechanically the passengers dressed the tree. They
cleared out the cubbyhole which was the 'souvenir shop' of the
barber-bath-steward, and gave one another souvenir handkerchiefs
and tin toy automobiles and ten-cent boxes of candy; they had a
large dinner, with goose and turkey and anguished paper hats, and
afterwards they danced.</p>

<p>But every time Miss Pablum danced awkwardly past the tree, she
looked away. Her mother had died on the first of December.</p>

<p>In mid afternoon they had their Christmas radiogram:</p>

<p> </p>

<blockquote>
<p>MERRY XMAS HAPPY NEW YEAR EXQUISITE EASTER MUCH LOVE DONT
FORGET LOVING KIDS SARA HOWARD ANNABEL LILNERO</p>
</blockquote>

<p> </p>

<p>Then Hazel wept, and watered the sacred rose of Christmas.</p>

<p>'They're grand children. They'll be perfect, now they see they
can't run over us!' swore Fred. 'Say! Do you still feel you want
to go right back, soon as we land in Hull--just take couple days
in London, maybe, and then sail . . .'</p>

<p>Hazel was judicious:</p>

<p>'Well, now we're here, seems to me it 'd be an awful waste of
good money not to take advantage of it. Katie Alphen says we'll
just love the Riviera. But we certainly won't want to stay long .
. . Look, Fred. If we just happened to still be here next summer,
just happened to decide to stay on, I mean, do you think we'd
enjoy having a country cottage in England? Minnie Pablum says
we'd adore Rural England . . . Not that she's been there.'</p>

<p>'Well,' said Fred.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>They drank a toast to home, in the smoking-room, which wasn't
a smoking-room but an alcove off the lounge.</p>

<p>'Let's drink an extra one to Annabel--best of the lot,'
proposed Fred.</p>

<p>Hazel giggled. 'You're so funny! You don't know yourself one
single bit? You're half in love with that girl, and you have no
idea of it!'</p>

<p>'You think so? Ha, ha!' he said.</p>

<p>It made his voyage of discovery of himself curiously easier to
travel with a pleasant person who did not embarrass him by
understanding him.</p>

<p> </p>

<h1>CHAPTER XXXVII</h1>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>The Villa Sophie, at Belfayol, on the C&ocirc;te d'Azur
between Hy&egrave;res and St. Tropez, was a smart little pension,
a respectable pension, a white pension streaked with purple
bougainvillaea, on the beach, overlooking the fishing boats, with
the tiny casino only two blocks away, and with victorias, in
which no one ever seemed to drive, always standing in front of
it. It had a tidy salon with Spanish arm-chairs, yellow
marble-topped tables, grey marble floor, and gold-coloured
curtains. Tea could be had in an arbour in the rose garden. And
though the bedrooms were small, their long windows, opening like
doors, gave on tiny iron balconies facing the full brilliance of
the tideless sea.</p>

<p>At the Villa Sophie, in late April, Frederick William Cornplow
&amp; wfe, as it was stated in the pension register, were living
the life of international culture de luxe, all modern
improvements, lowest rates.</p>

<p>They had seen perhaps one half per cent of London (on the
'side trip' from Hull), of Rotterdam and Brest, of a Lisbon
hysterical with the waxing Spanish revolution, of Capri by way of
Naples, of divine Venice, of Ragusa, Athens and at last of
Istanbul. (They blushed that they had ever called it
'Constantinople'. Which name they went right on calling it,
whenever they weren't careful.)</p>

<p>At Istanbul, Fred was embarrassingly near to the golden road
to Samarkand, and at Istanbul he was uncomfortable to a point of
terror. He didn't understand what they sold in these crazy
littered shops; he didn't know how to get a hot bath; he saw no
Triumph cars nor ever heard a meaty American voice. He was a Heck
Centre pup lost on Hester Street.</p>

<p>Though they had not known there was such a thing as a
Jugoslavian steamer, a particularly trim and slim and
black-and-nickel Jugoslavian craft had taken them back to
Villefranche, whence they timidly drove to Belfayol.</p>

<p>In Ragusa they had received, and in the shadow of its old
walls they had re-re-read, the cable from Sara saying that she
had just been married to Walter Lindbeck, her boss, and could
they rent the Cornplow home?</p>

<p>Yes, they could, Fred cabled, though he felt that with the den
of their wolf cubs thus gone, and with Hazel daily more sprightly
about the joys of Europe and the Great World, he would never be
able to return now to the one place in the world he longed to
see.</p>

<p>Early in March they had the cable from Howard that Little Nero
had been born, that Little Nero's name was Franklin R. Cornplow,
and that 'mother son self oke'.</p>

<p>So when they came, weary and eyesore and foot-aching, to the
Villa Sophie, in April, they were for a certain time glad to feel
they had found a new fixed home.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>The guests of the Villa were very cosmopolitan, considered
Fred and Hazel. They included a Belgian count, a Russian colonel
and lady, a professor who, unlike most professors, looked like a
professor, a Swedish sculptor who never seemed to do anything to
rocks and whose favourite daily joke was that he was there
'studying villasophie', a mysterious lady in black who had
nothing to recommend her except her mysteriousness, a fat
Englishwoman called Lady Jaxon, five respectable but
indistinguishable women, and a fat retired Irish contractor from
Omaha, also with lady. The contractor was cheery and became
Fred's best friend and worst pest: his wife spoke of art and was
studying French--as, suddenly, amazingly, Hazel seemed also to be
doing.</p>

<p>In this international musical comedy troupe Hazel could not
star as she had on the steamer, but she fitted, she loved their
wan references to ancestral wealth; she became smarter and
rosier, and daily keener about the pension's communal sports:
meals, swimming, anticipation of meals, <i>boule</i> at the
casino, reminiscences about meals, shopping, and picnics with hot
meals and bottles of white Bordeaux, on top of Mont Nid . . .
Fred noticed that the fat contractor, the fat Lady Jaxon and his
own plump self were invariably favoured with the bills for these
picnics.</p>

<p>Hazel had first been awed at the be-titled company but within
a month she was muttering to Fred, 'Oh, these are nothing but
small-time pension tramps. I'm looking forward to Monte Carlo and
Paris, and then our cottage in England. Lady Jaxon--she really is
top-drawer--she says we can get a perfectly ducky cottage near
her Place in Devon. Would you like that?'</p>

<p>'Uh--oh yes--sure--I guess so.'</p>

<p>'Happy?'</p>

<p>'Oh yes--sure!'</p>

<p>'Oh, <i>be</i> happy!'</p>

<p>But daily he felt more out of it, out of everything. In this
alien land, with its funny language, nothing, not politics nor
business nor manners nor food, was any of his affair. He was an
outsider, merely tolerated, and without very definitely longing
for home he wanted to be back where he could exercise the
citizen's precious privilege of kicking about the way everybody
ran everything.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>It seemed to be one of Fred's typical mornings in this suburb
of Samarkand.</p>

<p>He had successfully begged off from a morning's motor trip to
Bandol with Hazel, Lady Jaxon and the contractress. Hazel was so
exceptional among American women that she understood that he
might, without viciousness or secret plans of dissipation, want
to escape so feminized an expedition. She didn't suspect him of
having an engagement with a Proven&ccedil;al enchantress. In
this, unfortunately, she was right.</p>

<p>He sat alone, feeling alone and lost, drinking coffee at a
caf&eacute; on the plaza, with the sea in front, the casino on
one side, and on the other, the plaster railway station. If on
the steamer he had been glad to avoid noisy inquiries about the
state of his family, now he would have rejoiced if someone he had
known long ago, almost anyone he had ever known, had come up
behind him, assaulted his back and bellowed, 'Well, you old
so-and-so! What you doing here?'</p>

<p>He tried to read the last crop of American newspapers.</p>

<p>What was all this about this new labour organization called
the Committee on Industrial Organization? He wasn't sure what he
could do about it, but he felt that he ought to dash right over
to Michigan and show the boys, on both sides, how to act nicely.
He puzzled over the President's proposal to change the Supreme
Court. He could do nothing here in Belfayol; these foreigners,
these Frenchman, didn't seem to think he was an authority on
their politics; but if he were back in America, where he
belonged, he'd certainly have something to say that would help
the President.</p>

<p>In Belfayol, not so far from Spain, there was a backwash of
the great rebellion; now and then he saw refugees, bewildered
with bundles, but he had already discovered the queer fact of how
little a world calamity changes streets and customs.</p>

<p>As he always did, when he was here alone, he studied the
tramway passengers debarking at their end of the line. He saw a
young couple, American by their voices, and longed to pick them
up, but they were too worldly for him: the girl in slacks and
sweater, the man in beret, flappy blue trousers, espadrilles. No.
Prob'ly they had a villa up the mountain; prob'ly been coming
here for years; prob'ly think he was only a vulgar tourist. Well,
and maybe he was. But doggone it, in Sachem they didn't think he
was just a tourist.</p>

<p>More dramatic than the tramway was the railway station, at
which the Paris train was now due. Sometimes whole squads of
Americans got out. Once he had gloriously seen, coming from the
train, a Kansas City man he had met at a Triumph convention in
Atlantic City! The coachmen before the station were waking up;
their horses were shaking off flies. The porters were streaming
inside, yelling at one another as though war had started. The
sellers of oranges were gathered. From the station straggled the
passengers. Suppose there should again be a man from Kansas City!
Or even from incomparable Sachem!</p>

<p>Fred watched the doorway like a trysting lover. He noticed a
young woman in clothes that he guessed were American. She was
carrying a very young baby and looking feverishly back at the
porter, ahead at the carriages, shaking her head over the crowd's
volubility, comforting the howling baby--altogether clean
flustered.</p>

<p>'Wonder if I could help her any way?' thought Fred, not much
concerned.</p>

<p>Then he saw that the young woman was his daughter-in-law,
Annabel.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<center>
<h1>CHAPTER XXXVIII</h1>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>Returning from her bland and chatty drive to Bandol, Hazel
climbed out of the mildewed limousine, calling to Lady Jaxon,
'Such a pleasant trip, and indeed I will look into the
Cotswolds.'</p>

<p>She revolved and saw, entering the Villa Sophie, a procession
consisting of her husband, looking agitated, of Annabel
Staybridge Cornplow, who was, of course, not here at all, but in
Sachem Falls, U.S.A., of her first grandchild, F. Roosevelt
Cornplow, who didn't exist, except as a sentence in a cablegram
and a few gushing pages in a letter, a porter, with bags that
seemed familiar, and a furious <i>cocher,</i> who had not
received his fare.</p>

<p>'Good heavens and earth!' said Hazel.</p>

<p>Her slight jealousy of Annabel vanished in joy of this dear,
customary face; she swooped on the girl, kissed her, kissed the
baby and babbled, 'Bell--Bell--and the baby--but only six weeks
old--how could you come--where is Howard--what's it all
mean--Bell--I couldn't believe my eyes--I can't!'</p>

<p>Fred mumbled, 'Oh yes you can. It just means Howard has gone
to pieces, and I've got to sail from Havre to-morrow afternoon
and yank him out of it.'</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>Annabel's room in the Villa Sophie, where the baby was asleep
in a crib improvised from a bureau drawer, a room with clattering
composition stone floor, high panelled plastered walls, and
frigid pink-and-gilt ceiling, seemed unfriendly to them, these
lost Americans, and to Annabel's sorrows.</p>

<p>'Now what is it, dear? Where's Howard?' said Hazel.</p>

<p>'Back home. He didn't want me to come. But he was drunk. He
couldn't prevent my coming. Father gave me the money. But Father
wouldn't go see Howard. He just laughed at me. He talked about
giving me a trip to Reno as a belated wedding present, Father did
. . . I don't just know why I came here. I just felt so lonely in
our flat, with Howard lying drunk.'</p>

<p>'Honey, I don't know what I can say that's very comforting.
But let's see if there's anything I can do. What about Howard's
business--Bogey &amp; Cornplow?' said Fred.</p>

<p>'Howard said Ben cheated him. Ben said Howard hurt their
business--not booze so much as he didn't keep dates. They
quarrelled. At the flat. I grabbed Howard's arm and kept him from
hitting Ben. Ben bought him out--for five hundred dollars. He's
living on that, and the money Judge Appletree sends him from you.
But I don't think it will last. He keeps giving it to Cal Tillery
. . .'</p>

<p>'Cal? Cousin Cal?' Fred was appalled.</p>

<p>'Yes. Howard says Cal is his only friend. Cal doesn't nag him.
Cal's brother, Mac, got fed up with them and actually went to
work. He was so surprised to find he liked it! Now, Howard and
Cal have bought a garage together--that is, Howard gives Cal the
money, and Cal <i>says</i> he's paying for it, on time. Howard
never goes near the place. Mostly he stays in the flat. And Cal
brings him in booze. Cal laughed at me.'</p>

<p>'Cal's scum! He's a cousin-by-accident!'</p>

<p>And once Cal tried to kiss me. That's what made me run
away--and I was afraid what might happen to Baby--oh, Howard was
always sweet to the baby, even when he was drunk, but he was so
shaky--once he almost dropped the baby on the floor, when he was
trying to dress it--and I didn't want it to grow up listening to
Howard and Cal sing "The Old Oaken Bucket"!'</p>

<p>'But Annabel, dear,' said Hazel, 'what's Howard going to do,
now he's out of the firm?'</p>

<p>'Oh, he has a hundred new plans a day: he's going to join the
army and learn flying. He's going to Hollywood and be a star--but
oh, his face is changing so; it almost seems as if it was getting
coarse already . . . Oh, my darlings, I don't like to talk this
way about him!'</p>

<p>'Go on! You're as much our child as he is,' Fred vowed.</p>

<p>Hazel looked only a little doubtful.</p>

<p>'And then he talks about going to Alaska--he thinks he can get
a free farm there--he says it's the only place where "a young
fellow has a chance". And he talks about making millions selling
cotton-stripping machines. And the latest I heard, he was going
to be a tree doctor! But no matter what he says, I feel he's just
given up. Completely discouraged. He's only part to blame, maybe
. . .'</p>

<p>Fred groaned, 'I'm to blame! Me and my insisting on running
away.'</p>

<p>'No. Your going isn't to blame. But maybe your putting it off
so long is. Sara and Howard thought you'd always be there and
nurse them.'</p>

<p>'Annabel! What about Sara? Does she seem happy?' demanded
Hazel.</p>

<p>'Darling, Sara has now been married to her Walter for fifty
years, and she just can't understand why Howard doesn't obey me
the way Walter has obeyed her, these sixty-seven years they've
been married . . . She made him put on a sale of surrealist
paintings in the store; they already have two pictures in it; one
of them was done by a bookkeeper in Schenectady, and one by a
Frenchman, who wanted to come over, but they wouldn't let him out
of the asylum.'</p>

<p>Fred interrupted, 'Sweet child, I love you, but we must get
going . . . Hazel, I find I have to take an evening train, to
catch the <i>Sovereign</i> at Havre, tomorrow . . . I'll be in
New York in six and a half days!'</p>

<p>'But you want us to come along--me, anyway?' said Hazel.</p>

<p>She was a little reluctant.</p>

<p>'No. Stay here. Show the Riviera to Annabel. Take her to
Paris. I want two people in this doggone family to do what they
want to do for once. If you can pull <i>that</i> off, the
Associated Press will put it on the wire, and it'll go down in
history as the one big event of the year!'</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>He might be fond of Annabel, but he wanted his last half-hour
in Belfayol alone with Hazel. He lured her to their best
caf&eacute;; not the historic castle cave but the tiny new bar
where the wall bench was so bright and red, the iron tables such
shining green, the awning over the sidewalk so sunshine-like a
yellow. Embedded in the glass of the windows was wire in the
shape of stalks and flowers.</p>

<p>'Lord, I hate to skip off and leave you, girl. Will we ever
sit in a foreign saloon again?'</p>

<p>'Oh, we will, and be so close to each other. I regret every
second I've spent away from you; like running off to Bandol with
those silly women this morning.'</p>

<p>'No. Less friction, when we don't tag each other. And now you
just forget me for a while.'</p>

<p>'Maybe.'</p>

<p>'Well . . . By golly, we pulled it off. Didn't we!'</p>

<p>'Yes . . . We did see Europe. Didn't we!'</p>

<p>'Yes . . . And I didn't do so bad. Did I! I wasn't too bad a
greenhorn. Was I!' Fred seemed not too sure about it.'</p>

<p>'Never . . . And I was a good sport. The old folks showed they
could run off together. And I did learn to like Burgundy. Didn't
I!'</p>

<p>'Yes, you bet . . . Golly!'</p>

<p>'Happy?'</p>

<p>'Yes.'</p>

<p>'Oh, be happy!'</p>

<p>So absorbed was he in Hazel, their last half-hour, that when
the young American couple whom he had always wanted to pick up
went swinging by, he nodded to them casually and wasn't even
flattered by their pleased bow in answer.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>On the R.M.S. <i>Sovereign's</i> five-day falcon flight to New
York, Fred spoke to no one but stewards and the inescapable
stranger who interrupted his vigil, again at the forward rail of
the promenade deck, by inquiring, 'Well, how do you like this
weather?'</p>

<p>He was a veteran of travel now; he could have produced
seasoned remarks to the effect that he 'liked it a little rough
like this; then you know you're at sea.' But he barely saw the
friendly greeter, for wavering between them were Howard, Sara,
Hazel, Annabel, Cal Tillery.</p>

<p>He grunted, 'All right, I guess,' and let it go at that.
Beyond the bobbing spectral faces he saw, on the midsea horizon,
a quivering dark bank that must be the Long Island shore, that
must be America.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>Standing at the rail, he tried to work out a philosophy of The
Family. He saw it in sharp-coloured little motion pictures rather
than in definite words, but they might have been translated
thus:</p>

<p>Women have for decades been revolting against the restrictions
of men and the home. Votes. Jobs. Uniforms in 1914-18. Cocktails
they didn't appreciate enough and cigarettes they appreciated too
much. Now the children were revolting; thought their parents were
convenient bores at best, tyrants at worst; children not, as for
centuries past, claiming merely their own just rights in the
household, but domination over it.</p>

<p>Perhaps next would come, perhaps there was already coming,
secret and dangerous, the Revolt of the Men; they would admit how
sick they were of the soft and scented cushions of women, of
women's nervous reminders that pipe ashes didn't belong on the
floor; perhaps they would go off to monasteries and fishing camps
(much the same thing) and leave their wives and children
flat.</p>

<p>If the institution of The Family was to survive at all, if it
possibly could survive, parents would have to stop expecting
children to accept their ideas (but that was a warning even older
than Bernard Shaw). Men and women must expect nothing, nothing
whatever, from each other as of vested right (but that was an
ancient battle, too, though still as little won as when Ibsen was
new and shocking). But beginning about 1914, and each year since
then more violent, there was a growing revolt of parents against
the growing revolt of Youth; a demand that the young Saras and
Howards should regard their parents' houses as something more
than places in which to change clothes before dashing off in
motor cars (dressing-rooms, clothes and cars all provided free,
by the courtesy of the management) to places more
interesting.</p>

<p>But Fred didn't at all advocate the Fascist-Nazi-Bolshevik
system, the naively new and wearisomely antiquated system of
belief that everybody ought to sacrifice himself for everybody
else. He had the opposite faith: that nobody ought to expect any
sacrifice from anybody else, and that (in merely another ten
thousand years or so, if the luck and weather held good) thus
might be ended for ever the old structure, equally practised by
small circles of relatives and by monstrously great nations,
whereby A sacrificed his honest desires on behalf of B, and B
sacrificed for C, and C sacrificed himself violently but
complainingly, all day long, for A, and everybody resented the
whole business and chanted, 'How loyal and unselfish we all
are--curse it!'</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>The sight of the Statue of Liberty was not his chief thrill on
arriving in New York, but rather his first American 'cuppacoffee,
slabapie, &agrave; la mode, please, Sister.'</p>

<p>When he trudged out of the railroad station in Sachem, he was
astonished to see that after this lifetime of five months, in
which the entire world had been changed, Harriman Square seemed
exactly the same. Apparently the cigar stores had unfeelingly
gone on selling cigars without his aid; and the familiar corner
loafers looked at him without interest.</p>

<p>He had telegraphed to Sara--Mrs. Walter Lindbeck--but not to
Howard.</p>

<p>He went up the sandstone steps of what had been his home. But
his tread sounded different on the stones; the doorbell sounded
different and unwelcoming; and the door was opened by a strange
maid who, when he sighed, 'Is Mrs. Lindbeck in?--I'm Mr.
Cornplow,' snapped at him, 'Whajah say your name was?'</p>

<p>In the hallway a new and echoing mirror had replaced the
reproduction of Whistlers' 'Mother'.</p>

<p>But Sara came downstairs affably enough.</p>

<p>'Well, well! Mrs. Lindbeck, by golly!'</p>

<p>She didn't frown.</p>

<p>'Glad to see me, Sara?'</p>

<p>She was placid in her: 'But of course, dear.'</p>

<p>'Forgiven me for sneaking off like that?'</p>

<p>'But you don't need any forgiveness. You were quite right. We
were all getting on your nerves, and your going away was good
both for you and for us--I trust. Oh, I've settled down, and I
hope I've acquired some sense, since I married.'</p>

<p>'Like it?'</p>

<p>'Immensely. Walter is the Rock of Gibraltar, and what's more
important, he's amusing. I do think we're a quite unusually
rational and understanding pair . . . Oh, Inga!' This, sharply
and confidently as a section-gang boss, to the maid, lolloping
about the adjacent dining-room with some notions about dusting.
'Will you kindly be more quiet?'</p>

<p>'Still keeping up your interior-decoration job?'</p>

<p>'But naturally! . . . I mean: I've laid it aside just
temporarily.'</p>

<p>'Now give me the low-down on Howard. I haven't seen him
yet.'</p>

<p>Then did she lose her disciplinary serenity.</p>

<p>'Father! I never want to see him again! After what we did to
get him started! I can't believe he's my brother. He's drunk all
the time, and associating with that disgusting clodhopper, Cal
Tillery. Walter and I did everything we could for him. We gave
him all sorts of good advice, and Walter even offered to take him
into the store, if he'd sign a promise not to drink. We've had to
wash our hands of him. But cheer up, Father dear. You have
<i>one</i> child who's quit boiling and begun to set!'</p>

<p>'Yes--yes--that's fine--that certainly is--it's fine to know
you're happy--certainly is fine--but I feel I ought to try my
hand with Howard.'</p>

<p>'Of course.' She laughed then: 'The only thing I can't figure
out is who's who in your new version of the Fable of the
Prodigal. You're Prodigal Son, obviously, with Mother as
Assistant Prodigal, and I'm the forgiving parents, and I'm afraid
Howard is the swine, with Cal for husks, but who's the fatted
calf, and who's the elder son that got sore?'</p>

<p>He was wincing at her complacent humour. Trying to be
conversational, he interrupted:</p>

<p>'Ever hear from this fellow Silga?'</p>

<p>'Silga?'</p>

<p>'Yes. Sure. You remember. Gene.'</p>

<p>'Oh, <i>him!</i> That rat! I understand he was mixed up in
some auto strike in the West and got arrested, and now he's doing
time. Serves him right.'</p>

<p>'Now, Sara! I don't think that's nice! I never had any reason
to love him, but you got to admire an enemy that's got
nerve.'</p>

<p>'Do you? I wouldn't know. But just as you like, my dear!'</p>

<p>With considerable awkwardness he got himself away from the
assured and masterful Mrs. Lindbeck. He refused her invitation to
stay at the house--his own house, from which he had fled, to
which apparently he could never return--with the lying
explanation that he had arranged to sleep on a couch at
Howard's.</p>

<p>Well, he persuaded himself in the taxicab, for good or ill,
this one child had been set on the way. But there was another
child that needed him, needed him urgently . . . he hoped.</p>

<p> </p>

<h1>CHAPTER XXXIX</h1>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>Howard's flat was a 'second-story walk-up'. The first flight
of the stairs was clean and waxy; the second, littered with
cigarette butts, mud and a dozen milk bottles, some empty and
tumbled on their sides, some full of milk turned sour.</p>

<p>When Fred knocked, from within came a voice, apparently Cal
Tillery's, bawling, 'Ah gwan, beat it!'</p>

<p>Fred walked in. The living-room, which Annabel had kept sweet
as a new moon, was like a junk shop. Middle of the floor lay a
glass lamp, smashed, with its vellum shade dented, and beside it,
Annabel's volume of Yeats, with the cover torn off. Cal Tillery,
in undershirt and trousers, happily waving a cigarette, lay on
Annabel's chaise-longue, upon a woolly afghan (she had knitted
it). Beside Cal was a highball on a low maple table, in the
middle of which a cigarette had burned itself out. The charred
paper and ashes still outlined its corpse.</p>

<p>Nailed to the wall with an ice pick was a photograph of
Annabel's father, the beard daubed red with a coloured
pencil.</p>

<p>Cal looked up cheerfully. 'Hello, Cousin Freddie! Who let you
out? So they wouldn't keep you in Europe heh?'</p>

<p>Fred took an appreciable time in walking over to him. His
voice was low. 'Get out. Quick.'</p>

<p>'What's your hurry? Have a drink?'</p>

<p>Fred's voice was not so low now. 'Quick, I said!'</p>

<p>'Give a fellow time to put his shoes on, can't you?'</p>

<p>Fred looked about for the shoes. They had been placed,
carefully ranged side by side, on Annabel's baby-grand piano,
which her mother had given to her when she was ten. Cal's straw
hat and coat were dumped on the floor. Fred picked up shoes, hat,
coat, and threw them out into the hall.</p>

<p>He was thirty years older than Cal, and small and fat and
unexercised. He stooped over Cal, his plump hands making clawing
motions. He must have looked mad.</p>

<p>'I said--quick!'</p>

<p>'All right--all right--keep your shirt on--Freddie!' But Cal
was staggering out, as he said it.</p>

<p>Howard could be heard groaning, 'Oh, what's all racket?' from
the bedroom.</p>

<p>Before Fred went to him, he looked over the
kitchen-dining-room. There was not one plate or glass left in the
cupboard; a pile of dishes, smeared with egg yolk, bacon grease
and burned toast crumbs, tottered on the dish slide. In the sink
were a dishpan full of greasy water, the smashed ruin of a glass
coffee percolator and the slowly perishing shred of a cake of
expensive hand-soap. The roller towel, behind the door, was
streaked with black.</p>

<p>Fred marched into the bedroom. Howard, in pyjamas, the top
unbuttoned over his woolly red chest, lay flat on the bed,
groaning, trying to stroke his wet and blazing forehead. A whisky
bottle was snugly tilted on the pillow beside his cheek.</p>

<p>With pain he lifted his reeking, tousled head and stared.</p>

<p>'Oh, hello. It's Dad, ain't it? I know! You came back from
Europe!' His drivelling triumph at this recognition he
interrupted with the surly demand: 'Where's Cal?'</p>

<p>'He's gone out.'</p>

<p>Howard wept with self-pity. 'You get him back, ri' 'way. Cal's
best of the wholy cranky lot. Only one that never asks me to do
anything don't want to. Family always after me to hustle an' do
something. Howard--wash your fool neck! Howard--don't ever stop
on the street and be nice to folks, because you got to be in the
repair shop at eight sharp! Howard--curse you, now appreciate
this highbrow music I'm playing! Howard--quit laughing and get
busy and make a million dollars, even if you don't want a million
dollars! Howard--don't smoke, don't drink, don't play poker,
don't kiss that hat-check girl, don't skip dumb classes, don't
drive over thirty miles an hour, don't ever laugh! . . . Cal's
the only one lets me be a roustabout, which what--what--that's
what naturally am! Only one lets me be!'</p>

<p>He closed his eyes, exhausted by his oration.</p>

<p>Fred stood by him, unspeaking. With a shock he realized that
there was much to what the boy had said.</p>

<p>Howard reared up, looking ugly, and scolding, 'You send Cal in
now! I don't want to talk to you. I won't talk to you till Cal
comes in . . . Cal! Oh, Cal! Hey! Come on in here!'</p>

<p>'Howard, for a start, I'm afraid you'll have to get used to
doing without Cal. I've chased him out of here--for keeps.'</p>

<p>'You did? Well, blast and damn you, then! And you can chase
yourself out, too. Get out and stay out!'</p>

<p>Feverishly Howard had bundled himself out of bed. He loomed
far above his father. He swayed, but his eyes--not his eyes, but
the eyes of the evil leering thing within him--were murderous. He
reached back, stooping a little, and fumbled for the whisky
bottle on the pillow. As he shakily raised it, Fred hit him,
clean and hard, on the point of the chin.</p>

<p>Howard tumbled on the bed, threshed, tried to rise again,
whimpered like a little hurt dog and passed out.</p>

<p>Fred drew up a chair and sat watching him, too profoundly
troubled to think anything tangible. Presently he rose,
creakingly, and began to bustle.</p>

<p>In the bathroom there wasn't a clean towel. Fred rinsed out a
soiled one and carefully wiped Howard's sweating forehead, the
back of his neck, his wrists.</p>

<p>Howard slept on.</p>

<p>Fred began on the kitchen. Swiftly, not very competently, he
scraped the dirty dishes into the garbage pail, washed them, put
them away. Meantime he had telephoned to a laundry, to a clothes
presser, and when the runners came, he gave out all of Howard's
garments that he could round up, for cleaning by special
twelve-hour service.</p>

<p>He telephoned for coffee, cream, eggs, a percolator. He
scrubbed the kitchen floor, painfully down on his plump knees,
the small of his back stinging. By now he was in shirt sleeves,
his hair tousled, his cheeks smutty, and when the messengers came
in answer to his telephoning, they looked as suspiciously at him
as he had looked at his son.</p>

<p>When he heard Howard groaning he shambled in to give the boy
hot black coffee and aspirin; shaved him as well as he could;
combed his hair. He said nothing at all the while. Howard looked
at him gratefully, got out a hoarse 'Sorry, Dad,' and went back
to sleep.</p>

<p>Fred telephoned a cable (deferred!) to Hazel:</p>

<p> </p>

<blockquote>
<p>HOWARD OKAY PLANNING JOB FOR HIM AM WRITING LOVE YOU HAPPY
QUESTION</p>
</blockquote>

<p> </p>

<p>He had just sent it when Sara telephoned:</p>

<p>'Father? I was so nasty about Howard when you were here.
Please forgive me. Kind of upset about him, and I guess I was
trying to hide it or something. It was a dirty mean trick of me
to take it out on you, darling!'</p>

<p>Then Fred rejoiced, 'Hallelujah! Now let's see what a dumb
worker can do with the other child.'</p>

<p>Wearily he began to clean the living-room.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>Whether many of the things he did for Howard were wise, is not
to be known. One was intelligent; as soon as the flat was clean
enough so that the Cornplows could face the world, he sent out
for a cook, a powerful coloured woman, and began to feed the
young man.</p>

<p>Since Howard was no old and conditioned alcoholic, Fred
guessed (as he set up in rivalry to Dr. Janissary as domestic
psychiatrist) that it would be injurious to fix his attention too
much on alcohol by drastically forbidding it. He let him have
three or four, later one or two, drinks a day, and with no great
pleasure shared them with him.</p>

<p>For three days Howard slept most of the time between meals, in
the secure feeling that his father was there, not going to nag
him, ready to give anything and forgive everything.</p>

<p>Not even on the two steamers, since there he had by his
tension been helping push them forward to a destination, had Fred
devoted so many unclocked, eternal-seeming hours to meditation on
the one question that is of moment: Why are we here in life? What
is its purpose?</p>

<p>He persuaded himself that he had to know something of the
answer before he could do anything for Howard; before he could
determine whether it was his business, or merely an impertinence,
to 'do anything' for Howard at all.</p>

<p>Like every other philosopher since time was, greybeard in a
hermitage of old, or parachute-jumper with two seconds for
contemplation before pulling the rip cord, he gave up trying to
master the question entire. But he did work out a comforting
notion or two, and the first was that he had in all his life done
nothing so important as to cease completely the bustling which
had given him his little distinction as a citizen, and let life
itself work on him.</p>

<p>If it be doubted that a Fred Cornplow would evolve a
philosophy, it may be answered that the Fred Cornplows are great
men, but most of them do not have the disastrous good fortune of
sitting for many quiet hours beside a heartsick son, after having
for five months sat, ineffectual and alone, by caf&eacute; tables
in strange lands, and do not, thus, often ask: what is a Fred
Cornplow that he too should live, along with such divine
creatures as the humming-bird and the shark?</p>

<p>He perceived that his purpose in life had not been, as usually
he had believed, to sell motor cars or handy household gadgets.
Yet such selling was not, as the professors and communists would
have it, trivial. It had demanded diplomacy, patience, ingenuity,
faith that cars are worth having.</p>

<p>He worked away, also, at another notion:</p>

<p>Howard had been reared to demand, not that he be permitted to
train his eyes and memory and chest muscles, but that he have,
without passionate struggle, all the material richness of a
medieval emperor: a palace small but luxuriously heated, a
chariot which could gallop at eighty miles an hour, a magic
device whereby he could talk to fellow potentates five thousand
miles away.</p>

<p>Could he teach himself, then teach Howard, a vision of
self-mastery?</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>Fred came out of his dreaming with a dismaying snap.</p>

<p>'Can any father do much of anything--that is, permanently--for
any son? Golly! Not even sure I can make him see he's got to
start at the bottom and build, because if I did have the gift of
gab, like Doc Janissary, when I got all through my lecture,
Howard would say, "Sure, I get you, but fellow has to show some
class and be up to date, these days, hasn't he?" But anyway, even
if I can't actually help him much, maybe by trying to I can keep
my own doggone self from withering too much.'</p>

<p>What, definitely, ought he to do with Howard till the boy was
ready to run on his own feet?</p>

<p>The normal thing, free of all fancy romantic ideas, would be
to start him off in the Triumph agency again. But a new world
would for a little while, suggest new thoughts. In strange lands,
Fred hoped he himself had at least learned to be alone and lonely
without whimpering.</p>

<p>Take Howard with him to Europe? No; let Annabel rest there.
And it looked now, in all the news from Russia, Spain, Germany,
Italy, as though the wise old nations of Europe that so despised
America's rawness were going to devote their ten thousand years
of culture to butchering one another again.</p>

<p>He thought of the Whitefall River, in Canada, where he had
once gone fishing. Even if it did nothing to turn Howard from an
easy-going young gentleman into a stalwart hero, so dependable
that he might some day become assistant to the assistant to the
first vice-president of a chewing-gum factory, at least the
sweating on the hot trail through the pines, the cold searing
plunge afterward, and the chill still nights would in themselves
be glorious living.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<h1>CHAPTER XL</h1>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>Howard laughed. Of late he had been more given to laughing.
They were making the last portage, about Little Run Rapids,
before returning to their permanent camp on the river and to the
supper for which they had been longing this past hour. The
portage was a gash between thick spruce, close as a closet, hot,
lively with mosquitoes which jabbed at the sun-sore backs of
their necks. The edges of the upturned canoe bit into their
unaccustomed shoulders as they toted it, and their arms ached
with the burden of blankets, paddles and cooking kit.</p>

<p>When they came out again on the river bank, with the sun
glaring on rippling river, the sand flies pounced on them.</p>

<p>So Howard laughed. 'Certainly a swell idea to come three
hundred miles to get your neck chewed and have your shoulders
feel like they'd been through a clothes wringer!'</p>

<p>'Like it?' grunted Fred.</p>

<p>'Sure. As Mother would say: "Happy!"'</p>

<p>Their tent awaited them on the river bank, at the edge of an
unknown country of jack pine, spruce and birch, through which the
only highway was the Whitefall; it was not three hundred but
three thousand miles removed from the clatter and contacts of
Sachem. The world well lost, thought Fred. His son was ruddy
again, and confident, and for three weeks now had lived in
company with a whisky flask, without touching it.</p>

<p>Fred was certain now that the boy was neither an alcoholic nor
cruel, but the victim of confused marriage and confused jobs in a
confused world.</p>

<p>Fred was camp cook, and he celebrated their return that
evening, by not merely frying bacon, with steaks of the lake
trout and muskallonge they had caught at Lake Dead Man, but
adding the inexpressible luxury of prunes. They gobbled; silent,
content.</p>

<p>Howard stretched out luxuriously afterward, his head against a
stump, droning:</p>

<p>'You ought to be head of the Boy Scouts. You sure were a great
little inspiration this afternoon.'</p>

<p>'Well, what's the daily insult now?'</p>

<p>'Funny enough, I mean it! Seeing an old coot like you, the way
you sweat at paddling and didn't give up when you looked ready to
drop, I got ashamed of how lazy I am.'</p>

<p>'Thinking about starting in with the Triumph Agency
again?'</p>

<p>'I'd like to. I'd like to really learn it, so some day,
possibly, I might succeed you . . . if you thought, then, I'd
made good.'</p>

<p>'Fine. Like to look at my book on internal-combustion engines
now?'</p>

<p>'Be glad to.'</p>

<p>That was all there was of the camp meeting and the mourners'
bench.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>In the tent, by candlelight, sitting on his folded sleeping
bag with a suit-case on his knees for desk, Fred was trying to
answer Hazel's anxious query from Paris:</p>

<p> </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Aren't you coming back to join me, or shall I sail for home,
whichever you think best. This is a lovely city, we would enjoy
it so much here and Annabel is the nicest companion but not
without you. Your loving Hazel.</p>
</blockquote>

<p> </p>

<p>For half an hour he had been inspired, and he had reached the
climactic point in composition where almost everything he had
written had been crossed out. He was not used to letters like
this. Most of his epistles home, all these years, had confined
themselves to: business good, hope you are all well, as is Yrs
Truly.</p>

<p>But now he had painfully achieved:</p>

<p> </p>

<blockquote>
<p>You stay in Europe, see some more of London as well as Paris,
etc. etc., as long as you want to. In this family we never did
have much compulsion, us over the kids, you and me over each
other, and if maybe it has not entirely worked out O.K. always I
think children beginning to appreciate it and everything going to
be swell. And hope you and I will start off again some day. But
now it don't seem to matter like it did when I used to talk about
golden road to Samarkand and when we got near there, Istanbul,
etc. etc., wasn't the smell fierce in that market place! It seems
to me now that it isn't going where you want to that is freedom,
but knowing that you can go.</p>
</blockquote>

<p> </p>

<p>That was all the high creative effort he could endure for the
time. He wiped his brow, said, 'Whew,' killed a mosquito and
crawled out through the netting to squat beside his son.</p>

<p>Howard observed, 'Do you hear something like an outboard
motor, 'way off down the river? Wonder why they got one. Must be
fierce job to tote it round the rapids.'</p>

<p>Yes. Fred could hear, like a rapidly beaten carpet, the
exhaust of the motor. What tenderfoot would use it in these
waters? He listened nervously. He felt that, unexplainably, it
was coming for him.</p>

<p>The canoe, a big nineteen-foot freighter, had rounded a bend.
Its small headlight, probably a camp flashlight fastened to the
bow, illuminated the wrinkled, tumbling brown water, the wash of
current about rocks sticking out of the river like the backs of
seals, and ashore, the fallen and rotted log-cabin of a trapper,
in a grove of willow and scrub pine. It seemed to be heading for
their camp fire.</p>

<p>The two men by the tent muttered, 'What's the idea?' and
'Don't believe there's any bad Indians left along the river, but
maybe if they'd got hold of some liquor . . .'</p>

<p>The canoe darted in to shore, well guided. They could make out
a tall Indian in the bow, and behind him, nothing but a blurry
mass. The blurry mass arose, crawled forward, edged past the
Indian, stepped cautiously ashore. And the blurry mass was Hazel
Cornplow, plus two blankets and man's felt hat.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>'But where is Annabel? Where? Where?' begged Howard.</p>

<p>'I left her in Paris, dear, to study a little there. She's
such a darling. I've become so fond of her. Imagine! Once I was
almost jealous of her! Silly. And the baby seems to be thriving.
It's the huskiest little mite you ever saw. My! He grabs your
finger and almost breaks it in two. And his smile, I declare,
it's exactly like yours when you were a little tad, Howard.'</p>

<p>'But Annabel! Is she coming back? I want her!'</p>

<p>'I thought--it's hard to say, Howard, but I thought she ought
to stay away until you earn her.'</p>

<p>'Hm. Man earn his own wife? Well, maybe it isn't such a sour
idea. It'll be something to work for!'</p>

<p>Later Hazel purred, 'My, I didn't know we three would all be
together again, sitting cosy on a blanket and eating bacon! Isn't
it nice here! No telephones ringing.'</p>

<p>'Practically never,' Fred assured her.</p>

<p>'And Fred: I don't want to be too light-footed, but some day
would you like to go travelling again? I would so like to see
Scandinavia, if they don't manage to have a war in Europe,
and--oh, not make a business of wandering, like these silly
restless tourists, but just see a <i>few</i> places, say like
Brazil and Egypt and Cairo and Java and Iceland and so on. What
do you think<i>,</i> Fred?'</p>

<p>'I don't know yet. Say, here's a hot one! Right there in the
tent I've got a letter about it that I was writing to you.
Yessir, by golly, just this minute. I'll tell you, dear. Just now
I feel like I ought to stick around a while and . . .'</p>

<p>Then Howard took charge; the Howard of old, cocky and
omniscient, yet more affectionate than the old Howard had ever
been:</p>

<p>'Now you're not looking at it right, Dad. Way I see it, you
old codgers ought to get out more and learn how the world is
changing. I tell you, you haven't any idea what the young fellows
are doing, these days, Dad. There's nobody like you for
steadiness, but you ought to take a chance once in a while.'</p>

<p>'Indeed you ought to,' said Hazel.</p>

<p>'I see,' said Frederick William Cornplow. 'Say! In Brazil we
ought to get doggone good coffee. Well, you can sit up and talk
till sunrise if you want to, but the old man's going to turn in.
I hear where there's good coffee in Egypt, too. We'll see. Good
night--good night!'</p>
