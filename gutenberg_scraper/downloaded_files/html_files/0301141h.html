<h3>PREFACE</h3>
<p>This volume deals with only a portion of the exploration of the Southern
Continent and is not intended to be a complete history of Australian discovery.
I have endeavoured, however, to relate in addition to the better-known
discoveries, many important voyages and surveys which have been less frequently
described and in many cases I have left the explorer to tell the story of his
adventures in his own words.</p>
<p>Throughout the various chapters I have tried to trace the first arrival of
English ships on the west coast, the trend of maritime exploration on the north
and north-west coasts from the days of Dampier down to King, the surveys of
Cook and of his successors on the east coast, the rediscovery of Moreton Bay,
the finding of Port Phillip, and the circumnavigation and settlement of
Tasmania.</p>
<p>The book also deals with certain inland discoveries from the time of the
landing of Governor Phillip in New South Wales until Allan Cunningham had begun
his exploration of Queensland. These include the expeditions of Caley, Evans,
and all those who struck out westward across the Blue Mountains, and I have
dealt with them as constituting a prelude to Cunninghain's journal, in order to
show in whose footsteps Cunningham followed and to indicate the extent of the
colony at the time of his arrival there.</p>
<p>Allan Cunningham was a Kew botanist who became also famous as an explorer.
It would be difficult to say in which field of enterprise he won most renown.
The collections of new plants and seeds that he sent and brought home from the
most distant shores of Australasia were hardly surpassed by those made by
Robert Brown, and with regard to Cunningham's explorations we find that
historians to-day place him in the very front rank of discoverers of the
Southern Continent.</p>
<p>It was not until after he had journeyed as botanist with Oxley's party into
the interior of New South Wales in 1817, and had traversed bush and mountain
and beheld the wide rivers winding inland that the desire to study anything
beyond the flora of the country entered his mind. In his accounts of his
journey with Oxley one can trace how he gradually came to listen to "the call
of the wild," and by looking at the map of Australia of those early days it is
possible to gauge to some extent the fascination that tempted him. He must have
seen the great spaces left blank on that map, but whether mountains, plains,
lakes, or rivers lay there none could tell, for the spaces were unexplored
territory that no traveller had ever crossed. In the map they surround the
small colony at Port Jackson, then ruled by Governor Macquarie, and spread over
nearly the whole continent.</p>
<p>Even where fresh discoveries across the Blue Mountains had been made up to
1814 a single line suffices to show how far Europeans had been able to advance
into the Unknown.</p>
<p>The days, then, which followed Cunningham's coming to the colony were
glorious days, appealing to men of spirit and courage to blaze a road through
country where no civilized man had yet been, and to learn whether it possessed
the features of grass and water absolutely necessary if civilization was to be
drawn from the small settlements near the coast into the heart of the
continent.</p>
<p>How nobly Cunningham responded to the call is well known--perhaps by none
better than by those who live in the townships along the route that he toiled
so earnestly to discover, many of which are even now only just springing up.
How, without neglecting the duties connected with his post as King's Botanist,
he wrested from the land the knowledge of its mountain-passes, its fine rivers,
its rich pastures, it has been my humble endeavour to make known afresh in the
present volume, in which his journal, here first printed in full, is the
special feature.</p>
<p>After a careful study of his letters, of his journal, and of his reports
(extant in England) I have come to the conclusion that Cunningham himself would
have preferred to be best remembered as a botanist. For this reason I decided
to give some account of his botanical researches. Botany being an entirely new
study to me, in dealing with the names of the plants and flowers of Australia
mentioned by Cunningham. I have had the assistance of Mr. N. E. Brown, A.L.S.,
who has kindly given me most able help and advice.</p>
<p>Cunningham's manuscripts are to be found in the Libraries of the Botanical
Departments of the Natural History Museum at South Kensington and at Kew, and I
beg to thank the authorities of both Libraries for their courtesy in permitting
me to transcribe them.</p>
<p>With regard to my own story of Cunningham's explorations I can only add that
I had proposed writing of them in a different manner from that which I have
adopted, but owing to illness continually hampering my efforts I have been
unable to carry out my original intentions. I therefore trust that in due
course an abler writer will deal with what I have omitted and do Cunningharn's
memory the justice it so richly deserves.</p>
<p>To all who have helped me in various ways to complete this work I offer my
sincere and grateful thanks; had it not been for their aid the book could not
have been produced in its entirety. To the Librarians of the various English
Libraries, of the Sydney Public Library, and of the Mitchell Library, Sydney, I
wish to express my gratitude for their valuable assistance. To Mr. Henry
Selkirk of the Royal Australian Historical Society I am greatly indebted for
his examination of Allan Cunningham's journal and Field Books, preserved in
Sydney, and for comparing Cunningham's maps there with those of modern
geographers. I also wish to thank Mr. C. H. Bertie, F.R.A.H.S., for permitting
me to reproduce the illustrations of Cook's Landing-place and of the brass
tablet at Kurnell, previously published by him and I desire to acknowledge Mr.
Kashnor's kindness in allowing me to reprint some rare charts in his collection
of those made by Dalrymple which I had not met with elsewhere.</p>

<h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>
<p>From the earliest dawn of Australia's history the beautiful flora and
singular fauna of the country have appealed to discoverers and naturalists. Yet
the old Dutch voyagers who first came to the Great South Land collected few
specimens of what they found there, and apparently no record exists of any of
the country's natural productions having reached Europe until long after the
names of Eendracht Land, Dedel's Land, and the Land of the Leeuwin were
engraved upon the maps of the world.[*]</p>
<blockquote>[* Heeres says: In 1605 Jansz surveyed the cast coast of the Gulf
of Carpentaria as far as about 13&deg;45'S. In the year 1616 the Dutch ship
'Eendracht,' commanded by Dirk Hartog, on her voyage from the Cape of Good Hope
to Batavia...for the first time surveyed part of the west coast of Australia.
As early as 1619 this coast was known by the name of Eendracht Land, and
Dedel's Land (called after a sea captain named Jacob Dedel) was made in July,
1619, and appeared in the charts of 1627." The same writer observes: "Dedel's
Land is bounded by the Land of the Leeuwin, surveyed in 1622. (See "Part Borne
by the Dutch in the Discovery of Australia."--J. E. Heeres.)]</blockquote>
<p>According to Labillardi&egrave;re, the first specimens of any kind to reach
Holland from New Holland were two shells which had been given to Burgomaster
Witsen of Amsterdam in 1698 by a sea captain in the service of the Dutch East
India Company. This was William Vlamingh, who had visited Western Australia in
the previous year; and, in a letter to Dr. Lister of the Royal Society Witsen
says "he found them on the seaside, and I make bold to send you the draught of
them, the shells themselves being twice as long and as broad as the draught."
He adds the courteous message "I could not bestow them better than on one who
hath the best knowledge of these and all other sea products." A description of
the shells, with illustrations, was afterwards published in Lister's "Synopsis
Conchyliorum "--one being the first nautilus,[*] the other then named the
<i>Concha persica clavicula radiata.</i></p>
<blockquote>[* <i>Nautilus pompilius.</i>]</blockquote>
<p>The Burgomaster's letter mentions other curiosities seen by Vlamingh in the
new land, among them black swans, three of which were caught and taken to
Batavia, but shortly afterwards died there; and on an island near the coast
were "rats as great as cats which had a kind of bag or purse hanging from the
throat downwards." On this account the Dutch gave the name of Rottennest[*] to
the island and called the river where the swans were taken the Swan River.</p>
<blockquote>[* Rats' Nest. The rats were a species of kangaroo
rat.]</blockquote>
<p>There were found also "many well-scented trees, and out of the wood is to be
drawn oil smelling as the rose." A small bottle of it was distilled at Batavia
and sent to the Directors of the Dutch East India Company at Amsterdam, which
appear to prove that the eucalyptus first yielded its oil to the Dutch.</p>
<p>Soon after Witsen's letter had reached Dr. Lister, William Dampier brought
home his collection of dried plants, including many gathered in Western
Australia. Dampier had twice visited that country: he was there before
Vlamingh, on his voyage with the buccaneers in the ship "Cygnet" of London
under Captain Read, entering on January 5, 1688 what is now called Cygnet Bay,
and he was there in 1699 in the "Roebuck," of which vessel he was in
command;[*] and after Dampier's return from this voyage in 1702 more than ever
before was known in England concerning the South Land.</p>
<blockquote>[* After leaving Australia on his first voyage Dampier quarrelled
with Captain Read and quitted the "Cygnet" at Nicobar. He made his way to
Sumatra and reached England in 1691. Having been brought under the notice of
King William III by the Earl of Pembroke, he was placed in command of Roebuck,"
an Admiralty ship, and sent on a second voyage of discovery.]</blockquote>
<p>In the journal of his first voyage Dampier mentions New Holland several
times before he is able to record that he has seen it. First of all, at the
Ladrones he had been told by experienced seamen that ships bound to Java from
the Cape of Good Hope often found themselves, and sometimes to their cost, on
the shoals off New Holland; ships had been known to run aground there when
their navigators thought that they were a great way from it, as to which
Dampier remarks: "Hence possibly the Dutch call that part of the coast the Land
of Indraught, as if it magnetically drew ships to it." In this, however,
Dampier assigns a meaning of his own to the word Eendracht, which the Dutch had
bestowed upon a part of Western Australia; for we know that the land was named
in honour of the ship "Eendracht," the word itself meaning, in Dutch, "union"
or "concord."</p>
<p>He mentions New Holland again after the ship had passed Timor, and, being
uncertain as to what was the form or shape of the country he was about to land
in, he describes it as "a part of Terra Australis Incognita." When he reached a
shoal off the coast, he complained that it was laid down too far to the
north-ward in the Dutch charts, and after the "Cygnet" rounded what is now
known as Cape L&eacute;v&ecirc;que and anchored a league to the eastward of its
shores, on January 5, 1688, he gave this account of the country:</p>
<p>"New Holland is a very large tract of land. It is not yet determined whether
it is an island or a continent, but I am certain that it joins neither to Asia,
Africa, nor America."</p>
<p>Dampier wrote boldly; for, although early in the seventeenth century the
Dutch had made discoveries on the north and west coasts, in 1606 Torres had
sailed through the strait now known by his name, in 1627 Peter Nuyts had
crossed the Australian Bight to Nuyts' Archipelago off the south coast, and in
1642 Tasman had discovered the shores of both Tasmania and New Zealand, yet
nothing was known of the eastern or south-eastern coasts, and a multitude of
geographers still believed the old fables that Australia was included within
the boundaries of the vast Terra Australis Incognita, the imaginary Antarctic
continent supposed to cover the whole of the southern portion of both the
eastern and western hemispheres--an idea founded on the ancient theory that a
southern continent was needed to maintain the equilibrium of the globe.</p>
<p>In the western hemisphere the southern continent was believed to join Tierra
del Fuego or Magellanica (South America), and in the eastern hemisphere it was
thought to stretch as far north as New Guinea, while its southern boundary ran
as far south as the Pole itself. So firmly was this idea fixed in the minds of
the most learned men that it had become difficult to eradicate it, and we find
this imaginary continent portrayed in maps of the world up to the time of
Dampier's coming to Australia.[*]</p>
<blockquote>[* P. du Val, in his World Map of 1674, in order to show the Dutch
discoveries in Australia, makes a sharp break in the outline of the imaginary
continent, but he still keeps New Zealand as one of its promontories--part of a
territory whose coast-line ran southward till it almost reached the southern
extremity of South America; and Tasmania was thought to be another part of
it.]</blockquote>
<p>Points of this vast land had been identified and named by European seamen
and others, the most familiar names given tc the various parts being Beach or
Locach and Maletur--names handed down since the time of Marco Polo--Terra di
Vista, Brasiliae Regio, Psittacorum Regio, or the Land of Parrots, in the
eastern, and, contiguous to Tierra del Fuego Regio Patalis and Regio
Magellanica in the western hemisphere.</p>
<p>By far the oldest portion of the Terra Australis was the land of Beach or
Cape Beach. It was the title given to a tract of country in Northern Australia
in the neighbourhood of Arnhem Land, while the old name Regio Patalis (the
region of Patala at the mouth of the Indus) was bestowed at different periods
upon various parts of the vast continent; Terra di Vista was another ancient
name for land in 42&deg; S. lat., of which nothing was known except that "it
was 450 leagues from the Cape of Good Hope." Buache, the French geographer, is
best remembered for the memoir he published in 1763 (only five years before
Cook sailed on his first voyage), in which he enumerates the names appearing on
the maps of Terra Australis, or, as he calls it, Terra Antarctica. In writing
of Terra di Vista, Buache points out that "on Mercator's Great Chart published
in 1569 (and on Wytfliet's Of 1597) there is also marked in these latitudes the
great Gulf of St. Sebastian[*] and an island called Cressalina," "of which," he
adds, "there is a MS. map in the collection of the Marshal
d'Estr&egrave;es"...Buache's memoir was regarded as an important work at the
time of its publication, so much so that afterwards it was reprinted by
Alexander Dalrymple, hydrographer at the Admiralty, who possessed a wonderful
knowledge of old and rare charts, and who collected valuable information
respecting the tracks of vessels which were the first to sail among the islands
and shoals of the Pacific and especially among those around the Australian</p>
<blockquote>[* Not to be confused with the channel of that name in Tierra del
Fuego.]</blockquote>
<p>To return to the Gulf of St. Sebastian. Although Buache did not himself give
its position as being near or off Australia, he believed that it was not far
from Terra di Vista. Now, how-ever, it is thought that in all probability what
he referred to as Terra di Vista was a portion of Western Australia, since it
was placed to the south of the Cape of Good Hope and no land exists in the
position assigned to it upon the maps themselves.</p>
<p>Cook was aware of the importance attached by geographers to the rediscovery
of the Gulf of St. Sebastian, and as the Dutch formerly had given orders to
their seamen to look for Cape Beach, so in like manner Cook was instructed to
search for this gulf. The "Resolution" and the "Adventure" both looked for it,
and we even find Dr. Solander, on his return to England in 1774, mentioning it
in a letter to a friend when thus describing Furneaux's homeward voyage:[*] "He
[Furneaux] sailed directly south from New Zealand till he came into lat.
55&deg; and between that and 60&deg; continued his course eastward...looking
for St. Sebastian's Land and for Cape Circumcision, but arrived the 18th March
last at the Cape of Good Hope without having seen an inch of new land...He has
proved that there is no southern continent and that the French discoveries are
small islands instead of continents; or perhaps, as my friend Omai calls ice,
'things that the sun drives away or causes to vanish.'"</p>
<blockquote>[* Solander to Ellis, "Correspondence of Linnaeus," Vol. II, p.
17.]</blockquote>
<p>On hearing that Cook did not find the Gulf of St. Sebastian, Dalrymple
remarked that he should have looked for it in the eastern and not in the
western hemisphere;[*] and possibly Dalrymple, although his theory regarding
the existence of a huge southern continent was disproved, possessed evidence
relating to the discovery of the gulf which has not been handed down to us. The
remark at least raises a question as to where Dalrymple expected that Cook
would find this gulf. We only know that upon some ancient maps, as for example
on Wytfliet's of the continent of Terra Australis, 1597 (Map 1), there appears
on its southern shores a wide opening (not unlike the real Spencer Gulf of
early Australian maps) which bears the name of Golfo S. Sebastiano, and to the
eastward of this is another river-like opening in front of which is an island
called Cressalina. If we follow the coast-line of the continent round to the
westward we come to another part of it named Psittacorum Regio, and this, in
the opinion of competent authorities, was in fact Western Australia. Opposite
Psittacorum Regio, or the Land of Parrots, and at a short distance from it,
looms the Cape of Good Hope, but, judging from the position of Java Major to
the northward and the Pacific Ocean to the eastward, the outlines of the Cape
are even more out of their proper place on the map than are those of Western
Australia.</p>
<blockquote>[* Many believed that the gulf would be found in the western
hemisphere, and Thomas Kitchin, the well-known geographer, in banishing the
imaginary Terra Australis from his maps after Cook's return from his researches
still retained a small portion of the land bearing the name of the Gulf of St.
Sebastian, which he places to the south-east of the Falkland Islands--a little
to the westward of where Ortelius had placed it on his map in
1587.]</blockquote>
<p>In spite of the fact, too, that in this map the Gulf of St. Sebastian seems
to have its origin a few miles from the South Pole, or that portions of Terra
Australis are laid down within the limits of the Antarctic Circle, and that to
the south-eastward the land shows no sign of ending, it seems to convey the
impression of being an authentic discovery of Australia. Its eastern shores are
bounded by the Pacific; New Guinea is shown as an island, and Beach on the
north part is face to face with the island of Java Major. The text which was
published with it gives this description: "The Australis Terra is the most
southern of all lands. It is separated from New Guinea by a narrow strait. Its
shores are little known, since after one voyage and another that route has been
deserted and seldom is the country visited unless when sailors are driven there
by storms. The Australis Terra begins 2 or 3 degrees from the Equator and is
maintained...to be of so great an extent that if it were thoroughly explored it
would be regarded as a fifth part of the world."</p>
<p>No great land south of the Equator excepting Australia answers to this
description of Terra Australis, and, as Dalrymple believed the Gulf of St.
Sebastian would be found in the eastern hemisphere, it would seem that he must
have regarded the land on whose southern shores its name is inscribed, not as
the huge imaginary continent supposed to spread over the southern portions of
both hemispheres and to encircle the South Pole, but as a smaller continent
confined within the limits of the eastern hemisphere, which could have been no
other land than Australia.</p>
<p>It is probable that Europeans visited this continent even before the Dutch
discovered portions of it. Witness the Portu-guese word "Abrolhos" on early sea
charts, the name Terra del Zur on many old maps, and the rock carvings, found
by Sir George Grey in Western Australia, one figure among them being garbed as
a priest. These carvings apparently were the work of shipwrecked people who
took up their abode in caves. The countenance of one man engraved in the rock
shows that they were Europeans: they do not appear to be connected with any
Dutch visit, and it is thought that they were survivors either of a French or a
Portuguese ship, long since lost on these shores, of which no traces have been
found. There is the story too, that Spanish ringbolts have been discovered in
Sydney Harbour, which, if really true, would prove that this side of the
continent also was visited. While controversy usually attends the finding of
any signs of the presence of Europeans on the mainland at an early date, the
knowledge that more than one old map showing Terra Australis bear dates prior
to the arrival of the Dutch is sufficient to justify the belief that Australia
was discovered before the beginning of the seventeenth century.[*]</p>
<blockquote>[* The wooden globe of Paris, one of the most famous geographical
records extant, made about the year 1535, bears an outline of a continent in
the far south, having inscribed upon it the legend: "Terra Australis recenter
inventa, Anno 1499. Another inscription of a similar nature appears upon the
map of Oronc&eacute; Fin&eacute; (1531), only omitting the date of discovery.
In a work by Francis Monarchus entitled "De Orbis Situ," a small map bears a
similar notice, and in the text of the book the date of discovery is set down
as 1526. Vopellio's map, 1556, adheres to 1499 as the correct date. From this
time forward cosmographers of different periods seem to have had no doubts
concerning the authentic discovery of the South Land, although they could not
agree in their methods of delineating its outline.]</blockquote>
<p>Other geographers award the honour of discovery to the Malays, who came to
fish for trepang on the north and north-west coasts. Both Flinders and King
when surveying those shores met with their proas, and it is said that they had
fished there for centuries. And probably if one race of mankind outside its
native inhabitants can claim to have had the earliest knowledge of Northern
Australia, that race would be the Malays. They are said originally to have
inhabited Palembang and the banks of the River Malayu in Sumatra and to have
migrated thence about the end of the twelfth century to the south-east
extremity of the opposite peninsula, where they built the ancient town of
Singapore and afterwards that of Malacca (though the name Malaya was applied to
the peninsula many ages before). Some of the Malays, especially the traders of
Celebes, lost sight of their coasts and pushed out on the open seas, directing
their course by the position of the stars and sometimes by the aid of a
compass. (At what time they came into possession of this seaman's guide is
conjectural, although it was thought to have been introduced from China.) A
voyage as far southward as Melville Island or Admiralty Gulf would have been
quite an easy matter for their fleets.</p>
<p>But turning from the mists of tradition to the clear light of written
history, the fact that the Portuguese and Spanish first made charts of
Australia carly in the sixteenth century would show that at that time they must
have gained some definite knowledge of its coast-line. So jealously, however,
did these two nations guard the secrets of their voyages and charts that no
records of their discoveries have been handed down to us. It may be significant
in this connexion that Wytfliet's map was dedicated to the King of Spain.</p>
<p>At the end of the sixteenth century a new maritime power sprang into being.
Holland, having successfully waged her war of independence against Spain and
wrested from Portugal her supremacy in the eastern seas, China as well as India
and the Spice Islands became the scene of Dutch activity, and Dutch ships began
to take the leading part in the maritime exploration of Southern Asia. These
ships when bound for Bantam (the western portion of Java) must have sighted
Australia, especially when stormy weather drove them to its shores. Their first
knowledge of the southern continent is believed to have been acquired in 1595
in a voyage fitted out by some rich Dutch merchants, at the instigation of
Cornelius Houtman, a merchant who had lived in Lisbon and had gathered from the
Portuguese particulars concerning their discoveries. Being imprisoned for debt
there, Houtman wrote home to the Dutch merchants, giving them much information
regarding the East, and they obtained his release and sent him upon this voyage
to the East Indies. On the way from Antongil (on the east side of Madagascar)
to Java the compasses of the Dutch ships were subject to great variation, and
by going too far north they failed to make certain sandbanks (probably the
Abrolhos or those near Point Cloates) "marked on their Portuguese charts" which
they should have sighted, and Wytfliet says that on this voyage much was
learned of the Australis Terra. For fully sixty years the southern continent
now became the goal of the Dutch navigators, and Dutch expeditions left Holland
in quick succession with instruc-tions to investigate and report upon the South
Land, to which they gave the name of New Holland. The stories of these voyages
have their places in the Dutch archives and are well known to us. Of late years
the records have been published and contain all that is known concerning the
Dutch discoveries in New Holland.</p>
<p>About the year 1600, after the founding of the East India Company, we find
English ships beginning to compete with the Dutch for a portion of their trade
with the East. With the eastern monsoon the English sailed eastward principally
by what the Dutch called their "new route," that is to say, round the Cape of
Good Hope past the islands of St. Paul and Amsterdam, thence making the coast
of New Holland.[*] Between New Holland and the south-eastern shores of Asia the
Indian Ocean flows through many channels into the Pacific, and ships coming
from the southward across the Equator to China and japan had to pass through
some of these channels. "It soon became a recognized practice for British
seamen destined for the straits between Java and Timor to secure the land-fall
from New Holland."[**] Instead of coming there by accident or through being
blown out of their course, we learn that now the ships made it "their principal
care to fall in with New Holland."</p>
<blockquote>[* Early Dutch navigators recommended seamen to make the South Land
in 26&deg; Or 27&deg;. British ships usually made it in 22&deg; or 23&deg;
S.]</blockquote>
<blockquote>[** "A New Directory for the East Indies," S. Dunn. 5th ed. London,
1780. P. 368.]</blockquote>
<p>The earliest accounts in their captains' log-books and journals telling of
how they first saw what is now a British possession are full of interest to-day
and should have a place in every Australian history. There are not many records
relating to these English voyages. Here and there a log-book of ancient date
states the bare fact that the land was sighted, or an old directory quotes the
remarks made by some captain--small scraps of intelligence, yet sufficient to
prove that long before Cook discovered the east coast in the "Endeavour"
British seamen had reached and taken their bearings from the west coast of New
Holland.</p>
<p>One experienced commander[*] (the date of whose voyage is not stated), after
giving 22&deg; 31' S. as the latitude that ships should endeavour to make for,
sounds a note of warning with regard to the perils around its shores. "I must
observe," he writes, "that till under the lat. of 26&deg; S. the coast of New
Holland must be approached with caution as there is great danger, though there
are many never-failing guides to warn you of your approach, such as great
quantities of skuttle-bones, weeds and drifts, and near the Bank grampuses
playing like seals and innumerable quantities of Tropick birds, but
skuttle-fish and weeds are commonly the first marks. The land in lat. 22&deg;
S. and 23&deg; S. is low, the soundings 130 fathoms mud about 14 leagues from
the coast."</p>
<blockquote>[* Remarks published by William Nichelson of H.M.S. "Elizabeth,"
1758-64.]</blockquote>
<p>One can picture, while the east coast remained all unknown the little stream
of British ships making its way eastward to Western Australia, creeping along
the reefs in the darkness past the low sandhills and grassy slopes in the
neighbourhood of Point Cloates and North-West Cape, where now, from lighthouses
of grey concrete, every five or seven seconds a flashing white light is thrown
upon the seaman's path. The little stream of ships with the advancement of time
has grown into a big river with many branches, which divide and penetrate every
harbour of the continent.</p>

<h4>TRYAL ROCKS (FROM DALRYMPLE'S COLLECTION)</h4>
</center>
<p>The first English ship to reach Australian waters of whose coming a record
survives was the ship "Trial"[*] She was wrecked in 1622 upon rocks which soon
were placed on charts under the name of the Tryal Rocks, although for long they
were thought to be of doubtful existence. Ten of the ship's passengers safely
reached Batavia on July 5th; a second boat came there on the 8th with
thirty-six survivors, and these informed the Dutch Governor (Koen) that they
had abandoned their ship with ninety-seven people on board in lat. 20&deg;10'
S. They also stated that the "Tryal" had struck upon the reef during the night
in fair weather. Both English and Dutch ships looked for the rocks, yet
gradually people doubted their existence, because seamen who claimed to have
sighted them placed them in entirely different latitudes. Dampier hoped to find
them. The "Jane" frigate in 1705 searched for them in vain, although her
com-mander guessed the truth concerning their situation. In his journal he
wrote on June 27th of that year: "Hove to, <i>according to custom</i>, on
account of the Tryal Rocks (if such exist), for although they are reported to
extend 20 leagues in length I was informed by the Commodore of the Dutch ships
... that he never heard of these rocks being seen. If they exist they must lie
much farther east than in the route toward Java Head."</p>
<blockquote>[* The "Tryal" carried a letter from the Hague to Dutch authorities
in the East giving particulars of the Treaty concluded in 1619 between the
English and Dutch E.I. Companies.]</blockquote>
<p>Many years after a Dutch sloop was again sent to explore them in consequence
of their having been seen by the ship "Vaderland Getrouw" in 1718 in
20&frac12;&deg; S. The sloop sighted and charted them and reported that they
ranged from east to west forty miles, were in lat. 19&deg;30' S. and were
eighty leagues from New Holland. Captain Foss of the Danish ship "Fredensberg
Castle" saw them in 1777, and geographers continued to place them on their
maps, yet many sailors still refused to believe that they existed. At last the
voyage of the ship "Greyhound," on her passage from China to Port Jackson as
late as 1819, reopened the question by her commander declaring that he had met
with a reef of rocks in lat. 19&deg;59' S., long. 103&deg;30' E., which were
the long-lost Tryal Rocks.</p>
<p>In 1820, after a minute survey of the different situations where these rocks
had been reported, Lieutenant Phillip Parker King in H.M.S. "Mermaid" came to
the conclusion that the Monte Bello Islands exactly answered the description
given by the Danish captain, and he states, "There remains no doubt in my mind
but that Barrow Island (in 20&deg;40' S., 115&deg;27' E.) and Trimouille Island
(of the French) and the numerous reefs around them are the identical Tryal
Rocks." Since King's day naval surveyors have found the exact position of the
rocks. "Admiralty Sailing Directions" (1917) state that "Tryal Rocks, awash at
high water, are near the outer edge of the S.W. part of Monte Bello Islands
reef and 5 miles N. of the north extreme of Barrow Island." King attributed the
difficulty of identification to errors in longitude on the part of early
navigators whose reckonings, as is well known, cannot be relied upon, owing to
the fact that they had to depend upon their chronometers, which were liable to
get out of order.</p>
<p>The second English ship to make the Australian coast of whose presence off
the Abrolhos a record has been preserved was the "London" under Captain Daniel,
who came there in June, 1681, according to Thornton, Horsburgh and Thomson
(Dalrymple places the date as 1687), and therefore Daniel saw these shores
before his countryman Dampier. Of his coming Captain Daniel wrote in his
journal: "With the wind S.W. by W. steering by compass N.E. by E, at 10 a.m.
the water was discoloured: a man at the foretop saw a breach rise ahead of us.
We put our helm hard a starboard and stood away N.W. by W. and weathered the
N.W. end of it about &frac12; a mile: at that distance the depth was 35 fms.
white corally ground with some red mixed: next depth (about 2 hours after we
tacked) was about 40 fms., the same ground, and at 9 p.m.having run off by log
on a N.W. by W. course had no ground at 65 fms...The breach which we first saw
happened to be the northernmost of all, there being several and by our
computation are 20 miles in length. Within the breaches several small white
sandy islands were seen with some bushes on them: a very heavy sea broke
against the south part of these. When close to them the mainland was not
seen."</p>
<p>Captain Daniel apparently saw Wallabi Group, the northern-most of the three
groups of islands and rocks comprising the Abrolhos. He named it "Dangerous
Rocks," He also may have given the name of Maiden's Isle to Rottnest Island, as
it is so called in many old atlases. He made a chart of the Abrolhos which was
published by Dalrymple, and, however imperfectly it may represent these shoals,
it seems to have been the first attempt by an Englishman to chart the shores of
Australia.</p>
<p>There is a curious silence among historians regarding Cloates Island, or
Cloates Doubtful Island, off Western Australia, yet to sailors in olden days it
was an island of mystery; and for English sea captains who made it their duty
to fall in with New Holland it possessed a peculiar attraction. They looked for
it and wrote about it in their log-books more than any other part of the
continent, because for years people were wont to disbelieve in its existence
too. Owing to the hidden trendings in the coast and the elbow that is formed in
its outline where they first sighted land a difficult problem was presented to
one sailor after another which none could solve.</p>

<h4>CAPTAIN DANIEL'S CHART OF HOUTMAN'S ABROLHOS</h4>
</center>
<p>Lieutenant King also found that Cloates Island did exist and was not an
island or shoals like the Tryal Rocks and the Abrolhos, but actually formed a
part of the mainland. Early explorers had passed along this portion of the
coast, though none had named the point until in 1719 it was suddenly christened
Cloates Island, and Cloates Island it remained until a hundred years later,
when King proved it to be a peninsula. This supposed island was discovered by
Captain Nash (possibly an Englishman), in com-mand of a Flemish ship, the
"House of Austria," bound from Ostend to China. On seeing it he wrote in his
journal: "Being clear weather brought to, sounded, and had no ground with 100
fms. though not above four miles off shore. The day before and several days
after observed an incredible quantity of seaweed like that from the Gulf of
Florida and small birds like lapwings both in size and flight. This island
cannot be seen far even in clear weather and lies N.E. by E. and S.W. by S.
about 32 leagues in length with terrible breakers from each end running about
three miles into the sea." He gave the lat. as 22&deg; S. and from it made
7&deg;26' westing to Java Head. As he could find no account of this land in any
of his books or charts Captain Nash named it Cloates or Cloot's Island in
honour of a Flemish Baron, one of the owners of the ship.[*]</p>
<blockquote>[* "A New Directory for the East Indies," S. Dunn. 5th ed.
1780.]</blockquote>
<p>Other ships followed Captain Nash's route and saw Cloates Island, and
reported having seen it. Captain Pelly of the ship "Prince of Wales" in 1739 at
first sight thought the land like small islands, so very low that they could
not be seen from the deck. A great smoke was rising only at five or six leagues
distant. He "sounded and had no ground at 160 fms...raised the land and found
it long and level about the height of the Lizard."...He believed "the land like
islands joined to the rest." The last sentence seems to show that Pelly queried
the report that the land was a single island, or else had seen other islands in
the north-east.</p>
<p>Another East India Company's ship, the "Haeslingfield," sighted Cloates
Island in 1743. On July 16th Captain Robert Haldane[*] records having seen
weeds and common berries in the water in lat. 24&deg;33' S.; "also next day but
not so much as before." On the following day, Monday, July 18th, he writes:
"Saw Cloot's Island. Lay to...Made sail...Kept a good look out all night,
having been yesterday at noon only 75' to ye southward of Cloot's Island
discovered by ye 'House of Austria,' an Ostend shipping, by our account not a
great way from ye meridian in which they made it. At daylight saw it bearing
S.E. &frac12; S. to E. by S. distant 6 leagues. Sounded, but had no ground with
fms., nor have we seen any scuttle bones at all nor weeds since the 16th and
17th as they mention, and but 2 or 3 birds of a whitish colour and of size of a
pigeon. It extends from N.N.E. to S. by W. about 9 or 10 leagues in length and
rises gradually towards the middle; from the N.E. end of it runs a ledge of
rocks upon which we saw breakers a great way out. By a very good observation I
make it to lie in lat. 22&deg;08' S. and 32&deg;01' East from St. Paul's, which
agrees pretty well with a journall of ye above mentioned ship by accident found
on board.[**]...I am apt to believe that this island is laid down...in charts a
good deal too much to westward." The last remark was true. "Doubtful" Island
has always been placed too much to westward, and at some distance from the
mainland.[***]</p>
<blockquote>[* India Office Log-Book.]</blockquote>
<blockquote>[**] The curious fact of Captain Nash's journal being found on
board the "Haeslingfield" is additional evidence that he was of English
nationality.</blockquote>
[***] Upon the charts showing Cook's first discoveries, and upon the atlas
pub-lished with La P&eacute;rouse's voyage, it is shown between the erroneously
charted Tryal Rocks and the Australian coast. On the map drawn by Lieutenant
Roberts, R.N., to describe Cook's track in his last voyage, Cloates Island
appears twice, to the south-east and again to the south-west of the Tryal Rocks
and beneath the latter island is given the further information "according to
the French." In Purdy's "General Chart of the World," 2nd ed., 1812, it is
shown with the addition of "doubtful," and also (without that qualification) in
Espinosa's Spanish Chart of the same date. Cloates Island must not be confused
with Kalatoa, or Old Clouts Island (upon which the "Ocean" was wrecked) in the
Flores Sea.]
<p>Fifty-three years after the "Haeslingfield" had passed (in the year 1796)
the master of the ship "Belvedere" reported having seen Cloates Island "on the
lee bow bearing E. by N. 5 or 6 miles at 9; breakers off each end...10 a.m. a
bluff point seen from the masthead." After steering ten miles, the observed
lat., being 21&deg;10' S.[*] "the body of Cloat's Island was seen half way up
the mizen shrouds."</p>
<blockquote>[*] Its true lat. 22&deg;42' S., long. 113&deg;'41' E.</blockquote>
<p>But by this time geographers were inclined to be sceptical, and Horsburgh
writes: "This evidently was not Cloates Island but some of the low islands in
the bight to the east of North-West Cape." Joining the unbelievers, he adds:
"Cloates Island very probably has no real existence."</p>

<h4>CLOATES "ISLAND"</h4>
</center>
<p>Lieutenant King, however, who was sent by the Admiralty to explore the
north-west coast, was not the man to pass over any reliable evidence concerning
early discoveries in those regions and he determined to examine this coast. He
came there first in 1818, and on February 10th saw the land and described its
outer shore very much after the manner of early seamen: "The coast is tolerably
elevated, may be seen at a distance of 6 or 7 leagues. The shore is fronted
with rocks that extend 3 or 4 miles into the sea, on the extremity of which the
surf breaks with a continued foam." On the 14th he rounded North-West Cape and
entered the bight which he named Exmouth Gulf, and before dark his ship, the
"Mermaid," had sailed twenty-five miles down the opening without seeing its
termination. Exmouth Gulf is twenty-seven miles wide between Tubridgi Point and
North-West Cape, and has been traced fifty miles into the land yet even to-day
a great part of it is very imperfectly known. "The western side trended
southwards, losing itself in distance and bore the appearance of being an
island," King records after bringing the "Mermaid" to an anchorage in an inlet
called Bay of Rest, or Jogodor. From here he continued his examination, but was
forced to leave Exmouth Gulf without being positively certain whether the bay
within it in which his ship had anchored was a part of an island or of the
continent.[*]</p>
<blockquote>[* Allan Cunningham, the botanist on board, had little doubt that
it formed part of the mainland. (See his journal, February 16,
1818.)]</blockquote>
<p>In October, 1820, during his third voyage to the north-west coast, King
wrote: "The existence of Cloates Island, of which there are so many undeniable
descriptions, was for a long time questioned by navigators. I think, however,
that it does exist, and that it is no other than the mainland to the southward
of North-West Cape." When he came to the curious arm or elbow in the coast-line
which had caused sailors to mistake this peninsula for an island, he observed:
"In the neighbourhood of the Bay of Rest (within the Gulf) the shore is more
sinuous...here the Gulf is twelve miles across...the Gulf then shoalens and at
fifteen miles farther terminates in an inlet...at the south end of the high
land that forms the west side of the Gulf and <i>which is doubtless the
identical Cloates Island</i> that has puzzled navigators for the last eighty
years.[*] It perfectly answers the descriptions that have been given, and the
only thing against it is the longitude, but this like that of the Tryal Rocks
is not to be attended to."</p>
<blockquote>[* King's "Intertropical Australia," Vol. 11, P. 365.]</blockquote>
<p>It is evident that King was keenly interested in the history of Cloates
Island and was determined to remove all doubts as to its identity. And after he
had examined it he says: "The description of this island by Captain Nash of the
ship 'House of Austria,' as well as that of the 'Haeslingfield' in 1743 and by
Captain Pelly, accord exactly with the appearance of this promontory, nor is
the longitude much in error when we consider the strength of the currents which
set to the north-west during the easterly monsoon in the space between New
Holland and Java."[*]</p>
<blockquote>[* King's "Intertropical Australia," vol. 1, P. 443.]</blockquote>
<p>Thus once and for all King cleared up the mystery which had for so long
surrounded Cloates Island.</p>
<p>From these glimpses into the log-books of British seamen who sighted the
west coast, we pass to the journal of William Dampier, the first Englishman of
whose landing we have actual record.</p>
<p><a name="ach1" id="ach1"></a></p>
<h3>CHAPTER 1</h3>
<h4>DAMPIER, BANKS, AND COOK</h4>
<p>On the "Cygnet's" arrival off Cape L&eacute;v&ecirc;que, Dampier recorded
his first impressions of the country. "This part," he writes, "is all a low,
even land with sandy banks against the sea...the points rocky and so are some
of the islands in the bay...The soil is dry and sandy, destitute of water,
except you make wells, yet producing divers sort of trees." He at once noticed
a species of eucalyptus which grew most abundantly, calling them dragon trees,
and describing them as "the largest of any there. They are about the bigness of
our large apple trees...the rind is blackish...The leaves are of a dark colour.
The gum distils out of the knots or cracks that are in the bodies of the trees.
We compared it with some Gum-dragon or Dragon's Blood that was aboard and it
was of the same."</p>
<p>On January 5, 1688, after the "Cygnet" had anchored, some natives were seen
walking on the shore. A boat was sent off from the ship in the hope of being
able to get water and provisions, but on seeing it approaching them the blacks
quickly disappeared. For three days the buccaneers searched for their houses,
but found none; then, anxious to be on friendly terms with the inhabitants,
left toys in different places which it was thought they would visit. A little
later, while searching for water among the islands, Dampier and his shipmates
came upon a great many natives.</p>
<p>He describes these people as being "tall and thin, with long limbs...great
heads, round foreheads, and great brows. Their eyelids always half closed to
keep the flies out of their eyes, they were being so troublesome, no fanning
will keep them from coming to one's face. They have great bottle noses, full
lips, and wide mouths, and the two fore teeth of the upper jaw are wanting in
all of them." He thought the colour of their skin was coal black and that "they
have no sort of clothes. They have no houses but lie in the open air. Earth
being their bed and Heaven their canopy." On looking around to see what they
lived upon, he says: "Their only food is a small sort of fish which they get by
making wares of stone across little coves,"[*] and adds: "Their chiefest
dependence is what the sea leaves in their wares...be it night or day, rain or
shine, they must attend to them or else they must fast, for the earth affords
them no food at all." Some of them "had wooden swords; others a sort of lance;
the sword is a piece of wood shaped somewhat like a cutlass." From which it
appears that they carried boomerangs, of which Dampier has left us this
impression. He imagined that the natives used stone hatchets as he saw no iron
or other metal, and believed that they obtained their fire "by rubbing or
twirling a hard piece of wood between the palms of their hands" against a
softer piece "until it smokes and at last takes fire."</p>
<blockquote>[* These stone weirs were afterwards seen by King on the north-west
coast in 1818, by Roe at Oyster Harbour, West Australia, and by Oxley on the
Lachlan River, New South Wales; and King remarks that by their being found on
the south-east, south-west,and north-west coasts, he concluded "this expedient
was a native practice throughout the continent."]</blockquote>
<p>On one island (to the eastward of Cape L&eacute;v&ecirc;que) the buccaneers
discovered about forty inhabitants--men, women, and children--who, on seeing
white men landing there were at first "much disordered" and "made a great
noise," but when they saw no harm was intended they became more subdued. For a
dwelling-place they possessed "only a fire with a few boughs before it--set up
on the side the wind was." When they grew friendly the sailors tried to make
them help to water the ship. They put clothes on some of them and led them to
the wells (where water had been found) and placed a barrel of water on each
man's shoulders to be taken to the boat, which was only waste of time, for the
natives "stood like statues and grinned like so many monkeys"; and Dampier
relates, "We were forced to carry the water ourselves but they very fairly put
the clothes off and laid them down," no doubt highly pleased to be rid of
them.</p>
<p>While one of the boats was seeking food in these islands (to which the name
of Buccaneers' Archipelago has since been given) a number of natives were seen
swimming from one island to another, and consequently it was believed that they
had "no boats, canoes, or bark logs." The way in which these tribes propelled
themselves through the water is described, however, by Allan Cunningham in a
later chapter of this volume. Four natives were brought on board the "Cygnet,"
when they greedily devoured rice boiled with turtle and dugong which the
English set before them.</p>
<p>On one occasion some of the blacks who lived on the mainland came close to
the ship, and standing on a high bank began to threaten the sailors by calling
to them from their high position and wildly flourishing their spears and
boomerangs; nor would t leave off until Captain Read ordered the drum to be
beaten. Then they hastily took their departure, "crying 'Gurry, Gurry' deep in
the throat." At spring tide the "Cygnet" was hauled into a small sandy cove as
far as she could float. When the tide turned, the dry sand extended around the
ship for nearly half a mile, and in his diary Dampier says: "All the neap tides
we lay wholly aground for the sea did not come within 100 yards of where she
lay"; which gave the men time to clean the bottom of the ship. Meanwhile, most
of the sailors lived ashore in a tent and mended their sails, their constant
food being manatee (dugong)[*] and turtle. On March 12th the "Cygnet" left the
shores of New Holland, directing her course to the northward.</p>
<blockquote>[* A full-sized dugong--popularly known as the sea-cow--ordinarily
furnishes about a ton of good meat. Part of the flesh resembles beef and other
portions would easily be mistaken for pork. Dugong feed on the seaweed growing
in shallow waters round the coast.]</blockquote>
<p>When he visited Australia for the second time as captain of the
"Roebuck"--some eleven years afterwards--Dampier spent about three weeks on the
west and north-west coasts discovering harbours, meeting natives, and sometimes
landing upon its shores. It is said that he was "well acquainted with botany,"
and he thus describes the natural features of the coast at Shark Bay, which he
entered on August 7, 1699, and anchored within it, at three different places:
"The land is of indifferent height...There are many gentle risings neither
steep nor high...but in this bay or sound...the land is low by the seaside, the
mould is sand...producing a sort of sampier [samphire] which bears a white
flower. Farther in, the mould is reddish...producing some grass, plants, and
shrubs. The grass grows in great tufts as big as a bushel, here and there tufts
being inter-mixed with heath...much of the kind...growing on our commons in
England."</p>
<p>There were curious trees of different sorts, and the visitors thought the
foliage of some even more curious; many grew to a height of five or six feet
"before one comes to their branches, which are bushy"; the colour of their
leaves was white on one side and green on the other. There was long grass
growing there, but it was very thin. Some of the trees were sweet--scented and
turned "reddish within the bark like Sassafras but redder...Most of these and
the shrubs had either blossoms or berries on them. The blossoms...were of
several colours as red, white, and yellow, but mostly blue, and these generally
smelt very sweet and fragrant, as did also some of the rest; there were
beside...plants, herbs and tall flowers and some very small flowers growing on
the ground that were sweet and beautiful, for the most part unlike any I had
seen elsewhere."</p>
<p>"Of large land fowl," Dampier saw "none but eagles, and five or six sorts of
small birds...not bigger than larks, some no bigger than wrens, all singing
with great variety of fine shrill notes," and the sailors caught sight of some
of their young ones in their nests. There was an abundance of water-fowl in
Shark Bay, among them duck--these also had young ones--gulls, and pelicans, and
others of a kind never seen before. The land animals were "only a sort of
raccoon...with very short fore legs," and he says they "go jumping" and were
good meat, which would show that he met with a small species of kangaroo.</p>
<p>The lizards resembled other lizards excepting in three remarkable
particulars: they had "a larger and uglier head and had no
tail...instead...they had the stump of a tail which appeared like another
head."[*] They were very slow in motion, and when "a man comes nigh them they
will stand and hiss," and so hideous did they appear to him that he observes:
"I did never see such ugly creatures anywhere." There were plenty of sea-fish
and shell-fish: among the latter, oysters both of the pearl and the edible
variety, and the shore was "lined thick with many sorts of very strange and
beautiful shells, for variety of colour and shape most finely spotted with red,
black, and yellow," such as he had not seen anywhere "but at this place," and
he brought away what he could.</p>
<blockquote>[* The stump-tailed lizard, <i>Trachysaurus
rugosus</i>.]</blockquote>
<p>There were a great many sharks in this bay, and these, he says, our men "eat
very favourily." Inside a huge one that the sailors cut open was found part of
a dugong. Being ignorant of the Malayan name of this herb-eating mammal,
Dampier called it a "hippopotamus," and because the sharks were so numerous he
named the indentation Shark Bay.</p>
<p>When his ship left there on August 14th he proceeded to follow the coast
round to the north-east and passed through many islands of a pretty height,
which, he thought, must stretch back "as far as to those of Shark Bay." He had
a strong suspicion that these constituted an archipelago of islands.[*] and
that possibly there was "a passage to the south of New Holland and New Guinea
into the Great South Sea eastward."</p>
<blockquote>[* The French Commander, L. de Freycinet called it Archipel de
Dampier in 1803.]</blockquote>

<h4>FROM DAMPIER'S VOYAGES</h4>
</center>
<p>He therefore determined to examine the islands, the largest of which were
"mostly rocky and barren," the rocks being of a rusty yellow colour, and the
"Roebuck" anchored on August 22nd on the inner side of an island the outside of
which he describes as "a bluff point."[*] Here he landed with some of his men,
who took shovels to dig for water, but none was found. He found that two or
three sorts of shrubs grew there, "one just like rosemary and therefore I
called this Rosemary Island." The rosemary shrub grew plentifully but "had no
smell...Some other shrubs had blue and yellow flowers," and there were two
sorts of grain like beans: "the one grew on bushes, the other on a sort of
creeping vine that ran along the ground." Dampier says that this vine had
thick, broad leaves, and the blossom resembled "a bean blossom but much larger
and of a deep red colour looking very beautiful." It appears likely, although
the description of the leaf is hardly a true one, that this last was Dampier's
Glory Pea <i>(Clianthus Dampieri,</i> Cunn.), a specimen of which is contained
in Dampier's Herbarium. His collection.[**] is still preserved at Oxford, and
besides the Glory Pea there are in it the following plants that he brought from
New Holland: <i>Casuarina equisetifolia</i>, <i>Melalcuca gibbosa</i>,
<i>Solanum orbiculatum</i>, <i>Tripolona Dampieri</i>, <i>Dammara alba</i>, and
<i>Trachymene pusilla.</i></p>
<blockquote>[* Writing of Dampier, Captain P. P. King says: "I take Malus
Island to be that on which he landed and the bluff...is no other than our
Courtenay Head." From the south-east "in the bearing Dampier saw it, Rosemary
Island would appear to be joined to Malus Island, and hence his opinion that it
was an island five or six leagues in length and one in breadth."]</blockquote>
<blockquote>[** Also called Sturt's Desert Pea. Drawings of seven plants seen
by Dampier were engraved in Plukenet's "Almatheurn," 1769, while about eleven
appear in the "History of Dampier's Voyage."]</blockquote>
<p>Among the land birds the most noticeable were "white parrots, which flew a
great many together," besides numberless sea-fowl. The "white parrots" were the
slender-billed species of white cockatoo (<i>Licmetis pastinator</i>, Gould),
now known as Dampier's Cockatoo. In August and September these birds still fly
"a great many together" from the mainland over to Rosemary Island and the other
islands of Dampier's Archipelago, where they breed in the holes of the
rocks.</p>

<h4>FROM DAMPIER'S VOYAGES</h4>
</center>
<p>The anchorage at Rosemary Island proving unsatisfactory, and as he could
find no water, Dampier stood away on August 23rd and steered to the north-east.
In fine weather, with a clear sky, "there being not one cloud to be seen," the
"Roebuck" coasted along the shores of the mainland, looking for an opening
during the day but "edging away from it at night" for fear of shoals. At night
when it was calm the sailors fished with hook and line and they then took many
kinds of fish, including snapper, bream, and dog-fish, and also caught a
monkfish, of which Dampier brought home a drawing. This appears in the story of
his voyage.</p>
<p>On the 28th the "Roebuck" lost sight of the land and a great many water
snakes now appeared in the water, and birds, chiefly boobies and noddies,
hovered about the ship's track. At night a noddy was caught: the top of its
head was coal black, the breast and under part of the wings white, and the back
and upper parts faint black or smoke colour. It had feet just like a duck's
feet and a deeply forked tail and very long wings.</p>
<p>On the 30th land was seen again and the ship anchored in the afternoon three
and a half leagues off shore, coming into a bay which has since been named
Roebuck Bay.[*] In the earlier part of the evening an eclipse of the moon was
witnessed but not very clearly, for the horizon was hazy. The moon had been
"half an hour above the horizon and at 2 hours 22 minutes after sunset the
eclipse was quite gone."</p>
<blockquote>[* The space between Cape and Point Gantheaume was named Roebuck
Bay by Captain P. P. King, as "here Dampier had anchored in the 'Roebuck's
voyage."]</blockquote>
<p>Next day Dampier landed with a well-armed watering party, who "carried
shovels and pickaxes to make wells. When they came near the shore they saw
three tall, naked black men in a sandy bay who as the men rowed in
disappeared." The boat, in charge of two seamen, was then sent off shore to
wait while the rest of the party went in search of the natives, who at length
were seen with eight or nine more standing on the top of a small hill a quarter
of a mile away. On catching sight of the strangers coming their way they
quickly dispersed. From this hill Dampier saw a low, open plain half a mile off
with "several things like haycocks" dotted over it. He thought these objects
were houses at first, but "found them to be so many rocks." He returned to the
landing-place, where the men had begun to dig a well, when nine or ten natives
made their appearance at a little distance away and began to threaten them.
Dampier says, "At last one came towards us and...I went out to meet him
making...signs of peace and friendship, but he ran away. I took two men in the
afternoon along by the seaside purposely to catch one...of whom I might learn
where they got their fresh water. There were 10 or 12 natives a little way off,
who seeing us going away from the rest of our men followed us at a
distance...There being a sand bank between us and them, we made a halt and hid
ourselves in a bending of the sand bank. They...thought to seize us. So they
dispersed themselves some going to the sea shore, and others beating about the
sand hills...So a nimble young man that was with me...ran towards them...soon
overtaking them, they faced about and fought him. He had a cutlass and they had
wooden lances...being so many...they were too hard for him...I chased two more
that were by the sea shore, but fearing how it might be with my young man I
turned back quickly...to the top of a sand hill whenceIsaw him near me closely
engaged with them. Upon seeing me one threw a lance at me that narrowly missed
me.Idischarged my gun...but avoided shooting any of them till finding the young
man in great danger...and myself in some, and that though the gun had a little
frightened them at first they...soon learnt to despise it...crying 'pooh pooh
pooh' and coming on afresh, I thought it high time to charge again and shoot
one of them which I did. The rest seeing him fall made a stand again and my
young man took the opportunity to disengage himself and come off to me. My
other man also was with me...and I returned back with my men being very sorry
for what had happened. They took up their wounded companion...and my young man
who...had been struck through the cheek by one of their lances...was afraid it
had been poisoned...but he soon recovered."</p>
<p>Among the New Hollanders there was one who by his appear-ance seemed the
chief of them all and a kind of prince or captain among them. He was a young,
brisk man, not very tall nor so "personable" as some of the others, but much
more active and courageous, painted--as none of the rest were--with a circle of
white paste or pigment about his eyes, a white streak down his nose from the
forehead to the tip, and his breast and part of his arms white with the same
paint, not for beauty or for ornament but to make himself look more terrible,
his painting adding very much to his natural deformity. All these savages had
"the same black skins and frizzled hair," the same blinking eyes, and had the
same kind of flies teasing them as those seen by Dampier in his former voyage,
when he came to the north-west coast and touched at a part which was "not above
40 or 50 leagues to the north-east of this."</p>

<p><a name="a0301141h-07" id="a0301141h-07"></a><img alt="" src="0301141h-images/0301141h-07.jpg"></p>
<h4>FROM DAMPIER'S VOYAGES</h4>
</center>
<p>Here too were many native fire-places with three or four boughs "stuck up to
windward of them." Round these fire-places there were nearly always found heaps
of shells, and consequently he surmised that these people lived on shell-fish,
as did those met with in his first voyage. Their spears also were similar, but
the natives seen in the "Cygnet's" voyage were on an island in the company of
women and children, and it was imagined that for that reason they did not
attempt to attack the white men, as these on the continent had done, where only
men were congregated.</p>
<p>Although the watering party had dug down eight or nine feet they found no
water, so on September 1st Dampier sent the boatswain of the "Roebuck" ashore
to dig deeper. Next morning the men returned with "a rundlet of brackish water"
which they had got at another place, but it was not fit to drink. However, he
decided that "it would serve to boil oatmeal for burgoo, and the sailors
subsequently brought aboard four hogs-heads of it." It was perceived that the
tides ran very swiftly here, and at low water the shore was rocky; but at high
water a boat could pass over the rocks.</p>
<p>No more was seen of the natives, though the smoke of their fires was
observed two or three miles away. The land resembled the shores of Cygnet Bay.
Dampier describes it as being "barri-caded with a chain of sandhills to the
sea." The soil by the sea was dry and sandy, bearing shrubs and bushes. Some of
these had "yellow flowers or blossoms, some blue and some white: most of them
with a very fragrant smell. Some had fruit like peapods, in each of which there
were just ten small peas...no more nor less." There were also here some of that
sort of bean that Dampier had found at Rosemary Island and another "of red,
hard pulse growing in cods also with little black eyes."[*]</p>
<blockquote>[* <i>Abrus precatorius.</i>]</blockquote>
<p>He says: "I know not their names but have seen them used in the East Indies
for weighing gold and...at Guinea as I have heard the women make bracelets with
them to wear about their arms. These grow on bushes; but here are also a fruit
like beans growing on a creeping sort of shrublike vine."</p>
<p>The land farther in...was very plain and even, "partly savannah and partly
woodland..." Here there were a great many rocks five or six feet high and
"round at the top like a haycock," beyond them again, farther inland, small
trees...twelve or fourteen feet high "with a head of small...boughs"; while by
the sides of the creeks, and more especially near the sea, were a few small
black mangroves. Dampier saw few animals, although his men described "two or
three beasts like hungry wolves, lean like so many skeletons," which doubtless
were dingoes, and some lizards were noticed as well as a "raccoon or two" and
one small speckled snake. Among the birds there were crows or birds "closely
resembling the English crow"; also plenty of turtle-doves" that were plump and
fat and very good meat." A great many green turtle were seen, but none were
caught, there being no place there to set a turtle net and no channel for
them.</p>
<p>He here added to the collection of shells that he had gathered at Shark Bay,
obtaining some that were strange to him, "chiefly a sort not large, and thick
set all about with rays and spikes...in rows." But of his collection he
afterwards "lost allexcept a few, and those not of the best." It is probable
that some of these shells reached England as well as his herbarium although his
ship sprung a leak on the homeward voyage and foundered at the Isle of
Ascension in 1701.[*]</p>
<blockquote>[* Ten weeks later three English men-of-war called there, and on
board these ships Dampier and his men returned to England.]</blockquote>
<p>After Dampier had finished writing the story of the "Roebuck's "voyage" he
added some further particulars respecting the South Land which show us that he
no longer believed in the existence of a great southern or Antarctic continent.
He was satisfied that in his travels he had found a number of islands spread
over the waters where the land of Terra Australis Incognita had been supposed
to extend, and he observes, "'tis probably the same with New Holland."</p>
<p>On maps of the world the portions of New Holland discovered by the Dutch
were now being methodically laid down and the vast imaginary continent left
out. Gradually, in its true place in the eastern hemisphere, a vague outline of
Australia appeared, but of so curious a shape (as for example in the world maps
of Le Rouge and Robert Vaugondy) that it bore only a deformed likeness to the
real island-continent. The east coast had never been seen, so an imaginary
coast-line was given to it which, starting at the New Hebrides in the north,
ran south-westerly without a break until it joined the southern extremity of
Tasmania.</p>
<h4>DISCOVERY OF THE EAST COAST--COOK'S VOYAGE--CAPE HOWE TO POINT DANGER</h4>
<p>The day was now approaching when all doubt was to be dispelled and Australia
was to take her place as a known continent.</p>
<p>In 1770 a little English ship, not at all majestic--like other British
men-of-war--and bearing a name as humble and unpre-tentious as herself,
discovered the east coast and gave to it its real form on the map of the world.
A little bark[*] Of 370 tons, she flew the white ensign and bore herself
steadily through heavy seas and stormy weather; yet it still seems wonderful
that so small a ship should carry out a misson of which it has been said it was
"to the English nation the most momentous voyage of discovery that has ever
taken place."[**]</p>
<blockquote>[* As the word was then written.]</blockquote>
<blockquote>[** Preface to Cook's Journal by Admiral Wharton. The Admiralty
instruc-tions ordered Cook, who had received a lieutenant's commission, to
proceed to Tahiti, and after the completion of the astronomical observations at
that island, to continue the discoveries in the Pacific in which Byron and
Wallis had been engaged. Tahiti had been recommended by Wallis, who had
returned just before Cook sailed, as the point from which the transit of Venus
should be observed.]</blockquote>

<h4>CAPTAIN JAMES COOK</h4>
</center>
<p>The seaman who commanded her was James Cook. Some-times we hear that Captain
Cook has not been fully appreciated in his native land, but if this is so, at
least let it be said that among his countrymen who travel farthest, more
especially among those whose paths lie on the sea, there has been reserved for
him within the great Empire of Britain a true measure of his worth. In the
lands visited by him in the South Pacific his name and his doings live as those
of no other navigator of any age or race. We will endeavour to re-state briefly
how he discovered the east coast.[</p>
<p>Lieutenant james Cook, as he then ranked in the Royal Navy, "saw land" with
"the first daylight" of Thursday, April 19, 1770. On seeing it Cook at once
looked towards the south, where, according to his longitude compared with that
of Tasman, he should have been able to see Tasmania. But all was clear in that
quarter. He then perceived that the strange land trended north-east and
south-west, which convinced him that he had reached the east coast of New
Holland. And he began to doubt whether Australia and Tasmania were one country,
as was then generally supposed.[</p>
<p>To those on board the "Endeavour" the face of the country appeared "green
and woody" and its shore "a white sand." It would seem as though Nature herself
had prepared a reception for the coming of the voyagers, as at noon all were
called on deck "to see three waterspouts which made their appearance at the
same time, in different places between us and the land...Two soon disappeared,
but the third...lasted fully a quarter of an hour. It was a column which
appeared of the thickness of a mast or...tree and reached down from a
smoke-coloured cloud...to the surface of the sea; smaller ones seemed to
attempt to form in its neighbourhood, one...close by it and became longer than
the old one...They Joined together in an instant and gradually contracting into
the cloud disappeared."[*]</p>
<blockquote>[* "Journal of Sir J. Banks," edited by Sir J.
Hooker.]</blockquote>
<p>Immediately Cook saw the land he began to make a chart of its coast-line--a
chart which may be called the foundation of Australia's charts, which the
navigators who followed him have built upon and added to. He placed on it the
first land seen, under the name of Point Hicks to honour the "Endeavour's
"first lieutenant," who," he says, "discovered this land." Although Cook gave
the name as Point Hicks there is no headland, but only an elevation in the
coast-line at this place. The land, however, slopes away south-westward from
where he saw it. and so no doubt was regarded by him to form a "point."[</p>
<p>Two headlands were next seen farther northward. The first rises to a round
hillock like "the Ram Head" (Rame Head) going into Plymouth Sound, and was
given that name; the second remarkable for the way in which the coast trends
there, being north on the one side and south-west on the other, was called Cape
Home. A small island lying off it is known as Gabo Island.[*]</p>
<blockquote>[* Gabo is said to be the native rendering of Cape
Howe.]</blockquote>
<p>From Cape Home, Cook followed the coast northwards, and as he went along
gave a quaint variety of names to its different features. On the 21st a fairly
high mountain near the shore was called Mount Dromedary on account of its
peculiar shape, and on the 22nd--a day on which the "Endeavour" stood closer in
with the land--a remarkable peaked hill inland for a like reason received the
name of the Pigeon House.[</p>
<p>The air was wonderfully clear. When they had passed Bateman Bay and Point
Upright, with its perpendicular cliffs, those on board could plainly see five
natives upon the beach, smoke from their fires having already been noticed.
From the ship these people looked "enormously black," and the commander would
have sent a boat ashore, but a large hollow sea "from the S.E. beating high
upon the beach," prevented him. The land continued to form "alternately rocky
points and sandy beaches," and "inland between Mount Dromedary and the Pigeon
House are several pretty high mountains," writes Cook in his journal.[*] Of
these hills all excepting two were covered with trees, and the trees had "all
the appearance of being stout and lofty," he remarks, possibly imagining they
would prove suitable for ship-spars. On April 23rd a cape was discovered and
named in honour of St. George; and two leagues beyond it, on the 25th, Cook
observed that a part of the shore seemed to form a bay.[**] To the north point,
because of its curious shape, he gave the name of Long Nose; and eight leagues
farther along the coast he called a headland Red Point, as it appeared to him
to be of that colour. A little way inland north-west of this point was a round
hill whose top "looked like the crown of a hatt."</p>
<blockquote>[* Cook's journal, edited by Sir W. Wharton.]</blockquote>
<blockquote>[** Jervis Bay, afterwards so named by Lieutenant Bowen in honour
of Earl St. Vincent.]</blockquote>
<p>Before dark, smoke was constantly seen on shore and two or three native
fires. On this night the "Endeavour" lay becalmed, drifting in before the sea
until one o'clock a.m., when she got a land breeze. On the morning of the 26th,
in clear, pleasant weather, she steered past some white cliffs which rose
perpendicularly from the water.[</p>
<p>At noon the wind fell and Cook had to tack several times and stand on and
off shore. This he continued to do until daylight on the 27th, after which he
stood in for the land. Owing to the variable winds the ship lost much ground,
so that at noon Red Point bore from here only three leagues to the
southward.[</p>
<p>On the afternoon of this day[*] the pinnace and yawl were hoisted out to
attempt a landing, but the pinnace leaked and had to be hoisted in again.
Several natives were moving about the beach, and four were seen carrying a boat
which it was thought they meant to launch and come off in to the vessel. As
they did not come, Cook with Banks, Solander, and Tupia the Tahitian put off in
the yawl and pulled towards the shore to where they could still see four or
five natives. They, however, soon took to the woods. Three or four of their
canoes lay on the beach and from the yawl looked like the small ones of the New
Zealanders. Trees were seen here, but no underwood, the trees being a species
of palm.[**] The surf was beating high upon the shore,[***] and as Cook saw
that a landing could not be effected the yawl returned on board.</p>
<blockquote>[* By civil reckoning this would be on the afternoon of the 27th,
as Cook's journal was kept by ship time, i.e. the day begins at noon before the
civil reckoning, in which the day commences at midnight. Cook, however, at this
time had made no allowance for the loss of a day in sailing westward on his
voyage from England.]</blockquote>
<blockquote>[** <i>Livision a australis.</i>]</blockquote>
<blockquote>[*** This was near Bulli.]</blockquote>
<p>"At daylight in the morning," writes the commander on April 28th, "we
discovered a bay,[*] which appeared to be tolerably well-sheltered from all
winds." The "Endeavour" stood directly towards it. Smoke was rising on shore,
and through the glasses ten natives could be distinguished at a barren spot,
where they had gathered round a fire. When they saw the ship they left the fire
and retired to a little eminence to watch her coming. A little later two canoes
were seen to draw into the land with two men in each, who, after hauling up the
boats, joined their fellows on the hill. Meanwhile, Mr. Robert Molineux, the
master, had been sent in the pinnace to sound the entrance, and he now came
alongshore beneath where they stood. They then retired higher up the hill,
excepting at least one man, who hid among the rocks and was not seen to leave
the beach.</p>

<h4>KURNELL: COOK'S LANDING-PLACE</h4>
</center>
<p>The boat from the "Endeavour" continued to skirt the shore, and some of the
natives followed her as she turned into a cove a little within the harbour.
There the natives came down to the water's edge and by signs and words, which
were not understood, invited Molineux and his men to land.[*] These natives
were armed with spears and boomerangs. During this time a few others who had
not followed the pinnace, but had remained on the shore opposite the ship,
began to call in a threatening way and to brandish their weapons menacingly.
The blades of the wooden ones, "in shape resembling a scimitar" (familiar to us
as the boomerang), gleamed in the clear light, so that some on board the ship
thought they "looked whitish" and "some thought shining," possibly because the
wood had been so highly polished.[**]</p>
<blockquote>[* Banks's journal.]</blockquote>
<blockquote>[** Banks's journal.]</blockquote>
<p>Two natives painted with white pigment are described by Banks as being
particularly noticeable: their faces only dusted over with it, their bodies
adorned with broad stroke drawn over their breasts and backs, resembling
soldiers' cross belts, while their legs and thighs also had broad white stroke
drawn round them. The two black men talked very earnestly together, when they
were not shouting defiance and brandishing their crooked weapons.[*]</p>
<blockquote>[* Banks's journal.]</blockquote>
<p>The ship reached the entrance of the bay at noon, the beginning of a new
day--April 29th--by ship time. Under the south head[*] of the bay four canoes
were seen, each containing a man who held in his hand a fishgig with which he
struck at the fish The natives in these canoes ventured to the very edge of the
surf, and so intently were they occupied that they scarcely lifted their eyes
to glance at the "Endeavour" sailing past. Standing in with a southerly wind
and clear weather, shortly afterwards Cook came to an anchorage under the south
shore of the bay--about two miles within the entrance--opposite a small native
village consisting of six or eight houses.</p>
<blockquote>[* The outer heads of the bay are Cape Solander (south-west) and
Cape Bank (north-east)]</blockquote>
<p>Presently an old woman came out of a wood, followed by three young children;
she carried an armful of firewood and each child also had gathered a little
bundle. As she went towards one of the houses the woman often looked at the
ship, but her face showed neither fear nor surprise at what she saw. She began
to kindle a fire, and then four canoes came in from fishing. The men landed,
and, hauling in their canoes, prepared their meal to all appearance quite
unmoved at the presence of the strangers who were now little more than half a
mile from them.</p>
<p>In the afternoon Cook manned the ship's boat, and at 3 p.m., with Mr. Banks,
Dr. Solander, and Tupia, proceeded to the south shore of the bay, where,
abreast the ship, men, women, and children were seen standing. When the boats
approached the shore, the natives all made off, excepting two men, who seemed
determined to oppose the landing. These men were each armed with a bundle of
spears and carried wommeras[*] (throwing sticks), and they called out loudly to
the British in harsh, strident voices something which even Tupia failed to
understand. The commander ordered the boats' crews to lie on their oars so that
he might speak to the natives, and some beads and nails were thrown to them.
But all to no purpose. As they saw the boats pull inshore again they began to
shout and wave their spears, as though resolved to defend their coasts to the
uttermost. Seeing that the two men were determined to resist him, Cook ordered
a shot to be fired between them. At this the younger of the two dropped his
bundle of spears, which he immediately snatched up again, and they retired to a
spot where some more spears were lying.</p>
<blockquote>[** The throwing stick was first observed at this
time.]</blockquote>

<h4>"RESOLVED TO DEFEND THEIR COASTS TO THE UTTERMOST"</h4>
</center>
<p>Then the elder man picked up a stone and threw it at the boats, which caused
the commander to fire a second time. The native was struck on the legs with the
shot, yet the only effect it had was to make him go and fetch a shield which he
brought from a house a hundred yards off. At this time the British stepped upon
a rock. They had no sooner done so than the natives, Cook says, "throwed two
darts at us; this obliged me to fire a third shot, soon after which they both
made off."</p>
<p>Thus the British first landed on the East Coast!</p>
<p>The present name of the locality where Cook landed is Kurnell. It was known
to the natives as Kundel. Cook himself at first christened the bay in which he
anchored Stingray Bay. But before he left there he saw fit to change its name.
In his journal Cook writes:</p>
<p>"During our stay in this harbour I caused the English colours to be
displayed ashore every day, and an inscription to be cut upon one of the trees
near the watering place, setting forth the ship's name, date, etc."</p>
<p>Yet another link was to connect the "Endeavour" with this new land, for on
the night of April 30th--by civil reckoning--Cook lost one of his ship's
company. A seaman named Forby Sutherland died, whom they buried next morning on
shore at a spot near the watering-place. Then for the first time an Englishman
was laid to rest in Australian soil. This, Cook tells us, "occasioned my
calling the south point of the bay Point Sutherland." It was also the place
where he first landed, which is now marked by a memorial, the point being known
as Inscription Point.</p>
<p>The Philosophical Society, a hundred years ago, placed a brass plate at
Kurnell to commemorate the discovery of Australia's eastern shores; and Barron
Field, the friend of Charles Lamb, wrote these lines in honour of the
occasion:</p>
<p>Here fix the tablet. This must be the place<br>
Where our Columbus of the South did land;<br>
He saw the Indian village on the sand,<br>
And on this rock first met the simple race<br>
Of Austral Indians, who presum'd to face<br>
With lance and spear his musket. Close at hand<br>
Is the clear stream, from whence his vent'rous band<br>
Refresh'd their ship, and thence a little space<br>
Lies Sutherland, their shipmate; for the sound<br>
Of Christian burial better did proclaim<br>
Possession than the flag of England's name.<br>
These were the <i>Commelinae</i>[*] Banks first found;<br>
But where's the tree with the ship's wood-carv'd frame?<br>
Fix, then, the Ephesian brass; 'tis classic ground."</p>
<blockquote>[* A genus of herbaceous plants called in honour of Commelin, a
Dutch botanist.]</blockquote>

<h4>TABLET PLACED AT KURNELL (IN 1822) BY THE PHILOSOPHICAL SOCIETY</h4>
</center>
<p>When Cook and his party had disembarked at this point they found a few small
huts made of bark in which four or five little children were hiding, to whom
beads and other presents were given. A number of spears lay about the huts and
these the visitors took away. The spears varied in length from six to fifteen
feet. One sort had four prongs, which were headed with very sharp fish bones
besmeared with a green-coloured gum. These were regarded as poisonous. The
canoes, lying upon the beach, Cook thought were "the worst" he had ever seen.
They were from twelve to fourteen feet long, made of one piece of bark drawn or
tied up at each end and kept open by means of pieces of stick-by way of
thwarts."</p>
<p>After the first sharp encounter with the natives the visitors frequently saw
them while the ship remained in the bay. They appeared to possess darker skins
than any previously met with on the voyage. "Their beards were thick and
bushy," and the hair of their heads as well, yet "by no means woolly." To Banks
these men looked "of a common size, lean and seemed active and nimble; their
voices coarse and strong." On the first night from the "Endeavour" many moving
lights were noticed at different parts of the bay, and Banks conjectured that
the natives were spearing fish in the darkness, after the manner of many other
South Sea Islanders. He had already seen seaweed stuck in the prongs of some of
the fishgigs found in the huts.</p>
<p>The country within the vicinity of the harbour was explored thoroughly by
the British seamen. On the 30th a watering party had been sent to the south
point to dig holes in the sand; from these, and with water obtained from a
small stream afterwards discovered, the ship was sufficiently supplied, and the
wooding parties found there an abundance of wood.</p>
<p>Cook made an excursion into the inland country on May 1st, and says that it
was "diversified with woods, lawns, and marshes. The woods free from
underwood...and the trees at such a distance from one another that the whole
country, or at least great part of it, might be cultivated without being
obliged to cut down a single tree." He perceived "the soil everywhere, except
in the marshes, to be a light white sand," producing "a quantity of good grass
which grows in little tufts about as big as one can hold in one's hand and
pretty close together."</p>
<p>He came upon native huts and impressions in the grass where the blacks had
been sleeping, and a glimpse was caught of a single native-the others having
apparently fled. Just before starting on this expedition Cook had visited some
native habitations near the watering-place and had placed several articles in
them, such as cloth, looking glasses, combs, beads, and nails, as presents for
their owners, and some were now left in these newly discovered.</p>
<p>Mr. Banks and Dr. Solander, who went with Cook's party, collected specimens
of flowering and other plants growing there. Every one of these seemed new and
most of them were in full bloom. The leaves of the trees turned edgeways
towards the branches and resembled those described by Dampier. Some of the
plants were of uncommon shades of colour and resembled heaths; others of
strange form grew wild; with many species of long, graceful rushes and grasses,
green moss and ferns--chiefly of the kind known as maidenhair--flourishing in
such profusion that a few days later Cook changed the name of Stingray Bay,
which he had given to this portion of the Australian coast, and wrote in his
journal: "The great quantity of plants Mr. Banks and Dr. Solander found in this
place occasioned my giving it the name of Botany Bay."</p>
<p>Curious animals ran about the woods. Between the trees Dr. Solander had a
glimpse of a small one "something like a rabbit; Mr. Banks's greyhound "just
got sight of him," and lamed himself on a tree stump trying to chase it, while
traces were found of a larger one which was certainly the kangaroo. There were
also "footprints of an animal clawed like a dog or wolf" and of another whose
feet were like those of a polecat.[*] Here and there trees had been cut down
with a blunt instrument, others were barked, and in many of the palms steps
three or four feet apart (not five as Tasman had seen farther southward) were
cut to enable the natives to climb them.</p>
<blockquote>[* Banks's Journal.]</blockquote>
<p>Of two sorts of gum found in this excursion "one sort," says Cook, "is like
Gum Dragon, and is the same, I suppose, Tasman took for Gum Lac; it is
extracted from the largest tree in the woods." In mentioning the timber trees
Banks refers to one species which he saw--possibly the identical tree that Cook
describes--yielding gum much like <i>Sanguis draconis;</i> these descriptions
being apparently the first references to the <i>Eucalyptus</i> or gum tree of
this part of Australia. Other trees bearing a fruit of the Jambosa[*] kind, in
colour and shape resembling cherries, of which the men ate plentifully, are
mentioned later by Banks as growing on the shores of the harbour. At a later
date Cook again refers to the timber trees. He says: "Although wood is here in
great plenty yet there is very little variety: the biggest trees are as large
or larger than our oaks in England, grow a good deal like them and yield a
reddish gum," in which description we recognize yet another species of our old
friend the <i>Eucalyptus</i>. He continues: "The wood itself is heavy, hard,
and black, like Lignum Vitae. Another sort grows tall and straight something
like pines--the wood of this is hard and ponderous...something of the nature of
America live oak." He also remarks: "There are a few sorts of shrubs and
several palm trees and mangroves about the head of the harbour." Of the country
at this part he says it is "woody, low, and flat," and he thought the soil "in
general sandy."</p>
<blockquote>[* The Malay apple.]</blockquote>
<p>In the woods he saw a variety of very beautiful birds, such as cockatoos,
loriquets, parrots, etc., and crows which he thought "exactly like those we
have in England." Like every English explorer in every age, Cook found a
resemblance in something in the new land to one of its kind "at home." "As in
England" and "like those we have in England" are phrases that seem to ring
through the stories of British discoverers, as if they had found pleasure in
making the comparison.</p>
<p>On the afternoon of Wednesday, May 2nd, Cook went on shore to the
watering-place and caught sight of seventeen or eighteen natives. In the
forenoon Mr. Gore, the second lieutenant, had been dredging for oysters and had
met some of them, who followed him and his companion at a distance of ten or
twenty yards. Whenever Mr. Gore turned and faced them, they stood still; but
though they were all armed they never offered to attack him. A short time
afterwards the same natives were met by Dr. Monkhouse and his companions, who
made a "sham retreat." They had no sooner done so than the natives threw their
spears after them. Cook wished to speak with the blacks, and he, Solander, and
Tupia tried to come up with them, but he could not by words or by signs prevail
upon them to wait for him to approach them.</p>
<p>On the 3rd, accompanied by Mr. Banks and Dr. Solander, Cook made a short
excursion along the sea coast to the southward. On entering the bush they met
three natives, who ran away, as did some others seen later, much to Cook's
disappointment. Next morning he went in the pinnace with Solander and Monkhouse
to the head of Botany Bay, and on the way they caught sight of ten or twelve
natives fishing, each in his own small canoe, who, on seeing them, at once drew
into shoal water. At the first place at which they landed some others took to
their canoes before the Englishmen could get near them. After this Cook
continued his journey by boat and went almost to the head of the bay, where he
landed and travelled inland for some distance.</p>
<p>The country looked much like that near the coast but the soil was better, a
deep black mould replacing the sand in many places and it was thought capable
of producing grain.[*] Besides timber there was "as fine meadow as ever was
seen," and Cook also notes that the stone there was of sandstone character,
"and very proper for building "--a suggestion of its future usefulness which
time has verified.</p>
<blockquote>[* Don Luis N&eacute;e (botanist to the Spanish expedition under
Malaspina), who visited Sydney in 1793, wrote of this part of the country much
as Cook did, although many have wondered whether "meadows" ever existed there.
N&eacute;e says of his excursion.. "I saw a few places suitable for
agriculture: among them some patches of black earth...and a plain of half a
league whichIthink would yield wheat or barley because...it bears
<i>Melaleuca</i> and rushes, which show there is some humidity in the soil. It
was composed of vegetable mould."]</blockquote>
<p>On this morning Banks, who did not accompany Cook, devoted his time to
drying and preparing his botanical specimens on shore, spreading them in the
sun, turning them, and sometimes turning the paper in which the plants were
placed inside out. By this means all the specimens were brought on board in
good condition at night. While he was thus engaged eleven canoes with a black
fellow in each came towards him, who, however, paid no attention to him but
proceeded to fish. Opposite to their fishing ground some of the "Endeavour's"
people were occupied in shooting. One black fellow, prompted perhaps by
curiosity, hauled up his canoe and went towards them. He stayed about a quarter
of an hour, then went off in his boat. Banks believed that he had been
stealthily watching the strangers from behind the trees, although when
questioned no one appeared to have seen him. When the evening grew too damp for
him to continue his work any longer, Banks sent his plants and books on board
and went on a shooting excursion, intending to get some specimens of birds for
his collection. He put up a large number of quail much resembling English ones,
of which he could have shot a great many more had he not wanted birds of
different varieties.</p>
<p>On the 4th Mr. Gore determined to try his hand at spearing fish.[*] He had
observed quantities of large sting-ray following the flowing tide into the
shallows and met with instant success, striking several when they were in not
more than two or three feet of water. One, after it was cleaned, weighed 239
lbs. On disturbing the natives at their fires the British often found fresh
mussels broiling upon the coals, and at one place heaps of very large oyster
shells lay scattered around. The seine was hauled at different parts of the
bay; and in a cove on the north side on April 30th the catch weighed about 300
lbs. On May 5th on the north shore the sailors took a number of
leather-jackets, a fish with a tough skin, in which the scales are
embedded.</p>
<blockquote>[* Banks's journal.]</blockquote>
<p>Numbers of water-fowl sought their food in the sand and mud. Most of these
were unknown to the visitors. Especially noticeable was one sort, black and
white and as large as a goose but most like a pelican. This, according to a
note of Admiral Wharton, was probably the black and white, or palmated, goose,
now extinct there.</p>
<p>On the flats and mudbanks there were many kinds of shellfish, apparently the
chief support of the natives, since, so far as could be observed, they did not
eat the sting-ray. At the same time, says Cook, "they catch other sorts of
fish, which we found roasting on their fires, some of which they strike with
their gigs." Possibly he was referring to snapper.</p>
<p>At first the commander had intended to leave the harbour on Friday, May 4th,
but as the wind would not permit him to sail, he gave orders for parties to go
out in different directions to try to find the natives and speak with them. A
midshipman succeeded in meeting with two very old Australians, man and woman,
both grey headed, with whom were two small children, all being naked. They were
sitting under a tree close to the water side watching some other natives
gathering shellfish into their canoes. The midshipman went up to the old people
and gave them a parrot that he had just shot, but they would not touch it.
Neither would they say one word, and appeared to be too frightened to speak.
Being alone the midshipman was afraid to stay long with them lest the other
natives should discover him. The man had bushy hair and his beard was long and
rough. The woman's hair was cropped short. On this day Dr. Monklhouse narrowly
escaped a spear thrown by a native from a tree.</p>
<p>On Sunday, May 6th, Cook took his departure from the bay. Of his going he
writes: "Having seen everything this place afforded, we at daylight weighed
with a light breeze at N.W. and put to sea, and the wind soon after coming to
the southward we steered alongshore N.N.E., and at noon we were by observation
in the latitude Of 33&deg;50' S., about two or three miles from the land and
abreast of a bay, wherein there appeared to be safe anchorage, which I called
Port Jackson."[*] This entry tells us that as Cook's ship drew level with the
heads of Port Jackson lie had a glimpse of the harbour within. Had he looked
farther into this "bay" he would have seen how widely it extended and at the
same time would have robbed Captain Phillip of the credit of discovering it
eighteen years later.</p>
<blockquote>[* In honour of Mr. George Jackson, afterwards Sir George
Duckett.]</blockquote>
<p>But Cook did not enter there. And this Mother of Harbours, whose waters
gleam in a hundred coves, was destined to remain unseen. Her rocky, moss-grown
points, her miniature islands, and her sandy beaches all lay undisturbed as the
great seaman passed on his way. Yet the name of Port Jackson still is linked
with that of Cook, for in after years from there, through the heads which he
had seen, came Flinders and King in the discovery ships "Norfolk" (1799),
"Investigator" and "Lady Nelson" (1802), "Mermaid" (1819-20), and "Bathurst"
(1821) to finish his work--the immense work which Cook had already begun--the
charting of the East Coast.</p>
<p>That others on board the "Endeavour" could see something more than a plain
coast-line at this time is apparent from thee remarks in Banks's journal. He
writes: "The land we sailed past during the whole forenoon appeared broken and
likely for harbours." The "Endeavour" continued on her way northward, keeping
near the coast, and at sunset passed more broken land that formed a bay which
Cook named Broken Bay.[*] All night he steered at a distance of about three
leagues off shore, and next day saw high land projecting in three bluff points
which he called Cape Three Points. The wind now dropped, and on the 8th at noon
"our situation," he tells us, "was nearly the same as yesterday, having not
advanced one step farther to the northward."</p>
<blockquote>[* It is said that this "broken land like a bay" was that in the
vicinity of Narrabeen Lagoon. "Historical Records of New South
Wales."]</blockquote>
<p>While standing off shore on the evening of the 9th a charming sea scene was
witnessed by those in the "Endeavour" of which Parkinson has left a
description. "We saw two of the most beautiful rainbows my eyes ever beheld;
the colours were strong, clear, and lively. Those of the inner one were so
bright as to reflect its shadow on the water." At midnight Cook stood in for
the land again until eight next morning and had so little wind that the vessel
could hardly fetch Cape Three Points. At noon on the 10th "a small round rock
or island lying close under the land" was noticed bearing south-west three or
four leagues. This was Nobby Head at the entrance to the port which came to be
known afterwards as Newcastle on account of the abundance of coal in its
vicinity.</p>
<p>On the 11th, at 4 p.m., the "Endeavour" passed a low rocky point only a mile
distant, "with an inlet on its north side that appeared to me from the
mast-head to be sheltered from all winds," remarks Cook, who named the headland
and the inlet Point and Port Stephens respectively. The next morning at eight
he saw "a high point...which made in two hillocks" and called it Cape Hawke in
honour of Admiral Hawke, then First Lord of the Admiralty.</p>
<p>On the afternoon of the 12th the "Endeavour" ran along the shore and those
on board could see the smoke of native fires a little way inland. Several had
been seen the day before, but on this day Cook noticed one upon the top of a
hill, and writes:</p>
<p>"It was the first we have seen upon elevated ground since we have been upon
the coast." On this day "three remarkable hills," large and high and "
contiguous to each other," bore north-north-west, and because they were so
alike they were named The Three Brothers.[*] On Sunday, May 13th, while
standing northward after having tacked several times, Cook observed "a point or
headland on which were fires that caused a great quantity of smoke, which
occasioned my giving it the name of Smoky Cape."</p>
<blockquote>[* At the back of Kempsey.]</blockquote>
<p>Of the aspect of the country he says: "The land hath increased in height
insomuch that...it may be called a hilly country; it is diversified with an
agreeable variety of hills, ridges, and valleys and large plains all clothed
with wood. Near the shore the land is in general low and sandy except the
points which are rocky, while over many are pretty high hills which at first
rising out of the water appear like an island."</p>
<p>Fresh gales with rain and hail swept over the ship as she passed outside
some small rocky islands that were first seen on the 15th, and called the
Solitary Islands. On that morning as they steered close in to the land again,
natives could be seen on shore through the glasses. According to one
historian,[*] each of these natives was loaded with a bundle which looked like
palm leaves. A high point bearing north-west-by-west was named Cape Byron after
the " Dolphin's " captain (in her first voyage to the Pacific), while to the
north-west of it again "a remarkable sharp-peaked mountain" was sighted.</p>
<blockquote>[* Pinkerton: "Cook's First Voyage." See also Cunningham's
journal.]</blockquote>
<p>At sunset breakers were discovered on the larboard bow, only five miles from
the land. The commander therefore hauled the ship off it, and brought her to.
She lay with her head eastward till ten o'clock, when, the soundings having
increased, he wore ship and "lay her with her head in shore" until 5 a.m. on
the 16th, when he made sail. By daylight breakers were again seen between the
ship and the shore and were stretching from a point--under which lay a small
island--"eastward for a distance of two leagues."[*] The point off which these
shoals lay was called by Cook Point Danger[**] and the curious mountain seen
the day before was then given the name of Mount Warning.</p>
<blockquote>[* Danger Reefs, three rocky patches which extend three miles east
from Cook Island.]</blockquote>
<blockquote>[** Point Danger is the north head of the Tweed
River.]</blockquote>
<h4>POINT DANGER TO COOKTOWN</h4>
<p>On Thursday, May 17th, another point of land was discovered and christened
Point Lookout. On the north side of it there was a wide, open bay, which Cook
named Morton's Bay, in honour of James Earl of Morton, who was then President
of the Royal Society. The name, however, is now spelled Moreton Bay.[*]</p>
<blockquote>[* King says: "At first Moreton Bay was called Glass House Bay, but
as Cook had bestowed the name of Moreton Bay upon the strait [Rous Channel] to
the south of Moreton Island, this name became generally accepted." Oxley made
the discovery that Point Lookout was situated on Stradbroke
Island.]</blockquote>
<p>The land at the head of the bay appeared so low that he writes: "I could but
just see it from the topmast-head." Nor could he see the river which fell into
the bay on its western side, on whose banks now stands the town of
Brisbane--the capital of Queensland.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, Cook gives us the information that some on board were of the
opinion that there was a river in the vicinity as the water looked so pale.
Banks clearly was one of these, for he Writes on that day: "The sea here
suddenly changed from its usual transparency to a dirty clay colour as if
charged with freshes, from whence I was led to conclude that the bottom of the
bay might open into a large river."</p>
<p>In marking the situation of Moreton Bay, Cook observes:[*] "This place may
always be found by Three Hills which lay to the northward of it. These hills
were not far apart and were a little island and their singular form of
elevation...which resembles a glass-house occasioned my giving them that name.
The northernmost of the three is the highest and largest."</p>
<blockquote>[* Matthew Flinders examined Moreton Bay in 1799, but Oxley
discovered that Moreton Bay extended as far south as 28&deg;, where it
communicated with the sea.]</blockquote>
<p>At noon a low bluff point which formed the southern point of an open sandy
bay from here bore north-west,[*] distant three leagues. Cook steered
alongshore and saw at daylight on the 18th a point which bore south-west of
him. He had seen it before but now named it Double Island Point, on account of
its figure, because "it looks like two small islands lying under the land." The
shores of the mainland within it were moderately high, but appeared more barren
than any yet seen and more sandy. Banks saw the sand lying there in great
patches of many acres which had only lately moved, for "trees in the middle of
them were quite green."[**] Here the coast trended to the north-west and formed
a large open bay, which was named Wide Bay.</p>
<blockquote>[* "The Bay is Laguna Bay, and the point is called Low
Bluff."--Wharton.]</blockquote>
<blockquote>[** Probably a species of <i>Acacia</i>. Cunningham saw one variety
growing in "glittering red sand" in Exmouth Gulf.]</blockquote>
<p>On Sunday, 20th, a number of natives assembled on a black bluff or point of
land, and it was evident that they had come to watch the ship go past, which to
them must have been indeed a strange sight. Cook accordingly called the point
Indian Head. Curiously enough, nearly thirty-two years later twenty-five
natives gathered on the same spot to watch Flinders sail by in command of the
two ships "Investigator" and "Lady Nelson." The blacks who watched the
"Endeavour" had possibly in some way warned their neighbours of the ship's
approach, as natives were now observed in other places on shore, and Cook
records that there were "smokes in the day and fires in the night."</p>
<p>At daylight the northernmost land loomed high and ended in a point, from
which a reef was discovered running northward as far as eye could see. Breakers
were plainly seen soon afterwards "a long way upon our lee bow, which seemed to
stretch quite home to the land." The point of land, on account of its having
two very large patches of sand upon it, was named Sandy Cape.[*] Cook now fell
in with one of the dangerous shoals that surround the reef here, and possibly
this is the reason why Flinders, who followed him in 1802, found the trend of
the land different from that laid down in Cook's chart. Or perhaps Cook's ship
may have claimed his whole attention. On the 21st the "Endeavour" crept along
the east side of the shoal until, judging that there was enough water to allow
her to get across it, the commander ordered a boat to be lowered, and sent it
ahead to sound; a passage over the shoal was thus found, and eventually the
ship passed over the tail. Cook named the shoal Weak Sea Spit, because there
was smooth water within it, whereas upon te whole coast to the southward he had
always had a high sea or swell from the south-east.</p>
<blockquote>[* Sandy Cape is the northern point of Great Sandy Island...a
channel called Great Sandy Strait separates the latter from the mainland and
opens at its northern end into Hervey Bay; within its entrance is Wide Bay
Harbour--"Admiralty Sailing Directions."]</blockquote>
<p>"For these few days past we have seen at times a sort of sea sea-fowl which
we have nowhere seen before," Cook writes; "they are of the sort called
boobies...Last night a small flock of these birds passed the ship and went away
to the N.W. and this morning from half an hour before sunrise to half an hour
after, flights of them were continually coming from N.N.W. and flying to
S.S.E., and not one was seen to fly in any other direction. From this, we did
suppose there was a river or inlet of shallow water to the southward of us, and
that, not very far to the northward, lay some islands where they retired to at
night." Captain Flinders thought that probably the birds Cook saw retired for
the night to Bunker Group in 23&deg;54' S. and 152&deg;25' E. and that they
went to Hervey Bay during the day.</p>
<p>On the 22nd the shore inland appeared thickly clothed with wood, and through
the glasses trees were seen resembling palm-nut trees, <i>Pandanus
tectorius</i> according to Banks, who in giving their botanical name states
that the species had not been met with since the "Endeavour" left the islands
within the tropics. In the evening Cook anchored about thirty miles south-east
from the south head of Bustard Bay. On this night he saw a watersnake; and two
or three evenings previously one had lain under the ship's stern for some time.
Banks also saw two swim past the ship, "beautifully spotted and in all respects
like land-snakes except that they had broad, flat tails, which probably serve
them instead of fins in swimming."[*]</p>
<blockquote>[* Evidently the deadly species known as the yellow-bellied
sea-snake, which has a broad, flat, spotted tail, and is blackish-brown on the
back and yellow beneath. "It is unique in that its keeled tail does the dual
work of propeller and rudder." It is the commonest Australian sea-snake and
very venomous, "Outdoor Australia," "Sydney Mail."]</blockquote>
<p>The "Endeavour" now came abreast of a large open bay where Cook anchored on
May 23rd at 8 p.m., and next morning went ashore accompanied by Banks and
several officers. The party landed on the south point of the bay, where there
was a channel which led to a lagoon. The commander sounded and surveyed the
channel, and, after the boat had gone about a mile, met with a little shoal
which he was able to pass over. A small stream of fresh water was discovered,
and then he made an excursion into the woods; he also wished to row up the
lagoon, but was stopped everywhere by the shallows.</p>
<p>However, he was able to inspect a native camping ground on the west side of
this lagoon and found ten small fires close together with cockle shells lying
around them, and saw (as Dampier had seen in the north-west) at the side of the
fire a piece of bark about a foot and a half high propped up to keep the wind
off; some other pieces lay strewn around which Cook concluded were coverings
used by the natives at night and that many of them slept in the open. There
were trees here of the same kind as had been seen in Botany Harbour; one grew
like birch but he found its bark entirely different from birch bark.
Unfortunately he was unable to see what the wood of this tree was like, having
brought no axe with him. Around the outskirts of the lagoon he noticed the true
mangrove, such as grew in the West Indies and which had already been met with
on this voyage; and there was a sort of palm, similar to those noticed in low
sandy places in the South Sea Islands. "All or most of the land and water fowl
seen at Botany Harbour," he says, "were found here, besides bustards such as we
have in England, which occasioned my giving the place the name of Bustard Bay."
Some black and white duck were here also and plenty of small oysters, sticking
to the rocks, stones, and mangroves; and on the mudbanks under the mangrove
trees Banks observed a large proportion of small pearl oysters, and he wondered
whether the sea might abound with full-grown ones, for if so, he thought, a
pearl fishery must turn out to immense advantage."</p>
<p>In the branches of mangroves on the sides of the lagoon they found a number
of nests of ants, of which one species was quite green. The ants when disturbed
came out in large numbers and "revenged themselves upon their disturbers,
biting more sharply than any I have felt in Europe," according to Banks, who
describes them in his journal. "The mangroves had another trap...This was a
small kind of caterpillar, green and beset with many hairs...which sat together
upon the leaves...like soldiers drawn up, 20 or 30 perhaps on one leaf. If
these wrathful militia were touched...they did not fail to make the person
offending sensible of their anger, every hair...stinging as much as nettles do,
with a more acute though less lasting smart." Banks saw upon the sides of the
hills many trees yielding gum. They differed from those seen on May 1st in
having longer leaves, like those of the weeping willow; these trees were of a
different species of <i>Eucalyptus</i> from the trees seen farther to the
southward, and he also for the first time saw "the plant (<i>Xanthorrhcea</i>)
yielding the yellow gum," of which there were vast numbers.</p>
<p>While engaged in fishing, two days later, he relates how some crabs took our
baits and sometimes suffered themselves to be hauled into the ship." One sort
(<i>Cancer pelagicus</i>?, Linn.) was ornamented "with the finest ultramarine
blue conceivable, with which all his claws and every joint were deeply tinged.
The under part was of a lovely white, shining as if glazed and perfectly
resembling the white of old china."</p>
<p>On Thursday, 24th, at 4 a.m., the "Endeavour " weighed with a gentle breeze
and made sail out of Bustard Bay. She soon met with breakers, while land
"making like islands" bore north-west-by-north. At nine on the morning of the
25th the ship drew level with the northernmost point of the mainland, which
looked white and barren; and as it lay directly under the Tropic of Capricorn
was named Cape Capricorn.[*] On the west side of the cape there appeared to be
a lagoon, and " on the two spits that form the entrance " were a great number
of pelicans, at least so I call them," adds Cook, fearless of all
criticism.</p>
<blockquote>[* The eastern point of Curtis Island.]</blockquote>
<p>He believed that the northernmost land he then saw formed an island, and was
correct in this conjecture. It was afterwards named Hummocky Island by Matthew
Flinders, who learned its true dimensions. Next morning the ship passed what
looked like the mouth of a river, and shortly afterwards a similar indentation
was noticed. Far away inland the smoke of native fires could be seen rising;
and again, in the afternoon, Cook was convinced that there was either a river,
lagoon, or inlet close at hand.[*]</p>
<blockquote>[* The Fitzroy River empties itself into the south-western part of
Keppel Bay. Keppel Bay is situated between Cape Capricorn and Keppel
Isles.]</blockquote>
<p>The "Endeavour" now was steering directly between the coast and the Great
Barrier Reef. Her course was becoming more and more dangerous. Cook did not
even know that this great reef existed, but he saw the increasing number of
shoals and was warned that he must exercise great care. Over and over again his
fine seamanship extricated his ship from the perils lining her path. Besides
the shoals, spurs of rock and numbers of islands lie off the coast, and on
Sunday, 27th, while the "Endeavour" was standing through the channel between
Great Keppel Island and the mainland, the master, who was sounding with two
boats, found in many places only two and a half fathoms of water. When he
brought back his report the ship had already anchored, and the wind veering,
she sailed back three or four miles, but again had to come to an anchorage,
where she remained until a passage for her could be found by the boats. At
length she passed out between Great Keppel and North Keppel Islands.</p>
<p>Having left the Keppel Islands behind Cook next saw Cape Manifold, and he
says he so named it because of the number of high hills over it. It lies
north-west distant seventeen leagues from Cape Capricorn, and "between them the
shore forms a large bay which I called Keppel's Bay."</p>
<p>On the 28th he came close in with Cape Townshend, which he named and which
he describes as being "more barren than woody." The "Endeavour" then met with
the many islands which lie scattered up and down the coast to the northward,
forming a part of the Northumberland Islands. A large inlet--known to us as
Shoalwater Bay--was seen to trend to the south-east.[*] A little later the ship
ran into shoal water. With a boat taking soundings ahead, the "Endeavour"
followed west-by-north, leaving many islets, rocks, and shoals between her and
the mainland. Just before noon the boat made the signal for meeting with
another shoal, upon which Cook immediately let go an anchor and brought the
ship up "with all sails standing." A strong tide was running, and he thought
that this tide "carried us so quickly upon the shoal."</p>
<blockquote>[* The entrance to Shoalwater Bay lies between Cape Townshend and
Pier Head. The bay itself extends thirty-five miles to the south-east in the
direction of Cape Manifold and divides into several branches.]</blockquote>
<p>The ship was then on what is known as "the Donovan Shoal" in Broad Sound
Channel. Fortunately no harm came to her and at three o'clock she made sail
again, but at six o'clock on the same day (the 29th) anchored once more two
miles off the mainland and still in sight of a number of islands. At five next
morning the master was sent with two boats to sound the entrance of an inlet,
which bore west, about one league distant. He soon made a signal for an
anchorage and the vessel stood within the inlet, which was believed to be the
mouth of a river, but which in reality was a strait leading into Broad Sound,
which Cook was to name later. A search for water was made, and because he found
none Cook named the place Thirsty Sound.[*] Here on May 30th he went on shore
with a party, and immediately proceeded to mount "a pretty high hill before
sunrise in order to get a view of the coast and the islands." Cook called the
hill, which is situated at the north-west entrance of Thirsty Sound, the Pier
Head. He then started to survey the inlet and got about eight leagues up it
when he discovered that it formed a large lake which communicated with the sea.
He saw two natives, but of these he only had a glimpse at some distance. The
party got no fresh water or refreshment of any kind, and although they saw
turtle, "caught none nor no sort of fish or wild fowl only a few
landbirds."</p>
<blockquote>[* Thirsty ound is the narrow strait separating Quail and Long
Islands from the mainland--"Admiralty Sailing Directions."]</blockquote>
<p>The earth here looked a hard red clay; the trees were of different kinds and
all the uplands clear of underwood; the lowlands were overrun with mangroves.
Oysters were to be had, but Cook thought they were so small as not to be worth
picking off the rocks.</p>
<p>For Banks, however, the place seems to have had attractions, in spite of a
troublesome grass which it was impossible to avoid, and which he thus
describes: "Its sharp seeds were bearded backwards, and whenever they stuck
into our clothes were by these beards pushed forward till they got into the
flesh...This grass, with the mosquitoes that were likewise innumerable, made
walking almost intolerable." He continues: "We were not, however, to be
repulsed, but proceeded into the country. The gum trees were like those in the
last bay, both in leaf and in producing a very small proportion of gum; on the
branches of them and of other trees were large ants' nests made of clay as big
as a bushel. The ants...were small...In another species of tree
<i>(Xanthoxyloides mite)</i> a small...black ant had bored all the twigs and
lived in quantities in the hollow part where the pith should be: the tree
nevertheless flourishing and bearing leaves upon those branches as freely and
well as upon others that were sound. Insects in general were plentiful,
butterflies especially...On the leaves of the gum tree we found a pupa or
chrysalis which shone as brightly as if it had been silvered over with the most
burnished silver...It was brought on board and the next day came out into a
butterfly of a velvet black changeable to blue."</p>
<p>On the 31st the "Endeavour's" course took her between the Duke Islands (the
largest group of the Northumberland Islands) and the reefs and islands lying
north-west of Thirsty Sound. Here once more she got into shoal water, and, on
June 1st, the anchor had to be let go. The boats having sounded about the shoal
again the vessel set sail and finally came to an anchorage under the lee of
three islands lying off the northern approach to an inlet which Cook named
Broad Sound.[*] A bluff, rocky headland forming its north-west entrance he
called Cape Palmerston, and a pretty high promontory seen at noon on</p>
<blockquote>[* These were the Bedwell Islands--Wharton.]</blockquote>
<p>Saturday, June 2nd, Cape Hillsborough. The shores of the mainland were
clothed with wood, and as the ship steered between the mainland and another
group of islands, mountains and hills, plains and valleys came into view. The
islands belonged to the straggling group stretching for sixty miles along the
Queensland coast which Cook named the Cumberland Islands in honour of Henry
Frederick Duke of Cumberland.</p>
<p>On Sunday, June 3rd, Cook discovered a passage thirty miles long between the
mainland and some islands lying off the coast.[*] In passing through it Cook
writes: "This passage I have named Whit Sunday's Passage as it was discovered
on the day the Church commemorates that Festival." He thought the whole of it
was "one continued safe harbour" with small bays and coves on each side "where
ships might lay as it were in a basin," but he did not wait to examine it as he
was unwilling to lose the benefit of the moonlight. The land on both sides
formed hills and valleys, "diversified with woods and lawns that looked green
and pleasant." A small island in the passage is called Pentecost Island. On a
sandy beach upon one of the islands two natives were seen and "a canoe with an
outrigger larger and differently built to any we have seen upon the coast."</p>
<blockquote>[* The east side of this channel is formed by the northern portion
of the Cumberland Islands from Shaw Island to Hayman Island.]</blockquote>
<p>As the "Endeavour"--under easy sail, and having gentle breezes and clear
weather--skirted this portion of Queensland's shores, numberless capes and bays
received their names. Each day saw new designations selected by Cook as most
suitable take their places on his chart, among which were Cape Conway and
Repulse Bay (so named because he was forced to haul the ship away from it) on
June 3rd; Cape Gloucester and Edgecumbe Bay on the 4th; Cape Upstart and
Cleveland Bay on the 5th and 6th respectively; while on the 7th a group of
islands named the Palm Islands was charted. On one of the islets of this group
next day a quantity of smoke on shore made it apparent that large native fires
were burning; and men, women, and children gathered together upon the small
islet could be made out through the glasses, gazing at the ship. Thinking that
he could see coco-nut trees, the fruit of which, he says, would have been very
acceptable, the commander sent Lieutenant Hicks to try and obtain some, and Mr.
Banks and Dr. Solander went with the party. They were disappointed, and Cook
wrote in his journal: "They met with nothing worth observing." Natives were
heard there, but not seen, and the trees turned out to be not coco-nut but
cabbage palms.</p>
<p>A point now received the name of Point Hillock on account of its shape.[*]
Between it and a cape to the southward which had been called Cape Cleveland,
the shore formed a large bay, that was christened Halifax Bay. It was sheltered
from all winds by the islands lying close to it. Having passed Point Hillock in
following the land, the vessel met with another point which Cook named Cape
Sandwich. From it the coast ran first west and then north and formed a fine
large bay to which was given the name of Rockingham Bay. Cook thought this bay
well sheltered and affording good anchorage, but he says that having met with
so little encouragement by going ashore, he would not wait to land, and,
instead, he continued to range along the coast until he fell in with what he
calls "a parcel of small islands" known to us as the Family Islands. Through
these he found a channel a mile wide, between the three outermost and those
nearer the shore, and went through it.</p>
<blockquote>[* It is near the southern extremity of Hinchinbrook Island which
Cook regarded as part of the main.]</blockquote>
<p>On one of the islands nearest to the ship a group of natives had collected
who watched the vessel very attentively. They were very dark in colour, quite
naked, and had short hair. This day's sail brought the "Endeavour" to that part
of the coast where the Great Barrier Reef draws in closer to the mainland and
consequently the dangers in her track were multiplied.</p>
<p>On the 9th she came abreast of some tolerably high land, the point of which
was named Cape Grafton, and on the 10th Cook anchored in a bay lying three
miles to the westward of it, a low, green, woody isle in the offing being
called by him Green Island. Here he went on shore to look for water,
accompanied by Banks and Solander. The bottom of the bay being low mangrove
land, they rowed out towards the head of the cape and found two small streams,
but on account of the surf and the rocks it was thought that it would be an
unsuitable place to water the ship. The country round was steep and rocky and
was left unexplored.</p>
<p>At midnight on June 10th, with showers of rain falling, but having little
wind, Cook weighed once more, and stood to the north-west. A little later, in
order to pass outside a low island lying about two leagues from the mainland,
he hauled off to the northward; it was one of the Low Isles, being partly under
water. Another island,[*] seven miles distant, was seen at noon, and at this
time Cape Grafton bore S. 29&deg; E. distant forty miles. Between it and the
northernmost land in sight a large but not very deep bay indented the shore;
Cook called it Trinity Bay, in honour of the day on which it was discovered,
and to the north point of it he gave the name of Cape Tribulation, "because,"
he says, "here began all our troubles."</p>
<blockquote>[* Called Snapper Island by Lieutenant Jeffreys in
1815.]</blockquote>
<p>The following evening (June 11th) there being a fine breeze and clear
moonlight the ship, while standing off the land, suddenly shoaled her water
from twelve, ten, and eight fathoms with great rapidity. Cook gave orders to
anchor, and then, as the lead before ten o'clock gave twenty fathoms, he
imagined there could be no danger in standing on once more. But again the water
suddenly shoaled, and a few minutes before eleven the Endeavour" struck a reef
and stuck fast.</p>
<p>Sails were hurriedly taken in and the boats were hoisted out in order to
sound the depth of water round the ship and if possible to ascertain her
position. A little later it was found that she had been carried over a ledge of
the rock upon which she had struck and lay in a hollow within it.</p>
<p>The coral rock was situated in lat. 15&deg;47' S., long. 145&deg;35' E.,
being only six or seven leagues from the shores of the mainland. It is now
known as Endeavour Reef.[*] Cook's coolness and promptitude at this period kept
his men together. There was no excitement; every order was quickly carried out.
The pumps were set to work to keep the leak in check, and heavy articles,
chiefly guns, and all kinds of ballast were thrown overboard.</p>
<blockquote>[* Endeavour Reef is 41 miles long, E. and W., and half a mile
broad. A fringe of sunken coral extends right round the reef.--"Admiralty
Sailing Directions."]</blockquote>
<p>The water being deepest astern Cook had the stream anchor carried out from
the starboard quarter and hove a great strain upon it to try to get the vessel
off the rock at high water, but without success, and she beat so violently
against it that the men could scarcely keep their feet. Their position grew
more and more perilous. By the light of the moon they could see the ship's
sheathing boards floating thickly around her. About midnight part of her false
keel came away, and as she settled down at ebb tide, a rock under her starboard
was plainly heard grating against her timbers, so that it was expected that at
any moment she might go to pieces. The best chance of saving her lay in
continuing to lighten the ship. Stores, guns, casks, iron and stone ballast and
other things were therefore thrown overboard after the rest. Fortunately the
sea was smooth and the weather fine, and on the 12th the sailors carried out
two bower anchors, one on the starboard quarter, the other right astern, and
"got blocks and tackles upon the cable and hove taut." It was seen that as the
tide rose the leak let in water fast, and three pumps hard at work could only
just keep the "Endeavour" clear.</p>
<p>At night the ship righted, but as she did so the water gained more and more
on the pumps, and as Cook expresses it, "threatened immediate destruction."
However, he resolved "to risk all and heave her off," and about twenty minutes
past ten o'clock, after having been twenty-three hours on the reef, she floated
and was hove into deep water, having at this time three feet nine inches of
water in the hold.</p>
<p>In this hazardous situation all hands turned resolutely to the pumps,
although for some time every one believed the task to be hopeless. Then it was
discovered that a mistake had been made by a seaman in taking the depth of
water which had greatly exaggerated the rapidity with which the leak had gained
on the pumps. When this became known it acted on the men like a charm. They
redoubled their vigour, so much so that next morning the pumps had actually
gained on the leak. The commander bestowed great praise on the men for their
conduct at this time, and he writes: "In justice to the ship's company, I must
say that no men ever behaved better."</p>
<p>Cook now stood in for the land, and he writes: "The leak decreaseth, but for
fear it should break out again we got the sail ready for fothering."The plan of
fothering the ship was executed by Mr. Monkhouse, one of the midshipmen who had
once seen a ship brought by this means from Virginia to London. He took an old
studding-sail and "mixed some oakum and wool, chopping it small, and placing it
in handfuls on the sail, where it was stitched down firmly. After being thus
prepared the sail was hauled under the ship and kept extended till the suction
carried the oakum and wool into the leak." This plan succeeded so well that
soon afterwards one pump sufficed to keep the water under.</p>
<p>At six in the evening the "Endeavour" anchored about five leagues distant
from the Australian coast and one from the shoal. The leak was still making
about fifteen inches of water an hour. Early next morning (the 14th) Cook
weighed and edged in for the land. At this time he says that he passed close
outside two small low islands and named them Hope Islands, for he remarks, "We
were always in hopes of being able to reach these islands." They are, however,
merely sand cays, very low and covered with bushes that lie midway between Cape
Tribulation and Endeavour River. The spirit shown by the officers and crew
throughout this trying period was worthy of the highest traditions of the Royal
Navy, but one realizes that all the care and responsibility rested upon the
shoulders of the commander, and his troubles do not seem to have been nearly
over. Shortly after noon he sent the master with two boats to sound ahead of
the ship and to look out for harbour within the mainland, as it was now very
necessary to find a place where the "Endeavour" in her disabled condition might
take refuge and have her defects repaired. At three o'clock in the afternoon an
opening was seen that had the appearance of leading into a harbour. The ship
stood off and on while the boats examined it, but it was found that there was
not sufficient depth of water for her to anchor.</p>
<p>On Cook's chart the name of Weary Bay was given to this opening. By that
time the sun was setting, and as there were many shoals around her the
"Endeavour" again anchored, being then about two miles from the Queensland
coast, which now trended from north-east to south-by-east. At eight o'clock at
night, to Cook's relief, one of the mates returned in the pinnace and reported
that he had found a good harbour two leagues away. This indentation is now
known to us as Cooktown, being so called in remembrance of Cook's sojourn
there. The great seaman himself bestowed upon the river at whose entrance it
lies the name of Endeavour River.</p>
<p>At six o'clock next morning Cook weighed and stood in towards this harbour,
but to avoid shoals that were visible he sent two boats ahead to lead the way,
and after they had passed the shoals the boats were ordered to examine the
channel leading into the inlet. However, the wind rose and it was thought
safest to anchor, the ship then being one mile from the shore. Signalling to
the boats to come on board, Cook went himself and buoyed the channel, which was
found to be narrow. The harbour itself though small appeared to be a most
convenient one.</p>
<p>It continued to blow fresh this day and the "Endeavour" was forced to remain
at anchor on the 15th and 16th, but an attempt to run into the inlet was made
on the 17th which nearly proved unsuccessful, as twice she ran ashore. On
Monday, the 18th, she was floated and warped in, being finally moored alongside
a steep beach on the south side of the river, where, on the same morning a
stage was erected from the ship to the shore.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER II</h3>
<h4>COOK AT ENDEAVOUR RIVER</h4>
<p>Once the ship was moored safely tents were pitched for the sick men, among
whom were Mr. Green, the astronomer, and Tupia, both showing symptoms of
scurvy.</p>
<p>Dr. Solander and Mr. Banks had already commenced plant-gathering. On the
18th, whilst roaming in search of specimens in the inland country, the latter
saw boughs of trees stuck in the ground by the natives to form the frames of
their gunyas, but none of the inhabitants were actually seen.</p>
<p>On the afternoon of the 19th, having given instructions for the sick men to
be brought on shore and the stores and ballast landed, Cook made his way to the
top of one of the highest hills overlooking the harbour to take a view of his
surroundings. Whenever it was possible he made a practice of doing this. The
country did not appear to possess many attractions; the low land near the river
was overgrown with mangroves and at every tide was covered with salt water; the
high land looked stony and barren.</p>
<p>Next morning the guns left on board were mounted on the quarter deck for
protection and a forge set up on shore so that the armourers could commence to
repair the ship. The powder, as well as most of the coals left in the hold,
were landed on the 22nd. Cook then cast loose the "Endeavour's" moorings and
warped her to a spot higher up the harbour which he had fixed upon as suitable
for carrying out the work. Her bow was hauled in to the beach, and her stern
kept afloat, so that when the tide went out the extent of her injuries could be
ascertained.</p>
<p>The leak was found to be "at her floor heads a little before the starboard
fore chains." On the following day Mr. Banks saw it and thus described it: "In
the middle was a hole large enough to have sunk a ship with twice our pumps,
but here Providence had most visibly worked in our favour, for it was in great
measure plugged up by a stone as big as a man's fist. Round the edges of this
stone (which was a piece of coral rock) had all the water come in...and here we
found the wool and oakum or fothering which had relieved us in so unexpected a
manner." He continues: "The effect of this coral rock...is difficult to
describe...It had cut through the plank and deep into one of her timbers,
smoothing the gashes...so that the whole might easily be imagined to have been
cut with an axe."</p>
<p>Each day the carpenters worked while the tide would permit them, and after
he had seen their task begun Cook was able to survey more of the country. He
had noticed a number of pigeons flying round the camp, so on the 23rd he sent
men across the river to try to kill some, when one of the shooting party caught
sight of a strange animal, "something less than a greyhound, it was of a mouse
colour, very slender made and swift of foot," this being the first description
of the kangaroo given to Cook, and, indeed, the first information he obtained
of its existence, although the animal seen by Pelsart, Dampier, and Vlamingh
and one of the smaller species from the Aru Islands which had been made known
in 1711 are said to have been the first kangaroos heard of in Europe. Next day
Cook saw one for himself, only a little way from the ship, and he says: "I
should have taken it for a wild dog, but for its walking and like a hare or
deer...the length running in which it jumped of the grass prevented my seeing
its legs."</p>
<p>Banks, who spent his time in penetrating inland, heard many different
accounts of it, and at once designated it "the animal of the country," as
indeed it was and is, though rather too rapidly decreasing. Later, too, he
tells us that it was called by the natives kangaroo, spelling the word thus,
and not, as it is spelled in Cook's journal, "kanguru." Banks tells of another
remarkable animal that had been seen by one of the seamen (an Irishman
surely!), who, having seen a flying fox, gave this description of it: "About as
large and much like a one-gallon cagg;[*] as black as the devil and had two
horns on its head; it went but slowly but I dared not touch it."</p>
<blockquote>[* Bank's journal.]</blockquote>
<p>To his dismay, on the 26th Banks found that most of his plants on board
which had been stowed in the bread-room were under water. The mischief being
done he began at once to try to restore them. Many were saved by his energy,
but some he could not revive. In his excursions into the bush he met with nests
of ants which he likens to the white ant of the East Indies, but harmless; and
he describes their nests as pyramidal in shape and varying from a few inches to
six feet in height. He thought that they resembled Druid monuments in England,
while Solander compared them to runic stones at Upsala in Sweden.</p>
<p>The botanists made baskets to hold their specimens, and the plants remained
fresh in these baskets for days. During the stay of the "Endeavour" in the
South Seas the men had learned how to weave them by watching the islanders at
work. At first specimens were dried by laying them in the sand; later it was
found that they would dry better in paper books, although one person was kept
entirely employed in attending to them and exposing the quires to the sun's
heat.</p>
<p>The coco palm did not grow at Endeavour River. Mr. Gore picked up, upon the
beach, the husk of a coco-nut, which had evidently been swept there by the
waves from some island to windward.[*] He also penetrated four or five miles
into the country, where he saw marks of men's feet and tracks of animals,
though he met with neither man nor beast. Some others from the ship, in their
rambles on the north side of Endeavour River, reached a spot where there were
fires burning which the natives had only just left. In these expeditions some
wild yams were found growing in a swampy place, and their tops proved so good
that on the 29th Cook sent a party to gather a quantity for the ship's company.
He tells how, on the night of this day, "Mr. Green and I observed an emersion
of Jupiter's first satellite, which took place at 2 hours 58 minutes 53 seconds
in the a.m.; the same emersion happened at Greenwich...on the 30th at 5 hrs 17
minutes 43 seconds a.m."; and he adds: "The difference is 14 hours 18 minutes
50 seconds equal to 214&deg;42'30" of Long.--which this place is W. of
Greenwich."[**]</p>
<blockquote>[* King says Cook imagined that it came from "Terra del
Esperitu."]</blockquote>
<blockquote>[** The true longitude is 214&deg;45'.]</blockquote>
<p>On Saturday, June 30th, while some midshipmen were making a plan of the
harbour, the commander ascended a hill now called Grassy Hill, which stands
close to the south point of the inlet, "to take a view of the sea." Its shores
were lined with shoals, and Cook was perplexed and anxious as to what route he
should take when he resumed his voyage. The heads of many rocks only just
showed above the water. "The only hopes I have of getting clear of them," he
says, " is to the northward, where there seems to be a passage."</p>
<p>Fortunately the sailors were greatly refreshed during their stay in this
harbour; and on July 2nd a good catch of fish supplied 2&frac12; lbs. for each
man. Next day at low water Cook had a number of empty casks, lashed together,
placed under the ship's bows and the stream anchor laid out in hopes of being
able to float her. He was now impatient to put to sea, and when the master, who
had been sent out on the previous day in the pinnace to look for a safe route,
reported at noon that he had found a passage for the ship, Cook decided to
leave at the first opportunity.</p>
<p>During his investigations the master had landed on a dry reef, and finding
some very large cockles (<i>Chima gigas</i>) brought back a boatload chiefly of
the cockles, "one alone being more than two men could eat." Mr. Molineux also
entered an indentation of the mainland three leagues to the northward of
Endeavour River, where he disturbed some natives, as he thought, at supper.
They quickly disappeared leaving behind them "some fresh sea eggs" and a fire
brightly burning, but there was no hut near. Cook thought at this time that the
natives had no boats large enough to convey them out to the shoals, but he
found out afterwards that they were in the habit of visiting the islands
between the Great Barrier Reef and the mainland.</p>
<p>At high water on Wednesday, 4th, the ship was again floated, and on the 5th
was beached on the sandbank on the south side of the river. At this spot a
monument was erected in memory of the event by the inhabitants of
Cooktown.[*]</p>
<blockquote>[* A column of granite now adorns the principal street of Cooktown
and bears the inscription: "In Memoriam Captain Cook who landed here June 17,
1770.--<i>Post cineres gloria venit.</i>"</blockquote>
<p>The "Endeavour," however, still made water and three people went down to
examine her. It was found that the main plank was chafed and that she had lost
three streaks of sheathing, but the master "was positive that she had received
no material damage," and the carpenter was of the same opinion, so that Cook
resolved to spend no more time in trying to repair her where she lay.</p>
<p>She was refloated at high water and moored alongside the beach where her
stores were deposited. In the morning these were got in readiness to be taken
on board, and eight tons of water were also obtained from springs not far
off.</p>
<p>In the meantime further delays kept Cook longer here. Banks went over to the
opposite shores of the harbour on several occasions. As he was crossing on the
4th shoals of garfish leapt out of the water, and some falling into his small
boat were caught. He crossed the river again next day and saw "innumerable
fruits" on a sandy beach apparently washed there by the waves. Most curious
coco-nuts were among them, all incrusted--many of them covered with
barnacles--"a sure sign that they have come far by sea, probably" (Banks adds)
"from Terra del Espiritu Santo" (the New Hebrides).</p>
<p>On the 6th what may be called the first inland expedition on the east coast
set out from the camp. Lieutenant Gore, Mr. Banks, and three men went in a
small boat to survey the country higher up the river intending to be away for
some days. After having passed through "groves of mangroves" they came to
country similar to that they had left behind, and as they proceeded up the
stream, which gradually contracted, only a few mangroves were to be seen and
the banks were steep, being covered with trees of a beautiful verdure called in
the West Indies <i>mohoe</i> or bark tree (<i>Hibiscus tiliaceus</i>). Farther
in the land was low and thickly covered with long grass. In the course of the
day Tupia saw an animal like a wolf, which, of course, was a dingo; and three
kangaroos and a bat as large as a partridge were also seen, but none was
caught.</p>
<p>The party camped at a spot close to the river bank and made their fire. Here
mosquitoes spoilt their enjoyment, and, as Banks says, spared no pains to
molest them as much as was in their power. "They followed us," he writes, "into
the very smoke, nay! almost into the fire, which, hot as the climate was, we
could better bear the heat of than their intolerable stings." And adds further:
"between the hardness of our bed, the heat of the fire, and the stings of these
indefatigable insects, the night was not spent so agreeably but day was
earnestly wished for by all of us. At last it came, and with its first dawn we
set out in search of game."</p>
<p>On this day four of the "animals of the country" were sighted; two were
chased by Banks's greyhound, though the kangaroos got away owing to the length
and thickness of the grass, which stopped the greyhound running, while they
bounded over the top of it. Banks then saw that instead of going on all fours
they went only on their hind legs as the smaller jerboa does.</p>
<p>The men saw a tree burning, but on reaching the spot no natives could be
seen. An old tree of touchwood had evidently been recently fired by them. Their
huts were found, and near them were lying twigs of trees, broken but not yet
withered, with which, possibly, children had been playing. Footsteps fresh on
the sands below high water proved that natives had gone that way. Their oven
showed that food had lately been cooked in it, while some shells of a kind of
clam and the roots of a wild yam, which had been baked, were lying close
by.</p>
<p>At the close of the day the visitors stopped at a sandbank where under the
shade of a bush they hoped to be free from their tormentors of the previous
night. They made their beds of plantain leaves, spreading them on the sand, and
they proved as soft as a mattress, and with cloaks for bed-clothes and grass
for a pillow the men had a good night's rest, possibly due to the fact that the
mosquitoes did not trouble them. On the 8th, at daylight, they returned to the
ship. On their passage down the river several flocks of whistling duck flew
past, some of which were shot, and once an alligator about seven feet long was
seen crawling out from under the mangroves and making its way down into the
water.</p>
<p>On the 10th of July four black fellows appeared on the north side of the
river opposite the "Endeavour." They had a canoe (with an outrigger) in which
two of them embarked, and, coming to within the distance of long musket shot,
stopped and began talking loudly. The British called to them and beckoned them
to come closer. They soon did so, and drew in until they were quite alongside
the ship, though they often held up their spears as if to show that they were
on guard. Cloth, nails, and other articles were given them, which they took
without showing the least sign of satisfaction. At last by accident a small
fish was thrown into the canoe, when they expressed the utmost joy and
instantly made signs that they would fetch their two comrades, which they soon
did, and all four landed at the camp, each man carrying two spears and a
throwing-stick with him. Tupia, who was on shore, went towards them where they
stood in a row as if about to throw their spears, and he made signs that they
should come forward without their arms. They then laid them down, and, sitting
on the ground beside him, received various presents of beads and cloth given
them. They soon became friendly and only grew alarmed when anyone attempted to
go between them and their arms. "At dinner we made signs to them to come and
eat with us," says Banks, "but they refused. We left them, and going into their
canoe they paddled back to where they had come from."</p>
<p>Again on the 11th they visited the British camp and Banks tells us that in
addition to two of the visitors of the previous day there now came two new
natives, "whom our old acquaintances introduced by their names, one of which
was Yaparico." Although not noticed before, it was now seen that the four
natives had the septurm of the nose pierced, having a large hole through it,
into which one of them had stuck the bone of a bird as thick as a man's finger
and about four or six inches long. "An ornament no doubt, though to us it
appeared rather an uncouth one," remarks Banks. The black fellows presented
their white friends with a fish, but did not stay long, as on perceiving that
some of the officers were examining their boat "they went directly to it and
pushing it off went away without saying a word."</p>
<p>On the 12th they came again. On this occasion Tupia received them in his
tent, which pleased the early Queenslanders so much that three of them stayed
with him while the fourth went with the canoe to fetch two others, and on their
return the new-comers were introduced as before to the English by name, "which
they always made a point of doing," says Banks. Although they remained there
the best part of the morning not once during that time would they venture
farther than twenty yards from their canoe.</p>
<p>When they had paid their first visit they had allowed the sailors to
decorate them with medals, which were tied by a ribbon round their necks. These
ribbons were now covered with smoke, and, remembering the night of torment he
had lately himself endured, Banks remarks, "I suppose they lay much in the
smoke to keep off the mosquitoes."</p>
<p>Cook tells a similar story of his meeting with these natives on the 10th, so
that this really was the first visit of the Queensland blacks to the ship's
people. He noticed their small wooden canoe with outriggers at a sandy point on
the north side of the harbour, where they were employed in striking fish. Some
on board wished to go over to them. "But," says Cook, "this I would not suffer,
and let them alone without seeming to take any notice of them." In describing
them he says: "One of these men was above middle age, the other three were
young: none were above 5&frac12; feet high and all had small limbs. They were
naked, their skins the colour of wood soot: their hair black, lank and cropt
short, and neither woolly nor frizzled, nor did they want any of their fore
teeth," as did those seen by Dampier. He continues: "Some part of their bodies
had been painted with red and, one of them had his upper lip and breast painted
with streaks of white called 'carbanda.' Their features were far from being
disagreeable, their voices were soft and tunable, and they could easily repeat
any word after us. But no one, not even Tupia, could understand a word they
said."</p>
<p>Mr. Gore, who seems to have been energetic both on land and sea, on the 14th
killed a kangaroo. "To compare it to any European animal," says Banks, "would
be impossible, as it has not the least resemblance to any I have seen."</p>
<p>The kangaroo was cooked and eaten and its flesh was, as one might suppose,
excellent. In his journal Cook writes: "It was a small one, weighing 28 lbs.,"
after being cleaned; and he continues: "It was hare lipt and the head and ears
were most like a hare's of any animal I know...The forelegs were 8 inches long
and the hind 22 inches"; and he thought the forelegs "only designed for
scratching in the ground. The skin is covered with a short, hairy fur of a dark
mouse or grey colour." A much greater delicacy for the men were the turtle
there, which were frequently caught, and were in great numbers. Indeed, on the
9th Mr. Molineux caught three on a reef without the harbour which was called
Turtle Bank;[*] they weighed 791 lbs., and on that day, says Cook, all hands
feasted on turtle for the first time. These were mostly green turtle, and, when
killed, were found to be full of turtle grass, which Banks identified as a kind
of conferva.</p>
<blockquote>[* Turtle Reef.]</blockquote>
<p>Although her departure was delayed, the ship was ready to leave on the 16th.
Up to the time of sailing the botanists remained busily engaged in examining
specimens and in completing their collections so as to take away as many
different species as possible. Tupia encountered blacks on the north side of
Endeavour River on the 17th, who, Banks relates, "gave him a kind of longish
root about as thick as a man's finger and of very good taste." Probably this
was dingowa, or fern root, much eaten by the natives.</p>
<p>Banks also records that at this time the natives soon had become quite
familiar and lost all fear of white men. On the 18th one gave an exhibition of
his powers in throwing the spear. The weapon shot through the air so steadily
and swiftly that Banks was amazed at its flight, "never being above four feet
from the ground and stuck deep in at a distance of 50 paces. After this display
the blacks went on board, and, he says, "soon became our very good
friends."</p>
<p>Leaving them, Cook and Banks crossed the river and walked northwards to a
high hill about six miles from the ship. On ascending it they viewed the sea
coast, and Cook writes: "It afforded us a melancholy prospect of the
difficulties we are to encounter." From here too in every direction the sea
looked covered with shoals.</p>
<p>On the morning of the 19th ten or eleven natives came to the "Endeavour"
from the opposite side of the river, six or seven of their companions including
some women remaining behind. All these blacks were naked. Those who came on
board made known by signs that they wanted some of the turtle that were on the
deck, several having been placed there for the voyage. On their requests being
refused one angry and disappointed man was seen, energetically aided by his
companions, trying to haul two turtle to the gangway in order to put them over
the side of the vessel. When they were prevented doing this the black fellows
revenged themselves by throwing overboard everything within their reach. Bread
was offered to them but they rejected it scornfully, and soon afterwards took
their departure.</p>
<p>The commander, with Mr. Banks and five or six others, followed them on
shore. Immediately the blacks landed, one of the party ran to a patch of dry
grass, tore up a handful, and lighted it at a fire that the seamen had made
there. He then started to set fire to the grass in several places, making a
circle round the camp, with the result that in a few minutes the whole of the
surroundings were in a blaze.</p>
<p>Banks, who was setting out to gather plants, suddenly saw one of the tents
erected for his use in imminent danger of being burnt, so leaping into a boat
he promptly brought some sailors from the ship who hauled it down in time to
save it from the flames. The forge was destroyed, however, and one of the
litter of pigs was scorched to death. Not content with starting fires at this
point the blacks ran to another place where the men had been washing linen, and
where the linen with the fishing net lay on the ground to dry. Determined to
save the seine if he could, Cook followed the natives, but in spite of his
efforts to prevent them they again set fire to the grass and it was soon
blazing furiously. Finding persuasion useless, Cook at last fired a musket at
one of the ringleaders who was starting new fires forty yards away; on the shot
striking him he ran to his companions and they all disappeared into the woods.
The second fire was extinguished, but the first one rapidly increased and
burned fiercely. At this time the natives were not far away, for their voices
could be heard in the distance, so Cook and Banks with some others went to look
for them and soon met several. Seeing that they carried spears the white party
picked up a few that they had left behind and closely pursued the black men.
But the Australian native is fleet of foot and after Cook had chased them for
about half a mile he was compelled to halt at the foot of a tree, whence he
called to the natives to stop, and presently they did so, and he writes: "After
some little unintelligible conversation had passed, they laid down their darts
and came to us in a very friendly manner." The borrowed spears were then
returned to their rightful owners which, he says, reconciled everything."</p>
<p>There were four strange black fellows now with the natives, who had never
been seen before, and each one was introduced by name to the British with the
usual ceremony. The man who had been hit had gone away, but it was evident that
he had not been badly hurt. When eventually Cook's party made their way back to
the ship the natives accompanied them until they came abreast the "Endeavour."
Here they remained in conversation for a short time. They then went away and
set the bush on fire at about two miles distant.</p>
<p>On Friday, 20th, the ship was brought to a new berth and let swing with the
tide. The master, who had been sent in the pinnace to inspect the coast higher
up, returned during the night, and stated that he could find no safe passage to
the northward. However, being ready for sea, Cook went next day and buoyed the
bar, but the wind continuing unfavourable he was forced to remain longer at his
anchorage.</p>
<p>While thus delayed, his people saw more of the natives. On the 23rd some
sailors, sent into the country for a supply of green food, lost one of their
party in the bush. This man suddenly came upon four blackfellows seated round a
fire. They were engaged in broiling a bird, and he also perceived part of a
kangaroo hanging on a tree near. Being unarmed he had the presence of mind not
to run away from the blacks, but went and sat down among them. At first being
afraid of their numbers he offered them his knife in order to conciliate them.
The natives took it, handed it round from one to the other to examine, then
returned it again to him. When they had felt his hands, his body, and the
texture of his clothes they allowed him to depart peaceably, and on seeing that
he did not know his way directed him back to the "Endeavour."</p>
<p>On Friday, August 3rd, Cook unmoored and began to warp out of the harbour.
Soon a breeze arising he was compelled to remain within the bar for the night.
At seven o'clock next morning he put to sea.</p>
<h4>COOKTOWN TO POSSESSION ISLAND</h4>
<p>On leaving Endeavour River, Cook steered east-by-north and sent the pinnace
before him to lead the way. He had ordered the yawl to pick up a net that had
been left on the Turtle Bank, but the wind freshening the "Endeavour" got out
of the harbour before her. Wishing to view the shoals at low water from the
masthead before venturing among them, Cook came to an anchorage shortly after
noon. The northernmost point of the mainland then in sight, to which he gave
the name of Cape Bedford, bore north-west distant three and a half leagues,
while the Turtle Reef lay but a mile to the eastward. He informs us on the 4th
that he had not then decided whether to beat back to the southward "round all
the shoals" or to seek a passage to the eastward or northward, "all of which
appeared to be equally difficult and dangerous." Nor did he know the extent of
the Barrier Reef, which rose to the eastward like a wall of coral rock between
him and the South Pacific. On the 5th the boats were ordered to Turtle Reef for
turtle and shell-fish, and in their absence Cook surveyed the shoals. Beyond
the nearest shoal he saw many more stretching into distance, although to the
north-east the sea looked fairly clear and he finally resolved to go in that
direction. The fishing boats returned with a turtle, a sting-ray, and a
quantity of clams, which afforded each man one and a half pounds of fish, and
during the night the sailors caught some sharks.</p>
<p>Fresh gales blew next morning and prevented the vessel sailing until 2 p.m.
on August 6th, when the weather had moderated. Leaving Turtle Reef, Cook stood
to the north-east, having shoals ahead and on both bows, and at 4.30 the
pinnace made the signal for shoal water. After tacking Cook soon anchored as
night was approaching and he hoped to proceed at daylight. But a strong gale
from the south-east blew next day and the ship was compelled to strike her
yards.</p>
<p>Around her on all sides there were shoals. With his officers, on the 7th,
Cook looked in vain from the masthead for a passage between them. Breakers were
visible everywhere: "All the way from the south round by east to N.W. extending
out to sea as far as we could see," and he adds: "It did not appear one
continued shoal but several detached from each other."</p>
<p>The surf broke highest on the easternmost side, and after finally reviewing
the situation he observes: "I saw that we were surrounded on every side with
danger insomuch that I was quite at a loss which way to steer...for to beat
back to the S.E. the way we came as the Master would have me do would be an
endless piece of work." At last he determined to seek a passage along the
(Queensland) coast and to follow it northward. Gales continued to blow, and not
until the 10th at 7 a.m. was the "Endeavour" able to weigh her anchor. She then
stood in towards the mainland and at nine drew abreast three small islands
covered with mangroves (now called the Three Isles), which lie eight miles from
Cape Bedford. Cook directed his course between the islands and the mainland and
next saw a point in the coast bearing north-north-west at a distance of two
leagues. To the north-east of it appeared three more islands,[*] which were
high, having small ones near. The ship continued her course between the islands
and the shore and at noon was four leagues from the former and two from the
latter. Cook thought that he was now clear of danger and that the open sea was
before him, but he was soon to find that he had been deceived, so he named this
headland Cape Flattery, writing of it: "It is a high promontory making in two
hills next the sea and a third behind with low sandy land on each side."</p>
<blockquote>[* The Direction Islands.]</blockquote>
<p>On the 11th a petty officer at the masthead cried out that there was "land
ahead extending round to the islands without," and that there was a reef
between the ship and these islands. On hearing this Cook himself went to the
masthead and saw the reef plainly, but he thought that the officer was mistaken
in thinking the land was mainland, for to Cook it appeared to be islands.
However, as others on board were also of the petty officer's opinion, he
signalled for the boat to come on board, and stood in for the Australian coast
and anchored under a point of the mainland about a mile from the shore. He then
landed and went to the highest point he could find where he obtained a view of
the coast. This, he could see, trended away north-west-by-west for eight or ten
leagues. He also saw nine or ten small low islands...and some large shoals
between the mainland and the three high islands, without which again were
islands which the petty officer had mistaken for the mainland.</p>
<p>Cook called the point of the mainland from which he obtained this good view
Point Lookout. He saw there the footsteps of natives in the sand and the smoke
of their fires up in the country. The sea coast north of Cape Bedford was low
and chequered with white sand and green bushes for ten or twelve miles inland,
and there was high land beyond. To the north of Point Lookout the shores
appeared shoal and flat, which, he adds, "is no good sign of meeting with a
channel as we have hitherto done." He returned on board the "Endeavour" at
evening and decided then to visit one of the high islands next morning. He
therefore set out in the pinnace in company with Mr. Banks for the northernmost
and largest of the three,[*] and Mr. Molineux at the same time, by his orders,
took the yawl to leeward to sound between some low islands and the main.</p>
<blockquote>[* Lizard Island.]</blockquote>
<p>When he had arrived at the island and climbed to the top of the highest
hill[*] Cook discovered to his dismay that a reef extended for two or three
leagues outside the island and ran north-west and south-east out of sight. This
was in fact a portion of the main Barrier Reef. The waves rose high upon it,
yet breaks were seen and the water within it looked deep. Cook stayed on the
hill until sunset trying to get a better view of the shoals, but the weather
continued hazy, and he determined to spend the night there, hoping that the
morning would be clear. In this, however, he was disappointed, for next day the
atmosphere was even more hazy. At three in the morning he sent one of the mates
away in the pinnace to sound the depth of water between the island they were on
and the reef, and also to examine one of the breaks in the reef.</p>
<blockquote>[* The summit which is a bare, domed-shaped hill, is 1,179 feet in
height and from its height and conspicuous appearance forms a good mark from
seaward and from the channels inside--"Admiralty Sailing
Directions."]</blockquote>
<p>Cook named this island, which was about eight miles in circuit, Lizard
Island, and he says that he gave it this name because the only land animals
that he saw were lizards. It was high, rocky, and barren, excepting on the
north side, where there were sandy bays and low lands covered with thin long
grass.</p>
<p>The remains of some old native huts and heaps of old fish shells showed that
the Australian natives came over from the mainland. The islands to the
southward were both smaller and there seemed a clear passage between them and
Cape Flattery. In the afternoon of the 13th Cook left Lizard Island and went
back to his ship, touching at a low sandy island on his way, which he named
Eagle Island.</p>
<p>Of his visit to Lizard Island Banks writes: "We ascended the hill and from
the top saw plainly the grand reef still extending itself parallel with the
shore...Through it were several channels exactly similar to those we had seen
in the islands. Through one of these we determined to go. To ascertain,
however, the practicability of it we resolved to stay upon the island all
night...We slept under the shade of a bush that grew upon the beach very
comfortably."</p>
<p>On the following day he continues: "Great part of yesterday and all this
morning till the boat returned I employed in searching the island. On it I
found some few plants which I had not before seen...There was one small tract
of woodland which abounded very much with large lizards, some of which I took.
Distant as this isle was from the main, the Indians had been here in their poor
embarkations....We saw seven or eight frames of their huts...All the houses
were built upon the tops of eminences exposed entirely to the S.E., contrary to
those of the main, which are commonly placed under some bushes or hillside to
break the wind. The officer who went in the boat returned with an account that
the sea broke vastly high upon the reef and the swell was so great in the
opening that he could not go into it to sound. [But he found that the depth of
water within the reef varied from 15 to 28 fathoms.] On our return we went
ashore on a low island, where we shot many birds: on it was the nest of an
eagle, the young ones of which we killed, and another, I knew not of what bird,
built on the ground of an enormous magnitude; it was in circumference 26 feet
and in height 2 feet 8 inches built of sticks...[*] The Indians had been here
likewise." This was the island which had been named Eagle Island by Cook.</p>
<blockquote>[* <i>Tallegalla lathami</i>, Gould, i.e. North Queensland scrub
hen. It really was a small nest of the kind. A common height is 5 or 6 feet and
20 yards round the base.]</blockquote>
<p>On his return on board the commander found that the master had made his
examination of the low islands.[*] He had spent the night on one and had found
there piles of turtle shells and some of the fins with meat on them left on the
trees were so fresh that he and the boat's crew ate of them, and it was evident
that the natives had lately feasted there. He also saw two spots lately dug up
about seven feet long and shaped like a grave, which he thought were native
tombs. On receiving an unfavourable report from the master with regard to the
soundings inside the low islands, and comparing it with his own observations,
Cook clearly perceived that it would be courting danger to try to keep any
longer near the mainland, and after consulting with his officers he resolved to
quit its shores.</p>
<blockquote>[* Turtle Group.]</blockquote>
<p>Accordingly, at daylight on the 13th he weighed anchor and stood to the
north-east. By 2 p.m. he had arrived at one of the openings in the main reef,
the outermost reef seen from Lizard Island. The master went in the pinnace to
examine the channel and soon made the signal to the ship to follow and she
passed safely through it. This channel through the Barrier Reef is known as
Cook's Passage.</p>
<p>In giving further information concerning his track Cook says he called the
three high islands the Islands of Direction, as "by their means a safe passage
may be found even by strangers in within the main reef and quite into the
main." Lizard Island, he adds, "affords snug anchorage under the N.W. side of
it, fresh water, and wood for fuel.'' Not only on this island, but also on
Eagle Island and other places, were found bamboos, coco-nuts, and seeds of
various plants-which were not the produce of the country.</p>
<p>After the "Endeavour" had passed through Cook's Passage she had no ground
with one hundred fathoms of line, and a large sea came rolling in from the
south-east. The sight pleased Cook greatly, "after having been entangled among
islands or shoals more or less ever since May 26th, in which time we have
sailed above 360 leagues by the lead without ever having a leadsman out of the
chains when the ship was under sail, a circumstance that perhaps never happened
to any ship before."</p>
<p>But the big swell of the South Pacific soon made it apparent to him that his
ship had received damage on Endeavour Reef of which he had not been aware, or
had not noticed, while sailing in the smooth waters within the Barrier, for
"she now made as much water as one pump kept constantly at work would free." By
noon on the 14th the vessel was out of sight of land, and on the following day
orders were given at six in the evening to shorten sail and bring her to for
the night. Next morning Cook made sail and steered west in order to make the
land, "being fearful of overshooting the passage, supposing there to be one
between this land and New Guinea," which shows that if he had heard of the
discoveries of Torres he had forgotten them. As a matter of fact, neither Cook
nor Bligh nor any Australian discoverer seems to have reaped any benefit from
the experiences of that navigator.</p>
<p>On Thursday, 16th, a little after noon, land was seen from the masthead
bearing west-south-west. It was high land, and at 2 p.m. more was seen to the
north-west, "making in hills like islands," which was thought to be part of the
coast (of Australia). An hour afterwards a reef, yet another part of the Great
Barrier Reef, was discovered lying between the ship and the mainland. It
extended to the southward and was thought to terminate to the northward abreast
the ship; but the supposed termination was soon proved to be merely an opening,
for the reef itself was shortly afterwards observed extending farther to the
northward, out of sight. "The ship's sails had scarcely been trimmed before the
wind came to E. by N., which," writes Cook, "made our weathering the reef very
doubtful, the northern point of which still bore N. by W. distant about two
leagues."</p>
<p>The "Endeavour," however, continued to steer northward in hopes of being
able to clear the reef, care being taken that she should not run too far on one
course. To prevent this at midnight she tacked and stood to the
south-south-east. It then fell calm, and on sounding no bottom could be
obtained with 140 fathoms of line. A little after four o'clock a roar of surf
was clearly heard, foretelling that danger was near, and at daylight breakers,
white with foam, could be distinguished not a mile away, towards which, to the
horror of those on board, the heavy sea was fast hurrying the ship. There was
not a breath of wind and no possibility of being able to anchor, and Cook says:
"In this distressed situation we had nothing but Providence and the. small
assistance the boats could give us to trust to." The pinnace was then under
repair; but the yawl was put in the water and the long-boat hoisted out, both
being sent ahead to tow, and with the result that at last they got the ship's
head round to the northward.</p>
<p>By this time it was six o'clock and they were not more than eighty or one
hundred yards from the breakers. A big sea now lashed the ship's side and
curved when next it rose in such a lofty breaker that "only a dismal valley,
the breadth of one wave, lay between the 'Endeavour' and destruction."</p>
<p>Meanwhile the pinnace had been hastily repaired, and it too was hoisted out
and sent ahead to tow, although it seemed then as if nothing could save the
ship. Yet all on board remained quite calm and every man did his utmost to
avert disaster, and Cook writes: "All the dangers we had escaped were little in
comparison of being thrown on this reef where the ship must be dashed to pieces
in a moment. A reef," he adds, "such as...is scarcely known in Europe. It is a
wall of coral rock rising almost perpendicular out of the unfathomable ocean,
always overflown at high water and dry in places at low water."</p>
<p>And just when, to those on board, all seemed lost, "a small air of wind"
sprang up--so small that at any other time it would have scarcely been noticed,
and, with its aid and the help of the boats, the "Endeavour" was seen to move
slantingly away from the reef. In less than ten minutes the hopes of the men
were again dashed down, as a calm set in, while they were still not above 200
yards from the breakers. Yet once more the little breeze returned, and at this
time a small opening was perceived in the reef about a quarter of a mile away.
One of the mates was sent to examine it and he found that its breadth was not
more than the length of the ship, but that within there was smooth water.
Through this opening Cook decided to take the "Endeavour," though it was
doubtful whether he would be able to reach it at all. He, however, brought her
opposite to it, and to his surprise saw the ebb rushing out through the gap as
though it were a mill stream, and this carried the ship back a quarter of a
mile away from the breakers. By noon she was one and a half or two miles from
them; yet even then she could not have hoped to get clear if a breeze had
sprung up. As Cook says: "We were embayed by the reef, the ship in spite of our
exertions, driving before the sea into the bight"; and he adds: "The only hopes
we had was another opening we saw about a mile to the westward of us which I
sent Lieutenant Hicks to examine."</p>
<p>While Mr. Hicks was inspecting this second opening the ship struggled with
the tide, sometimes in her efforts gaining a little and at others losing way.
At two o'clock on the afternoon of the 17th the first lieutenant returned with
a favourable report of the opening and it was resolved to try to get through
it, as this seemed to be the only means by which the ship could be saved.</p>
<p>A light breeze sprang up from the east-north-east, and with the help of all
the boats and a flood tide the "Endeavour" entered the opening. The tide, whose
waters ran like a mill-race, hurried her through with a force that kept her
straight and prevented her driving to either side of the narrow channel. Once
through, she came to an anchorage safely within the reef about eight or nine
leagues from the mainland. Cook named the channel Providential Channel, because
it had so proved for the ship in the hour of her danger; and in recalling the
satisfaction that he had felt but a few days before when he had found himself
without the reef, he says: "That joy was nothing compared to what I now felt at
being safe at anchor within it."</p>
<p>For the rest of the day the "Endeavour" remained at this anchorage in full
view of the mainland coast. Giving his impressions of the land, Cook writes:
"On the mainland within us was a pretty high promontory which I called Cape
Weymouth and on the N.W. side of this cape is a bay which I called Weymouth
Bay," this being in honour of Lord Weymouth. On going to the masthead he saw
that a great part of the reef was dry and that there was another opening in it
to the south-east (possibly that now known as the Hibernia's Entrance).</p>
<p>Next morning the "Endeavour" got under way and stood to the north-west; it
was now deemed advisable to keep within the Barrier Reef, of whose extent and
vast length Cook at this time had gained important knowledge. Whilst pursuing
his course within the Barrier he perceived that the main or outer reef still
extended to the north-east, and he now met with a shoal and with the islands
which lie between the reef and the Australian mainland. At half-past six next
evening he anchored three miles from the northernmost of some small islands
bearing west &frac12; south, which he named Forbes's Islands. The coast here
formed a moderately high point called by Cook Bolt Head. Beyond it were low and
sandy beaches. At 6 a.m., when the ship was got under sail and stood in for an
island lying off the coast, her course was interrupted by shoals, but at length
she found a channel to it. The mainland here within the islands formed a point
which was named Cape Grenville, between which and Bolt Head was a bay which was
called Temple Bay. Nine leagues east &frac12; north from Cape Grenville were
some high islands, and these were named Sir Charles Hardy's Isles, while those
off the cape were called the Cockburn Isles.</p>
<p>Cook now steered a course along the Queensland shores which was afterwards,
for a time at least, followed by Bligh, who served under him as master of the
"Resolution." It was nineteen years later that Bligh entered through an opening
now called Bligh Boat Entrance in the Great Barrier Reef in the "Bounty's" boat
and ran along the shores that Cook's ship had coasted, steering a course among
the same islands. Writing on August 20th Cook says: "At 4, we discovered some
low islands and rocks bearing W.N.W. which we stood directly in for. At half
past six we anchored on the north-east side of the northernmost in 16 fms.
distant one mile from the island. This island lay N.W. 4 leagues from Cape
Grenville. On the isles we saw a good many birds which occasioned my calling
them Bird Isles."Bligh also came to the Bird Islands with his half-starved men,
and he tells us that he anchored on "the north-westernmost of four small keys,"
naming it Lagoon Island. "Before and at sunset," continues Cook, "we could see
the mainland which appeared very low and sandy...and some shoals, keys and low
sandy isles away to the N.E. At 6 a.m. we got again under sail and stood N.N.W.
for some low islands." The shoals and keys are now called the Boydong Cays.
"After weathering a shoal on our larboard bow, having at the same time others
to east of us...and having weathered the shoal to leeward and seeing some
shoals spit off from them and rocks on the starboard bow," Cook says that,
being afraid to go to windward of the islands, he brought to. He then made
signal to the pinnace to rejoin the ship, and sent her to leeward "to keep
along the edge of the shoal off the south side of the southernmost island." As
soon as the pinnace had got a proper distance he wore and stood after her.</p>
<p>Writing of this island, which is only a small spot of land with some trees
upon it. Cook says: "We saw many huts and habitations of the natives which we
supposed come over from the main to these islands (from which they are distant
about 5 leagues) to catch turtle at the time when these animals come ashore to
lay eggs." Having taken the yawl in tow, the "Endeavour" stood after the
pinnace to "two other low islands having two shoals, and one between us and the
main."[*]</p>
<blockquote>[* Possibly these were Halfway Islets and East Islet.]</blockquote>
<p>"At noon," writes Cook, "we were about 4 leagues from the mainland extending
N. as far as N.W. by N. all low, flat, and sandy "--the distance covered in the
twenty-four hours being forty miles. At 1 p.m. on the 21st, finding that he
could not go to windward of the two islands without getting too far from the
main, Cook bore up and ran to leeward, where he found a fair open passage. He
was now steering parallel with the mainland, "having a small island between us
and it and some low sandy isles, and shoals without us."[*] At four o'clock the
"Endeavour" had lost sight of the islands, nor were any more seen before
sunset, the farthest part of the mainland then in sight bearing
north-north-west &frac12; west. At this time Cook was almost abreast of Sharp
Peak at the southern entrance of Escape River. **2] Soon afterwards he anchored
for the night in thirteen fathoms soft ground about five leagues off shore.</p>
<blockquote>[* On this day Cook passed between Cairncross and Sandy Islets. See
P. G, King's comments on Cook's Log.]</blockquote>
<blockquote>[** So named by King in 1819.]</blockquote>
<p>At daylight once more, with the yawl ahead sounding, the "Endeavour" got
under way. She steered north-north-west, and as no danger was visible the yawl
was taken in tow and the ship made all sail until eight o'clock, when Cook
discovered shoals ahead on the larboard bow. He then came to the conclusion
from what he saw that the northernmost land, which he had considered was a part
of the continent, was an island or islands between which and the main there
appeared to be a good passage. The islands, one of which is remarkable for its
flat top, are known to us as Mount Adolphus Islands. Cook now had the
satisfaction of finding a good channel between the Mount Adolphus Islands and
the coast; he kept the long-boat rigged continually between the ship and the
mainland, as he says, "although there appeared nothing in the passage, there
was a strong flood." It may be noted as justifying Cook's precautions that the
Quetta Rock is in this channel. By noon he had got through and the nearest land
to the southward lay only three or four miles distant. Soon afterwards he
discovered that this was the northernmost point of the continent whose eastern
coast he had so thoroughly explored, and he writes in his journal: "The point
of the main...which is the northern promontory of this country, I have named
York Cape in honour of his late Royal Highness the Duke of York. It lies in the
long. of 218&deg;24' W., the north point in the lat. Of 10&deg;37' S., and the
east point in W10&deg;41'S."</p>
<p>At this time he caught sight of islands lying a good distance off
north-by-west to west-north-west, and behind them yet another chain of islands.
The land below the east point of York Cape looked low and flat and seemed
barren as far inland as the eye could reach. The land on the northern part of
York Cape was rather more hilly and the valleys appeared well clothed with
wood.[*] To the southward of the cape the shore was seen to form a large open
bay which Cook named Newcastle Bay. (It was "the large and fair inlet" in
11&deg; S. of Bligh.) From Adolphus Channel Cook steered three or four miles to
westward round York Cape and discovered some islands which were "detached by
several channels from the mainland. He recalled the boats and gave instructions
to them to lead through the channel next the main, and soon afterwards the
"Endeavour" made sail and followed them. Rocks and shoals were found in this
channel, so Cook made the signal to the boats to lead through "the next channel
to the northward between the islands which they accordingly did; we following
with the ship and had not less than 5 fms. and this in the narrowest
part...which was about 1 mile and a half broad from island to island."</p>
<blockquote>[* Cape York, the extreme north point of Eastern Australia, is
covered with dense scrub along a series of hills called the Carnegic Range; the
hill next the cape being Mount Bremer, 372 feet. The Cape itself is a long, low
shelf of rock tapering to the edge of the water.]</blockquote>
<p>At four o'clock the "Endeavour" anchored. The mainland (Cape York Peninsula)
then extended south-west (S. 48&deg; W.), while the southernmost point of the
island on the north-west side of the passage bore S. 76&deg; W. "Between these
two points,"writes Cook, "we could see no land, so we were in great hopes we
had at last found out a passage into the Indian seas, but in order to be better
informed I landed with a party of men, accompanied by Mr. Banks and Dr.
Solander, upon the island which lies at the S.E. point of the passage. Before
and after we anchored we saw a number of people upon this island armed in the
same manner as all others we have seen except one man who had a bow and bundle
of arrows, the first we have seen on this coast." The man who was differently
armed from his companions probably came from one of the islands in Torres
Strait, where the inhabitants use bows and arrows.</p>
<p>Cook was to learn later that he was not the first to discover "a passage
into Indian seas," for in 1606 Torres had "found a great land in 11&deg;30' S.
and sailing on met with a great reef with a channel, many islands and a
mainland," this, of course, being Torres Strait and the Barrier Reef. In the
preface to Cook's second voyage, however, we find that Cook gives due credit to
Torres for the discovery of the strait.</p>
<p>The natives seen by Cook's party at this island-which was afterwards called
Possession Island-were not ferocious, although the commander writes: "from the
appearance of the people we expected they would have opposed our landing, but
as we approached the shore they all made off and left us in peaceable
possession of as much of the island as served our purpose."</p>
<p>After landing, according to his usual custom, Cook went up on the highest
hill. Of it he says: "It was of no great height, yet no less than twice or
thrice the height of the ship's masthead, but I could see no land between S.W.
and W.S.W. so that I did not doubt there was a passage." This passage was, as
we know, Endeavour Strait, through which Cook passed safely into Torres Strait
and thence made his way to Timor.</p>
<p>In his journal he continues: "Having satisfied myself of this great
probability of a passage through which I intend going with my ship, and
therefore may land no more upon this Eastern coast of New Holland; and on the
West [coast] I can make no new discovery, the honour of which belongs to the
Dutch navigators. But the Eastern from the latitude of 38&deg; S. down to this
place I am confident was never seen or visited by any European before us. And
notwithstanding I had in the name of His Majesty taken possession of several
places upon this coastInow once more hoisted English colours and in the name of
His Majesty King George the III took possession of the whole eastern coast from
the above latitude down to this place by the name of New South Wales,[*]
together with all the bays, harbours, rivers, and islands situated upon the
said coast, after which we fired 3 volleys of small arms which were answered by
the like number from the ship."</p>
<blockquote>[* According to the Admiralty copy of Cook's journal.]</blockquote>
<p>Possession Island (Coolbee), on which Cook planted the flag of Britain, thus
taking possession of the whole of the east coast of Australia from 38&deg; S.,
is two and three-quarter miles in length by one and a quarter wide. From the
top of the cairn of stones upon which Cook planted his flagstaff there is a
magnificent view of numberless islands in Torres Strait.</p>
<p>Taking leave of Cook and the "Endeavour"[*] at the entrance of Endeavour
Strait and turning again to the scene of his labours on the east coast we
realize the far-reaching effects of his voyage. In these days it is easy to
look back and survey the bountiful harvest that has sprung up where he first
sowed the seed and to mark how capably his countrymen continued his work of
discovery in that southern field of exploration. It is a more difficult task to
grasp how the settlement of Australia, tardily undertaken by the British
authorities, came successfully to be carried out. Where Cook saw empty bays and
harbours fringed with only trees and scrub now rise cities and towns of
recognized and growing importance, overlooking waters teeming with busy ships.
Arid coasts and barren bushland developed into a fertile soil. A
self-supporting colony grew up on the shores of Port Jackson, whence the
English colours were carried to lands and islands yet more distant, until at
last the whole of Australia became a valuable British possession.</p>
<blockquote>[* The "Endeavour" was sold by the Admiralty for &pound;645 in
1775, and again became a collier, having been originally built as one. Two
different accounts are given of her end. One says that she was sold to the
French and when England and France were at war, took refuge at Newport, U.S.A.,
where she eventually was broken up. The other account states that she never
left the Thames.]</blockquote>
<h4>AUSTRALIAN BOTANY--BANKS TO BROWN</h4>
<p>The publication of the results of the botany of Cook's first voyage was long
retarded, and illustrations of the Australian plants collected by Banks and
Solander in H.M.S. "Endeavour" in 1770 were not published until 1905. Then a
large work was printed by order of the trustees of the British Museum showing
the original collection, "with determinations in accordance with the
nomenclature at present adopted."</p>
<p>In this work are engravings of the collections of those early voyagers, who
seem to have gathered an extraordinary number of specimens during their stay on
the east coast--the Australian plants alone representing a total of 331. Among
them are many beautiful acacias, banksias, goodenias, correas, xanthorrhaeas,
and orchids, with which we are now familiar. The <i>Eucalyptus alba</i> and
<i>terminalis</i> are included, being the first of their species to be brought
home.</p>
<p>Following the landing of the British, the native shrubs, ferns, and palms
which grew around Sydney soon became known and were more sought after in
England than even those of the Cape. Writing at that period,
Labillardi&egrave;re, the French botanist, states that the old adage <i>semper
aliquid novi ex Africa</i> was forgotten in the more striking novelties brought
from Australia. These new plants greatly puzzled the botanists who first saw
them and imagined that they resembled known species from which they proved to
be entirely different. Among the earliest specimens to arrive home were
<i>Casuarina torulosa and C. stricta, Eucalyptus obliqua</i> and
<i>Leptospermum lanigerum</i>--the genus <i>Eucalyptus</i> being established by
L'Heritier, a Frenchman who had visited England in 1786-87 and studied the Kew
collections. He founded the genus on <i>Eucalyptus obliqua</i>, a species which
had been already named <i>Aromadendrum</i> by Dr. Anderson,[*] who was on board
H.M.S. Adventure " in Tasmania, and the tree was first brought home in that
ship in 1774. The earliest illustrations published of these plants were drawn
either from garden or dried specimens, but a little later Dr. White's book
appeared containing drawings of birds and animals from life and also of flowers
in their wild state.</p>
<blockquote>[* The first writer to call attention to Anderson's plants (apart
from Dryander's reference to his MSS.) was Robert Brown. Four genera named by
Anderson were <i>Aromadendrum, Collema, Euphocarpus, Ramsaia;</i> respectively
<i>Eucalyptus, Goodenia, Correa, and Bauera.--Banks.</i>]</blockquote>
<p>This work, as well as the new varieties sent home by Governor Phillip and
his successors, particularly those of Hunter, Paterson, and King, brought the
knowledge of Australian flora and also of the fauna into very great prominence.
Colonel Paterson was a well-known zoologist and botanist and while he was ever
seeking fresh plants to despatch to England, his wife, Elizabeth Paterson,
besides showing the keenest interest in his work, made collections of beautiful
shells gathered when residing in Norfolk Island, Tasmania, and Sydney. In one
of his letters (preserved at Kew) her husband wrote "she has made this her
hobby"; and Mrs. Macarthur, wife of Captain John Macarthur, also studied both
botany and astronomy in those early days.</p>
<p>Specimens of plants and papers of seeds were brought to England by the
botanists of the different expeditions which touched at more distant parts of
the continent. Among these collectors were David Nelson, botanist on board the
ill-fated "Bounty" which visited Tasmania in 1789; Labillardi&egrave;re, who
accompanied the French expedition under d'Entrecasteaux in 1791-93, twice
visiting Tasmania; and Archibald Menzies, surgeon of the "Discovery,"
Vancouver's ship, which anchored along with the "Chatham" in King George's
Sound in 1791. In 1795 Cavanilles published descriptions from dried specimens
communicated by Don Luis N&eacute;e and Tadeo Haeneke, botanists accompanying
the Spanish expedition under Malaspina, who touched at Sydney in 1793. The
first book dealing exclusively with the plants of Australia (here we again
quote Labillardi&egrave;re) was Smith's "Specimens of the Botany of New Holland
" published in 1793, the second being that of Labillardi&egrave;re himself
giving a description of the plants of Tasmania (then known as Van Diemen's
Land) and of Western Australia. Labillardi&egrave;re points out that his own
work contains descriptions of plants which had been already described by Nelson
in 1789.</p>
<p>Among Australian flowers the most notable was the waratah whose vivid
carmine colour made it distinguishable upon the most inaccessible mountains.
Smith says: "By common consent it is called by that name by both Europeans and
natives," and he adds: "It is a favourite with the latter on account of the
rich honeyed juice which they sip from its flowers."The illustration of the
waratah that appears in his book was made from a coloured drawing--transmitted
from Sydney--compared with the dried specimens of the flower which had been
sent home by Dr. Mite.</p>
<p>Following in the footsteps of Banks, Anderson, Nelson, and
Labillardi&egrave;re there voyaged to the southern continent a botanist the
results of whose work surpassed those of all who had preceded him there, both
in regard to the number of plants despatched home as in novelty of species.
This was Robert Brown, who accompanied Captain Matthew Flinders as botanist on
board H.M.S. "Investigator." Brown not only was with Flinders in his
exploration of the more distant coasts, but also strove to make himself
acquainted with the flora of every known part of New South Wales and Tasmania.
The full set of Brown's collection is in the Natural History Museum at South
Kensington; it is perhaps the most important of all Australian collections.
Indefatigable as he was, Brown left the continent before its great inland
territory had been discovered and while there yet remained a vast region still
awaiting the explorer and the botanist.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER III</h3>
<h4>THE COMING OF PHILLIP, FOUNDER OF BRITAIN'S FIRST AUSTRALIAN COLONY</h4>
<blockquote>"Its acquisition will compensate England for the loss of North
America."--<i>Francisco Nunez de San Clemente.</i> [Add. MSS. 19, 264, British
Museum, New Holland. Translation from Spanish.]</blockquote>
<p>The story of the founding of the first colony hardly comes within the limits
of our subject, for the explorer's theme is discovery; but some reference to
the work of the first Governors cannot well be omitted from this book, so we
will deal with it as briefly as its importance and its interest will
permit.</p>
<p>In January, 1788, Captain Arthur Phillip, hastening before the rest of his
fleet to choose a place for his settlement, reached the shores of New South
Wales. Accompanying him on board H.M. armed tender "Supply" were a few officers
and the most capable engineers and workmen his fleet could command. They had
rounded the southern shores of Tasmania and now followed in Cook's track along
the east coast. Phillip had been set a great task, for the British Government
had ordered him to form a penal settlement at this great distance from home;
his voyage had been very long and hazardous, and he had almost accomplished it.
Yet even on the very threshold of the country that he had been sent to colonize
his courage might well have failed him when he beheld the vast, bare,
uncultivated land which Cook had discovered.</p>
<p>Its unending coast-line trended strangely;[*] sometimes disclosing features
singularly stern and hard, as at Cape Dromedary, Point Upright, and Longnose,
at others softening into low white sandhills and spreading in wide beaches of
sand where an occasional cabbage-palm was visible; while higher up in the
background a line of blue haze veiled the distant horizon. Between the line of
blue haze and the shore were forests of eucalyptus trees whose leaves of olive
green, and the smoke rising from native fires, did not escape the notice of
those on board the "Supply."</p>
<blockquote>[* Phillip saw more of the coast than Hunter did in this voyage,
and he wrote from Sydney in 1790: "From what I saw when I came on the coast
between this harbour [Port Jackson] and South Cape I make no doubt several good
harbours will be found."--"Historical Records of New South Wales," Vol. I, Part
ii, P. 358.]</blockquote>
<p>As from the deck Phillip watched his ship draw nearer in to the shore he
must have realized that at the end of his journey his work was only just
beginning. Beyond wood and water and the native plants seen by the
"Endeavour's" people none could tell what the country might possess. Before him
stretched the Unknown. Behind him in the fleet were, in all, 1,163 persons, the
majority of whom were prisoners. The most urgent problem confronting him,
therefore, was how to supply the immediate needs of so many people in this
strange land. This alone may well have caused him anxiety.</p>
<p>Since the "Endeavour" had traced her lonely course along that distant coast
no ship had visited the south-eastern part of Australia, and the natives had
probably forgotten all about Cook's visit until, early on the morning of
January 18, 1788, the "Supply" arrived.</p>
<p>Phillip was greatly disappointed with what he saw of Botany Bay. The green
meadows described by Banks were found to be barren swamps and sterile sands,
doubtless owing to a drought that had befallen the country; and the bay itself,
although extensive, was exposed to the full sweep of the easterly winds, which
blew violently and rolled a heavy sea against the shore.</p>
<p>On entering the bay the "Supply" was compelled to anchor a little distance
from land. Some forty natives fishing near the south shore, being greatly
alarmed at the vessel's appearance, hastily dragged their canoes out of the
water, placed them on their backs, and ran off with them into the bush.
Meanwhile the women saw to the safety of their children and the fishing-tackle.
A few of the more courageous men remained behind and ventured to the water's
edge, brandishing their spears and boomerangs and shouting "Warra, Warra!--Go
away, Go away!" exactly as these people had done eighteen years before when
they had watched the arrival of Captain Cook.</p>
<p>On the north side of the bay only six or seven natives were observed, so it
was at this point that, during the day, Phillip, with Lieutenant H. L. Ball,
the "Supply's" commander, Lieutenant King of the "Sirius," and Lieutenant
William Dawes of the Royal Marines prepared to land. In consequence of the
hostility of a small band of blacks who kept up a continuous attack with
stones, Captain Phillip, to avoid a quarrel, ordered the sailors to row along
shore until the boat came to a spot where he thought he might find water. The
search was unsuccessful, and about sunset the party re-embarked and rowed back
to the part of the beach opposite which the "Supply" had anchored.</p>
<p>Several natives armed with spears and waddies had collected there, and were
gazing intently at the vessel. Phillip beckoned to them and made signs that he
wanted water, but they apparently were lost in amazement. Growing impatient at
last Phillip, handing his musket to the man nearest him, sprang out of the
boat, and walked towards the black men, holding out presents to show his
friendly intentions. Seeing that the Governor frequently waved his hand to his
own party to retire, at last one of the oldest blacks came forward, and, giving
his spear to a younger man, advanced alone. When the natives understood what he
wanted they laid down their arms and led the Governor and his party to a
rivulet of fresh water. These natives seemed quite peaceable; but, on Phillip's
return to the beach, others gathered there who resented the landing, and, in
order to reach the boat, it became necessary to fire off a gun to disperse
them.</p>
<p>On the following day, January 19th, three transports arrived and reported
that the hay for the cattle on board was almost exhausted. A party was
consequently sent to cut grass, and Captain Phillip made a tour of the south
side of the bay. In this expedition he again saw the inhabitants, and again
advanced alone to meet them. A green branch was used by both parties as a sign
of friendship, and the blacks threw down their spears to show that they were
amicably disposed. Meanwhile the sailors gave them presents of coloured
flannel, red baize, and beads, with which they adorned themselves. They were
excellent mimics and could imitate the marines to perfection. The sound of the
fife delighted them, but the beating of the drum sent them running into the
bush, and they would not return until it ceased. The headgear of the strangers
also pleased them, and several hats were stolen off their owners' heads, and
whenever an Englishman took off his hat they gave shouts of approval.</p>
<p>"Heavy in clouds came on the day" (January 20th) of Captain Hunter's arrival
in H.M.S. "Sirius" with the remainder of the transports. "To us," wrote Captain
Tench, "it was a great and important day and I hope will mark the
foundation...of an Empire."</p>
<p>The harbour being considered too exposed, the Governor decided to look for a
more convenient landing-place, and set out on January 21st, accompanied by
Hunter and two other officers, in three open boats to examine the coast to the
northward, intending to reach "what Captain Cook had called Broken Bay.[*]
Another opening, marked Port Jackson on his chart, however, first attracted
notice, and Phillip ordered his seamen to explore the inlet within. At first
sight it presented a rather unpromising appearance, having "high, rugged, and
perpendicular cliffs" guarding the entrance on either side.</p>
<blockquote>[* Hunter's Journal.]</blockquote>
<p>In passing between the heads the boats were greeted with wild cries from the
natives on the rocks above. Others were observed in the coves, who, on seeing
the strangers, left the shore and joined those higher up in evident alarm. The
black men followed in the wake of the visitors for some distance, keeping close
to the edge of the cliffs, but the long, heavy swell of the ocean gradually
sank, and the shouts of the natives grew fainter as early in the afternoon the
boats ran into smooth water, and the seamen saw stretching in front of them a
wide and picturesque harbour with bays and coves and rocky points, many being
covered with green foliage down to the water's edge. On the hills inland tall
trees grew, with olive-green leaves resembling those seen upon the coast to the
southward.</p>
<p>Captain Phillip was struck with the beauty of the scene, and when he found a
safe cove possessing both wood and water chose this as the site of his
settlement. The cove was given the name of Sydney in honour of Thomas
Townshend, Lord Sydney, then Home Secretary in Pitt's Government. Two days were
spent in surveying the various coves, and during that time the inhabitants
became well disposed toward the white people, and a chief who went with Phillip
to inspect his camp gave evidence of intelligence and courage. At another point
a party of natives waded into the water to receive the gifts offered them and
showed such manly trustfulness in the British sailors that the Governor
afterwards gave the spot the name of Manly Cove.</p>
<p>On the 23rd Phillip rejoined his people and directions were given to the
fleet to prepare to proceed to Port Jackson. Leaving orders with Hunter to
follow him next day, the Governor on the 25th sailed in the "Supply" back to
this harbour. We find one of the most interesting descriptions of subsequent
events and of the landing at Sydney in the journal of Daniel Southwell,
midshipman in H.M.S. "Sirius." He writes:</p>
<p>About January 24th, to our great surprise, we saw two strange sail in the
offing...a current set them bodily to the southward and, together with a
contrary wind...kept them from coming in until the 26th...They proved the
'Boussole' and 'Astrolabe,' Monsieur de la Perouse."</p>
<p>The French ships had last left Samoa, where at the island of Maouna they had
lost l'Angle the "Astrolabe's" commander, with several other officers and
seamen, and two long boats, in an attack made by the natives while searching
for water. La Pe~rouse had sailed to New South Wales guided by Cook's chart,
and had anchored off Norfolk Island, but could not land on account of the
surf.</p>
<p>On first seeing the British ships, on January 24th--when he tried in vain to
speak to them--La Pe~rouse wrote: "We saw this day a sight entirely new to
us--a British fleet lying at anchor, the colours and pendants of the
ships...plainly distinguishable. Europeans are all fellow-countrymen at such a
distance from home, and we felt the greatest impatience to get to an anchorage,
but the next day was so hazy and our ships sailed too badly to overcome both
the force of wind and currents, so we did not get in until the 26th at nine in
the morning."</p>
<p>As soon as the French ships had anchored, the first lieutenant and a
midshipman from H.M.S. "Sirius" went on board the "Boussole" bearing a message
from Captain Hunter, offering in the name of the Governor all the services in
his power, but regretting his inability to furnish provisions, ammunition, or
sails, since his convoy was on the point of departure. Clonard, second in
command, was at once despatched to tender the thanks of the French commodore to
Captain Hunter--who was already apeak with his topsails hoisted--and to
intimate that the wants of the French did not extend beyond wood and water, of
which they should find plenty in the bay. The first lieutenant did not inform
La Pe~rouse whither the convoy was bound, but several launches and small boats
were under sail, and it was conjectured that the distance must indeed be short
to render it unnecessary to hoist them into the ships. An English sailor, less
cautious than the rest, informed the crew of the "Boussole" that they were only
bound to Port Jackson, a few miles away, where ships could anchor "within
pistol shot of the land in water as smooth as a basin."</p>
<p>After thus exchanging greetings with the French, Hunter's fleet left for
Sydney. Mr. Southwell continues: "We weighed for Port Jackson and came to there
the same evening in as snug a place as London River. Nothing could be more
picturesque than the appearance of the country while running up this
extraordinary harbour. The land on all sides...is covered with trees...Towards
the water's edge craggy rocks and wonderful declivities are everywhere to be
seen. A number of small islands are interspersed...some lying in the middle of
the stream...and although extremely rocky are covered with trees, most of which
are evergreen. The white sides of the eminences with very little help from
fancy have at a distance the appearance of grand seats and superb palaces...The
natives too formed a part in the landscape, for some had posted themselves on
the overhanging cliffs and brandished their lances...We ran two leagues...and
came to a place called Sydney Cove."</p>
<p>On this evening, January 26th, the people were assembled at a point where
the "Supply's" passengers who had arrived with the Governor had first landed in
the morning. Here a flagstaff was erected and a Union Jack displayed while the
marines fired volleys, between which the healths of His Majesty and the Royal
Family with success to the new Colony were cordially drunk.</p>
<p>Not all the ships came into Sydney Cove that evening; some had to anchor out
in the stream.[*] On the following day (.January 27th), however, the remainder
of the fleet drew closer inshore and the landing began. The first undertaking
was to clear the ground and erect houses, the framework of which had been
brought from England. Meanwhile the settlers encamped in tents and under the
trees, "in a country resembling the woody parts of a deer park," and, at first,
there was a good deal of confusion mingled with amusement at the novel
experiences. In one place were "a party cutting down wood, another setting up a
forge, a third dragging a load of provisions; here stood an officer pitching
his tent with his troops parading on one side of him and a cook's fire blazing
furiously on the other," every one animated with a desire to do his utmost in
helping to found the settlement.</p>
<blockquote>[* See log-books of the transports.]</blockquote>
<p>On Sunday, February 3rd, Divine Service was held under the shade of a large
tree (it was a very hot day), at which the Rev. Richard Johnson, chaplain to
the new colony, officiated.</p>
<p>The plan of the town," says Southwell, "is laying out, in which I believe
Mr. Dawes is particularly engaged. Whether a name is decided I cannot tell, but
have heard Albion mentioned." This name we know was not finally adopted, and a
note in the MS. says that Sydney was the title decided upon by the Governor for
the town as well as for the cove upon which he had first bestowed it.</p>
<p>In the meantime La Pe~rouse was busily careening his ships at Botany Bay. At
first few visits were exchanged. But there were on board the "Boussole" and
"Astrolabe" some of the first scientists of France, and soon a pleasant
friendship sprang up between the representatives of the two nations. During
their stay the French officers pitched their tents on shore, set up a small
observatory, and put together the frames of two large boats which they had
brought from France. Round their camp a stockade, guarded by two small guns,
was thrown up as a protection against the attacks of the natives.</p>
<p>At this time La Perouse and his officers penned the letters to their friends
in France which were fated to be the last received from those on board the
ships. Perhaps not without a shade of disappointment La Pe~rouse wrote of his
arrival: "We were preceded by the English only five days. To the most
distinguished politeness they have added every other service in their power,
and it was with regret we watched them depart for Port Jackson...Our boats are
already on the stocks; by the end of the month I expect they will be launched.
We are only 10 miles distant from the English by land and consequently have
frequent intercourse with them." One realizes too the note of sadness in
another letter when, possibly with l'Angle's fate in his mind, La Pe~rouse
wrote: "I have arrived here without a sick man on board either of the ships; I
have formed here a new kind of entrenchment with palisades so as to build our
boats in security; this precaution was necessary against the Indians of New
Holland who... threw spears at us after receiving our presents and experiencing
our kindness. My opinion of uncivilized races has long been formed and this
voyage will confirm it. I have been too often in danger not to know them."</p>
<p>Among the first visitors to the " Boussole " and the " Astrolabe" were
Lieutenant King and Lieutenant Dawes, who came round in the cutter from Sydney
on February 1st, in the morning. They dined with the commodore and after
inspecting the scientific collections in the ships were entertained at the camp
on shore. On February 8th another party of naval officers came overland from
Sydney to visit the French. At the same time Clonard went to Port Jackson,
taking with him correspondence to be forwarded to the French Ambassador in
London. Quite a little <i>entente cordiale</i> resulted from these visits, but
soon afterwards a gloom fell over the French encampment when on February 17th
Pere Receveur, one of the chaplains, died from the effects of wounds he had
received at the hands of the Samoans. He was buried close to the observatory at
the foot of a large tree, on which were nailed two pieces of board with an
inscription bearing his name and the date of his death. Two days later Captain
Phillip sent two horses over to the French camp to conduct La Pe~rouse and his
suite to Sydney. This is the only instance mentioned of the French commodore
visiting the Governor, but it is probable that he came to the settlement more
than once.</p>
<p>On March 11th the "Boussole" and the "Astrolabe" weighed anchor and sailed
to the northwards. For forty years no news of them reached Europe; then
wreckage was found at Vanikoro and information afterwards obtained which left
no doubt that both vessels had been lost there and that many of the Frenchmen
in endeavouring to escape from the waves were killed by the natives.</p>
<p>To return to the settlement at Sydney. The Governor's canvas house had been
erected on the east side of the cove: the military had encamped at the head and
most of the prisoners were placed on the west side. As winter approached
barracks for the soldiers were begun. Capital bricks were made at somewhat less
than a league from the camp, and this spot, though rather a scanty village,
"became a pleasant walk." Gardening, farming, and cultivation of the soil
occupied the attention of every one. A wharf for the convenience of landing
stores was constructed; the long-boats were employed in bringing cabbage-trees
from the lower parts of the harbour, where they grew in abundance, and they
were found fit for use in erecting temporary huts, the posts and planks being
made of the pine of the country, the sides and ends fitted with lengths of
cabbage trees plastered with clay, and the roofs generally being thatched with
grass.</p>
<p>Presently Sydney took shape. According to a description of it handed down to
us by one who lived there in November, 1788, the town at first did not present
an attractive picture. "We have now two streets," says the writer, "if four
rows of the most miserable huts you can possibly conceive deserve that name.
Windows they have none, as from the Governor's house, now nearly finished, no
glass could be spared, so that lattices of twigs are made by our people to
supply their places. At the extremity of the lines, where since our arrival the
dead are buried, there is a place called the church yard."</p>
<p>The curious contrast between the "miserable huts" constructed by the
settlers and the "superb palaces" of Nature's making seen by Southwell must
have lent the Sydney of those early days a very strange appearance. But only
for a time were the huts seen there. As the population increased the streets
were lengthened and more substantially built houses with pretty gardens
supplanted the huts. The new homes, set amid the exquisite surroundings of
harbour scenery on the one side and the wildernesses of bushland on the other,
soon gave to Sydney that charm which ever since has distinguished it.[*]</p>
<blockquote>[* Half a century later Captain Lort Stokes thus wrote of the town:
"A noble city has sprung up as if by magic which will ever serve as a monument
of English enterprise."--"Stokes' Voyage," Vol. 1, P. 244.]</blockquote>
<p>If at first the town was small, the dimensions of the colony placed under
Phillip's control were enormous. He was instructed to administer territory
defined as including "all the east coast of Australia from Cape York to South
Cape (at the southern extremity of Tasmania), its western boundary being
constituted by the 135th degree of east longitude." The Governor's commission
read publicly when he landed had proclaimed him ruler of this immense region,
embracing as it did nearly half the continent under the name of New South
Wales.</p>
<p>The only portions seen or surveyed up to the time of Phillip's coming were
the places Torres and the Dutch had sighted in the north; the shores of the
east coast traced by Cook, and, in addition to Tasman's discoveries in
Tasmania, Marion Bay, where du Fresne had anchored; Adventure Bay and the
islands, and parts of the Tasmanian coast-line, which had been charted by
Furneaux and Cook, so that there was a great field ripe for discovery. As soon
as he had seen the work of building a town started and, when the land was
cleared, the planting of wheat, barley, and rice which had been brought from
Rio and the Cape, Phillip led his people forth on their path of
exploration.</p>
<p>In 1788 he defined the boundaries round a portion of the settlement which
was named the county of Cumberland. We are told that this comprised the portion
lying between the northernmost point of Broken Bay and the southernmost point
of Botany Ray, extending westward to the Lansdowne and Carmarthen Hills, which
he had seen and named during his inland excursions. He also minutely surveyed
the harbours of Botany Bay and Port Jackson, and went several times to Broken
Bay in order to examine its different branches. Charts of all these harbours
were sent home by him to the Admiralty.</p>
<p>It had been arranged that the settlement should never be left without twelve
months' provisions, but in consequence of H.M.S. "Guardian," a 44-gun ship
under the command of Lieutenant Riou, after leaving the Cape on December 23,
1789, being nearly wrecked on her way to Sydney, the colony was brought to the
verge of starvation. By skilful seamanship Riou took the helpless vessel back
to Table Bay, though he wrote home "the ship is past recovery."[*] Meanwhile in
New South Wales much of the valuable live stock imported had been killed, and
not until the arrival of the "Lady Juliana" on June 3, 1790, were the meagre
rations of the hungry people increased.[**] H.M.S. "Gorgon" had been at once
commissioned for the relief of the colony after the "Guardian's" loss was
reported at home, and on September 21st she reached Port Jackson, convoying a
fleet of ten transports, when Captain Parker, her commander, with Captain King,
newly appointed Governor of Norfolk Island, landed with dispatches for Governor
Phillip.</p>
<blockquote>[* "The Gorgon" took most of her stores from the Cape, leaving
nothing but her anchors.]</blockquote>
<blockquote>[** The arrival of the "Neptune," "Surprise," and "Scarborough" in
1790 relieved the distress.]</blockquote>
<p>The "Gorgon's" voyage added to the knowledge of the East Coast. Some of
those in command of the ships in passing up the coast entered harbours which
until then were quite unknown. Lieutenant Bowen, of the "Atlantic," discovered
an inlet where Cook had imagined that the shore would form a bay and had named
its northern point Longnose.</p>
<p>Bowen took the "Atlantic" into the bay and found that its latitude was
35&deg;15' S. Its entrance was from a mile to a mile and a half wide: "the
southernmost point an island [Bowen Island] almost connected with the mainland;
the north point pretty high and rising perpendicularly out of the sea."[*] The
north point at first was taken for a long, low island, but afterwards it was
ascertained to be a peninsula. After Bowen had passed through the entrance he
found himself in "a very capacious basin three or four miles wide and five or
six miles in length," with regular soundings; of it he wrote: "The west side
and head of the bay was a white sandy beach, the eastern shore is bold and
rocky, and there is a small shoal in the middle of the entrance." Bowen came
upon a native canoe upon the beach and saw kangaroos, but could not find fresh
water. He named this harbour Jervis Bay in honour of Admiral Sir John
Jervis.</p>
<blockquote>[* Hunter's Journal, which quotes Bowen's description of
it.]</blockquote>
<p>Another captain, Matthew Weatherhead, anchored his ship "Matilda" "for two
days inside an island off Tasmania in 42&deg;15' S.and 148&frac12;* E."
Weatherhead was one of those energetic seamen who took a delight in making
known the geography of the South Pacific. He appears to have taken the
"Matilda" into an inlet "within" Schouten Island, which, he says, "afforded
shelter for five or six ships."</p>
<p>Schouten Island lies off the eastern coast of Tasmania, and is about ten
miles from it. Weatherhead reached this island, which had been discovered by
Tasman in 1642, and seen by Furneaux in 1774, on July 27, 1791. Neither the
Dutch nor the English navigator had stopped to investigate its shores, both
imagining it to be part of a group. Only a narrow strait separates the island
from Freycinet Peninsula to the northward. The French on coming there in 1802
called the strait G&eacute;ographe Strait, after Baudin's ship, and named the
wide space between Schouten Island and the Tasmanian mainland Fleurieu Bay, now
Oyster Bay, imagining that they were the first to see it but Weatherhead had
brought the "Matilda" to an anchorage there, and on his arrival in Sydney
Captain Tench realizing that he had made a discovery, questioned him concerning
it. In answer to Tench's inquiries[*] Weatherhead likened the bay to Spithead,
and said that he had found plenty of fresh water on shore, and that it was
sandy and in many places full of craggy rocks. The only animals that he saw
were three kangaroos. Although he met with none of the natives, he had seen
several huts like those of Port Jackson, in one of which lay a spear. In honour
of his ship Weatherhead named the place Matilda Bay.</p>
<blockquote>[* Tench's questions and Weatherhead's replies appear in full in an
"Account of Port Jackson," by Captain Watkin Tench, 1793, P. 137.]</blockquote>
<p>Captain Tench, as though afraid lest anyone should doubt the authenticity of
the above discoveries, wrote as follows on the last page of his "Account of
Port Jackson": "The two discoveries of Port Jervis and Matilda Bay may yet be
wanting in the maps of the coast. My account of their geographic situation
except possibly in the exact longitude of the latter...may be safely depended
upon."</p>

<h4>MATTHEW WEATHERHEAD'S ORIGINAL CHART OF JERVIS BAY</h4>
</center>
<p>Weatherhead met with another island off Cape Dromedary, where he thought two
or three ships might easily find shelter. He probably sighted the small bight
on the west coast of Montagu Island (seen by the "Surprise"), where small ships
can take refuge. In the month of the following November he visited Jervis Bay
and examined Bowen's discoveries, of which he made an "Eye Draught " (which we
reproduce), at the same time remarking, " There is exceeding good anchorage
here."[*]</p>
<blockquote>[* "Adm. Sec. In Letters: 2309."]</blockquote>
<p>Alexander Dalrymple made a copy of Weatherhead's sketch, to which he appends
the note, "In the Matilda many natives were seen and canoes on the beach; the
natives were armed with spears but they could have no communication with them."
Dalrymple also shows the mouth of a creek on the west side of the bay and marks
the words "Fresh Water" on the beach south of it. He calls a point yet farther
to the southward Cabbage Tree Point, and on the east side of the bay he gives
the names (from north to south) of Long Point, Long Beach (the "Matilda's"
anchorage), Cawood Point, and Rocky Point, these being the first names given in
Jervis Bay.</p>
<p>No less than five of the "Gorgon's" fleet, including the "Matilda," were
whaling ships. Having seen whales on their way up the Australian coast the
masters obtained Phillips's permission to try for a cargo of oil off there,
hoping to be able to establish a fishery in New South Wales. Captain Melville
of Messrs. Enderbys' ship "Britannia" (followed by the "William and Ann") was
the first to put to sea on October 25th, and killed seven whales on that day,
although he secured only two. Another master killed nine whales and secured
five.</p>
<p>The other captains, Colonel Collins thought, were more desirous of obtaining
a knowledge of the harbours on the coast than of keeping at sea long enough to
be able to determine whether a fishery might be successfully established.
Weatherhead was one of these. He landed during November from a boat in a bay
north of Sydney, "about six miles southward of Port Stephens, where the seine
was hauled and a quantity of fish taken."[*] Captain Nichols brought the
"Salamander" to an anchorage in Port Stephens, "until then not visited by
anyone." He made an eye sketch of the harbour and some of its arms; Salamander
Bay being then placed on the chart.</p>
<blockquote>[* Morna Point is 4&frac12; miles south of Port Stephens, the land
between Morna Point and Newcastle Harbour forming a bay known as Newcastle
Bight.]</blockquote>
<p>Weatherhead left Port Jackson for Peru on December 28th. One dark night his
ship grounded upon Mururoa or Vairaatea (the Osnaburg Island of Carteret). In
1826 Captain Beechey in the "Blossom" saw remains of the vessel, and was able
to identify the shoal as the scene of the "Matilda's" wreck. He named it
Matilda Shoal. Weatherhead and his ship's company reached Tahiti safely in
their boats.</p>
<p>When the Port Jackson natives saw that the white people had taken up a
permanent residence in their land their behaviour changed. For some time they
withdrew from the settlement and appeared to spend their time in fishing and
hunting the kangaroo, called by them "patagorang." Nor would they ever visit
Sydney. Captain Phillips therefore determined to take one of their number
prisoner, thinking that if the man were treated kindly he would induce his
countrymen to place more confidence in Europeans. The first man to be captured
was Arabanoo (named at first Manly after the spot where he was taken). He
became a general favourite but did not live long. Then two sick children were
brought into the hospital for treatment. Later in November, 1789, two other
natives were seized on the north side of the harbour; some of the seamen,
meeting them on the beach, pulled them into the boat and brought them back to
the settlement. One was a chief named Colebe, the other a younger man called
Bennilong. Both were kept at Government House, where they were well treated and
given suitable clothes. Colebe soon afterwards made his escape, carrying off
the whole of his wardrobe. Bennilong was given his liberty in April, 1790, and
at first did not seem inclined to leave the Governor's residence; but one
evening he too disappeared without saying good-bye to his white friends. The
fishing boats subsequently met these two men in the harbour, and afterwards,
although they came armed with either spears or clubs, the natives visited
Sydney, and from that time a better feeling sprang up between the white and
black races.</p>
<p>Up to this time the homes of the colonists had been erected within a
comparatively small space round the shores of the cove, but on the arrival of
fresh ships bringing more prisoners and settlers, Phillip turned his attention
to the formation of fresh settlements; one made in 1788 at Parramatta soon
became a place of importance. On November 2nd, with three officers and a party
of marines, the Governor visited the spot and named it Rosehill, after Mr.
George Rose, then Secretary to the Treasury. Gradually small hamlets began to
spring up amid the surrounding inland country.</p>
<p>Fortunately Phillip remained long enough in New South Wales to see his
colony firmly established and to penetrate many parts of the interior. (An
account of these explorations will be found in another Chapter.) But the
anxiety and cares of office at last weakened his health. It is not unlikely
that the beginning of his illness was due to the scanty fare that he had lived
upon in the time of famine, when the Governor, "from a motive which did him
immortal honour," gave up to the public store flour set aside for his own use,
since he did not wish for more at his table than the daily ration issued to
each person. His health continued to decline, and at length he petitioned the
Home Government to be allowed to return to England. Reluctantly leave was
granted and he left in the "Atlantic" on December 11, 1792, amid the regrets of
the whole community.</p>
<p>The Founder of the first colony, he will ever be remembered as one who, in
the words of the first Governor-General, laid its foundations "deep and wide."
To have reached the bare shores of Australia safely with his fleet was a
triumph of seamanship, but in a space of five years where all was wilderness to
have moulded and left behind him a British colony fast becoming self-supporting
was a feat that only few other men could have accomplished.</p>
<p>Captain John Hunter was appointed to succeed him.</p>
<p>Between the departure of Captain Phillip and the arrival of Hunter there was
an interval of about two years and nine months, during which period the
settlement was administered successively by the senior officers of the New
South Wales Corps (an irregular force raised at home for special service in the
colony). The first of these, Major Francis Grose, who practically suppressed
civil government after Phillip left, thereby creating a serious set-back to all
the former progress, continued in office until December, 1794, when he resigned
and sailed for England. His successor, as Lieutenant-Governor, was Captain
William Paterson, another officer of this regiment. He is best noted for the
energy he displayed in endeavouring to penetrate the mountains, in forwarding
to Europe specimens of the botany and natural history of the country, and in
protecting the settlers from the raids of the natives when they became
troublesome.</p>
<p>There is also evidence that Major Grose and his brother-officers, although
they have been greatly blamed for the disappointing condition into which the
colony relapsed at this time, were not unmindful of its general needs, as the
following extract from a letter written by Captain Paterson (before he became
Lieutenant-Governor) to a friend[*] at home will show. It is dated Port
Jackson, August 23, 1794: "The 'Britannia,' Captain Raven, is taken up by the
officers for the purpose of bringing horses and cattle from the Cape of Good
Hope, and by her I have sent a box of specimens for you and directed Captain
Raven to leave them in charge of Masson if there be no ship ready to sail while
he is there. In return I hope you will not forget me in the garden seeds and
farming seeds such as clover, horse beans, lucerne, and such as you think will
stand the long voyage. At present I have only a garden of 6 acres...My stock
increases fast. I have a large stock of goats, a cow and a calf, and expect
great things by the ' Britannia,' at least I ought for my share is
&pound;400."</p>
<blockquote>[* Forsyth.]</blockquote>
<p>Then Paterson goes on to tell us more about the colony: "Everything looks
well and the country not that desert which many of the first settlers supposed.
We are now independent of flour, and in a few years I have little doubt but
that meat will be in plenty. We find, as the country gets cleared, the soil is
found to be better for wine and corn. I think it will exceed the Cape. The
encouragement Major Grose has given settlers of all descriptions has certainly
done wonders. From this place to the new settlement at the Hawkesbury, a man
can walk in eight hours and a good road made all the way, so that we have an
intercourse with that [place], Toongabby and Parramatta in the course of one
day..."</p>
<p>In 1795, when the second Governor, Captain Hunter, arrived and took over the
Colony from Paterson, its internal affairs again began to flourish. The
fortunes of the land improved, forests were cleared and cultivated, and the
town showed signs of progress. New settlers, too, in increasing numbers made
their homes at Parramatta and in the Hawkesbury River district at Portland
Head.</p>
<p>The first book ever printed in Australia, "The General Standing Orders of
New South Wales, 1802," states that Sydney and Parramatta or Rosehill were
first divided into two parishes, Sydney being called the Parish of St. Phillip
in honour of Governor Phillip, and Parramatta the Parish of St. John in honour
of Captain John Hunter. Sydney Parish included Petersham, Bulanaming, Concord,
and Liberty Plains (named in 1793), while Parramatta Parish included Banks
Town, Prospect Hill, Toongabby, Seven Hills, Castle Hill, Eastern Farm, Field
of Mars (the name given by Phillip to land granted by him to eight marines),
Northern Boundary, The Ponds, and Kissing Point. Each of these places was of
course little more than a hamlet and only consisted of a few settlers'
houses.</p>
<p>The Hawkesbury or St. George's Parish was made the third parish of the new
colony during the rule of Major Grose in 1794. In this region six cattle, some
of the herd first brought to the colony, which had strayed into the bush in
June, 1788, had sought a retreat, and here they or their descendants were
discovered in 1795. The country over which they ranged became known under the
name of the Cowpastures, and it not only formed a happy hunting ground for the
Governors, but also supplied them with the rare luxury of fresh meat. At
Greenhills, its principal town, which was renamed Windsor, Captain John Hunter
spent much of his time. There exists an old sketch of the Cowpastures known as
John Hunter's Chart, made in 1797, on which is shown a lagoon with the name
Black Swan Lake, and at some distance from Mount Taurus, where a bull had been
killed, various inscriptions such as "here a bull was seen" or "beautiful
country." The chart shows that Hunter, as did Phillip before him, went
exploring inland.</p>
<p>Captain Hunter also made expeditions along the coast; in Phillip's time he
had charted Port Jackson and surveyed several rivers; he now initiated fresh
discoveries, and tried to build a ship of 160 tons, which, however, he could
not finish, "but she stood in the frame upwards of two years exposed to the
weather without the smallest decay." He brought to the notice of the Home
Government the native flax, the indigo which grew "spontaneously," and the
astringent bark of trees well adapted for tanning, as well as the abundant iron
ore, and, what was most encouraging, the equally abundant coal.</p>
<p>e left for Europe in September, 1800, and, on taking his departure, placed
the administration in the hands of Captain King, who, when Hunter did not
return, was appointed to succeed him.</p>
<p>Governor King's energy gave an impetus to discovery both on land and sea,
and his efforts to promote British influence extended far beyond the limits of
the colony that he ruled.</p>
<p>remembering the proximity of Tasmania and New Zealand, and, thinking it
unwise to leave the shores of the former island unpeopled and open to the
designs of other nations, he impressed his views upon the Home Government, with
the result that settlers were sent to Tasmania, and a house--possibly the first
ever built in New Zealand--was erected for officials in the Bay of Islands.
King retired in August, 1806.</p>
<p>The new Governor, Captain William Bligh, was a Cornishman like his
predecessor, and had seen service in various parts of the world. He had fought
with distinction at the Dogger Bank in 1781, at Gibraltar in 1782; and, in
1801, under Lord Nelson, he commanded the "Glatton" at the battle of
Copenhagen. In 1787 he had proceeded in the "Bounty" to Tahiti to collect
bread-fruit, and was the victim of the well-known mutiny. His second voyage on
the same errand was a complete success, and to the British Government he seemed
to be the very man to pilot the young settlement into quiet waters. Bligh,
however, brave man though he had proved himself, and superb seaman, as all his
voyages will testify, was not a success as Governor. He soon ruffled the
military officials and roused a commotion which he could not control, with the
result that, after placing him under arrest, they kept him a prisoner within
his own house for twelve months. He returned to England in 1809 and in turn was
succeeded by Colonel Paterson, formerly of the New South Wales Corps, who
arrived from Tasmania.</p>
<p>Paterson left the colony in 1810. He was one of the best and the most
popular of the lieutenant-governors, but his kindliness of heart often
prevented him from doing useful work for fear of giving offence. On leaving
Port Jackson ten boats crowded with people followed his pinnace to the ship,
"cheering him all the way." He died during his homeward voyage.</p>
<p>Lachlan Macquarie, who succeeded him as the new Governor, came of an old
Scottish family settled at Ulva. He had seen service in America, in India, and
at Alexandria. In 1807 he was appointed to take command of the 73rd, and in
1809 received orders to proceed to New South Wales with that regiment, being
promoted to the rank of major-general while he held the reins of
government.</p>
<p>Macquarie's rule, which extended over a period of twelve years, was of the
greatest importance to the colony. He had been invested by the home authorities
with larger powers than any previous Governor with the exception of Phillip,
and had been given a free hand and adequate means to carry out any measures
which he might deem expedient. Among his reforms perhaps none were more
beneficial than those which affected the port itself.</p>
<p>One of his methods was to impose taxes upon native products brought into the
harbour and landed at Sydney by whalers and traders from different islands in
the Pacific. The harbour had become for many of these vessels nothing more nor
less than a dumping ground; and, owing to the fact that its depth of water
allowed ships to discharge their cargoes in the very heart of the town, wharves
and stages sprang up in all directions round the cove. Macquarie insisted that
these buildings should be constructed with some uniformity, and enforced
regulations for the greater convenience of shipping and commerce. His judicious
development of its trade raised Port Jackson to the position of an important
and thriving seaport. Among other taxes he imposed the following:</p>
<p>On each ton of b&eacute;che-de-mer, &pound;5; on each ton of sandalwood,
pearl shell, or sperm oil, &pound;2 10s.; on each spar from New Zealand,
&pound;1, as well as various duties upon cedar, kangaroo skins, and seal skins.
A flourishing trade had long since been established in these commodities so
that the new taxation considerably increased the revenue.</p>
<p>His insight also told him that roads and bridges, being the natural ducts of
a new country, should precede rather than follow colonization, and with prison
labour at his command, by means of chain-gangs, he made roads inland wherever
it was possible to do so, making them so thoroughly that many constructed
during his rule are still used. He encouraged the exploration of the interior
and visited each settlement in turn, going by sea to those at a distance, and
endeavouring to effect improvements wherever it was in his power. In
consequence there was not a pioneer in the country who did not in his heart
thank the British Government for placing such a man at the head of the infant
colony.</p>
<p>Macquarie's activities were not confined to the outlying country and the
adjacent settlements. In Sydney his energies found scope in all directions. He
found the town composed of small houses or huts scattered about or huddled
together according to no organized plan. Under his hand it began to be a fair
city with well-ordered streets and imposing public buildings. He tried also not
only to rebuild the town but to beautify it by planting gardens and by making
walks and roads wherever they would command views of the shores of Port
Jackson. A lighthouse possessing a revolving light was erected by him at South
Head. Mrs. Macquarie had the drive in the Domain laid out after her own plan,
and on the extreme point overlooking the harbour a sort of natural seat has
ever since been known as "Mrs. Macquarie's Chair." The Governor and his wife
bade farewell to New South Wales in December, 1821.</p>
<p>He died in London two and a half years later, and was buried at his old home
in Scotland.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER IV</h3>
<h4>MARITIME DISCOVERIES. PORT JACKSON</h4>
<p>Even before Macquarie's coming to Port Jackson, Sydney was looked upon as an
important British outpost in the southern hemisphere. Thence while the city was
still in its infancy had set out the exploring expeditions of Hunter,
Shortland, Waterhouse, Bass, Flinders, Grant, Murray, Curtoys, and Symons, and
later of King, often with only such equipment as the colony could provide. True
successors to the English sailors of the Elizabethan age, their voyages have
placed some of these seamen among Britain's most noted discoverers. They served
in the naval ships, of which it has been justly said that they helped to build
up the country. Considering the amount of work done, there were not many
vessels employed, and only a close study of the instructions issued to the men
who held commissions in them can throw even a little light on the patience and
skill with which they first explored not only New South Wales but also the
adjacent seas and territories.</p>
<p>the most fascinating story of early Australia is to be found in their
log-books and journals. In these the daily events are recorded, set down at the
time they occurred in a matter-of-fact, sailor-like way--the writer possibly
not realizing that he was entering information which was to complete a link in
the chain of the discovery of a continent. Yet these bare facts seem to unfold
a clearer message for us than anything the most ornate language could
convey.</p>
<p>Following the "Endeavour," which, as we have seen, discovered the east
coast, and the "Sirius" and "Supply," which convoyed the first fleet to
southern waters, the ships whose names are perhaps most familiar in connexion
with the early exploration and settlement of Australia are the "Reliance,"
"Investigator," "Buffalo," "Lady Nelson," and Mermaid."</p>
<h4>"SIRIUS"</h4>
<p>The "Sirius" was a frigate of about 520 tons and mounted twenty guns. Built
as the "Berwick," she was intended for the East India Company; meeting with an
accident by fire she was purchased by the Admiralty and renamed. Captain Hunter
was appointed to command her with the rank of post-captain, but, when the
vessel was assigned to Captain Phillip for his expedition, Hunter for a time
was second in command. On the colonists being landed he resumed his post as
captain of the ship. Unless the story is true that Spanish ringbolts have been
found embedded in the rocks at Sydney, the "Supply" and "Sirius" (with the
vessels forming the fleet) were the first European ships to anchor in Port
Jackson. In September, 1788, the "Sirius" was sent to the Cape of Good Hope to
obtain a supply of fresh provisions for the settlement. It was a rather
remarkable voyage, for on her way thither she steered a course southward of New
Zealand to Cape Horn, endeavouring to keep as much as possible in a parallel
between the tracks of the "Resolution" and the "Adventure," and on November 24,
1788, before rounding the Cape, reached the high latitude Of 57&deg;31' S. The
"Sirius" spent twenty-eight days amid the ice and passed through what Hunter
describes as a lane or street of ice-islands varying in magnitude from the size
of a country church to two or three miles in circumference. Many were half
black, apparently with earth, to which they had adhered; others were tinged a
beautiful sea green.</p>
<p>On January 2nd Hunter arrived at Table Bay and came back to Sydney in May,
1789. When the colonists were reduced to starvation during the famine the
"Sirius" received orders to bring a supply of provisions from China and to call
at Norfolk Island on her way. She left Port Jackson on March 6, 1790, and was
destined never to return, for on reaching Norfolk Island on March 19th she
struck a reef of coral rocks while trying to enter Sydney Bay and became a
complete wreck. Over one hundred years later her anchor was recovered and is
now a "Monument" in Macquarie Street, Sydney.</p>
<p>Captain Phillip then hired a Dutch snow called the "Waaksamheyd"
("Vigilance") to bring the officers and men home, and on his arrival in England
Hunter was as usual placed on trial by court martial for the loss of his ship,
but was honourably acquitted. At this time (October, 1793) we find him on board
H.M.S. "Queen Charlotte" under Sir Roger Curtis at Torbay. He sailed to take up
his appointment as Governor of New South Wales on February 15, 1795, in command
of H.M.S. "Reliance," Captain Henry Waterhouse, an officer who had served under
Phillip, holding the rank of second captain. After calling at Teneriffe and
Rio, Hunter arrived at his destination on September 5, 1795.</p>
<h4>"SUPPLY"</h4>
<p>The "Supply" was a wonderful little ship, and it has been said that she was
"ever the harbinger of glad and welcome tidings."[*] Described as a very firm,
strong little brig, she mounted eight guns and was purchased by the Admiralty
to take the place of the "Grantham" when that ship was proved unseaworthy.
While the complement of the "Sirius" numbered 160 men, that of the "Supply" was
but fifty-five. Under Lieutenant Ball, as tender to the frigate, she helped to
escort the transports and store ships to New South Wales, and seems to have
been especially favoured by Captain Phillip. When eighty leagues eastward of
the Cape of Good Hope, he went on board the "Supply" in order to hurry on in
advance and choose a place for the reception of his fleet. To her, therefore,
fell the honour of being the first ship to follow the "Endeavour" along the
east coast. It has been told how she had entered the harbour of Port Jackson a
day before the other vessels in 1788. While stationed there she had a very
useful career and made many voyages to Norfolk Island. She sailed from Sydney
with the "Sirius" in March, 1790. In the following month Captain Phillip
dispatched the brig on an important mission to Batavia. A little later she too
was ordered home for refitting.</p>
<blockquote>[* Tench.]</blockquote>
<p>The " Supply " returned to England by way of Cape Horn, possibly in the
track which the "Sirius " had previously taken, for on December 27, 1791, she
also reached the high latitude Of 57&deg;32' S. On April 20, 1792, she sighted
the Lizard.</p>
<h4>"RELIANCE"</h4>
<p>Through the services of her officers and men the "Reliance" played a very
distinguished part in promoting settlement and colonization. After Captain
Hunter had landed at Sydney under a salute of fifteen guns from the ship on
Saturday, September 12, 1795, his patent was read constituting him
Governor.</p>
<p>Waterhouse succeeded Hunter as her captain. He was Bass's brother-in-law and
proved a very energetic officer. The colonists owe him a debt of gratitude, for
in 1797, when the "Reliance" in company with another "Supply" under Captain
Kent called at the Cape, Waterhouse and Kent purchased the valuable merino
sheep of the late Colonel Gordon and brought them at their own expense to
Sydney. Waterhouse Island in Tasmania (which possesses a good anchorage) was
named by Flinders in his honour, and when homeward bound in the "Reliance" in
1800 he himself discovered, far to the southward of New Zealand, an island
which he named Penantipodes Island.</p>
<p>In the year 1797 Lieutenant Shortland (who as a midshipman had served
formerly under Phillip), while in pursuit of some runaways, came upon an
unknown river north of Port Jackson, to which he gave the name of Hunter, and
found a harbour where in the surrounding cliffs a stratum of coal was found. At
this spot the settlement, afterwards known as Newcastle, was formed.</p>
<p>Yet among those serving in the "Reliance" at this time who worked for and
guided the destinies of the new land the figures of George Bass and Matthew
Flinders stand out in greatest prominence. Bass was the ship's surgeon, with a
passion for discovery; Flinders a midshipman who two years previously had
completed a difficult voyage in the "Providence" under Captain Bligh, and who
therefore was admirably fitted for the work of exploration. These two men,
sometimes apart, sometimes in company, sailed from Port Jackson again and again
to glean knowledge of the coast-lines of both Australia and Tasmania. Within a
month after their arrival at Sydney they had fitted up a boat only eight feet
in length, called the "Tom Thumb," that had been brought out in the "Reliance,"
in which they traced George's River for a distance of twenty miles beyond
Captain Hunter's Government Survey. In March, 1796, they again put to sea in a
Sydney-built boat (another "Tom Thumb") and gained a minute knowledge of the
coast south of Botany Bay. In returning home they entered Port Hacking, and on
the outward voyage while trying to obtain water their boat was thrown ashore
above Wollongong. From here, coasting Five Islands, they ran southward as far
as the lagoon near Port Kembla, now called Tom Thumb's Lagoon, where they
landed and met with many adventures, falling in with natives unseen before.
Their muskets being rusty and their powder wet, Flinders kept the somewhat
hostile natives amused by clipping their beards while Bass dried the powder and
laid in a store of water. "This part," the former says, "was called Alowrie by
the natives." It is known to us as Illawarra.</p>
<p>On December, 1797, while Flinders was absent in Norfolk Island, Bass took
another voyage. In a whaleboat manned with six volunteers--bluejackets from the
"Reliance"--he visited Shoalhaven, Jervis Bay, and Twofold Bay, penetrating as
far as 40&deg; S. Continuing his southerly course after passing Cape Howe, he
found the coast of the mainland became more and more exposed and was convinced
that a strait existed between Australia and Tasmania. He touched at Wilson's
Promontory and Western Port, and in the belief that the former land had been
seen by Furneaux called it Furneaux Land, though Captain Hunter afterwards
changed the name to Wilson's Promontory "in honour of Mr. Wilson of
London."</p>
<p>Bass's voyage extended along 300 miles of coast, and he drew a rough outline
of the land seen by him, which unfortunately has been lost. The original chart
was entitled "An eye sketch in a whale-boat by Dr. Bass." A part of this was
embodied in a chart which Governor King drew to show the track of the
"Harbinger" through Bass Strait. King observes that the land in Bass's chart
appears to be erroneously laid down to the extent of "twelve miles in latitude
and forty miles in longitude." He has preserved to us, nevertheless, an
important relic of this intrepid seaman, and Matthew Flinders, who supplied
King with details of it, has also made use of it in his atlas, slightly
altering the position of the land, to reconcile it with its true situation upon
the map.</p>

<h4>PART OF AN EYE SKETCH IN A WHALE BOAT DRAWN BY GOVERNOR KING FROM THE
ORIGINAL MADE BY BASS</h4>
</center>
<p>To complete his explorations Bass set out with Flinders in 1798 in a small
schooner of twenty-five tons called the "Norfolk." Touching first at Twofold
Bay they surveyed it and running south came to the Kent Group and Furneaux
Islands, the southeasternmost of a chain of islands between Wilson's Promontory
and Tasmania, some of which Flinders had surveyed in the colonial schooner
"Francis" which had been sent to the relief of the shipwrecked crew of the
"Sydney Cove," an East Indiaman lost in 1797 on her way from Bengal to Sydney.
On October 19th Flinders anchored with Bass at Preservation Island, the scene
of the wreck. From there they went to Cape Barren Island, where they met with
many strange animals, including the wombat, brush wallaby, and the echidna.</p>
<p>On November 1st they anchored for a tide at the largest of the Swan Isles,
two small islands which Flinders had also seen before and had so named because
a European sailor had assured him that he had met with vast numbers of black
swans breeding there. They could not find a single swan, but observed a sooty
petrel and several wild geese. "The swans therefore really turned out to be
geese. This bird was either a Brent or Barnacle Goose with a small short head,
long slender neck and plumage for the most part of a dove colour with black
spots. It had a deep, hoarse, clanging and though a short, yet an inflected
voice. Its flesh was excellent."[*]</p>
<blockquote>[* <i>Cereopsis Novae Hollandiae</i> or Cape Barren Goose, which is
only found in Australian waters.]</blockquote>
<p>From there Bass and Flinders coasted along the northern shores of Tasmania,
and on November 3rd discovered Port Dalrymple and the mouth of the Tamar. Bass
had an opportunity of observing the country situated within an angle formed by
two chains of mountains. They examined the river up to a point where its waters
had become half salt and half fresh. The grey kangaroo abounded in the open
forest and the brushes were tenanted by the smaller black wallaby. The plumage
of the parrots was noticed to be more sombre than those of the mother colony
and many water-birds frequented the arms and coves. Numbers of black swans were
seen swimming in the river. Bass calculated that there were at one spot 300
within the space of a quarter of a mile square and he heard the dying song of
some scores; that song, so celebrated by the old poets, "exactly resembled the
creaking of a rusty alehouse sign on a windy day."</p>
<p>Driven back by gales to the Furneaux Group on November 21st, they left again
on December 3rd to continue their Tasmanian explorations, and on the 6th
discovered Circular Head--the eastern point of a peninsula projecting northward
from the coast. On the 9th, south of Three Hummock Island (the north-eastern
island of the Hunter Group), a long swell was perceived to come from the
south-west, and Flinders hailed it as "the completion of our long-wished-for
discovery of a passage into the Southern Indian Ocean."</p>
<p>On the day on which they saw Cape Grim (the north-west cape of Tasmania) the
land was observed to be washed by ocean breakers, which proved, what had been
already surmised, that a navigable channel separated Australia and Tasmania,
this channel of course being Bass Strait. Following the west coast of Tasmania
downwards, they passed South-West Cape and then South Cape, and turning into
the opening of Storm Bay on December 14th weathered Cape Frederick Henry (of
Furneaux). They examined the openings in the neighbourhood of Tasman's
Peninsula named the Isle of Caves and Norfolk Bay, and on December 21st reached
the entrance of the Derwent. Taking with them Captain Hayes's chart of the
river, they explored it, and anchored in Herdsman's Cove above the spot named
Risdon by Hayes. They beat down the river on January 2nd and turning into
D'Entrecasteaux Channel entered Port Pruen, where they saw signs of a ship's
visit and a tree felled near a run of water. Flinders thought that either
D'Entrecasteaux or Hayes had been there, and as a matter of fact Hayes had
watered his ships in this cove in May, 1793. After surveying Furneaux's
Frederick Henry Bay, Flinders and Bass on January 3, 1799, sailed out of Storm
Bay, and, resuming their exploration of the east coast, completely
circumnavigated Tasmania.</p>
<p>Later in the year Flinders was sent in the "Norfolk" to chart the east coast
of the continent to the northward of Port Jackson, when he discovered Shoal Bay
and after surveying Moreton Bay, anchored in Hervey Bay. The immediate result
of his voyages was his summons to England, where he received from the Admiralty
a commission to return and undertake a complete survey of the coasts of
Australia. He was now promoted to the rank of commander and appointed to the
sloop "Investigator" (formerly the "Xenophon") with a complement of
eighty-eight men as well as a landscape painter, a natural history painter, and
a botanist, who was Robert Brown. Among the officers there were eight
midshipmen, one of whom was John Franklin.[*]</p>
<blockquote>[* Afterwards Sir John Franklin, the Arctic explorer.]</blockquote>
<h4>"INVESTIGATOR"</h4>
<p>On July 18, 1801, the "Investigator" sailed from Spithead, reaching Cape
Leeuwin, Western Australia, and on December 7th entering King George's Sound,
which ten years before (in 1791) Vancouver had visited and named. Here Flinders
careened his ship. Leaving on January 5, 1802, he voyaged along the southern
coast of the continent. From Fowler Bay he proceeded, sometimes on land and
sometimes by water, exploring and naming Spencer Gulf and St. Vincent Gulf.[*]
He also named Mt. Lofty and disproved the existence of the supposed strait
dividing Australia from north to south. He thus annexed the whole of South
Australia for his country. In Encounter Bay he met the "G&eacute;ographe" under
Baudin, and after bidding the Frenchman adieu turned his attention to a fine
harbour near the western entrance of Bass Strait. He was unaware that Port
Phillip had already been discovered by Murray in the "Lady Nelson," and placed
the name of his own ship on a pile of stones at the top of Station Peak. He
reached Port Jackson on May 9th.</p>
<blockquote>["He fell in with two immense gulfs ... he went as high as he could
go in his ship and traced round the heads of these deep gulfs in his
boats."--King's letter to Nepean.]</blockquote>
<p>On July 22, 1802, the "Investigator" left Sydney to survey the eastern and
northern coasts. In this voyage Flinders filled in many blank spaces on Cook's
chart of the east coast, and after entering Torres Strait sailed along the
whole of the Gulf of Carpentaria. On an island in the gulf called Sweers Island
he again left the name of his ship and the date 1803. He stopped at Cape
Wessel. to effect some repairs and returned to Sydney by way of the west coast,
calling at Timor and reaching Port Jackson on June 9, 1803.</p>
<p>Here the "Investigator's" timbers were found to be unsound and she was
condemned. As Flinders wished to finish his survey and then lay his charts
before the Admiralty, he applied to Governor King for a ship to go home in, and
went as a passenger in H.M.S. "Porpoise," of which Robert Fowler, late first
lieutenant of the "Investigator," was placed in command. The "Porpoise" sailed
from Port Jackson on August 10, 1803, in company with the "Cato" of London and
the "Bridgewater," a vessel belonging to the East India Company. The ships had
been a week at sea when, 200 miles from the land, the "Porpoise, followed by
"Cato,'' struck on the Great Barrier Reef and was disabled--the "Bridgewater"
just clearing the danger.</p>
<p><i>The Great Barrier Reef.</i>--The chain of coral reefs which are known
collectively as the Great Barrier Reef--the scene of many a brave seaman's
misfortune--extends for nearly one thousand miles from Swain Reef at their
south-eastern extremity to Bligh's Anchor Cay, their northernmost termination.
They hedge the east coast of Australia from 22&deg;23' S. to as far as Cape
Direction in 12&deg;51' S., whence they trend northwards to Anchor Cay,
"forming a coralline structure unequalled in the world for their vast extent
and formidable obstructions to navigation,"[*] where ship after ship has been
dashed to pieces or left her timbers to whiten and rot, if not to serve as a
beacon to warn the passing mariner.</p>
<blockquote>[* "Admiralty Sailing Directions."]</blockquote>
<p>The reefs vary in breadth from a few hundred yards to several miles, and in
distance from the shore, from twelve to seventy miles. The swell of the Pacific
dashes against the outer edge of the Barrier with terrific force while the
inner waters remain perfectly tranquil. Beneath them, however, lurk innumerable
dangers in the shape of banks, shoals, and sunken rocks.</p>
<p>Although so dangerous, the reefs are surpassingly beautiful. The water is
very clear. The coral, of vivid tints of green, purple, brown, and white, forms
many a fairy bower beneath the waves, and takes every conceivable shape and
pattern. "We had wheatsheaves, mushrooms, and staghorns," writes Flinders, and
other forms in a variety of colours, "equalling in beauty and excelling in
grandeur the parterre of the curious florist." Besides the live coral growing
as it were out of solid rock, there is dead coral in masses of dull
white--composing the stone of the reefs or rising above the water in the form
of blackened lumps; to these last Flinders gave the name of Negroheads. In the
pools within the edges of the reefs are sponges, sea eggs, and sea cucumber
(trepang).</p>
<p>Ships making their way up the east coast to Torres Strait have the choice of
two routes. One leads through Capricorn or Curtis Channel along the Australian
coast and is called the Inner Route, for the ships pass within the reefs. The
other route leads outside the barrier--to the eastward of the reefs--and is
therefore known as the Outer Route.</p>
<p>Since the days of Cook the names of different ships have been bestowed upon
these reefs and shoals, either because the ships discovered them or else met
with mishaps there. Among those thus distinguished in very early times were the
Endeavour Reef (1770), Bellona Reefs (1793), Cato Bank (1803), Frederick Reef
(1812), Kangaroo Shoals (1815), Alert Reef (1817), Minerva Shoal (1818), and
San Antonio Reef (1821).</p>
<p>There are deep openings through the barrier by which ships can either pass
out to the Pacific or from the sea to the coast. Cook discovered the first
passage, while others have been found in comparatively recent times, as, for
example, the Flora Pass, reported by the schooner "Flora" as lately as 1883.
These passages, like the reefs, often take the names of the ships or the men
who threaded them; thus the earliest discovered were Cook's Passage (1770),
Bligh Boat Entrance (1789), Flinders' Passage (1802), Hibernia Entrance (1814),
Indefatigable Entrance (1815), Nimrod Entrance (1822), and many others. In 1798
Captain Swain in the ship "Eliza" discovered the southernmost reef[*] in
22&deg;23' S. 152&deg;37' E., although the brig "Deptford," Captain Campbell,
in the previous year had met with coral reefs--within the barrier--farther
northward, in latitude 21&frac12;&deg; S. The "Eliza" ran for twenty leagues
among the reefs before she cleared them and had soundings from ten to sixty
fathoms. Swain at last found a passage out of them "in 22&deg; S. by a long and
tortuous channel." The reef now bears his name; the pass has none (possibly
because it was no pass but a series of openings which were too sinuous to be
considered safe), but he appears to have been one of the first to navigate a
ship through the reefs off the Australian coast after Cook and Bligh had
threaded their way through Cook's Passage, Providential Channel, and Bligh Boat
Entrance.</p>
<blockquote>[* Lady Elliot Islet is the most southern coral
islet.]</blockquote>
<p>During the "Investigator's" voyage Flinders gained his first knowledge of
the extent and dangers of the Barrier Reef. In company with the "Lady Nelson"
he had steered up the east coast in Cook's track, marking its features and
picking his way through the shoals that line the shore. To the north-north-west
of Breaksea Spit he found a vast mass of reefs twenty leagues from the coast.
When the ships reached Watering or Middle Island (one of the Percy Group) on
October 6th another long range of reefs were seen which Flinders says were not
the identical reefs seen by Campbell in the "Deptford" although they formed
part of the same barrier. He discovered too that these reefs instead of being
two degrees from the nearest island as laid down by Campbell were only twenty
miles from it. Continuing their voyage to the Cumberland Isles the ships
throughout had broken water and reefs on both sides of them. On October 18th
the "Lady Nelson," which had lost her main keel and damaged her trunk, was sent
back to Sydney, and Flinders proceeded on his voyage alone.</p>
<p>Immediately after he parted from the "Lady Nelson" he again became entangled
in reefs extending from east to north-north-west. He bore along "their inner
side," tracing the edge of the reefs until on October 21st he found a passage
out to sea. This is situated forty miles from Cape Upstart, in 18&deg;45' S.
148&deg;10' E., E., and since has borne the name of Flinders' Passage. Its
inner or southern entrance, through which he passed, was seven and a half miles
broad; the passage ran nearly north and south and was twenty-one miles long. He
then continued his course to Torres Strait, discovering the reefs known as
Eastern Fields, and, turning again towards the Main Barrier, entered Torres
Strait by Pandora's Entrance which had been discovered by Captain Edwards in
1791. Flinders says that from the time he entered the reefs, he had to steer
500 miles before lie found a way out; and in giving directions to seamen who
might follow his track through the opening, he writes: "The commander who
proposes to make this experiment must not be one who throws his ship's head
round in a hurry"; and again he says: "If he does not feel his nerves strong
enough to thread the needle (as it is called) among the reefs while he directs
the steerage from the masthead I would strongly recommend him not to approach
this part of New South Wales" (as the coast was then called).</p>
<p>In 1803 when Flinders left Port Jackson for the last time in H.M.S.
"Porpoise" in company with the "Cato" and "Bridgewater" he sailed by the Outer
Route to Torres Strait. Wreck Reef, or rather the chain of reefs, on which the
"Porpoise" and the "Cato" were wrecked on the morning of August 17th (when the
"Bridgewater" left them to their fate), being on the eastern side of the
barrier and about eighteen and a half miles in length and from a quarter to a
mile and a half in breadth. It consists of patches of coral reef separated by
navigable channels and is the home of seabirds and turtle. The eastern end of
it, named, Flinders says, "not improperly," Bird Islet, in 22&deg;10' S.,
155&deg;28' E. was found to be covered with coarse grass and shrubs. After
striking, the "Porpoise took a fearful heel over on her larboard beam ends,"
fortunately falling towards the reef so that her people were saved. The "Cato,"
under Captain Park, struck about two cables length away and "fell on her
broadside," when her masts instantly disappeared. Several of the seamen were
bruised against the coral rocks and three young lads were drowned. One of the
poor boys who had been shipwrecked no less than three or four times before--in
every voyage that he had made--clung to a spar beside his captain and through
the night bewailed that he "was the persecuted Jonas who carried misfortune
wherever he went." He lost his hold among the breakers, was swept away and seen
no more.[*]</p>
<blockquote>[* Flinders, "Terra Australis."]</blockquote>
<p>The shipwrecked men gained the dry sand in the centre of the reef and
prepared their encampment. While searching for firewood that night they
discovered a ship's spar and a piece of timber, rotten and worm-eaten, which,
in the opinion of the master of the "Porpoise," was part of the sternpost of a
ship of about 400 tons. Flinders imagined (as all sailors were then wont to do
when seeing wreckage) that it had belonged to one of La Pe~rouse's ships, but
in more recent years timber as well as coins and other relics from a Spanish
galleon have been recovered within the reefs, where they had been sheltered and
preserved, perhaps embedded in some sandy shallow, so that it is not improbable
that both sternpost and spar came from a long-lost Spanish vessel.</p>
<p>Flinders immediately set to work to build a cutter out of the timbers of the
"Porpoise." This, when finished, he named the "Hope," and embarking in her with
Captain Park and twelve others he sailed on August 26th to Port Jackson. For
the relief of the shipwrecked crews Governor King dispatched the ship "Rolla"
and two schooners, the "Cumberland" and the "Francis." Leaving Port Jackson at
daylight on September 21st Flinders reached Wreck Reef eight days later, when
the crews were taken on board.</p>
<p>During his absence some of his old officers of the " Investigator--among
whom, besides Robert Fowler, were Samuel Flinders and John
Franklin--superintended the building of a small decked ship, which was named
the "Resource." On being manned she was placed in charge of Denis Lacy,
formerly master's mate of the "Investigator."</p>
<p>The officers and men of the "Porpoise" and "Cato" were distributed among the
four ships. Those who preferred to return to Port Jackson went back there in
the "Francis" and the "Resource";[*] others, including Lieutenants Fowler and
Samuel Flinders and John Franklin, sailed in the " Rolla" to China, where they
obtained passages to Europe. Matthew Flinders, with ten officers and seamen,
embarked in the "Cumberland" (the little schooner of twenty-nine tons lent by
Governor King), intending to proceed to England, but on his homeward voyage he
was forced to call at Mauritius. There he was detained by the French and kept a
prisoner for seven years.</p>
<blockquote>[* As the "Resource" sailed to Sydney George Curtoys, commander of
the "LadyNelson" spoke her off Broken Bay and records this fact in his log. In
1804, with the "Lady Nelson" and the colonial sloop "James," she conveyed
settlers from Sydney to Newcastle when Governor King raised that place to the
dignity of a settlement. While voyaging home the "James" was wrecked and went
to pieces off Broken Bay. Her crew was picked up and conveyed to Fort Jackson
by the "Resource."]</blockquote>
<p>Flinders has left a clear account of his explorations in his work "Terra
Australis," and his surveys were so accurate that his maps form the basis of
all modern Australian charts. In later days it is interesting to look upon the
first bare outline of New Holland in one of his journals, from which the
northern coasts are missing (it being simply a rough draft made when he was a
midshipman, in 1792, with Captain Bligh in H.M.S. "Providence," before he had
seen the southern continent), and then to turn to the charts accompanying
"Terra Australis," in which every part of it appears delineated with so much
care, skill, and detail that each map is a revelation in draftsmanship. One
cannot help wondering whether Flinders when he drew that first roughly formed
picture of the country was even then attracted to it and had resolved to fill
in its outline; but, be this so or not, his name and the discovery of its
coasts are inseparably connected.[*]</p>
<blockquote>[* He died in London in 1810, and was buried in the churchyard of
St. James's, Hampstead Road.]</blockquote>
<h4>"BUFFALO"</h4>
<p>The "Buffalo" is well known on account of her many pioneering voyages; and
writers of the early history of the colonies seem to regard her with a feeling
akin to affection. Her figurehead was the effigy of a kangaroo, which may have
endeared her to the white people as it did long ago to the black natives, of
whom it is said that they were never tired of gazing at her as she lay at
anchor in Sydney Harbour.</p>
<p>Turning over the pages of one of her log-books[*] we find her first in her
own country at her moorings at Deptford (alongside the "Discovery"), under the
command of Captain Ravenn,[**] and one of the earliest entries runs: "On
Saturday, December 17, 1797, received on board fifty-one cauldrons of coal for
the use of the colony of New South Wales"--an order evidently given before the
discovery of coal in Australia had become known in England. It was a debt that
was afterwards to be liberally repaid, for by Governor Hunter's orders a few
years later coal was carried from Newcastle to Table Bay for the use of British
ships calling at the Cape. The log-book continues: "On March 3rd the 'Buffalo'
made sail to Long Reach," where, on March 24th, "the settlers to be rated as
supernumeraries for victuals" came on board. On May 1st at 7 a.m. two boats
were sent to Tilbury Fort for gunpowder for the ship's store, and by the 10th
the ship had again weighed anchor and dropped down to the Nore towards H.M.S.
"Zealand," the flagship of Admiral Lutwidge. On the 12th she received fifteen
men from this ship to make up her complement. From the Nore the "Buffalo"
sailed to the Downs, and on June 8th came to in St. Helen's Roads, where
Captain Raven went on board H.M.S. "Arethusa" and received his final
instructions before sailing. On June 9, 1798, in company of eight sail bound
for India, the "Buffalo" stood out to sea.</p>
<blockquote>[* Captain's Log, 1797.]</blockquote>
<blockquote>[** William Raven, formerly of the "Britannia."]</blockquote>
<p>On her outward voyage she called at Rio de Janeiro and again at Table Bay,
losing before she reached the former port one of the ship's company, for
another entry states on Friday, August 3rd: "Missed Edward Parkinson, boy, who
could not be found and imagined was washed out of the head and drowned as
nobody could give an account of him since six o'clock." Boys were shipped to
sea at an early age in those days and sometimes were unfitted for the hazardous
life. The age of poor Edward Parkinson is not recorded, but Peter Lainz, the
little cabin boy from St. Malo who sailed with Bougainville, was only twelve
years old. He also disappeared one evening after the ship had passed Cape Verde
in the same mysterious manner and was never heard of again.</p>
<p>At Table Bay the "Buffalo" took on board (not inappropriately) a number of
South African cattle for the colony. On January 4, 1799, she again made sail
with the fleet for India, but parted from it at daylight on the following
morning and continued her voyage alone. Many of the cattle died before she
reached Sydney on May 3rd, although Captain Raven put into Adventure Bay and
Jervis Bay to obtain a supply of fresh grass and water for them. At both places
Tasmanian and Jervis Bay natives were seen and were "very friendly," coming
down to the beach "among the people," so that in these harbours, as well as at
Sydney, the ship's figure-head may have made a good impression.</p>
<p>From this time onward the "Buffalo" was always busy. She played the part of
flagship or transport, discovery or store ship with equal success. In 1800
Governor Hunter came back to England in her. On once more returning to the
southern station she carried out important explorations, and in 1803 made
surveys in New Caledonia. Captain Kent then visited the country, and on this
voyage Port St. Vincent was named in honour of Admiral Sir John Jervis.[*]
Among the ship's most notable missions under Captain Kent was that of the
founding of Launceston, Tasmania, in 1804. (Hobart had been established
already.) In accordance with his instructions the LieutenantGovernor, Colonel
William Paterson, sailed from Sydney on Sunday, October 14th, embarking in the
" Buffalo " under a salute of eleven guns from the fort. Forty-six officers and
men of the New South Wales Corps accompanied the Governor, while the " Lady
Nelson " also carried troops and settlers to the proposed settlement. Two
smaller vessels, the " Francis " and the `Integrity," at the same time received
orders to sail with Captain Kent to Port Dalrymple.</p>
<blockquote>[* Kent named three islands inside the coral reef at Port St.
Vincent, King, Paterson, and Robbins Islands--after the Governor of New South
Wales, Colonel Paterson, and Mr. Robbins respectively--and the little island
where the "Buffalo" anchored on her arrival was called Skull
Island.]</blockquote>
<p>fter leaving the harbour the ships, sailing southwards, met with a heavy
gale, "which almost blew them back to Port Jackson." A few hours before the
gale began the "Francis" had parted company with the "Buffalo," but the "Lady
Nelson" and the "Integrity" remained with the flagship until the end of the
storm, when the latter lost sight of both vessels. Owing to the tempestuous
weather, out of the four ships which had left Sydney the "Buffalo" alone
reached Port Dalrymple and moored on November 3rd four miles within the port.
Next day she dragged her anchors, and touched, in spite of every exertion, but
fortunately on a flat rock. By a spirited effort on the part of the crew she
was floated undamaged, her anchor was slipped, and she was taken three miles
higher up the harbour, where during the day the "Integrity" joined her.</p>
<p>On November 11th possession was taken of the northern shores of Tasmania on
behalf of Great Britain with the usual formalities. The Lieutenant-Governor was
saluted with eleven guns by the "Buffalo" on landing, and a royal salute was
fired when the Union Jack was hoisted. On the 13th the general disembarkation
took place at Outer Cove, where the Lieutenant-Governor had fixed his camp amid
surroundings that seemed to all delightful, the waters of the harbour extending
inland for many miles without interruption.</p>
<p>party of Tasmanian natives (now an extinct race) were encountered next day
by some of the new colonists. At the sight of the white men they gave a furious
shout and followed the British back to their camp. Here overtures were made by
Colonel Paterson and they grew more conciliatory. Now and then, however, an
indignant clamour, beginning with a single individual, ran rapidly through
their lines, accompanied by excited gesticulations, the natives "biting their
arms as a token of vengeance." In the end the blacks, we are told, "withdrew
peaceably but were positive in forbidding us to follow them."</p>
<p>On November 21st two small ships--the "Lady Nelson" and the "Francis"--with
torn sails and splintered masts, having sought refuge first at Twofold Bay and
afterwards among the Furneaux Group, joined the "Buffalo" and "Integrity" at
Port Dalrymple. On their coming into the port those on board saw with
satisfaction the British colours flying on shore, and on the 23rd the bricks
which had been sent from Sydney in the "Lady Nelson" to build houses for the
settlers were safely landed. The "Buffalo" took her departure on November 29th,
but before she left her crew erected two beacons to facilitate the safe entry
of ships into port.</p>
<p>One of the last voyages of the "Buffalo" was made in 1807, when she sailed
for England after her long stay in the colony. Among her passengers on this
voyage were Mr. Marsden, senior chaplain, and his wife, and Mrs. King, wife of
Governor King. After leaving Sydney a heavy gale threatened and it was proposed
that the passengers should quit the "Buffalo," since she was an old ship and
thought unseaworthy, and go on board a stauncher vessel which bore her company.
The Governor's wife, however, was an invalid and could not be moved, and Mrs.
Marsden would not leave her, so that the chaplain refused the offer and
remained behind. Throughout the night the gale blew strongly, and the creaking
timbers of the "Buffalo" groaned beneath the violent storm in a manner which
gave those on board much concern. When morning dawned all eyes sought for their
companion ship. But in vain. She was nowhere to be seen, nor was she ever heard
of again.</p>
<h4>"LADY NELSON"</h4>
<p>In entering upon her eventful colonial career the "Lady Nelson" did that
which alone ought to immortalize her--she was the first ship that ever sailed
parallel to the entire southern coast-line of Australia.[*] A brig of sixty
tons, she was built at Deptford in 1799, and differed from other exploring
vessels in having a centre-board keel. She was chosen for exploration because
her three sliding centre-boards enabled her draught to be lessened in shallow
waters, for when these were up she drew no more than six feet.</p>
<blockquote>[* "Early History of Victoria."--F. P.
Labilli&egrave;re.]</blockquote>
<p>In 1799, when the news reached London that the French were fitting out an
expedition to survey unknown portions of Australia, the authorities were
quickly stirred to renewed activity and decided to send the "Lady Nelson" to
Sydney. She was hauled from Deadman's Dock into the river on January 13, 1800,
with her full complement of men and stores on board, having been placed under
the command of Lieutenant James Grant, and stocked with provisions for fifteen
men for a period of nine months and enough water for three months. Before
sailing her armament was increased to six carriage guns.</p>
<p>In January 16th she sailed to Gravesend. So small did she look when she left
the Thames that the sailors in the ships in the river ridiculed her appearance
and ironically christened her "His Majesty's Tinderbox." Grant called at
Portsmouth, where he had orders to leave port with H.M.S. "Anson," Captain
Durham, who (the Powers being at war) was to convoy a fleet of East Indiamen
then on the point of sailing; and with them was H.M.S. "Porpoise," bound for
New South Wales. This ship was formerly the "Infanta Amelia," prize to the
"Argo," and was lying at Portsmouth when H.M.S. "Porpoise," after twelve months
delay, was proved unsound. The Admiralty purchased the Spanish vessel,
rechristened her the "Porpoise," and she sailed in company with the convoy on
March 18, 1800. In New South Wales she proved an extremely useful ship, and
with the "Buffalo" carried out the orders of Governor King, having been placed
under his authority. She met her end, as has been told, on Wreck Reef.</p>
<p>After leaving Portsmouth the "Lady Nelson" did not long remain with the
convoy. From the first she was scarcely able to keep pace with the big ships
which bore her company, and when the commodore gave orders for her to be taken
in tow by the "Brunswick" those on board had an unpleasant experience. On March
23rd Grant therefore determined to let go the hawser and to proceed on his
voyage to Sydney alone. The brig eventually reached her destination in spite of
all predictions to the contrary, and early on December 16th sighted the
flagstaff at Port Jackson, which port she entered at six in the evening.
Grant's coming gave much satisfaction to the colony, and when Governor King
heard the description of his passage through Bass Strait, and of how the "Lady
Nelson" had passed deep indentations on the north side of it and had seen
beautifully wooded shores and rocky islands lying off them, he was greatly
pleased. He did not, however, conceal his disappointment that Grant had been
unable to penetrate a deep bay called by him Governor King's Bay (a name which
afterwards was changed to Port Phillip).</p>

<h4>CHART OF BASS STRAIT DRAWN BY GOVERNOR KING, WHICH EMBODIES NOT ONLY PARTS
OF BASS'S EYE SKETCH, GRANT'S CHART AND FLINDERS' MS. CHART, BUT ALSO A SKETCH
GIVEN TO THE GOVERNOR BY MR. REID, MASTER OF THE "MARTHA"</h4>
</center>
<p>Governor King had been instructed to have the whole of the south coast
properly charted, and he determined to send Grant back again in the "Lady
Nelson" to survey it. Grant on returning to Port Phillip for the second time
failed to explore the bay; and John Murray, formerly master's mate in the
"Porpoise," was appointed to succeed him as commander of the "Lady Nelson,"
after he had voluntarily sent in his resignation. Murray's appointment is dated
September 3, 1801, and in January, 1802, he entered Port Phillip. He saw it
first on January 5th, but, a high sea preventing him, he could not then effect
an entrance and steered away to King Island, the eastern shores of which he
surveyed, returning on January 30th to the south coast. He then sent Mr. Bowen
and five men in the "Lady Nelson's" launch to examine Port Phillip. A "most
noble sheet of water" was found. On the return of the launch Murray himself
sailed into this newly discovered port in the "Lady Nelson," and after
surveying and charting it for the Governor's satisfaction he hoisted the Union
Jack. The chart of Port Phillip then drawn by Murray may be termed the most
important he ever made, and it was one of those sent home to the Admiralty by
Governor King. It shows the track of the "Lady Nelson's" boat when the brig
entered Port Phillip for the first time in 1802. As the chart Grant had made of
its outer shores was very imperfect, the Governor himself drew an eye-sketch of
Grant's explorations, which was sent home also.</p>
<p>Governor King made other drawings of Bass Strait. We have 111 already
referred to the one which combines Bass's eye-sketch with the "Harbinger's"
track through the Strait. The "Harbinger," under Captain Black, came from the
Cape and arrived at Sydney on January 11, 1801. She had closely followed in
Grant's track and was therefore the second ship to sail through Bass Strait. On
his way Black met with an island which he named King Island in honour of the
Governor.[*] Another eye-sketch drawn by King shows the track of the ship
"Margaret" from England commanded by Captain Buyers, this being the third ship
to sail through Bass Strait. She came to an anchorage in Port Jackson on
February 7, 1801.</p>
<blockquote>[* Mr. Reid of the "Martha," however, had first seen it in 1799,
and had informed Governor Hunter of his discovery.]</blockquote>
<p>There is yet another very early MS. chart of Bass Strait in existence and
one which is historic. It is described as "A chart of Bass's Straits generally
laid down from one published by Alexander Dalrymple, Esq., with additions made
during the 'Arniston's' passage through them in 1804." Louis de Freycinet
acknowledged that the drawing of Port Phillip in his chart of "Terre Napoleon"
was taken from it. Originally copied from one of Dalrymple's charts during the
"Arniston's" voyage, it was found among the papers of the "Fame" when that
vessel was captured by the French ship "Piemontoise" in 1806. The "Arniston"
was one of a fleet of ships that left England in 1804 under convoy of H.M.S.
"Athenien," whose commander had received orders from the Admiralty "to proceed
with the East India ships under his convoy through Bass Strait to China passing
east of New Holland and Port Phillip."[*] Interesting as it is (the original
being still preserved in the <i>dossier</i> of Baudin's journal in Paris), the
chart has no geographical importance, for the shores which profess to be those
of Port Phillip bear no resemblance to the outlines of that harbour.</p>
<p>We now return to the story of the "Lady Nelson," a vessel which occupies a
niche in the history of Victoria somewhat similar to that filled by the
"Endeavour" in the annals of New South Wales; but whereas Cook's ship
discovered the east coast and then left it, the "Lady Nelson," after charting
the bare coast-line of Victoria, returned again and again to explore its inlets
and to examine its shores. Indeed, while she was stationed at Sydney there was
scarcely a dependency of the mother colony that was not more or less indebted
to her whether for proclaiming it a British possession, or for bringing it
settlers and food, or for providing it with a means of defence against the
natives.</p>
<blockquote>[* Sailing orders, Dalrymple to Marsden; May 25,
1804.]</blockquote>
<p>The "Lady Nelson" went northward as well as southward, and in company with
the "Investigator," in 1802, examined the Queensland shore as far as the
Cumberland Islands. In making her way up the coast, unfortunately, she
sustained damage which rendered her unfit for service. At the time the ships
were within the Great Barrier Reef; and Flinders states that he kept the brig
with him until a passage clear of reefs could be found to enable her to get out
to sea. Flinders bade Murray farewell among the Cumberland Islands when
Flinders wrote: "The zeal he had shown...increased my regret at parting from
our little consort."</p>
<p>After separating from the "Investigator," Murray, in order to spare the
"Lady Nelson's" sole remaining anchor, gave orders for two swivel guns crossed
to be lashed together, and, when winds were light and waters smooth, he
anchored with the swivels until the carpenter was able to make an iron-bark
anchor to take their place. He made his way carefully down the coast and
reached Sydney Cove on November 22nd.</p>
<p>In 1803 Lieutenant George Curtoys succeeded Murray in command of the "Lady
Nelson." He had been master's mate of the "Glatton," and before coming to
Australia had spent a long term of confinement in a French prison during the
war with that country; his health, therefore, was in a rather delicate state
when he took charge of the vessel. He was highly recommended to Governor King
by Captain James Colnett. On June 10, 1803, in company with the "Albion,"
whaler, Captain Bunker, the "Lady Nelson" sailed from Sydney with the first
British colonists under Lieutenant Bowen for Risdon Cove, on the Derwent River,
and then was laid the foundation of the present city of Hobart. This was the
first attempt made by the British to colonize Tasmania, Risdon being chosen as
the site by Bowen because there the best stream of water ran into the cove and
also because there were extensive valleys behind it.</p>
<p>When the colonists had disembarked at Risdon Cove and building operations
had been started, at which time we are told that the "Lady Nelson" "lent the
colony a bell and half a barrel of gunpowder," the brig returned to Port
Jackson. Here Lieutenant Curtoys was again taken ill and was removed to the
naval hospital. As his health did not improve, he shortly afterwards resigned
his command and retired from the Royal Navy.[*]</p>
<blockquote>[* Later we find him in charge of a brig which traded between Java
and Timor, and his death was reported at Timor in 1813.]</blockquote>
<p>The "Lady Nelson's" new commander was James Symons, who also had served as
midshipman in the "Glatton" under Captain Colnett and afterwards on board the
"Buffalo." Symons was ordered by Governor King to proceed to Port Phillip to
assist in moving the settlement (which had been formed at that place in 1803
under Colonel Collins) to Tasmania. The "Lady Nelson" left Sydney on November
28, 1803; but, being delayed by bad weather first at the Kent Group and again
at Port Dalrymple, she did not reach her destination until January 21, 1804. On
the 25th, having received the Port Phillip settlers on board, in company with
the "Ocean" she made sail out of Port Phillip Bay. After a passage of ten days
she reached Risdon. Colonel Collins thought this site ineligible and gave
orders for the Risdon settlement to be moved to Sullivan's Cove, where he had
encamped, the name Hobart, which had been given by Lieutenant Bowen to Risdon,
being retained for the new site. Later in the year 1804 the "Lady Nelson" under
Symons visited New Zealand and Norfolk Island, and helped to remove white
settlers to Launceston when the Norfolk Island settlement was broken up.</p>
<p>In 1806 Symons received instructions from the Governor of New South Wales to
convey a New Zealand chief named Tippahee or Tepahi, and his sons from Sydney
back to his own dominions. Tippahee's residence was at the Bay of Islands, and
there he was safely landed. Before lie entered the harbour Mr. Symons carried
out a little expedition of exploration and examined a deep bay in his boat,
ascending a river which he seems to have surveyed. Among the many valuable
charts made by the commanders of the "Lady Nelson," however, there are not any
of New Zealand, and possibly Symons did not actually chart the places which he
has described.</p>
<p>From this time. forward occasional voyages were made by the "Lady Nelson,"
and we read of the different governors and officials taking excursions in her
to the various settlements. No detailed record of these exists, so it is not
always easy to trace the doings of the ship. For some years she lay dismantled
in Sydney Harbour, and during that period is described as "nothing more nor
less than a coal hulk." Before this she had been handed over by the Admiralty
to the colonial authorities.</p>
<p>In 1819, by an order of Governor Macquarie, she was thoroughly overhauled
and accompanied the "Mermaid" as far as Port Macquarie; later, in 1824, when in
charge of Captain Johns, she was chosen to convey settlers to Melville Island,
where the British Government had determined to form a settlement. With H.M.S.
"Tamar" (Captain James Gordon Bremer) and the "Countess of Harcourt," a ship
chartered to assist him, the "Lady Nelson," heavily laden with passengers,
soldiers, and stores sailed on August 24, 1824.</p>
<p>She then left Port Jackson for the last time. On September 20th the vessels
reached Port Essington, and an entry in Captain Bremer's log states that on
that day possession was taken of the north coast of New Holland on behalf of
the British Government. On November 10th Captain Bremer took leave of the
settlement and handed it over into the charge of Captain Maurice Barlow, who
had been appointed commandant. The "Lady Nelson" remained behind to act as
guard-ship, and she was also required to bring needed stores and supplies from
the islands to the northward for the use of the settlers.</p>
<p>resh provisions being scarce, in February, 1823, Captain Barlow dispatched
her to the islands for a cargo of buffaloes. When she left Port Cockburn her
commander was warned to avoid an island called Baba, which was infested with
pirates who bore the reputation of being very daring and very cruel. It is
supposed that the warning was unheeded. for there the little vessel met her
end. When Lieutenant Kolff, of the Dutch Navy, visited Baba in July, 1825, the
inhabitants were shy and deserted the village called Tepa on his landing. He
was convinced that a crime had been committed, and learned that some months
previously "an English brig manned by about a dozen Europeans had anchored off
Aluta on the S.E. coast and had engaged in barter with natives, who were on
board in great numbers and who, taking the opportunity of five men being on
shore...attacked and killed the people in the brig as well as those in the boat
when they returned." The last news of the "Lady Nelson" was brought to Sydney
some time afterwards by a ship called the "Faith," whose captain reported that
her hull with her name painted on the stern was still to be seen at Baba
Island.</p>
<p>Besides the ships whose work has been described above, there passed in and
out of Sydney Heads small colonial vessels including the "Norfolk," "Francis,"
"Cumberland," "Edwin," "Integrity," and "Resource," whose histories are
interwoven not only with that of Port Jackson but with those of Tasmania and
New Zealand as well. There were also the East India Company ships bringing more
prisoners to the colony. And these too played their part in discovery. On their
way across the Pacific their commanders frequently took unknown routes and drew
many a useful chart of islands and channels seen, which Dalrymple afterwards
published. The charts show the tracks of their ships, and the accounts of their
voyages may be read in the first Sydney newspapers where many a thrilling tale
of adventure is narrated, rivalling those old stories of the Spanish main
recorded in the more ancient chronicles of the sea.</p>
<p>All these voyages created keen interest at Sydney, especially when on the
arrival of the ships their commanders brought the news of the finding of a new
harbour, coast, or river, with information that the land was fertile and its
waters a good sealing ground. An impetus was given to shipping and colonization
and fresh ventures were quickly planned, men sometimes setting out of the port
in the frailest craft with the poorest equipment, to investigate the desirable
regions. These ventures "helped largely to develop the spirit of daring, the
strong love of liberty which pushed forward the rough aggressive pioneer work
and cleared the way for British dominion in neighbouring lands."[*]</p>
<blockquote>[* Old Sydney Traders by Maorilander.]</blockquote>
<p>To Port Jackson, too, there came traders from all countries, including the
weather-beaten South Sea whalers laden with furs from the sealing grounds on
the New Zealand coasts. Sealers also came from the islands in Bass Strait,
where, save when an occasional King's ship put in an appearance, they were
monarchs of both sea and land. Others there were from islands farther to the
northward the stories of whose voyages are memorable not only as tales of
adventure but for the gorgeous setting in which the scenes were laid amid
islands, atolls, and coral reefs.</p>
<p>What a history of their first coming those old skippers might have written!
The majority were venturesome, hard-grained British seamen (with an occasional
American), who ably assisted the naval officers who traversed long ranges of
sea-line, for we find the old maps marked with their tracks and the names of
the ships[*] in which they sailed from Sydney to Tahiti or Fiji, where they
occasionally sought a cargo of sandal-wood. From Port Jackson some sailed
southward to Hobart, and from Hobart they penetrated farther southward to
Macquarie Island,[*] dispersing when whales and seals in Australian waters
became scarce, to come together again in later years at New South Shetland.</p>
<blockquote>[* Such names as the "Britannia," "Nautilus," "Eliza," "Hibernia,"
"Favourite," and "Active."]</blockquote>
<blockquote>[** Among these the "Emerald," "Perseverance," "Lynx," "King
George," and "Betsy."]</blockquote>
<p>Some of the names of the captains of these ships will live in the history of
exploration, as, for example, Matthew Weatherhead, whose story has been told;
Raven of the "Britannia" and Bampton of the "Endeavour," both pioneers of Dusky
Bay; Ebor Bunker, who, in the "Albion," carried some of the first British
settlers to Tasmania; Alexander Rhodes of the "Alexander," beloved of the
Maoris; Frederick Hasselburg of the "Perseverance," who discovered Macquarie
and Campbell Islands and later lost his life by drowning among those islands;
George Powell of the "Dove,"[*] whose chart will ever be remembered in the
history of the Antarctic; and Richard Siddons of the "Lynx," perhaps the
greatest traveller of them all, who gave so much information concerning early
Fiji, and delighted to hold mission services on board his ship in Sydney
Harbour, and whom we find later in company with William Smith and Robert Fildes
in Blythe Bay, New South Shetland.</p>
<blockquote>[* Formerly of the "Queen Charlotte," and afterwards of the
"Rambler," who was killed by natives of Vavu.]</blockquote>
<p>There were also those foreign discovery ships whose commanders followed La
Pe~rouse into southern waters and entered Port Jackson to seek refuge for their
weather-beaten vessels and to gain knowledge of the southern continent, of
which they have given us accounts in their journals. They saw Sydney while the
town was in its infancy, when canoes of the blacks floated on the waters of the
harbour, and trees and foliage still covered the surrounding points and
indentations, so that their writings are valuable records. The most notable
expeditions being those of Alexandro Malaspina, who brought the Spanish ships
"Descubierta" and "Atrevida," in 1793; of Baudin, commander of the French ships
the "G&eacute;ographe" and the "Naturaliste," in 1802; also of De Freycinet,
who came in the "Uranie " in 1819; Commodore Bellingshausen a year later with
the Russian ships "Vostok" and "Mirni," a navigator celebrated for his long
voyages in the Antarctic; Duperrey in the "Coquille" in 1821; Bougainville the
younger with the ships "Thetis" and "Esperance" in the same year; and Durnont
d'Urville in the "Astrolabe," who came in search of La Pe~rouse's expedition
(1826-28) and at last found the island where the ships were lost.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER V</h3>
<h4>THE EXPLORATION OF THE INTERIOR</h4>
<h4>GOVERNOR PHILLIP AS EXPLORER</h4>
<p>The first Governor of New South Wales had soon discovered that although he
had been set over so vast a territory there was only a narrow strip within his
grasp. Within a few miles of Sydney there ran a range of mountains rising in
places almost perpendicularly to a height of from 4,000 to 5,000 feet. Curving
above Broken Bay on the north and below Port Jackson on the south they formed a
barrier which completely hemmed in the settlement and cut off all advance into
the interior.</p>
<p>They were part of the Great Dividing Range which runs with scarcely a break
down the eastern coast of the continent from Cape York, the most northerly
point, to Wilson's Promontory at the southern extremity. Because of their
cobalt colouring Captain Phillip gave them the name of the Blue Mountains. No
more apt designation could have been found, for the atmosphere at the distance
from which they are viewed imparts to them a wonderful blueness. For
twenty-five years men tried in vain to pass over this barrier. In the days of
Phillip and under the rule of his immediate successors expeditions, all of
which ended in failure, left Sydney and endeavoured to penetrate different
parts of the mountains. Perhaps because in those early years no one was able to
cross them they held a strange and powerful fascination for the colonists.
Rocks, precipices, and thick eucalyptus scrub might repel the would-be
discoverer, but when days bright with sunshine revealed sparkling waterfalls
and smooth green patches among the ranges the desire to explore became
irresistible. Many set out never to return; often a settler in search of grass
or a pioneer starting without proper equipment vanished for ever in the
wilderness of forest; but his disappearance caused little surprise and the
country to the westward remained unseen and unknown.</p>
<p>The first actual attempt to reach the mountains was made by Phillip himself
shortly after his arrival. On April 15, he departed with provisions for four
days attended by officers and a party of marines. In three days they passed the
swamps and marshes on the north side of the harbour and found themselves in
rocky barren country covered with bush, which made their advance difficult and
often impossible. Fifteen miles from the coast Phillip obtained a fine view of
the mountains, and he called the northernmost the Carmarthen Hills, the
southernmost the Lansdowne Hills, and one between Richmond Hill.</p>
<p>At that time he felt sure that there must be a river near at hand, and on
the 22nd started again, taking with him some small boats in which to cross any
stream that might be found. For four days, by keeping close to a small creek,
his party pushed their way through difficult country, and on the fifth day
reached a small eminence whence for the first time a full view of the
Carmarthen and Lansdowne Hills was obtained. Phillip named this eminence, which
was his farthest point, Belle Vue Hill. Lack of provisions then compelled him
to return to Sydney, having fully proved the difficulties of penetrating into
the interior, for the whole distance covered by his party had not exceeded
thirty miles.</p>
<p>nother expedition was planned by him to examine the country westward from
Belle Vue, but it had to be deferred. In June, 1789, however, whilst surveying
Broken Bay, which he had seen first in March, 1788, Governor Phillip discovered
a large river whose water at a short distance from the entrance was found to be
fresh and good. He named it the Hawkesbury, and on June 26, 1789, Captain
Watkin Tench and Mr. Arndell, assistant surgeon, reached the banks of another
river to which the name of Nepean was afterwards given by the Governor.</p>
<p>Captain Tench describes the latter river as being nearly as broad as the
Thames at Putney. "From its banks," wrote Phillip in February, 1790, "I hope to
reach the mountains, which has been attempted by a party who crossed the river,
but after the first day's journey they met with a constant succession of deep
ravines...so that they returned, not having been able to proceed more than
fifteen miles in five days; when they turned back they supposed themselves to
be twelve miles from the foot of the mountains."[*]</p>
<blockquote>[* Governor Phillip's letter, 1790, " Historical Records of New
South Wales."]</blockquote>
<p>The party Phillip refers to as having "crossed the river" was one under the
command of Lieutenant William Dawes, who in December, 1789, got across the
Nepean and unsuccessfully tried to reach the ranges. Captain Tench says that
"at the time they turned back they were further inland than <i>any other
Persons ever were before or since</i>--being 54 miles in a direct line from the
coast--when on the summit of Mount Twiss--a hill so named by them which bounded
their peregrination."[*]</p>
<blockquote>[* "A Complete Account of the Settlement, etc.," Watkin Tench,
1793.]</blockquote>
<p>On August, 1790, Dawes and Tench together started on another expedition;
they took with them a strong escort and spent a week penetrating in a
south-south-west direction "bounding their course at a remarkable hill," to
which, says Tench, from its conical shape we gave the name of Pyramid
Hill."</p>
<p>Some short excursions were undertaken towards the close of 1790, and a
little later, on April 11, 1791, Governor Phillip himself again led an
exploring expedition inland. Dawes, Tench, and Collins accompanied him, and
included in the party, which numbered nineteen persons, were two Sydney
natives.</p>
<p>Every man except the Governor carried his own knapsack, which contained
provisions for ten days...and every man was garbed to drag through morasses,
tear through thickets, ford rivers, and scale rocks." The advance was first
directed to the north-west, and two days after leaving Rosehill they reached
the river. Tench says they then "turned to the right hand" and traversed a
creek, until on the 13th they came to a little hill, from which they had a good
view to the westward. The Governor called this eminence "Tench's Prospect
Hill." On the 14th, on leaving it, they retraced their steps to the river,
passing over country which "excepting for the last half mile was a continued
bed of stones in some places so thick that they looked like a pavement."</p>
<p>Although Captain Phillip cannot be said to have actually made any further
discoveries, a good deal of general information concerning the inland parts was
obtained in this expedition. He ascertained that the Nepean was an affluent of
the Hawkesbury; he observed the windings of the various branches of the river
and the places that ought to be avoided by future explorers, and he also had
opportunities for noting the customs of the inland natives; one old man gave an
exhibition of his powers in climbing trees which is described as being "the
finest display the Governor had ever seen."</p>
<h4>CAPTAIN PATERSON AND OTHERS</h4>
<p>On September, 1793, Captain Paterson, of the New South Wales Corps, led an
expedition into the mountains. He was accompanied by Captain Johnston, Mr.
Palmer, Mr. Laing, and a strong escort of soldiers, among whom were some
Highlanders, who, like Paterson, were accustomed to Scottish hills. Boats were
sent round to Broken Bay, whence they entered the Hawkesbury and on the fourth
day reached Richmond Hill. At this place in 1789 Governor Phillip's progress up
the river had been obstructed by a waterfall which his boats could not pass
over. Paterson overcame the difficulty by leaving his large boats and
proceeding with two that were smaller and lighter. He found the river carried
him westward and that the navigation was very intricate; a new river, however,
which ran through a huge ravine, was discovered and named the Grose (in honour
of Major Grose), and up this Paterson took his boats.</p>

<h4>MAP COMMUNICATED BY COLONEL PATERSON (IT SHOWS BASS'S ROUTE INTOTHE
INTERIOR FROM MOUNT HUNTER)</h4>
</center>
<p>The termination of his journey was at a large rocky precipice which received
the name of Canopy Cliff. This cliff faced the junction of the Grose with a
smaller stream, the Grose flowing east and the stream west of the cliff. A high
peak of land seen by Paterson at this point was named Harrington Peak. From
Canopy Cliff to its junction with the Nepean he found the Grose River to
descend in falls and rapids about 400 feet. But the party could not continue
their exploration, since one of the boats had loosened a plank and the other
had been driven upon a stump, so Paterson gave up further progress, "leaving
the western mountains to be the object of future discovery." He reached Sydney
on September 22nd, and in writing an account of his expedition to a friend at
home he says: "From an accident that happened to our boats, we returned after a
journey of ten days and got about 10 miles nearer them (the mountains) than
former travellers."[*]</p>
<blockquote>[* Unpublished letter to Forsyth. In this letter Paterson speaks of
a second expedition he was about to take into the mountains.]</blockquote>
<p>"Captain Paterson," remarks Collins, who relates the story of his
journey,[*] "was amply rewarded for his labour and disappointment by
discovering several new plants." He saw but few natives, and believed that
their arms and legs were longer than those of the coast natives." As they live
by climbing trees ... it might perhaps have been occasioned by the custom of
hanging by their arms and resting their feet at the utmost stretch of the
body..."</p>
<blockquote>[* Collins's " Account of Colony of New South Wales."]</blockquote>
<p>Following Paterson's exploit, attempts were unsuccessfully made by different
people, among whom were Hacking, Dr. Bass, and Wilson, to find a pass through
the ranges. Wilson's terminal point "may be regarded as being on the hillside
overlooking the Wollondilly at Bullio."[*] Perhaps the most difficult task was
that undertaken by Bass, of whom it is said that he used iron boat-hooks on his
hands and feet in climbing down the steep sides of the rocks, and, when stopped
by ravines, caused himself to be lowered by ropes, but, after fifteen days of
danger and fatigue, he returned to Sydney without achieving success. On an old
map at the British Museum communicated by Colonel Paterson is an inscription
which perhaps tells best what Bass actually did. It runs as follows: "In this
direction[*] Mr. Bass's party went 28 miles from Mount Hunter--beyond that the
mountains were impassable; soil good for the first 18 miles."</p>
<blockquote>[* R. H. Cambage: " journal of the R.A.H.Soc."]</blockquote>
<blockquote>[** i.e. westerly from Mount Hunter.]</blockquote>
<h4>ENSIGN BARRALLIER</h4>
<p>Ensign Barrallier, New South Wales Corps, was the next to make a notable
expedition into the ranges. In 1802, in order to obtain leave of absence for
him from his military duties so that he might lead the expedition, Governor
King claimed him as his aide-de-camp, and sent him "on a fictitious embassy to
the king of the mountains."</p>
<p>Barrallier first made a preliminary excursion and crossed the Nepean with a
party of four men to find out the best route by which to proceed later. He
journeyed "as far as about 45 miles," where he chose a site for a depo~t at a
place called Nattai by natives and discovered the river still known as the
Nattai River, then he returned to Sydney, and having received his final orders
from the Governor went first to Parramatta and then to Prospect. Taking his
departure from the latter place with a party which consisted of nine persons
besides himself and a native from Cowpastures named Gogy, he crossed the Nepean
on November 6, 1802, at a ford called Binheny by the natives. Here it was found
impossible for the bullock wagon laden with provisions to get over the river
and the bullocks had to be unyoked, and finally the provisions, as well as the
wagon itself, had to be carried by the men to the opposite bank. Once all were
safely across Barrallier directed his route to the south-west[*] and spent the
night near a swamp called by the natives Baraggel. Here some rare shells were
discovered. Next day, November 7th, he passed Menangle. In the lagoon were fish
and eels of enormous size, more of which were found at Carabeely, another
stretch of water and swamp, and near the latter the men killed a kangaroo.
Barrallier here came upon a herd of wild cattle and counted 162 "peaceably
pasturing.'' They were descendants of the six landed by Phillip in 1788 which
through their keeper's neglect had strayed into the bush more than fourteen
years before to live and multiply in freedom.</p>
<blockquote>[* After passing Menangle his route took him near the spot where
Picton now stands.]</blockquote>
<p>On catching sight of the party the beasts advanced as if to attack the men
and had to be driven off. A second herd and a third were seen, also the body of
a bull "of a reddish colour with white spots" lying in a ditch, below a terrace
conjectured by Barrallier to have been "the battle-field of the bulls." Two
natives were met on this day where the party halted for dinner. One of these, a
"mountaineer" whose name they made out to be Bungin,[*] was very shy and wore a
curious mantle of skins of various animals sewn together. The other, whose name
was Wooglemai--i.e. in native language, one-eyed--was friendly and knew Gogy
the native from the Cowpastures and apparently had visited Parramatta and
Prospect. The explorers, continuing their journey at 5.30 p.m., encamped for
the night near a running stream on territory belonging to the mountaineer, who
in return for kindness shown him built a hut for Barrallier and next day
attached himself to the party. Two miles from this place "a chain of mountains
was visible, the direction of which," says Barrallier, "is inclined towards the
south."</p>
<blockquote>[* Barrallier writes: "Bungin was an inhabitant of the south, and
had left the Canambaigle tribe because they wanted to kill him."--Diary of
Ensign F. Barrallier, "Historical Records of New South Wales,"Vol.
V.]</blockquote>
<p>Continuing their advance on November 8th the men crossed several creeks and
late in the afternoon, after traversing a plain, entered rocky country and
reached a valley where they spent the night. At this time they were four miles
from Nattai. On the morning of the 9th the silence was broken by the sound of
"cooees" in the distance, and shortly afterwards two mountain natives were
brought into the camp. One had never seen white people before and was terrified
when Barrallier offered to shake hands with him.</p>
<p>On the same morning the exploring party, advancing again over rough country,
"all covered with stones and brush," arrived at Nattai,[*] and Barrallier
decided, before starting on his journey into the mountains, to send for a fresh
supply of provisions. Three men, accompanied by the native Wooglemai, went back
next morning with the wagon to the settlement. They did not return until the
19th, and during the interval Barrallier with some of his party carried out
some short explorations. He followed a creek[**] which ran between mountains to
the Nattai River, the terminus of his first journey. Tracing the river on its
left bank, he came on November 11th to the junction of the two rivers, the
Nattai and the Wollondilly.</p>
<blockquote>[* About six miles north-west of the town of
Thirlmere.]</blockquote>
<blockquote>[** Shea's Creek, Barrallier's route to R. Cambage--" Journal,
R.A.H.Soc., Vol. III.]</blockquote>
<p>In the evening he arrived at a valley where he camped for the night.[*] In
describing his journey on the 12th he says he passed through another chain of
isolated mountains which might be nearly four miles in length and sighted on
the right "the great range, the height of which is more and more considerable
", the soil of the country everywhere was very rich; "the hills...covered with
kangaroos, which resembled a flock of goats grazing peaceably."[**] He sowed
pumpkin seeds and an apricot stone at the foot of a mountain, where he also
noticed prints of natives. Observing a mountain which "though high[***]
appeared easy of access he climbed it, but could not gain its summit, being
stopped by a barrier of rocks-projecting outwards-in the shape of vaults."
Proceeding onwards he met with some strange natives, from whom it was difficult
to elicit any information regarding the mountains and who afterwards showed
signs of hostility to some of the party. On the 13th he returned to the
depo~t.</p>
<blockquote>[* Burragorang Valley.]</blockquote>
<blockquote>[** "Historical Records of New South Wales," Vol. V.]</blockquote>
<blockquote>[*** Identified by R. Cambage. ("Journal R.A.H.Soc.," Vol. III) as
South Peak, and "is an outline...in the extreme southern end of a small
chain...known as the Peaks...the sandstone rocks of which the peaks are
composed extend back north-westerly, forming the southern watershed of the
Tonalli and are called the Tonalli Range."]</blockquote>
<p>After the return of the wagon Barrallier started on a longer and more
important journey into the ranges. On November 22nd he left the dep~ot, taking
with him five of his strongest men and some natives with sufficient provisions
for one month. He travelled through a precipitous gorge (S. 75&deg; W.) by a
route which he had already pursued, crossed the Nattai River near which he had
"cut some huts," and on November 23rd arrived at the junction of the two
rivers, Nattai and Wollondilly. Here he met several strange natives, including
a chief named Goondel. who conversed with some of the members of his party.</p>
<p>On November 24th, having passed at noon the mountain he had tried to climb
on the occasion of his first journey,[*] and having crossed difficult bushy
country, "going over hills which stood in all directions," he arrived about
four o'clock at the top of a hill where he was able to observe that "the
direction of the chain of mountains extended itself north-westwardly to a
distance which I estimated to be 30 miles and which turned abruptly at right
angles.[**] It formed a barrier nearly N. and S. which it was necessary to
climb over."</p>
<blockquote>[* South Peak, according to R. Cambage]</blockquote>
<blockquote>[** Tonalli Range.]</blockquote>
<p>At seven o'clock he reached the summit of another hill,[*] whence he
descried three openings: "the first on the right towards N. 59&deg;30' W.; the
one in front of me and which appeared very large was west from me; and the
third S. 35&deg;0' W." The sight of these openings filled the party with
encouragement.[**] Their spirits had flagged in the course of the day, for the
range of mountains which they had passed over was covered with big granite
stones which had made the route very laborious.</p>
<blockquote>[* Alum Hill, according to R. Cambage.]</blockquote>
<blockquote>[** The three openings by Barrallier have been identified as
follows: The northern opening just south of Mount Colong and at the head of a
creek which flows into Colony Creek. The centre one due west of Woolshed, the
third that through which the Bindook track passes. (See R.
Cambage.)]</blockquote>
<p>The trees were blue gum and iron-bark of medium height; and a number of
rivulets were passed. The total. distance covered by Barrallier up to this date
is given as 100 1/2 miles. Naturally the distance measured "as the crow
flies"[*] was not nearly so great; but Barrallier had to take a zigzag course
over the mountains, and his men were sometimes compelled to travel two or three
times as far as they might have gone had a direct route been possible.</p>
<blockquote>[* Barrallier's route is shown upon Oxley's maps and also upon a
map of New South Wales by J. Cross, 1827, corrected to 1829 and dedicated to J.
Oxley.]</blockquote>
<p>On November 25th at noon Barrallier reached a large stream, where he halted
for dinner. Its current was very rapid and its bed was filled with granite
stones. He crossed some hills, their direction being north and south, climbed a
very steep height, and at six o clock discovered a cave large enough to contain
twenty men, and he says he was then only half a mile from "the western
passage." He sent two men "to discover it" and "to ascend the mountain at the
N. of this Passage," while he waited in the cave for them, On their return they
"related that after passing the range that was in front of us we would enter an
immense plain, that from the height where they were standing on the mountain
they had caught sight of only a few hills standing here and there in this
plain, and that the country in front of them had the appearance of a meadow."
Much elated with the news, Barrallier continued his march at nightfall and
arrived at the mouth of a passage half a mile wide, formed by a perpendicular
cut in the mountains (the profiles of which were of immense height), and he now
writes with certainty about his discovery of a pass through them:</p>
<p>"I sent men to try and find the trees...for the building of our huts. This
work was completed...and after every one was sheltered, they congratulated
themselves with having succeeded in accomplishing the passage of the Blue
Mountains without accident."</p>
<p>On November 26th, at daybreak, Barrallier set out, taking two men with him,
"to verify by myself the configuration of the ground and to ascertain whether
the passage of the Blue Mountains had really been effected. I climbed the chain
of mountains north from us, and when I had reached the middle of this height
the view of a plain as vast as eye could reach confirmed the report of the
previous day."</p>
<p>To his sorrow, on this day, while trying to get through to the level
country, Barrallier found an unforeseen impediment in some hills that formed a
barrier. He followed a creek, and then discovered a fast flowing river[*]
between two chains of very high mountains. Turning northwards he reached the
river at its junction with a large stream,[*] and in crossing it he and his men
met with many dangerous obstacles.</p>
<blockquote>[* Identified as the Kowmung River.]</blockquote>
<blockquote>[* Christy's Creek, probably Waterfall Creek.]</blockquote>
<p>On the 27th so many barriers were encountered that on the 28th Barrallier
was compelled to abandon the expedition. "After having cut a cross of St.
Andrew on a tree to indicate the terminus of my second journey," he tells us he
turned homeward and following the line of his outward track back to Nattai,
reached the depo~t at 8.30 p.m. of December 2nd.</p>
<p>It will be seen that Barrallier had good reason to claim that he had crossed
the Blue Mountains,[*] although the colonists do not seem to have benefited in
any way from his arduous travels. Either he was unable to define his route
clearly upon his map, or else the details he could furnish were too meagre to
be of any use as a guide to explorers; but it is certain that a passage through
the mountains remained undiscovered. Cambage writes: "The terminal point
reached by this courageous explorer was...towards the head of Christy's Creek
about 15 or 16 miles in a direct line southerly. from the Jenolan Caves," and
he adds: "It is remarkable that Barrallier should have followed so far down the
Kowmung before turning to the left, for had he turned up the river instead of
down he would probably have succeeded in crossing the Great Dividing Range,
after which he would have had no difficulty in proceeding westward."</p>
<blockquote>[* R. H. Cambage," R.A.H.Soc.'s Journal," Vol. III.]</blockquote>
<blockquote>CAYLEY'S REPULSE</blockquote>
<p>Barrallier's successor as an explorer of the Blue Mountains was George
Caley, who in 1800 came to Sydney primarily to collect plants for Sir Joseph
Banks, but who interested himself also in matters concerning the welfare of the
colony. Soon after his arrival he was made superintendent of the Government
Garden, which had been marked out at Parramatta, and from time to time
dispatched boxes of Plants and seeds to England in charge of the captains of
different ships voyaging homewards. So carefully did he classify his
collections, and so skilfully arrange them, that he was called "Botanicus
peritus et accuratus" by Robert Brown, who named the <i>Banksia Caleyi</i> in
his honour.</p>
<p>Caley soon found opportunities to make excursions inland, going at first
only short distances. In October, 1801, with two companions, he left Prospect,
crossed a chain of hills called the Devil's Back, where the Cabramatta Creek
takes its rise, and arrived at the Nepean. This river Caley prefers to call the
Hawkesbury, saying that "it is the principal branch and ought to have that
name." Encamping near its banks, during the night he and his companions heard
the noise of the wild cattle, and next day went in quest of them. They took a
south-easterly course--having crossed the river on a fallen tree--but failed to
come up with the herd, though they saw at the head of a marshy flat the body of
a dead bull, probably of the Cape breed. Soon afterwards they returned to
Prospect.</p>
<p>A few months later, with two others, Caley traced the course of Tench's
River, and, being only familiar with English rivers, was struck with its deep
bed and high, perpendicular banks, with trees growing on either side, which he
described as "melancholy <i>Casuarinae.</i>"</p>
<p>In March, 1802, he was particularly energetic and on the 9th started on a
short tour which lasted five days, but of which he has left but few
particulars. On the 26th he set off again from Parramatta, in company with one
man, and with his mare laden with provisions, to visit Mount Hunter. Striking
out on a south-west-by-south course, they travelled for eighteen miles and came
to "a flat piece of ground called Arayling by the natives," five miles from
which they arrived at the Nepean. There they had to take the baggage off the
mare and carry it themselves over the river, an operation which Caley says,
"took us nearly up to the neck in some places...The water was very cold and the
current strong...the bottom inclined to quicksand." They afterwards swam their
horse across and reached Mount Hunter on the 28th.</p>
<p>The ascent was steep and difficult, owing to shrubs impeding their path.
From it Caley obtained a fine view of the Blue Mountains, which he resolved to
explore, observing a little prematurely that "they did not deserve the name of
mountains." He defined them merely as "high hills," though he admitted that "to
the northward they may be more rocky," from which it is evident that he did not
catch sight of the naked rocks forming bastions round them or the deep gorges
lying hidden between the "high hills." A little later, when he attempted to
fight his way across them, he altered his opinion that they were hills, and
bestowed upon them the title of mountains.</p>
<p>We read in his diary that in October, 1802, he made another short journey
from Prospect with two companions--possibly the same two as before--and, taking
"a direct W.S.W. by S. course," came to the Nepean. Having passed over the
river, they travelled through forest land, and arrived "at the foot of a hill
(Blue Mountains)," to the summit of one of which they climbed.</p>
<p>In December of the same year Caley twice crossed and recrossed the Nepean in
an expedition undertaken for the purpose of defining the true course of the
river, for at that time some of its windings were not yet filled in upon the
maps in use in the colony. He left Prospect on December 4th, accompanied by a
friend, and took his mare laden with sufficient provisions for an extended
tour. The party set out on a west-south-west-by-south course, and first arrived
at the Great Creek,[*] where they fell in with a number of natives. That day
they forded the Nepean at a part of the river which Caley does not seem to have
seen before, as he says he found that it trended north and north-west.</p>
<blockquote>[* South Creek.]</blockquote>
<p>After leaving its banks, they travelled a short distance and "got on to the
hills (Blue Mountains)"and pushed their way along them for three miles through
a dense thicket which at last compelled them to turn back. In their return
journey they met with another river, which was probably that now known as Mount
Hunter rivulet, for they had only proceeded a short distance from it when he
remarks: "This place I thought I had seen before in my journey to Mount
Hunter."</p>
<p>On his return to the Nepean, Caley recrossed it, but did not go back to
Prospect, though he says that he looked for that place from the brink of the
hills, but could not clearly see it, the weather being hazy. He writes:
"We...crossed the Hawkesbury River at the end of the hills...that seemed to be
rent asunder for a passage for it, which I propose to call Dovedale, from its
grand and romantic appearance." From Dovedale, so named after the well-known
valley in Derbyshire, Caley made his way to Bagalin, "the place I was bound
for, this being at another part of the river. Here he halted. He could see a
large vale from Bagalin, and, believing that the river flowed through it to the
south-cast, he resolved to explore it with the view of finding the head of the
river.</p>
<p>Setting out on this second journey, Caley and his companions crossed the
Nepean at a known part of the river where it had been already surveyed, and
possibly at a short distance from where Barrallier had forded it a month
before.[*] They then directed their course south-by-east three miles, and
pitched their tent at a swampy place, the name of which, as they learned from
natives, was Menangle. The natives also told Caley in answer to his questions
that the river did not run through the vale he wanted to find, and that he
would be unable to take his mare over the rocks to it.</p>
<blockquote>[* This ford was North of Bird's Eye Corner: another ford over the
Nepean was known as Emu Ford, and another Cowpasture Ford.]</blockquote>
<p>During his short stay there a heavy thunderstorm took place, and he allowed
four natives to take shelter under his "painted sheet" or tent. Leaving
Menangle he travelled to the south-west, and then traced his former course
south-by-east and came almost at once upon the river "deeply seated in a
narrow, rocky valley with almost perpendicular sides." He followed it for a
quarter of a mile and found that its course ran first south-south-east, a turn
north-north-east, then east-north-east. About four miles from Menangle he
halted at a place where there was good water and plenty of grass for the mare.
It was a very picturesque spot and he named it Ripponden--a name that has since
disappeared from the maps.</p>

PLAINS AND THE TRACK TAKEN BY EVANS WHEN HE FOLLOWED BLAXLAND, WENTWORTH AND
LAWSON'S ROUTE ACROSS THE BLUE MOUNTAINS</h4>
</center>
<p>Still anxious to find the river's true course, he travelled north-north-west
over some hills and came to Poppy Brook, so called (by him) because wild
poppies were found growing there. Poppy Brook was a small stream of clear water
flowing over a bed of small black stones, similar to those he had often seen in
brooks in England. It is the Stone Quarry Creek of Barrallier,[*] whose name
for it survives, and takes its rise in the high land west of Picton.</p>
<blockquote>[* In early maps of New South Wales by Arrowsmith (communicated by
Lieut-Colonel Paterson and also upon Oxley's map) Poppy Brook and Stone Quarry
Creek are shown as different streams. Apparently Governor King identified them
as the same stream.]</blockquote>
<p>The tracks of wagon wheels told Caley that Barrallier had been there before
him, and the natives at Menangle had related that "at Nayti, the furthermost
outpost reached by him, he had built a bark hut." Caley remarks that he had
already heard from Governor King that "Barrallier had been 150 miles in the
country," where "he had fixed stations," and says also that the Governor had
pointed out one of these to him, "which I understood was 50 miles S.S.W. from
Prospect and called by the natives Natta, but which I now learn is Nayti," and
he adds, "with that I endeavoured to find it."</p>
<p>Crossing Poppy Brook, Caley first proceeded to the south-west and
west-south-west without any success: he then turned south-south-west and
discovered a sheet of water or lagoon which he called Scirpus Mere; some
beautiful plants were growing not far from this lagoon, and where the thicket
was densest he found a species of <i>Persoonia</i> with sweet-scented flowers
and pubescent leaves. Seeing no signs of Barrallier's depo~t, and having lost
all traces of his wagon wheels, he went to "another range to the eastward," but
still not finding Nayti returned to Poppy Brook. On leaving this stream a
second time Caley struck a course for four miles to the north-north-east, and
at the end of the fourth mile arrived at a spot called by the natives Murdogra,
"which being a low, flat piece of ground without any trees growing upon it, its
green verdure had a pleasant appearance in a country where all was forest."
Here he stayed the night and saw, at about a mile distant from his camp, the
smoke of native fires. He continued to search for Nayti, but could not find it,
though he was convinced, from what the natives had said, that it was at no
great distance.</p>
<p>At this time the party fell in with wild cattle, but "not in a herd; in
general two bulls and at the most six, were seen together." Some of them had
humps between their shoulders, though "it is said that there was not a humped
one among them when they ran away," and Caley remarks: "Many people are of the
opinion that the natives kill them, but...the natives told me that when the
cattle see them they immediately run at them and they are obliged to climb up
the trees." Turning back next day, after a tour of nine days, Caley returned to
Prospect.</p>
<p>In addition to making sea voyages to different parts of the coast in search
of botanical subjects, we find Caley a year or so later again touring inland.
In 1804 he set out on an excursion to the territory which he called Vaccary
Forest (the Cowpastures), to ascertain the extent of its boundaries. His diary
of this journey is enlightening. We learn that it was then conjectured in
Sydney that the wild cattle which had so long pastured in Vaccary Forest were
now beginning to roam farther into the country and it was feared that they
would altogether forsake the tracks they had frequented hitherto. A large party
of horse and foot indeed had been sent to drive them if possible into "a very
strong fenced yard newly made...for this purpose," but "this scheme or rather
chase ended...with running one or two cows down."</p>
<p>It had been usual since the days of Captain Hunter for the governors and
officers to take visitors to the colony on excursions to the Cowpastures to
hunt the wild cattle, although it was found no easy matter to single one out of
the herd. Caley believed these excursions would become even more frequent,
owing to the fact that "the trees had been marked all the way there, a track
being visible and a small house built" for the hunting parties. Still at that
time little was known with respect to the boundaries of these pastures, and
Caley therefore proposed to make a complete survey of them. Loading up his mare
with provisions he left Parramatta accompanied by his manservant and went on
February 11th to Prospect, whence the party took their departure. They encamped
for the night at the side of some small ponds, around which there was young
grass growing, and set off early on the morning of the 12th to the Nepean,
arriving at the river about noon. Before they reached it they "discovered
Cowpasture House seated in a bushy place on this side of the river."[*] The
grass all round it and even close up to it had been burnt, but it had escaped
injury. "It was," says Caley, "no more than a small hut built of boards,
thatched with grass, and a wooden chimney. We saw in the house a cask
containing a quantity of salt which had been carried there to salt beef."</p>
<blockquote>[* The principal station was at Cawdor, where a dwelling-house was
erected...afterwards used as a cowhouse.--W.R.G., "Saturday
Magazine."</blockquote>
<p>The men got over the river easily, the water being low; a little further
down they noticed a fallen tree had been thrown across it for the purpose of a
bridge. They found its banks crowded with trees, chiefly <i>casuarinae.</i> On
leaving their crossingplace, Caley bore away to Menangle, where he pitched his
tent. The lake was now reduced to a very small compass, as the weather for so
long had been hot and dry. On the following day he went back to the log bridge
and recrossed the river in search of a pond where he expected to find some rare
plants; but, to his surprise, it had entirely dried up. In making his way back
to the camp he heard a voice--not that of a native, but of a white man calling;
and, as "some desperate runaways were known to infest that quarter," he was
careful to make preparations for an attack.</p>
<p>Four months before he had accompanied Mr. Robert Brown to Mount Hunter, and
when upon the mount they had heard two men "hallooing" who evidently had lost
each other, and Caley says: "By our halloaing in return one of them was decoyed
to within a few rods of us, but as soon as he got the first sight, immediately
fled." Although Caley did not actually see anyone on this occasion, he resolved
to be very much on his guard, but says he did not think he would be "easily
overcome even by an armed banditti."</p>
<p>Leaving Menangle, he went to Ripponden, which he had visited in 1802. From
there he proceeded in the direction of Poppy Brook. On the way he saw a beaten
cattle track, along which he travelled, and presently came upon a large herd of
cattle lying down, which quickly sprang up and each one stared at the party
"with fierce visage." A young dog that Caley had with him soon put them to
flight. There were fifty-three in the herd, and they made off towards the
river.</p>
<p>Caley then met with a small brook which he had seen before (possibly in
December, 1802), to which he now gave the name of Little Brook. He continued in
the direction of Poppy Brook, and noticed as he went how much the road was
travelled between there and Ripponden. "Being an important one," he says, "I
have called it London Road."</p>
<p>In the region of Poppy Brook, where he and his servant encamped, Caley
decided to begin his survey, "at the termination of the range where I began my
S.S.W. course in the discovery of Scirpus Mere." He set out next day on his old
track to carry out this intention, when he heard a voice through the brushwood,
and shortly after "a native came running to me and called me by my name...He
informed me there was a large party Walbunga," which meant "catching kangaroos
by setting the place on fire, and by [the blacks] placing themselves in the
direction the animal is forced to pass and by throwing spears at it as it
passes along."</p>
<p>In further conversation with his black friend Caley learned that there were
strange blacks from the mountains among the party of natives, and that one
visitor was no other than the famous Cannabygal, or Cannamikel, a chief much
dreaded by the other tribes. At last Caley prevailed upon the native to "cooee"
for the others so that he might see the strange blacks, and "a large party came
running towards us and by the place being brushy they were upon us before they
well saw who we were." Some of the natives evidently had seen Caley from their
hiding-places on a former expedition, for he writes: "I perceived a deal more
knew me than I could recognize...My man noticing a few...behind a tree I
immediately went up to them and inquired for Cannabygal and...one man clapped
his hands upon his breast and gave me to understand he was the person."</p>
<p>Of this early meeting with the mountain natives Caley gives the following
account: "I singled out the chief of the party[*] I was known to and opened a
familiar conversation. During that time all the rest were in a profound
silence...The strangers were four in number, three men and one woman; the men
were without any clothing except a belt to fix the mogo in; the woman had a
kind of cloak upon her back made of skins of animals but which did not conceal
her nakedness...They were of gigantic stature in comparison with the rest;
their hair being long and their features in general gave them a frightful
countenance, though I must own that Cannabygal had something pleasant in his
face while I was conversing with him. None of the four ever had seen a white
man before. They had a large domesticated native dog with them."</p>
<blockquote>[* Evidently a Cowpasture native to interpret for
him.]</blockquote>
<p>Caley shot a bird to show the power of his fire-arms and gave it to them,
and they were much surprised that they could not discover any wounds. At last,
he says, finding that his absence was more wished for than his company, he
informed them he was about to depart. They at once pointed out to him the exact
direction which they desired him to take, and his native friend acquainted him
with the fact that several women belonging to the mountaineers' party were
stationed near by and that therefore he must be careful not to alarm them.
Caley gave a promise that he would go in the direction pointed out, and kept
his word. This obliged him to go a little way out of his course, but he says
that the distance was "too trivial" to be noted on his map. The Cowpasture
natives had informed him that the strangers were cannibals, but this he
doubted. He asked the natives several questions respecting the source of the
Hawkesbury and they pointed to the south-east; when he inquired as to the
whereabouts of Nayti they pointed west-by-north.</p>
<p>It was probably at this meeting and from these mountain natives that Caley
obtained the information concerning the unknown interior which afterwards in a
letter to Mr. Robert Brown he claimed to have possessed. He said in it that he
had heard from the natives that there was a great river inland and a plain
above the trees, and that "the mountain natives who came at times to the
outskirts of the colony had their heads covered with emu feathers."</p>
<p>After parting from the natives and their guests Caley and his man sought
their former track. They ascended a steep hill to get to a higher and more
backward range, and "fell in with a herd of cattle which had taken the road we
were going, but before we got on to it they returned...the dog close at their
heels; seeing them in a state of confusion I was beginning to clear the way for
them. However, I had the satisfaction of seeing them keep on the range...Some
decayed fallen trees they leaped over like hunters, and there was a noise made
by the rattling of horns such as I had never heard."</p>
<p>A cow fell behind and lay down, evidently unable to move, so Caley went up
to her but could render no assistance, for at the sight of him she became so
much frightened that he says "it was only tormenting her more." He regretted
being unable to shoot her and put her out of pain on account "of His
Excellency's Proclamation forbidding the like," adding: "I could not ease my
mind at having to leave the poor animal thus, and resolved if I should visit
this part again I would know whether she had quitted it."[*]</p>
<blockquote>[* Caley heard afterwards that a lame red cow always followed the
herd in this manner and concluded that she might not have been badly
hurt.]</blockquote>
<p>He and his man continued "to rise upon the range," and saw a great bush-fire
at the spot where they had lately left the natives. At length they got to the
farthest end of the range, where, Caley says, "I now began to trace the western
boundaries of these pastures."</p>
<p>He thus describes a small valley with some ponds of water and good grass
which he thought suitable for a station: "The place we had chosen to pass the
night by its greenness had a pleasant appearance...It was rocky in places...The
cattle came here for water...This is the place I have called Green Dingle." On
first coming there Caley believed himself fortunate to find such a pleasant
camp, but shortly afterwards he rather regretted having chosen it for a
resting-place, as the voices of natives were heard close at hand, from which it
was evident that the blacks had followed them and were only hidden from them by
a turn in the valley. Warning his man to keep very quiet he made preparations
to resist them, "as I could not tell in what manner they would act." At night
Caley took care to keep up a very small fire, concealing it and their tent with
bushes so that they should not be seen by the natives. He writes: "We could
hear them making a loud noise as if they were dancing and making merry...When
they became silent we went to sleep...and fixed our gun in such a position as
to have nothing to do...than pulling the trigger on our being suddenly
awakened."</p>
<p>Next morning Caley and his man rose early and breakfasted before daybreak.
After loading the mare with their baggage they went towards the black fellows'
camp, but already they had left it and were upon the march. Caley followed
them, wishing to see Cannabygal again, but writes: "He kept out of my
presence...My man being eager to get a view of the women kept following them
with the mare; by so doing he put them in a fright and they screamed
loudly...and on my taking hold of the halter to pull the mare round some of the
natives hit her with their spears and being high mettled she began to caper...I
was afraid I should give offence and create hostilities, but...happily the
whole ended in a joke." Some of the Cowpasture natives escorted Caley for some
distance after parting with the mountain natives, and he says that when
Cannabygal and his companions were out of sight "the others burst into fits of
laughter and were highly delighted by their being so frightened on seeing white
people." Caley had noticed that they themselves were "as mute as mice" when the
mountain natives were present, and he adds, "The strangers are greatly dreaded
and reverenced, particularly Cannabygal, who according to superstition is
invincible and more than mortal."</p>
<p>Continuing his examination of the boundaries of the Cowpastures from Green
Dingle on a westerly course, he found some extensive cattle tracts, "the
largest running N.N.W., which the party followed and came to a creek named by
him Brush Creek. From this creek he traced the northern confines of the
Cowpastures. On returning to Sydney he gave an account of his travels to the
Governor, who in his remarks[*] upon Caley's observations says that "By Caley's
journey and chart he makes the extent of the ground frequented by the wild
cattle...about 11 miles in the north and south direction and about 8 in the
widest direction from east to west."</p>
<blockquote>[* "Historical Records of New South Wales," Vol. V.]</blockquote>
<p>These short expeditions were the forerunners of exploration of a much bolder
character undertaken with the object of trying to find a pass over the
mountains. It was in November, 1804, that Caley first tried to cross them,
having been provided by the Governor with four of the strongest men in the
colony to assist him. On Saturday, November 3rd, taking a boat up the river,
the party landed "at the upper part of Richmond Terrace with the intention of
travelling to the Carmarthen Mountains; but between them and their goal
stretched ranges of hills which had to be traversed before it could be won."
Being resolved to keep clear of the Grose, Caley shaped his course to the
west-north-west. He had gone only a short distance, however, before he was
confronted with deep valleys and rocky precipices, some of which rose to a
height of over 1,000 feet; and wherever a level track was found it was equally
difficult to travel over, the ground being covered with impenetrable bush.</p>
<p>In spite of these obstacles in his path he continued to advance slowly, and
on the 5th from a hillside obtained a fine view of the hills he was trying to
gain; but he describes himself as "thunderstruck with the roughness of the
country that presented itself between them and us." He went higher up the hill
in order to be able to determine the best route to take, and, after scanning
the country resolved to steer as straight for the Carmarthen Mountains as the
roughness of the country would permit. He proceeded down the side of a valley,
and descended it where it was joined by another valley in which there was a
swamp. The valley was surrounded by high-topped trees, and the greenness of the
swamp gave the place a most beautiful appearance; Caley named it Swamp Valley.
The men traversed it by marching sometimes in the valley and sometimes on the
edge of the hills. They then crossed the swamp and halted at the north end of
the valley, where Caley mounted a hill in order to take bearings and to find
out how far they were from the Grose, and "ere long was favoured with a view of
Grose's Head," about seven miles distant. He there caught sight of an
increasing volume of smoke rising from the spot where they had encamped, and,
hurrying to it, found his men in great consternation owing to one of them while
kindling a fire having set the bush alight. The flames burned furiously and
spread among the dead trees so rapidly that for a time the party were in
considerable danger.</p>
<p>Leaving Swamp Valley, Caley travelled on the following courses:
west-north-west, south-west, west-south-west, and west-by-south, and at length,
at the end of the last course, he got another view of the Carmarthen Hills. He
next turned west-1/2-south obliquely into a valley which came from the
northeast, its waters running to the south-west. Here he found plants similar
to those around Sydney. Directing his courses for the most part in a
south-westerly direction, he crossed three more valleys, all of which emptied
their waters to the south-west. The last one, which was very deep, with a steep
and difficult descent into it, Caley called Dark Valley. Fortunately the
weather was fine and on this day he caught sight of some lories,</p>
<p>On December 7th a very fine morning broke, and the party started on a
south-west course, and after ascending a hill advanced along a range until they
arrived at the brink of a valley which came from the northward. Its sides
appeared perpendicular; its depth was about 300 yards, its width nearly a mile,
and Caley says: "I was at a loss to know how to cross this deep valley, which
seemed to bid defiance to man." At length he found a place where by holding on
to the bushes and small shrub-like trees he was able to make a partial descent
and creep along the edge of the rocks. The luggage was lowered by making a rope
of twine, and handed on from one man to another over the rocks. Having so far
got safely down, Caley determined not to cross the valley but to proceed down
to the Grose, which "was joined by another valley that came from the S.W."
Eventually he came suddenly upon the Grose, but was forced to return, "for the
rocks formed perpendicular sides apparently to the water's edge." After trying
unsuccessfully to advance, first at one place and then at another, he says at
last he had "only the northern valley to make choice of." He hastened to it
again and his men were at last able to make their descent a little above the
union of the northern valley with that which came from the south-west. Fine
streams ran through these two valleys, which, after uniting, took a course to
the eastward.</p>
<p>In giving an account of his adventures here Caley writes:</p>
<p>"The dreary appearance, abruptness, and intricate and dangerous route
experienced at this place induced me to call it the Devil's Wilderness." His
party advanced two miles in a south-west-by-west direction, "crossed the
northern branch of the Grose River and went up a very steep and high hill." The
passage was rough and so dangerous that the men were in great peril, often
climbing over ledges of rock where a false step might have cost them their
lives. All fortunately gained the top in safety, but much fatigued, and,
although they had only just left a stream, parched with thirst owing to the
heat. As a substitute for water they ate the native currant. They continued
climbing hilly ground until they came to some high bluff rocks, in order to
surmount which they again took off their loads and handed them from one to
another. An olive-coloured snake about four feet long passed close to Caley,
but, as he had no weapon in his hand, it escaped him.</p>
<p>Having ascended the rocks, which he called Skeleton Rocks, he obtained from
the top of them a fine view of the country to the eastward. Continuing an
uphill journey the party suddenly came upon a very narrow ridge, which
gradually widened until it formed yet another hill "of gentle ascent and
descent." Whilst passing over this, a breach on the left suddenly opened to
their view and they saw a valley below, into which Caley descended to look for
water and to seek a resting-place for the night. He soon found a spot suitable
for a camp, and describes how he had then to humour his tired men, who "were
not so overcome by fatigue as overawed by the dangers through which they had
passed." He tried to raise their spirits by telling them that, although the
route was a rough one, he was of opinion that they had hit upon the range
likely to lead them to the Carmarthen Mountains.</p>
<p>After he had reasoned with them for some time his words had the desired
effect and stimulated them to proceed. Caley was much interested not only in
the plants but also in the birds, insects, and other things new to him that he
saw in this part of his expedition. In particular he found a strange, luminous
grub, a number of which had fastened themselves to a projecting rock above
where he was sleeping. When he awoke during the night, at first he imagined
that he was gazing at the stars. Owing to this circumstance he called the place
Luminous Valley, but he says: "Although I saw so many I was able to catch but
few."</p>
<p>On the morning of November 8th the party, in order to get to the range,
retraced their steps for a quarter of a mile, and having altered their course
arrived at a small, oblong hill the shape of which Caley says reminded the men
at once of a pincushion. He therefore gave it the name of Pincushion Hill. From
there they could see the smoke of their last camp fire in Luminous Valley
east-by-north.[*]</p>
<blockquote>[* A little distance farther Caley gives the following beatings:
"Pincushion Hill E. &frac14; N., Grose's Head E.S.E. &frac14; S., Round Hill in
Grose's Vale E.S.E. &frac14; E,, Round Hill of Mr. Dawes S.W. &frac14; S. End
of the high range or Fern Tree Hill W.S.W. &frac14; W. Courses later upon the
range: N.W. by N.W., S.W. by S., and S.W. by W., all half a
mile."]</blockquote>
<p>On the 9th Caley left the range, which he thought was carrying him too far
to the north, and entered a shallow valley to try and gain an eminence (Fern
Tree Hill). Travelling due west, he had no sooner got across it than another
deep valley appeared, and, thinking this was the last valley, he crossed it in
an oblique direction south-west-by-south 1/2 mile which brought his party to
the point of another range which "we went down a little south," where it ended
in a steep precipice between two valleys. They tried to descend into the one on
the left hand, but found that "the water fell several yards perpendicularly";
and Caley describes the place as resembling a chasm called Grislefoot between
Whernside and Ingleborough, two of the highest mountains in England with which
he was familiar; and from his experience of climbing English mountains he came
to the conclusion that there must be a "midfitter" which united the range he
was standing on to the eminence called Fern Tree Hill. After much searching he
proved this surmise to be correct by finding the midfitter. The valleys on each
side of it soon became very deep; through the one on the left the waters were
carried to the Grose, while through that on the right they ran "probably into a
branch of Hawkesbury below Portland Head."</p>
<p>Being now short of water Caley went down into a deep valley to look for it,
and found some in another valley which led to the foot of Fern Tree Hill. Here
they encamped. A high wind blew in heavy gusts in the afternoon, threatening
rain. The night was wild and showers fell, causing the men much discomfort. On
the morning of the 10th the sun shone, though it soon became obscured by
clouds. Some lories were seen and Caley also heard the laughing jackass. He
describes the place as a barren spot, the trees sparse, small, and of crooked
growth, some resembling blue gum in colour and others having rather twisted
bark. Where there were patches of treeless ground the land resembled that
around Sydney, producing the same plants, such as <i>Banksia
cricaefolia.</i></p>
<p>From this camp the party went tip to the midfitter to get to Fern Tree Hill.
After some intricate climbing,[*] Caley saw from a height the pivot range, "of
the mountains we had crossed on our first leaving Richmond." From here he led
his men west-south-west to a valley and hill covered with brush, and found that
he had got on the wrong range, as to which he observes "a man might soon be
bewildered." He therefore turned back, and upon again seeing the first range of
mountains resolved "to keep them as the surest guide. For to keep in direct
line by compass was not in my power here to do." The courses afterwards taken
collectively were from south to south-east, and at last the summit of Fern Tree
Hill was gained, as to which Caley writes: "Four miles may be said our whole
day's journey," and "of that, the course S. to S.E. may be called 3 1/2
miles."</p>
<blockquote>[* Their courses then were S.W., S.W. by S., both 1 mile. W. and
S.S.W. across the head of the valley, which had given so much trouble to them
when searching for water the night before. Still going up hill on courses first
S.S.W, and then S.S.E., and lastly E. by N., both 1 mile.]</blockquote>
<p>The summit of Fern Tree Hill was found to be very narrow and covered with
brush, chiefly consisting of, amongst others, "a glaucous leaved <i>Senecio</i>
and a white flowered species of <i>Smilax,</i> which retarded progress very
much, and nettles which grew very high and stung vehemently." The part that
"was void of bush was thickly covered with timber and a species of fern which
as it increases in age forms a tree." Many of these tree ferns were very tall,
as were some of the timber trees. The soil was very moist and commonly of a
brown vegetable mould. From here Caley had a view of the mountains on both
sides. On his left he saw the first range--his "surest guide" and on the right
a fainter view of the ranges in that direction; his bearings were the Grose's
Head, east-1/2-south, western end of Mount Banks[*] south-west-by-west, some
whitish rocky breaches between south and south-south-west, whilst Round Hill
bore south. The whole country from west to east by way of north appeared
mountainous, yet but few peaks were to be seen. The valleys came from the
westward, and where "the rocky breaches" were there seemed to be a large
valley.</p>
<blockquote>[* Governor King says that Caley always called Mount King George by
the name of Mount Banks.]</blockquote>
<p>Leaving the summit of Fern Tree Hill they proceeded down the side of it
east-south-east to some rocks,[*] where "there were but few trees," to pass the
night. On the way down the hillside one of the party had a rather bad fall but
soon recovered from its effects. During the night rain fell heavily and all
complained of being cold and wet, although Caley had hoped that they would have
been secure from the rain through "having a hollow rock to creep into," but the
water came trickling down the rock and it was worse than being in the open.</p>
<p>Next day was the 11th--a Sunday morning--clouds of heavy fog prevented the
men leaving the camp before ten o'clock, by which time it had dispersed. The
party went down hill on a south-south-west course to cross a valley and ascend
Saddle Hill or Mount Banks, but on arriving at the bottom of the hill Caley was
surprised to find that the valley formed a "dreadful chasm" with perpendicular
sides the depth of which..."could not...be less than 50 yards...The breadth did
not seem to exceed 15 yards..."He threw some large pieces of rock into this
ravine and records that they made a weird noise and seem to take an endless
time to reach the bottom. There being no way of crossing it, the men returned
to Station Rock. The afternoon was wet and the fog became so dense that they
now could see only a few rods before them, it was therefore thought best to
halt for the night.</p>
<blockquote>[* Afterwards named Station Rock.]</blockquote>
<p>Caley mentions the different birds seen. Two crows flew round them and some
thrushes and redbreasts with black and white heads made their appearance. The
weather of the 12th was as wet and foggy as the previous day, and although the
afternoon was clearer, Caley did not deem it prudent to make a fresh start so
late in the day and spent his time in trying to get views of the country round
his camp.</p>
<p>On going to the top of the rock he found it to be large and to answer his
needs in every respect so he called it Station Rock. He accordingly made a
level with water and found the place was nearly equal in height with the base
of the mount of Mount Banks, nearly also equal with the top of Saddle Hill and
with the top of Round Hill, but Saddle Hill was lower; and he ascertained that
Fern Tree Hill, Mount Banks, Saddle Hill, and Round Hill did not form one range
as he had supposed when travelling there. He writes: "From Station Rock as far,
as eye could trace from the S. to the W. the ground appeared to slope towards
us...It had the aspect of being rough and mountainous. From Round Hill it
sloped towards the N.E. until it met with the opposite branches of the
Grose."</p>
<p>While upon Station Rock, Caley observed that Fern Tree Hill was separated
from Mount Banks by a deep valley--the one in which lay the "dreadful chasm"
into which he had cast stones. Saddle Hill and Mount Banks appeared to him to
be on one range but at the west end of Saddle Hill he saw a broken precipice
which seemed to form a valley "most probably...not deep." In the south 1/2 west
to south-south-west there was a high breach, of whitish appearance, and he
believed that at the bottom of it the principal branch of the Grose River
passed, though he says: "It is doubtful to conjecture which is the principal
branch of the Grose, let alone to affirm it."[*] However, he thought that this
branch was "the largest of any that comes from the west by this quarter and is
the same as I have mentioned at the Devil's Wilderness as coming from the S.W.,
at which place there did not seem any difference in the quantity of the water
as in the one we crossed which came from the north."</p>
<blockquote>[* Mr. Govett describing the Valley or ravine through which the
Grose River flows says: "The mountains which rise most conspicuously above the
surrounding ridges are Mount Hay, Mount King George and Mount Tomah...the first
is of conical shape...(frowning amidst rugged masses of rock and the tremendous
precipices and gigantic walls which overhanging confine the channel of this
inaccessible river); Mount King George called by some the Camel's Back from its
double figure (3 1/4 m. north west of Mt. Hay) presents on its west side
tremendous walls of rock more than 400 feet perpendicular. Mount Tomah (of flat
and tabular shape) is about four miles north of Mt. Hay. The latter possesses
rich tropical vegetation. The river winds round the basement of the precipices
and divides by a frightful chasm Mount Hay from Mount King George and Mount
Tomah which last are both situated on the north side of the ravine. The Grose
continuing in nearly an easterly direction for about 15 miles falls into the
Nepean and then takes the name of the Hawkesbury which after winding by a
tortuous course discharges itself finally into the sea at Broken Bay 30 miles
n. of Port Jackson."]</blockquote>
<p>On the 13th a fine morning burst over Station Rock, though clouds of mist
hung in the valleys below. Gradually rising, they enveloped the camp when the
men were preparing to leave it, but by noon had dispersed. Mountain fogs now
began to hinder the movements of the travellers seriously, and Caley points out
that it "would only have been labour in vain to attempt to travel through
them." He feared them, because, apart from the risk they incurred, the delay
necessarily reduced his stock of provisions. He knew, too, that since he had
come by a zigzag route, he would have to return by it, and the fogs might
easily render it impossible for him to find his former bearings.</p>
<p>Leaving Station Rock when the atmosphere grew clearer the explorers
travelled west-north-west, following a circuitous route towards a valley which
appeared to come from the westward. Their way led them over ground covered with
brush, nettles, and large loose stones, "very heavy and of a blue colour like
the magnetic stone on Prospect Hill," Caley being puzzled to find that he could
see no rocks in the vicinity, "whence they could have been thrown by any
convulsion." He was anxious to reach the valley which he believed came from the
westward; for, he says, he intended "to keep it...on our left until it
presented some favourable place of crossing in order that I might get to Mount
Banks."</p>
<p>On reaching the brink of the valley and trying to descend it at this point,
"it was found impracticable and so we returned" to the range. After this
disappointment Caley caught sight of a hill bearing about north-west, which
seemed to join to Fern Tree Hill, and he resolved to make his way towards it,
as it seemed to form a passage to the west, and there appeared to be a small
range that ran from behind it in a western direction. He therefore decided to
head the troublesome valley, and, having done so, took his men through thick
brush and came to a hill which lay on the right. From this hill Caley saw what
he at first thought was a "saddle," but it proved to be a deep valley, and
opposite to him stood the hill he wished to reach. He could now see that from
it ran a high range consisting of small hummocks and he felt sure that upon
this another eminence, called the Haycock, must be situated.</p>
<p>The valley, which he had previously imagined came from the westward, he now
was convinced came from the northward. "To cross this valley was now the grand
object," so he went along its northern edge, and, though he despaired of
finding any place to descend, to his surprise he came upon a narrow cleft. He
took off his load, and, having left his men behind, while he went down it, had
not gone far before he noticed a kangaroo path and saw that the passage
gradually widened. He accordingly returned to his men and all descended,
forcing their way through a bush-like species of eucalyptus, which, in places,
covered the hillside. They then halted at a hollow rock near which there was a
rill of water. Some tall, straight trees with dark green foliage grew there,
and at first Caley could not tell to what species they belonged, but he
afterwards identified them as Sassafras. The party passed the night at a
disagreeably damp place in the depths of the valley, which, as he made the
descent, Caley says, "put me in mind of looking down a coal-pit, and where
frogs and toads made such a hideous noise that I was induced to call it Dismal
Dingle." Next day, the 14th, the morning was fine, yet from their situation the
men were unable to see the sky unless they stood upright and looked through the
openings in the trees.</p>
<p>Continuing their journey they went over Table Hill[*] north-west-by-north
1/2 mile to a midfitter. Of it Caley writes: "This midfitter which links Table
Hill and a lower range is much like the one that links Fern Tree Hill and the
range which cornes from the Devil's Wilderness. As we came along it the valley
on our left conveyed its waters direct to the valley...which separates Fern
Tree Hill from Table Hill...Between us and Mt. Banks there seem to be several
valleys which...became...very deep."</p>
<blockquote>[* Mount Tomah.]</blockquote>
<p>Proceeding from the midfitter, Caley lost the range and followed a jutting
spur. On retrieving his mistake he turned abruptly south-west, crossed a valley
and fell in with another range south-south-west (a midfitter), then went
south-west and arrived at a barren piece of land[*] destitute of trees, and in
appearance much like some places in the vicinity of Sydney, such as South Head.
Though this was a barren spot there was a wide contrast between it and Dismal
Dingle. "It commanded an excellent prospect and the country round seemed to
consist of small ranges of hills and valleys that run in a circuitous direction
or as though nature had formed a labyrinth." Caley named this place Bluff Head.
They at last were close to the foot of Mount Banks, but another deep valley
still remained between them and it. They thought at first that this would check
their progress, until Caley again espied a midfitter, and by this means their
goal was won.</p>
<blockquote>[* Bald Hills (?)]</blockquote>
<p>The march from Bluff Head to Mount Banks was tedious, and the tired men
thought that they would never come to their journey's end: "Between Bluff Head
and Mount Banks they crossed two hills, the larger one being named Range Hill."
A thunderstorm took place and they had to seek shelter in a rock house for the
night. From it the Haycock bore north-1/4-east. Table Hill
north-north-east-1/4-east, Saddle Hill east 1/4 mile. Here a piece of bark was
found which looked as though it had been cut from the tree by natives. The only
other signs of the aborigines seen by Caley in these mountains had been the
smoke of their fires up the branch of the Grose which ran into the Devil's
Wilderness.</p>
<p>Next day, Thursday, November 15th, Caley ascended Mount Banks[*] and had
excellent views from it in every direction. To obtain these he says "was his
main object" in journeying to this hill. The sky was clear when he arrived, and
the men who started to search for a place at which to encamp, as near the
summit as possible, soon found a rock house upon its western side.</p>
<blockquote>[* This was Mt. King George, or the Camel's Back, so called from
its double figure.]</blockquote>
<p>The day was set aside as a "rest day for the men," but Caley himself did not
rest and made all haste while the light was clear to take bearings and to make
some observations. Beginning with the south end of Mount Banks he found that
its top formed "an oval about 20 to 30 yards long which was covered with heavy
loose stones...on the eastern side...ferns grow among these...but on the
western a small bushlike eucalyptus"...The sides "break suddenly into rocks and
at the bottom there was a deep valley, which comes from the west-north-west.
This valley takes a circuitous course to the east and appears to run on the
western side of Round Hill." At the bottom was a fine stream, "evidently that
which falls into the Devil's Wilderness from the S.W."</p>
<p>The trees there were small in general of only two sorts...one with a bark
like the colonial mahogany and the other...apple tree. There was an excellent
view from the N.N.W. to the S. but from S. to N.E. the views are interrupted by
the trees and only seen through the openings." He could not be certain whether
he actually saw Prospect[*] as the high land "backwards" prevented him making
out "its true figure."</p>
<blockquote>[* Caley gives these bearings: " Round Hill S.ES. &frac12; S.,
Grose's Head the high point E. a little S. over it is cleared land, which I
suspect to be Castle Hill. Prospect E.N.E. &frac14; E."]</blockquote>
<p>He found that the whole length of the top of Mount Banks was about half a
mile, and that the north end was "somewhat the shape of the other...the
top...thickly covered with loose stones...among which fern grows and causes bad
walking." It commanded "a prospect from the S.E. by S. to E.S.E. in general
very good." "From N.E. by E. to N.W. by W. Fern Tree and Table Hill prevent a
distant view."[*] Caley looked again and again for "the conical hill which is
called Mount Hunter," but he could not distinguish it.</p>
<blockquote>[* Bearings from here were: "The Haycock N. 1/4 W. High distant
saddle land N.N.W. A small hummock on Mount S.S.E.]</blockquote>
<p>As he clambered round the mountain he came to a part which he named the
Saddle and its north end "the Middle Hummock," whence he obtained the views he
desired of the surrounding country; and writing of this spot he says. "Though
the lowest part on the top of the hill it has the best prospect owing to its
nakedness." After ascending the Middle Hummock he looked eastward and saw in
that direction "a wide and extensive vale...and the land on the sea coast...a
little hazy."</p>
<p>He then turned and looked westward! Before him lay that hidden region whose
secrets so many brave explorers had vainly striven to discover; where fertile
plains and wide rivers still awaiting the coming of white men were to prove the
goal of those who followed him on his path of exploration--pioneers like
himself whose names are written imperishably in the history of the West.</p>
<p>Having gazed at the mountains, Caley, tired and almost worn out, in spite of
his indomitable spirit, wrote those familiar words which historians have so
often quoted (possibly as paraphrased by Governor King): "On looking to the
westward I saw no large valleys but the one close at hand from which the ground
apparently kept rising gently and gradually as far as eye could trace. In a few
places there appeared...swamps, in others void of trees and only scrubby...The
present appearance would lead one to imagine it might be readily travelled over
provided one was across the inaccessible valley close at hand, yet there is no
doubt...we shall find other valleys of a similar nature as I am too well
convinced of there being such...One comes upon them all at once like a
ha-ha."</p>
<p>Finding his provisions dwindling, his men exhausted, and the mountains
impassable at last he decided to return to Sydney.</p>
<p>Caley noted that Mount Banks[*] possessed but few plants. The trees growing
there were the bush-like <i>Eucalyptus</i> and a species of mimosa; a
glaucous-leaved <i>Senecio</i> mixed with the fern and when climbing the Saddle
he remarks, "The Warrote grows here," referring most likely to the waratah.</p>
<blockquote>[* Mount King George.]</blockquote>
<p>The birds in this region were chiefly lories and crows. On seeing a crow on
the 16th, when the men were on the point of starting on their return journey,
he writes: "We had several times seen a crow...in this part on whichIcould not
help remarking one of the men saying they must be lost or they would never stay
in such a place...which put me in mind of Dr. Johnson's sarcasm when he saw a
crow in Scotland."</p>
<p>The place where Caley stood to look westward may well be called the limit of
his journey. Next day he left Mount Banks and travelled back along his outward
track, the party arriving safely at Parramatta on November 23rd, when Governor
King sympathetically stated that in his opinion the idea of attempting to cross
such a "confused and barren assemblage of mountains with impassable chasms
between was as chimerical as useless."</p>
<p>In August, 1806, Caley again attempted to cross the mountains, but of this
expedition there is no account among his MSS. This is curious, for the
expedition was of sufficient importance for King to write to Governor Bligh on
August 23, 1806: "Caley is just returned and should have waited on you
to-morrow but...he is much fatigued and in want of rest...He has confirmed the
existence of a large tract of forest land beyond Natai which...confirms Mr.
Barrallier's observations...and will be useful in extending the interior
establishments by which means alone the passing of the mountains can be
established...If the party had not taken a liberal supply of provisions they
must have starved. The settler who accompanied Caley is quite knocked up."</p>
<p>It is said that on one of his excursions Caley penetrated far into the
mountains and built the cairn of stones near Woodford to mark the limit of his
journey. In later years there has been much doubt as to this being the work of
Caley, but the fact that Governor Macquarie afterwards called the landmark
"Caley's Repulse" will show that he believed it to be so, and it seems
incredible that one so greatly interested in the exploration of the mountains
as Macquarie could have been misled upon such a point. As Caley did not leave
Sydney until after Macquarie's arrival, he may well have given the Governor a
verbal account of his explorations.</p>
<p>Caley returned to England in 1810 and later was appointed to superintend the
botanical gardens at St. Vincent. He never ceased to regret that he was unable
to find a way over the mountains, and was sceptical with regard to BlaxIand's
party having crossed them. "Will you believe me if I say the Blue Mountains in
New South Wales are not yet crossed..." he writes from St. Vincent to Robert
Brown; "for such...is my opinion. What I mean by crossing the mountains is
having gone as far as where the waters are disembogued on the opposite coast
and if having got to the summit of a range of hills which commands an excellent
prospect of the colony and then descending on its western side, be called
crossing the mountains they have long ago been crossed...Cox's River which we
are now told runs through Prince Regent's Glen and empties into the Nepean I
take to be a river which unites with the Hawkesbury at Mulgoey...Wonder no
longer where the conflux of this river...is, but turn to the Grose and you will
be tolerably correct...Mr. Barrallier crossed the mountains as much as the
others have...The forest he travelled over is much superior, with a main branch
of the Hawkesbury gliding through the middle of the vale, and if coals be an
object I have seen them in that quarter myself...though I walked 18 of his
miles in an hour in as rough a valley as up the Grose, yetIwould sooner trust
to his accuracy than to Mr. Evan's."</p>
<h4>BLAXLAND CROSSES THE MOUNTAINS</h4>
<p>The three men who finally succeeded where so many had failed were BlaxIand,
Lawson, and William Wentworth. The last-named, then only a youth of twenty, in
after years, owing to his determination and energy in furthering every object
for his country's good, came to be called by his fellow-colonists the
Australian Patriot."</p>
<p>Gregory BlaxIand, who led this expedition into the mountains, had settled at
South Creek some years before, and was already familiar with the danger and
difficulties to be met with among the ranges, occasionally having made short
excursions to the foot of them from his homestead. He was now about to
establish his reputation as a. bold and skilful explorer of them.</p>
<p>Lieutenant William Lawson, the third of the party, was an officer of the New
South Wales Corps and may be termed "a born pioneer," as is shown by the way in
which he aided BlaxIand in this expedition, and by the part he played later,
when he opened up the district around Mudgee.</p>
<p>It has been stated that Lawson often conversed with Caley in England upon
the subject of crossing the mountains, and that the plan of ascending the ridge
or the spine of the main range and following it westward was then discussed for
the first time. On the other hand, it is said that the idea originated with
BlaxIand, who, in a previous tour, had noticed that the backbone of the
mountains ran westward and determined to ascend the ridge and push his way
along the top of it, keeping in sight the heads of the gullies which were
supposed to empty their streams into the Western or Warragamba River on the
left hand, and into the Grose on the right. Whoever suggested it, it was the
plan which ultimately led to success.</p>
<p>At four o'clock of the afternoon of Tuesday, May 11, 1813, the explorers
left BlaxIand's homestead at South Creek with four servants, five dogs, and
four pack-horses, crossed the Nepean at Emu Island (some thirty-six miles west
of Sydney), and after travelling two miles to the south-west halted at the foot
of the first ridge, where they encamped for the night. Next morning they
ascended the ridge, and on reaching its summit came to a spot where there was a
freshwater lagoon.[*] As they advanced, difficulties soon overtook them. Their
horses were constantly stumbling and the rocky hillsides, trying enough for the
men, proved still more so for the animals. After two exhausting days both for
man and beast, it was decided to leave the horses in charge of two men while
the rest of the party cut their way through the bush. The work was
unflinchingly got through, although there was not a man who was not wearied nor
a hand that was not blistered and sore.</p>
<blockquote>[* This lagoon still exists. The explorers reached the summit of
the first ridge somewhere near the station at Glenbrook.]</blockquote>
<p>On this memorable day, Friday, May 14th, a path extending for five miles
through the thicket was completed wide enough to allow the pack-horses to pass
and at five o'clock the explorers returned to camp. On the following day,
leaving the camp as before in charge of the two men, they cleared two more
miles, but, seeing no sign of grass for the horses, they returned again at five
o'clock. On Sunday they rested. Next day, the 17th, the whole party pushed on
and encamped on a narrow mountain ridge between two very deep gullies where
some of the men descended a precipice to a depth of 600 feet to look for water,
but none could be found. On the 18th, two miles farther on, they found their
path flanked on both sides with precipices. Removing on their way some of the
larger pieces of rock, the men crept along the narrow edge of the ridge and
eventually got over in safety, but in the evening returned to camp, tired and
out of spirits.</p>
<p>On the 19th, they ascended the second ridge,[*] and, looking back from it,
caught a distant view of the settlement now a "minute speck " beneath them. Not
far from this spot, while busily cutting trees along the narrow path, they came
upon a cairn of stones, shaped like a pyramid. One side of it had been opened
and the stones scattered around, evidently by natives. It was thought then that
it had been built by Bass to mark the end of his tour and that the exploring
party were now following in his tracks; but, as already mentioned, Governor
Macquarie believed that this pile of stones was Caley's work and named it
Caley's Repulse.</p>
<blockquote>[* This second ridge was the rugged range lying beyond Linden and
separated from it by a deep valley.]</blockquote>
<p>What lay beyond Caley's Repulse was a mystery! The explorers might well have
been overawed by the task they had set themselves. Possibly they remembered the
old stories of the blacks at Port Jackson, who said it was the abode of evil
spirits who hurled thunder and floods and burning winds upon them or, as Caley
had learnt from natives, that beyond the mountains there was a great river
inland and "a plane above the trees," which was nearer the truth.</p>
<p>From Caley's Repulse for some days the travellers advanced step by step
averaging four or five miles a day, and on May 22nd reached the summit of the
third and highest ridge in the neighbourhood of Wentworth Falls. A precipice
here crossed their path and defied their efforts to descend it. At last they
found a way round it and noticed that the ridge they were on was widening
before them. Next day they passed close to the site of Katoomba and cut their
names upon the trunk of a tree growing In their route. New birds attracted
them. Emus were heard calling, and on the 24th the sound of a black fellow
chopping wood excited their curiosity, and told them, although they could not
catch sight of the native, that the mountains were inhabited.[*]</p>
<blockquote>[* On this day they crossed Blackheath.]</blockquote>
<p>On May 25th, the track of a wombat was seen, and a little later the smoke of
native fires rising through the trees to westward, where apparently thirty
natives were moving about but so far off that it was impossible to ascertain
anything regarding them. On Friday, May 28th, as they followed the mountain
spur that juts beyond Mount Victoria, to the explorers' joy, they could see
grass country in a valley below them. It was clear of trees and covered with
loose white pebbles and stones. At first it looked barren and sandy, but they
perceived that it really was grass, long and of a light straw colour. In the
evening they descended the ridge to examine it more closely, but returned again
to their camp on the edge of a high mountain, which was afterwards named Mount
York by Governor Macquarie, though for some time it was familiarly known to
travellers as the "Big Hill." It rose sharply 798 feet from the valley below,
which was called the Vale of Clwyd.</p>
<p>On Saturday, 29th., at seven o'clock in the morning, the men began their
descent into the valley through a passage[*] between the rocks thirty feet wide
which they had discovered the day before. A low, slanting trench had to be cut
with a hoe down the steep side of the mountain for the horses to walk in, since
there was no sort of foothold for them.</p>
<blockquote>[* The passage was afterwards named Cox's Pass, but Blaxland, in a
letter to the Governor, dated June 15, 1815, states that it was discovered
through a suggestion of Wentworth's, and that the river was found by Lawson
while the others were bringing the horses down the mountain.]</blockquote>
<p>From the foot of Mount York the explorers proceeded northwesterly about two
miles and encamped on the banks of a fine stream of water.[*] The natives
evidently were still moving before them, for smoke was again seen to the
westward on the 31st; remains of their old fires were found and traces where
they had been sharpening their spears; and the marks on the trees showed that
their method of climbing differed from that of the Sydney blacks.</p>
<blockquote>[* The River Lett.]</blockquote>
<p>On this day Blaxland and his party passed through forest land and open
meadow and met with two streams.[*] At nightfall they pitched their tents by
the faster-flowing one at a short distance from a high hill, which took the
shape of a sugar loaf.[**]</p>
<blockquote>[* The Cox and Lett Rivers.]</blockquote>
<blockquote>[* The Cox River, named by Governor Macquarie; and Mount BlaxIand,
so called by Evans.]</blockquote>
<p>After once more surveying the newly found pastures, the explorers, now
sorely in need of provisions, prepared to return home. For a time they
satisfied their hunger by eating flowers of the honeysuckle tree, which are
shaped like a bottle brush and are full of honey. The natives still were
encamped at a little distance away, evidently possessing no huts, and would not
allow the white men to approach them. Terminating their journey eight or nine
miles from Mount York, on Tuesday, June 1st, the travellers ascended the ridge
and began their journey homewards; they carefully marked the trees to show each
mile of the road, and crossed the Nepean on Sunday, June 6, 1813, with all
their party well.</p>
<p>There still may be seen on the old Bathurst road near Katoomba the remains
of a tree trunk-now fenced in--on which BlaxIand, Lawson, and Wentworth carved
their initials L. B. W. Standing on a high point of the mountains, it forms an
inspiring memorial of a supreme effort of those three men, carried to success
solely by their courage and endurance.</p>
<p>Great was the excitement in Sydney when the news of BlaxIand's success
became known. With one accord the colonists rejoiced that they were no longer
to live hemmed in to the westward by a mountain barrier, covered by giant rocks
with ravines between, which, like some sleeping monster of old, had withheld
from them for so many years the land that rightly should have been theirs to
till and cultivate--a barrier among whose ravines Caley's stubborn will had
been of no avail and against whose rocks the determined spirit of Bass had
spent itself in vain. Had the mountains themselves been removed the hopes of
the townsfolk could not have burned more brightly than when their footsore
fellow-colonists, thoroughly worn out, their clothes torn and frayed and hands
covered with wounds, returned home bringing the good news that their party had
passed over the Blue Mountains and had seen long grass growing on the other
side. Little wonder if, as it has been averred, Governor Macquarie gave an
order to ring the church bells, for the conquest of the mountains was
complete.</p>
<p>Perhaps on that day, as the great possibilities for the country's
development dawned upon them, some remembered the words of Captain Tench
written on reaching New South Wales with Hunter in H.M.S. "Sirius" on January
20, 1788: "To us it was a great and important day and I hope will mark the
foundation...of an Empire," and perhaps, echoing them, some said of June 6,
1813: "This too, is an important day for it will mark a milestone on our
road."</p>
<h4>EVANS EXPLORES THE PLAINS</h4>
<p>The mystery concerning the Blue Mountains having been solved, the discovery
of the new territory led to important results. On November 19th, acting on
instructions from Governor Macquarie, George William Evans, Deputy
SurveyorGeneral, set out with a party from Emu Island to make a survey of the
road and to explore the country from the point where the discoverers had turned
back. On November 26th he reached the valley through which the rapid stream
ran--the limit of BlaxIand's expedition--and encamped at the foot of the
"handsome mountain like a sugar loaf," which he named Mount Blaxland, calling
two others "similar in figure" Wentworth's and Lawson's Sugar Loaves.</p>
<p>In advancing from Mount BlaxIand, Evans, on November 27th, came upon a
range[*] whose hills were very steep and proved a difficult ascent for the
horses. He then discovered a valley where the grass was thick and halted to
rest them. During his stay in it he remarks that he was unable to find any
mimosa. This flower he evidently greatly admired, for he mentions it more than
once in his journal. Strangely enough, in the country which he was on the verge
of discovering the mimosa grows plentifully, and in some parts in the greatest
profusion. When flowering, its exquisitely scented yellow clusters often form
one of the prettiest features of the landscape. At this point, however, Evans
was yet amid rugged bushland on the side of a hilly range, and could not then
have foreseen, unless BlaxIand had already mentioned the flower to him, that he
would be likely to find it in his path.</p>
<blockquote>[* Clarence Hilly Range, named later by Governor
Macquarie.]</blockquote>
<p>Next day, November 28th, he left the horses in the valley, and sent three of
his men to look for a track by which the animals could proceed on the morrow,
while he crossed over to the north side of the rivulet to survey it. He
returned to the camp at one o'clock and soon afterwards the men also came back,
having been successful in their efforts to find a passage.</p>
<p>On Monday, 29th, in spite of precautions, Evans says that he "stopped quite
out of spirits, having got completely entangled among the hills." All this day
he had great difficulty in fighting his way to the main ridge of the range. The
only path to it led him through wildernesses of scrub and over masses of
granite rock where the horses' feet suffered terribly.</p>
<p>After travelling for two miles and a half, he got upon a lofty hill whence
he could see for about fifteen miles to the north-west. He tells us that the
view he obtained was all forest trees, but in every other direction it was
obscured by high ranges, and the whole journey on this day totalled only three
and a half miles.</p>
<p>On November 30th, he succeeded in mounting the main ridge by a difficult
path, and from it, after walking for two miles, he could see northwards for a
good distance. A peculiar mist rising some twenty miles away attracted his
attention; it was so unlike smoke that he thought a river or large lagoon must
be there. A quarter of a mile farther along the range he took another look
around him from a high mount, and could see for forty miles over what appeared
to be open country.</p>
<p>He then descended the range and passing over huge boulders came upon a river
which took its rise in some large hills to the southward. Here his party shot
wild duck and caught fish, which were large and plentiful in the stream. The
distance travelled on this day was five and a half miles.</p>
<p>Evans then followed the windings of the river, which appeared to lead him
"north of west" and next day, December 1st, discovered on the north side of it
a remarkable hill with a stone on the peak. The hill was "nearly circular in
form or like an Indian Fort,"[*] and this he named Evans's Crown[**] after
himself.</p>
<blockquote>[*Quoted from Oxley's journal.]</blockquote>
<blockquote>[** It is close to Tarana.]</blockquote>
<p>He walked to its summit and, on looking westward, could see for a distance
of fifty miles, then gaining his first view of the Bathurst Plains. His joy was
unbounded. One can well believe the story handed down by the earliest settlers
there who said that when Evans first caught sight of the plains he imagined
that he was gazing at a vast inland sea. He might easily have been misled, for
waves upon waves of grass like ocean billows lay stretched before him as far as
eye could see. Nor can one wonder that Evans was delighted with his discovery.
Few places suited to the wants of civilized man had been so jealously concealed
from observation and approach, more bravely striven for or so hardly won as
this inland prairie. He soon discovered that it was grassland, and of it he
writes "It is a great extent of grazing land!...well watered by running streams
in almost every valley!" This day he travelled five and a quarter miles. The
following day turned out wet, and every one of the party got drenched, the thin
leaves of the eucalyptus affording them little or no shelter; but he took great
notice of the country through which they passed, and wrote: "I think it equal
to Van Diemen's Land, the river winding through fine flats and round the points
of small ridges--that gradually descend to it--covered with the finest grass
and intermixed with the white daisy as in England." On this date he travelled
only four and a half miles.</p>
<p>Next day he found the flower that he had before so often sought in vain--the
mimosa--"in clusters on the banks of the river," and evidently his progress on
this day was a little faster, for his distance was five and three-quarter
miles. On Saturday, December 4th, he came to "an exceeding good tract of
country, and he describes it as "the handsomest I have yet seen, with gentle
rising hills and dales well watered. The distant hills which are about five
miles south, appear as grounds laid out, divided into fields by hedges. There
are few trees on them and the grass is quite green."</p>
<p>He still kept near the river, which provided the men with an abundance of
fish, and the dogs in the meantime killed a kangaroo, of which there were
plenty seen, as well as emus. While tracing the river, which wound over the
plains, he bestowed upon it, a day or two later, the name of Fish River,
because the fish were so easily caught and continued to be so abundant. His men
rested near the banks on the 5th as it was Sunday. It rained most of the day
and they had no shelter, nor did the trees provide them with any bark as a
protection.</p>
<p>The first clear tract of land was named O'Connell Plains, in honour of the
Lieutenant-Governor. "At the space of about a mile," says Evans in his diary on
December 6th, "I came upon a fine plain of rich land, the handsomest country I
ever saw, it surpasseth Port Dalrymple" (Tasmania). Again he returns to praise
it: "This place is worth speaking of as good and beautiful: the tract of clear
land occupies about a mile on each side of the river...We saw a number of wild
geese but too shy to let us near them."</p>

<h4>EVANS'S ROUTE MAP</h4>
</center>
<p>Farther on he came to the outskirts of yet another plain which was "still
more pleasing and very extensive." He reached it at three o'clock on December
6th, and observes: "The soil is exceedingly rich and produces the finest grass
intermixed with a variety of herbs. The hills have a look of a park and grounds
laid out. I am at a loss for language to describe the country--I named this
part the Macquarie Plains." He notes the abundance of game, and fish as well,
"which is caught immediately--they seem to bite at any time." This day's
progress amounted to six miles.</p>
<p>Evans continued to advance along the Fish River, and on December 7th, "at
about four miles," his men were stopped by another river from the southward,
which they traced for two miles in order to find a spot where they could ford
it. They were held up by an approaching thunderstorm and had to find a shelter,
for it was a severe one. This day the distance travelled was five and
three-quarter miles.</p>
<p>After a wet night a fine morning broke on December 8th. While employed in
tracing the second river, Evans, two miles farther on, came upon more open
country, which he named Mitchell's Plains. His party managed to cross this
stream by throwing a rough log bridge across it, while some of the men swam
over with the horses. He found the surroundings very beautiful: "No mountains
to be seen. There are high hills at great distances, can observe them green to
their tops."</p>
<p>He named the second river Campbell River in honour of Mrs. Macquarie, it
being her maiden name, and came to its junction with the Fish River at sunset.
The two streams when united formed one river, to which Evans gave the name of
the Macquarie, in honour of the Governor of New South Wales.</p>
<p>The Macquarie River flowed through another extensive plain, and on December
9th Evans in glowing terms praises the scenery: " The hills are fine indeed...I
never saw anything to equal it...the soil is good," and he adds a word of
admiration for some trees he saw there: "The small trees on the lower banks of
the river stand straight not lying down as...at the Hawkesbury." He also
commends the grass:" The grass might be mowed, it is so thick and long,
particularly on the flat lands." He was able to travel eight and a quarter
miles on this day.</p>
<p>On December 10th he again followed the windings of the Macquarie across
country which seemed to excel all the rest in its richness, and which he
describes as "excellent good land with the best grass I have seen in any part
of New South Wales." Even the hills were covered with fine pasture, the trees
being far apart. "At the termination of the plains is a very handsome mount,"
and Evans went to the top of the mount which stood at the extremity of the
plains, and says: "I named it Mount Pleasant from the prospect it commands to
the N.E."</p>
<p>As he stood and viewed its surroundings he wrote upon his map: "I can see at
least 30 miles S.W. I could distinguish several plains and the course of a
stream." He certainly makes it plain from his writings that he was pleased with
all he saw, and he observes: "The river now winds itself round the points of
forest hills."</p>
<p>There were numbers of emus and kangaroos now to be seen, but he writes, with
evident disgust, "The dogs will not give chase and I imagine they are bad
ones." The river compensated for this loss, however; for he presently adds:
"Nothing astonishes me more than the amazing large fish that are caught: one is
now brought in that weighs at least 15 Ibs. They are all of the same
species."[*] He thus ends his entry on this day: "I call the plains last passed
over 'Bathurst Plains.'" The distance travelled was seven and a quarter
miles.</p>
<blockquote>[* Native Perch or "Australian Bass."]</blockquote>
<p>From Mount Pleasant, on the 11th, Evans continued to follow the course of
the Macquarie. There soon came an alteration in the aspect of the country, and
he thus describes his route:"The river leads me among hills the points of which
end in rocky bluffs near the water. At about four miles I was brought up by one
of them which appears to be the termination of a range of high hills from the
south and is the only mass of rock I have met with since leaving the Blue
Mountains." He halted at this spot for a few hours so that he could examine it
and ascend a peak, which he named on his map the Pine Hill. From its summit he
saw that the river "twined about N.W. round the points of stupendous green
hills to the S. and S.W." On the north side of the river a ridge of pasture
hills ranged westward. To the east he could see the fine plains that his party
had travelled over. He could observe no rocky ranges with pine trees save the
one he was on, and he writes: "The pines have a very romantic appearance...the
largest of them is about four feet in circumference."</p>
<p>He wished to go over the river and explore the north side, but says, "we
could not cross the water." On this day the party travelled where there were
many rocks but good pasture, the distance accomplished being six and a quarter
miles. On Sunday, December 12th, his men rested, while Evans took a walk for a
few miles to the south-west, and was pleased to see "steep healthy hills
thickly covered with grass and water in almost every valley."</p>
<p>On the 13th "the hills were still steep and not so fine as those already
passed"; "they are rather rough with rocks...The gums are much larger and
intermixed with boxtree...the soil...of a stiffer nature having pieces of
alabaster rock among it. The high lands...have a great deal about them that on
the surfaces is quite white in some places and of a yellow cast in others." The
Macquarie's course now grew "irregular." On December 14th the country through
which it ran became more and more barren-looking, and Evans says, "it is the
worst I have been over since leaving the Blue Mountains." Nevertheless, he
managed to travel seven miles on that day. On the 15th the road grew very
rugged indeed, and the only open country to be seen was that from north-west to
east.</p>
<p>The travelling for some days had been so rough that the men were now almost
barefoot: the stones and grass had cut their shoes to pieces. Nor could they
hope to renew them, since the dogs would not chase the kangaroo and, says
Evans, "there is no certainty of obtaining skins for our feet." The horses'
backs were also in a bad condition, and seeing no hopes of getting to the end
of the high range of hills on which he then was Evans determined on December
16th to turn back on the following day. He writes" "I am now 98&frac12; miles
from the limitation of Mr. BlaxIand's excursion." This he had ascertained
through having measured the whole distance by chain.</p>
<p>On the 17th the party turned eastward and made their way back again over the
open plains. The track on Evans's map shows that he did not follow his outward
track along the Macquarie, and only returned to the river at intervals,
presumably when in need of water. On one of these occasions he was fortunate
enough to meet with some of the natives. He had previously looked for them, and
had found "late traces" of their presence, so that he writes, "I think they are
watching us and keep at some distance."</p>
<p>On the 21st, however, while the men were fishing on the banks of the river,
some were seen making their way towards it. The white men watched the black
party advance over the plain, and quietly waited for their approach in order to
surprise them. There were only two women and four children. "The poor creatures
trembled and fell down with fright" at the sight of the strangers, and Evans
says. "I think they were coming for water, I gave them what fish we had--also
some fish hooks, twine and a tornahawk--which they appeared glad to get from
us. Two boys ran away: the other small children cried much at first. A little
while after I had played with them they began to be good humoured and laugh.
Both the women were blind of their right eyes."</p>
<p>Thus East met West on the Bathurst Plains.</p>
<h4>BATHURST AND BEYOND</h4>
<p>After Evans had returned to Sydney and had given an account of his travels,
no time was lost in making a road over the mountains to the newly-found
territory. Two hundred and fifty-seven miles of thick bush were cleared
(fifty-eight of which spanned the breadth of the mountains); viaducts were
built round giant rocks; chasms were bridged in a way that even to-day would be
considered remarkable: with the result that when, on April 25, 1815, the
Governor, accompanied by Mrs. Macquarie and suite, left for the settlement, the
general and his wife were able to drive the whole way in their post-chaise.
This notable feat in roadmaking was the work of Mr. William Cox, J.P., of
Windsor.</p>
<p>Upon reaching Evans's Crown and the highlands above the Bathurst Plains, the
Governor obtained an extensive view of the country and of the Fish and Campbell
Rivers. The first glimpse of the former gave him an idea that it was a stream
of considerable magnitude. Owing, however, to the dry weather at the time, very
little water was running and it might have been more properly described as a
chain of pools.</p>
<p>At a distance of seven miles from the bridge which had been made over the
Campbell River, a little to the south of its junction with the Fish River, the
view was again admired. We need not wonder that the general openly expressed
his pleasure at the sight of the open country. Years afterwards it was written
of him that "he constructed roads like a Colossus and covered the Blue
Mountains with corn"! but at this time he knew nothing of the interior,
therefore the fertile grassland heralded prosperity and dispelled any doubts
suggested by the barren regions of alternate rock and thicket.</p>
<p>A little later he saw the Macquarie, when the course of the river could be
easily traced by the tall swamp oaks that grew upon its banks. It is the
Macquarie of the white man; but in past ages the black men had called it
Wambool or Wandering River, on account of its winding course, and out of the
wood of the swamp oaks they had carved their boomerangs, shields, and womerahs.
In its reaches were afterwards found large numbers of that curious animal the
duck-billed platypus, and on the banks grew in profusion shrubs new to the
colonists, strange grasses, and flax with its sweet-scented purple and white
flowers.</p>
<p>A few trees were dotted here and there over the open country, chiefly the
tall white eucalyptus, others being wattle or mimosa and some casuarina, tall
and picturesque as the pine. On each side of the river little dark hillocks or
knolls, and peculiar "fairy rings," had been formed, and long furrows at
regular intervals marked the plains. The furrows were remarkable and would have
been taken for plough ridges in a civilized land, but no ploughshare had yet
broken the soil, and it was conjectured that the water of a flood which had
long receded must have caused them. It was curious that the furrows on each
side of the Dividing Range ran in the same direction from north-east to
south-west.</p>
<p>On May 4th the party encamped in an open space on the left bank of the
Macquarie, whence the Governor made excursions along both banks and saw some
natives. He had a portrait of a native chief drawn for him, and in a letter to
the Home Government vouched for its being an excellent likeness. Some of these
natives possessed cloaks of kangaroo skins, stitched together with the sinews
of the emu, which they wore loosely over their shoulders. These had the fur
side turned inwards and were often adorned with curious devices on the outer
side. Governor Macquarie described one to Lord Bathurst which he said bore "as
regularly formed a St. George's cross as could be made."</p>
<p>On Sunday, May 7th, the Governor fixed on a suitable site for the erection
of a town to which he gave the name of Bathurst in honour of Henry third Earl
Bathurst, then Secretary of State for the Colonies. The site designed for the
town was found to be by observation taken at the selected flagstaff
twenty-seven and a half miles north and ninety-four and a half miles west of
Government House, Sydney. Within a distance of ten miles there were "not less
than 50,000 acres, quite half of which was fit for cultivation..." On May 11th
the Governor and his party set out on their return to Sydney, where they
arrived on the 19th.</p>
<p>As the Macquarie River flowed with such strong current and volume past the
new settlement, the Governor dispatched Evans to trace the river still farther,
and explore the country to the west and south-west. This is known as Evans's
second expedition westward. Accompanied by his man Appledove, he left Bathurst
on May 13, 1815, passed through a valley named Queen Charlotte's Vale, and
discovered a small tributary and then a larger one, which he called Limestone
Creek. On the 25th he fell in with a creek bearing south, which joined the bed
of a stream that came from a north-westerly direction. It was dry, but the
banks were seventy-nine feet apart and the large swamp oaks growing on either
side made it evident that it marked the course of a large river. Evans named it
the Lachlan in honour of the Governor, and established a military dep&ocirc;t
at a spot which he called Byrne's Creek. He discovered many hills and named the
highest three Mount Lachlan, Mount Molle, and Mount Lewin. Emus and kangaroos
were seen, and there were remains of burnt-out native fires, around some of
which he counted no less than twenty-three heaps of emu feathers. A few days
before he started on his return he met three natives, a man, woman, and child;
the man ran to a tree and climbed up it, the woman and child remaining
terrified at the apparition of a white man. Evans succeeded in getting on good
terms with the child, but the man in the tree cried so loudly that he might
have been heard half a mile away. On June 1st Evans, after carving his name and
the date upon a tree, left the Lachlan River on his return to Bathurst, where
he arrived on June 12th.</p>
<p>In 1817 Governor Macquarie ordered Lieutenant Oxley, the Surveyor-General,
to trace the courses of the two rivers, the Lachlan and the Macquarie, and to
"ascertain their final termination." In company with Oxley, there went on this
expedition Evans; Fraser, to collect plants for Lord Bathurst; Parr, who acted
as mineralogist to the party; and Allan Cunningham.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER VI</h3>
<h4>ALLAN CUNNINGHAM</h4>
<p>Allan Cunningham, who brought back from his travels on land and sea such a
plentiful store of the floral wealth of the continent, was a "Botanical
Collector" for the Royal Gardens at Kew, and was admirably fitted not only by
his scientific training but by his own untiring energy and devotion to his task
for the work which has rendered him famous. The hardships which he endured
during his Australian researches seem to have shortened his life, and indeed a
glance at his portrait, reproduced on another page, suggests that nature had
scarcely equipped him for the tremendous physical strain which his long
explorations imposed upon him.</p>

<h4>ALLAN CUNNUNGHAM</h4>
</center>
<p>His journal, bound in one large volume, is in the Natural History Museum at
South Kensington, and the full extracts which will be found in the following
pages are now published, as far as the author knows, for the first time. It is
a diary of his work day by day for a period of less than two years out of the
many that he spent in New South Wales, where he was to end his life. He sent
home many letters and notes[*] describing discoveries of importance; yet of all
the records he has left this book is the most human.</p>
<blockquote>[* The diary and the reports of Cunningham are too voluminous to be
printed <i>in extenso</i> in such a volume as this, but all essential portions
are either quoted verbatim or in a slightly abbreviated form.]</blockquote>
<p>It begins shortly after his arrival in the colony, when he had made his home
at Parramatta, and tells of his first advance with Lieutenant Oxley's
expedition into the interior of a country which he was afterwards to penetrate
again and again, exploring its vast distances, making new discoveries, and
closely examining its flora. In turning over the pages of this old book, the
very scent of the flowers, the splendour of their colours, and the delicate
tracery of the ferns, seem to pervade it and carry us back to the time when, as
a young man of six-and-twenty, Allan Cunningham landed in Sydney and first
began to make his collections of plants and seeds.</p>
<p>He was of Scottish extraction, his father, Allan Cunningham, being a native
of Renfrewshire. His mother, whose maiden name was Dickin, came of a Shropshire
family. The elder Allan Cunningham was her second husband; she was married to
him on August 20, 1790, and she bore him two sons, both of whom were to end
their lives in New South Wales: Allan was born at Wimbledon on July 13, 1791,
and Richard on February 12, 1793. Both went to school at Putney, and after
Allan's schooldays were over he spent some time in a conveyancer's office in
Lincoln's Inn, but the study of law did not sufficiently appeal to him and he
gladly accepted a situation at Kew as clerk to Mr. W. T. Aiton, then at work on
the second edition of the "Hortus Kewensis."</p>
<p>Here Allan Cunningham often met Robert Brown (late botanist of H.M.S.
"Investigator"), librarian to Sir Joseph Banks, who had charge of the "Hortus
Kewensis" through the press; and, doubtless from Brown, Cunningham gained at
first hand much information concerning the flora of Australia. In 1814 he
received his appointment as Botanical Collector to the Royal Gardens and left
Plymouth with James Bowie on October 29th, in H.M.S. "Duncan" (74), Captain
Chambers, for Brazil.</p>
<p>Rio de Janeiro was sighted on Christmas Day, and a few days later the two
botanists landed and spent three months collecting specimens in the surrounding
country. In April, 1815, they started for San Paulo, where they arrived after a
month of hard travelling through rough country. They returned to Rio in August
and spent twelve months in collecting plants in the neighbourhood, sending home
both dried and living specimens. Cunningham then received orders from Sir
Joseph Banks to sail to New South Wales, while Bowie was to proceed to the Cape
of Good Hope. The former took his passage in the ship "Surrey" and reached
Sydney Cove on December 20, 1816, after a voyage of ninety-five days. He landed
on the following day and proceeded at once to report his arrival to Governor
Macquarie, then living at Parramatta, who gave him a very kind reception.
Shortly afterwards he hired a cottage and took up his residence at Parramatta,
where he seems to have lived during the earlier part of his stay in the
colony.</p>
<p>He tells us that, on paying his first visit to the Governor, General
Macquarie had hinted that an expedition (under the command of Mr. Oxley) to
explore further to the westward of the Blue Mountains was in contemplation;
that it would be composed of ten individuals, and strongly recommended him to
join it, being convinced that "an infinite number of new and interesting
specimens of plants might be detected in the several districts through which it
might pass." Cunningham determined not to miss so favourable an opportunity of
seeing the interior, and, matters being amicably arranged with Mr. Oxley, he
began his preparations for the journey which was to prove the forerunner of
many tours of exploration.</p>
<p>At first Cunningham was content to accompany expeditions as the botanist
attached to the party, but before long he found that he himself possessed the
inclination and skill to become a leader in exploration. On his long journeys
into new and strange country he was gradually attracted, not only by the
fascination of its botany, but by its unknown mountain ranges, its distant
plains, and its curious rivers winding within their deep, torn banks over beds
of sand. He soon seems to have determined to investigate them, and about the
year 1822, starting under his own leadership and using his own methods to
penetrate the bush, he began his work as an explorer, with the same zeal that
he bestowed upon his botanical researches. How well his efforts were rewarded
and how great the measure of success which crowned his labours the discoveries
of Pandora's Pass, the Darling Downs, Cunningham's Gap, the Gwydir, the
Dumaresq, and the Condamine Rivers will sufficiently bear witness.</p>
<p>His long voyages with Captain King to the north and northwest coasts
afforded him increased opportunities for studying the botany of the mainland,
and his visits to Tasmania and New Zealand added greatly to his knowledge of
lands beyond the limits of the continent itself.</p>
<p>Like a true botanist, Cunningham took pains that not distant England alone
should reap the benefit of his toil. During his many journeys into the bush
over miles of trackless country he sowed various kinds of seeds in Australian
soil in scattered areas, choosing localities where he believed the plants would
best germinate and thrive. These seeds he had brought with him from England,
from Brazil, and from the Cape, his last port of call before landing at Sydney.
So that, in after years, many people on perceiving a single specimen of some
strange plant flourishing alone in the native earth in an isolated spot have
wondered why and how it came there. Probably the ornamental <i>Aga\ve
americana</i> growing at the foot of the hill whereon stands the old Church of
the Holy Trinity at Kelso sprang from seed thus sown; and, if so, it is in
itself a fitting memorial to Cunningham.</p>

<h4>A PRIMROSE FROM ENGLAND</h4>
</center>
<p>One day when conversing with Dr. Lang on this subject he said: "I always
carry into the interior a small bagful of peach-stones" (in his journals he
enumerates various fruit stones and seeds), "and whenever I find a piece of
good soil in the wilderness I cause it to be dug up and drop in a few in the
hope of providing a meal for some famished European...or some hungry
blackfellow." In Sydney and around Parramatta he was equally eager to
distribute seeds of English flowers--usually specimens of the commoner
kinds--to those earlier generations of Australians who thus learned to love the
primrose, the wallflower, and the violet, as had their forefathers, and to
cultivate the English rose, all of which gave colour and lent influence in
forming the minds of the children, many of whom were destined to make their
homes in that very wilderness, and to plant their gardens there.</p>
<p>How much the flowers meant too to those British people who had left their
native land perhaps Hopley's picture which we reproduce, best will show.</p>
<p>Though Oxley's "Journal of Exploration into the Interior" in 1817 has long
been printed, we read an entirely new account of his travels in Cunningham's
diary. Fresh as he was from Brazil, he is able to give us with a more
experienced mind his impressions of the plants and flowers that he saw growing
upon the Blue Mountains, at Bathurst, in the country watered by the Macquarie
and Lachlan, and also on the north-west coast, and to compare them with those
already seen by Robert Brown on the eastern side of the mountains and in
Northern Australia.</p>
<p>Cunningham's diary, which begins while he was residing at Parramatta, runs
as follows.</p>
<h4>ALLAN CUNNINGHAM'S JOURNAL</h4>
<h4>BOTANIZING AT PARRAMATTA, MARCH, 1817</h4>
<p><i>1817. March 1st. Saturday.</i> Dull cloudy weather. Prevented from
stirring out of doors. Small mistling rain most part of the day.</p>
<p>Evening fair, light clouds.</p>
<p><i>2nd, Sunday.</i> Showery in the early part of the morning. Fine and clear
at 9 o'clock. Continued so the whole of the day.</p>
<p><i>3rd. Monday.</i> Morning very fine; went on board the Brig Kangaroo and
saw Captain Jeffreys who informed me that he could not sail before the 16th or
17th inst. Returned on shore in consequence of an invitation to dine with His
Excellency in the afternoon.</p>
<p><i>4th. Tuesday.</i> This day was occupied on the Botany Bay Road. Gathered
on the roadside duplicate seeds of <i>Tetratheca sp.</i> On the damp sandy
camps gathered specimens of <i>Banksia oblongifolia</i> and seeds of
<i>Petrophila Pulchella.</i> In dry forest lands near the Bay I gathered
specimens of <i>Dodonaea cuneata,</i> a new species, a small shrub; observed in
the deep waters near the road an aquatic plant in flower, perhaps <i>A
ctinocarpus</i> of Brown's Prodrs. Cor. 3, petals white, anthers and styles
yellow.</p>
<p><i>5th. Wednesday</i>. Papering my seeds and specimens.</p>
<p><i>8th. Saturday.</i> Ticketing and packing the remaining of my specimens.
Having visited the North Rocks near Parramatta but twice since I had been in
New South Wales and desirous of augmenting my seed list I made an excursion to
them at 12 o'clock. Gathered seeds of <i>Ceratopetalum gummiferum</i>
(Christmas Bush);[*] seeds of an annual plant of the <i>Asperifolia</i>.;
<i>Aster sp</i>., a very slender herbaceous plant; duplicate seeds of <i>Panax
sp</i>., often before observed with some ferns, among which is a singular
<i>Acrostichum</i> [leather fern]. On my return, gathered species of <i>Epacris
sp.</i> [an Australian heath], flowers very large, white.</p>
<blockquote>[* Although called a bush, it is really a tree, attaining a height
of thirty to forty feet. It belongs to the natural order <i>Saxifrageae</i>.
The generic name is taken from two Greek words meaning a horned petal. It is
confined to the State of New South Wales.]</blockquote>
<p><i>10th. Monday.</i> I made an excursion early this morning to the Pennant
Hills about 8 miles from Parramatta. In rocky valleys at the base of these
hills I gathered seeds of a handsome shrub of the genus <i>Exocarpus</i>, and
perhaps the species discovered by Labillardi&egrave;re in Van Diemen's Island
in 1793 and called by him <i>E. expansa</i>; much the habit of <i>Taxus</i>,
receptacle of the fruit larger than <i>E. cupressiformis</i> [native cherry]
and of a deep purple colour. <i>Exocarpus cupressiformis,</i> specimens in
flower, and <i>Baeckia densifolia</i>, abundant on damp rocks.</p>
<p><i>11th. Tuesday.</i> Prevented from stirring out of doors. Heavy rain at
night.</p>
<p><i>13th. Thursday.</i> Morning fair but cloudy. Repapering[*] my specimens,
seeds etc. Having heard of the arrival of the Ships Fame and Sir Wm. Bensley
from London and desirous of ascertaining whether they had brought any letters
for me, I went down to Sydney but found none had arrived...</p>
<blockquote>[* Changing the papers in which the specimens were dried from damp
to dry sheets.]</blockquote>
<p><i>17th. Monday.</i> The whole of the day was employed on an immense tract
of land beyond the Camp at Parramatta but met with but little success. The late
heavy rains had destroyed nearly the whole of the seeds that were ripe as well
as the flowering specimens. Gathered seeds of an <i>Elaeocarpus</i>, a small
tree, on the banks of the north creek etc., in low damp situations.</p>
<p><i>19th. Wednesday.</i>&gt; Took a walk a short distance on the Camp,
gathered seeds of <i>Patersonia sericea</i>; <i>Goodenia sp.</i>, a small
herbaceous plant; and a species of <i>Hypoxis</i>, a small liliaceous plant,
found among grass.</p>
<p><i>20th. Thursday.</i> An opportunity offering of a pack horse going up to
Bathurst, I sent forward a specimen press and some paper to remain at the
depo~t till my arrival.</p>
<p><i>21st. Friday.</i> Morning particularly calm, fine and clear. I occupied
myself this day examining the botanical productions of a rocky creek in the
environs of Baulkham Hills, about 5 miles north-west of Parramatta; collected
seeds of the following plants:</p>
<p>1. <i>Jasminoides (= Lycium</i>), a twining shrub not unlike <i>Jasminum
gracile</i>(H.K.), but the berry is many seeded.</p>
<p>2. <i>&gt;Veronica sp.</i>, a small creeping rock plant, flowers blue.</p>
<p>3. <i>Cissus sp.</i>, leaves quinated, leaflets ovate-oblong, glaucous
beneath; a twining shrub.</p>
<p>4. <i>Baeckia sp.</i>, allied to <i>&gt;B. densifolia</i>, a low depressed
shrub, in damp situations.</p>
<p>It being far advanced in the afternoon before I could return to Baulkham
Hills, having gone along the margins of the creek several miles, I passed the
evening and night at the little farming establishment of a friend.</p>
<p><i>22nd. Saturday.</i> I returned to Parramatta this morning.</p>
<p><i>24th. Monday.</i> This day I finally packed my seeds and specimens.
Writing letters to the Right Hon. Sir J. Banks and W. T. Aiton, Esqr.,
informing them among other matters of the shipping of a box of specimens and
seeds on board H.M. Armed Brig "Kangaroo," bound for England direct. Enclosing
copy of journal from September last to the end of last month, together with an
account of my disbursements.</p>
<p><i>25th. Tuesday.</i> Having placed my box on board the daily passage boat,
in order to be forwarded to Sydney Cove, I went down myself by land. In the
afternoon I ship'd my collection on board the Kangaroo brig, which is expected
to sail in a few days.</p>
<p><i>26th. Wednesday.</i> Bright clear day. Heat moderate.</p>
<p><i>27th. Thursday.</i> Waited (on the 26th) on the Governor but could not
see him, His Excellency being much engaged at this period forming his
despatches for England.</p>
<p><i>31st. Monday.</i> This dayIreceived a letter from the Deputy-Surveyor
stating that next Thursday has been fixed upon as the day on which the
remaining persons composing the expedition should proceed forward from
Parramatta and begging me to hold myself in readiness on that day.</p>
<p><i>1817. April 1st. Tuesday.</i> Remained within doors all the day--writing
forward journal.</p>
<p><i>2nd. Wednesday.</i> This day I conveyed my chest and boxes to the
Government store-house and placed them under the care of the storekeeper until
my return from the intended journey.</p>
<h4>JOURNEY OVER THE WESTERN OR BLUE MOUNTAINS</h4>
<p><b><i>Parramatta to Bathurst, 3-19 April, 1817</i></b></p>
<p><i>April 3rd. Thursday.</i> Although I have not received from the Right Hon.
Sir J. Banks or Mr. Aiton any instructions to direct me in my duties in this
country, still I should feel by no means justified in allowing so very
favourable an opportunity now offering itself to pass by, and more especially
as the natural history of the western interior of the continent is becoming
daily more important and interesting to the Mother Country.</p>
<p>Considering the small portion of this vast continent yet known, and that
imperfectly to a few individuals, and the large tract of country we may
necessarily plod over in our endeavour towards accomplishing the primary and
grand object on account of which the expedition (to which I have attached
myself) has been formed, I anticipate much in my department and pursuits, and
have endeavoured to guard against those inconveniences (which I have
experienced on former journeys) by furnishing myself with moderate-sized
portable saddle bags, and specimen cases, well canvassed over and painted, for
the reception and protection of those treasures that the interior of this
country may afford me. Mr. Evans, Assistant-Surveyor, arrived the last evening
here at Parramatta in order to make arrangements relative to an extra cart for
the conveyance of the remaining part of our luggage to Bathurst, intending to
proceed forward on our route for that settlement to-morrow morning.</p>
<p><i>4th. Friday.</i> About 9 o'clock this morning we sent the two carts with
the people forward, in order if possible to arrive on the right bank of the
Nepean River (a distance of about 21 miles) this evening. We (Mr. Evans and
myself) finally left Parramatta about 10 o'clock, passed the cluster of farms
at Prospect Hill about midday, and were obliged to swim our horses over the
South Creek, which although considerably abated, presents at this time a rapid
stream of water of considerable depth, its wooden bridge having been carried
away by the late floods. About 4 o'clock in the afternoon we arrived at the
Ferry on the Nepean River, where we stopped for the night.</p>
<p>The road over which we passed this day, which is bounded by open forest
land, is tolerably good considering the recent heavy rains that have fallen
upon it and the waters that cross it in the slight hollows formed by the gentle
risings of the country. The botany, with very few exceptions, is the same as
that observed in similar situations in the environs of Parramatta. I have,
however, gathered specimens of a <i>Prostanthera</i>, a dwarfish shrub with
small purple flowers; a species of <i>Persoonia</i>, forming a small shrub with
linear leaves is likewise in flower, and a species of <i>Erodium</i> is
abundant in the pathway. <i>Dodonaea filiformis</i>, seen but sparingly in open
woods near Botany Bay, is very abundant on each side of the river, in young
fruit. From the difficulty experienced in passing the South Creek, our loaded
carts, which we had passed on the road, could not overtake us this day.</p>
<p><i>5th. Saturday.</i> In consequence of our carts being unable to pass the
South Creek the last evening, we were detained the whole of this day at the
Ferry House. It afforded me an opportunity of examining the botanical
productions on the immediate banks of the river, which, however, were by no
means interesting. These are clothed with spreading trees of the <i>Melia
Azedarach</i> commonly termed by the settlers "white cedar." It was in fruit.
<i>Casuarina torulosa</i> and some common <i>Eucalypti</i> are the whole of the
arborescent plants I observed. The late floods had made such dreadful ravages
in the banks, which had been overflowed to a very considerable depth, as to
leave me no herbaceous plants of any consideration.</p>
<p><i>6th. Sunday.</i> Our carts and people having arrived this morning, we
ferried our luggage over the river (which at this period is not less than 90
feet wide) and pitched our tent on the opposite or left bank. Our horses, which
had escaped from the paddock in which they were encircled, were not secured
till too late to swim them over to our encampment.</p>
<p><i>7th. Monday.</i> This morning we swam our horses and bullocks over the
river, and only waited the arrival of the Surveyor-General, John Oxley, Esq.
(the chief of the expedition) to join us, according to agreement, in order to
proceed on our journey. The banks on the Nepean abound with a species of
<i>Arum</i> known in England by the name of <i>A. Orixense</i> [it is now known
as <i>Typhonium Brownii</i>, Schott] differing from <i>A. trilobatum</i> in
having a pedunculated spathe, which is longer than the spadix. Like its
congeners, its flower has a fetid smell, and its root is of the most acrid
taste and irritating quality so common to the genus, but boiled or roasted it
is a nutritive vegetable equal to <i>Caladium esculentum</i> or buckra yam of
our West Indian colonies. It is however but small. In an excursion I made down
the river on its left bank, the following are the most remarkable plants that
came within my notice and observation.</p>
<p><i>Phytolacca pentandra</i>, an herbaceous plant of the habit of <i>P.
dioica</i>; Native Elder, habit of <i>Sambucus</i>, specimens of which I sent
to England per "Kangaroo," <i>Clerodendron sp</i>., a small tree 12-18 feet
high, in fruit; <i>Senecio sp.</i>, a tall herbaceous plant, in low swampy
spots. The forests near the river are at this period altogether unproductive of
any botanical subject for the collector. They abound with an abundance of the
white cockatoo and a few flying squirrels.</p>
<p><i>8th. Tuesday Morning.</i> We sent our men and carts forward westerly to
the depo~t at Springwood, a distance of about 12 miles in the mountains, and
were ourselves in the fullest hopes of overtaking them at that resting place in
the evening. Mr. Evans and self were detained the whole of the day waiting the
arrival of Mr. Oxley.</p>
<p><i>9th. Wednesday.</i> Frosty: atmosphere fresh and sharp. Mr. Oxley had not
arrived to join us and aware that we were one day behind our carts, we left
directions with the man at the ford to inform Mr. Oxley we would wait one day
for him at the second day's halting post--at the 28th mile mark--and commenced
our route from Emu Plains about ten o'clock. The road to the foot of the
mountains is through the open wooded flat called Emu Plains, so named probably
from numbers of those birds having been found here at the formation of the
colony, and when the country had been cleared and opened this far inland. The
timber is small and consists of the <i>Eucalypti</i> observed about Parramatta.
The ascent from the plains is very gentle, leading through fine avenues of
trees of tolerable size formed by the new road which is of easy and slightly
curved form and of convenient width.</p>
<p>About one o'clock we passed the depo~t at Springwood, which is remarkable
for the good grassy pasturage and lofty handsome timber with which this resting
place is surrounded. <i>Eucalyptus robusta</i> (white or swamp mahogany) and
<i>E. resinifera</i>; (red mahogany), and <i>Casuarina torulosa</i> (River
Oak), are predominant, with another species of Eucalyptus called by the
colonists "Stringy Bark." Our carts had left this depo~t early this morning for
the next stage, where we were all to meet at night. About 3 miles onward there
is an obvious change in soil and in the appearance of the timber, the former
being barren and rocky and the latter becoming stunted and diminutive. In these
sterile tracts many of the plants common about Sydney and Parramatta appear to
very fine effect. Among them I observed a species of <i>Podolobium</i>
[Oxylobium] in pod, it appears distinct from <i>P. trilobatum</i> in the
formation of the lateral lobes of the foliage, which are entire as well as
bifurcated and spinous.</p>
<p>Near the 18th mile mark, is an open and extremely bleak and barren part near
the road side. Upon a small eminence of rugged ascent stands a pile of stones
supposed to have been erected by the indefatigable and persevering botanist Mr.
George Caley, and suspected to be his farthermost advancement westward in a
grand botanical excursion which he had undertaken with a view of crossing the
mountains. His Excellency in passing this place on his route to Bathurst in the
year 1815 called it Caley's Repulse. The country is now very rugged and
mountainous, and the road difficult, which in one place is formed by means of a
wooden bridge over a gully, reflecting great credit upon the persons to whom
its formation was entrusted by His Excellency for their judgment and
perseverance in this difficult undertaking. Near the 20th. mile is an extensive
flat or plain, which His Excellency in the journey above referred to, has
called the King's Table Land. This exposed situation is covered with the shrub
<i>Eucalyptus microphylla</i> [= <i>Eucalyptus stellulata</i>], forming thick
brushes of underwood. This plain is considered as the summit of the western
mountains, and from them a very extensive panoramic view presents itself of the
country around us. On the S.W. side of the plain the mountain terminates in
abrupt precipices of very considerable depth, at the bottom of which is seen a
glen or ravine which the Governor has termed the Prince Regent's Glen. The
length of this picturesque and remarkable tract of country is estimated at 24
miles.</p>
<p>Onward two miles we arrived at dusk at a wooden house, erected originally as
a store for the preservation of provisions for the use of the men working on
the road, and now converted into an half-way house, being 28 miles from Emu
Ford. Our people had already arrived there and had kindled a large fire. The
soil is now for the most part of a sandy grit, compounded of fragments of iron
and sand-stone, in which, with a little peat, the finest specimens of
Australian botany flourish.</p>
<p>I observed specimens of <i>Persoonia</i> with filiform leaves, agreeing in
specific character with <i>P. microcarpa</i>. <i>Stylidium setaceum</i>, a very
delicate plant, abundant on the wayside. On bare rocks <i>Chloranthus
stoechadis</i> is very luxuriantly in flower. Some shrubs of the habit of
<i>Boronia</i>, with pinnate and ternate leaves, grew very abundant on the
roadside near the 26th mile mark: they were, however, not in flower. This
evening we were joined by Mr. Oxley at our resting place at the 28th mile mark.
Some boggy slopes at the back of our Wooden House have been called Lewis's or
Jamieson's Plains.</p>
<p><i>10th. Thursday.</i> Mr. Oxley ascertained by the assistance of the
barometer, which he had brought with him, the height of the spot where we
halted the last evening to be 2,984 feet and from the circumstance of King's
Table Land being several feet higher we calculated it to be upwards of 3,000
ft. above the level of the sea. We availed ourselves of the clearness of the
morning and freshness of the atmosphere, and while our people were loading the
carts walked onward to the 33rd. mile, where, at the top of a hill, an opening
presents to us a grand romantic expanse of country; mountains running beyond
mountains to the very verge of the horizon, striking the beholder with
admiration and astonishment. We have here a S.W. view of the Prince Regent's
Glen. On account of the circular form in which the nearest or fore ground below
us is disposed the Governor in his tour was induced to call it Pitt's
Amphitheatre.</p>
<p>We halted here until our people with our carts came up to us. In taking a
general view of the botany of the country around, which is thickly wooded with
brush and small diminutive timber of Eucalypti, there appeared the following
among the many plants very frequent in the environs of Sydney. <i>Platylobium
nova sp.</i>, with the habit of <i>P. parviflorum</i>, the leaves however are
ovate, netted and silky beneath. The <i>Boronia</i> seen yesterday is very
abundant in the sterile sands. <i>Stylidium setaceum</i>, with <i>Arethusa
sp.</i>, similar to the <i>Arethusa</i> figured in the last collection, were
very fine in flower among the rocky grassy spots on the roadside. We did not
notice <i>Lambertia formosa</i>, which is very frequent on the Blue Mountains,
farther westward than about the 32nd mile mark. Continuing our route on the new
road which runs on the main edge of the mountains and forms one side of the
Prince Regent's Glen, we arrived at an open but low bushy tract of country,
which His Excellency had named Hounslow Heath, although it is frequently termed
Blackheath. Our carts and people were far behind us, occasioned by the rugged
uneven state of the country. We therefore were obliged to halt for the day on
this heath near the 41st mile mark. The water here is far from being good, it
is the drainage of the low black peats which constitute the soil of the slopes
from the heath. I furnished myself with specimens of a species of
<i>Grevillea</i>, remarkable for the beauty of its flowers and the laciniated
spinous habit of its foliage, which I have termed <i>G. acanthifolia</i>: a
species of <i>Pimelea</i>, differing from <i>P. glauca</i> in having long
filaments supporting the anthers, as in <i>P. filamentosa</i>, is likewise
abundant.</p>
<p><i>11th. Friday.</i> Cloudy morning. Proceeding forward on our journey the
road continued for the space of 9 miles on the main range, where it abruptly
terminates in almost a perpendicular precipice, down which a tolerably easy and
practicable road has been formed, which has been called by the Governor Cox's
Pass, and through all its windings cannot be less than &frac34; of a mile. By
admeasurement this abrupt termination of the mountains westerly proved to be
676 feet above the valley below it, which His Excellency has termed the Vale of
Clwydd, from its resemblance and local situation being surrounded by mountains
like that in North Wales. The retrospect view from the vale of the overhanging
mountain is exceedingly grand and magnificent. At this point of view is
observed the termination of a ridge that has the appearance of a very lofty
distant hill, which the Governor has called Mount York, and which Mr. Oxley
found by his barometer to be elevated above the level of the sea 3218 feet.</p>
<p>The Vale of Clwydd although boggy in some places has a rich soil, producing
good grass, and in other respects is excellent pastureland. Here we observed
the very remarkable change of country, differing from that on the mountains
both in the vegetable productions and the nature of the soil. <i>Banksia
serrata</i> ceases to exist farther west than the summit of Mount York, and
<i>B. compar</i> succeeds it throughout the vale, of stubby arborescent growth
in flower and fruit. This species of <i>Banksia</i> is perhaps only a variety
of <i>B. integrifolia</i>. <i>Eucalyptus Perfoliata</i> (H.K.) is very
frequent, and another species with some leaves cordate and sessile and others
lanceolate and inserted on a petiole. <i>Podolepis acuminata</i>: <i>Hibbertia
cuneata</i>, with large yellow flowers: <i>Campanula sp.</i>, with large blue
flowers and undulate bristly leaves: a species of <i>Buchnera</i> with yellow
flowers: <i>Helichrysum sp.</i>, allied to <i>H. bracteatum</i>, are all now
very common plants, from Cox's Pass westerly. The rocks and shaded humid
situations in the Pass afforded me specimens and seeds of <i>Stylidium
longifolium</i>. A dwarf syngenesious shrub, <i>Baccharis arguta</i> is in
seed: gathered seeds of <i>Epacris spicata</i> from plants growing in tufts in
shaded situations. <i>Acrostichum sp.</i>, having a sterile frond, a plant
observed in glens near Botany Bay, is found here in great abundance on these
shaded rocks with a species of <i>Polypodium</i> [Polypody Fern], with glossy
laciniated coriaceous fronds. In Cox's Pass there is a kind of indurated
pipeclay in lamina that might be turned to some ornamental or useful purpose by
the sculptor. Some specimens which we collected of it worked as easily as
chalk. Our people converted them into oil stones. We are now about 80 English
miles from Sydney.</p>
<p>The mile-mark numbers begin afresh from the Pass to Bathurst. Passing
through the Vale for about 5 miles we arrived at Cox's River, which is formed
by a rivulet of fine water running to the eastward over a very stony bottom,
and uniting itself with another stream at the western extremity of the vale,
and from thence the junction takes its course through the Prince Regent's Glen
and empties itself into the Nepean River. At this river we first observed
granite, of which its bed is composed. <i>Grevillea acanthifolia</i> and <i>G.
asplenifolia</i>, frequent on the margins of creeks on the eastern coast, grow
on the banks of this river in the greatest luxuriance. Here is a dep&ocirc;t
and store house under the charge of a corporal and 2 privates. We pitched our
tent on the right bank of the river and halted for the night. Our barometer
informed us that we had descended about 430 feet from the base of Mount York.
In the Vale of Clwydd I gathered seeds and specimens of a shrubby <i>Aster</i>
the flowers of which are of a bluish white colour.</p>
<p><i>12th. Saturday.</i> Ascending from the river we continued our route
westerly over a range of hills of difficult and fatiguing descent, which the
Governor has named Clarence's Hilly Range, generally open forest land and
tolerably good for grazing. The plants on this hilly district appear to differ
very little from those before observed. <i>Daviesia latifolia</i>, a shrub
first discovered in Van Diemen's Land is the most prevalent plant: a remarkable
shrub, evidently from its distinct stipulae one of the <i>Rubiaceae</i>, is by
no means rare; it is, however, not in flower at this time. Some large specimens
of timber of the <i>Eucalypti</i>, which from the character of the capsule
appear to be of the genus <i>Eudesmia</i>, are frequent. About 2 o'clock we
arrived at the Fish River, on the western side of Clarence's Hilly Range, a
stage of 16 miles--very severe and oppressive to our horses, the whole being
sharp lofty hills and narrow boggy valleys, alternately. In one of the deep
vales I gathered specimens of a species of <i>Arenaria</i>, with long white
flowers and rigid sharp leaves: a species of <i>Epilobium</i>, agreeing in all
its characters with <i>E. angustifolium</i>, is very frequent.</p>
<p>About 3 miles to the westward of Cox's River three remarkable hills
connected together present themselves. The Governor desirous of commemorating
the names of the three first individuals who penetrated thus far to the
westward has called them Mount BlaxIand, Wentworth's Sugar Loaf, and Lawson's
Sugar Loaf. <i>Acacia melanoxylon</i> [Blackwood of N.S.W.], a native of Van
Diemen's Land, is to be seen occasionally here. It is arborescent, and is
remarkable for the singular character of its seed being attached to the
interior of the legumen by a coloured plicated umbilical cord. We had no time
to examine the nature of the wood, the heart of which is said to be black. We
pitched our tent for the night on the right bank of the Fish River. On the
banks of this river, which, like Cox's River, has a stony bed, I gathered seeds
of a <i>Cnicus</i> with laciniated leaves and a long tap or fusiform root, and
seeds of a <i>Limnanthemum</i> smaller than <i>Helichrysum bracteatum</i>.
<i>Grevillea cinerea</i> is very frequent on the rocky banks of the river in
situations that have been recently inundated. Our people with their hooks
caught some fish of about 2&frac12; or 3 lbs. weight, which we found had a very
fine flavour. It has a strong dorsal fin and appears to belong to the
<i>Perca</i> (Perch) family.[*] Mr. Oxley ascertained by the barometer that the
Fish River is 409 feet above Cox's River, and about 2570 feet above the sea
level.</p>
<blockquote>[* The native perch of the inland rivers is named the " Australian
Bass " to distinguish it from the estuary perch (<i>Percalates colonorum</i>)
from which species it seems to have evolved, and because it closely resembles
the "Large Mouth Bass" of North America.]</blockquote>
<p><i>13th. Sunday.</i> The frost of the last night severe. Proceeding forward,
having previously forded the Fish River, the country continues uneven and
hilly, covered with small timber, and generally speaking is good pasturage in
an open forest land. About 8 miles west of the Fish River is a fine spacious
valley running N.W. and S.E., bounded by hills of easy ascent and thinly
covered with timber. This vale, which the Governor has called Sidmouth Valley,
is an exceeding fine and rich grassy spot. <i>Lotus major</i> [Bird's foot
Trefoil], and <i>Bellis sp.</i> (or <i>Cotula</i>), with some grasses, is here
in the greatest strength and luxuriance, all indicative of the excellence of
the soil. In some wet boggy situations I observed a species of <i>Lythrum</i>,
in habit and character agreeing with <i>L. salicaria</i> [Purple Loosestrife]
of Britain, but differing in the flower not being dodecandrous. Onward,
diminutive forest lands prevail, beyond which are open rising grounds and fine
grassy plains. <i>Banksia compar</i>, <i>Acacia melanoxylon</i>, with
<i>Eucalyptus perjoliata</i>, <i>E. globulus</i> etc., are very frequent. Near
the 32nd mile mark from Cox's River is a small but exceedingly sterile patch of
land where I gathered specimens of <i>Aster speciosus</i>, a fine shrubby plant
with azure flowers: seeds and specimens of <i>Helichrysum albicans</i>;
<i>Dianella speciosa</i> [Broadleaved Flax Lily], a plant with elongated
foliaceous stems, supporting several blue flowers. At a small distance from the
Fish River a very remarkable mountain attracts the notice of the traveller on
account of the large stone or rock with which it is crowned. This singular
mountain has been called by the Governor, Mount Evans. Our cart-horses and oxen
being much fatigued with the labours of this day, we stopped and pitched our
tent on the banks of a creek near the 34th mile mark from Cox's Pass.</p>
<p><i>14th. Monday.</i> Anxious to reach the settlement on Bathurst Plains
early in the day we rode forward with all possible despatch, leaving our carts
and people to advance more leisurely. The country exhibits a continuation of
fine open grazing lands of the same character in point of timber as was
observed yesterday. At five miles distant from our last night's encampment we
arrived at Campbell River, which is at this period a moderate stream, although
in dry seasons it has been observed to be only a chain of small waterpools. We
forded this river (the bridge having been carried away by the late floods) and
continued for several miles over a gentle rising hilly sheep country with
grassy valleys until the extensive plains of Bathurst opened to the view. A
short distance south from the line of road which crosses the Campbell River is
a fine rich tract of land called Mitchell's Plains. Near the Fish River, which
forms a junction with the Campbell River some miles north of the road, are two
very fertile plains, the one called O'Connell's Plains, and the other
Macquarie's Plain, both said to be of very considerable extent. The botany has
the same appearance as observed yesterday. A species of <i>Indigofera</i>, with
short obovate pinnated leaves, being the prevailing shrub.</p>
<p>The plains around the settlement at Bathurst are a clear and open tract of
campaign country bounded by gentle hills of easy ascent, thinly wooded, and
well watered by the Macquarie River, which winds through them. The course can
be easily traced by the particular verdure of the <i>Casuarinae</i> (swamp
oaks) on its banks, which in fact are the only trees throughout the extent of
the plain, a circumstance which will be the more severely felt as the
settlement increases in population, firewood being brought in bullock carts
from the considerable distance of 5 or 6 miles.</p>
<p>At about 2 o'clock p.m. we arrived at the Flagstaff on the settlement,
erected by order of the Governor when His Excellency visited these plains in
May, 1815. A superintendent's house, public kitchen, and temporary store have
been erected for the accommodation of the residents there. The site intended
for the town of Bathurst, by observation, taken on the spot, is situated in
lat. 33&deg;24'30" S., and long. 149&deg;1745" E. of Greenwich, being also
about 27&frac12; north of Sydney and 94 west of it, bearing W. 20&deg;30' N. 83
geographical miles--or 90&frac12; statute miles--the measured road from Sydney
to Bathurst being 140 miles or thereabouts. Somewhat more than a mile north of
the road 5 miles west of Campbell River, near the Macquarie River, is a
singular stone of large dimensions. It is a fine piece of quartz and is usually
termed the " White Rock."[*]</p>
<blockquote>[* The name is now given to the locality.]</blockquote>
<p><i>15th. Tuesday.</i> Aware that our stay at Bathurst would be short, and
anxious to take a general view of the botany of these extensive plains, I
started in a south-westerly direction over the hills, but found it very
inconsiderable being confined to a few specimens. <i>Pimelea sp.</i>, allied to
<i>P. glauca</i>, but differing in having long filaments supporting the
anthers, is exceedingly common, accompanying the two syngenesious plants on the
plains. <i>Gnaphalium sp.</i>, suffruticose, leaves ovate, lanceolate,
glandulose, hairy. <i>G. ericaefolium</i>, a small suffruticose plant. On the
hills and forest lands a species of <i>Acacia</i> with oblong-spathulate
leaves, are very frequent, as are now seeds of the <i>Indigofera</i> seen
yesterday. Winding round the plain I intersected the River Macquarie about 5
miles below the settlement and determined to trace it up, with a view of
detecting any plants that grow on its immediate banks, which are as
follows:--<i>Goodenia sp.</i>, with large yellow flowers and laciniate leaves:
<i>Senecio sp.</i>, allied to <i>S. quadridentatus</i> of Labillardi&egrave;re
(<i>Erechthites quadridentata</i>), but the flosculae appear to be 5-toothed:
<i>Senecio sp.</i>, leaves linear-lanceolate, serrated: <i>Helichrysum
alatum</i> [=<i>Ammobium alatum</i>] leaves radical, spathulate, stem alated. A
species of <i>Gnaphalium</i>, frequent on the eastern coast in rich soils, is
likewise abundant here. On a lofty rocky hill called Mount Pleasant I gathered
a species of <i>Aster</i>. I likewise observed a species of <i>Dodonae</i>,
with narrow lanceolate crenulate leaves, in fruit. Near the river that species
of <i>Eucalyptus</i> usually denominated Blue Gum is now in flower. I gathered
specimens of it. The banks are covered with <i>Rubus sp.</i>, same as near
Parramatta and <i>Urtica dioica</i>. I gathered seeds of a <i>Dianella</i>.</p>
<p>In this day's excursion I had an opportunity of observing the general
character of the soil. The hills are covered with a sandy quartzose grit and
fragments of stone that have evidently undergone fusion, while that on the
lower lands and more especially on the banks of the river is very rich and
black and of a considerable depth, formed of decayed vegetable matter, the
depositions of floods that have accumulated from one period to another. The
whole plain may be termed a good cattle ground, although the sandy light aspect
of its surface, and particularly that of the most elevated grounds, conveys no
very flattering ideas of its becoming a grain country of any consideration.
Returned at sunset to the settlement having passed over about 18 miles in a
circuitous route.</p>
<p><i>16th. Wednesday.</i> A drenching rain set in from N.W. early in the
afternoon with thunder and lightning, which continued all the evening.</p>
<p><i>17th. Thursday.</i> Much rain fell during the last night which continued
this morning. Confined indoors.</p>
<p><i>18th. Friday.</i> Being recommended to make an excursion to some brushy
spots north of the Macquarie River I crossed over to the north side in order to
visit the remarkable sterile scrubby tract called Winbourne Dale, bearing N.E.
by E. for several miles, under a lofty range of mountains running nearly east
and west. Having passed over about 5 miles of open rising grassy country I came
to a watercourse termed Winbourne Dale creek, which after many windings empties
itself into the Macquarie River about 20 miles below the settlement. Although
not above 12 feet wide it was deep and the current very strong, occasioned by
the late very heavy rains. Finding it impossible to pass this creek and that
the object in view and the plans laid down in the morning were defeated, I
followed the creek down about 3 miles, in which space it had received 2 or 3
minor streamlets from the northern hills. <i>Arundo phragmites</i> is common on
its banks. A species of <i>Veronica</i> with terminal spikes, leaves opposite,
lanceolate and serrated, is likewise abundant; it is in capsule and furnished
me with seeds.</p>
<p><i>Podolepis rugata</i> is frequent on the more elevated grassy grounds. The
<i>Buchnera</i> with yellow flowers is now in seed. These fine pasture lands
are for the most part unprofitable to the botanical collector.</p>
<p><i>19th. Saturday.</i> The unsettled state of the weather had detained us
longer than we expected at Bathurst but conceiving the waters to have abated
sufficiently to allow our pack-horses to proceed forward to the Lachlan River
we sent five of them from Bathurst this morning laden with provisions, and
luggage, intending to follow them ourselves to-morrow. A species of Xerotes
with leaves round and filiform. and an erect spreading panicle I observed among
the grass on the plains. Near the settlement a dwarf species of
<i>Eryngium</i>, much allied to <i>E. vesiculosum</i> (Labillardi&egrave;re),
is common in patches. It is not in flower. It appears from Mr. Oxley's
observations made by means of the barometer that Bathurst is 558 feet lower
than the Fish River, and about 2,000 feet above the sea level. The nature of
the soil of the plains is seen on the bank of a ditch dug round the Government
Domain. The surface is loam, below sandy, resting on a bed of arenaceous
marl.</p>
<p><b><i>Bathurst to Farewell Hill, 20 April-17 May, 1817.</i></b></p>
<p><i>20th. Sunday.</i> We left the settlement this morning and proceeded on
our journey westerly to the dep&ocirc;t at the Lachlan River. From the Plains
we entered a valley, termed Queen Charlotte's Vale, of considerable length, and
at this period very boggy, occasioned by the late heavy rains. The risings or
ascents of the hills by which it is bounded were very soft and rotten,
rendering the travelling very difficult and distressing to our burdened horses.
In several places our saddle horses sunk up to their girths and hence it became
necessary to dismount and lead them. A considerable portion of sand forms a
component part of the soil of the hills which resting on a bed of clay is
sufficient to retain the humidity near the surface. The herbage of these hills
is a grass (<i>Bromus</i>) interspersed with <i>Gnaphalium cricaefolium</i>
(Everlasting), and with <i>Lotus major</i> [Greater Bird's foot Trefoil]
sparingly, all which plants are likewise abundant in the richer valleys.</p>
<p><i>Daviesia latifolia</i> [Bitter leaf Bush] continues very abundant on the
rising ground. In the wet bays in the valley I observed an <i>Erodium</i>
allied to <i>E. hymenoides</i> [Heron's Bill], with leaves ternate, flowers
blue.</p>
<p>We halted for the night at the usual resting place, 18 miles from Bathurst,
near the extremity of the valley. Our people with the pack horses had arrived
some hours before, and had pitched the tent. <i>Eucalyptus cornuta</i>, rising
about 20 feet, with obovate leaves, at this period is just expanding its
flowers on the sides of the hills.</p>
<p><i>21st. Monday.</i> Fine weather. Resuming our journey about 8 o'clock, the
road continues over a hilly country, in many places boggy, and heavy travelling
for the horses. Among the brush or under shrub with which the hills are covered
I discovered a singular species of <i>Veronica</i>, with glaucous leaves. A
papilionaceous shrub allied to <i>Oxylobium</i>, with cordate villous leaves
was in great abundance. Of the timber that species of <i>Eucalyptus</i> usually
termed "Stringy Bark" with others common on the Eastern Coast, are common on
the hills, and although fine lofty trees were apparently generally hollow and
decayed at their base. The higher lands, which are stony, are nevertheless
tolerable good grazing tracts. We stopped for the evening at the foot of a hill
near a water hole, having travelled about 15 miles from our last night's
encampment and about 321 miles from Bathurst. On the hill, which is covered
with rugged fragments of granite, I saw the shrub of the order <i>Rubiaceae</i>
which I noticed on Clarence's Hilly Range, and on its summit <i>Banksia
compar</i> [= <i>B. integrifolia</i>] is very strong and abundant. It however
ceases to exist beyond this hill westerly. On our left hand two remarkable
points are to be observed. The one called Mount Antill, in honour of Major
Antill (Major of Brigade of the 46th Regt.), and Mehan's Sugarloaf as a
compliment to Mr. James Mehan, Deputy-Surveyor-General in New South Wales.</p>
<p><i>22nd. Tuesday.</i> The frosts of the last night considerable. Water
standing in our vessels throughout the night was covered with ice. A strong
rime on all vegetation. Leaving our last night's halting place we continued our
route over lands slightly elevated and grassy, thickly wooded with timber,
<i>Eucalyptus</i> (Blue Gum) chiefly. In thickly brushy spots <i>Daviesia
latifolia</i> prevails. The soil is a red sandy loam which was here and there
thrown up by the roots of fallen trees. Throughout the whole of this day's
journey there appeared an uniformity in the route observed, being exactly the
same as seen yesterday. About noon we passed a wet grassy valley, from which
Mount Lachlan bore northerly about 3 miles. Its summit appears very sterile
having on it a few stunted trees. Ascending a hill, we had a noble view of a
vast expanse of country to the westward, alternately hill and valley.
Descending the eminence to the valley below, we climbed to the top of Mount
Molle (so named in honour of a late Lieut-Governor), from thence the country
already observed appeared to better advantage. Among the remarkable points
noticed, Mount Lewin and Jamieson's Table Land were not the least conspicuous.
In rocky fissures on Mount Molle I observed a small succulent plant of the
genus <i>Sedum</i>. Descending the western side of the Mount (Molle) into a
very rich and fertile valley, well watered by a running stream in a creek, we
halted for the night. Among the plants seen here, the following are the most
remarkable for the luxuriance of their growth. <i>Lotus sp.</i>, suffruticose,
allied to <i>L. australis</i>, flowers large and almost white. <i>Lotus
major</i> with <i>Sonchus oleraceus</i> are very abundant also <i>Linum
usitatissimum</i>. At a remarkable cascade near Mount Lachlan on the humid
rocks is a slender shrub of the class <i>Syngenesia</i>, and is perhaps a
<i>Cacalia</i>, leaves linear, which, with its branches, are smooth. Our dogs
in chasing some kangaroo killed a large forest buck. Our journey this day was
16 miles. Afternoon fine, a slight incrustation of ice was on the water left in
the pots at night.</p>
<p><i>23rd. Wednesday.</i> Crossing the creek we resumed our journey up a fine
open forest, very little encumbered with timber, of a reddish loamy rich soil,
and thickly clothed with grass. This has been termed Warwick Plains. Observed
westerly, on some elevated grounds a brushwood presents itself, the timber is
closer, and the view much circumscribed. I had often regretted that Southern
Australia affords so very few parasitical plants, which in South America are so
extremely beautiful. I this day observed a cluster of foliage hanging from a
moderate sized <i>Eucalyptus</i>, having the appearance of young leaves that
had been nipped by severe frost. It, however, proves to be a species of
<i>Loranthus</i>, in good health but not in flower or fruit. In a chain of
ponds, on the margin of which we travelled a considerable distance, I observed
<i>Ornithorhynchus paradoxus</i> or water mole occasionally rising to the
surface of the water for respiration and in an instant disappearing. Crossing
these ponds at a rocky creek the country becomes again brushy and barren. I
gathered specimens of the following among others of less moment in these
scrubby tracts.</p>
<p><i>Grevillea sp.</i>, allied to <i>G. Phyllicoides</i> of the eastern coast,
a fine flowering shrub of low stature. <i>Bursaria sp.</i> larger in all its
points than <i>B. spinosa</i> (Cav.), young branches without thorns.
<i>Pullenaea ericaefolia</i> (Dwarf Pultenaea), a handsome shrub. <i>Hibbertia
sp.</i>, discovered before, near Cox's Pass. <i>Acacia obliqua</i> (Persoon), a
shrub about 3 feet high. Descending to the creek called Limestone Creek we
halted and encamped on the opposite bank about 2 o'clock. I availed myself of
the fineness of the day and the early hour and traced the creek through its
various windings about a mile. <i>Metrosideros saligna</i> was fine in flower
in the channel of the watercourse, accompanied by a new species of
<i>Crolon</i> with cordate 3 lobed leaves which I have termed <i>C.
acerifolius</i>, and <i>Cystopteris</i>, [Bladder Fern]. Ascending from the
creek upon the rugged Limestone rocks I discovered a tree of very stunted
growth forming a stem of about 30 inches in diameter or about 7&frac12; feet
circumference, which we suspected to be <i>Sterculia</i>. The same plant was
shown us in June 1815, growing in the Palace Gardens at St. Paul, where it had
grown to the height Of 30 feet but had not flowered. From the best information
we could obtain, and that from a Colonel in the Portuguese Service (an
Englishman lately deceased), I learned that the plant had been brought from New
Holland with others by Captain Woodriffe (not Witherope), of the "Calcutta,"
and they were left at Rio de Janeiro on her passage to England in 1804. From
Rio they were transmitted to St. Paul, and they were planted by the Colonel
himself in the Conde de Palmas Garden in that city.</p>
<p>The trees on these rocks have no appearance of flowers or fruit. The habit
and shapes of foliage in a seedling plant are very different from those of an
old tree. Upon seeing some young plants with palmated leaves (which they lose
by age) I now recollected having seen this <i>Sterculia</i> in some gardens
about London and there considered a Crolon. In shaded damp situations I
gathered specimens of some ferns viz: <i>A crostichum sp.</i>, with the habit
of an <i>A dianium</i>, another species with laciniated glandulose fronds, and
a <i>Pteris</i> with simple fronds of slender habit. The <i>Bursaria</i> above
referred to is the most common shrublet of these rocks, and a <i>Clematis</i>,
before seen, is observed twining itself among the large stones and over the
hanging brows of precipices (not in flower). It is a subject of regret that
these limestone rocks are so far distant from the habitation of man as to be of
no use to him. We are now 63 miles westerly of Bathurst. By way of experiment
we produced some excellent lime by calcination:</p>
<p><i>24th. Thursday.</i> We continued our journey in good time this morning
over a fine, rich, grassy tract of country, which, however, has at this period
rather a bare and naked aspect, having been fired by natives. Passing the burnt
grass and entering thick wooded and high grassy lands we pursued our road,
evidently upon the descent, until we came to a chain of ponds confined in a
long winding deep gully and almost dry. Following these waterholes about 3
miles we came to a rocky hollow containing water, where we halted and pitched
the tent. The soil throughout this day's journey is good and rich, but with not
the least variation in the botany. The country abounds with emu and kangaroo,
of the latter our dogs killed a fine doe. The emu, however, were too swift to
be taken by dogs. Our journey to-day has been 13 miles.</p>
<p><i>25th. Friday.</i> The land westerly from the rocky creek for the space of
6 miles is a continuance of rich forest country abounding in grass. From the
summits of a rocky [hill] you had an extensive landscape of the Western
country. A clear plain, free from timber, called Oxley's Plains, bear a few
miles to the southward and westward of us. We had no difficulty in tracing the
course of the Lachlan westerly, by the darkness of the verdure of the timber on
its banks. This hill is covered with large fragments of fine granite. The
<i>Sterculia</i> seen at Limestone Creek is on this eminence very common, but
without signs of flower or fruit. From a large tree of this genus--at the base
of the hill--that had been cut by a hatchet by way of a mark, I gathered some
resinous gum which had oozed out from beneath the bark. It was whitish and of
the taste of gum arabic. Continuing on the descent for about 6 miles due west,
over a fine grassy forest land, the soil of which is a red loam, rather sandy,
we made the right bank of the Lachlan River about 2 o'clock p.m. Tracing the
river down its banks about 5 miles we arrived at the depo^t where the people
and horses who form the expedition had been waiting our arrival some weeks. Its
banks are very high and clothed with lofty timber of a species of
<i>Eucalyptus</i>, commonly denominated by the colonists Black-butted Gum,[*]
inclining inward so as to form in some places a kind of arch with the heads of
the trees of the same species on the opposite bank. The flats on the lower
grounds near the banks are exceedingly rich and excellent for every purpose of
agriculture, with this exception that they are liable to inundation. The river
had swollen to a very considerable height, and had previous to our arrival
fallen 17 feet, still retaining a considerable fresh or flood above its usual
level and a strong current.</p>
<blockquote>[*Eucalyptus pilularis.]</blockquote>
<p>Our people reported to us that a troop of natives were on the opposite bank.
We immediately went down to the water's edge and beckoned to them to come over
to us, and as an inducement offered them some meat. Thus tempted, they swam
over, and we all went up to the higher grounds on which the depo^t was built.
They were 13 in number, all males of different ages, from beardless youth to
well advanced manhood, and their general outward appearance seemed to differ
but little from those of Sydney. Their hair the same, but their beards are
suffered to grow very long. Their bodies are regularly tattooed, particularly
the breast and shoulders, which are strongly tubercled in a kind of
systernatical diagonal style. Like those of the Eastern coast they perforate
the cartilage of the nose, but I did not see any stick or reed worn through it.
Their dress is simply a grass network, forming a cover to the head, and a belt
of the same network fastened or tied round their loins, in which they have
their "mogo," or stone hatchet, waddies, etc.</p>
<p>One or two had a mantle of the skin of the kangaroo-rat, sewed together with
sinews of the leg, which reached from the shoulders to the middle of the back.
Independent of this they were perfectly naked. They do not use the wamera in
throwing their spears, which are made of a very hard wood and not of the
<i>Xanthorrhoea arborea</i> as on the eastern coast. Their spears have lateral
barbs, the one above the other, the whole is indurated by fire and is a most
dangerous weapon. Although they swam across the river, in which they had to
contend with a strong current, they had brought fire in their hands, and much
time did not elapse before we could perceive the smoke from it issuing from the
centre of the group in which they had formed themselves for mutual warmth. Our
thermometer stood at 56&deg; about this period.</p>
<p>By way of ornament they wore kangaroo teeth in their ears and cockatoo
feathers in their hair. Those of them who were young men had their beards
divided into three divisions and formed into plaited tails. Their language
being very different from that of our Eastern Coast natives, we obtained from
them the names for several things, particularly the parts of the body. I
presented one of them with an English halfpenny having a hole drilled through
it. It was, however, returned to me with clear signs that a piece of kangaroo
flesh would be more acceptable. In fact they appear to appreciate the value of
nothing so much as provisions, particularly flesh, and our iron hatchets, which
would enable them to procure it much better and with more facility than those
made of black jade. They were acquainted with fire-arms, and had (in an
unguarded moment on the part of the soldiers stationed at the depo^t) run off
with two muskets. The subsequent circumstances connected with this theft they
still appear to rue! In an affair between the soldiers and these natives with a
view of recovering the stolen muskets, a poor harmless lad forfeited his
existence. Having abundance of kangaroo, we presented them with the half of a
large buck, which was gratefully received, and with which they returned to
their friends on the opposite side of the river. I gathered specimens of a
<i>Myoporum</i>, smaller than <i>M. ellipticum</i>.</p>
<p><i>26th. Saturday.</i> Having previously repapered my specimens and hung
them out to dry, accompanied by a soldier (armed) I made an excursion down the
river a few miles below the dep&ocirc;t. <i>Croton acerifolius</i>, <i>Rubus
sp.</i>, and <i>Urtica dioica</i> are very abundant on its immediate bank. The
stony rising grounds abound with a plant of the <i>Asperifoliae</i>, allied to
<i>Lithospermum dichotomum</i>. A dwarf shrub of the <i>Epacridaceae</i>,
perhaps a <i>Leucopogon</i>, with a tomentose white calyx, and drupe, is now
very fine in flower. A delicate species of <i>Pullenaea microphylla</i>, with
small cuneated truncated leaves and axillary solitary flowers is found growing
with a shrub advancing to the flowering state, which I suspect is <i>Daviesia
mimosoides</i> of Hortus Kewensis. I likewise got here a specimen of an
<i>Aster</i> with oblong crowded leaves, which are curved at the apex, flowers
white. The summits of the hills are covered with the tree which is termed Pine
by our people. It is in fruit, and proves to be a species of <i>Callitris</i>
and may be the species termed <i>C. australis</i> by Persoon, and is said to be
found on the north side of Port Jackson Harbour. It is from 30 to 70 feet high,
particularly on the flats. I gathered specimens of a very singular species of
<i>Acacia</i>, <i>A. erythrocephala</i>, = <i>A. aspera</i> with
linear-lanceolate leaves. I discovered another shrub of the same genus, <i>A.
armata</i>, with the flowers in axillary spikes. On the low flats near the
river I discovered a species of <i>Dalea</i> with weak trailing stems; a
species of <i>Aster</i> with oblong cuneated leaves. The smoke rising above the
trees from the left bank of the river indicated the presence of natives.</p>
<p><i>7th. Sunday.</i> It having been arranged by Mr. Oxley that our two boats
(that had been built here and intended as an assistance to us in carrying the
more heavy provisions of flour and pork on the river) should proceed down the
stream this morning as far as the creek where Mr. Evans, who first discovered
the Lachlan, had terminated his journey, having been ferried over by the boats,
I visited the rocky hills on the left bank in company with C. Fraser of the
46th Regt., who had been sent as one of our party, in order to form a separate
collection of seeds and specimens for Earl Bathurst. We were both well armed in
case of attack from the natives. Fraser had been before on these hills, in his
pursuits of the Flora (to which he is very much attached) during the period of
time he had been at this dep&ocirc;t, viz: about one month. Having crossed the
grassy flats near the River we ascended the rugged stony hills, where I found
the following interesting plants.</p>
<p><i>Pimelea linifolia</i>, scarcely in flower, a slender gigantic shrub 5 or
6 feet high. <i>Epacridea</i>,: <i>Leucopogon sp.</i>, differing from the
species I discovered yesterday in having a smoother calyx. <i>Campanula
sp.</i>, or a var. of <i>C. gracilis</i>.</p>
<p><i>Bossiaea sp.</i>, with the habit and appearance of <i>B.
microphylla</i>.</p>
<p><i>Hibbertia sp.</i>, allied to <i>H. ovata</i>, leaves sharper and
lanceolate, with a minute asperity, as in <i>H. ovata</i>. The flowers are
decandrous. <i>Aster sp.</i>, herbaceous, flowers blue, leaves filiform.
<i>Aster echinatus</i>, a shrub with linear leaves glandularly echinated on the
upper surface...flowers white. <i>Acacia obliqua</i> is very common on these
sterile hills. <i>Persoonia sericea</i>, with leaves oblong, cuneated, which,
with fruit and branches, are covered with silky hairs. <i>Epacrideae</i>: a
shrub of same genus as above, flowers red. I likewise discovered a new
<i>Acacia</i>, allied to <i>A. albiflora</i>, the icaves are triangular, and
the head of flowers is rounded; and another species with elongated oblong
leaves, attenuated at base, flowers in axillary spikes.</p>
<p><i>Gompholobium latifolium</i> is frequent with the above. In the rich
flats, upon my return to the boat, I gathered some grasses, among which is a
<i>Phleum</i> and in low inundated situations a singular dwarf plant, which I
could not detect in flower, it appears to be <i>Adiantum</i> and is remarkable
for its 4-lobed fronds.</p>
<p>Our boats being loaded with the Government Rations of flour and pork we sent
them down the river with the intention of overtaking them to-morrow afternoon.
By observation taken by Mr. Oxley the site of the dep6t is in lat.
33&deg;39'48" S., and Long. 148&deg;39' E. By barometrical observation it was
ascertained that we were not above 650 feet above the level of the sea, and
that we had descended from Bathurst Plains upwards of 1300 feet. This small
elevation, contrasted with the great distance we were from the nearest point of
the south-west coast, immediately suggested to us the great improbability of
the Lachlan River running to the sea, and its soft muddy banks and general
appearance and character of a periodical stream affording an outlet to the
great body of rain falling on the Blue Mountains, seemed to coincide in the
idea. When Mr. Evans first discovered it in June 1815, which was a dry season,
he crossed it nearly dryshod on the trunk of a fallen <i>Eucalyptus</i>.</p>
<p><i>28th. Monday.</i> Previous to my leaving the eastern coast I had provided
myself with a quantity of peach stones of two qualities, some quince pips or
seeds, and a few acorns, with an intention of committing a few of each to the
earth at any remarkable situation where the soil was tolerably good and
suitable for the growth of them. I sowed some of each at the dep&ocirc;t in the
very rich soil on the bank.</p>
<p>This morning about 9 o'clock the following persons, who composed this grand
Western Expedition, left the last human habitation westward in order to survey
the river downwards and trace it to its supposed junction with the Macquarie,
and the disemboguence of their union on the south-west coast:--Oxley Esqre.
Surveyor-General; Mr. G. W. Evans Assist. do.; Charles Fraser of 46th Regt., as
collector for Lord Bathurst; S. Parr, a boat builder; and seven persons as
loaders of pack horses, and myself. Thirteen in all, with 14 horses and 2
boats.</p>
<p>We passed over the fertile flats, which have been inundated as we
ascertained from the marks of flood on the timber, and stubble having been
washed against the large <i>Eucalypti</i>, with which the banks are clothed.
Travelling about 7 miles we arrived at a creek running in a serpentine form
from the river in a north-easterly direction. As our baggage horses would not
overtake us for some hours, we proposed to halt and pitch our tent on the
opposite side of the creek for the night. The soil of the higher lands at a
short distance from the river is of a stiff loam, and in some situations rocky
and sterile, but the lower grounds are rich and covered with strong grass.</p>
<p>Between the dep&ocirc;t and the creek, which Mr. Oxley had named Lewis's
Creek, <i>Lotus australis</i>, <i>Swainsona coronillaefolia</i>, and a creeping
<i>Hedysarum</i> are occasionally to be met with. The marsh mallow is very
abundant, <i>Callitris australis</i> is now very common on the hills, although
of no size or bulk. <i>Casuarina stricta</i> (usually called Swamp Oak) is
likewise very fine and large on the muddy banks. By the assistance of our boats
we conveyed our baggage over the creek, which although not above 12-10 feet
wide is very deep, and swam over our horses. I took a walk on the rocky barren
hills in the neighbourhood and discovered the following plants:--<i>Grevillea
sp.</i>, a beautiful shrub, with a calyx covered exteriorly with a ferruginous
tomentum, and smooth and green in colour inside; <i>Ajuga sp.</i>, with large
blue flowers and much of the habit of <i>A. pyramidalis</i>; <i>Phyllanthus
sp.</i>, a low shrubby plant; another species with narrow, obtuse, cuneated
leaves, revolute at the margins; <i>Bidens sp.</i>; <i>Dodonaea cuneata</i>,
with cuneated leaves; and <i>Astroloma humifusum</i>, a trailing plant, is
abundant in flower and fruit. We gathered on the hills some fine specimens of
crystallized quartz, some fine crystals, and some dark specimens of granite.
Mr. Oxley wrote to the Governor upon the subject of the river. Richard Lewis, a
superintendent at Bathurst, who accompanied us to the creek which takes his
name, returned to that settlement. Our people caught some fine large fish of
the same kind as those before noticed.</p>
<p><i>29th. Tuesday.</i> Continued our journey westward on the right bank of
the river and, travelling from point to point rather than follow the stream
through all its abrupt windings, I found the plants to be nearly the same with
little variation as those observed some days previously. The following are the
specimens collected in this day's route:--A drooping melancholy shrub of the
genus <i>Stenochilus</i>, which I have termed <i>S. longifolius</i>, now
presents itself in brushy sterile tracks near the river. <i>Gnaphalium sp.</i>,
much allied to <i>G. carnatum</i>, is common among the grass; and <i>Podolepis
rugata</i>, the peduncles of which near the insertion in the calyx are scaly.
On the immediate bank of the river I gathered seeds and specimens of a species
of <i>Viola</i>, with leaves on elongated pitioles; also a shrub of the order
<i>Rubiaceae</i>, 4 feet high, branching, diffuse, leaves oblong, seeds covered
with an arilla. <i>Persoonia spathulata</i>, discovered first on the S.W.
coast, is now in fruit on the rocky hills. On ascending a rugged height covered
with loose fragments of stones and hence rendered difficult of ascent, we had
an extensive view of the western country commanded by such an eminence. The
country appeared exceedingly low and flat with a few hills or ascents scattered
on its surface. On this elevation I discovered a new species of <i>Acacia</i>,
forming a small tree 25 feet high, the leaves are linear-lanceolate, and the
flowers are in axillary spikes, which are cylindrical. It is much allied to
<i>A. longifolia</i>, except in the shape of the foliage and their gray colour.
From the circumstance of this tree being the wood of which the natives in the
Western Country make their spears (which I have proved), and of which I shall
state more particulars hereafter, I have called it <i>A. doratoxylon</i>. It is
scarcely in a flowering state. <i>Cupressus australis</i> is common on these
heights. <i>Hovea sp.</i>, this is a slender shrub, frequent on the mount.</p>
<p>Mr. Oxley having taken the necessary bearings, we all descended to the river
and traced it down about three miles, halting for the night a few miles short
of our intended resting place at the creek where Mr. Evans terminated his
journey westerly in June 1815. The river now began to show its true character.
Our boat's people found it shoaly and narrow in some places, and in consequence
of its numerous and very abrupt windings they did not overtake or arrive at the
spot on the immediate bank of the river where we were encamped till a late
hour. I gathered specimens on the flats of a fine species of <i>Bromus</i>, and
these plains were covered with clumps of <i>Acacia decurrens</i> [Queen
Wattle].</p>
<p>The rocky hills are covered with a twining shrub, a <i>Bignonia</i> but it
was not in flower fit for examination. With it I observed a plant with the
habit of an <i>Aster</i>, resembling <i>A. argophyllus</i> [= <i>Olearia
argophylla</i>], but without that musty scent with which their leaves are
furnished. Our people shot a long-necked water bird like a cormorant.
<i>Eucalyptus robusta</i> or Brown Gum disappears, and chiefly Stringy Bark
(<i>Eucalyptus sp.</i>) and Blue Gum prevail. A beautiful species of
<i>Acacia</i>, a small tree with bipinnate leaves, and flowers in elongated
spikes; the whole plant has a glaucous hue. In consequence of its beautiful
appearance I have called it <i>A. spectabilis</i> [Mudgee Wattle].</p>
<p><i>April 30th. Wednesday.</i> Having sent our baggage horses forward and
despatched our boats down the river directing them to stop at the creek that
runs from the river on its right bank, we struck across the country a few
miles, in order to examine some <i>Callitris</i>, said to be abundant on the
lands distant from the river, which Mr. Evans had noticed on his tour before
referred to. These Cypress trees we found of various sizes and dimensions from
seedlings, generally growing in clumps, to lofty trees of about 60 feet, and
about 3 feet in diameter at the base. It has been suggested that stems might be
procured that would form good spars or booms, it is, however, much to be feared
that in consequence of the many knots on its trunk or stem it would be found
extremely brittle and short.</p>
<p>A species of <i>Xerotes</i>, with round filiform leaves, common on Bathurst
Plains, is frequent among the grass. The standing waters abound with an
<i>Actinocarpus</i> [Water star] remarkable for its capsule. Returning in a
westerly direction we made the creek which has taken the name of Byrne's Creek,
and we traced it up to its mouth at the river. Here I discovered a new plant of
the liliaceous family of the genus <i>Pancratium</i>. The flowers are small, of
a whitish flesh colour, varying to a bluish and light orange colour. They are
when fresh, May or White-thorn scented. It is now in flower, and is viviparous,
producing a small bulb instead of a capsule, which in time falls to the ground
and taking root ensures the future offspring. It being a new species I have
named it <i>P. Macquaria</i> [= <i>Calostemma purpureum</i>][*] in honour of
His Excellency Lachlan Macquarie, Esqre., our worthy and much respected
Governor, during whose arduous administration the colony of New South Wales has
been enlarged and beautified in an eminent degree, and by whose meritorious and
praiseworthy exertions the western part of the Continent has been laid open, as
well to the labours of the industrious agriculturalist as to the no less
laudable research of the unwearied naturalist. This species of
<i>Pancratium</i> delights in a low damp situation, its bulbous roots were with
some difficulty dug up, being so very deep in the rich black soil on the banks
of the river. The woody lands are alternately grassy and bushy, with slight
inundations.</p>
<blockquote>[* The name <i>Pancratium macquaria</i> is only mentioned in the
"Botanical Magazine," under <i>Calostemma purpureum</i>, at t. 2100, as a
synonym of that plant.]</blockquote>
<p>Near the river we fell in with a large and spacious lagoon of considerable
length and breadth but not deep. On its surface were swimming great numbers of
waterfowl, such as swan, duck, teal, which we fired at in vain. Such was the
steepness and muddiness of Byrne's Creek that it became indispensably necessary
to form a kind of sloping road for our horses to descend to the water. Our
boats having carried over our horse-cargoes, we swam the animals over and
pitched our tent on the bank.[*] About a mile down the creek, in shallow water,
we saw a bark canoe, and the remains of small fires in the woods adjoining are
indications that the natives had recently visited this part of the country.</p>
<blockquote>[* Near Eugowra.]</blockquote>
<p><i>1817. May 1st. Thursday.</i> Mr. Evans having finished his surveys in
1815 at this creek on its right bank, Mr. Oxley commenced his labours in that
department from the left bank down the river. As previously arranged, Mr. Evans
accompanied by a person with the perambulator proceeded forward, taking the
bearings of all remarkable points, windings and curvatures of the river, as he
advanced, endeavouring to cut off any deep bight by stretching from angle to
angle and steering as direct a course as the nature of the country would admit.
About 2 o'clock in the afternoon we had penetrated about 10 miles, when it was
deemed advisable to halt for the day. The latter part of this day's journey
being difficult, on account of the lofty brome-grass with which the low lands
near the river abound. In swamps, tracks, and low inundated spots, great
abundance of a species of <i>Lobelia</i> was observed, of the habit of <i>L.
purpurascens</i>, but larger, and not purple beneath the leaf. It is in flower
and capsule. In such situations I gathered specimens of an <i>Achyranthes</i>,
with flowers around a quadrangular stalk. <i>Lythrum sp.</i>, before observed,
much allied to <i>L. salicaria</i>, grows very strong, with all the
preceding.</p>
<p>The higher grassy lands furnished me with seeds of <i>Aster sp.</i>, with
blue flowers and oblong spathulate leaves. In sterile brushy situations I
detected the following plants. <i>Pimelea sericea</i> allied to <i>P.
curviflora</i>; <i>Cotula sp.</i>, much allied to <i>Bellis</i>, is in
flower.</p>
<p><i>Bellis sp.</i>, a shrubby plant with cuneated 3-5 toothed leaves, whose
flowers are ornamental and blue. The seeds of this plant are furnished with 2
small aristae which are minutely barbed. I gathered specimens in fruit of
another species of <i>Callitris</i>, different from the species discovered in
the country near Lachlan Dep&ocirc;t in having a larger round fruit, branchlets
and leaves finer and of a glaucous hue, a tree of the same height as its
congener.</p>
<p><i>Dodonaea cuneata</i> and <i>Acacia obliqua</i> are frequent. Some small
lagoons, supplied from the inundation of the river, prevented us from
travelling always on its immediate banks. The direction of the stream at the
commencement of our journey is southerly. This however is counterbalanced by
its winding round to the north towards the close, making a true west course.
The freshly cut bark from some of the large gum trees (<i>Eucalyptus</i>)
informed us that the natives had recently passed by.</p>
<p><i>2nd. Friday.</i> We advanced westerly from our fires about 9 o'clock
through grassy flats, passing to the left of a large winding lagoon, which from
general appearances we had taken for the river, nor were some of us convinced
otherwise until we found it terminated in a swamp covered with <i>Arundo
phragmites</i> and other lofty grasses. Tracing the river down upwards of 10
miles, which had run somewhat northerly, we stopped for the day and pitched our
tent.</p>
<p>On some barren rising ground I gathered specimens of a <i>Xerotes</i>,
remarkable for its slender juncous leaves, from the angles of which
membranceous threads are produced. A species of <i>Saturcia</i> is common in
low lands; like other species of <i>Ibis</i> genus it has a mild aromatic
penetrating taste, and is in common use as tea among our people. With the
preceding, I gathered specimens of a weak herbaceous species of <i>Justica</i>.
Some tolerable specimens of <i>Callitris glauca</i> that we passed in this
day's route assumed much the habit of <i>Pinus sylvestris</i>. The timber is
the <i>Eucalyptus</i> usually called Blue Gum. Near the river I collected the
following grasses:--<i>Panicum sp.</i>, a slender plant; a <i>Cenchrus</i>, a
<i>Phleum</i>, and a species of <i>Imperata</i>, allied to
<i>Saccharum</i>.</p>
<p><i>3rd. Saturday.</i> Leaving our last night's resting place and following
the river southerly, the country we travelled over is occasionally grassy,
wooded, and has the same flat character as that already passed. The soil at a
small distance from the river is poor and barren and covered with brushwood.
<i>Callitris glauca</i> is a much finer, handsomer tree than we have hitherto
had, and, accompanied by <i>Casuarina</i> (swamp oak), approaches very near the
river. We now find from experience that 10 miles is a fair day's journey,
therefore having made good that distance we halted on the bank of the river,
which ran nearly west.</p>
<p>A very considerable portion of this day's stage is through a barren tract of
brushwood, presenting to us many plants frequently seen in similar situations,
among which I distinguished the following new plants. <i>Jasminum sp.</i>,
leaves opposite and alternate, forming a scandent or reclining shrub.
<i>Scaevola sp.</i>, bearing fleshy drupes, one seeded. <i>Acacia
homalophylla</i>, leaves lanceolate, flat and smooth, flowers axillary, a tree
25 feet high. <i>Pittosporum sp.</i>, a new and slender shrub in fruit.
<i>Myoporum strictum</i>, leaves lanceolate and stiff, flowers solitary and
pendulous. Some parts of the river were extremely shoaly and narrow, and having
numerous bends and obstructions of fallen timber its navigation was rendered
extremely difficult.</p>
<p><i>4th. Sunday.</i> We had determined to rest ourselves and horses the whole
of this day, and were the more particularly obliged so to do on account of the
detention of our boats, occasioned by the difficulties of working them in the
shallow windings choked up with decayed fallen trees, which it was found
literally necessary to clear away in order to form a passage for the boats. The
larger boat had unfortunately been stove by a sunken stump. Fearing to advance
further after dark, and not knowing where we were, our boatmen had stopped the
preceding evening about 4 miles at least short of our encampment. It was well
advanced in the afternoon before they were able to drop down to that part of
the river on the bank of which our tent was pitched. Hubbert, our boat-builder,
soon repaired the damage sustained by the boat. About half a mile northward of
our tent is a large lagoon forming a fine and spacious sheet of water, thickly
clothed with gum trees on its margin, and abounding with swans, ducks, etc. I
gathered seeds and specimens of <i>Actinocarpus sp.</i>, growing in company
with <i>Potamogeton natans</i>. In a little excursion I made westerly from the
tent I discovered the following:--<i>Tetrandria</i>, a spreading twiggy small
tree 10-20 feet high. <i>Pentandria</i>, a shrub with oblong narrow leaves.
<i>Myoporum sp.</i>, <i>Pittosporum lanceolatum</i>, duplicate seed. Gathered
seeds of <i>Acacia pendula</i>, nova sp., a tree 25 feet high, with much the
habit and growth of <i>Salix babylonica</i>, leaves simple, lanceolate, the
whole tree has a gray hue; common on the low flats near the above mentioned
lagoon. From the summit of a gentle rising hill we could just distinguish a
very lofty range to the northward and eastward. A remarkable point on this
range we have called Mount Sorrell, after the Lt. Governor of Van Diemen's
Island. This hill is covered with a reddish slaty stone, and the soil is a
light loam. Some large specimens of <i>Cupressus australis</i> were observed on
it, with <i>Casuarina macrocarpa</i>, a new species, a tree about 30 feet high.
Our hunters brought in a fine young buck kangaroo.</p>
<p><i>5th. Monday.</i> We departed from our last encampment about 9 o'clock,
and having crossed a small creek which intersected our course, we ascended the
gentle rising hill which I had visited yesterday. The view even on this
eminence being much confined, Mr. Oxley took bearings of the most remarkable
ranges of hills around it at a distance from the top of a lofty
<i>Callitris</i>. Descending to the flats we were again deceived by a long
chain of ponds or lagoons which we fell in with, but perceiving our mistake we
crossed it in a dry situation and came to the banks of the Lachlan. Such was
the confusion created by this mistake that we were all scattered and divided
and taking different courses. Our people in the boats fired guns to inform us
of their situation.</p>
<p>Calling to one another we were answered by strange voices, which left us in
no doubt of natives being near us. It was a great point we should all join
again, which at length we did, after some of us had passed over several miles
on a cross-course, the labour of which might have been saved. Our people came
up with seven or eight of the natives, who were clothed with mantles of skin
reddened with a pigment from the river. There appeared not the most distant
symptoms of hostility among them! They evidently had seen a horse before, and
could pronounce some words of English, such as bread, and they had every
appearance of having been with those at the Lachlan Dep&ocirc;t, from which we
are now 54 miles west. From the columns of smoke ascending from the trees to
which these harmless beings were advancing there is no doubt of their
encampment being there situated, and it might be inferred that their gins or
wives were there, from their evident objection to our people attempting to
accompany them to their fires. The delay and loss of time occasioned by the
above adventure had allowed our boatmen to work themselves through all the
numerous windings of this intricate river and overtake us.</p>
<p>We all started again in a body, travelling immediately on the river bank
about 4 miles, when we were stopped by a deep muddy creek connecting the river
with the chain of ponds above alluded to. We passed this gully with
considerable difficulty, being obliged to unload our horses. Accompanied by Mr.
Oxley I went to an extensive open plain about half a mile N.W. of our course,
which we found of very considerable extent. It is a flat that receives the
inundations of the Lachlan; it is of a light loamy soil and at this time very
damp and slimy, in consequence of the recent rain.</p>
<p>This plain, which is clear of timber and is skirted by <i>Acacia pendula</i>
we have called Solway Flats, from its slight similarity to a place of that name
in North Britain.</p>
<p>The following are the plants discovered on it:--<i>Salsola sp.</i>, leaves
linear, with the habit of a <i>Mesembryanthemum</i>. <i>Mimulus sp.</i>, leaves
oblong-ovate, peduncle filiform, one-flowered. <i>Richea sp.</i>, agreeing with
this genus in the plumose pappi with which the seeds are crowned. <i>Loranthus
nutans</i>, leaves ovate-oblong, obtuse, peduncle axillary, 2-3 flowered,
parasitical on <i>Acacia Pendula</i>. I gathered a few good seeds of this
singular <i>Acacia</i>. The purple <i>Bromus</i>, a diminutive <i>Panicum</i>,
and a small purple-flowering <i>Arthropodium</i>, frequent on the Eastern
Coast, are common on these flats. <i>Pancratium macquaria</i> [= <i>Calostemma
purpureum</i>], delighting in such situations, is scattered over the whole of
the boggy plains.</p>
<p>The dimensions of the visible part of these plains are four miles by seven.
I here observed a thick dense bushy shrub, of the <i>Atripliceae</i>, probably
a <i>Rhagodia</i>. It is, however, not in flower or fruit. Continuing our
journey southward of west, over a broken bad country of low scrubby aspect,
having hollows filled with putrid water, we entered a thick sterile brush about
four miles from the plains, and halted for the day in a situation where our
horses could provide themselves with but little grass! No variation in the
timber. Our boats were aground several times, such is the shallowness of the
river, which together with difficulty of clearing sunken timber renders the
navigation dangerous. We made ten miles clear on a northerly course. The course
of the river is southerly.</p>
<p><i>6th. Tuesday.</i> The country through which we penetrated this day has
the same character and appearance as that already passed. The timber is the
same, with not the smallest diversity of scenery, a gloomy sameness pervading
the whole of the solitary woods near the river. At 3&frac12; miles on our
journey our progress was again stopped by a small, trifling, but deep gully
filled with water, the drainings of the land.</p>
<p>Passing this creek, having been obliged to unload the pack horses on this
occasion, our course led us through high grassy and in some spots swampy land
of difficult penetration, until we came out upon a bend of the flats discovered
yesterday, which is bounded by a rugged but most romantic picturesque rocky
range of hills. A change of scenery was very agreeable at this period. Crossing
the flats, we arrived at the base of this elevated range, and ascending to the
summit of this hill a most extensive panoramic view of the country around us
presents itself, of which the following ranges have been named:--A range of
lofty hills to the northward and eastward of us, of which Mount Sorrell is a
part, we have called St. Andrew's Range. A second range to the southward and
eastward we term St. Patrick's Range. The range we are now upon (which is
singularly divided allowing the river to run through it) Mr. Oxley
distinguishes by the name of St. George's Range. The bluff headland points on
each side the river; the one on the right bank is called Mount Stewart, and
that on the left side of the river has been nominated Mount Amiott, after two
gentlemen in the Secretary of State's Office. The whole three ranges, bending
round, form a crescent like a half moon, of which the two last mentioned
mountains are its horns. It has been entitled Queen Charlotte's Crescent. Some
extensive plains on the left side of the river, not seen before, Mr. Oxley has
called Hamilton's Plains, in honour of Wm. Hamilton Esqre. the Under Secretary
of State, and are contrasted with Solway Flats on its right bank.</p>
<p>The country for upwards Of 50 miles is flat and low, and to the westward a
distant range of hills with singular bluff abrupt terminations have been
distinguished by the name of St. David's Range, of which Mount Melville and
Mount Cunningham are the most remarkable. To the southward of us is the point
of a range termed Mount Gill, in honour of Captain Gill of the 46th Regt. and
civil engineer at Sydney. The river (as Mr. Oxley had suspected from its
appearance and observations taken by him on the morning of yesterday) runs
between the rugged Mounts Amiott and Stewart, and takes a course generally
southerly of west. We are now only 425 feet above the level of the sea, which
was ascertained by our barometer. Mount Stewart is composed of large blocks of
granite, and the following are plants discovered on its elevated
summit:--<i>Persoonia scabra</i>, a species first discovered on the S.W. Coast,
in fruit. <i>Persoonia spathulata</i>, observed before in such situations.
<i>Persoonia curvifolia</i>, a remarkable curling-leaved shrub, <i>Styphelia
sp.</i>, allied to <i>S. tubiflora</i>, the flowers of which are very
deciduous, and a <i>Leucopogon</i>, <i>Cryptandra sp.</i>, differing from <i>C.
ericaefolium</i>, by its floral bracts being deciduous. <i>Tecoma Oxleyi</i>
(nova sp.), leaves pinnated; leaflets lanceolate, entire; flowers white with
purple striae, and bearded inside. The capsule is oblong and cylindrical, as in
<i>Tecoma</i>, which, with several remarkable species at present termed
<i>Bignonia</i>, discovered in Brazil, constitute as many genera of the
<i>Bignoniaceae</i>. This new and beautiful species I have presumed to dedicate
to the memory of our worthy and persevering chief in the present
expedition.</p>
<p>The eye is much relieved, from the sterility of the overhanging rocks grey
with lichens, by the great profusion of flowers which this ornamental shrub
produces. <i>Phyllanthus revolutus</i> is common here. A delicate-leaved
<i>Eriostemon</i>, scarcely in flower, grew very profusely, accompanying a
shrub of the same natural order of <i>Rutaceae</i>, the flowers of which were
scarcely expanded. It is a glandulous shrub, with scattered obcordate leaves,
silvered beneath, flowers terminal and yellow. <i>Cupressus australis</i>, with
some common <i>Mimosa</i>, particularly <i>Acacia doratoxylon</i>, are abundant
on this mount, but stunted in growth.</p>
<p>Our lat. is 33&deg;23'0" S. and long. 148&deg; W. or thereabouts. Following
the windings of the river on its high grassy banks about 2 miles, we halted
about 4 o'clock, having travelled 12 miles in the course of the day. A curious
species of Fungi, <i>Agaricus</i>, of a yellowish colour, which upon being
broken and exposed to the air immediately assumed a blue tint. Our fishermen
were uncommonly successful; they caught from 190-200 lbs. weight, consisting of
13 fish, of which the largest weighed 70 lbs. with the entrails and 65 lbs.
gutted. Its length was 3 feet 5 inches, curve of shoulder 2 ft. 6 in. Fin to
fin over the back 1 ft. 5 in.; breadth of tail when expanded 1 ft. 1&frac12;
in., and depth of mouth a foot. It may be considered as the largest that has
been caught.</p>
<p><i>7th. Wednesday.</i> We rested our horses and selves the whole of this
day, which gave me an opportunity of repapering my specimens and drying my
seeds. Desirous of examining Mount Amiott, I, accompanied by two of our party,
crossed the river by one of our boats and directing our course to the base of
the range we arrived at its foot about 1 o'clock. The botany of this point is
nearly the same as that observed on Mount Stewart. I, however, gathered
specimens of a species of <i>Prostanthera</i>, with linear leaves, in capsule,
affording me seeds. A species of <i>Azorella</i> with ovate leaves, found on
the Eastward coast is likewise common here. <i>Goodenia sp.</i>, a shrubby
plant (specimens). The flats near the river abound with <i>Pancratium
Macquaria</i> [= <i>Calostemma purpureum</i>]. At dusk we returned to our
encampment on the opposite side of the river.</p>
<p><i>8th. Thursday.</i> We left this resting place about 8 o'clock, following
the river over some good tracts of land of a rich dark loamy soil, but in
consequence of its general flatness and the marks of flood on the stems of the
trees it cannot be of any service to the farmer. The river has several large
fine reaches, and its general tendency is northerly. There is no variation in
the timber that species of <i>Eucalyptus</i> called Blue Gum being most
predominant. At a remarkable bend or elbow of the river, in a bushy barren
spot, I gathered duplicate seeds of <i>Pittosporum lanceolatum</i>, the rest of
the plants being uniformly the same as previously observed. About 2 miles to
the northward and westward extensive long plains opened to the view, bounded
southerly by the Lachlan, and northerly by small eucalyptus woods. They wind
round with the river, are soft and boggy, and in fact have the same character
as Solway Flats.</p>
<p>On account of the many emus seen feeding on these plains we have been
induced to term them Cassowary Plains. The river is much narrower than we have
hitherto seen it, the banks are low and very naked. The Casuarina or swamp oak
with which they are clothed nearer the dep&ocirc;t now disappears, and
<i>Acacia Pendula</i> succeeds at regular wide distances on the banks. The
shrubs of the <i>Atriplicina</i> [Silver Saltbush], now in flower, abound on
Solway Flats. It appears to be a <i>Rhagodia</i>, leaves angularly toothed,
subrotund, bilobially cuneated. Our day's journey was about 14 miles when we
halted on the plains at an early hour.</p>
<p>We had scarcely pitched our tent and made a fire when we were surprised by a
large male emu, who, unconscious of danger, came stalking across the plain near
our tent. It, however, cost him his life, for our dogs after a chase of 15
minutes brought him down. At my suggestion our people gathered a quantity of
the young leaves of the <i>Rhagodia</i>, which they boiled and found them to be
an excellent substitute for a better vegetable, which, with the emu made us an
excellent dinner. I found on these plains a species of <i>Cyperus</i>, of which
I gathered seeds, also a species of <i>Euphorbia</i>, an annual plant, leaves
obovate, oblique, with a filiform stem. Such were the numerous obstructions in
the river that our boats were obliged to stop at nightfall 6 miles short of our
encampment. At sunset we fired some musketry in order to inform our boatmen of
the situation of our encampment.</p>
<p><i>9th. Friday.</i> Our boats came down to us about 10 o'clock. The
principal cause of their detention it appears was their having been obliged to
saw through four large trees that had fallen across the stream and had
completely blocked up the passage. One of these trees was a large specimen of
the <i>Casuarina</i> or swamp oak, whose hard close-grained wood gave much
resistance to our cross-cut saws. Proceeding forward westerly on our journey,
having the river in sight for upwards of two hours, during which period it ran
to all points of the compass and its windings in some instances formed parallel
lines with each other. The country is alternately plain and brushy, barren
tracts producing plants of which mention has been made. At 2 o'clock we arrived
at an extensive plain, being part of the chain of plains of which Cassowary
Plains and Solway Flats form some parts or divisions. This spacious flat Mr.
Oxley has called Fields Plains, in honour of Barron Field Esqre., our judge of
the Supreme Court, and from these the singular and pointed hill called Mount
Melville bore N. Westerly a few miles, being the termination of St. David's
Range.</p>
<p>From the plains we advanced north of west, which is the river's general
inclination, a few miles but, doubting whether our boats would be able to keep
pace with us, we stopped at dusk on the river bank near another continuation of
these plains. The river is free from fallen timber but in some places shoaly,
the current is scarcely perceptible, and the banks generally lower, being not
above 10 feet in some places, and bare of timber, what there is being
<i>Eucalyptus</i> or Blue Gum and the <i>Casuarina</i>. <i>Callitris glauca</i>
is now more frequent, and <i>Eucalyptus micrantha</i> very common, forming a
tree 40-50 feet high remarkable for its leaves which are deformed, very flat
and glossy; the flowers are in umbels, and very small. The tetrandrous shrub,
producing a nut, before observed, is very frequent, with <i>Pittosporum
lanceolatum</i>.</p>
<p><i>10th. Saturday.</i> The pasture being very indifferent, our horses had
strayed away during the night in search of a better grazing place, and were not
overtaken and brought back to our encampment until too late to proceed on our
journey. We therefore remained at this resting place the whole of this day. Our
lat. is 33&deg;16'23" S., Mr. Oxley and Mr. Evans took some observations while
I employed myself among my plants that required attention. In the afternoon I
took a walk on the plains and collected the following interesting plants:--A
new genus, <i>Arthrotriche</i>. <i>A. speciosa</i>, a small herbaceous plant,
common in low boggy spots, of the same natural order as Dr. Smith's genus
<i>Brunonia</i>.[*] <i>Rubia sp.</i> <i>Goodenia sp.</i>, leaves radical.
<i>Mimulus sp.</i>, of a larger growth than the species discovered on the 5th.
<i>Arabis sp.</i>, a cress, frequent in wet situations. <i>Chrysanthemum
sp.</i>, stoloniferous, flowers large, white. I gathered specimens in fruit and
seeds of a species of <i>Hakea</i> allied to <i>H. rugosa</i>, forming a shrub
6 ft. high, with filiform leaves, as in <i>H. pugioniformis</i> of Hortus
Kewensis. I likewise gathered seeds of <i>Salsola sp.</i>, and a species of
<i>Rhagodia</i> with rhomboid leaves. <i>Pancratium Macquaria</i> [=
<i>Calostemma purpureum</i>] is very abundant on the plains...and the small
<i>Euphorbla</i> is very common in humid situations. Gathered some grasses,
among them were a <i>Stipa</i> and a <i>Melica</i>. It was observed to-day that
the river was rising, having increased 2 inches (?) in a few hours. Served
provisions of flour and pork to ourselves and people.</p>
<blockquote>[* The plant of this name described by Mueller belongs to a
different order.]</blockquote>
<p><i>11th. Sunday.</i> Being detained the whole of yesterday in consequence of
our horses having strayed, Mr. Oxley determined to proceed forward with all
possible despatch, advancing westerly about the usual time; on a continuance of
the chain of plains (called Field's Plains) we experienced much inconvenience
from the bogs and grassy marshes with which they abound. In about 6&frac12;
miles we arrived at the base of Mount Cunningham. The river bore to the
southward of this Mount, and from it runs a creek winding itself under it. From
the summit of Mount Cunningham the land to the westward is low and flat, with
several open plains appearing through the trees. A range of hills to the
southward and westward of us Mr. Oxley has named Hurd's Peak, Mount Allan,
Mount Edwards and Mount Merrick. Mount Cunningham, which is not less than
&frac34; of a mile in length, is a detached hill, having its highest point at
the northern extremity. It is remarkable for its extreme rocky, sterile,
aspect. The plants discovered upon it are the following:--<i>Psychotria
punctata</i>, leaves ovate (a specimen in fruit); a grass, <i>Lolium</i>(?)
Gathered some duplicate specimens of <i>Tecoma Oxleyi</i>; I likewise noticed a
<i>Grevillea</i>, allied to <i>G. sphacelata</i>; <i>Prostanthera nivea</i>,
and some common <i>Epacrideae</i>. <i>Acacia doratoxylon</i> and <i>Cupressus
glauca</i> are very common, but small. The whole of the vegetation on this
rocky hill has been lately burnt by the natives in search of game. The remains
of their fires and huts we observed at its base on the S.E. side of the
mount.</p>
<p>I must here acknowledge my obligations to Mr. Oxley for the honour he has
conferred upon me in naming a remarkable mount after me. Tracing the creek to
its connection with the river we ferried our horse loads over, swam the
animals, and halted for the day. Our boatmen reported to us the division of the
river into two grand arms, near the commencement of our journey, which accounts
for its obviously narrow channel and low banks, being in some places not above
three feet. Mr. Oxley, Mr. Evans and self rode back on the river bank to the
division, and found that the other arm ran away S.W. by W., Mount Melville
bearing N.E. by E. 3 miles.</p>
<p><i>May 11th. Sunday.</i> It is as large as the northwest river which we
intend to continue upon, and which we are induced from appearances to conclude
will not be of long existence as a river. We fathomed the deepest part and
found it did not exceed 19 ft. It is evident that these plains are inundated by
the river in great floods from the eastward, for in fact the highest land (the
few rocky hills excepted) is on the immediate bank of the river, so that the
floods rising over the banks descend down upon the plains on each side this
channel. On the plains we observed two native companions (<i>Grus
australasiana</i>), and our people shot two swans. From the circumstance of
having seen two bark canoes moored among the reeds on the river's left bank,
and from the body of smoke ascending above the small trees at the base of Mount
Melville on the opposite side of the plain, it is evident that there are some
natives existing in these parts. We, however, saw none.</p>
<p>It was a matter of surprise that we fell in with so very few natives, whose
marks are daily before our eyes, but it appears sufficiently obvious that
experience has taught them to retire from a river where a supply of food is
extremely precarious, and where a sudden inundation would in a moment sweep
them away. Choosing rather to retire to the hilly country where they are
enabled to obtain a daily subsistence with greater facility, and are not liable
to be surprised and overtaken by floods.</p>
<p>N.B. It appears they only visit the river in great drought, when there is
but little water in its channel, and are then able to procure the large horse
mussel from its muddy bottom, which they cannot possibly obtain in floods and
strong currents. They have no idea of angling or have any method to catch
[fish?] that we know of. The viviparous <i>Pancratium</i> [= <i>Calostemma
purpureum</i>] grows extremely luxuriant on these slimy plains. An unfortunate
accident happened us this day. The horse that usually carried the barometer
fell beneath his load and broke that valuable instrument.</p>
<p><i>12th. Monday.</i> Having our resting place on the margin of the creek we
commenced our route down the north-west arm, but had not proceeded westerly a
mile before we were stopped by an outlet, a small branch running from the river
northerly. It is evident we are not far distant from its termination, from the
perceptible descent of the country and the lowness of the banks. We were
obliged to unload the horses, and with the assistance of our boats carried all
our luggage over in the usual manner. Travelling on the immediate bank, which
we found much firmer and harder than the more distant lower land, about half a
mile from the last creek, Mr. Evans, who had gone on before us in his surveying
of the river, discovered first that it was impossible to proceed farther, that
the river had risen level with the banks, and the flats as far as we could see
were an immense swamp. Thus are dispersed in different directions, and
particularly westerly and north westerly of us, these great bodies of water
that descend from the eastern country through the channel of the Lachlan River,
which substantiates our suspicions respecting it prior to our departure from
the dep&ocirc;t.</p>
<p>We crossed the rivulet (now no river), which is about 25 or 30 ft. wide and
has a strong current, and walked to the summit of a hill a short distance to
the westward of us. From there we observed the land to the southward and
westward appears more elevated than that in a more northerly direction over
which these waters are dispersed, the river being totally lost in permanent
marshes. It is a subject of very considerable regret that a river upon which
much has been calculated and respecting which many flattering hopes have been
entertained should have such a termination. Mr. Oxley has determined therefore
(since further surveys on this arm are useless and impracticable) to return to
the mouth of the Southern Branch and explore it down. Previous to leaving this
rising ground, which we have called Farewell Hill, we took the bearings of the
following hills:--A hill bearing S. by E. we have called Mount Campbell, in
honour of the Colonial Secretary, John Thos. Campbell Esqre. A hill near it
bearing nearly south, has been called Mount Edwards; another hill bearing
S.S.E. Mr. Oxley called Mount Falla, after a nurseryman at Newcastle-upon-Tyne.
Two other hills, bearing westerly a few miles, have received the names Mounts
Merrick and Abbott. Farewell Hill bears S. by W. 2 miles of Mount
Cunningham.</p>
<p>Returning on the left bank we met with several difficulties, as well as from
the low swampy flats as from the narrow deep creeks which we intersected in our
route. Our horses were so much exhausted by swimming over the creeks and
rivers, and by the subsequent severe exercise over these marshes, that we were
obliged to halt on some dry ground a mile short of the spot on which we
intended to encamp, being about half a mile from our last night's resting place
on the opposite side of the river. Farewell Hill, like other elevated spots of
the same nature, is covered with <i>Callitris glauca</i>, <i>Acacia
doratoxylon</i>, some dwarf trees of <i>Eucalyptus</i> (Blue Gum),
<i>Indigofera sp.</i>, and the <i>Grevillea</i> allied to <i>G. sphacelata</i>.
In the swampy lands I gathered specimens of a species of <i>Arenaria</i>; a
syngenesious plant allied to <i>Aster</i>, the flower is blue with many linear
rays; a trailing plant of the <i>Rutaceae</i>, having the habit of a
<i>Zygophyllum</i>, with conjugate and obovate leaves, the flowers are yellow,
octandrous and decandrous, capsule 4-lobed; a beautiful dwarf species of
<i>Mimulus</i>, which decorated the dull places with its delicate purple
flowers. I sowed some peach stones and quince seeds on the opposite side of the
river previous to leaving our last night's encampment.</p>
<p><i>13th. Tuesday.</i> This morning we returned to the head of the southerly
arm of the river where we encamped, intending to take a survey down this branch
a few miles in order to ascertain how far it would be practicable to travel on
its banks before we should attempt to continue our journey with the baggage
horses, all of which required rest.</p>
<p><i>14th. Wednesday.</i> Mr. Oxley rode down on the right bank of the river
about 3 miles when he found it gradually decreasing in breadth, its banks very
low and its inclination northerly in the same direction as the other branch. He
could not advance further on account of its ramifications into minor
streamlets, all tending to the lower lands westerly and northwesterly. From
these circumstances as well as from the appearance of the main channel being
choked up with <i>Arundo phragmites</i> no doubt existed in his mind that it
terminated and dispersed itself in the same low swampy flats as the other or
northerly branch so that we are encamped on an island. Mr. Oxley conceives he
cannot act up to the spirit of his instructions more fully than by commencing a
journey to the S.W. coast in hopes of learning something respecting the
Macquarie River which we have not seen since we left Bathurst. We therefore
propose to rest the horses in order to enable them to recruit their strength
for such an undertaking.</p>
<p><i>15th. Thursday.</i> I formed one of a party destined to visit Mount
Melville bearing N.E. by E., 8 miles distant. We left the tent about half past
9 o'clock, and in our route across Field's Plains, which we found extremely
swampy, I gathered specimens of a <i>Polygonum</i>, a rushy shrub with
lanceolate leaves and diaecious flowers; also an aphyllous shrub with the habit
of a <i>Thesium</i>, having dichotomous branches, the fruit is a superior nut,
half enclosed in a persistent calyx.</p>
<p>About 1 o'clock we came to a creek running east and west, about 16 feet
broad and of considerable depth. Our huntsman was the only person who was able
to cross it, from whose report, having climbed to the summit of one of its
peaks, it is a barren rocky (red granite) hill. The timber upon it is small and
stunted: its surface had been recently fired by natives, and it has that
self-same aspect of sterility its Mount Cunningham. We observed marks of flood
on the steins of the <i>Eucalypti</i> on the verge of the creek upwards of 3
ft. The same aquatic plant of <i>Alismaceae</i> allied to <i>Damasonium</i>
frequent on the Eastern coast, abounds in this creek. Here is a species of
<i>Myriophyllum</i>, scarcely distinct from the British <i>M.
verticillatum</i>, it has its lower leaves which are immersed, pinnated and
capillary. I gathered specimens of a species of <i>Casuarina</i> tree, 30 feet
high, with flaccid smooth branchlets and a strobile smaller than that of <i>C.
macrocarpa</i>, with much stronger branches. Parasitical on the <i>Eucalyptus
globulus</i>, usually termed Blue Gum, I discovered a species of
<i>Loranthus</i>, which I have named (<i>L. aurantiacus</i>), whose leaves are
lanceolate, and the whole plant is of weak pendent habit. I have gathered fine
flowering specimens of another species, <i>L. nutans</i>, of more stiff growth.
having peduncles 2-3 flowered, and nodding or bent downwards.</p>
<p>The soil of these flats is of a tenacious cold stiff clayey quality. We
passed the spots where the natives had had their fires, the smoke of which we
had observed on the 11th inst. The freshness of the ashes suggested to us that
they had not left them 24 hours. It is likewise evident that mussels which they
procure from the creek constitute a part of their viands, from the great
numbers of their shells being scattered around their gunyas or bark huts. At
dark we returned with the small collection of specimens I had gathered in the
course of the day's excursion. The country for a very considerable distance
northward and westward of Mount Melville is low and exceeding swampy. The
natives had removed to the opposite side of the creek in a hollow between Mount
Melville and Mount Cunningham, for we could occasionally perceive the smoke of
their fires among the trees.</p>
<p><i>16th. Friday.</i> Arranging and packing up plants throughout the whole of
this day. By observations taken this day by Mr. Oxley we find the site of our
encampment is in lat. 33&deg;15'35" S., and long. 147&deg;45'00" E., the
variation of the compass being 7&deg;08'00" E. Mr. Oxley sent two persons to a
range of hills, of which Mount Maud forms a part, in order to look out for a
good track round a lagoon on the opposite side of the river for our horses to
pass, as also to observe the nature of the country in our intended course in
that direction. By this report we learned that the country to the southward and
westward is more elevated and the soil firmer for travelling than that of the
plains. They ascended to the lofty eminence of Mount Maud, which appears to be
not so barren as others in its vicinity. The <i>Grevillea</i> allied to <i>G.
sphacelata</i> is found here extremely luxuriant, forming a shrub 8 ft. high;
with a linear-leaved <i>Solanum</i> entirely covered with long-orange thorns.
<i>Clitoria sp.</i>, with pinnated leaves, which are retuse and silky, produces
an elongated spike of blue flowers, was found at the base of the mountain. They
gathered specimens of a shrub of the order <i>Rutaceae</i>, of the genus of
<i>Eriostemon</i>, differing from <i>E. squameus</i> [= <i>E. Billardieri</i>]
not only in the shape of the foliage, but in the absence of scales on their
underside. The whole shrub is covered with glandular tubercules, and has the
scent of Black Currants. I have this day ascertained that the heterophyllous
tree seen at Lime Stone Creek is a species of <i>Sterculia</i>, as that genus
now stands. Our people brought me some old capsules of it, which are pea-like,
distinct from one another, bursting on the side, and are many seeded.</p>
<p><i>17th. Saturday.</i> Our carpenter having planed a flat surface on a large
stem of a eucalyptus we left our marks upon it as follows. J. Oxley; G. W.
Evans; A.C. May 17th, 1817.[*] This morning we removed from our encampment to
the opposite side, about 2&frac12; miles down the river, carrying over our
luggage, provisions etc., and swimming the horses. Pitched our tent for the day
and served out rations of provisions to people.</p>

<p><i>May 18th. Sunday.</i> Our boats being of no further use to us we hauled
them up on the bank leaving them with keel upwards; barked them over in order
to preserve them as long as possible from the action and effects of the
weather, in case we should be obliged to return to them in consequence of any
unforeseen accident. We likewise divided the provisions that had been conveyed
by the boats equally among the whole of the horses (both saddle and pack),
leaving under the boats. all weighty iron tools that we might reasonably
conclude we should not require on our new course. I here sowed--near the spot
where we left the boats--some peach stones and quince seeds.</p>

<h4>JOHN OXLEY</h4>
</center>
<p>This arranged, we commenced our journey on a true S.W. course by compass
towards Cape Northumberland,[*] Mr. Evans taking the lead, accompanied by two
persons, the one having the perambulator, and the other marking the trees with
an adze as a guide to our pack-horse leaders. The horses groaned beneath the
weight of their loads, which was not less than 300 lbs. weight each. Having
passed the heads of some lagoons the country becomes exceeding brushy, and
assumes a greyish gloominess in consequence of the great numbers of <i>Acacia
pendula</i> and <i>Rhagodia dilatata</i>, which are the two predominant shrubs.
The soil is a loose red earth, with a large proportion of sand. About 3 o'clock
we had made good about 10 miles on the given course when we stopped at a gully
containing stagnant, white, muddy water.</p>
<blockquote>[* From Oxley's journal we learn that where the river formed two
branches he left it and began his journey to the south-west.]</blockquote>
<p>The plants are the same as those already noticed and made mention of.
<i>Eucalyptus micrantha</i> (Bastard Box) was more frequent. The Cypress grows
occasionally in large clumps about 40 ft. high. I gathered duplicate seeds of
<i>Acacia Pendula</i>.</p>
<p><i>19th. Monday.</i> Continuing our route from our last night's resting
place, the general character of the country we passed over is brushy and
sterile. We passed the rocky range of hills at Mount Maud through a stony
rugged gully. At this spot I discovered the following:--<i>Pimelea
colorans</i>, a beautiful plant, whose involucre and flowers change from white
to bluish colour according to its age and exposure. <i>Zieria sp.</i> [a kind
of Sandfly Bush] a shrub 2&frac12; ft., with white and purple flowers.
<i>Solanaceae</i>, a suffruticose plant, flowers blue. <i>Eutaxia sp.</i>,
<i>Sida sp.</i>, and <i>Aster decurrens</i> (= <i>Olearia decurrens</i>), a
slender shrub.</p>
<p>We passed some fine specimens of <i>Sterculia heterophylla</i> having the
last year's capsules on them, forming stems about 30 inches in diameter. A
creeping shrub probably of the <i>Asclepiadaceae</i> is very abundant twining
among the small cypress. In an open space having marks of inundation the holes
were very dry, and gave us but little encouragement to hope for water at any
resting place where we might halt at night. <i>Acacia Pendula</i> [Myall], is
common with another species. <i>A. homalophylla</i> [Curly yarran], remarkable
for its lanceolate, smooth, flat leaves, which have a solitary gland on the
interior margin. A tree 25 ft. high.</p>
<p>Our journey was unavoidably lengthened in hopes of finding water; we had
travelled 12 miles and found none or the appearance of any! We managed 2 miles
farther and encamped among some burnt grass which had been fired by natives.
Having pitched the tents and unladen our poor horses, who felt the privation
infinitely more than ourselves, we sent our people in several directions in
quest of water, when, after a diligent search, some was discovered about half a
mile westerly of our tents, where the natives had encamped some time since,
their bark huts being still in existence. It is a great relief to the eye to
observe a deviation, however slight, from the dull gloomy sameness--the want of
diversity in the timber of Western Australia.[*] At the base of the range of
hills at Mount Maud some tolerably fair specimens of the western iron bark
(<i>Eucalyptus sideroxylon</i>) were noticed, being easily distinguished from
its congeners by its extremely rugged, furrowed, bark, containing like others
of the <i>Eucalypti</i> a strong astringent styptic gum.</p>
<blockquote>[* Cunningham's name for the country west of the Blue
Mountains.]</blockquote>
<p><i>20th. Tuesday.</i> Our people had [taken] the precaution to fill all the
vessels we had with us suitable to carry water, in case we should not be so
fortunate to find any at our next resting place. Continuing our course due S.W.
over a most sterile dry, flat country notorious for the uniformity of its
productions, being the same as passed yesterday. The only timber of any
consequence is a few scattered specimens of <i>Callitris glauca</i> Of 50 or 60
feet high and about 2 feet in diameter, the smaller trees being the
<i>Casuarina</i> before mentioned, and <i>Acacia pendula</i>, on which I
detected a new species of <i>Loranthus</i> [probably <i>L. linophyllus</i>],
with round linear foliage. I likewise discovered a monaecious shrub allied to
<i>Croton</i>, a slender tall shrub with linear lanceolate leaves and
triangular branches. At 8 miles on this day's journey we came to a tract of
country full of water holes or hollow places not quite dry, but the whole of
the land had evident signs of having been flooded, although at no recent
period. Penetrating three miles further we traced the same miserable wild
country that we had had all day, when, having cleared 11 miles, we came to an
anchor for the night. The whole of us went out in search of water as usual;
after some time expended in a fruitless search one of our people procured some
miserable filthy water by digging a hole on some low damp ground. We had taken
the precaution to supply ourselves by filling a keg previous to leaving our
last night's encampment, which we served out at 1&frac12; pints per man.</p>
<p><i>21st. Wednesday.</i> We had hitherto been tolerably supplied with water,
nor was it till this morning that we learnt to appreciate the value of good
water, which like other great blessings are only estimated by the loss of them.
All the water we could procure, which we brought from distant corrupted holes,
was very foul and muddy and filled with animalcules, to destroy which we boiled
and strained the water. We had scarcely left our resting place when we found
water in a small hidden hole, tolerably good at which we supplied our horses.
The country south westerly on this day's journey has an equally barren red
soil, and the timber produced is very diminutive and stunted. The eye rests
with pleasure upon the Native Cherry, our common eastern coast plant,
<i>Exocarpus cupressiformis</i>. The plants were but few, as
<i>follows:--Pentandria</i>; <i>Monogynia</i>; <i>Rutaceae</i>, a beautiful
tree about 30 feet high, of very spreading habit, with branches very slender
and pendulous. <i>Dodonaea cuneata</i> is very frequent. This day's journey
afforded me duplicate specimens of the monaecious shrub collected yesterday
allied to <i>Croton</i>.</p>
<p>At nine miles a burnt grass tract induced us to halt and look for water, of
the existence of which we had some hopes, from the circumstance of having seen
recent foot impressions of natives, and a swan having flown over us led us to
conclude that water is not far distant. Mr. Evans, who had gone forward two
miles beyond this place, returned to us, having found some stagnant water
holes. After a diligent search we discovered some fine clear water in a lagoon
or swamp about 5 miles to the westward of our tent. One of our people came near
to a native who was of a very strong athletic habit, he however escaped. One of
their spears was likewise found.</p>
<p><i>22nd. Thursday.</i> In order to rest our horses, who had by reason of
hard labour through an intricate country with little provision and still less
water become much debilitated, we remained at this place where is good grass. A
small pentandrous plant (of the <i>Gentianaceae</i>) is now very frequent in
damp situations. The flowers are light brown, it is frequent on the arid sandy
flats.</p>
<p><i>23rd. Friday.</i> It was well advanced in the day before we were able and
ready to proceed forward on our journey, occasioned by the distances we are
obliged to fetch water. At about two miles on our route, arriving at a small
opening, we could distinguish some high mountains to the northward and westward
of us. Passing through a country covered with the melancholy <i>Acacia
pendula</i> we came to a gentle rising, but rugged sterile tract covered with a
tall thick brush, chiefly of plants before observed.</p>
<p>The Western Iron Bark and <i>Cupressus glauca</i> are the timbers of the
stony ascent. I here gathered specimens of a species of <i>Daviesia</i> with
linear rounded leaves, which are spinescent, the flowers are axillary and
bracteated. I likewise procured the following specimens:--<i>Leptospermum
sp.</i>, forming a slender spreading shrub 6-8 feet high, the flowers are in
pairs and axillary. <i>Eucalyptus acmenioides</i>, shrub about 12 feet high,
allied to <i>E. saligna</i>. <i>Eucalyptus dumosa</i>, leaves alternate,
ovate-lanceolate, fruit rough. This plant forms the principal shrub in a tract
of confined brushy scrub. <i>Melaleuca sp.</i>, allied to <i>M. uncinata</i>.
And a shrub of the class <i>Syngenesia</i>, a species of <i>Cacalia</i>, a
slender, twiggy shrub.</p>
<p>We saw some fine specimens of a tree which our people termed Snakewood; it
is not in flower, but has a small fimbriated capsule and its bark is rough and
scaly. Descending through a thick brushwood we came to a water channel (now
dry), but which from the recent appearance of water here we concluded some
might be discovered in the bottom to which the water course leads. Having
travelled nearly 10 miles we halted in this descent for the night. Our people
found some holes of excellent standing water about half a mile westerly of us
to the no small joy of the whole of us. Recent marks of natives on the trees.
Kangaroo were likewise observed at a distance. Much water has an outlet to the
lower parts of the country by this channel which is evident from the marks of
flood and the deep excavations formed (now dry) and no rain of any consequence
has fallen for a considerable period. Day continued fine, sultry, and the night
clear. On the brush or small timber the parasitical <i>Loranthi</i> are
common.</p>
<p><i>24th. Saturday.</i> It was deemed advisable to remain at this place the
whole of the day in order to rest our horses, all of which required that
indulgence. The barren brushy country around us appeared to afford me some
scope for botanical investigation, my time therefore was now occupied
throughout the day. The following are specimens collected:--<i>Goodenia
sp.</i>, closely allied to <i>G. ovata</i>, differing in having a leaf not too
finely serrated. <i>Prostanthera nivea</i>, a beautiful slender shrub with
large white flowers. <i>Prostanthera sp.</i>, a depressed shrubby plant,
<i>Myoporum gracile</i>, allied to <i>M. armillaris</i> a shrub 8-10 ft. high.
<i>Melaleaca sp.</i>, differing from <i>M. squamea</i> in the nerveless leaves,
and the spike of flowers apparently cylindrical, from the dispositions of the
remains of capsules.</p>
<p>This tract of country is covered with several <i>Eucalypti</i>, and
<i>Callitris glauca</i>. The Brushes (<i>Eucalyptus dumosa</i>) are overrun
with the <i>Cassytha</i>, whose filiform stems had so matted together as to
render a passage very difficult. I gathered seeds of the large blue-flowered
shrubby <i>Aster</i>, and also of the two species of <i>Melaleuca</i> above
mentioned. To my surprise I found a few plants of <i>Goodia lotifolia</i>
hitherto only known to be indigenous in Van Diemen's Island. The country is now
one continued level.</p>
<p>On our way back to the tent, which we did not reach till after dusk, we
passed some small holes of water, near which we disturbed a large emu and two
young kangaroo, which were feeding upon the trifling herbage which the
sterility of the country can only produce in small patches.</p>
<p><i>25th. Sunday.</i> Travelling over a continuance of brushy country for a
space of about 4 miles, the plants of which are duplicates of what I have
already collected, we came out upon a more clear open tract of land thinly
covered with <i>Icacia Pendula</i>, from whence we took bearings of a lofty
hill opening upon us, bearing S.S.W., distance about 7 miles. It may be worthy
of observation that among other signs of humidity this <i>Acacia</i> is one;
hence whenever we observed this grey tree we might on all occasions rest
assured that water was or had been in existence near it. The waterholes here
were but just dry! This kind of country continues about 3&frac12; miles, on
which I discovered a delicate blue-flowering <i>Erodium</i> with ternate
leaves, allied to <i>E. hymenoides</i>.</p>
<p>Entering again a thick and intricate brush, matted strongly with
<i>Cassytha</i>, I detected the following plants:--<i>Aster aculeatus</i> of
the East coast, and some other syngenesious plants abound. I gathered seeds of
a <i>Rhagodia</i>, a low depressed shrub, with rough seeds; and <i>Westringia
triphylla</i>, a stiff shrubby plant with angular stem and ternate leaves.</p>
<p>Advancing near the base of the Mount before us the <i>Grevillea</i> allied
to <i>G. sphacelata</i> observed on all rocky hills since 28th April last,
again presents itself. Approaching its ragged rocky foot we found some water in
small portions, in the excavations formed by the rapidity of the waters
descending from the Mount during the rainy seasons, and there being some good
grass for our horses we determined to encamp under the hill. Round its base and
on the lower lands the print of the feet of natives (of children as well as of
adults) were very visible. They had passed over it when the soil had been
softened by rain, and some of the impressions were of ankle depth.</p>
<p>We had travelled 11 miles, and our horses were much fatigued, more
particularly while passing the last <i>Cassythian</i> brush, where some of the
lighter laden horses had their burdens pulled from their saddles by the
strength of the plants. Mr. Oxley, Mr. Evans and myself ascended this hill on
the western side (which is highest and steepest), from whose summit we had a
very extensive view of the whole country around us. Mr. Oxley took several
bearings to the southward and westward of this Mount. A lofty range of hills
bearing about N.N.W., about 60-70 miles distant, he has called Mount Granard. A
range commencing at N.W. northerly, and terminating at about W.N.W. has been
termed Goulburn's Range, in honour of J. Goulburn Esq., of the Colonial Office.
A long range of hills commencing at W.N.W. and ending at S.W. by S., distant
about 25 miles, Mr. Oxley has named Peel's Range, in order to commemorate the
name of the Secretary of State for Ireland. Some hills lying behind one, and
from the point of view bearing southerly about 5 miles, are called Jones's
Hills, after a merchant at Sydney. At my suggestion Mr. Oxley has named the
commanding eminence Mount Aiton, in honour of W. T. Aiton, Esqre. at Kew,
author of the Hortus Kewensis, whose extensive knowledge in botany and
horticulture is well-known in the botanical world and needs no comments
here.</p>
<p>The lower flats of Mount Aiton have been fired by the natives, but the upper
range is covered with a great profusion of valuable and interesting plants,
many of which I have seen before, such as the <i>Aster</i>, whose beautiful
radiated blue flowers have decorated our dreary path more or less since we left
the boats. <i>Grevillea spacelata</i>, at its summit; <i>Tecoma Oxleyii</i> is
rare on the western face of this mount. I, however, detected the following new
plants <i>Correa sp.</i>, a shrub 4 ft. high; leaves ovate, obtuse, lanigerous
beneath; flowers terminal and solitary; corolla campanulate and green.</p>
<p><i>Prostanthera atriplicinifolia</i>, a shrub strongly scented with
turpentine. <i>Callitris sp.</i>, a small tree 25 feet high.</p>
<p>The perpendicular height of Mt. Aiton is presumed to be 250 feet, composed
of an indurated sandstone. To the northward we observed the smoke from several
native fires, and the country to the south and westward appears more open and
less bushy. The numerous tracks of emu and kangaroo suggested to us that this
eminence is frequented by these animals in search of water.</p>
<p><i>26th. Monday.</i> Our horses having strayed into the thick brush we were
detained the whole of this day under the mount.</p>
<p>It afforded me an opportunity of examining its rocky declivities with more
leisure and more minutely than I was enabled to do on the evening of yesterday.
I discovered a species of <i>Xerotes</i>, with linear canaliculated leaves;
panicle compound, loose and horizontal. <i>Hibbertia sp.</i>, with willowy
branches; flowers large and yellow. A species of <i>Goodenia</i> is very
frequent on the N.W. side. <i>Tetratheca sp.</i>, a shrubby juncous plant,
forming close bushes, smaller in habit than the species termed <i>T.
juncia</i>, in capsule and flower. <i>Lobelia erinoides</i>, producing a
beautiful long tubular blue flower.</p>
<p><i>Exocarpus cupressiformis</i> is a fine shrub on the rocks here. A species
of snake, chequered on the back like the common diamond snake of New South
Wales, but shorter and of a lighter brown colour, is by no means infrequent in
Western Australia on rocky hills. I killed a fine large specimen lying in a
dormant state on this mount. Two of our people who had been out 12 hours
returned with two of the horses and reported to us that the other three men,
who had been sent by Mr. Oxley in another direction, had fallen in with their
tracks and were tracing them back to our last encampment. Our dogs were on the
alert throughout the night. Some natives who had heard us from their encampment
westerly of us, induced by curiosity, had come in a circuitous route to the
lower range of rocks under the Mount in order to observe our motions. Some of
the people could hear them distinctly in conversation.</p>
<p><i>27th. Tuesday.</i> Fine clear weather. This morning we sent out two men
to their comrades with provisions and also to assist them in the search and
securing of our horses. At 2 o'clock p.m. two others returned unable to give an
account of the animals. At 5 p.m. the other men absent, who had with a
determined unwearied perseverance continued the pursuit of the beasts, returned
with seven horses, but could not find the other five. The delay occasioned by
this unfortunate affair enabled me to examine, ticket and pack my specimens.
One of our people, who had been sent with the dogs in search of kangaroo and
emu for us, saw a fine tall young man (native) not far distant from our tent.
The dogs had seized him before the person was able to call them off, but the
moment he was released from their grasp, he made a quick precipitate retreat in
a westerly direction. He was unarmed and perfectly naked, having a few cockatoo
feathers stuck in his hair. This sufficiently convinced us that our last
night's conjectures were not unfounded.</p>
<p><i>May 28th. Wednesday.</i> This morning we despatched four men mounted on
horseback in search of the five beasts missing. A large flock of emu descended
from the rocky heights of the Mount, but unfortunately we were unable to secure
any of them, our dogs being in another direction. We shot an owl which was
hovering around our tent. It was large and the feathers of the wing were
beautifully speckled with brown and darker colours.</p>
<p><i>29th. Thursday.</i> During the last night I was seized with a violent
ague (originating in a cold), which increased this day and obliged me to remain
at rest. The men sent in search of the horses returned without them. Our dogs
killed three emu which we found to be an excellent change from the salt
provision upon which we have of late entirely subsisted. Much wind at
night.</p>
<p><i>30th. Friday.</i> Found myself much relieved by the physic I had taken
last evening. We are still detained by the loss of the horses. Mr. Oxley,
accompanied by two others, left the tent in search of them, while Mr. Evans,
Fraser and Parr went on foot in a north westerly direction. They found the
following plants. <i>Brunonia sp.</i>, allied to <i>B. sericea</i> of Dr.
Smith, but smaller in all its parts; on grassy flats. <i>A stroloma sp.</i>,
allied to <i>A. humifusum</i>, having erect branches; in fruit. <i>Dodonaea
sp.</i>, leaves oblong, entire, margin revolute. Mr. Oxley returned with the
five horses about noon, which was a great subject of joy to us all. They had
strayed in search of water but a short distance from our old line of road N.E.,
and were stopped at about 7 miles distant from the tent. The party discovered a
nest of emu's eggs, amounting to ten in number; they are almost as large as an
ostrich's egg, and of a dark green colour. Mount Aiton is situated in lat.
34&deg;30' S., long. 147&deg;00'00" East, and distance from Sydney 420 miles
West Southerly.</p>
<p><i>31st. Saturday.</i> The whole of the horses having been found that had
strayed, and been secured the preceding evening, and having been detained five
days, Mr. Oxley was determined to proceed on our journey this morning with all
possible speed. Although not sufficiently strong and scarcely recovered of my
late attack, still I was unwilling to become the instrument of further delay,
and as the whole of us walk, all our horses being very heavily laden, I had no
other resource or alternative but to walk likewise.</p>
<p>Leaving the richer patches of good grassy land immediately around Mount
Aiton, the country again assumes a sterile and dreary aspect, covered with
small timbers of <i>Eucalyptus micrantha</i> and small cypress. Onward about
two miles we passed a small rising mount, near which is a water hole, now
perfectly dry. From the remains of a fire and grass burnt near the base of a
cypress tree, and from the fresh impression of human feet, it is clear that
natives had not left it two days. The country S.W. again becomes brushy,
producing plants of which frequent mention is made. <i>Hakea sp.</i>, allied to
<i>A. rugosa</i>, is observed here--a small tree 20 feet high. <i>Jasminum
sp.</i>; <i>Stenochilis longifolius</i>; <i>Bursaria spinosa</i> are all common
plants of these wastes. Crossing some lone rocky elevated spots, covered with
fragments of a red granite. Mount Aiton bore N.E. 6 miles. Descending on some
woody grassy lands of considerable extent, Jones's Hills appeared in sight, of
which Mr. Evans took bearings. Some old venerable <i>Sterculiae</i> of
considerable magnitude appear near this open situation.</p>
<p>At 9&frac12; miles we entered a very thick brush, which from the glaucous
hue of <i>Eucalyptus dumosa</i>, the usual and principal shrub of this
miserable tract, has the appearance of extensive plains from a distant view. We
had already performed the usual daily number of miles, which upon the average
we generally found prudent not to exceed, but we were led on under the
impression that the brush was not of any extent and that possibly we might fall
in with water and grass for our horses in the range of a mile or two further on
our course. Continuing through this thicket which we named <i>Euryalean
Scrub</i> (after one of the Gorgons), we found it grow thicker and exceedingly
difficult for our horses, so much so that a man led the way and cut an opening
for them. The whole is strongly matted together with <i>Cassytha</i> and other
climbing plants. At sunset we had travelled 19&frac12; miles but were not clear
of this scrub when we arrived at a small open space, where we were obliged to
halt for the night, although no water could be found for our horses or
ourselves.</p>
<p>Dismal as the brush was to all of us it nevertheless afforded me some new
plants, which recompensed me at least for the severity of the march through it.
They are as follows:--</p>
<p><i>Pimelea diosmaefolia</i>, a delicate shrub. <i>Grevillea acicularis</i>,
nova sp., a dwarf dense pungent shrub: <i>Leucopogon sp.</i>,
(<i>Epacridae</i>). <i>Viola sp.</i> <i>Dodonaea sp.</i>, a very small
flowering shrub. <i>Daviesia microphylla</i>, a small shrubby rigid plant.
<i>Bossiaea sp.</i>, distinct from <i>B. scolopendria</i> in the size of its
flower and fimbriation of its calyx and bracteae. <i>Callitris verrucosa</i>, a
slender tree 10-20 feet high. <i>Acacia conferta</i>, leaves broad, ovate and
carinate, capitulum of flowers axillary and crowded; forming a large dense
bush. A <i>spinescens</i> with the habit of <i>Daviesia</i> in having spiny
branches.</p>
<p>Among the combination of plants annoying us in this brush were a prickly
<i>Daviesia</i>, observed near Mount Maud, and a strong prickly grass (not in
flower) growing in large tufts about three feet high, and with the habit of
<i>Astragalus tragacantha</i>. We had taken the precaution to carry some dirty
water with us from Mount Aiton, which we served out at one pint per man.</p>
<p><i>1817. June 1st. Sunday.</i> The want of water obliged us to leave our
present station at an early hour in hopes of arriving at a more hospitable
tract of country affording us grass and water. At a distance of about 1&frac12;
miles we cleared this intolerable brush and came out upon an open forest
country equally sterile and covered with a coarse grass (<i>Dianella
divaricata</i>) and some other plants by no means interesting. Continuing our
journey about 8 miles, a miserable prospect before us (not a symptom or a sign
of the least running or stagnant water to be seen) we came to some rising
ground on which several naked bald rocks make a romantic appearance. From this
elevation we had a view of Peel's Range, three miles distant, which we
determined to make and halt for the day. At midday we encamped within half a
mile of it. We sent out people in search of water, which they found in some
holes at the immediate base of the Range. Served portions of dry provisions to
the people.</p>
<p><i>2nd. Monday.</i> Our horses were so much enfeebled and debilitated by the
late severe exercise and want of water that it was considered advisable to
remain the whole of this day under the range. Having attended to my plants, I
accompanied one of our party, Fraser, on a botanical excursion over these rocky
hills, which upon examination afforded me very few novelties, being chiefly a
repetition of the plants I have already collected of which <i>Dodonaea
pinnata</i>, <i>Grevillea sphacelata</i> and a <i>Phyllanthus</i> are most
predominant, We bore away S.W. to a very remarkable bluff point, distant about
3&frac12; miles. From the rugged declivities of Peel's Range I gathered fine
flowering specimens of <i>Eriostemon sp.</i> The country is broken with small
rocky hills, and covered with brushwood, which furnished me with the following
specimens. <i>Dianella sp.</i>, a new and beautiful plant.</p>
<p><i>Pimelea microcephala</i>, a new species, with large involucre to the
flowers. <i>Sida sp.</i>, <i>Acacia sulcata</i>, discovered on the S.W. coast.
The capitulurn of flowers is solitary, as well as geminate. Acacia sp.,
specimens in flower; this species differs from the preceding in its deciduous
bracts, and from <i>A. acicularis</i> in its geminate capitula. Ascending to
the summit of this elevated point, I gathered specimens of <i>Pomaderris
sp.</i>, <i>Ceanothus globulosus</i>, a strong shrub. <i>Glyceria sp.</i>, a
grass of the <i>Festuceae</i>. <i>Tecoma Oxleyi</i> is very common on the naked
rocks, in fine flower. The country to the southward and westward of us, as seen
from this hill, is exceedingly flat and barren.</p>
<p>This mount has been named in honour of Mr. George Caley a most accurate,
intelligent and diligent botanist, who laboured on the Eastern coast of this
continent a number of years with considerable success, and who well merits such
a mark of distinction. A corresponding mount southerly has been called Mount
Brogden, in honour of Charles Brogden, Esq., of Clapham.</p>
<p>Gathered <i>Stenochilus sp.</i>, <i>Croton sp.</i>, <i>Euphrasia sp.</i>,
leaves opposite, flowers blue.</p>
<p>The majestic bluff front of Mount Caley is very grand. The large granite
stones of which it is composed being covered with a red lichen, giving it a
tint and appearance of old brickwork. An inference may be drawn from the deep
gullies and rugged country we passed over at the base of the range of the great
bodies of water that fall on Peel's Range and descend, forming these
excavations, whose general inclinations are westerly. We searched in vain for
water; all the creeks are dry now. We returned to our tent at dusk. One of our
horses from debility, and in an attempt to rise up under his load, having
fallen down was so strained as to be rendered useless which obliged us to shoot
him. Our lat. is 34&deg;08'08" S., and long. 146&deg;42'25" E. Variation of
compass 7&deg;18'00" E. Our people made shoes of the skin of the horse.</p>
<p><i>3rd. Tuesday.</i> About 10 o'clock we departed from our encampment on a
S.W. course along the valley dividing a part of Peel's Range and arrived at the
base of Mount Caley about 1 o'clock. Being almost surrounded by the range and
finding the country somewhat on the ascent, Mr. Oxley went up to the summit of
Mount Caley in order to observe and discover any opening that would allow us to
pass to the flat country S.W. of Mount Caley and Mount Brogden. We, however,
found a ridge too elevated to be passed, especially in the present enfeebled
state of the whole of our horses. Descending into the lower lands, and passing
several large muddy holes now dry, skirted with <i>Acacia pendula</i>, we came
upon a patch of burnt grass about 4 miles S.E. of Mount Caley, where we stopped
for the day, having travelled about 9&frac12; miles. [This was Oxley's farthest
South.]</p>
<p><i>Eucalyptus sideroxylon</i> (western iron bark), specimens in flower and
some duplicates of others. We found water (after diligent search) in small
quantity, in a well that had been dug by the natives, about 5 feet deep. It was
of an indifferent quality.</p>
<p><i>4th. Wednesday.</i> Continued our stay at our present halting place. Mr.
Oxley sent two of our party to observe the general appearance of the country to
the southward of S.W. Occupied myself at my plants, ticketing my specimens,
etc. The small quantity of water discovered yesterday being expended, we sent
men with seven horses to a considerable waterhole discovered by myself
yesterday, about seven miles on the road back to our last encampment. Upon the
return of the two persons, they gave a very unfavourable report of the country
they had seen, in point of sterility and drought, as well as the intricacy and
difficulty of penetration, in consequence of the thick brushwood with which it
is covered. The native or wild dogs that were howling around us kept our own
continually upon the alert,</p>
<p><i>5th. Thursday.</i> Our latitude now is 34&deg;13'33" S., and long.
146&deg;39'50" E.; the variation of the compass 8&deg;08'06". Unwilling to
proceed in a particular direction until we have ascertained the nature of the
country to the northward and westward, I made an excursion in that direction.
Crossing the first range S. of Mount Brogden I descended into the valleys or
flats, which are in patches covered with brome grass, and of a tolerable good
soil, where I sowed some peach stones and quince seeds. Ascending a lofty range
(being a part of Peel's Range) running north and south, the view of the
north-west country is in a great measure hidden by other ridges still to the
westward. I descended the elevation on the western side, which furnished me
with no new plants, and passed through a small narrow valley, and reached a
third range (running S.W. and N.E.) of very steep and rugged ascent. The
country to the westward as seen from its summit is much broken with hills and
rocky declivities. I took bearings at upwards of 40 miles distant of hills and
mounts.</p>
<p>The bleak exposed rocks on this range are covered with an <i>Acacia</i> in
flower that has much the habit of <i>A. armata</i> found on the south coast.
The leaves, however, have scattered villi on their surface, and the spinescent
stipules longer.</p>
<p>The <i>Zieria</i> is in great abundance, and the rest of the plants are the
same as those seen previously. On my way back I gathered seeds of the following
plants:--<i>Camera eremophila</i>, a simple pinnate-leaved plant (shrub) 6-7
feet high. <i>Pimelea micrantha</i>, involucre of flowers scaly, an irregular
growing shrub. On the flats I gathered specimens of a <i>Lavatera</i>,
differing but little from <i>L. Africana</i>; frequent with a species of
<i>Senecio</i>, with the stalk purple, and the flowers yellow, large and
radiated.</p>
<p>No marks or signs of natives except on one tree which was very ancient, The
summits of all these ranges are covered with <i>Cupressus glauca</i>. Returned
about 7 o'clock in the evening. The country at the verge of the horizon
southerly is in flames, being fired by natives.</p>
<p><i>6th. Friday.</i> Our horses having acquired considerable strength in
consequence of two days' rest and good provender, we commenced our route on a
westerly course, working our way round the lower base of Peel's range through a
thick brushwood of seedling plants, of <i>Cypress</i> chiefly. The country
becomes more grassy and thinly covered with small timber of <i>Eucalyptus
micrantha</i> and <i>Cupressus glauca</i>. In these flats I gathered specimens
of <i>Pimelae linifolia</i> a slender gigantic shrub and <i>Dodonaea
heterophylla</i>, of which I gathered seeds. Having penetrated about 8&frac12;
miles on a W.N.W. course we halted at a spot where there was some tolerably
good grass for our horses. We found some fine clear water in a sandy hole under
Peel's Range, to the northward and eastward of our tent. Hitherto we have seen
no animals except a few kangaroo-rats in these wastes, however, some black
cockatoos saluted us as they passed over our tents. The creeping shrub, which I
had suspected to belong to the order <i>Asclepiadaceae</i>, I observed this day
(from a decayed flower) to be one of the <i>Rubiaceae</i> it has likewise the
stipules so characteristic of this extensive tropical order.</p>
<p><i>7th. Saturday.</i> We did not leave our halting place under Peel's Range
till a late hour, occasioned by the wandering of our horses. Continuing on a
course N.E. we arrived, after travelling about 8 miles, at some rising ground
of gentle ascent, covered with quartz and small pebbles of iron-ore stone.
Passing this elevation we approached the base of a small range of hills running
almost north and south, and finding grass we proposed to stop, being about 10
miles distant from our last night's encampment. The difficulty of passing
through the thick brushwood is very distressing to those of our horses whose
backs by the great friction and heavy burdens were not in the best
condition.</p>
<p>We had for some time seen the necessity of carrying water with us rather
than trust to the contingency of failing in with any holes at those places
where necessity herself might oblige us to halt. We had therefore filled,
previous to our departure, an empty keg with the excellent element found
yesterday, which we divided equally among the whole of us. After a long
wearisome and fruitless search none could be found here, although experience
had taught us to examine those places where probably it might, if it existed,
be detected.</p>
<p>I gathered flowering specimens of a <i>Cassia</i>, which is now the greatest
ornament of these deserts and might be termed <i>eremophila</i> from its being
found in such places; also a species of <i>Sida</i>, with lanceolate, ovate,
crenulate leaves; peduncles very long, 2-3 flowered. The timber is a small
cypress (<i>Callitris</i>), and Bastard Box, (<i>Eucalyptus micrantha</i>). The
grass, clear of the hills, is very dry and wiry, chiefly of a species of
<i>Bromus</i>. Our dogs had procured for us two kangaroo-rats which offered us
a fresh meal. Native dogs are frequent about the hills.</p>
<p><i>8th. Sunday.</i> Remained at the spot the whole of this day and sent our
people in different directions in search of water. I took a walk on the rising
ground near us, but made very few new discoveries, the country being covered
with <i>Acacia homalophylla</i>. At the base of the grassy hills near our tent,
which Mr. Oxley has termed Disappointment Hills, I found a species of
<i>Myoporum</i>, differing from <i>M. ellipticum</i> in the throat of the
corolla being more villous, and the anthers extended, the leaves are nerved as
in <i>Hakea dactyloides</i>. It is an observation I have frequently made that
the heads of the trees incline to the northward and eastward, indicative of the
prevalence of the south-westerly winds. Mounts and terminations of ranges are
bluff-like to the westward, generally evidently from the action of the air and
wind upon these points.</p>
<p>Our people are returned from different points after a fruitless search for
water. One small hole was discovered, with a quart or so in it. Our poor horses
are languishing for the want of this precious element. The arid appearance of
the country to the westward, has unavoidably obliged Mr. Oxley to change his
course again, rather than unjustifiably continue our journey over a country
that would destroy our horses and endanger our own lives by extreme drought. It
is therefore proposed to return to our last encampment where the grass is good
and where there is water for the horses and having renewed their strength to
proceed northerly and make the Lachlan River on the swampy lands occasioned by
its distribution, and we might hope to intersect the Macquarie River,
respecting whose course little or nothing is known.</p>
<p><i>9th. Monday.</i> Our journey this morning, independently of the painful
idea of tracing out steps back a stage, was rendered more disagreeable by the
continuance of small rain, which did not cease until we had arrived at the foot
of the range near our old encampment at the waterholes. The travelling is
excessively heavy and fatiguing to the horses, being very boggy, by reason of
the present wet weather, from which we might infer that a rain of two days
would render the whole tract of country wholly impassable. Mr. Evans and three
others who had gone on before us had made a large fire of cypress by the time
we arrived, and we were enabled immediately to shift and dry our clothes. While
our horses were enjoying their new pasturage, we were feasting ourselves upon
kangaroo-rats (secured by our dogs) and excellent good water.</p>
<p><i>10th. Tuesday.</i> We rested ourselves and the horses under the range the
whole of this day. In the afternoon I took a walk and examined the range above
us, and detected the following interesting plants:--<i>Indigofera sp.</i>, a
shrub 6-7 feet high. <i>Anthocercis albicans</i>, a slender twiggy shrub.
<i>Tecoma Oxleyi</i>, a few good seeds. The seeds of this plant are extremely
difficult to be procured, the moment they are ripe they are scattered and
eagerly devoured by the kangaroo-rats. <i>Acacia armatoides</i> [= <i>A.
armata</i>], some good seeds. <i>Teucrium sp.</i>, a species of
<i>Goodenia</i>, is very abundant on the ridge. The soil on the sides of the
gully is rich, dark and loamy. Returned at nightfall.</p>
<p><i>11th. Wednesday.</i> We continued at this resting place until we had
received some information respecting the country northerly of us. For this
purpose Mr. Oxley despatched two of our people in that direction and also
requested them to look out for a resting place where we might enjoy water of
any quality. Mr. Oxley has adopted this mode of proceeding rather than advance
on any particular course, with the doubt of finding grass or water to the very
serious injury of our horses. I availed myself of this opportunity, and was
occupied on the rocky summit of the range by which we are partly surrounded. I
gathered some seeds of a <i>Hibbertia</i>, so common in similar situations. The
<i>Zieria</i> is now richly in flower, from which I furnished myself with
handsome specimens. Among the seeds I collected this day the following are most
interesting:</p>
<p><i>Prostanthera atriplicinifolia</i>. <i>Bellis ciliaris</i> [=
<i>Brachycome ciliaris</i>], specimens in flower. <i>Lobelia senecioides</i> [=
<i>Isotoma axillaris</i>], seeds and specimens. <i>Senecio anethifolius</i>,
fine specimens, in shaded damp situations. The <i>Pomaderris</i> observed on
Mount Caley is common here, with another of the same natural family, a rigid
shrub with a white, hoary corolla. The hanging rocks are adorned with <i>Tecoma
Oxleyi</i> whose great profusion of flowers will always render the plant
valuable in Europe. The brush on the rocky declivities is very thick and
difficult to pass being held together by the wiry arms of the <i>Cassytha</i>.
On the highest part of the range I found two long pieces of the heart of an
<i>Acacia</i>, which I have called <i>A. doratoxylon</i>. These pieces of wood
were about 9 feet long, and had been split out of the centre of some trees of
this species that had been broken down by natives, and doubtless intended for
spears, as the wood agreed exactly in point of grain and texture with that of
all finished spears we have had opportunity of examining. Our presence at the
foot of the range had doubtless disturbed them at their work, which appeared
very new and fresh. The manufactory of these weapons must be a very laborious
task. When we consider that their tools are a mogo or stone hatchet and a
cockle shell.</p>
<p>A shower obliged me to return to our tent about 3 o'clock. Fraser and the
other man who had been out to reconnoitre returned at dusk, having found a good
halting place about 10 miles northerly. He brought me specimens of <i>Nicotiana
undulata</i>, whose long tubular corolla differs so materially in shape from
the other species of this genus, to which it was first referred by Monsieur
Ventenat and adopted by other botanists. He likewise brought me specimens of a
<i>Loranthus</i> with oblong-ovate, obtuse, wrinkled leaves and axillary
peduncles, parasitical on the snakebark, and a <i>Lotus</i>, with obcordate
cuneated foliage and red flowers. Our dogs killed several kangaroo-rats, among
which I observed a species of pigmy kangaroo with the head of a hare, it has
five toes to the forefeet as in <i>Macropus elegans</i>, it, however, stands
only about 14-16 inches high when resting upon its hind legs and tail. The skin
is dark gray, and the fur of a very fine texture.</p>
<p><i>12th. Thursday.</i> In the anxious hope of soon arriving at a tract of
country where the doubts of finding water and grass would scarcely exist, we
left our last two day's encampment, winding round the base of Peel's Range in a
northerly direction. The country now is of a grassy, woody character and broken
by gullies from the range in which we discovered running water. Passing some
dry water courses that intersected our course, the land is open and less
encumbered with timber, which is of the Bastard Box and Cypress. Tracing the
ridge to its base through tracts of the above description and bushy
alternately, we arrived at a small grassy creek furnished with a stream of
running water, where we stopped, having advanced about 10 miles by 2 o'clock in
the afternoon. <i>Jasminum sp.</i>, <i>Cryptandra sp.</i>, <i>Grevillea
sphacelatoides</i>, <i>Hibbertia</i>, 2 species, etc. are all common plants
observed in this day's route. A pentandrous tree of the order <i>Rutaceae</i>,
remarkable for its spreading habit, is covered with flowers; beneath its shade
some of the <i>Atriplicinae</i> and <i>Pimelea linariifolia</i> grow very
luxuriantly.</p>
<p>The <i>Salsola</i> so common on the plains of the Lachlan River was observed
this day, on this grassy land, which has evident signs of having been under
water in the rainy season. We noticed the recent impressions of the feet of
natives on the soft soil, which is less perforated by the kangaroo-rats than
some tracts of country to the southward and westward. <i>Brunonia sp.</i>,
before seen, is very common among the grass with some trifling
<i>Gnaphalia</i>. I gathered several pretty specimens of crystallized quartz
from some hills, over which our course led us. One of our people shot a bronze
pigeon.</p>
<p><i>13th. Friday.</i> Continuing our course about 9 o'clock this morning
under the range we crossed several small gullies, of which some had running
streams. The country has the same aspect as observed yesterday, being a
continuous brush and open forest land alternately. We had travelled about 14
miles when we came to a creek furnished with grass, and stopped for the night.
Water was found about 1&frac12; miles nearer the range. In a barren brush, of
which a <i>Meleleuca</i> (allied to <i>M. squamea</i>) and a species of
<i>Leptospermum</i> are most abundant. I gathered specimens of <i>Eriostemon
brevifolius</i> with linear, short, rough leaves. <i>Scaevola spinescens</i>.
<i>Anadenia anethifolia</i> a dense bushy plant. A <i>Loranthus</i> with
linear-lanceolate leaves in fruit, parasitical on snakebark.</p>
<p>Some very fine trees of <i>Sterculia heterophylla</i> were observed to-day,
one of which I measured, and found it 3 ft. 10 in. in diameter, although only
20 ft. high, with very strong horizontal spreading branches, forming a very
agreeable shade. <i>Acacia conferta</i> is now very common, first observed on
the 31st ultimo. Some patches of soil that had been inundated and in which I
observed <i>Pancratium Macquaria</i> [ = <i>Calostemma purpureum</i>], is rich
and good, being the deposition of the waters. The shelving, rocky appearance of
the creek on which we encamped suggested to us that considerable bodies of
water descend by this gully to the lower lands. We could clearly distinguish
from some rising ground over which we passed the low flat brush to the
westward, forming an impenetrable barrier against us. The latter part of our
course was N.E.</p>
<p><i>14th. Saturday.</i> Resuming our journey on a north west course for about
4 miles through an uninteresting scrub, we descended from the barren slopes of
the hills to a rugged creek containing small rocky excavations and standing
water. Unwilling to halt at so short a distance from our last night's
encampment, we continued our journey over a more open grassy and apparently
better tract of country, with timber of cypress of tolerable size, interspersed
with <i>Eucalyptus micrantha</i> (Bastard Box) of larger bulk than we have seen
them since we abandoned our boats. Arriving at a dry sandy watercourse, on the
margin of which grew some fine patches of grass (<i>Avena</i>), and,
luxuriantly, <i>Sonchus oleraceus</i>, our people who had traced the creek up
found plenty of water about half a mile out of our line of course, where we
halted and pitched our tent. <i>Dianella divaricarta</i>, <i>Prostanthera
nivea</i>, a <i>Hakea</i> allied to <i>H. rugosa</i>, <i>Tetratheca dumosa</i>,
<i>Boronia pinnata</i>, etc., are all common plants. I gathered some specimens
of <i>Sterculia heterophylla</i> in pods, and <i>Eucalyptus sideroxylon</i> is
observed sparingly near the creek, in which I detected a large flowering
<i>Goodenia</i>, with radical spathulate leaves.</p>
<p><i>15th. Sunday.</i> We remained the whole of this day at the creek and I
employed a few hours in repapering my specimens and booking the seeds that had
been collected some days previous. I took a walk to the continuance of Peel's
Range, about one mile distant, but discovered nothing new. Among the plants
frequently observed I recognised <i>Calythrix tetragona</i> of the Eastern
Coast, but a miserable stunted shrub, like the whole of the plants on this
sterile front of the range. I gathered some duplicate seeds of a
<i>Phyllanthus</i> and of <i>Persoonia scabra</i>, and a <i>Tetratheca</i>. The
summit of the range is covered with <i>Acacia doratoxylon</i>, <i>Cupressus
glauca</i> and <i>Casuarina macrocarpa</i>, all starved pigmy trees. The
margins of the creek are clothed with the western iron bark. Returned to the
tent about 2 o'clock.</p>
<p>One of our people who had been out in search of game came very near to a
solitary native, who was in the act of making his fire. He ran off with all
possible despatch, with a long spear with which he was armed. The afternoon,
which was very cloudy, produced a shower at dusk. To the northward and westward
some very singular ranges having some remarkable peaks can be seen from the
summits of Peel's Range. Mount Aiton bore S.E. by E., distant about 30 miles.
By observation taken this day our lat. and long. are as follows 33&deg;49'00"
S., 146&deg;33'00" E., variation of the compass the same as the last
observation. We are two miles north of Sydney. Showery at night.</p>
<p><i>16th. Monday.</i> In consequence of the wet weather and the very doubtful
appearance of the atmosphere we were prevented from stirring from our present
position. Our people reported to us the death of one of the most able
pack-horses of the whole troop. The animal had been strained in the loins, and
died of internal mortification.</p>
<p><i>17th. Tuesday.</i> About 9 o'clock we commenced our day's journey N.W.
northerly from the creek over a very barren rugged country, broken with
water-courses from the hills, now perfectly dry. Some grassy lands present
themselves, thinly covered with tolerable sized timber. On our left hand a
range of hills ran parallel with our course, and Peel's Range on the right
hand, above the usual level of which is observed a rising woody point bearing
about N.E., a few miles from us. Mr. Oxley has termed it Mount Barrow, in
honour of Barrow Esqre., author of "Travels in Southern Africa," and now of the
Admiralty Office.[*] Passing round the S.W. termination of Peel's Range we
continued our route about 1&frac12; miles and halted on a grassy open flat. Our
journey was about 10&frac14; miles, and as naturally might be expected the
ground was excessively soft and boggy. After a diligent search for water, about
a quart was found at dusk in a rocky hole of a small range, N. of Peel's
Range.</p>
<blockquote>[* John Barrow.]</blockquote>
<p><i>18th. Wednesday.</i> At daybreak we sent two others to the range of hills
near us in search of water, with directions to continue in the course of Mount
Barrow should they not be so fortunate as to find any nearer on the range or in
the gullies proceeding from it. They returned with a small quantity, enabling
us to distribute to each a pint for our breakfast. Our people who had been sent
to bring up the horses reported that there was some good grass a mile and a
half distant in a valley between the hills. Anxious to remove to a more
hospitable spot where water would in all probability be found, sufficient for
ourselves and horses, we proceeded forward with the most necessary and the
lightest of our provisions and luggage, leaving five casks of pork, which we
could send back for in the course of the day. About 2&frac12; miles N. easterly
over some rocky hills we descended to a fine rich valley of good grass and some
holes of rain water in the gullies, enough for ourselves and horses. We
accordingly pitched our tents in the valley and turned our horses out to feed.
Mr. Oxley sent the strongest of our animals for the casks of pork left at our
last resting place.</p>
<p>As a proof of the badly watered condition of the country we discovered a
hole that had been made with great labour by the natives very recently, and
containing a little dirty water. It is obvious that the gullies were dry three
days since, and that the late rains have supplied these cavities with the water
we now enjoy!! Our dogs killed a native dog, which was devoured among us! The
natives had not left the valley many days, because their huts of green branches
and remains of fires were so fresh.</p>
<p>Upon taking a survey of our dry stock of provisions in hand there appeared a
deficiency of a considerable quantity of flour, which at first view could by no
means be accounted for. It appears, however, from a little investigation that
took place this afternoon, that when on the river our boatmen hauled up one of
the boats too short--by her painter--to a tree on the bank, and in the course
of the night the water had fallen a foot, leaving the boat resting on her stern
whereby many casks were rolled out into the river and 300 lbs. weight of flour
totally lost. It was an accident they were fearful to communicate to any of us
till now by dint of cross-examination. This is a severe loss to us and will
oblige us to be content with a half ration.</p>
<p><i>June 19th. Thursday.</i> The country has been softened and bogged by the
late rains to such a degree as to prevent us quitting our encampment in the
valley this day, which is of essential service to our horses that are in very
bad condition. The hills bounding the valleys have been lately fired by the
natives. In the declivities I gathered the following specimens.
<i>Gentianaceae: Pentandria</i>: a second sp., of the same genus gathered on
the 22nd ultimo; this is of a smaller habit. I likewise gathered some specimens
of <i>Eucalyptus micrantha</i> or Bastard Box, the common timber of the
country.</p>
<p>Mr. Oxley took bearings of some remarkable points. Two very singular hills,
appearing to form a part of Goulburn's Range, bearing at N.W. about 12 miles he
has named Mount Brown and Good's Peak, in honour of Robert Brown Esqr. who
accompanied Capt. Flinders round the continent, and whose extensive knowledge
in the most refined and scientific parts of botany justly entitles him to that
degree of prominence in which he ranks among botanists in London. The peak is
thus entitled to commemorate the name of the late Mr. P. Good, the valuable
assistant of the above mentioned gentleman, whose death was a subject of such
regret to all who knew him. A species of <i>Solanum</i>, beginning to shoot
from its burnt stump, is very common in the hills.</p>
<p>I observed a small <i>Drosera</i> similar to <i>D. rotundifolia</i> in all
the gullies from the hills, in which grew some species of <i>Sterculia</i>. The
valley in which we are encamped receiving the washing of the hills on both
sides of it, north and south, if of a very rich soil. I sowed some quince seeds
and a dozen good stones of peach, which induced our people to call it "Peach
Valley." It appears less troubled with kangaroo-rats burrowing in it, and
consequently the seeds committed to its soil have a fairer chance of succeeding
than perhaps in a few other situations where I have sowed these seeds.</p>
<p><i>20th. Friday.</i> In order to lighten our baggage we overhauled the
ironwork that we had carried with us from the river, under the idea it would
have been found useful in our journey to the coast. On a tree we left ten pairs
of horse shoes, and some of the less useful parts of the boat builder's tools.
Following Peach Valley in a winding course for a distance of about two miles to
the rising point of a small stony hill thickly covered with some seedling
<i>Casuarinae</i> and western iron bark.</p>
<p>We observed the country to the northward and westward is a low flat tract of
land thickly covered with a dense scrub, and exceedingly sterile, which induced
Mr. Evans, who usually led the way, to change the course by turning up a low
foresty valley between the hills, in a northerly direction. At its extremity we
entered a very barren brush of small trees and shrubs, in a deep red soil,
which afforded me a few nice specimens viz:--<i>Stenochilus serrulatus</i>, a
shrub 4 feet high. <i>S. ochroleucus</i>, gathered duplicate specimens.
<i>Cacalia sp.</i>, leaves linear, a shrub observed on hills and rocky mounts.
<i>Aster cunealus</i> [= <i>Olearia stellulata</i>]. The <i>Loranthus</i>
[probably <i>L. linophyllus</i>] is now in fruit on the tree of the
<i>Rutaceae</i>, whose capsules are 2-valved, observed before. <i>Dodonaea
heterophylla</i>, a shrub with lanceolate leaves, was in flower, of which I
gathered specimens. Also a monaecious shrub allied to <i>Croton</i>, but having
a different capsule. Passing this confined brush and entering the flat deserty
country, covered with a low dense scrub, I observed a new <i>Bossiaea</i> and
<i>Anadenia anethifolia</i>, discovered on the 13th inst., to be the most
common plants of these gloomy wilds. I likewise noticed some of the
<i>Atriplicinae</i>, particularly a species of <i>Rhagodia</i>, with small
fleecy leaves and spinescent branches, forming a depressed horizontal spreading
brush. The whole is overrun with the beautiful <i>Clematis occidentalis</i>,
with pinnated ternate leaves, which are lanceolate and entire. I gathered seeds
of a <i>Pimelia</i>, with some others and a few duplicates, particularly of
<i>Isler decurrens</i> [= <i>Olearia decurrens</i>] and a herbaceous species
with reddish purple flowers. The thorny aculeated grass abounding in the
<i>Euryalean</i> scrub is frequent here.</p>
<p>Arriving at an extensive tract of burnt grass we traced it to the foot of
Peel's Range, near which we gave chase to a flock of about 20 emus. The dogs
killed one in the thick brush, but it could not be found. Following the range
about 1&frac12; miles we halted and pitched our tent beneath the shade of the
<i>Pentandrous</i> tree of the <i>Rutaceae</i>. I accompanied Mr. Oxley to the
summit of' the range. He is very anxious to lead us to more elevated country
clear of this sterile brushwood. Mount Brown and Good's Peak bore N.E. distant
1&frac12; miles. Upon another part of Peel's Range, divided from that on which
we stood, lay a narrow deep valley. Fraser crossed this valley and ascended the
western side of Good's Peak, which with Mount Brown and the whole of the range
is exceedingly rocky and barren. The plants found on Good's Peak are a species
of <i>Cacalia</i>, and an <i>Eriostemon</i>. Our day's journey is 10&frac14;
miles.</p>
<p>We could only find water in the holes of the gullies sufficient to serve all
and each of us one quart, but unfortunately none for our horses. The eastern
side of the Peak has been lately burnt by natives, whose fires we could
distinctly see at the base of a hill a few miles to the eastward of us. We sent
back a horse and man in search of the emu which the dogs had killed this
morning. In about an hour he returned to us with a fine large bird standing 8
feet high, which was distributed equally among ourselves and dogs. No variation
in the timber which is very much stunted.</p>
<p><i>21st. Saturday.</i> As our horses could not be supplied with water at
this station we were the more anxious to leave it at an early hour, proposing
to stop at the first spot where we might naturally conclude from appearance it
might be found by diligent search. Passing the burnt flats under Peel's Range,
we came to an elevated open but burnt country full of gullies and
water-courses, now dry, on which I observed the following plants.
<i>Helichrysum</i>, two new species, one a beautiful white flowered herbaceous
plant. <i>Erodium sp.</i>, scarcely different from <i>E. cicutarium</i>.
<i>Solanum sp.</i>, a very narrow lanceolate-leaved species, crowded with
prickles, in fruit. <i>Solanum, sp.</i>, allied to <i>S. lanceolatum</i>, but
without prickles. <i>Nicotiana undulata</i> [= <i>N. suaveolens</i>] is very
frequent on these flats, the lower leaves of which our people gathered, and
when dried found them not a bad substitute for its congener <i>N. tabacum</i>,
although not so strong a narcotic. <i>A Senecio</i> is likewise very common,
together with a species of <i>Goodenia</i>, whose leaves are oblong-lanceolate,
and serrated; flowers yellow.</p>
<p>The country again becomes bushy, presenting us with the same plants as have
been observed yesterday. Passing a mount that has been fired on our left hand,
and another equally rugged and sterile on our right, we continued over a flat
of burnt grass and scrubby spots alternately, until we arrived at a lofty mount
about 5&frac12; miles from our last night's halting place. We here stopped, and
sent out the whole of our people round the mount in search of water, which was
found near its summit on the eastern side. It is very rocky and barren, and has
been named by Mr. Oxley Barron's Hill, in honour of Barron Field, Esq., judge
of the Supreme Court in this Colony. [Oxley calls this hill Barrow's Hill.]
From it he took several bearings. Mount Bowen, so named in honour of Bowen
Esqre., of the Navy Board, which forms a part of Goulburn's Range, bore
northerly about 7 miles. We could perceive considerable bodies of smoke
ascending from the small timber, indicating natives being there.</p>
<p>A most romantic rugged bare range runs south and north. Mr. Oxley has called
it Macquarie Range, in honour of His Excellency the Governor. A lofty hill,
distant about 1&frac12; miles west, has been named Mount Flinders by Mr. Oxley,
to perpetuate the memory of the Australian circumnavigator, whose name it
bears. Barron's Hill is composed of quartz, pudding stone, and indurated
sandstone. We were obliged to drive our horses up the sides of this hill in
order to water them, which we did by serving it out to them in vessels.[*]</p>
<blockquote>[* Oxley wrote in his journal on this day that the land he now
passed through was uninhabitable for civilized man, but he afterwards came upon
the rich country watered by the Lower Lachlan, his farthest point being,
33&deg;57'7" S., long 144&deg;31'15" E. E.]</blockquote>
<h4>MOUNT FLINDERS AND BACK TO THE LACHLAN RIVER, 22 JUNE--11 JULY, 1817</h4>
<p><i>22nd. Sunday.</i> We rested ourselves and horses at this Mount the whole
of this day, which gave me an opportunity of attending to my specimens which I
had found in consequence of the late humidity of the atmosphere dried very
little. The day appearing to brighten up about midday, I determined to visit
Mount Flinders which bore from our tent west-northerly about two miles. On my
way to the east point I had to pass through a confined arid brush-wood, where I
discovered the following plants.</p>
<p><i>Cassia sp.</i>, leaves simple, linear-lanceolate; the flowers axillary in
pairs, <i>Cassia sp.</i>, specimens and seeds. <i>Rhagodia sp.</i> The
<i>Psychotria</i>, first observed on Mount Cunningham forms in the bush some
fine strong young trees, in fruit, but all abortive. It is a singular
circumstance that <i>Pimelea linearifolia</i> [= <i>P. micracephala</i>] is
uniformly found under the shade of a Pentandrous tree of the order
<i>Rutaceae</i> in company with some of the <i>Atriplicinae</i>; I observed it
in the bush in such situations. <i>Acacia pulverulenta</i> is frequent in fine
flower. The space between the outskirts of the brush to the foot of the mount
is open and covered with several syngenesious plants (Compositae) and
<i>Nicotiana undulata</i>.</p>
<p>Ascending the mount on the eastern side, which is very rugged, I found the
whole of this part to its summit and the southern side had been recently fired
by the natives, consequently it afforded me nothing, the whole being burnt to
the ground. Descending the northern and western declivities which are covered
with quartz and beautifully overrun with the showy <i>Tecoma Oxleyi</i>, I
distinguished a few new plants; among others less rare and previously observed:
Croton sp. a shrub 3-5 ft. high, which appears to be the same as
Labillardi&egrave;re's <i>C. viscosus</i>, which was discovered on the south
coast of this continent. Like that species my plant was viscid, and had
triquitrous branches and incrassated peduncles. It is diaecious. I invariably
found the male and female on separate trees. <i>Cassia sp.</i>, leaves
pinnated, with 3-4 pairs of linear leaflets; flowers axillary; a greyish shrub
common with preceding. <i>Acacia doratoxylon</i>, <i>Stenochilis
longifolius</i>, <i>Aster cuneatus</i> [= <i>Olearia stellulata</i>) and the
Tetrandrous Australian nut are very common with the preceding on the brow of
these hills, with the shrubby slender <i>Leucaena</i> and <i>Dodonaea</i>. I
procured a few more seeds of the <i>Tecoma</i>.</p>
<p>The gullies leading from Mount Flinders were very dry. The great bodies of
water evidently are absorbed in the red sandy flats at its base. The lat. and
long. of this mount are lat. 33&deg;26'30" S., long. 146&deg;20' E., and the
variation of compass 7&deg;45' E.</p>
<p>The country to the westward is an extensive flat, with a few small hummocky
hills scattered on its surface, having ranges at the extremity of horizon.
Finding the afternoon well advanced, I went round the south side of the Mount
and bore easterly for our tent. I gathered specimens on the grassy flats of a
small-flowered glutinous <i>Gnaphalium</i>. About 6 o'clock I reached our
encampment. Fraser, who had been to Mount Bowen, returned at about the same
period and brought me a new <i>Eriostemon</i>, with linear tuberculated leaves
and white flowers. The <i>Pancratium macquaria</i> [= <i>Calostemma
purpureum</i>] so prevalent on inundated flats is found on the summits of this
range in a very rich decayed vegetable soil. Also <i>Sterculia heterophylla</i>
and <i>Acacia doratoxylon</i>.</p>
<p><i>23rd. Monday.</i> We again watered our horses from the rocky excavation
on the Mount [Barrow], reserving some for our keg and bottles, previous to
breaking up our encampment and departing from the hill. About 10 o'clock we
pursued our route northerly, with the faintest hopes of falling in with any
water for our horses in the low tract of flat country before us. Passing a
sterile brush for the first 4&frac12; miles, we entered upon an extensive clear
plain free from timber trees or shrubs, and as we advance there is an obvious
change of soil, being much darker than the dry hard deserts behind us, and of a
clayey and binding nature, retaining the rain water on its surface. At length
the same description of vegetables so common on Field's Plains, on the Lachlan
River, began to appear, inducing us to form many conjectures as to the probable
country to which this sudden and remarkable change might lead us. Our dogs got
on the scent of game, and it was not long before they ran down two kangaroos
and an emu. The plains are skirted by a species of <i>Eucalyptus</i>, which
takes the place of <i>Acacia Pendula</i>, so abundant on Field's Plains. The
northern extremity of Peel's Range, of which Mount Brown forms a part, presents
from a retrospect view a noble bluff point, which Mr. Oxley has called
Dryander's Head, in honour of the late Jonas Dryander Esqre., of Soho Square,
London. The northern termination of Macquarie Range runs out into a singular
headland, entitled by Mr. Oxley Cape Porteous, after his friend Captain
Porteous, of the Royal Navy, and late of the Porpoise Storeship. Having crossed
the plains we observed some swans flying over our heads, a circumstance, when
considered with the extraordinary change of country, which induced us to
conclude we could not be far from bodies of water. We immediately came to a
lagoon of water, which we traced up a short distance to its connection with a
river or stream about 20 feet wide and of moderate depth, running generally
westerly and at the rate of 2&frac12; knots per hour. This singular and
surprising circumstance gave rise to many conjectures what this stream is,
whether the Lachlan or Macquarie or distinct from either.[*] When we left the
N.W. branch of the Lachlan River on the 18th ultimo, there was a considerable
and increasing fresh or flood, the water rising to the level of the banks and
beginning to disperse its waters on the flat country, now N.E. of us. Had it
found an outlet this increased body of water must have gone with it through all
its windings to this spot where we have intersected it. It appears, however,
very evident that there has not been any flood for a considerable time, from
the circumstance of holes containing white clayey water appearing in the creek
that runs from the river to the lagoon, and through which it is supplied by the
river. Mr. Oxley observed that it might be the Macquarie, which was likewise
the opinion of Mr. Evans. If it is the Lachlan, the two arms join again in the
swamp and form an outlet running through all its windings not less than 100
miles to this remarkable spot, which is about 8&frac14; miles N. of Barron's
Hill of our late encampment.</p>
<blockquote>[* Oxley had now reached the Lachlan again.]</blockquote>
<p>The banks of this river are high and clothed with the Eucalyptus or Blue Gum
of very large size, and the whole of the plants are duplicates of those I have
seen on the Lachlan River. The flats had signs of inundation. We encamped on
the bank and turned our horses out to feed on its rich herbage, among which I
discovered a species of <i>Senecio</i> remarkable for its short calyx being
half the length of the florets. I gathered seeds of <i>Aster decurrens</i> [=
<i>Olearia decurrens</i>], and duplicates of a species of <i>Cassia</i>, and
specimens of <i>Dodonaea heterophylla</i>. The <i>Eucalyptus</i> skirting the
plains is about 20 ft. high; branches slender and drooping, and has much the
habit of <i>Acacia Pendula</i>. The plains have been called by Mr. Oxley,
Strangford's Plains, in honour of Lord Viscount Strangford, our late minister
to the Court of Brazil. They produce a species of <i>Anthericum</i> with a
fasciculated root and a fistular leaf, and a pigmy species of
<i>Sowerbaea</i>.</p>
<p>Our people by way of experiment threw some baited hooks into the river, and
they caught five fine fish of the same kind of perch as that of the Lachlan
River, enough for the whole of us. Among the high grass we found a bark canoe,
and Mr. Oxley, who was the first of our party that arrived at the bank,
observed a native man running off down the river. The day continued fine, and
the travelling, when we arrived on the plains, was tolerably good. Mr. Oxley
intends to trace this small river for three miles, as far as our provisions
will allow us to advance westerly. Trusting, from general appearances, we shall
be able to arrive at its termination or learn something more respecting it that
will enable us to clear up the doubt at present existing.</p>
<h4>MOUNT PORTEOUS. OXLEY EXPLORES THE LOWER LACHLAN</h4>
<p><i>June 24th, 1817. Tuesday.</i> Relieved from the dreadful uncertainty of
finding water, which has of late harassed us, we commenced a new course this
morning on the bank of the rivulet. We found, however, it much better to leave
this stream and take the margin of the plain in order to make a true westerly
course. The plains are uninteresting in this day's journey, the soil is a stiff
clay, sufficiently retentive to hold rain water upon its surface, rendering the
travelling fatiguing. The gullies, of which we passed several in this day's
route, all have their inclination from the river, and were dry, showing
evidently that the lagoons with which they are connected derive their supplies
from the river's inundation through those channels, all tending to establish
the hypothesis that this river is not the Lachlan. Our courses were variable,
at first S. and S. by E., in order to clear the low swampy lands, and lagoons,
and afterwards S.W. and westerly, when having cleared 11&frac12; miles we
struck in for the river and halted on its banks. It appears at this spot wider,
being about 25 feet, having a current running half a knot per hour. I observed
its channel frequently choked up with fallen timber, so that if we had had the
boats it would have been almost impossible to have formed a passage for them. I
observed marks (scarcely a day old) made by natives on the <i>Eucalypti</i>, of
which <i>E. Pendula</i>, allied to <i>E. paniculata</i> of Dr. Smith is
frequent. The plants of the plains are an <i>Erodium</i>, before observed;
<i>Pancratium Macquaria</i> [= <i>Calostemma purpureum</i>]; <i>Sowerbaea
juncea</i>, and two species of <i>Mesembryanthemum</i>, fine in flower; one
<i>M. aequilaterale</i>, so frequent in arid sands about Port Jackson, and well
known by the colonists under the strange title of "Pig's face"; the other
species is of much smaller habit. and appears to differ from <i>glaucescens</i>
and <i>nigrescens</i>, to which it is very closely allied. In some bushy barren
spots, I gathered seeds of <i>Cassia lineata</i>, and some duplicates of
<i>Pittosporum lanceolatum</i> and <i>Stenochilus longifolius</i>. In order to
take bearings and observe the appearance of the country westerly, Mr. Oxley,
Fraser and myself proposed to walk to the northern extremity of Macquarie
Range, which has been as before stated, called Cape Porteous, distant from our
tent about 8 miles westerly. In passing through a wood skirting the plains we
came to a native encampment of many bark huts of recent erection. Of the many
hypotheses formed upon matters connected with this expedition, the use to which
the natives appropriate the oblong square pieces of bark (cut from the stem of
the Blue Gum and so frequently observed on the river) is one. There were two of
these "Barks" at this Australian Camp, perforated with holes in lines after the
following manner.</p>
<center>
<p><a name="a0301141h-21" id="a0301141h-21"></a><img alt="" src="0301141h-images/0301141h-21.jpg"></p>
<h4>FACSIMILE OF THE BARK</h4>
</center>
<p>Fraser who had seen similar pieces of bark round the native fires under
Mount Bowen on the 22nd inst., found them with little wooden pegs in the holes.
Those found at this place had none. Mr. Oxley is of the opinion that they might
be conversation cards, by which one division of a tribe is enabled to give
information to another party coming after them, the course they are pursuing or
any other matters that they may deem necessary. Their different ideas may be
expressed by a transposition of the pegs understood by each party? These cards
when perused by the succeeding troop of natives are destroyed and the pegs
taken out which we observed in one of the pieces that had been broken.</p>
<p>Passing round a lagoon of considerable magnitude at its head near the river,
where it was dry and muddy, we came to the edge of the plain, and took a
bearing of the highest point of the cape. In not less than an hour we arrived
at its base, which is composed of shelving rocks overlapping each other, over
which we had to climb in order to gain the summit of the lower range. This was
the only part of the mount I was able to examine. It was interesting, although
productive of nothing new or not before observed. <i>Correa speciosa</i>,
enjoying the shade of the overhanging rocks, now very luxuriant, so much so
that I was induced to furnish myself with better specimens than I was in
possession of--gathered at Mount Aiton. <i>Anthocercis albicans</i>, rich in
flower. <i>Croton viscosus</i> in flower and fruit. <i>Acacia doratoxylon</i>
advancing to flower. <i>Grevillea sphacelata</i>, <i>Scaevola spinescens</i>
and <i>Dodonaea heterophylla</i> are all abundant. We had underrated the
distance of this mount from our tent, and the afternoon being far advanced
before we could reach it, prevented us from descending to its extreme
elevation. Mr. Oxley having made his observations, proposed to return by the
same route to the tent. On our way I gathered the following new plants:--I
discovered a new <i>Amaryllis</i>, it was in its winter habit, a few decayed
leaves above ground enabled me to trace its roots below the surface which are
very large. It appears to be a white flowering species and the corolla is about
the size and figure of that of <i>Conostylis aemula</i> which I ascertained
from the remains of a flowering stern. Fearful of being benighted in these
wastes, I was only able to procure 6 large roots. I gathered specimens of a new
and remarkable Acacia, whose long narrow leaves have induced me to propose the
trivial name of stenophylla. Also of another species of <i>Acacia</i>, a small
tree 20 ft. high, with long lanceolate leaves, slender pendulous branches, and
axillary heads of flowers. <i>Acacia acicularis</i>, <i>A. calamifolia</i>, and
A. pulverulenta are common in the brush. Our dogs killed a little animal of the
kangaroo family, with a long tail, singular for its flat hairy formation at the
point. A native dog was killed, which had approached too near our tent. I
discovered on the slimy plains a new species of the triandrous genus
<i>Arthrotriche</i> with a dense pyramidal head of flowers. We did not return
to our encampment on the river before 7 o'clock p.m.</p>
<p><i>25th. Wednesday.</i> We had passed the night in a swamp. Upon resuming
our journey down this river we steered a course south of west, in order to head
the lagoon seen yesterday and to avoid bogging our horses by attempting to pass
it on the river's bank. Passing the Cape Point we travelled northerly over a
considerable tract of descending flats, on which I discovered a new species of
<i>Cryptandra</i>, having the largest corolla, which like its congeners is
white, and the greatest profusion of flowers of the whole of the species I have
seen. We discovered a few more of the new <i>Amaryllis</i> near the northern
extremity of Macquarie Range. The scrubby parts consist of the new
<i>Bossiaea</i>, <i>Scoevola spinescens</i> <i>Anadema sp.</i>, with some
others, common in such situations. Passing a brush of seedling Cypress
(<i>Callitris</i>), a considerable flat opened to the view, which Mr. Oxley
named Smith's Plains in honour of Sir James Edward Smith Kt., botanist and
physician and author of several most valuable works, as well on the botany of
Australia as of countries less remote. On these plains is a plant allied to
<i>Bellis</i>, perhaps a <i>Cotula</i>, with an elongated cuneate leaf and
stipitate seeds. I gathered specimens of a <i>Bellis</i> with a solitary flower
on a long naked stem. Penetrating through another brushy tract at the extreme
of the plain we made the river, but our people and horses, who had continued
northerly, had halted one mile above us on the bank. Mr. Oxley, Fraser and
myself returned to them.</p>
<p>In the circuitous route we had travelled to-day we had made upwards of 11
miles, which on a true west course is about 9&frac12;. The twining shrub
frequently observed proves to be an <i>Asclepias</i>. I detected it with a pod
or follicle upon it. The river has much the same appearance in point of width,
and is tolerably clear of dead timber, but subject to many abrupt windings, and
the banks in places are high. <i>Acacia sp.</i>, and <i>A. stenophylla</i> are
very strong on the immediate banks of the rivulet, the herbage of which is the
same as on the Lachlan River. The timber is the Bastard Box or <i>Eucalyptus
micrantha</i>, <i>Eucalyptus</i> allied to <i>E. paniculata</i>, with pendulous
branches, and <i>Callitris glauca</i>. The rivulet has a course considerably to
the northward of west since our last encampment. A little <i>Euphorbia</i>
covers the ground where it has been inundated.</p>
<p><i>26th. Thursday.</i> Being desirous to continue our journey this day as
much on a westerly course as the nature of the country would admit, we left our
resting place and entered a dense brushy scrub, abounding with the same
description of plants as I have frequently observed. I gathered 5 specimens of
<i>Eriostemon rotundifolius</i>, forming a round dense bush. I likewise
gathered seeds of <i>Stenochilus ochroleucus</i> and its congener <i>S.
longifolius</i>. Several species of <i>Rhagodia</i> appear among others in this
scrub. The Bastard Box is frequently much encumbered with the twining adhering
<i>Loranthus aurantiacus</i> which</p>
<blockquote>"Scorning the soil, aloft she springs<br>
Shakes her red plumes and claps her golden wings."</blockquote>
<p>Having passed the brush, we travelled over large clear plains, which are
boggy and fatiguing for our pack horses. They are skirted by <i>Acacia
Pendula</i> and dwarf eucalypti and the herbage is chiefly the <i>Erodium</i>
and some new syngenesious plants already observed. Continuing our route about 9
miles, having passed several short brushy spots and small open grassy plains
alternately, we approached close upon the banks of the river and halted for the
day. The last mile of our journey is through a thick grassy open swamp, where I
gathered a species of <i>Artemisia</i>. The river now presents to us another
appearance. The banks are not so high, the timber is more diminutive, and the
land or flats on each side bears clear marks of inundation, although not
recent. This, considered with the current being scarcely perceptible, induces
us to conclude that we are fast approaching to its termination. A species of
<i>Satureia</i> grows strong in the swamps, which our people gathered and made
use of as tea. A species. of <i>Senecio</i> is very common.</p>
<p><i>27th. Friday.</i> In order to rest our horses we remained the whole of
the day at our present encampment. By observation taken by Mr. Oxley, the site
of our tent is in lat. 33&deg;32' S., and long. 145&deg;56' E., and the
variation of the compass 7&deg;20'00' E. Our huntsman, who had been in pursuit
of game about 3 miles down the river, returned and reported the extreme
swampiness of the land on each side, rendering it impossible to continue on its
banks in our advancement south westerly. The fishermen were unable to secure
any fish, the weather being too cold. Great abundance of black swans, native
companions, (<i>Grus australasiana</i>) wild ducks etc., are on the lagoons.
One of our party shot a pair of ducks; the bronze of their wings is exceedingly
beautiful.</p>
<p><i>28th. Saturday.</i> In consequence of the unfavourable report of our
people respecting the inundated country before us, Mr. Oxley rode on horseback
on the immediate bank of the river about 7 miles, until he was unable to
advance, by a creek running from the river to lagoons in the background. Mr.
Evans, who led the way for our horses, kept well out southerly from the river
in order to head the swamps and lagoons, among which it is impossible to
travel. On the boggy lands I gathered specimens of seeds of a <i>Teucrium</i>.
<i>Salsola sp.</i>, leaves round and fleshy; capsule hoary. <i>Sida sp.</i>,
with very narrow lanceolate leaves and axillary small flowers, forming a small
branching shrub. <i>Polygonum junceum</i> [= <i>Muehlenbeckia Cunninghami</i>]
overruns all other plants in these gloomy swamps. The passing eye rests with
pleasure on a a beautiful tree of the <i>Bignoniaceae</i>, frequent in the
solitary shades of a brushwood surrounding these bogs, From these sterile spots
we continued our route northerly, in order to make the river, but we only
entangled ourselves in swamps; and Mr. Evans found after penetrating 7&frac12;
miles that it was impossible to proceed near the river's bank. The whole
country south and south-west being under water for at least 3 feet, we were
obliged to return to the brush, where we halted and pitched the tent near a
very extensive inundated tract of Blue Gums in several feet of water, above the
level of which we observed on the timber marks of floods 2&frac12; and 3 feet
higher. The natives had cut out several conversation cards or barks from these
trees, which doubtless they find are more easily extracted from the Blue Gums
in water than any other species of Eucalyptus on dry spots. This immense sheet
of water, which shines through the trees westerly as far as the eye can see,
has great numbers of swan and all other kinds of waterfowl upon it. Those most
invaluable, faithful animals and bush companions, our dogs, caught a fine large
emu, which was equally divided among them and us. The plants on the margin of
the lake are the same as we observed near Farewell Hills, viz: <i>Mimulus
sp.</i>, <i>Lythrum sp.</i>, allied to <i>L. hyssopifolia</i>, and a little
<i>Adiantum</i>. The plains we travelled over to-day have been called
Harrington Plains in honour of Lord Harrington. We did not make above 4 miles
on a true west course.</p>
<p><i>29th. Saturday.</i> We continued our journey on a true westerly course,
determining, if possible, to make the river, but we are rather inclined to
suspect that we are not far from the spot where the river ceases altogether, or
where from the depression of the country, its banks being too low to contain
it, a general inundation commences. Having crossed a grassy woody swamp, with
occasional scrubby spots, we arrived at a large expanse of open country, a
continuance of Harrington Plains.</p>
<p>Crossing this flat we came to the banks of the river, which are much higher
than could have been reasonably expected. The channel is in some places very
shoaly and narrow and blocked up with drifted decayed timber. Its inclination
being considerably southerly of west we changed our course and crossed the
plains in that direction. The loose hollow nature of these plains was very
heavy for our horses, and in some measure fatiguing for ourselves. The animals
frequently sunk under their loads up to their knees in its poor sour soil which
produces a plant of the genus <i>Galium</i>, and a new plant[*] of the same
order as Brunonia with remarkable undulated leaves. I likewise gathered
specimens of a species of Xerotes (aspen). The scrub afforded me a new Acacia,
with linear, round and sulcated leaves, in pod. We had advanced about 11 miles,
when Mr. Oxley proposed to halt in a dry situation about 2 o'clock.</p>
<blockquote>[* Cunningham named it <i>Arthrotriche</i>. He first saw it on
Field's Plains, but it has no connexion with the plant of that name described
by Mueller, and seen during Gregory's expedition of 1861.]</blockquote>
<p>We now see the fallacy of forming any ideas respecting this stream; all our
conjections of yesterday are overthrown by observations of this day. We have
(by a little perseverance) passed the swamps that obliged us to turn back
yesterday, and have now before us to all appearance a considerable journey if
we are determined to see the termination of this stream. The bank on which we
encamped is very high, and of a red sandy marl, and the soil of the flats very
rich, being the depositions of floods, and producing an abundance of a species
of <i>Anthericum</i> before noticed. The opposite bank, which is lower, has
been lately flooded, and the whole country inundated at no very distant period.
I gathered seeds of an <i>Aster</i>, an herbaceous plant with blue radiated
flowers, and an <i>Achyranthes</i> from the swamps. Some plains on the right
(north) side of the river we termed Holdsworthy's Plains. Those unwearied
purveyors, our dogs, provided for us two of the largest emu we have ever seen
on the expedition, standing at least 8 feet high. We are not likely to starve,
although our flour and pork ration is exceedingly scanty. Our fisherman caught
only one small fish Of 3&frac12;-4 lbs. weight.</p>
<p><i>30th. Monday.</i> Advancing over the plain westerly, on the edge of which
we had encamped last night, we continued that course about 7 miles; bushy
country affording me nothing interesting; the plants being the same as those of
which so very frequent mention has been made. We made the angle of a large
lagoon of considerable depth, thickly clothed with trees that had marks of
inundation about 4 feet above the present level of its waters, and a few inches
above the general flatness of the plain. I here gathered specimens of a species
of <i>Eucalyptus</i> having a submucronated hemispherical operculum, and
flowers of two colours, red and white, in terminal panicles, a tree about 30
feet high. I observed a little cryptogamous plant, called <i>Azolla
pinnata</i>, floating on the surface of these waters in considerable abundance.
Near our 8th mile Harrington Plains are in some measure terminated by a few
scattered trees of <i>Eucalypti</i> stretching themselves across to the
opposite brush in an irregular manner. Its continuance, open and extensive,
evidently descending at its south western extremity, from the circumstance of
our being able to distinguish the heads of trees and not their stems. Mr. Oxley
has called them Molle's Plains, in honour of the late Lieut.-Governor, Colonel
Molle. Passing through a small tract of the burnt scrub called <i>Polygonum
junceum</i> [= <i>Muehlenbeckia Cunninghami</i>] we continued our journey about
a mile and a half, when we considered that our horses, which were far behind,
would scarcely be able to come up with us, in consequence of the bogginess and
decayed nature of these plains. We passed through a thick brush of the rushy
<i>Polygonum</i> and came upon the bank of the river, intending to halt for the
night. On these plains I gathered seeds and specimens of a shrub with fleecy,
sulcate crowded leaves. These leaves are like the succulent <i>Salsola</i>.
Also another shrub entirely clothed with wool, having an echinated nut, many
seeded. I observed a singular grass, dead, with long beards [stigmas] as in
<i>Zea</i>; and the little recumbent <i>Zygophyllum</i>, which is sometimes
very common, and in some instances appears to differ in habit, which may be
caused by the shade or being smaller in all its parts, or which may be effected
by increased sterility. The appearance of these plains is that of a gloomy
desert with stunted trees and dry wiry tufts of grass. But if anything tends to
enliven the scene or relieve the eye it is the bright golden flowers of a
<i>Senecio</i>, with pinnately laciniated leaves. I gathered seeds of a shrub
of <i>Anredera sp.</i>, producing a bladdered capsule, 2-winged, containing a
single seed in the centre. The river is as broad as ever! With little
alteration, current slow, but the banks appear not so high as where we left it
in the morning, and are muddy. We started two native dogs on the plains before
us. We observed the marks of the natives on the trees, and the old impressions
of their feet on the soft clayey soil. We likewise passed an old native bark
hut. The general inclination of the river is south-westerly. Its banks are
furnished with tolerable Blue Gums and <i>Acacia stenophylla</i>. One of our
party caught a species of lizard on the plains, having on the back very rough
scales, which are not imbricated but distinct from each other. It has no tail.
Its body being terminated in a wedge-shaped stump.</p>
<p><i>1817. July 1st. Tuesday.</i> In consequence of the heavy bad country we
passed over yesterday we considered it advisable to rest the horses the whole
of this day. By observation it appears our lat: is 33&deg;32'22" S., and long.
145&deg;38'30" E., and the variation of the compass is 6&deg;49'00" E. The
river at our encampment is 20 ft. wide, and upon sounding, we found 6 ft. to be
the greatest depth. Our people caught a few fish 2 or 3 lbs. in weight.</p>
<p><i>2nd. Wednesday.</i> The native dogs, which were howling around us during
the night, kept ours upon the lookout. A small hailstorm, seconded by a shower
of rain, detained us a few moments. At 10 o'clock our baggage-horses and
ourselves left the banks of the river and proceeded in a south-westerly
direction over the plains, which are not much softened by the morning showers.
I gathered duplicate seeds of <i>Lobelia sp.</i> (closely allied to <i>L.
purpurascens</i>), from the swamps; in which humid situations <i>Haloragis
tetragyna</i> accompanies a species of <i>Achyranthus</i>, with whorls of
flowers. At 10 miles on a south-westerly course we struck in for the river, at
which we arrived in 4 miles and halted, the horses considerably behind us. The
river here is very shallow and muddy, not exceeding 3 feet; the banks are low,
and the current runs about half a knot per hour, the water of which is turbid
and of a fetid scent. The Blue Gums we daily observe do not appear upon the
plains and are only to be seen on the immediate banks of the river, which they
clothe pretty thickly, forming large heads and bulky timber, but, like many of
its congeners, hollow. It may not be altogether amiss to mention here that the
tubular stems of several species of <i>Eucalyptus</i> on the eastern coast,
when well selected, have proved tolerable good conductors of water and have
been turned to good account in draining land. The plains now appear very
extensive and of considerable width, and of such continuance to the southward
and westward as to be lost in the horizon, forming one continued dead flat.</p>
<p><i>3rd. Thursday.</i> We were enveloped in a very thick fog, by which we
were unavoidably detained until the mist had in some measure evaporated.
Leaving the river about noon we advanced on a course southerly of S.W. over the
plains, which are an immense expanse of flat open country. They are exceedingly
barren and naked for the first 8 miles. About 3 o'clock p.m. we altered our
course, steering westerly in order to make the river, but we were much deceived
in its distance from us. On this course we saw <i>Stenochilus longifolius</i>,
<i>Acacia Pendula</i>, <i>Rhagodiae</i> and some <i>Salsolae</i> miserably
stunted.</p>
<p>Arriving at the angle of a wood near an old native encampment we halted at
sunset, having travelled 11&frac14; miles, about 11 miles southward of the
river, where we found plenty of water in a lagoon abounding with wild fowl. We
noticed very recent impressions of the feet of some natives, one of them was
very small, and might have been that of a woman. We were induced to hope that,
from the very recent marks of the feet of emu upon the clayey soil, our dogs
would have been able to secure one or two of these birds, which would have very
materially benefited the whole of us, the ration that could only be allowed us
being by no means sufficient to satisfy the keen appetites augmented by hard
corporeal exercise. We shot a brace of pigeons of a new species, wings brown,
with pinion feathers white, slightly bronzed, and green breast, slate colour;
and they are rendered more handsome by reason of the small tuft or topknot of
feathers on their heads. Some other strange birds were observed (supposed to be
Parrots), about the size and flight of a pigeon, with beautiful red breasts;
they were noticed to fly generally in pairs to and from the northward.</p>
<p><i>4th. Friday.</i> The birds observed last night, and which I suspected to
be of the parrot kind, flying to the northward, returned this morning, flying
in flocks to the southward. They are of a light ash colour on the back and
wings, and have rich pink breasts and heads.[*] Resuming our route westerly
about 2 miles we came to extensive low swamps and inundated woods of Blue Gum,
on the margin of which were several native huts, built rather stronger than
usual, evidently in the wet season, and having a loose thatch of red grass.
Upon entering these abandoned Aboriginean houses, I found several conversation
cards or barks perforated as before described, some fish, a snake bone and some
mussel shells. Obliged to change our course, we passed about 6 miles southerly
of west, until we were stopped in our progress by a small creek running from
the swamps or wooded lagoons. Finding it impossible for our horses to pass it
at this spot we struck south, over a flat covered with high grass and herbage
and full of clear water-holes, in order to pass round this boggy creek, which
we accomplished in a circuitous route of 3 miles. Continuing to the angle of a
wood or line of gum trees, we stopped for the day, having travelled 14 miles.
The plains are very heavy and boggy, and not so bare as we have observed them
in other parts, but afford few new plants, the majority being duplicates of
what we have already seen. The following plants, however, appear
new:--<i>Gnaphalium sp.</i>, allied to <i>G. apiculatum</i>. <i>Dalea sp.</i>,
with terminal blue flowers. <i>Helichrysum polygalifolium</i>, nova sp.
<i>Aster sp.</i>, 4 flowers, rays many, white. I observed the remains of a
plant of an <i>Orobanche</i> in capsule (the whole of the root was dead),
sparingly on the flats, in the waterholes of which <i>Polamogeton natans</i>
and <i>Polygonum junceum</i> [= <i>Muehlenbeckia Cunninghami</i>] abound. Mr.
Oxley, who had rode on before us, descried a pair of emus, male and female,
with several young ones. Our dogs gave chase and, after a good run, secured the
male, and our people ran down 6 of their young, which made us an excellent
dinner. At the southern extremity of the plains a body of water was standing,
of considerable length and about a quarter of a mile wide. We were all of us
more or less seized with dysenteric affections, the natural consequence of
living among swamps.</p>
<blockquote>[* Rose-breasted cockatoos (Galahs): ---The Galah comes in from
sunrise for about two hours, same in the evening for about two hours of
sunset...they fly right into water, settle round...and drink and then break up
into flocks and fly away to feeding or roosting grounds. "--Campbell's "Nests
and Eggs of Australian Birds."]</blockquote>
<p><i>5th. Saturday.</i> Our two men who were employed as huntsmen were sent
forward in search of game for us. Resolving to make the river this afternoon if
possible, we departed from our encampment in a westerly direction for about
7&frac12; miles, stretching from point to point of the woods formed by the
northerly bights or bends of the river. Making for a point which we found to be
the river, having a current scarcely perceptible, its banks very low, not
exceeding 8 feet and appearing very shallow. Tracing its left bank down to a
dry spot, we halted and pitched our tent. Our journey is about 10 miles. About
200 yards below us two islands are formed in the channel of the river, which
are covered with the <i>Eucalyptus</i> called the Blue Gum and <i>Acacia
stenophylla</i>. We could clearly distinguish through the spaces between the
trees plains of great extent on the opposite side of the river. The plains are
again naked in many places and the soil dry and hard. A <i>Lavatera</i>, much
allied to <i>L. arborea</i>, afforded me duplicate seeds. <i>Clitoria sp.</i>,
and another, leaflets elongated, blunt and silky, with a spike of flowers.
<i>Sida sp.</i>, a low depressed shrub, and <i>Galium sp.</i> At 2 miles on our
day's journey we crossed the parallel of latitude of Port Jackson southerly. In
order to make the most of the dry provisions we now have in casks we were
obliged to reduce the ration, particularly the flour, to 2 quarts or 3 lbs. per
week per man, in order to enable us to return home to Bathurst which we
calculated upon reaching the last day of August. We had, as before stated,
suffered a very severe loss in our flour, and our people all saw the necessity
of this reduction. Mr. Oxley likewise stated to them that in all human
probability (there was a moral certainty of it) we should be relieved from this
privation in two or three weeks--from the time we turn our faces eastward--by
arriving at a more hilly country, which would afford us game of all kinds, and
that should we continue on the river banks we should find a resource in the
fish, which are large and abundant in the deeper waters.</p>
<p><i>6th. Sunday.</i> Considering the small quantity of provisions we are now
in possession of, the great distance we are from any resource, being about 350
or 370 miles south-westerly of Bathurst, and the rivulet still continuing to
run westerly although very slow, Mr. Oxley has resolved to halt at this spot
the whole of this week, during which period our horses would recruit their
strength, and their backs, which are much galled, should be attended to in
order to heal them. And considering he would act up more fully to the spirit
and tenor of the instructions he has received to continue the journey westward
on horseback. Naturally concluding that the river would terminate and totally
cease to run, being spent in low lands in the course of a distance of 70 miles
westerly (which he calculating upon advancing in 3 days), or that it ended in
an open lake, he was the more desirous of continuing his route westerly for 3
days if possible, because that distance would enable him to cross the parallel
of latitude and the meridian of longitude of a part of the country the coast of
which has been but very imperfectly surveyed, and hence has given rise to the
possibility of the embouchure of a river or rivers there. Mr. Oxley therefore
prepared himself to leave us for a week, taking with him two of the party, with
bedding and provisions for that period, intending to leave us to-morrow
morning. A serviceable packhorse which had been badly strained in the loins was
reported to us to have died in the course of the last night, reducing our
number to 11, this being the third horse that has died in the course of the
expedition, and from singular causes.</p>
<p><i>7th. Monday.</i> This morning Mr. Oxley left our encampment on his
journey westerly, accompanied by Fraser, Burns and Simpson, with provisions for
six days, and trusting they will be able to clear 25 miles per day for three
days, at the end of which, should the stream still continue to run westerly,
they hope to reach some hills or rising grounds from which they could make
observations as to the nature of the country S.W. and N.W. of them. In their
absence our people will be employed in mending the pack-harness, attending to
our sick horses and preparing for our return home early next week. Economy and
necessity had taught us to turn every accident to some account. The flesh of
our deceased horse afforded our faithful but famishing dogs some tolerable
meals, and the skin furnished our people with materials for mocassins or shoes,
which they divided equally with mathematical niceness. I employed myself in
repapering and drying my specimens. I likewise overhauled that description of
baggage which belonged to me, rendering more compact and repairing my
saddlebags, which had suffered much by friction through a difficult
country.</p>
<p>About 2 o'clock in the afternoon, Mr. Oxley and those that accompanied him
returned to our encampment, having advanced about 9 miles on the immediate bank
of the rivulet until they were obliged to desist from proceeding further, the
horses being bogged up to their girths, endangering the lives of their riders
and themselves.[*] About 4 miles from our tent they observed two arms or
branches running from the rivulet in a northerly direction. Onward the current
is scarcely perceptible, and the water is muddy and discoloured. At the
termination of their journey the banks do not exceed 3&frac12; feet in height,
its channel very narrow and choked up by miserable Blue Gums growing in it with
<i>Arundo phragmites</i>, when its current ceases and the water is stagnant. On
the small shrubs of <i>Eucalyptus</i>, which are remarkably strong and mossy,
indicative of the perpetual humidity, the highest water marks do not exceed
4&frac12; feet. The only plants observed at this "Ne plus ultra" of our
expedition are the Blue Gums, <i>Acacia stenophylla</i>, <i>Polygonum
junceum</i> [= <i>Muehlenbeckia Cunninghami</i>], and a long reed grass all on
the muddy banks or in its channel. Its extreme termination was probably not
above 10 miles farther on[**]--19 miles from our tent--which Mr. Oxley doubts
not he would have verified had it been possible for him to have continued on
the banks, which being the highest part was the best travelling. We proposed to
continue at our present encampment until Thursday morning, and then commence
our route easterly home. Our people shot several of the new pigeons.</p>
<blockquote>[* The above will show that Oxley's farthest West was nine miles
beyond his encampment. Mitchell, whilst exploring the Lachlan, came there on
May 5, 1832, and surmised that this part was under water at the time of Oxley's
visit. He saw a tree there marked on each side which the natives informed him
had been "marked by Oxley at the farthest place he reached."]</blockquote>
<blockquote>[** The Lachlan after passing through the marsh joins the
Murrumbidgee in 34&frac12;&deg; S. and 143&frac12;&deg; E., the latter river,
then turning on a south-westerly course unites with the Murray and falls into
the sea in 35&frac12;&deg; S. and 139&deg; E.]</blockquote>
<p><i>8th. Tuesday.</i> By way of experiment and as a proof of the immense
expanse of clear flat country, Mr. Oxley took his amplitude of the sun at its
rising, an observation that has never been taken before in the interior of
Western Australia, and it may be the first observed in any country, for want of
an horizon, which is this morning very clear and cloudless. By further
observations taken this day the site of our present encampment is as follows.
Mean altitude 33&deg;53'19" S., computed longitude 145&deg;07'15" E., or the
same free from errors of chart 144&deg;39'30" E., mean var. of compass
7&deg;25' E. The place where the stream ceased to have motion is in lat.
33&deg;57'30" S., computed long. 144&deg;59'0" E., and freed from errors of
chart 144&deg;31'15" E., the hill, an eminence in a S.W. direction, terminating
in lat. 34&deg;22'12" S. and long. 144&deg; E., that being the calculated
extent of our visible clear horizon. I gathered some seeds of a plant with
globular heads of flowers and agreeing with <i>Richea</i> in the number of its
plumose pappi. I dug up some fine roots of a species of Anthericum before
observed, which is very abundant with the <i>Pancratium Macquaria</i> [=
<i>Calostemma purpureum</i>]. I sowed several peach stones and quince seeds
near this last south-westerly encampment.</p>
<p>We wrote a paper stating the latitude and longitude of the spot, the object
of the expedition, with names of those who comprised it, and observed that it
was our intention to return to Bathurst in a northern circuitous route, in
hopes of intersecting the Macquarie River. This paper was carefully enveloped
in a sheet of brown paper, put into a dry wine bottle, corked, sealed over, and
its neck covered strongly with leather, intending in the morning to bury it
beneath a species of <i>Eucalyptus bicolor</i> near our tent.</p>
<p><i>9th. Wednesday.</i> We buried the bottle, which we had closed the last
evening, beneath the shade of a moderate sized <i>Eucalyptus</i>, engraving on
the solid timber "DIG UNDER," information that could not well be expressed by
less letters.[*] The whole of us left this spot this morning in good spirits
and intend to retrace our footsteps to the place where we discovered the river
on the 23rd ultimo. At 2 o'clock we arrived at our last stage, where we stopped
for the night. I gathered a few specimens:-another species of <i>Sowerbaea</i>,
or a variety of the species discovered on Strangford's Plains. The petals are
generally sulphur-coloured with purple stripes. <i>Lotus sp.</i>, a slender
herbaceous plant. <i>Helichrysum</i>, a new sp., with terminal white solitary
flowers. Also specimen of a shrub with linear leaves; the whole plant is
woolly, different from others of the same habit, discovered on these plains.
Also a <i>Callitris</i> and some grasses. I observed a species of
<i>Plantago</i>, scarcely differing from the species found on the flats.</p>
<blockquote>[* The natives led Major Mitchell to the spot where Oxley's tent
had stood. He saw there the stump of a tree that had been recently burned down,
which the natives said had had marks upon it. Mitchell dug under it for the
bottle without success, and he learned from a native tribe that after the tree
had been fired a child had found the bottle and broken it. It had contained a
letter they said, and "this news" be observes "saved us further
search."]</blockquote>
<p><i>10th. Thursday</i>. It was late before we could leave our encampment, a
delay occasioned by our horses having strayed away some miles back S.W. in the
course of the night. About 3 o'clock we arrived at our resting place of the
third inst. Having pursued a more direct course we made it in 12 miles, which
was 14 on the 4th. I gathered the following specimens: <i>Gnaphalium sp.</i>,
musk scented when fresh. <i>Anacyclus sp.</i>, leaves bipinnate and linear;
scape elongated, one flowered. <i>Gnaphalium sp.</i>, a delicate diminutive
plant, accompanying <i>Siloxerus humifusus</i>, a dwarf plant discovered by
Labillardi&egrave;re on the south coast, which is abundant with a species of
<i>Gymnostyles</i>, a plant of the same class and pigmy growth. A raised mound
of earth which we passed on the plains, we suspect to be an Aboriginean grave,
near which grew a dwarf shrubby species of <i>Solanum</i>, with narrow
lanceolate leaves. Large flocks of new birds, some of which we have shot and
find to be a species of cockatoo, and the pigeons passed over us in their
diurnal northern and southern flights.</p>
<p><i>11th. Friday.</i> Continuing our journey easterly we travelled over the
plain passed on the 3rd inst., and although we did not return upon our old
tracks,--launching out upon the open plain,--the soil is equally heavy
travelling. We continued our march 3&frac14; miles up the river, rather than
halt upon the low swampy spot where we stopped on the 2nd inst. The river
presented to us an appearance that we little expected to see. It had received a
sudden fresh from the eastward; the current ran about 1&frac12; knots, and the
waters are far beyond their usual channel, being within 4&frac34; feet of the
highest part of the flats. It however decreased &frac12; an inch in the course
Of 4 hours. The old marks of inundations were 7&frac12; to 8 feet above their
present level, which had rendered these extensive plains a sheet of water
upwards of 2 feet deep. The <i>Satureia</i>, of which our people made tea,
grows luxuriantly here. I gathered seeds of it. It assumes a woody habit and
rises to the height of 6 ft. We shot some of the new cockatoos to-day, but
found their flesh hard and rancid. A small mound of earth having been found
near our tents of the same character as others that we have supposed to be
natives' graves, I accompanied Mr. Oxley and Mr. Evans to it. It was 3 ft.
high, of conical shape, and of ancient appearance. We dug into it with an adze
and found the remains of bones, and several rough pieces of bark placed across
each other and apparently with some order and regularity but very much
decayed.</p>
<p>N.B. I must here mention a singular mark of affection in a brute which will
tend to prove the paucity of animals inhabiting these inhospitable plains. Our
kangaroo dogs had been suffered wantonly to destroy one of a native species on
these flats in our journey westerly. His carcase we fixed up in the fork of a
small low tree. The female, his mate, had doubtless taken a range in search of
him, when, having found his dead body, she drew it down from the branch and
coiling herself round his lifeless remains seemed determined there to die! On
our return this, day we passed the spot and found her in an emaciated state,
pining from grief and hunger, and in that debilitated low condition as not to
be able to make the slightest resistance or attempt to escape.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER VIII</h3>
<h4>CUNNINGHAM'S JOURNAL</h4>
<h4>OXLEY'S LAND JOURNEY COMPLETED</h4>
<p><i>Returns Eastward, leaves the Lachlan and discovers Wellington, July
12--August 21, 1817</i></p>
<p><i>July 12th. Saturday.</i> We left the bank of the river about 9 o'clock,
travelling over the plains about 7 miles without a single botanical novelty to
relieve the scenery around us. Passing a low tract, covered with bushes of
<i>Polygonum junceum</i> [= <i>Muehlenbeckia Cunninghami</i>], and continuing
our journey about 3 miles over a stiff part of the plains we came upon the
river and pitched our tent in a narrow peninsula formed by it and a lagoon
connected with it. Our day's journey is about 12&frac14; miles, or about 1 mile
to the eastward of our resting place on the 30th ultimo. Our horses were much
fatigued by the heaviness of the soil during this day's route. A very strong
effluvia assailed us from the river, occasioned by the flood having disturbed
and carried down the vegetable matter resting on its muddy banks. So accustomed
are we to a continuance of the same objects before us and so little to any
diversity of country that the sight of Macquarie Range, although distant many
miles, being very blue and hazy, caused a considerable degree of animation in
us while toiling over the loose sandy plains to-day.</p>
<p><i>13th. Sunday.</i> Rested ourselves at the peninsula all this day. I aired
the whole of my specimens and packed them up in an empty flour cask. The water
of the river has fallen almost a foot since last night.</p>
<p><i>14th. Monday.</i> The river fell upwards of 9 inches in the course of
last night. Our horses had strayed in the night and were not taken when I left
the encampment. Mr. Evans had already started (with his assistant wheeling the
perambulator), and I commenced tracing their steps at an easy pace over the
plains. Crossing the eastern boundary of Molle's Plains, I continued for the
space of 8 miles over Harrington's until I arrived at the resting place of the
29th ultimo. Here I stopped, in expectation of being overtaken by our baggage
horses in the course of the day. Mr. Evans and Parr, who had advanced 2 miles
to the eastward of this spot, returned to me about 2 o'clock. The plains abound
with emu. I observed five large fine birds, and Mr. Evans saw seven feeding on
the flats near the river. Finding that the horses did not make their appearance
and not caring to return to the encampment, 9 miles westerly of us, we
determined to bivouac, and collected wood, making up a large fire for the
night, which relieved us from the action of the frosty air, for we had no
bedding or provision.</p>
<p><i>15th. Tuesday.</i> In full expectation that the horses with our party
would proceed forward to us we remained at our last night's fires till 11
o'clock, when, suspecting some accident had happened, we determined to return
to the encampment. We, however, met our people and horses 2 miles distant. It
appears the horses had strayed away about 10 miles over the plains in a
southerly direction and were not secured until late last night. We passed our
fires about 3 miles to the eastward and halted on the immediate bank of the
river, the late flood of which had fallen about 3 feet. Our dogs caught one of
the emus seen yesterday.</p>
<p><i>16th. Wednesday.</i> From the banks of the river we travelled over the
sandy plains, tracing our old footsteps through a very sterile scrub and low
grassy land to our halting place of the 28th ultimo, being 8&frac14; miles from
the bank we left this morning. It being early in the day we continued our route
about 3 miles further round the lagoon and stopped for the night in a tolerable
dry and (dead) wooded spot near the angle of the lagoon, which abounds with
vast bodies of wild duck and other waterfowl. I gathered specimens of
<i>Loranthus angustifolius</i>, parasitical on the snake-bark, and a little
trifling <i>Arabis</i>. Of a flock of emu, about 20 in number, our dogs secured
for us two fine birds, which were distributed among the people and
ourselves.</p>
<p><i>17th. Thursday.</i> At a late hour we left our resting place at the swamp
and advanced on our journey, over small open plains and scrubby tracts
alternately, for upwards Of 4&frac12; miles, when we turned out of the old
beaten path, which we had traced, in order to make as direct and straight a
path as possible to the margin of Smith's Plains. An <i>Acacia</i> allied to
<i>A. suaveolens</i> decorates these dreary wastes with its great profusion of
golden flowers, and the new genus of the <i>Bignoniaceae</i> having a
persistent calyx. A shrub with succulent short leaves, and much the habit of
<i>Bursaria spinosa</i>, is frequent here as in other situations, not in flower
or fruit. Continuing our route about 5 miles over a country grey with <i>Acacia
pendula</i>, and not caring to pursue our journey through a thick brush on the
confines of which we had arrived and in which we might fare worse in point of
herbage and grass for our horses, we turned in towards the river and halted at
a recent native encampment on the margin of a small lagoon. The soil in this
day's route is red and sandy, and very heavy with the rain of last night.</p>
<p><i>18th. Friday.</i> In hopes of making a good day's journey to our resting
place of the 24th ultimo, we left the lagoon at an early hour. Tracing our path
through a very considerable brush, at the extremity of which Cape Porteous bore
northeasterly about 8&frac12; miles, we passed an open flat of some extent and
entered a brush of small <i>Callitris</i> and dwarf <i>Eucalyptus</i>, with
some low scrub, in which a new <i>Bossiaea</i> abounds. At 12&frac12; miles we
arrived under the north-west side of Macquarie Range, where I collected the
following interesting duplicate specimens, which are much finer and more
luxuriant than I have observed previously. <i>Indigofera sp.</i>, <i>Dodonaea
cuneata</i>. <i>D. heterophylla</i>, <i>Cassia glauca</i>. Under Cape Porteous
I gathered <i>Anthocercis albicans</i> in young fruit, and duplicate specimens
of <i>Senecio anethifolius</i>. Upon examining some shrubs of <i>Correa
speciosa</i> I discovered a capsule with ripe seeds. <i>Callitris verrucosa</i>
of the Euryalean Scrub, a trailing twiggy <i>Solanum</i>, and a small slender
<i>Sida</i> are plants by no means rare under this range. In the flats near the
mount I discovered a new <i>Amaryllis</i> whose bulbs were very near the
surface of the earth. I likewise found a few more of the larger rooted
<i>Amaryllis</i> discovered by me on the 24th ultimo. Pursuing our journey
about 3 miles, we arrived at an old encampment about 4 o'clock and halted our
horses; having travelled the 15&frac12; miles with more than ordinary ease. We
could distinctly hear some natives on the opposite side of the river, but they
did not make their appearance. These woods near the river are full of the
little Sowerbaea in damp situations.</p>
<p><i>19th. Saturday.</i> Our stage to the spot where we made the river on the
23rd ultimo being about 11 miles, we started about 9 o'clock in hopes of
reaching that bend of the river early in the afternoon. Clearing the wood we
travelled over Strangford's Plains on a course running nearly parallel with
Macquarie's Range--about 6 miles. The <i>Pancratium Macquaria</i> [=
<i>Calostemma purpureum</i>] and <i>Sowerbaea</i> are scattered on the flats,
with a small yellow <i>Hypoxis</i>.[*] I gathered seeds of the pendulous
<i>Eucalyptus</i> (allied to <i>E. paniculata</i>), as well as a few seeds of
<i>E. bicolor</i>. Taking a route more northerly for the last 5 miles we
arrived at our old resting place in good time. The flood from the eastward,
which we had observed down this river, had filled the creek by which the large
lagoon is supplied from the stream. From very recent marks of natives on the
trees, and the removal of a quantity of dry grass from the spot on which we
left it, it is evident this place has been visited by natives since we left it
on our journey over the plain. Our dogs killed a very lofty emu.</p>
<p><i>20th. Sunday.</i> We remained quiet the whole of this day in order to
rest our horses. Some of our people who had gone out from us early this morning
in pursuit of game returned to the tent about 2 o'clock this afternoon with a
couple of emu and a red haired kangaroo (<i>macropus</i>), distinct in colour
and size from <i>elegans</i>.</p>
<p><i>21st. Monday.</i> The river rose considerably since last evening,
indicative of much rain having fallen to the eastward. Mr. Oxley intends to
commence his journey up the river for a few days and endeavour to cross its
stream at a favourable and easy place, continuing on the north side in order to
ascertain what this river in reality is, and should it prove to be the Lachlan,
we are at liberty when on the opposite bank to leave it to prevent being
entangled in its swamps, and shall then be able to bear away northerly in
search of the Macquarie, and return on it to Bathurst. This is our present plan
of advancement, which like all others must be governed by local circumstances,
contingencies which no human eye can foresee. About 9 o'clock we commenced our
new route up the river on the plains, making a small clear mount bearing north
easterly 2 miles from the angle of the wood in which we had encamped. From this
elevation Mr. Evans took bearings of some remarkable elevated spots to the
northward of us. The general appearance of the country before us is plain and
brushy spots alternately with some mounts and ranges as far as the eye can see.
Goulburn's Range bore from the mount north-easterly 1&frac12; miles, which is
contrasted with ranges of hills on the opposite side of the river, We observed
some smoke issuing through the trees on the lower lands, which informed us of
the presence of natives, and, it being in our course, we made up to it. Natives
had been there this morning but were gone; their fires were still burning,
round which many fresh bones of the wallabee[*] or brush kangaroo were
scattered, and the gunya or bark hut had been thrown down. These plains or
flats produce the same plants as Smith Plains.</p>
<blockquote>[* Wallaby.]</blockquote>
<p>Stretching over these small plains at 8 miles we came upon the river, which
is considerably beyond its usual and proper limits, as may be seen by the trees
that the increased flood has placed in the middle of the stream--still
evidently rising. Having passed a short scrub, we stopped and pitched our tent
at a remarkable elbow of the river, being about 11 miles from our last
encampment. The travelling over these plains is heavy, being wet and slimy, and
the woody lands soft and hollow. Our course generally was N.N.E. The river has
occasionally several short windings in a small distance, so as to form parallel
lines with each other.</p>
<p>Our huntsmen came up with a native, his two gins or wives and three small
children. They were extremely shy and by no means friendly, showing symptoms of
suspicion and mistrust towards our people, who tried to persuade them to follow
them to our encampment but to no purpose. The man was represented as of a
strong robust athletic habit, perfectly naked, and armed with a stone hatchet
and a long spear of acacia wood, with which he continually kept our people at a
distance when they attempted to approach the females. The women were of
delicate low stature, wore short mantles of skin round their shoulders, but
were otherwise naked and were from 25 to 30 years of age. They carried some
wooden spoon-shaped instruments in their hands, with which they dig for grubs,
or roots. Our people made free and took one of these spoons which they brought
to our tent. It was this little family that had left the fire in the brush this
morning (which we had made up to), and the man was so exasperated with our
people continuing to follow him that he went back to the bark hut, threw it
down and went off with his family precipitately to the river calling to his
companions.</p>
<p><i>22nd. Tuesday.</i> Fine clear cool morning. We could distinctly hear the
conversation of natives, who appeared to be on the same side of the river on
which we were encamped, but they were not seen. Continuing our route easterly
we desired to reach the base of a mount called Mount Torrens, of which we took
bearings from the clear hill yesterday with a view of making further
observations. We, however, found that the river ran to the southward of it
placing it on the opposite bank and consequently preventing us from approaching
it. At about 4 miles we came to the foot of an elevated hill, which Mr. Oxley
has named Mount Farquhar, in honour of Mr. Walter Farquhar physician to H.R.H.
the Prince Regent, from which several bearings were taken. Mount Torrens bore
about 1&frac12; miles northerly of us. The centre of the three principal
eminences connected together bearing north easterly several miles, has been
termed Mount Davidson, in honour of Walter Davidson Esqre., nephew of the above
gentleman. Mount Farquhar is very bare and sterile, its upper surface being
covered with a species of granite mixed with loose coarse fragments of quartz.
Its summit has some burnt specimens of <i>Casuarina</i> with long fine brittle
leaves and some dwarf <i>Eucalypti</i>. A beautiful white flowered
<i>Aster</i>, frequently observed previously, decorates the slopes of this
mount, and the delicate <i>Tecoma Oxleyi</i> its rocky north side. I observed a
species of <i>Thlaspi</i> differing but little from <i>Thlaspi montanum</i> a
diminutive <i>Eriophorum</i>, a <i>Bossiaea</i>, and an <i>Asclepiad</i> of
volubilous habit on the southern base. I gathered specimens of a <i>Sida
filiformis</i> with a slender procumbent stem. I likewise observed some few
plants of <i>Nictoiana undulata</i>. The country to the northward appears
broken and hilly. Descending this mount we travelled N.E., passing brushy spots
and open slimy tracts of country covered with large bushes of a species of
<i>Rhagodia</i>. I here gathered the following:--seeds of <i>Cotula sp.</i>,
leaves elongated, flowers white; and another species with cuneated dentated
leaves and yellow flowers; a species of <i>Richea</i>, and some grasses.
Entering a clear confined scrub in which I collected specimens of a
<i>Thesium</i>, we halted at 10 miles near the immediate bank of the river in a
damp spot and at a place where there was but little food for the horses.</p>
<p>The soil of the brush is uniformly red, sandy and sterile, and that of the
open plains damp and slimy. The south bank of the river is in many places very
high, and of a red earth, the stream is 30 feet wide and its windings numerous.
The smaller rooted <i>Amaryllis</i> discovered under Cape Porteous we noticed
in clusters near the surface of the soil. The tetrandrous nut-tree is frequent
with <i>Clematis occidentalis</i>, producing abundance of male flowers. Our
hunters, who had lost their way, were wandering in a dense prickly scrub to the
southward of us and did not fall in with our horse-track till late at night,
which alone enabled them to find our encampment. They had killed an emu but
were unable to carry him to the tent, so they left him in a tree till
to-morrow. The flood will prevent us from crossing the river for some days.</p>
<p><i>23rd. Wednesday.</i> We departed from our encampment at an early hour
this morning, cleared the brush and stretched across the plain to some gentle
rising land that ran down to the margin of the river. We here took away the emu
that had been killed last evening from the tree on which the huntsmen had hung
him. The country north-easterly, in which our route lay, is the same as
yesterday, at 7 miles we were obliged to make the river in consequence of a
large lake 3 miles long and about half that space wide, the lower lands in its
vicinity being exceedingly wet and swampy. Changing our course we continued
about 3 miles up the river, but found that a further advancement only entangled
us in bogs and swamps. Crossing some rocky hills, we stayed and pitched our
tent near to an arm running southerly from the river to the above lake, which
is supplied by it.</p>
<p>On the late swampy lands for the space of 3 miles were <i>Polygonum
junceum</i> [= <i>Muehlerbeckia Cunninghami</i>] and other plants usually found
in such situations. The open flats abound with the large <i>Rhagodia</i>, the
young leaves of which we found an excellent substitute for cabbage. On the
rocky hills near our tent I observed a species of <i>Psychotria</i> in fruit,
but, being subject to insects or disease, furnished no good seeds; a simple
leaved <i>Acacia</i>, with terminal panicles of flowers, frequent on Bathurst
Plains, is likewise common on the elevated spots. A mount called Mount Byng
bore easterly 20 miles. The stream has been running generally from the
southward to-day, and the flood increases. The present singular surface of the
plains is within 5 feet of the highest flood mark on the Blue Gums on its
banks, some of which are standing in the present mid channel. Our journey was
11&frac12; miles. The snake-bark is now large and frequent, taking the place of
<i>Sterculia heterophylla</i>, which has not appeared for some time. Our dogs
killed 3 emu on the flats near the river.</p>
<p><i>24th. Thursday.</i> We ascertained by a mark that the river had fallen
about one inch in the course of the last night. In consequence of the
difficulty of continuing our journey on the left bank, Mr. Oxley has resolved
to remain at our present station and endeavour to form a bridge of trees,
enabling us to convey our provisions, luggage and selves across to the right
bank, there being little or no doubt of its being the Lachlan River or its
outlet from the swamps, which prevented us from proceeding further on the
course we were pursuing on the 12th May last. The men were therefore employed
in felling such large gum trees as would reach over to the opposite bank,
which, however, we found labour in vain. The water is too deep and the current
so rapid and strong as to carry away the trees which we had fallen over it
without the least difficulty. Upon tracing its banks down with a view of
examining the same in order to find an eligible place to construct a bridge we
discovered another arm 40 ft. wide running N. of West from the river, which we
did not observe yesterday. Not finding any fair spot either favoured with lofty
trees and narrow channel or otherwise, Mr. Oxley sent the men to the southern
arm but it appears their attempts failed in the formation of a bridge, there
being no trees sufficiently large to fall for that purpose, or where there were
any of the ordinary size, the channel was so deep as to form no lodgment as a
rest or stay for the branches, the current not allowing them to remain
stationary.</p>
<p><i>25th. Friday.</i> Having no resource left (being entirely blocked by the
river and its dependencies) but to try another part of the southern arm, our
people with much labour and perseverance threw a bridge over it in a shallow
part sufficiently strong to bear the weight of ourselves and luggage. The river
has fallen 3&frac12; inches since last night, and in 4 hours it dropped
1&frac12; inches. Burns, who had visited with his dogs the elevated grounds,
brought us a fine large emu which they had selected from a large flock. He
reported that about 2 miles south from us he came to the shores of an extensive
lake, forming a very large sheet of water encircled by a sandy beach. Mr. Oxley
visited this water in the afternoon. The plants on the flats near the southern
arm vary not in the smallest degree from those common on the Lachlan River. By
observation taken this day our lat. is 33&deg;13'28" S., and long.
146&deg;40'20" E.</p>
<p><i>26th. Saturday.</i> Morning fair. Taking an early breakfast and
accompanied by Mr. Evans, Fraser and Parr, I visited the lake which had been
discovered yesterday, and being only 2 miles southerly we were soon presented
with a view of this truly magnificent body of water. Its breadth is about 3
miles, and its length probably exceeds 7 miles; it is bounded by fine large
sandy shores; the north side is bold and rocky. It is skirted by Blue Gum and
Cypress; its surface is covered with large bodies of pelicans, wild duck, teal,
divers etc., and to add to the general beauty of the scene Goulburn's lofty
range and Peel's range appear at a distance in the background. We proceeded
round the beach easterly in order to obtain a good and favourable view of this
lake, of which sketches were taken. On the bare open rising grounds above the
lake, I observed some small specimens of <i>Sterculia heterophylla</i>, a
blue-flowered <i>Clitoria</i>, and some common <i>Gnaphalia</i>. This lake has
been called the Prince Regent's Lake.[*] A beautiful reclining strong growing
herbaceous plant, of the <i>Diadelphous Leguminasae</i>, I discovered on these
sterile flats, and which proves to be a new <i>Kennedya</i>. The flowers have
much the shape and colour of <i>Kennedya rubicunda</i>, but are twice the size.
The plant is perennial. I likewise discovered on the sands of the lake a
species of <i>Polygonum</i> with dioecious flowers, forming a shrub one foot
high. I also furnished myself with female flowers of the new <i>Clematis</i>:
the large yellow-flowered Goodenia is likewise common. Mount Aiton could be
seen from a particular point of view, and we now estimate Mount Granard to be
72 miles north-westerly of that elevation. It was 2 o'clock in the afternoon
before we returned to our encampment, which was broken up and all the luggage
conveyed over the southern arm by the bridge; our horses swam forward, tracing
the river up its banks, and there was nothing left for us but to follow their
tracks with all possible despatch. The country appears to rise, although it has
signs of having been inundated. It is alternately woody with high coarse grass
and plains, on which the white flowered stoloniferous <i>Chrysanthemum</i> is
most predominant. About 4&frac12; miles on our line of route we passed another
extensive sheet of water about the same width as the Prince Regent's Lake, but
clear of timber, and so full of water as to be up to the highest mossy water
mark. It appeared to wind to the southward and eastward and in all probability
is of considerable depth. Continuing on our horse-tracks about 3 miles we
rounded a lagoon of remarkable fine clear water and arrived at our tent in a
bend of the river at dusk. Our people discovered a large native bark canoe,
which Mr. Oxley intends to make use of in the conveyance of our provisions over
the river, there being a great doubt whether we shall be able to construct a
bridge so long as the flood continues. Our journey was about 8 miles from our
bridge over the southern arm, generally north-easterly.</p>
<blockquote>[* Lake Cargellico.]</blockquote>
<p><i>27th. Sunday.</i> The land on the opposite side of the river appearing
high and rising, and hence would afford us better travelling, induced Mr. Oxley
to make the attempt to ferry over our luggage in the bark canoe. It was,
however, too hazardous an experiment to be carried into effect, for the canoe
would not carry two of our men. We had lost two days of the last week in
consequence of detention at the southern arm and therefore considered ourselves
by no means justified to halt this day, especially as the whole of our
provisions in hand would not at the present ration last longer than 7 weeks. It
was late before we continued our journey, which was about 5 miles, and
descending to some grassy swamps we changed our course to the east and
continued half a mile on the margin of a thick scrub bounded by bog. Resuming
our course of N.E. we passed some land that had been fired by natives, and
stretching over a plain came to an angle of a large serpentine lagoon of
remarkably clear water, down which we continued 1 mile and a half to the river
where we pitched our tent having travelled 9&frac34; miles. I discovered a new
species of <i>Stenochilus</i>, with ovate-lanceolate leaves and axillary
peduncles, scarcely longer than the leaves. It has the largest drupes of all I
have seen. The flowers are scarlet and spotted inside. A small <i>Phleum</i>,
and the pygmy plants called <i>Siloxerus humifusus</i>, and a <i>Plantago</i>
with lanceolate, entire-nerved leaves, are frequent on the wet flats. Fraser,
who had gone down to the river, had noticed several natives cutting bark from
the gum trees for their huts. They were forming an encampment on the opposite
side of the river, and desisted for the moment when they perceived him, but
upon his continuing his journey resumed their labours on the trees. There were
6 men, 2 women, and 2 boys.</p>
<p><i>28th. Monday.</i> Sharp frost last night. About 9 o'clock we continued
our route easterly, in order to clear a small creek running from the river. We
came out upon a low swampy grassy flat bounded by serpentine lagoons
communicating with the river to the northward of it. Unable to ascertain our
distance from the river we penetrated the brush in order to make the banks, but
its stream had bent in westerly so that in the attempt our men and horses
became involved in deep narrow bights of lagoons, some of which formed
serpentine windings round the N.E. margin of the small plains; at this critical
moment we got dispersed into different parties.</p>
<p>Having travelled about 11 miles on various courses, generally
north-easterly, myself, two men and four horses came to an angle of the river
where we halted, in the hopes that the other part of our company would follow
our footsteps and meet us at this point. The country assumes the same gloomy
appearance as it has for some time past. The plains are, however, firm and
hard, and the river does not appear to fall; its stream in many places is very
wide, at this angle 50 feet, and running about two knots per hour. From the
plains some hills bore northerly. It was sunset and not one of the party
appearing, we unloaded the horses and encamped for the night round a large
fire. We fired a musket to inform our people-who I concluded were not far from
us-of our situation, and we were answered by Mr. Oxley's party.</p>
<p><i>29th. Tuesday.</i> In consequence of the deep bights of the river
yesterday, and not being able to track Mr. Evans, we were separated during the
night. Mr. Oxley with all the horses (except four which were with me) was
encamped 2 miles behind me, when Mr. Evans, who had made good 13 miles on a
N.E. course, had passed the night with five of the party in a brush about 2
miles to the eastward of my resting place, but without any provisions. I
despatched one of the people back to Mr. Oxley to inform him of my situation as
well as that of Mr. Evans, which I learnt from Fraser, one of his party, who
came back to me for some provisions. It was about 11 o'clock before we all
collected in a body at Mr. Evans's encampment. We proceeded forward in a
direction governed by the inclination of the river, which was about S.E. by E.,
for the space Of 7 miles before we stopped for the day. On the damp plains I
furnished myself with specimens of <i>Siloxerus humifusus</i>; <i>Plantago
sp.</i>, a small delicate plant; and another species, stemless, with leaves
oblong, and petioled, a diminutive plant of a species of Goodenia; and an
<i>Anacyclus</i>, a small plant with blue flowers.</p>
<p>On the south side of the flats there is a range of hills running east and
west, from which Mr. Oxley took several bearings of points named and seen from
Mount Cunningham. We came to the conclusion that the river having run so far
from the westward and north-westerly would turn out to be the Macquarie but our
ideas are found to be chimerical; the observations of Mr. Oxley tending to
clear up any doubts existing respecting its being other than the Lachlan's
outlets from the swamps. Mr. Oxley's bearings agreed exactly with the mounts
and hills laid down in the charts in May last previous to the abandonment of
the boats.</p>

<h4>GRAVE OF THE LACHLAN NATIVE SEEN BY OXLEY</h4>
</center>
<p>Near our encampment a native grave of modern construction, from the regular
manner and systematical mode in which everything connected with it is disposed,
led us to conclude that this mausoleum[*] contained the remains of some person
of eminence, either a chief or one who had acquired from his skill in hunting,
the respect and awe of his countrymen. It is a mound of earth about 3 feet
above the level of the ground and is bounded on one side by three rows of seats
forming the segment of a circle and of the following dimensions. The inside
tier 40 ft. long, the centre 45 feet and the outer one 50 feet. Each tier is
4&frac12; feet apart and about one foot high. On the opposite side of the grave
is a single tree less than any of the others, and on the north and south side
of the grave are openings to it.</p>
<blockquote>[* The site of this grave of an aboriginal king is now marked by a
stone cairn by the New South Wales Government.]</blockquote>
<p>About 6 feet to the west of this mausoleum stood a cypress on which was cut
out with very considerable labour remarkable characters, the stem having been
previously barked and about 30 feet north west was another having some singular
figures deeply cut on its stem--perhaps a description of the man, his age, and
cause of death. The banks of the river vary in height, from 5 to 16 feet,
clothed as usual with <i>Acacia stenophylla</i> and a few <i>Casuarinae</i>.
The Cypress and Blue Gum are more abundant than they were.</p>
<p><i>30th. Wednesday.</i> Mr. Oxley having satisfied himself that this river
is the Lachlan and that it would answer no purpose to advance further on its
banks (having already arrived near the confines of the large swamps) has
resolved to try the experiment of falling trees over the stream to form a
bridge, or construct a raft that would convey our luggage and provisions over
the river in a safe and dry condition. The boat-builder with some of the people
were accordingly employed to fall the timber and form a raft with all possible
despatch. Repapered my green specimens that had been collected some days. Rain
without intermission in showers all the forenoon.</p>
<p>As Mr. Oxley is instructed to collect all the information possible
respecting the government, customs and habits of the aborigines of the country
over which we might pass--points on account of the sparse thin population of
Western Australia, with which we had no opportunity to furnish ourselves--he
intends to open the grave in order to ascertain its internal appearance.
Removing the whole of the mound, we found it vaulted with pieces of wood and
layers of bark and came to the body about 3&frac12; feet below the surface of
the ground, compressed in a grave 2 feet by 4, formed in long ovate figure
sufficient to contain that part of a person from head to hip--the legs and feet
having been forced over the shoulders. The body was placed on its right side,
and the face looking towards the East or rising sun. His head was ornamented
with the usual netting, and his opossum hatchet-girdle was placed behind him.
From the size of his bones he appears to have been a man of 6 feet, and might
have been 40 years of age, and apparently had not been dead six months. Our
people took up his skull, which had the hair very fresh upon it. It's upper jaw
wanted one of the front teeth, which loss may be occasioned by the same custom
prevailing here as is adopted on the Eastern coast. The skull Mr. Oxley intends
to take with us, as a subject for study by craniologists.</p>
<p><i>31st. Thursday.</i> Fine and clear. Our people are employed sawing pine
or cypress for the raft, which being a heavy job will scarcely be finished this
day. Took a walk on the neighbouring hills. The following are the whole of the
plants that came within my observation. <i>Helichrysum bicolor</i>, scales of
calyx tinged with a red colour and the leaves terminated in a naked mucrone.
<i>Gnaphalium fragrans</i>, scented like the Touquin Bean. <i>Brunonia
australis</i> is very common on the hills, at the base of which I gathered
seeds of <i>Dodonaea pinnata</i>. One of the <i>Gentianaceae</i>, frequently
observed, has a variety here with white flowers; and some few shrubs producing
orange capsules, likewise abundant. From the summit of the most elevated bill
of the range (bearing three quarters of a mile south of our tent), which has
been called Piper's Hill, in honour of our naval officer of Port Jackson
Harbour, Captain Piper, we had an extensive panoramic view of the country
around us for about 40 miles. Among the numerous observations and bearings
taken by Mr. Oxley, I'll only note the following. A mount bearing N.W. about 45
or 50 miles distant has been named Mount Bauer, in honour of Francis and
Ferdinand Bauer, Esqres., particularly of the latter gentleman whose
indefatigable labours in the illustration of Australian Botany merit a much
higher honour than a distant mount that may never be seen by European eyes
again, and doubtless will never be visited by any. The country between us and
the Mounts bearing southward and eastward appear flat and wooded in some
places, and it is probable that the Macquarie may not run far north of us, and
we are in hopes of intersecting it in about 12 days on a N.E. course, steering
for Hurd's Peak [Mt. Tolga]. I observed some western iron bark, <i>Eucalyptus
sideroxylon</i>, on the south side of the hills, miserably small and stunted.
During our stay in this encampment we made some excellent meals of the large
<i>Rhagodia</i>, which is an excellent substitute for spinach. The river falls
rapidly.</p>
<p><i>1817. August 1st. Friday.</i> The river has decreased about 14 inches in
the course of the night. Our boat builder finished the raft and we launched
her. We intended to convey the whole of our baggage over to the north bank of
the river this afternoon, but we failed in the attempt. We had fixed a line
across the stream, which is not less than 50 feet wide, making it fast to the
Blue Gums on each bank to act as a warp by which the raft might be drawn
backwards and forwards. We however, found it altogether impracticable, The man
on the raft, in the act of pulling himself over, found the midchannel current
so strong as to oblige him to quit his hold of the line, and the raft becoming
unmanageable, was carried with the man nearly three quarters of a mile down the
stream before we could send some of our people to assist to stop her. They
found it difficult to tow her up against the stream, and she was left fast to a
stump. Some trees of sufficient height on its south bank we fixed upon to form
a bridge, and we set our people to work to saw them down, but they could not be
fallen to-day, being thick and sound at their butts. The lat. and long. at this
remarkable spot under Piper's Hill is 33&deg;04'02" S., and supposed long.
146&deg;47'30" E., but by chart 147&deg;05' E.[*]</p>
<blockquote>[* Oxley now decided to leave the Lachlan River, and crossing it on
a raft took a north-easterly course, when be discovered Wellington
Valley.]</blockquote>
<p><i>2nd. Saturday.</i> A steady rain set in early this morning, continuing
without intermission till about 11 o'clock. With considerable labour our people
felled two large trees, but being turned round they were carried lengthwise
down the river by its strong sweeping current, so that it will be in vain to
attempt any of these works so long as the flood continues, which may not be
long, as the river has fallen 13 inclies since the last evening. Our situation,
becoming in some measure alarming, every day lessens our provisions, and we
have not the means of turning what we have to good account by proceeding
forward on our journey homeward.</p>
<p>Mr. Oxley sent two of our people up the river on horseback to search for a
fair spot to make another trial to form a bridge. They, however, returned after
a ride of about 8 miles upon the banks but found no eligible place to make the
experiment. They observed a stream larger than the river running from the N.E.
and forming a junction with it about 3 miles from our tent, which we suspect to
be the north-west arm of the Lachlan River.</p>
<p><i>3rd. Sunday.</i> We have now but one resource left and that is our raft
which our people had towed up the river to an eddy that might be of much use to
us, by drifting diagonally to the opposite bank. Mr. Oxley rode up the south
bank of the river to ascertain the nature of the country to the southward and
eastward, as also to observe the arm that our people had reported to run into
it. In his absence we formed a double towing rope of all the halters lashings
and slings we could muster. Combining them together, we ferried over the whole
of our provisions in casks, and our luggage on the raft to the opposite bank on
the north side of the river, and swam the horses, all which operation was
carried into effect with all possible despatch and without any accident
happening, which we considered a miracle; our raft being waterlogged, and when
laden was several inches under water, independently of the rapid whirls of the
stream against which we had to contend. We encamped on the rising grounds of
the north bank. I sowed some peach stones and quince seeds.</p>
<p>Mr. Oxley returned from his ride and came over the river to us. He intends
to lose no more time but strike away N.E. easterly from the difficult river and
pass near Hurd's Peak in our route homewards. He found the higher lands a few
miles up the southern bank very boggy and bad travelling from the late rains.
Our people were all occupied slinging casks and arranging each horse's load.
Mr. Oxley has determined to proceed on the above course to-morrow morning.</p>
<p><i>August 4th. Monday.</i> We commenced our route N.E. by E. over a tract of
damp slimy country covered with Rhagodia, and plains abounding with Acacia
Pendula and several shrubs heretofore noticed. The land rises gently and
gradually, but assumes no better appearance in soil and timber. At 6 miles the
<i>Acacia homalophylla</i> becomes very common, with <i>A. pendula</i> and
snake-bark and small <i>Cypress</i> forming an extensive lofty brush for
several miles. Passing over some rocky elevated ground, where I gathered some
fine specimens of <i>Acacia doratoxylon</i>, we entered a very confined close
<i>Euryalean</i> scrub composed of <i>Eucalyptus dumosa</i>, and several fine
plants. In this intricate scrub I gathered some new and beautiful plants:-viz:
<i>Pimelea flava</i>, a slender small shrub. <i>Prostanthera</i>, with stem,
flowers axillary solitary and greenish, a low depressed shrub. A species of
<i>Acacia dasyphylla</i> with linear lanceolate pubescent leaves, is frequent,
forming dense bushes. <i>Aster decurrens</i> [= <i>Olearia decurrens</i>] and
<i>A. cuneatus</i> [= <i>Olearia stellulata</i>] and <i>Clematis
occidentalis</i> are likewise very common. Some patches of land that had been
formerly fired by the natives producing some good tufts of grass induced us to
turn out of our course in the scrub and halt upon it. This scrub continues for
some miles with all the sterility imaginable, hence we are extremely fortunate
in having an opportunity of turning out of it to a spot where our horses would
find good grass, and where we found some water in two native wells, added to a
little from the river which we had carried in a keg it was abundantly
sufficient for the whole of us. On the flats I gathered anew <i>Gnaphalium</i>
leaves linear and hooked, flowers crowded and terminal. We had advanced on a
variable route 13&frac14; miles per perambulator but only 12&frac12; on our
true course. The nut trees (tetrandrous shrub) are loaded with fruit, and the
new <i>Jasminum</i> and several species of <i>Dodonaea</i> present themselves
in these lone places. From some rising ground we observed Hurd's Peak bearing
N.E. about 6 miles from us.</p>
<p><i>5th. Tuesday.</i> Sharp frost early. This morning we left our halting
place, continuing our course through the Euryalean scrub about 3 miles, with
little or no variation in the botany. I gathered seeds of the Western Iron Bark
and specimens of a new species of <i>Acacia cardiophylla</i>. The spinous grass
and aculeated <i>Daviesia</i> rendered our advancement through this scrub very
painful. Onward the country for 6 miles is rising and covered with a confined
brush of <i>Acacia homalophylla</i>. The timber is of <i>Eucalyptus
micrantha</i> or Bastard Box, and Cypress. The recent marks of natives digging
for grubs, and remains of fires, led us to conclude that water could not be far
distant. Mr. Evans, who as usual had gone on before the horses, came very
providentially to some small holes of stagnant water surrounded by <i>Polygonum
junceum</i> [= <i>Muehlenbeckia Cunninghami</i>] and, although it partook of
the white colour of the clay on which it rested, it was of very essential
service to us. We watered our horses and took the precaution to fill a keg for
ourselves.</p>
<p>The country for the next mile is elevated and stony, and from the sudden
change that is obvious in timber, being <i>Casuarina</i> of lofty height and
tolerable bulk, we were anticipating a fine forest land, but were disappointed.
Passing a range of large granite stones we entered a thick scrub, which
continued for some miles, but were obliged to halt in it, having travelled
13&frac12; miles and no appearance of water. We sent some of our people 3 miles
in search of water, which they found in small quantities in the holes and
gullies, and of a red tinge, from the ferruginous colour of the stones over
which it had run.</p>
<p>In the bush in which we were encamped I observed the little plant of the
habit of <i>Westringia</i>, first observed on the 1st of June of which I
gathered duplicate seeds. The general and sterility and want of water in the
country, as we advance, obliges us to proceed forward by rapid and longer
marches than we otherwise would, in hopes of intersecting the Macquarie River,
should it run so far from Bathurst. Served out half a pint of water each to the
people.</p>
<p><i>6th. Wednesday.</i> At daybreak sent to the range for water. Continuing
our route on the same course, I accompanied Mr. Oxley and Fraser to the hills
nearest to the Point. Made it in 4&frac12; miles. Mr. Oxley took a few bearings
while I was examining the few plants that grew on its rugged summit.
<i>Indigofera speciosa</i>, <i>Tecoma Oxleyi</i>, <i>Boronia pulchella</i>,
<i>Eriostemon sp.</i>, <i>Senecio sp.</i>, with aspen-like leaves, papillously
rough, with corymbose flowers. <i>Eucalyptus sp.</i> (Blue Gum), <i>Callitris
glauca</i>, and <i>Acacia doratoxylon</i>, very small, compose the whole of its
botany.</p>
<p>The country to the northward is mountainous and broken, but easterly it
appears more flat and level. Crossing the country from the base of the range,
we intersected our horse track in about 3 miles in which we passed creeks, two
of which contained some water where we quenched the great thirst of our horses.
In our route we observed several fine specimens of <i>Sterculia
heterophylla</i>, but not in flower or fruit. Descending from a slight rise we
entered a stony brush (denominated an iron bark scrub), exceedingly close and
confined, in which I discovered a few new plants viz:--<i>Dodonaea
calycina</i>, a slender twiggy shrub remarkable for its large calycinal leaves.
<i>Pultenaea sp.</i>, leaves linear-oblong, which are, with the calyx and
branches, silky. <i>Dillwynia sp.</i>, allied to <i>D. floribunda</i>. All the
plants observed in Peel's Range are likewise here, of which <i>Acacia sp.</i>,
allied to <i>A. decipiens</i>, is very common. The timber of this scrub is
<i>Eucalyptus sideroxylon</i>, an iron bark, cypress and a species of
<i>Eucalyptus</i> with long lanceolate leaves, not in flower.</p>
<p>Having penetrated 3 miles through the brush, we were obliged to halt at
nightfall at a clear spot where there was some coarse grass for our horses,
although no water for them and little for us. Our journey this day is
13&frac12; miles, which we found a very severe stage. Near our encampment our
boat-builder was sent to drain a few small holes of water into one, in order to
secure some for our breakfast in the morning. Our dogs had killed a small
kangaroo, which we distributed with the water in our kegs among the whole of
us. Outside our tent I discovered a new <i>Acacia</i>, with linear-lanceolate
leaves, which are bent by the indenture of a gland on the interior margin,
solitary axillary capitula of flowers, and elongated filaments.</p>
<p><i>7th. Thursday.</i> Served out a ration of drained water much discoloured
by the soil. Leaving our encampment our course led us through a continuance of
the same difficult scrub for the space Of 4&frac14; miles. These gloomy shades
are much beautified by several beautiful acacias, which are now in the greatest
beauty and luxuriance. At the termination of the scrub, the country suddenly
changes to forest grassy land, with a slight brush of <i>Acacia sp.</i>, allied
to <i>A. decurrens</i>, among which I observed <i>Pimelea colorans</i>, a shrub
whose flowers change from white to a deep blue colour. The land continues of
the forest description with slight risings for upwards of 6 miles to a
considerable tract of burnt grass, where was good pasturage for our horses. The
change of stone from a quartz to a red variegated granite, common on the
Macquarie River, and the appearance of several of our Bathurst plants,
suggested to us that a change of country was near at hand.</p>
<p>Clearing the more bushy forest an immense expanse of clear open hilly
country opened to our view, with valleys having much the appearance of the
rising grounds between Campbell's River and Bathurst. The hills are bare and
grassy, but the soil is not much better than that already passed. Travelling
through the valley on an easterly course we arrived at a creek, which we traced
down and in it discovered water in abundance for ourselves and horses.
Accordingly we halted for the day and pitched our tent on its high bank, having
made good 13&frac14; miles. The hills between which this creek runs are rocky
and productive of some fine plants. <i>Acacia spectabilis</i> (a new sp.), with
bipinnate leaves, and axillary elongated spikes of flowers, making a very
magnificent appearance. <i>Acacia sp.</i>, with terminal panicles of flowers,
common on the Bathurst Plains. <i>Tecoma Oxleyi</i>; <i>Prostanthera nivea</i>;
<i>Grevillea sp.</i>, allied to <i>G. sphacelata</i>, and an <i>Hibbertia</i>
with linear leaves and fine yellow flowers. We saw kangaroo and emu, of which
our dogs secured some for us. Among some burnt grassy spots I observed an
entire-leaved <i>Solamim</i>, and another with broad ovate glossy foliage,
aculeated, and glaucus beneath; they were not in flower. The timber is Bastard
Box and <i>Callitris sp.</i>, seen first at Mount Aiton, with scales of the
fruit sub-calceolated, and some fine lofty specimens of <i>Sterculia
heterophylla</i>.</p>
<p><i>8th. Friday.</i> Our horses required rest from the labours of the 4 last
days. We therefore continued at our encampment in the vale, which has been
called Hamelin's Valley. In the afternoon I visited some hills in the
neighbourhood, on the rocky summit of which I gathered specimens of a new plant
of the <i>Epacrideae</i>, (<i>Leucopogon</i>).</p>
<p>I gathered likewise some duplicate seeds of <i>Tecoma Oxleyi</i>. We find by
observation our tent is situate in lat. 32&deg;47'58" S., and long. 147&deg;50'
E., and the mean variation of the compass is 5&deg;20' E.</p>
<p><i>9th. Saturday.</i> Resuming our journey from Hamelin's Valley on a course
N.E. by E. the country assumes an appearance that we hoped to have passed
altogether. At the extremity of the vale we entered a thick brushwood of
diminutive <i>Eucalyptus</i>, <i>Cypress</i> and <i>Acacia</i>, which continues
until terminated by some rising rocky ground, covered for the most part with
iron bark, which is not in flower. These little hills form boundaries to small
valleys, on their eastern sides having abundance of high brown grass. I
observed several unusually large specimens of <i>Sterculia heterophylla</i>
from one of which I procured specimens in pod and a few seeds. The timber,
although 20 in. to 2 ft. 6 in. diameter, cannot be appropriated to any useful
or ornamental purposes in cabinet or other works, on account of its soft and
spongy texture. A short period after it has been bruised or cut a resinous gum
oozes from the wound, and is of the nature and colour of the resin produced by
the several genera of the <i>Coniferae</i>. It was at 7 miles on this day's
route we arrived at a thick brush, through which ran a creek north and south,
containing some stagnant discoloured water. At this providential place we
watered the horses.</p>
<p>Among the interesting plants observed in this brush, a species of
<i>Daviesia</i> with linear round spinescent leaves and axillary racemes of
flowers, which is now very luxuriant, with <i>Acacia obliqua</i> and <i>A.
pendula</i>. The land for the next 6 miles is brushy forest and rocky
Eucalyptian hills, succeeded by a confined brush of Cypress, in which I
gathered the seeds and specimens of a second species of shrub of the habit of
<i>Westringia</i>, with quadrangular sulcated horizontal branches. Clearing the
brush we came upon an open grassy district, and halted at a spot where there
was abundance of wood, and grass for the horses, but no water. Mr. Oxley sent a
man in search of some, but he returned unsuccessful. The water we had had the
precaution to carry in a keg was served out to each of us at one and a half
pint per man.</p>
<p><i>10th. Sunday.</i> We sent at daybreak two of our people to a small water
hole 2&frac12; miles back on the journey of yesterday for some water for our
breakfast. We were obliged to advance forward this morning in consequence of
the want of water for our horses and selves. About 3 miles at the commencement
of our journey the country is fine and open, grassy and thickly clothed with
timber common about Bathurst, the Lachlan dep&ocirc;t and the Eastern coast.
Onward about 4 miles the land exhibits a miserable barren appearance with
irregular risings and scrubs of the description passed yesterday. To our
surprise, at 6&frac34; miles we came suddenly to a rocky creek containing some
fine water, at present stagnant, but having the marks of flood and hence
suggesting the idea of its deriving its supplies from the hills southward, and
running when full northerly and ultimately emptying itself into the Macquarie.
Mr. Oxley rode down it 6 miles, when its general tendency was northerly in the
character of a chain of ponds. About a mile down the creek (in which <i>Arundo
phragmites</i> is frequent), which is about 8 feet wide, we halted and pitched
our tent on the side of an old native encampment. Here we saw quantities of the
horse-mussel shells with which the creek had furnished them, and some stones on
which they had been sharpening some weapons or instruments, perhaps their mogos
or stone hatchets. The very recent marks of kangaroo and emu among the fine
brown grass and forest land in the vicinity of the creek are proofs of the
abundance of those animals in these fine grassy grounds. I gathered fresh
specimens of <i>Callitris glauca</i>, those that I had formerly collected
having suffered from friction. The <i>Styphelia</i>, first seen on George's
Range, I noticed in the brush of this day.</p>
<p><i>11th. Monday.</i> We remained the whole of the day at our encampment on
this creek, which Mr. Oxley has termed Gaygarne's Ponds, after a friend of his.
Our lat. is 32&deg;44'29" S., and long. 148&deg;14'15" East, and mean variation
of the compass is 7&deg;18'00" S. Our hunters returned from the chase with
three kangaroos.</p>
<p><i>12th. Tuesday.</i> We pursued our journey northerly of the course we have
been travelling for some days past in hopes of intersecting the Macquarie
River, which from appearances could not be far distant. Course N.E. Having
passed the grassy forest land near the creek, we arrived at the margin of an
open plain, from which we had a view of a distant range northward of us, which
appeared very lofty. Stretching over the plain about a mile we passed through a
very sterile scrubby district, somewhat elevated, thickly wooded with Bastard
Box, Cypress, and the Casuarina (or Swamp Oak), and having the same character
in the botany as before observed. The Acaciae, which are predominant, are not
so far advanced towards a flowering state as we had seen them some days
previously. This brush continues to the termination of our journey this day
(which was 12 miles), and we pitched our tent near some holes of water, where
was burnt grass for the horses. I gathered duplicate seeds of <i>Scaevola
prostrata</i> and of a species of <i>Myoporum</i>, a common shrub in the brush.
The travelling was for the most part soft and boggy this day. The small
<i>Adiantum</i>; <i>Lobelia sp.</i>, allied to <i>L. purpurascens</i>; and a
species of <i>Satureia</i>, all plants of swamps, were observed on the plains.
In clear water-holes at our present resting place I discovered a second species
of an <i>Alisma</i>, it appears of stronger growth than the species common in
running waters in New South Wales.</p>
<p><i>13th. Wednesday.</i> Still in hopes of seeing the Macquarie River we
continued our route on the same N.E. course on which we had travelled
yesterday. In about 2 miles from our halting place we came to a creek or small
rivulet from 12 to 14 feet wide, and between 5 and 6 feet deep, which received
the waters falling from the lofty range to the southward and eastward, whose
elevated summit we occasionally had a glimpse of through the trees. By the
motionless appearance of dead leaves floating on its surface the stream was
just discernible running to the northward. Crossing this water (which abounds
with several common aquatic plants, such as <i>Potamogeton natans</i>,
<i>Actinocarpus</i>, etc.), by means of a fallen tree, but passing our horses
over higher up at a rocky ford, we continued our journey about 7 miles over a
barren scrubby country broken with dry water-holes encircled by swamp oak
(<i>Casuarina</i>), cypress and <i>Acacia Pendula</i>. I had occasion in this
day's route to make the same observation relative to the backwardness of the
plants in a flowering state which we have seen expanded some days past in the
south-westward. The land assumes an improving state, being slightly brushed
foresty country, covered with flint, strong brome grass and timber of
<i>Callitris sp.</i> (common at Bathurst), and Bastard Box of considerable
bulk. At the termination Of 12&frac12; miles, arriving at some holes of water,
we stopped for the night. This water is tinged with the colour of the white
sandy marsh through which it filters, and runs gently over a rushy cypress
flat.</p>
<p><i>14th. Thursday.</i> At an early hour we advanced on our journey over a
continuance of the same grassy forest land on which we had halted last night.
Thickly wooded for about 5 miles, and becoming hilly as we approached the lofty
range before us. On the first rising ground, which is clothed with western iron
bark, I discovered a new species of <i>Acacia impressa</i> and a species of
<i>Leucopogon</i>; the <i>Acacia</i> forming a small tree 10-12 feet high, and
in young fruit and flower. The timber on the succession of hills and grassy
valleys was unvaried until we had passed 8 miles, to another rocky eminence,
where <i>Eucalyptus micrantha</i> or Bastard Box becomes less frequent, but is
succeeded by the stringy bark of the eastern coast. I likewise observed plants
that are indigenous near Sydney, such as <i>Zamia spiralis</i>,
<i>Xanthorrhaea</i>, <i>Hakea</i>, <i>Kennedya monophylla</i> and <i>Calythrix
tetragona</i>. A glaucous, oblique-leaved <i>Eucalyptus</i>, first observed in
the Vale of Clwyd, is frequent in the valley.</p>
<p>Passing several gullies or water courses that ran through the valley, we
ascended a rocky mount near to but detached from the range, whence Mr. Oxley
took several bearings. The country appeared perfectly flat, presenting a clear
horizon from N. to W. and round to the south. Finding it necessary to change
the course to due east, we continued until we had cleared 12&frac12; miles,
when we halted at a creek, whose waters ran through a thick cypress
channel.</p>
<p>We had scarcely unladen our horses and pitched the tent, when some of our
people distinctly heard a continual hammering, as of a native with his hatchet.
Mr. Oxley with some of our people went towards the spot whence the sound
proceeded--about a quarter of a mile from our encampment--and discovered a
native upon a tree, cutting out an opossum from its hollow trunk, in which the
little animal had taken refuge from its pursuers. He became alarmed as we
approached the tree, crying out to his companions, which soon brought another
native from the hills--loaded with kangaroo, rats and snakes--to his
assistance. It was with much persuasion, and more particularly when he observed
that we were kind to his comrade, that this native was induced to descend the
tree to us. We led them to our tent and sat them down by our fire, at which
they roasted the fruits of their labours entire, gutting the opossum, and when
sufficiently baked, devouring the entrails first, as a great delicacy, which
they appeared to enjoy the more when powdered and peppered with fine
wood-ashes! Although exceedingly intimidated by our numbers, and lost in wonder
at our colour and all things belonging to us around them their shyness and
fears gradually disappeared when they experienced our kind treatment. They ate
of our bread and drank of our water from a tin pot, which they had never seen
before, and became very loquacious. Mr. Oxley exchanged for a green jade
hatchet of theirs an old iron one of ours. We showed them with what despatch
and great ease we could cut horizontally through a gum tree, which with their
mogos or stone axes woould be a work of great labour, and would be only bruised
through diagonally. We showed them their image a glass, and took them to our
horses, the sight of which with everything about them was a source of much
surprise, which they manifested in wild extravagant gestures and grimaces. Mr.
Oxley presented them with a knife and a handkerchief. They were young men of 5
feet 4-6 inches, of well-proportioned features, and with large bushy heads of
hair, which gave them a wild ferocious appearance. The cartilage of the nose of
one of them was perforated and a stick or reed passed through it. They did not
want for their front teeth. The pain occasioned by the deep tattooing process
on their backs and breasts must be almost intolerable. Large cartilaginous
pieces of flesh projected from their backs--almost an inch--forming various
figures. They were perfectly naked, and had no spears or weapons of defence.
Desirous of departing to their companions, whose numbers (perhaps their women?)
they gave us to understand by their fingers were five--and whose faces we saw
from the rocky hill to-day, they walked off without the least signs of fear or
distrust.</p>
<p><i>15th. Friday.</i> Resuming our journey easterly about 9 o'clock we were
obliged to steer our course more northerly, in order to avoid some lofty parts
of the range by passing over the lower risings or bends of the same. The whole
of this day's journey was a succession of hills and valleys, well watered by
creeks running in various bends through them, generally inclining northerly;
and throughout the whole there is no want or scarcity of water, although there
has been no rain of any consequence for a considerable time. The timber is
Bastard Box, Western Iron Bark, and some few specimens of the <i>Eucalyptus</i>
and Stringy Bark on the hills, on which there were some fine fragments of red
granite and some pieces of limestone.</p>
<p>The plants observed to-day were not different from any before seen,
<i>Acacia impressa</i> is frequent on the rocky hills, with several others of
its congeners. Our courses from the nature of the country were various,
generally easterly; the continual ascents and descents were very fatiguing to
our horses and ourselves, and induced us to halt at 10&frac12; miles on a spot
where we could furnish ourselves with abundance of dead wood and water from a
reed-grassy creek that was in a running state.</p>
<p>It is a singular fact that we came upon the footmarks of oxen very deep on
the banks of a water course in the valley. We traced them along the creek a
considerable distance in order to ascertain beyond doubt this remarkable
incident. They may be the Government cattle that were missing from Cox's River,
and which were supposed and reported accordingly to have died in the mountains.
Our baggage horses were followed by nine natives (men) during the last 6 miles
of this journey to our tent. They manifested no symptoms of fear when they came
up to us, were very talkative, and expressed their surprise at different
objects around them. They appeared to be acquainted with iron nails, and from
this circumstance it is very possible they had seen some white men in or about
Bathurst, or had been in company with some stock-keepers and cattle drivers on
the Macquarie River, which they appeared to be well acquainted with, and made
signs as to the direction that stream bore from us which gave us hopes of
seeing it in a few days. Our dogs had killed for us some kangaroos; we
therefore gave them the forequarters of one of these animals, which they
roasted at our fires. Having served out to ourselves and people the ration of
pork and flour, we broke up the casks and converted the iron hoops into swords
with which we furnished each of them one, presenting to the most intelligent
man (apparently), an old file, the use of which we learned him by sharpening
the edge of his cimetar. They appeared highly delighted with these pieces of
iron, which they would soon turn to a variety of uses. We likewise gave them
each a piece of pork, which they did not appear to relish--on account of its
saltness. After our people had enjoyed a dance or corroboree with them, these
harmless inoffensive natives left us, returning the road they came. They were
two elderly, six strong younger men and a lad; and their appearances and habits
were the same as of those seen yesterday. They were quite naked and unarmed and
the lad appeared to be related to a person of eminence from the circumstance of
his seating himself at a small distance from the rest, and from the respect
they appeared to pay him, and the tattooing on his back was more diversified
and different.</p>
<p><i>16th. Saturday.</i> Slight frost. We left our last night's resting place,
pursuing an easterly course through grassy valleys bounded by gentle hills,
covered loosely with lamina of red slate substance, fragments of red granite
and some tolerably fair specimens of agate, some of which were, however,
fractured. At 4 miles on our journey we ascended a lofty tree; from thence we
had a view of the country to the N.E. and S.E., which consists of hills and
vales thinly clothed with timber. The general inclination of these hills is
from the southward to the north. A misty line of exhalation arising between the
hills induced us to change our course to N.E., on which route we advanced about
4 miles and a half when to our surprise we arrived at the right bank of a
stream[*] which we supposed might possibly be the Macquarie, the river we have
so long calculated upon and wished to see. The water is clear and there is
enough current in it to state it is not stagnant. It is now about 4 feet deep
and is in places overrun with <i>Arundo phragmites</i>, and had marks of flood
12 feet above its present level. Its banks are rocky, occasionally very high
and perpendicular, of red earth. In some places it formed handsome straight
reaches, which gave to this rivulet a pleasant picturesque appearance. The
cattle tracks were very distinct and deep on its banks, which are now dry and
dusty, proving to us that no rain had fallen for some time.</p>
<blockquote>[* Named by Oxley, Molle's Rivulet.]</blockquote>
<p>We traced the rivulet for 3 miles and crossed it, availing ourselves of a
shoaly rocky part to ford over to the opposite high bank where we encamped. The
hills on this side were fired by the natives, the flames making rapid progress
in the dry high grass. The plants now became exceedingly uninteresting. The
timber is small iron and stringy bark on the hills: several Bathurst plants are
common on the lower lands. <i>Eucalyptus perfoliata</i> of the Vale of Clwyd,
with <i>Persoonia spathulata</i> are common on the grassy flats. Our journey
was 12&frac12; miles. A lofty mount seen northerly from the hill on which we
ascended this morning has been called Mount Johnson. The channel of the river
abounds with <i>Azolla pinnata</i>, floating on its surface.</p>
<p><i>17th. Sunday.</i> Mild morning. We rested the whole of this day.
<i>Hibbertia cuneata</i>, <i>Swainsona coronillaefolia</i>, <i>Croton
acerifolius</i>, <i>Indigofera australls</i>, and <i>Croton</i>, are all plants
on the banks of the rivulet. From a fine grassy hill bearing three quarters of
a mile N. by E. I gathered specimens of a bulbous rooted <i>Cyperus</i> with
woolly leaves; <i>Eucalyptus glauca</i>, forming a tree 30 feet or 40 feet
high, with an angular umbel of flowers, is frequent, and, being now in flower,
induced me to gather specimens. Fraser, who had been sent away a few miles in
order to ascertain, if possible, something more satisfactory respecting the
rivulet, returned having made no new discovery. On the highlands and rising
grassy spots I gathered specimens of an <i>Acacia</i> appearing distinct from
<i>A. decurrens</i>, not only in the habit of its inflorescence but in the
position of its glands and form of its foliage. It is an arbuscula and apt to
form thick bushes.</p>
<p>I accompanied Mr. Oxley and Mr. Evans to the summit of a hill of steep
ascent, which has been called Elizabeth Hill, where some bearings were taken of
remarkable points on the course we intended to pursue. Between a range of hills
running north and south and bearing E.N.E. 10 miles, there is an appearance of
a river, from the steep perpendicular banks descending to a valley or hollow,
and we could trace a line of haze for a considerable length south and north,
above the summits of the hills over the valley. From these appearances we are
inclined to believe that the Macquarie is there situated, running northerly,
and that this watercourse on which we are encamped is only a conductor of the
rain in a body to the river north-westerly of us. We caught a fish in this
rivulet.</p>
<p><i>18th. Monday.</i> Previous to leaving our present encampment I planted
some peach stones on the rich bank of this supposed rivulet. Our course this
day is east-southerly over a country for the first 10 miles appearing somewhat
different from the aspect it presented some days previous, being scarcely so
open and more encumbered with small timber, less hilly, and occasionally
covered with <i>Acacia</i>. The soil is good and the whole fine grazing land,
flats or valleys, producing an abundance of <i>Dalea</i>, with procumbent
stems, frequent at the dep&ocirc;t on Lachlan River. Crossing a deep dry creek,
we passed a flat burnt tract and ascended a range of rocky hills in our course,
which there is no avoiding. From their summit the country to the southward and
eastward appears very hilly and broken as far as the eye could see. We could
clearly distinguish in a north easterly direction, between the opening of the
hills, a strip appearing like a sandbank or a body of reeds on the bank of a
river.</p>
<p>It is evident from the uneven and broken nature of the country before us
that there must exist a considerable channel to receive and carry off the great
bodies of water that fall at different seasons on these hills and collect in
the deep gullies below. Our present course being stopped by deep ravines and
water courses, we descended with some difficulty with all our horses, and
followed the windings of the gullies upwards of 3 miles But finding we were not
near their termination we halted at dusk on the margin of a swamp formed by the
stagnant waters. This connexion of ravines, winding in different directions
(generally north-easterly) and bounded by rocky elevated hills on each side,
has a very picturesque appearance, and has been called Glen Finlas. Fragments
of limestone were picked up by our people in a half-burnt st ate.</p>
<p>Some beautiful plants are found in this glen, of which the following are the
most material. <i>Pullenaea sp.</i>, rich in flowers--a beautiful shrub--and
<i>Oxylobium sp.</i> The rocky declivities were covered with a beautiful
<i>Acacia</i>, having small, oblong, oblique, villous leaves, and axillary
racemes of flowers, forming a tree 16-20 feet high--<i>A. conspicua</i>.
<i>Bignonia australis</i> is very common, supporting itself on shrubs.
<i>Cryptandra ericifolia</i> is likewise in great profusion.</p>
<p>I here observed with surprise <i>Correa speciosa</i>, reminding us of a part
of Western Australia that none of our party cares to see or visit again.
<i>Croton viscosus</i> of Mount Flinders and Macquarie Range formed here very
strong plants. <i>Pimelea colorans</i> is very fine, and shows its character in
the shaded excavations. A new <i>Helichrysum</i> with slender fine leaves and
terminal white flowers. <i>H. linifolium</i>, is very common. A small
<i>Westringia triphylla</i>, first observed in the low country N.E. of Mount
Aiton, is common beneath the shelving rocks of the glen. A species of
<i>Cassia</i> with 6 or 7 pairs of leaflets, which are lanceolate and revolute,
the glands pedicelled, and the stipules subulate. I gathered specimens of this
shrub in pod. <i>Hibbertia sp.</i>, a weak, trailing, shrubby plant, on rocks.
Our journey this day was 14&frac12; miles.</p>
<p><i>19th. Tuesday.</i> Our journey this morning continued through the Glen,
tracing the several windings of the water-course for the space of 2 miles,
where it terminated, opening to us a most beautiful spacious valley, thinly
clothed with timber of moderate size and covered with brome grass, growing very
luxuriantly in a very rich black soil, and plentifully watered by a rapid,
limpid rivulet[*] winding through its centre, which being connected with the
encircling lofty hills, thickly covered with cypress to their summits,
beautifies the vale exceedingly. The rivulet is about 3&frac12; feet deep and
10-12 feet wide, having the reed grass on its margin, and the <i>Azolla</i> in
great abundance on its surface. <i>Casuarinae</i> are also scattered on the
banks--of large size.</p>
<p>Tracing the rivulet down through the vale, we crossed and continued on its
north bank. Mr. Oxley traced it to its junction with a large fine stream about
2 miles down the vale, which we doubt not is the long wished for Macquarie
River. Its banks are high, shelving and rocky, and thinly clothed with several
of the <i>Eucalypti</i>, among which are abundance of that irregular tree
called the Apple Tree in New South Wales. In the course of our advancement from
the north bank of the Lachlan River to this vale, which is a distance of 150
miles, we crossed 7 creeks all tending northerly to this river, which
accumulates as it runs the accession of water it receives on both sides from
the country around. The soil continues uniformly rich and good through the vale
to its immediate banks. The bottom or bed of the river is sandy and gravelly,
and very large horse-mussels are found in it. Our huntsmen, who left us early
in the glen and who were the first persons to come upon the vale, saw a large
flock of emu feeding, of which our dogs could only get one bird. There can be
no doubt, by diligent search, that limestone in quantities might be found on
the hills, as we noticed some few fragments yesterday, and there are timbers of
various kinds by which, added to the luxuriance of the soil, all the desires of
the industrious settler are granted. In clear rocky waterholes in the glen
there is a species of <i>Potamogeton</i> with ovate, alternate, broad leaves,
and lanceolate undulated ones beneath the water sheathing the stem. It was not
in flower or seed. Tracing the river up 2 miles we encamped on its banks. The
valley is called by Mr. Oxley, Wellington Vale.[**]</p>
<blockquote>[* Named by Oxley, Bell River, in honour of Major
Bell.]</blockquote>
<blockquote>[** Where now stands the town of Wellington.]</blockquote>
<p><i>20th. Wednesday.</i> We continued in the vale all the day in order to
make some general observations relative to the natural productions that would
be so beneficial to the settlers in this fertile tract of country. Among the
plants indigenous to its banks, I noticed <i>Solanum laciniatum</i>, common on
the eastern coast, now in fruit, which is ovate and of an orange colour; and a
species of <i>Rubus</i>. <i>Urtica dioica</i>, and <i>Croton acerifolius</i>.
Some of our people, who had been in pursuit of game, brought from the hills
some fragments of stone, which appeared to them to be similar to the limestone
of the creek of that name in long 149&deg;00'00" or thereabouts, which we
crossed on the 22nd April on our way to the Lachlan Dep&ocirc;t. This stone
very strongly effervesced on the application of acids. By reference to our
situation on the charts it appears that the doubts we have had respecting our
longitude are unfounded; our computations are correct. We are exactly on the
meridian of the Limestone Creek. It is hence that a singular hypothesis has
arisen that the stratum of lime runs N. and S. on that very particular
meridian, which is likewise applicable to the vegetable productions.
<i>Metrosideros saligna</i>, <i>Croton acerifolius</i>, <i>Callitris sp.</i>,
and some other plants of the above-mentioned creek are in great abundance in
the vale here and in Glen Finlas.</p>
<p>The stream on which we were encamped on Sunday last we have now called
Molle's Rivulet. By observations taken by Mr. Oxley with a sextant we find our
lat. is 32&deg; 32' 45" S., and long. 149&deg; 20' 00" E. as computed. Mean
var. of compass is 8&deg; 38' E. Mr. Oxley intends to remain at our present
station the whole of to-morrow, which will enable him to ride down the river a
few miles. Our dogs furnished us with plenty of fresh provisions having killed
4 large emus on the flats near the river, where they abound. We likewise caught
some fish.</p>
<p>21st. Thursday. This morning I accompanied Mr. Oxley and Mr. Evans on
horseback down the river to ascertain its general direction and the character
of the country in its vicinity. Riding down the vale we crossed the rivulet,
but were unable to keep the banks of the river, in consequence of the steep
sloping rocky hills which run down to the water. We were obliged to trace the
gullies through the ravines formed by lofty hills.</p>
<p>At intervals some beautiful views of the bend of the river bounded by rich
verdant flats on each side were presented to us from the openings in and on the
summits of the hills. At one place the river forms a depressed serpentine
figure, and led us at first sight to suspect another stream as large as itself
ran from the northwestward and had formed a junction with it. Having cleared
the hills we followed the river on its immediate bank about 12 miles, in which
space it forms many handsome, bold reaches with occasional easy windings to
various points of the compass but whose general tendency is northerly. Arriving
at a rocky perpendicular bank, perhaps 80 ft. above the river, which runs under
it, we had a commanding view of the rich flats on its banks and the fine grassy
land in the far ground, thickly wooded. About a mile to the northward of this
rock may be seen a very high red bank on the opposite side of the river, to
reach which we rode over some luxuriant tracts covered with a variety of
herbage. We are upwards of 12 miles from our encampment and the whole of the
country is a continuation of that excellence of soil and fit for every purpose
of agriculture. The marks of the flood were about 16 ft. above the level of the
river. The country has been burnt at no distant period, and the grass that has
grown from the old clumps is exceedingly strong and luxuriant.</p>
<p>Returning to the remarkably large rock, which is of a black slaty colour and
nature and has a dip or inclination of about 45 degrees east. I discovered a
specimen of Hovea elliptica, which appeared to be the <i>Poiretia elliptica</i>
of Dr. Smith, gathered at King George's Sound by Mr. Menzies. It is a shrub of
about 5 feet in height, of slender habit, and is in flower. The flowers are
produced from the axils of the leaves. Being the predominant plant of this
singular point we have proposed to call it Hove's Rock, as a compliment to
Antony Hove Esqr., a traveller in Cape Colony. From this point of view are seen
some gentle windings and noble reaches of this wandering stream, which is of a
regular uniform breadth of about 40 yards. <i>Dodonaea heterophylla</i>,
<i>Swainsona coronillaefolia</i>, <i>Haloragis tetragyna</i>, a filiform
<i>Campanula</i>, a viscid <i>Acrostichum</i>, <i>Kennedya monophylla</i>, and
<i>Clematis occidentalis</i>, compose the whole of the Flora of Hove's Rock. We
passed on our route back to the tent several abandoned native encampments on
the river side, from which we picked up some few large shells of the
horse-mussel, which the natives had procured from the reed grass in the river,
for the sake of their fish, which had been roasted. On a Sterculia we observed
some ancient marks of the natives, of the same description and character as at
the Aboriginean Mausoleum under Piper's Hill, but time had mouldered the grave
down to the level of the soil, and we saw no vestige of any remains.</p>
<p>The river, we observed, is apt to divide its stream for a short distance,
and form long strips of islands between the streamlets, which again unite. Near
one of these places we disturbed an emu and four young ones. In our return
through the ravines I gathered fine specimens of <i>Helichrysum linifolium</i>
a shrub of the <i>Myrtaceae</i>, 10-12 feet high, in fruit is rare on the
hills; with a species of <i>Cryptandra</i>, larger than <i>C. ericifolia</i>.
Strong marks of wild or strayed cattle we raced on the banks. Some of the
cypresses on the hills are of large dimensions and excellent for house timbers,
and the <i>Casuarina</i> or Swamp Oak is very strong, of considerable bulk and
very useful for shingling roofs. Bright moonlight night. We discovered
abundance of limestone in rocks and some fragments on the hills; some, that had
been half burnt by the natives having fired the grassy hills, had been changed
lime by the subsequent action of the rain upon it.</p>
<h4>RETURN JOURNEY To BATHURST. AUGUST 22ND-29TH, 1817</h4>
<p><i>Aug. 22nd. Friday.</i> Opposite our tent we strongly marked a Blue Gum
tree of considerable magnitude on sides facing the four principal cardinal
points as a mark of our first encampment on the Macquarie River; and I planted
on the bank the two last of my peach stones and the remaining seeds of quinces.
The rain threatened much about the period of our leaving the vale; we were,
however, the more desirous of proceeding forward to Bathurst as our provisions
were daily diminishing. The country as we advanced is a succession of fine
valleys, with gentle rising hills covered with grass and not encumbered with
timber. On a hill running down to the river about 3 miles from our late
encampment we observed considerable quantities of limestone, and some few
specimens of agate, as well as lamina between granite, as we detached loose
pieces of irregular form and slaty substances of divers colours. The rain that
had set in very heavy about noon obliged us, by its incessant continuance, to
stop for the day at about 5&frac12; miles journey. Fair at dusk. The hills
around us abound with a delicate species of <i>Pimelea</i> differing from <i>P.
curviflora</i> in the leaves being more lanceolate, and the lobes of the calyx
(or corolla) being of an orange-red colour and somewhat more acute. Our people
caught several fish of 2 or 3 lbs. weight, and our dogs secured kangaroo and 2
emu.</p>
<p><i>23rd. Saturday.</i> Continuing our journey on the banks of the river,
which, with the grassy hills, produce a strong luxuriant grass and are thickly
wooded with <i>Eucalyptus sp.</i>, Blue Gum and Apple Trees, with very few
<i>Callitris</i>. The travelling near the river becomes difficult, by reason of
some deep gullies that conduct the water from the neighbouring hills to the
river. We noticed some lofty hills on the opposite side, but more distant from
its immediate bank than those on this side, which frequently run down to the
water's edge. The <i>Acacia sp.</i>, (allied to <i>A. decurrens</i>), form some
magnificent small trees from 25 to 30 feet high, decorating as well as the
hills the margin of the stream with its tresses of golden flowers. Our dogs
chased a large buck kangaroo from the hills into the river, over which he swam,
but was followed by them and after being turned swam back again and was
ultimately killed. Perhaps there are few instances, as we have seen none in our
journey, wherein a greater tenacity of life had shown itself than in this
instance.</p>
<p>We traced the river up about 11 miles, crossing several deep water-courses,
which were very fatiguing and harassing to our pack-horses. The river, which
ran generally from the southward, had formed a gentle wind from the south-west
when we stopped for the day. It was running rapidly over a stony bottom,
forming a kind of slight fall, called a ripple. A species of <i>Acacia
oleaefolia</i> [= <i>A. lunata</i>], and another species, more common on the
margin of the gullies, viz. <i>Acacia sp.</i>, with lanceolate, oblique leaves
having 3 glands at equal distances on their interior margin; flowers axillary
and panicled. Some of the <i>Papilionaceae</i> of the class <i>Decandria</i>,
before mentioned, are now very frequent. The height of former flood is about 25
feet above its present level.</p>
<p><i>24th. Sunday.</i> Although we had travelled yesterday over about 11 miles
in a winding circuitous route, tracing the river, yet on our direct course to
Bathurst we had not made good more than 4 miles. This delay, added to the great
difficulty of travelling immediately on the river in consequence of the many
deep, sharp gullies, obliged us to quit the river's bank altogether and steer a
course more southerly in order to travel straight to the settlement. We served
out the last of our flour and pork this evening, which ration is to serve us a
week, until our arrival M the plains.</p>
<p>Upon leaving the river the country becomes very hilly, and we were unable to
keep any direct line of course, but chose those elevations easiest of
accession. Had we continued on the river bank, although we might have met with
deep gullies from the hills, we should have generally experienced much better
travelling, and firmer for the horses feet, and a more clear interesting tract
of country than we have had on this day's journey, which only entangled us
among hills covered with loose fragments of granite. Passing the first mile or
thereabouts, the land is thickly burdened with small timber and becomes bushy
and scrubby. <i>Daviesia mimosoides</i> (H.K.), <i>D. acicularis</i>,
<i>Oxylobium sp.</i>, allied to <i>0. cordifolum</i>, very common. <i>Acacia
sp.</i>, allied to <i>A. armata</i>, but furnished with longer spinescent
stipulae, the pubescent variety of <i>A. obliqua</i> of <i>Persoon</i>:
<i>Veronica perfoliala</i>, <i>Dianella sp.</i>, and some common species of
<i>Pimelea</i>. The timber is very small, of <i>Eucalyptus glauca</i> and <i>E.
sp.</i>, leaves obovate, with flowers in umbellated racemes, terminal and
crowded. On the rocky hills I gathered specimens of some of <i>Orchidaceae</i>
allied to <i>Arethusa</i>; <i>Diuris sp.</i> Our horses were so much fatigued
as to oblige us to halt in a stony situation on the margin of a gully
containing some running water, which we found very hard, and hence we suspect
it originated in a spring. We travelled 8&frac12; miles. Soil excepting in the
brushy spots generally good.</p>
<p><i>25th. Monday.</i> Mr. Oxley rode forward with our tomahawkman, to mark a
road for the baggage and horses to pass over the hills and the easier descents
to the valleys, which expand to a greater extent as we advanced a few miles,
being covered with high brome grass and small timber of Bastard Box. About 7
miles from our last night's resting place we arrived at a small stream of
water, very fine and clear, running westerly over a rocky bottom, and doubtless
having its source in the hills. Passing from this rippling stream of water over
some gentle hills that had been very recently burnt by the natives, the country
becomes less difficult, and the valleys are fine and grassy, abundantly watered
with creeks of running water meandering through the lower lands. The general
inclination of the gullies and water-courses, is to the westward, and hence it
may be inferred that they collect themselves into the rivulet which runs
through Wellington Vale, and ultimately empty themselves into the
Macquarie.</p>
<p>The valleys abound with game. Our dogs killed a buck and doe kangaroo. To
the nipple of the abdominal pouch of the latter was attached a small young
kangaroo, which appeared to have grown out of it. It was perfectly naked and
blind. By what means the young of these animals are brought forth and placed in
the pouch is not ascertained and it still remains a mystery. I gathered
specimens of a species of <i>Hakea</i>, a weak twiggy plant, frequent in high
grass. In low brushy spots I observed <i>Cryptandra amara</i>, <i>Dodonaea
heterophylla</i>, <i>Veronica perfoliata</i>, <i>Zamia spiralis</i> and
<i>Acacia armatoides</i>. <i>Exocarpus cupressiformis</i>, a native cherry, is
very common on the hills. Arriving at some running water in a valley our
perambulator showed that we had travelled 11 miles. We therefore halted at 2
o'clock and pitched our tent. Mount Lachlan bore from us due south very
distant.</p>
<p>We could distinguish its lofty summit over an elevated range north of it and
from its blueness of appearance it could not be less than 40 miles from us. We
have made about 10 miles south which was our general course this day.</p>
<p><i>26th. Tuesday.</i> We left our last night's encampment at an early hour
on the course we travelled yesterday. About 4 miles from our camp a fine creek
of water runs through the valley easterly to the river, which is a few miles
distant from us. Some brushy patches afforded me handsome specimens of
<i>Acacia verniciflua</i>, a new species seen on the Lachlan River, but not
until now in flower; it is highly glossed with a viscid gum. I likewise
discovered <i>Acacia vomeriformis</i>, a new species, with triangular leaves,
differing from <i>A. biflora</i> in the elongation of the exterior angle of the
leaf, and the floral capitulum being solitary, axillary and many-flowered. The
flowers are sulphur coloured. The little <i>Hovea heterophylla</i> is as
frequent on the hills as it is abundant among the grass in the valleys. Several
Eastern coast plants now begin to appear such as <i>Stylidium gummifolium</i>,
<i>Tetratheca ericifolia</i>, and <i>Gompholobium latifolium</i>. I gathered
flowering specimens of a species of <i>Hakea microcarpa</i>, with the lower
leaves flat and entire, while those of the branches are filiform. <i>Loranthus
aurantiacus</i>, parasitical on the Blue Gum, which timber succeeds the
<i>Eucalyptus</i> called Stringy Bark at about 8 miles on this day's journey.
We had advanced about 10 miles when we into a valley, crossed a creek of
running water and, passing through a thick brush of <i>Pultenaea</i>, descended
a hill to the hollow and halted, having made on our southerly course 12&frac12;
miles, which with some to easterly amounted to 13&frac12; miles. Some of the
hills produce a slaty stone, and it is the opinion of some of us that coal
might be found beneath its surface. Abundance of kangaroo in the valleys. They
were, however, too fleet, and only one small buck was taken.</p>
<p><i>27th. Wednesday.</i> From the valley we pursued our route with an
unwearied perseverance in hopes of reaching the settlement at Bathurst on
Saturday evening next. We commenced our journey over a very rugged broken
country, particularly to the southward; the high lands to the eastward were
enveloped in a thick mist, which however, evaporated as the day advanced. I
observed on a lofty hill some 6 miles on our journey some good specimens of
blue slate, in thick lamina, which I traced down its declivity to a deep
running rocky gully of water. Mr. Oxley was of the opinion that coal might be
found beneath it, but the difficulty of turning such productions found here to
any colonial use or benefit, on account of the extreme rugged nature of the
country, renders its examination scarcely worth the expense it would naturally
incur. We found likewise some specimens of ironstone. On the summit of some
small hills, which are covered with <i>Eucalyptus dumosa</i>, <i>Acacia
verniciflua</i> and <i>A. vomeriformis</i>, very luxuriantly in flower, I
gathered seeds of <i>Hakea microcarpa</i>. Among the grass a secondary variety
of the little <i>Hovea</i> with white flowers appears. At 10 miles ran a fine
large deep rivulet of water on a very rocky bottom. We were obliged to keep
along the range for a short space, until an easy practicable descent enabled us
to drive our horses without danger down the ravine. We crossed this rivulet,
which is about 3 ft. deep and has a rapid current, and encamped on the rocky
bank opposite. We noticed marks of flood 18 feet perpendicular height over the
slender waving heads of the <i>Casuarinae</i> skirting its channel, in which I
gathered seeds of a dead plant of the <i>Umbelliferae</i>, they are like those
of <i>Trachymene</i>. The steep rugged falls abound with <i>Correa virens</i>
of the Eastern coast, a plant I have not seen throughout the whole of the
expedition. A rigid stiff leafless shrub, with apposite spines, not in flower,
suspected to be a <i>Daviesia</i>, is likewise frequent with the <i>Correa</i>.
Some fine groups of crystals were found in the channel of the creek or rivulet.
The day continued fine throughout. Gathered seeds of <i>Hakea microcarpa</i>,
with specimens in fruit.</p>
<p><i>28th. Thursday.</i> We calculate that we are not more than 36 miles
south-easterly from the settlement and hope to arrive at the plains on Saturday
evening. We had not travelled a mile and a half before we were obliged to
change our course, in consequence of the S.E. rivulet which we had observed
yesterday forming a junction with the other which we had crossed last night,
taking a long winding turn and running southerly. The country in our route is a
continuation of the very broken hilly tract we have travelled over for some
days past. The lower lands grassy, while the more elevated spots are barren and
scrubby. I discovered on these hills a new species of <i>Acacia cuspidata</i>
(a variety of <i>A. diffusa</i>); a shrub of the <i>Proteaceae</i>, which
appears to belong to the genus <i>Anadenia</i> [= <i>Grevillea ilicifolia</i>],
and a <i>Helichrysum</i> with wrinkled calyx, now in flower. Several eastern
coast plants occasionally appear, such as <i>Patersonia sericea</i>,
<i>Pultenaea stipularis</i>, and <i>Billardiera mutabilis</i> [= <i>B.
menders</i>], now in fruit.</p>
<p>About 8 miles on a south easterly course we descended into a valley bounded
by a lofty range running N.W. westerly and S.E. easterly. The valley is very
swampy and covered with very long grass. The timber on the elevated grounds as
well as the surface of the soil, which is very rotten and boggy, has much the
appearance of that at Bathurst. On this range there is a remarkable subconical
point, which Mr. Oxley has called Mount Laver, and another to the northward of
it is entitled Mount Fraser, after His Excellency's collector. Mr. Oxley
ascended the summit of the range and distinguished clearly the plains of
Bathurst above 21 miles distant. The rivulet above mentioned we crossed in the
swampy valley at 10&frac12; miles, at a place where there is a picturesque
narrow fall Of 4-5 feet. It runs to the N.W. parallel with the range. Flood
marks are seen to the height of 6 feet above the level of the river, which of
course inundated the whole of the lands to the base of Mount Laver. Continuing
our journey up the valley, and passing over some short rugged sharp stony hills
and small valleys for about 2 miles, we arrived at a sandy water-course, in
which we found some little water and accordingly halted, having made good
12&frac34; miles. The Blue Gum is more abundant now, and, from the dampnes's of
he rising grounds, it is evident rain has lately fallen. The travelling was
tolerably good, considering the rugged hilly parts over which our route led us.
The descents, however, were more gentle and easy.</p>
<p><i>29th. Friday.</i> We suspect we are distant from the settlement 19 miles
S.E. easterly, and we left our last night's resting place in hopes of
approaching near Bathurst this evening. Crossing several small water-courses
that intersected our course we ascended to the summit of a very rocky eminence
about 1&frac12; miles from our last night's encampment, and from thence the
long wished for plains were presented to our view. On this rugged height I
observed <i>Acacia conspicua</i>, from which I gathered a few more seeds. I
discovered two new plants on this extremely sterile elevation, viz.--<i>Hovea
heterophylla</i>, leaves linear, short and reticulated, furrugineous on the
under side, a new, exceedingly beautiful species, forming a small shrub, now in
flower. I gathered from a plant of it one seed; and <i>Zieria sp.</i>, a bushy
dense shrub, with ternate ovate tomentose leaves, and axillary peduncles of
flowers.</p>
<p>We had had a very long campaign in Western Australia, and were literally
upon our last legs in point of dress throughout the whole of us. We all felt a
degree of joy when we cherished the hope that a few hours would restore us to
permanent habitations and to the society of friends and countrymen. Although a
hilly long journey, but having a fine day before us, we determined if possible
to reach the settlement this evening, and accordingly we each set out a fresh
man and horse, with good spirits, and at a brisk pace on an easterly
course.</p>
<p><i>Banksia compar</i> [= <i>B. integrifolia</i>], which we have not seen, or
any of its genus, since April last, is now become very common. <i>Pteris
aquilina</i> or common brake is likewise abundant on the grassy hills. Crossing
several little running waters and particularly the stream running through
Princess Charlotte's Vale we made the Macquarie River 2 miles below the Pine
Hill, and then ascertained that our great anxiety to advance forward had got
the better of our reason and had driven us far too much to the eastward. We are
11 miles from the settlement. The day is well advanced, and a broken track is
before us. I endeavoured on all occasions, and more particularly during the
last 5 months, to turn such contingencies to some account. In passing through
the romantic rocky scenery at Pine Hill I furnished myself with seeds of an
<i>Acacia</i> distinct from <i>A. suaveolens</i>, of which I have never before
been able to procure seeds, although repeatedly sought for. <i>Grevillea
sericea</i>, observed at the Fish River, is here in flower, of which I gathered
specimens. <i>Dodonaea heterophylla</i>, so common on the south-westernmost
range of the hills in Australia (Macquarie Range), is here very rich in flower.
The <i>Cypress</i> of the Eastern coast crowns the summit of the hill, and
hence its name. The soil is very poor and sterile, being a course sandy
quartzose grit, in which <i>Daviesia latifolia</i> and <i>Indigofera
anstralis</i> (plants that abound here), grow very strong. We again crossed the
water of Princess Charlotte's Vale, which after many windings runs into the
river about 8 miles N.W. of the settlement, and continuing our route to a
clear, thinly wooded hill, called Mount Pleasant, at the base of which we
arrived at 4 o'clock. We had travelled 15&frac12; miles, and halted here
upwards of an hour for our packhorses, which were far behind. A slender-twigged
<i>Sida</i>, not in flower, is frequent on the immediate banks of the river and
in low swampy situations near it. <i>Casuarina</i>, as usual, is very strong on
the river bank, whose stream forms--below and about the Pine Hill--some very
fine picturesque winds over a stony bottom. Had we bore away more southerly we
should not have subjected ourselves and horses to the inconvenience of our
route being intersected by several deep gullies running into the river. At
nightfall we arrived at the settlement having travelled about 19 miles.</p>
<p>We have been absent from Bathurst 19 weeks and have in our route formed a
circle of upwards of 1,200 miles within the parallels Of 34&deg;30' and 32&deg;
S. lat: and between the meridians Of 149&deg;43'00" and 143&deg;40'00" East,
and have ascertained that the country south of the parallel Of 34&deg; and west
of the meridian of 147&deg;30' East is altogether uninhabitable and useless.[*]
We have all, Mr. Oxley excepted, walked since we left the boats in May last a
circuitous route Of 750 miles.</p>
<blockquote>[* Fortunately sheep and cattle stations have made it rich and
comparatively populous.]</blockquote>
<h4>BATHURST-RETURN TO PARRAMATTA, AUG. 30TH-SEP. 8TH, 1817</h4>
<p><i>30th. Saturday.</i> We found the sharpness of the external atmosphere
much more severe than we have experienced previously during the whole of our
tour which is accounted for by the great elevation and nakedness of the plains.
The forced march over gullies yesterday so fatigued our horses that some of
them fell beneath their loads. The horse that carried my cask of plants fell in
a swampy situation and, before the kegs could be taken up, the water had
penetrated between the staves and had slightly injured some of my specimens. I
was diligently employed in unpacking and airing my collection of plants and
seeds. Mr. Oxley wrote a letter on service to His Excellency upon the return of
the expedition.</p>
<p><i>31st. Sunday.</i> Weather as yesterday. Day fine and clear. Appearances
of a change about 10 o'clock. Wind shifted to the northward. Dark and cloudy. A
storm of hail about 5 o'clock p.m. Showery evening continues till late at
night.</p>
<p><i>1817. Sept. 1st. Monday.</i> This morning we sent off a large cart loaded
with luggage and collections on its way to Sydney. My collection of plants
forming large packages of bulk in casks, it was found impossible to carry them
on the only cart which we could procure at the plains. Rather than subject my
luggage to accident in passing rivulets, I determined to accompany the whole
myself, giving up my saddle horse to bear that part of my collection that could
not be carried by the cart. About 2 o'clock we passed Campbell's River, which
contained about 4 feet water at the ford--and which is about 9 miles distant
from the settlement. Continuing our journey to the usual halting place 5 miles
east of the river we stopped for the night. <i>Acacia vomeriformis</i> with
<i>Styphelia</i> (<i>triflora</i>) and <i>Daviesia corrymbosa</i> frequent on
the riverside. Wind bleak and cold.</p>
<p><i>2nd. Tuesday.</i> Our bullocks had strayed away from us to the Macquarie
Valley and were not found and brought back till late. We were in consequence
detained 3 hours later than we intended. At 10 o'clock we left the resting
place, travelling over a gentle hilly country covered with a species of
<i>Eucalyptus</i> with sharp lanceolate leaves, and usually called Box, from
the yellow colour of its wood. <i>Banksia compar</i> is likewise frequent, and
is continually in flower and fruit. At 9 miles we arrived at Sidmouth Valley,
where I gathered seeds of a species of <i>Veronica</i> with apposite lanceolate
leaves. <i>Lotus major</i> and other plants common to this rich vale are now
growing very fine and strong, affording excellent pasturage for the oxen and
sheep that are occasionally turned upon it. It is now very boggy and wet, and
required more than the ordinary exertions of our bullocks to draw the loaded
carts across the swamp running through it. The hills we passed for the space of
7 miles are sterile and sandy, on which I observed <i>Stylidium
grammifolium</i>, the little heterophyllous <i>Hovea</i>, and a yellow
<i>Elichrysum</i>. <i>Acacia decurrens</i> is common and is in flower, and also
<i>A. melanoxylon</i>. At 4 o'clock we descended the hill to the Fish River,
which we forded and pitched our tent on the opposite bank in the old situation.
Mr. Oxley and Mr. Evans, who had remained at Bathurst a day longer than us,
left that settlement this morning and overtook us--being on horseback--at this
river. Cold and chilling. Dull heavy weather.</p>
<p><i>3rd. Wednesday.</i> From some few observations made in the month of April
last, when encamped on this river, I am now anxious to spend a few moments on
its rocky banks while the bullocks are yoking. <i>Grevillea cinerea</i> is now
in flower, which enabled me to procure more specimens, of which I gathered some
among the rocks of Pine Hill below Bathurst. I then discovered a new
<i>Pimelea</i>, remarkable for its thick woody growth, on which, detached from
its larger foliage, it produces its flowers on long peduncles, which I am
enabled to ascertain by the remaining parts--it not being in flower at this
period.</p>
<p>The journey over Clarence's Hilly Range, which is notorious for its
difficulties when passing with loaded carts is at this period being made more
easy for man and beast. Government men are forming a new line of road in places
where the ascents and descents were short and steep or the bottoms formed by
the waters of the range had become stagnant and boggy. The new road is
generally formed round a rising point when it is safe and practicable--in place
of the old one running over its summit--so that the great horse pulls are in
great measure eased, and the swampy parts have drains cut to let off the waters
that formerly were obliged to remain for want of a declivity to carry them
off.</p>
<p>The botany of this range is by no means interesting. The timber is Blue Gum
and the lanceolate-leaved Box (an <i>Eucalyptus</i>), which is of considerable
bulk and is easily distinguished by its dark green shady foliage. I gathered
specimens of the <i>Psychotria</i> observed in April last. Several Eastern
Coast plants now begin to appear; among them <i>Daviesia latifolia</i>, which
overruns the whole; a fine Dedynamous plant, allied to <i>Buchnera</i>, with
apposite, oblong, sessile, serrulated leaves and blue flowers, is common among
the grass, with a <i>Bellis</i> having an elongated scape; and <i>Persoonia
pinifolia</i>, <i>Acacia discolor</i>, <i>Hakea daclyloides</i>, and a
<i>Bryonia</i>, are all common plants about Mount Blaxland.</p>
<p>The difficulty of the road prevented our bullock cart from arriving at Cox's
River, a distance of 16 miles, before the afternoon was far advanced. We were
therefore obliged to halt near the dep&ocirc;t on its banks for the night,
although we had hoped to have proceeded 5 miles up the Vale of Clwyd to Mount
York this day. The horse that carried part of my collection, fell in crossing
the uneven rocky bottom of Cox's River and gave me abundance of employment in
rescuing my plants from destruction. Some black crystals were found at the
bottom of the range.</p>
<p><i>4th. Thursday.</i> From our halting place on the banks of the river we
continued our route up the Vale of Clwyd 5 miles to the base of Mount York,
which we reached about midday. The timber of the Vale is chiefly stringy
bark--of the Eastern coast--of tolerable bulk. The line of road led through
several boggy wet low spots, which had ineffectually been attempted to be
improved by the aid of drains. We were obliged partly to unload the cart to
ease the bullocks in drawing it through the numerous windings of Cox's Pass up
to Mount York, an operation that consumed much time and obliged us to encamp on
the summit of the range. I observed several interesting genera in the pass in
April last, which I did not then collect but left them till my return. The
Plants are as follows:--<i>Epacris reclinata</i>, a beautiful depressed
procumbent shrub, with tubular scarlet flowers, on the bare shelving rocks. A
species of <i>Styphelia</i>, allied to <i>Leucopogon lanceolatus</i> (H.K.),
but different in having its anthera extended beyond the tube of the corolla.
<i>Azorella sp.</i>, leaves linear-lanceolate, and corymb compound.
<i>Leptospermum sp.</i>, allied to <i>L. lanigerum</i>, on exposed rocks, and
another woolly species of this genus. The <i>Epacris</i> of which I gathered
seeds in April last is now in flower. The Pass abounds with <i>Podolobium
heterophyllum</i> in flower and seeds.</p>
<p><i>5th. Friday.</i> Conformable to the instructions received by Mr. Oxley
from the Governor and agreeable to the usual form at the termination of all
expeditions, I gave (sealed up) to Mr. Oxley and Mr. Evans my memorandum for my
journals, which, with other papers they carried with them when they left me
this morning and proceeded forward with all possible despatch to Parramatta to
wait upon His Excellency. In the meantime, while our people were striking the
tent and loading the cart, I descended into the Pass and gathered specimens of
<i>Polypodium sp.</i>, a beautiful fern, on shaded rocks. I likewise gathered
seeds and specimens of a shrub of the genus <i>Tetrathera</i>, with angular,
rusty branches, distinct from <i>T. juncea</i>. The plants, as we travelled on
this range, presented to us much variety, but are for the most part well known
Eastern coast species. <i>Banksia compar</i>, which follows us from Bathurst to
the foot of the Pass is succeeded by <i>B. serrata</i>, <i>B. spinulosa</i>,
<i>B. ericaefolia</i>, etc. On the summit of Mount York these continue over the
Blue Mountains whose great sterility contributes not a little to the large
growth and luxuriance of this genus as well as others of the <i>Proteaceae</i>,
viz:--<i>Isopogon</i>, <i>Petrophila</i>, <i>Lomatia</i> and <i>Telopea</i>,
which are now very common--of the latter I gathered a quantity of its seeds.
The <i>Conospermum</i> of the environs of Sydney and Parramatta, and several
species of <i>Persoonia</i> in fruit, are very abundant. Of the
<i>Epacrideae</i>, <i>E. obtusifolia</i> and <i>E. purpurascens</i>, are
extremely ornamental on these arid heights. I gathered specimens of a species
of a <i>Staphylea</i> with obtuse oblong leaves. Of the <i>Papilionaceae</i>,
<i>Pultenaea villosa</i>, <i>P. stipularis</i>, <i>P. retusa</i>, etc., are the
most common species. <i>Platylobium formosum</i> and a new species with ovate,
reticulated, silky leaves, of weak growth are occasionally observed on the dry
sands. The <i>Stylidium</i>, so frequent when I passed in April last, is
scarcely to be traced, having ripened its seeds and died. About 10 o'clock we
arrived at Blackheath, 9 miles from Mount York, where I gathered seeds of a
specimen of <i>Eucalyptus microphylla</i>, a small tree not exceeding 14 feet
in height, forming a close brush and covering the whole of the mountains to the
eastward. The soil of the heath is sterile and sandy, and has much of
<i>Casuarina stricta</i> in a stunted state. Towards the close of the afternoon
we arrived at the (28th mile) wooden house, having travelled 21 miles, from
Mount York. A low repent reclining shrub, not in flower or fruit, with filiform
leaves, and which from its habit I suspect to be a <i>Persoonia</i>, is very
abundant in this day's stage. <i>Lambertia formosa</i> did not appear until we
had advanced several miles on our journey. Of the <i>Rutaceae</i> I gathered
some specimens of a beautiful species of <i>Boronia</i>, flowers small, leaves
pinnated and cuneated, indigenous in the neighbourhood of Port Jackson. Near
the end of this day's journey I gathered specimens of a small shrub of the
<i>Proteaceae</i>, with terminal spikes of pale yellow flowers. The stunted
timber is of <i>Eucalyptus</i>, Blue Gum and Stringy Bark. <i>Hakea
dactyloides</i> and <i>H. saligna</i> form tolerable small trees, in fruit.
<i>Xanthorrhea</i> seen in the brush.</p>
<p><i>6th. Saturday.</i> From this elevation we could clearly distinguish the
cleared cultivated lands on the banks of the Hawkesbury River. Leaving the 28th
milehouse we continued our route easterly over a barren rugged range of
mountains, the road is bounded by the same description of plants noticed in
yesterday's stage, with others extremely common at Sydney and Parramatta, such
as <i>Bossiaea scolopendria</i>, <i>B. heterophylla</i>, <i>B. microphylla</i>,
<i>Dillwynia ericifolia</i>, and <i>Xylomelum pyriforme</i>, seen not further
west than near the 27th mile mark. <i>Acacia</i>, several species;
<i>Ceratopetalum gummiferum</i>, <i>Callicoma serratifolia</i>,
<i>Eriocalia</i> [= <i>Actinotus</i>] <i>major</i> and <i>minor</i>, and among
these gathered the following plants, viz.: <i>Petrophila diversifolia</i>,
<i>Grevillea repens</i>, much allied to <i>G. Goodii</i>, but differing in
having an appressed silky pubescence on the underside of the leaf--a prostrate
plant common on the lands. <i>Persoonia oleifolia</i>, a species that may range
near <i>P. flexifolia</i>, it produces orange flowers, and is now in fruit.
<i>P. microcarpa</i>, a tall shrub, frequent near Caley's Repulse. <i>P.
sp.</i>, much allied to <i>P. mollis</i>, <i>Zieria revoluta</i>. <i>Persoonia
abietina</i> [= <i>curvifolia</i>] a species appearing to be new; leaves
linear, channelled and incurved; in fruit. <i>Styphelia sp.</i> (closely allied
to <i>S. reflexa</i> of Rudge), having a much longer style and mucron to the
apex of leaf. <i>Styphelia sp.</i>, perhaps <i>S. reflexa</i>, above referred
to. <i>Imbricaria sp.</i>, a dwarf shrubby plant. <i>Boronia triphylla</i>, and
<i>B. heterophylla</i>, which differs from <i>B. pinnata</i> in its ovate
leaves, and from <i>B. alata</i> of Dr. Smith, discovered on the western coast,
in being a smooth shrub. <i>Weinmannia sp.</i>, a shrub, common in shaded
situations in ravines not far distant from Mount Banks. <i>Eriostemon sp.</i>,
leaves narrow, elongated, cuneated, tuberculated; flowers axillary and
solitary. <i>Podolobium heterophyllum</i>. <i>Pultenaea scabra</i> (H.K.).
<i>Daviesia squarrosa</i> of Dr. Smith. <i>Hibbertia glandulosa</i>.
<i>Platylobium reticulatum</i>. <i>Thelymitra ixioides</i>, and <i>Diuris
maculata</i>, in grassy and sandy situations. <i>Zieria sp.</i>, allied to
<i>Z. pilosa</i>. <i>Acacia pugioniformis</i>, a rigid shrub, the seeds of
which were sent home by the "Kangaroo" brig in April last. This is justly
considered the most rugged and oppressive stage of the whole journey to
Bathurst, on account of the sandstone rocks on which the road is formed. The
Government carters, who frequently travel to the settlement at the plains,
generally pursue a small circuitous route in the brush to avoid the joltings of
the increased descents, particularly at a spot called the "Twenty Mile Hollow."
About 4 o'clock we arrived at the dep&ocirc;t at Springwood and halted for the
day. The <i>Telopea</i> is very beautifully bursting into flower, whose
brilliant red appearance may be easily traced down the declivities of the deep
ravines shining through the foliage of other plants. The day continues
fine.</p>
<p><i>7th. Sunday.</i> We left Springwood about 8 o'clock in order to cross the
Nepean River about 10 o'clock. In our road I gathered the following
specimens:--<i>Acacia leptophylla</i>, allied to <i>A. suaveolens</i>.
<i>Dodonea filiformis</i>. <i>Pultenaea sp.</i>, allied to <i>P.
stenophylla</i>, and a delicate plant of the <i>Orchidaceae</i>, <i>Serapias
reflexa</i>? leaves scented like the Tonquin Bean. <i>Leptomeria</i>.
<i>Thesium drupaceum</i> or native currant, in flower. About noon we crossed
the river at the Ferry and halted for the day at the Dep&ocirc;t, one mile from
the river.</p>
<p><i>8th. Monday.</i> The tediousness of this day's stage to Parramatta (being
20 miles) was relieved by a few plants presenting themselves in flower, which
furnished me with some fine specimens viz.:--<i>Grevillea juniperina</i>, a
weak reclining villose shrub, with red flowers. <i>Cryptandra sp.</i>, a thorny
shrub of much the same habit as the preceding, with crowded obovate-spathulate
leaves, and the lobes of the corolla acute. <i>Commersonia echinata</i>, common
in N.S. Wales. <i>Prostanthera sp.</i>, leaves lanceolate, with revolute
margins; flowers axillary and solitary (habit of <i>Westringia</i>). <i>Aster
aculeatus</i> of Labillardi&egrave;re, fine in flower. I arrived at Parramatta
at dusk with the whole of our collection, having been absent on this expedition
from this place about 23 weeks.</p>
<h4>PARRAMATTA AND VICINITY, 9 SEPTEMBER-20 DECEMBER, 1817</h4>
<p><i>9th. Tuesday.</i> This morning I waited upon His Excellency the Governor
in order to report my arrival here, who congratulated me, in common with the
rest of our party, upon my safe return and presented me with letters from the
Right Hon. Sir Joseph Banks, of dates 10th and 13th February. The Governor
suggested that he had received instructions to fit out a naval expedition to
survey the north and northwest coasts, under the command of Lieutenant P. King
(son of the late Governor), who had recently arrived, and the letters he had
presented to me contained instructions from home directing me to join Mr. King.
Dined with the Governor in the evening. Upon perusing Sir J. Banks' letters, I
find they contained his commands to that effect. As there are no vessels here
at present suitable for such an enterprise the Governor, who is instructed to
purchase one, is of the opinion that it could not be fitted out before the
beginning of the year, so that sufficient time will be given me to prepare my
collection and write forward my journal relative to the late expedition into
the Western interior.</p>
<hr width="30%" align="center">
<p><i>17th. Wednesday</i>. I waited this morning upon His Excellency, to
request that the packet of memoranda for the journal (which I had delivered
into the hands of John Oxley Esqre. the chief of the late expedition) might be
returned to me as early as convenient to enable me to arrange my collection of
plants in good time to be shipped on board the "Harriet" brig, bound hence to
the Cape, and from thence direct to England, which vessel is expected to sail
in about 8 weeks. Received the journals and dined at Government House in the
evening.</p>
<p><i>18th. Thursday.</i> The Superintendent of Government stock having
demanded of me the horse, which had been furnished me to assist in the
conveyance of my collection found during the last expedition over the
mountains, I wrote a letter to His Excellency upon the subject begging as a
Government indulgence he would grant me an order warranting me to retain the
horse, which I have now for the first time in my possession, in order to afford
me that assistance which the nature of my distant botanical pursuits required.
This afternoon I received His Excellency's answer stating that he very much
regretted that he could not, consistently with the nature of his instructions
from home, comply with my request. That it was a sort of indulgence even
refused to surveyors and medical officers of the Government, where various
public duties frequently required the use of a horse, and he concluded with
observing that were this indulgence extended to me "they would have reason to
complain of so mortifying distinction." Although I should not immediately stand
in need of a horse, still I am well aware of the difficulty existing in
obtaining any assistance of this nature from the Government (or from the
Governor) when I might require it, and hence I was determined to avail myself
of this apparent favourable opportunity by applying in a regular manner to the
Governor. I returned the horse forthwith without delay of time, and occupied
myself at my specimens.</p>
<p><i>19th. Friday.</i> It having been intimated to me that the "Matilda" and
"Lloyd" transports, having troops on board, were expected to sail from this
port on Sunday, I wrote to the Right Hon. Sir J. Banks and W. T. Aiton, Esqr.,
by way of India, informing them of my return from the late Western
Expedition...</p>
<p><i>23rd. Tuesday.</i> Occupied at my specimens. Visited by Philip King,
Esq., with whom I had a slight interview upon the subject of the voyage of
discovery now in contemplation. The colonial vessel "Lady Nelson," being the
only ship now in harbour suitable for such an expedition, has been taken up for
this service and is about to undergo a thorough repair.</p>
<hr width="30%" align="center">
<p><i>3rd October. Friday.</i> Having heard of the arrival of the "Lord Eldon"
(Captn. Lamb) I went to Sydney in hopes of receiving letters by her, I found,
however, that this ship had sailed from England prior to the "Lloyd" and "Dick"
which had brought me letters from Sir Joseph Banks. Many interesting plants
were in flowering state by the wayside, of which the following are the most
remarkable, and have afforded me no opportunity of examining them previously.
<i>Comesperma volubile</i>, rich in flower, meandering its slender branches on
erect shrubs. <i>Prostanthera sp.</i>, and <i>Xanthosia pilosa</i> (Rudge).
<i>Sphaerolobium vimineum</i>, remarkable for the singular formation of its
style. <i>Pomaderris ferruginea</i>, a small <i>Phyllanthus</i>, and
<i>Patersonia sericea</i>, the seeds of which I sent to England per the
"Kangaroo." <i>Stylidium graminifolium</i>; some <i>Orchidaceae</i>, such as
<i>Thelymitra</i> and <i>Diuris</i> were fast advancing to flower.
<i>Tetratheca glandulosa</i> is now no mean ornament on the wayside, being
thickly clothed with its rich purple flowers. Returned in the evening to
Parramatta.</p>
<hr width="30%" align="center">
<p><i>22nd. Wednesday.</i> At the invitation of a friend I went out to his farm
near Liverpool, which gave me an opportunity of examining the botanical
productions of some sterile land on the verge of his estate. I discovered a
beautiful species of <i>Stylidium</i>, leaves linear, revolute; spike
elongated, branching, bracts ovate lanceolate, suffruticose. <i>Daviesia
corymbosa</i>, very frequent in the forest land, in flower. In clear waterholes
I observed <i>Actinocarpus sp.</i>, in fruit, appearing larger than the plant
discovered on the Lachlan River in May last: also another aquatic, flowers
spiked, one of the <i>Alismaceae</i>. In the forest land I gathered seeds of a
<i>Helichrysum</i>, leaves linear, flowers white. Like other farms in the
neighbourhood it is overrun with the <i>Bursaria spinosa</i>, now in fruit.
Returned to Parramatta in the evening.</p>
<hr width="30%" align="center">
<p><i>Nov. 14th</i>. Friday. Finished seed and specimen list. Copying journal.
Received the information that the "Mermaid" cutter would be ready for sea about
the 1st of next month. She is now fitting out for Mr. King's Expedition to the
N. and N.W. coasts...Made arrangements relative for mess on intending
voyage.</p>
<p><i>Dec. 1st. Monday.</i> Waited upon Lieutenant King to ascertain if any day
had been definitely fixed for the sailing of the cutter on the voyage of
discovery. He spoke in an equivocal manner of sailing in 10 days.</p>
<p><i>2nd. Tuesday.</i> This morning I waited upon His Excellency, according to
appointment, in order to superintend the execution of a few drawings of plants
discovered in the interior, which the Governor intends to transmit to Earl
Bathurst.</p>
<hr width="30%" align="center">
<p><i>15th. Monday to 20th. Saturday.</i> The whole of this week was occupied
with several arrangements necessary to be made for my voyage on board H.M.
Cutter "Mermaid" which was reported ready for sea last Saturday, and Wednesday
was fixed for the departure of the vessel. In consequence I shipped on board
the whole of my luggage on the 16th. I likewise waited upon His Excellency to
pay my humble respects and take my leave of him previous to my departure from
the colony on a voyage of discovery under the direction of Mr. King. On this
occasion the Governor availed himself of the opportunity and asked me whether I
was satisfied with the assistance he had offered me during my residence in the
colony. I thanked him for that species of indulgence. His Excellency has
afforded me assistance by placing myself and a Government servant on the
stores, by which means a ration of beef and wheat was advanced me weekly. I
observed that I had hoped to have been provided with a small house or hut, a
Government horse, and other little assistance that would have prevented a part
of that expenditure on my part which has actually and unavoidably existed. His
Excellency hinted to me that his instructions referring to me were in the most
common and general terms, and that the indulgences I did enjoy were afforded me
more from a favourable impression he had received of me upon my first arrival
in the colony, than from any particular commands from home. His Excellency
finally concluded by charging me with having written to Sir Joseph Banks
against himself upon this subject, and that he had obtained his information
from very good authority. I attempted (with becoming respect on my part) to
explain the subject of my letters, that it was by no means intended as an
accusation or charge against himself, but simply a communication to Sir Joseph
Banks, whereby it will be seen how far those store indulgences and other aids
are calculated to render my expenses in this colony lighter than they were in
South America, where I purchased every necessary. His Excellency left me
abruptly, and I returned to a temporary lodging I had taken until I sailed,
determined to write another letter to Sir J. Banks, stating this interview and
its result, doubting not that His Excellency would likewise write to my Patron
on this subject. The sailing of the "Mermaid" is postponed until the 21st
inst.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER IX</h3>
<h4>CUNNINGHAM'S JOURNAL</h4>
<h4>KING'S WEST COAST VOYAGE</h4>
<p>Departure from Port Jackson on board H.M. Cutter "Mermaid" on a voyage of
discovery on the N. and N.W. Coasts of Australia, under the direction of P. P.
King, Esq., Lieut. and Commander.</p>
<hr width="30%" align="center">
<p><i>Dec. 1817. 21st. Sunday.</i> Cloudy but fair. This morning I sailed from
Sydney Cove agreeable to instructions from Sir Joseph Banks. Cleared the heads
of Port Jackson harbour in order to stand out to sea, but was obliged to return
in consequence of foul winds. Came to an anchor in Camp Cove, within the heads,
in about 5 fms. water. The individuals on board H.M. Cutter "Mermaid" engaged
in this service under the command of Lieut. P. P. King are his two officers,
Mr. Bedwell and Mr. Roe,[*] myself, twelve able seamen, two boys and Bongaree,
a chief of natives of a tribe of Broken Bay, who accompanied Captain Flinders
in the "Investigator", and who was taken on this voyage at his own particular
request.</p>
<blockquote>[* Frederick Bedwell and John Septimus Roe. The "Mermaid" was of
eighty-four tons burthen.]</blockquote>
<p><i>22nd. Monday.</i> We got under way about 6 a.m. and stood out to sea. The
"Harriet," which had sailed from Sydney Cove on her voyage to England, passed
us under our lee with a heavy press of sail.</p>

<h4>CAPTAIN PHILLIP PARKER KING</h4>
</center>
<p><i>26th. Friday.</i> We bore up N.N.E. yesterday and headed in for land. We
made Green Cape, entered Twofold Bay and anchored about 11 o'clock in Snug
Cove, being completely landlocked. I landed with Mr. King, and on the slopes of
the hills I gathered specimens of a <i>Stylidium</i> with broad lanceolate
radical leaves. A plant with the largest foliage of this genus I have seen,
scape and spike glandulously haired. <i>Lomatia sp.</i> or a variety of <i>L.
polymorpha</i> of Mr. Brown; <i>Trachymene sp.</i> (= <i>Azorella</i>,
<i>Labill</i>); a syngenesious plant; Cacalia (<i>Senecio</i>), with obovate
wedge-shaped leaves, white beneath, and flowers in corymbs; <i>Goodenia
sp.</i>, a shrub of irregular growth, leaves elliptical-obovate-oblong, smooth,
flowers axillary.</p>
<p>On the immediate shores in confined wooded situations I observed a
<i>Melaleuca</i> appearing distinct from <i>M. armillaris</i>. I gathered
specimens of <i>Myoporum sp.</i> agreeing with <i>M. ellipticum</i>, but leaves
rather more acute. Many Port Jackson plants present themselves, but none so
remarkable as a <i>Pittosporum</i>, at this period in fruit. It forms a tree
21-25 feet high and about 14-15 inches diameter.</p>
<p>The fresh water is procured from a low swamp formed by rains from the hills
finding there a lodgement, and although of no great depth (and hence the
operation of filling casks tedious) it is of good quality. Its surface is
covered with <i>Azolla</i>, and <i>Menyanthes exaltata</i> was growing in it in
great luxuriance. On the boggy land near this water place I detected a very
long-leaved <i>Dianella</i>, and flowering specimens of a species of
<i>Veronica</i> with a compound spike of white flowers, which I discovered
first in the Western Interior on the Fish River and margins of creeks running
into the Macquarie River. The wooded slopes and higher lands, covered with
<i>Eucalypti</i> and <i>Casuarina stricta</i>, are of a good rich soil, which
is abundantly indicated by the luxuriance of the herbage and strength and
height of its grasses. The beach has <i>Pelargonium australe</i> and some
<i>Atriplicinae</i>, as also a small <i>Casuarina</i> in fruit, of which I
gathered specimens, with the seeds of an <i>Acaena</i>. <i>Zieria revoluta</i>,
a species discovered at View Rocks at the extremity of plains beyond Bathurst,
I have observed accompanying <i>Aster dentatus</i> [= <i>Olearia dentata</i>]
on the sides of the hills. Distant smokes ascending over the trees indicated
natives, and towards evening, whilst our people were hauling the seine, some
natives came down from the wooded lands to the watering place, but made a
precipitate retreat upon finding they were noticed. The lat. of the anchorage
is about 37&deg;04'30" S_ and long. 150&deg;04'00" E.</p>
<p><i>27th. Saturday.</i> On the return of the jolly boat, which had been sent
on shore for a few more barecas (breakers) of water, we got under way with a
favourable wind. As we were rounding Haycock Point (of Flinders) we noticed
several natives on the high grassy banks, who hailed us, making many ludicrous
challenging grimaces as we passed. The shores southerly are spacious, and the
sterile hills of deep white drift sand from Cape Howe towards the Ram's Head
are clothed with small low dense bushes. The distant background is well wooded
mountains and irregular presenting points, bearings of which were taken.</p>
<p><i>28th. Dec. 1817 to 15th Jan. 1818.</i> Between the spaces of 19 days we
had frequently much bad squally weather, which opposed us very considerably as
we passed through Bass Strait on the 3rd of January. We found on the 15th we
were drawing near the land on the south coast[*] called the Archipelago of the
Recherche, but nothing could be distinguished from the masthead and no
soundings were obtained in 80 fms.</p>
<p><i>Friday, January 16th. 1818.</i> At 5 a.m. we saw the S.E. islands of the
Archipelago, and the wind being at S.W. Mr. King determined to anchor for a few
hours under the lee of Middle Island until the wind became fair, which we
accordingly did, abreast a sandy beach within a half a mile of the shore. It
was late in the afternoon before we anchored, and about an hour before dusk,
affording me some time to observe the botany of the sandy shores of the island.
I gladly accompanied Mr. King and his 2nd officer Mr. Roe to the beach. The
vegetable kingdom here has a very distinct character from that of the East
coast, and it was with very much pleasure I noticed plants that I had
previously only seen in a cultivated state. <i>Stylidium fruticosum</i> is
frequent in quartzose rocky situations, at this time not in flower or capsule;
<i>Scottea</i> (= <i>Bossiaea</i>) <i>dentata</i>, with the preceding, forming
a handsome dense shrub. On the shores and sterile sandy hills I gathered the
following specimens. <i>Pimelea sp.</i>, leaves ovate-lanceolate, alternate,
capitulum small conical, calyx woolly on its exterior. <i>Polygonum sp.</i>,
leaves cordate, undulately curved, 3-nerved, stem fruticose, twining, flowers
axillary. <i>Ceanothus sp.</i>, leaves ovate, entire, hoary beneath; flowers in
terminal racemes; a shrub 6-8 ft. high. <i>Baeckia sp.</i>, leaves linear,
flowers clustered, axillary, solitary. <i>Malaleuca sp.</i>, a shrub in fruit.
<i>Atriplicinae</i>, a procumbent reclining shrub with a terminal spreading
panicle, in fruit. <i>Westringia sp.</i>, appears to be the <i>W. Dampieri</i>
of Mr. Brown, afforded me a few seeds. I gathered seeds of an Acacia, forming a
close bushy plant, with narrow lanceolate leaves.</p>
<blockquote>[* Of Western Australia,]</blockquote>
<p>No marks or signs of natives appeared, but we observed numerous impressions
of the smaller kangaroo on the higher grassy parts of the island, as well as
several deserted nests of sea fowl. At 8 o'clock p.m. we all returned on board
in the jolly boat. No fresh water was found on this island.</p>
<p><i>17th. Saturday.</i> At 4 a.m. we got under way, with a fair wind and
stood a course direct for King George's Sound under a heavy press of sail.</p>
<h4>KING GEORGE'S SOUND AND OYSTER HARBOUR, 20-31 JANUARY, 1818</h4>
<p><i>20th. Tuesday.</i> This morning our course for the land was E. to E. by
S. and we got soundings in 38 fms. At noon the haze cleared off and we entered
King George's Sound. Doubling Bald Head we anchored for the night off a white
shore bounded by a very remarkable ridge of sand,[*] and Mr. King proposing a
visit to Seal Island (bearing E. by N. about 1&frac12; miles from us) I joined
him in the boat with Mr. Bedwell, our first officer. In consequence of the
heavy surf rolling in from the open sea against this rocky island, it was not
without some difficulty we landed on its lee side. Several seals of a large
size were asleep on those parts of the rocks near the water's edge and, with
others which were ambling among the brushwood on the higher parts of the
island, they made a precipitate retreat headlong into the sea on being
disturbed, with the exception of one which was killed with clubs, and proving
to be of the hair kind was nothing worth.</p>
<blockquote>[* "Between Seal Island and the first sandy
beach."--King.]</blockquote>
<p>The plants on this naked granite rock are very inconsiderable. An ornamental
plant called <i>Candollea cuneformis</i>, of Labillardi&egrave;re, is the most
conspicuous; it was in flower, and I gathered with it the following species.
<i>Lavatera sp.</i>, flowers axillary, white. <i>Lobelia sp.</i>, leaves ovate,
glossy; flowers, solitary and small. This plant is abundant beneath large
stones and under the immediate shade of rocks. The shrub of the
<i>Atriplicinae</i> noticed at Middle Island, from its density, affords a
comfortable refuge and habitation to a small blue-backed penguin, of which our
people secured several, with some gulls. The bottle left by Captain Flinders
was not found, but the square bottom of a case bottle was picked up;[*] from
which circumstance it may be inferred that subsequent vessels might have
touched here, and landing upon the island had destroyed it. We quitted the
island and returned to the cutter, and thence landed on the sandy western shore
near our anchorage. We ascended to the summit of the deep loose sandy ridge,
and from there we had a good view of the sea to the southward and westward and
of Vancouver's Breakers. A <i>Scaevola</i>, with oblong serrulated leaves and
elongated terminal spike of blue flowers, grew extremely strongly and luxuriant
on these and slopes, with <i>Pimelea decussata</i> (= <i>ferruginea</i>),
having the habit of <i>P. nivea</i>, and the following interesting plants
covered the sides of the ridge. <i>Adenanthos sericea</i> in flower, a large
close shrub. <i>Malaleuca sp.</i>, leaves linear, rigid, roundish, sulcated.
Several shrubs of the <i>Epacrideeae</i>, but not in flower. <i>Acacia
biflora</i> (H.K.), some <i>Gnaphalia</i>, and a <i>Trachymene</i> with remains
of flowers, probably the <i>Azorella compressa</i> of Labill.</p>
<blockquote>[* Left on the island by Lieutenant Forster of H.M.S. "Emu" in
1815.]</blockquote>
<p>We found some shells on the highest part of this sandy ridge, and in our
descent, knee deep in the sand, we picked up specimens of the petrified
branches of trees, observed before by Captain Flinders, which were light and
sonorous when struck against each other. It was dark when we left this beach
for the cutter, on board of which we arrived at 8 p.m.</p>
<p><i>1st. Wednesday.</i> We weighed, and stood over to the entrance of Oyster
Harbour, and, having previously sent a whaleboat into the narrow rocky channel
to sound, we entered through the mouth of the harbour and anchored near the
shore in 5 fms. It was early in the afternoon when I landed with Mr. King, who
was anxious to take in as much water and wood as our small vessel could well
stow. An old well was found nearly filled upon the beach, which our people
opened and enlarged, and the water that oozed through the ground soon afforded
us an ample supply of a deep colour but good quality. Aware that our stay here
would be but short I was the more anxious to employ my time as profitably as
possible.</p>
<p>On the barren, dry, stony hills and grounds rising from the beach <i>Banksia
grandis</i> arrests the attention of the collector more particularly than any
of its kindred indigenous around it. It forms a small tree of irregular growth,
is very abundant, and at this season is in flower and young fruit. <i>B.
marcescens</i> and <i>B. attenuata</i>; <i>Dryandra armata</i>, fruit and
flowering state; and <i>D. nivea</i>, I noticed in these exposed sterile spots.
Of the <i>Proteaceae</i> I gathered 5 specimens; they were of several of its
established genera--<i>Petrophila rigida</i>, and a shrub of like stiff habit,
which I suspect is Mr. Brown's <i>Isopogon attenuatus</i>, <i>Adenanthos
cuneata</i>, a large silky shrub, near the shore. <i>Hakea oleifolia</i> and
<i>H. linearis</i>, in partly humid situations on the hills, <i>Dasypogon
bromeliaefolius</i>, a suffruticose plant with a globular head of flowers and
rough foliage, furnished me with seeds and flowering specimens. An
<i>Oxylobium</i> is at this time in flower and fruit and decorates the brush on
the sands of the immediate beach. <i>Jacksonia spinosa</i> was also in flower,
of which, I gathered a few seeds.</p>
<p>Other specimens I collected this morning were the following. <i>Leptospermum
linearifolium</i>, tree 12-14 feet high, with pendulous branches, on the
immediate shores. <i>Hibbertia perfoliata</i>, a feeble shrubby plant, in humid
peaty places near the watering place. <i>Baeckia speciosa</i>, a beautiful,
delicate plant. <i>Epacris sp.</i>, with large white flowers and attenuated
leaves, in similar situations; and a species of <i>Tremandra</i>, a genus
allied to <i>Tetratheca</i>, whose purple flowers were particularly conspicuous
among the grass and herbage near the well of water. <i>Anigozanthos flavida</i>
is of most luxuriant growth in the deeper peaty spots, where the overhanging
branches of <i>Banksia attenuata</i> protect and shade it from the more
immediate rays of the sun. I gathered its seeds.</p>
<p>The stunted timber trees of these hills are of the <i>Eucalypti</i>, of
which I have not seen any flowering specimens. Having returned to the vessel
and taken care of the specimens collected, I accompanied Mr. King to an island
in the harbour (the Gardener's Green Island of Captain Vancouver). We could not
discover any trace of vegetables that might have been produced from the seeds
sown by that navigator. The island in many parts abounds with rats, which might
have (long since) destroyed any vegetables raised thus; and their deep burrows
in the hollow soil render walking upon it somewhat difficult. The
<i>Rhagodia</i>, a plant of the <i>Atriplicinae</i>, of Seal and Middle
Islands, abounds here in fruit. I circumambulated the island while Mr. King was
occupied in his observations, but made no discoveries in botany. A
<i>Salicornia</i> and a <i>Mesembryanthemum</i>, perhaps the <i>M.
glaucescens</i> of Haworth, with purple flowers, prevail on its shores, as they
do on some parts of the mainland. Of the genus <i>Xanthorrhea</i> I have this
day noticed 3 if not 4 species, but none in flower. I gathered seeds of a
species with an arbusculous caudex, the plant observed by Mr. Brown in 1801,
having the caudex and foliage of the arborescent <i>Xanthorrhea</i>, but with a
different inflorescence. It would appear that the end of March and the
beginning of April is the season of flowering of this very remarkable
plant.</p>
<p><i>22nd. Thursday.</i> Early this morning several of our people were sent to
the flats, where they procured quantities of fine large oysters and fair
mussels at low water. I landed with an intention to spend the whole of the day
on and about the shores on the west side of the sound. Mr. King and one of his
officers were fully occupied, with all the hands that could be spared from the
duty of the vessel, on the opposite shores at the wooding place, in measuring a
base line for a survey of Oyster Harbour. Tracing the sandy beach to the foot
of the hills I found many of the plants I had noticed yesterday, with other
well-known species, viz:--<i>Dryandra plumosa</i>, <i>Hakea prostrata</i> (=
<i>glabella</i>), <i>H. florida</i>, also <i>Acacia alata</i> and <i>A.
pulchella</i>, of the latter I gathered seeds, with another species having
simple, linear, angular, mucronated leaves and twisted pods.</p>
<p>The rocky shores abound with a blue-flowered <i>Billardiera</i>, probably
<i>B. fusiformis</i>, and with it <i>Myoporum appositifolium</i> afforded me
specimens for examination. On the hills I gathered specimens in fruit of two
species of <i>Eucalyptus</i>, the one with very large capsules, and the other
with fruit smaller and hemispherical, forming trees 12-16 feet high; they were
the same species as those observed yesterday on the opposite shores,
<i>Melaleuca sp.</i>, in fruit, allied to <i>M. gibbosa</i>. <i>Pimelea
sp.</i>, leaves ovate-lanceolate; calyx pubescent and villose outside.
<i>Dodecandria</i>, a stunted shrubby plant. I gathered seeds of a specimen of
<i>Patersonia</i>, the leaves of which are woody inside, and a twining plant of
the <i>Asphodeleae</i>, of the habit of <i>Eustrephus</i>.</p>
<p>About 4 o'clock I returned to the vessel, having made a circuitous round of
several miles with little success. I had observed on the Eastern shores, as we
passed in the vessel, a remarkable tree on the hills, whose profusion of orange
flowers rendered it very conspicuous, and this afternoon I landed to discover
what it was and to collect specimens of it. To my surprise I found the shrub I
was in search of was a <i>Loranthus</i>, and the more remarkable as it is
arborescent and terrestrial, so contrary to the usual habits of this
parasitical genus. Its flowers are generally hexandrous. This species appears
to be the <i>L. floribundus</i> of Labillardi&egrave;re. I have traced a
considerable analogy between some American species of this genus and those of
genera of <i>Proteaceae</i> indigenous on this coast, particularly of some
species of <i>Hakea</i>, in the pale colour and diversified shape of foliage,
with the corolla not very unlike the long calyx of <i>Adenanthus</i> and the
remarkable insertion of the stamina on or near the apices of the petals. In
<i>Loranthus</i> may be one proof of its near relation to this extensive
Australian family, which had been already suggested by a very eminent botanist.
In returning along the rocky shore I gathered specimens of a glutinous shrub of
the class <i>Didynamia</i>, a species of <i>Anthocercis</i> with large white
flowers; the whole plant is extremely viscid and very graveolent. The
<i>Mesembryantheum</i> noticed yesterday being in fruit on the sandy shore I
gathered ripe seeds of it. Having occasion to ascend over some fragments of
rocks and loose stones, I discovered this afternoon a large nest of very small
concavity, built on the summit of an elevated rock 30 or 35 feet high,
perpendicular on all sides and hence inaccessible to the emu by which I had
suspected it to have been formed. It was deserted and old and might have
belonged to the eagle family.</p>
<p><i>23rd. Friday.</i> Occupied some time in the shifting of my plants. About
10 o'clock I landed and employed myself on the east and north east shores of
Oyster Harbour, where I gathered the following specimens:--<i>Patersonia
sp.</i>, leaves long and narrow; seeds large and glossy. <i>Lobelia sp.</i>,
larger than <i>L. alata</i>, flowers blue. <i>Haemodorum</i>, spike elongated,
and another species with spreading panicle. These grew in a black peaty soil,
generally beneath the shade of trees, particularly <i>Banksia attenuata</i>,
whose stems, although short, were 24-30 inches in diameter, and at this time in
flower and young fruit. On the immediate shores and sides of the hills I
gathered <i>Comesperma virgatum</i> (Labill). <i>Olax sp.</i>, a slender shrub,
with small, solitary, white flowers. This plant agrees in habit with
<i>Spermaxyrum phyllanthi</i> of Labill., and may be the plant he has figured.
<i>Scaevola sp.</i>, allied to <i>S. crassifolia</i>, corolla very woody
outside. <i>Epacris sp.</i>, a shrub of low stature, on the sandy shores.
<i>Styphelia sp.</i>, leaves cordate; flowers small; in dry rocky situations.
<i>Xerotes sp.</i>, with <i>Gompholobium tomentosum</i>, in shady peaty spots.
On the sides of the hills in exposed situations I gathered specimens of a
<i>Stylidium</i> clearly allied to <i>Candollea glauca</i>. <i>Lasiopetalum
purpureum</i> and <i>Acacia ciliata</i> were but just past a flowering state,
on the rocky, sandy shores. Toward the close of the afternoon I returned on
board, having made no further discoveries in botany. The small flies were
becoming exceedingly troublesome on board as well as on shore.</p>
<p><i>24th. Saturday.</i> Every person fully employed in wooding, or in the
necessary duties of the vessel, or engaged with Mr. King's party on shore. And
such was our shortness of hands that it would have occasioned Mr. King much
inconvenience had he allowed me one or two seamen, at my request, to accompany
me in this day's distant research, for protection and assistance. Taking my gun
with me I left the cutter with an intention to visit as much of the west and
north west sides of Oyster Harbour as the day would admit, passing over
considerable downs of land, whose point or cape forms a species of promontory
between the Sound and the harbour in which we are at anchor, I observed some
aged specimens of <i>Dryandra cuneata</i> advancing to a flowering state. It
rises to a tree of rugged, irregular growth 14-16 feet in height, with
<i>Banksia quercifolia</i>, a shrub in young fruit. In some boggy hollows near
these extensive sands, occasionally inundated by the sea, I gathered specimens
of <i>Scaevola sp.</i>, leaves linear, short; a shrubby plant. An <i>Aster</i>
with small oblong linear leaves; flowers terminal, hoary, solitary. A genus
intermediate between Westringia and Satureia, leaves ternate, lanceolate,
obtuse, upper lamina of corolla villous; a shrubby plant. <i>Stylidium
glaucum</i>, this appears to be <i>Candollea glauca</i>, Labill., and is easily
distinguished from the plant gathered yesterday by its more attentuated growth
and slender smooth spike of flowers.</p>
<p>Avoiding a tract of brushwood on the skirts of the harbour, which had lately
been fired by the natives and hence could afford me nothing, I stretched over
the shelly flats, being low water, to Bayonet Point of Captain Flinders, a
remarkable elevated angle of the harbour, on and in the vicinity of which I
procured the following interesting specimens:--<i>Petrophila fastigiata</i>,
<i>Br.</i>; <i>Anadenia pulchella</i>, a rigid shrubby plant, remarkable for
its glutinous follicles; <i>Adenanthos obovata</i>, a twiggy shrub with red
flowers; <i>Hakea ellipitica</i>, specimens in fruit; <i>Hakea
ceratophylla</i>; <i>Persoonia longifolia</i>, leaves elongated, linear and
falcated; <i>Persoonia articulata</i>, with the preceding; <i>Conospermum
coruleum</i>, of tufted growth. The summit of this point abounds in the
beautiful plant named <i>Beaufortia sparsa</i>, in flower with others of the
<i>Melaleucae</i>, particularly <i>Melaleuca stiata</i> and M. thymoides,
described by Labillardi&egrave;re. The latter has small capitula of flowers
yellow. <i>Casuarina nana</i>, a dwarf, stubby shrub.</p>
<p>On the immediate shores a very remarkable species of <i>Daviesia</i>,
forming a shrub about 5-6 feet high, is by no means common. Another specimen
<i>D. flexuosa</i>, branches zigzag, spinescent, the strophiola of the seed
bilobed. I gathered a few seeds of a <i>Gompholobium</i>, whose legumen is very
large, a dwarf shrub. <i>Kennedya sp.</i>, leaves ternate, ovate, hoary. A
<i>Myoporum</i> allied to <i>M. viscosum</i>, but distinct in having
ovate-lanceolate acute leaves, and glandless peduncles, I found growing on the
rocky beach in flower and fruit. The soil of Bayonet Point is of a red, dry,
sandy nature, with a very small proportion of loam. The wind at S.W. was very
strong about 3 o'clock and, the country in that direction being in flames, the
Sound was completely enveloped in smoke from that quarter. I returned on board
at the close of the afternoon, and having placed my plants out of danger I
accompanied Mr. King to the rock where I had discovered the large nest. The
country is now in flames around us in various patches, but none of us have seen
any of the natives, although no doubt they are watching our movements.</p>
<p><i>Sunday.</i> As the French Commander Baudin[*] and Captain Flinders lay
down in their charts a river having its embouchure at the bottom of Oyster
Harbour, Mr. King proposed a boat excursion up it in order to ascertain its
course, depth, width and soundings, with the general character of the land on
its banks. Having attended to all my plants that required it I joined the party
consisting of Mr. King, Mr. Bedwell, our friend Bongaree, the native, and four
able hands. Our course to the supposed river's mouth, as laid down on the
charts, was much impeded by the flats in Oyster Harbour, over which in some
places we had scarcely water to float us over. Working into the deep water, we
ran down to the extremes of the harbour into a narrow bend, which we supposed
to be the river we were in quest of, but soon found our mistake by shoaling our
water to 3 feet. Clearing this bight for the deep water and trending easterly
Mr. King took several bearings of our situation and then stood in for the
shore, when, upon closing with the land, we found the mouth of the river which
we entered. It might be 250 yards wide, although very shallow, 6-9 feet deep,
but advancing we got 2 fathoms, and a width from 100-60 yards. The windings are
not abrupt or numerous, but easy, the banks are elevated, sloping and grassy.
The river abounds in waterfowl of various descriptions, but none were shot.
About 3 a.m., having advanced about 4&frac14; miles up the river, we stopped
and landed on its left bank in order to take some refreshment.</p>
<blockquote>[* Rivi&egrave;re de Franc_ais of Baudin.]</blockquote>
<p>While our people were lighting a fire I took a range in these sandy woods
and detected the following plants:--<i>Billardiera sp.</i>, flowers terminal
clustered, leaves ovately lanceolate, undulate, stem subvolubilous (rather
twining). <i>Trackymene compressa</i> (<i>Azorella compressa</i>, Labill:) a
small weak alated plant. <i>Dasypogon bromeliaefolius</i> was very abundant and
strong on the banks.</p>
<p>Previous to embarking in the boat I left a few peach stones in the best spot
these banks would afford me as an indication to future navigators that this
river had been visited. Its inclination was from the N.E. Pushing off, we
descended this river, and after grinding over beds of oyster shells in the
flats of the harbour we arrived at the cutter at dusk. This river doubtless
receives much fresh water in the rainy seasons as well from the interior as
from the hills bounding it. The tributary streamlets being conveyed into it by
the small creeks we noticed as we sailed up it. On the flats in the harbour our
native chief caught us a large fish weighing 22&frac12; Ibs.</p>
<p><i>26th. Monday.</i> Shifting my plants till 8 a.m. and afterwards on shore
with Mr. King, who was desirous of taking some necessary bearings from the
highest range of hills to the eastward of our anchorage. Following the range
northerly, inclining to the westward, I examined many plants of the arborescent
<i>Xanthorrhea</i> habit, before made mention of, for specimens of perfect
inflorescence, but with no success. In rather damp shaded spots on the slopes
of the hills covered with timber I discovered a. species of <i>Dryandra</i> in
considerable patches, its involucrum of flowers in decayed condition. It has
the foliage of <i>D. blechnifolia</i> and <i>D. pteridifolia</i>, and perhaps
may prove these singular fern leaved species to be but one genuine kind and not
specifically distinct. On the rocky sandy shores I gathered specimens of a
<i>Viminaria</i>, scarcely distinct from our Port Jackson <i>V. denudata</i>,
but of more slender growth. Several new smokes issuing from the woods above the
trees indicated the presence of natives, but none made their appearance.</p>
<p><i>27th. Tuesday.</i> I have been looking around me these few days past for
a fit situation for planting the seeds of European fruits, the only spot to be
chosen for that purpose is near the water-hole, where the soil is a sandy
heath-mould. I accordingly marked off a small patch a few feet square, cleared
it of the brush and small plants and prepared the ground for the seeds I intend
to sow. In the afternoon I accompanied Mr. King to Green Island, where he
wished to take a few more bearings and observations. The many sea birds that
pass the night on this island were beginning to flock around it in order to
take possession of their several spots of rest. Leaving the island we sailed
over to the mainland and landed at Bayonet Point. Whilst occupied in taking
some angles I rambled on the elevated point among the many interesting shrubs
with which it was covered, but having already visited this spot I found at this
time nothing but what I had previously detected. The little delicate
<i>Stylidium</i> allied to <i>S. glaucum</i>, with lanceolate-spathulate
leaves, afforded me good duplicate specimens. <i>Ispogon attenuatus</i> is very
fine in the rocky background. I gathered duplicate seeds of <i>Patersonia
sp.</i>, as also seeds of a <i>Kennedya</i>. The natives, who (from the fires)
appear to be all round us, continue to be very shy, and so far from allowing us
to communicate with them they keep altogether out of sight, although we noticed
this afternoon their fresh fires lighted among the trees near the beach, about
half a mile to the southward of us, between us and the cutter.</p>
<p><i>28th. Wednesday.</i> This morning I went on shore and sowed the following
seeds, stones etc., peach, apricot, lemons and loquats, with scarlet runners,
long-podded beans, marrow-fat peas, celery, parsnip, cabbage, lettuce and
carrot. Round this small garden I formed a slight hedge of green boughs and
large branches. I occupied myself on the western shores of the harbour, chiefly
in low woods subject to the encroachments of the sea in spring tides. I
gathered specimens of <i>Leptospermum linearifloium</i> (= <i>Agonis
linearifolia</i>), with some other of this genus not in a flowering state. Our
people struck the tent that had been fixed up on shore, and with all tools were
brought on board, Mr. King intending to get under weigh so soon as the wind
became favourable. At night our people drew the seine at the bottom of the
harbour in the mouth of the river and were tolerably successful.</p>
<p><i>29th. Thursday.</i> It was the intention of Mr. King, should the wind
have continued steady at S.E., to have cleared out of Oyster Harbour if not to
stand out to sea, but the wind would not allow us to get under weigh. I went on
shore to procure a few more seeds on the rocky hills on the Eastern side.
<i>Banksia grandis</i>, so very fine and rich in flower at this period, could
not be found in ripe fruit. I gathered fine flowering specimens of <i>Tremandra
sp.</i>, with apposite elliptical leaves and purple flowers.</p>
<p>This afternoon I accompanied Mr. Bedwell and Mr. Roe to Seal Island (distant
at 5 miles), who were sent in the whale boat to leave a sealed bottle
containing a memorandum, written on parchment, stating our arrival, in a safe
and secure situation on the island. Having wooded and watered here, our
intention was to proceed by the first fair wind on our voyage to the N.W.
coast, and finally that we should leave a similar document on the first
accessible island on that coast stating more particularly our future route. I
furnished myself with some seeds of <i>Candollea cuneiformis</i>, Labill., the
ornament of this solitary rock; and seeds of a reclining shrub of the
<i>Atriplicinae</i>. Two seals, a female and a cub, were shot by our people,
and others only wounded rolled down into the surf and disappeared in an
instant. The bottle was well corded up and fixed securely to the shelving part
of a large stone at once visible and at the same time perfectly secure from the
action of strong winds or other natural destructive causes. Our boat people
plundered the nests of the penguins, of whom sixteen were taken. Leaving the
island we hoisted our sail to the light breeze, which wafted us to the cutter
about 8 p.m.</p>
<p><i>30th. Friday.</i> Expecting that Mr. King would get under weigh every
hour, should the wind become fair, I was prevented going away from the shore
immediately abreast the vessel. <i>Acacia biflora</i> and <i>A. marginata</i>
are now in flower on the beach: <i>Dryandra formosa</i>, common near the
watering place is past a flowering state. I gathered some fair specimens in
flower of <i>Olax Phyllanthi</i> (= <i>Spermaxyrum phyllanthi</i>); also a
dense stunted shrub of the <i>Diosmeae</i>, flowers decandrous; style
elongated, apex glanduliferous; leaves linear, angular, glandulous. The rocks
of the immediate shores are covered with a shrubby plant of the
<i>Epacrideae</i>, which appears to be <i>Andersonia sprengelioides</i>.</p>
<p><i>31st. Saturday.</i> The present unfavourable points from which the wind
prevails (S. westerly) rendering exceedingly doubtful whether the cutter could
leave the harbour to-day, I landed and directed my course to Princess Royal
Harbour, a part I had not yet visited. Tracing my former route along the beach,
I ascended the deep, barren, stony hills that bound the Sound to the westward.
In making the rocky north point of the entrance into Princess Royal Harbour, I
gathered the following specimens and seeds on the rugged hilly country in its
vicinity:--A species of <i>Hakea</i>, larger than <i>H. elliptica</i>, leaves
more broadly elliptical, rounded at point, triplinerved, <i>Leptospermum
marginatum</i>, Labill., a tree 10-12 ft. high. <i>Hovea rhombifolia</i>, a
shrub 4 ft. high. <i>Gastrolobium sp.</i>, a spreading tree. <i>Oxylobium
sp.</i>, leaves lanceolate-ovate.</p>
<p>This rocky point of entrance is covered deeply, chiefly with
<i>Eucalypti</i> and common <i>Banksia</i>, but the whole side of the harbour
being entirely recently fired by natives I added nothing more to my few plants
already gathered. Ascending to the highest point I had a fine view of the two
harbours, sound, and the lagoon laid down in the charts. I observed the smokes
of natives some distance beyond the lower ranges of the hills to the northward
and westward. I descended to the lagoon, on the margins of which I hoped to
make some further botanical discoveries. I gathered specimens of a
<i>Comesperma</i>, with leaves linear, elongated, obtuse; flowers yellow.
<i>Comesperma sp.</i>, leaves linear, scattered; flowers in a capitated spike,
allied to <i>C. calymega</i> Labill. <i>Lobelia sp.</i>, flowers terminal, and
blue stem. <i>Epacris sp.</i>, leaves sheathing, lanceolate, acute; flowers
solitary, scarlet; <i>Santalaceae</i>, a shrubby plant, flowers very small.
<i>Leptospermum sp.</i>, leaves lanceolate, attenuated at base; branches and
calyx smooth; flowers axillary, solitary. <i>Leptospermum sp.</i>, leaves
lanceolate, rigid, and crowded; flowers in racemi, calyx teeth shorter than the
calyx-tube. I made a diligent search for the curious Pitcher Plant,
<i>Cephalotus follicularis</i>, Labill. around the lagoon and in the boggy
parts near it, but without success.</p>
<p>Returning over some downs of sand I observed a succulent plant, with
linear-lanceolate acuminate leaves, in fruit; the capsules angled, and sulcated
habit of <i>Crassula</i>. I gathered a few more seeds of <i>Candollea
cuneiformis</i>, frequent near the beach, forming an irregular stunted shrub.
<i>Dryandra nivea</i> and <i>D. armata</i> with <i>Lasiopetalum solanaceum</i>,
the latter at this period in flower, and fruit in a very young state, is
frequent on the hills I passed over in the day's route, on which, in thick
brushwood, I started a kangaroo of the size and kind called Wallabaa[*] in New
South Wales. At 4 p.m. I returned to the cutter. Fresh native fires seen in
Oyster Harbour near the entrance of the river, at dusk.</p>
<blockquote>[* Wallaby.]</blockquote>
<p>BeforeItake my leave of the rich botanical repository of sterling
worth--King George's Sound--a few remarks may not be altogether unuseful and
unnecessary. The extensive family of <i>Proteaceae</i>, whose genera and
species occupy a considerable portion of the shores of the Sound, have a varied
diffusion. <i>Banksia grandis</i> is only to be found on the above mentioned
dry exposed sides of the hills, where it flowers and fruits in a limited but
healthy state of luxuriance. <i>B. attenuata</i> has been observed on the
shores, in a deeper peaty soil, forming a tree of some bulk. <i>B.
marciscens</i>, <i>B. cocinea</i>, and <i>B. quercifolia</i> grow near the
immediate shores in and dry places, but rarely on the hills, and never in loose
sand. Excepting <i>Dryandra pteridifolia</i> and <i>D. blechnifolia</i> the
whole of this genus inhabits dry sterile hills with <i>Banksia grandis</i>.
Other genera such as <i>Isopogon</i>, <i>Petrophila</i>, <i>Hakea</i>,
<i>Anadenia</i>, <i>Adenanthos</i>, are likewise found in and rocky and sandy
situations, while <i>Franklandia</i> and some <i>Persooniae</i> enjoy the moist
peaty levels or damp heathy spots on these hills...Thus the culture of these
interesting plants will be better understood in England at all events their
native habits and soil whereof little or no loam forms a component part.</p>
<p>It is a well-known fact that our pride of New South Wales, <i>Telopea
speciosissima</i>, so tenacious of life in its natural, sterile, rocky places
of growth, seldom retains it when removed by the settlers into the richer loamy
soil of their gardens.</p>
<h4>OYSTER HARBOUR TO ENDERBY ISLAND, 1-25 FEBRUARY, 1818</h4>
<p><i>1818. February 1st. Sunday.</i> The wind shifting to S.E. by S. induced
Mr. King to get under weigh. By the assistance of a kedge-anchor we hauled out
of Oyster Harbour about 10 o'clock a.m., and after many tacks we beat out of
the Sound. At 4 p.m. we had rounded Bald Head and stood westerly along the
coast.</p>
<p>The hills overlooking the immediate coast were one grand blaze of fire,
having been kindled by the natives, and its running course before the wind
illuminating all around, these sterile elevations had a brilliant effect.</p>
<p><i>2nd. Monday.</i> No land in sight.</p>
<p><i>3rd. Tuesday to 9th. Monday.</i> The slight dysenteric (and other)
complaints which had afflicted the whole of the crew are less violent. Early
this morning we passed the Tropic of Capricorn in about 113&deg; East Long.
Expecting from our situation that we were drawing near the land, we wore ship
at 8 p.m. and stood off for a few hours. No soundings in 80 fms.</p>
<p><i>10th. Tuesday.</i> At 5 a.m. we stood in for the land, and at 8 we got
soundings in 35 fms. The land, which is called Terre d'Endracht by the French,
is extremely sterile, is somewhat elevated and hilly, gradually tapering at its
extremes and, with the immediate shores, is very sandy and covered with low
stunted shrubs. At 1 p.m. we approached the northern low extremity (N.W. Cape)
which extends out westerly in a depressed point of sand, with apparently a deep
bight or bay behind it. Passing some very dangerous breakers half a mile from
us we stood on for the cape and got a bottom in 7&frac12; fms. The latitude of
the North West Cape is 21&deg;52'43" S. and long. 114&deg;30'30" E.[*] We saw a
sea snake, several large turtle and some dolphin near the vessel. Several large
fine butterflies and small flies came off to us from the land. The latter
became very troublesome. No fires or appearance of natives were observed on
this dreary coast. The deep bay which trends in here to the eastward from the
cape and which we are about to examine is entitled Exmouth Gulf, in honour of
Lord Viscount Exmouth. Falling calm we sounded and got a bottom in 13 fms. when
we dropped an anchor with coir (made of the fibre of the cocoa nut) cable for
the night, about 7 miles distant from the land and 2 miles from a sand
island.[**] Violent gusts of wind with heavy cross swell made the vessel labour
considerably.</p>
<blockquote>[* 21&deg;47' S. 114&deg;10' E.]</blockquote>
<blockquote>[** "Three or four miles eastward of the
Cape."--King.]</blockquote>
<p><i>11th. Wednesday.</i> In heaving up our anchor we most unfortunately
parted from it, and having but an indifferent buoy lost it altogether, with
some fms. of cable.</p>
<p><i>12th. Thursday.</i> Tacked at 6 a.m., being close on board an island from
which ran a reef of rocks.[*] Our leadsman had 9 and 8&frac12; fms. In the
course of the morning's examinations several islands were seen from the mast
head, of which some were distinguished from the deck, low and barren. These
islands are no doubt much visited by turtle, of which we have now abundance
floating around us. Stood in for the main. Anchored in a bottom of sand and
small shells.</p>
<blockquote>[* Baudin's Muiron Island.]</blockquote>
<p><i>13th. Friday.</i> In consequence of the foulness of the bottom we had the
misfortune to break one of the flukes of a second anchor upon weighing this
morning. It appears it is a rock crusted over with mud, sand, and shells, a few
inches thick. Mr. King was in consequence under the necessity of running back
to the last anchorage in hopes of being able through the medium of the buoy
attached to the lost anchor, to find the particular spot and endeavour to weigh
it. The buoy not "watching" (or floating over the water) the anchor was not
discovered. Occupied at my specimens. Several large turtle, and seasnakes of an
orange colour are seen around us.</p>
<p><i>14th. Saturday.</i> At 7 a.m. we made sail and stood on for the mainland,
our soundings varying from 12-8-7-&frac12; fms. within 1&frac12; miles of the
shore; some islands observed from the mast head are low banks of sand, bare of
vegetation, but the shores of the main are bounded by sandy hills or ridges and
covered with small shrubs. The heat was very oppressive during this day. The
thermometer in the face of the sun rose to 119&frac12;&deg; on deck.</p>
<p><i>15th. Sunday.</i> At 6 o'clock a.m. we were within half a mile of the
shore, tacked and stood along the coast northerly, sounding continually. We had
a slight breeze from southward and westward. This day we carried on our survey
among an archipelago of sterile sand islands, in various depths of water. At 5
we anchored in 3 fms. in a little bay[*] about 1&frac12; miles to the westward
of a long low island. I accompanied Mr. Bedwell, 1st officer, on the shores of
the bay; he was sent to procure turtle and make some observations as to the
resources for wood, water etc. The beach is rather steep, rocky and clothed
with the mangrove, <i>Avicennia tomentosa</i>, forming large round bushes,
which at sea, in other situations, had been mistaken for clusters of rocks. It
was dark when we landed and few observations could be made. The vegetable
kingdom appeared from the sands to be very inconsiderable, some species of
<i>Salsola</i>, <i>Mesembryanthemum</i>, with <i>Salicornia</i> and some of the
<i>Atriplicinae</i> scattered on the shores. Some Acacias of very humble growth
were flourishing in these sterile flats, but none were discovered in flower;
and a very noxious <i>Spinifex</i> seemed to overwhelm all other vegetation.
Our people dug in the sands a few feet deep, but could find no trace of water;
on the contrary, a dry heat prevails. At half past 8 we left the shore, being
obliged to launch the boat about half a mile over shallow rocky coral flats
before we could find water enough to float her.</p>
<blockquote>[* Bay of Rest or Jogodor, on west side of Exmouth Gulf and thirty
miles south of North-West Cape.]</blockquote>
<p><i>16th. Monday.</i> Mr. King intending to remain at the present anchorage
so long as the southerly winds prevail, I went on shore with Mr. Roe, second
officer, wishing to employ myself in examining the botany of the extensive
sands in the vicinity of the bay, and make such collections as the apparently
scanty materials would afford me. Beyond the beach, commenced a low depressed
and tract of sand dunes, covered with attenuated brush and bounded by distant
elevated land. In a northerly route over this flat I gathered the following
specimens:--<i>Acacia sp.</i>, a small tree, on which I discovered a
<i>Loranthus</i> parasitical. <i>Hakea longifolia</i>. <i>Hakea oleifolia</i>
of King George's Sound, a small tree 12-16 feet high, afforded me seeds.
<i>Hakea stenophylla</i>, a small tree of the size of the preceding. <i>Acacia
sp.</i>, a spreading small tree 10-12 ft. high. A round, dense, junceous,
aphyllous shrub allied to <i>Thesium</i> or <i>Leptomeria</i>. I noticed a
species of <i>Acacia</i>, with small, oblong, wedge-shaped, obtuse, smooth
leaves, having a gland inserted upon the tendrils in the upper surface, but I
could not discover it in flower. On the sandy ridges I gathered specimens of
Melaleuca in fruit; leaves alternate, small, cordate, sessile, many-nerved;
capsule and branches smooth; and <i>Olax sp.</i>, a slender shrub. On the
depressed flats a junceous shrubby plant of the <i>Asclepiadaceae</i> is very
frequent; it forms round close bushes, but has no appearance of flowers, fruit
or leaves, and is very lactescent when bruised. I gathered seeds of a
<i>Gnaphalium</i>. The loose sand hollows in the soil, in consequence of being
bored by kangaroo rats, and the abundance of the prickly spinifex, were no
little inconveniences when passing over this sterile waste, which were
increased by the great reflecting heat from it. My pocket thermometer rose to
115&deg;, although not exposed to the solar ray. I measured some ant-hills of
brown and blackish colours, according to the tinges of the soil on which they
are situated; their average dimensions were about 8 feet high and 81 feet in
diameter. They have at a distance the appearance of native huts--were abandoned
by their original tenants and were fast mouldering away--forming nurseries for
lizards and several species of insects, particularly the wasp, hornet and
others of the <i>Hymenopterous</i> order. Making the coast, we traced it to our
boat over extensive beds of dead shells bleached by the weather--the remains of
once beautiful specimens. I observed fragments of coral, madrepores and shells
scattered over the whole of the distant flat land in our route, this morning,
all proofs of the sea having receded from it at no very distant period.</p>
<p>[*] A doubt having arisen whether this expanse of desert formed a part of
the main or was an island detached from it, I wished to clear up the matter by
proceeding across the same towards the distant highland. Mr. Roe had gone off
to the cutter and had taken the specimens I had collected this morning. After
walking 3 miles in a S.E. direction over these burning sands, the heat became
so extremely oppressive as to oblige me to relinquish my object, in some
measure although the appearance before me being a slight ascent towards the
high land left little or no doubts as to its belonging to and forming part of
the main, and as a presumptive proof of this, numerous tracks of emu were
noticed on those parts where the sands had been crusted together, as if by the
effect of water upon the surface. Seeking shelter and shade from the steady
fervid heat of the sun, among some close mangrove trees, my thermometer was
stationary at 105&deg; in the shade, being influenced by the cool fanning sea
breeze then setting on the land. During the route the same plants presented
themselves to me as I observed this morning, but less frequent. Dense masses of
spinifex covered this tract almost to the exclusion of other vegetation. I,
however, observed a recumbent plant with broad, elliptical leaves. It has the
character of an <i>Acacia</i>, with a glaucous hue (<i>A. oteaefolia</i> = I.
lunata). I could not discover flowering specimens. At 4 P.m. the jolly boat
took me off to the cutter. Bongaree, our native, had with great skill speared
some fish, which afforded us a fresh meal. Large smokes were observed near the
higher lands, proving to us that natives exist in these extremes of
sterility.</p>
<blockquote>[* Cunningham, having heard that this peninsula was called Cloates
Island, attempted to clear up the mystery.]</blockquote>
<p><i>17th. Tuesday.</i> In the afternoon Mr. Bedwell, First officer, was sent
on shore, and I availed myself of the opportunity and landed, trusting I might
procure a few more seeds, and perhaps specimens. I discovered some small trees
of the <i>Hakea</i> with long filiform leaves, seen yesterday, loaded with last
year's capsules, of which I gathered some specimens. In similar situations I
furnished myself with specimens in fruit of a shrub with filiform, rounded,
channelled, succulent leaves; the capsules are many, collected in a small
pyriform figure, each unilocular and 1-seeded. I gathered seeds of an
<i>Iberis</i>, a shrub with obovate, emarginate, glaucous leaves; and a dead
syngenesious shrubby plant afforded me a large paper of seeds, which are large,
compressed, and membranaceous. The greater part of the flat over which I passed
this afternoon is of a pale loose soil, compounded partly of decomposed shells,
sand and decomposition of vegetables, but approaching the boundary ridges this
description of soil disappears and a beautiful glittering red dry sand
succeeds, in which the <i>Acacia</i> grows with considerable luxuriance,
throwing out long sappy branchlets, which appeared the more surprising as we
found the sand so extremely hot as scarcely to allow us to stand upon it any
length of time without inconvenience. I gathered seeds of an <i>Acacia</i>
growing thus in the sand, with ovate-lanceolate, obtuse, mucronated
leaves,having a gland inserted on the interior margin; legumen small,
compressed, seeds round. We chased a lizard about 5 feet long, on the flat, but
running under the excavated base of an ant-hill he found a secure retreat and
could not be dislodged. Having procured a few shells of no consideration we
returned on board at dusk. This bight is called the Bay of Rest, by Mr. King,
who has ascertained it to be in lat. 22&deg;17'05" S., and long. 114&deg;
E.</p>
<p><i>18th. Wednesday.</i> At 5 a.m. we got under weigh and stood out of the
bay. I shifted my specimens and exposed them to the air. Having surveyed the
gulf, Mr. King intends now to run north east along the coast and examine those
parts more particularly not observed by the French.</p>
<p><i>19th. Thursday.</i> We passed several sand islands thinly covered with
alkaline, succulent plants. Water snakes of brilliant colours afloat near the
vessel. At 4 p.m. we changed our course and stood on for the mainland, in
consequence of a break in the beach appearing like the mouth of a river.[*]
From the masthead this opening appeared more clear and evident, presenting a
large bay or inlet of water bounded by wooded shores, whose verdure forms a
striking contrast to the sparse stunted vegetation of the coast in general. At
5 p.m. we dropped anchor in 2&frac14; fms. muddy bottom; having previously
worked in shore a quarter of a mile from the beach, which is rocky and bluff,
with a heavy surf, rendering the landing very difficult and dangerous. The
sandy ridge bounding the beach is covered with brushes and small shrubs, beyond
which are large swampy flats or salt marshes distinguished from the masthead of
the cutter. Mr. King, accompanied by the second officer, took some bearings
round the vessel and along shore, the results of which showed that the same
depth continues close to the rocks of the beach, from which we might anchor the
length of the vessel. He also went to the mouth of the Inlet, across which is a
bar of sand . At dusk he returned to the vessel with an intention of examining
the opening in the morning.</p>
<blockquote>[* Ashburton or Curlew River. "We succeeded in finding an anchorage
three miles to the eastward of the inlet."--King.]</blockquote>
<p><i>20th. Friday.</i> About 5 a.m. I went on shore (on the mainland) with Mr.
King, who was desirous of ascertaining the nature of the low swampy country at
the back of the beach and of giving me a few moments to make some observations
as to the botany of the immediate shores. The water had fallen 6 ft. and we
landed without any difficulty. The <i>Convolvulus</i> was decorating the sandy
hilly ranges with its large purple flowers, spreading its elongated branches in
every direction on the beach. I gathered the following specimens:--<i>Gyphia
sp.</i>, a suffruticose plant with blue flowers. <i>Tribulus sp.</i>, a
procumbent villous plant with pinnate leaves and echinated capsules; flowers
yellow. <i>Euphorbia sp.</i> <i>Crolon acerifolius</i>, this species appears to
be the same as the plant discovered by me on the banks of the Lachlan River in
May, 1817, and of which specimens were sent home by the "Harriet."
<i>Asphodeleae</i>, a small liliaceous plant. An arbusculous <i>Acacia</i>,
before stated, indigenous in the Bay of Rest, is the only woodIsaw, mangroves
excepted, and it is singular that neither here nor in the Bay of Rest were any
specimens of <i>Eucalyptus</i> seen. Beyond the boundary line of sand the flats
are very low, almost level with the sea, which has, at spring tides,
communication with them by the breaks and small inlets on the beach. We
returned on board at 7 to prepare for the examination of the river supposed to
lead into the interior or terminate in the lagoon seen this morning.</p>
<p>Mr. King, Mr. Roe, self, Bongaree and four of the crew left the cutter in
the second whale boat about 9 o'clock. We kept within the sandy islands
(forming projecting low points to the sea), being almost surrounded by
mangroves. Crossing the bar at the entrance to the mouth of the river or inlet,
which is about 150 yards wide, we pulled up in a fathom to 11 fms., although
frequently on the left shore we had 2 and 2&frac12; fms. At 2&frac12; miles
from the entrance, the shores, which had been thickly clothed with
<i>Rhizophora</i> and <i>Avicennia</i>, are very low, gradually becoming
somewhat higher, and are nearly bare, with here and there small sapling
<i>Eucalypti</i>. We all landed to look around. Mr. King and myself went over
the scorching flats to a sandy elevation in hopes of taking some bearings and
to make a few observations relative to this channel of water. No information
could be gathered from this ridge, and it being the highest part we could see
we returned to the boat.</p>
<p>Mr. King was satisfied that it would only be a waste of time to examine
further up this inlet, inferring from its red muddy bottom, its effects among
the mangroves and its general shoaliness, that it was a body of water of no
consideration; that the whole of the flats crusted with mud and white with salt
(crystallizing, the sun having evaporated the stagnant salt water) had lately
been inundated; that its decrease of width, its many little channels running
from it, indicate its termination to be at no great distance; and that the
whole flat country on this coast is one general salt marsh, continually subject
to the inundations and encroachments of the sea.</p>
<p>On these sandy flats I gathered fine flowering specimens of an <i>Acacia</i>
with obovate oblique leaves, first observed in the Bay of Rest. <i>Scaevola
spinosa</i>, discovered in the western interior in June 1817, is common on the
banks of this inlet in flower, with a shrubby plant of spreading depressed
habit, allied to the genus <i>Saponaria</i>. The sandy hills produce a shrub of
the <i>Asclepiadaceae</i> having decayed folicles and elongated lanceolate
leaves, but not in flower. I gathered a few specimens of grasses on the
immediate banks. Our boat people had been busy in our absence and had caught
some fish, but chiefly of the kind called catfish. In our return we traced the
impressions of the feet of natives on the soft mud in and about a small inlet
or branch of the river, the mouth of which had been stopped with twigs, in
order to retain the fish in a basin within them at low water. It was hence
presumed that fresh water could not be far distant From the great numbers of
curlews observed on this large salt water inlet Mr. King has given it the name
of that bird. Our first officer had landed on the main and had visited the salt
marsh at the back of the beach, and reports the quantities of crystallized salt
he saw on these flats. He brought me specimens of a <i>Dolichos</i> with
axillary stalks, which he had gathered on the sand (<i>D. foliolis</i>).</p>
<p><i>21st. Saturday.</i> This morning at 6 o'clock our water was reduced to 9
feet. We weighed anchor and stood off E.N.E. Nothing can convey to us the idea
of smokes of natives better than the spiral manner in which large bodies of
sand are carried into the air by whirlwinds. We have seen several this day, and
had we not been witnesses of the ascent of a column of sand near us yesterday
on shore, we should most naturally have allowed ourselves to be deceived
to-day, concluding them to be the smoke of native fires.</p>
<p>Very large turtle 3&frac12; and 4 ft. diameter over their backs, and
abundance of albicore are observed around us. Passed several small islands, and
frequently tacked in consequence of shoaly water. At half past 5 we came to an
anchor in 5 fms., on a bottom of small stones.[*] The connection of sand
islands chained together by banks of sand prevented us from standing within
sight of the mainland, but from the circumstances of the tide setting in the
N.E., a bight or bay is expected in that direction. We had a good run of 45
miles to-day.</p>
<blockquote>[* Under "an island of larger size about four miles off the
main."--King.]</blockquote>
<p><i>22nd. Sunday.</i> At half past 8 we weighed, with a light air, and stood
in for the main (which appeared at noon to trend in deeply to the eastward); it
is very low, and from the masthead has a broken rugged shore. The land around
us is either covered with salt water in a chain of lagoons or is dry and white
with salt as seen at Curlew River. The breaks in the line of coast are clothed
with large bodies of mangroves, and appear to be drains to the inland marshes,
which to the eastward are bounded by high hills, distinguished from the deck.
Several new islands were observed to windward, of which bearings were taken. At
half past 7 we anchored in about a quarter of a mile from a slightly elevated
sandy island, bearing N.W. by W., lat. 21&deg;13'01" S., long. 115&deg;58'35"
E.</p>
<p><i>23rd. Monday.</i> The closeness last night was very oppressive. Between 5
and 6 a.m. we got under weigh, but the calms obliged us to re-anchor. At half
past 9 we weighed again, with a slight breeze from the S.W. We stood along the
coast at a considerable distance from the shore, which is low and broken.
Bearing up for a projecting rocky cape, we doubled it[*] and stood in for the
land, which runs in deeply and forms a bay. Reefs warned us of imminent danger,
and obliged us to tack instantly. The more elevated or rising parts of the
coast assume a new feature, being thickly covered with brushwood from the
water's edge to the ridge of these small hills. We could clearly distinguish
some high land in the interior from the cutter's deck, and should hope and
trust a change for the better is about to take place. About half past 9 p.m. a
sudden squall came on from the south-eastward and the wind blowing with
incredible force from the elevated sandy hills was exceedingly hot and
accompanied by much sand. Our leadsman reported 10 and 11 fms., which gave us
great scope to the swell that was getting up to drive us off shore. The
thermometer during the squall was stationary at 91&deg;.</p>
<blockquote>[* "We steered close round Cape Preston."--King.]</blockquote>
<p><i>24th. Tuesday.</i> Favoured with light airs we weighed and steered for an
island 2 or 3 miles to the northward, which we have suspected may be the
Rosemary Island of Dampier, situated according to the French charts in
Dampier's Archipelago, and while standing on for the island were suddenly
shoaled and immediately hauled off. Steering awhile on a new course, Mr. King
still desirous if possible of anchoring under this island, we again stood in
for it. The soundings were very irregular, till close in upon the island, when
we anchored at 6 o'clock within three quarters of a mile of the shore.</p>
<p>This island[*] is very different from the low sandy flats which we have been
accustomed to, it is hilly, hummocky, and very irregular, appears covered with
grass and small plants, and with large fragments of rock or stone of a red
ferruginous colour. The gullies appearing deep, suggested the probability of
fresh water being procurable. Several small whale were observed spouting close
in shore. Our lat. is 20&deg;44'30" S. The wind was blowing fresh from the
S.E., whence thunder and very vivid lightning appeared. We struck our topmast,
dropped another anchor, and prepared to meet the blast. It being a matter of
very considerable doubt whether we shall be fortunate enough to discover water,
it became necessary to reduce our daily allowance to a gallon per day each
person.</p>
<blockquote>[* Enderby Island.]</blockquote>
<p><i>25th. Wednesday.</i> At anchor off a sandy bay.[*] At daybreak 4 a.m. I
accompanied Mr. King and the second officer in the jolly boat to the sandy
beach, and whilst they were engaged in taking angles from the highest parts of
the islands, I employed myself on the lower sandy flats and on the rocky stony
hills. The following specimens I gathered in such situations:--<i>Ficus
orbicularis</i>, a shrub 4 ft. high. <i>Ficus sp.</i>, a small tree in ravines
and rocky gullies. <i>Acacia sp.</i>, a low spreading shrub. <i>Acacia sp.</i>,
a shrub frequently seen at the Bay of Rest. <i>Solanum sp.</i>, <i>Echites
sp.</i>, a slender shrub. I discovered on the gritty, coarse sand near the
beach, at the base of the hills, a shrubby plant, perhaps of the genus
<i>Triumfelta</i>. About 9 a.m. we all went off on board, and having then
secured my specimens I returned to the shore. A party of our people were sent
from the vessel to search for water, either by digging under the hills or
otherwise, presumed to be found in the gullies which they were to trace. I took
a walk round to the N.E. side of the island, but added only one or two
specimens to my collection. In sterile heated valleys of sand a twining plant
of the <i>Asclepiadaceae</i> (<i>Cynanchum sp.</i>), with cordate leaves and
small white flowers, is most predominant. A syngenesious plant, the
<i>Sphaeranthus indicus</i>, Linn., is frequent but not in a flowering state. I
gathered some specimens of the shrub Dampier had many years ago published in
his voyage Vol. 3, p.m. L4, f3., under the title of rosemary, and which, from
its abundance on an island in this archipelago on which he landed, suggested
the name of Rosemary Island. It is a large shrub of lax habit, and may be a
<i>Conyza</i>, leaves linear, entire, margin revolute, villous beneath. A
species of <i>Cassia</i>, with large ovate and elliptical leaflets, oblique at
their base, rounded at their points and mucronated, the glands pedicelled and
inserted at the base of the petioles, and terminal spike, is a rare shrub on
rocky exposed situations.</p>
<blockquote>[* "Anchored off a sandy beach to the eastward of Rocky
Head."--King.</blockquote>
]
<p>The people had been digging in vain, they could not penetrate to any depth,
in consequence of the stony shallow soil, but they discovered in the deep
excavations of a rocky gully a quantity of about 12 gallons of water that had
been stagnant for some time, but had acquired a sub-putrid taste, and was
exceedingly soft, and although shaded from the intense heat by the branches of
the <i>Ficus</i> above mentioned was very warm. It was very acceptable, and a
bareca was filled with it and carried on board. Upon returning along the shore
to the boat I found our two officers had just come on shore, and the one
proposed an excursion across the island to the opposite shore, whilst the
other, with our worthy friend Bongaree, intended to search the beach for
shells. I accompanied Mr. Roe inland. We followed the windings of a gully to an
elevated flat between the shoulders of the higher hills, where it is evident,
from the number of small dry channels concentrating at the mouth of this gully,
that immense bodies of water descend into the lower flats and thence over the
beach into the sea. Passing over the highest hills, which are extremely rugged
and stony, covered with spinifex, we gradually descended through a ravine and
came out upon a sandy beach to the westward of the shores we had intended to
have made.</p>
<p>The evening was too far advanced to proceed further from the vessel, it was
therefore determined to range about and then return to the boat. There are
remarkable concentrations of gullies and deep furrowed water-courses at this
small sandy shore, and a slight humidity being observed on the soil on the more
shaded parts, induced us to search the gullies and leading channels. It was,
however, fruitless, the water apparently had but just sunk below the depth of
the earth a few days previously. A species of <i>Dolichos</i>, in fruit and
flower, was spread over the sands. It seems distinct from <i>D. gladiatus</i>,
to which it is allied. I gathered one specimen of a papilionaceous plant, a
<i>Swainsona</i>, with purple flowers. The <i>Croton</i> of the Interior of
Australia and Curlew River is here likewise in the gullies, the shrubs I
examined, had all of them male flowers. A very strong scented glutinous plant,
of the class <i>Didynamia</i>, with a bilabiated purple corolla, is frequent on
the hills among the rocks, in round bushy forms.</p>
<p>Pursuing a rugged route over the hills we arrived at the boat at dusk. The
tide had fallen several feet, and the people were therefore obliged to carry
the boat over the rocky shore to float her. Among the loose fragments of
ironstone, with which this island abounds, numerous pigmy kangaroo find a
secure retreat, and the higher cliffy parts are inhabited by numbers of the
white cockatoo, whose figure and cry pronounce them the same as those of New
South Wales. The bay abounds with fish of various kinds. Sharks are in schools.
Sea snakes and turtle are frequent, but the season of the latter visiting the
shore being past, we could take none at sea. This island not being the Rosemary
Island, as laid down in the charts (French), Mr. King has named it Enderby
Island.[*]</p>
<blockquote>[* "An island to the northward on which are three hummocks was soon
recognized as Captain Baudin's Ile Romarin."]</blockquote>
<h4>AMONG THE ISLANDS oF DAMPIER ARCHIPELAGO, 26 FEBRUARY--4 MARCH, 1818</h4>
<p><i>26th. Thursday.</i> At half past ten got under weigh. In standing between
the islands of the group we discovered three natives in the water, appearing
from the distance we were from them, to be wading over shoaly flats from one
island to another.[*]</p>
<blockquote>[* "Wading towards Lewis Island."--King.]</blockquote>
<p>Making more sail, we steered direct for them, whereupon approaching them we
observed they were each seated on a canoe-afloat, and were making as much way
for the nearest shore as possible, paddling along with their hands. About 2
p.m., coming up with them, we wore ship and lay to, and lowering the jolly boat
we sent it after them with four able hands. Our people soon overtook the third
man who had not been so active in working to windward as his comrades, and,
with difficulty and with as much care as possible, he was seized and lifted
into the boat[*] but not before he had dived 2 or 3 times under her bottom in
attempting to escape. Upon being brought on board we were presented with a fine
figure of a man, of rather thin, spare shape. About 6 ft. 2 inches high, of a
good visage, as an Australian, strong bushy beard, tolerably well-proportioned
limbs, and apparently 27 or 28 years of age. He was not wanting in the incisive
or front teeth, nor were the signs of circumcision, spoken of by authors,
visible. He was perfectly naked, tattooed on the breech, wore no ornaments,
having only a pointed stick about 7 inches long stuck in his hair, that might
be useful to extract fish from their shells or other purposes,</p>
<p>Although sullen and much alarmed at first, he soon assumed a degree of
confidence when he experienced the kindness and attention paid him. He
occasionally made signs towards the land and talked, but his language was not
understood by Bongaree, our Port Jackson native, or ourselves. We decorated him
with glass beads, which we hung round his neck, but, like the natives of other
Australian tribes, he was not disposed to admire these ornaments, preferring
rather useful and beneficial things. He ate but sparingly of our biscuit, but
drank freely a quart of fresh water. He took much notice of Bongaree, who had
reluctantly at our persuasion stripped and exhibited a scarified body--a
counterpart of his own. By this time we had approached so near an island as to
be within 1&frac12; miles of its shores, on which were many natives patiently
watching us,[*] and apparently in anxiety to know the result of the capture. We
therefore shortened sail and anchored in 5 fms.</p>
<blockquote>[* On seeing them, the captive immediately exclaimed, in a loud
voice, "c&otilde;m&atilde; n&euml;gr&auml;."-King.]</blockquote>
<p>We gave the native an axe showing him its use; a bag containing beef and
biscuit, a red cap and some small cordage, and, expressing a desire to depart,
he was taken off in the jolly boat for the beach, on which his countrymen were
sitting, the officer on the boat having directions not to land him, but to
approach the shore, place him with the gifts round his neck on his float and
launch him off. He soon landed on the beach, but his comrades approached him
very cautiously, with their spears poised over their shoulders, while others
were timid and ran back behind the bushes. This strange symptom of fear and
distrust entirely originated in the figure the captive native made with the bag
at his back and the red cap on his head; but soon disengaging himself of these
encumbrances and throwing the whole carelessly on the sand he joined his
comrades, whose numbers, including women and children, were between 36 and
40.</p>
<p>We were at a loss to know the kind of wood of which his simple kind of float
or bark was made. It is about a foot in diameter and might be 7 or 8 feet long,
solid and cylindrical, or tapering slightly towards the extremes, which were
detached pieces, joined by the means of sticks forced into the ends of the
mainpiece. They sit upon it, about the middle, astride, allowing their legs to
hang down in the water, or can at pleasure place their feet horizontally along
the float, resting the heel on its forepoint. Practice and habit have enabled
them to sit so <i>in equilibrio</i> as to prevent their bark turning with them,
and when they wish to advance rapidly they incline the body forward, put their
feet in motion and paddle with their hands. Only the head of the float is seen,
the greater part being under water, diagonally to its horizontal surface.</p>
<p>At 5 o'clock p.m. our second officer with Bongaree and four of the crew, all
well armed, were sent towards them, with a view of landing and effecting an
amicable interview and communication, I accompanied Mr. Roe in the boat. On our
near approach they came to meet us making signs to us to land, but the heavy
surf rolling over the rugged rocks lining the shore altogether prevented us. We
stood off and on, rowing along the rocky beach, answered the calls of the
natives, who waded up to their breasts towards us, and gave some ornaments to
those who ventured within the length of their spears from the boat, but their
whole desires and wishes were that we should land among them. Finding it
altogether unsafe, in consequence of the rugged shore and great swell, we left
them for the vessel, when they expressed their disappointment by shouting
loudly as we rowed off.</p>
<p>A friendly interview would be very desirable, as it might be the means of
discovering the spot where fresh water is to be procured, the existence of
which the very presence of these poor creatures, with their wives and children,
plainly indicates. Among the natives we distinguished some aged grey bearded
men, some athletic adults, and some full grown boys; and the captured native
was observed among the group and appeared rather shy, and he had left his axe
on the beach when he came into the water towards us.</p>
<p>Their spears are very thick and stout, round, sharp pointed, but barbless,
and appeared 9-10 ft. long. At sunset a fire was observed near the water's edge
on an island to windward.</p>
<blockquote>INTERCOURSE ISLANDS[*]</blockquote>
<blockquote>[* The group between Lewis Island and the main was called
Intercourse Islands. Seven in number, they are situated in the south-east
portion of Mermaid Strait.]</blockquote>
]
<p><i>27th. Friday.</i> The natives still continue at their temporary
encampment on the rising parts of the island, some of whom were observed
bathing in the course of the forenoon. Immediately after dinner, Mr. King, Mr.
Bedwell, and myself, left the cutter in the large whale boat for the island, in
order to get an interview with the natives, and by signs endeavour to obtain
the information where fresh water might be procured. We landed on a sandy beach
at nearly the lee side of the island, but found the natives had left it in the
course of the forenoon, nor was it until some time had elapsed that they were
discovered on the shores opposite to us to the eastward. Their huts were of
green boughs, very temporary, and could form no shelter in rainy weather, and
their fires were small and many in number. It was with no small surprise we
found near the huts the axe and other things we had given the native on board,
the bag with provisions appeared not to have been even opened. This island is
sand, chiefly of a red colour, over which large pieces of ironstone are
scattered. I gathered the following specimens:--<i>Stylosanthes sp.</i>, a
pinnated-leaved prostrate plant. <i>Velleia sp.</i>, a suffruticose plant.
<i>Leschenaultia sp.</i>, large yellow flowers. <i>Cleome sp.</i> <i>Vicia
sp.</i>, a weak plant, frequent with the <i>Dolichos</i> of Enderby Island. The
more rocky exposed parts are covered with a plant of the <i>Asclepiadaceae</i>.
The <i>Spinifex</i> is frequent on the island, and <i>Convolvulus
pes-caprae</i> is stretched over the sands near the beach. A small plant of the
<i>Cucurbitaceae</i> and some shrubs of the <i>Atriplicinae</i>, before
noticed, and of which the native huts were made, were abundant on the shore.
Leaving the place and stretching over to the opposite shores, on which we could
distinguish several natives, as well as two in the water on their barks, we
made for a sandy beach; the natives came to meet us, shouting and making many
signs, inviting us to land. Mr. King, and Bongaree (naked) landed first, and
walked up to them, and a friendly conference took place, one of the natives
advancing and receiving Mr. King with open hands.</p>
<p>We all landed, and found our commander with the natives, who, including the
two who had been in the water, now amounted to about a dozen. We decorated
their persons with beads, and the reflection of their frizzled visages in a
glass created much laughter among them. To the one who had advanced towards us
first, we gave the cap and axe and, having found a piece of wood on the beach,
Bongaree was directed to show him how to use it. Some old rusty nails, files,
sharpened chisels, were also presented to this person, who although he appeared
the most intelligent among them, received all with a careless indifference and
unconcern. It is evident they never saw iron before, and knew nothing of its
valuable uses. The captured native was not among them, nor did we observe any
so well proportioned as he was.</p>
<p>The eyes of most of them are bad, and affected much with watery humours,
occasioned by their habits of sitting over the smokes of their little fires.
Some of their faces were covered with fish oil, over which they had sprinkled
the dust of powdered charcoal, rendering them still more disgusting than they
naturally are. The whole of them were scarified on the back and shoulders, and
one poor lad, on whom the operation had been recently made, still smarted under
its pains, which were aggravated by the myriads of small flies continually
annoying him. We attempted in vain to form a vocabulary of their language, but
they understood our desire to find fresh water, and pointed to some elevated
rocky islands. We did not attempt to leave the beach to look around the low
land lying beyond it, whence a few stragglers came unarmed seemingly from their
encampment, where probably their women were, for we saw none.</p>
<p>Pulling off, we set sail for the sandy beach of another island, where we
intended to land and search for water. Upon approaching the shore we noticed
several natives descending from a steep rocky point to the little bay, where we
wished to have landed. Their numbers were upwards of 20, all armed with spears
and appeared bold and courageous. Four men left their companions on the right
entrance and ran over the sands to the left side. and wading in the water
informed us by their gestures that we should not land. And their wild defying
grimaces and vociferous yells were clear and palpable proofs that their
intentions were decidedly hostile. It was considered much more prudent to leave
them than occasion bloodshed. In consequence of its being the first
communication that we have had with natives since we left Port Jackson, the
first island on which we saw natives, the second on which we had an interview
with them, and the third where they opposed our landing, have collectively been
called Intercourse Islands, whereof the first is in about lat. 20&deg;35'
S.[*]</p>
<blockquote>[* East Intercourse, West Intercourse, and Intercourse Islands are
the largest of of the group.]</blockquote>
<p><i>28th. Saturday.</i> At 9 we got under weigh and stood among the islands,
and at half past eleven, having got well to the eastward of this group, we
anchored in about 5 fms. I accompanied Mr. Roe, who was sent at 3 p.m. to
examine the bottom of the bay before us,[*] and if possible to discover water.
We sailed to its extreme end, which is bounded by mangroves, and passed up a
salt water inlet in hopes of coming out upon the back land, but impenetrable
thicket of lofty mangroves of <i>Avicennia</i> and <i>Rhizophora</i> mangle
obliged us to return. <i>Rhizophora mangle</i> was in flower, the fruit is
long, subulate and clavated.</p>
<blockquote>[* Probably King Bay.]</blockquote>
<p>We landed at a rugged rocky small opening, and walked over the salt plains,
now dry, to somewhat more elevated parts of this sterile coast. <i>Scaevola
spinescens</i> is very strong, and resists the and barrenness around most
surprisingly.</p>
<p>Arriving under some hills, consisting chiefly of rugged heaps of ironstone,
we dug in the valleys between each range for water, but our people were
prevented from penetrating deep, it being very shallow and rocky. The idea was
therefore abandoned of procuring the invaluable desideratum by such means. On
the margin of the stony water channels, now dry, and in the rocky valleys, I
discovered many specimens of a small tree, which from habit and a decayed
capsule being found on one plant, proved to belong to the <i>Proteacae</i>, of
the genus <i>Grevillea</i>. I was not fortunate in my search for flowering
specimens. I gathered specimens of a species of <i>Scaevola</i>, with oblong
spatulate acute leaves, bilobed, at the base; raceme axillary, three-flowered.
<i>Phyllanthus sp.</i>, leaves simple, oblong, blunt, decurrent, attenuated at
base; flower axillary, the lower ones pedunculated and female; an annual plant.
<i>Gomphrena sp.</i>, an annual plant. <i>Verbena sp.</i>, leaves linear;
flowers in a spike. <i>Boehmeria sp.</i>, stem hoary, procumbent, diffuse;
leaves elliptical, oblong, obtuse, undulate; panicle loose. I likewise
furnished myself with specimens of a long slender-stemmed shrub allied to
<i>Dalea</i>. Among the large fragments of ironstone a species of
<i>Trichosanthes</i> was very conspicuous, fruit small, flowers white and
ciliated; the whole plant is fetid as in some <i>Bryoniae</i>.</p>
<p>Our people traced the water-courses between the rocky hills, but all was dry
and miserable. The more elevated points of these heaps of stones are crowned
with the larger fig of Enderby Island, and the whole is covered densely with
spinifex and other grasses, of which I gathered specimens. Returning to the
boat, we fell in with the track of natives on the sand, evidently on the same
errand as ourselves. One of the boats crew traced their steps to another gully
between the rocks, but barely the appearance of humidity existed among the
stones. From this situation we rowed over to a sandy beach, where dry channels
were followed among high wiry grass between the small rising grounds to no
purpose whatever. We therefore returned on board about 7 p.m.</p>
<p><i>1818. March 1st. Sunday.</i> Mustered the people, and the church service
was read on board as usual. At half past 10 we weighed and stood out, with an
intention of running northerly. At 2 p.m., being abreast of an elevated rocky
island, whose highest points commanded a good view of the numerous islands
around us, and a small sandy bay opening to us, we tacked and stood in for it,
anchoring at about half a mile from the shore in 5 fms.[*] About 4 p.m. Mr.
King and Mr. Roe went on shore, to take some angles and bearings of the island,
and I accompanied them, to examine its scanty vegetable produce. We landed on a
fine sandy beach, and the tide was just about the turn (ebb). This island
presents to me nothing different in point of character. It is for the most part
of the red ferruginous-coloured ironstone, with the same irregular rugged
disposition and the same sterile gritty sands so prevalent on the islands
visited. <i>Acacia oleaefolia</i>, first seen at the Bay of Rest, of glaucous
hue, is very strong on the exposed parts of this island, but not in a flowering
state. The aphyllous plant of the <i>Asclepiadaceae</i>, habit of
<i>Ceropegia</i>, is very abundant. I gathered the following
specirnens:--<i>Opercularia sp.</i>, a trailing herbaceous plant, among the
rocks. I was not a little surprised to find the Kennedya I discovered in July
1817, in sterile bleak open flats near the Regent Lake on the Lachlan iver, in
lat.33&deg;13' S. and long. 146&deg;40' E. It is not common I could only see
three plants, of which one was in flower. I gathered some ripe seeds of a
<i>Cucumis</i>, fruit red, hispid, small and globular, size of a red currant.
The vine of this plant has been seen on all the islands of this Archipelago
visited, but never in fruit before to-day. On the rocky margins of the dry
water-courses, a harsh shrub, perhaps of the <i>Urlicaceae</i>, with clusters
of small male flowers, was observed and induced me to gather a few specimens in
the imperfect state it was then found. I also gathered seeds of a curious
lateral flowering grass .[**] The same signs of rain water having been running
in considerable bodies and standing in the hollows, appear here as throughout
the archipelago, but not a drop of fresh water now exists! The necessary
bearings were very fortunately taken by Mr. King in time before we became
enveloped in gloom, occasioned by the action of a strong wind upon the sands,
which being raised were blown over to the northward and westward in clouds like
smoke. These false appearances of native smoke have no doubt deceived preceding
navigators, and perhaps the French, tempting them to conclude parts from whence
the clouds arose were inhabited, however arid and inhospitable. We have seen
and proved this fallacy, having been on a sandy flat within a quarter of a mile
of one of the columns of loose sand when it was ascending. Several large whales
were seen spouting among the islands. No tree or shrub above three feet high
was observed on this island, the highest (a south) point of which is called
Courtney Head.[***] This island is Isle Malus of the French.</p>
<blockquote>[* At Malus Island the cutter anchored in a bay under the west side
of Courtenay Head.]</blockquote>
<blockquote>[** Here too was discovered the <i>Clianthus Dampieri</i> A.
Cun.]</blockquote>
<blockquote>[* Dampier's bluff point.]</blockquote>
<p><i>2nd. Monday.</i> Some turtle having been seen in the evening making for
the island, a party was sent on shore at dusk to secure them, and this morning
they returned without any success. Mr. King sent the second officer on shore,
with some hands, to dig for water. They returned in two hours, having
penetrated 10 feet with no signs of humidity. We got under weigh immediately,
and bore up S.S.E. for a point of land where we dropt our anchor till the
morning.[*]</p>
<blockquote>[* Under north-west end of Baudin's Legendre I.]</blockquote>
<p><i>3rd. Tuesday.</i> The atmosphere is much more sensibly temperate than we
have felt it for some days past, although the mercury of the thermometer was
not so materially affected. A thermometer on deck not exposed to the sun, but
from its situation somewhat affected by its rays, rose at 4 p.m. to 116&deg;
Farenheit. A report was made from the mast head that we were approaching shoaly
water, but it appeared that the surface of the sea was covered in patches with
a reddish scum, usually termed sea-sawdust, from its resemblance to that of
cedar or other light coloured woods. It may in reality be the spawn of minute
fish. Not intending to anchor at night, we stood out, the vessel's head being
N. by W. Upon comparing the islands of this archipelago, now laid down by Mr.
King, with the published charts of the French, we find that several of them
have been named by these navigators, although very badly and inaccurately
surveyed, while others of them that we have been round were considered by them
as part of the main.</p>
<p><i>4th. Wednesday.</i> We steered outside several islands forming the
Archipelago, some of which are long strips of low sand, while others more
distant are rocky, rugged and lofty. We attempted to round these islands and
steer in among them, but a dangerous rock running off from the weathermost
warned us to luff up to windward, and an opening appearing in the land from the
masthead we bore up for it with a light breeze. At sunset we were in a bay,
having the supposed opening or channel to the back of the islands passed
to-day. This bay is called Nickol's Bay.[*]</p>
<blockquote>[* In Nickol Bay the pearl fishing of Western Australia was
started.]</blockquote>
<h4>DAMPIER'S ARCHIPELAGO TO POINT TURNER, 5-26 MARCH, 1818</h4>
5<i>th. Thursday.</i> The supposed opening is clearly seen from the mast-head
this morning to be only a slight trending of the land, which is exceedingly
low, with some patches of mangroves. About half past 6 a.m. we left Nickol's
Bay, with a breeze from S.W. A projecting point of the mainland, whose shores
to the northward trend in easterly, has been named Cape Lambert, in honour of
A. B. Lambert, Esqre., of Grosvenor Street, London.[*] We ran along a very low
and dangerous coast, whose adjacent islands could be traced from the mast-head
to be chained together by reefs and sandy shoals. Some rocks had their points
just above the surface of the water, allowing the waves to beat over them and
warn the cautious mariner of the dangers around him.
<blockquote>[* Cape Lambert is on the north-west side of approach to Port
Walcott.]</blockquote>
<p>Tracing the coast north-easterly, we bore away for an island seen by the
French (Baudin), who in passing kept well out to sea, hence could not
distinguish the low mainland as it really exists. At 5 p.m. we were about 2
miles to the westward of the island, which is laid down in the French charts
under the title of Isle Depuch, it appears one body of bare naked ironstone,
with scarcely a trace of vegetation, and its general aspect cannot under any
view convey to the mind any flattering ideas of its fertility, or its springs
of water, which have been represented by the authors of the voyage under
Commodore Baudin.</p>
<p><i>6th. Friday.</i> In this morning's run we passed to windward of several
low, flat, sandy and rocky islands named by the French, although only seen by
them at such a distance as not to enable them clearly to distinguish between
islands and mainland.</p>
<p><i>7th. Saturday.</i> Suspecting from the steadiness of the wind from that
quarter that the north-easterly monsoon would set in altogether by the latter
end of this month or beginning of April, and fearful should we continue longer
on this coast we would not be able to beat up to the eastward, and in that case
would be wholly cut off from the means of obtaining fresh supplies of wood and
water at Timor or elsewhere, Mr. King has determined to leave the coast and run
as far as possible to the eastward on the north coast, and at the change of the
monsoon survey westerly.</p>
<p><i>8th. Sunday.</i> Divine Service as usual on board. Being in the latitude
of a reef laid down in the charts, but to the westward of it, a good look out
was kept at the mast-head, and we sounded hourly. At 8 p.m. we found no bottom
in 80 fms.</p>
<p><i>9th. Monday.</i> Tropic birds accompanied us this morning, nine were
hovering over the mast-head. Dead calm, and a sultry afternoon. Our lat. is
17&deg;34'28" S., and long. 117&deg;58'06" E.</p>
<p><i>10th. Tuesday.</i> At half past 5 a long narrow water spout was observed
to leeward of us, issuing from the clouds in a slender curved form. At
intervals it was not seen, and again reappearing we traced it distinctly to the
surface of the sea, the clouds at these moments were very dark and heavy,
pregnant with water, which is disembogued by means of the spout.</p>
<p><i>11th. Wednesday.</i> A fine sperm whale made his appearance near the
vessel, round which he swam twice and disappeared.</p>
<p><i>12th. Thursday.</i> The clouds bounding the visible horizon, particularly
to the westward, are very romantic in their disposition, in them many wild
irregular shapes and warm delicate tints may be traced. Their singular tendency
to form into cones, spires and pyramids, may be peculiar to this Australian
coast, as also may be said of these dark threatening clouds whose lowering
heavy aspect induced us on several occasions to shorten sail and await the
approach of the squall, but which in the sequel had no evil tendency, the
hovering storm resolved and cleared off in a few moments, to our great
surprise, until accustomed to these phenomena.</p>
<p><i>13th. Friday.</i> We made sail, but it was of little use, making but
little way through the water. Aware we were upon the site of the shoals and
rocks laid down on the charts of this coast, a good look out was kept at the
mast head, but we could discover nothing, or could we find bottom in 23 fms.
Our situation at noon, as deduced from many sets of solar and lunar
observations, is 17&deg;35' S. and 118&deg;41' E.</p>
<p><i>14th. Saturday.</i> At half past 5 p.m. the surf of a reef of sand bank
was seen from the top-gallant-mast head, bearing due east, distance 5 miles.
From the nature of the waves breaking it appears to be mostly sand. Wore ship
and passed to windward; we got no bottom in 200 fms.</p>
<p><i>15th. Sunday.</i> In consequence of our discovery of the shoal last
evening, we lay to at night, and at 5 a.m. tacked to southward. At 7 we saw the
breakers from the masthead bearing S.E. by S. Prayers as usual on board to the
vessel's company. At 3 p.m. we lost sight of the shoal, and at 6 hove to. Wind,
W. by S. These shoals are extensive flats of sand, perhaps 5 miles long from N.
to N.W., with some rocks of small elevation on their margins.[*] Their surfaces
as presented to us from the mast-head are shallows covered with water, perhaps
2-20 feet, of great breadth, but no spots were perfectly dry.</p>
<blockquote>[* Named Rowley Shoals, after Captain Rowley, H.M.S. "Imperieuse,"
who discovered the westernmost in 1800.]</blockquote>
<p><i>16th. Monday.</i> From the mast-head another shoal was discovered, of
considerable extent, and of like appearance of those seen yesterday.</p>
<p><i>17th, Tuesday to 23rd, Monday.</i> Between these periods we have had
winds from S.W. to W.S.W. Fine with succeeding squalls, and a damp moist
atmosphere.</p>
<p><i>24th. Tuesday.</i> At 7 we hove to for bearings of some islands in sight.
It was doubtful which of the islands now seen was New Year's Island of Captain
Flinders.[*] They appear from the deck clothed with trees, and more green and
grassy than those of Dampier's Archipelago. Great flocks of seabirds were
hovering about these islands, of which one has been called Fowler's Island by
Captain Flinders, and another Oxley's Island by Mr. King, the former in honour
of the Lieutenant of the indefatigable navigator, and the latter as a
compliment to John Oxley, Esqre., Surveyor General of New South Wales; and the
whole collectively are called Flinders Group.</p>
<blockquote>[* "The north-easternmost proved to be New Year's Island of
Lieutenant McCluer." King. This isle is still called New Year Isle, and an isle
nine miles to the southward McCluer Isle.]</blockquote>
<p><i>25th. Wednesday.</i> During the forenoon the breeze slackened and again
sprang up due cast. We therefore tacked ship and stood southerly for the coast.
Some curious Zoophytes were floating around the vessel, particularly <i>Porpita
gigantea</i> of the French.</p>
<p><i>26th. Thursday.</i> At 8 a.m., land that had been seen from the mast-head
some hours before was plainly distinguished from. the deck. We tacked and stood
into a bight in the land thickly enveloped in mangroves, but shoaled to
2&frac12; fms. although 3 miles from the shore. The coast here appears in
patches very barren, low and sandy, several of its points were named by Mr.
King, who now commenced his survey running westerly. At 6, the soundings, from
a rocky hard bottom changed to soft mud, and the appearance of the horizon to
windward being favourable, Mr. King resolved to anchor, which he did at half
past 6 in 15 fms., off Point Turner.[*]</p>
<blockquote>[* Which forms the western entrance point of King
River.]</blockquote>

<h2>CHAPTER X</h2>
<h3>CUNNINGHAM'S JOURNAL</h3>
<p><b>("Mermaid's" Voyage Completed)</b></p>
<h4>GOULBURN ISLANDS, 27 MARCH--7 APRIL, 1818</h4>
<p><i>27th. Friday.</i> At 7 a.m. we weighed and bore up west, taking bearings
of points as we passed along. The general depression of this part of the coast,
the mangrove beaches, and the bodies of water noticed inland behind the
immediate banks of the shore, are evident proofs of the coast being subject to
the encroachments of the sea. At noon we approached an island of very distinct
features from those of the N.W. coast. It is slightly elevated, covered with
small timber, appears very grassy, and of easy rise. Its S.W. sides in
particular are cliffy, parts of which appear argillaceous, of a ferrugineous
tinge. Rounding the points of the island we anchored off a sandy bay in 5
fms.[*]</p>
<blockquote>[* South-West Bay, of South Goulburn Island.]</blockquote>
<p>About noon I accompanied Mr. King and our second officer on shore. We landed
on a part of the beach which, from its low grassy appearance, tempted us to
conclude fresh water might be discovered near. Our boat people were directed to
make a diligent search by tracing this apparent water channel inland. I took a
range around among very lofty grasses, and the following are the most
remarkable plants I detected this afternoon. <i>Clerodendron sp.</i>, a shrub
of the habit of <i>Leea sambucina</i>, having an angular stem and bipinnated
foliage. In humid, grassy situations with the preceding plants <i>Tacca
pinnatifida</i> is very abundant, in fruit at this time, whose roots I observed
had been dug up in several spots, either by natives or some animal; and several
convolvuli, particularly a species with long white tubular corolla, an
<i>Ipomaea</i> with large cordate leaves. The rising grounds are covered with
very large fragments of stone-ironstone, (heavy, and of an iron grey colour),
which being hid from the sight by the thick high grass, renders the penetration
into the island somewhat difficult.</p>
<p>In these drier, barren, stony spots I gathered specimens of a
<i>Crotalaria</i> allied to <i>C. linifolia</i>. <i>C. sp.</i> (allied to <i>C.
anthylloides</i> Lamarck.), specimens and seeds. <i>Justicia sp.</i>, flowers
axillary and terminal, bracts elliptical, acute, mucronated, villous.
<i>Justicia sp.</i>, spike axillary and terminal, bracts ovate-lanceolate; an
ornamental slender shrub. A tree about 30 feet high of spreading irregular
growth, fruit drupaceous, one-seeded each seed having a groove on its side.
<i>Strychnos sp.</i>, in fruit, a small tree 10-12 feet high. The most general
timber, which is small, is a <i>Eucalyptus</i> from 30-35 feet high, it was not
in flower, but from its habit appears different from any I have seen before. In
exposed iron stony soils, near the edge of a perpendicular cliff, I discovered
an <i>Acacia</i> with simple very oblique half-rounded leaves, which are
5-nerved, petiole one-glanded, spike cylindrical. <i>Cyperaceae</i>, habit of
<i>Eriocaulon</i> or <i>Xyris</i> but petalless, a small gramineous plant, the
seeds having a membranaceous fimbriation round them. A very frequent plant is a
species of <i>Vitis</i>, fruit small and black. A species of <i>Kennedya</i>,
twining among the high grass, afforded me some seeds, and also a twining
<i>Clitoria</i>, with narrow, ovate, ternate leaves. <i>Pandanus spiralis</i>
has a fine effect, as well on the higher parts of the island as on the sands of
the beach. It has a caudex, frequently 10-12 feet high, which is crowned with
its spirally disposed foliage. I saw some specimens in green fruit.</p>
<p>We traced very recent impressions of naked feet on the sands, but saw no
natives, even doubting of there being any on the island at this time. Bongaree,
the native, was with me all the afternoon, and upon our return to the beach we
found the jolly boat had gone back to the cutter, but returning at sunset it
took us both off. Our people found some water, but it was brackish and in small
portions. Continuing their search they found some better, and in order to
collect it they dug a well about 6 feet deep, trusting it would be filled in
the course of the night. Native fires were observed at dusk, on the main to the
eastward of us.</p>
<p><i>28th. Saturday.</i> At an early hour Mr. King and Mr. Roe landed, to
measure a base line on the beach, and I was occupied till 8 o'clock shifting
out my specimens. I went on shore with a wooding party, intending to penetrate
some distance from the beach to ascertain the character of the botany inland.
Passing through a thickly wooded land, among lofty grass, on an iron-stony soil
and in a north westerly direction, I discovered but little variety, several I
had seen yesterday appearing more generally around me. I gathered, however, the
following specimens:--<i>Grevillea Dryandri</i> of Mr. Brown, a beautiful
spreading shrub of low stature. <i>Polygala sp.</i>, a small pigmy annual
plant. <i>Combrelaceae</i>, a shrub of the habit of <i>Sterculia</i>, with a
drupaccous acute 1-seeded fruit. <i>Sterculia sp.</i>, a dwarf strong shrub,
with large coriaceous 5-angled leaves; this plant has only some last year's
fruit on it. <i>Bidens sp.</i>, an annual plant with linear leaves.
<i>Phyllanthus sp.</i> <i>Celastrus sp.</i>, a shrub 6-8 feet high.
<i>Verbesina dichotoma</i>. <i>Grewia sp.</i>, allied to <i>G. verrucosa</i>, a
very common plant among the high grass, in flower and fruit. The
<i>Crotalaria</i> discovered yesterday, a species with simple elongated
lanceolate leaves; raceme terminal; calyx very hairy, longer than the legumen.
<i>A. Convolvulus</i>, differing but little from <i>C. medium</i>. <i>Vitis
sp.</i> I discovered this vine to-day laden with fruit. <i>Euphorbia sp.</i>, a
shrub with glossy leaves; berry red, 2 seeded. And the <i>Strychnos</i>
observed yesterday, a small tree.</p>
<p>A continuation of the same grassy, thickly wooded barren land appearing
before me after I had advanced about 2&frac12; miles inland, and not meeting
with any more plants but what were duplicates of those I had already gathered,
I made a circuit westerly to that part of the beach where our wooding party
were employed. In this route I gathered a few more plants viz:--specimens from
a tree 20 feet high, with elliptical, glossy leaves, allied to
<i>Hippomane</i>. <i>Amyris sp.</i> <i>Achyranthes sp.</i> <i>Periploca
sp.</i>, a volubilous shrubby plant. <i>Sapindus</i>, a small tree, with
oblique pinnate leaves and a terminal cyme of fruit, on the beach beneath a
cliff of marl or pipe-cIay. <i>Hibiscus ficulneus</i> is fine in flower and
fruit, of which I gathered seeds.</p>
<p>Our native, Bongaree, in his rambles on the shores of the island, made a
very valuable and seasonable discovery. He found fresh water running into a
natural basin under the cliffs, above noticed, in such abundance as to afford
us two puncheons per hour. The well dug the last evening was full this morning,
but, upon testing, it was found too bad and brackish to be drunk. Our woodmen
complained of the hard timber turning the edges of their axes, though they
found it to be hollow at heart, like some of its kindred on the Eastern coast.
I went on board to secure my specimens, which were already beginning to wither,
by the intensity of the heat. In my absence, Mr. King had gone away to a small
island about 2 miles to the southward and westward of our anchorage (and which
at my suggestion has been named Sims Island), to take a meridian altitude and
make other observations relative to the survey. He returned at 3 p.m., bringing
with him a few specimens he had noticed there, and among them a
<i>Tournefortia</i> with a compound recurved spike of white flowers,
ovate-oblong large silky leaves, and thick short succulent stem. <i>Triumfetta
sp.</i>, imperfect. A new <i>Grevillea</i>, and a suffruticose plant of the
<i>Aselepiadaceae</i>, having all the habits of <i>Hoya</i>, a stoloniferous
reclining plant; leaves as in <i>H. carnosa</i>; the flowers however are white;
corolla smooth and sweet-scented.</p>
<p>The north point of Sims Island forms a remarkable rocky elevation, named
Sanson's Head. At 4 p.m. I returned to the island on which I had employed
myself this morning, which Mr. King has entitled Goulburn Island, and made some
further discoveries in botany, in the vicinity of the depressed moist land
where we had dug the well viz:--<i>Hedysarum sp.</i> <i>Asparagus
racemosus</i>. <i>Tabernaemontana sp.</i> Tracing a beaten path made by the
natives, I observed the roots of <i>Tacca pinnatifida</i>, a plant abundant in
low shaded situations had been taken up in quantities, which tempted me to
conclude they are eaten by these Australians, as are also those of a plant of
the <i>Aroidae</i> [<i>Arum orixense</i>] by the natives about the banks of the
Hawkesbury and Nepean Rivers on the Eastern coast.</p>
<p>Observing an arborescent <i>Melaleuca</i> in flower in the hollow somewhat
below me, I was advancing towards it, when I was suddenly and agreeably
surprised by the discovery of a lagoon of fine clear water, which is so much
concealed by the high grass as not to be seen until you are at its margin. Many
fine large specimens of this <i>Melaleuca</i> were growing in this water, which
is 2&frac12;-3 feet deep. It appears to approach near <i>M. leucadendron</i>. I
discovered a <i>Nymphaea</i> covering the waters of this lagoon, of the size of
<i>N. pygmaea</i>. The flowers are white, of which I was only able to procure
two or three specimens, and no capsules were discovered. I took up some of the
roots, which are likewise small, and very deep in the stiff clayey bottom.
These I enveloped in soil, and having no other means, could only risk them,
being desirous of transporting the plant to Port Jackson, although, from our
expected detention on the coast and the subsequent voyage thence, they have but
little chance. I gathered specimens of a species of <i>Polygala</i>, of a small
<i>Euphorbia</i>; and a species of <i>Hedysarum</i>, with seeds of
<i>Tecca</i>. The sandy shores abound with a succulent plant now in flower. It
appears to be an <i>Aizoon</i>, with narrow oblong-lanceolate smooth leaves;
flowers axillary, solitary. <i>Flagellaria indica</i> is a very common plant in
confined brushwood, climbing over the whole through the medium of its
cirrhiferous (tendril bearing) foliage, and in similar situations <i>Dioscorea
bulbifera</i> has been observed, bearing axillary bulbs and small male flowers.
Finally I thought in like places I could trace something of the <i>Bignonia</i>
in a twining shrub with glossy ovate conjugate leaves, and its bark, which is
spotted, as in some species indigenous in Brazil. I, however, saw no signs of
flowers. I planted some peach stones in a deep rich soil near the lagoon. At
dusk the boat came for me, and I went off, with a specimen of the fresh water
and reported the discovery to Mr. King.</p>
<p><i>29th. Sunday.</i> Soon after noon some of the people on deck observed
five natives among the high grass on the island approaching the spot where our
party had been cutting up wood, and our tools, axes and cross-cut saws having
been rather neglectfully left there by our people, they carried all off, and
our station flags stuck up at regular distances on the beach likewise
attracting their attention were also seized. At the firing of some muskets they
fell down among the grass, but rising again they walked off with their booty
and wholly disappeared. It was suggested they might be a part of a body of
natives seen on the main yesterday, and might have crossed over in a canoe.</p>
<p>Mr. Bedwell. and five able hands were despatched in the large whale boat
round the south part of Goulburn Island to examine the little bights and
capture any canoe he might find. About 3 p.m. he returned with a very fine one,
about 17 feet long and 2 feet wide, formed of an entire piece of timber, and
sufficiently large to convey six natives from one island to another. It was
hauled up on the beach, and near it were seen 7 or 8 natives, armed. They had
an encampment of gunyas or huts on the rising ground, and several small fires
were smoking around them. It being evident this canoe had been made by persons
in possession of sharp iron tools, the circumstance created a doubt of its
being of Australian manufacture, and this doubt was not a little strengthened
by a piece of Malay rope being found attached to it. How the people became
possessed of it we know not. Captain Flinders found the natives on this coast
to the eastward great thieves, and these to the westward have this day thus far
proved their consanguinity in character with them in carrying off our wooding
tools.</p>
<p>At 4 p.m. I accompanied Mr. King to the west point, to examine the soundings
of the newly discovered watering place in order to return the vessel nearer to
it for convenience and protection to our people while occupied in taking in a
fresh supply of water. We landed to examine Bongaree's discovery, which is
under a range of perpendicular cliffs or elevated forest land. The fresh water
runs from rocky perforations near the ground into a kind of well or basin,
deepened by our people, and rendered more convenient for the purpose of filling
our casks. Oozing through the white clay it has a pale tinge, is soft but good
water. Whilst Mr. King was taking angles and bearings I examined the plants of
the overhanging range of cliffs. I gathered better specimens of a volubilous
plant of the <i>Asclepiadaceae</i>, observed yesterday in fruit. <i>Periploca
sp.</i> <i>Santalaceae</i>; <i>Exocarpus</i>, or allied to that genus; leaves
elliptical and broad; spikes axillary, crowded, shorter than the leaf; a tree
not exceeding 20 feet in height. <i>Achyranthes pungens</i>, in sterile, sandy
spots. A fine leaved <i>Casuarina</i>, with small fruit, forming a tree 30-40
feet high, on the immediate beach, afforded me some specimens and seeds. I
discovered a single specimen of a low spreading tree with a compound fruit,
perhaps of the <i>Urticaceae</i>.</p>
<p>At the extremity of our walk, a point of the island opened to us, truly
picturesque; it was covered with the <i>Pandanus</i>, with stems 20 feet high,
bearing their compound drupaceous fruit. At dusk we returned on board, and
suspecting the natives might swim off in the night and endeavour to carry oft
their canoe, we hauled it up to the davits out of their reach, had muskets
ready, and directed a good and vigilant watch to be kept. Numerous white and
black cockatoos, several pigeons, and some rich plumed parrots were observed on
the shores of the island. Among the volubilous plants seen on shore an
<i>Ipomoea</i> is very common under the cliffs. It has a long tubular corolla
of a white colour, capitated stigma, and smooth woody stem, agreeing with a
species figured by Andrews in his Botanical Repository as <i>Ipomoea
grandiflora</i>, but differing from the <i>Convolvulus grandiflorus</i> of
Linnaeus (supplement), which is described as having an arborescent pubescent
stem. At 11 p.m. our whale boat, which had been (at dusk) well secured astern,
was discovered drifting towards the shore, and suspecting the natives were
carrying her off, muskets were fired, and the jolly boat manned, well armed,
was sent off to bring her back. It appears one or more of these mischievous
natives had silently swam off to recover their canoe, but being disappointed in
not finding her within their reach, had cut through the thick painter or rope
of the whale boat, and were either towing her away or allowing her to drift on
shore.</p>
<p><i>30th. Monday.</i> Clear morning. About half past 6 a.m. we weighed anchor
and stood to the northward and westward, to a more convenient place for
watering the vessel. Our people were sent on shore to the cliff abreast of us
in the whale boat, well armed, to fill casks with water; a carronade was ready
loaded on board, and every precaution was taken on deck to protect the people,
from the assaults of the natives, of whom seven were seen early this morning,
skulking about under cover of the high grass. In a short time they were seen
running to the spot on the edge of the cliff above our watering party's heads.
A musket was fired from the cutter to warn our people of their danger. In an
instant they were assailed with a shower of large fragments of ironstone and
broken wood, which was returned by our people's muskets without effect. In this
affair two seamen were slightly bruised, and the whole embarked and came
off.</p>
<p>Another party, consisting of Mr. King, myself and three others, left the
cutter to protect the watering people by standing off so as to command the line
of the cliff's edge, and the fillng of the casks was carried on with despatch,
in peace, no natives daring to make their appearance. At noon we brought off
180 gallons. It was fortunate that I have either collected or ascertained the
greater part of the botany of the island previously, for now, in fact, I could
not venture to carry on my pursuit of flora, excepting under the protection of
a strong guard, which could not on any account be spared. The small fly is
extremely troublesome. The skins of none of us are proof against its
penetrating proboscis.</p>
<p><i>31st. Tuesday.</i> No appearance of natives. At 10 a.m. I landed with our
watering party and went to the summit of the cliffs in sight of our boat. All
was quiet, and I examined and collected the few plants around me, as well as
those of the craggy descent at its eastern extremity. On the cliff, specimens
of an annual plant of the <i>Gentianaceae</i>, <i>Exacum sp.</i> <i>Verbena
sp.</i>, a beautiful delicate blue-flowering annual plant, with linear leaves.
A small creeping <i>Portulaca</i>, with apposite orbicularly cordate carnose
leaves and terminal yellow solitary flowers, is generally dispersed over this
stony soil, with a <i>Spermacoce</i>, gathered on the 27th. In the descent,
among a confined brushwood and small trees, I gathered the following
specimens:--<i>Loranthus sp.</i>, a parasitical plant. <i>Dioscorea sp.</i>,
which appears none other than the Linnean <i>D. bulbifera</i>, originally
figured by Hermann. <i>Rubiaceae</i>, <i>Psychotria sp.</i> <i>Verbenaceae</i>,
an annual plant with pale bluish flowers. <i>Cetharexylum</i>? a tree 12-20
feet high. After a range of about three hours, with but little success I
returned to the boat, which was awaiting my arrival, and we all went on board.
The flies still continue very troublesome, so much so that some of us while
writing are obliged to wear veils. These insects scruple not to enter our eyes
and nostrils, to our very great annoyance, nor have we found the means of
wholly destroying them. They do not appear to lessen in numbers though very
many pay daily for their presumption.</p>
<p><i>1818. April 1st. Wednesday.</i> This day we completed our supply of water
for 8 weeks, but the variable winds had almost determined Mr. King not to wait
here for a supply of wood, which can easily be provided at other islands. The
cry of a native dog was heard in the course of the last night, and this morning
one was seen on the beach, prowling about for food. At 2 p.m. some natives, who
had been seen in the morning at an encampment among the high grass, were
observed in motion, and were about thirteen in number, walking briskly to the
part of the cliffs over our people's heads, evidently with mischievous
intentions, most of them being armed with long spears. A signal was hoisted at
the masthead of the cutter to warn the people beneath, and a 6 lb. shot was
fired from the cutter over the summit of the cliff, which dispersed the
natives, who finding we were ready for them, walked off altogether, and we were
no more molested by them.</p>
<p>I accompanied Mr. King and Mr. Bedwell to some Rocks called The Brothers, to
the northward and westward of our anchorage. They are bare, naked, shelving and
very irregular: a thin wiry grass in tufts on them afford a nest to seabirds,
and the only plant else was a species of <i>Cassia</i>, whose dead twiggy stems
were laden with pods, of which I gathered seeds. A bottle was left on these
rocks,[*] containing a paper stating the arrival of the vessel and the
disposition of the natives who visited the islands around.</p>
<blockquote>[* The smallest of the Goulburn Group.]</blockquote>
<p><i>2nd. Thursday.</i> Fine at 8, when we got under weigh and stood northerly
round the island. The wind was light, from the eastward, but afterwards veering
to northward, which obliged us to put about and return anchoring nearly on our
old ground. A proposal being made to visit Sims Island[*] this afternoon, I
most readily and gladly joined the party, to examine the botany of a spot
which, from Mr. King's account, might afford me much novelty, and some
interesting subjects. On the beach on which I landed I gathered specimens of a
large spreading bushy plant of the <i>Salicariae</i>, a <i>Lythrum</i>. The
nearly decayed foliage of an <i>Amaryllis</i> (probably) on the warm sands
directed me to the treasure below; the bulbs were deep in the soil and wedged
in between large immovable pieces of rock, which rendered it difficult to take
them up without bruising them. I procured 8 good roots. Ascending over rocks
and large stones to the more elevated parts of the island, I detected the
following plants:--<i>Grevillea ilicifolia</i>, a shrub 3 ft. high.
<i>Hibbertia sp.</i> <i>Bossiaea sp.</i>, I observed this plant in a less
perfect state on S. Goulburn Island. <i>Indigofera sp.</i>, a shrub with purple
flowers. <i>Pimelea involucrata</i>, a small slender plant with scarlet
flowers. <i>Haloragis sp.</i>, allied to <i>H. racemosa</i>, Labill.
<i>Psychotria sp.</i>, observed likewise on Goulburn Island. <i>Flagellaria
indica</i>, specimens in flower and fruit. <i>Diosma</i>, a shrub with linear
leaves and small flowers: <i>Sterculia sp.</i>, <i>Glycine sp.</i> I gathered
some fine specimens in fruit of the <i>Tabernaemontana</i> discovered on
Goulburn Island.</p>
<p>The <i>Cucurbitacious</i> plant <i>Cucumis</i>,[*] with a scarlet round
hisped fruit about the size of a red currant, is common, hanging over and
covering large stones. The suffruticose carnrose plant of the
<i>Asclepiadaceae</i>, of reclining habit, is frequent among rocks in barren
sandy places. It has the habit and inflorescence of <i>Hoya carnosa</i>, but
its flowers are white and smooth, and very fragrant. I gathered a specimen that
had expanding flowers, doubting of being able to preserve it. A
<i>Scaevola</i>, allied to <i>S. lobelia</i>, but differing in the division of
the calyx, was observed on the beach within the influence of the surf, forming
a large spreading shrub, with obovate glossy entire foliage. The
<i>Convolvuli</i> of the shores of Goulburn Island are likewise noticed on
those of this island, which is about three quarters of a mile in length,
rugged, covered with rocks of sandstone, shelving and perforated by the action
of the weather. The elevated parts have much pudding-stone, and the shallow
sandy soil is sprinkled with small fragments of quartz.</p>
<blockquote>[* Seaberry of Australia.]</blockquote>
<p>The centre of the island, is a grassy hollow, which in heavy rains forms a
swamp. Here, in this periodical humid situation, some fine specimens of
<i>Pandani</i> present to the eye a pleasing appearance, being now laden with
green fruit. Its western side is sandy, less stony, and productive of high
grass. I saw the <i>Tournefortia</i> before mentioned, it forms a small tree 10
feet high, of irregular but robust growth, which, with some <i>Eucalypti</i> of
small growth, not in flower, and those above mentioned, appear to be the whole
of the arbusculae of the island. Bamboo joints and broken earthen vessels,
found by our people, are indications of the Malays having visited the island.
The situation of this small but interesting island is 11&deg;38' S. lat. and
133&deg;25' E. long.</p>
<p><i>3rd. Friday.</i> Mr. King intending to land upon Sims Island to take
equal latitudes this morning gave me an opportunity of examining those parts I
could not visit yesterday. At 11 a.m. I landed on the S.E. side, where the
rocks are covered with the <i>Vitis</i> and some <i>Convolvuli</i>, of which
one small woolly specimen, being in capsule, furnished me with seeds.</p>
<p>The arurldinaceous stemmed <i>Flagellaria</i> is frequent in fruit, climbing
over all other plants. Among some rugged loose stones, sunk in the sand, I
discovered a few more bulbs of the same kind kind as those discovered
yesterday, and as I had promised to meet the boat on the opposite. side of the
island in half an hour, I could only allow myself time to take up a dozen fine
roots. <i>Guilandina bonducella</i> (the nuts are called the Bonduc nut) and a
species of <i>Boehmeria</i> with ternate leaves, unequally round, obtuse,
nerved, were shrubs on the beach; and of the latter I gathered specimens in
fruit.</p>
<p>In crossing this island from S, to N., I detected the following new
specimens: <i>Daviesia sp.</i>, a twiggy shrub. <i>Grevillea ilicifolia</i>.
Also seeds of a <i>Solanum</i>, a shrub with oblique tomentose leaves, large
blue Cowers' and pale yellow berries, containing shining black seeds. Beneath
the shade of small trees of <i>Metrosideros</i> in fruit the <i>Amaryllis</i>
was observed in small patches and with the <i>Grevillea</i> seems to be
scattered profusely over the island. Soon after noon I had passed hastily over
to the beach, where the boat was awaiting my arrival. Embarked and returned on
board. N.B. I could have wished to have spent the whole of this afternoon on
the island, but it was necessary the boat should return to the cutter with Mr.
King at 1, and much inconvenience would have resulted had the crew of the
whaleboat been sent in the evening from the distant anchorage to the island to
take me off, when the vessel required the whole of our little company either on
board or elsewhere.</p>
<p><i>4th. Saturday.</i>[*] At half past 8 we got under weigh, with a light air
from the southward. Attending to my specimens and drying seeds on deck. At 6,
shortened sail and dropped an anchor in 10 fms.</p>
<blockquote>[* On this day the "Mermaid" left South-West Bay.]</blockquote>
<p><i>5th. Sunday.</i> Early this morning we weighed anchor and stood off for
the island seen some days ago to the northward of the one from whence we had
taken in a stock of water, and being with it, called Goulburn Islands, this, by
way of distinction, is called North Goulburn Island. At 8 a.m. we tacked, and
in half an hour came to with the best bower in 6 fms., muddy bottom. In the
afternoon I went on shore with Mr. King and our second officer; we landed at
the south point of the island which is rather rocky, being connected with a
long chain of reefs running parallel at some distance with the beach. The,
<i>Scaevola</i> allied to <i>S. lobelia</i> is very abundant on the shore, in
flower and young fruit. I passed over a narrow strip of low land, chiefly sand,
and gathered in patches of undershrub and brushwood the following
plants:--<i>Smilax sp.</i> <i>Verbenaceae</i>, <i>Dicrastyles</i>, allied to
<i>Premna</i>, a shrub of procumbent trailing habit, flowers spiked, blue.
<i>Diadelphia</i>, allied to <i>Psoralea</i>, a strong scented shrub.
<i>Diospyros sp.</i>, a tree 30 feet high. <i>Solanum sp.</i>, a shrubby smooth
plant, with occasional tetandrous flowers, and small orange fruit, allied to
<i>S. nigrum</i>. The <i>Tournefortia</i> of Sims Island with other plants of
the South Goulburn Island were observed this afternoon, particularly
<i>Tabernaemontana sp.</i>, before noticed, of which I gathered seeds.</p>
<p>At the back of the beach is a low grassy hollow, a marsh in the rainy season
but at this time dry. <i>Pandanus spiralis</i> is here abundant, and the grass,
which is of gigantic growth, appears to be a <i>Bromus</i>, of which I gathered
some specimens. The shores, although rocky in some places, have likewise some
fine clear spots for dragging the seine, and they are lined with fish,
particularly the mullet, whence the name of the bay in which we are at anchor.
Some fine large specimens of <i>Casuarina</i>, of arborescent growth, on the
beach, will afford us some good firewood.</p>
<p><i>6th. Monday.</i> Having attended to my plants, I landed with a party who
were sent to cut down <i>Casuarina</i>. Crossing a hollow sandy flat parallel
with the shore, I rose to some land entirely covered by the high grass, and of
a much better soil, over which some <i>Eucalypti</i> of small growth were
thinly dispersed. In this situation, among the grass, I gathered a few
specimens, viz:--<i>Drosera sp.</i> <i>Stackhousia sp.</i>, a delicate plant.
<i>Verbena sp.</i>, an annual plant. <i>Crotalaria sericea</i>, a small
suffruticose plant with scarlet flowers. <i>Glycine sp.</i>, this specimen
agrees much with <i>G. caribaea</i> of Jacquin, a twining plant. The soil in
which these plants were discovered is of a loamy character, with a small
proportion of sand, and being rendered fit by the rains of this morning, for
the recaption of some European seeds I had with me. I sowed many peach stones
and several apricots.</p>
<p>About noon the day was well cleared up, and the sun became very powerful and
oppressive to the wooding people, one of whom was so much overcome by the
intense heat of the beach, as to be obliged to return on board-sick. Some water
was discovered in a ditch on the north end of the bay in which we are
anchored--in a small quantity. And five gunyas or huts were discovered near the
beach, of depressed form, made of large sticks, so cut and placed as to rest on
one another at the points and form the top of the hut. The interstices were
filled up with dry bark and dead grass, and the whole was covered with a thick
coat of sand, forming at once a dep&ocirc;t for provisions and a safe and dry
retreat from bad weather.</p>
<p>It has been doubted whether they were built by Malays or natives; some
bamboos and nets found near them suggest the probability of the former visiting
the island and encamping on its shores to dry and prepare their cargoes of
trepang for transportation. We, had left the shore for the cutter but a short
period, when seven natives and a dog were observed passing very leisurely over
the spot on which we had been clearing wood, and continuing their route to the
south point on which we had landed yesterday. Although very hot on shore, the
thermometer on board showed nothing unusual, and the small pocket one I usually
carry with me I found broke by some accident upon taking it out to ascertain
the temperature of the beach.</p>
<p><i>7th. Tuesday.</i> I went on shore with the wooding party, taking with me
an assortment of vegetable seeds, which I had procured at Port Jackson for the
purposes of sowing in favourable situations on the coasts. Of fruits I sowed
the following. Peach stones--a considerable quantity-and apricots and lemon
seeds, and of vegetables, marrowfat peas, long-podded beans, scarlet runners,
large homed carrots, parsley, celery, parsnips, cabbage, lettuces, endive and
spinach. Of ornamental plants, broad-leaved Virginian tobacco, sweet and
everlasting peas, Spanish broom and <i>Astragalus falcatus</i>, (plants lately
introduced into the colony). A cocoa nut, found on the sands near the watering
place at the other island, I planted near the beach. The weather cleared up
about noon and a scorching sun succeeded. In the afternoon I took a walk
towards the north point of the island. In a considerable confined mass of small
trees, densely overrun and matted together with scandent and volubilous plants,
of which a species of <i>Vitis</i> is most predominant, I discovered
<i>Psychotria sp.</i>, a small slender tree with orange berries. <i>Eugenia
sp.</i>, parasitical on a rough leaved <i>Ficus</i>. I also discovered a
remarkable species of <i>Loranthus</i>. <i>Abrus precatorius</i> is now in
flower and fruit, covering the brushwood with its hanging ornamental seeds. No
appearance of emu or kangaroo or other quadruped (native dog excepted) has been
noticed.</p>
<h4>GOULBURN ISLANDS To RAFFLES BAY, 8-15 APRIL, 1818</h4>
<p><i>8th. Wednesday.</i> Repapered my green specimens and anxiously await
settled fine weather to expose them to the air on deck.</p>
<p><i>9th. Thursday.</i> During the last night we had so drifted from North
Goulburn Island that it was scarcely distinguishable at daybreak. I availed
myself of the general fine appearance of the day and placed all my damp and
green plants on deck to dry, the late damp and unsettled weather had benefited
them nothing. About three strange sails were observed on our lee bow between
Sims Island and the main, and were soon discovered to be Malay proas, which
were beating up towards that Island, and as we advanced towards them others
were distinguished having Dutch colours. We hoisted our ensign and pendant at
the mast-head, and examined the state of a carronade, ready loaded on the
starboard quarter. They anchored in the bay near Sanson's Head (the N. point of
Sims Island), and were a small fleet of 16 sail. Most valuable information
might be obtained from these Asiatics as to their seasons of fishing and
detention on this coast, the success of their fisheries, the value of their
cargoes, their opinion of the natives, could we have conversed with them
through the medium of an interpreter. Our small numbers suggested the necessity
of keeping at a respectable and safe distance from individuals whose numbers
with ours appear to bear a proportion of about 8 to one. Mr. King steered away
to the westward. At dusk several native fires were seen on the main.</p>
<p><i>10th. Friday.</i> About 6 a.m. several proas were observed to windward.
We trimmed sails and bore up W.N.W. At past 7 o'clock the whole of the Malay
fleet were seen bearing down upon us, we however continued running along the
coast, not appearing to notice them, and about 9 a.m., as they were passing
under the land, we hoisted an Ensign and Pendant, and they shewed Dutch
colours. It was the intention of Mr. King, afterallowing these Malays to pass
him to the westward, to steer into a bay or bight observed in the land, to
examine it, as it appeared of some moment. The proas however ran in themselves
anchored and thus debarred us from entering. At 11 a.m. the vessel was put
about; we passed the Malays steering westerly and at half past 12 we anchored
in 6&frac12; fms. between the main and some islands.[*] The land of the main is
low, but in parts rising gradually to grassy thickly wooded ranges, apparently
of <i>Eucalyptus</i>. We have had fine breezes favourable for drying my
plants.</p>
<blockquote>[* Between Cape Cockburn and the south extreme of Croker
Island.]</blockquote>
<p><i>11th. Saturday.</i> The proas that anchored in the bay yesterday were
observed standing down towards us, no doubt actuated by curiosity to know what
we were and the object of our voyage. We immediately weighed anchor, made sail,
and stood to the N.N.E., the wind being scant from S.E. by S. Some of the proas
passed within 50 yards of us, and on the deck of each from 20 to 30 persons
were observed. Seeing we were prepared for them they contented themselves with
calling to us (in Malay language), frequently repeating Macassar, Trepang,
etc.</p>
<p>Their departure from the bay gave us an opportunity of examining it. We
accordingly steered for it, but found the whole (although spacious) so shoaly
as not to be worth any consideration. We anchored at half past I near our last
night's ground--a little to the westward of it.</p>
<p><i>12th. Sunday.</i> The bay formed by the trending of the mainland, in
which we are now at anchor, has been entitled by Mr. King, Mountnorris Bay.
Prayers having been read to the cutter's company, Mr. King left the vessel at
11 a.m., accompanied by Mr. Roe and myself, for an island to the westward of
our anchorage, which has received the title. of Copeland.[*] We landed on its
south side, and from its similarity to those recently visited I was but little
impressed with ideas of discovering new plants on it. Copeland Island is
remarkable for its compact rotundity and although of small size is high above
the level of the water. The basis is coral, above is sandstone, and the soil of
an ironstony character.</p>
<blockquote>[* Copeland Islet, 125 feet high, toward the head of Mountnorris
Bay, was used by the Malays for boiling and drying trepang.]</blockquote>
<p>I discovered the following very interesting plants:--<i>Bignonia
filiformis</i>, a small tree of the habit of <i>Hakea</i>, exposed situations.
<i>Hibiscus radiatus</i>, an annual plant, on sloping grassy banks.
<i>Arthropodium sp.</i>, barren exposed spots. <i>Velleia sp.</i>, peduncles
filiform, a delicate and tender procumbent plant. <i>Velleia sp.</i>, flowers
yellow; leaves entire, lanceolate. <i>Terminalia</i> or <i>Chuncoa sp.</i>, a
shrub a foot high; leaves obovate, smooth; spike erect; capsule ellipsoid.
<i>Crotalaria sp.</i>, habit of <i>Hedysarum</i>. <i>Eucalyptus sp.</i>, a
shrub 8 ft. high. <i>Metrosideros</i> or <i>Angophora sp.</i> <i>Hakea sp.</i>,
a shrub, in exposed cliffy situations with the preceding. <i>Polygala sp.</i>,
a pygmy plant, among grass. The most remarkable and singular <i>Acacia
dolabriformis</i>, observed on Goulburn Islands, here enabled me to gather fine
flowering specimens. I procured seeds of two species of <i>Convolvulus</i>. The
lat. of the small island is 11&deg;27' S., and about 132&deg;54' E. long.
Copeland Island, like others on this coast, has much fresh water after rains,
which is indicated by its deep furrowed rocky gullies, conducting the water
into the sea on the south side.</p>
<p><i>13th. Monday.</i> Getting under weigh we made sail; at 8 a.m. we shoaled
water very fast, and immediately hauled to N.E., and scraped along the ground
in 1&frac34; fms., hard sandy bottom. Tacking again, we shoaled to 10 feet in
stays and took bearings of our perilous situation. Clearing ourselves by
getting into deeper water, we shortened sail, to meet a squall which gave us
some small showers at intervals. At half past 4 we came to an anchor in
11&frac34; fms., between the main and an island (named by Mr. King Darch
Island),[*] having with difficulty found some safe ground to depend upon during
the night. Native fires were seen abreast of us on the mainland, in the
night.</p>
<blockquote>[* "After my esteemed friend, Thos. Darch, Esq., of the
Admiralty."--King.]</blockquote>
<p><i>14th. Tuesday.</i> We left our situation off Darch Island at an early
hour and steered N.E. by N. We sailed along a coast, generally westerly, over a
bottom very uneven, varying from 5 to 11 fms. At noon we passed a low sandy
island covered with small brushwood, and hauled south, and at 3 P.m. we
anchored in 5 fms. Mr. King proposed to visit a rock on the shore, in order to
take some cross bearings, and I accompanied him, with our second officer. The
rock on which we landed was covered chiefly with a species of <i>Lythrum</i>,
of which I gathered seeds. The <i>Vitis</i>, some <i>Convolvuli</i>, and the
<i>Smilax</i> of North Goulburn Island, are all blended together and form a
secure cover to pigeons and other birds that were disturbed on our landing. On
the main shores <i>Hibiscus</i> (= <i>Fugosia</i>) <i>punctatus</i> is frequent
and rich in flower, and among plants common on Goulburn Islands I discovered
the following in sandy ridges above the beach. <i>Glycine sp.</i>, a fetid,
shrubby plant; <i>Achyranthes sp.</i>, allied to <i>A. corymbosa</i>. A small
spreading tree, which perhaps may be of the <i>Microsperma</i>, the
<i>Eugenia</i> of Goulburn Island I have observed of arborescent growth 25-30
ft. high. The <i>Eucalypti</i> are the prevailing timber, of ordinary size and
chiefly of the species already mentioned. In these forest lands, elevated above
the beach 30 feet at least, I discovered a Fan Palm, <i>Corypha</i> (=
<i>Livistona</i>) <i>australis</i>, about 10 feet high, with remains of the
flowering branch. And I gathered the fruit of another palm (probably rising to
the height Of 40 feet), the fronds are pinnate and the fruit much smaller than
that of <i>Areca catechu</i>, and red. From the ground I gathered some fruit
beneath a tree 40 or 50 feet high. Perhaps in these solitary shades nothing
exceeds the beauty of a splendid <i>Grevillea</i>, forming a slender tree,
varying in height from 8-14 feet. It belongs to Mr. Brown's section,
<i>Cycloptera</i>, of that genus.</p>
<p>The soil of this forest land is rich, of some depth, reddish in colour,
having a small proportion of sand, with much decayed vegetable matter, in which
I planted about a score of peach stones. The rocky shores abound with the large
<i>Scaevola</i>, laden with white drupes. A snug picturesque bay is formed by
the trending in of the line of coast at this particular spot, but unfortunately
being of no depth could be of no use to shipping as an anchoring ground; from
the numbers of the Areca above referred to, scattered on the slopes of the land
near the beach, it has received the name of Palm Bay. Our people (on board) saw
three natives making towards us. We, however, only noticed the impressions of
their feet on the sands. Some doubts have arisen whether the land is an island
or part of the main. From its appearance as laid down on the charts it is
supposed to be an island of large dimensions. At dusk we returned on board.</p>
<p><i>15th. Wednesday.</i> In the afternoon I joined Mr. King in an excursion
to a point of the shore bearing S.W. from our anchorage, from whence Mr. King
expected he would be enabled to draw some conclusion what this island or main
might prove to be. As we sailed to the point several fine small bights opened
to us where vessels might ride in safety almost land-locked, and a deep bay or
mouth of a strait[*] presented itself, through which a strong tide ran, tending
to convince us that this land is an extensive island. Mr. King set some high
hills distant in Mountnorris Bay, but the closing of the day would not allow
further remarks to be made. On the rising ground above the beach on which I
landed the plants were nearly the same as observed yesterday. I gathered some
fine specimens of the new <i>Grevillea</i>, whose brilliant orange flowers are
very conspicuous in the darker shades of these elevated Eucalyptian woods. Also
the following:--<i>Verbesina sp.</i>, leaves lanceolate; flowers yellow,
axillary, solitary. A small brushy plant of the habit of <i>Xerotes</i>, with a
terminal capitulated inflorescence; and a blue flowered <i>Spermacoce</i>,
before noticed. No palms were observed this afternoon, but <i>Pandanus</i> is
in great abundance. A deep bay formed from the point at which we landed and
running in deep to the northward and eastward is called Raffles Bay, in honour

<h4>RAFFLES BAY, 16-18 APRIL, 1818</h4>
<p><i>16th. Thursday.</i> This morning, early, some Malay proas were seen to
the southward, standing under easy sail to the N.W. We therefore continued at
anchor till late, watching their motions. They were standing off the strait
seen yesterday, and from the occasional tacking disposition of some canoes it
was inferred that they were waiting for others. At 8 we weighed anchor and made
sail, with the wind from the east. The doubt as to what were the real
intentions of these Malays induced Mr. King to lay to about 11 and hoist our
Pendant and Ensign, in order if they were disposed to communicate in friendly
manner with us they might come off in a canoe. They, however, took no notice of
us.</p>
<p>It was deemed prudent rather than stand on towards the Malays, to put back
to our last anchorage and allow them time to pass before us westerly. We
therefore returned and anchored near the spot we occupied last night. It is
rather an unfortunate circumstance having fallen in with this squadron, as our
necessary caution and diffidence, arising from the smallness of our numbers,
prevent our continuing the survey where they are, and nothing can be gained
from running before them westerly, because in that case they would be
continually in our rear, to our annoyance. About 7 p.m., suspecting the Malays
might be tempted to visit us in the night, we left anchorage and stood off to
the northward and westward 2 or 3 miles, and again anchored. This cautious step
of Mr. King may be deemed the more necessary as it is a known fact that no
dependence can be placed in the friendly assurances ssurances of this
treacherous people, where numbers would soon overpower our most strenuous and
active efforts.</p>
<p><i>17th. Friday.</i> The proas were observed in motion, standing westerly
out of the strait. Mr. King determined if possible to obtain an interview with
them this day and present the Malay letter he had received from Sir T. Raffles
to the captain of any proa with whom we might communicate. About half past 9,
sixteen proas, under a press of sail, were distinctly seen, exclusive of small
canoes, running close under the opposite shore of the strait. Approaching them
within a mile, having a white flag at the masthead, we lay to, in hopes they
would see our desire of an amicable interview. Fifteen proas passed us at 10,
and the last being considerably behind the rest of the squadron we bore up
towards him, and in half an hour came close under his counter, and hailing the
people on board, made signs that we wished to communicate with them, showing
them the letter. They referred us to the Commodore of the squadron before them,
and would not heave to, to allow us to go on board their proa. Being thus
disappointed, we tacked the vessel, and the proa continued her course N.
westerly, after the rest of the squadron. At noon we anchored off Raffles
Bay[*] and took a meridian altitude for our latitude. In the afternoon I went
with Mr. King and the second officer to examine the bay, whose depth is about 4
miles, and width from point to point about 6. The extremity is bounded for the
most part by mangroves through which some whitish low cliffs are seen bounding
the slightly elevated forest-land in the background.</p>
<blockquote>[* Raffles Bay, west of Croker Island, penetrates five miles into
the mainland here known as Coburg Peninsula.]</blockquote>
<p>At one of these cliffs where we landed I examined the plants in its environs
with some little success. The small Fan-palm is very frequent; its caudex here
is from 5 to 8 feet; the fronds are not large, generally extending about 18
inches and inserted on an aculeated rachis. I gathered specimens of it in
flower and fruit, which are small black ovate drupes. <i>Hibiscus
punctatus</i>, closely allied to <i>H. Patersonius</i> and <i>Monoecia
Hexandria</i>, a shrub with apposite elliptical leaves. <i>Leguminosae</i>, a
tree with spreading branches and compressed legumen. <i>Diospyros sp.</i>, of
Goulburn Island is here very strong. On the edge of the cliff I discovered a
small tree with lactescent woody branches, leaves lanceolate, verticillate,
glossy, and white beneath. I suspect it may be an <i>Euphorbia</i> or one of
the Asclepiadaceae; it was not in flower or fruit. At sunset we returned on
board, having ascertained the shape of the bay, its inlets, etc., and made
other observations relative to its survey. Our people discovered some running
water of a good quality, of which they filled a bareca.</p>
<p><i>18th. Salurday.</i> At 11 a.m. a boat with casks was sent to the watering
place discovered yesterday, and I embraced the opportunity and landed through
this medium. I took a walk to a water-course discovered by our people
yesterday, which I found to be about 12 feet wide, very shallow, of fine clear
fresh water, the drainings of the higher lands. It cannot, however, be turned
to any account in point of watering a vessel, the approach to it by boats being
entirely obstructed by large bodies of dense arborescent mangroves, so very
prevalent on the north coast. I gathered seeds and some specimens of a plant of
the habit of <i>Leea sambucina</i>, strong on these damp lands. In the
forest-land I detected another <i>Grevillea</i>, a small tree 12-16 feet high.
It appears to be <i>G. heliosperma</i> of Mr. Brown. A shrub of very small
foliage, habit of <i>Thuya</i>, but whose imperfect flowers proved it to be a
second species of our Port Jackson <i>Calythrix</i>, is frequent on the exposed
edges of the cliff. I detected a species of <i>Celastrus</i> in fruit, a
slender tree 30 feet high. In the dry barren ironstony soil of the cliff a
delicate little <i>Stylidium</i> was very plentifully in flower. I found some
good soil in the forest land distant from the beach, but it appears subject to
inundation from the rains descending upon it during the wet season, signs of
which were, on the herbage and leaves of the trees. Fires of the natives were
seen on the main at night.</p>
<h4>PORT ESSINGTON AND POPHAM BAY, 19-26 APRIL, 1818.</h4>
<p>19th. Sunday. About 9 we got under weigh and pursued a course N. by W. The
line of the coast continues very irregular, point after point opening to the
view. Passing several small bays[*] guarded by rocks and dangerous chains of
breakers, we were, towards evening, off a fine handsome bay, trending in very
considerably, whose shores are frequently, or in parts, cliffy and picturesque,
and whose natural beauty is not a little shown off by the thick green woods of
<i>Eucalyptus</i> stretching to the verge of these eminences; sandy beaches
alternate with those of mud and dense stretches of mangroves. Wore ship and run
into the port and about 6 p.m., we anchored in 4 fms., about a quarter of a
mile from a perpendicular red cliff. Evening cloudy, with appearance of rain. A
few drops fell about 8 p.m. Native dogs were howling on the shores near us in
the night.</p>
<blockquote>[* The "Mermaid" passed round Smith Point, the east side of the
entrance to Port Essington.]</blockquote>
<p><i>20th. Monday.</i> Fine and clear. At 7 o'clock I landed under the cliff
with Mr. King,[*] having previously got the boat aground and with some
difficulty hauled her to the beach. Within the reach of the tide I observed a
tree of the mangrove character. It was showing flower buds, and appears to be
the Linnaean <i>Rhizophora caseolaris</i>, or <i>Sonneratia acida</i> of Willd:
On the cliff little or no variation takes place, either in the soil or
productions of Croker's Island or Raffles Bay.</p>
<blockquote>[* "At the mouth of a small salt-water inlet."--King.]</blockquote>
<p>I, however, gathered specimens of a species of <i>Pleurandra</i> [=
<i>Hibbertia</i>], a low spreading shrub. Numerous recent impressions of the
natives (and native dogs) were traced on the sands, and their fresh fires, at
which they had been very lately roasting quantities of cockles, tended to
suggest to us our presence in this bay had precipitately driven them from their
repasts. Shifting our berth southerly, we anchored at 11 a.m. off the entrance
of some harbours in this port.[*] In the afternoon I accompanied Mr. King and
Mr. Roe to a cliff abreast of the vessel, and while they were occupied in
taking bearings I ranged round in the wooded land, but found chiefly duplicates
of the plants I had seen before. However, I added the following specimens to my
collection. <i>Indigofera sp.</i> On the immediate shores I discovered a
spreading tree with vermilion coloured flowers. This tree perhaps is <i>Cordia
sebestena</i> [= <i>C. speciosa</i>] originally figured by Dillenius. A
fine-leaved <i>Bidens</i> furnished me with seeds. In some close thickets on
the beach I distinguished <i>Guilandina bonduc</i> [= <i>G. bonducella</i>],
and a species of <i>Rhamnus</i>, with elongated branches, twining among other
plants, rendering these brushes the more intricate; also a species of
<i>Sterculia</i>, observed on Goulburn Island, with large 5-lobed leaves and
old capsules, which assumes on the grassy point land here the same robust
habit. The mark of natives were observed on the trees.</p>
<blockquote>[* Having got under weigh, King steered for a narrow opening at the
bottom of the port; after anchoring at its entrance, he entered the inner
harbour of Port Essington, where he spent some days off Middle
Head.]</blockquote>
<p><i>21st. Tuesday.</i> It being the intention of Mr. King to remain at anchor
the whole of this day, an excursion was planned to examine the west harbour of
this port, with a view of ascertaining its general indentations, although from
the prevalence of mangroves on its shores it cannot be of any consideration.
Mr. Roe, second officer, was sent on this survey, and I accompanied him, to
collect any new plants the shores on which we should land might afford me. We
left the cutter at half past 6 and rowed down the east side to a spit of sand
which runs nearly over to the western shore, leaving only a small channel to
pass to the bottom of the harbour. Landing on this spit I amused myself on the
beach while our officer was otherwise engaged. I entered a close confined
thicket, where I gathered several fine specimens:--<i>Growler sp.</i>, a
slender tree with horizontal branches, allied to <i>G. mallococca</i>.
<i>Didimeria</i> (<i>Correa rufa</i>), a volubilous plant with cordate leaves.
<i>Diospyros sp.</i>, a slender shrub.</p>

<h4>PORT ESSINGTON (FROM A CHART SENT HOME BY SIR J. G. BREMER)</h4>
</center>
<p>The sandy shores afforded me seeds of a <i>Boehmeria</i>, before discovered
on Sims Island, and some fine flowering specimens of <i>Cordia sebestena</i>,
very abundant on the beach at the bottom of this harbour. <i>Abrus
precatorius</i> [the black-tipped red seeds of which are known as crab's eyes]
is frequent in the brushy thickets at the back of the beach; and the
<i>Strychnos</i> of South Goulburn Island, and the <i>Psychotria</i> bearing
orange fruit, more sparingly. An <i>Erythrina</i>-looking plant with ternate,
rhomboid leaves and aculeated petioles, a small tree, is rare in open grassy
sub-humid situations, with <i>Pandanus spiralis</i>. Beneath the shade of a
large specimen of the <i>Cordia</i>, I found the bones of a human being, most
probably a native.[*] The skull and jawbones were partly perfect, they wanted
some teeth--those that remained in the jaw were entire and in good condition.
Leg bones and one of the ribs were discovered, all of which were carefully
taken on board and delivered to Mr. King.</p>
<blockquote>[* "At the bottom of the western basin."--King.]</blockquote>
<p>Departing from this shore, and having examined some salt water inlets
bounded by mangroves 40 feet high, we returned towards the vessel up the
western shore, landing at the base of a steep white cliff, the elevated
forest-land of which furnished me with several new plants. <i>Hovea
lanceolata</i>, a twiggy plant, seldom exceeding 18 inches in height. <i>Zieria
sp.</i>, a slender shrub. <i>Tremandra sp.</i>, a shrubby plant, habit of
<i>Bossiaea</i>. <i>Crotalaria stenophylla</i>. <i>Calythrix miciophylla</i>,
first observed in Raffles Bay, a delicate conspicuous shrub; and <i>Haemodorum
sp.</i>, with long narrow leaves.[*] <i>Acacia dolabriformis</i>, and another
species with plain leaves are extremely fine in flower, and tempted me to
gather some duplicate specimens. Besides the palms before mentioned, found in
this prolific spot of Australian botany, I discovered <i>Cycas circinalis</i>,
a sago palm, of which I saw both male and female, about 10 feet high, and the
latter laden with fruit. The soil has nothing to recommend it, and the
Eucalyptian timber is small, but not in flower. Traces of natives were observed
on the trees and some baskets were found rather neatly made, supposed to be of
the foliage sheaths embracing the stems of the <i>Pandanus spiralis</i>.
<i>Sonneratia acida</i> was seen growing in deep salt water.</p>
<blockquote>[* A Yam eaten by the natives.]</blockquote>
<p><i>22nd. Wednesday.</i> To complete the survey of another harbour in this
port Mr. King and Mr. Roe left the cutter at 8 a.m., and I accompanied them. We
landed at a small white cliff, composed chiefly of a crumbling gritty soft
sandstone, with a dry indurated red pigment. In a range I took in the
forest-land above the cliff, I did not detect an individual new plant. A
delicate leaved <i>Bauhinia</i> was found in luxuriant growth, but not in
flower, on the sides of the cliff beneath were some large specimens of
<i>Cordia sebestena</i>. Leaving these slimy shores, we landed at the eastern
point of the harbour, where I added one specimen to my collection viz. a
species of <i>Achyranthes</i>, very frequent on the low sterile sands of the
point. It was very remarkable and it furnished much matter for conjecture that,
upon landing, a tree of a species of <i>Casuarina</i> was discovered, with the
branches and head cut away with a sharp iron instrument, as if intended for a
mark, as the branches so lopped off were not taken away for any use, but
remained under the tree; and at a short distance from the beach several trees
were cut down. Whether the Malays or the French have visited this sandy point
is a matter of doubt among us. A good meridian altitude being very essential to
the survey of this port, we crossed its entrance to a rocky point to take it,
being about noon. At the back of the sandy ridge bounding the beach, the land
is ordinary and thick wooded. A <i>Eugenia</i> is now frequent, a tree 20 ft.
high, in fruit. It afforded me some ripe seeds. I gathered specimens from a
tree 16-20 ft. high, with leaves like <i>Melastoma</i>, and a one-seeded
drupaceous fruit. <i>Celastrus sp.</i>, a tree 30 ft. high, of slender growth.
<i>Convolvulus sp.</i>, a prostrate plant with small blue flowers.
<i>Didimeria</i> [= <i>Correa</i>] <i>sp.</i> <i>Phlomis sp.</i> <i>Ceanothus
sp.</i>, a tree of strong growth, 25-30 ft. high, frequently observed on the
islands of this coast, but never seen in flower or before in the present state
of capsule. As a proof that these shores are visited by natives we found a
spear about 7&frac12; ft. long, ingeniously pointed with a long triangular
fragment of red granite, very hard and of a close fine texture. A canoe of
singular formation was discovered by one of our people on the beach--almost
buried in the sand--made of bark and sewn together at the ends, and about
13&frac12; feet long. Our lat. is 11&deg;17'31" S.</p>
<p><i>23rd. Thursday.</i> This morning we got under weigh and beat to the
entrance of the port, and anchored in 4 fms., in a bay at 10 a.m., on its
western side. I landed with Mr. King about 11 o'clock at a cliffy point. The
sterile stony soil of this eminence is covered with <i>Stylidium
absinthmoides</i>, some of which were forming capsules. A tree of ordinary
size, common on all the islands and mainland of this coast, and which I could
never detect in flower, furnished me with a specimen in fruit, which is oval,
crowned with a persistent 8-cleft tubular calyx, as in <i>Gardenia</i>.</p>
<p>In the afternoon I accompanied Mr. King and Mr. Roe to examine the bay off
which we are at anchor and which has received the name of Knockers.[*] We had 4
or 5 fms., and a good bottom to the extremity of the bay, where a saltwater
inlet, having the appearance of a rivulet opening to us, we entered to examine
it. ft was near high water, and we had 2 and 2&frac12; fms. at its mouth, which
is about 50 yards wide. We soon found that it divided and formed channels
insulating large patches of arborescnt mangroves. Following the leading branch
through its windings, we advanced until it became impossible to work the oars,
and finally were obliged to stop, the channel being completely closed by the
encroachments of mangroves 40 feet high . With some difficulty we put the boat
about, to return, and we passed an opening or two in this in this Rhizophorean
forest, which allowed us to be satisfied that a great extent of flat is
inundated after this manner, affording a fine soil and nursery for the growth
and luxuriant densityof these maritime woods.</p>
<blockquote>[* In an inlet between Curlew and Oyster Points.]</blockquote>
<p>In a moment we were most suddenly surprised by the yells and shouts of
natives, who were in the mangroves, and immediately we made every preparation
to meet them in this contained channel, discharging some muskets merely to
intimidate them. They seemed determined to annoy and intercept us, and and
while we were winding round to its mouth or outlet into the bay, they took a
straight course through the mangroves and awaited our passing out of this
disagreeable opening, when we were assailed with stones and spears with granite
heads. None, fortunately, touched us, although one struck the boat and others
flew over us and one passed between the midship oarsmen. This unjustifiable
outrageous attack was quickly returned with a volley of shot from our muskets,
and perhaps with some effect. We immediately got clear out into the bay, some
of the natives still following us on the main shore.</p>
<p>On our way to the cutter, observing a canoe among some mangroves on the
beach, we, by way of retaliation, pulled in there and towed her off. In it we
found some waddies and hand clubs of weight, with a quantity of live cockles,
very lately procured and probably for the evening's meal. The canoe was of one
piece of bark, its extreme length was 18 feet, and 22 to 24 inches in width.
Its ends were sewed up with pieces of cane, and a pole on each side of its
gunwales was lashed to the bark to support and strengthen its sides. Some cross
pieces of inner bark, laid across inside, rendered it more firm and
substantial.[*]</p>
<blockquote>[* A similar canoe was found by King at Blue Mud Bay, Gulf of
Carpentaria. At Blomfield Rivulet, at Endeavour River, Cape Tribulation, the
canoes seen were all hollowed out of trees.]</blockquote>
<p>Among these mangroves I gathered specimens of a species of <i>Bruguiera</i>,
appearing to differ from <i>B. gymnorhiza</i> in having a red calyx. It has the
habit of some <i>Magnoliae</i>. This large and spacious port in which we have
been since the evening of the 19th, is called Port Essington, whose harbours
afford shelter and protection to shipping, but the land being so deeply overrun
with mangroves, and the want of fresh water, render it useless for agricultural
purposes. The situation of this point is about 11&deg;16' S. lat., 132&deg;22'
E. long.</p>
<p><i>24th. Friday.</i> At half past 9 we got under weigh and stood towards the
port entrance, re-anchoring off a low rocky point in 5&frac34; fms.[*] Mr. King
went on shore for a few moments, to take some observations, and a singular rock
there, in the shape of a table of large dimensions, suggested a name for the
point. <i>Scaevola sp.</i>, allied to <i>S. lobelia</i>, covers Table
Point,[**] but no other plant was observed here of any moment. In the afternoon
a canoe was seen near Table Point, but no natives were observed. In the squall
of the evening she drifted towards the cutter, and a boat was sent to bring her
alongside, when she was hoisted on board. She is the length and model of the
canoe captured yesterday, but of more recent construction.</p>
<blockquote>[* "A little within Point Smith."--King.]</blockquote>
<blockquote>[* Table Head is 7&frac12; miles S.S.E. of Point
Smith.]</blockquote>
<p><i>25th. Saturday.</i> To prove to the natives who (for ought we know to the
contrary might be watching us) that we were peaceably disposed, the canoe was
lowered and towed on shore again. In her we put some old iron, such as spike
nails, chisels of kinds, a tomahawk, etc., for the use of her owners and she
was hauled up on the bank out of the reach of the tide. At 8 a.m. we weighed,
made sail, and stood out of Port Essington. Clearing the point of entrance, we
sailed westerly along the coast, which is irregular and full of small trendings
and projecting points, of which bearings were taken. Some Malay proas were
observed at anchor in shore, and some tents or bamboo huts were observed on the
beach.</p>
<p>About 2 o'clock p.m. a mangrovy bay of moderate depth opened to us, and in a
sandy bight we saw four other proas, whose people were encamped on shore. We
accordingly ran in and anchored in 7&frac12; fms. at half past 3, being about
25 miles to the westward of Port Essington. At 5 p.m. a canoe was seen, with
five paddles, pulling from the proas towards us; we therefore got firearms
ready, in case of any appearance of hostile intentions. Coming alongside, they
were six in number (of whom four were boys), prompted by curiosity to see us
and obtain what they could from us. Little or no invitation was requisite on
our part to induce them to leave their canoe and enter the vessel. The two men
came on board and soon became very loquacious, but none of us understanding the
Malay language, very little information could be procured from them.</p>
<p>We gave them wine and some ships' biscuits, which they enjoyed exceedingly,
and we showed them the letter written in the Malaya character by Sir T. Raffles
but they were too illiterate to read their own language. They made many
observations upon the ropes, sails, etc., of the vessel, and, observing our
carronades, they intimated that the large proas carried smaller ones (probably
swivels). Their canoe, which they had sent away, returned at dusk (8 p.m.) and
brought some fish, which they presented to us for our hospitality. Their
request for gunpowder was granted them, and the remainder of the wine in the
bottle and some tobacco were given them for the commandants of the proas. Their
teeth were very black and discoloured, and the whole chewed the betel nut in
the usual way. Mr. King wrote a few lines stating the object of his voyage, and
the extent of his survey, information that must be interesting to any persons
reading English to whom these Malays might show the letter. It was 9 o'clock
before they left us, to return to their proas. This trending of the coast has
received the name o. Popham Bay.</p>
<p><i>26th. Sunday.</i> As the report of the favourable and hospitable
reception the Malays met with from us might induce them to pay us another visit
upon the same terms, and not wishing to receive their further salutations <i>en
masse</i>, we got under weigh and left Popham Bay, steering S.S.W. Several
canoes were observed fishing to windward. We had a strong eddy tide against us,
which made the cutter labour considerably. Our leadsman gave us a bottom at 22
fms., and at one p.m. we had deepened to 50 fms. The day's sail brought us to
the entrance of a deep bay of great width. We bore up and entered, but the wind
becoming foul we made but little progress, and the deep bad rocky bottom
obliged us to continue under weigh. We suspect this opening may prove to be the
Van Diemen's Bay of the Dutch charts. It appears to be very extensive, and may
in the result of examination turn out to be of some consideration. We kept
sight of the land's loom during the night under easy sail. Hitherto we have not
been fortunate in the discovery of any freshwater river, and should any be
found emptying themselves into this deep bay or gulf, it may enable us to see
something of the interior, and gain some interesting knowledge unattainable on
the coast.</p>
<h4>VAN DIEMEN'S GULF AND THE ALLIGATOR RIVERS, 27 APRIL-13 MAY, 1818.</h4>
<p><i>27th. Monday.</i> Although very cloudy in the earlier stages of the
morning we had a very fine day. The wind was E.S.E. At 11 a.m., having made
several tacks, we came to an anchor in a small bay on the east shore of the
gulf we have entered, which appears will require some time to survey the whole
of its deep trending shores. This bay, although small, has good anchorage, but,
like the coast, in general, its shores are densely clothed with mangroves, the
sameness of which is much relieved by the picturesque aspect of two high hills
near its south point of entrance, and from our present position one appears to
be a depressed cone, and the other assumes the character of elevated
table-land, thickly wooded and very rocky. They have been entitled by Mr. King,
Mounts Bedwell and Roe, after the two young gentlemen, his officers, and he has
named our anchorage Aiton Bay, in honour of W. T. Aiton, Esqre. of Kew. The
lat. is 11&deg;16' S., and 131&deg;56' E. long.</p>
<p><i>28th. Tuesday.</i> About 7 a.m. we left the bay and steered southerly
along the shore. The morning is rather sultry, and the wind light, from the
eastward. Having made about 4&frac12; miles, we anchored in 7 fms., muddy
bottom, about noon.[*]</p>
<blockquote>[* "Near the land about six miles east of Mt.
Roe.--King.]</blockquote>
<p><i>29th. Wednesday.</i> At 11 a.m. we passed to leeward of one of several
islands[*] seen this morning, and suddenly shoaling to 3 fms., we hauled up and
gradually deepened to 5 fms. At one we anchored on a bank in 3&frac34; fms.,
muddy bottom. Our lat. at noon was 11&deg;32' S., and long. 132&deg;30'
East.[**] The appearance of the shores, the shallow water, parts of mangrove
bushes floating on its surface, and the depressed character of the islands
remind us of the N.W. Coast. Mr. Roe was sent to sound around for a channel. He
reported on his return the extent of the shoal varying from 2&frac12; to
4&frac12; fms. water.</p>
<blockquote>[* Named by King, Sir George Hope Islands.]</blockquote>
<blockquote>[** King writes: "The land eastward of this anchorage is an isthmus
4 or 5 miles in breadth, separating the body of water from the bottom of
Mountnorris Bay." This land was given the name of Coburg
Peninsula.]</blockquote>
<p><i>30th. Thursday.</i> About 9 we had a slight air from the E.S.E., and got
under weigh, steering S.W. southerly. The rise and fall of the tide is
6&frac12; and 7 ft., and at the ebb, extensive mud flats appear along the
shore, rendering a landing impracticable. At 4 p.m. we anchored in 5&frac14;
fms.[*]</p>
<blockquote>[* Under one of Sir George Hope Islands named next day, May-day
Island.]</blockquote>
<p><i>1818. May 1st. Friday.</i> Soon after 7 Mr. King landed upon the low
shore of an island near us to take sights for the chronometer, and I
accompanied him. Here we have a specimen of a growing island (called May Day
Island), whose basis appears to be a reddish sand with shells, ironstone,
pebbles, etc. cemented together, which by the action of the air are so
indurated as to become rugged stone, and of such large masses that small
cliffs, observed through the mangroves, are formed. The encroachments over the
annual accumulation of drifted land gradually increases the size of the island,
whose sandy soil is covered with plants. <i>Eugenia acuminata</i> is most
surprisingly strong, being 40 feet high, with a stem 30 inches diameter. The
<i>Grewia</i> with tomentose fruit afforded me some fine specimens and
duplicate seeds. The tree I have hitherto called <i>Cordia sebestena</i> is
frequent, and its flowers have an indefinite number of stamina. I saw some
perfectly octandrous.</p>
<p>The tree of the <i>Santalaceae</i> (<i>Exocarpus</i>?) with the foliage like
that of some Brazilian <i>Piper</i>, is very large; with a shrub of the
<i>Meliaceae</i>, discovered first in Port Essington, perhaps <i>Turraea</i>;
the leaves are elliptical and glossy, and the calyx pubescent. A species of
<i>Ficus</i>, 30-35 feet high, was observed, but not in fruit; its leaves are
ovate, smooth throughout, veined, their margins are minutely glandulously
denticulated. I gathered seeds of a small white-flowered <i>Convolvulus</i>,
and <i>Achyranthes sp.</i>, an annual plant. This island abounds with an
<i>Acacia</i>, a tree from 12-20 feet high, distinct from any species I have
before seen, leaves falcated, superior margin glandiferous; flowers globular,
in axillary racemes. Very recent traces of natives were noticed on the sands,
but none were seen on the island. On our return to the cutter we got under
weigh, steering S.S.W., but shoaling our water we re-anchored and sent the
jolly boat to sound ahead of us. It, however, proved that we were upon a large
flat,[*] with barely enough water to carry us over. Mr. King weighed, being
determined if possible to push over it into the deeper water to the southward
and westward. We stuck fast in 9 ft. of water, and were obliged to get an
anchor out to haul ourselves over the bar of sand, and this we continued,
touching and swinging off in 10 and 11 ft., with a strong tide against us.
Steering north at one p.m. we ran back to our anchorage of the 27th ultimo,[**]
where we brought to in 7&frac12; fms., at 4 o'clock in the afternoon.</p>
<blockquote>[* Between May-day and Greenhill Islands.]</blockquote>
<blockquote>[** Eastward of Mount Roe.]</blockquote>
<p><i>2nd. Saturday.</i> We left our anchorage about 8, with a very light
breeze. At I we tacked to eastward. The western horizon was much gloomed by
extensive bodies of thick smoke of natives, who appear to be burning off the
bush and grass of the country in that direction. At 5 anchored at 10&frac12;
fathoms. We are about 30 miles to the southward of Popham Bay.</p>
<p><i>3rd. Sunday.</i> It was past noon before we got under weigh. Vast bodies
of smoke ascend to the westward. We hope and trust another day will furnish us
with materials for observations, to determine the extremes of this gulf. Its
muddy shores are low, and water shoaly.</p>
<p><i>4th. Monday.</i> We weighed very early this morning and steered E.N.E.,
but the tide obliged us to anchor in 15&frac34; fms. at 8 a.m. Calm with
intense heat. The thermometer exposed to the sun rose at noon to 131&frac12;
degrees, being a dead calm. At 2 p.m. we weighed anchor, which was wholly
buried in the mud, and made as much sail as would draw, the light airs fanning
us from the S.W. The land trends easterly in the most extraordinary manner. The
meridians of the ports and bays we have already surveyed lead us to suspect
they were formerly islands which have been, by the encroachments of the
mangroves, joined to the mainland.</p>
<p><i>5th. Tuesday.</i> We stood towards the land at the bottom of the gulf,
which is very low, no beach appearing--but mangroves to the water's edge. To
windward, openings or deep bights appear, and to the southward a lofty range of
hills are distinguished, very distant inland. At 8 p.m. we anchored in 5 fms.
An eclipse of the sun, stated in the Nautical Ephemeris to take place to-day,
was not seen at the given time. It may have no occullation in this part of the
Globe.</p>
<p><i>6th. Wednesday.</i> Soon after 5 a.m. a party consisting of Mr. King, Mr.
Bedwell, myself and the crew of the large whaleboat left the vessel to examine
an opening to the S.E. Mangroves bound it on both sides with their usual
density and arborescent growth. Passing the bar of this river-like opening, its
width becomes contracted and its depth increased to 5 and 6 fms., and the
mangroves being much thinner as we advanced allowed us a glimpse of the flat
land behind them. The windings which are by no means abrupt, present us with
fine bold reaches 400 yards wide with a depth frequently 8 fms. Mr. King had
determined to penetrate up this channel as far as the tide would carry us. He
therefore pulled in about its turn and landed on an open grassy bank perfectly
free from mangroves, but low and muddy. From some hills distant about 2 miles
we might have made some observations, but the difficulty of reaching their
bases through a low swampy flat covered with a matted thick grass and more
especially our care not to lose the benefit of the returning tide, which was
now ebbing rapidly, prevented us from visiting these elevations.</p>
<p>On this muddy bank I gathered the following few specimens and
seeds:--<i>Clerodendrum inerme</i> (H.K.), which likewise furnished me with
seeds. <i>Hibiscus</i>. <i>Stenocarpus sp.</i>, an annual or biennial plant.
<i>Convolvulus flavus</i>, very abundant among the grasses. <i>Sida sp.</i>,
small narrow leaves; and <i>Cassia sp.</i>, plant dead. The width of the stream
at this halting spot is about 250 yards, its depth is 31 fms., and its
inclination from the S.W. The banks are bounded by extensive flats of low
country, subject to inundations, and this depression was unfortunate for us, as
no bearings of any consequence could be taken. White cockatoos abound in large
flocks on its banks, with a large bird of the <i>Anas</i> family, with a very
long neck, some perfectly white; others very dark, and even of a black colour,
were likewise numerous. Their nests were built very thick together on the
<i>Avicennia</i> mangroves of the banks, and in some we saw the young unfledged
birds, over which some beautiful hawks were hovering, watching an opportunity
in the absence of the parent birds to seize their offspring. The turbid
discoloured waters of this winding river[*] abound with alligators 6 and 7 feet
long, whose terrific ghastly heads appeared occasionally on the surface of the
water. We returned on board at 3 p.m. The fires of the natives continue; large
columns of smoke were rising from the grassy flats behind the mangroves, the
soil of which is sour stiff tenacious clay.</p>
<blockquote>[* "This river has received the temporary title of Alligator
River."--King. It is known as East Alligator River.]</blockquote>
<p><i>7th. Thursday.</i> Fresh breeze E. by S. At half past 6 we weighed anchor
and stood along the shore, and at half past 10 bore up for an opening in the
low land that appeared of magnitude, and whose trending we suspect may approach
towards a distant range of hills visible to the S.E. from the deck. Soon after
11 we came to an anchor near the entrance of a supposed river. The country from
the mast-head view presents us with an immense flat of depressed low country
thinly wooded, and only bounded by the very distant clear horizon. I
accompanied Mr. King on shore, who was anxious to get a good meridian altitude,
landing on the muddy bank opposite the vessel, which is a perfectly dead level
for many miles, over which the sea at springtide flows. It is very thinly
wooded, covered with a wiry grass, with patches of <i>Sonneratia acida</i> and
<i>Avicennia tomentosa</i>. <i>Clerodendron inerme</i> and indeed all the
plants discovered yesterday appear on this flat.</p>
<p>At 4 p.m. we weighed and stood to the bottom of a bay, where we came to in
5&frac34; fms. about 6 p.m., off the mouth of a second river.[*] About a mile
inland from the shore the dry wiry grass of the extensive flat was on fire, but
no natives could be distinguished.</p>
<blockquote>[* Now called South Alligator River.]</blockquote>
<p><i>8th. Friday.</i> Having made preparation for an excursion up this second
channel, we left the cutter at half past 5 a.m., having a flood tide in our
favour, although the breeze was against us. Passing the bar of 3 fms. we
gradually deepened to 7&frac12; and 8 fms., with banks (as the other river)
covered with mangroves of <i>Rhizophora</i>, <i>Avicennia</i> and
<i>Sonneratia</i>, whose dull uniformity was much relieved and enlivened by the
yellow flowers of <i>Hibiscus populneus</i>. The width of this stream varies
from a quarter of a mile to 200 yards, expanding frequently in the bends of the
reaches, which (when their inclinations were from the southward and westward)
presented us with views of the summits of distant high land.</p>
<p>About 25 miles up this river some slightly rising ground approached the
mangrovy banks, the principal wood of which appeared to be the stunted
<i>Eucalypti</i>, whose dreary aspect is not a little enlivened by the
picturesque appearance of the <i>Areca</i> of Croker's Island, whose waving
heads, towering over the tops of these small woods, give an effect scarcely to
be conceived in such low uninhabitable tracts. Advancing with a strong flood
tide, we had 9&frac12; fms. in some parts in mid channel, and banks frequently
clear of mangroves exhibiting an extensive flat, covered with lofty grasses. At
such places a similarity of appearance might be traced with the Thames below
Woolwich, and the slender leaves of the <i>Avicennia</i> bearing some analogy
to the willow of that river, adds considerably to the simile.</p>
<p>Soon after 11 the tide was at its highest, and we landed at a clear low spot
on the banks, and, in the interval of time between that period and our
departure, while Mr. King was taking a meridian altitude, I rambled among the
gigantic grass with scarcely a hope of making any discovery in botany. I
gathered a few plants:--<i>Sphaeranthus sp.</i> <i>Jussiaea sp.</i>, the first
species of this swampy genus (so frequent in South America) I have observed in
Australia; and <i>Senecio sp.</i>, a small annual plant. I discovered a few
bulbs and from their long thick foliage suspect it is a new species of
<i>Amaryllis</i>. Their depth in the stiff clayey soil occupied some time in
digging them up safely, and I was only able to procure four bulbs. There can be
little doubt that this liliaceous plant is thinly scattered over the whole
extent of this flat grassy country, as those I saw were at a distance from one
another.</p>
<p>It was unsafe to venture far from the boat, where alligators abound, whose
numerous inroads and intersecting paths among the grass were observable to the
whole of us. I had exceeded my limited time and was hailed to return to the
boat. Our meridian altitude gave us for lat. 12&deg;38'47" S., which is about
20 miles to the southward of our vessel's anchorage, and with the windings of
the river we estimate our distance to return as little short of 40 miles. The
water at the turn of the tide was brackish, and at its lowest ebb we doubt not
of its being perfectly fresh; indeed, the flights of freshwater birds seen this
day indicated its connection with bodies of fresh water at a distance inland.
Its width at this place is about 160 yards its depth upwards Of 3 fms. and its
general tendency was from the southward.</p>
<p>About a quarter past 12 we embarked, the ebb tide having begun some time and
the water had fallen some inches. At 7 in the evening the tide had changed and
was flowing very strong against us, we therefore were obliged to pull inshore,
to come to at a grapnel for a few hours, until the flood tide had in some
measure slackened. At half past 10 we weighed grapnel and pulled for the lights
hoisted at the masthead of the cutter, as a guide to us and we got safe on
board at about midnight. We saw several alligators in the water and on the
muddy banks of the river basking in the sun, none exceeding 8 feet in length.
The fires of the natives continue to be numerous in various directions; these
conflagrations extend over immense tracts of flat country, at intervals
bursting into large flames as the wind rises, and continuing until a heavy
shower extinguishes them.</p>
<p><i>9th. Saturday.</i> Mr. King went on shore to take a meridian altitude,
which gave us 12&deg;19' S. At 1 o'clock we left our anchorage and stood N.E.
out of the bay. The rise and fall of the tide is about 12 feet.</p>
<p><i>10th. Sunday.</i> Prayers having been read to the people we got under
weigh and stood over a flat towards two islands; the one having been called
Field's, and the other Barron's, in honour of Barron Field, Esqre., judge of
the Supreme Court in New South Wales. Our soundings gave us 3&frac12; and 4
fms., and at half past 10 we suddenly got 13 fms. between the islands, but we
were no sooner in deep water than crossing the winding narrow channel we
shoaled to 3 and 2&frac12; fathoms, which obliged us to bring to. About 4 p.m.
Mr. King accompanied by Mr. Roe left the cutter, to sound towards Field's
Island and endeavour to find a channel or line of deep water for the vessel to
pass. At dusk they returned, having ascertained a sufficient depth of water
situated to the N.E. of our present anchorage, between Field's Island and the
main.[*] Our lat. is 12&deg;05' S., long. 132&deg;25' E.</p>
<blockquote>[* Cunningham Channel separates Field Isle (the larger island) from
the main. South Alligator River has an approach through this
channel.]</blockquote>
<p><i>11th. Monday.</i> We weighed anchor about 9, steering along the shores of
the gulf, still trending southerly; a 3rd and 4th opening appeared in the
beach, which possibly may be connected inland with the two rivers already
examined, but our short stay on the coast now, and Mr. King's desire to survey
the whole of this gulf, would not allow us to enter and trace them.[*] The
coast sailed along this afternoon is a long line of sand, for several miles
without a single point or rising of which we might take bearings; and, in
consequence, meeting with nothing to detain us, and a fair wind, we made good
40 miles to the westward. At 6 came to anchor.</p>
<blockquote>[* The Alligator Rivers are three in number: East, South, and West.
King says: "As this opening to the westward bore a similar appearance to the
river last examined, the name of Alligator Rivers was extended to
it."]</blockquote>
<p><i>12th. Tuesday.</i> Weighing anchor about half past 7 we steered westerly.
The coast now trends northward and N.N.W. proving to us that we are approaching
the entrance of the gulf up its west shore.</p>
<p><i>13th. Wednesday.</i> About midnight we found we were being carried in
upon the shore by the tide, we therefore hauled off and by daybreak[*] we had
drifted considerably out of the Gulf. The line of coast is for some distance
low, and clothed with mangroves, excepting where a small sandy beach
intervenes. At 10 a.m. a deep trending was observed to the northward and
westward from one of the points of which a dangerous reef extends. At noon we
passed a long sandy beach with a few scattered <i>Casuarinae</i> upon its
margin, but thickly wooded in the background. Very distant smokes were
distinguished inland, proving the existence of natives remote from the shores,
on which, however, two could barely be seen with the aid of our glasses. At 2
p.m., an opening or bight of the land appearing, we hauled to the wind to fetch
it and anchor. At dusk we were still under weigh, labouring against a strong
tide that was setting us to leeward. We therefore shortened sail and continued
under weigh all the night.</p>
<blockquote>[* Having passed close to the easternmost point of Melville
Island.]</blockquote>
<h4>MELVILLE ISLAND TO APSLEY STRAIT, 14-21 MAY, 1818</h4>
<p><i>14th. Thursday.</i> During the last night we had drifted much to the
westward, and this morning we bore up for the bight of the land which we could
not make the last evening. The wind was from the southward and eastward, and we
were close hauled upon it. At 8 a.m. we entered a fine handsome bay (named
Brenton Bay, in honour of Sir Jahleel Brenton), bounded by cliffy shores, which
appear freer from mangroves than those we have of late examined. Its shoaly
foul bottom, however, prevented us from anchoring, the vessel was therefore put
about and we steered N.W. Steering into a fine spacious bay a few miles to the
westward of the other we got good soundings in 3 fms., and came to anchor on a
muddy bottom. This bay, which has received the title of Lethbridge, has some
red cliffy shores thickly wooded with Eucalyptus. The lat. is 11&deg;10'10" S.,
and long. 131&deg;04'23" E. Four natives were seen on the western sandy beach
of this bay; some canoes were observed in motion at its extremity, and their
fires were blazing in the background at dusk.</p>
<p><i>15th. Friday.</i> About half past 6 we got under weigh and steered N.W.
The coast westerly forms a beautiful range of cliffs of a reddish tinge, with
intervening banks from which the rising grounds are thickly wooded, apparently
with <i>Eucalyptus</i>. By observations and Captain Flinders' chart Mr. King
calculates we are within 4 miles (to the S.E.) of Cape Van Diemen, and a
projecting point of land seen (4 p.m.) before us, led us to suspect that it
will prove to be the cape. Approaching within a mile and a half we were obliged
to haul to the wind, steering north in consequence of a very large dangerous
shoal extending off this headland.[*]</p>
<blockquote>[* Mermaid Shoal.]</blockquote>
<p>N.B. An island passed to-day of small extent and covered with brushwood is
named Karslake's.</p>
<p><i>16th. Saturday.</i> At 6 a.m. we bore up to ascertain the extent of the
breakers off the cape, and also to work round them. At 8 we had soundings 10
fms. on the edge of a bank, and immediately got none in 12 fms. These breakers
extend from the cape N.W. 14 miles at least, and in our run outside the large
shoal we approached within 50 yards of the outer bank, having from 6 to
2&frac12; fms. Wishing to anchor in the evening, Mr. King steered for a deep
bight in the coast with appearance of a river, but our water shoaling again to
4 and 3&frac12; fms. we were obliged to tack and stand-off into 8&frac12; fms.,
and afterwards 22 fms., proving to us we were passing over a bank of sand,
which our lead showed us was of a red colour. Tacking again into the opening at
dusk, we entered and anchored in 7&frac14; fms. off a fine elevated projecting
point, which has been named Luxmore Head;[*] and the bay in which we are at
anchor has been entitled St. Asaph's Bay. The northern point of entrance into
this bay is very picturesque, being a high and striated cliff, perpendicular to
the sea and wooded on its summit. It is named Piper's Head, as a compliment to
Jno. Piper, Esqre., Naval Officer at Sydney.</p>
<blockquote>[* In honour of Dr. Luxmore, Bishop of St. Asaph.]</blockquote>
<p><i>7th. Sunday.</i> The very flattering appearances held out to us in this
bay induced Mr. King to remain the whole of this day at anchor, to take some
observations on shore, for which necessary purposes Luxmore Head, on account of
its elevation, will be particularly serviceable. About 10 o'clock Mr. King, Mr.
Roe and myself landed upon the rocks beneath this point and climbed up its
steep loose ironstony slope, reaching its summit without any suspicion or
alarm. Mr. King had scarcely taken a bearing, and myself prepared for a walk
around, when one of our people armed, and who was keeping sentry near, reported
the approach of several armed natives. A slight confusion instantly took place
by this sudden and unexpected alarm, when it was deemed most advisable to make
good our retreat to the boat (having but one musket up with us), which we
accordingly did rather precipitately down the rugged side of the hill we had
ascended. Our retreat gave these Australians boldness, and we had scarcely time
to secure our instruments in the boat and push off from the shore when 7
natives appeared, hailing us from the height, and in the end descended to the
rocks on the shore. They made signs to us to land but the appearance of spears
among them (which they endeavoured to hide from sight) prevented us from
committing ourselves by venturing among human beings as perfectly wild and
savage as ever Nature herself had formed them. At these moments we found we had
left behind us on the summit of the Head the theodolite stand, which we
afterwards saw on the shoulders of one of the natives.</p>
<p>We spent much time and patience in endeavouring by friendly signs to recover
this useful stand, but in vain. We pulled round the projecting rocks in St.
Asaph's Bay, wishing to land, but these Australians followed us, shouting and
vociferating in such a manner that brought others to the number of 18 from the
woodlands behind the beach. Their total numbers were 25, of whom 5 were women,
with 2 or 3 boys.</p>
<p>They made signs to us that they wanted hatchets or instruments to hew or cut
wood, and seeing that we might by bartering iron (of which they undoubtedly
knew the value) get possession of the instrument stand, we pulled off to the
vessel, intending to return to them in the afternoon. The small Fan Palm
(Livistona?), and <i>Acacia dolabriformis</i>, are common plants of Luxmore
Head beneath the prevailing timber of <i>Eucalyptus</i>. A species of
<i>Dianella</i>, with small panicles of blue flowers, is frequent on the sides
of the hills and, being in fruit, I gathered some ripe seeds on the lower
grounds near the beach. Exclusive of <i>Eucalyptus</i> and <i>Casuarina</i> (of
Goulburn Island) I noticed the arborescent simple-leaved <i>Acacia</i> (Sims
Island), the <i>Gardenia</i> of this coast, and <i>Cycas circinalis</i>, or
Sago Palm, laden with fruit. A small lizard, the ground cover of whose skin was
dark brown and yellow spotted, was caught at Luxmore Head and brought on
board.</p>
<p>In the afternoon at 2 p.m., two boats armed and provided with tomahawks, and
old iron, left the cutter for the shore, having previously arranged that while
the jolly boat should stand in among the natives to barter iron for the stand,
the other would act as a guard boat. The natives, who had returned to the shade
beneath the trees upon our departure in the morning, now came out and waded in
the water towards us. Mr. King held up a tomahawk to them, the sight of which
gave great satisfaction to the natives, which they manifested by their noisy
exulting acclamations. But it was a considerable time before they understood by
our signs we wished to make an exchange for the stand, which we could see stuck
up on the sands of the beach. Two canoes of bark, with three natives in them,
joined the main body, who were all fearful of approaching near us, but received
(through the medium of one of these barks which was pushed towards us) a
tomahawk and some old iron, to encourage and open a correspondence with them,
which compliment was returned with two baskets, the one containing the fruit of
the <i>Cycas</i> beaten to a pulp, and the other with bad rain water. The whole
of this afternoon was consumed in vain solicitations to redeem the stand. We
saw it taken and carried away.</p>
<p>Some of the men had their faces and bodies painted with an ochre or pigment
of a yellowish colour, and it is an inference, drawn from its not washing off
by their frequent immersions, that it was rubbed on their skins with strong
fish oil, with which perhaps it had been previously incorporated. The whole of
these people had spears, either exposed, stuck on the bank, hidden behind
trees, or in the water near them; they could not be said to be directly
hostile; fear, as well on our part as on theirs, prevented a close
communication. In truth we have had reason to act cautiously towards all
natives previously visited by the Malays. This is advancing as much as possible
for the Australians, but very little in favour of those Asiatics--their
enemies. We returned at 5 o'clock to the cutter. Three native dogs of a red
colour[*] were observed on shore with these people; they appeared very quiet,
and by no means alarmed by the appearance of strangers.</p>
<blockquote>[* The natives also had black ones.]</blockquote>
<p><i>18th. Monday.</i> We got under weigh about 9 and worked up the opening at
the S.E., which we have suspected may be a strait.[*] The character of the
shore we passed is moderately high and cliffy, thickly wooded with
<i>Eucalyptus</i>, beneath which the two palms seen yesterday and <i>Pandanus
spiralis</i> are abundant. We passed a small island[**] in the mouth or
entrance of this opening, well wooded with small trees, but difficult of
access, in consequence of the thick mangroves by which it is surrounded. Our
water was frequently very deep, and, in passing a narrow gut where the shores
contract, we found a bottom only in 22 fms.</p>
<blockquote>[* It was Apsley Strait, a cove in it was afterwards named King's
Cove by Captain Gordon Bremer in honour of Captain King.]</blockquote>
<blockquote>[** Harris Island, which divides the south part of Apsley Strait
into two channels.]</blockquote>
<p><i>19th. Tuesday.</i> About 9 o'clock we made sail and proceeded on our
voyage up the opening. The banks continue uniform with those passed yesterday
and offering no inducement to land, which in many places would be
impracticable. The windings are easy, and its width varies from half a mile to
2&frac12; miles, In the background, thick wooded rising hills are not
infrequent, and were by their bearings of great assistance in carrying on the
survey. The bottom is very irregular, and its surface of various qualities.
From 15 fms. we would shoal to 6 fms., 3&frac12; and even 2 fms., but hauling
off we would deepen our water considerably, a proof that there are banks and
shoals that would be dangerous for vessels passing and drawing more water than
the cutter.</p>
<p>Previously to making our tacks we were naturally obliged to approach very
near the one shore to take a good diagonal stretch over to the opposite banks;
this enabled me to observe the plants of the cliffs, which happened not to vary
from those so frequently mentioned. The Sago Palm becomes more frequent. I have
no idea that any opportunity will offer itself affording me a few moments on
shore in this channel, and it appears very probable the few plants that may be
discovered by diligent search would not compensate the valuable time such an
excursion would expend. Several broad inlets of salt water were observed
running from this channel inland. After a succession of projecting angles or
points of land had opened and passed, about 2 o'clock, to our surprise, the sea
presented itself, proving to us we had been passing a strait, bounded by
mainland on the east side, and an island (named in honour of Earl Bathurst) to
the westward, and its length through it from north to south may be 40 miles. At
3 p.m. we were beating well up to the south entrance, when the tide turned, and
running at the rate of 2&frac12; knots per hour obliged us to put the vessel
about, and run back into the strait, where we anchored for the night in 8 fms.
We saw an island off the mouth of the south entrance, very low and
sterile.[*]</p>
<blockquote>[* One of the Buchanan Isles.]</blockquote>
<p><i>20th. Wednesday.</i> The tide rises and falls in this strait about 15
feet; and a bank near our anchorage, extending along the shore at high water,
having 2 fms. of water over it, is this morning dry 3 or 4 feet. Upon the
return of the boat, which had been sent away to sound round some rocks and
shoaly patches appearing at low water, we got under weigh about 11 a.m. and
steered back north easterly, Mr. King not deeming it prudent, from the nature
and result of the soundings this morning, to attempt a passage through the
southern entrance. Anchored in 10 fathoms.</p>
<p><i>21st. Thursday.</i> Leaving our last night's anchorage at 6 a.m. we
passed the Central Island, and at half past 9 anchored off Luxmore Head. Our
situation is about 11&deg;28' S. lat. and long. 130&deg;20' E. dead reckoning,
the weather being dull and obscure at noon not allowing us an observation. The
strait is called by Mr. King, Apsley Strait.</p>
<h4>BATHURST ISLAND, 22-31 MAY, 1818</h4>
<p><i>22nd. Friday.</i> At 9 we weighed and stood out of St. Asaph's Bay,
steering a course southerly down the west coast of Bathurst Island. Upon an
examination of our provisions and water in the hold, made yesterday, it appears
we have beef and pork for three months, but our little rice is become musty;
and that an unfortunate leak has taken place from the pork-casks, and had
rendered many gallons of water unfit for use. It appears necessary therefore
that we should soon quit this coast and endeavour to obtain some little
supplies at Timor or elsewhere. This side of Bathurst Island is low, with red
cliffs and mangrovy patches alternating each other. Anchored in 8 fms.</p>
<p><i>23rd. Saturday.</i> Weighed anchor soon after 7 a.m., tracing the shores
of the island southerly. About 1 o'clock a shallow trending of the line of
coast with an opening in its centre induced us to tack and stand in towards it,
and at half past 5 we anchored off its entrance in 3&frac12; fms., mud and
sand. The fires of natives numerous. Some were blazing along the shores to the
water's edge towards the close of the evening. Our lat. by meridian observation
is 11&deg;32'04" S.</p>
<p><i>24th. Sunday.</i> Mr. Bedwell was sent to sound off the north of this
opening to find the channel, and upon his report we got under weigh at half
flood tide in the afternoon and beat up for it, and off the north point of
entrance, within 60 yards of the beach, we had 12 fms. What this opening may
be, another day will prove, but from the light of the evening it appears to be
bounded by mangroves, having on its eastern side elevated ranges of hills well
wooded.[*]</p>
<blockquote>[* King called it Gordon Bay.]</blockquote>
<p><i>25th. Monday.</i> We continued at anchor the whole of the forenoon. Mr.
King went on shore at a sandy point to take a meridian altitude, and I landed
with him to examine the low woody parts near the beach. Some very fine
<i>Casuarinae</i> skirt the shore, behind which is a considerable, low, sandy
jungle-like waste, on which some coarse reedy grass, <i>Avicennia tomentosa</i>
and <i>Hibiscus populneus</i> are most prevalent. In this sterile situation,
almost level with the sea, I gathered specimens of a <i>Clerodendron</i> with
long cylindrical tabular corolla of a light red colour, in flower and young
fruit. Others were the same as seen in similar low situations. Returning on
board at half past 12 we weighed, stood further into this snug harbour, coming
to in 6&frac12; fms. Very recent impressions of naked feet of all sizes (men,
women and children) seen on the sands, convinced us that natives had passed
very lately.</p>
<p>Soon after 3 p.m. I went with Mr. King and our second officer to examine the
southern continuance of this port, of which several conjectures have been
formed. We followed the windings and turnings 7 or 8 miles, when it divides
into small channels, the one running northerly and the other to the southward
of east, which last we traced, but it dwindled to a confined passage, 40 feet
wide, and scarcely 7 feet water, and throughout the whole these shores are
thickly covered with mangroves. From this day's observations we are led to
infer that Bathurst Island is greatly inundated by salt water in high and
spring tides, and in that case the higher Eucalyptian wooded lands are mere
islands; and that the salt water inlet on the other side and those on the west
possibly may meet and intersect one another, and hence form so many little
islands, clustered together by mangroves. The harbour is small, but safe for
shipping, but the entrance is shoaly and ought to be approached with caution.
It has been named Port Hurd, in honor of T. Hurd, Esq., of the Hydrographic
Office, Admiralty.[*]</p>
<blockquote>[* Port Hurd is the inner harbour.]</blockquote>
<p><i>26th. Tuesday.</i> Intending to lead out to the Port Entrance and take in
some wood for the use of the cutter, Mr. King left the vessel to sound in that
direction, and about half past 8, we shifted our berth to the north side of the
entrance in 10&frac12; fms. close in shore. Having well secured the vessel, a
boat's crew was sent on shore to cut down some of the <i>Casuarina</i> lining
the immediate beach, and I landed with them. The botanical subjects of the
shore are <i>Cordia sebestena</i>, of which I gathered some ripe fruit.
<i>Scaevola sp.</i>, <i>Hibiscus populneus</i>, and the small tree with white
tubular octandrous flowers and drupaceous tomentose fruit, fibrous within,
frequent on all the shores of the main and islands of this coast.
<i>Exocarpus[*] sp.</i>, a tree with leaves like those of some <i>Piper</i>,
furnished me with ripe seeds; the receptacle is red and fleshy. The little
<i>Bauhinia</i> of Port Essington was noticed, but not in flower or fruit; and
a species of <i>Psychotria</i>, with black berries, first observed on Sim's
Island, is on these shores advancing to a flowering state, together with a
climbing shrubby plant having all the external habits of <i>Passiflora</i>. I
was not successful in my search for flowers or fruit. This scandent shrub is
very abundant, ascending to the tops of the small trees of the beach.</p>
<blockquote>[* It may be allied to Podocarpus of Labillardi&egrave;re.
(Author's note.)]</blockquote>
<p>I passed a very thick barrier of mangroves (<i>Rhizophora mangle</i>) that
bounds the ridge of sand next the beach, and was surprised to enter a sandy
desert thinly clothed with timber of <i>Eucalyptus</i> and the following:--
<i>Acacia sp.</i> (of Sims Island), 30 feet high, with cylindrical spikes of
flowers, <i>Melaleuca sp.</i>, allied to <i>Leucadendron</i> (South Goulburn
Island), 40 feet high, not in flower. <i>Guttiferae</i>, a small tree 20 feet
high; leaves ovate-oblong, obtuse, smooth throughout, shining above,
parallel-veined, branches angular, subsulcated; habit of <i>Garcinia</i>; it
was not in flower or fruit.</p>
<p>Some venerable specimens of <i>Cycas circinalis</i> in fruit appear in this
desert, some of which measured 13 inches diameter and at least 40 feet high.
This valuable Palm is here very abundant in all its stages from stemless
infancy to caulescent maturity of various ages and heights, and as far as the
eye could see it is, with <i>Pandanus spiralis</i>, very prevalent.
<i>Calythrix microphylla</i> (a new species of Port Essington) is no mean
ornament of these sterile wastes. It was so rich in flower and in such expanded
perfection that I gathered a few duplicate specimens. With the fine
<i>Grevillae</i> of Palm Bay, Croker's Island was no less remarkably
conspicuous. A species of <i>Banksia</i>, never seen before by me; it appears
to be <i>Banksia dentata</i> of Linn. (supplement), discovered at Endeavour
River, on the East Coast, and being in flower and young fruit I gathered
specimens. The herbage is a <i>Spermacoce</i> and <i>Achyranthes</i> of
Croker's Island, with which I collected specimens of a <i>Xyris</i> with
angular scape and yellow flowers.</p>
<p>I observed several marks made by natives on the stems of the trees,
particularly on a large <i>Melaleucae</i>, the bark of which had been stripped
off at no distant period to form gunyas or huts. During the whole of this day's
excursion I was accompanied by our worthy native chief, Bongaree, of whose
little attentions to me and others when on these excursions I have been perhaps
too remiss in making mention, to the enhancement of the character of this
enterprising Australian.</p>
<p>At 5 p.m. our people having stripped a sufficiency of wood for use on board,
we all went off, leaving some old iron chisels on the stumps of the trees we
had cut down, for the natives who were seen on the opposite shores this day,
and who were watching our operations. Our lat. by observation on shore is
11&deg;38' S. and 130&deg;23' E. long.</p>
<p><i>27th. Wednesday.</i> At half past 8 weighed and stood out of the port. We
had scarcely made sail and cleared Port Hurd when 9 natives ran out from their
covert among the trees at our working place, hailing us to return, and making
signs that they wanted hatchets. At the northern extremity of the sandy beach
of the bay and in other parts, small groups of natives were observed walking
leisurely along, having seen us out of the Port. Mr. King wishing to make
observations anchored at 10 o'clock in the bay in 5 fms.</p>
<p><i>28th. Thursday.</i> About 6 o'clock we departed from the bay along the
coast of Bathurst Island. The shores are frequently low, and bounded by ridges
of sand thickly covered with a brushwood, and occasionally rising in irregular
points, when the white sand is most conspicuous. In the afternoon we observed
the land trend in easterly, but from the masthead it was traced very low to the
S.W. We are approaching the termination of the French surveys northerly, and
suspect we have seen their capes Fourcroy and Helvetius, although Mr. King does
not agree with their latitudes.</p>
<p><i>29th. Friday.</i> Nearly calm during the whole of last night. By the
bearings of the land we are nearly in the same situation as we were yesterday
afternoon.</p>
<p><i>30th. Saturday.</i> From the masthead, the land is seen much depressed
and abounding with mangroves; and several low islands are distinguishable and
have been called Warriors.[*] We had hauled off considerably during the night
and were this morning not within sight of land till about 8 a.m. At 2 p.m. we
approached an island, which Mr. King wished to pass to windward, however,
shoaly water obliged us to haul off W.S.W., and in half an hour we bore up
again southward and deepened our water. The south end of Apsley Strait was seen
from the masthead, but extended reefs from the Islands prevent us from
approaching it this evening. At 7 p.m., being obliged to continue under weigh,
we hove to and allowed ourselves to be drifted to the northward with the tide,
and by its return we should be carried back nearly to the same situation, and
be ready at daybreak to beat up to the land about the southern entrance of the
strait, to make all necessary observations previous to our final early
departure from the coast for Timor. Our lat. is 12&deg;04'47" S., and long.
130&deg;57' E.</p>
<blockquote>[* They are situated in mid-channel of the strait separating
Melville Island from the main which was named Clarence Strait.]</blockquote>
<p><i>31st Sunday.</i> Having stood north-easterly we (at half past 7) clearly
ascertained the south entrance into the strait by the remarkable island, now
seen from the deck, which was noticed when in the strait on the 19th inst. At
noon Mr. King obtained a good meridian altitude, which made our lat.
11&deg;57'18" S. He then took his departure from the Australian coast, steering
for Timor.</p>
<h4>VISIT To TIMOR AND RETURN TO SYDNEY, 1 JUNE-30 JULY, 1818</h4>
<p><i>June 1st. 1818.</i> Monday. We had a very fair run during the last night
on a W.N.W. course, and this morning crowded all sail. Our situation at noon
was 11&deg;14'28" S. and 128&deg;20' E.</p>
<p><i>4th. Thursday.</i> Having gone rather too far to the westward, we hauled
up N.N.W. at 6 a.m. The land of Rottee being 8 or 9 miles distant at 10, we
entered the strait under light sail. The mountainous character of the islands
around is a very pleasing change to us, ranges towering over ranges, crowned on
the ridges with clumps of cocoa-nut trees, and having gentle easy wooded slopes
to the water, now form the romantic relieving scenes about us. A Malay proa was
ahead of us in the strait, but the fear of us obliged its commander to run to
leeward under the western land of Samao or Samow.</p>
<p>At &frac12; past 11 the bold cloud-capt land of the western shore of Coepang
Bay, Timor, opened to us, and about half past 2 we anchored off the Dutch Fort
Concordia. Mr. King, accompanied by his second officer, went on shore to wait
upon the Resident, Mr. Hazaart, who received them in the most friendly manner,
and having stated our object for visiting the island, namely to obtain fresh
water, and any other necessaries, the Resident observed that Coepang was a very
poor place, that at this season fruit and vegetables were bad, but if he could
be furnished with a list of our wants he would make arrangements for the
supply, as much depended upon the mountaineers who were to be sent to, and from
whom sheep could only be procured. The Resident spoke English tolerably well,
which rendered the communication the more pleasant, and at the request of Mr.
King he gave me permission to range about the environs of the town in my
pursuit of flora, and very obligingly observed he would appoint a Malay to
attend me in my several excursions. Several Malay proas were at anchor in the
bay, having lately returned from the Australian coast with cargoes of
trepang.</p>
<p><i>5th. Friday.</i> Clouded heavy damp atmosphere occasioned by the
influence of hills, whose lofty tops gather and retain the clouds pregnant with
humidity. About 9 it cleared off. I accompanied Mr. King on shore, and through
his medium was introduced to the Resident, who received me in a most polite and
friendly manner. He received our list of wants, which undergoing some
alterations, such as sheep for buffaloes, that were too large for our small
daily consumption. He promised to give immediate directions for our supplies,
and would employ Malays to water the vessel. The day having been considerably
broken into by this morning's visit, I proposed to accept his kind offers of
assisting me with a Malay to-morrow morning, to make an excursion a few miles
inland to collect any interesting plants such a route would afford me.</p>
<p>Leaving the Resident's house we took a walk round the town. The inhabitants
are Chinese and Malays, of whom the latter claim the majority. Since the town
was destroyed (in 1815) by the Phoenix, little has existed but misery, and on
the site, perhaps, of goodly habitations, low dreary bamboo huts are erected.
The streets, if they may be so termed, are very narrow and short, intersecting
at right angles others of like dimensions, wherein, if a tolerable clean decent
house presents itself, it is certain the tenant is a Chinese, of whose persons
the same character for neatness and pure cleanliness is equally applicable.
They are polite to excess, and are exceedingly profuse in their bows to us
strangers.</p>
<p>There are remains of some goodly buildings and of a small Company's garden,
now altogether neglected and overrun with unprofitable wild plants.
<i>Tamarindus indica</i> and a large arborescent <i>Ficus</i> (<i>F.
benghalensis</i>) with a radicant stem and branches, form agreeable shades to
some of the streets. To the summits of these trees <i>Piper betle</i> was
ascending. <i>Carica Papaya</i> is a common tree, at this period in young
fruit, and within an enclosure I saw <i>Plumeria acuminata</i>. <i>Heliotropium
indicum</i>, an annual plant, and <i>Calotropis gigantea</i> are ornaments on
the rock on which the Fort of Concordia is built. A species of <i>Capparis</i>,
of low humble growth, is frequent on old walls and on the wayside in byepaths
in rocky exposed situations. It was suggested to Mr. King, on shore, that our
anchorage was bad holding ground. He therefore unmoored and hauled nearer the
Fort.</p>
<p><i>6th. Saturday.</i> This morning I went on shore at 8 a.m. and joined the
Malay, who was to accompany me, at the Resident's house. Ascending the rocky
hills above Coepang by a beaten path the following old genera presented
themselves.</p>
<p><i>Barleria prionitis</i> (?), a thorny ornamental shrub. <i>Helicteres
isora</i>, in fruit. <i>Jasminum hirsutum</i>, a round bushy plant in a
flowering state. <i>Zizyphus jujuba</i>, a small tree with spreading elongated
branches, used by the Malays for hedges, as <i>Crataegus oxyacantha</i> or
white thorn is in England. This plant is the food of a species of
<i>Curculio</i> covered with a yellow powder, which abounds on it, adhering to
the underpart of the leaves.</p>
<p><i>Caesalpinia sp.</i>, closely allied to <i>C. sappan</i>, Roxburgh, but
different in having a densely villous calyx and a few scattered hairs on its
foliage. <i>Cathartocarpus</i> (<i>Cassia</i> with cylindrical legumens), a
slender tree, pods 12-16 inches long, frequent on the hills.</p>
<p>In close thickets several leguminous twining plants were conspicuous, more
particularly <i>Clitoria ternatea</i>, whose large azure flowers could be
traced over the tops of the brushwood to some distance. I gathered pods of
<i>Stizolobium pruriens</i> (Dolichos H.K.) from the dead plant, and of a
<i>Clitoria</i> with ternate ovate leaves. A tree of moderate size, discovered
at Port Hurd on the north coast of Australia, I detected to-day in flower,
which is polyadelphous and appeared allied to <i>Garcinia</i> or
<i>Xanthochmus</i> of Roxburgh; the foliage is very glossy and large,
parallel-veined as in <i>Calophyllum</i>. I gathered likewise specimens of a
species of <i>Sida</i> with whitish flowers. These sterile rocky hills abound
in a shrub of the habit of <i>Phyllanthus</i>, with leaves elliptical and
alternate, at the axils of which the flowers are produced in racemes.</p>
<p>Descending to a valley between the first range of hills next the sea and
this island, my guide took me to the house of a friendly Rajah, which was
surrounded by a high stone wall (not cemented). I found the petty king seated
beneath the shade of a large specimen of <i>Areca catechu</i>, surrounded by
slaves and other attendants. My guide having been previously instructed by the
Resident, satisfied the curiosity of the Rajah as to the object of my pursuits,
who was desirous of putting questions to me relative to my native country,
could I have conversed with him in the Malay Language. He appeared to live
perfectly at ease in this retired valley, surrounded by <i>Gorypha
umbraculifera</i>, a large Fan Palm (of the fronds of which the Malays make
baskets to carry water) and <i>Artocarpus incisa</i>, or bread fruit, which was
then growing on the margins of a stream of water meandering through his
grounds, furnished from the springs in the hills.</p>
<p>Leaving the Rajah's house, we ascended a second range, following
occasionally the public road into the interior, on which I passed several
troops of mountaineers, who were carrying Gulah or Sago syrup and fruits, the
produce of the interior, to Coepang. In these wooded elevations some large
species of <i>Anona</i> and a species of <i>Carolinea</i>, or <i>Bombax</i>,
are frequent. The latter of which was in flower at the extremity of the
branches, rendering it very difficult to be procured, and my Malay was struck
with horror at the idea of ascending and risking his neck for such trifles. I
gathered specimens of <i>Kleinhovia hospita</i>, a branching tree of like bulk,
it afforded me some seeds; and of a specimen of <i>Cynanchum</i> I gathered
young fruit. <i>Triumfetta Bartramia</i> and <i>Plumbago zeylanica</i> are
frequent in flower and fruit. At 4 p.m. I took a circuitous route back to the
town, and on my way I passed several moderate sized trees, with ternate leaves
and large round hard green fruit, which appears to be a species of
<i>Crataeva</i>. At dusk I returned to the beach and was taken off by one of
our boats to the cutter.</p>
<p><i>7th. Sunday.</i> Shifting my specimens and exposing them on deck to air.
Mr. King, Mr. Bedwell and myself, by invitation, dined with the Resident in the
afternoon, at whose table we were introduced to several English captains or
masters in the trading service among the islands, whose vessels are now at
anchor up the river and in the bay.</p>
<p><i>8th. Monday.</i> At 7 a.m. I left the cutter, with an intention to spend
the whole of the day on the banks of the River and the lands near it. The Malay
was unwell and could not leave his bamboo hut; in truth he was a thin, meagre
man, and the corporeal exercise of last Saturday seems to have agreed but
indifferently with him. I continued along the river bank beneath the cool shade
of the trees on its immediate verge, until I had passed the town, when my
progress was stayed by <i>Poinciana pulcherrima</i> covering the slopes of the
hills to the water's edge. I ascended the hills, when a species of
<i>Strychnos</i> of stubbly stunted growth indicated the shallow rocky
soil.</p>
<p>In patches of close brushwood I gathered the following. <i>Nepeta sp.</i>, a
shrub of slender growth, with blue flowers. <i>Acacia sp.</i>, bipinnate;
branches aculeated; the aculea are in pairs; capitulum axillary; pod round as
in seeds. Some <i>Inga</i>, a divaricate, irregular shrub. <i>Smilax sp.</i>, a
scandent aculeated shrub. <i>Cytisus Cajan</i> (plant dead). Upon a
<i>Ficus</i> I discovered a species of <i>Loranthus</i>, with flowers like
those of <i>Louicera</i>. Arriving at the chateau of a Malay I was much struck
with the large bread fruit trees within the enclosure. I gathered some fruit of
a slender tree of the genus <i>Bignonia</i>. This may be <i>Bignonia indica</i>
or <i>Spathodea indica</i>.</p>
<p>Wishing to pass through the valleys which are formed into paddy grounds and
inundated at pleasure by the channels of water from the hills, I followed a
path leading through the enclosed ground and descended to a much cooler moist
atmosphere, where I expected to discover ferns in the bottom. I, however, only
saw an <i>Aspidium</i>, frequent likewise on the banks of the river.
<i>Flemingia strobilifera</i> delights in such dark shades in the close woods
on the slopes of the hills, of which I gathered specimens in flower. The timber
is the large <i>Ficus</i> and the Carolinea seen on Saturday last in
flower.</p>
<p>Crossing several artificial water-courses I descended to the paddy grounds,
which I passed over upon the little muddy raised paths. The rice looked
extremely well, it was young, but the blade strong and luxuriant, and flooded
about 10 inches. Near a run of water I gathered specimens of an <i>Echites</i>,
with spindle-shaped horizontal folicles, allied to <i>E. costata</i>, a strong
irregular shrub in low humid situations; and a small tree of the same natural
order furnished me with specimens in fruit (<i>Nerium</i> or <i>Wrightia</i>),
follicles long, united at their base, seeds compressed, comose at their
extremity. A twining pendent plant with ovate alternate leaves, entire and
undulated, flowers axillary, crowded, decandrous, I discovered on the wayside
in coppices, in which I also gathered specimens of a <i>Banisteria</i>, which
appears distinct from any species I have before observed. A <i>Gardenia</i>,
scarcely distinct from <i>G. florida</i>, being in fruit, I collected
seeds.</p>
<p>At 2 p.m. I halted beneath the shade of a large Fig, having found the heat
very considerable during the forenoon. The specimens I had collected I packed
chiefly in the paper I had taken with me, to protect them from the influence of
the sun, and then commenced a new route back to Coepang, from which I may be
about 5 miles northerly. A strong twining plant of the <i>Bignoniaceae</i> was
ascending the highest trees, and laden with a great profusion of flowers. On
the hills near Coepang I collected specimens of a tree of the
<i>Sapindaceae</i>, leaves pinnate; leaflets obovate, obtuse emarginati,
venose; fruit racemose. About half past 6 I returned to Coepang and went on
board.</p>
<p><i>9th. Tuesday.</i> It having been reported on board during my absence that
a fair opportunity would offer itself of forwarding letters to Europe by way of
India, occasioned by the early departure of some Chinese vessels sailing from
this port to Batavia, I determined to avail myself of it and write to the Right
Hon. Sir Joseph Banks and W. T. Aiton, Esqre. reporting the progress of this
voyage of discovery and my success in obtaining specimens of the Flora of the
north and north-west coasts of Australia. Two of the vessels sailed this day
before any of us could prepare our letters, but a third brig still continues in
the bay.</p>
<p>I visited the Resident to thank him in the name of Mr. King (who was unwell)
for his kind present of a buffalo and pumpkins, which had been sent on board
for the vessel's company. The Resident had detained the Chinese vessel for us,
which afforded us time to finish our letters for England. Mr. Hazaart showed me
a specimen of the coffee of the island, which he procured when on an expedition
to Daily, a small Portuguese settlement on this coast. It is found on the sea
coast in great quantities, considerably to the northward of Coepang.</p>
<p><i>June 6th. Wednesday.</i> Having shifted the whole of my specimens, I
finished my letters, waited on Mr. Hazaart with them and others in the
afternoon, who very obligingly promised to forward them by the Chinese brig
under an envelope to the Consul at Batavia. In a walk I took with our first
officer towards the close of the day, I gathered seeds of an <i>Erythrina</i>,
now deciduous; <i>Celosia argentea</i>, and fruit of the <i>Carolinea</i>
before mentioned. The fruit of the tree, when fresh, is red and contains 8
seeds at least, each covered with an arillus, kernel esculent, oily.</p>
<p><i>11th. Thursday.</i> Repapering my green specimens. This morning I went on
shore, intending to employ myself on the hills north-west from Coepang, and the
following are the results of the day's observations in specimens and seeds.
<i>Sida sp.</i>, flowers panicled, yellow. Specimens, collected before, of
<i>Zizyphus jujuba</i>, a quantity of the fruit. <i>Cassia sp.</i>
<i>Buettneriaceae</i>, a shrub 8-10 ft. high, allied to <i>Commersonia Varronia
sp.</i>, an ornamental small tree with fragrant white flowers.
<i>Myrtaceae</i>, a tree of large dimensions; flowers axillary; leaves
alternate. And a species of <i>Pteris</i>, with pinnate lanceolate fronds, on
rocks in the fresh-water river. On the sides of the hills I discovered several
specimens of the large fruited <i>Bignonia indica</i>, of which I gathered
several siliquae as specimens, with seeds. Also <i>Convolvulus sp.</i>, leaves
small, lanceolate, cordate at the base and <i>C. bracteatus</i> (plant dead).
<i>Cucurbita sp.</i> <i>Solanum sp.</i>, leaves aculeated; berries orange.
<i>Cucumis sp.</i>, fruit large, ovate. <i>Cissus sp.</i></p>
<p>I traced a water-course, now dry, whose rocky uneven bed indicated the
rapidity with which water had passed from the hills through it to the sea in
the rainy season, and near it I discovered three bulbs of perhaps an
<i>Amaryllis</i>, but could find no others. Making the beach I passed through
the plantations of the Resident's secretary, Mr. Tinmann, a Javanese. They
contain cocoa-nuts and bananas chiefly, and a number of thatched huts are
occupied by his slaves.</p>
<p><i>12th. Friday.</i> This day we received most part of our sea stock on
board, and made preparations for taking our departure from Coepang to-morrow
morning. Delay follows delay, our sheep for the vessel's use, which had been
penned up on shore until the day previous to sailing, escaped during last
night, on the hills, and three are not to be found. We now find it much better
to make the little purchases for our cabin mess ourselves, rather than trust to
others on shore. Received the visits of some English commanders of vessels at
anchor in this bay, in the evening.</p>
<p><i>13th. Saturday.</i> It was the determination of Mr. King to have taken
his departure from the island this morning, but many things remained unsettled
and unprovided for on shore, for a voyage of 8 or 9 weeks to Port Jackson. We
were all occupied on shore, either procuring limes or yams, for our mess. I
accompanied Mr. King and Mr. Roe to take our leave of Mr. Hazaart. Mr. King
thanked him for his liberality and attention paid us during our short stay
here, and stated his intention to get under weigh in the morning. Settled all
affairs and returned on board.</p>
<p><i>14th. Sunday.</i> About 7 o'clock this morning, weighed and took our
departure from Coepang Bay. Steered S.W. to the westward of Pulo Samao.</p>
<p><i>20th June to 30th July, 1818.</i> On the 20th June we made the Montebello
Islands (of the French, under Baudin), where some observations were made,
tending to correct the surveys of their original discoveries. On the 13th July
we doubled Cape Leewin in very squally bad weather; on the 24th we entered the
Bass Strait, and anchored in Sydney Cove on the 29th.</p>
<h4>PARRAMATTA AND NEIGHBOURHOOD, 30 JULY-18 OCTOBER, 1818</h4>
<p><i>July 30th. Thursday.</i> His Excellency the Governor and suite had
departed from Sydney three days since, upon a short visit to Newcastle,
Hunter's River, to be present at the consecration of a church recently finished
there. I hired a horse and rode to Parramatta, and made many inquiries
respecting a small house, as a temporary residence for 2 or 3 months, where I
could retire and prepare my collection and journal from material collected
during the last 8 months. Remained at Parramatta all the morning, not having
succeeded in hiring a small habitation.</p>
<p><i>July 31st. Friday.</i> Sharp hoar frost during the night. Morning fine.
After many further inquiries I have fortunately been accommodated with the old
house I occupied previous to my departure on the voyage of discovery, at the
same rent. Returned to Sydney and hired a passage boat for the whole of
to-morrow, to carry my collection and luggage from the cutter to Parramatta.
The country is very dry, and it appears there has not been any rain of
consequence these 3 months past.</p>
<p><i>1818, August 1st. Saturday.</i> This day I got the whole of my collection
and luggage up the river to Parramatta, and lodged them in the house I had
taken.</p>
<hr width="30%" align="center">
<p><i>3rd. Monday.</i> This day I took possession of my house, received rations
of beef and flour, which are supplied from His Majesty's Store.</p>
<p><i>4th. Tuesday.</i> I received my Government Chest etc., from His Majesty's
Storehouse, where I had placed them under the charge of the store keeper during
my absence. Employed within doors.</p>
<p><i>5th. Wednesday.</i> I opened and unpacked my collection and aired my
seeds and otherwise employed.</p>
<hr width="30%" align="center">
<p><i>13th. Thursday.</i> His Excellency having returned from his visit to
Newcastle, I rode down to Sydney and waited upon him at Government House,
Sydney, to pay my humble respects upon my return to this colony from the coasts
lately under survey. I drew cash from the merchants, and intend to give my
bills on the Right Hon. Sir J. Banks. I made inquiries respecting shipping in
the harbour, and what opportunities are likely to offer of transmitting my
collection direct to England, but found none.</p>
<p><i>14th. Friday.</i> This morning I returned to Parramatta, and employed all
the afternoon among my specimens.</p>
<p><i>15th. Saturday.</i> Fair but cloudy. Showery during the forenoon, heavy
rain towards the close of the day. Ticketing and examining my specimens.</p>
<p><i>17th. Monday.</i> Having received the information this morning that the
"Indian," whaler, Captain Swaine, would depart from this port in 2 or 3 days,
and perhaps might revisit the coast for a very short period previous to her
steering a direct course to England, and being advised as to the eligibility of
the opportunity, I intend to transmit originals of my collection to England by
her. I wrote on service this morning to His Excellency, requesting he would be
pleased to grant me orders upon the Deputy-Commissary-General for stationery,
and upon the Superintendent of His Majesty's lumber yard, for the making of
packing cases of dimensions therein stated, for the purposes of transmitting my
plants to England.</p>
<hr width="30%" align="center">
<p><i>31st. Monday.</i> This day I finally packed and closed a case containing
original specimens and seeds, together with some bulbs, and sent it to Sydney
by the passage boat to be shipped on board the "Indian" whaler; writing to
Captain Swaine thereon.</p>
<p><i>1818, September 1st. Tuesday.</i> The weather appears more settled, fine,
with some light flying clouds.</p>
<p><i>3rd. Thursday.</i> I closed my letters and went down to Sydney, with a
view of seeing the Captain of the "Indian," and suggest to him the nature of
the contents of the box, and the necessity of its being placed in an airy dry
situation in the ship. Captain Swaine expressed his regret that his ship was so
much encumbered with oil casks that he had no room for the box in any safe
situation, that having only 2/3rds of a cargo, he was now determined, before he
steered to England, to return to the coast of New Caledonia to effect a
completion of his cargo. I have therefore been under the necessity of receiving
back the case, considering myself much more justified in retaining it until a
more direct opportunity offers, than risk its contents to detention on a
tropical fishing coast. My letters, being written, will require some
alteration, and I shall transmit them via India by the "Magnet " (late a
schooner), Captain Vine, who sails in a few days. Returned to Parramatta at
night.</p>
<hr width="30%" align="center">
<p><i>15th. Tuesday.</i> Bright morning. The "Glory" and the "Isabella" have
arrived from England, but have brought me no letters. Afternoon cloudy.</p>
<hr width="30%" align="center">
<p><i>25th. Friday.</i> Having heard that the "Magnet," Captain Vine, was
reported to sail for China on Sunday next I availed myself of the offer of a
gentleman returning to England by that route, and now forwarded letters to Sir
J. Banks and Mr. Aiton, recapitulating the subject matter of my letters to them
from Timor and reporting my return to the Colony. Went to Sydney and waited
upon Mr. Jones with my packet.</p>
<hr width="30%" align="center">
<p><i>1818, October 1st. Thursday.</i> I brought up my journal and copy to the
present day.</p>
<p><i>2nd. Friday.</i> This day I had an interview with Lieut. King, in order
to ascertain whether he had settled the period of departure on another voyage.
He could say nothing with any degree of certainty, as his charts and journal
would still occupy much of his time. December was mentioned. I have 6 or 7
weeks to employ myself, in which period I hope to make up another case of
specimens. I have purposed therefore to occupy a few weeks in an excursion to
the Five Islands (The Red Point of the charts), to the southward, on this
coast, and have written this day (on service) to the Governor, requesting His
Excellency would he pleased to allow me an order for a light Government cart, a
horse, a spare pack saddle, etc., during this service.</p>
<p><i>5th. Monday.</i> This morning at an early hour I left Parramatta for the
farm to which I had sent out paper, where I arrived at 8 p.m. At &frac12; past
8 we departed for Curdunnee, where I expect to find several plants indigenous
in that remarkable valley, in a different state from that observed in February
1817. In the forest lands we passed, as well as in the sands of and bushy
spots, several of the common <i>Orchidaceae</i> are now very conspicuously in
flower, viz:--<i>Thelymitra ixioides</i>, with another blue flowering species.
<i>Diuris maculata</i> and <i>D. aurea</i>, with several others; particularly
one plant with a reddish-purple cucullated flower, whose labellum is
fimbriated. On the margins of a creek I gathered specimens of an <i>Acacia</i>
of very slender growth, allied to <i>A. longifolia</i>, the leaves are much
longer and more filiform. Also <i>Zieria macrophylla</i>, and <i>Hibbertia
sp.</i>, allied to <i>H. volubilis</i> (<i>H. dentala</i> Br.).</p>
<p>About 10 o'clock we arrived at the rocky wooded verge of the valley called
Curdunnee, to which we descended through large bodies of Fern, chiefly of the
<i>Pterides</i>. <i>Smilax australis</i>, observed here when I visited this
spot before, is in the same condition, without any signs of flower or fruit.
<i>Trochocarpa laurina</i> (<i>Cyathodes</i>) is in fruit, nearly ripe. I
gathered some specimens of <i>Passiflora sp.</i>, allied to <i>P. aurantia</i>
of Norfolk Island and New Caledonia; flowers solitary, orange, red and
green.</p>
<p>I likewise collected the following: <i>Solanum sp.</i> (<i>S. pungetium</i>
Bn.), a rather suffruticose small plant, aculeated; leaves angular; flowers
solitary and blue. <i>Clematis sp.</i>, leaves ternate, cordate, 5-nerved;
flowers corymbose; frequent in various parts of the colony. <i>Santalaceae</i>,
a slender shrub, with the habit of <i>Olax</i>, leaves alternate, elliptical;
specimens in fruit. <i>Pittosporum sp.</i>, this plant is now in flower, and
when seen formerly I had named it <i>P. revolutum</i> (H.K.), it however
appears to be <i>P. fulvum</i> of Rudge, and has more acute leaves than the Kew
plant, to which, however, it is closely allied. <i>Meleaceae</i>, flowers
scarcely perfected, in elongated spikes; leaves petioled, oblong, shining
above, but, with the young branches, are very hoary beneath. A specimen of
<i>Smilax</i> assisted much to render the thickets of this vale the more
intricate, and, being in flower, I gathered specimens. No other plants peculiar
to these shaded situations were observed in flower, of which the large Fan Palm
(<i>Corypha australis</i>), the large Fern Tree (<i>Alsophila australis</i>),
and a shrub with depressed dentated leaves, slender stem, branches spiny,
covered with a substellated tomentum, perhaps of the <i>Buettneriaceae</i>, but
without flower or fruit, are the most remarkable.</p>
<p>At dusk we returned to the farm, my headquarters.</p>
<p><i>6th. Tuesday.</i> I visited some ravines about three miles to the
southward and eastward of the farm, through whose rocky beds a permanent stream
of water runs, which, after numerous windings, crosses the Windsor Road and
ultimately empties itself into the Parramatta River. Among the many plants
inhabiting these shaded humid situations I noticed <i>Lomatia longifolia</i>,
sent home per "Kangaroo" as a <i>Grevillea</i>.</p>
<p>A species of <i>Stylidium</i>, (<i>S. tenuifolium</i>), with linear leaves,
rather crowded on the stalk, is very abundant, but not in flower at this
period. <i>Podocarpus sp.</i> (native Plum), a low, humifuse, spreading plant,
of the habit of <i>Taxus</i>, with a large purple fleshy receptacle, not yet
arrived at a flowering state.</p>
<p><i>Diosma</i> (same genus as last year's list) a slender tree 10-12 feet
high. <i>Grevillea stricta</i> (Br), a slender shrub. <i>Zieria pilosa</i>
(Rudge), remarkable for its solitary, axillary flowers. <i>Ceanothus sp.</i>
(allied to <i>C. globulosus</i>), flowers terminal and crowded; and another
species, with smaller panicled flowers, <i>Dianella sp.</i>, flowers simply
panicled (not expanded). <i>Smilax glyciphylla</i>. The rocks are ornamented
with <i>Dendrobium speciosum</i> in flower; and are covered with the small
plant <i>Poranthera ericifolia</i> of Rudge. In the brushy country surrounding
the ravine I gathered specimens of a <i>Baeckia</i>, (<i>Imbricaria</i> of Dr.
Smith). <i>Thesium drupaceum</i> (native currant), is now laden with fruit, of
which I gathered some seeds. <i>Lomatia silaifolia</i>. <i>Crowea saligna</i>;
with several species of <i>Pultenaea</i>, <i>Dillwynia</i> and other
papilionaceous plants. A small shrubby plant, perhaps of the <i>Diosmeae</i>,
with pentandrous flowers, furnished me with flowering specimens. In the
forest-lands we passed in our return I gathered specimens of a
<i>Helichrisum</i>, allied to <i>H. papillosum</i> <i>Lobelia sp.</i> (<i>L.
dentata</i>), with small laciniated leaves; and a species of <i>Stylidium</i>,
which appears to differ from <i>S. graminifolium</i> H.K. in having longer and
narrower (denticulated) leaves.</p>
<p><i>7th. Wednesday.</i> Returned to Parramatta at noon.</p>
<p><i>8th. Thursday.</i> Last evening His Excellency arrived at Parramatta from
Windsor, but leaving Government House at this place at an early hour this
morning I was unable to see him as I intended, and, as His Excellency has not
answered my letter of the 2nd inst., I am still kept in suspense.</p>
<p><i>9th. Friday.</i> Examining and ticketing the specimens recently
gathered.</p>
<p><i>10th. Saturday.</i> This morning His Excellency arrived at Parramatta
from Sydney, and having received no answer to my letter of the 2nd. inst.,
begging the Governor would be pleased to allow me the use of a Government horse
and cart, and a spare pack-saddle, I waited at Government House but was not
able to see His Excellency, who was stated to be from home. I left my name.
There appearing no favourable direct opportunities likely to offer for
transporting my collections, formed lately on the coast, to England, I was
under the necessity, for the safety of the bulbs there collected, to unpack the
case and plant them in the garden of a friend, trusting a future eligible
conveyance would present itself, enabling me to transmit them home when they
would bear removal.</p>
<hr width="30%" align="center">
<p><i>12th. Monday.</i> This day being advertised in the "Gazette" for the
muster of persons on and off the store belonging to the district of Parramatta
before the Governor at the Court House, I attended and reported myself and
servant. From the circumstances of having received no answer to my letter, I
had suspected it had miscarried. His Excellency, however, had not thought
proper to write me and enclose an order, but stated to me to-day that he had
given directions to Major Druitt, Acting Engineer at Sydney, to furnish me with
a Government horse and cart.</p>
<p><i>13th. Tuesday.</i> This morning I went down to Sydney and saw the
engineer, Major Druitt, at the lumber yard, where I found my demand far from
being in a forward state of readiness. The pack-saddle was not beginning to be
made or even thought of; and the Governor having only given directions to the
Major to provide me with a Government horse (cart-harness I presume I did not
specify in my demand), a cart and spare pack-saddle. I find I am under the
necessity of writing His Excellency again for an order for a tarpaulin, a pair
of spancels and a rope of <i>moderate size</i>! ! The Major assured me all
should be ready for delivery on Saturday next. Although the "Isabella " arrived
here four weeks since, it was by mere chance that I heard of a case directed to
me, which came by her from England. The box had been lodged in H.M. store, from
whence I forwarded it to Parramatta per Passage Boat. The "Isabella" (Capt.
Berry) being about to depart for Bengal, and thence to England, I have
determined to avail myself of the Captain's kind offer to take charge of a case
for His Majesty's Gardens. Returned to Parramatta.</p>
<p><i>17th. Saturday.</i> This morning I sent my servant to Sydney with a
letter to Major Druitt, Acting Engineer, for the horse and cart and other
necessaries that were to be ready this day at noon. At a late hour at night my
servant returned with the horse and cart, spare pack-saddle and all the other
articles, for which I had made my demand, which has now determined me to start
early on Monday morning, without further loss of time.</p>
<p><i>18th. Sunday.</i> The long wished for "Tottenham" ship has at last
arrived, and bringing me a most satisfactory letter from W. T. Aiton, Esq., of
date 17th. February last, the original of which I have not received.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI</h2>
<h3>CUNNINGHAM'S JOURNAL</h3>
<h4>THE FIVE ISLANDS AND ILLAWARRA</h4>
<h4><i>19 October--19 November, 1818</i></h4>
<p><i>19th. October, 1818. Monday.</i> At an early hour (6 a.m.) I left
Parramatta with a laden cart of luggage and provisions, intending to make good
an 18-mile stage before I halted for the day, travelling leisurely in order the
better to make an observation on the botany as I passed along. In my route
towards Liverpool, on a line of road, about 9 miles, bounded by open
forest-land and confined dense brush, many interesting (already described)
plants were in flower, among which I gathered the following <i>Pomaderris
betulina</i>, flowers panicled axillary and terminal. <i>Diosmeae</i>, habit of
<i>Correa</i>, a shrub with white flowers, also a genus of this order allied to
<i>Eriostemon</i>, stamina smooth, leaves oblong, narrow, obtuse. <i>Dampiera
undulata</i>, a suffruticose blue flowering plant. <i>Colletia sp.</i>, a small
tufted leaved, spinous shrub, suspected to be allied to <i>Cryptandra</i>, and
sent to England per "Harriet," is now frequent, in flower and fruit, in the
vicinity of the town of Liverpool. In moist situations I gathered a small plant
of the order <i>Gentianaceae</i>, <i>Erythraea australis</i>. To the southward
of Liverpool the country is an open forest-land of common <i>Eucalypti</i>, in
which <i>Exocarpus cupressiformis</i>, and the papilionaceous tree <i>Jacksonia
scoparia</i>, at this period laden with yellow flowers, are very conspicuous.
<i>Pimelea spicata</i> and <i>P. glauca</i> of Mr. Brown; a small
<i>Daviesia</i> with cordate leaves (<i>D. squarrosa</i>, Smith); with a
<i>Helichrysum</i>, allied to <i>H. papillosum</i> and prevalent in this
description of country. And on the banks of George's River, which empties
itself into Botany Bay I gathered flowering specimens of <i>Casuarina sp.</i>,
a tree of moderate size, with smooth bark. In situations on the roadside, more
or less subject to inundation, a delicate, tufted small <i>Lobelia</i> (<i>L.
inundata</i>) is in flower, and <i>Ruellia australis</i> is common in grassy
dry spots, decorating our path throughout this day's route. I halted at the
farm of a settler, an old resident, who liberally allowed me to put up at his
house.</p>
<p><i>20th. Tuesday.</i> We commenced our journey from the farm we had stopped
at during the night, travelling over the high beaten road, bounded by
forest-land of fine grassy rich appearance, but by no means profitable to the
botanical collector.</p>
<p>Finding myself obliged to make arrangements for the charge and care of my
Government cart, which I intend shall convey the whole of my luggage to the
verge of the Mountain Range bounding the fertile country, in the vicinity of
the Five Islands, I stopped at the last farm, previous to entering upon the
rocky, sterile or damp, morassy country, extending southerly 15 miles to the
mountain. Rather than leave the cart 4 weeks on its summit (beyond which I can
only avail myself of pack-horse carriage), and subject it to be burnt or
destroyed otherwise for the sake of the iron work, I have determined to send it
back to this farm, whose proprietor has kindly promised to take charge of it
till I might send for it on my return from the excursion.</p>
<p>In a rocky creek which waters this little farming establishment I employed
myself for a few hours in the afternoon, in which I gathered the following:
<i>Xerotes aemula</i> (Br.) which is frequent, with another species of the same
genus <i>X. flexifolia</i>. <i>Senecio sp.</i>, with laciniated leaves, large
yellow flowers, and of gigantic herbaceous growth. <i>Notelaea longifolia</i>
(var.), in fruit, of which I gathered ripe seeds. <i>Haloragis sp.</i>,
extremely abundant beneath rocks. <i>Pleurandra acicularis</i> of
Labillardi&egrave;re. The rocky bed of the running water gully is in many
places choked up with large tufts of <i>Xerotes</i>. A dense low branching
shrub of the <i>Epacridae</i>, now in fruit, appears either to be the
<i>Leucopogon setiger</i> or <i>Lissanthe strigosa</i> of Mr. Brown. I likewise
gathered specimens of <i>Leptomeria acida</i> in fruit. <i>Dampiera sp.</i>,
allied to <i>D. stricta</i>. <i>Logania Pusilla</i> (Brn.); and the following
two ferns, <i>Schizaea bifida</i> (Brn.) and <i>Blechnum striatum</i>. Among
the many plants prevalent on the margins of the creeks throughout the colony,
the <i>Stylidium</i> discovered on the Liverpool Road, and of which I forwarded
ripe seeds to Kew per "Harriet " last year, is now most rich in flower; and the
rocks are covered with the delicate white-flowering <i>Dendrobium linguae
forme</i>. <i>Podolobium heterophyllum</i> of the Blue Mountains, and
<i>Stypandra glauca</i>, prevail in the dry rocky brushes on the verge of this
line of creek.</p>
<p><i>21st. Wednesday.</i> Leaving the little farm we resumed our journey at an
early hour, continuing our route southerly about 2 miles, when the road
abruptly terminates, or rather continues by paths or partially beaten ways,
striking east and west. Taking the former, we arrived at once upon an entire
change of country, of a rugged sandstony character, alternated by extensive
tracts of spongy bogs. Crossing a run of water, the drainings of a morass
called King's Fall, which empties itself into Botany Bay, we pursued our course
generally S.S.E. over this diversified bad country, affording me much variety
of common Port Jackson plants. <i>Bauera rubioides</i> and <i>Sprengelia
incarnata</i> are particularly attractive on the margins of the Fall.</p>
<p>The swamps afforded me some specimens of <i>Euphrasia speciosa</i>. The
dwarf <i>Banksia latifolia</i> abounds in these bogs, of which it is difficult
to discover fruit with ripe seeds; and the whole was bespangled with
<i>Utricularia uniflora</i>, and the common <i>Xyris</i>. Large clumps of the
stately <i>Doryanthes excelsa</i> presented themselves on the roadside,
generally in a sub-humid situation, bearing at this period the remains of last
year's flowering stems, varying from 10-15 feet high. The Government horse,
afforded me by His Excellency's order, not caring to face the rugged boggy
country in this day's stage, could not be induced to proceed from the King's
Fall onward. It obliged me to avail myself of the fortunate circumstances of an
empty cart passing to the mountain for red cedar, which I hired to carry my
luggage 14 miles, sending my servant back with the Government cart to the
little farm I left this morning, with directions to follow me with the horse as
speedily as possible.</p>
<p>About 2 o'clock we arrived at what is termed the Mountain Top, along the
ridge of which the road runs before it strikes down to the sea coast and
country in the vicinity of Five Islands,[*] of which we have a bird's eye view
from the immediate edge of the mountain summit. A sudden change again takes
place, for, in an instant, upon leaving the morass with stunted small
<i>Eucalypti</i>, we entered as it were, within the dark shades of a tropical
forest, composed of very lofty timber of the red cedar <i>Tristania albens</i>
[= <i>Syncarpia laurifolia</i>] or Turpentine Tree; large <i>Eucalypti</i>, of
the species called Blue Gum, and many other trees--only existing in such
situations. <i>Epacrideae</i> (<i>Trochocarpa</i>); with large specimens of
<i>Corypha australis</i> and <i>Alsophila</i>, a tree-fern of New South Wales;
the whole being strongly bound together with immense scandent and volubilous
plants, that cannot fail to arrest the attention and admiration of the most
indifferent observer.</p>
<blockquote>[* The Five Islands being the Red Point and Tom Thumb's Islets
(five in all), which are to be seen off the coast.]</blockquote>
<p>After settling myself beneath a hut of cabbage tree thatch (<i>Corypha</i>),
where we intend passing the night, and having secured my plants in paper, I
took a walk down the side of the mountain, by the little beaten steps of the
Government sawyers, and was much struck with the abundance of the
<i>Filices</i>, whose great exuberance is wonderfully promoted by the perpetual
humidity that exists in these deep woods, which the solar ray never has any
direct chance to exhaust. I gathered some very fine specimens of a species of
<i>Pimelea</i> with a conical capitulum of flowers, whose involcrum consists of
8 leaves; a shrub 6-8 feet high. <i>Aster viscosus</i>, Labill. [= <i>Olearia
viscosa</i>], having smooth elliptical leaves and terminal corymbs of flowers,
with a shrubby stem, I discovered growing on the overhanging rocks, in flower.
An aculeated shrub, perhaps of <i>Pittosporeae</i> of Mr. Brown, of slender
habit, with subrotund or cuneated leaves, toothed at their points, with
pentandrous solitary axillary flowers, is in these shades a frequent plant.
<i>Rubiaceae</i>, a spreading branched tree, with dark green serrulated leaves,
racemes of green tubular flowers, and purple angular drupes, appears to be a
nondescript. I discovered another strong plant of the habit of <i>Cunonia</i>,
probably a <i>Weinmannia</i>. <i>Myrtus trinervia</i> [= <i>Rhodamnia
trinervia</i>]; <i>Eugenia elliptica</i> of Smith; and <i>Pittosporum
fulvum</i> of Rudge (scarcely distant from <i>P. revolutum</i> H. K.), are very
common shrubs, in flower or young fruit. A plant of the <i>Iridaceae</i>, with
white flowers, and a flat-stemmed plant of <i>Aroideae</i>, which I have not
seen since I left England. <i>Gymnostachys anceps</i> abounds in these leafy
damp woods, and some little parasitical plants of <i>Orchidaceae</i>,
<i>Sarcochilus falcatus</i> and <i>Dendrobium rigidum</i> are rare, adhering to
the bark of the trees, of which I gathered some specimens.</p>
<p>About the time I returned to my hut my servant arrived with the Government
horse, when we made up a good fire for the night.</p>
<p><i>22nd. Thursday.</i> Early this morning I sent the packhorse down the
mountain to a small farming establishment at its base, with as much of the
luggage as the beast could conveniently carry, and I kept with the remainder
till the return of my servant and horse. I was not a little agreeably surprised
to discover <i>Aster argophyllus</i> of Labillardi&egrave;re, accompanying an
<i>Acacia</i> with much the habit of <i>A. sauveolens</i>. This <i>Aster</i> is
of arbusculous growth, from 10-16 feet in height, with a stem, in some aged
specimens, 7 and 8 inches in diameter. It is now in flower, which are disposed
in a terminal corymb, and more remarkable for the musky scent of its foliage
than others of its shrubby kindred, or Australian <i>Gnaphalia</i> of that
savour. I gathered a quantity of the ripe fruit of <i>Podocarpus sp.</i> and
some of <i>Eustrephus latifolius</i>, whose diversified foliage led me to
suspect I had detected the tropical species of this, but its aggregated
monadelphous flowers determined the plant. I discovered a slender tree with
alternate veinless coriaceous leaves, in fruit, allied to <i>Diospyros</i>,
which proves to be Mr. Brown's <i>Cargillia australis</i>.</p>
<p>At noon the man and horse returned to me, having left part of the luggage in
the charge of a new settler, who had erected a temporary hut on the sea-shore,
about 2 miles east of the mountain's foot. Finally, leaving our encampment with
the remaining part of the luggage, we followed the beaten horse road about a
mile through the same continuance of thick matted forest of various
descriptions of timber till we arrived at the pitch of the descent down the
mountain, which is at present, in many parts, very abrupt, steep and rugged.
<i>Corypha australis</i>, now laden with large bunches of ripe black fruit, and
<i>Alsophila australis</i>, with other of the <i>Filices</i>, are very
luxuriant on the roadside down the mountain. On my way I gathered specimens of
a small tree of <i>Celastrus</i>, flowers pentandrous, in terminal panicles.
<i>Prostanthera incisa</i> (Br. Prod). The <i>Passiflora</i> of New South
Wales, which frequently abounds in deep shaded situations a few miles north of
Parramatta, decorates the wooded descent with a profusion of its orange and
green flowers, having its slender scandent branches laden with young fruit.
About 5 p.m. we had descended to the base of the mountain, which is abundantly
indicated by the marshy grounds and runs of limpid water we crossed a little
elevated above the level of the sea, but not before the horse was completely
worn out with the severe exercise of the day. Arriving at the palm-thatched hut
of the settler, who very liberally offered me a part of the same, we halted for
the night, intending to reach our ultimate headquarters early on the morrow. In
the sandy open arid spots near the sea, <i>Dillwynia glaberrima</i> and others
were in flower, and in open forest land I detected a small plant
<i>Schelhammera undulata</i> (of Mr. Brown), of which I gathered specimens.
Rain at close of evening (8 p.m.), which the slight roofing of our hut, without
the aid of my tarpaulin, would barely keep out.</p>
<p><i>23rd. Friday.</i> My specimens, prior to our departure, having been
slightly injured by the rains of the preceding night, I placed the whole into
dry papers, packed up all my luggage, and proceeded forward to my ultimate
destination at Mr. Allan's farm, Illawarra, 10 miles to the southward. The
horse road continues along the lengthened beach, which is broad, and bounded by
brushes or small woods, in which <i>Banksia integrifolia</i> and <i>Fabricia
Lawvigata</i> at this period in flower and young fruit, are particularly
remarkable. <i>Scaevola suaveolens</i> (Brown), <i>Hibbertia volubilis</i>, and
a tufted plant of the genus <i>Stackhousia</i>, with thick succulent leaves and
spikes of pale straw-coloured flowers, decorate the dry scorching sands. With
the latter, I gathered other specimens of the following. <i>Hibbertia sp.</i>,
an erect shrub. <i>Phyllanthus sp.</i> with elliptical leaves; and a large
dense shrub of <i>Epacrideae</i> in flower and fruit. On the several projecting
rocky points in the coast line (exposed to the sea), I observed abundance of
<i>Westringia Dampieri</i>, <i>Samolus littoralis</i>, and a dwarf shrub of
<i>Casuarina</i>, in fruit. Having passed several lagoons, formed of waters
from the mountains, and two salt-water inlets, one of which is connected with
Tom Thumb's lagoon, visited originally by the late indefatigable Bass, in his
voyage to the westward, we arrived at the farm about 3 p.m. In the environs of
this I intend to employ myself for about three weeks, in the examination of the
botany around. This farm, for which the native name Illowree or Allowree is
retained, is the property of David Allan, Esqre., Deputy-Commissary-General,
and comprises 2,000 acres of fine grazing land, whose western boundary or
extremity is the Red Point of Cook and the charts. The good land extends inland
from the sea westerly 10 miles, till it terminates at or near Point Bass,
southerly towards which, in either direction from Illawarra, the land gradually
decreases in breadth.</p>
<p><i>24th. Saturday.</i> I destined the whole of the day to the examination of
the country around me, and especially to the westward, inland. From thence
alone it appeared I would be most likely to meet with botanical novelty, and
accordingly we left the farm-house in a north-westerly direction, taking with
us an assistant and guide, the nephew of the chief of the Lake Allowree,[*]
whose services I purchased for the day, for a small piece of tobacco.</p>
<blockquote>[* Flinders's name for Illawarra.]</blockquote>
<p>We passed through a large portion of very fine rich forest, but very
unprofitable botanical land, about 2&frac12; miles before we reached a thick
wooded bottom, about half a mile in diameter, having a running stream passing
through it, where I noticed several trees of various dimensions, very different
from any seen before, and although few were in flower or fruit, I gathered some
specimens.</p>
<p>On the margins of these woods I observed a slender tree of the habit of
<i>Taxus</i>, a <i>Podocarpus</i>, with long lanceolate leaves; it was,
however, not in flower or fruit; and in a like state I detected a slender tree
(a <i>Bombax</i>), 20-30 feet high, having the leaves and habit of a
<i>Gossypium</i>. In these very damp hollows I discovered a <i>Caladium</i>
with large cordate leaves acute at the point, with rounded lobes at the base,
and many strong nerves. I could not find any appearance of flower or fruit on
the many plants I examined, some of whose clear stems were 3 feet high. Ferns
abound in these situations, but are by no means numerous in species; of those I
found in fructification I collected specimens. A robust habited tree (in
stature) having a very soft woody stem, large cordate leaves, and densely
covered with stinging spines or soft herbaceous aculeae, evidently allied to
<i>Urtica</i>, forms thick and dangerous woods to attempt a passage through, of
which I regret I was unable to discover either flowers or fruit, and that it
produces abundance, appears to be sufficiently demonstrated by the many small
plants of all sizes and ages in the boggy bottoms, where among the
superabundance of scandent and volubilous plants (unknown to me) I gathered
duplicate seeds of <i>Eustrephus latifolius</i>, while my native guide was
furnishing himself with long pieces of the tough stringy bark of Currajong
(<i>Hibiscus heterophyllus</i>), for fishing lines.</p>
<p>About 3 p.m. we took a circuitous route southerly, towards the sea coast,
with little or no further success, for, having once left these shaded hollows,
the forest land commences, which carried us to the sandy beach. On the bounding
ridge I gathered seeds of <i>Persoonia sp.</i>, hardly distinct from <i>P.
lanceolata</i>, the leaves however are scarcely smooth. In these exposed dry
situations <i>Pimelea glauca</i> and <i>Dianella revoluta</i> abound, with
<i>Eriocalia major</i> [= <i>Actinotus helianthi</i>], <i>Correa alba</i>,
<i>Stylidium graminifolium</i> and <i>Rhagodia hastata</i>. During my return to
Headquarters, on the immediate shores, I gathered specimens of <i>Spinifex</i>
(= <i>S. hirsutus</i>), with dioecious flowers, growing luxuriantly in the
sand, with a species of <i>Convolvulus</i>, closely allied to <i>C.
soldanella</i> (<i>Calystegia reniformis</i> of Mr. Brown).</p>
<p><i>25th. Sunday.</i> Visited the last farm southerly, in this range of
country, about 10 miles from Illawarra, situate on the small river called
Merrimorra by the natives.</p>
<blockquote>[* The Minumurra of modern maps.]</blockquote>
<p><i>26th. Monday.</i> We were prevented from returning to Mr. Allan's farm
last evening in consequence of the high tide, its great depth and strong
current of water at the mouth of the Lake through which our route ran. I
therefore availed myself of this detention and took a range over the forest
grazing lands westerly, to the shaded hollows under the mountain belt, the
plants of which I found, however, were for the most part of the same
description as those already observed in similar situations. <i>Rhipogonum
album</i>, with its variously inserted foliage; and the slender shrub of
<i>Pittosporeae</i>, being the most predominant. I collected specimens of the
following:--<i>Ficus sp.</i>, forming a slender tree; leaves scabrous, oblique;
fruit being calyptrated. <i>Asclepiadaceae</i>, <i>Tylophora barbata</i> Br., a
twining slender plant. <i>Anonaceae</i> allied to <i>Eupomatia</i>, a small
tree with glossy serrulated leaves; flowers in axillary racemies, scarcely
open. <i>Commelineae</i>, <i>Aneilema crispatum</i> (Br.), this plant is very
abundant, but rare at this time in a flowering condition. <i>Gymnostachys
anceps</i> is exceedingly common. I gathered from one plant a ripe seed.
<i>Renealmia paniculata</i> [= <i>Libertia paniculata</i>], noticed on the
mountain top, and <i>Crinum pedunculatum</i> of Mr. Brown, with the caulescent
<i>Caladium</i> and arborescent <i>Urtica</i> are prevalent plants in these
shades. I was not successful in procuring specimens in flower or fruit of a
climbing plant, which I suspect, from its knotted stem and large, reniform,
glossy, strong-nerved foliage, of a warm pungent taste, may belong to the
<i>Piperes</i> or <i>Cissi</i>.</p>
<p>Amongst a group of fourteen natives from Shoalhaven who were encamped near
the Merrimorra River Farm, I observed they had their fresh water in baskets
made of the leaf-sheaths of some palm, which they called Bangla, and which they
informed us grew under the mountain range. With a view of ascertaining the
point whether or not any palm exists in New Holland--without the
Tropics--beside <i>Corypha australis</i>, I persuaded one of these people to
become our guide (under the promise of tobacco on his return), and conduct us
to the woods where this doubtful tree existed. We travelled about 4 miles over
forest land, in which I gathered specimens of <i>Croton sp.</i>, a tall shrub,
with subrotund cordate serrulate leaves, and axillary racemes of flowers; and a
parasitical <i>Loranthus</i> with obovate leaves, growing upon <i>Casuarina
totulosa</i>. We passed through some low swampy grounds covered with <i>Arundo
phragmites</i> as we approached the mountain base, and entering some dark moist
woods, some few plants of the palm presented themselves. Its fronds are
pinnated and large; it has all the habit of some smooth <i>Areca</i> or cabbage
tree, and appears to be the identical species of palm of which I obtained seeds
on the North Coast, during the late voyage of discovery, which I suspect is
<i>Seaforthia elegans</i> of Mr. Brown. Their stems are very slender, and some
I observed were 50 ft. high, without any signs of fructification. The Banglas
or lower part of the petioles, which embraces the stem at the head of the palm,
are very large, and some of them that had fallen to the ground were 5 feet long
and 3 ft. broad, of sufficient dimensions to make small catamarans.
<i>Alsophila</i>, a tree fern, and the common fan palm (<i>Corypha
australis</i>), are companions of this tropical species. In our course direct
for our Headquarters, after discharging our guide, I fell in with brushes of
the tree before noticed, of the same order as <i>Melaleuca</i>; and perhaps a
<i>Turraea</i>, in fruit, in which state I gathered specimens, but met with
nothing else particularly interesting.</p>
<p><i>27th. Tuesday.</i> The greater portion of the afternoon was employed on
the margins of Tom Thumb's Lagoon, and in shaded woods in the vicinity, with
very small success; <i>Crinum pedunculatum</i> of Mr. Brown is common in all
situations and exposures, while <i>Salicornia indica</i> and <i>Mesembrythemum
aequilaterale</i> skirt the margins of the water. In the woods I gathered a few
seeds of <i>Tylophora barbata</i> of Mr. Brown, specimens of a small tree in
fruit (<i>Myrsine</i>), and some ferns. A repent plant adhering to the bark of
trees, with cordate oblong leaves, I suspect to be of the
<i>Asclepiadaceae</i>, on account of its habit and lactescent character. I
could not discover it in any stage of fructification. At dusk we returned to
the farm hut, having met with no other plants of any moment.</p>
<p><i>28th. Wednesday.</i> I have examined the shaded hollows or bottoms
westerly, towards the mountain belt. On land occupied by various settlers, for
the most part as runs for cattle, I find I am generally a month too early for
flowering specimens. I have, however, procured a few in rather an unexpanded
state, and others have afforded me ripe fruit. I now purpose to spend two or
three days on or immediately under the range; and this morning I removed my
headquarters to the stock-keeper's hut near the mountain, taking with me a
sufficiency of salt provisions and abundance of paper for the limited time I
intend being absent. About 8 a.m. we left the hut, with an intention, if
possible, to reach the summit of Hat Hill, bearing about 8 or 9 miles
(apparently) W.N.W., and as a guide through the more intricate woods, I had
induced an intelligent native to accompany me. About 11 a.m. we had penetrated
through much confined thicket and small patches of clear open forest-land
alternately, when my native guide, seeing the more rugged and difficult part of
our route before us (and in truth not caring to be absent long from his wives
and children), complained of sickness and finally abandoned us, returning back
to the hut with all possible speed.</p>
<p>The botany of these thickets varies in nothing from what I have of late so
frequently observed. <i>Rhipogonum album</i> is by no means a trifling ornament
in these woods, being laden with a great profusion of its white flowers on a
smilacine plant. I gathered duplicate seeds of <i>Eustrephus latifolius</i>,
and of the aculeated slender plant of <i>Pittosporae</i>. With some difficulty
we descended to the rocky bed of a water gully, which is supplied by springs in
the belt, particularly from one that has its rise near Hat Hill, which, failing
over rocks, passes through this channel into lagoons at the foot of the
range.</p>
<p>In an opening through the trees we could clearly distinguish the bold rocky
summit and perpendicular face of the hill, which we intend to ascend, although
the densely wooded and brushy rising grounds, broken with ravines, between us,
are no small barriers against the attempt. After crossing two deep
water-channels, and passing over several minor elevations, we arrived at the
back of the lower part of the range considerably to the left or southward of
Hat Hill, and tracing it continually upon the ascent we at length reached the
rugged summit of this flat-topped mariner's landmark at 3 p.m.[*] I cannot
state otherwise but that I was much disappointed upon finding this eminence
entirely covered with very common Port Jackson plants, affording me nothing
interesting. The plants were <i>Banksia serrata</i>; <i>Epacris
obtusifolia</i>, <i>E. grandiflora</i>; <i>Lomatia silaifolia</i>; the common
<i>Tetratheca</i>; <i>Tristania albens</i>, and some common <i>Eucalypti</i> of
stunted growth. <i>Comesperma sp.</i>, and a <i>Polygala</i> with large purple
flowers, common at Parramatta.</p>
<blockquote>[* Mount Kembla.]</blockquote>
<p>From this elevation we had a very extensive view to the seaward, of the
whole of the farmed land occupied by various settlers, and bounded by the
ocean, comprising from north to south an expanse of near 40 miles. The view
westerly on the contrary, is very confined, the country being a succession of
lofty ranges behind each other, from among which, large smokes of native fires
were observed ascending. The rocks are of sandstone, much excavated by the
weather, and the general rugged aspect much the same as that presented to the
traveller on each side of the road over the Western or Blue Mountains. After a
range of full one hour on this summit, I thought it advisable to descend, and
make the most of the daylight and sun, which was much obscured by the dark
clouds blowing from the eastward and enveloping the summit of this lofty hill.
About 5 p.m. we descended to some rocky holes of water, and being surrounded by
<i>Corypha australis</i>, I determined to halt for the night till daybreak, and
while my servant was constructing a hut or gunya of its fan leaves, I kindled a
fire to prepare us a meal, which at this time of the evening we found very
acceptable. We experienced some disagreeable annoyances by being obliged
occasionally to pass through large bodies of <i>Urtica dioica</i>, and large
clusters of sharp edged <i>Restiaceae</i>. In this route through damp woods,
filled with some few ferns, I detected a slender tree about 16 feet high,
bearing flowers in panicles, axillary and terminal, scarcely distinct from
<i>Cryptocarya obovata</i> of Mr. Brown; also a parasitical plant,
<i>Dendrobium aemulum</i>, with a quadrangular stem.</p>
<p><i>29th. Thursday.</i> At an early hour we left our fire and followed the
descents from the mountain, in a direction to the northward of east, that
enables us to avoid all the deep creeks intersecting our route yesterday. In
this course I gathered specimens of the following:--<i>Crotalaria sp.</i>, a
slender tree having the habit of <i>Coronella</i>. <i>Glycine clandestina</i>.
<i>Ornitrophe sp.</i>, a large spreading tree; the red arilloe of the seeds of
the tree are eaten by the natives. <i>Croton sp.</i>, (or <i>Aleurites</i> ?),
specimens in flower, observed in fruit in the vicinity of Port Jackson.
<i>Melaleuca sp.</i>, closely allied to <i>M. viridiflora</i> (H.K.), a slender
tree 20 feet high; with some ferns, particularly a <i>Polypodium</i> allied to
<i>P. tenellum</i>, scandent on trees; and <i>Davallia caudata</i> (Brown). The
<i>Taxus</i>, a <i>Podocarpus</i> habited tree. <i>Crinum pedunculatum</i>, and
the caulescent <i>Caladium</i>, are common in these woods, which are matted
together with <i>Rhipogonum album</i>, <i>Smilax australis</i>, and other
volubilous and scandent plants. I gathered specimens of a species of
<i>Rubus</i>, growing with the British <i>Urtica</i> in large bodies. We saw
numbers of the lyre-tailed pheasant, but they were very shy, not allowing us
any chance of shooting them. My servant, however, ran down a young hen bird
unable to fly. I set out with my servant and a native as a guide and assistant
from the hut at 7 a.m., for another remarkable eminence on the ridge of the
mountain belt, called Cap or Molle Hill, which has a round top from a near land
view of it, but at a distance out at sea appears at particular bearings
perfectly flat, and has been frequently taken for the Hat Hill of Captains Cook
and Flinders. Our guide directed our route over a large portion of rising rich
pastureland, thinly wooded with common <i>Eucalypti</i>, till we entered the
brushes conducting us to the base of the hill, comprised for the most part of
plants already observed.</p>
<p>In the steep ascent many interesting specimens made their appearance,
particularly <i>Aster argophyllus</i> of Labillardi&egrave;re [= <i>Olearia
argophylla</i>], of large growth, in an abundant flowering state; and a tall
gigantic shrub with long terminal branches, panicles of pentandrous flowers,
and woolly petioled oblong leaves, observed elsewhere in New South Wales.</p>
<p>A spreading tree, 20-25 feet high, of <i>Laurinex</i> of rare appearance, in
young fruit, with large broad elliptical triple-nerved leaves, glacuous
beneath, proves to be <i>Tetranthera dealbata</i> of Mr. Brown [= <i>Litsea
dealbata</i>], (the <i>Laurus myrrha</i> of Father Loureiro), figured by
Plukenet from specimens sent him probably by Mr. James Cunningham, a surgeon in
the East India Company's Service, resident at Canton, of whose extensive
knowledge in botany that author makes frequent mention in his "Amaltheum
Botanicurn." Throughout the whole ascent <i>Bignonia australis</i> [= <i>Tecoma
australis</i>] overruns the tops of the other shrubs, to whose dark foliage its
clusters of flowers give an air of lightness.</p>
<p>About one p.m. we arrived at the summit of Molle Hill, which, by no means so
elevated as Hat Hill, nevertheless commands an extensive view to the seaward.
Being much more to the southward, the true formation of Lake Illowree can be
well traced from the sea to the westward, and presents from this elevation a
beautiful sheet of water. As on Hat Hill, this mount has little novelty, being
chiefly clothed with the vegetation of Port Jackson. The declivities and
overhanging rocks furnished me with specimens of <i>Blandfordia grandiflora</i>
(Brown). <i>Xanthorrhoea sp.</i>, with a few seeds. <i>Epacris crassifolia</i>
(Bn.), a beautiful flowering plant; and another rigid plant of the same kindred
family, <i>Dracophyllum secundum</i>, of which I sent seeds to England per
"Harriet." <i>Xerotes tennifolia</i>. A purple-flowered <i>Solanum</i>, a
suffruticose plant. With a few ferns, particularly <i>Gleichenia speluncae</i>
of Mr. Brown. I again noticed the <i>Podocarpus</i>-looking plant. Some trees
we passed this day were 35 and 40 feet high. The rocks on the summit of Molle
or Cap Hill are bold and bluff to the northward and eastward, and are of the
prevailing sandstone of Sydney. About 4 p.m. we had descended and had returned
to our temporary quarters, the thunder from the mountains hastening our
despatch.</p>
<p><i>31st. Saturday.</i> I took a walk in the confined brushes in the environs
of the farm, but found, in consequence of the quantity of rain that had fallen
this morning, it was vain to collect flowering specimens, and in reality the
route I took furnished me with nothing but what I had seen before, excepting a
twining shrub, perhaps of <i>Urticaceae</i>. About 2 p.m. I packed up all my
specimens and returned to my original headquarters at Illawarra, or Five
Islands farm.</p>
<p><i>1818. November 3rd. Tuesday.</i> This day I visited Lake Allowree, on the
margins of which I expected to make some further discoveries in botany. The
woods and close-shaded bottoms we passed afforded me little variety or
deviation from the individual specimens of which frequent mention has been
made. The following few interesting plants, however, are the results of this
day's investigations. <i>Achras australis</i> of Mr. Brown, a slender timber,
beneath which I gathered a quantity of the seeds. A twining plant of
<i>Asclepiadaceae</i>, <i>Marsdenia rostrata</i> of Mr. Brown. The
<i>Podocarpus</i> so often examined, I found to-day bearing last year's male
flowers upon it, of which I gathered specimens. <i>Hibiscus heterophyllus</i>
skirts these woods, also the <i>Gossypium</i>-habited tree, and another with
ternate, oblong leaves, having much the appearance and character of Mr. Brown's
<i>Flindersia</i>; I saw but a single tree, but that without any appearance of
fruit or flower to determine its genus. Descending through a brush of dwarf
sapling <i>Casuarina</i>, the ground being covered with the native <i>Viola
sp.</i>, we came out upon the margin of the Lake, which is extensive, but very
shoaly on its expanded surface, Pelicans, ducks, teal and some other aquatic
birds were swimming, and in detached parties I observed natives of the
Lake--their hereditary property in possession--in canoes, spearing fish, which
is said to be abundant. The most moderate calculation of the dimensions of this
lake is, from east to west 12 miles, and from north to south about 16 miles.
Its supply from the sea is over a flat low part of the beach not exceeding 100
yards wide, whose channel has about 9 feet of water at the flood tide,
sufficient to allow some small shark and an abundance of porpoises to pass to
the lake. Its margins are covered with a dead seaweed and <i>Salicornia
indica</i>, with a delicate plant in tufts, the <i>Mimulus repens</i> of Mr.
Brown.</p>
<p>On the more elevated grassy lands I gathered specimens of some small plants
of <i>Melanthaceae</i> and <i>Asphodeleae</i>, viz. <i>Burchardia
umbellata</i>, and <i>Tricoryne elatior</i> of Mr. Brown, with a small
flowering <i>Craspedia Richea</i> (Labillardi&egrave;re). Approaching rain with
thunder warned us to return, which we did by shaping our course along the sea
shore, where I gathered specimens of an <i>Acacia</i> in fruit, a shrub of
depressed growth, frequently procumbent on the sands. A genus of
<i>Solanaceae</i> (<i>Duboisia</i> of Mr. Brown), I found in flower, of which I
gathered specimens. <i>Myoporum ellipticum</i> and <i>M. acuminatum</i>, the
latter a small tree, furnished me with ripe seeds. Barely outside the high
water mark, <i>Calystegia reniformis</i> of Mr. Brown, <i>Atriplex halimus</i>
and <i>Spinifex sericeus</i>, clothe the beach, the former bearing abundance of
its purple flowers. In some low boggy grounds on the western side of the
boundary ridges, <i>Menyanthes exaltata</i> or <i>Villarsia parnassifolia</i>
was noticed, and I detected a new species of <i>Stackhousia</i>, with slender
filiform leaves and small yellow flowers.</p>
<p><i>4th. Wednesday.</i> In a walk I took southerly in the afternoon, on the
beach, I added some few specimens and seeds to my gradually augmenting
collection:--<i>Dolichos reliculatus</i> (H.K.) <i>Apium prostratum</i> of
Ventenat and Labillardi&egrave;re. <i>Spinifex sericeus</i>, female flowering
specimens. <i>Croton sp.</i>, leaves linear, male flowers, large white seeds.
<i>Leontodon sp.</i>, specimens in flower, and ripe seeds; on rocks. On the
rocky points besides <i>Correa alba</i>, <i>Westringia Dampieri</i>,
<i>Scaevola suaveolens</i>, <i>Plectranthus australis</i>, I gathered seeds of
a dwarf stunted shrub of <i>Casuarina</i>.</p>
<p><i>5th. Thursday.</i> Repeated observations prove the necessity of leaving
the immediate shores to seek for botanical novelty, which appears only to exist
in the deep recesses of dark woods under the mountain range, where the most
luxuriant vigour of vegetation is contrasted with its final dissolution, and
where the mind is presented with a striking picture of the operations of
nature, who, when thus left to herself, never destroys but that she may again
create. I have now determined to spend 5 or 6 days in these shades as
profitably as possible, and intend therefore to make my headquarters at the
bark hut of a friend, whose frequent kind solicitations to be allowed to assist
and forward me in my pursuits, I am happy now to afford the pleasurable
occasion. Having therefore made arrangements relative to the airing of my green
specimens on hand, which I leave at the Five Island farm till my return, I set
out with my servant and packhorse, laden with paper and other necessaries for
the period I propose being away.</p>
<p>My intended headquarters is on the south west side of the Lake, distant
about 12 miles from Illawarra, towards which we commenced our journey at 9 a.m.
Nothing can exceed the rich luxuriance of the grasses of the fine grazing land
we passed over in the first 4 miles, the great nourishment of which is
abundantly demonstrated by the many head of large well-bodied cattle grazing
thereon. Arriving at a small rivulet that intersected our course, running
easterly from the range, we forded it and passed through an intricate but
interesting brush, where I observed some shrubs not in flower or fruit
different from any previously detected. From these thickets southerly, the
forest grazing grounds continue, occasionally interrupted by small brooks or
creeks of running water. The many well-beaten cross-paths of cattle
intersecting one another, having led us imperceptibly off our own true course,
it was late before we even reached the borders of the western extremes of the
Lake, and being overtaken by a heavy drenching rain, with thunder and
lightning, I thought it advisable to halt for the day, 5 miles short of my
ultimate destination, at a temporary hut on the lake.</p>
<p><i>6th. Friday.</i> Wishing to examine some close confined thickets in the
neighbourhood of the hut, I did not change my headquarters this day, which was
for the most part occupied in the investigation of the botany around. Among the
many valuable trees already made mention of, I discovered the
following:--<i>Asclepiadaceae</i>, <i>Lyonsia straminea</i> (Brown), a large
twining shrub, in fruit. <i>Xylocarpus sp.</i>, a tree of moderate size.
<i>Acalypha sp.</i>, a shrub. <i>Logania sp.</i>, allied to <i>L.
Longifolia</i>, the plant agrees with <i>L. revoluta</i> in habit, but has no
perceptible pubescence about it; a slender shrub. <i>Rhamnus sp.</i> <i>Cissus
sp.</i>, very nearly related to <i>C. antarctica</i>, of which I gathered
seeds. <i>Myrtus trinervia</i> [= <i>Rhodamnia trinervia</i>] in young fruit.
<i>Eugenia elliptica</i> forms a large tree in these woods, and <i>Sterculia
heterophylla</i>, very frequent in the Western Interior, I found full of fruit,
from which I gathered ripe seeds. A large twiggy shrub with ovate attenuate
toothed scabrous leaves, but in no stage of flower or fruit; its acute terminal
bud and bleeding character when broken, would indicate its genus to be
<i>Ficus</i>. A twining shrub of <i>Cunoniaceae</i>, intermediate between
<i>Weinmannia</i> and <i>Ceratopetalum</i>, afforded me very handsome flowering
specimens. Its branches, with <i>Clerodendron tomentosum</i>, of very luxuriant
growth, and <i>Bignonia australis</i> = <i>Tecoma australis</i>] top all other
plants, frequently climbing over the robust lofty arms of the Red Cedar trees,
and reclining on the heads of the smaller arbusculae. <i>Nicotiana
undulata</i>, <i>Myosotis australis</i>, and a plant with a small single seeded
fruit in small clusters,[*] are common plants on the verge of these
thickets.</p>
<blockquote>[* This climbing plant agrees with <i>Sicyos angulata</i> (Linn.),
originally figured by Hermann.]</blockquote>
<p><i>7th. Saturday.</i> About the hour of 8 we departed from the hut on the
lake, directing our course over fine forest land to our intended headquarters
with more than ordinary caution, to prevent being led a second time out of our
road by the many paths leading to all points of the compass. At 11 a.m. we
arrived at our destination, after a long route through much rising uneven
ground, and taking possession of a comfortable spare apartment recently
attached to the bark hut, I prepared myself to visit the woods near the farm.
About half a mile to the westward of this Australian farm house, some extensive
confined thickets, to which I directed my attention, employed us during the
remaining part of the day. I gathered the following:--<i>Tetranthera
dealbata</i> (Brown), a tree 25-30 feet high, in young fruit. <i>Duboisia
myoporoides</i>, some finer specimens than I have before possessed; this tree
which varies from 12-20 feet in height, has a remarkably thick corky bark.
<i>Buettneriaceae</i>, a subvolubilous plant with a terminal raceme of yellow
flowers; leaves alternate, minutely denticulated, and smooth. On the banks of a
muddy stream I gathered a small plant which appears to be Mr. Brown's
<i>Heliotropium asperrimum</i>. A large volubilous plant of considerable
length, which I suspect is related to the <i>Menispermaceae</i>, is common in
the dark forests to which we penetrated, wherein the tropical palm
<i>Seaforthia elegans</i>, <i>Corypha australis</i>, and the arborescent
<i>Urtica</i> in all stages, are very abundant. Of the latter I could discover
no traces of fructification, but I gathered a quantity of the Fan Palm
(<i>Corypha australis</i>). Of the ferns, of which these humid shades are
productive, I collected the following:--<i>Pteris nuduiscula</i>, <i>P.
falcata</i> (Br.), <i>P. umbrosa</i> (Br.), <i>Adiantum hispidulum</i> (Br.),
<i>Lindsaea microphylla</i> (Br.), <i>Asplenium flabellifolium</i>,
<i>Dicksonia davalloides</i> Br., and <i>Doodia caudata</i> Bn.</p>
<p><i>8th. Sunday.</i> Particularly fine and favourable weather for drying my
specimens.</p>
<p><i>9th. Monday.</i> I prepared this day to visit (if possible) the summit of
the main range overhanging the extreme boundary of the farm, although from the
elevated, bluff, perpendicular appearance of its rocky face, I had little hopes
of reaching this lofty part of the ridge. To ensure the most practicable ascent
I secured, for a little tobacco, the most useful assistance of a native, with
whom we started at 8 a.m. on a south-westerly course for the eminence in view.
At 11 a.m., having passed over much hilly fine grazing forest land, we arrived
at the base of the range, where on rocks in the bed of a running creek, taking
its rise in the mountains, I commenced collecting the few interesting plants
detected in this day's route. <i>Urticaceae</i>. <i>Boehmeria sp.</i>, a
succulent plant with procumbent radicant herbaceous stems, appears allied to
Forster's <i>Elatostemma</i>. A species of <i>Piper</i>, the first I have
observed in Australia, very abundant on the mossy decayed stems of trees, with
a species of <i>Pteris</i>. The pepper appears to be the same as <i>Piper
reflexum</i> of Linn. and Swartz, already found on islands in the Pacific
Ocean, as well as in the West Indies, and at the Cape of Good Hope.</p>
<p>Ascending the steep sides of the mountain through thick brushes of
<i>Croton</i> and the same description of plants as observed on the sides of
Molle or Cap Hill (particularly <i>Aster argophyllus</i> and <i>Bursaria
spinosa</i>) we reached the summit early in the afternoon, and found scarcely
any other than the common plants of New South Wales, presumptive proofs that
the whole ridge is of the same character, and that the most rare, desirable and
valuable plants are inhabitants of the shaded ravines at its base, I gathered
some papers of seeds of the following:--<i>Deeringia celosioides</i>, a genus
of <i>Amarantaceae</i>. <i>Ficus rubiginosa</i>, a large tree 60-80 feet high,
with very extraordinary alated base. <i>Trochocarpa laurina</i>. <i>Pimelea
sp.</i>, allied to <i>P. ligustrina</i>, capitulum of flowers conical. And
<i>Helichrysum sp.</i>, a tall suffruticose plant.</p>
<p>The native, our guide, espied, on a tree, an opossum (<i>Didelphis</i>),
having many of the habits of the ring tailed species (<i>caudivolva</i>). It
was a female and her cub. They were asleep, hanging by the claws, among the
topmost shoots of a slender <i>Eucalyptus piperita</i>. It has no tail; it has
the thick bluff head of the wombat, with strong incisor teeth, but does not
burrow in the earth as that harmless, easily domesticated animal.[*] The length
of the mother was 28 inches, and its weight upwards Of 30 lbs.; the cub was
about half grown, its length not exceeding a foot; it was covered with a fine
thick grey fur. The Australian killed the parent in order the better to carry
her down the range, but the young one, at my suggestion, and request, was
suffered to live, and was carefully brought to the Farm hut. The heat of the
day had brought out snakes from their retreats in the hollow trunks of fallen
timber, and it required the utmost caution to avoid treading upon them as they
lay basking in the beaten paths among the high grass. At dusk we returned to
the Farm hut, having had a fine day for the ill-paid excursion we had made.</p>
<blockquote>[* This seems to have been a native bear.]</blockquote>
<p><i>10th. Tuesday.</i> I employed myself in some gullies under the range,
with a view of collecting any few remaining flowering specimens that might be
worth attention. I gathered the following:--<i>Cryptocarya glaucescens</i>, a
tree 40 feet high. <i>Cynoglossum latifolium</i> (Br.), a small plant, on the
banks of fresh-water streams: <i>Gratiola latifolia</i> (Br.), in similar
situations. <i>Prostanthe</i>ra caerulea (Br.), a large strong scented shrubby
plant. Tetranthera dealbata, I observed to-day in young fruit; and I gathered
another paper of the seeds of <i>Eustrephus latifolius</i>, with finer
specimens of the aphyllous twining shrub of <i>Urtiaceae</i>, having monoecious
succulent racemes of flowers, first discovered on the 31st ultimo.</p>
<p><i>11th. Wednesday.</i> At an early hour we left the farm, with all my
luggage, for my original headquarters at Illawarra, which I hoped to reach at
midday, in order to pack up all the plants and prepare for taking my departure
for Parramatta early to-morrow morning. In the rich grassy lands I gathered
specimens of <i>Xerotes mucronata</i> and <i>Daviesia sp.</i>, allied to <i>D.
acicularis</i>, in young fruit. In some dark woods I detected a small tree of
<i>Cryptocarya sp.</i>, differing from <i>C. glaucescens</i> in having a
tomentum on the under surface of the foliage. About one p.m. I halted for an
hour at the bark hut of another settler, having heard I might possibly procure
good seeds of a species of palm (<i>Seaforthia elegans</i>), the Bangla, very
frequent in the moist woods in the neighbourhood, and of which I had made much
inquiry during my stay at the Five Islands. With the assistance of some people
on the farm with axes, I caused several specimens 40-50 feet high to be fallen,
laden with fruit, which I, however, found far from being ripe. They afforded me
specimens that may prove the identity of the plant as being the same observed
by me on the north coast on the 14th April last. It would seem, from the
present state of the fruit, that it ripens about March next, and that as they
arrive at maturity they fall off and furnish a substantial aliment to the
numerous large birds (particularly pigeons) inhabiting these woods.</p>
<p><i>12th. Thursday.</i> I sent off a pack-horse, laden, to the foot of the
mountain, about 10 miles north of the Five Islands, with directions that the
man and horse should return to me early in the afternoon, in order to be ready
to take off the remaining load of my luggage and collections early in the
morning. I gathered <i>Myostis australis</i> in flower and fruit.</p>
<p><i>13th. Friday.</i> At 5 a.m. I finally left the Five Islands Farm, with
the remaining part of my collection, for the foot of the mountain, and arrived
at the settler's hut there early in the forenoon. Having made some necessary
arrangements relative to the conveyance of my luggage up the mountain on the
morrow, I took a walk into the shaded woods at its base, of which the plants,
although very interesting, are uniformly the same as those in similar
situations, of which frequant mention has been already made. I gathered
duplicate flowering specimens of <i>Rubus sp.</i>, <i>Oxalis sp.</i>, a small
creeping pubescent plant; and duplicate specimens in fruit of a large twining
shrub, <i>Lyonsia straminea</i>. In grassy exposed situations of the beach I
detected an annual <i>Hibiscus</i> in flower and fruit.</p>
<p><i>14th. Saturday.</i> The whole of this day was occupied in carrying up my
luggage to the hut on the mountain top.</p>
<p><i>17th. Tuesday.</i> At 6 a.m. we left the temporary hut on the mountain
top for the farmhouse of Mr. Middleton where my Govt. cart was left in
charge...I made no discoveries of any moment.</p>
<p><i>19th. Thursday.</i> The rugged stage of 15 miles from the mountain top to
this farm had so worn off the shoes of my poor horse as to render re-shoeing
indispensable...I therefore determined to lose no time but to proceed with my
cart together with the whole of my collection towards Parramatta where we
arrived at the close of the afternoon.[*]</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII</h2>
<h3>THE SECOND VOYAGE OF THE "MERMAID" TO THE NORTH-WEST COAST</h3>
<p>The "Mermaid" had completed a voyage to Tasmania at the beginning of the
year 1819, when Cunningham, who accompanied King thither, brought back with him
a variety of Tasmanian plants. On May 8, 1819, King sailed again from Sydney to
continue his exploration of the north and north-west coasts from where he had
left them on May 31, 1818. Cunningham again went with him. In this voyage King
left the harbour in company with the "Lady Nelson" under Oxley, who voyaged
with King as far as Port Macquarie, and after surveying that harbour and the
Hastings River the "Lady Nelson" returned to Port Jackson.</p>
<p>On landing at Port Macquarie, Cunningham thought three-fourths of the plants
that he saw there resembled those of the Illawarra. On an arm of the river near
Rawdon Island he found, however, a fig-tree of gigantic growth, as well as a
new palm, which seldom attained more than twelve feet in height. The forests on
the Hastings also abounded in rosewood and red cedar and several kinds of
<i>Laurineae</i> and <i>Meliaceae</i>, of small diameter, that he believed
would be useful timbers for building and ornamental for furniture, thickly and
beautifully covered the river banks. On May 31st the "Mermaid" left the
port.</p>
<p>From Port Macquarie, King threaded his way up the east coast, following in
the tracks of Cook and Flinders, and examined its shores thoroughly. Lieutenant
Jeffreys, in H.M.S. "Kangaroo" in 1815, had already surveyed this portion of
the mainland.</p>
<p>In describing the "Mermaid's" route to Sir Joseph Banks, who, since the days
of Cook's voyage, had taken a deep interest in the botany of Australia,
Cunningham wrote:[* Letter dated November 9, 1819.]</p>
<p>"Coasting along northerly up the east coast, our first anchorage was on the
30th May in a bay (Rodd's Bay) just without the Tropic, a little to the
southward of Flinders' Port Curtis, where, during our short stay, I made some
additions to the foundation of the collection formed originally at Port
Macquarie. On the shores of this bay I observed, among others, plants detected
in the last voyage on the north coast, originally discovered in the Gulf of
Carpentaria and elsewhere by Mr. Brown. On the 3rd of June we anchored again
under one of the Percy Isles (No. 1),[*] and remaining there the whole of the
next day, a favourable opportunity was afforded me to examine the botany of
this elevated island. On the 8th of June an opportunity enabled me to land upon
one of the islands in Captain Cook's Repulse Bay,[**] which afforded me, among
other plants, a beautiful nondescript <i>Bossiaea</i>, not observed elsewhere.
The next day a landing was effected under that great navigator's Cape Conway
(in a small bight on the north side), and other parts of Whit Sunday Passage,
each of which furnished me with some increase to the specimens and seeds. At
Cleveland Bay (off whose Cape we arrived on the 14th)[***] our stay to complete
our water from some gullies at its head enabled me to make several excursions
on the bold rocky hills on its shores; each ridge of the hills and even the
more depressed flat...on the spurs presented novelties or interesting
specimens."</p>
<blockquote>[* "I anchored in the westernmost sandy bay of No. 1 Percy Island
of Captain Flinders to the westward of the small Pine
Islet."--King.]</blockquote>
<blockquote>[** One of the Repulse Isles.]</blockquote>
<blockquote>[*** Now Townsville.]</blockquote>
<p>No natives were seen at Cape Cleveland, although King counted nine derelict
huts in different places close to the beach and saw footprints on the sand. A
fresh green coco-nut, recently tapped for milk, and some bamboos were picked
up. The air was swarming with butterflies, probably of the same variety as
those Cook had met with at Thirsty Sound: "The stem of every grasstree was
crowded with them, and when they were on the wing the air appeared in perfect
motion."</p>
<p>"On Palm Island, in Halifax Bay, and more particularly on the islands in
Rockingham Bay (where we remained the whole of the 20th)," continues Cunningham
to Banks, "I found plants common to both Indies, viz.: <i>Sophora
tomentosa</i>, <i>Guilandina bonduc</i>, and a beautiful purple-flowering
<i>Melastoma</i> (<i>M. Banksii</i>), a splendid South American genus, of whose
existence in Terra Australis I had not the most distant idea. On the shore of a
lofty wooded island (Goold Island), in the latter bay (Rockingham Bay), we had
our first communication with the natives, who came off to us in their small
bark canoes and received us in a peaceable, quiet manner, having previously
sent their women across the island.[*] In our run along the coast from this bay
I landed upon one of the Family Islands (the north easternmost) for a few
moments, and occupied the whole of the 23rd of June[**] in the elevated woods
of Fitzroy Island, off Cape Grafton, where, among other plants, I detected a
species of <i>Myristica</i> in fruit, which may be an original discovery of
your own in that celebrated voyage of Captain Cook, whose track we followed to
Endeavour River, where we arrived on the 27th of that month,[***] anchoring
under the south shore, about the particular spot where the 'Endeavour' had been
hove down 50 years since."</p>
<blockquote>[* "The natives came alongside the "Mermaid" in five canoes and
ventured on board. Upon leaving the ship they pointed to their huts and invited
the English by signs to return their visit."--King.]</blockquote>
<blockquote>[** At this time King traced with great care the coast between
Double Point and Frankland Island, which Cook "passed in the night and did not
see." When the "Mermaid" passed Point Cooper, "the summit of the back hills
were named by Mr. Cunningham's desire after John Bellenden-Ker,
Esq."--King.]</blockquote>
<blockquote>[*** After anchoring successively on the 22nd at Fitzroy Island, on
the 24th at Snapper Island (of Jelfreys), and on the 25th at Weary Bay,
examining Blomfield's Rivulet.]</blockquote>
<h4>ENDEAVOUR RIVER</h4>
<p>"Our protracted detention till the 12th July at this memorable part of the
eastern coast was occasioned by a temporary loss we had previously suffered off
the cloud-capped mountainous land of Cape Tribulation, by the swamping of one
of our most serviceable whaleboats, which we replaced by building another from
the frames of a spare boat we had with us; and thus the convenient south shore
of Endeavour River--which, most probably has never been visited since the
departure of Captain Cook in 1770--has been a second time converted into a
temporary dockyard .[*] Here was a period of 14 days that might have been
wholly at my disposal, had it not been for the annoyances experienced from the
prowling natives, who made a rather determined but unsuccessful attack upon the
boat-builders while I was at some distance from the cutter on an excursion to
the...ranges of hills bounding the grassy flat land southerly (these natives
had to be dispersed by firing a gun).</p>
<blockquote>[* The "Mermaid" anchored "in all probability in the same spot
where Cook had landed his stores."--King. King now named Mount Cook, in honour
of the great seaman.]</blockquote>
<p>"In my various daily walks...during the first week of our stay, much
pleasure was derived in tracing your steps with those of...Dr. Solander, and
detecting many plants then discovered, that in all probability have never been
seen in a living state since that period; among which you...may call to
remembrance the <i>Grevillea gibbosa</i>, in flower and fruit, so prevalent on
the rocky hills; the beautiful bluish flowering <i>Nymphaea</i> (like the late
Dr. Roxburgh's <i>N. versicolor</i>), expanding itself on the surface of the
chains of stagnant pools in the lower lands; and the ornamental <i>Melastoma
Banksii</i> above-mentioned, clothing the muddy shaded banks of these small
ponds. The rocky gullies, trickling with small runs of water, afforded me scope
for much minute research; particularly the delicate filiform minute
<i>Stylidia</i>; some small <i>Eriocaula</i> and <i>Xyrides</i> appeared to
abound, with some others of the gentian family, delighting in a humid shallow
soil.</p>
<p>"Among the plants observed on a strip of sandy desert under the range of
hills to the southward of our anchorage, I was successful in collecting a
number of bulbs, which could be but barely traced by the existence of slight
vestiges of decayed foliage lying on the surface of the sand. The summits of
the ridges, and more especially the northern sandy shore, added some
interesting plants. On the arid wastes...I gathered a most beautiful plant of
the <i>Dilleniaceae:</i> <i>Hemistemma Banksii</i> of Mr. Brown.</p>
<p>"It was a subject of much regret that, in consequence of the rupture with
the natives, my walks were...much circumscribed or else wholly prevented. I had
determined (in an absence of two days, at least, from the vessel) upon an
excursion to the more distant and loftier hills, where woods densely matted to
their summits would doubtless have afforded considerable scope for research.
This however was wholly frustrated by the decidedly hostile dispositions of
these Australians, and the smallness of our company not allowing me two or
three armed men as a guard...in distant walks. I trust, however, that the
specimens gathered at Endeavour River will prove an acceptable renovation of
the plants preserved at Soho Square and originally discovered by yourself and
Dr. Solander in July and August, 1770."</p>
<p>In his remarks upon the inhabitants, Cunningham says: "It appears rather
singular that of a dozen natives, with whom we communicated a day or two
previous to the commencement of open hostilities, and who were very
communicative, they had no idea of the word kangaroo, although they knew the
animal we spoke of, as well by our signs as by its frequency on the rocky hills
around us. The animal bearing the generally established name of kangaroo
throughout Europe they called Mauya (or Menuah)."[*]</p>
<blockquote>[* Banks and Cook both called it kangaroo, and said that it was so
described by the natives seen there. King says he saw the same people and
thought that the word had become obsolete. It is possible that these seen by
King were of another tribe, since the language sometimes differs within the
limits of a small area. Near King's tent some pieces of coal were picked up,
which he says no doubt were relies of Cook's visit, which had lain undisturbed
for nearly half a century.]</blockquote>
<p>He continues: "Having examined the river itself, laid down its soundings,
several miles from the sea[*] and launched our new boat for future service on
the N. and N.W. coasts, we departed on the morning of the 12th July, with an
intention to double Cape York...And in the meantime, in coasting towards that
promontory, to lay down the true trendings of the coast north from Cape
Bedford, about where Captain Cook stood off, on account of the dangerous reefs
with which it was feared its shores were invested, and which, although
partially surveyed in 1815 by Lieutenant Jeffreys in the "Kangaroo", armed
brig, required a more correct definition (owing to its sinuous outline)."</p>
<blockquote>[* This appears to have been the first exploration of Endeavour
River since the days of Cook. Roe, who went in charge of the party, found its
waters fresh at nine miles from its mouth. He followed a tortuous channel
through low country, and passed the mangrove forests described by Banks. Where
the party turned back, the river's width was not more than six yards. Another
arm on the north side was not examined.]</blockquote>
<p>On his way up the coast Jeffreys had drawn a chart which King says did him
very great credit, for he filled in the space between Endeavour River and Cape
Direction, unseen by Cook.</p>
<p>Jeffreys had left Port Jackson on April 19, 1815, bound to Ceylon with a
detachment of troops. On his way to Wreck Reef (of Flinders) he experienced
thick weather, which made it unsafe to steer through the narrow channels in the
Barrier Reefs, and sought a passage by what is now called the Inner Route.[*]
On April 28th he rounded Breaksea Spit and entering Harvey Bay anchored off
Sandy Point. From there he sailed to Port Bowen, where he watered his ship,
being detained in this harbour for several days by a gale. Throughout the month
of May he followed Cook's tracks as nearly as possible within the
Northumberland and Cumberland Islands, and to-day two rocks in the Duke Group
are called, after him, Jeffrey's Rocks. While passing through Whit Sunday
Passage he gave its name to Port Molle, and on Molle Island a grassy hill is
also known as Mount Jeffreys.</p>
<blockquote>[* Captain Cripps in the brig "Cyclops," Port Jackson to Bengal,
was the first to pursue the Inner Route in 1812. His vessel being crank he was
afraid to sail the outer passage and followed Cook's track after making the
land at Bustard Bay, but apparently he has left no chart showing his actual
route.]</blockquote>
<p>The parts of the coast which Cook had passed in the night Jeffreys now saw
by daylight, and placed them upon his chart. At Cape Sandwich (Rockingham Bay)
some fruit--wild currants possibly--was obtained from the natives, who were
quite friendly. On May 29th, having passed Cape Flattery and Endeavour River
(where Cook steered away from the coast) the "Kangaroo" continued to sail along
the unexplored part of the land during the daytime, anchoring at night under
one of the innumerable reefs or shoals which line the shore. At one point he
saw, seven to nine miles away, the loom of the Great Barrier Reef; the
continuation of this had been first discovered at Cape Grafton. Snapper Island,
seen, but left unnamed, by Cook, was now named by Jeffreys.</p>
<p>In tracing the coast between Cape Flattery and Cape Weymouth Jeffreys seems
to have been an active explorer, discovering and christening among other places
Cape Bowen, Port Ninian (Ninian Bay) Cape Melville, and Princess Charlotte Bay.
This he observed to be an extensive bay at least thirty miles in depth, its
neighbouring shores presenting a fertile inland country interspersed with
trees; while off its eastern head was a group of five islands which Jeffreys
named Flinders Group. Farther northward a deep indentation in the mainland
between Cape Direction and Cape Weymouth was called Lloyd Bay.</p>
<p>On June 1st, in lat. 13&deg;32' S. and long. 143&deg;47' E., his ship passed
within ten yards of a mushroom coral rock about four feet under water (possibly
Obree Reef); the rays of the sun prevented the red colour of the water being
seen until the vessel was close to it. To the southward of Bolt Head the
"Kangaroo" grounded on another coral shoal, which could not be seen; this is
still called Kangaroo Shoal. On June 6th he rounded the northernmost shores of
Cape York, and found that York Island was a separate island and not a part of
the mainland as hitherto supposed. There he anchored for the night. The native
name of this small island is Wamilug. Jeffreys left it on June 7th, and passing
through Endeavour Strait spent the night at Booby Island. He reached Timor on
June 19th, where he remained until the 26th, and, continuing his voyage,
arrived safely on July 24th at Colombo.</p>
<p>Telling of the "Mermaid's" coming to the scene of Jeffreys' most important
discoveries, Cunningham writes:</p>
<p>"On the evening of the 13th, whilst standing round the outer island of a
group off the coast named by Jeffreys Flinders Group,[*] our progress was
stopped by the sudden appearance of the wreck of a large ship, which had been
hove upon the rocks in a small bay by the force of the surf. We anchored to the
westward of a projecting point of the Wreck Bay, named Cape Flinders in the
"Kangaroo's" chart[**] and upon landing found it was the hull of a large ship
called the "Frederick,"[***] the identical vessel that had been commanded by
Captain Williams, who left Port Jackson early in the year (1818) on his voyage
to India, for a cargo, by way of Torres Strait. As a number of her iron bolts,
blocks, etc., which were lying among the rocks, would be useful to the vessel,
Mr. King determined to spend a day at the wreck, which enabled me to add a few
specimens of plants to my collection, although generally of the same
description as those of Endeavour River.</p>
<blockquote>[* Flinders Group comprises five islands, viz. Stanley, Flinders,
Denham, Blackwood, and Maclear Islands, which form the western head of Bathurst
Bay.]</blockquote>
<blockquote>[** Cape Flinders is the northern extremity of Stanley
Island.]</blockquote>
<blockquote>[*** The "Frederick" was wrecked on the east side of Stanley
Island, the northernmost of the Flinders Group. We read in "The Sydney
Gazette," May 15, 1819: "The ship 'Frederick' was lying at anchor in Torres
Strait (within the Barrier Reef) in company with the 'Wellington' (Captain
Collins), and the' Lynx' (Captain Siddons) in the month of September (1818).
Between six and seven in the morning, when getting under weigh, she went
broadside on a reef and canted on her side. She fired distress signals, which
were answered by the 'Wellington,' who hoisted out her boats, but it was too
late to render help. The 'Lynx' was far ahead, and did not know of the
disaster. The long-boat took 21 persons on board, 5 casks of powder, salt meat
and peas, but neither bread nor water. Captain Williams with five others left
in the jolly-boat. It is feared that the long-boat was lost in Endeavour
Straits. The jolly-boat reached the ' Wellington,' and arrived at Timor en
route for Bengal." When he called at Coepang in the November following, King
learned that the master and four of the crew had arrived there safely, but the
long-boat had been given up as lost.]</blockquote>
<p>"I here collected a few more bulbs of a large kind, apparently the same
plant as that at Endeavour River, which I have suspected may prove to be the
<i>Crinum angustifolium</i> of Mr. Brown, touching at Sunday Island, of the
late Admiral Bligh, near Cape Grenville, on the 22nd July, off which we
remained at anchor all the day in Margaret Bay."[*]</p>
<blockquote>[* King had tried to find an anchorage first at Bligh's Restoration
Island, but the ground was too rocky. Before arriving at this island he had
named Claremont Isles, Night and Young Islands and the Home
Islands.]</blockquote>
<p>On July 24th, continuing to steer northward, the "Mermaid" passed close to
the western shores of the Bird Isles of Captain Cook. Eight or ten natives
stood to gaze at the passing ship and two canoes were seen hauled up on the
beach. Sailing outside Hannibal and McArthur Groups, shortly after noon King
came abreast of Cook's Orfordness and Bligh's Pudding-Pan-Hill. He passed
within Cairncross Island, noticeable for the long reef off its south point, and
at 3-30 p.m. steered for Bligh's Turtle Island. Attracted, however, by the
river-like opening near Newcastle Bay, he hauled in to examine it; while he was
standing towards it the water suddenly shoaled and the vessel struck, and
afterwards continued to beat against a hard, sandy bottom, with the result that
before King could bring her into deeper water she was very nearly thrown back
on the bank. To commemorate his ship's escape from the great danger she then
encountered, King named the opening Escape River. He now bore up for Turtle
Island; but, finding no suitable anchorage there, was at last obliged to anchor
"in an exposed situation without protection from wind or sea." At four next
morning, through the ring of the anchor breaking, it was lost, and King stood
away to the eastward of Albany Islands, towards Mount Adolphus.</p>
<h4>KING ROUNDS CAPE YORK</h4>
<p>In rounding Cape York, the most northerly point of the Australian continent,
King noticed its rugged hills, of which Mount Bremer forms the highest part,
and saw York Island, the little island lying off the cape, "of conical shape
and separated from it by a narrow rocky channel," its cone rising to a height
of 275 feet. The "Mermaid" sailed into Torres Strait through the channel
between Mount Adolphus and Albany Island, now known as Adolphus Channel, which
is the main waterway leading from the Inner Route to Torres Strait.</p>
<p>"We doubled Cape York on the 24th," resumes Cunningham and, pursuing Captain
Flinders' track,[*] sought anchorage off (the south end of) Good's Island, one
of the Prince of Wales's Islands, but without finding the particular spot on
which the celebrated navigator anchored.</p>
<blockquote>[* Round the north side of Wednesday Island.]</blockquote>
<p>"An unfortunate circumstance in bringing up, occasioned by the vessel's
dragging her anchor beyond the spot about which she came to, obliged us to
weigh again with a broken anchor; finding shelter under Booby Island,[*] we
bore up to the westward across the Gulf for the Wessel Isles on the north
coast. Thus, in a voyage...more immediately destined for survey, the chart of
this easterly coast, which had remained imperfect since the time of Captain
Cook, from Cape Bedford northerly to Cape York, has been at length completed.
And the plants gathered at different parts...will, I trust, when compared with
the journal (that I hope to transmit from Port Jackson), extend the knowledge
of the botany of New South Wales, as well as enable botanists at home to trace
the wide diffusion of many remarkable intertropical genera through several
parallels of latitude.</p>
<blockquote>[* King did not again attempt to anchor at Booby Island, for having
lost two anchors he would not risk losing a third.</blockquote>
<p>On the north coast, after making Wessel's Islands (at daylight on the 27th),
our progress was more rapid to the westward, the line of coast forming but few
bights of importance,[*]...till the 4th August, when we dropped anchor in a bay
with a river at its head, named Liverpool River, in honour of the noble Lord of
the Treasury, which we examined about 40 miles to the southward from our
anchorage. It bears all the character of the Alligator River of our last
voyage. We found fresh water about 12 or 14 miles from the sea, at flood tide,
where we also saw alligators, although by no means so numerous as those seen in
the two large rivers in Van Diemen's Gulf last year. The land on either side
this stream is extensive low grassy flats, subject to inundation, the soil...a
stiff clay. The survey of this coast (carried out in our last voyage) being now
completed to Cape Arnhem,[**] we anchored in our old ground (on August 8th) in
South-West Bay, Goulburn Island, to complete our wood and water, not being
certain of meeting with another supply whilst we might continue on that or the
N.W. coast."</p>
<blockquote>[* "On the 30th July anchored at the bottom of a bay inside a group
of islands which appear to be the Crocodils Eylandts of the old [Dutch] charts.
The bay was called after Viscount Castlereagh. "--King.]</blockquote>
<blockquote>[** Lieutenant John McCluer, while carrying out his surveys for the
Indian Government in 1790-91, brought his ships the "Panther" and "Endeavour"
towards the north coast of Australia and made Arnhem Land. He steered along
this part of the coast until it was found to dip away and then left it. The
point of his turning is placed in 11&deg;15' S. and this is the Cape Van Diemen
of old Dutch voyagers. McCluer did not land anywhere, but he ascertained the
positions of several small islands, shoals and projecting points, verifying
some of the early discoveries of the Dutch.]</blockquote>
<p>On the evening of the "Mermaid's" arrival at Goulburn Island, King landed
with a watering party to dig a well for water that came trickling down through
the cliffs. He then went to Bottle Rock to see if he could find the record he
had left there of his previous voyage. The bottle was gone and the rocks were
now covered with terns' eggs, of which the sailors gathered about eight dozen.
King sent the boat's crew in pursuit of a turtle which was perceived swimming
towards the beach, but they failed to trace it, and on their return reported
that they had seen the footmarks of natives and a dog in the sand. Next day Mr.
Bedwell took another party on shore; he found that the tide had reached the
hole the men had lately dug and spoilt the water, and the work had to be
re-done. Bedwell visited the "Mermaid's" former wooding place, and saw the
remains of old wood-cuttings there, though many had been burnt. On his return
to the watering party, who had begun their operations, a shower of large stones
was thrown down upon them from the cliffs above, on the edge of which a body of
natives suddenly appeared and as suddenly retreated when a volley of muskets
was fired over their heads from the boat.</p>
<p>"After a stay of 10 days," continues Cunningham, "during which I was
prevented landing, partly on account of indisposition and partly from the
mischievous disposition manifested by our last year's friends--the natives on
the islands--we weighed on August 18th and proceeded on our voyage to the
termination of our last year's examination of this coast at Clarence Strait and
Vernon Islands, which we did not reach till the 27th of that month.[*] Thence
the large bight of the coast line, named Joseph Buonaparte's Gulf on the French
charts, commences, at which we resumed our survey of the N.W. coast, viewing
Cape Van Diemen at the western part of the north coast. Our first anchorage was
on the 5th September, in a bay which has a trending off about 10 miles to the
southward and eastward and, being deeply invested with mangroves, was a very
unfavorable landing. It has been named Port Keats" (in compliment to Admiral
Sir Richard Keats).</p>
<blockquote>[* The "Mermaid" on her way passing between McCluer and New Year
Islands, and between New Year and Oxley Islands.]</blockquote>
<p>Before he reached Port Keats, King rounded Cape Van Diemen on August 23rd,
and steered a course down the west side of Bathurst Island, passing on the 26th
Cape Fourcroy of French seamen. On the following evening he sighted the shores
of the mainland on the south side of Clarence Strait. The land here had been
seen by King in May, 1818, and it was the last seen by him before he then left
the coast. "At daylight on August 28th," remarks King, "we found ourselves near
the land to the south-west of Vernon's Islands,[*] which were also in sight. To
the south was a deep opening, trending to the south-east, of a river-like
appearance, but as it did not seem to be of sufficient importance to detain us
we passed to the, westward." When he wrote these words, little did King dream
that on the eastern shores of the river-like opening, in future years, would
stand Darwin, the capital of the Northern Territory, and that the port within
it would become and (to quote from "Admiralty Sailing Directions ") "probably
will continue to be the principal port in the northern part of Australia, and
port of call for the largest steamers communicating with China, Singapore,
Java, and India."</p>
<blockquote>[* Three wooded coral islands: North-west Vernon, East Vernon, and
Southwest Vernon Islands.]</blockquote>
<p>"The land hereabouts is low," we read in King's journal, and thickly wooded
to the brink of the deep red-coloured cliffs...At the bottom of the opening was
a remarkable flat-topped hill, under which the waters of the inlet appeared to
flow in a south-east direction." The flat-topped hill is now designated King's
Table Hill, in his honour.</p>
<p>Sixteen miles to the south-westward of the opening, known to us as Port
Darwin, King saw a deep bight, which he called Paterson Bay.[*] It is now
called Port Patterson, and between these two openings the land appeared to him
at first "like an island," but was afterwards presumed to be "a projecting head
separating the opening (Port Darwin) from the deep bight (Port Patterson.)"
This projecting head was, of course, Cox or Douglas Peninsula, which separates
the two ports.</p>
<blockquote>[* In honour of Lieutenant-Governor William Paterson, who died in
1810.]</blockquote>
<p>Continuing his voyage King kept on a south-westerly course and at this time
seems to have closely compared with his own observations those made by the
French Commodore Baudin in 1801, when he explored the north-west coasts.
P&eacute;ron's Islands, one of which has a grassy peak nearly 100 feet high,
came in sight on the 2nd. (According to Dalrymple it was here that Tasman had
met with Australian natives.) King now named various parts of the coast,
including Point Blaze, Channel Point, Cliff Head, Anson Bay, and Cape Ford,
during his progress along the shore, and on September 4th saw Baudin's Cape
Dombey. The French charts showed islands in front of this cape under the name
of the Barth&eacute;lemy Islands. King found that they did not exist, and
transferred the name Barth&eacute;lemy to some hills seen over the low land on
shore. Their summit was named, by him, Mount Goodwin.</p>
<p>On arriving at Port Keats on September 5th a party put ashore at the only
accessible landing-place; its shores were overrun with mangroves, and, among
other plants, Cunningham found a stunted Eucalyptus six feet high. The usual
traces of natives were noticed, though none were seen, but their large fires
were blazing three miles away. No fresh water was obtained; and on the
following morning, September 8th, the "Mermaid" left the harbour to continue
her voyage. She soon lost sight of land, but next day Cape Hay, and on the 10th
Point Pearce, were visible. Round the last point the land trended to the
south-east, forming a deep indenture. Into this indentation (it has since been
discovered) the Fitzmaurice and Victoria Rivers discharge their waters.</p>
<p>At daylight on the 13th, from the "Mermaid's" track, the land behind her
about Point Pearce bore due east, and on this day a remarkable hill, answering
in position to one on Baudin's Lacrosse Island, was sighted to the
south-westward. King was prevented steering towards it by a shoal which
extended to the north-west and crossed his course. He anchored near it at
sunset. In his remarks he says: "After leaving Port Keats we met with large
quantities of a very beautiful species of medusa...It is from this animal the
French have named their Bane des Meduses." King had to round the north-west end
of the Medusa Banks, and the ship appeared then to have entered a channel,
since some shoals or narrow sand ridges formed another barrier along the
opposite side-these being now called King Shoals.</p>
<p>In this channel many medusae were seen, and also sea-snakes, of which a
curious one with a black back, being yellow underneath and having a striped
tail, was the most remarkable. King anchored two miles from the north-west end
of Lacrosse Island, which lies at the mouth of Cambridge Gulf, dividing its
entrance into two channels, being nearly midway between Capes Domett and
Dussejour.</p>
<h4>CAMBRIDGE GULP</h4>
<p>From Lacrosse Island (4 miles E. of C. Dussejour)[*] Cambridge Gulf extends
S.-S.-westerly for twenty-three miles to Adolphus Island, where it is divided
into two arms that running westward of Adolphus Island[**] extends for seven
miles, and then is again divided by a projecting point under View Hill. While
one stream runs eastward and unites with the East Arm, the other trends
southward and opens into an extensive basin eleven miles in length, which
contracts as it winds under the base of Bastion Hills. The shore opposite these
hills is low, and the gulf trends round to the south-west, narrowing through
the gorge called the Gut for about two miles, and leading into an interior
basin that terminates, in a narrow stream, which winds under the base of Mount
Cockburn.</p>
<blockquote>[* Three hills named Faith, Hope, and Charity, north-west of Cape
Dussejour, attain a height Of 400 to 530 feet.]</blockquote>
<blockquote>[* The arm westward of Adolphus Island is the channel to the
settlement of Wyndham. The aim eastward of Adolphus Island is the northern
mouth of Ord River,--"Admiralty Sailing Directions."]</blockquote>
<p>From this anchorage King pulled round to a sandy bay, where the sailors
found turtle marks and the remains of a turtle's nest, recently plundered by
the natives, impressions of whose feet lay upon the sand. Nine of the blacks
were observed in the brush when the visitor's took their departure. The ship
weighed and made sail round a bluff point (on the west side of the island),
where King again anchored. At night the whole island was illuminated by native
fires, and from the "Mermaid" presented a grand and imposing spectacle.</p>
<p>Cambridge Gulf was the next inlet in which Cunningham landed and where he
was able to extend his collections. "Continuing to the westward," he writes,
"among dangerous and extensive banks and shoals, we again came to under the
north side of an elevated island named on the French charts Ile Lacrosse, which
we discovered was situate in the entrance of a gulf about 60 miles deep, to the
southward, and in which we occupied several days. This gulf was named Cambridge
Gulf, in honour of the seventh son of His Britannic Majesty; and its rocky,
hilly shores, barren and and as they are, added some remarkable plants to my
collection, particularly of the <i>Mimosae</i>, of which a small <i>Acacia</i>
having sets of small delicate verticillate leaves, in habit like some
<i>Tetratheca</i>, is most novel.</p>
<p>"On leaving Cambridge Gulf on the 29th September[*] we made the outer
islands of a large group lying off the main, and named by the French Iles
d'Institut, which comprise several small islets, with some small but elevated
flat-topped islands, of which each has received a name from those navigators,
but of the identity of many it appears a perfect problem to determine. The deep
sinuosities of the main shoreline occupied us within the Institut Isles till
the middle of last month (October), by which period we had explored two bights
named Vansittart Bay and Port Warrender, both of which afford ample shelter and
good soundings for the anchorage of shipping; the great droughts of the main
islands (it being then the extreme of the dry season) not enabling us to
recruit our stock of water by a solitary discovery of even the smallest
portion. Its existence on these shores at this period, the presence of natives,
of whom we saw eleven-including children-together, and the recent traces of
small rock kangaroo, clearly demonstrated.</p>
<blockquote>[* On this day at sunset, King saw Cape St. Lambert and Mount
Casuarina of Baudin, and at noon on September 30th Cape Rulhi&egrave;res and
Lesueur Island, whence the land trends in a westerly direction towards Cape
Londonderry.]</blockquote>
<h4>ADMIRALTY GULF</h4>
<p>King gives a more detailed account of how those on board the "Mermaid"
occupied their time throughout the month of October, when the two bights
mentioned by Cunningham were surveyed and added to his chart.</p>
<p>"We had now reached a part of the coast," writes King, "which, excepting a
few islands that front it, the French did not see." On October 1st he sighted a
bay (behind a group of islands), the eastern head of which was named Cape
Talbot, and next morning at nine o'clock the ship was anchored to the north of
the group, which was called after Sir Graham Moore, then a member of the
Admiralty Board, an island to the north-west of the group being christened
Jones Island. At sunset the ship again dropped her anchor at the entrance of a
bight or bay nearly blocked with reefs; at first King thought that he would be
unable to penetrate it without rounding other islands, which on account of an
eclipse of the moon that took place on that evening, were named Eclipse
Islands. He continued to the southward, however, and first landed on the
south-east end of an island called Long Island, where he took bearings and
obtained a tolerable view up the bay. Mr. Cunningham obtained some new plants
and saw signs of natives having been there. The "Mermaid" then passed through a
deep channel, and on the 4th came to an anchorage near the west side of the
bay, which King now named Vansittart Bay. There again natives seemed to have
recently congregated in large numbers, as at one place in one of its inner
sandy bays no less than forty small native fire-places were arranged in one
straight line along the beach. Near these fire-places were some stones on which
the blacks had been bruising seeds, principally the fruit of a new species of
<i>Sterculia</i>, the husks of which were strewn around. Two native huts were
here observed. There were also traces plainly showing that Malay proas had
visited the place. On October 5th the "Mermaid" proceeded to the south-east
corner of the bay, where King landed in the evening on a projecting point and
ascended to its summit, which he christened Vine Head.</p>
<p>While the people were pulling the boat inshore towards the west side of the
bay, the commander was amused to see a native running along the rocky beach
towards the point for which they were steering. On the other side of it there
seemed to be a cove or inlet. This man was alone and unarmed, and as he ran he
sprang nimbly from rock to rock. On one eminence he stopped for a moment to
look round at the boat, but took no notice of invitations that the sailors by
signs were making to him to approach it. Eventually he disappeared into the
mangroves on the south shore, at the bottom of the inlet, where a fire was
burning, and where he evidently gave the alarm to a family of natives
consisting of three men, two women, and four children who were cooking their
repast. As soon as the boat drew inshore the women took up their baskets and
movables and hurried away with the children, while the men seized spears as if
to guard their retreat. Not to frighten them, King pulled over to the opposite
shore and with Cunningham ascended a hill that rose steeply from the beach.</p>
<p>The view from the eminence was disappointing, though King was able to
discover that Bougainville Island was not an island, as the French had
surmised, but a peninsula. While the explorers were descending the hill,
natives armed with spears and short pieces of wood like throwing-sticks, and
one of them carrying a shield, came towards the foot of the hill, but did not
intercept the visitors. After the strangers had re-embarked, however, the
blacks rushed to the water's edge shouting loudly and threw stones at the
departing boat. They also were seen to be preparing to use their spears, so the
commander gave orders for a musket to be fired over their heads. The noise of
the explosion struck them with panic and they fled. Owing to this incident the
name of Encounter Cove was given to the inlet, the bay itself, as already
mentioned, being named Vansittart, after the Chancellor of the Exchequer, who
became Lord Bexley.</p>
<p>At daylight on the 8th the "Mermaid" weighed and stood to the north-west,
between Troughton Island and Cape Bougainville. Two flat islands seen in the
south-west afterwards proved to be Baudin's Institut Islands. The ship was
steering down the western side of the cape when she was stopped by a
considerable reef (Long Reef), and dropped anchor in the offing in twenty-two
fathoms. Next day she made her way towards the bottom of the gulf, passing
through an archipelago of islands, whose positions her commander then fixed. At
noon he sighted the hill he had climbed in Encounter Cove. By four o'clock the
"Mermaid" entered an extensive port at the bottom of the gulf and anchored in a
bay (afterwards called Port Warrender) on its western shore. On the following
day (October 10th) a party landed on Crystal Head, at the western end of the
bay, where King made some observations, and in the evening, on ascending the
summit of the headland, took bearings of the land around Cape Bougainville by
which the survey was connected with Vansittart Bay.</p>
<p>Accompanied by Roe and Cunningham, on the 11th, King went in the whale-boat
to examine the port, which was found to terminate in two inlets. In rowing back
to the ship no signs of life were seen save a kangaroo skipping over the hills
and an alligator lying asleep on the beach, which woke up and rushed into the
water. Next day Roe explored both arms of the inlet and the name of Port
Warrender was then bestowed upon it, while the space between Cape Bougainville
and Cape Voltaire was called Admiralty Gulf. After naming Point Pickering and
Walmsley Bay, King left this port on the 13th, and his next anchorage was to
the eastward of Point Bigge. On the 15th, after an ineffectual attempt to pass
out through the islands in the vicinity of Cape Voltaire, he anchored midway
between three of "high, flat-topped form" which he does not appear to have
named. The wind now veered to west-north-west and obliged him to pass to the
eastward of Cassini Island, it had been previously seen by him, and found a
useful point by which to compare his charts with those of Baudin.</p>
<p>Cunningham again takes up the thread of the narrative. He writes to Mr.
Aiton: "The fear of being caught on the coast at the change of the monsoon
obliged Mr. King to take his departure on the evening of the 16th ultimo from
Ile Cassini, steering a N.W. course for Timor. Our survey therefore terminated
in about 13&deg; 24' S. lat. and 123&deg; 32' E. long., having proved the large
Bougainville Islands of the French charts to be a promontory (named Cape
Bougainville) of the mainland, dividing Port Warrender from Vansittart Bay.
Upon a rough calculation my specimens gathered on this coast...will exceed 400
kinds; my seeds amount to upwards of 200 packets, excellently ripened, which,
adding thereto fifty-five bulbs, constitute the total of my collections...since
my departure from Port Jackson."</p>
<p>In summing up the principal results of this expedition, Cunningham remarks:
"Lieutenant King filled up the blanks in Captain Cook's chart of the east coast
between Endeavour River and Cape York, and it was highly gratifying to my
feelings to reflect that it was left to me to complete several specimens of
plants originally discovered in imperfect condition by those eminent
naturalists who accompanied the Great Navigator in 1770, desiderata that had
been wanting ever since."</p>
<p>The "Mermaid" returned to Sydney on the morning of January 12, 1820, after
having examined 540 miles of coast-line, in addition to the 500 miles that she
had previously explored.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII</h2>
<h3>THE THIRD VOYAGE OF THE "MERMAID" TO THE N.W. COAST</h3>
<p>The "Mermaid " left Port Jackson to start her third voyage of exploration on
July 12, 1820, Cunningham being on board as well as a naval surgeon named
Hunter. Shaping her course nearly on the track that she had taken in 1819, the
ship steered along the east coast as before.</p>
<p>It was Lieutenant King's intention to touch at as few ports as possible and
to proceed with all speed to the north-west coast, where he meant to avail
himself "of the remaining portion of the favourable monsoon then already far
advanced"; but the old adage, "L'homme propose mais Dieu dispose," proved its
truth, for we read in another letter written by Cunningham[*] that "on the 20th
July, while standing into Port Bowen (one of Flinders' discoveries on the east
coast), the 'Mermaid' having approached an extensive shoal partly dry, took the
ground and remained practically fast, after bumping a good deal on the sandy
bottom as the sea receded. By dint of hard labour she was at length warped off
into deeper water, when it was found that she had received considerable
injury."</p>
<blockquote>[* To Aiton, dated Parramatta, February 1, 1821.]</blockquote>
<p>"On the following day," writes the botanist, "I landed and began my
collection of plants of this voyage...of which several are already described
and published by Mr. Brown, their original discoverer." In telling of the
landing at Port Bowen Cunningham mentions that "here we passed a line of beach
abounding with the common purple <i>Dolichos</i>." It was a little to the north
of this spot that these beans were eaten by Bligh and his starving men, in
1789, with rather serious effects.</p>
<p>The letter continues: "With extremely fine weather we...reached Endeavour
River again on the 27th, where I occupied my time during a period of eight
days. I gathered the seeds of many of the indigenous plants of this part of the
coast...with a few additions, among which were specimens (with ripe fruit) of
the Ground Rattan, so frequently met with during...1819 in shaded woods between
Fitzroy Island and Endeavour River...It proves to be a species of
<i>Calamus</i>. I likewise procured a further supply of the bulbs of <i>Crinum
angustifolium</i>."</p>
<p>At Endeavour River, King saw the remains of his last encampment. A
carpenter's bench was in exactly the same state as it had been left twelve
months before, and the "Mermaid's" name carved upon a tree was also legible.
Mr. Bedwell visited Turtle Reef in quest of turtle, but found none, while
Cunningham in seeking fresh plants walked to the summit of Mount Cook, and made
a sketch of the bay on the south side of the mountain, and of the rivulet
falling into it. This was a bay[*] that Cook had first fixed upon as a suitable
place to repair his ship; but, having found it inconvenient for his purpose, he
afterwards "discovered" Endeavour River. Kangaroo were still in numbers round
the shores of the harbour, and the surgeon shot some birds, among them a Blue
Mountain parrot like those of Port Jackson, and a bird that resembled a crane.
On August 5th the "Mermaid" left the Endeavour's old anchorage for Lizard
Island, which was now more thoroughly explored than it had been since the days
of Cook. "On the 6th of August," resumes Cunningham, "I landed on Cook's Lizard
Island (where a whaler's ton butt and several cocoanuts--one quite sound and
perfect--were found upon the beach), as well as at Cape Flinders, which we
again visited."</p>
<blockquote>[* According to King. It is the Walker Bay of modern
charts.]</blockquote>
<p>"During his stay at Cape Flinders," King tells us, "Mr. Cunningham ascended
a remarkably rugged-looking hill at the south point of the bay on the east side
of the island, which had received several appropriate names from our people
such as Mount Dreary and Mount Horrid. Mr. Cunningham calls it Rugged Mount,
and says it is thinly covered with a small variety of plants similar to those
of Cape Cleveland. This mount is a pile of rugged rocks, towering above the sea
which washes its base, the stones of the summit being conical, while the masses
on the slopes are deeply excavated, and furnish spacious retreats for the
natives. Mr. Cunningham entered one of the caverns (the walls of which were of
a decomposing sandstone) having a window formed in it, where a portion of the
side rock had fallen. The cave was a large natural chamber, capacious enough to
hold a large tribe of natives, who, from the numerous fire-places, broken
turtle shells, and other relics, had not long since dwelt there. He also found
numerous fragments of quartzose rock lying about, and pieces of a kind of
marble of a brown colour were abundant in the cavities, as well as upon the
face of the Mount.[*]</p>
<blockquote>[* King's "Intertropical Australia," Vol. I, P. 378. The mount
referred to as situated on the east side of Stanley Island, possibly was that
known as Castle Rock. On this coast the boulders occasionally assume the form
of buildings. Hume Nisbet, the well-known writer, accurately describes some
seen by him near Cape Melville: "I noticed what I took to be an extensive and
superb mansion close by the shore, the dividing lines and sharp shadows making
perfect resemblances to windows, pillars, and doors...the colour was like that
of sandstone...in design it had a Tudor cast, built with many turrets and
gables."]</blockquote>
<p>As the "Mermaid" passed round Cape Flinders on the 8th the remains of the
"Frederick's" wreck were again seen lying upon the rocks. Cunningham landed at
Cape Flinders--for the second time--on August 9th.[*] He also landed at Pelican
Island, Haggerston's Island, and Cairncross Island. At the last-named he went
ashore with King to the western sandy point, which is covered with a thick
brush, having at its extremity a dark shaded damp wood, where he saw growing
"<i>Guettarda sp.</i>, a very luxuriant tree, having a hollow stem 6 feet in
diameter, whose base is much like the spurred butt of a tropical fig. <i>Maba
laurina</i> bearing green fruit. <i>Mimusops kauki</i> in fruit. <i>Cordyline
cannaefolia</i>, and a strong plant of arborescent growth," in addition to
several unknown twining and climbing plants, ascending to the summits of the
highest trees, forming with <i>Flagellaria indica</i> an impassable barrier in
his path. He left this wood in order to return to the departing boat, when he
found a liliaceous plant having an elliptical nerved leaf, as in <i>Pancratium
amboinense</i>...He dug up all the roots he could find, and says, "Little doubt
can exist of its being Mr. Brown's <i>Calostemma album</i>."</p>
<blockquote>[* The "Mermaid" anchored as before to the westward of Cape
Flinders, which formed the west head of Wreck Bay.]</blockquote>
<p>On August 15th the "Mermaid" doubled Cape York and steered to the southward
of Prince of Wales's Island through Endeavour Strait. Before entering the
strait she passed the night under No. 2 Possession Island, and next day reached
Booby Island, where she anchored.</p>
<h4>THE POST OFFICE</h4>
<p>In the afternoon King landed on Booby Island. We learn from him how the
island first earned the name of the Post Office: "On the summit of the island
or rather rock several piles of stones were observed that had been heaped up by
the crews of various ships passing by as memorials of their visit. Among other
notices of a similar nature we found a board indicating the safe passage
through the strait of the ship 'Sea-flower,' which our log-book informed us had
left Port Jackson on the 21st of May last, and from the memorandum on the board
we found that she took the outer passage and entered Torres Strait at Murray
Island and arrived at Booby Island after a passage of 22 days."</p>
<p>King adds with satisfaction: "A good opportunity was here offered of
comparing our voyage with that of the 'Sea-flower' and of proving the
superiority of the inshore route. The 'Mermaid' left Port Jackson on 12th July,
passed Booby Island on August 16th, which is an interval Of 35 days-- deducting
15 for delays thus:--at Port Bowen 2 days, at Endeavour River 9 days, at Lizard
Island, Cape Flinders, Haggerston Island and Possession Island one day each,
leaves 20 days for our passage, this being two days shorter than that of the
'Sea-flower.'"</p>
<p>Notwithstanding King's figures to show the superiority of the inshore route,
the question whether the outer or inner route (i.e. within the Barrier Reefs)
is preferable for sailing ships remains to this day unsettled. The outer route
stretches off to the east of the Great Barrier Reefs--ships steering between
them and Chesterfield Reef islets, as far as Mellish Reef, then through the
Coral Sea entering Torres Strait by Raine Island, the Great North East Channel
(by way of Bligh Entrance) or other openings in the Great Barrier northward of
Cape Melville. The inner route, now tolerably well lighted--beacons being
placed on all the most dangerous reefs--is always used by steam vessels passing
through Prince of Wales's Channel on their way to and from Sydney and other
ports on the coast. Large sailing vessels, however, seldom use it.[*]</p>
<blockquote>[* "Admiralty Sailing Directions."]</blockquote>
<p>The piles of stones seen by King at Booby Island to record ships' visits
were soon dispensed with, and a small shed was erected, beneath which was kept
a chest containing a book of printed forms, pens and ink, while provisions were
placed in a cave near by for starving sailors. Letters also began after a time
to be left by passing ships, which other ships took away and captains filled up
the forms in the book with the addition of any remarks they considered of
interest when announcing their safe arrival. Then the name of Post Office
appeared upon the maps as the actual designation of the island.[*] The shed was
probably built in 1835 by order of Captain Hobson of H.M.S. "Rattlesnake," who
placed the chest and the book there and who also erected a flagstaff bearing S.
65&deg; E.</p>
<blockquote>[* It is the western limit of the dangerous part of Torres
Strait.]</blockquote>
<p>The officers on board H.M.S. "Beagle" saw the log-book in 1839. In 1841,
when Captain Stokes called again, he found it had been destroyed "by some
mischievous visitors" and the chest much dilapidated. He had the latter
repaired and left a new book, with a supply of pens and ink. During the
'fifties the second log-book disappeared. When Captain Leeman, of the barque
"Ambrosine," called at Booby Island in September, 1858, he wrote in his
journal: "The Post Office consists of a canvas bag hung on a cask standing on
end and screened from the weather by an old tarpauling which at one time had
had the letters 'Post Office' painted on it: could see nothing of the book said
to be there for entering ships' names, but found several memoranda of shipping
which had passed. On the summit of the island a flagstaff had been erected and
a tattered Union jack was flying in the breeze. At a little cove which forms
the landing place there was a ship's boat, painted black, hauled up but with a
large hole in her bottom and the oars had been taken away. The only natives
seen throughout this passage were on Wednesday Island where they appeared on
the beach and waved us to come on shore. Many turtle's eggs were found nearly
hatched, the young turtle being fully formed and alive, and in every hole and
corner we found birds' eggs: there must have been thousands which would of
themselves afford means of subsistence to a shipwrecked crew."[*]</p>
<blockquote>[* Imray's "Indian Ocean and China Sea."]</blockquote>
<p>King calls Booby Island a mere rock,[*] the retreat of boobies and turtle,
and says: "The number of birds here was incredible; they hovered around the
'Mermaid' as if to drive her from their haunts." Birds from a distance seem to
have come there to breed, and Raine Island formed another breeding ground. In
1843, when the Admiralty gave directions for a beacon to be placed there to
mark the principal channel through the Barrier Reef for ships making the outer
passage, "the whole surface of the island was found covered with birds young
and old: there were frigate birds, gannets (a new species), boobies, noddies
and black and white terns: the only land birds being landrails...As night
closed in it was curious to see the long lines and flocks of birds streaming
from all quarters of the horizon towards the island...when the noise was
incessant."[**]</p>
<blockquote>[* "A valley intersects the N.W. side, in which were seen a few
creepers, some brushwood, and two or three trees with a peculiar broad green
leaf."]</blockquote>
<blockquote>[** Jukes.]</blockquote>
<p>To return to the "Mermaid." Continuing her voyage, she crossed the Gulf of
Carpentaria and, on August 21st, made her old anchorage in South-West Bay,
South Goulburn Island, where she "remained five days, completing her wood and
water under a continued alarm of the natives, who again had to be dispersed by
force of arms."[*] "I gathered bulbs," says Cunningham, "in a swampy wood on
this island, which may be different from any heretofore seen by me, on account
of the particular situation in which they were alone to be found. I likewise
landed on Sims's Island and at Sanson's Head added to my
collection...augmenting at the same time my seed list with packets of very
desirable species. On the 3rd September we made the land of the North-west
coast about Cape Voltaire and Cassini Island[**] (of Baudin), at which
place...Mr. King terminated his survey in October, 1819, whence the examination
was resumed to the southward and westward with redoubled vigour. The shores and
island of a bight in the coast-line, which has been named Montagu Sound, were
productive of some curious plants, particularly of the genus <i>Acacia</i>, and
other islets within those of Buonaparte Archipelago likewise furnished me with
some fine plants and...excellent seeds. On our advancement to the southward and
westward we at length, on the 11th September, entered a very deep bight,
tending to the S.E., whose examination occupied us the succeeding seven days,
and here we discovered an entirely new feature in this hitherto inhospitable
coast."</p>
<blockquote>[* Cunningham to Aiton.]</blockquote>
<blockquote>[* Seen by Baudin on August 14, 1801,]</blockquote>
<h4>PRINCE FREDERICK HARBOUR. YORK SOUND</h4>
<p>In working his ship round the north coast to the point where the survey of
his previous voyage had terminated, King tells us that he directed his course
towards Baudin's Banc des Holothuries, near Cape Bougainville. He passed
between its south-east extremity and Troughton Island on September 3rd, after
which a good breeze on the following day enabled him to double Cape Voltaire,
and at sunset on the 5th to drop anchor a few miles to the south of the cape.
To the westward were some twenty-three islands supposed to be the Montalivet
Isles of Baudin. A green tinge upon the nearest islet saved them from being
condemned as absolutely sterile.</p>
<p>Next morning a boat visited the north-easternmost islet, named in the chart
Water Island. The boat's crew found "fresh water enough to fill our bareca,"
says King, "a discovery so unusual that the island was complimented with a name
that will serve to record the fact, rather than to imply that water can be
procured here with any certainty." An extensive view was obtained from this
island's summit, and the sound wherein the surrounding islands were scattered
was, at Hunter's request, named after Robert Montagu, Esq., Admiral of the
'White.'"</p>
<p>The "Mermaid" next anchored at the bottom of Swift Bay, in the entrance of a
strait separating Kater's Island from the main. In the evening King landed at
the south-east end of the island, which was covered with spinifex, as were most
of those inspected, making walking painful and difficult. On the 7th Bedwell
examined a small inlet at the bottom of Swift Bay, which proved to be merely a
salt-water creek bounded by rocks and mangroves. Traces of a small species of
kangaroo were found in every part; its principal food being the seeds and
leaves of an acacia. Cunningharn also observed a gigantic nest six feet in
diameter, formed mainly of sticks, which was doubtless that of the bird known
as the Queensland scrub turkey.</p>
<p>On the 8th, after Roe had sounded the strait separating Kater's Island from
the main, the "Mermaid" passed through it; and in rounding Wollaston Island
King named Mudge Bay, an indentation in the coast to the southward. In the
evening the ship anchored off an island, which, on account of the peculiar
shape of a rock lying close to the beach, was called Capstan Island. King
climbed to its summit, and says, that the view therefrom repaid him for his
trouble in mounting it. Montague Sound proved to be bounded on the west by an
island of considerable size, which was named Bigge Island, after Mr. John
Thomas Bigge, the Royal Commissioner who visited Sydney in 1819. It was
separated from the mainland by a strait named after the Rev. Thomas
Hobbes-Scott, who recently had been appointed Archdeacon of New South
Wales.</p>
<p>Steering through Scott Strait the tide prevented further progress, so the
"Mermaid" dropped her anchor (on September 9th) off Cape Pond, and the evening
was spent ashore on a rocky island that fronts the cape. Like Capstan Island
this was merely a heap of sandstone rocks clothed with spinifex and small
shrubs. A native path was seen winding through the grass, and on the beach
footprints were observed. To the southward of the cape the coast-line was seen
to trend very deeply into the land, and next morning King, after rounding Cape
Pond, entered the opening, but did not penetrate beyond some islands called
Anderdon Islands. On September 11th he again set sail.</p>
<p>He found now that he was nearing the bottom of an extensive harbour, bounded
by bold and irregular ranges of rocky hills, particularly on its eastern side,
where there were several peaks, two of which were named Manning Peak and Mount
Anderdon. Under these hills there was the mouth of a large opening, and to the
eastward of where he anchored another larger but less interesting in
appearance. Hunter accompanied the cornmander to explore the opening under
Manning Peak, while Roe and Cunningham embarked in second boat to examine the
river that fell into the sea at the far end of the bay. This river was named
Roe River, after the rector of Newbury, Mr. Roe's father, while the opening
explored by King and Hunter received the name of Hunter River. The harbour
itself was called Prince Frederick Harbour, and the sound that fronts it was
designated York Sound, in honour of his Royal Highness the Duke of York.</p>
<p>Allan Cunningham closely studied the botany of this part of the north-west
coast and made many excursions. He writes of Prince Frederick Harbour: "The
shores are bounded with lofty ridges...distant wooded ranges peeping over those
nearer us where deeply grooved gullies on their steep declivities and obvious
breaks among the hills and hummocks as of a channel of a river all operated as
inducements to entertain hopes that sufficient water might be found to relieve
us from inconvenience on the and shores of this coast." Cunningham also gives
the following account of the discoveries made within Prince Frederick Harbour.
These King could claim were all his own, for he did not have to share the
honour of making them with any early Dutch or French navigator, as sometimes
was the case with regard to his surveys of the north-west coast.</p>
<h4>ROE RIVER</h4>
<p>"I accompanied Mr. Roe, the most intelligent of Lieutenant King's young
gentlemen, who was directed to explore the extremes of this deep bight
south-easterly, and to examine a presumed opening to the interior in that
direction. We were absent on our voyage two entire days, in which space of time
the survey of the channel of a river abounding with alligators was examined to
27 miles from the anchorage, throughout which this body of water is either
bounded by steep rocky hills or perpendicular cliffs fully 300 feet above its
surface."</p>
<p>Roe and Cunningham encamped on the banks of the river, and the latter
ascended to the summit of a leading range, where he obtained a view inland to
the south-east in the supposed direction of the river's course. The country he
saw was one continued series of high, irregular land, almost mountainous in
character. "The river," he says, "is of perfectly salt water as far as we could
possibly discover, and although there did not appear to be any tributary fresh
streams communicating with it, its channel evidently receives vast bodies of
fresh water in the rainy season from the very hilly country on either side." It
was thought that the river must be full of alligators, for on her way back to
the "Mermaid" the boat passed eleven floating asleep on the water.</p>
<h4>HUNTER RIVER</h4>
<p>Meanwhile Lieutenant King and Mr. Hunter had succeeded in tracing the inlet
under Manning Peak to the north-west, where they discovered "at the end of a
salt-water channel" fresh water oozing through the mud among the mangroves
about twelve miles from the anchorage, but Cunningham tells us that it was not
till the following day, when Mr. Hunter and he, with the watering-party had
traced the salt water to the rocky bed of a river,[*] that "a fine fresh-water
rivulet was discovered silently meandering among large stones to the salt
water, which expanded into large limpid, cool, fresh pools of considerable
extent; the marks of floods were at least ten feet above its present level, so
that in the season of rains the large stones with which its bed is thickly
studded are covered, the whole forming, at those periods, a rapid expanse of
rumbling water, at least 100 yards wide. This valuable discovery afforded us
the means of filling up our water, and enabled Lieutenant King to form plans of
future operations on his being able to quit this coast at the breaking up of
the monsoon."</p>
<blockquote>[* Writing of this river, King says: "It was called Hunter River
after my companion, Mr. Hunter." It was discovered on September
12th.]</blockquote>
<p>"Among the plants, this new feature of the North-west coast afforded a
species of <i>Callitris</i> crowning the cliffs with its pyramidal picturesque
form, <i>Myristica insipida</i> of Mr. Brown and <i>Cryptocarya
triplinervis</i> were the most remarkable, with <i>Abroma fastuosa</i> of New
South Wales and the Moluccas, bearing flowers on its naked aculeated
branches."</p>
<h4>PORT NELSON</h4>
<p>On September 20th the "Mermaid" passed Hardy, the extreme of the peninsula
or projection of land that forms the western side of Prince Frederick Harbour,
and entered another inlet bounded on the west again by a group of islands.
Since it was the anniversary of the late King's coronation, these islands were
named Coronation Islands, and the harbour called Port Nelson, a high rocky hill
overlooking land to the southward being christened Mount Trafalgar.</p>
<p>"I Having at length examined the deep bay (which has been named York
Sound)," continues Cunningham, "we stood out to the S.W., and on the 20th
September the injury our little vessel had sustained when aground in Port
Bowen, not only became apparent, but was a matter of alarm, for the slight leak
had suddenly increased so much as to render an early survey indispensable,
previous to the period which would oblige us to leave the coasts. Fortunately a
safe and convenient place for laying the vessel on shore was discovered, on the
following day, in a sandy bay where our Commander proposed or careen her." This
spot, the western bight to Port Nelson, was named Careening Bay.</p>
<p>Tents were pitched without loss of time at the back of the beach, and the
vessel, lightened of three-fourths of her cargo of provisions and water, was
warped at flood tide well upon the shore, where she was left dry by the ebb.
The repairs covered a period of nearly three weeks (until the 8th of October),
during which time Cunningham sought for fresh plants on the hills some miles
from the encampment. A number of bush fires then raging in every direction
prevented to a great extent the collecting of botanical specimens.</p>
<p>On one of these excursions Mr. Hunter, who accompanied Cunningham,
discovered the waters of "a deep bay bounded by steep hills." Hitherto this bay
had been unknown, now both Hunter and Cunningham were able to trace the
situation of the entrance to it from the sea. Later, when King had left
Careening Bay he took his ship through the entrance, and it formed one of his
most important discoveries.</p>
<p>In Cunningham's journal[*] appears the following further account of his stay
at Careening Bay "Towards the close of the afternoon I landed with Lieutenant
King and found that the hills beyond the beach had been recently fired by
natives, whose old temporary huts were standing on the sands: I traced two
gullies that came down to the beach, and was gratified with the diversity of
small trees and shrubs that shadowed the rocky edges of these water
channels..."</p>

<h4>THE "MERMAID" BEACHED AT CAREENING BAY</h4>
</center>
<p>And on September 24th he writes: "We were fortunate in our discovery of
pools of fresh water at the base of one of the gullies, whose grooved
appearance fully declared the torrents that pass through it in the rainy
season. As far as we advanced up this gully we found small...holes of clear
water...that appeared to be draining from one pool to another, passing through
luxuriantly green patches of grass...pleasing to the eye and affording food to
the kangaroo, whose traces were observed on the rocks.</p>
<p>"In these situations I gathered specimens of <i>Convolvulus sp.</i> and
<i>Senecio sp.</i> and two species of <i>Capparis</i> in the brushes, as those
seen at Vansittart Bay. An arborescent species of this genus <i>Capparis</i>,
which was first observed on the shores of Cambridge Gulf is frequent here,
growing to an enormous size and laden with large fruit. I measured the stem of
one...tree and found it near 28 feet in circumference and scarcely 25 feet
high. I observed a fine pinnate-leaved <i>Acacia</i> (<i>A. suberosa</i>),
found in an imperfect state last year at Encounter Cove, Vansittart Bay. It
bore pods, which yielded some good seeds. A tree of the <i>Urticaceae</i>,
related to <i>Antidesma</i>, afforded me flowering specimens. <i>Sersalisia
obovata</i> of Endeavour River was remarked among the rocks, bearing neither
flower nor fruit; <i>Acacia stigmatophylla</i> forms brushes clothing the
declivities; an <i>Asparagus</i>, probably <i>A. fasciculatus</i>, rambled over
the tops of the clumps of under shrubs, forming a barrier, with a species of
<i>Capparis</i> and <i>Persoonia velutina</i>...Early this morning, September
25, I took my departure on an excursion with Mr. Hunter, our surgeon, to strike
the river-like water which had been discovered by that gentleman yesterday.[*]
On passing the ridges above our tents we shaped our course towards the inland
water seen from the hills, whence an extensive view of the country to the
southward and eastward presented us with a succession of hummocky land as far
as eyes could search."</p>
<blockquote>[* Subsequently called Rothsay Water.]</blockquote>
<p>Cunningham now came to a tract ravaged by a bush fire inland. He says, "The
face of the country assumed an unusually sterile appearance, which was
heightened by its starved vegetation...recently destroyed by a fire still seen
raging on the slopes in the distance. We passed several blackened ridges...till
we reached the summit of a flat-topped hill, whose bluff face to the southward
overhung the waters of our new river,[*] which has a very flattering
appearance, trending away to the S.S.E., bounded by elevated land."</p>
<blockquote>[* Afterwards named Prince Regent River, the hill was called Mount
Knight.]</blockquote>
<p>"From the eminence on which we stood important bearings were taken, that
would prove useful to the surveyors of the water before us, which appeared to
have its embouchure on the coast at a supposed bay to the S.W. of the one in
which we are now detained; and we observed a tolerable clear channel trending
in that direction, although some ramifications were remarked to terminate in
shoaly flats clothed with mangroves, and in one part a low island occupies a
portion of its breadth. Upon looking to the W.S.W. over the hills bordering the
coast a considerable archipelago (formed of small sandbanks or islets) invests
these shores, and very elevated land was distinguished in that
direction...barely perceptible on the horizon.</p>
<p>"Large columns of black smoke arose from vivid flames upon the distant
hills, proofs of the continued devastation going on, although perhaps not of
the actual presence of natives. We saw no quadrupeds, only the usual tracks of
the kangaroo; of birds a few were remarked on the wing, chiefly of the pigeon
family. At noon, having satisfied ourselves of the existence of an inland
water, and its tendency southward, and finding nothing interesting in a country
over whose surface the flames were raging in every direction, we prepared to
return to our encampment, distant about 6 miles N. by W. by a less difficult
route, which enabled us to reach our destination in three hours' hard walking,
without adding a single specimen to my collection, except an imperfect one of
the family of <i>Caryophylleae</i>...</p>
<p>"On the 27th, I visited a part of the hills that had not been fired. I
gathered there specimens of <i>Chionanthus axillaris</i>, <i>Hibiscus sp.</i>
and <i>Acacia stigmatophylla</i>. <i>Grevillea mimosoides</i> very generally
bore its viscid green fruit, and some specimens that were 16 ft. high still had
old flowering spikes. In returning to the rocky entrance shore of our little
bay I remarked the picturesque <i>Pandanus pedunculatus</i> heavily laden with
ripe fruit. This genus is not confined to intertropical climates. I have heard
of its existence a few miles north of the Coal River, near Port Stephens,
whence some fruit had been brought to Port Jackson...and I have seen the plant
at Port Macquarie in lat. 31&deg;, and about 28&deg; to the eastward of this
part of the coast. The plant therefore has a wide diffusion thro' all parallels
and meridians between these given points. It is most probably, however,
confined (as I suspect the locality of <i>Araucaria excelsa</i> is) to the sea
coast.[*]...</p>
<blockquote>[* <i>Araucaria Cunninghamii.</i> Heward says: "Mr. Cunningham at
this time was not aware of the specific difference between the Norfolk Island
Pine and the one seen on the eastern shores of New Holland."]</blockquote>
<p>"On my return I secured a curious lizard[*] of extraordinary appearance
(<i>Chlamydosaurus Kingii</i>) which had perched itself on the stem of a
decayed tree; four kinds of snakes have been observed on the shores of the bay,
and...we are remarking new insects and reptiles creeping out of their
dormitories daily."</p>
<blockquote>[* "It was sent home by Cunningham to the College of Surgeons,
where it has been preserved."--King. It was apparently the well-known "frilled"
lizard, a picture of which appears in " King's Voyage."]</blockquote>
Having completed the vessel's repairs, or at least rendered her somewhat more
seaworthy, though the leak still gave cause for anxiety, the name of His
Majesty's cutter "Mermaid" was deeply carved upon the stem of the largest tree
(<i>Capparis</i>) on the shores of this bay, with certain initials and the date
of her visit and, on October 9th, Lieutenant King left his anchorage, passing
out between Cape Brewster[*] and the Coronation Islands. From Cape Brewster the
land was found to extend for six miles southwestward to Cape Wellington[*] on
the other side of which King believed that there would be found a channel
communicating with the water visible from the hills above Careening Bay, that
Cunningham and Hunter had seen. The "Mermaid" entered a spacious sound, which
King called Brunswick Bay,[*] and after spending the night off Cape Brewster,
was next day carried by the sea breeze round Cape Wellington into a
considerable opening trending to the southward and resembling the mouth of a
river.
<blockquote>[* Cape Brewster is a rocky cape five miles westward of Careening
Bay, and Bat Islet a mass of sandstone connected with the Cape.]</blockquote>
<blockquote>[* Forming the east side of the approach to Prince Regent
River.]</blockquote>
<blockquote>[* Brunswick Bay communicates with Hanover Bay, Prince Regent
River, and Port George the Fourth--"Admiralty Sailing
Directions."]</blockquote>
<p>Standing on at first with and afterwards against the tide, the ship reached,
at seven miles from the entrance, Rothsay Water, the opening that Hunter had
discovered on the west side, while another opposite to it was called Munster
Water, in front of which were rocky islands covered with trees and grass.
Continuing her course up the main stream the "Mermaid" soon passed a point
where the river turned to the south-east. After running for five miles she
entered an extensive sheet of water named Saint George's Basin, in which were
two large islands called by King Saint Andrew and Saint Patrick. The vessel was
hauled round a point called Strong Tide Point into a strait between St. Andrew
and the main, and there she came to an anchorage. From this point Lieutenant
King carried out the further examination of the river by boats. He called the
river itself Prince Regent River, as he considered it quite the most remarkable
feature of the north-west coast.[*] Cunningham describes this exploration in
the following passages:</p>
<blockquote>[* It trends in a south-easterly direction into the interior for a
distance of fifty-four miles.--"Admiralty Sailing Directions."]</blockquote>
<p>"We entered the supposed opening[*] to the inland water (discovered by our
surgeon Mr. Hunter), which we found of nearly the same character as York Sound,
with very steep flat-topped hills, reminding us of the scenery of Cambridge
Gulf of the "Mermaid's" second voyage. On the summit of the boundary cliffs we
remarked the picturesque pine <i>Callitris</i> with the tall fan-palm
<i>Livistona</i>."</p>
<blockquote>[* Brunswick Bay.]</blockquote>
<h4>PRINCE REGENT RIVER</h4>
<p>"A river was discovered at the head of this deep bay which Mr. King traced
28 miles to the S.S.E., and in which a beautiful cascade was seen tumbling in
small detached bodies at least 40 feet. I landed beneath some cliffs near the
anchorage, which I ascended, but made no considerable discoveries. The plants
were chiefly those frequently seen elsewhere, with some south-west coast
specimens, particularly a <i>Gompholobium</i>.</p>
<p>"A remarkable <i>Apocynum</i> of Mr. Brown was sparingly seen on the verge
of the cliffs; and the deep shaded ravines descending from them abound in the
<i>Myristica</i> and <i>Cryptocarya</i> of York Sound. As the period of the
breaking up of the monsoon--so favourable for our stay--was clearly indicated
by the regularly clouded mornings and evenings, our early departure from these
shores became a matter of serious consideration. On the completion of the
survey of this deep port[*] we stood out, it having been determined by our
commander to leave the coast, which we did on 14th October." His point of
departure was the Keraudren Island (of Baudin).[**]</p>
<blockquote>[* Brunswick Bay, at which port our survey closed in lat. 15&deg;
S. and long. 124&deg; 30' E.--King.]</blockquote>
<blockquote>[* The last of the mainland seen was named Point
Adieu.]</blockquote>
<p>Having run down to Cape Leeuwin--purposing to run up the west coast and then
return to these shores--the "Mermaid" had not been long at sea before the leak
alarmingly increased and rendered it necessary for King to make his way back to
Port Jackson, which he says he reached on December 9, 1820, with all on board
in good health. The ship herself narrowly escaped shipwreck upon Cape Banks
when nearing the harbour in a storm, flashes of lightning alone enabling her
commander to navigate her out of her dangerous position in the very nick of
time.</p>
<p>On landing in Sydney, Cunningham learned the news of the death in England of
his patron, Sir Joseph Banks, and in his next letter to Mr. Aiton he expresses
the deep sorrow he had experienced "at hearing of the loss of such an excellent
and invaluable friend."</p>
<p>The chief result of this survey, we are told, was "ascertaining the safety
of the in-shore route along the Eastern coast of Australia: the Barrier Reef
having left between its inner side and the shore a space of clear water varying
in width and perfectly smooth."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV</h2>
<h3>KING'S VOYAGE IN THE "BATHURST"</h3>
<p>The "Mermaid" having proved herself unseaworthy King had to abandon his
intention of employing her upon his fourth voyage, and the New South Wales
Government then purchased a larger and more convenient ship for his use. This
was an Indian teakbuilt brig of 165 tons register called the "Haldane," which
was renamed the "Bathurst," her complement numbering thirty-three. A surgeon
named Montgomery, who succeeded Hunter, joined her at Sydney, as well as
Percival Baskerville, one of the midshipmen of H.M.S. "Dromedary," then lying
in the harbour. Allan Cunningham again went as botanist to the expedition, and
a Port Jackson native named Bundell took the place of Boongaree.</p>
<p>On May 26, 1821, Lieutenant King set forth to continue his exploration of
the unknown north-west coast in company with the merchant ship "Dick." On July
5th King anchored once more in South-West Bay, South Goulburn Island.</p>
<p>He wrote home to the Admiralty authorities from this anchorage and gave
precise information concerning the "Bathurst's" voyage. "Since leaving Port
Jackson," his letter runs, "I felt pleasure in proving the strength of the
vessel, for we have made scarcely 12 inches of water although we experienced
much bad weather between it and Breaksea Spit. To the south-east of Cape
Capricorn I discovered four small isles in addition to the one laid down by
Captain Flinders and have every reason to believe that all that space is
occupied by low wooded isles and extensive reefs. At Percy Island (No. 2)[*] I
remained two days (between the Pine Islets and the basin) to shift a topmast
that was found to be damaged, and at the anchorage at Cape Grafton[**] I
stopped two days to await the termination of thick weather, after which,
without much improvement in the weather, we continued our course and anchored
on June 21st behind Cape Flinders, stopping one night, June 20th, at Lizard
Island on our way. In passing round Cape Flinders there appeared to be a
considerable diminution of the 'Frederick's' wreck, no vestige being left of
her stern or forecastle which before were so very conspicuous. At Lizard Island
we had a friendly communication with the natives, but at Cape Flinders we
narrowly escaped being speared, being suddenly surrounded by natives who threw
several spears at us and wounded one of the 'Dick's' people. Here I remained
three days, during which I obtained several useful spars for spare yards and
masts from the wreck of the 'Frederick,' which we had visited on former
voyages. We also got many iron bolts and teak planks."</p>
<blockquote>[* In the "Mermaid's" second voyage she had anchored at Percy
Island, No. 1. No. 2 is the largest of the Percy Islands. Here King met a ship
which had left Port Jackson after him. This was the "San Antonio" (Hemmans,
master), who declined King's offer of guidance through Torres Strait, and said
that he meant to run day and night through the reefs; shortly afterwards he set
sail. The "Bathurst" met the ship again at the largest Frankland Island, and
the master stated that he had been aground at the Palm islands (on a reef now
known as San Antonio Reef). He was now glad to follow King, and never left him
until the "Bathurst" had passed through Torres Strait.]</blockquote>
<blockquote>[** King steered through the strait that separates Cape Grafton
from Fitzroy Island, and anchored about half a mile from its northern
extremity. "It is a little remarkable," he writes, "that the day on which we
anchored should be the anniversary of its discovery; for Cook anchored here on
the eve of Trinity Sunday, fifty-one years before, and named the bay between
Capes Grafton and Tribulation in reverence of the following day."]</blockquote>
<h4>CLACK'S ISLAND</h4>
<p>While King was salving spars from the "Frederick" in Wreck Bay (a part of
Bathurst Bay) one of the "San Antonio's" boats conveyed Mr. Montgomery and
Allan Cunningham to Clack's Island, three miles north from Cape Flinders. On
the southern part, where the island is most exposed, the botanist discovered
some caves. He noticed that the weather "had excavated several tiers of
galleries there upon which were some curious native drawings. They were
executed upon a ground of red ochre rubbed on the black schistus rock with dots
of white argillaceous earth and represented figures of sharks, porpoises,
turtle, lizards (of which there were several seen among the rocks), trepang,
starfish, canoes, water-gourds and quadrupeds probably intended for kangaroos
and dogs. The figures besides being outlined in dots were decorated all over
with the same white pigment. Tracing a gallery round it brought me to a cave
which was large enough to afford shelter for twenty natives whose fire-places
appeared on the floor. Turtle-heads had been placed in niches in the rock and
the roof and sides of the cave were covered with the same uncouth figures."[*]
Cunningham ends these remarks with the following comment "Captain Flinders had
discovered figures on Chasm Island in the Gulf of Carpentaria formed with a
burnt stick; but this performance, displaying 150 figures which must have
occupied much time, appears at least to be one step nearer refinement than
those simply executed with a piece of charred wood."</p>
<blockquote>[* See Hooker's "Journal of Botany," and King's
"Voyages."]</blockquote>
<p>On taking leave of the east coast, King says "We sailed from Cape Flinders
with line weather, but the same evening thick, rainy weather set in which
lasted without intermission until we cleared Torres Strait and accompanied us
even to the westward of Wessel's Islands. The state of the weather rendered the
navigation among the reefs very intricate and dangerous, but I had the
satisfaction to find that the chart I had previously constructed was tolerably
correct."</p>
<p>After telling how he had lost his anchors, the last one carrying away with
it about a hundred fathoms of chain cable, King continues: "The 'Dick' also
broke her anchor at the same time from having dropped it on rocky ground.
Between 12 o'clock and daylight I had to continue under weigh and, being
surrounded by reefs on one side and land on the other, it was not without
danger. We managed however to keep her off the reefs and the following morning
cleared the strait without further accident. I have only one bower anchor now
with which to carry on the survey, but having been twice before in the same
predicament without sustaining damage I feel more confident of being able to
continue my proceedings up to the beginning of September. I had intended to go
to King George's Sound previous to commencing the examination of the west
coast; but, as I shall not be able to effect this without a better supply of
anchors, I have...some idea of going to the Isle of France (Mauritius)
which...is more convenient than Batavia. In anchoring a week ago[*] on the east
coast (at Cairncross Island) Mr. Roe who was aloft had the misfortune to fall
from the mast-head nearly 50 feet, but providentially escaped with a severe
wound over the right eye...His loss till he recovers will be much felt as the
whole of the survey will fall upon me...He however is in a fair way of
recovery. I have constructed a chart of that part of the coast between
Cambridge Gulf and Clarence Strait which...I will forward, as also my journals
for the last two voyages."</p>
<blockquote>[* On June 30th.]</blockquote>
<p>In his next letter home Lieutenant King gives the following account of his
proceedings after he had taken his departure from Goulburn Island: "On parting
company with the ship 'Dick,' Captain Harrison, bound for Calcutta, in sight of
Cape Van Diemen on the 9th July, the San Antonio having sailed to the N.W. on
the 8th, I steered towards Cape Londonderry, and on 12th July passed Troughton
Island off Cape Bougainville, and after dark passed round the north-end of the
extensive reefs situated on the west side of the Cape. At daylight next morning
Cassini Island was seen, but having much calm weather we were drifted by the
current in various directions and narrowly escaped being thrown on the
extensive banks to the northward of that island.</p>
<p>"Between the 18th and the 21st we were becalmed near a group of isles which
were seen last year both from Cape Pond and from Careening Bay, and appear to
be noticed on the French charts. They are situated off the north-west end of
Bigge Island.[*] On the 22nd July the brig was near Keraudren Island but I did
not reach the anchorage in Careening Bay until the following evening. As soon
as the vessel was secured I visited our former encampment in order to ascertain
if I could procure water, but...everything was dried up and not the least sign
of what we wanted was found. The next and only resource left to us was the
Cascade in Prince Regent's River...but it was not until the evening of the 25th
that I anchored in St. George's Basin immediately off the entrance of the
river." On the following morning King ascended the river and found plenty of
water at the Cascade, and, the boats being despatched, they obtained sufficient
to last the ship until the middle of October.</p>
<blockquote>[* Maret Group.]</blockquote>
<p>Cunningham thought the Cascade "a singular feature of this unique coast
which had been only partially examined before. It was found to tumble--a sheet
of water--one hundred feet over the rock in a most picturesque manner," and was
evidently fed from "an inexhaustless source situated...in some higher ridges to
the S.W." The watering operations proved a strain on the sailors, who had to
work the boats a distance of twenty miles to the watering place, but the delay
enabled the officers to complete the survey and to make a tour up the river
beyond the Cascade. In this expedition Cunningham, through illness, was unable
to accompany the party. King also made extensive minor observations, "to
compare with those taken last year at the observatory in Careening Bay" by
which the longitude of that place was determined as 125&deg; 0' 46"</p>
<h4>HANOVER BAY</h4>
<p>The "Bathurst" left Prince Regent River on August 6th for a bay to the
westward that in 1820 had been named Hanover Bay, where King remained for
several days. A point divided the bight of the bay into two openings, of which
the easternmost communicated with Munster Water and Prince Regent River. A few
casks of water were obtained from a fresh stream here. During their stay a
serious affray with the natives occurred which might have had fatal
consequences for at least one of King's party. The commander had landed with
the surgeon and two of his officers when the natives, who had laid down their
arms and were apparently inclined to be friendly, came towards them. Presents
were given, but in a short time it was noticed that they seemed mistrustful,
and, retreating step by step, suddenly picked up their spears.</p>
<p>Having left his muskets in the boat King gave orders to some of his men to
return for them, and they were in the act of descending the rocks that ran to
the water's edge when two natives each threw a spear at them. One fell short of
the midshipman at whom it was aimed, but the other pierced Mr. Montgomery, the
surgeon, in the back. The latter fired off a pistol and the blacks instantly
fled. Cunningham remarks that had the spear been more slender and been
discharged with a throwing-stick the wound would certainly have been fatal, but
fortunately, although it was painful, Mr. Montgomery recovered.</p>
<p>The next morning at eleven o'clock a native was seen on a float or catamaran
paddling round the west point of the strait, and another man, with whom were a
woman and a child, was observed upon the rocks. "In less than a quarter of an
hour the men came down to the spot where we saw them yesterday and began to
wave and call to us. An opportunity, says Cunningham, "now offered to punish
these wretches for their treachery and of disappointing their present plans,
for they were evidently intent upon mischief." Mr. Bedwell was therefore
despatched to secure their catamaran, which was hauled up on a sandy beach near
the outer point, whilst another boat was sent towards the natives.</p>
<p>"When the boat arrived near the shore they were sitting on the rock and
inviting us to land, but it was necessary to convince them that we were not so
defenceless as they imagined and as soon as we were sufficiently near several
muskets were fired over their heads. One of the men fell down behind a
rock--the others made off. The native who had fallen was wounded in the
shoulder and was recognised to be the very man who had speared Mr. Montgomery.
He made several attempts to get away but every time his head appeared above the
rock which concealed him a pistol or musket was fired to prevent his escape. At
last he sprang up, and, leaping upon the rock, vanished out of sight.</p>
<p>"As soon as he was gone we pulled round to the sandy bay where the natives
had landed and overtook Mr. Bedwell...Upon the beach we found two catamarans,
in each of which was a large bundle of spears tied with ligatures of bark; and,
on searching in the grass, we soon secured all their riches, consisting of
water baskets, tomahawks, throwing-sticks, fire-sticks, fishing-lines, and 36
spears, one being headed with a piece of stone curiously pointed and worked.
This last was propelled by a throwing-stick which we found lying with it."</p>
<p>From Hanover Bay, on August 11th, the "Bathurst" may be said to have begun
her new survey on this voyage. Westward from Hanover Bay she entered yet
another very fine harbour, which was called by King, in honour of His Majesty,
King George IV's Sound. Its western side was found to be formed by an extensive
island,[*] to the westward again of which lay a continuation of rocky islands.
"They are all rocky and barren[**] and are surrounded by reefs which render
them dangerous to approach. The strength of the tide was found to be very great
and its rise considerable."</p>
<blockquote>[* Augustus Island, thirteen miles in length.]</blockquote>
<blockquote>[** King, MS. letter to Admiralty. These islands being Champagny
Isles, Heywood Isles, and Byam Martin Island.]</blockquote>
<h4>PORT GEORGE THE FOURTH</h4>
<p>Port George the Fourth is a most excellent harbour, and, like Hanover Bay,
King found it very convenient, but the numerous reefs and islands which skirt
the outer coasts of both ports appeared to him likely to lessen their value as
safe havens for ships. An island lying in the centre of the entrance to Port
George the Fourth divides the waterway into two channels. The passage on the
western side between Point Adieu[*] and Entrance Island has several patches of
rocks in it, but that on the eastern side is nearly clear of danger. Two miles
to the southward of Entrance Island is an islet which from its peculiar shape
King named the Lump--it is now called the Hummock--and abreast of this the
"Bathurst" anchored at about a mile and a half from the shore. On landing and
ascending the "Lump" the commander obtained some desired bearings. While he was
thus employed lie despatched Mr. Baskerville to examine an opening at the
bottom of the port, which proved to be a strait and was called Rogers Strait in
honour of Captain Rogers, R.N. Baskerville reported that its waters were dotted
with islands and dry reefs of considerable extent.</p>
<blockquote>[* At the northern extremity of Augustus Island.]</blockquote>
<p>On August 13th King cleared the harbour, passing out of it by the eastern
channel, but having to beat against the wind was soon compelled to anchor again
off Point Adieu. King had first seen and named this point during his third
voyage in the "Mermaid."</p>
<p>At daylight on the 14th the "Bathurst" left Point Adieu and came abreast of
a strait leading between some rocky islands to the southward[*] (this appears
to have been the strait eastward of the Champagny Isles), through which she was
driven by a floodtide with tremendous impetus on the 15th, anchoring at six
miles from the southern outlet of the strait. Here King remained all the
evening. A little before sunset he obtained a good view to the south-east,
where he again saw a great number of islands: beyond these the mainland could
not be traced. A point of the land afterwards christened Point Hall bore from
the anchorage S. 19&deg; E. (the vessel being then in Camden Sound).</p>
<blockquote>[* To the north of these extend other islands one of which named
Vulcan Island is the land seen in 1801 by Captain Heywood, and called by him
Vulcan Point after his ship H.M.S. "Vulcan."]</blockquote>
<p>The direction of the tides at this place led King to suspect that an opening
to the eastward of the bay in which he had anchored, and which he named in
compliment to the Marquis Camden, not only connected it with Rogers Strait but
was also the outlet of another considerable bay or river. This opening was
Brecknock Harbour and its eastern continuation Camden Harbour, the former being
remarkable for the manner in which its coast-line is everywhere indented with
bights. Rogers Strait at its north-eastern extremity was found to lead back
into Port George the Fourth.</p>
<p>On the 16th the "Bathurst" weighed and made sail round Point Hall, steering
towards a group of islands which the commander named Montgomery Isles after the
surgeon of the "Bathurst." Another bight in the coast-line to the southward
where the land again trended in deeply, was called Collier's Bay, in compliment
to the late Captain Sir G. Collier, R.N., and here a few good-sized trees were
noticed growing over a sandy beach on one of the islands at its entrance.</p>
<p>On August 17th the "Bathurst" came to an anchorage off a bay, the east head
of which was formed by several islands. (This probably was in Yampi Sound).
Proceeding forward, though making little progress, towards Buccaneer
Archipelago, the brig at sunset on the 18th hauled to the wind for the night
off the northernmost of a range of islands which King identified as the
Caffarelli Island of Baudin. He was now in the vicinity of Brue/ Reef of the
French commander. Shortly after daybreak on Sunday, August 9th, he passed the
"dry rock"[*] off the west end of Caffarelli Island, and endeavoured to steer
between the range of islands to which it belonged and a group of rocky isles
close to it, but without success. He then approached some other islands to the
south-westward which formed the eastern side of a channel or strait.</p>
<blockquote>[* An islet 120 feet high.]</blockquote>
<p>Here the vessel was soon placed in a perilous situation. The tide which had
been with her turned, and setting with great force first drove her towards some
rocks and then caused her to drift into the channel. In entering this there was
only just enough wind to enable her to clear the rocks, and she had no sooner
avoided them than she was nearly thrown upon some islets. In this unexplored
strait with rocks and islands all around her, with the afternoon far advanced,
and with an unfavourable wind, the "Bathurst" for some time was at the mercy of
the tide, and all that could be done was patiently to await its ebbing, in
order that she might drift out as she had been carried in. Now and again she
was caught in eddies and whirlpools that caused her to spin round so rapidly as
to endanger her masts. At 5 p.m., however, the tides and eddies ceased, and
gradually she began to drift through the channel and to meet again the dangers
that she had experienced when coming in.</p>
<p>To add to the difficulties of navigation in such circumstances the breeze
continued unfavourable. In spite of this King tried to make sail and beat out,
and before long had made progress, the land being lost sight of. At night,
however, a dead calm set in, the tide began to flow and the ship to drift so
near to the land, that the breakers could plainly be heard. Shortly afterwards
the moon rose, and then it was seen that this land consisted of islands which
fortunately were still some distance off. A few minutes after midnight a
favourable breeze from the south-west at last brought her out of danger. King
named the strait Sunday Strait, and in 1838 Captain Stokes called the passage
from which the "Bathurst" made her escape from her perilous position, Escape
Passage. At daylight on the 20th the ship was eight miles to the north-east of
Caffarelli Island, Bru&eacute; Reef being clearly seen as she passed between
them. At noon the low land of Cape L&eacute;v&ecirc;que bore to the
southward.</p>
<h4>CYGNET BAY</h4>
<p>In one of his letters King says that between Camden Bay and Cape
L&eacute;v&ecirc;que the coast-line was "very indifferently noticed " by him on
account of the danger, and for this reason he was compelled to bear away. At
the bottom of Collier's Bay there appeared to be an opening[*] which he thought
was not very considerable, but, he writes, at the bottom of Cygnet Bay, I think
it not unlikely that there is a very extensive opening.[**] We were becalmed
and carried into its entrance and sunset overtook us before we were extricated
from danger, but the ebb tide fortunately drifted us out clear of the numerous
reefs and shoals which are so thickly strewn over this interesting
partinteresting not only from the rapidity and great rise and fall of the tides
as well as from the considerable depth of the water, being in some parts from
40 to 50 fathoms, but on account of its being the bay visited and described by
our celebrated navigator Dampier during his voyage with the buccaneers in
the'Cygnet'."</p>
<blockquote>[* Secure Bay, the easternmost of two bays at the head of Collier
Bay, is a considerable sheet of water.--"Admiralty Sailing
Directions."]</blockquote>
<blockquote>[* The heads of many of the bays named by King are even to-day
little known, and we read in "Admiralty Sailing Directions" that large portions
of the coast are still unsurveyed. Wickham and Stokes (1838-42) and Denham
(1858), who surveyed these coasts after King, added largely to the knowledge of
them.]</blockquote>
<p>In the story of his voyage King proceeds to quote Dampier's remarks about
this part of the coast when the "Cygnet" came here in 1688, and he adds: "From
this description I have little hesitation in settling Cape L&eacute;v&ecirc;que
to be the point he passed round.[*] In commemoration, therefore, of his visit
the name of Buccaneers Archipelago was given to the cluster of isles that
fronts Cygnet Bay, the latter so called after the ship in which Dampier sailed,
the point within Cape L&eacute;v&ecirc;que being named Point Swan after her
captain[**] while to a remarkable lump in the centre of the Archipelago the
name of Dampier's Monument[***] was assigned."</p>
<blockquote>[* King's "Intertropical Australia," Vol. 1, Part 11, p.
88.]</blockquote>
<blockquote>[** Captain Swan, however, did not visit New Holland.]</blockquote>
<blockquote>[*** The most conspicuous island of the archipelago; it is conical
with a rounded Summit 283 feet high, on which is a solitary bush.--"Admiralty
Sailing Direction."]</blockquote>
<p>King's letter to the First Lord of the Admiralty at this point becomes an
historic document, and shows how anxious he was to investigate Dampier's
landing-place. His lack of anchors, however, prevented him surveying it as he
would have wished to have done, and he writes: "I reluctantly found myself
obliged to leave the particular examination of this part until a more
favourable opportunity[*]...and after fixing the position of all the islands, I
rounded Cape L&eacute;v&ecirc;que and continued the examination of the coast.
From that point it took a decidedly new character and continued low and sandy
as far as the part where I quitted it."</p>
<blockquote>[* He returned in the following February.]</blockquote>
<p>King left the scene of Dampier's first landing on August 20th. He saw no
natives on any of the islands where Dampier had seen them, but noticed their
fires at the back of Cygnet Bay. Continuing his voyage round the coast, next
day at sunset he anchored at about four miles from the shore. During the
afternoon an immense number of whales had surrounded the "Bathurst's " track,
leaping and thrashing the water. The noise, says King, was as loud as that of a
volley of musketry. At noon on August 22nd Cape Borda was sighted, and on the
same afternoon the sloop came abreast of Emeriau "Island" of Baudin; and as
this proved to be a part of the mainland the word "point" was substituted for
"island" on the charts. At five o'clock Lac&eacute;p&eacute;de Islands, a group
of four low islands[*] composed of sand and coral and covered with coarse
grass, was sighted, and at sunset King anchored for the night within them.
While steering along the Australian coast on the 23rd he named a sandy
projection Cape Baskerville after his midshipman. From it the land trended
inward to form a bay, which the commander says he christened Carnot Bay, since
no island could be traced in the position assigned to Baudin's Carnot
Island.</p>
<blockquote>[*West Islet, Middle Island, and Sandy and East
Islets.]</blockquote>
<p>The "Bathurst" passed Cape Berthollet, Point Coulomb, and Cape Boileau of
the French charts and came to an anchorage on August 24th, some six miles from
a sandy point of the mainland, which was identified as the Gantheaume "Island"
of Baudin, the name of Point Gantheaume therefore being bestowed upon it. On
this day, after a thick haze had enveloped the shore, a mirage was observed
from the ship, which produced an extraordinary effect upon the coast, causing
high chalky cliffs crowned by wooded hillocks to appear, whereas in reality the
land south of Point Gantheaume is of a low and sandy character, and beyond this
point trends to the south-east. King named the bight between Cape Villaret and
Point Gantheaume, Roebuck Bay, "after the ship that Captain Dampier had
commanded when he visited this part of the coast in 1699."</p>
<p>The "Bathurst" found an anchorage at sunset on August 25th about six miles
to the north of Cape Villaret, and weighing next morning at daylight sighted,
as soon as the breeze had dispersed the mist enveloping it, the hillocky summit
of Cape Latouche-Treville. From here the vessel turned and left the coast.</p>
<p>Cunningham had gathered a few seeds at King George IV's Sound, but found its
botany did not differ from that of the shores examined by him to the eastward,
and he makes the following remarks with regard to this part of his voyage:
"Upon leaving the sound on the 13th we saw little of the main, for,
having...stood outside the many...barren islands...so surrounded by reefs that
they could not be approached, we were...barred from closing in with the
coast-line till about the 20th, when...we stood in and made a low depressed
sandy shore. This miserable line of coast," writes the botanist, who was ill at
the time, "trended rapidly to the southward, and assumes all the extremes of
sterility so obvious during former voyages--a feature that continued to the
close of our stay...when we reached the lat. of 18&deg;S., having recognized
some points seen by the French, to whose names every possible respect has been
paid."</p>
<p>In addition to the opportunities for landing in Dampier Land being few and
far between, Cunningham suffered from indisposition for some time, which fully
accounts for the fact that he did little botanizing; indeed, he had gathered
few fresh specimens since leaving Prince Regent's River, although King and his
officers made collections of plants for his benefit, when they went on shore.
He does not seem, however, to have obtained any plants after leaving Cape
L&eacute;v&ecirc;que, for King states: "No opportunity offered, nor was there
any inducement for me to land between Capes L&eacute;v&ecirc;que and
Latouche-Treville, but the appearance of the country was sufficiently
indicative of its sterility. It is so low as not to be visible from a ship's
deck at a greater distance than 4 or 5 leagues." The "Bathurst's" water was now
nearly expended, her provisions in a very bad state, besides which her lack of
anchors, having but one left, caused King so much anxiety that he decided to
leave the shores at once. On taking his departure on August 27th he directed
his ship's course to the Mauritius.</p>
<h4>THE MAURITIUS</h4>
<p>On the evening of September 26th the "Bathurst" reached Mauritius, and
anchored off the town of Port Louis. Captain Fairfax Moresby, of H.M.S.
"Menai," then in the port, rendered her commander much assistance, helping him
to make the necessary repairs to his ship and to purchase the three anchors and
two cables which he so badly needed. While at Port Louis, Cunningham learned
that General Macquarie had been succeeded by Sir Thomas Brisbane as Governor of
New South Wales. Several excursions on the hills in the neighbourhood of the
town kept the young botanist busily employed, although, the season being
unfavourable, few plants were in flower or fruit. He repeatedly visited the
Botanic Gardens at Pamplemousses and saw the many rare exotics from India,
Africa, and Madagascar. Of these he was able to make a good selection for the
Royal Gardens at Kew, and in return presented the Pamplemousses establishment
with some packets of seeds of such Australian plants as he had in quantity, and
of which he had already sent home specimens.[*] Among the plants then sent to
Kew were some green, well-ripened nutmegs, probably of the kind known as the
Banda or round nutmeg (<i>Myristica fragrans</i>), so highly esteemed by the
old Dutch traders.</p>
<blockquote>[* During his stay Cunningham made the acquaintance of Mr. Telfair,
Founder of the Society of Natural History at Mauritius, and received his
hospitality at Bois Cheri.]</blockquote>
<h4>KING GEORGE'S SOUND</h4>
<p>Having completed her supplies the "Bathurst" left Port Louis on November 15,
1821 and anchored in King George's Sound, Western Australia, at one mile from
the entrance of Port Royal, on December 23rd, after a passage of thirty-nine
days. Next morning several natives were seen waving to the ship from the north
head of the harbour.</p>
<p>After breakfast King pulled towards them in a whale-boat. Although they
seemed to invite the British to land, he ordered his men to row out into the
harbour while the blacks walked along the beach. It was evident that they were
unarmed; each wore a kangaroo skin over his shoulder, but left the right arm
exposed. When they saw the white party turning off shore they seemed very
disappointed, and upon perceiving the sailors making signs for fresh water,
called out "Badoo" (a Port Jackson native word for water), and pointed to a
part of the bay where Flinders had marked a rivulet. The word kangaroo was also
familiar to them; and as the "San Antonio" had visited here in 1820, King felt
sure that both words had been obtained from the crew of that ship. Their name
for kangaroo was Beango.</p>
<p>Cunningham gives the following account of his arrival</p>
<p>On the afternoon of the 24th I landed with Captain King on the beach, where
our tents had been pitched four years since, and was much surprised at the
change in the vegetable kingdom on that shore. We could discover no trace of
the garden which I had formerly made with so much labour. The breadth of the
beach had considerably diminished, by a great accumulation of decayed
seaweed...and the stumps of large trees (two feet diameter) cut down in 1818
were wholly concealed from our view by the luxuriant stems that had grown out
of them, exhibiting with every shrub around the most luxuriant growth of
vegetation...On the side of the wooded hills above the beach I remarked almost
every plant to be in a much more backward state than...in January, 1818, the
season on the whole being more favourable for flowering specimens than for
ripened seeds. <i>Banksia grandis</i> and <i>B. coccinea</i> ("the Pride of the
Sound") were extremely fine in flower, as were also several
<i>Leptospermae</i>, and among the plants around I gathered the following:
<i>Calythrix sp.</i> a shrub with white flowers. <i>Lysinema ciliatum</i>.
<i>Comesperma sp.</i> allied to <i>C. confertum</i>, Labill. <i>Hakea
ceratophylla</i> and <i>H. florida</i>. <i>Johnsonia lupulina</i>, a curious
plant of the <i>Asphodeleae</i>. <i>Acacia decipiens</i> and <i>A.
nigricans</i>.</p>
<p>"Nothing could possibly exceed the beauty of <i>Pimelea decussata</i>, on
rocks nearly washed by the sea, where <i>Scaevola nitida</i> was also frequent;
upon the lower slopes I gathered fruit of <i>Banksia attenuata</i>; upon the
gravelly ridges I gathered specimens of <i>Leptomeria aphylla</i> and <i>L.
squarrulosa</i>...Some delicate <i>Stylidae</i> were discovered among
gramineous plants, where also I detected <i>Conostylis setigera</i> in flower,
and some specimens of <i>Haemodorum</i> were shooting forth their lurid brown
stems.</p>
<p>"The summit of the ridge was wholly uninteresting, the plants being chiefly
stunted <i>Eucalypti</i>, <i>Banksia grandis</i>, and the arborescent
<i>Xanthorrhoea</i> of the shores. Agreeing in habit and producing a stem
similar to this last mentioned species, exists a plant (<i>Kingia australis</i>
R.B.) on these hills, whose fructification. has never been detected in a
perfect condition.</p>
<p>"Having traced the narrow ridge of the highest hill above the anchorage in a
northerly direction, I descended upon the eastern shore of Oyster Harbour, and
in passing through a shaded forest land was furnished by reason of the shade
with a pleasing change in vegetation...On the 26th, in a day's walk, I
gathered:--<i>Synaphea dilatata</i>...<i>Lemcopogon verticillatus</i>, a tall
shrub bearing white fruit...<i>Casuarina sp.</i>, a shrub of low stature...A
showy <i>Gompholobium</i>, with numerous ascending stems and linear ternate
leaves, decorate these woods with its unproportionately large flowers...With a
view of avoiding the natives, whom we perceived strolling between their
encampment and the vessel, we kept the leading ridge of the hills, from which
we had a fine view of the distant country west of Oyster Harbour.</p>
<p>"By a circuitous route back we at length arrived at an elevated spongy bog.
In this bog I found later the curious <i>Cephalolus follicularis</i>, a pitcher
plant of very weak growth." Of this he adds, "The plants of <i>Cephalotus</i>
were all in a very weak state...the ascidia or pitchers, which are inserted on
strong foot-stalks, all contained a quantity of discoloured water, and in some
the drowned bodies of ants and other small insects." Whether this fluid was
considered by him to be a secretion of the plant, as with the <i>Nepenthes</i>
or pitcher plant of India, or of the ascidia themselves, or was simply
rain-water, Cunningham does not positively tell us, but appears to have agreed
with Mr. Brown in thinking the fluid was a secretion of the plant. He says: "I
spent much time in fruitless search for flowering specimens," and informs us
that the only edible plants he found here were a creeping parsley, <i>Apium
prostratum</i> (Labill.), and a species of orache, <i>Atriplex halimus</i>,
Brown.</p>
<p>Not being quite so intently engaged, King was able to see more of the
blacks, and found them friendly and amicable. One man in particular showed
great intelligence, and became much attached to the British, who dressed him in
European clothes and christened him "Jack," by which name he was always known.
King writes of Oyster Harbour: "At this place, during watering operations, I
had a daily and very interesting communication with the natives, who conducted
themselves towards me in a most open, confiding, and friendly manner, and I am
happy to say that we left them much pleased with our visit."On Christmas Day,
the blacks speared a young seal, and the whole tribe collected to devour it,
eating the raw flesh in a way which rather disgusted Captain King and Mr.
Cunningham, who, prompted by curiosity, came to watch them consume it. They
possessed neither the fiz-gig, shield, nor boomerang, says King, but their
throwing-sticks or "mearas" were rather ingeniously formed.</p>
<p>The stem of the <i>Casuarina</i> at Oyster Harbour, on which the "Mermaid's"
name and date of her previous visit had been carved was now seen almost
destroyed by fire, the date 1818 alone being visible. The initials of some of
King's people, however, were still quite perfect upon the stem of a large
<i>Banksia grandis</i>, then richly in flower and magnificent in appearance.
Near the stream, from which water was obtained for the ship, felled trees were
lying with the staves of a cask, evidently mementoes of the "San Antonio's"
visit when she wooded and watered there in 1820. On January 4th King went again
to Seal Island to look for the bottle which had been placed there in 1818. It
was found suspended as it had been left by the "Mermaid's" people and on being
brought on board, another memorandum giving particulars of the "Bathurst's"
coming was enclosed, as well as a copy of the vocabulary of the native
language.</p>
<p>On January 6, 1822, the " Bathurst " left King George's Sound and began her
minute examination of the west coast. At daylight on the 10th the dreaded
Leeuwin was sighted from the masthead. King, in his journal, reminds us that
from Cape Leeuwin or the Land of the Lioness, the south-westernmost extremity
of Australia, Flinders had commenced his exploration of the south coast and
that Baudin's ships had twice rounded it. At noon a large, bare patch of sand
on the mainland, the "Tache Blanche remarquable," of Captain Baudin, bore N.
77&deg; E. At six in the evening the "Bathurst" passed Cape Naturaliste.</p>
<p>On the following day, January 11th, Capes P&eacute;ron and Bouvard were seen
from the ship, and distant land was visible to the eastward, trending towards
the entrance of the Swan River, which King did not enter. On the 12th, at 9.30,
the ship was steering five miles from the low and sandy shore between Cape
P&eacute;ron and Cape Bouvard. On this day a remarkable mirage was witnessed; a
haze had concealed the true coast-line, when "land appeared all round us, on
which rocks, sandy beaches, and trees were seen so plainly that the officer of
the watch actually reported two islands on the western horizon." The French had
witnessed just such another magical scene in G&eacute;ographe Bay. At sunset
the haze cleared away, and the true outlines of Rottnest Island were clearly
discerned in the north-east.</p>
<p>"During the night the "Bathurst" made short tacks, and next morning King
brought her to an anchorage at the northeast end of Rottnest Island, off a
point now known as Bathurst Point. In the afternoon he landed in a bay on the
east side of the island, where a tremendous surf came rolling in upon the
beach. Cunningham, who was included in the landing party, took particular
interest in the botany of this island, so small, yet so famous in the history
of Dutch exploration, and he gives the following description of his
visit:[*]</p>
<blockquote>[* Cunningham to Telfair.]</blockquote>
<p>"On the 14th January, 1822, we landed at Rottnest Island...which is situated
about 13 or 14 miles from the main and from the estuary of Black Swan
River...and was discovered by the Dutch navigator Cornelis de Vlamingh[*] when
the main to the northward called Edels Land was also seen and Swan River
examined, of which the sketches of Van Keulen who accompanied that navigator
are still extant. Landing on the island they (the Dutch) observed the soil to
be perforated in every direction as well perpendicularly as horizontally with
long burrows...the operations of rats[**] which appeared to have overrun the
island and have given rise to the name it then received of Rottenest or
Rottnest but which, according to the French, are in reality the retreats of a
nondescript animal forming a distinct genus allied to <i>Didelphis</i>. The
true face of Rottnest is better seen at a moderate distance at sea when it
forms into a series of low hills and hillocks. The soil is intermixed with
shells...the rocks are a grey sandstone coated with coral shells and sand.</p>
<blockquote>[* This should be Willem de Vlamingh.]</blockquote>
<blockquote>[** A species of kangaroo rat described by Vlamingh as having "a
purse or bag hanging from its throat."]</blockquote>
<p>"At the back of the beach upon tracing a declining vale covered with
spinifex (a prickly grass) about 300 yards, I reached the margin of a lake of
salt water having by the marks on its edge a sensible tide[*] on all sides...it
is bounded by hills alike sandy but thickly covered with <i>Callitris</i> or
pine of heavy robust growth...the elevation of these rising grounds being...not
more than 150 feet above the sea. The extent of the lake, which appeared very
shoally and wound round the rising land towards the centre of the island could
not be ascertained but, at the extremity I had visited, it did not exceed 200
feet in breadth and part of that space was occupied by a rocky islet, its
shores, which were 30 feet wide, being formed of shells in beds of bivalves
among which the genus <i>Mya</i> was abundant. No fresh water has ever been
discovered on the island, indeed the loose filtering nature of the soil has
nothing in its component parts tenacious enough to retain that element near the
surface, and it is most probable that the bed of the lake being lower than the
level of the sea the latter finds its way into it through the loose sand at
flood tides.</p>
<blockquote>[* Freycinet had named this lake Duvaldailly's Ponds "from the name
of the cadet who accompanied us."]</blockquote>
<p>"No kangaroos were seen by us although very recent traces of these animals
were observed as also the well defined paths of seals which according to the
French (P&eacute;ron's Voyage, 1811) wander over all parts of the island. But
their skins (at least those killed by our people) were not of the fur kind as
is stated by Captain Freycinet...No parrots were seen and but a solitary pigeon
of a large size seemingly not distinct from <i>Columba chalcoptera</i> of our
colony. Groups of sandpipers ran on the beach and large flocks of boobies (of
our sailors, certainly a <i>Pelecanus</i>) inhabit some rocks in the
offing.</p>
<p>"The sad wrecks of once beautiful shells afforded me subject for
contemplation of the riches 'of the unfathomed caves of Ocean' which although
there were no perfect specimens for the cabinet showed the extent and
importance of the conchological subjects of these shores. I recognized there
<i>Buccinum</i>, <i>Bulla</i>, <i>Murex Trochus</i>, <i>Haliotis</i> and
<i>Helix</i>, all of which might be collected alive and perfect immediately
after a westerly gale on the weather shore. The island is situate in lat.
31&deg;58' S. and long. 115&deg;29' E. and is about 7 miles in length and its
extreme breadth 1&frac12; mile. It does not appear to be inhabited nor were any
indications observed of the aborigines of the neighbouring main having crossed
the strait to it."</p>
<p>Of the Island-flora, Cunningham remarks: "It is surprising that an island at
so short a distance from the S.W. coast should bear so small a feature of the
characteristic vegetation of King George's Sound as not to furnish a single
plant of the several genera of <i>Proteaceae</i> or <i>Acaciae</i>, and but a
solitary plant of <i>Leguminosae-Templetonia retusa</i>. The timber is a
<i>Callitris</i>, having much the habit of <i>Pinus cedrus</i>, or cedar of
Lebanon, which is found abundantly spread over the island, and to within a few
yards of the sea-beach: I saw also a large spreading <i>Melaleuca</i> and a
narrow-leaved <i>Pittosporum</i>; these three trees constitute the timber of
the island. The ground in some parts if profusely clothed with <i>Spinifex
hirsutus</i> Labil."</p>
<h4>HOUTMAN'S ABROLHOS</h4>
<p>Weighing on the 14th from Rottnest, King steered up the coast, and traced
the shores of Western Australia to the northward, at from three to six miles
off shore, as far as North-West Cape, without finding them to vary much from
the Dutch chart of Van Keulen. He sighted, on the 15th, Baudin's Cape
Leschenault, and on the 16th his Jurien Bay, in which were noticed two rocky
islets,[*] and on January 17th passed within the "Abrolhos Banks, a part of
which he had seen during his previous examination of the West coast."</p>
<blockquote>[* Favourite and Long Islands.]</blockquote>
<p>The Abrolhos, or Houtman's Abrolhos, form three groups of small islands and
rocks enclosed by reefs, and extend forty-nine miles along the coast of Western
Australia, Wallabi, the northernmost, being separated from Easter Group by
Middle Channel, and the latter from Pelsart Group by Zeewyk Channel. The Dutch
ship "Batavia," Commodore Pelsart, was lost on the south end of Pelsart Isle in
1629. The passage between the Abrolhos and the coast was called Geelvink
Channel by King, in honour of Vlamingh's ship, since she was the first to pass
within them in 1697. Before Houtman's name was added these rocks already had
been christened Abrolhos by some earlier voyagers, for the name appeared on
charts before the Dutchmen arrived there. It is the Portuguese word for cliffs
or rocks rising from the sea, and is believed to be derived from a nautical
expression meaning "keep your eyes open" or "open your eyes"--"mind your eye"
would be a modern paraphrase--and so to have been given by Portuguese sailors
to dangerous places.</p>
<p>Frederick Houtman arrived in the "Dordrecht," which, with another ship with
Jacob d'Edel on board, on the way to Batavia, sailed from the Cape of Good Hope
on June 8, 1619. Houtman wrote, in his account of this voyage: "On July 19th we
suddenly came upon the South Land Beach in lat. 32&deg;20', where we spent a
few days." It is to this voyage that Dedel's Land and Houtman's Abrolhos owe
their names.</p>
<p>On January 18th, at five o'clock in the morning, from the "Bathurst's" deck,
land about 1,000 feet high was seen forming a range of flat-topped hills. This
range, which had been noticed by the "Naturaliste" in 1802, was named by King
in honour of Captain Moresby, who had rendered him valuable assistance at
Mauritius. The summit in the centre was called Mount Fairfax, the hills at the
north end Menai Hills, and three others at the south end were given the name of
Wizard Hills. From here the coast trends to the N.W. by N. and "a large patch
of bare sand terminates the sandy shores, in lat. 27&deg;55' S. A steep cliff
then extends to the Red Point of Vlamingh, behind which is a bight called by
the French Gantheaume Bay."</p>
<h4>DIRK HARTOG ISLAND</h4>
<p>The "Bathurst" made a very speedy run on the 19th, and on the 20th reached
the parallel Of 25&deg;56' S., when King anchored in Dirk Hartog's Road at the
northern extremity of the island of that name. Of the island's history as then
known to him and of his coming there Cunningham gives an interesting
account:[*] "This island...was discovered by Captain Hartach or Hartog in the
ship 'Eendracht' of Amsterdam (1616) as appeared by a platter of tin which was
seen eighty years afterwards by Vlamingh (1696) who subgraved his name and date
of arrival to it.[*] In 1801 Commodore Baudin discovered the remains of
Hartog's original post to which was attached the tin plate and having carefully
copied the inscription replaced the platter on the original spot, erecting a
new post for it.</p>
<blockquote>[* To Telfair, February 15, 1823.]</blockquote>
<blockquote>[** Vlamingh placed another plate where Hartog's had formerly stood
and carried the original back to Holland. See account below.]</blockquote>
<p>"Upon the approach to this memorable extremity of the island,[*] previous to
our arrival at the anchorage in the Road, we most distinctly perceived the spot
whereon Captain Dirk Hartog had erected a cross in 1616. It was on the verge of
a high cliff which we ascended the following morning, each of us being anxious
to behold the original metallic testimonial of the discovery of the island
which had been there at so late a period as 1801. To our disappointment we
simply found two posts of recent erection of different lengths, standing by
being fixed in between the deep fissures of the rocks but without the plate
attached to either which could not be found in or about the vicinity of the
spot, although a very diligent search was made. One of the staffs was of fir
seemingly part of a top-gallant mast, the other appearing to be of the
<i>Callitris</i> of Rottnest and was probably erected by Captain Freycinet of
'L'Uranie' in 1818. The fir post was probably that to which Baudin had in 1801
again fixed the original platter. Our conclusions were that, although Dirk
Hartog's post which was of oak had remained undisturbed by natives 185 years it
is nevertheless probable that the appearance of the new one had so excited the
wonder and doubts of the barbarous wandering aborigines as to induce them to
deface it...This island...has the greatest surface of red sandy bare desert I
have ever observed in New Holland, over which I traversed nearly three miles,
gathering a few of those curious plants in my route originally discovered and
collected by the celebrated Dampier."</p>
<blockquote>[* This was Cape Inscription.]</blockquote>
<p>King states that the post of the wood of the <i>Callitris</i> was two feet
high. It appeared broken but the other post was erect, and seemed to have once
been either the heel of a ship's royal-mast or part of a studding-sail boom. On
one side of it were marks showing that a flag had been fastened to it. King,
like Cunningham, thought that the natives had removed the plates, but on
returning to England he learnt that they were preserved in Paris, having been
carried away by Louis de Freycinet during his voyage in the "Uranie" in 1818.
Upon beaches to the eastward of the cape were found varieties of sponges and
coral, and b&eacute;che-de-mer in the crevices of the rocks.</p>
<p>On the 24th Mr. Roe visited the cape again, to fix on the post (the old
studding-sail boom) a memorial of the "Bathurst's" visit. An inscription was
carved on a small piece of wood (at the back of which was deposited another
memorandum written on vellum), and placed in the sheave-hole of the post, where
it was made secure.</p>

<h4>THE TIN PLATTER SEEN BY HAMELIN IN 1801</h4>
</center>
<p>In the year 1697 William Vlamingh had left the Swan River and was tracing
the coast-line of Western Australia northward when he reached Hartog Island. He
found, as Cunningham has stated, at its northern point, on February 4th, a tin
platter, which Hartog had left as a record of his stay there, and saw other
traces of his visit. Vlamingh brought the plate away and gave it to the
Gentlemen Seventeen at Batavia, and in the account of his voyage, printed in
Amsterdam in 1704, there appears a copy of the following memorandum, sent by
the Gentlemen Seventeen to the authorities at Amsterdam:</p>
<p>"This old plate brought to us by William Vlamingh we have now handed over to
the commander, in order that he might bring it to your Nobilities, and that you
may marvel how it remained through such a number of years unaffected by air,
rain or sun."[Which seems to speak well for the preservative properties of the
Australian climate.]</p>
<p>Vlamingh wrote on the chart [see Van Keulen] which he afterwards made of the
coast: "Here I found the tin platter," placing a cross on Hartog Island to show
the exact spot where he came upon it.[*] [This platter has been discovered in
quite recent years in the States Museum at Amsterdam.] But before Vlamingh had
left Hartog Island the above memorandum continues: "He erected on the same spot
another pole, with a flat tin plate as a memorial, and wrote on it as you will
read in the journals.[**]</p>
<blockquote>[* Alexander Dalrymple has thus translated the Dutch

<p>On this "flat tin plate" Vlamingh placed together the two inscriptions
recording both Hartog's and his own visits. It was this second plate, on the
post erected by Vlamingh, that was seen by Captain Hamelin in the "Naturaliste"
(one of Baudin's ships) when he called at Hartog Island in August, 1801. The
plate was discovered still nailed to the post but half buried in the sand. The
French commander refixed the plate on a new post, after its inscription had
been copied by the artist on board his ship (inaccurately it is said), and an
illustration of it taken from the picture published in Louis de Freycinet's
work is reproduced. When Hamelin erected the new post in the old position he
put up another, to which was fixed a plate bearing an inscription recording his
own visit; and it was these two memorials that King had hoped to find
there.</p>
<p>Many another seaman since King's day has regretted that the two missing
plates were carried away by Louis de Freycinet. The two inscriptions upon the
more ancient one were, of course, in Dutch, of which the following is a
translation:</p>

<p>During his stay at Hartog Island, where the "Bathurst" remained several
days, Cunningham worked indefatigably, and while he worked his thoughts carried
him back to "Old Dampier," as he calls him. The island resembles a peninsula,
and shelters the shores of Shark Bay, where the "Roebuck" had anchored in 1699.
It was here, as already related, that Dampier had collected those first
specimens of the Australian flora which are still preserved with others from
different parts of the coast in his herbarium at Oxford. The picture of the
shore drawn by Cunningham is hardly so flattering as that which Dampier has
left us, but the "Bathurst's" visit occurred at the height of a dry season,
when the vegetation looked parched and the whole country was languishing for
want of rain. And possibly Cunningham did not see many of the plants and
shrubs, that Dampier saw there flowering in profusion, the description of whose
blossoms forms such an attractive feature in his account of this place.</p>
<p>Cunningham thus describes it: "Perhaps no part of the coast we have visited
can possibly exceed this island, considering its extent, for its barren
appearance, as upon the shores near us downs of sand appeared, rising to a
ridge perhaps 200 feet high, in most parts bare of vegetation, and those parts
which were covered seemed altogether burnt up."</p>
<p>Cunningham first botanized along the summit of the ridge, and in a walk of
two hours obtained the following plants: "<i>Beaufortia Dampieri</i> (A.
Guns.), <i>Artemisia sp.</i> <i>Westringa cinerea</i>. <i>Sida sp.</i>
<i>Euphorbia eremonophila</i>, a shrub frequent in low brushwood. <i>Gomphrena
sp.</i>, a diffuse plant, past flowering, but bearing seed. <i>Hibiscus sp.</i>
<i>Podolepis sp.</i> A shrub of the order <i>Rutaceae</i> seemingly
<i>Diplolaena</i> of Mr. Brown, originally discovered and figured by Dampier;
and a curious procumbent plant of <i>Capparideae</i>."</p>
<p>In Cunningham's collection were the following plants, originally brought to
England by Dampier, viz. "<i>Trichinium incanum</i> Br. <i>Diplolaena
Dampieri</i>, Desf. <i>Solanum</i>, a thorny species. <i>Dampiera incana</i>
Br. A cordate-leaved <i>Melaleuca</i>, figured by Dampier, and a beautiful
<i>Loranthus</i> growing on the branches of <i>Acacia ligulata</i> Cunn. Many
were wrecks of interesting plants which had fallen sacrifice to the
long-protracted drought, but it was impossible amid the languor of vegetation
not to admire the luxuriant and healthy habit of an undescribed species of
<i>Pittosporum oleifolium</i>, Cunn, which formed a small robust tree laden
with ripe fruit."</p>
<p>The "Bathurst" was compelled to remain in Turtle Bay for some days, as the
weather blew a gale all the while she was there. The sailors spent their time
hunting for turtle, and on the 22nd no less than fifty were turned. As only ten
could be taken on board, the other forty were left on shore upon their backs
for the night. All were found dead next day, having killed themselves trying to
escape, but many others were captured afterwards, some of which weighed four
hundredweight. For this reason the harbour was so named. A seal was seen here,
which King thought might have been of a species described as Dugong by
P&eacute;ron. Of fish two kinds only were caught, the Snapper, a species of
<i>Sparus</i>, called by the French "Rouge Bossu," and a <i>Tetradon</i>, which
the sailors would not eat.</p>
<p>Sharks in great numbers surrounded the ship, and King remarks that the sight
of so many "impressed us with the propriety of Dampier's nomenclature."</p>
<p>The only bird seen was a solitary species of <i>Loxia</i>, but a huge nest,
built of sticks and about five feet high, discovered on a steep ledge of rock,
bore witness to the presence of other feathered inhabitants. The rocks below
were covered with a prostrate <i>Capparis</i>. Near this spot a small black
kangaroo was disturbed, busily feeding on the seeds of an acacia, but the
little animal bounded away at Cunningham's approach, without finding a single
bush or rock large enough to conceal itself, "so bare were these and sandy
plains."</p>
<p>On the morning of January 26th the "Bathurst" left Hartog Island to continue
her voyage to the north-east. She passed outside Dorre and Bernier Islands, and
at six o'clock Kok Island bore north-east, distant seven miles. Next day the
ship made Cape Cuvier--formed of light red cliffs 400 feet high--and at one
o'clock saw a sandy projection, which King named Cape Farquhar, another sighted
a little later being designated Point Anderson. On January 29th the land, which
at this time had been concealed by haze, revealed itself, and was called Point
Cloates. King no longer doubted it was that which earlier navigators had
christened Cloates Island, or, as it appears in some ancient East India
documents, "Cloates or Doubtful " Island. At noon on this day Vlamingh Head,
which lies three miles to the south-westward of North-West Cape, was sighted,
with breakers extending along the whole length of the shore.</p>
<p>Having already charted this part of the coast-line, King determined to leave
it and make his way to Rowley Shoals, in order that after fixing their true
position he might examine the bight round Cape L&eacute;v&ecirc;que, which he
had been obliged to leave unexplored during the earlier part of this voyage.
The first of these objects was effected on February 4th, when he passed round
the south end of the Imperieuse Shoal (named after Captain Rowley's ship), and
it was found to extend four miles farther to the southward than he had
suspected when surveying it in 1818.</p>
<p>Continuing his voyage, on the morning of February 8th, the mainland was
sighted in the south-east, and soon afterwards the ship rounded Cape
L&eacute;v&ecirc;que. On her way towards Point Swan the "Bathurst" had to pass
through breakers, and although she remained in them only for the space of about
two minutes, so violent were the shocks of the sea and so great the strain put
upon the vessel that King says he feared for the safety of her masts. He then
steered between Point Swan and Swan Islands, intending to come to an anchorage
off the point.</p>
<h4>KING SOUND</h4>
<p>At this time King also thought of William Dampier, more particularly because
he wished to chart the exact spot where the "Cygnet" had anchored during her
stay in New Holland. In trying to reach it, however, King nearly lost his own
vessel among the islets in the north of King Sound, and the perils that he then
experienced are recounted in the following letter to the Admiralty:</p>
<p>"On the eighth of February I made Cape L&eacute;v&ecirc;que, which is the
westernmost head of the deep opening of Cygnet Bay, and attempted to anchor
under it, but no sooner were we under its lee than it fell calm, and, the brig
being quite unmanageable, we were carried through a crowded cluster of low
rocky islands and shoals by a terrific tide, which was running in some parts at
5 knots; and in the narrowest part of the strait through which we drifted (and
which was not more than 100 yards wide) it was running at the rate Of 7 or 8
knots--the stream of which carried us towards a dry rock, which was in
mid-channel, and from which we were only four yards[*] distant as we passed it
by."</p>
<blockquote>[* In his journal he writes: "the rudder was not more than six
yards from the rock."]</blockquote>
<p>When the ship approached this narrow strait the voices of natives were
heard, and soon afterwards some black men were seen on each side of the strait
waving their arms and shouting. One party came so close to the "Bathurst" in
their eagerness to watch the vessel's progress that they easily might have
thrown their spears on board. "These natives," writes King, "had a dog with
them, which Mr. Cunningham remarked to be black, but our situation was too
awful to give us time to notice the motions of the Indians, for we were then
entering the narrowest part of the strait, and the next moment were close to
the rock--which it appeared almost impossible to avoid--when the consequences
would have been truly dreadful.</p>
<p>"As soon as we had escaped this imminent danger we found ourselves within a
group of islands and drifting to southward over a clear and deep channel. But
the tide of flood was nearly done, and I feared lest we should be carried back
by the ebb through the dangers we had so happily escaped. The bottom was deep,
and of so rocky a nature that the loss of the anchor would have been the
certain consequence of such a step. At the moment, however, of the change of
tide a breeze sprang up, and soon removed us far from the dangerous influence
of this rapid tide; and before sunset we were at anchor on the western side of
a bay on the north-west side of a point of land [named by King, Point
Cunningham], to the eastward of which no land, excepting a group of crowded
islands was visible, and even here the tide was setting at 2&frac12; knots." In
reading King's letter one is forcibly reminded of Cook's experiences in the
"Endeavour" when he was swept through Providential Channel into the inner
waters of the Great Barrier Reef. Happily both navigators escaped the dangers
which lay in their path.</p>
<h4>CYGNET BAY</h4>
<p>On the day following the "Bathurst's" coming to Cygnet Bay, King did not
leave the anchorage. He sent Roe, however, to examine the coast round Point
Cunningham and Baskerville, to make soundings about the bay. From the vessel,
on one of the sandy beaches at the back of the bay near Park Hillock--a spot so
called because of its parklike appearance--eight or ten natives were perceived,
evidently searching for shellfish. Some of them were observed to be children,
the others were believed to be women, excepting two or three who carried
spears, while a dog trotted along behind them.</p>
<p>After dark port-fires were burnt every half hour to enable Roe to find his
way back to the "Bathurst," and before midnight he safely rejoined the ship. He
reported that there was good anchorage round Point Cunningham, and that at the
spot where he landed he had found plenty of fresh water. In the meantime Mr.
Cunningham, who had accompanied him, secured new plants, and met with recent
traces of natives and dogs at a camp, around which were strewn many turtle
bones and broken shells, the native fire-places showing that they had been used
lately. Point Cunningham was described as low, wooded, and sandy.</p>
<p>On the 11th of February King got the ship under way and crossed the sandbank
that fronts the bay, when the wind falling he was compelled to drop anchor
again off Point Cunningham. At the early hour of three o'clock on the morning
of the 12th Roe and Baskerville went on shore to take bearings, but did not
succeed in landing before the sun had risen. Without loss of time the two
officers, with one of the boat's crew, made their way to the summit of the
point, and on reaching it heard the voices of natives among the trees not more
than thirty yards away from them. The black people, however, could not be seen,
nor did they venture from their place of concealment until the officers had
finished their survey and returned to the beach, where the footmarks of men and
boys were traced on the sand. A number of fire-places of recent date were
noticed at this spot, and some pieces of wood, sharply pointed, suggesting that
the natives had been employed in manufacturing their spears.</p>
<p>From the north-west trend of the point the officers obtained a view to the
eastward, which showed that the islands did not extend farther southward than
N. 88&deg; E., and that beyond this lay the open sea.</p>
<p>Some remarkable shells were picked up on the beach, and a few insects
obtained, among them a beautiful sphynx. One of the crew also caught a flying
fox, like those of Port Jackson. Of shells there was not a great variety; they
included a chama (<i>Tridacna gigas</i>, Lamk.), a <i>Pinna</i>, and the
<i>Trochus</i> of Dirk Hartog Island, in addition to a large <i>Voluta</i>,
found close to a native fire-place, which had evidently been used as a vessel
for water.</p>
<p>On the ship making sail again on the 12th the wind was found unfavourable,
and eventually the "Bathurst" anchored in a bay to the south of Point
Cunningham. A remarkable flat-topped hill, a mile and a half from the
anchorage, was named Carlisle Head, and the bay itself was called Goodenough
Bay, in compliment to the Bishop of Carlisle. In the evening four natives,
armed with spears, were seen sitting in the shade upon the beach under Carlisle
Head, watching the ship. At this place the extreme heat affected the whole
ship's company, but not seriously.</p>
<p>Next day, on again sailing, the "Bathurst" experienced calms and light airs,
and was drifted by the tide to the northward of a point which was called Foul
Point, because here the ship fouled her anchor. She was then in the outer part
of a bay, afterwards named Disaster Bay by King, "because of the loss and
perplexity we met with in it," and its southern extremity, off which is a small
rocky island, was called Repulse Point.</p>
<p>On the 14th, since the brig could not proceed further with safety, King
despatched boats to gain further knowledge of his surroundings. In the
afternoon Baskerville and Cunningham set off in the second cutter to Repulse
Point. No sooner had they left the ship than a breeze, freshening to a gale,
parted her cable and King was obliged to weigh with all haste and return to his
former anchorage in Goodenough Bay, which, however, the commander did not reach
until sunset. Meanwhile the safety of the cutter caused him great anxiety.
Port-fires were burned and signal-guns fired, to guide it back to the ship, but
it was ten o'clock before it got on board. Mr. Baskerville had gained useful
knowledge of the coast, although unable to land on Repulse Point, for the gale
springing up had nearly swamped the cutter. Only with difficulty had its
occupants been able to regain the ship, as in addition to the bad weather the
light of the portfires and flashes of signal-guns fired for their guidance had
only proved confusing. In the darkness it had been impossible to distinguish
them from flashes of lightning and the camp-fires of the natives. On the 15th,
after searching without success for the "Bathurst's" lost anchor, and having
now but one left, King was forced to abandon further examination of this
"interesting place."</p>
<p>He informs us, however, that during his stay he had examined the western
shores of the large opening for forty miles in a southerly direction. It is now
called King Sound, in his honour: in so naming it, Captain Stokes wrote: "We
gave it the name of King's Sound in full confidence that all for whom the
remembrance of skill, constancy, and courage have a charm will unite in
thinking that the career of such a man should not be without a lasting
monument." At the termination of King's survey the mainland, on the opposite
side of the bay, was not visible. He stopped his exploration "on account of the
unfavourable weather and from having lost an anchor." When he left it he says
that he could not tell for certain what was the nature of this inlet,[*] but it
was his opinion that "it communicates at the back of Buccaneer Archipelago with
Collier's Bay,[**] and forms a deep gulf (or perhaps a river running to the
S.E., like Prince Regent's River), but the greater body of water joins the sea
by a narrow strait at Cape Villaret, making the land from Cape
L&eacute;v&ecirc;que to Point Gantheaume an island.[***]</p>
<blockquote>[* King Sound is an arm of the sea extending about sixty-five miles
southward from Sunday Strait to Derby at the entrance of Fitzroy River-"
Admiralty Sailing Directions."]</blockquote>
<blockquote>[** It does not connect with Collier Bay.]</blockquote>
<blockquote>[*** Later explorations have proved that there is no Strait here
but that the land between King Sound and Point Gantheaume forms a
peninsula.]</blockquote>
<p>"Examination," he continues, "can alone prove the truth of this supposition,
and although I am not sanguine of its turning out to be more than an inlet
(like Prince Regent's River, excepting of a larger size), yet I regret
exceedingly having been twice repulsed in examining it. I trust a third attempt
(which I promised to undertake before I return to England) may be successful.
The heat of the weather during our last visit to this opening was at times
almost insufferable. The thermometer on board indicated a temperature of from
86&deg; to 90&deg; under the main hatchway, but in the sun it rose to 120&deg;.
On taking his departure from this inlet, which from the intricate clusters of
islands that face it caused him to run many risks whilst steering his ship to
the open sea, King writes: "I intended to send a boat to examine the east coast
of Collier's Bay while we were completing our water, but...was prevented by the
easterly winds and rain from S.E...which induced me to finally leave the
coast."</p>
<p>On February 17th, after leaving King Sound, Captain King passed out through
Sunday Strait. At the entrance of the strait the ship again found herself amid
perils, nearly striking upon a reef of rocks while being carried through by a
rapid ebb-tide without a breath of wind. In the evening heavy clouds announced
the approach of a storm, and soon after eight o'clock a boisterous gale began
to blow. Early next morning Ad&egrave;le Island was seen. From there King
steered an eastward course, but the state of the weather growing more and more
threatening as he proceeded in this direction he decided to return to Port
Jackson immediately by a westwardly route. He left the north-west coast on
February 21st, and holding on a course to the northward of Rowley Shoals, and
from there steering southwestward, he eventually rounded Western Australia,
coasted the shores of South Australia and passing through Bass Strait, arrived
at Sydney after an absence Of 344 days. In writing an account of his latest
discoveries to the First Lord of the Admiralty, King thus ends his letter: "I
experienced a long and tedious voyage. Our bread was entirely expended and we
had three days' water on board when we arrived at Sydney on April 25th. The
only part of the N.W. coast that I have not seen is contained between Cape
Villaret and Depuch Island, and by a reference to the French charts His
Lordship will see that the shore has been sufficiently examined by the French
as to leave no doubt of its being a shoal and low coast. The mainland of the
Archipelago remains yet to be seen, which I trust I shall be able to accomplish
on my way home."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XV</h2>
<h3>CUNNINGHAM REACHES PANDORA'S PASS</h3>
<p>On his return to Sydney--after his long association with Captain King had
ended--Cunningham seems to have been seized with a desire to set out alone to
explore the country inland. At the end of September, 1822, he applied to Sir
Thomas Brisbane for means to make a short excursion and started on what may be
called his first expedition into the interior, for it was carried out entirely
under his own superintendence.</p>
<p>He proceeded "leisurely" westward over the Blue Mountains, driving from
Parramatta in a light cart with two horses and two servants and encamping at
Prince Regent's Glen, Cox's River, and the Fish River. In crossing the
mountains he added many new specimens to his store, and on October 14th reached
Bathurst--that small outpost then beginning to raise its head above the billows
of grass which swept over the plains.</p>
<p>Fatigued by their journey the party rested at the settlement for some weeks,
but Cunningham did not waste his time there. In his rambles over the plains he
collected on the banks of the creeks flowing into the Macquarie River a rich
harvest of plants. He visited the Wombat Ranges, describing them as "a series
of lofty ranges (broken by ravines of considerable depth) whose ridges abound
with wombats."...He came upon piles of stones among the ranges raised by the
natives (as he imagined) "in commemoration of a grand wombat feast," and saw
there some "rock-white quartz." His map also shows that he marked the source of
Clear Creek, a stream which flows into the Winburndale Creek.</p>
<p>In 1818, during Cunningham's absence in the "Mermaid," Oxley had led a
second exploring party to Bathurst, having been ordered by Governor Macquarie
to make yet another expedition to the interior, and with Oxley came Evans, the
discoverer of the plains.</p>
<p>On May 25, 1818, Oxley and his party had left the settlement and proceeded
to trace the Macquarie's winding course to the north-westward. They sailed down
the river in boats beyond the valley named Wellington by Oxley in 1817, and
crossed a stream, the Erskine, which fell into it from the eastward. They
continued to trace the Macquarie until their progress was stopped by marshy
swamps overgrown by tall reeds where the river became shoal; or, in Oxley's
words, "It all at once eluded our further pursuit by spreading in all points
from north-west to north-east over the plain of reeds...the water decreasing in
depth from upwards of twenty feet to less than five...over a bottom of blue
mud, and the current running with nearly the same rapidity as when the river
was confined within its banks. This was in 30&deg;45' S. and 147&deg;10'
E."</p>
<p>On its north bank below this point a hill was discovered to which the name
of Mount Harris was given, another on the south bank being called Mount Foster.
Natives were met with who proved friendly. Near here Oxley inspected a
remarkable native burial-ground, and, anxious to ascertain how they buried
their dead, opened a grave which appeared to differ from those of the coast
natives. The body was found lying wrapped in opossum skin beneath numerous
sheets of bark with the head turned towards the east.</p>
<p>From Mount Harris, where the boats were left behind, the party, turning
their backs on the swamps of the Macquarie, struck out in an easterly direction
for the sea-coast, while Evans went off alone to the north-east across the
streams known as Wallis Ponds and Morrisett Ponds, the latter being named in
honour of Colonel Morrisett, of the 48th Regiment, who became later a
well-known resident of Bathurst. On July 27th, when forty-five miles from the
Macquarie, Oxley reached another river, which he christened the Castlereagh,
and then fell in with a range of hills, calling them Arbuthnot's Range, naming
the northern extremity Mount Exmouth, the centre Mount Harrison and the
southern Vernon's Peak--their native name being Warrambungle.</p>
<p>From Mount Exmouth he turned to the north-eastward, passing over many
watercourses and grassy plains alternating with chains and ridges of low
forest, the trees being chiefly eucalyptus and myall (<i>Acacia Pendula</i>) in
full flower. He descended into a valley and crossed a stream which he named
Parry's Rivulet. Continuing to the north-east he sighted another range, and
this was named Hardwicke's Range, its native name being Nandewar. Its two
highest elevations were called Mount Apsley and Mount Shirley. While yet within
forty miles of Hardwicke's Range the country was merely a bog, and, being
forced to turn back, Oxley regained firm ground at Parry's Rivulet.</p>
<p>From this stream he made his way in a southerly direction over entirely new
country, and, on reaching Lushington Valley, to the northward of the Vansittart
Hills, turned eastward. He then discovered Liverpool Plains, which he entered
from the north-west.</p>
<p>After crossing the plains, and fording streams, among them the three rivers
named by Oxley--York, Bowen, and Field--the explorers encamped on the outskirts
of a "flat" bounded by hills which Oxley christened the Melville Range, one
peak being called Mount Dundas. From this they took their departure,
penetrating much bush and many valleys, and on September 2nd found the Peel
River (now the Namoi), which is a tributary of the Darling or Barwon. Leaving
it behind them they continued their journey and came to another flat through
which ran a tributary of the Peel which they called the Cockburn. On arriving
at the Dividing Range, Oxley crossed it and added the Bathurst Falls and Apsley
River, of which the Mackay forms the lower portion, to the list of his
discoveries.</p>
<p>He then came upon the Croker River and Seaview Mountain, which is 6,000 feet
high. From its summit an extended view was obtained of land and sea. The
pleasure Oxley and his party felt on first seeing the ocean near Port Macquarie
on September 23rd, after their difficult journey through unexplored country, is
vividly described in his journal. "Balboa's ecstasy at the first sight of the
South Sea," he says, "could not have been greater than ours, when, on gaining
the summit of this mountain, we beheld the ocean at our feet. Every difficulty
vanished, and, in imagination, we were already at home."</p>
<p>He was then about fifty miles from the coast, but between him and the sea
the country took the form of rugged hills and fertile valleys. In one of the
latter he found a small stream which he afterwards named the Hastings River,
and traced it to the coast at Port Macquarie, which he reached on October 8,
1818. Thence he travelled, partly on land and partly by sea, back to
Sydney.</p>
<p>Evans, who had been separated from Oxley for some part of the journey,
reported that the river Castlereagh also flowed through reeds, which stopped
his progress to the north-east. From this information Oxley concluded that all
three rivers--the Lachlan, Macquarie, and Castlereagh--terminated in swamp and
that their united waters formed an inland sea.[*]</p>
<blockquote>[* Sturt proved that the Macquarie and Castlereagh did not end in
swamp, and reported that the waters of the former continued to trickle through
reeds to Morrisett Ponds, which stream falls into the Castlereagh, and that all
three joined the Darling in lat. 30&deg;52' S. But Mitchell found that the
principal outlet of the Macquarie Marshes was not by Morrisett Ponds, as Sturt
had supposed but by Duck Creek, and that this channel is practically the
Macquarie reappearing and pursuing its course to the Darling, or, as it is
called at this point, the Barwon.]</blockquote>
<p>The discovery of the Liverpool Plains had left much to be desired, owing to
the intricate route by which Oxley had reached them; and the opinion that he
and those who accompanied him formed with regard to the termination of the
three rivers may be said, for a time at least, to have checked inland discovery
in New South Wales. A few minor tours, however, were accomplished successfully,
and, as Cunningham says, "some enterprising men crossed several untrodden
spaces" that separated the defined portions of the colony.</p>
<p>Among these tours may be numbered the one which Cunningham was preparing to
carry out from Bathurst--now a growing town which owed its prominence to the
fact that it had formed the starting-point of more than one well-equipped
expedition to the unknown interior. An account of his journey and a rough
sketch (see route map) of the ground traversed by him are given in the
following pages. The map constitutes a particularly interesting record of his
route, because at this time he appears suddenly to have stepped into the front
rank as a leader and explorer.</p>
<p>That he considered this northerly tour an important one he has been at pains
to point out in the report which afterwards he sent to the Governor. In it he
stated that, while the explorations carried out in 1817 and 1818 had made known
a large extent of fertile territory diverging from Bathurst on the south-west
and north-east, and although subsequent discoveries had opened up the land
southerly at the head of Campbell's River, and more particularly that bordering
" Mr. Throsby's country," yet no one had ventured to journey northwards until a
little over twelve months previously. Then Mr. Blackman, the late
superintendent, in advancing in that direction, had discovered "the valuable
limestone at 16 miles on his route; the Cugeegang[*] River at a distance Of 34
miles further; and the fine grazing land in the immediate vicinity of the
native station called Mudgee, 25 or 26 miles down the left bank of that
secondary stream. Although these lands were soon occupied by the flocks of
three individuals, with the approval of the Colonial Government, an
intermediate area of almost sixty miles had been left unoccupied and almost
wholly unknown." Cunningham continues: "Being aware that no outline of the
country between the two rivers [Macquarie and Cudgegong] had yet been made, I
bestowed considerable pains in taking bearings, etc., which have enabled me to
submit the accompanying outline to illustrate the lands through which my small
party passed."</p>
<blockquote>[* Cunningham always spells Cudgegong thus.]</blockquote>
<p>On November 18, 1822, Cunningham left Bathurst intending when he had reached
the Cudgegong River to travel down its banks, and he thus describes his
journey:[*] "Having forded Winburndale Creek, at about 5 miles from the
settlement the country, of easy acclivity to the first stage of about 16 miles
at the Lime Kiln, is well watered, not only by Clear Creek [this he crossed]
but also by other channels, some of which have rocky beds and form chains of
pools in the droughts of summer. The grasses and herbage are luxuriant; the
timber is stringy-bark and two other species of <i>Eucalyptus</i> of ordinary
size [at this time Cunningham was following the blazed trees of Lawson[*]] and
the whole stage affords excellent cattle runs.</p>
<blockquote>[* The extracts describing this period of Cunningham's travels have
been taken from the original manuscripts now in the possession of the Mitchell
Library, Sydney, copies of which, with one of the maps, have been placed in my
hands through the kindness of Mr. Hugh Wright, the librarian, to whom my most
cordial thanks are due.]</blockquote>
<blockquote>[* Lawson had preceded Cunningham to the Cudgegong.]</blockquote>
<p>"Onward two miles of the second stage, upon passing beyond the limit of the
limestone...the line of marked trees inclines...to westward and passes over
barren shingly hills clothed with a brushwood in which small stringy barks are
frequent. Beyond...the country improves (until a fine grassy wooded vale with
some deep ponds opens to the view) continuing exceedingly fertile to a spot
abounding in <i>Acacia</i> and denominated by the stock-people Wattle Ground.
During the succeeding five miles, the land...on the rise from the Lime Kiln
becomes exceedingly hilly...rising rapidly to a somewhat difficult packhorse
country...and these hills being short, steep and irregular render greater the
fatigue of travelling. The whole are well wooded and abound in grass excepting
upon the brows of the more elevated hills which are covered with low brushes,
not uninteresting to the botanist."</p>
<h3>ACROSS THE TURON AND CUDGEGONG</h3>
<p>After a long stage of twelve miles the line of trees descends to a river
named by the aborigines Tu-ron[*]...a small stream or rivulet running over a
pebbly bottom, which, although fordable at all parts of this season of the year
is evidently both from the mountainous character of the country through which
it passes and from the fact of stubble being lodged in the upper branches of
the Casuarina, liable to be much swollen in the season of rains. Its width in
the vicinity of the ford is about 30 feet, the depth 3 feet, the current
running south-westerly, at which point it is said to discharge itself into the
Macquarie 40 or 50 miles below the settlement of Bathurst. Some fine
pasturage...bordering upon the Turon, renders that stream a very desirable
situation for stock...Rising from the Turon to the summit of a very lofty steep
hill, and thence through elevated vales of good grassland about two miles, the
beaten route intersects a narrow swamp-oak creek [Swamp Oak or Red Chasm Creek
on the maps]...which dips to the westward.</p>
<blockquote>[* Famous in later years for the gold discoveries made there.
Sofala is on its banks.]</blockquote>
<p>"The line of marked trees continues nearly north during five miles, over
land of sub-mountainous character clothed with small timber and grass, each
intermediate vale having a rocky gully containing water...The marked trees lead
the traveller on to a long, steep, hilly ridge, named by the stock-people
Pleasant Range...Upon the main line of range, the beaten cattle-track continues
north to the brow of a hill; whence, upon looking to the east and north-east,
the eye is struck with the bold appearance of a curious romantic description of
scenery...Barren ridges, upon which rise cones more or less acute rounded
mountains and flat-topped table-hills seem to dot the country for a
considerable extent.</p>
<p>"In a circuit of two weeks made into this eastern country (subsequent to the
loss of my horses) I saw that, although surrounded by sandstone ranges, steep
heads, and rocky conical hills, there were patches of excellent grassy tracts
in the vales...which divide one ridge of hills from another...The disposition
of these separating valleys is generally S.E. and N.W...each having a chain of
pools or a running stream trending to the latter point of bearing and
collecting to discharge themselves into the Cugeegang. The timbers are blue gum
and stringybark and a bastard box; <i>Callitris abietina</i>, the pine or
cypress; <i>Acacia melanoxylon</i> or blackwood: <i>Sterculia heterophylla</i>;
and a few species of iron-bark. The grasses in the vales are luxuriant, but
differ from those about the settlement of Bathurst.</p>
<p>"Descending Pleasant Range...a fine fertile vale opens to the view, usually
called Table Bucco Flat,[*] which abounds in a fine nutritive herbage; viz.,
<i>Crepis</i>, or hawkweed; two species of birdsfoot trefoil; <i>Swainsona
coronillaefolia</i> (A vetch); Acoua, or Aroua, an Australian burnet;
<i>Sonchus oleraceus</i>, a sow-thistle; <i>Ranunculus lappaceus</i>, a
buttercup; <i>Plantago varia</i>, or rib-grass; and <i>Eryngium vesiculosum</i>
(Labill.), the bark of which is much eaten by sheep when young and before its
foliage acquires its hard, stiff, thorny nature. Besides the usual species of
<i>Eucalyptus</i>, a tree about 20 feet high of <i>Mimosa</i>[*] named
blackwood, and valuable on account of the extreme astringency or tanning
properties of its bark, is dispersed upon the declivities of the hills, and on
the verge of Table Bucco Flat (or Vale) in shaded situations.</p>
<blockquote>[* Spelled Tabble bucco in the map. Now Tabrabucka.]</blockquote>
<blockquote>[* <i>Acacia melanoxylon</i>.--Brown in "Hort. Kew," Vol.
V.]</blockquote>
<p>Cunningham's small party continued their journey through this "flat or vale"
which, he says, "winds to the eastward as well as to the westward, with all the
richness of the main vale." They still followed the beaten track made by the
Bathurst settlers in a northern direction, and which doubtless was used by the
stockmen of Wattle Flat (Cunningham's Wattle Ground) and the Turon. Some bushy
hills were then climbed, another vale was traversed and "a long grassy swamp
extending northwards for five miles" was sighted. The beaten path ran across
the swamp and Cunningham says it proved the most level country he had met with
since leaving Bathurst. Great blocks of granite were scattered over it, and
quartz in large pieces was seen upon the bushy hills--quartz which in after
years attracted many gold miners to the neighbourhood.</p>
<p>Cunningham continues: "The line of marked timber passes over a hilly range
lying east and west, and at length leads north down...to the forest land
bounding the Cugeegang River...As it had entered into my plans during the
progress of my little expedition to cross Liverpool Plains to York River and
continue north, as far as...my provisions upon a limited ration would admit, I
forded the Cugeegang at the place...marked on the outline, pitching my tent
about a mile and a quarter down the right bank. Being then on the verge of an
entirely unknown, unseen country, a line of marked route for my packhorses for
the following day was effected the preceding afternoon, and every arrangement
made whereby I could gather such materials as would enable me to give such a
sketch of the country through which we should pass, to afford a complete
knowledge of its geology, productions in natural history, and natural
resources"...</p>
<p>On the evening of this day, unfortunately, all Cunningham's arrangements
were to be upset. The men had tethered the packhorses, as they thought,
securely for the night, and having lighted their camp fire, were resting near
it when the fire caught some dry leaves and spread to the trunk of a large
tree, which soon burned rapidly. Before long it fell heavily to the ground and
the crash of the smouldering branches frightened the packhorses so much that
they broke loose and got free in the bush. Evidently they were not caught
again, for Cunningham states in his letters that through this occurrence all
his plans were defeated and he was compelled to return to Bathurst.</p>
<p>He gives the following account of his first coming to the river, which he
reached three days after he had left Bathurst:</p>
<p>"The Cugeegang (upon which is situated the native 'sitdown' or 'bimmil'
called Mudgee) is a small river which appears to take its rise in the broken
land N.E. of Table Bucco, and, after meandering through an irregular country to
the westward and passing through a small drain named by the
aborigines'Da-vy,'[*] its course is lengthened 50 miles N.W. to Mudgee, at a
short distance beyond which it suddenly winds to the westward and pours its
waters into the Macquarie River above Wellington Valley of Mr. Oxley, At this
season (November) the Cugeegang is at its lowest level, having at the ford we
passed only a breadth Of 12 feet by a depth Of 2&frac12;; from which, however,
it immediately widens into long reaches of considerable depth, bounded by bluff
rocky banks and grassy levels affording the following plants, which may serve
as the entire flora of a mile around my tent:</p>

<h4>EXCURSION FROM THE CUDGEGONG</h4>
<p>Before Cunningham returned to Bathurst after losing his pack-horses he
carried out, during the following fortnight, an interesting exploration of the
country lying to the eastward of his outward route. To do this he recrossed the
Cudgegong where he had first forded it, made his way back to Table Bucco Flat,
and from there set out in an easterly direction, reaching a hill called Erin's
Head on December 7th. From Erin's Head a remarkable acutely-pointed cone upon a
mountainous ridge was seen to the north-east and named Mount Aiton.</p>
<p>Cunningham now met with one swamp after another, and on the 8th, after
skirting a steep, rocky ridge, came to Mount Stirling, which stood, as did
Erin's Head, to the westward of a long, grassy range of hills faced with
sandstone on their northwestern side. Passing along the west side of Mount
Lethbridge he reached, on the 11th, a hummocky hill called the Sugarloaf. To
the north of it stood Mount Gidley, which forms a part of a range called King's
Range. These last names evidently were bestowed by Cunningham in honour of
Captain King's father. From here he turned south-westward through scrubby hills
alternating with fine pasture-land and came to some rocky ravines. Finding
himself unable to cross these, he set out once again to seek the Cudgegong,
and, entering a valley, he twice crossed a " pretty swamp-oak creek " which ran
through it. On continuing to trace this creek northwards he fell in with the
river at a point where Lieutenant Lawson had crossed it previously, and to the
eastward of where he first had forded it himself.</p>
<p>Here Cunningham met with Lawson's blazed trees, which he says "continued
towards the north-east." After passing over the river, the botanist made a
circuit on its north bank over some grassy, limestone hills covered with
Callitris. He kept on it, following a bend of the river westward, until he
reached his old ford at the spot where he had first encamped. From there he
made his way back to Bathurst, and eventually the party arrived at Parramatta
on January 4th, 1823.</p>
<p>Cunningham's map gives his route and describes the "curiously irregular
country" through which the Cudgegong passes, where ridges "surmounted by
conical peaks more or less acute, isolated bluff heads, tabular hills, and
rocks of sandstone" are dotted over the land. From these peaks and hills and
sandstone rocks one can obtain a good impression of the age of Australia from a
geological standpoint; and, as along the Queensland shores at Cape Melville,
there are ranged rocks and boulders which to those on board the passing ships
seem exactly to resemble ancient castellated buildings, so over the Cudgegong
country inland are to be found scattered upright rocks, isolated peaks, and
tabular hills which take the form of buildings, and some of these also have
what Nesbit has described as "a Tudor cast with many turrets and gables."[*]
The lichens and mosses which spread over the red sandstone, and, hanging down,
increase the shadows, add yet one more touch of age to their appearance. They
look like watch-towers or fortresses, and no doubt in olden days the blacks
used them as places of defence when the tribes were at war with each other.
Upon the rocks and huge stones of many a ridge and conical peak still may be
seen rude native carvings representing kangaroos, fishes and war weapons, and
the human hand. In some places one meets with a single hand upon a rock; in
others there are several hands together, generally showing the fingers widely
extended. Since the tribes of these parts are now extinct, it is to be hoped
that the carvings which are their only memorial may be carefully preserved.</p>
<blockquote>[* These castles of Nature's building can be seen in several
places. Leichhardt, the Queensland explorer, named a creek near Roper Pass,
where he encamped, "the Creek of Ruined Castles," because "high sandstone
rocks, fissured and broken, like pillars and walls and the high gates of ruined
castles" topped the hills on each side of the valley through which it
flowed.--Leichhardt's "Exploration," p. 57.]</blockquote>
<p>When Cunningham became the leader of an expedition, as well as its botanist,
he naturally evinced a deeper interest in the country and turned his attention
not only to its flora, but also to everything else he met with in his
travels.</p>
<p>Although he saw their marks on the hills everywhere, he apparently saw none
of the natives during this trip to the Cudgegong. He adds the following summary
of his observations to his report on the country through which he had
passed:</p>
<p>"The country abounds in kangaroo, <i>Didelphis</i> [= <i>Macropus</i>]
<i>giganteus</i>; emu, <i>Struthio australis</i> [= <i>Dromaeus
novae-hollandiae</i>]; native turkey (evidently an <i>Otis</i> or bustard);
several ducks, etc., of the genus <i>Anas</i>; pigeons, chiefly <i>Columba</i>
[= <i>Phaps</i>] <i>chalcoptera</i>, a bronze-winged species; a small
<i>Ardea</i> or crane; and a spur-winged plover (<i>Rallus</i>) are frequent in
the swamps, where also the small tortoise of the colony (<i>Testudo
longicollis</i>) was remarked. Others of the reptiles, as of the genus
<i>Lacerta</i>, are curious; of which <i>Lacerta ecaudata</i> [=
<i>Trachysaurus rugosus</i>], originally discovered in 1688 on the West Coast.
by the indefatigable navigator, Dampier, is not uncommon on the brushy hills;
also <i>L. variegata</i> (undescribed) remarkable for the unusual length of its
body, short thick tail tapering to a point, and very unproportionate small legs
covered with remarkable scales; also <i>L. orbicularis</i> (undescribed),
singular on account of the manner in which it can inflate its body into an
orbicular depressed form, and instantly contract it into a shrivelled, starved
figure by expelling the air which had previously swollen it. Its manner of
changing colour is curious. <i>L. muricata</i> of the colony is also very
frequent in dry, rocky hills. Of serpents, a black snake with a banded red
belly (<i>Coluber</i>) was frequent, whilst a larger species, brown on the back
and bright yellow underneath, was considerably rarer."</p>
<p>On his return to Bathurst Cunningham found that while he had been away
Lieutenant Lawson, then commandant there, whom he describes as "an enterprising
man" had been exploring to the northward accompanied by Mr. Scott. Lawson
appears to have made three if not four journeys in this direction. As to one of
these he reported to Governor Macquarie (August 29, 1821) that he had found "a
broken and mountainous country " thirty miles distant from the settlement. This
had seemed impossible to travel over with horses, but Lawson stated that he was
satisfied there was a pass to Liverpool Plains."</p>
<p>In a second journey Lawson traversed more than 400 miles, and it is believed
in the course of this expedition he reached Mudgee.[*] In his third journey in
January, 1822, he seems to have established his station at Talbragar. A
memorial which he addressed to the Secretary of State for the Colonies in
applying for a grant of land claims that he was not only the first to have
explored to the north and north-west of Bathurst but to have discovered a
passage through the Dividing Range. This is possibly a reference to the pass
that he had sighted in 1821. The Memorial[**] runs as follows:</p>
<blockquote>[* Selkirk: "Royal Aus. Hist. Journal," Vol. VI, Part
6.]</blockquote>
<blockquote>[** Dated June 3, 1826, and written from Veteran Hall,
Parramatta.--Record Office.]</blockquote>
<p>"Your Lordship's Memorialist desires it may not be unknown to you that he
was the first person to explore the country to the N. and N.W. of Bathurst
Settlement having marked a practicable road through an intricate country which
opens to an extensive and luxuriant tract of pasturage...and subsequently he
effected a communication between the settlement of Newcastle and Bathurst by
having discovered a passage through the Dividing Range."</p>
<p>Lawson does not actually mention Mudgee, and Allan Cunningham, as stated
above, attributes the original discovery of Mudgee to Mr. James Blackman in
1821, which is borne out by a memorial addressed by "James Blackman the
younger" to Governor Darling in 1829.[*] In this he also is applying for reward
in the form of a grant of land, and one of the services Blackman puts forward
in support of his claim is that in or about 1821 with a party consisting of
four persons besides himself he "discovered the road to Mudgee which had since
become one of the most fertile and flourishing parts of the Colony."</p>
<blockquote>[* Selkirk.]</blockquote>
<p>Although Lawson may not have discovered Mudgee, as well as being "an
enterprising man" he was a discoverer, for with Blaxland and Wentworth he had
first crossed the Blue Mountains, and he seems to have been again the first to
traverse the territory between Bathurst and the Cudgegong.</p>
<h4>JOURNEY TO THE PASS</h4>
<p>The short excursion to the Cudgegong proved the forerunner of greater
efforts, and in 1823 Cunningham extended his explorations as far as Pandora's
Pass. When he had sent the report of his Cudgegong tour to Sir Thomas
Brisbane,[*] the Governor expressed his warm approval of it and assured the
explorer that he had followed his route with the keenest interest, since he
believed it would prove an important factor "in directing the tide of
emigration towards the heart of the continent rather than coastwise."</p>
<blockquote>[* Brisbane had succeeded Macquarie.]</blockquote>
<p>It was then agreed that, if Cunningham would continue his investigations
further northward, the Government would provide the necessary equipment for his
journey. He wrote home to the authorities at Kew to inform them of the
Governor's wishes and that he had accepted the offer, and he added: "As I find
that I can blend discovery with botanical research tolerably well, I have
submitted my plans to His Excellency to prosecute my journey on or about the
meridian of Bathurst Town, north as far as the parallel of 29&deg;30' S.; then,
in a returning route south-easterly, to intersect the head streams of the Coal
River in order to ascertain how far a communication can be opened between
Liverpool Plains and the settlement at the upper parts of the Hunter River and
again between the latter and Bathurst."</p>
<p>On Monday, March 31st, 1823, Cunningham crossed the Nepean on his way to
Bathurst. He took with him five servants and "five strong packhorses" to carry
their provisions, and, passing over the Blue Mountains, reached Bathurst on
April 5th, and there spent ten days in making preparations for his journey.
First he had his horses newly shod (by a very bad blacksmith, as it turned
out), and provided himself with sufficient flour to last his party for at least
ten weeks.</p>
<p>On April 15th, on a warm, foggy morning, the expedition left the town.[*]
Following his former route by way of the Lime Kilns, the Turon River and Stony
Creek, Cunningham arrived at the Cudgegong on the afternoon of the 18th. The
recent rains had freshened up the grass, and, though late in the season, the
country wore a springlike appearance. Having crossed the river at the old ford,
his men pitched the tents on a flat on its north bank for the night. From here,
next day, after re-fording the river, he began to trace the Cudgegong on its
south bank eastwards. Abruptly steep hills inclining sharply to the water's
edge forced him to quit the riverside with his heavily-laden horses, and, after
keeping on a route varying south-south-east and east for four hours, he found
that the only way he could proceed at all was by climbing a main range. At four
in the afternoon he left it descending and entering a valley which he had
discovered in the previous year. He again crossed the "pretty swamp-oak creek"
flowing through it, and in an hour found himself among his old marked trees,
which led him to the junction of the creek and the Cudgegong, as well as to
Lieutenant Lawson's old crossing where he himself had passed over in the
previous December. He halted on a flat near the river for the night, which was
very chilly, and resumed his journey next day, the 21st, taking an easterly
course as close as the bushes would permit to the river, whose stream formed at
first basins of deep, stagnant water and then dwindled to a small, glassy
rivulet the channel of which was choked by reeds (<i>Arundo phragmites</i>).
After twelve miles, an encampment was made on a fine reach of the river, some
four miles west of Daby or Dabee. No signs of natives, or of animals, had been
seen throughout the day.</p>
<blockquote>[* "I used an excellent Schmalkalder's compass to direct my course
and take bearings, an odometer or improved perambulator to measure my distances
and base lines, and a good sextant with artificial horizon to obtain altitudes
for my latitudes."--Cunningham to Telfair.]</blockquote>
<p>Next day, heavy rain delayed progress, and Cunningham sent two men eastward
in the afternoon to a flat which he had seen from the ridge the day before, and
which he had concluded was Dabee. In the evening they returned and reported
that they had crossed the flat some three miles and a half distant and had
found that on the western edge of it a grazier residing at Bathurst had built a
hut and a stockyard.[*]</p>
<blockquote>[* Possibly Mr. Fitzgerald, who was one of the first, if not the
first, to settle there according to one of his descendants. Presumably
Fitzgerald's Swamp near Bathurst takes its name from the family. Mr. Cox also
was granted land there, but Cunningham does not give the settler's
name.]</blockquote>
<p>Cunningham's party reached Dabee on the 23rd. They found the river there
twelve yards wide, its banks low and muddy and overgrown with reeds. Draining
through these the water flowed over open grassy plains on which the squatter's
herds were feeding. Several small kangaroos were seen here, but not a trace of
any natives.</p>
<p>Cunningham had to wait some days for the return of one of his men from
Bathurst with a supply of horse-shoes and nails to replace those of two horses
which had fallen off. In the meantime he found several interesting plants
around the camp, and, mounting a double hill east from his tent, was able to
take a few bearings of the surrounding country.</p>
<p>On the 28th the party left Dabee and started on a northwesterly course,
having a semicircle of rocky hills to right of them: the principal peaks of
which were Mount Brace, Rurnker's Peak and Mount Walker. The line of route led
over a succession of moist valleys and stony ridges.</p>
<p>On the evening of the 29th they found a camping ground under a hill named
Mount Burchell. Next day their progress was retarded by mountainous country, of
which one range was covered by dense honeysuckle (<i>Banksia integrifolia</i>)
and abounding in rocky precipices. On this day, on reaching Mount Innes,
Cunningham caught a bird's-eye view of more promising land extending to the
base of a mountain range lying east and west, this being part of the Liverpool
Range and therefore the southern boundary of Liverpool Plains. He had heard of
this range before, for Lieutenant Lawson and Mr. Scott had reached it during
the preceding year but had not passed over it. Cunningham determined to cross
it, and, making his way to north-north-west, descended into a grassy valley,
forded Emu Creek, and travelled first over a thinly timbered tract for about
three miles, and then due north for five miles. He afterwards turned
north-by-east one mile and north-north-east for two miles through brushwood and
arrived at a patchy flat called by the natives, Nandoura, which was bordered
with sandy brushes of honeysuckle where there was little or no water. Progress
here became more difficult, low stony ridges intersecting his route.</p>
<p>On May 6th he descended into good country watered by a stream whose course
could be traced by the river-oaks on its banks. This was Lawson's Goulburn
River. Its outer channel was fifty yards wide, with water-marks showing twelve
feet above the level of its small stream, then almost hidden in reeds, and it
ran to the south-east. In some deep clear pools short, thick, black fish were
numerous, but would not take the bait, and among the grasses on the banks was a
tall species of <i>Danthonia</i> or oatgrass not seen elsewhere. Leaving the
Goulburn on the 8th and striking north-east, Cunningham's path led him to
another river, the Wemyss (also discovered by Lawson and Scott), and yet a
third river was intersected and now named Scott's Rivulet. The party traversed
its banks on a northerly course to the Liverpool Range now only fifteen miles
distant, the country through which they passed becoming very rough and broken
by deep valleys. When only five miles distant from a lofty point to which he
gave the name of Oxley's Peak, Cunningham encamped, and he determined to mount
the Main Range to take bearings, and if possible to obtain a glimpse of the
Liverpool Plains. It proved a hard task, for several streams issued from among
the precipices and formed picturesque waterfalls across his path. At last he
reached a peak which he called Mount Macarthur (now Mount Moan) and obtained a
fine view from its summit. To the south-west there were open plains and, amid a
more irregular country, others appeared to the south-east. To the northward
stretched the Liverpool Plains, which owing to the brown colour of the grass
looked like a desert. The greater part of the land to the north-west ran in
elongated strips into the region of forest ranges. A few detached mounds and
conical peaks were here and there picturesquely dotted over the open country.
Two noticeable peaks of the range were given the names of East Bluff and Mount
Palmer.</p>

<h4>CROSS'S MAP OF 1827, SHOWING CUNNINGHAM'S ROUTES IN HIS JOURNEY OF
1823</h4>
</center>
<p>Although it appeared as if there would be no great difficulty in travelling
along the northern side of the mountains facing Liverpool Plains, the horses
were then too tired to allow Cunningham to attempt the journey across the
barrier, and since the Liverpool Range looked lower to the eastward, he
resolved to continue to trace the southern face of the mountains in that
direction and to seek for a passage through them.[*]</p>
<blockquote>[* "Perceiving from my commanding station" (Mount Macarthur) "the
total impossibility of leading the packhorses through the ravines, or on a
lofty, irregular surface of this belt of mountains, I attempted to penetrate
easterly at their immediate base in search of a gap, but finding (after
exhausting man and horse) the mountains became more precipitous at that
bearing, I regained my original position after a circuitous route Of 3 weeks
and 3 days, and then, having reduced the weekly ration of myself and people,
stood away N.N.W."--Cunningham to Aiton.]</blockquote>
<p>After searching for five days for a pass through the range to the east of
Mount Macarthur and traversing a distance Of 35 miles without seeing an opening
he "halted on the verge of a perpendicular ravine, being unable to advance
another mile to the eastward by reason of the sharp water gullies between which
lay steep ravines. In spite of these difficulties water was easily obtained, as
it had been ever since leaving the Goulburn River, no fewer than nineteen
creeks having been crossed in this journey, all of which ran to the south-east,
the outer channel of one stream "exceeding 20 feet in breadth." He writes:
"Since the whole of these streams have one common tendency southerly towards
the extreme or western end of the trunk or main branch of the Coal River,
little or no doubt can exist of their constituting its principal sources,
especially as the body of water agrees with the magnitude of Hunter's River at
that stage of its ascent."</p>
<p>Seeing that it was impossible to advance further eastward Cunningham, who
must have been keenly disappointed, turned and descended into open forest land
lying farther southward, so that by travelling westward over less difficult
country he might retrace his steps to the Goulburn.</p>
<p>In his route westward back to the Goulburn, on the 19th, he passed over a
stream whose outer banks were forty yards wide, though the stream itself was
but sixteen feet. This was Dartbrook in the county of Brisbane. On the 21st he
came to another which was named the Blaxland, and which, according to his
estimate was to develop at twenty miles distance into the Paterson River. He
encamped on its bank, and, on taking a northerly course next day, again met
this stream ten miles nearer its source. After proceeding five miles, to the
westward he reached open country where a large swamp-oak rivulet wound round
the base of a ridge on its western side, which he named Smith's Rivulet.[*] At
this point he was detained (on its left bank) for four days by the illness of
one of his men. Resuming his journey west-by-north on the 29th, he passed along
a valley through which another stream, a counterpart of the last, descended
from the base of the Northern Mountains. After leaving it, in about eleven
miles the party crossed Scott's Rivulet and came to the Wemyss at the spot at
which they had forded it three weeks previously. When they arrived at the
Goulburn on May 31st, rations were running low and both men and horses were
placed on a reduced supply. It was decided, however, to push on from here to
the north-north-west, whither the ridges seemed to extend in an almost unbroken
line.</p>
<blockquote>[* "The situation of our encampment on Smith's Rivulet being in
32&deg;2'6" S. and presumed long, about 150&deg;24' E."]</blockquote>
<p>The men quitted their camp on June 2nd, and passed over fine forest country
and narrow but rich and well-watered valleys. In their next day's advance a
series of lofty ranges, extending from eastward in a north-westerly direction,
forced them into difficult mountainous country and caused them to take a more
westerly course. On the 4th after they had completed a laborious journey of
nearly seven miles they met with a lateral branch of the range trending S.W.
and came face to face with a very narrow deep ravine which entirely stopped
their progress. While halted here Cunningham says that in this route westward,
"We passed the lofty ranges which separate the eastern and western waters" The
country looked closed to them "from east by way of north to almost west," and
so hopeless was the outlook that he tells us he had almost "determined to quit
its blackened ranges altogether."</p>
<p>But he then caught a glimpse of patches of open plain to the
south-south-west. This was the only direction in which there appeared to be any
clear land at all, and he resolved to descend to it at once. At this stage
Cunningham experienced anxiety as to what route he should take, for the
wretched condition of both men and horses, owing to their reduced rations, told
him that they could not long subsist upon so little food. On the 5th,
fortunately, he reached a fine, rich valley watered by a creek issuing from a
ravine where apple-tree, blue gum and swamp oak were growing. Following this
valley he found that it broke into small open plains, clear of timber,
stretching north-north-east, and south-south-west. The steep hills bounding it
on the west side became low towards a patch of plain in the distance which he
named Duguid's Plain.</p>
<p>Over this plain Cunningham steadily advanced westwardly, making his way
through open forest, which brought him to another massive, bold range, and this
range bounded a valley to the southward much more ample at its entrance from
the forest and much more promising in its trending than any other valley he had
yet seen. Taking a course over an apple-tree flat and along the banks of a fine
creek which ran through the valley, he followed it to the N.N.E. for eight
miles, when it became very narrow and intricate. He then decided to mount the
western range and take his bearings. The view he thence obtained filled him
with delight; for, on looking round him and tracing the line of the main
northern range, he saw a considerable depression, and writes: "it was a very
low back in the main ridge distant about 3 miles, and although limited,
afforded me a clear view of the open plains north of this extensive barrier."
He also distinguished several mounts that he had seen previously from Mount
Macarthur, further to the eastward.</p>
<p>On descending from the mountain, Cunningham lost no time in shifting his
encampment to an open valley which ran to the foot or base of the mountains
(the western end of the Liverpool Range). The new encampment was placed within
two or three miles of the "low back" or passage into Liverpool Plains. Having
given directions for a line of trees to be marked from the encampment through
the passage to the verge of the nearest clear land beyond, he climbed to the
summit of a mountain that formed the eastern side of the pass and obtained a
most beautiful view of the hidden plains.</p>
<p>From the northern base of the Liverpool Range a level, open forest-land was
seen to extend from W.N.W. to N. On the eastern side of the woody country was
easily traceable, by the trees on its banks, a small rivulet (Swamp Oak
Rivulet) which, rising in the Liverpool Range, ran due north, its course
forming with the forest the western boundary of the nearest or most southerly
extensive patch of clear plain. This plain formed a considerable expanse of
brown grass and herbage and, excepting a small clump and a few scattered trees
at its south-western angle, was perfectly clear of scrub. He was glad also to
see that the declivity on the north side of the mountains seemed not too rough
for his pack-horses and that it was only one mile distant from the wooded
country at its base, which was watered by streams that ran to the
northward.</p>
<p>Cunningham says that he named the pass Pandora's Pass,[*] and that he
"believed it would become the great route of communication between Bathurst and
Hunter River and the Liverpool Plains." His journey now terminated, his men
were fatigued, and his provisions had ran out. The latitude of his tent in the
valley below the pass he gives as 31&deg;43'45" S., and the longitude, by
estimation, 149&deg;30' E. Before leaving it, a paper containing the following
account of their travels was enclosed in a bottle and placed under a tree:</p>
<blockquote>[* Now also known as Brennan's Gap.]</blockquote>
<p>"After a very laborious and harassing journey from Bathurst since April last
a party consisting of 5 persons under the direction of Allan Cunningham, His
Majesty's Botanist (making the sixth individual), having failed in finding a
route to Liverpool Plains while tracing the southern base of the Barrier
Mountains before us northward so far as 50 miles to the E. of this spot, at
length prosecuting their research in a westerly direction reached this valley
and discovered a practicable and easy passage...to the very extensive levels
connected with the above plains, of which the southernmost of the chain is
distant about 11 or 12 miles (by estimation) N.N.W. from this valley and to
which a line of trees has been carefully marked.</p>
<p>"This valley, which extends S.W. and W.S.W., has been named Hawkesbury Vale,
and the high point of the range bearing N.W. by W. from this tree was called
Mount Jenkinson, the one a former title, the other the family name of the noble
earl whose present title the plains bear to which from the southern country
this gap affords the only passage. The party encountered many privations in
travelling to and returning from the eastward. In spite, however, of these
evils, a Hope...at the close of their journey induced them to persevere
westerly and this passage was discovered. It has therefore been named Pandora's
Pass. Due east and west by compass from this tree in a direct line of 336 yards
were planted the fresh stones of peaches brought from the colony in April last
with every good hope that their produce will one day or other afford some
refreshment to the weary farmer on his route...North of Pandora's Pass a like
planting took place on the plains 12 miles N. at the last marked tree. A
remarkable high mountain above the Pass eastward, being a guide to the
traveller advancing S. from the plains, has been named Direction Head. The
situation of this tree is as follows: lat., observed on the 7th and 8th June,
1823, 32&deg;15'19' S.; long. (presumed) 149&deg;30' E. The party now proceed
with the utmost despatch S. for Bathurst."</p>
<p>Signed " A. CUNNINGHAM, June 9th, 1823."</p>
<p>Endorsed: "Buried for the information of the first farmer who may venture to
advance so far to the northward as this vale of whom it is requested this
document may not be destroyed but carried to the settlement at Bathurst after
the opening of the bottle."</p>
<p>The Rev. George Grimm writing in 1888, says: "The bottle was found a few
years ago and the explorer's directions carried out."[*] The writer, however,
has not been able to trace any other authentic record of this.</p>
<blockquote>[* "Australian Explorers," p. 57.]</blockquote>
<p>Beginning his return journey on the 9th, Cunningham proceeded along the
Hawkesbury Vale and found it to consist of a rich flat watered by a swamp-oak
creek and bounded on its south-east side by a ridge of hills, the mountain
range overhanging it to the N.W. The vale opened on a clear patch of plain, the
stream,[*] winding round the fringe of a range on the west side of "the
beautiful, open, level tract which," says Cunningham, "I have named Harrison's
Plain." On the 10th he continued to travel in a south and west direction and
had accomplished fourteen miles from the northern extreme of Harrison's Plain,
when he halted upon a creek which "receding from the base of the western range
assumed the character of a deep-banked rivulet." A level tract between it and
the range was named Alcock's Plain, "in compliment to a gentleman of His
Majesty's Treasury that to the northward having been called after one of its
secretaries."</p>
<blockquote>[* The Coolaburragundy, or northern tributary of the
Erskine.]</blockquote>
<p>Journeying southward about a mile from here, the party on the 11th reached
the edge of another open level plain, which was named Aiton's Plain (its native
name is Bonana), and was bounded on the north by the mountainous range and on
the opposite side by a broken ridge of sandstone rock. Upon quitting this plain
Cunningham pepetrated a forest of box abounding in a brush of native indigo
(<i>Indigofera australis</i>), and the blue vine, (<i>Kennedia monophylla</i>),
and at last reached the foot of a detached rocky head, which he ascended to
obtain a view of the surrounding country. This broken mount or head he named
Station Head. From it he could see to the eastward of Aiton's Plain, and that
there was separated from it by a line of apple-trees yet another and larger one
which he called Hawkins' Plain, The country to the S.S.W. and S.W. did not
appear, as seen from Station Head, to present any great difficulties in the
route of the travellers.</p>
<p>On the 12th a low, heavily-timbered flat, abounding in pools of water where
many bog plants were flourishing, was crossed, and the men arrived at the side
of a small river whose steep, muddy banks, clothed with tall reeds, hid its
deep waters, which ran westward. After tracing it for a mile and a half,
Cunningham forded it: he thought it was formed by the union of three swamp-oak
creeks to the northward which he had crossed before he had discovered Pandora's
Pass. It was about 12 yards wide and subject to flood, when it appeared as if
the whole of the forest-land, from its banks to a pine-ridge a mile distant,
was laid under water. Cunningham tells us that it was called Pubo-batta by the
natives. He named the stream Lawson's River, after the Commandant at Bathurst,
"who first intersected it in January, 1822, to the westward of this point."</p>
<p>On the 13th, having taken bearings of a hummocky range at S.S.E., distant 25
miles, which he recognised as being only a short distance from Mudgee,
Cunningham felt sure the Cudgegong was near at hand. Next day, when descending
a ridge S.E. to a marshy valley, he crossed cattle-tracks of a recent date
which, he says, proved that his surmise was correct. About three miles from
here the party crossed a broad, shoally creek (evidently the channel by which
these wet lands drained to the Cudgegong), where the men, all now greatly
fatigued, encamped.</p>
<p>Starting early on the 15th, the travellers fell in with a stockman employed
by Mr. Cox who, in answer to their inquiries as to where the creek joined the
river, directed them to continue their route along the creek, until it met the
Cudgegong three miles below the homestead at a clear, fertile flat known as
Gurran. Here the stream was swollen and the men eventually crossed opposite the
stockyard (being 23 miles below Cunningham's former point of intersection).[*]
Resting here till the 20th Cunningham began his journey from Menar or Menah
(the native name for the station) to Bathurst, where he arrived on June 27,
1823, after an absence of eleven weeks, during which we are told that his
pack-horses had passed over 509 miles of measured land; and the capabilities of
the country, the springheads of Hunter River, and the route to Liverpool Plains
from Bathurst, had all been fully ascertained.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVI</h2>
<h3>MOUNT TOMAH, MORETON BAY AND THE BRISBANE RIVER. THROUGH PANDORA'S PASS TO
CAMDEN VALLEY</h3>
<p>On returning from his western tour, Cunningham set out with a small party to
visit Cox's River. He chose a new route across the Blue Mountains, taking a
road that had been lately marked out by Mr. Bell, and known as Bell's Road.
Owing to unforeseen circumstances, Cunningham could not reach the river,
although lie was able to examine Mount Tomah and other parts of the mountains
lying to the north of the Grose.</p>
<p>As a botanist he was perhaps more drawn to the Blue Mountains than to any
other part of the colony, for an amazing variety of plants grew in the ranges.
It was there that he obtained the rare specimens of mountain flora which can be
seen to-day in the herbarium at South Kensington including those he gathered at
Mount Tomah.</p>
<p>In this excursion he seems to have been most attracted by the "stately"
timber trees, their rigid branches half hidden by creepers; the tall,
tree-ferns in groups beneath the shade of massive rocks with rough brown trunks
supporting fronds of delicate green; the lichens and mosses, in places covering
the face of the sandstone; the tender tiny maidenhair growing in the crevices
of the rocks and under the dripping ledges; and, towering above them all, the
waratah or native tulip (<i>Telopea speciosa</i>), its crimson flower, upon its
upright stalk, visible upon the more distant heights of the mountains. All
these he saw and described in his journal.</p>
<p>Having left Bell's Farm on November 26th, 1823, the little party followed
the marked trees of a surveyor[*] who had reported upon this new route, and
quickly gained the main range. The "road" was bounded on each side by deep
ravines, and in the course of their ascent became very narrow, its surface
being covered with ferns and thicket. At 4 p.m. after having travelled six
miles, the men rested for the night near a gully where they found fresh water.
On the following day their path led them through a brushy forest, then across
an open patch of rising ground which soon reverted to forest, its timber being
chiefly Tristania albicans, the turpentine tree of the colonists. Here they saw
some beautiful tree-ferns, <i>Alsophila</i>, fifteen to twenty feet high,
<i>Tetrathera dealbata</i>, and a tree of <i>Urticaceae</i> bearing compound
globular fruit.</p>
<blockquote>[* This surveyor may have been Mr. Govett, who discovered Govett's
Leap, and was the writer of an interesting article describing the mountains
(signed W.R.G.) that appeared in "The Saturday Magazine" for May, 1836. In the
magazine his name is spelled Govatt.]</blockquote>
<pre>
{Ebook editor's note:

It was, in fact, The surveyor Robert Hoddle, as shown in the Colonial
Secretary Index, which states:--

"On Sep 23rd 1823, J. Oxley instructing him to survey Bell's track from
Richmond to Cox's River, explore for better road to Hunter River settlements,
report on farms occupied at Kurrajong Brush, make survey of Government lands
at Longbottom, etc." (Reel 6068; 4/1814 pp.91-4)

Hoddle reported on Nov 4th "--on his survey of new route from Hawkesbury
River to Cox's River discovered by Mr Bell, exploration of mountainous
district overlook Hunter River; discovery and naming of Panoramic Hill and
Pyramid Hill" (Reel 6068; 4/1814 pp.109-15).}
</pre>
<p>Half a mile farther the range came to an abrupt rocky termination to the
westward. From the top of this rocky height, which had received the name of
Bell's View, an extensive landscape from S. by way of W. to E. opened to their
gaze. To the S.W. and S.S.W. a series of moderately broken ranges extended
beyond the Old Western Road, then better known as Evans's Track. From N.W. to
N.N.W. Cunningham found that the features of the country resembled those of the
land on the Cudgegong to the eastward of Dabee, seen by him in his last
tour.</p>
<p>The western face of the rocks where the range ended being too steep and
precipitous to descend, the party followed the surveyor's marked trees along
the slope of a steep ravine that trended to the S.W. and descended into brushy,
level country. The brush now became exceedingly dense, being over twelve feet
high in places and composed chiefly of <i>Pultenaea linophylla</i>, <i>Daviesia
ulicina</i> and <i>Bursaria spinosa</i>, or perhaps a distinct species similar
to some found on the Hastings River. Four miles from Bell's View the party
encamped on the edge of another ravine which they quitted next morning, the
28th, and, following the blazed trees westerly, came to another
<i>Pultenaea</i> brush as lofty and dense as those they had passed on the
previous day. The timber at this point was of regular growth, and consisted of
blue gum, stringy-bark and turpentine trees. No stream crossed the lonely road,
but some water was found in the neighbouring gullies.</p>
<p>At the 14th mile a dry scrub took the place of the brush, in which
<i>Banksia serrata</i> of large size, <i>Lomatia silaifolia</i> (parsley fern),
<i>Isopogon anemonifolius</i>, <i>Telopea speciosa</i>, <i>Lambertia
formosa</i> and several well-known Parramatta plants were flourishing in great
luxuriance. Another mile onward, <i>Indigofera australis</i>, <i>Bursaria
sp.</i> and <i>Daviesia ulicina</i>, bound together by <i>Smilax australis</i>,
<i>Cassylha paniculata</i> and <i>Clematis coriacea</i>, formed a compact
thicket and it was with difficulty the men and the pack-horses got through it.
Dense bush continued until the nineteenth mile, when Cunningham reached the
broken country he had seen from Bell's View. Tracing the blazed trees upward,
he and his men ascended the side of the mountain and climbed the fallen timber
and scaled the large rocks, some of which were concealed by luxuriant ferns,
until at last the summit was gained, and the tents pitched at the spot where
the surveyor's party had previously rested.</p>
<p>"The summit of the mountain is named by the aborigines Tomah," writes
Cunningham, "and is 20 miles distant from the Hawkesbury ford at Richmond." The
appearance of the timber at this height differed greatly from the
<i>Eucalyptus</i> in the open country below, and he was struck by the
stupendous size and extraordinary windings of the climbers, particularly of a
<i>Cissus</i>, and also by the magnificent tree-ferns, <i>Dicksonia
antarctica</i>, some of which were thirty feet in height and six to fourteen
inches in diameter. All were tired out when they reached the top of Mount Tomah
and no grass could be found for the exhausted pack-horses; only among the ferns
was a species of <i>Senecio</i>, the heads of which the animals appeared to
nibble.</p>
<p><i>Nov. 29th.</i>--"It was my intention," continues Cunningham, "to have
spent a whole day at this encampment in order to examine the summit of Mount
Tomah, but as it afforded my horses no fodder, that determined me to proceed
westward early in the afternoon. As far as I could ascertain the timbers were
two lofty species of <i>Eucalyptus</i>; one called white gum, <i>Ceratopetalum
apetalum</i> (I have not the fruit); <i>Achras australis</i>,. <i>Tristania
albicans</i>; <i>Olea paniculata</i>; <i>Elwaeodendron australe</i>; and by far
the more general tree, growing 60-70 feet, is a species of <i>Atherosperma</i>
(sassafras).</p>
<p>"Twining and climbing plants of vast strength and magnitude hang from the
heads of the loftiest trees and bore upon their pliant stems abundance of
climbing <i>Polypodia</i> and tufts of <i>Dendrobium</i> allied to <i>D.
rigidum</i>. Another plant of this beautiful family, rarely to be met with in
the colony, I observed in flower sparingly; it was <i>Sarcochilus falcatus</i>,
of which I gathered a few living specimens. Hanging in clusters from the
highest branches of the trees, I detected a third species of this family,
probably a <i>Dendrobium</i>, not apparently noticed by Mr. Brown: its long,
slender, almost filiform stems were supported by strong roots which adhered
firmly to the branches of the trees whence these plants swing in the breeze
perfectly unencumbered and clear of the stems. A climbing, rooted-stemmed plant
adhering to the trunks of the tree-ferns is very general in these shaded woods,
where it also covers fallen timber. I was fortunate in detecting it in fruit
and flower: it belongs to that division of <i>Bignoniaceae</i> of
<i>Jussieu</i> producing baccate fruit.[*] The filices are numerous and
curious.</p>
<blockquote>[* Field's "New South Wales," p. 363, T. 2.]</blockquote>
<p>"The soil of these shades is a loam blended with much decomposed vegetable
matter. In this earth I remarked, partly buried, large blocks of compact
whinstone, and in the banks of the water gullies I traced an abundance of
slate. Fresh water percolates through the soil into the gullies and, although
impregnated with iron, was of good quality. About 1 p.m. we continued our route
over the mountain by the marked trees along a winding course through the
darkest parts of the forest to the north-western declivity.</p>
<p>"Lofty, densely-timbered, mountainous ranges now appeared before us, peering
over each other in no series or order but assuming an aspect so formidable by
their peculiar faces overhanging deep ravines as to seem to defy all further
attempt to penetrate westerly. However, we traced our way by the line of marked
trees down the declivity, which at every step became more and more dangerous by
reason of the loose fragments of sandstone and shelving rock strewn on the
surface.</p>
<p>"In spite of every care, the heaviest-laden packhorse, in attempting to jump
down a perpendicular fall of rock of three feet in depth, lost his balance and
got off his legs in an instant on the edge of a declivity, down which he rolled
over five times before his descent was stopped by the saddlebags. On being
disburdened of his load, he got upon his legs, evidently much shaken but with
no bones broken. The dangers of the loosely-stoned track along a sharp decline
of the mountains, frequently obstructed by fallen timber, appeared so
considerable as scarcely to warrant our further prosecution of the journey to
Cox's River with packhorses so heavily laden as ours. Unwilling, however, to
halt and suffer myself to be discouraged by a single accident, we continued
along the slope of the mountain another half-mile, when, both my wearied beasts
having repeatedly fallen and the path becoming more rough and dangerous with
shelving rocks and fallen timber, I was obliged to halt in stony scrub on the
sharp side of the mountain, it being dusk, and heavy rain having set in for the
night. We pitched our tent, gave our poor beasts a little corn, frugally
issued, and secured them to the trees around our fire without a blade of grass
or herb for them to eat, the recent fires having destroyed every kind of
vegetation.</p>
<p><i>30th</i>--"Some young rushes being found on a patch of bog by one of my
people, I caused the horses to be shifted and tethered upon it. It however
benefited them nothing, since they partook but little of it.</p>
<p><i>Dec. 1st.</i>--" The route westerly proving much more rugged and
dangerous, and as my horses are now much reduced and the line of road before me
(18 miles to Cox's River) having been reported by the surveyor to be of nothing
but and brushes, I have been induced from necessity to proceed back to my
encampment at Tomah, where I propose to remain a day to rest my wearied
horses."</p>
<p>The horses having refused to eat the grass found on Mount Tomah, and growing
daily more emaciated, Cunningham despatched the weakest in charge of one of the
men back to his encampment of the 27th, while he employed himself at the
mountain in collecting parasitic orchids, of which three species were diffused
through the forests, though difficult to obtain, since they were hanging from
the highest branches of the largest trees. He collected <i>Sarcochilus
falcatus</i> in flower growing on the branches of <i>Atherosperma</i>;
<i>Dendrobium linguaeforme</i> (allied to <i>D. rigidum</i>); and a third
species hanging from the highest trees. He succeeded in gathering specimens in
flower of a tree forty feet high whose natural habits were very remarkable. It
was seen frequently growing together with the <i>Dicksonia antarctica</i>, the
tree-fern of this mountain, each having its separate stem in the ground, but so
united as to appear a single tree, although on one side could be perceived the
rough bark of the tree and on the opposite the rugged caudex of the tree-fern;
and every specimen of the <i>Dicksonia</i> had young seedlings of this tree
growing from its stem.[*] On the 3rd Cunningham quitted Mount Tomah and began
his homeward journey to Parramatta.</p>
<blockquote>[* Heward states that this tree was <i>Quintinia Sieberi</i> (A. de
Cand.). See "Annals of Natural History," Vol. II, P. 356.]</blockquote>
<p>Another expedition to the Illawarra in July and August was purely a
botanizing tour, and it was noteworthy, like the last, for the number of living
plants Cunningham obtained.</p>
<p>Before starting for Illawarra, he paid a flying visit to Bathurst, and on
returning to Parramatta found that the French ship "Coquille" (Captain
Duperrey) was at anchor in Port Jackson. He accompanied the French scientists
in their excursions over the Blue Mountains; and his knowledge of the ranges
proved helpful to MM. Durnont d'Urville and Lesson, the former then acting as
botanist, while the latter was naturalist to the French expedition.</p>
<p>At the end of March, 1824, the King's Botanist (the title by which
Cunningham appears to have been best known) began a southerly journey through
the counties of Argyle and Camden. At this time he visited Lake George and Lake
Bathurst. A plant of the south coast discovered in 1802 by Mr. Brown
(<i>Lomatia ilicifolia</i>), found growing in great profusion in the Argyle
district, and the singular limestone caves to which he paid a short visit,
seemed to him the most interesting features of this excursion. The distance
travelled was about 420 miles, and he returned to Parramatta in May.</p>
<p>Cunningham was botanizing at Illawarra when he heard that Mr. Oxley was
preparing to voyage to Moreton Bay, taking with him a party "equipped with
every necessary store and provision to found a colony there." Included in
Oxley's party were Lieutenant Millar, 40th Regiment, his wife and family,
fourteen soldiers, a commissariat officer or storekeeper, his assistant, and
about twenty prisoners, Lieutenant Millar having been appointed commandant of
the proposed settlement.</p>
<p>On hearing this news Cunningham hurried back to Sydney and joined Oxley, who
sailed in the "Amity" brig on September 2nd, arriving safely at Moreton Bay on
September 11, 1824.</p>
<p>Before relating Cunningham's adventures at Moreton Bay it is necessary at
this point to give some account of the earlier history of the bay wherein the
capital of Queensland is situated.</p>
<h4>MORETON BAY AND THE BRISBANE RIVER</h4>
<h4>FLINDERS, OXLEY AND CUNNINGHAM</h4>
<p>It will be remembered that on Thursday, May 17, 1770, Cook had discovered
Point Lookout and had named a wide, open bay on the north side of it Morton's
Bay. Banks, too, had written on that day, "I was led to conclude that the
bottom of the bay might open into a large river," for the sea-water here had
turned a dirty clay colour as if charged with freshes.</p>
<p>In 1799 Captain John Hunter, Governor of New South Wales, aware that Cook's
discoveries of Moreton Bay and Harvey Bay remained unsurveyed, agreed to
Matthew Flinders' proposal to examine both harbours; Moreton Bay at this time
being more generally known as Glasshouse Bay. Hunter, however, informed
Flinders that he must complete the voyage in six weeks.</p>
<p>Flinders and his brother Samuel Flinders, a midshipman in the "Reliance,"
left Sydney on July 8th in the colonial sloop "Norfolk,"[*] the small ship in
which Flinders and Bass had recently circumnavigated Tasmania. She was manned
by volunteers from the "Reliance" and the "Buffalo"; and Boongaree,[**] the
Broken Bay native, made one of the crew. As he sailed northwards Flinders
carefully traced the East coast placing on his chart that part of it which Cook
had left uncharted. On the 9th he named Sugarloaf Point and noted the situation
of two dangerous rocks (Seal Rocks). At Cape Hawke he found that what Cook had
mistaken for two hillocks was in fact the pitch of the Cape itself. On July
10th, the "Norfolk"sprang a leak which gave all on board cause for alarm. She
now passed the Solitary Islands, and Flinders added five to those on his chart
discovered by Cook. He records that he thought these islands might with equal
propriety have been termed "miserable." On July 11th, he saw a small river-like
opening (Wooli Wooli River) in 29&deg;43' S., with an islet at its entrance,
and at sunset entered a larger inlet, to which he gave the name of Shoal Bay.
He went in his boat to examine this harbour and found it shallow, but missed
seeing the entrance to the Clarence River, which admittedly is not easily
distinguished.</p>
<blockquote>[* Built in Norfolk Island of the pine of the
country.]</blockquote>
<blockquote>[** There are variations in the diaries of the spelling of this
name.]</blockquote>
<p>Returning to the sloop at noon he next landed on the South Head and proved
the entrance to be in 29&deg;26'28". On the South Head some native huts were
seen, circular in form, the framework of each being made of vine shoots crossed
and bound together with grass, superior to any at Port Jackson. The palm-nut
tree mentioned by Cook was found growing here.</p>
<p>On the afternoon of the 12th Flinders weighed and made sail, and next day
passed Mount Warning and Cape Byron; and, in order to avoid the reef off Point
Danger, he then kept his ship at some distance from the coast.</p>
<p>On the 14th he again drew near the land at Point Lookout and found its
latitude to be 27&deg;27' S., whereas Cook had made it 27&deg;6'. At dusk Cape
Moreton bore west two or three miles and over the distant land the highest
Glasshouse Mountain appeared W. 3&deg; or 4&deg; N. Two hummocks resembling
hay-cocks opened soon afterwards a few degrees to the southward.</p>
<p>The "Norfolk" stood round Cape Moreton and steered westward to enter Moreton
Bay, but, finding the passage blocked up by sand shoals and there being little
wind, Flinders dropped anchor for the night at eight o'clock, Cape Moreton then
bearing E.S.E. two or three miles. Weighing again on the 15th July[*] the sloop
steered eastward and worked down the western shores of what Flinders afterwards
called Moreton Island until he reached lat. 27&deg;00'29" S., Cape Moreton then
bearing east 10&deg; north two or three miles. While ranging within a mile of
the shore ten natives, some of whom were women, greeted the vessel after the
native fashion, shouting words similar to those used by the Port Jackson
blacks; one waved a green branch from side to side until it touched the ground;
others beat the surf with their sticks and all seemed anxious for the ship to
draw further into the bay.</p>
<blockquote>[* This is an important date, as, according to Flinders he made his
way into Moreton Bay on the 15th. Collins, who wrote his Voyage, makes it the
14th.]</blockquote>
<p>At eight in the evening Flinders anchored in eleven fathoms of water, two
miles from a low sandy shore on the west side of the bay, off a point at the
southern end of Bribie Island. At daylight next morning, the 16th, the sloop
weighed to sail up the bay, and while she was beating through the shoals
Flinders caught sight of an opening in the low land to westward. He wished to
come to an anchorage there but, shoal water preventing him, he anchored among
the shoals at a quarter past eight in three fathoms. After breakfast a boat was
lowered and Flinders, accompanied by Boongaree, went to examine the opening.
"In approaching the sandy point on the east side of it some dogs were noticed
on the beach," and soon afterwards natives appeared with their fishing nets
over their shoulders. They apparently were unarmed but many carried pieces of
wood in their hands. The boat drew closer in shore and the men lay on their
oars while Flinders by signs tried to converse with the natives.</p>
<p>Boongaree wished to go and speak to them, and on meeting them immediately
began to make friends, exchanging his yarn belt for a fillet of kangaroo hair.
As all seemed well, Flinders took his gun and prepared to join Boongaree, but,
seeing that they eyed his weapon suspiciously, he placed it on the beach before
he approached the group of natives. He gave one man a woollen cap and showed
that he desired a net bag in exchange. Flinders happened to be wearing a white
cabbage-tree hat, at which from the first moment they saw it the blacks cast
longing glances. Its neatly plaited strands drew forth their admiration, for
they were experts of the art, and a little later the hat became the innocent
cause of a sudden display of anger on the part of the islanders. On their
asking for it and its being refused them the man who had accepted the cap threw
it behind him and tried to secure the hat. At first the natives appeared
amiable, and although they followed Flinders and Boongaree too closely on their
return to the boat they were not unduly excited.</p>
<p>Then a native with a long, hooked stick tried to remove Flinders' hat;
another stretched his arm for it from behind. These futile attempts created
laughter, but when they saw the boat putting off from the shore the temper of
the natives suddenly changed. One threw a piece of firewood at the strangers;
another, running into the surf, hurled a second piece at short range. Both
missiles fell short and a few moments later the man in the water threw a spear,
which passed over the centre of the boat close to the gunwale. In reply to this
unprovoked attack Flinders twice snapped his gun at the blackfellow, but each
time it missed fire. At a third attempt the gun went off and the natives,
including the man in the water, fell flat on their faces. As they quickly made
off it was seen that this man went slowly as though he had been wounded. The
bay had to be examined and the leak had to be repaired; so Flinders says that
he was determined to create respect among these people, and therefore he
ordered two shots to be fired into the brush where natives were seen watching
the boat through the trees.</p>
<p>From this low and sandy point, which on account of what had occurred was
called Point Skirmish, the boat proceeded into the opening leading to the
Glasshouses. Unaware that this point was a part of an island Flinders named the
opening Pumice Stone River (it is now called Pumice Stone Strait) because of
the quantity of pumice stone strewn there, from which it was inferred that the
three Glasshouse Mountains were of volcanic origin. The boatmen could not get
far up the opening owing to the strong ebb tide, and Flinders landed on its
eastern side to view the country. Here five or six native huts twelve to
fifteen feet long were standing close together. In one was found a small and
very light shield; in another was an old net with a bag attached--the mesh
knotted after the manner of European seine-makers, and obviously it was a scoop
net, which was unknown on the south coast.</p>
<p>Among the large trees growing on Bribie Island was one different from any at
Port Jackson. Its leaves were dark and resembled those of a pine; its wood
smelt strongly of turpentine and it was red in the centre like an ironbark.
Blue gum, she-oak, and cherry-tree all grew at this place, as well as a tree
possessing the leaves of a gum, yet having the soft bark of the tea tree.</p>
<p>On returning to the ship Flinders found that the leak had been stopped and
he therefore decided to leave the examination of the Glasshouses until another
time and to proceed southwards and explore the southern shores of Moreton Bay.
At daylight on Wednesday, July 17th, the sloop got under weigh, and at half
past ten anchored at a mile and' a half from a point with red cliffs, which was
named Red Cliff Point. He says: "slightly to westward of it the latitude was
found to be 27&deg;16'25" S." This is the latitude of Woody Point. Flinders had
now reached the mainland shores of Queensland.</p>
<p>From Red Cliff Point he pulled over to a green headland (Woody Point) two
miles distant to westward; some small reefs lying off it resembled a miniature
barrier reef. In a native hut on the west side of the headland where he landed
he found a seine 14 fathoms long with meshes larger than any English seine and
the twine stronger, while at each end there was a pointed stick, three feet in
length (a net for catching dugong). Upon a shoal near the house were some weirs
set in a semicircle and made of sticks and branches so closely interwoven that
no fish could get through. Flinders brought the net away and left a hatchet in
its place. The remains of a stringy-bark canoe were lying close to the house,
and footprints of dogs, kangaroos, and emus were seen on the beach. Flinders
shot a curious hawk here of a dull red colour with a milk-white head, neck, and
breast. In the afternoon the "Norfolk" made further progress down the bay,
anchoring for the night over a muddy bottom. It is a pity for the sake of those
interested in the early history of Queensland that Flinders did not publish his
own story of the surveys he now made, for he was the first navigator to examine
Moreton Bay after Cook had placed its outer shores upon his chart. Governor
Hunter, however, delivered Flinders' journal to Colonel Collins to edit, and he
gives the following account of the explorations that were now carried out:</p>
<p>"On the following morning, July 18th, they got under weigh with a flood tide
and a moderate breeze from the northward. In their progress they passed two
islands of from 3 to 4 miles in circuit. The northernmost was the largest,
being nearly level with the water's edge. [This apparently was Mud Island.] The
foliage of the trees upon the southern island was equally dark and luxuriant,
but the interior part of it was higher. [St. Helena Island.] There were two
other smaller islands nearly on a level with the first, but the southernmost
was very small. [These appear to have been Green Island and King Islet
respectively; see chart, which will now best help to identify the discoveries.]
In passing between the two islands [Mud Island and St. Helena] they had deep
water, but on its suddenly shoaling they tacked and stood to the westward. In
this situation the entrance from Moreton Bay was open. To the south-east about
five miles distant was another island larger than any of the four islands above
mentioned. [Peel Island.]</p>
<p>"Reckoning the northernmost of the four islands to be the first in number
they made their course good for the third island [Green Island] and the water
deepened to six fathoms.[*]</p>

<h4>MORETON BAY, FROM FLINDERS' ATLAS, SHOWING HIS DISCOVERIES IN THE
"NORFOLK'S" VOYAGE</h4>
</center>
<p>As the "Norfolk" proceeded higher up the bay a number of natives with long
poles like those of the South Sea Islanders appeared to be advancing towards
her. It was thought that they were in their canoes and were coming to attack
the ship which was quickly prepared for defence. The supposed fleet however
turned out to be only a number of peaceable fishermen standing in a line upon a
mud flat surrounding the island and splashing the water with their long sticks
in order to drive the fish into their nets.</p>
<p>Some smaller islands[*] (now known as Fisherman Islands) concealed the
entrance to the Brisbane River, blocking Flinders' view so that he was not
aware that a river opened here into the bay. The flood tide having ceased, the
"Norfolk" anchored at noon in 27&deg;27&frac14;' S. in six fathoms. This
latitude confirmed his previous observations made on the 14th at Point Lookout.
The third island then bore south-west about one and a half to two miles, the
centres of the two northern islands north and north-west and the entrance to
Moreton Bay N. 77&deg; E.</p>
<blockquote>[* Dr. Lang says that Flinders named these islands Fisherman
Islands. Collins's account, however, and Flinders' chart make it appear that
the name Fisherman Islands was first bestowed upon Green Island and its
neighbours. For Collins states: "The third island on which the natives were,"
bore W. 4&deg; S. about one and a half to two miles from the "Norfolk's"
anchorage. The islands now called Fisherman Islands would bear N.W. from it,
and they are not placed on Flinders' chart.]</blockquote>
<p>From the "Norfolk's" anchorage the shores of Moreton Bay looked closed all
round excepting in the south-east, where there was a small opening. A sixth
island was seen in the passage to this opening, and as soon as the ebb tide had
slacked Flinders weighed and made sail, beating up to it against a south
wind.[*] The "Norfolk" passed close to the third island (Green Island), and on
standing round the south part of the shoal which seemed to surround it a native
was observed signalling to those on board, but being anxious to get up the bay
as far as possible while the tide was favourable, Flinders paid no attention to
him. To the east of the sixth island the deep water contracted to a narrow
channel, and a little before midnight the sloop was compelled to anchor
there.</p>
<blockquote>[* "Terra Australis," p. 197 and Collins, Vol. II, P,
240.]</blockquote>
<p>On the following day, July 19th, Flinders landed upon the sixth island
(Innes Island) with instruments to take angles and to observe the latitude. He
saw footprints of dogs and of men, those of the latter barely visible. There
were, however, native fire-places on the island and other signs that it had
lately been visited. "It was two or three miles in circumference...the west
side abundantly covered with mangroves." The trees, "among which was the new
pine, were large and luxuriant." The north-east and south-west sides were
chiefly low and sandy, and here again the nut-palm was growing. Boughs were
seen stuck in the ground and placed round native fire-places to keep off the
southerly winds. A black and white cockatoo, a beautiful lilac-headed parrot,
and the mocking-bird with a bald head (of Port Jackson) were the most
noticeable birds there.</p>
<p>Flinders writes at this time: "The latitude observed upon the sixth island
was 27&deg;35' S...Above this island [i.e. farther southward towards the
southern extremity of Moreton Bay] the east and west shores from being 9 or 10
miles apart, approach each other within two miles and the space between them
takes the form of a river [here he would be alluding to the space at the mouth
of the Logan River], but the entrance was too full of shoals to leave a hope of
penetrating by it <i>far into the interior</i>...Under this discouragement and
that of a foul wind all further research at the head of Glasshouse Bay was
given up."</p>
<p>These words show that although Flinders afterwards wrote in a general way,
"no river of importance intersects the east coast between the 24th and 39th
degree of South latitude," he had seen signs of an opening into the land. It
was left for Captain Logan, commandant at Brisbane, to discover the river which
bears his name. It is, however, only navigable for small vessels.</p>
<p>Next morning, on leaving the anchorage off Innes Island, Flinders sailed
northwards, again passing between St. Helena and Mud Islands and anchoring at
sunset within two miles of the entrance to Pumice Stone River.[*]</p>
<blockquote>[* Collins.]</blockquote>
<p>Early on July 21st he set out in his boat to explore the river and the
opening which later proved to be a strait, in order to find a spot where he
could lay his ship ashore. On approaching Point Skirmish he saw five or six
natives unarmed on the beach. The shoals in the stream were very intricate, but
he found a place large enough to admit the sloop.</p>
<p>At nearly the end of this boat excursion Flinders went on shore, choosing a
piece of dry sand "out of the reach of native spears" at about six miles from
Point Skirmish, where he shot some swans. Before the boat had reached the sand
at a higher part of the river a man with whom were women and children had
hailed Flinders from the west side calling "Woorah," "woorah." The boat was
backed near enough for a yarn stocking to be thrown at him, and to show him how
it might be worn as a cap, and Flinders and the blackfellow parted good
friends.</p>
<p>On the 22nd the "Norfolk" was brought into Pumice Stone River to be
repaired. The place chosen to lay the ship down was "on the east side[*] at a
small beach five miles above Point Skirmish, where the depth was 7 fathoms." On
this day Flinders seems to have seen dugong in the river, and it is strange he
had not met with them sooner as they were very numerous there in early days. He
describes "several animals that came to the surface to blow in the manner of a
seal," they did not spout nor had they any dorsal fin--their heads "resembling
the bluff nosed seal." He fired three musket balls into one and Boongaree
speared another, but they both sank. These animals, observes Flinders, might be
sea-lions. They are, however, better known as sea-cows.</p>
<blockquote>[* Introduction to "Terra Australis," p. 197.]</blockquote>
<p>On the 25th the "Norfolk" was ready for sea. Her cargo having been restowed
and her water completed, Flinders proceeded in her up Pumice Stone River for
two or three miles, intending to visit the Glasshouse Mountains, which, he
says, "had excited his curiosity." In the deepest parts of the river there were
four to six fathoms, but the channel was narrow and much divided. The "Norfolk"
was brought to an anchorage on the west side, at the place where Flinders had
been hailed by a blackfellow on the 21st. Here a fire was seen burning and
several women's voices were heard. Next morning Flinders went by boat "up a
small branch that pointed towards the peaks," but it was found to rejoin the
same stream and form two low mangrove islands the Glasshouses then being "on
the left hand."</p>
<p>Leaving the boat at 9.30 and taking Boongaree and two t seamen with him
Flinders set out on a north-west-by-west course, which brought them to a creek
with low muddy banks covered with mangroves. This creek they followed to the
southwest over swampy country towards its head, and as it became shallow they
waded over it. They then steered north-west, occasionally sighting the
Glasshouse mountain with sloping sides, and according to Flinders' description,
"a Stony Mount" towards which, as it was nearer, he turned, and after having
walked nine miles from the time he had left the boat he climbed to the top. The
ascent was difficult, and he was reminded of Mount Direction in Tasmania. The
trees on it were taller and straighter than were those passed on level
ground.</p>
<p>From the summit of this mount Flinders obtained an extensive view of the
southern shores of Moreton Bay and the neighbouring country. "The uppermost
part of the bay (i.e. the southernmost) appeared at S. 24&deg; E. and most
probably communicated with a line of water which was visible at S. 12&deg; E.,
where there were several distinct columns of smoke."[*] This last bearing, says
Collins, "Mr. Flinders apprehended to be near the head of the river he was not
Permitted to enter with the sloop from the intricacy of the channel and the
shortness of time which remained for his excursion." In this direction too he
must have seen the High Peak of his chart which was named later, Flinders
Peak.</p>
<blockquote>[* See Collins, Vol. II, P. 247. The "line of water" in the
south-east seen by Flinders from "Stony Mount" was most likely the Brisbane
River, and not the Logan which he had been unable to enter.]</blockquote>
<p>From Stony Mount the highest Glasshouse (Beerwah) bore four miles distant to
the north-west. Flinders also saw in the direction of the head of Pumice Stone
River a large sheet of water which seemed to divide into small branches; and
doubtless he then obtained a view of the waters of the channel which led from
the strait to the sea. There was a large smoke near the foot of the mountains
inland.</p>
<p>On continuing their journey, the sun being then below the trees, they
encamped for the night by a stream at about two-thirds of the distance between
the Stony Mount and the Glasshouse with the flat top. At seven the next
morning, July 27th, they arrived at the foot of this Glasshouse Mountain
(Canowrin); but owing to the steepness of its sides it was found impossible to
ascend it. Flinders found there no marks of volcanic eruption, and few traces
of men or animals were noticed at this stage of their tour.</p>
<p>Flinders now turned back and took a south-south-east course in order to get
clear of the head of the creek and the swamps; this course leading him inland,
he altered it, and after crossing a broad stream of fresh water walked three
miles back to the boat. Next morning, Sunday, the 28th, the "Norfolk" proceeded
down the river and anchored about a mile within its entrance, where she was
detained for two days.</p>
<p>At this time natives from both sides of Pumice Stone River visited the
parties on shore. Flinders now seems to have learned more about the natives
than ever before, which, he says, was due to the friendliness of "the gallant
and unsuspecting" Boongaree, who, finding their spears inferior to his own, not
only made them a present of a better one and a throwing stick, but showed them
how to use them. Afterwards they, in turn, were very friendly and sang songs
for the visitors in a most pleasing way. On observing that they were listened
to attentively they each selected a white man, and with much earnestness sang
in his ear as if trying to teach their song to him. Like the natives of
Endeavour River it was the custom for them to introduce strange natives to the
white men by their names. Flinders made them many presents. It was ascertained
that they fished almost altogether with cast and setting nets. Their spears
were of solid wood and they did not use the womerah. Their canoes, one of which
was closely examined, were of stringy-bark, the ends being tied up in a rather
clumsy fashion.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, 31st, Flinders sailed out of Moreton Bay, after having spent
fifteen days in exploring it. He then named the land on which Cape Moreton was
situated Moreton Island, "supposing that Cook would have called it so had he
known of its insularity." Steering northward along the coast he passed Wide Bay
on August 1st and Sandy Cape on the 2nd (placing it in lat. 24&deg;45' S.) and
entered Hervey Bay on the 6th. On the voyage he noticed in the water one of the
spotted sea-snakes with a flat tail such as Banks had seen off Hervey Bay and
like those he himself had seen when sailing through Torres Strait with Bligh in
H.M.S. "Providence." Flinders thought they were a similar kind to those Dampier
had observed on the North-West Coast.</p>
<p>Hervey Bay appeared to be deep and extensive. Flinders sailed round it and
did not find any rivers there; his time, however, was too limited to allow him
to examine it very thoroughly. He tried to take the sloop into one
opening--apparently about two miles wide--but it was full of shoals and he
could discover no channel into it. He anchored half a mile to the north-west of
a low islet rocky sandy spot in 25&deg;17' S.--lying in this opening. On the
islet were seen thousands of curlews, besides other birds, and he named it
Curlew Islet. A cluster of palms and a few small trees grew there and two or
three large trees--of a tough close-grained wood--lay upon the shore thrown
down by either wind or flood. Upon one of these was caught the cap of a whale's
skull and in one of the eye sockets a bird had built its nest. Natives visited
Curlew Islet, for their spears of solid wood--one being barbed with bone--were
picked up there and their fires were burning in different places around the
bay.</p>
<p>Flinders found that Hervey Bay was divided into an upper and lower bay; the
shores on the east side of the former being high and bounded by steep white
cliffs. He thought a channel would be discovered, for he "was unwilling to
believe that there was not a good passage even to the head of a sheet of water
6 or 7 miles square into which probably one or more streams emptied
themselves." He left Hervey Bay on August 7th. Owing to unfavourable winds the
"Norfolk" did not reach Port Jackson until the 20th.</p>
<h4>OXLEY IN THE "MERMAID"</h4>
<p>Twenty-four years passed away and no further survey of Moreton Bay took
place until 1823, when John Oxley was instructed by Sir Thomas Brisbane to
examine various harbours to the northward and to select one as the site for a
new penal settlement.</p>
<p>Oxley left Port Jackson in the "Mermaid," Charles Penson, master, on October
23rd, taking with him Lieutenant Stirling of the Buffs, Mr. Uniacke, and a
Sydney native named Bowen.</p>
<p>After touching at Port Macquarie the "Mermaid" met with a strong gale, from
which she sought shelter on the 31st at Cook Island off Point Danger. Before
coming there Oxley had sighted the mouth of a river to the northward, which he
afterwards named the Tweed. Next day he sent the master to inspect it while
Stirling and Uniacke landed on Cook Island. The island was thought to be of
volcanic origin, for the rocks of which it was composed were full of curious
holes; there were similar rocks upon a bluff headland on the main opposite, and
these were "only inferior in extent to the Giants Causeway"; the headland
to-day is known as Fingal Point. The surf beat upon Cook Island with terrific
force, driving the water up through the holes in the rocks with a deafening
noise.</p>
<p>On the north-west point Stirling and Uniacke saw a wreck and imagined that
the ship might have belonged to the expedition of La P&eacute;rouse, whose fate
was then still unknown. The larboard quarter, with part of the stern and
quarter deck, were all that remained of a vessel of about 300 tons. The oak
planks "were not yet totally destroyed," says Uniacke, who was of the opinion
that the wreck could not have been a recent one. Oxley closely examined it,
hoping to trace the ship's name, but without success. A piece of slate with
part of a name deeply scratched on it and part of a case of mathematical
instruments were all that could be found. Turtle were so numerous on the island
that Oxley was induced to call this island Turtle Island, a name, however, that
has not survived.</p>
<p>On his return the master reported that he had inspected the river which had
been sighted to northward, and that it had a bar entrance; a party therefore
crossed over to the mainland to explore it and found that it ran through "a
deep rich valley clothed with magnificent trees behind which rose Mount
Warning's singular peak." On the right bank of the stream, which was traced for
some distance, a native man with some women and children were seen whose only
defensive weapon was a stone hatchet. The man was curiously scarified all over
his body.</p>
<p>A favourable wind arose, and as Oxley wished to proceed to sea the further
survey of the Tweed River was postponed.</p>
<p>The "Mermaid" hoisted her sails and was preparing to weigh anchor when 200
natives armed with spears came to watch her go, evidently pleased at her
departure. On November 6th at noon Oxley reached Port Curtis. He immediately
went to sound the port while Stirling and Uniacke landed at Facing Island to
seek for fresh water, and found a small quantity. Later in the afternoon they
accompanied Oxley on an excursion. On quitting the ship with two boats and
sufficient provisions to last his party three days, he at first steered to
South Shore Head, six miles from the anchorage. Here the mangroves were
impenetrable and the boats were taken two miles beyond the Head to a sandy
beach, where the tents were pitched--the seamen building a comfortable hut for
themselves out of boat sails.</p>
<p>Oxley left a corporal and three men in charge of the camp, and crossed the
country in a south-south-east direction, when he met with two rivulets, a
larger and a smaller stream. Near the first he discovered a curious native
grave lying at the foot of a large tree. The bark had been torn from the trunk
upwards for about six feet and the wood was deeply engraved with rude symbols
resembling the footprints of kangaroos and emus. It was therefore supposed to
be "the grave of a great hunter."</p>
<p>The outward journey had been a difficult one, but the men having notched the
trees, their journey back to the camp was made easier. Oxley set out next day
with another party to look for the mouths of the two rivulets, and soon came to
a creek which, after he had traced it for six miles, led him to a spot where
there was fresh water, but in such small quantities that he considered the
place unsuitable for a settlement.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the master who had been carrying out explorations elsewhere had
discovered a fresh-water river to the southward. On hearing this piece of good
news Oxley decided to remain longer at Port Curtis. On the following day he
proceeded in his boat with some of his party twelve miles up the newly
discovered river and encamped on a bank forty feet above it. Teal, widgeon, and
numerous wild birds covered its surface, and Uniacke shot two swamp pheasants
(a black bird in shape like an English pheasant), a small dove unknown in
Sydney, and a new kind of owl--with a black head. The mosquitoes here were
unbearable, "their noise alone sufficient to banish sleep--their stings
extremely painful," so that the party spent a broken night and could get no
rest.</p>
<p>Next morning Oxley returned on board the "Mermaid." Before taking his
departure he ascended a hill and from it obtained a good view of the
surrounding country. He gave the name of the Boyne to the river.</p>
<p>The mate, who had been absent sounding the entrance, now announced that he
had found a harbour to the south-east. On the receipt of this information Oxley
decided to abandon the idea of visiting Port Bowen altogether and to
investigate the new harbour. On Saturday, November 15th, he therefore left Port
Curtis and made his way towards it. The inlet, to his disappointment, proved to
be Rodd's Bay, which had already been reported by Captain King. The "Mermaid"
left Rodd's Bay, where the sea was infested with sharks, on November 21st. She
experienced very tempestuous weather and did not reach Moreton Bay until
November 29, 1823, at 6 p.m., when she anchored 150 yards off the shore in the
exact place where twenty-four years previously Matthew Flinders had brought the
"Norfolk" to an anchorage.</p>
<h4>PAMPHLET, PARSONS, AND FINNEGAN</h4>
<p>The "Mermaid" had scarcely let go her anchor off Skirmish Point than a
number of natives were seen hurrying towards the beach. While they were still
some distance off Uniacke, who was watching them through his glass from the
masthead, noticed a man with a lighter skin than the rest and pointed him out
to Stirling and some others on board, consequently, when the blacks collected
there, Uniacke says, "we were all on the look out for him." To their surprise
on coming opposite the ship the man hailed them in English.</p>
<p>Oxley, Stirling, and Uniacke immediately went ashore, and on their landing
the blacks were overcome with delight and embraced the white man, for such he
proved to be, again and again, while he seemed nearly as wild as they, He was
perfectly naked and covered all over with red and white paint.</p>
<p>He told Oxley his story. His name was Thomas Pamphlet and he had left Sydney
in an open boat for Five Islands with three companions on March 21, 1823. They
had been driven out to sea and suffered inconceivable hardships, being
twenty-one days without water. One of them had lost his reason and perished. On
April 16th they had landed on Moreton Island, where their boat was stove in.
His two surviving companions, named Parsons and Finnegan, were absent, as only
six weeks before all three had started to walk to Sydney. He had knocked up
after walking fifty miles and returned to this tribe again. Finnegan, having
quarrelled with Parsons, had also returned, but was now absent at the south end
of Moreton Bay. Parsons had not since been heard of. The man grew so bewildered
as he tried to tell this story that little that he said could be understood.
Oxley distributed presents of knives and coloured handkerchiefs among his black
friends and took Pamphlet back with him on board the "Mermaid." Next day,
Pamphlet gave Mr. Oxley an account of his adventures, which, as he related it,
Mr. Uniacke wrote down, adding Finnegan's story to it when he joined the ship
on this day, Sunday, November 30th.</p>
<p>They stated that after landing at Moreton Island in a thoroughly exhausted
condition they found fresh water, which had saved their lives. While they
remained there they had met with natives, who treated them in a most humane
way. They left the island in a native canoe and took up their abode with this
tribe, whose principal dwelling-place was at Pumice Stone River. The blacks
proved true friends to the shipwrecked men, not only lending them nets with
which to provide themselves with fish but catching it for them and showing them
how to obtain dingowa or fern-root, which was very nutritious. (Parsons tells
us that a larger root was called bangwa). The three men quarrelled among
themselves; Parsons and Pamphlet were anxious to return to Sydney, while
Finnegan, remembering the terrors he had endured in his last voyage, was just
as anxious to remain at Moreton Bay.</p>
<p>After making vain attempts to get away, Parsons and Pamphlet determined to
build a canoe in which to put to sea. They chose a tree suitable for this
purpose and having felled it started to make the canoe. For nearly three weeks
they, worked from sunrise till sunset with no other tool than an axe saved from
the wreck. The natives watched them and took keen interest in their work. While
the men fashioned their craft they brought them food and left fish in their hut
every day. Finnegan declined either to undertake the voyage or to help the
other two build their boat. When they saw that he would not bear any share of
the toil, the natives frequently would take the axe away from the other two and
offer it to him. On Finnegan's persisting in his refusal to use it they no
longer would bring him food, and he was compelled to dig fern-root for himself.
To the delight of the two men and also of the natives at last the canoe was
finished. They insisted on launching it, and when they saw it afloat with
Parsons and Pamphlet in it their joy knew no bounds. They gave the two men a
store of fish for their use, and on the following afternoon watched Parsons and
Pamphlet set out on their voyage with the flood tide. Finnegan, who had been
firm in his resolve to remain behind, was then forced by the blacks into one of
their canoes, which quickly followed the other men, but not catching them up
Finnegan was put on a sandbank, where the natives left him. He would have been
drowned at high tide had not Parsons and Pamphlet, seeing his plight, turned
back and rescued him.</p>
<p>Following directions given them by the natives, the men steered to an island
at the bottom of Moreton Bay. Here they spent the night. After rounding the
island and laying in a supply of fern-root on the opposite side, they crossed
over to another part of the bay. A strong tide was running which made the
passage difficult, and they did not reach the shore until after dark. They
landed and next morning made their way to some high ground in order to view the
coast and saw another point at some distance to northward, but the land between
appeared to recede so deeply that they were afraid to venture across the wide
opening in their frail craft. They therefore drew their canoe high up on the
beach and started to walk round the bay. The shore was thickly lined with
mangroves, and they soon were forced to leave it and follow a native
footpath.</p>
<p>On the third day they arrived on the bank of a river at a spot that was
evidently used by the natives for a crossing place. The stream was too wide for
them to swim over it, and as the men could find no canoes there they determined
to follow the river's course until they reached a part where it could be
forded. They accordingly traversed the bank of the main stream for nearly a
month, their path being much impeded by a number of salt-water creeks which
joined the river, and as neither Parsons nor Finnegan could swim well enough to
attempt to cross them they were obliged to walk round them.</p>
<p>At length the men reached a creek on the opposite bank of which two canoes
were seen. Pamphlet swam over and brought one back to his companions. It was
very small and would only carry two people, so, he says, "I therefore took
Parsons over the main river first." He afterwards returned for Finnegan.</p>
<p>Then for the first time white men crossed the Brisbane River.</p>
<p>The brush on the opposite side was so thick and the country so rough that
the men could not travel over it with their bare feet. They therefore commenced
their return journey, and having found another canoe paddled down the stream
until they came to its mouth.</p>
<p>On the one hundred and first day after they had left Sydney, that is to say,
on or about June 30, 1823, they reached a point of land which they had
previously seen from Moreton Island, and again recognizing it knew that they
were back in Moreton Bay.</p>
<p>To return to Mr. Oxley. Hearing on Saturday from Pamphlet that Finnegan had
gone on an expedition to the bottom of the bay, he resolved to find him on the
Monday. Next day, however, a man was seen walking on a sandbank off the shore
opposite, who proved to be Finnegan, and he joined Pamphlet on board the
cutter.</p>
<p><i>THE BRISBANE RIVER</i></p>
<p>Both these men informed Mr. Oxley of the existence of the large river that
fell into the south end of Moreton Bay,[*] and on Monday, December 1st, Oxley
and Stirling, taking Finnegan with them in the whale-boat and providing
themselves with provisions for four days, set out from the anchorage to explore
the bay and the river. The first day's survey terminated a little above Red
Cliff Point. Writing of this day's progress Uniacke says: "Mr. Oxley told us
that after losing the first day in the examination of a large creek which
Finnegan mistook for the river they had on the following day entered the river
itself by an entrance three miles wide."[**]</p>
<blockquote>[* Pamphlet in his narrative makes it certain that it was the
Brisbane River these men had crossed, for he says: "Mr. Oxley and Mr. Stirling
set out the following morning, taking Finnegan to examine the river we had been
so long in attempting to cross."]</blockquote>
<blockquote>[** "Field's Geographical Memoirs," P. 82.</blockquote>
<p>Oxley thus describes his coming to the Brisbane River: "Early on the second
day (2nd of December, 1823) we had the satisfaction to find the tide sweeping
us up a considerable opening between the First Islands and the mainland. The
muddiness of the water and the fresh-water mollusca convinced us we were
entering a large river; and a few hours ended our anxiety by the water becoming
perfectly fresh while no diminution had taken place in the size of the stream
after passing what I called 'Sea Reach.'...At sunset we had proceeded about
twenty miles up the river. Up to this point it was navigable for ships not
drawing more than 16 feet of water."</p>
<p>Oxley thought the scenery peculiarly beautiful, the country hilly and level,
the soil brushwood on which grew timber of great magnitude. He then noticed a
pine (doubtless the tree mentioned by Cunningham and called after him), and he
writes: "A magnificent species of pine was in great abundance...and to the
south-east a little distance from the river were several brushes...of
<i>Cupressus australis</i> of a very large size." On the following day Oxley
continued his boat voyage for another thirty miles, the river keeping its depth
and width excepting in one place, where a rocky ridge crossed it. From these
sunken rocks to a place called Termination Hill the stream maintained its size.
The day was very hot and the boatmen exhausted after their long pull, so Oxley
determined to end his journey there, being then "70 miles from the vessel and
our stock of provisions expended."</p>
<p>He landed on the south bank of the river and ascended a low hill about 250
feet[*] above its level. (He named it Termination Hill.) From it he obtained a
better view of the river's course, being able to trace the stream for thirty or
forty miles, and seeing a distant mountain ("which I conjecture to be the High
Peak of Flinders") bearing south 1&frac12; east distant from twenty-five to
thirty miles.[**]</p>
<blockquote>[* According to Oxley's report.]</blockquote>
<blockquote>[** There was evidently an error in Oxley's chart, as upon it
Termination Hill was placed within six miles of the Peak. Captain King remarks
"the mountain must be some part of the range north-west of Mount
Warning."]</blockquote>
<p>The place of Oxley's turning on this boat voyage has been a much discussed
point, and it is said that it is impossible to determine the exact spot where
the voyage ended either from Oxley's own report dated January 10, 1824, or from
Stirling's chart of the part traversed. The chart published with the report
shows that the point where Oxley turned back was slightly beyond Termination
Hill, and he himself says that he was then seventy miles <i>from the ship</i>.
(Cunningham, who went with him on his second excursion up the river, states
that "the extreme-point of the former party's penetration was about sixty miles
<i>from the sea</i>," and that on again reaching that point Mr. Oxley
"instantly recognized the clear grassy bank on which he had then
encamped.")[*]</p>
<blockquote>[* To Telfair.]</blockquote>
<p>Oxley returned down the river with the ebb tide and spent the night at the
base of the Green Hills, the highest of which was ascended next morning, when
he obtained an extensive view. The high range of Mount Warning appeared to lose
itself westward, and with the exception of the peak before mentioned (which was
the termination of the north end of that range) there was scarcely a hill to be
seen. So much time was spent in examining the country above Sea Reach that it
was dark before the boat reached the river's entrance, where Oxley again
encamped. He named the stream the Brisbane River in honour of Sir Thomas
Brisbane. The whole of the following day was spent in sounding the entrance and
surveying the country in the vicinity of Red Cliff Point, and it was late on
the night of December 5th before the party got back to the "Mermaid." In this
voyage Oxley discovered that Point Lookout was on an island and that the bay
extended as far south as 28&deg;. In five or six days the cutter got under
weigh and set sail for Sydney. Before he sailed Mr. Oxley left a memorandum in
a bottle near the wooding place on Bribie Island for Parsons telling him that
he had called there and had taken his companions away.</p>
<h4>CUNNINGHAM's FIRST JOURNEY IN QUEENSLAND</h4>
<p>When the "Amity" arrived at Moreton Bay on September 11, 1824, it was
Oxley's intention to establish his colony on some of the islands at the head of
the bay. None of these proving suitable he afterwards fixed upon Red Cliff
Point as the site for his settlement, because "water was found convenient to
the beach and the timber was tall and straight."</p>
<p>Oxley's first thought, however, on returning for the second time to Moreton
Bay was for Parsons, the shipwrecked man who since the day of his parting with
Finnegan "had not been heard of." In an old field notebook of Oxley's[*] an
entry in his handwriting dated September 16, 1824, shows that he lost no time
in making inquiries about him. The entry runs: "After dinner the whale-boat was
lowered and I proceeded in her to our old station on Pumice Stone River for the
purpose of seeing if the bottle left near the wooding place had been removed.
It had been left for informing Mr. Parsons that a vessel had been here during
his absence...[This bottle had been carried away by blacks for a distance of
fifty miles, but eventually reached Parsons safely.] I confess I was by no
means sanguine that he had survived. It will be recollected that he...proceeded
singly towards the north...near twelve months ago, and considering the nature
of the population and the privations he must necessarily suffer...the chances
were that he no longer existed. It was therefore with feelings of the most
pleasing description that among the group on the beach at landing the first man
was recognized as our long lost countryman."</p>
<blockquote>[* Surveyor-General's Office, Sydney.]</blockquote>
<p>Of the three shipwrecked men Parsons had travelled farthest. After parting
from Finnegan he had continued to trace the coast northward on his supposed
route to Sydney, only detecting his error when the heat became gradually more
intense and overpowering. He then guessed that he was far to the northward of
Sydney. At this time he really was on his road to Hervey Bay. In his progress
he met with many different tribes, who at first avoided him, but he says when
he could not "entice" them to him he would if possible get hold of one of their
children and caress it; he adds: "This stratagem usually succeeded and they
would then offer fish and be friendly." None of the women were allowed to bring
him food. The men gave it to him themselves. This jealous feeling with regard
to their females pervaded the whole of the tribes he met with "in a greater or
lesser degree." Often he suffered terribly from hunger and sometimes was three
or four nights without food. Water he generally was able to obtain by bearing
three or four miles to westward. He fared better on his homeward journey
through being acquainted with the blacks. He had had no clothing for fourteen
months.</p>
<p>The country was covered with thick scrub and vines; the land was sandy and
poor. For months he saw no rain. His only method of telling the time was by
watching for the new moon and cutting a notch in a stick. The trees that he saw
were pine, ironbark, swamp oak and spotted gum. The best timber grew on a river
to the northward, and currajong was abundant in the interior. Parsons was three
months on this outward journey to Hervey Bay, where he found the natives
unfriendly, and he took four or five months to make his way back to Moreton
Bay. When still sixty miles from there he sought the hospitality of a tribe of
blacks who were loath to let him leave them. Only by watching his opportunity
and stealing off by moonlight was he able to effect his escape.</p>
<p>The foundations of the settlement at Red Cliff Point were now laid and
building operations were begun. In after years when the settlement was moved to
a more convenient spot on the banks of the Brisbane River, the deserted
buildings were handed over to the natives, and by them called Humpy Bong, which
in their dialect signifies "Dead Houses."</p>
<p>When Oxley had fulfilled his instructions with regard to the settlement, he
started to carry out his further exploration of the river. Cunningham tells us:
"No sooner had we landed the commandant and those connected with his command
and marked off the lines for the little township than Mr. Oxley fitted out two
boats to explore the River Brisbane farther towards its origin than the part at
which a former party under the direction of our laborious and intelligent
Surveyor-General had penetrated last year."</p>
<p>In this second survey of the Brisbane River in the month of September, 1824,
Oxley was accompanied by a party which included Allan Cunningham and Lieutenant
Butler of the 40th Regiment. The botanist has given the following account of
the tour."The mouth of the stream which is two miles wide at its entrance is
characterized by low mangrove shores with a narrow deep water channel on its
south shore. Its reaches soon become picturesque and interesting...the banks
being higher, densely clothed with evergreen vegetation and overhung by twines
of <i>Bignonia</i>, <i>Clematis</i>, <i>Ipomoea</i>, and a new <i>Dolichos</i>
which I have called <i>D. hymenocarpus</i>. The breadth of the stream
decreasing adds not a little to the beauties of the water, whose depths of 5,
8, and 9 fathoms render it important from a commercial point of view, being
thus navigable for vessels Of 200 tons sixty miles from the sea, that distance
being about the extreme point of the former party's penetration...</p>
<p>"We now began a continuance of the survey of the river upwards from the
point where the examination of last year had closed and which Mr. Oxley, on
again reaching it, instantly recognized by a clear grassy bank on which he had
then encamped.[*] The banks hitherto densely clothed with a matted jungle of
twining and scandent plants at length are clear of brushwood, thinly timbered
and showing us the upper or "puniary" banks which define the verge of the
...forest land on either side. The stream narrows to 800 yards and then to 500
and a surface covered with aquatic plants that usually inhabit still or
stagnant water showed us...that no freshes or floods had taken place for many
months. Notwithstanding a breadth of 500 yards, the circumstance of our boats
having taken ground off several of the levels of the river (as well as in
mid-channel in the succeeding reaches) after having ascended the river about
ten miles of the new survey, induced the apprehension that its origin would
prove to be not very far in the western interior.[**]</p>
<blockquote>[* To Telfair.]</blockquote>
<blockquote>[** In the course of Oxley's voyage up the river he saw "a large
creek entering the river," and called it Bremer's Creek, this being the Bremer
River. Oxley encamped at its mouth, and the site of his tent is given on the
chart of that river (p. 608).]</blockquote>
<p>"A few miles further confirmed our suspicions. Extensive beds of alluvial
gravel occupied its entire channel putting a stop to the progress of our
boats--a few inches in depth of water occupying a small portion in the centre.
Mr. Oxley, however, with his accustomed perseverance encouraged the boatmen who
in a few hours actually dragged the boats over this barrier into a depth of
about 12 feet water which continued along a short reach where we were again
stopped by rocks in fast and fallen timber entirely choking up the very
contracted channel...the river in period of flood had cut itself another
channel a quarter of a mile wide the limits of which were marked by the gravel
deposited there. These beds of gravel were of a compound character for besides
the rounded pebbles or masses of rock there were torrent-worn fragments of whin
of which we had noticed none in the country around.</p>
<p>"Finding it was perfectly useless to attempt to carry our boats beyond this
second bank and seeing in our examination on foot a further series of
impediment...we regularly encamped and planned a tour on foot to a high mount
distant about ten miles about west, from us in the presumed direction from
which the river proceeded, from which elevation we hoped to gather such facts
as would enable us to determine whether or not this river is an inland or
Western stream communicating with the internal marshes."</p>

<h4>CUNNINGHAM'S SHETCH OF RED CLIFFBEACH,BRISBANE RIVER, WHICH HE HAD VISITED
WITH OXLEY IN 1824 AND FOR THE SECOND TIME (AFTER OXLEY'S DEATH) IN 1828</h4>
</center>
<p>Oxley ended this boat voyage at a spot where the actual bed of the river
measured "one-fourth of a mile in width and the old flood marks on the trees
ranged between 30 and 40 feet in height. This spot is said to have been
fourteen miles beyond the termination of his former survey. He and Cunningham
then made their way to the "high mount" beyond this point and obtained from its
summit a fine view extending over the country known to-day as the West Moreton
district and reaching to the Albert River. They saw a line of native fires
marking the river's course and wreaths of smoke rising against the dark
background of the Macpherson Range.</p>
<p>Cunningham gives the following description of this journey:</p>
<p>"The country...we found very hilly and broken obliging us to preserve our
position on the main ridges winding with them...Thus although we made a
circuitous route we avoided the labour of descending and again ascending deep
cavities and some sharp ravines. About an hour before sunset we reached the
mount which Mr. Oxley had proposed should be our extreme point of penetration.
It was a part of the day best suited for our observation. We therefore (Oxley
and myself, our servants being sent below to make a fire) set ourselves down on
the pinnacle and made the following remarks: You will perceive, (by a reference
to Flinders' Chart) to the southward of Moreton Bay there is a lofty collection
of hills on the coast of which the highest is named Mount Warning Ranges. From
these elevations lateral ranges extend far westerly assuming...an abrupt and
formidable aspect. To the northward of our position are also ranges of
magnitude...these however together with the Mount Warning Ranges were observed
to lower and to soften down in a level flat country bearing from us to the
westward from which this river running at the foot of the mount on which we
stood was traced proceeding. The setting sun throwing over the western country
a vast diffusion of light showed us that so far from there being a dividing
range of waters, there was not even a hill in the distance west of us to
prevent one common communication taking place between...the western waters and
those flowing upon our coasts, but as we were at least 300 miles from that part
of the Macquarie ... at which Mr. Oxley stood eastward for the coast in 1818
and the present contracted channel of the Brisbane--a part filled up by sand
shelves and beds of gravel--inducing us to conclude its origin is far within
100 miles we cannot reconcile ourselves to the opinion that they unite without
supposing an area...between the meridians of 151&deg; and 147&deg; to be one
immense marsh."</p>
<p>Oxley and Cunningham at this point seem to have reached different
conclusions as to the termination of the Brisbane's course for Cunningham
continues: "I would have wished to have marched another day's journey westward
to have set our little differences of opinion at rest; the state, however, of
my friend Oxley's health would not allow this. We therefore returned to our
encampment, struck our tents and with dispatch returned to the Bay, my friend
being satisfied that the great problem of how the internal waters are disposed
(from which it has been presumed this river would prove to be an eastern
outlet) still remains to be solved...and the origin of the Brisbane is yet to
be discovered."</p>
<p>A species of fresh-water fish found only in Western rivers was caught in the
Brisbane, and this circumstance again led Oxley to suspect that its waters
might communicate with Western channels.</p>
<p>Writing of the plants here Cunningham remarks: "Of the flora of this
part...the greater portion is equinoctial or of plants hitherto limited to
tropical regions...such as we observed during our voyage on the north-east and
north coasts." And he adds: "If the valuable tropical produce of other
countries such as coffee, cotton, and sugar cane can be cultivated upon any
shore of our continent, we need not advance farther from the northern coast of
Moreton Bay in search of a suitable spot, seeing that the indigenous vegetation
of its shores is identical with that of the parallels of 19&deg;, 15&deg;
12&deg; and 10&deg;30'."</p>
<p>It was then that for the first time in the dense forests on the banks of the
Brisbane Cunningham discovered the pine known by his name, a new species of
<i>Araucaria</i> (<i>A. Cunninghamii</i>, Sweet), and noted the species as
distinct from the Norfolk Island tree. This tree grew less profusely on the
river nearer Moreton Bay, and since it was thought its timber would be useful
as spars for ships a few trees were cut down and brought back to Sydney in the
"Amity" for the dockyard.</p>
<p>Oxley seldom visited Moreton Bay after he had completed this voyage. A few
years later he was unable to undertake any kind of exploration, for sickness
and infirmity laid hold of him and he could no longer endure the fatigue of
covering great distances on land or the continuous strain of surveying at sea.
The expeditions under his able leadership which had brought back to Sydney so
much knowledge of the country inland and of the harbours on the coast therefore
soon ceased. But Oxley will never be forgotten, for his work has won for him a
lasting memorial in the history of Australian discovery.</p>
<h4>CUNNINGHAM GOES THROUGH PANDORA'S PASS</h4>
<p>Cunningham returned to Port Jackson on October 14, 1824, and soon we find
him planning and making preparations for another expedition to the
northward--the direction in which so many of his discoveries were made. When he
had reached Pandora's Pass in 1823, the reduced state of his provisions would
not permit him to push beyond the pass or even to examine it. He now determined
to approach the mountain-gap from another direction and go through it to the
Liverpool Plains; and this journey he accomplished to as far as 30&deg;47'
S.[*]</p>
<blockquote>[* The account of this journey is extracted from an old issue of
"The Australian" (dated July 21, 1825), and it seems as though the article, if
not written by Cunningham himself, must have been inspired by
him.]</blockquote>
<p>He set out from Richmond with a small party, crossed the Nepean on March 28,
1825, and made his way northwards towards the Wollombi along a rugged and
dangerous track previously taken by Mr. Howe. In 100 miles he fell in with the
Hunter River near Patrick's Plains (Whittingham.), and advanced up its stream
for about forty miles, when, its channel taking a bend to the eastward, he
decided to leave it. He proceeded as far as Mount Dangar, a singularly rounded
hill in lat. 32&deg;18'51" S. and long. (reduced from the meridian of Richmond)
about 150&deg;27'30" E., whose summit formed a striking feature in the
landscape.</p>
<center>
<p><a name="a0301141h-30" id="a0301141h-30"></a><img alt="" src="0301141h-images/0301141h-30.jpg"></p>
<h4>CUNNINGHAM'S ROUTE IN 1825</h4>
</center>
<p>From Mount Dangar, Cunningham took a fresh departure: first travelling
north-west and then due west, he passed over tracts of sheep pasture which were
bounded by hills connected with the Liverpool Range.</p>
<p>On April 25th, about the parallel Of 32&deg; S., he reached Smith's Rivulet,
and in advancing westward began to identify from an opposite position from
which he previously had viewed them the principal landmarks seen by him in 1823
after he had first left the Goulburn. Thus he was able to verify his own
earlier observations.</p>
<p>Continuing his route westward in the parallel Of 32&deg; S ., he crossed the
streams he had already seen, among them Scott's Rivulet, the Wemyss, and the
Goulburn Rivers, and passed over a small lateral range. This separates the
Hunter River streams from the waters that fall into the Macquarie, particularly
those of its tributary, the Erskine. He next turned north-west, crossed
Duguid's Plain, and, rounding the fringe of mountain to the northward of it,
passed over alternate plain and forest ridge on his way to Hawkesbury Vale. At
the entrance to the Vale he crossed his former line of route when he made his
way back to Bathurst from the pass in 1823.</p>
<p>On May 2nd Cunningham went through Pandora's Pass and descended with his
pack-horses into the south-western corner of Liverpool Plains. From the level
of Hawkesbury Vale the rise of the acclivity on the southern side through the
open forest to the pitch of the pass--about two miles distant--was found
singularly gradual. The northern decline was steeper, and measured not more
than one mile from the range to the grazing forest at the foot of it, but
proved "very practicable."</p>
<p>The entire length of Pandora's Pass from the head of Hawkesbury Vale to the
bank of Bowen's Rivulet[*] on the northern side of the Liverpool Range did not
exceed three miles, and it was Cunningham's opinion that only two or three
weeks of labour well spent would be required in constructing a few small
bridges over the narrow but deep channels to enable the team of the grazier to
pass northwards to the extensive open country. He continued to penetrate
farther to the northward, passed along the banks of Bowen River between two
high peaks of the Vansittart Hills (Ker's Peak and Mount Hoddle), and, crossing
the York River, reached the northern portion of Camden Valley at Dunlop Hill,
where he encamped on May 15th, and where he decided to end his journey.[**]
Camden Valley, which he says may be considered the north-west branch of the
Liverpool Plains, was found throughout the last stage of the journey northerly
towards Hardwicke's Range to be "a perfect quagmire," the plants growing there
being of species found only in marshy soil.</p>
<blockquote>[* Bowen River.]</blockquote>
<blockquote>[** At Boonatta.]</blockquote>
<p>It will be remembered that Oxley had entered Liverpool Plains from the
north-west; Cunningham came into them from the south-west and found them
elongated strips of country varying in breadth from five to ten or more miles
and lying between the meridians of 150&deg; and 150&deg;50' E. and within the
parallels 30&deg;45' S, and 31&deg;30' S. With the exception of a few
straggling trees of <i>Acacia pendula</i>, or weeping wattle, and <i>Eucalyptus
mannifera</i>, or white gum, scattered singly at long distances upon them, they
formed one uninterrupted patch of level plain from south to north exceeding
fifty miles in extent. Another portion, crossing them from west-north-west to
east-south-east, could not have been estimated at less than fifty or, probably,
sixty miles.</p>
<p>From these two principal branches other strips of country stretched north
and south, of which the valleys of Camden and Barrow ran in the former
direction; and Cunningham describes thus the isolated broken mountains which
are dotted over them: "The ridges and rounded mounts that interrupt the plane
of the country appeared to be perfectly isolated and took the form of various
figures of picturesque appearance on the common level of the plains, whose
entire arc will comprehend one million and a half acres, of which four-fifths
are rich grazing land for cattle, while many dry situations (more especially
along the southern side of the plains) will afford healthful, sound walks for
sheep." Bowen River, or Bowen's Rivulet, a brisk stream rising in the Main
Range, flowed through the west side of the plains, and, after a course of fifty
miles, united with the York River, and, bending with the dip of the country at
north-north-west, made its exit at that point down an extensive slope.</p>
<p>"We know of no tract of timberless open country in New South Wales that
forms so perfect a level," writes Cunningham, doubtless proud of the part he
had played in helping to bring these pastures within the reach of civilization.
" The natural consequence is that ordinary rains falling on the southern
mountains cause an overflow at Bowen's Rivulet, and, as the surface of some
parts was observed to be lower than the outer banks of this stream, a great
portion of the N.W. plain, the whole of Camden Valley, together with the
boundary forests on the same level, are laid under water; of which fact the
wrecks of floods on the outer banks of the rivulet, the little pools in the
cavities, the clodded nature of the soil, and the rottenness of the forest
trees afforded ample proof."</p>
<p>From the appearance of the ground Cunningham thought that the last
considerable inundation had been as recently as the months of January or
February, 1825,[*] since in some places on the north side of the plains a depth
of twelve inches of water still rested on the muddy surface which, he says,
"determined the limit of my journey to the northward."</p>
<blockquote>[* See also Hooker's "Journal of Botany," Vols, III and
IV.]</blockquote>
<p>Among the indigenous vegetation of the land traversed, the following plants
were noticed: a species of <i>Plantago</i>, or rib-grass; <i>Scorzonera
sp.</i>, or viper's grass; <i>Lotus</i>, or birdsfoot trefoil; <i>Centaurea
occidentalis</i>; <i>Ajuga australis</i>, or bugle; <i>Campanula gracilis</i>,
or bell-flower; <i>Rumex dumosus</i>, or dock; <i>Galium aparine</i>, or
goose-grass; <i>Epilobium</i>, or willow-herb. There were no fewer than eight
distinct grasses, among which a late <i>Danthonia gigantea</i> (giant oatgrass,
resembling wheat in the ear) was most remarkable. <i>Ranunculus lappaceus</i>,
<i>Lobelia inundata</i>, <i>Arundo phragmites</i>, and <i>Indigofera sp.</i>, a
proof of a permanent marsh-were also observed.</p>
<p>The soil was found to be a rich loam; the timber trees were stately
stringy-bark, box, and some white gum, while the lower forests on the western
outskirts of the plains were composed of iron-bark and a species of
<i>Callitris</i> or cypress.</p>
<p>On his homeward journey Cunningham followed his outward track back to
Pandora's Pass; but, after passing through it and leaving the Hawkesbury Vale,
he made his way to Talbragar, spending the night of May 28th at Mr. Lawson's
station. Continuing his journey, he crossed the southern tributary of the
Erskine at its widest part, and travelling in a south-easterly direction to the
Cudgegong, crossed Emu Creek, and on June 1st visited the new settlement that
had been founded at Mudgee. Thence he traced the Cudgegong, proceeding down its
south bank, until it bent eastward, when he left it, and, pursuing a
south-westerly course over the Turon River, made his way to Bathurst, where he
arrived on June 7, 1825.</p>
<p>The last three months of 1825 were spent in the vicinity of Wellington
Valley, then a growing settlement that had been first founded in 1823. From
here he botanized in a circuit of 150 miles on each bank of the Macquarie
River, during one excursion visiting Croker's Range, where he obtained a large
collection of seeds and tuberous roots, including twenty-five species of
orchids, for shipment to Kew Gardens. From a note on Arrowsmith's map
accompanying "Sturt's Expeditions," he seems to have journeyed to Mudgee again
before he returned to Parramatta.</p>
<p>Writing of the natives seen in this tour, Cunningham remarks: It is curious
that I should have met with only one small group of native women and children
and seven males who were prowling about in quest of the scanty subsistence in
grubs and kangaroos or opossums afforded by the surrounding country and from
the boundary heights only perceived two distinct smokes of the fires of the
aborigines."</p>
<p>Cunningham made a sketch of the map he had drawn during his expedition to
Dunlop Hill.[*] This sketch, which he sent to Doctor Hooker at Glasgow, is now
preserved among Hooker's correspondence at the Kew Herbarium. A reproduction of
it is given at page 540.</p>

<h3>THE NORTHERN JOURNEY</h3>
<p><b>(From Cunningham's Report to General Darling)</b></p>
<h4>DISCOVERY OF THE GWYDIR, MACINTYRE, DUMARESQ AND CONDAMINE RIVERS AND THE
DARLING DOWNS. CUNNINGHAM'S GAP SIGHTED</h4>
<p>Cunningham was occupied with botanical researches in New Zealand for the
greater part of 1826. He returned to New South Wales on January 20, 1827,
bringing with him a valuable collection of New Zealand flora.</p>

<h4>CUNNINGHAM'S ROUTE MAP SHOWING HIS JOURNEY TO DUNLOP HILL AND HIS
EXPLORATIONS IN QUEENSLAND</h4>
</center>
<p>On landing in Sydney he learned that it was General Darling's[*] intention
to send an expedition northward to explore what is now Queensland, since he
wished to find out whether the inland country, as yet undiscovered, would prove
suitable for settlers.</p>
<blockquote>[* General Darling had now replaced Sir Thomas
Brisbane.]</blockquote>
<p>The new undertaking evidently attracted Cunningham, for he offered his
services to the Governor, stating that he would be pleased to act as leader of
the expedition. As he had shown that he was very capable and had drawn up his
previous reports accurately and scientifically, his offer was accepted, and
once more he made preparations for a long journey.</p>
<p>It was a journey that became the crowning point of Cunningham's labours. To
the exploration of inland territory which he had already made north of Bathurst
in 1822, north of the Cudgegong in 1823, and northerly again from Pandora's
Pass in 1825, he now added a larger tract still farther northward, where, in
his passage through it, he found the Gwydir, Macintyre, Dumaresq, and Condamine
Rivers, and, besides fertile valleys and rugged mountain ranges, those rich
pastures of which Queensland is so proud to-day--the Darling Downs.</p>
<p>Before he turned again southward he had sighted the opening in the Great
Dividing Range, called after him Cunningham's Gap, which led to the sea and
provided a way of communication from the interior to the coast districts of
Moreton Bay. In making these great discoveries Allan Cunningham reached the
zenith of his career as an explorer.</p>
<p>Before he left Sydney he planned the details of this difficult journey and
submitted a sketch of his intended route to His Excellency. In sending this to
Governor Darling, Cunningham informed him that he proposed to begin his journey
from 31&deg; S., where Oxley had terminated his survey in 1818; thence to
proceed to Peel's River (also discovered by Oxley) at the northeast of
Liverpool Plains, and afterwards to travel to Moreton Bay on a line west of the
meridian of 151&deg;, and, upon reaching the northern point, to turn westward
inland in order to ascertain the extent of the marshes which he then believed
swallowed up all the western rivers. He added that should his supply of
provisions not allow him to go westward he would explore the high levels
eastward of 151&deg;, and, proceeding southward to the parallel Of 31&deg;,
make his way home through them.</p>
<p>These plans were approved, and an equipment of six men and eleven horses was
prepared for Cunningham, who took with him a sextant, a Schmalkalder's pocket
compass, a pocket chronometer, an odometer or perambulator, and a barometer
which had been compared with Dr. Mitchell's before he left Sydney. The horses
and men were sent overland to Hunter's River, but Cunningham himself proceeded
with the baggage and provisions to Newcastle by sea, whence they were conveyed
to Segenhoe,[*] the residence of Mr. Potter Macqueen, eleven miles south of
Scone by boat and drays. Owing to the swollen state of the Hawkesbury,
Cunningham did not meet his party at Mr. Glennie's Farm until April 22nd; on
leaving there with his men he travelled to Segenhoe, where he arrived on the
26th. He had determined to cross the mountains at the head of Dartbrook
Creek[**] where they had already been crossed by Mr. Macintyre, who kindly
offered to accompany the explorers to the summit of the Liverpool (or Dividing)
Range.</p>
<blockquote>[* Cunningham writes: "As the various operations of my expedition
commenced from this farm it was of the utmost value to me that its position on
the chart should be ascertained with tolerable precision." He gives the
situation of his encampment as being in 32&deg;6'37" S. and 150&deg;'57'15" E.
Var. of needle 7&deg;24' E. and elevation above the sea 598 feet.]</blockquote>
<blockquote>[** According to Mr. Dangar's map there were then two passes used
to cross the Liverpool Range, one at the head of Dartbrook, the other at the
head of Page's River--the latter being the easier. Dartbrook was so named
because in 1824, when two officials from the Surveyor-General's Department were
surveying it, they were attacked by blacks who wounded one of the white men
with a spear or dart.]</blockquote>
<p>On April 30, 1827, Cunningham took his departure from Segenhoe, and, after
journeying to Kingdon Ponds, passed over Tullong (or Holdsworthy) Downs. On
reaching Dartbrook Creek, he continued his way northwards along its right bank
for three and a half miles, halting for the day at a patch of apple-tree flat
eighty feet above Segenhoe. Next morning, keeping in the same direction up the
right bank of Dartbrook, he descended a grassy valley, and, having accomplished
thirteen miles, encamped near its head. This valley was bounded on the north
and north-east by a range connected with the Liverpool Range.</p>
<p>Here on May 2nd, Mr. Macintyre and a friend who were to act as guides joined
the explorers, and the ascent of the range was begun. Quitting the brook after
three miles, Mr. Macintyre led the way in a north-westerly direction to the
Range. As they advanced the party rested their horses upon tolerably level
spots of grass on the steep hillside. Gradually continuing the ascent they
gained a narrow spine of the ridge (bounded on each side by ravines), which
became so steep that the loads had to be taken off the pack-horses and carried
over on men's shoulders. On this night (May 2nd) they encamped 2,800 feet[*]
above the sea and obtained water in one of the ravines.</p>
<blockquote>[* Cunningham writes to Telfair that he crossed at 2,900 feet above
the sea...to the east of <i>my</i> 'Oxley's Peak.'"]</blockquote>
<p>Next morning Cunningham saw that they had climbed almost to the summit.[*]
While he was still engaged in making observations at the camp Mr. Macintyre and
his companion directed some of his men with their horses safely over the
mountains, leaving them in a valley on the north side of the Liverpool Range,
where there were both grass and water, and from which they easily could descend
the slopes to the plains. Here the men pitched the tent and awaited the rest of
the party.</p>
<blockquote>[* Of the Liverpool or Great Dividing Range.]</blockquote>
<p>On returning to the camp, Mr. Macintyre and his friend said good-bye to
Cunningham after having rendered him very helpful service, and on the following
morning he struck his tent and with his remaining pack-horses advanced
north-westward to the highest point of the range, 3,080 feet above the sea.</p>
<p>Owing to the height of the trees and the density of bush only a restricted
view was obtained, but to the north-west the Liverpool Plains could be seen
stretching to the horizon. From where they looked down at them the men thought
that these rolling grass plains resembled the ocean, and that the detached
mounds and isolated ridges with which they were studded were like groups of
islands.</p>
<p>The mountain top was strewn with fragments of rock and fallen timber, which
made the descent a difficult one for two miles; then a lateral ridge dipping
towards the north enabled Cunningham to reach the head of a gully on the north
side of the range which led to the narrow valley watered by a small creek where
the tent had been pitched and some of his men and horses were resting. This
encampment (at the northern base of the Dividing Range) was found to be in lat.
31&deg;50' S., and long., deduced from the meridian of Segenhoe, 150&deg;35' E.
"It was," he writes, "by barometrical computation 1,859 feet above the sea,
1,222 feet lower than the summit of the range, but 670 feet above the spot
where I had encamped on Dartbrook at the southern foot of the mountains."</p>
<p>Starting forward again on May 5th, on a course to the north-north-east
Cunningham and his companions proceeded up the valley along the banks of the
creek which flowed through it and originated at its head. At the end of five
miles, the creek turned to the north-west, where they left it and continued on
a course east of north with a view to pursuing a direct route to the point at
which Oxley had reached Peel's River in 1818. For seven miles they travelled
through open bush composed of box and iron-bark, crossing shallow water-courses
(the channels of some entirely dry) which wound through "poor and hungry" land.
"In the midst of those desert woods that skirt Liverpool Plains on the
south-eastern side, a meridional altitude of the sun gave for the lat.
31&deg;43'36" S.," and by the barometer Cunningham determined the elevation of
this dreary spot to be 1,227 feet, showing that he had descended to a level of
350 feet since leaving his encampment that morning. Having accomplished
thirteen miles, he arrived at the margin of a section of the plains where he
discovered a rivulet,[*] serpentine in form, whose course was marked by the
swamp-oaks upon its banks, as it flowed through the centre of an open flat to
the northward. Stretching north-eastward over the flat, on which plants were
growing like those he had seen in 1825 on the plains farther to the westward,
Cunningham in a mile and a half reached the rivulet; its channel did not exceed
a breadth of thirty feet, though perhaps it would have been difficult to cross
in an ordinary season, its banks of black earth being exceedingly steep. The
exploring party found, however, that, owing to the drought, its stream was now
a chain of pools, and they crossed it easily. Masses of reeds six feet high,
and plants which usually grow on land permanently wet proved abundantly the
state of inundation to which this river was subject in wet seasons. Two miles
farther, where rising grounds bounded this flat on the north-east, the men
having travelled fourteen miles, halted for the day at the side of a pool of
water on the edge of the plains.</p>
<blockquote>[* The explorers crossed Warrah and Quirindi Creeks. It is
difficult to identify positively the landmarks supplied by the
journals.]</blockquote>

</center>
<p>In writing up the report of his journey for Governor Darling on this day,
Cunningham says: "As we came through the woods we observed marks of the natives
on the trees, also a few bark huts which had been recently occupied. No smoke
or fire was seen, however, or any indication of the presence of aborigines;
and, though occasionally visited, this country did not appear numerously
inhabited. The huts, too, were evidently of long standing." He continues: "On
May 6th, being Sunday, we rested within our tents (lat. 31&deg;38' S., mean
elevation 1,128 feet, long. 150&deg;38' E.).[*] The rocks of a low ridge near
our encampment were of sandstone, and some of it had evidently been used by
natives (who had left remains of their fires near by) to sharpen their
hatchets." By the marks seen on the timber, these would appear to have been
made of iron. Doubtless they had become possessed of them in their
communications with the natives of the Hunter River and regions to the
southward and eastward of the Dividing Range. "The possession of an axe of iron
by a savage may thus be considered as his first step towards civilization,"
says Cunningham, who resumes:</p>
<blockquote>[* Cunningham's route northward across the Liverpool Plains led him
eastward of Warrah Peak and westward of Quirindi according to his own
calculations.]</blockquote>
<p>"May 7th to 12th. At an early hour we began the labours of the week,
prosecuting a course to the northward through broken, irregular country lying
on the eastern side of Liverpool Plains, of which the following is a
delineation. A series of lone, barren forest ridges clothed with a brush of
plants uninteresting even to the botanist and wooded with the usual box,
diminutive iron-bark, occasionally <i>Callitris</i> or cypress, along a space
of 6 miles from our encampment: a patch of plain about 3&frac12; miles in
breadth which appears to be watered on the north side by a small brook
declining to the N.W. that in the rainy season overflows its bank, and places
an interesting patch of grassy meadowland under water.</p>
<p>"Throughout the succeeding twelve miles from our last encampment, stony
hills and narrow valleys, diversified by plains, constitute a tolerable stretch
of sheep and cattle pasture, watered by a rivulet rising in the range (forming
their eastern boundary) which extend in a northerly direction. Onward, after
crossing this creek, the bank of which we quitted on the 9th, we proceeded over
patches of plain, badly parched and without water. On these plains our dogs
disturbed several of the native species[*] that were lying at ambush in the
grass, and, after giving chase, allowed the native kind to retire to the
woods...having sustained no injury beyond that of a dreadful fright. These
native dogs were...exceedingly fat, from which circumstance, coupled with the
position in which they were found, we inferred that many bustards were hovering
about these open flats.</p>
<blockquote>[* Dingoes.]</blockquote>
<p>"Passing beyond these plains, we descended to a narrow valley and in
2&frac14; miles came to a water-course which in rainy periods has evidently a
small current running to N.N.W.--at this time being merely a small chain of
stagnant pools. It was noon at the time we were passing these holes; a meridian
observation then obtained gave their lat. 31&deg;12'47" S...Forest ridge and
valley succeed for about four miles, when we descended a stony hill to a reedy
creek flowing eastward from the ranges, which now assume a wild, precipitous
character.</p>
<p>"On the morning of the 10th, in our journey northward, we forded the reedy
creek[*] which, bending its course to the base of the open forest, escapes
north-westerly, and, being united to the other two streams we have already
passed, eventually becomes Field's River of Mr. Oxley, by which channel the
entire eastern sides of Liverpool Plains are drained. Pursuing our course still
to the north-west through a narrow, confined, brushy valley, deeply grooved by
the washings from the eastern mountains, we were enabled by great exertion to
accomplish seven miles; but so harassed were my burdened horses that I deemed
it prudent to quit the base of these rocky ranges and, directing our course at
N.N.W., we found forest ground...more favourable for our advance.</p>
<blockquote>[* Probably Werries Creek.]</blockquote>
<p>"At our ninth mile we intersected a small, rocky creek,[*] running westward.
Its channel contained excellent water and its shaded banks an abundance of
grass. I was induced to halt, especially as the shoes of some of the horses had
become loosened by the rugged nature of the ground. I at length arrived at Mr.
Oxley's intersection of Peel's River in 1818, from which point I proposed to
proceed on my journey to the northward. But, observing that the rocky, bold
aspect of the country would not permit my heavily-laden horses to travel
eastward to that stream, I determined, whilst their shoes were being attended
to, to ascend a ridge[**] two miles to the N.W., to make observations.</p>
<blockquote>[* Probably Currabubula Creek.]</blockquote>
<blockquote>[** Of the Melville Range.]</blockquote>
<p>"From this eminence, the country to the N.E. and E. appeared lofty, broken
and sub-mountainous, the ranges thickly wooded and seemingly grassy, yet the
abrupt character of their western acclivities obliged me to abandon the design
of proceeding northward from Peel's River...Upon extending the view further to
the N. and E. I could perceive ranges of lofty hills lying N. and S. to mark
distinctly the direction of a valley through which I had no doubt Peel's River
flowed to the northward, as Mr. Oxley had observed it. Directing the line of
vision to N.W. and N.NW., the eye traversed a vast extent of level, wooded
country, through which run the York and Field Rivers which drain the Liverpool
Plains and flow to the N.W.</p>
<p>"I took a set of bearings to points of Mr. Oxley's survey in 1818 to W. and
W.S.W. which I had identified in my tour along the west side of the Liverpool
Plains in 1825, and perceived that, in order to journey northward with case and
safety, it would be necessary to proceed first to westward round the bases of
the hills. I then returned to my encampment. From the summit of the forest
ridge that I had climbed (which, it seemed, is the group called by Mr. Oxley,
Melville Hills) I could not perceive the least trace of human beings in a range
of the compass from N.E. by way of N. and W.; but at W.S.W. and S.W., in the
neighbourhood of Vansittart's Hills, large smokes rose from the forests;
doubtless...fired by the few aborigines who wander in these regions. I have
therefore determined to journey to the north in or near the meridian of my
present position, being satisfied that (since Peel's River falls into the
marshy interior) my course will cross it, and that the ranges of hills to the
eastward will either terminate or break to admit of its escape to the lower
N.W. country.</p>
<p>"On the morning of the 11th May," he continues, "we quitted our resting
place and pursued a course S. of W. for 3 miles, at length passing round the
termination of the hills through dry, brushy forest to shape a more direct line
to the N.W. The wooded country was level, scarcely over 1,000 ft. above the
sea-level, and at length we crossed the track of Mr. Oxley in 1818,[*] the
observation at noon, taken in the midst of dense, drooping <i>Acacia
pendula</i>, giving us lat. 31&deg;00'34" S., which placed our position about a
mile north of that gentleman's line of route to the eastward after he had
forded Field's River.</p>
<blockquote>[* In Oxley's journey eastward to Port Macquarie. Describing this
part of his journey, Cunningham writes to Telfair: "I continued my course north
and in a day's march passed the limit of known country as shown in the chart of
our Colony which does not extend beyond 31&deg; S."]</blockquote>
<h4>MITCHELL'S RIVER[*]</h4>
<blockquote>[* This was the Namoi River, a short distance westward from its
junction with the Maluerindie.</blockquote>
<p>"After penetrating brushes of the grey-hued <i>Acacia pendula</i>, we
stretched to the N.W. about four miles over declining country, forest and open
plain, with vegetation destroyed by drought...abundantly indicated by the rents
in the ground, the effect of the sun, as well as by the total absence of water.
Amid these we were not a little surprised to see a striking change in the
condition of the grasses, and other vegetation. We had evidently fallen on a
lower level than that on which our tents had stood. On entering the wooded land
bordering the plain (timbered with large apple-trees) we saw that the forest
had been flooded to a depth of five feet and noticed successive marks of floods
on the tree-trunks. Throughout the entire plains the country southward had been
subjected to the same inundation. The inclination of the heads of certain
plants to the W.S.W. marked the direction the current had taken upon retiring.
Have completed twelve miles and, being assured...that we were in the
neighbourhood of a larger river, we continued W.N.W. towards a range whose S.E.
points overlooked the plain we had traversed. In about a mile we arrived on the
left bank of a river winding round the southern base of the hills on its course
westward. The breadth of its channel exceeded 150 yards, of which 60 or 70
yards was water forming a succession of deep pools or rapids. The brook whereon
I had encamped last was on a height of 30 feet above the level; and an idea of
the vast bodies of water may be gathered, when flood-marks were observed four
feet above the level on which the tents were pitched. The new stream took its
origin in the hilly ground N.E., which formed a sort of secondary dividing
range separating the country through which we were now penetrating from that
watered by Peel's River. This river, bending round the lofty ridge, winds its
way westward and, without doubt, joins Field's River on its progress to the
N.W.[*] To this stream, which had not been seen previously by Europeans I gave
the name of Mitchell's River, as a compliment to the medical gentleman to whom
I was so much indebted for the valuable detail of barometrical observations he
had taken for me in Sydney during my absence on this journey in the
interior."</p>
<blockquote>[* Major Mitchell writes: "The course of the Maluerindie [also
known as Namoi as far up as the falls at Glen Barry] from the junction of the
Peel to that of the Conadilly (or Field's River) is somewhat southward of west:
below the junction of the Commonly, where the well-known name is Namoi, it
pursues a N.W. course."]</blockquote>
<p>Fresh marks of native hatchets on the trees, equally recent fire-places, and
a well-beaten path along the bank of the river "afforded proofs that there was
a blackfellows' encampment on this stream. An hour had not elapsed before the
voices of natives were heard, though none were seen, nor even the glimmer of
their fires through the bush at night."...Doubtless unseen they were tracking
the white men. In a deep, weedy pond of the river beneath the tents
Cunningham's men caught several fine fish--"the cod of all our western
rivers"--many of which seized the bait so eagerly that several hooks and
portions of line were carried away and lost. The end of an eclipse of the moon
observed on the 11th gave the long. of Mitchell's River here as 150&deg;27'15"
E. The lat., by an observed meridional altitude of the sun on the 12th, was
30&deg;57'12" S., mean elevation 84&deg; above the sea-level.</p>
<p>Continuing forward northwards on the 12th, at two miles the exploring party
crossed the river (running from north-east) and, fording it at a pebbly
fall,[*] pursued their way through a forest of large blue gum, and after
travelling a mile reached an open plain[**] stretching to the north-west.
Cunningham here changed his course to north-north-east, but was unsuccessful in
his search for water and was obliged to return to the river, which he reached
at sunset, and found that the banks furnished an abundance of sweet grass. He
rested here on the 13th and next day advanced northward, again through an and
country broken by watercourses long since dry, which rendered travelling
fatiguing both for man and beast. The only timber was an iron-bark, stunted in
growth, and cypress. On completing the thirteenth mile he turned eastward and
then halted for the day. Pushing north-north-west again on the 15th, at the
eighth mile he arrived at the base of a ridge, over the southern part of which
the horses climbed with great difficulty. Here he discovered a stream flowing
rapidly to the eastward which he crossed and encamped on its north bank. "It
runs," he says, "to eastward and is doubtless a tributary to the Peel. Before
this...stream was seen the journey through the country was depressing: scarcely
a bird was seen or heard; no game, native dog, nor the evidence (even of the
most ancient date) of a passing human being, until we arrived at this rivulet,
when our dogs gave chase to a solitary kangaroo."</p>
<blockquote>[* At the Wallamburra Ford.]</blockquote>
<blockquote>[** Mulluba Plain.]</blockquote>
<p>The signs of severe drought increased the farther the travellers journeyed
northward. On the 17th they were glad to find and cross a small river running
to the eastward, which Cunningham named Buddle's River.[*] Now for the first
time he was afforded an opportunity of meeting with the natives. Being a little
in front of his companions, he had reached the right bank of the stream when he
noticed smoke rising from the bush on the opposite side. Four natives and a
child, who already had caught sight of him, were standing gazing at him wildly,
evidently in a state of consternation and alarmed to a degree. Cunningham says:
"I called to the man who stood in front of the fire (and who had short spears
or other missile weapons in his hands), and beckoned to him by every sign that
would be considered, even by a savage, a pacific, friendly intention; but 'twos
all in vain. To every sign...he simply made a brief reply, at a distance,
however, too great to enable me to judge how far the dialect of the natives of
this part might differ from the language of the aborigines of the settled parts
of the colony; and then, on seeing eleven horses descend in a line to the
river's brink, he took to his heels, and, with the others (among whom were
women), ran off to distant parts...up the river, and disappeared. It was noon
when we crossed Buddle's River; I therefore determined its lat. as
30&deg;22'10" S., and long. 150&deg;32'45" E."</p>
<blockquote>[* Buddle or Manilla River.]</blockquote>
<h4>STODDART'S VALLEY</h4>
<p>Resuming their journey on the 19th the explorers left a rocky creek on which
they had encamped, and at eight miles reached the base of sterile hills deeply
grooved by sharp, narrow gullies declining northwards. A sudden break in these
hills to the north-west afforded a view of level, wooded country, approached by
a narrow vale and bounded by steep ridges. They descended the hills to an
apple-tree flat, and "continued the journey northerly through the vale, which
expands; a small, limpid stream, running through the centre of the vale,
murmurs over the stony bed of its channel, its banks being shaded with
swamp-oaks more or less dense."[*] Here Cunningham and his men rested at a spot
where the grass was fresh and luxuriant. Suddenly he was surprised to see in
these unexplored unknown parts traces, two or three days old, of homed cattle,
and the trodden grass showed where eight to a dozen animals had rested. He
supposed they must have strayed from some large herd, since stragglers were
known to be running perfectly wild on the plains at the base of Arbuthnot's
Range, distant about 170 miles to the south-west. The discovery, however, on
the homeward journey of "a shed that had been erected by white men" on a spot
three miles to the north-east of this vale led Cunningham to conclude "that
Europeans had been wandering through that part of the interior." He continues:
"Upon the range on the eastern side of the vale I discovered several
undescribed plants and a species of flint rock of curious laminated figure was
observed to repose on large bodies of serpentine at the base of the range.
During our stay here in this vale, which, I have much pleasure in naming
Stoddart's Valley,[*] after an officer of the Royal Staff Corps, I was enabled
to determine the position of my encampment as lat. 29&deg;58'52" S., and long.
150&deg;33'30" E."</p>
<blockquote>[* Bingara Creek.]</blockquote>
<p>Advancing northward on the 21st, the party traced the creek, on whose banks
they had rested, through the valley to north-west, and admired the beauty of
its scenery as they proceeded. At seven miles the creek formed a junction with
a large river (Cunningham writes: "seemingly the Peel," but he subsequently
named it the Gwydir) which, having flowed southward through eastern hills
passes the north extreme of Stoddart's Valley and escapes towards the lower
north-western interior. The channel of this river at the part Cunningham forded
it exhibited a gravelly bed 250 yards in breadth, filled in rainy seasons to a
depth of twelve to fifteen feet, as shown by the flood marks on its banks. Some
time was spent in getting across, and at evening the tents were pitched on its
right bank. In descending Stoddart's Valley[*] to the river, several trees were
seen to have been completely barked recently by natives, the prints of whose
feet, including those of children, were observed in the sand at the ford, while
large bodies of smoke rose from grass which had been fired on the river bank
opposite the encampment.</p>
<blockquote>[* Bingara is its Present name.]</blockquote>
<p>"<i>22nd &amp; 23rd May.</i> Quitting the right or North-eastern bank of
Peel's River [i.e. the Gwydir] which had taken a bend to the westward, we
pursued our route to the N.N.W. immediately, at the base of a continuation of
the Eastern Range of the Hills which again assumed a bold and rocky
character.[*] We travelled through an uniformly barren tract of wooded country,
frequently broken and ridgy, and as the declivity of the several gullies,
dipped considerably towards the channel of the Peel, which extended along the
eastern base of a densely wooded range, bearing west of us, we found the whole
of the day's stage exceedingly badly watered."</p>
<blockquote>[* Passing close to the site of Warialda.]</blockquote>
<p>Fourteen miles north of their ford on the Gwydir the travellers came to a
better country, more lightly timbered, with a darker soil and covered with good
grass. The high range westward of their route soon terminated and "heavily
timbered land lying beyond it could be seen which evidently had a declension to
the N.W."</p>
<p>A rocky ridge of hills at the same bearing also fell to the ordinary level.
Cunningham continues:</p>
<p>"To the North-East the country rises to a considerable elevation, and a very
lofty ridge crowned with cypress lying nearly east and west, and from the back
of which rose a very sharp cone[*] I received the name of Masterton's Range.
The rocks of the adjacent hills of which large masses had rolled down, and
studded the lower grounds over which we travelled, were of sandstone, reposing
upon a large body of pudding-stone which included large pebbles of quartz and
jasper.</p>
<blockquote>[* The cone was named Brace Peak by Cunningham who passed on the
west side of the ridge.]</blockquote>
<p>"About noon on the 23rd we reached the wide but shallow reedy channel of a
river[*] forming simply at this season a long chain of ponds; and having
observed the altitude of the sun at the meridian on its margin, which gave me
for lat. 30&deg;34'44" S. we traced it about 4 miles to the N.N.E. and then
halted on its banks. Some strips of good pasturage appeared on the edge of
these ponds, especially where the apple-tree (<i>Angophora cordifolia</i>) was
a prevalent timber. The marks of the native's hatchet were observable on the
trees, but the few savages, that prowl through these lonely regions in quest of
food, appear evidently to avoid us--the train of laden horses, the number of my
men and dogs, doubtless alarming those who may have seen us from the hills so
much as to urge their flight, rather than induce them to seek a communication
with us.</p>
<blockquote>[* It may be pointed out that on the plan of Cunningham's route
(Lands Department, Sydney, I, 537) a river called the Severn is indicated to
the south of the Dumaresq or Severn, and this river appears to be the Severn
referred to.]</blockquote>
<p>"<i>May 24th.</i> Upon crossing the reedy channel of the chain of ponds on
which we had encamped we passed over a stony cypress ridge, and among a mass of
vegetation characterizing the flora of the Bathurst country, I detected a few
plants, which I had not previously met with, of genera, however, fully
established...At our 4th mile we rose by a very gradual ascent to the pitch of
a forest ridge, where we observed a change had taken place in the rock
formation, which was abundantly shown by the dark colour, and superior quality
of the soil. The rock appeared to be related to trap and was exceedingly
porous, containing quartzose nodules. Upon reaching the extreme part of the
ridge we observed before us, a very moderate country extremely open, with
patches of plain, clear of timber. A series of forest hills and intervening
valleys, furnishing abundance of grass, but perfectly destitute of water,
succeeded in our course to the north throughout the succeeding seven miles. At
length we arrived at a patch of forest ground, that had been recently fired,
and as I felt satisfied the water could not be far distant, where natives had
been within 2 or 3 days, I directed a search to be made for it, along the dry
sandy channel of a creek,[*] in the direction of its fall to the northward. In
about a mile to our great joy, a large clay hole was found, containing an ample
sufficiency of the precious element to meet all our demands, and although it
had been long in a stagnant state, it was of good quality...</p>
<blockquote>[* Ottley's or Cunningham's Creek.]</blockquote>
<p>"On the morning of the 25th, as I had been led to conclude, we found the
country, for we had not advanced a mile before a patch of plain opened to us,
bounded by low thinly wooded forest hills, and altogether a pretty picturesque
country. Over the plain we travelled at N. by east to the opposite piece of
forest ground, and passing which, we reached a second plain, stretching as did
the former, east and west several miles, and their breadth being about a mile
and a quarter.</p>
<p>"It was distressing, however, to observe so much fine black soil--sound, dry
and crumbling beneath the foot--as these plains possess, clothed moreover with
an exuberant growth of grasses and herbage, languishing for rain, and without
channels of sufficient depth and capacity, throughout that ample surface, to
retain water permanently throughout the year. A pleasing succession of open
forest hills and waterless downs, characterize the face of the country to the
close of a 12 mile journey, which terminated at a stony gully, where, after a
little search, we were fortunate to discover fine water retained in narrow
rocky cavities,</p>
<p>"Upon reaching the brow of the forest ridge immediately over our encampment
the hills to the westward were observed to terminate and a level open country
(bounded to the N.N.W. and north only by the distant horizon) broke upon our
view, of which, although generally densely wooded, the vast surface was here
and there diversified by patches of open plain. I could perceive from the spot
on which I made these observations, the level country, as far as N.N.E. beyond
which, or more easterly...my further observation was prevented. The mean
elevation of our tents above the ocean was 1228 feet, which placed us upwards
Of 300 feet above the ford of Peel's River [i.e. the Gwydirl.]</p>
<p>"<i>26th.</i> Throughout the whole of the last night the temperature of the
atmosphere was perceived by each person of the expedition to be sensibly milder
than had been experienced since its progress from Hunter's River, during which
period slight frosts have generally prevailed, and as some patches of clouds
rose from the distant western horizon, I could not but view these
meteorological variations as ominous, and as there was a new moon at 4 o'clock
this morning, I considered the whole as the presage...of wet weather, which it
was natural enough to conclude would ere long set in, in these vast regions,
not simply to moisten the soil, and revive vegetation, but to fill the channels
of its rivers of which the largest are, at this extremity of drought
exceedingly reduced.</p>
<p>"Pursuing our journey to the N.N.E. through an extent (exceeding 5 miles) of
forest ground, in part rather closely timbered and interspersed with thickets
of plants, frequent on the skirts of Liverpool Plains, and again lightly wooded
with a blighted Ironbark we at length intersected the sandy channel of a river
which in other seasons than the present is highly important to the adjacent
good grazing land, and which, at periods of great rains, forms an impetuous
stream ten feet deep, and fifty yards wide.[*] The distress of the year, of
which I have spoken so much, and with which the vegetation of these northern
regions has so long and so strenuously struggled for an existence, appears some
time since to have deprived this ample channel of its water, and as its sandy
bed was in part occupied by a brush of woody plants, that usually usually
affect and desert situation, this circumstance alone appeared sufficient to
demonstrate to us that it had been without water many months.</p>
<blockquote>[* This sandy channel, fifty yards wide, would appear to have been
the Macintyre River, which Cunningham must have passed over, and as the season
was a very dry one, it is not extraordinary that he found only a sandy channel
there.]</blockquote>
<p>"We ere surprised to observe how wonderfully the native grasses had resisted
the dry weather on the upper banks of this dried watercourse. They appeared
fresh and nutritive, affording abundance of provision to the many kangaroos
that were bounding around us. On crossing this sandy channel we continued our
original course N.N.E. over a plain two miles in width, the soil of which we
found excellent, of a black colour, but very dry, the surface being in many
places cracked into deep chasms by the action of the solar rays.</p>
<p>"Apprehensive of difficulty in finding water, I was induced on passing over
the brow of a ridge of forest-land (and observing a hilly country to the
eastward) to alter my line of procedure to E.N.E., in the hope that by
advancing two or three miles towards more elevated grounds, we should succeed
in discovering a sufficiency of that element so rare in these solitudes for
ourselves and horses. Penetrating about 2 miles through an and desert forest,
of a deep sandy soil, and timbered with stately Callitris or cypress, we
reached the rocky margin of a creek by which the waters that occasionally fall
from the hills to the eastward are conveyed to a lower level in the immediate
neighbourhood. Upon tracing this creek a short distance, abundance of good
water was found in its rockv bed, and, as its bank furnished grass of a
tolerable quality, we halted.</p>
<p><i>May 27th.</i> Being Sunday, <i>I rested my People and horses</i>,[*] a
very lowering morning, the clouds however clearing off early in the forenoon
allowed me to take the necessary observations to determine my position. Lat.
29&deg;00'02" S. Long. 150&deg;40'15" E. variation by azimuth 7&deg;53'E. The
mean of several observations of the height of the mercurial column taken
morning and evening giving me only an elevation of 842 feet above the sea.</p>
<blockquote>[* It will be seen that on this day Cunningham did not advance,
otherwise he would have reached the Dumaresq sooner than he did.]</blockquote>
<p>"We have at length arrived at the parallel of 29&deg; and having consumed
more than the half of the original stock of provisions, with which I had
quitted the colony, it became absolutely necessary, that I should at once
determine not only the extent to which I could possibly penetrate, further to
the northward, with the limited means I have at command after laying aside six
weeks full rations for consumption during the journey homeward, but also the
precise direction of our route onward under all the circumstances of the
reduced condition of my horses, the and state of the country and the aspect of
the weather--circumstances that I must of necessity be governed by, in all my
future movements.</p>
<p>"Upon inspecting my horses I found that notwithstanding the extreme care of
my people the backs of several had become much galled by the saddles, and all
were much reduced and debilitated by the labours of the journey, and more
especially by the parched up state of the pasture, and the general poverty of
the country, through which we have travelled. To these points for consideration
I subjoined the circumstance of the low level to which we had come, the barren
ground it presented, and the probability of descending to an arid region of
flat scrubby country totally destitute of esculent vegetation for the support
of my horses.</p>
<p>"Impressed with these several circumstances of our present situation I felt
bound to determine on a deviation from that line of northern course the plan of
my tour had conditionally prescribed. I therefore resolved to pursue my journey
more to the eastward not only in order to secure to my horses a more certain
and nutritive provision than that harsh vegetation on which they have of late
subsisted, which it was reasonable to suppose the higher lands in that
direction would furnish, but also with the view of connecting (upon penetrating
to the meridian of 152&deg; and north to the parallel of 28&deg;) my sketch of
those parts of the interior through which we have travelled with the country in
the vicinity of Moreton Bay by bearings to each of its fixed points as I might
identify, and especially of the cone of Mount Warning."</p>
<p>It was noticed that the rocks were of a white colour here, and that the few
inhabitants who lived in these tracts took advantage of their softness to
sharpen their mogos or stone hatchets, upon them.[*] Traces of these
operations, of dates both recent and distant, were observed on stony ledges in
different parts of the creek. Among the birds flying round the tents was
noticed a parrot of a large size, never before seen. "The feathers of its head
were snow white, while its body appeared of an uniform green; the wings were
also of that colour, but their outer sides took a brown hue." Only two birds
(probably male and female) were seen, and they were very shy.</p>
<blockquote>[* He called it Moss Creek.]</blockquote>
<h4>DUMARESQ RIVER</h4>
<p>"<i>May 28th.</i> Cunningham writes: "We had not proceeded three miles to
the N.N.E. through a continuation of barren brushy forest, before we came to
the left bank of a stream, presenting a handsome reach half a mile in length,
thirty yards wide, and evidently very deep. Its bed, which was of a gravel
containing many larger water-worn pebbles of quartz and jasper, was skirted by
lofty swamp oaks bearing on their branches flood marks at least 20 feet above
its naked channel. When therefore its waters are swollen to that height, it
forms a rapid river from 80 to 100 yards in breadth, as I ascertained by the
measured distance of the outer banks from each other. This stream which
received the name of Durnaresq's River[*] (in honour of the family to which His
Excellency the Governor is so intimately connected), rises in a mountainous
country to the N.E. at an elevation (determined in the progress of this
expedition) of nearly 3,000 feet above the sea, and after pursuing a western
course for about 100 miles along a singular declivity of country, falls 2,000
feet to the spot at which we have discovered it, whence it was observed to pass
on to the north-western interior at a mean height of only 840 feet above the
level of the ocean. In tracing its channel upwards in search of a ford, we soon
arrived at a part at which the waters above and those of the reach below us
were almost entirely separated by the dry weather.</p>
<blockquote>[* It runs into the Macintyre and forms a section of the boundary
between New South Wales and Queensland. Cunningham crossed the Dumaresq between
Texas and Bengalla possibly nearer the latter than the former place, and a
little to the south-eastward of Wyemo.]</blockquote>
<p>"From the right bank of Dumaresq River, we again prosecuted our journey to
the N.N.E. and having in the first instance passed over some stony ridges of
trifling elevation, penetrated about 11 miles through an and sandy
forest-ground, wooded with small Ironbark and Cypress. Upon accomplishing our
12th mile the country continued a perfect level clothed with a density of
scrub, underwood, and small blighted timber, but without the smallest
indication of water, which however was not to be hoped for in a region the
surface of which we found so generally coated with white or reddish sand to the
depth of several inches. In this situation, and as the sun was declining to the
lower western levels it became necessary to determine promptly on the course we
should pursue, since by continuing our route to the N.N.E. it was evident, we
advanced more deeply into the midst of the desert.</p>
<p>"Accordingly as we perceived a slight depression of country easterly, I
directed the people to the N.E. dispatching a man forward at that point, to
search for water.</p>
<p>"In a mile, a broad but flat shallow sandy channel was found declining
N.N.E. and in its bed was found a hole, just dry. With renovated hope we traced
it downwards, finding proofs of water being not distant; and in a span of about
1&frac12; miles, a small pool was discovered,[*] fringed around with an aquatic
plant "of our Colony " and as its water although stagnant and discoloured was
of a tolerable quality, we most gladly halted, both men and horses sinking
beneath great fatigue, consequent on a march of ten hours, through an arid
sandy low wood, destitute of water, and in an atmospheric temperature of 75
degrees. The thermometer at sunset stood at 70&deg;, and the results of
barometrical computation showed us we were lower than the bed of Dumaresq's
River. My tent was 811 feet above the sea."</p>
<blockquote>[* Muddy Creek and Stagnant Pool on the route map.]</blockquote>
<p>On May 29th, quitting this desert wood, the journey north-north-east was
resumed, and in two miles the bank of a small river was met with which flowed
westerly; it was fifteen yards wide but as in the case of other streams
presented the appearance of a chain of ponds or water-holes; some of the latter
were a quarter of a mile in length. Passing over the flat through which this
stream ran, Cunningham's party entered a thick cypress brush, and had
penetrated it for two miles when rain began to fall, so they returned to the
river they had just left, and encamped in lat. 28&deg;45'45" S.</p>
<p>Next day, May 30th, they endeavoured to pass east-north-east round the patch
of thicket of cypress, which in places was twenty-five feet high, and did not
succeed, "for the brushes stretched across our path due east, and so we had to
force a way through to the N.E. At last a patch of open forest enabled us to
proceed, when we came upon the elbow of a rivulet[*] (running from E. to
N.W.)."The land on each side of this was a beautiful sward of grass capable of
forming rich pasturage and permanently watered, so that Cunningham believed
that he had reached a stretch of better country.</p>
<blockquote>[* He named it Macintyre's Brook.]</blockquote>
<p>He continues: "We had, however, difficulties new and fresh in reserve for us
ere the labours of the day were closed. This beautiful stream we found too deep
to pass; but, tracing it up over a verdant carpet...about three-fourths of a
mile, we discovered a pebbly shallow...and, gaining the opposite bank, we
resumed our course to the N.E. over a narrow strip of forest flat which
appeared to stretch along each bank of the rivulet.</p>
<p>"Compact thickets of like description with the patch we had already passed,
again stretched from East to West, over a surface of ground so truly level, as
to afford me, as far as we could observe, not the slightest rise, whence any
observations might be made of the extent of these jungles or the direction
(supposing them to be strips and not extensive masses) in which they were
disposed in these and regions. Finding ourselves thus hemmed in, and although
with every discouraging prospect before us, I nevertheless determined to
persevere in an attempt to force a passage onward to the N.E. bearing however
in mind that should we fail in effecting it in a few hours, we could at least
return on our track to the rivulet, where our horses would rest on fine
pasture, and on the banks of which we might subsequently pursue our way to the
eastward although perhaps on a course in the first instance not better than
E.S.E.</p>
<p>"As these thickets from their very margin presented a density almost
impervious to packhorses I directed an active man to follow me with an axe to
remove every obstacle that would prevent their passing forward on a course,
which I endeavoured steadily to pursue by compass to the N.E. In many parts the
quantities of fallen timber were so considerable and the stems of an acacia 5
feet high were so closely grown together and interwoven with other plants as to
present at first view a barrier altogether impenetrable inducing at one stage
of our penetration an apprehension of being eventually obliged to return to the
river.</p>
<p>"A laborious circuitous route enabled me to avoid these intricacies, and as
we subsequently came upon small patches of much thinner brush and more open to
the sun and air whereon we allowed the horses to breathe, we were encouraged to
proceed.</p>
<p>"Thus we continued cutting down small trees and opening the brush for the
horses, for about four miles, when we were gladdened on arriving at an open
clear forest, enabling us to prosecute our route to the N.E. without
inconvenience. Meeting with a chain of ponds in about 3 miles falling to the
eastward, containing good water we again rested, as men and horses were sinking
beneath the labours of the day. The course and distance made from the morning's
encampment, notwithstanding the difficulties of the way, being E. 41 N. 11
miles."</p>
<p>Cunningham extended the 31st day's stage through rising ground to the
north-north-west, where water was found in a stagnant state "by a little
deviation from our line of course to the S.W.," and the party encamped in a
forest flat of blue and spotted gums. Earlier in the day, from the summit of a
range, he had faintly descried another range at a distance of eighty miles,
this being low, detached, and stretching eastward N. 2&deg;W. to N.1&deg; E.
Somewhat further towards the east lay yet another range with a pointed peak in
the centre. A high range which extended to the north-north-east and
south-south-west and bore east-south-east twenty-five miles, he named Macleay's
Range. The ranges with which he was surrounded were too high to admit of an
extended view towards the Mount Warning Ranges, but to the
west-south-west-by-west and thence to north was a vast expanse of level land,
bounded only by the horizon.</p>
<p>"<i>June 1-3.</i> Monotonous country, continually rising to the E.N.E." For
twenty miles a barren and uninteresting territory was traversed; on the 3rd, at
a camp on a stony creek, the latitude observed is given as 28&deg;17'49" S.,
and long. (by acct.) 151&deg;21' E., and mean height above the ocean 1404
feet."</p>
<p>Cunningham resumes: "Although we have been rising each stage during the last
week progressively to a somewhat more elevated line of country than that
through which we have of late passed, we have yet to arrive at nutritive
pasturage, that upon which my horses have (it may be said) miraculously
subsisted being everywhere seriously affected by the droughts of the year.
Nevertheless situated as we were, it was impossible to pursue a better course
than N.E. easterly, we therefore again continued our journey in that direction
on the morning of the 4th ascending a series of rather heavily timbered forest
ridges...rough and stony surface.</p>
<p>"At our third mile whilst in the act of passing over the brow of one of
these hills the voices of natives were distinctly heard, and almost immediately
we perceived several Indians in motion among the timber, not however before
they had evidently had for some moments the first gaze of surprise at us, as
the trunks of the trees being as black as the bodies of these people had
prevented our descrying them as quickly. I happened to be accompanied by only
one of my people, the others being with the packhorses that were working up
another part of the rising ground behind the natives, where the acclivity was
more moderate. On my calling to the packhorse leaders, the natives stood and
viewed us at the distance of about 100 yards, occasionally retiring behind the
trees, again walking about in great uneasiness. The spot was their encamping
ground, and as they had their women and children with them, whose respective
voices we could distinctly recognize, they could not leave their fires with
that precipitation which their great alarm induced by our presence would
evidently have urged.</p>
<p>"The instant however the people in charge of the horses had replied to my
call, from the gully whence they were ascending to me, the agitation of the
natives became extreme, they therefore having already hurried away their gins
and little ones, ran off with the utmost despatch through the brushy woods to
the northward. I could have rejoiced to have brought about a communication with
these Indians, had my people been with us, or had we met each other on more
open ground, than a confined brushy forest, for I felt perfectly satisfied that
as soon as their fears had been removed by our pacific overtures to them, they
would have proved themselves of friendly disposition, as they neither made any
reply to us, or appeared in the least disposed to place themselves in menacing
attitudes, or exhibited their weapons to deter us from approaching them. Under
the circumstances however of our meeting, I deemed it prudent, as soon as I
perceived them, to stand still until they had made their little arrangements to
depart, I could have proceeded quickly upon them, but the consequences might
have been serious to us, as we had no arms at the time, and those people might
have been disposed to have disputed the ground with us, on the score of their
women and children which nature teaches even the savage it is a duty in man, as
a husband and parent to protect.</p>
<p>"Ere my people had joined me, they had passed the fires of these aborigines
which were seven in number, and about them they recognized the bones of the
bandycoot and bustard, of which latter, the feathers were strewed around, and
upon the flesh of which these Indians had been feasting.</p>
<p>"Upon joining again we continued our journey, and immediately quitting the
more open forest ground, entered a dense brush of <i>Acacia Daviesiae</i>, the
wand-like stems of which indurated by fire, proving a very serious annoyance to
us. With great bodily exertion to man and horse we penetrated about 4 miles
through thicket ten feet high and upon making forest ground on its eastern
skirts we traced a narrow valley (falling easterly) in search of water."</p>
<p>Following the valley for a little distance the party halted at a rocky
water-hole, where they spent the night.[*] Smoke seen during the day to the
northward and eastward, and the frequent screech of the white cockatoo, told
Cunningham that water was not far away. Next day, June 5th, setting off in an
east-north-east direction, after two miles he crossed a rocky creek,[**] with
pools of good water and green grass on its margin; and from "the pitch of a
ridge"[***] above it he obtained a "most agreeable" view of open country, which
from its aspect he felt would reward him for his toil and crown his
labours.</p>
<blockquote>[* Brushy Vale on the maps 1504 feet above the sea.]</blockquote>
<blockquote>[** 1,717 feet above the sea.]</blockquote>
<blockquote>[*** One of the highest points between Thane's Creek and Sandy
Creek according to Sir A. Morgan.]</blockquote>
<p>This was in fact Cunningham's first view of the Darling Downs.</p>
<p>A gap in the forest ridge revealed eight or nine miles of open downs of
great extent rolling away easterly to the base of a lofty range, lying north
and south and distant about three miles. The sight of such a country in the
distance revived the drooping spirits of his people wonderfully, and they
proceeded forward at a quickened pace to the eight mile stage, where they
arrived at a parallel of 28&deg;11'10" S. The timber became thinner and "we had
not advanced half a mile," writes Cunningham, "before we came upon a patch of
open plain skirted by a low ridge on its western side and forest ground at the
opposite point. With great satisfaction we perceived, as we approached the
downs, that small patches or strips of mist extended throughout their length,
and a line of swamp-oaks stretched along their south-western extremes, showing
us that these extensive tracts were not wanting in water."</p>
<h4>CONDAMINE RIVER[*]</h4>
<blockquote>[* This river rises in the Dividing Range about sixty miles from
the sea, flows north-west for 250 miles, then bends west and south-west. On
being joined by the Maranoa, it runs to the south-west under the name of the
Balonne. Cunningham crossed it near Toolburra.]</blockquote>
<p>"Upon accomplishing a journey of thirteen miles [the last one] we stopped on
the left bank of a small river that comes from the S.E., which appeared likely
to give us trouble to pass, as...there was very deep water...with a current
flowing to the N.W." While the men fished there during the afternoon, at a spot
half a mile above the encampment, they noticed three natives in the bush on the
opposite bank burning the grass. They showed no signs of alarm, but afterwards
walked away at a leisurely pace and passed out of sight in the forest.
Cunningham fixed the situation of his encampment here as being in 28&deg;9'37"
S. (by observation at noon of the 6th of June) and 151&deg;41'30" E., and its
mean elevation above the sea, 1,402 feet.</p>
<p>"After quitting our resting place immediately after noon," he continues, "on
June 6th, proceeding up the river half a mile, we crossed to the opposite bank
by a ford that had been previously discovered by my people. From this stream,
which was named Condamine's River in compliment to the officer[*] who is A.D.C.
to the Governor, we entered upon the extensive downs, pursuing our way to the
E.N.E. along their southern margin. During the afternoon and following day we
travelled their whole extent to the base of the mountains which bound them at
their eastern extreme, and were able to make the following observations.</p>
<blockquote>[* Thomas de la Condamine, A.D.C. to Governor
Darling.]</blockquote>
<h4>DARLING DOWNS</h4>
<p>"These extensive tracts, which I have named Darling Downs in honour of His
Excellency, are situate in or about the mean parallel of 28&deg;8', along which
they extend 18 miles to the meridian of 152&deg;. On the north side they are
bounded by a rise of lightly wooded ridges, skirted on their opposite margin by
a level forest of box and white gum. A chain of deep ponds passes along the
central lower portion throughout its whole length and falls westerly into the
Condamine River[*]; their breadth varies; at the western extremity it appeared
about 1&frac12; miles, towards the eastern limits it was estimated at 3 miles.
Grasses and herbage were of the same species in similar situations in the
southern country; no plant appeared more striking than a rib-grass (<i>Plantago
struthionis</i>), the leaves of which measured 12-15 inches in length. From
these lower grounds downs of a rich black and dry soil, clothed with abundance
of grass...stretched on an east and west line, constituting a range of sound
sheep-pasture convenient to water but beyond the reach of floods...Such is the
character of the Darling Downs, which comprise little short of 28,000
acres."</p>
<blockquote>[* The chain of ponds is now known as Glengallan Creek. In
consequence of the drought conditions of 1827 the water here, as in some other
places, had ceased running.]</blockquote>
<p>Towards the close of the afternoon of June 7th Cunningham advanced
north-by-east through open apple-forest when, upon reaching the base of a
curious flat-topped Mount[*] which terminated the range of mountains on the
east side, his party encamped. He writes of this spot: "We found there a narrow
creek with the finest patch of meadow pasturage I have seen in New South Wales,
and determined to remain there two days to rest our wearied horses, some being
reduced to the last stage of debility." He also wished to examine the dark
brushes covering the mount from its base to its summit, since the plants
growing upon it had an intertropical appearance. On the morning of the 8th,
accompanied by one of his people, he set out to climb the Table Mount, at the
foot of which stood his tents; for two hours they had to make their way through
a thicket of plants like those Cunningham had seen on the Brisbane in 1824,
until at last they gained an open spot on the summit, whence an excellent view
of the country was obtained. From north by way of west, thence to south and
south-east, he took bearings of the most remarkable points.</p>
<blockquote>[* Mount Dumaresq.]</blockquote>
<h4>CANNING DOWNS</h4>
<p>He noticed that at N.N.W., and especially at North, the country formed a
series of densely timbered ridges extending from the chain of mountains
immediately to eastward, which appeared to constitute the main or Great
Dividing Range separating the coast district from the interior. From the N.W.
to West and thence to South the eye traversed a vast expanse of open land--in
the distance apparently tame and uninteresting, but within the scope of twenty
miles showing every pleasing feature of hill and dale, woodland and plain. To
the north of Darling Downs large, clear patches of land [Clifton Plains] were
named Peel's Plains, whilst those to the S. and S.S.E. were christened Canning
Downs "in honour of the Right Hon. George Canning." The extent of these downs,
through which ran a stream bending its course to the N.W., Cunningham was
unable to gather, but the lofty ridge bounding them to southward (which lay
nearly east and north) was entitled Herries Range.</p>
<p>He spent a great part of the day botanizing until heavy weather from the
north and signs of rain made him hasten back to the camp with his specimens. In
describing the Table Mount where his tents were pitched Cunningham writes: "The
rock composing the mountain is whinstone, extremely cavernous, the cavities
containing crystallized quartz." This flat-topped mountain was named Mount
Dumaresq, and on its northern side a grassy valley extending north-east from
Darling Downs to the foot of the Main Range was entitled Millar's Vale.</p>
<p>Rainy weather now set in, and the travellers could not leave their camp
until June 10th, when it had cleared up. Having taken bearings of his route,
Cunningham wished to proceed to some high ranges eastward, and obtain a view
from their summits of different points of the coast. A hill in his path of
square form, similar to Mount Dumaresq, and bearing south-south-east from it,
obliged him to go four miles to the south-east of his course.</p>
<h4>LOGAN'S VALE</h4>
<p>Upon passing round the south-western foot of this hill, which he called
Mount Sturt in honour of Captain Sturt of the 39th Regiment, his party
travelled over "patches of downs " and then pushed again to the north-east.
They came to the entrance of a valley and in five miles crossed a small
swamp-oak creek[*] winding southerly through it, and halted on its banks in an
apple-tree flat clothed with green. On entering this valley, which was named
Logan's Vale in honour of Captain Logan, commandant at the settlement at
Brisbane (distant to the north-east about seventy-five miles), they observed
that the soil round the foot of a tree had been dug and broken-by natives
evidently, in search of the larvae of insects (a favourite delicacy with them);
and that at a short distance beyond this spot another tree had just been
barked. Cunningham looked for the black woodman, who he felt sure was close at
hand, but did not see him. It was thought, however, that probably he had
concealed himself in the dark brushes extending from Mount Sturt, which bounded
the route on the left, or possibly in a hollow on the right by which the
stream, winding through the vale, escaped southerly. "It was," says Cunningham,
"in the brushy forests clothing the slopes of the lateral ranges on our left
that I first clearly and satisfactorily recognized a pine which I subsequently
identified with the species of <i>Araucaria</i> so frequent in the dark forests
that invest the banks of the River Brisbane."[**]</p>
<blockquote>[* Possibly Swan Creek of the maps.]</blockquote>
<blockquote>[* <i>A. Cunninghamii</i>: See (under date June 10, 1827) Allan
Cunningham's report to General Darling. Cunningham had seen this tree during
his visit to Moreton Bay, and, as already mentioned, he then noticed that there
existed the difference between it and <i>A. excelsa</i>, the Norfolk Island
Pine.]</blockquote>
<p>He continues: "I determined to occupy two or three days in this vale making
observations to enable me to determine my position...whilst my horses were
recovering from...the effects of the scantiness and bad quality of the pasture
during the journey. June 11th.--A sharp frost, the thermometer at 7 a.m. had
sunk to 30&deg;. Having directed the occupations of my people...accompanied by
one man I proceeded to a part of the range immediately above our tents whence I
hoped to make all remarks on the journey to the northward and eastward that I
considered indispensable to a satisfactory closure of my journey. In an hour we
reached the summit of the ridge...we continued to ascend from one tier to
another (generally in a north-eastern direction) until about 3 o'clock we
gained a lofty point. From here we observed through some hollow part of the
extreme range in our front (about 1&frac12; miles away) portions of the country
in the vicinity of the Brisbane River at N.E., also parts of the more distant
lands at the base of the Mount Warning Ranges, the cone of which we distinctly
saw crowning the group of mountains about 65 or 70 miles away. It was with much
satisfaction I took the following bearings. Cone of Mount Warning, E. 9&deg; S.
High peak of the chart[*] N. 50&deg; E. Spot on which the tents stood on
Logan's Vale, W. 44&deg; S. about 5 miles.</p>
<blockquote>[* This was named Mount Flinders.]</blockquote>
<h4>CUNNINGHAM'S GAP FIRST SIGHTED</h4>
<p>"Had the day continued fine and clear, I should have endeavoured...to have
gained the highest ridge...about 2 miles distant...it would have enabled me in
taking a survey of this...mountainous land to have observed how far a passage
over these lofty ranges could be effected by which the...country passed over
could become accessible from the shores of Moreton Bay or Brisbane River.[*]
We, however, noticed from the station to which we had climbed a very deeply
excavated part of the main range bearing from us about N.N.E. two or three
miles, to the pitch of which there appeared a tolerably easy rise along the
back of a forest ridge from the head of Millar's Valley. So remarkable a hollow
in the principal range I determined not to leave unexamined, since it
appeared...it might prove to be a very practicable pass from the eastern
country to the Darling Downs and thus form the door of a very considerable
grazing country."</p>
<blockquote>[* A passage from the sea-coast to the interior.]</blockquote>
<p>Rain, which fell in heavy showers, obliged Cunningham and his man to leave
the range, descending by a rocky gully. He says: "At 8 o'clock we reached the
encampment perfectly drenched, myself never more disposed to sink beneath
excessive fatigue." And adds: "These forest ridges were covered to their
summits with grasses of luxuriant growth, and were watered by trickling rills.
These mountains, to the bases of which we have approached, form a leading range
and separate the eastern and western waters." From his observations Cunningham
calculated that the height of the Dividing Range was about 4,100 feet.</p>
<p>The night of the 11th was boisterous and wet, and next day rain confined the
explorers to their tents. On the morning of the 13th, the weather being
somewhat clearer, Cunningham sent two of his men to Millar's Valley to examine
the mountain gap that he had discovered in the range, and thence to eastward,
to take bearings. He himself stayed in the bush round his tent collecting
specimens of the plants there, which were for the most part of an
"intertropical" character. The situation of his encampment he places in lat.
28&deg;10'45" S. and long. 152&deg;7'45" E. This was his most northern point.
The height here of his tent above the shores of Moreton Bay was 1,877 feet.</p>
<p>Not until noon on the 14th did the men return with the account of the hollow
back in the Dividing Range at the head of Millar's Valley. The following report
of their observations was sent by Cunningham to General Darling: "They ascended
a narrow ridge by which they rose gradually seven miles to a distance of about
one mile from the highest pitch of the Gap, when the difficulties appeared to
consist of the ruggedness of the large masses of rock that had fallen from the
heads into the hollow and the brush with which these boulders were covered. On
ascending the south head they observed a rather easier passage over the range
where a road could be constructed, the acclivity from Millar's Valley being by
no means abrupt and the fall easterly from the range to the forest ground at
its foot appearing exceedingly moderate." To the north-east lay an extensive
tract of grazing land, with patches of plain and ridge, and in no part
apparently was there any obstacle likely to prevent direct communication either
with the southern shores of Moreton Bay or with the banks of the
Brisbane.[*]</p>
<blockquote>[* Cunningham's Gap lies fifty miles south-west from Brisbane and
sixty miles west of Point Danger.]</blockquote>
<h4>THE RETURN ROUTE</h4>
<p>Cunningham now began his preparations for his return home. He felt quite
unable at this stage of the expedition to carry out his original plan of
exploring westward from the point which he now had reached, and on 16th June he
left Logan's Vale on his homeward journey and in nine miles reached the
northern skirts of Canning Downs. In a southerly course over these he crossed a
winding creek with steep, soft banks, which flowed westward through the downs
and which he thought fell into Condamine's River.[*] His route passed through
fine trees of red gum (<i>Eucalyptus robusta</i>) and swamp-oak
(<i>Casuarina</i>) until, having completed fifteen miles, he halted at a chain
of small ponds. On the 17th he gave the men and horses a rest. Lat.
28&deg;21'17" S., long. 152&deg;02' E., mean height above the sea, 1,567
feet.</p>
<blockquote>[* On this day he passed close to the site of
Warwick.]</blockquote>
<p>Breaking up his camp on the 18th at eight o'clock, he started again and
reached a mossy plain which ran to the south-east, having a swamp-oak creek
winding through its centre. On arriving on the bank of this watercourse, which
he crossed, marks of natives were seen. After seven miles the party rested
here, and it was noticed that the banks of each side on the creek were studded
with fragments of granite in which were pieces of quartz. At sunset Cunningham
found they were 1,854 feet above the sea. A mile farther, on June 19th, they
descended between large detached blocks of rock to the channel of a brisk
rivulet, which had a considerable dip to the south and flowed among masses of
granite, "forming many a strange grotesque figure." Fording the river again
with difficulty, the route now led them to the eastward, and here the explorers
met with a narrow but deep creek which ran from that direction to the rivulet.
After crossing it they ascended lofty hills on the western side, and encamped
for the night beside a stream falling over some granite rocks.</p>
<p>At eight o'clock next morning they again started in a southerly direction,
and at the sixth mile an extensive view was obtained of lofty, detached hills
beyond which rose the Mount Warning Range, whose cone, however, was not
visible. At three o'clock, to rest the horses, Cunningham halted on higher
ground than he had passed over since leaving the Liverpool Range above Hunter's
River, the situation of his tent by calculation being 2,592 feet above "the
seacoast at Cape Byron," which bore east ninety miles from the encampment. Here
the party remained during continuous wet weather, which ultimately cleared on
the evening of the 23rd.</p>
<p>On June 24th, after following a course towards the east-south-east, they
crossed the stream, which by now had become exceedingly rapid, at a ford
discovered by one of the men; and passed over a succession of lofty ranges
(part of the main or Great Dividing Range), heavily timbered with gum-trees,
beneath which grew large masses of ferns and plants frequently seen at Five
Islands (Illawarra). On quitting these forests, open scrubs and spongy swamps
lay in their path, and at noon of June 25th, at a black, sterile spot on these
granite mountains, Cunningham took his bearings, and found that he was 2,969
feet above the sea level, in lat. 28&deg;44'48" S. Five miles from here he
descended into a swampy valley and pitched his tents. On the 26th advance was
stopped by the roughness of the country, which became appalling. "Large
detached masses of granite of every shape towering above each other, and in
many instances standing in almost tottering positions, constituted a barrier
before us; beyond these a deep ravine formed a curve from E. to S.W., which was
itself bounded by a rocky ridge at least 250 feet high." Observing an opening
to the northward Cunningham followed a running stream in that direction which
(although the party had travelled eleven miles) brought them back to within two
miles of their last camp, only a rocky ridge separating them from it.</p>
<p>By still following the small stream, at an early hour on the 27th they
reached a point two miles farther north, and, after passing round the northern
end of a formidable ridge, turned westward through brushy forest composed of
stringy-bark, honeysuckle (<i>Banksia compar</i>), and cypress. At the twelfth
mile, descending in a south-west direction to a level flat, the tired men
reached the reedy bank of a rivulet, "which at our eighth mile we had quitted
on its passing southerly through a broken gap in the western stony ridge where,
doubtless augmented by other streams, it appears to be Macintyre's Brook, which
we had forded on the 30th ultimo 60 miles to the westward; the elevation of its
bed above the sea being little more than 800 feet. Here the mean height on
which stood our tents was 2,254 feet."On passing this rivulet Cunningham tried
a course to the south-west along a continuation of the flat to the base of a
forest ridge, and stopped at an early hour of the day (on 28th) to allow the
farrier daylight to shoe the pack-horses (in lat. 28&deg;55' S.), where a
narrow valley provided both water and grass.</p>
<p>June 29th. "The barometer showed that we had ascended 330 feet since the
morning. By far the sharpest frost we had experienced on this journey. Our
thermometer, fully exposed about sunrise stood at 25&deg;, and ice one-fourth
of an inch thick crusted the surface of stagnant pools in the rocky
watercourses.</p>
<p>Pushing southerly again, Cunningham soon was obliged to turn to the
north-west--"a deep glen, at least 100 yards wide, with yawning, perpendicular,
rocky sides and a small river[*] at its stony bottom running to W.," cutting
him off from all communication with the country to the southward. Whilst his
party kept along the ridges to the north-west, he sent one of his men to skirt
the ravine and to look for a slope to the bed of the river by which they might
descend and reach the opposite or southern hills. This was found about a mile
away, and, as the day was advancing, their course was altered to south-west
again and they soon arrived at the grassy slope. The latitude, from an
observation taken at noon on the upper edge of the ravine, was 28&deg;59'56"
S., and "as this," says Cunningham, "is nearly the parallel of the creek on
which we had rested on the 26th of last month, and in the neighbourhood of
Dumaresq's River, there can be no doubt about the water of the glen, which we
had found flowing briskly to westward at a higher level of 650 ft., being one
of its tributaries."</p>
<blockquote>[* The Glen River.--Note in MS.]</blockquote>
<p>He continues: "On 30th June our passage over this shallow stream was not
easily effected, for its bed upon examination was found so rocky and irregular
that it became unsafe to lead a laden horse across its channel, the baggage
here being conveyed over on the men's shoulders." The course to the
west-south-west--on climbing the hills from the bed of the glen--now led over
high ridges and narrow valleys. At the sixth mile a valley was seen lying about
east and west, and through which flowed a river skirted with swamp-oaks. The
stream was found to be fifty yards wide, running to the westward and abounding
in water-fowl. After crossing a stony fall to its left bank the party encamped
on a spot where the luxuriant pasture, so necessary for the worn-out horses,
induced Cunningham to remain for the whole of the next day. The river took its
rise in the mountains to the northward and eastward at an elevation of nearly
3,000 feet above the sea, and from its size and tendency he at once identified
it. It was the Dumaresq River, which he had forded to the westward on the 28th
of the preceding month. It formed a handsome reach in front of their tents
three-fourths of a mile in length by about fifty yards in breadth, and had an
average depth of twelve feet. By observation he fixed this part of the river as
being in lat. 29&deg;1'14" S., long. 151&deg;31'30" E. Its height above the sea
was 1,040 feet.</p>
<p>July 2-3. "Having remarked from the hills...that the country lying in our
direct line of route to the southward was altogether impassable, I proposed to
trace the river through the vale to the westward with the hopes that we should
be enabled to pursue our course homeward in a more direct line." Some of his
people who walked down the vale in quest of game noticed that the river at
first inclined north of west and afterwards bent to the southward. "We
accordingly," he tells us, "proceeded along its left bank, which in a mile
inclined with the vale to N.W., the latter becoming larger, presenting wider
flats of good grass, on the opposite bank from which the boundary hills
continued lofty, stony and thickly wooded, and receded considerably to the
northward. At the third mile, a stream from north by east, after passing
through a gap in the mountainous land, joined the Dumaresq, which here bends
westward and eventually south-west showing by its increased width of 60 to 70
yards and more regular depth and the length of its reaches how much it had
profited by the confluence with a stream which was evidently the Glen River
that had been passed two days before."</p>
<p>Open, thickly-wooded flats, one or two miles wide, extended along each bank,
on which were very big blue-gum trees. The travelling proved so easy that
Cunningham says he "ventured to extend our day's journey to fourteen miles,
which the horses have accomplished with great ease."</p>
<p>"We halted on the river at a part where the breadth across to the opposite
bank (which was perpendicular and of a reddish earth) was not less than 100
yards. The flats on the opposite side were on fire, and, as we remarked patches
in flames near us, it was evident there were natives in the neighbourhood. The
river appears to continue its course to the southward and westward towards an
obviously lower country through which our route to-morrow will lie. Our dogs
caught an emu on the flats, and the anglers had scarcely cast their hooks into
the river, which at this part appeared very deep, than their success commenced.
Several fish of the cod of all the western rivers were caught in the course of
the evening, of which one weighed 15 lbs."</p>
<p>July 3rd. "A very cloudy morning with every sign of rain at sunrise: the
wind, freshening at S.W., dispelled the clouds and at noon a fine day appeared.
We continued our journey about 7 miles in a S.W. direction down the river, when
the valley, taking a decided bend to W.N.W. and N.W., turned the course of the
river in that direction. We therefore quitted this fine stream, and, pursuing a
line of route to S.W., arrived (at our ninth mile) upon a small patch of plain,
the lat. of which proved to be 29&deg;12'03" S. Onward we passed, over several
stone forest ridges and narrow valleys, for about three miles, when, observing
from S.E. to S.S.E. before us a lofty, broken country, I deemed it prudent to
halt...our tents were therefore pitched in a barren valley giving us plenty of
water, but our horses had scarcely any grass.</p>
<p>"Before sunset I climbed a high hill in front of our encampment to observe
the country, and on reaching its summit had a fine view. A crescent of lofty,
rocky ranges appeared to stretch from east to south-east, thence to south-west.
As these were fronted by a deep ravine, the whole presented so precipitous and
savage a feature as forbade any attempt to pass beyond them to the southward.
I, however, remarked that as all the hills appeared to terminate to northward
and westward, a course in that direction for about four miles would probably
lead me to a moderately surfaced country, over which horses could travel to the
southward and westward without difficulty. On quitting the sterile valley in
which we had halted, we pursued a steady course to the northward on the morning
of the 4th, and...in about five miles perceived that we had advanced
sufficiently beyond the northern termination of the loftier ranges to allow us
to stand more to the westward. In another mile...we shaped our course to
southward and westward, which we pursued without interruption during the
succeeding twenty miles.</p>
<p>"Throughout an extent of 13 miles the timbers were of ironbark, box and
white-gum...the soil poor and unproductive of grass, and, as no rain had fallen
for many months, it was with difficulty that we discovered sufficient water for
ourselves and horses. At length we crossed, on the afternoon of the 5th, a
stream flowing to southward and westward, to which I gave the name of
Anderson's Brook[*] in compliment to my friend of the medical staff of the
colony. Beyond the stream the grasses appear altogether of a brighter hue. At
noon of the 5th our lat. was 29&deg;24'09" S., and at the close of day we
rested on a well-watered patch of good grass.</p>
<blockquote>[* The Severn of modern maps.]</blockquote>
<h4>BURRELL RIVER[*]</h4>
<blockquote>[* Part of the Macintyre River.]</blockquote>
<p>6th July. "Upon passing onward to westward through open forest about 3 miles
we reached the right bank of a deep river about 30 yards wide and trending to
the N.N.W. This river, which originates in the mountainous country at N.N.E.,
bore signs of being a channel by which vast bodies of water are carried to the
N.W. interior...at this season it is little other than a chain of large,
canal-like ponds separated by shallows of gravel of which its outer banks are
formed...This stream which was named Burrell River, doubtless augmented by
Anderson's Brook in a few miles further to westward, falls into Peel's
River."</p>
<p>Cunningham continued his journey for twelve miles through gentle, open
forest with good, sweet grass, and then passed the eastern extreme of a cypress
ridge, where again large masses of granite rock were seen. From a spot
southward of Burrell River an extensive view of the line of country lying west
of Shoal Bay was obtained. "Of the capacity of this indentation, discovered by
Captain Flinders in 1799," says Cunningham, "we know little, as it appears not
to be visited by vessels, probably on account of the character of its title and
waters." He describes the inland country at this point, its soil and timbers,
and says: "At our ninth mile the forest ground became broken and a breccia or
puddingstone appeared, and at length we descended to a rocky creek having
little water, but so thickly brushed with tea-tree (<i>Melaleuca</i>) and
<i>Leptospermum</i> as to oblige us to cut a path for the horses."</p>
<p>Difficult country now obliged him to bear away on the 7th to north-west
among ridges, from which he descended to a narrow, woody valley immediately
bounded on the north by Masterton's Range (observed on May 23rd) and watered by
a broad, reedy creek, "evidently the channel by which the streams we have of
late crossed pass to the westward." He had accomplished sixteen miles when he
came to a part of the valley where there was good grass, and there he directed
the tents to be pitched.</p>
<p>July 8th. The marks of natives wandering in quest of food were noticed on
the timber through which the travellers passed on this day. There were steps on
the tree trunks, evidently cut to aid the blacks in climbing, although the bush
furnished few opossum and apparently the natives had been seeking larvae or
pupae, upon which they must chiefly have lived. These were most often found in
the knot at the upper limbs of a straight-grown box. The latitude of the
encampment here on the 8th is given as 29&deg;34'02" S., longitude (from the
meridian of Logan's Vale) being 150&deg;35'50" E. Cunningham writes: "In order
to avoid a rocky part of the valley through which the channel of the reedy
creek[*] wound westerly, I pursued a course to the S.W. over stony boundary
hills, and passed through a barren, scrubby wood productive of many curious
plants. In this sterile forest, which afforded me many specimens, we were not a
little surprised to meet with a shed of most temporary erection, 24 feet long
by about six feet broad, and formed by eight strong posts of young trees having
their bases well secured in the earth, supporting a horizontal wattled roof,
slightly thatched with gum-tree boughs, about ten feet from the ground. Upon
examination, it was evident that it had been set up by white men who knew well
the use and application of the axe, and from the appearance of the ends of the
timbers we judged it to have stood so for four months. There were several small
bark huts of natives in the neighbourhood...I arrived at the conclusion that
the persons who had erected this screen from the sun (for it formed no
protection from rain or bad weather, being narrow and open on all sides), had
been cedar-cutters, who, having escaped from Port Macquarie, distant E.S.E. 165
miles, had joined a tribe of natives and were wandering at large through this
distant interior."</p>
<blockquote>[* He was now again close to the site of Warialda.]</blockquote>
<h4>GWYDIR RIVER</h4>
<p>July 9th. Cunningham crossed his outward track about the seventh mile of
this day's stage, having ascertained that he had reached the parallel Of
29&deg;35' S. A very open country now was traversed, thinly timbered, but
almost destitute of water. At the seventeenth mile, near the base of a
remarkable range seen in the outward journey, several other points of known
country were recognized. A halt was made at dusk (on the 9th) at a small creek.
The report runs: "We had no sooner quitted the ground on which we had encamped,
than at a distance not exceeding 200 yards we came upon the right bank of a
stream forming a very handsome reach of deep water, seventy yards wide, with
steep, soft bank, and bending round the northern extreme of the lofty range to
open country at N.W. This river we traced on its right bank upwards to a safe
ford, by which we crossed to its opposite side over a bed of gravel measuring
146 yards in breadth.[*] Above the bed of the river, which the prolonged season
of drought had reduced to a very low level, we remarked the traces of floods 55
feet in the branches of the swamp-oaks skirting its channel. When, therefore,
in seasons of great rains, this river is swollen...the rush of the impetuous
torrent bearing logs of timber down its channel to a depressed interior must be
awfully grand!"</p>
<blockquote>[* Cunningham crossed the Gwydir on fallen swamp-oaks on his
homeward journey to the westward of his former crossing.]</blockquote>
<p>This river, named by Cunningham in honour of Lord Gwydir, has its source in
the New England tableland near Armidale, between Guyra and Uralla. From either
of these places to Moree is roughly 200 miles. A few miles below Moree the
river disappears and its waters spreading through numerous watercourses and
swamps are carried into the Barwon. sixty miles further west and thence to the
Darling.</p>
<h4>HORTON'S RIVER</h4>
<p>Continuing his journey southwards, Cunningham on July 11th came to another
river which trended to northward, "having so much the character, magnitude and
appearance of the Peel," that he says he might have confounded it with Mr.
Oxley's discovery, which he thought it joined. He traced it for about a mile
and called it Horton's River, and the valley through which it flowed he named
Wilmot Vale, while the lofty hills bounding this vale on the west he called
Drummond's Range. Horton's River took its rise in the highlands connected with
Hardwick's Range (of Oxley), and on the 12th the explorers, in the hope of
finding a less difficult country to traverse, turned into another valley "at a
remarkable break in the ranges, through whose centre a tributary of Horton's
River meandered." They then resumed a south-west course and spent the night in
a solitary spot amid very steep, stony hills, where the valley grew narrow
towards the south-west. To the westward, not ten miles off, Hardwicke's Range
towered above their encampment.</p>
<p>On the 13th there was a hard frost for an hour after sunrise. From this spot
for two days the route southerly led over very rugged, mountainous country,
during which the horses could only with great exertion gain the summits of the
principal ranges at an elevation of 2,500 feet. At noon on the 16th, from a
forest ridge, Cunningham had an extensive view from south-east by way of south
and west-south-west of Mitchell's River (or Namoi). Mount Tetley, the rugged
outlines of Arbuthnot's Range, and points of Vansittart's Hills, on the
north-west side of Liverpool Plains, were also recognized. On the 17th the
party descended the hills, and, reaching level country, pursued a direct course
to the southward. The country lying north from Liverpool Plains was composed of
flats, wooded lands, and scrub watered by shallow channels. After nine miles
they reached a flat where they found a water-hole of stagnant water, and were
glad to rest there. On the trunks of the trees around them they noticed marks
made by natives with an iron tomahawk, which, says Cunningham, reminded them
that they were approaching the abode of civilized man. At their 18th mile they
arrived at a more extensive flat, which they crossed and believed to be
Barrow's Valley of Mr. Oxley. After encamping on the margin of a wood without
finding water, they started again at sunrise, and about four miles farther, by
following a southerly course, they made the right bank of Field's River, which,
having received the waters of Mitchell's River, now formed a channel within
steep banks eighty yards wide. Tents were pitched on the opposite bank, and its
situation by observation was found to be lat. 30&deg;54'14" S., and long.
150&deg;10' E.</p>
<p>Describing the home-coming of this expedition, Cunningham writes as follows:
"July 20-28. On leaving Field's River, which had taken a bend to eastward, we
resumed our course to the southward, and, having travelled 27 miles...we
reached the northern outskirts of Liverpool Plains soon after noon of the 21st.
Over these spacious levels we travelled 25 miles to the southward, almost to
the northern base of the Dividing Range, before we found water for ourselves or
our horses; and, after resting the whole of the 24th, we climbed over the
Dividing Range by a practicable pass to the westward of that part at which we
had crossed it in May. Pursuing our route to the eastward about fifteen miles,
we intersected Dartbrook and on 28th July returned to Segenhoe, on Hunter's
River, having been absent 13 weeks, in which space we had travelled over 800
miles of country."</p>
<p>Summing up the results of this journey he says" "To the colonist the chief
gain is the discovery of pastoral country lying north from the parallel Of
31&deg;S. to almost the shores of Moreton Bay in 27&deg;30' S., and between the
meridian of 150&deg; E. and the coast-line; while to the geographer this tour
has furnished material by which 200 statute miles of previously unknown
interior may be added to the general charts of the country." He adds: "Five
times only in the progress of the journey were the aborigines seen, when,
either by alarm excited by the strange appearance of the packhorses or other
circumstances, our communication was entirely prevented...the few that suffered
us to view them at a distance appeared to be tall, well-formed persons of
rather athletic features, possessing the same description of weapons as those
who people the shores of our colony, with whom they appeared to be identified
in their wandering habits and the manner by which they find their food in the
trees and their path through the forest."</p>
<p>Cunningham gave his people and horses a week's rest at Segenhoe and left
there on August 5th to journey back to Parramatta by way of Bathurst. Owing to
the ruggedness of the country near Mount Dangar, round the south-west base of
which their route lay, the party did not reach their old camp at Dabee on the
Cudgegong until August 16th. Having crossed Smith's River they fell in with
ravines, and were compelled to turn back and to seek a route to Dabee by
passing through Bylong Valley, which had been found by William Lee some time
previously. From Dabee they proceeded to Bathurst, where they arrived on the
23rd, and here again they rested, finally reaching Parramatta on the evening of
the 31st. Next day Cunningham waited upon Governor Darling and laid before him
an outline of the country through which he had penetrated and the report of his
proceedings as related above.</p>
<p>Major Mitchell, in his first expedition (1831-1832), ascertained that the
rivers discovered by Cunningham were sources of the Darling. In his course
northward Mitchell reached a stream called Kindur (the Gwydir) by the natives,
which he considered to be the river discovered by Cunningham. Crossing this
river, and travelling northward, in 29&deg;2' S. he came upon the Karaula or
Dumaresq. Tracing it down, he found that it joined the Gwydir only eight miles
below the point where he had crossed the latter stream, and that, after
uniting, they flowed to the southwest finally, as he discovered in a subsequent
journey, joining the Darling.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVIII</h2>
<h3>FURTHER EXPLORATIONS IN QUEENSLAND. DETERMINATION OF CUNNINGHAM'S GAP</h3>
<p><i><b>(From Cunningham's Report to General Darling)</b></i></p>
<p>In 1828 Cunningham renewed a request already made to the authorities at home
that he might be allowed to return to his native land in the following year. He
informed the Treasury, however, that before leaving Sydney he should visit both
Moreton Bay and Tasmania, and accordingly, after visiting Illawarra, the pine
ridges of the Macquarie, and one or two other localities, he embarked in June
in the ship "Lucy Ann" for Moreton Bay. She touched at Port Macquarie, and in
due course Cunningham and Fraser, the Colonial Botanist, who sailed with him,
arrived at Amity Point. Anchor was cast in Rainbow Reach,[*] and on July 1st
the botanists landed in Moreton Bay.</p>
<blockquote>[* Named after H.M.S. Rainbow.]</blockquote>
<p>On July 27th they started with Captain Logan, commandant of the settlement,
for the Mount Warning Ranges in order to examine the discoveries of Captain
Rous.[*]--who when sailing from Moreton Bay in 1827 had passed the entrance of
the Tweed River and had called it the Clarence. He afterwards wrote: "The River
Clarence more properly the Tweed discovered by Mr. Oxley...is in lat.
28&deg;9'. Mount Warning is very conspicuous...at least 20 miles inland beyond
the place allotted to it on the maps."[**] Rous next discovered the Richmond
River in lat. 28&deg;53' and examined Shoal Bay. He steered past the entrance
of the Clarence River, however, without seeing it.</p>
<blockquote>[* Captain the Hon. H. J. Rous, of H.M.S. "Rainbow", was a son of
the first Lord Stradbroke and when in command of H.M.S. "Pique", in 1835, he
sailed his ship home for 1,500 miles without a rudder. The north-east county of
New South Wales is named after him. He is better known to-day as the Admiral
Rous who exercised so much influence in English racing circles.]</blockquote>
<blockquote>[** Wilton's "Quarterly Australian Journal," Vol. I.]</blockquote>
<p>In this journey Logan's party visited Mount Lindesay, and as Cunningham
wished to reach the Gap seen by him in 1827, they attempted to journey thither
by a westward route but failed, and Cunningham finally investigated the pass
from Limestone Station (now Ipswich) alone.</p>
<p>Beginning their journey from Brisbane they took four weeks' provisions for
the eight persons who composed the party and left the river opposite the
settlement. Their route led over a line of road which lately had been marked
out and ran in a southerly direction to Cowper's Plains. To these plains salt
water flows through Oxley's Canoe Creek from the Brisbane River. The plains
stretched about a mile westward of the explorer's route, and, as the
pack-bullocks were heavily weighted, they halted at Canoe Creek, at a part of
it sufficiently distant from its point of connexion with the Brisbane to afford
fresh water, and pitched their tents on the bank. To the southward of the camp
the country was alternately flat and forest ground, in which honeysuckle
(<i>Banksia compar</i>) and tea-tree were interspersed. The barometer at sunset
showed that the land was of so low a level that its elevation above the
seashore was scarcely recognizable.</p>
<h4>BIRNAM RANGE AND LOGAN RIVER</h4>
<p>On the following day richer soil was met with, producing good grass. In the
labyrinths of bush several dry channels were found all dipping eastward, and at
last the party came upon the Logan River in latitude 27&deg;28' S. This stream,
after another course of twenty miles, discharges its waters on the southern
shores of Moreton Bay opposite Stradbroke Island. At the spot where they
crossed it, however, it was nothing more than a murmuring brook. Farther on
they came to native huts that had been occupied recently and again met with the
River Logan and followed it southward for two miles, when it was observed to
take a bend "from the westward"...They then mounted the summit of a lateral
ridge which declined to the westward southerly and traced the ridge in this
direction till the close of the day, halting upon it at a spot that was found
to be quite destitute of water. After diligent search some was obtained at the
foot of the range about a mile distant. On these hills, to which the name of
Birnam Range was given, there were seen interesting plants hitherto unknown to
Cunningham and fragments of rock, the latter evidently having been used by
natives to polish their spears. Often the stone was perfectly white, and
although it contained clay appeared to consist of granulated quartz. There were
also numerous footpaths, which showed that the blacks crossed the Birnam Range
in their wanderings from the southern bushland towards the coast regions.</p>
<p>On the morning Of July 28th at the south base of the ridge a passage was
found cut through the bush, and tracks of natives as they passed and repassed
could plainly be seen. From the south-west side of Birnam Range the road
improved, leading to a pretty stretch of plain about a mile in breadth by
perhaps four in length from east to west, called by Captain Logan Letitia's
Plain.[*] It was watered on the western side by the Logan River, which was now
seen winding northwards round the western base of the range. On the south side
of Letitia's Plain a lagoon of considerable depth and about a quarter of a mile
long appeared to be fed entirely by an overflow from the Logan. While Mr.
Fraser was engaged in taking up the knobbed roots of a beautiful water-plant
[**]--a buck bean-that had unrolled its heart-shaped leaves to the sun's rays
on the surface of the water, Cunningham observed the latitude at its southern
extremity, which, "proving 27&deg;56'05" S., placed our position on the chart
271 geographical miles south of Brisbane Town, and its longitude by account 31
west of the meridian of that settlement, viz. 152&deg;58' E."</p>
<blockquote>[* All three, Logan, Cunningham, and Fraser, seem to have had a
share in naming the various parts of the country now seen.]</blockquote>
<blockquote>[** Cunningham writes: "This fine plant I examined on the spot, and
was, with Mr. Fraser, much gratified to find that it was an undescribed species
of that division of the Linnaean genus <i>Menyanthes</i>, which now constitutes
the distinct one named <i>Villarsia</i> by M. Ventenat."]</blockquote>
<p>The journey southward was continued by the side of the river, along a path
overshadowed on the fight by a dense thicket of vines and leading over ground
liable to occasional inundation. The country on the opposite bank of the river
appeared altogether more open and better adapted for travelling, and "it became
desirable to cross it at any part where the brush would permit the descent of
the bullocks to the bed of the stream. A ford was discovered at our third mile
from the lagoon. We therefore passed over to the level ground on the western
bank and then, finding the day far spent, it was deemed advisable to rest."
During the whole of the following day, July 29th, the men were confined to
their tents by heavy rain blown over the mountain ranges by the prevailing
westerly winds. When at last the sun burst forth Cunningham was able to take an
azimuth, as also the latitude at noon. "The former gave a variation of
8&deg;35' E., while the latter showed us that we were within 2' of the parallel
Of 28&deg; S. The results placed our encamping ground 320 feet above the shores
of Moreton Bay."</p>
<p>The morning of the 30th being fine, the journey was resumed to the
south-south-west--a route shaped in the direction taken by the Logan's course.
The party now travelled over a rich flat, and among the plants they observed
native birdsfoot trefoil (<i>Lotus australis</i>). This forest flat extended
north-west for several miles towards a lofty mountain which, Cunningham says,
was marked on the old charts as High Peak,[*] an elevated cone forming a
striking feature of the landscape. Men they had completed the third mile of
their journey across the flat they came to the foot of a grassy hill, under the
eastern base of which the river winds from the south. On climbing the hill in
company with Captain Logan and Fraser, Cunningham found that " it commanded a
very fine and extensive view, embodying as much variety of feature to be met
with in any known part of New South Wales."</p>
<blockquote>[* Note in MS--"Recently named Flinders Peak." It will be seen on
Flinders' chart in Chapter XVI.]</blockquote>
<p>Immediately beneath them a grassy vale stretched southward, bounded on each
side by forest ridges clothed with grassy verdure to their summits. Through
this vale the windings of the Logan could be traced for several miles flowing
from a hilly country at the south, where writes Cunningham: "We subsequently
discovered that stream originated." The view to the south-south-west and
south-west disclosed a bold and singularly precipitous range of mountain peaks
distant about twenty-five miles, the adjacent country being broken and
irregular.</p>
<h4>TOWARDS MOUNT LINDESAY</h4>
<p>He continues: "It was to the base of these peaks that Captain Logan (who had
thought one or other of them to be the cone of Mount Warning) had penetrated
last year from Brisbane Town and...had attempted vainly...to gain the summit of
the highest point. A simple reference, however, to the chart of the
coast...showed me that we were at least fifteen geographical miles to the
westward of the meridian assigned to that lofty peak by navigators, and that
therefore unless we...agree with Captain Rous, who asserts that it is actually
situated at least twenty miles further inland than the situation allotted to it
on the maps[*] (which cannot possibly be the case), it is abundantly obvious
that the lofty points before us bearing S.W. and S.S.W. are perfectly distinct
from the range seen daily from seaward by the passing mariner, of which Mount
Warning of that great navigator, the immortal Cook, is the most elevated
pinnacle."</p>
<blockquote>[* Vide "Wilton's Quarterly Australian Journal," Vol. I, No. iv, P.
33.]</blockquote>
<p>Making their descent from this hill, which was named Mount Dunsinane, the
travellers pursued their journey southward for five miles through the valley
(Erris Vale) to a small, round, isolated "rocky mount" standing about 150 feet
above the plain of the vale. At the foot of this remarkable hill (Mount Edgar)
immediately on the bank of the river, they again rested. As he climbed the
"rocky mount" to take a few bearings, Cunningham observed that its eastern side
and summit were composed of "trap rock in large masses, while the western
slopes were studded with basaltic columns of regular prismatic figure of five
sides, of which some were 4 to 5 feet in height...The original position of
these columns, which was doubtless an erect one, appeared to have been
disturbed by some violent concussion, as many were thrown down on their sides;
whilst others, by being wedged up, stood so nearly upright as not to incline
more than a few degrees out of a vertical line."</p>
<p>Finding this hill too low to allow him to make further observations, he
descended to the tents. On arriving at the encampment, at the close of the day,
he saw a rising smoke at the foot of the hill, and immediately afterwards made
out two or three natives upon the summit, whither they had retired in haste,
leaving their fire, so that they might watch the movements of their new
visitors. Being anxious to meet them, Cunningham again went up the hill, but on
reaching the top found that they had fled down the opposite side, and in all
probability had crossed the river and taken refuge in the bush on the right
bank. He writes: "An old man who had concealed himself behind a tree near the
bottom of the hill ran off (upon our passing the spot) in that direction in a
state of dreadful apprehension. Such was the alarm induced by our presence that
it totally prevented that friendly parley which we wished to have brought
about. At their fire we found the bags and little paraphernalia of the women,
showing clearly with what precipitous haste these savages had urged their
flight, which had not even afforded them a moment to gather their few articles
of economy together. Around were quantities of the large seed of that
exceedingly ornamental tree of close woods called chestnut[*] at Moreton Bay
(<i>Castanospermum australe</i>. A. Cunn.) Upon these nuts the few natives who
wander through these lonely regions chiefly subsist. Like the English chestnut
they contain some saccharine and much farinaceous matter, and by being well
roasted are rendered easy of digestion." At about two miles south from this
encampment the Logan bends from the eastward, watering on its course a patch of
plain originally seen by Lieutenant Innes, of His Majesty's 57th Regiment, who,
during his residence at Moreton Bay, frequently undertook bush excursions.
Captain Logan accordingly attached that officer's name to it, and so it now
appears on the chart.</p>
<blockquote>[* "This tree, than which there is no plant indigenous to the
shores of Moreton Bay and adjacent country upon which the eye rests with
greater pleasure, constitutes a genus perfectly distinct from any yet
published, and, independent of its highly ornamental habit and refreshing shade
afforded by densely-leaved branches, its nuts are produced in pods in such
abundance as to be ere long worthy of the attention of the farmer, as its fruit
would form nutritive food. The tree affects a rich and moist soil."--Note in
MS.]</blockquote>
<p>Cunningham resumes: "The valley through which we continued our journey south
(named by Captain Logan, Erris Vale) continues from the hill about five miles
and is then bounded on the south by forest hills. On a course southerly we
penetrated a rising country and...at length again sighted the river which had
wound from the eastward...On the 1st of August, in picking our way to the
south, we crossed the Logan, much diminished in size, and, after a fruitless
attempt to continue to the southward, found ourselves so hemmed in by steep,
lofty, wooded ridges that we were obliged to find the river again,[*] which we
traced westerly until...divers streamlets indicated our approach to its source.
On the 2nd August we climbed the hills and pursued a course to westward...Early
in the afternoon of this day we descended to the flat or valley (the Vale of
Erris), where there was abundance of good water, and I directed the tents to be
pitched."</p>
<blockquote>[* Here they evidently retraced their steps.]</blockquote>
<p>The camping place he had chosen was only a short distance from the spot
where Captain Logan had bivouacked in the previous year. Cunningham and his
companions were now within three miles of the high range of mountains, which he
had seen first from Mount Dunsinane, "whose broad, dome-like summits and
conical peaks, for the most part bare and now fully open to view, presented a
fine example of bold and rugged scenery such as is not to be found in any
hitherto explored territory." It was their intention to penetrate no further
than to the base of this colossal range, of which Captain Logan still thought
the peak of Mount Warning formed a part. The bullocks, however, needed a rest
and they decided to spend the spare time in examining the mountain group and
afterwards to proceed towards the Gap or opening in the Dividing Range which
Cunningham had discovered in June, 1827.</p>
<h4>MOUNT LINDESAY</h4>
<p>He now writes: "The morning of the 3rd of August, dawned with a singular
clearness, and, as its temperature was unusually low and bracing (35&deg;) we
were induced to quit our tents at an early hour to commence the interesting
labours of the day. We proceeded from our encamping ground at 6 o'clock on our
journey to the summit of the highest mountain the easternmost of the range
bearing from the tents S. W. by W. 3 miles...over an extent of thinly-timbered
flat recently burnt by the natives and stretching nearly two miles from the
base of the first range of hills...the back of which we gained by climbing a
sharp acclivity.</p>
<p>"Travelling along the ridge about another half-mile, we ascended to the base
of the mountain, whence the difficulties of the ascent commenced. Large masses
of rock forming large blocks and shelving slabs...blocked the path; among these
flourished luxuriantly many tufty plants. Fraser and I culled several
previously unknown species to enrich our collections. With considerable
exertion I climbed to a point...of the mountain where the face became
precipitous and our advance attended with so much danger that I deemed it
prudent to proceed no farther, especially as I had attained a height from which
I could make necessary observations...Whilst I was occupied in taking a set of
bearings...our indefatigable commandant and Mr. Fraser who had both preceded me
in the ascent continued their journey towards the summit, notwithstanding the
alarming steepness of many parts of the mountain.</p>
<blockquote><i>Cone of Mount Warning</i></blockquote>
<p>"The cone of Mount Warning (respecting the true situation of which we were
divided in opinion) I was gratified to see distinctly amidst a group of
mountains nearer the coast-line and bearing E. by S. distant from 25 to 30
miles. This most fully confirmed me in what I had already advanced respecting
its position; its bearing...carrying it as far easterly as the meridian under
which...Captains Cook and Flinders have long ago placed this most striking of
all landmarks on this coast to passing seamen. It was now Captain Logan clearly
saw his mistake in supposing one of the peaks of the mountains about us, which
cannot be perceived from seaward, to be the Mount Warning of Cook.[*]</p>
<blockquote>[* Mount Warning is 3,300 feet; it dominates the whole of the
Northern country of New South Wales, and is visible even from One Tree Hill,
Brisbane.]</blockquote>
<p>"A range distant scarcely ten miles and stretching from east-by-north to
south-east, of bold appearance, was named Macpherson's Range in compliment to
Major Macpherson, of His Majesty's 39th Regiment, whilst in its southern
extreme a very bluff rocky head and a rounded mount or hummock about its centre
received the names of Coke and Burrough respectively.</p>
<p>"Along the eastern base of Macpherson's Range I could trace a deep ravine
bounded on its eastern side by a vertical wall of rocks of very rugged aspect.
This ravine, at the suggestion of Mr. Fraser, was named Glen Lyon; and through
it ran a stream (indicated by a line of mist throughout its length) which
doubtless falls southerly into the channel of a river seen by Captain Logan
from the summit of this mountain, and, from the direction of its course towards
the sea at south-east, is doubtless the Richmond of Captain Rous, of H.M.S.
"Rainbow".</p>
<p>"To the E. of Glen Lyon, the entire country extending to the lofty ridges
connected with Mount Warning group appeared broken and irregular. A lofty
mountain bearing N. by E. five miles received from Captain Logan the title of
Clanmorris, whilst to a lofty wooded peak lying about ten miles further to the
north I attached the name of my friend, Lieut. Hughes, of the Royal Staff
Corps.[*]</p>
<blockquote>[* Hughes's Peak.]</blockquote>
<p>"At S.S.E. five miles a very precipitous rocky head, seemingly inaccessible
from any point around us, was named Mount Hooker, in honour of the mutual
friend of Mr. Fraser and myself, the Regius Professor of Botany in the
University of Glasgow. Far to the north other points were distinctly discerned,
particularly the towering peak of Captain Flinders now bearing his
name...Having noted all the more prominent features of the country around,
excepting at S. and S.S.W., in which direction my position on the mountain
prevented my observation, I employed myself investigating the scrubby,
blighted, vegetable productions about me, and among the many described
well-known plants I gathered several yet unpublished...I also set up the
barometer (which I had with much care carried from Brisbane Town)...I had,
however, to regret that in the carriage from the tents to the point at which I
had halted, the instrument had become deranged by some sudden jerk...and thus
rendered perfectly useless." Cunningham afterwards found that this halting
place on Mount Lindesay was 1,500 feet above his encampment. He continues:</p>
<p>"Mr. Fraser had followed the commandant up the very steep face of the
mountain more than double that elevation above me; but, arriving at the base of
a rock nearly perpendicular, without a bush to assist him to pass over it, he
very wisely stopped; and having rested, and contemplated with pleasure the
grandeur of the surrounding scene from so considerable a height (verging on
4,000 feet above the sea), he began his descent. It was not, however without
great difficulty and...on more than one occasion at a great risk of his life
that he found his way back to my station...in a state of considerable
exhaustion.</p>
<p>"Five hours, however, elapsed before the commandant, who also with great
labour had gained the extreme summit of this formidable mountain, returned to
us. It had afforded him a very extensive bird's-eye view of the entire country.
The sea was seen at E.S.E. over the very low country lying between the southern
extreme of the Mount Warning Range and the coast-line; a fine, open, grazing
country breaking into plains was...perceived to the south-west. The traveller
might reach it by passing over twenty miles of broken, brushy country from the
base of the mountain, a few miles from which a river was observed bending its
course to the southward and eastward, which has since been considered by
Captain Logan to be none other than either a branch or the main trunk of the
Richmond, recently discovered by Captain Rous.</p>
<p>"About the close of the day we returned to our tents, amply rewarded for our
exertions by the...observations we had made. The mountain we had visited...was
named Mount Lindesay as a compliment to the officer commanding His Majesty's
39th Regiment in this colony.[*] Our bullocks requiring further rest, we
determined to remain encamped during the whole of the following day (4th Aug.),
whilst Captain Logan was absent on an excursion to ascertain how far a
communication could be opened round the eastern base of Mount Lindesay with the
apparently fine grazing country seen in the south-west from the summit of that
lofty mountain, I was occupied in taking the necessary observations to
determine our situation.</p>
<blockquote>[* It is one of the peaks of the Macpherson Range on the New South
WalesQueensland border, and is situated between Killarney (Queensland) and
Kyogle (New South Wales). Near here the Richmond River has its
source.]</blockquote>
<p>"These gave the following results. Latitude, by a solar meridional altitude,
28&deg;15'21" S., longitude 152&deg;45'45" E., or 16 geographical miles W. of
the meridian of Brisbane Town. Variation of the needle (by azimuth), 11&deg; E.
I also measured a base of 608 yards on an extensive flat near the tents, and,
observing the angles subtended by the summit of Mount Lindesay, ascertained its
perpendicular height over our encampment to be 4,750 feet. To this, upon adding
953 feet, the elevation of the tents above the seashore (as already determined
by the barometer), the mean height of the mountain above the level of the
seashore is shown to be 5,703 feet, which is by far the most elevated point[*]
(measured) that has been hitherto ascended by any European in Australia. In the
evening our laborious commandant returned to the encampment, fully satisfied of
the practicability of marking a road to the country lying to the south-west by
directing its line to leave the Mount Warning Range to the west."</p>
<blockquote>[* The highest peaks in New South Wales are now known to be Mount
Kosciusko, 7,328 feet, and Mount Townsend, 7,260 feet. Mount Lindesay is 4,064
feet.]</blockquote>
<h4>TOWARDS THE DIVIDING RANGE</h4>
<p>On the morning of August 5th, Captain Logan's party left their encampment in
order to travel westerly and attempt to penetrate to the hollow in the back of
the Dividing Range now known as Cunningham's Gap. They were surrounded on all
sides by steep hills and lofty mountainous country and they could only push
their way forward on a northerly course with difficulty. They passed through a
glen bounded westerly by forest hills immediately connected with Mount
Clanmorris, and to the eastward by a steep, rocky-sided ridge overhanging a
brook formed by junction of the creek ("at which last we rested") with the
others which ran briskly through it northerly over a bed of large stones, so
much rounded by water attrition as to render the crossing and recrossing its
channel...too dangerous to risk the lives of the bullocks in the passage. The
laden bullocks were therefore sent round among the hills easterly, and joined
the men again on an open, level patch of forest ground. Cunningham writes: "We
then prosecuted our course to the north-west, climbing...wooded ridges, with an
occasional flat...and observing that all the water-courses dipped easterly.
They therefore threw the rains, that are collected in these hills in a wet
season, into the Logan. From several points in these hills, I took bearings to
a lofty, wooded mount, named last year by Captain Logan in honour of Lieut.
Col. Shadforth, of His Majesty's 57th Regiment as also to a conical-shaped
hill...to the W.S.W. about 15 miles, which also Captain Logan had
named...Wilton's Peak.</p>
<p>Seven miles to the north-west we gained the pitch of the hills, whence we
observed...two miles to the W.N.W. a patch of plain bounded on the western side
by a, ridge of craggy hills. The commandant recognized a point at whose base he
had bivouacked in the progress of last year's excursion. Our oxen having
descended the ridge on its western side with considerable difficulty, owing to
the steepness of the declivity from the several rocky heads and abrupt
terminating bluffs, we soon reached the plain, which we found to be a reedy
flat without a tree, of a springy sponginess to the tread and evidently swampy
in wet weather...The long-protracted droughts of the year had, however, dried
the surface sufficiently to allow our burdened beasts to cross it...to the
channel of a rivulet washing the eastern foot of the craggy hills.</p>
<p>"On the western bank of this stream (which is a tributary to the Logan and
named Teviot Brook[*]) we were very glad to encamp, as the sun had some time
dipped below the western horizon. This plain, or marshy flat, which lies nearly
north and south, is about three miles in length, and is (as already observed)
bounded...by rocky hills of singularly picturesque appearance, named, at the
suggestion of Mr. Fraser, Minto Craigs.</p>
<blockquote>[* Now Teviot River.]</blockquote>
<p>South-westerly, beyond these craggy hills, we had a peep at a part of the
Dividing Range, which...formed a beautiful landscape; and, if anything tended
to give a higher effect to the extremely pleasing scene whilst crossing the
marshy flat, it was the warm tints produced by the radiance of the setting sun
striking upon the naked rocks of the Craigs. Just before we halted, five emus,
who were feeding on the plain, met together and, as if prompted by a curiosity
to know what we were, stalked over the flat after us, preserving, however, a
respectable distance from the dogs. We were all too much engaged to give chase
to them; and, therefore, after following us some distance, they filed off,
retired with some little precipitancy to the wooded lands, and, as if fully
apprehensive of danger, disappeared altogether. A hill of square, tabulated
figure, bearing about north 7 or 8 miles, was last year named, by Captain
Logan, Mount French; and a singularly sharp-pointed cone, wooded to its extreme
summit, and lying to the N.E. about 9 miles, received from me the title of
Knapp's Peak after an esteemed friend at this time attached to the Department
of the Surveyor-General in this colony.</p>
<p>"At an early hour of the morning of the 7th August we broke up our
encampment...Passing the northern extremity of Minto Craigs, we pursued our
course to the north-west...until (in about our fourth mile) we reached another
patch of plain on which I observed the meridional altitude of the sun, which
gave for latitude 28&deg;4'26" S., and showed us that we had arrived at about
the parallel of the mountain gap, which bore west from us...The plain was
flanked on its west and north-west sides by densely-brushed rocky ridges
connected with Mount French, and it appeared extremely doubtful whether we
could penetrate them with the bullocks to the foot of the Dividing Range. We
therefore proposed to halt and employ the remainder of the day in determining
the practicability of effecting a passage through to the westward. About one
o'clock we set up the tents on the edge of the plain, near a pond of
exceedingly fine water.</p>
<p>"Our commandant, attended by two...of the people, undertook to examine the
rocky western ridge, and I in the meantime ascertained our position."</p>
<p>Cunningham named this beautiful plain Dulhunty Plain, as a compliment to
the...family of that name residing in New South Wales. He says, of the land:
"It lies about S.S.W. and N.N.E. and in extent is about five miles in length by
three quarters of a mile in breadth." He found the soil of the plain in all
parts exceedingly rich and fertile and capable of yielding heavy crops of
grain, and, although he thought it was scarcely sound enough for pasturing
sheep, he believed it would make "a fine range of horse and cattle feed."</p>
<p>At the close of the day Captain Logan returned to the camp having climbed
the rocky barrier to the westward, which he found clothed with a thick jungle
of twining plants, so that it was with the utmost difficulty he gained the
height, whence he saw clearly that it was quite impossible to penetrate
westerly to the Dividing Range. He also saw that there was but one path for him
and his companions to travel and that ran to the north-east, in which direction
the country not only appeared more level but was unencumbered by the thickets
that, in many parts, formed a dense jungle for miles, which, adds Cunningham,
"we have repeatedly satisfied ourselves, is not to be passed by laden bullocks
until the axe has fully effected a passage for them."</p>
<p>"On the 8th we stood away to the north-east across Dulhunty's Plain, and in
two miles and a half reached the forest ground watered by the Logan, which had
become a connected stream. In another two miles to the N.E. we entered a second
plain,...containing about 700 acres, to which was given the name of Rattray,
after a relative of Mr. Fraser. As we continued our journey, we could not but
admire the landscape at E. and S.E.made up of gently-rising forest hills, with
here and there a point more elevated and having in their midst the sharp cone
named Knapp's Peak, which overtopped the whole. The forest ridges continued to
stretch to the north and obliged us to pursue our course to the eastward.</p>
<h4>CHANGE OF ROUTE</h4>
<p>"At noon, on crossing the channel of the Logan, we found ourselves...in the
parallel of 28&deg; S., and, perceiving that it was not possible to make our
way to the westward...in consequence of the bushy ridges which stretched across
the country northerly to the foot of Flinders Peak, I was induced by the advice
of Captain Logan (who had became anxious to return to the settlement) to
relinquish my design of making the mountain gap from this part of the country,
but to prosecute our journey to the north and north-east, until we should pass
the parallel of latitude of Flinders Peak on its eastern side, on effecting
which no obstacle could prevent our reaching Limestone Station on Bremer's
River (a tributary to the Brisbane), whence the Dividing Range could be
approached with the utmost ease, as the intervening country was known to
Captain Logan to be of very moderate surface.</p>
<p>"Thus determined, we pursued our way to the E.N.E. about 3&frac12; miles
over a succession of forest ridges and narrow valleys, when, again intersecting
the Logan at our 11th mile, we were induced to halt, as our bullocks were much
exhausted. At daybreak of the 9th the commandant despatched two of our party
with letters to Brisbane Town, and by that opportunity I wrote to the Officer
in Charge of the Commissariat to forward to me at the Limestone Hills on the
Bremer a further supply of rations to enable me to perform the journey I had in
contemplation from that station south-westerly to the pass through the
mountains discovered in June, 1827.</p>
<p>"On resuming our journey this day we left the Logan and repeatedly made
attempts to pass to the westward at points appearing likely to afford us a
passage through. All our essays were, however, in vain. The dense repulsive
thicket soon stopped our progress and showed us that the utmost we could do
would be to pursue our course to the northward and eastward. We therefore
continued over low forest ridges, taking care to clear the brush which
stretched down them to the narrow, intermediate valleys, in which again we met
the Logan, and as we had completed our tenth mile we halted on its banks. From
this encamping ground we observed the hills connected with Birnam Range, the
central parts of which bore nearly east from us, and appeared to be distant
about 10 miles.</p>
<p>"At our second mile to the north in our stage of the following day, the
Logan, which we had traced from its course, left us, trending to the
east-north-east. Throughout the day we were climbing hills, with Flinders Peak
continually in view. We were unable to approach its base, it being perfectly
surrounded by steep and rocky ridges. It was not until after sunset that water
was discovered for the use of our exhausted bullocks and selves, and, although
it was found in a small quantity and stagnant state, we were exceedingly glad
to close our labours for the day at it."</p>
<p>Early in the morning of the 11th Captain Logan and Mr. Fraser bade
Cunningham good-bye and took their departure for Brisbane Town, distant from
their camp about twenty-four miles. As Cunningham intended to make his way to
what is now Ipswich he set out with his party to the northward and westward. He
writes: "After effecting a stage of ten miles over hilly uninteresting
country...we rested in a valley affording both excellent grass and good water
to our wearied oxen. We had at length passed sufficiently north of the range
connected with Flinders Peak to be enabled to shape a course to the
westward...and we therefore, on commencing our last stage to the Limestone
Station on the Bremer River, penetrated directly west among some stony
hills...and at the 7th mile came out upon the skirts of a plain on the surface
of which were scattered fragments of calcareous rock, flint and agate," and
limestone also was seen, which told Cunningham that he was nearing his
destination.</p>
<h4>LIMESTONE STATION (IPSWICH)</h4>
<p>Having crossed the plain to the north-west, Cunningham arrived at the
Limestone Hills, where he found the provisions that he had demanded from the
Commissariat. They had been brought by boat under charge of one of Cunningham's
servants. He now reduced his establishment to two bullocks, a driver, and two
servants, sending back to Brisbane Town, agreeably to the request of Captain
Logan, the other two oxen, and two servants. He thus writes: "As I shall have
occasion to refer frequently to this station (Ipswich or Limestone Station), I
will make a few brief observations upon its situation and general
productions.</p>
<p>"In the course of the last year Captain Logan, in tracing the Bremer (of Mr.
Oxley, who merely passed its mouth in 1824) from its junction with the
Brisbane,[*] discovered at ten miles through its many windings from that point,
the hummocks on its right bank now named the Limestone Hills.</p>
<blockquote>[* Bremer's River at its junction with the Brisbane is about forty
yards wide.]</blockquote>
<p>"Landing, he was much struck with the singular appearance of the lofty
<i>Xanthorrhoeae</i>, or grass-trees, which abound in the open flats, low hills
and forest grounds at this particular part, and which the commandant had not
inaptly compared to beehives elevated on stools."</p>
<p>Some months after this discovery, a kiln was built and a party, under an
overseer (acquainted with the operations of sapping and mining) and five
convicts were stationed at these hills to commence lime-burning. It was not
long before the station was visited by the wandering aborigines, who, after
threatening the lives of the white men, seized the first opportunity to run off
with their tools. To protect the lime-burners from further molestation from
these savages a corporal and three privates were stationed on the spot, and
from that period no natives ventured to approach the huts of either soldiers or
people, although they were seen prowling through the woods.</p>
<p>The lime burnt in the new kiln, which Cunningham says was excellent, was
conveyed by boat to Brisbane, where it was used for building purposes. His
report shows that the mineral wealth of the newly-formed settlement did not
escape his notice. It runs: "In some specimens of flint which I caused to be
broken, I found beautiful specimens of chalcedony, containing cavities filled
with groups of minute crystallized quartz.</p>
<p>"Chalk is also found among the hills, in which are nodules of flint, and a
stratum or seam of coal has been observed on the Bremer, both immediately above
and below the station; and, as that mineral was noticed three or four miles to
the north in the steep banks of dry creeks dipping to the Brisbane, and again
in another mile, in the bed of that river, it is highly probable that the seam
extends nearly horizontally throughout.</p>
<p>He also describes the soil as being black and rich, if one might judge from
the luxuriant growth of the vegetables in the settlers' garden. The flats too
were covered with grass and supported a flock of sheep belonging to the
Government. He continues:</p>
<p>"During a stay of five days at this station, in which period the rest and
good pasture afforded my bullocks most materially benefited them, I determined
its position as follows, viz. mean latitude by meridional altitude of the sun,
27&deg;37'00" S. longitude of the mean of distances on both sides of the
meridian mean 152&deg;; variation by azimuth, 9&deg;45' E.</p>
<p>"The distance from Brisbane Town by water has been estimated at about
forty-eight miles, whilst its bearing from that settlement is S.W. by W. (true)
only 18 statute miles.</p>
<p>"From a hill in the immediate vicinity of my tents I took the following
bearings to points in the south-western country about to be examined: Mount
Forbes of Mr. Oxley, a remarkable hill, rising from a level country and in
shape ridged like the roof of a house, S. 48&frac12;&deg; W., about 16 miles;
Mountain Gap, S. 38&frac12;&deg; perhaps forty miles; Wilson's Peak of Capt.
Logan, S. 12&deg; W., 45 or 50 miles; Flinders Peak, S. 19&deg; E_ 12
miles."</p>
<p>Cunningham at last found himself free to search for the break in the
Dividing Range. This object had been uppermost in his mind ever since his
former visit. Nor can one wonder that he was filled with ambition to rediscover
the pass through the range which runs along the east coast almost without a
break southward from Cape York and divides the interior from the eastern
coastal regions.</p>
<h4>THE SEARCH FOR THE GAP</h4>
<p>On the morning of the 18th August with his small company he left the
Limestone Hills[*] on his way towards the Dividing Range. He directed his
course up the valley of the Bremer and the streams flowing into it. Immediately
on leaving the limestone country, the land was found to gradually rise and the
soil to change to lumpy grit. At the second mile the track led through open
forest over fairly level country, the rock formation of which was chiefly a
coarse sandstone quartz and very fine specimens of jasper. Occasionally in the
thinly wooded parts the soil became richer and was strewed with "small
fragments of calcareous stone." Passing over a tea-tree flat Cunningham came to
the bank of a narrow but deep creek, falling north-easterly towards Bremer's
River. Although at that time little else than a chain of stagnant pools, its
banks showed traces of floods twenty feet above its then low level. He writes:
"We left this creek winding from the southward and continuing our route to the
southward and westward to our 11th mile, I despatched a man to search for water
in the direction of the remarkable level-topped hills seen from the Limestone
Station (named by Mr. Oxley, in 1824, Mount Forbes)...We were obliged to extend
our stage...to the 13th mile ere we found a sufficiency of water for our
consumption.</p>
<blockquote>[* The route he pursued towards the pass appears to have been a
different one to that now generally used by the people of Moreton Bay, and it
is difficult to identify.]</blockquote>
<p>"No natives were met with in this stage, although patches of the forest
grasses had been very lately fired and the recent traces of these people were
noticed on the trunks of the trees, from which they had torn off the outer
paper-like bark to roof their huts. After some heavy showers of rain
accompanied by thunder, the morning of the 19th (August) broke upon us
exceedingly clear, pleasant and cool...Our route to the southward and westward
was resumed about 7 o'clock and, having traversed open forest, on the eastern
side of Mount Forbes, abounding in grass, we reached some hilly ground...On
gaining the summit of the ridge, a most pleasing view was laid open to us from
S.W. to S., and thence to E. and E.N.E.</p>
<p>"At E.N.E. and thence to E.S.E., a large patch of plain lying at N. and S.
appeared as at a distance of about 3 miles, in many parts very verdant, and
watered evidently by a large creek, the course of which was marked by a line of
swamp-oak winding through its centre. To this plain I gave the name of Bowerman
as a compliment to my friend, the officer in charge of His Majesty's Magazines
at Parramatta. The irregular ridge connected with Flinders Peak, still further
to the eastward, was very conspicuous, presenting four distant pinnacles; more
distant points in a southerly direction extending as far as Mount Lindesay,
which was distinctly recognized. On quitting the ridge we descended to a grassy
vale, and then continued our journey to the S.S.W. through a forest tract
plentifully clothed with grass but...destitute of water.</p>
<p>"On completing our tenth mile, the ground appeared on its S.W. side to dip
easterly; I therefore sent one of the people to make a diligent search for
water in that direction. This was almost immediately met with in deep holes,
and, as there was abundance of good grass for our oxen, I again halted. At
night a wind from about S.S.W. sprang up which obliged us to secure our tents
by strong guys to prevent their being blown down; the wind continued with
unabated violence throughout the night and until sunrise of the following
morning (20th), when it moderated. Being by estimation about 12 miles to the
N.E. of the pass through the Dividing Range, it was my intention to have
penetrated near to its base in the course of the day...We therefore quitted our
encamping ground soon after sunrise, but soon the inability of the bullocks to
travel over some stony hills, owing to the tenderness of their feet, obliged me
to halt in a valley among the hills, having made only four miles towards the
pass. At noon I found our latitude to be 27&deg;56'48" S...The smoke of
natives' fires was seen curling above the trees a little to the eastward of us,
but these people kept themselves very quiet: not a voice was heard, nor a
person seen.</p>
<p>"August 21st. About 7 a.m. we made another attempt to penetrate to the foot
of the main range: climbing a forest ridge at S.W. without difficulty, the
bullocks descended (by the care of my people), amidst much fallen timber and
loose stones, to a valley stretching north and south, which we crossed,
continuing towards the range to our fifth mile. We intersected the stony bed of
a mountain torrent 12 yards in width, at this season perfectly dry, but
evidently at other periods filled to the depth of six feet. The position of the
driftwood on its shallow bank showed us that its fall was to the south; it
therefore most probably pours its rapid waters into the Richmond of Captain
Rous.</p>
<p>"Passing the stony channel of this watercourse, we traversed an apple-tree
flat, pursuing our way over some hilly ground to a narrow valley where, meeting
with fine weather, we again halted within four miles of the actual mouth of the
Gap. As it was early in the afternoon, I despatched a man to look out and
examine the hollow in the mountain ridges directly open to our encampment.
After an absence of five hours he returned, having failed in his attempt to
climb to the pitch of the Gap...</p>
<p>"From the precipitous aspect of this hollow in the main range, its elevated
appearance, its breadth between the boundary heads, I was induced to conceive
that the Gap, into which I had simply looked from its western side in June,
1827...was distinct from the one now before us. And, as the Dividing Range to
the north of us trended easterly, I felt disposed to believe it was to be
discovered a few miles in that direction. With this impression on my mind we
left the spot on which we had rested, on the morning of the 22nd to proceed
round the lateral ridges, intending to observe attentively as we travelled
every indentation of the main range. We immediately entered the valley and in
five miles reached its head, which to the eastward is bounded by forest hills.
Passing a low, grassy ridge and continuing about two miles, we descended to an
apple-tree flat watered by a creek running to the northward, on which we
encamped. The low, grassy ridge is sufficiently elevated to give opposite
directions to waters discharged on our east coast. We remarked that those
streams falling on its northern side (its direction being east and west)
eventually joined the Bremer, whilst those descending southerly without doubt
are received into the Richmond, the embouchure of which Captain Rous has
recently discovered upwards of 100 miles to the south of Moreton Bay."</p>
<p>Cunningham determined to remain at the apple-tree flat for the whole of the
22nd, possibly because here he wished to add to his botanical collections and
he sent two of his men at daybreak to a very steep forest ridge, directing them
to climb to the highest point of the Dividing Range and from it to view the
western country and its landmarks and to bring back to him information that
would enable him to fix the situation of the pass seen during the previous
year, and especially by any bearings that they might take to as far as the
extensive downs he had discovered on the western side of this formidable range.
Meanwhile he ascertained the situation of his camp to be latitude, by
observation, 27&deg;55'45" S.; longitude, deduced from the meridian of the
Limestone Hills, 152&deg;27'30" E.</p>
<p>He then seems to have spent some time in his botanical researches and writes
on the 23rd "Among the brushes that overshadowed the creek on which we were
encamped, grew most luxuriantly, the native <i>Bignonia</i> and a fine
<i>Clematis</i> being intertwined and abundantly in flower, formed the richest
festoons." He continues:</p>
<p>Whilst on the subject of the flora of this fine country, so generally
interesting in all its features, it may be observed that, barring the vine-clad
banks of the Brisbane, the whole line of country through which we had travelled
after leaving Brisbane Town, proved by no means so interesting to the botanist.
The grasses are chiefly those of the colony, the richest flats and alluvial
grounds being adorned with the vetch (in bloom) called <i>Swainsona</i>, and
with <i>Lotus australis</i>, or birdsfoot trefoil, as also a <i>Geranium</i>
and a <i>Senecio</i> frequent in the Bathurst country. The collections of dried
plants that were found were therefore detected on the barren, rocky ridges and
stony mountains that lay in the way of our expedition.</p>
<p>"In this place I will merely notice the singular association of our common
<i>Eucalypti</i> with the tree of a genus whose splendid scarlet flowers render
it very conspicuous among even the more brilliant subjects of the flora of
intertropical countries. The tree I allude to is a species of <i>Erythrin</i>
or coral tree, which I first observed in an excursion to the foot of Flinders
Peak. Under the Dividing Range I frequently met with it in a forest of
blighted., uncomely iron-bark forming a tree 35 feet high with a smooth trunk
but thorny branches and, during the winter months, without leaves. Its last
year's pods continued hanging at the extremities of the branches, and, although
pigeons (which abound in these woods) and other birds had eaten most of the
seeds, still many of a brilliant red colour were found among the grass beneath
each tree.</p>
<p>It was late in the afternoon ere my two men found their way back to the
encampment, when I learnt from them that from the grassy ridge, which they had
ascended in front of the tents, they had gained a lofty point of the Dividing
Range to the southwest. Here they observed among the very elevated mountains to
westward a valley extending through them in the direction of W.N.W. to a very
low declining country at that bearing; but, as no appearance of plain could be
perceived, and as there did not appear any part of the main range to the north
worth the examination for the Gap so obvious in the winter's journey in 1827,
it was concluded that either the hollow back we had just left was the identical
pass of last year, or that it was in its immediate vicinity. With this view I
concurred; and therefore, on the morning of the 24th, we returned southerly to
it, with the fullest determination to examine leisurely the main range from the
extreme points of which I felt quite certain the last year's Gap would be
discovered.</p>
<p>"About one o'clock we passed a mile to the southward of our last position,
and, entering a valley, we pitched the tents within three miles of the entrance
of the Gap now suspected to be the pass of last year's journey. It being early
in the afternoon, I sent one of the people (who, having been of my party on
that long tour, knew the features of the country lying to the westward of the
Dividing Range) to trace a series of forest ridges which appeared to lead
directly up to the hollow back in the range.</p>
<h4>THE PASS THROUGH THE DIVIDING RANGE</h4>
<p>"To my utmost gratification he returned at dusk, having traced the ridge
about 2&frac12; miles to the foot of the Dividing Range, whence he ascended
into the pass, and, from a grassy head immediately above it, beheld the
extensive country lying west of the Main Range. He recognized both Darling and
Canning Downs, patches of Peel's Plains, and several remarkable points of the
forest hills on that side, fully identifying this hollow back with the Pass
discovered last year at the head of Millar's Valley.</p>

<h4>SKETCHES FROM CUNNINGHAM'S DIARY</h4>
</center>
<p>"Resting my oxen on the 25th, I determined to occupy the whole of the day in
examining this very important passage as it would lead from the coast lands
through a formidable main range of mountains to a vast extent of pastoral
country on the western side of the mountains. Accompanied by my servant with an
odometer, or measuring wheel, we commenced our labours at 7 a.m.</p>
<p>"From the valley in which we were encamped, we immediately ascended a low
forest ridge at S., trending S.S.W. and S.W. throughout the first mile and a
half...In tracing the leading ridge, we found an ample passage between detached
masses of sandstone which were covered with parasites (of ferns and Dendrobia
or rock lilies) of species heretofore only found within the tropics.</p>
<p>"In another half-mile, the ridge takes a decided bend to the westward and
its surface, becoming wider, presented an open patch of forest-ground, timbered
chiefly with oaks and appletree in quantity sufficient for a small farm. The
ridge at length narrows again, but the acclivity continues most promising.
Patches of brush clothe its sides, and also those of the gullies falling from
it, leaving its back clear of wood, open and grassy. At about 23 miles the
ridge bends to the northward of west, and immediately the summit of the pass
appeared broad before us, bounded on each side by most stupendous heads.[*]
These heads were towering at least 2,000 feet above the Gap.</p>
<blockquote>[* "I had at the time great pleasure in giving names to these very
elevated points of the Dividing Range, which are very distinctly seen over
fifty-four miles of wooded country from Brisbane Town. The south head, which
forms a long backed mount, with a lofty point at each extremity, I have named
Mount Mitchell in honour of the Surveyor-General of the Territory, whilst the
north head was entitled Mount Cordeaux, as a compliment to Wm. Cordeaux, Esq.,
of the Surveyor-General's Department."]</blockquote>
<p>"Here the difficulties of the passage commenced. We had arrived at the
actual foot of the pass without the smallest difficulty; it remained to ascend,
by a steep slope, to the level of its entrance. This slope is occupied by a
very close wood, in which red cedar, sassafras, palms and other ornamental
trees are frequent. Through this shaded wood we climbed up a steep bank of very
rich, loose earth where a very compact rock (of white stone) is embedded. At
length we gained the foot of a wall of bare rock which we found stretching from
the southward into the Pass.</p>
<h4>THROUGH THE GAP</h4>
<p>"This face of naked rock we perceived (by tracing its base northerly)
gradually to fall to the common level; so that, without the smallest
difficulty, and to my utmost surprise, we found ourselves in the highest part
of the Pass, having fully ascertained the extent of the difficult part, from
the entrance into the wood, to this point, not to exceed 400 yards. We now
pushed our way westerly through this extraordinary defile, and, in less than
half a mile of level surface, clothed with a thick brush of plants common to
the Brisbane River, reached the opposite side of the main range, where I
observed the waters fell westerly to Millar's Valley beneath us.</p>
<p>"Climbing the northern summit of Mount Mitchell, which bounds the pass on
the south, it was with no small pleasure that I looked over the beautiful tract
of country at which my labours of the last year closed. Portions of Canning and
Darling Downs, with patches of Peel's Plain, are distinctly recognised at
distances of 20 and 30 miles; the entrance to Logan Vale, indicated by the
table-topped hill named last year Mount Sturt, was also observed, as was the
forest ridge overhanging that rich valley beneath which my tents stood several
days at that period. My elevated situation on Mount Mitchell enabled me to take
bearings to points on the western as well as on the eastern sides of the
Barrier Range, thus most satisfactorily affording me materials to connect on
the map of the country the northern points of my last year's journey with the
settlement on the Brisbane River. The day was considerably advanced by the time
we had effected these truly interesting observations; we therefore descended to
the pass, and, making the best of our way along the eastern forest ridge,
reached the encampment about eight o'clock, having been occupied in severe
exercise about thirteen hours. The Gap through the Dividing Range is situated
in latitude 28&deg;2'40" S., and longitude (reduced from the meridian of the
Limestone Station) 152&deg;24'20" E., and lies S.W. from Brisbane Town 54
miles, being also in direct distance from the sea-coast (near Point Danger of
Captain Cook) about 64 geographical miles."</p>
<p>Cunningham continues: "The weather had favoured our operations throughout
the whole of the day, but we had scarcely been seated within our tents half an
hour before the sky became overcast, and heavy clouds passing over us to the
eastward in a rapid succession presaged the storm that was gathering.</p>
<p>I had taken the precaution to secure the tents by extra guys, and therefore
felt fully prepared to meet the impending tempest. The thunder at length
approached in rolling peals accompanied by the most vivid lightning; and a
deluging rain commenced a storm as awful, at the same time as grand, as any
that are to be witnessed. With unabated violence the tempest continued until
after midnight, when, as if suddenly exhausted, the wind moderated, the clouds
broke, gradually sinking down towards the horizon; and a bright moon, just past
the full, now burst forth with many a brilliant star, to assure us, by
affording light to observe the extreme pinnacles of the mountains perfectly
divested of clouds, that at length calm, serene and settled weather was again
restored to us. The thermometer stood at 64&deg;.</p>
<p>"On the 26th (August) we commenced our journey back to the Limestone
Station, distant something under forty miles. The surface of the soil was quite
saturated with the rains, and the vegetation assumed a lively verdure,
evidently refreshed by the showers. We soon reached our last encampment on the
creek that ran northerly to the Bremer, and then pursued a course to the north,
with the design of passing to the westward of Mount Forbes. This line of route
led us over forest ridges, clothed with a luxuriant carpet of grass and
timbered with loftier and statelier iron-bark than we had seen for some
time.</p>
<p>"In two miles these undulated grounds...dip to the level of an apple-tree
flat...extend northerly several miles, and form a most beautiful valley, well
watered by the creek on which we had rested on the 22nd.</p>
<p>Continuing north about three miles through this very level valley, a patch
of plain opened on our view, round the skirts of which the creek, which we
had...crossed, bent its course. This plain, which I felt gratified in naming
after Lieut. Bainbrigge, of His Majesty's 57th Regiment, at present the very
active engineer at Brisbane Town, is of an irregular square figure. It contains
about 800 acres of beautiful land of as truly a level as it is possible to
conceive any patch of ground could be, untouched by the hand of man. Nothing
can possibly exceed the richness and mellowness of its fine black soil, and
certainly there is not in any explored part of New South Wales a more beautiful
subject for the pencil of the artist than the landscape presented to the
traveller from the centre of Bainbrigge's Plain, to which no description of
mine can possibly do justice.[*]</p>
<blockquote>[* This plain met with by Cunningham on his route back to lpswich
appears to have been a part of what is now Normanby Plains, which extends to
50,000 acres.]</blockquote>
<h4>MOUNT FORBES (OF OXLEY)</h4>
<p>"Immediately on the S.E., low forest ridges and some detached hills meet the
eye. One rather elevated and remarkable figure was named Mount Fraser, after my
friend and fellow-traveller. Whenever this country is thrown open to the
grazier and a public road is constructed through the mountain defile just
explored to the extensive western pastures, then will Bainbrigge's Plain become
a stage, being nearly equidistant from the Limestone Station and the Pass, the
distance from each...not exceeding a day's journey. In about six miles further
to the N.N.E. we made the foot of Mount Forbes, where I determined to rest a
whole day, as well to fix its position as to obtain from its summit a full set
of bearings to all points around, and by them to connect and close the sketch
of my journey.</p>
<p>"I...took bearings to every eminence of moment...As these bearings were to
points already frequently mentioned, no observation need again be made of them.
I would, however, simply remark that I was at length enabled to fix the true
situation of the lofty hills, marked on the chart of the country to the
southward, which I named Mount Edwards and Mount Greville, the latter in honour
of a very distinguished Scotch botanist.</p>
<p>"Of certain parts of this curiously diversified country, it may be important
to know that, upon passing to the eastward of the range of Flinders Peak, the
land appears a perfect level to the coast, which an eastern line would
intersect about the southern extreme of Stradbroke Island, so that if it should
at any period be deemed expedient to order a road to be formed from this hill
direct to that part of the coast...there appears to be no difficulty in passing
the line of ridge stretching southerly from Flinders Peak, to prevent its being
made.</p>
<p>"The summit of Mount Forbes presents a narrow, level ridge at its southern
extreme, from which it gradually contracts northerly until it becomes a sharp
ledge of rocks, having on the eastern and western sides precipitous falls Of
200 feet. The rock is an ironstone upon which the decomposing effects of the
elements were everywhere obvious, and this doubtless gives the mountain its
sharp figure when viewed either from the N. or S.</p>
<p>"29th. Having ascertained the situation of Mount Forbes as follows, we
prosecuted our journey to the north along a continuation of the valley
traversed on the 27th. (Lat. 27&deg;47'00" S.; long. 52&deg;35'00" E.). At noon
our latitude (observed on the bank of the Bremer) placed us five miles south of
the Limestone Hills, which bore from us E.N.E. about 15 miles. This distance we
covered early in the afternoon of August 30th, after having been absent from
that station 12 days."</p>
<p>Cunningham thus ends his report: "It is highly probable that upon the site
of these limestone hills a town one day will be raised." This was a true
prophecy, since here had arisen the town of Ipswich of the Southern Hemisphere,
so called in honour of Captain Rous, who was a native of Suffolk; it is now the
centre of the Triassic coalfield of Queensland.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIX</h2>
<h3>CUNNINGHAM'S LAST JOURNEYS</h3>
<p>Before he took his departure from Limestone Station Cunningham made some
short excursions, and on one occasion revisited the Brisbane River which he
intersected at Red Cliff Reach, the scene of Oxley's explorations in 1824. He
made his way to a ridge upon which grew A<i>raucaria Cunninghamii</i> in great
magnificence. He was reminded of his first visit to this spot with the late
Surveyor-General, for he writes: "In traversing a pitch of forest ground
formerly walked over by Mr. Oxley, accompanied by Lieutenant Butler and myself,
to the Pine Range, I could fain have recalled to life that lamented gentleman
who so long and so creditably to himself filled this post, and many a pleasing
incident now recurred to me. I passed over the ground and ascended the darkly
brushed acclivity of the Pine Range by the same opening in the thicket which we
had 4 years since penetrated to the higher points where grew those stately
timber trees, the monarchs of these forests--the new Araucaria."</p>

<h4>BREMER RIVER. THIS MAP ALSO SHOWS THE SITE OF OXLEY'S ENCAMPMENT ON THE
BRISBANE IN 1824, AND RED CLIFF REACH, THE MOST WESTERN POINT REACHED BY HIM
DURING HIS SECOND VISIT TO THE BRISBANE IN 1824</h4>
</center>
<p>Cunningham then drew a sketch of the Brisbane at Red Cliff Reach and wrote
an inscription upon it to show that Mr. Oxley had visited this particular part
of the river in 1824. He added another note, writing across one ridge on the
sketch the words: 1 Septr., 1828. A.C. A copy of his drawing has been
reproduced (see <i>ante</i>, page 537).</p>
<p>This sketch was embodied in a chart of Bremer River that Cunningham
afterwards sent to Governor Darling. Not only the course of the Bremer can be
traced upon the chart but two sections of the Brisbane River are also shown
upon it. In a report to the Governor from Parramatta on December 16th, 1828,
Cunningham gives further particulars of his visit to Red Cliff Reach. He
writes: "An excursion made in September last from Limestone Station North to
the channel of the Brisbane which I intersected in five miles at a point
visited by Mr. Oxley and myself, in 1824, and which I clearly recognized, has
enabled me to connect most satisfactorily (as regards geographical position)
the westernmost point to which our late very able Surveyor-General had
penetrated on his second visit to the Brisbane with what I have now attempted
to effect. The tortuous course of the river is therefore carried on upon the
accompanying chart <i>to that point</i>. Beyond this spot the river was
subsequently (in 1825) traced up in a N.W. direction by Major Lockyer." The
chart of Bremer River is reproduced, the writer being unable to find the larger
chart of Cunningham's surveys.</p>
<p>On his return to Brisbane Town, Cunningham penned one of his most
interesting letters, now preserved at Kew. It is dated Brisbane, September
16th, 1828, and is addressed to Mr. Charles Telfair, the friend he had made at
the Mauritius, and, in addition to other botanical subjects, describes the huge
timber trees which he had seen in dense woods on the banks of the Brisbane
during this late tour. He writes: "Among the plants of this river our attention
has been particularly directed to the timber trees: <i>Flindersia australis</i>
of Mr. Brown, who discovered it, I think, at Broad Sound in 1802, where it
rises to a small tree under twenty feet. The tulipwood forms a tree 60 feet
high, and in bulk is from 1 to 1&frac12; feet in diameter. Another tree I think
that will prove an acquisition is here called the silk oak. It is of the order
<i>Proleaceae</i>, and of the genus <i>Grevillea</i>, but of a species yet
unpublished; it rises to a height of 80 or 90 feet, and I have measured the
trunks at their base, which give a diameter of two feet nine inches. The pine,
a third species of <i>Araucaria</i>, towers above all other plants; it exceeds
100 feet in height, and is fully 4&frac12; feet to 5 feet in diameter. It is so
truly cylindrical in barrel that it preserves this width from its base up to 50
feet, when it begins to branch off and taper upwards. It furnishes spars for
masts. I have seen a tree here...called the lime, lately discovered in the
woods and, in consequence of its acidity...proved useful as an anti-scorbutic.
It forms a tree 30-70 feet high, with small myrtle-like leaves, and with
branches furnished with spines...It is most clearly of the <i>Aurantiae</i> of
Correa (<i>Annales Ile Mus</i>, Vol. VI), but whether a <i>Citrus</i> or a
<i>Limonia</i> I am just now unable to say. This can only be determined by its
flowers. Of the new <i>Calostemma</i> (a genus related to the
<i>Pancratium</i>) of these woods, I have collected a few bulbs. This
interesting plant I forwarded to Kew four years ago from these forests, where
alone it has been sparingly met with; and, as it flowered in the royal
establishment, Dr. Hooker has, through a brother of mine, been made acquainted
with it.</p>
<p>"I have collected some interesting geological specimens," continues
Cunningham "and have prepared several skins of rare birds: these, with the skin
of a woman--an aboriginal, I have obtained with the design of sending them home
to Sir Everard Home. I have in my possession some curious and novel facts
respecting the natives, of their custom of flaying persons of some rank, among
them those who have fallen in battle...The mode of performing this operation is
by drying the skin previous to its being carried about with them in their
wanderings, in order to remind them that a great warrior once lived among
them."</p>
<p>In the following month Cunningham left the scene of his duties and embarked
on October 29th for Sydney in the schooner "Isabella," reaching Port Jackson on
November 14, 1828. He brought back with him an interesting and valuable
collection of living plants and an equally valuable collection of seeds.</p>
<p>For the next few months his movements were somewhat unsettled. Evidently he
was awaiting anxiously the reply from home saying that he might return to
England, but so far none had come. He continued to make some short tours into
the country: and travelled in January, 1829, over the Blue Mountains as far as
Cox's River. The weather was intensely, even disagreeably, hot, and he was glad
to return to his small cottage-home at Parramatta. Here he was saddened by the
news of the death of his father, whom he had been looking forward to seeing on
his arrival in England after his long absence in the colony, and who had died
at the ripe old age of eighty-four.</p>
<p>In May, 1829, Cunningham returned to Queensland, and in a tour of six weeks'
duration carried out further explorations, travelling westward and
north-westward of his former tracks. In this journey he fixed the situation of
Hay's Peak, a conical, densely wooded mountain in 27&deg;36' S. and 152&deg;8'
E. (near Toowoomba)[*], and he "traced the principal branch of the Brisbane
River as far N. as 26&deg;25' S., until its channel assumed merely the
character of a chain of very shallow stagnant pools." At this time he reached
Lister's Peak in 26&deg;52' S. This forms the most northerly point of his
discoveries, and he thus, as he himself states (in a letter to Governor Darling
dated Parramatta December 12, 1829), then established two important
geographical facts: (1) that the Brisbane River (at one period supposed to be
the outlet of the marshes of the Macquarie) originated on the eastern side of
the Dividing Range, its chief sources being in elevated lands bordering the
sea-coast, between the parallels of 26&deg; and 27&deg; S.; and (2) that the
Main Range which separates the coast waters from those that flow inland
continued to the northward in one unbroken chain. He adds: "My pass, therefore,
seems the only opening into the interior." Explorers who followed Cunningham,
however, complained that the facilities of ascent he reported were far from
being realized. And "it is certain," says a modem historian, "that several
accesses by which the range can be scaled, and which in later years have been
chiefly used, are situated about fifty miles north of Cunningham's Gap."</p>
<blockquote>[* Named in honour of R. W. Hay, Under-Secretary of State for the
Colonies.]</blockquote>
<p>In this--his last journey in Queensland--Cunningham encountered the blacks
three times and on one occasion, at Laidley Plains, he and his men nearly lost
their lives in a bush fire which the natives had maliciously kindled near their
tents.</p>
<p>He returned to Sydney at the end of September, with seventy boxes of the
choicest specimens of the Queensland flora, which he intended to convey home
himself and deposit in Kew Gardens.</p>
<h4>NORFOLK ISLAND</h4>
<p>Governor Phillip before leaving England in 1787 had been instructed to
occupy Norfolk Island, which Cook had discovered on October 10, 1774. On March
6, 1788, Lieutenant King (afterwards Governor of New South Wales), who was
appointed commandant, and Lieutenant Ball with a party of twenty-three, had
landed on the south side from the "Supply" and had taken possession of it.</p>
<p>King named the bay wherein he landed and fixed his settlement, Sydney Bay,
and gave the names of Phillip and Nepean to two small islands off its shores.
At Sydney Bay log huts were built and thatched with bulrushes and flags, which
added to the picturesqueness of the spot. The cabbage palm and flax plant grew
luxuriantly. King believed that the island had been previously inhabited, for
he found the banana tree growing in regular rows and the settlers, when turning
up the soil in the interior, came upon "several stone hatchets, or rather
stones resembling adzes and others resembling chisels." A coconut perfectly
fresh and a piece of wood said to resemble the handle of a fly-flap, like those
of the Friendly Islands, together with the remains of two canoes, were
discovered among the rocks, and these were thought to have been blown there
from some distance.[*]</p>
<blockquote>[* Collins, PP. 41, 149.]</blockquote>
<p>Norfolk Island was afterwards used as a penal settlement, and in 1790 the
population consisted of 149 persons. An order for its evacuation was issued by
the imperial authorities in 1803. The settlers were to have been all removed to
Tasmania and to Sydney, but the fulfilment of this purpose was long delayed. It
was partly carried out in 1803, in 1813, and in 1825; the island, however, is
still a British possession.</p>
<p>In May, 1830, Cunningham, while still awaiting news from home, visited
Norfolk Island, and after landing from the ship "Lucy Ann" at Cascade Bay on
the north side he walked across to the settlement at the southern side. It was
La P&eacute;rouse who said of this island that it was only a fit habitation for
"angels and eagles," but he might well have added "and for botanists" so rich
did Cunningham find it in interesting plants.</p>
<p>Of these he writes: "None are more remarkable than its noble pine,
<i>Araucaria excelsa</i>, and a tree-fern, <i>Alsophila excelsa</i>; and, as
these are lofty plants and generally grouped together on every part of the
island, they form a most decided feature of the landscape." He thought that in
habit and general appearance the plants assumed more the aspect of the
vegetation of New Zealand than that of Australia, and he noticed in Norfolk
Island the following which are found in the Bay of Islands, New Zealand:
<i>Phormium tenax</i>, <i>Olea apetala</i>, <i>Areca Banksii</i> (<i>A.
sapida</i>. Forst.), <i>Myoporum laetum</i>, <i>Dracaena australis</i>,
<i>Freycinetia Baueriana</i> (the New Zealand plant is probably distinct and
may be designated <i>F. Banksii</i>), <i>Dodonaea sp.</i>, <i>Tetragona
expansa</i>, <i>Polygonum australe</i>, and <i>Samolus littoralis</i>."</p>
<p>Cunningham recalled here that, at the discovery of the island in 1774,
Forster, the naturalist who accompanied Cook on his second voyage, had had an
opportunity of landing on its north shore near Cascade Bay, and that there,
among several unpublished species of plants, he detected two new genera: the
one, his <i>Gynopogon</i> (Alyxia. Br.), of which genus the intertropical parts
of New South Wales furnish several species; the, other being his
<i>Blackburnia</i>. "We hear of no further scientific remarks having been made
on the botany of this beautiful isolated spot," writes Cunningham, "until that
able naturalist and draughtsman, Ferdinand Bauer, visited it, about the year
1804, and who doubtless during his stay collected every plant of its
interesting flora, which, exclusive of a few mosses and lichens, comprehends
something more than one hundred distinct species, belonging to full half that
number of natural orders. Of these, ten furnish timbers that might be usefully
employed in carpentry, boat-building, and even cabinet-work, viz.: <i>Araucaria
excelsa</i>, <i>Elaeodendron australe</i>, <i>Blackburnia pinnata</i>,
<i>Hibiscus Patersonii</i>, <i>01ea apetala</i>, <i>Croton sp.</i> [=
<i>Baloghia lucida</i>], <i>Kleinhovia (?) sp.</i> [= <i>Ungeria
floribunda</i>], <i>Pennantia corymbosa</i>, <i>Mimusops sp.</i> [=<i>Achras
costata</i>], <i>Coprosma sp.</i> [= <i>C. pilosa</i>],</p>
<h4>PHILLIP ISLAND</h4>
<p>Colonel Morrisett, late of the 48th Regiment, who was cornmandant of the
island, showed the botanical traveller much kindness, and made arrangements for
him to visit Phillip Island. He made a circuit of this island, in spite of the
ravines which separate the rivers that diverge from its peak and fall on the
northern and western sides of it. "The interior," says Cunningham, "presents
some deep hollows, in parts densely wooded with small trees and an underwood
chiefly of the thorny caper bush, bearing fruit like a green lemon, and very
difficult to travel through." Here were a number of wild goats and pigs, the
progeny of some formerly put on shore at the first settlement of the island.
The produce of this stock had been thinned at various times, but Cunningham saw
a great many there, though the greater body kept in hollow places in the rocky
face of the cliffs inaccessible to man. The plants, with few exceptions, were
the same as those seen at Norfolk Island, among them being a species of
<i>Hibiscus</i>, with a spinous stem bearing withered yellow flowers, and
resembling a similar plant found at Port Macquarie. He was able to collect
flowering specimens of <i>Blackburnia pinnata</i>, not previously met with in
that state, <i>Capparis sp.</i> [= <i>Busbeckia nobilis</i>], and a ripe fruit
of <i>Mimusops sp.</i> [= <i>Achras costata</i>]. In the shades was found a
dark, glossy, pinnate-leaved twining plant, which appeared to be an undescribed
species of <i>Clitoria</i>. He did not leave Norfolk Island to return to Port
Jackson until September 11th, sailing in the "Lucy Ann" and landing in Sydney
on the afternoon of the 28th, after an absence of twenty-one weeks. It had been
his intention to visit the Swan River, but his lengthened stay in Norfolk
Island prevented this.</p>
<h4>VOYAGE HOME</h4>
<p>On November 16th the looked-for instructions arrived from the Treasury
ordering him to return to England. His long residence in the colony, therefore,
was soon to draw to a close and he went on no further expeditions beyond a
journey to Illawarra in December, 1830, and to Cox's River in January, 1831, on
botanizing excursions.</p>
<p>His time now was occupied chiefly in preparing for his homeward voyage, and
a berth was reserved for his passage home in the ship "Forth," Captain
Robertson, which was due to sail from New South Wales in February to England
direct. Gradually the huge botanical collections, consisting of living and
dried plants and seeds, with specimens of the native woods from various parts
of the continent, in addition to many other interesting objects of natural
history, were packed and conveyed on board the vessel then at anchor in Sydney
Harbour.</p>
<p>Cunningham next disposed of his household effects and his two horses, and on
February 12th vacated the small cottage which had been his home during most of
his stay at Parramatta. He says that he then bade adieu to his friends, "whose
kind offices I can no more forget than attempt to eradicate from my memory the
recollection of the very many agreeable periods I have spent in that quiet
town." From Parramatta he journeyed to Sydney, to find that the departure of
the "Forth" had been postponed, and in the end, owing to unfavourable winds,
the ship was prevented leaving Port Jackson until February 25th.</p>
<p>Not until July 10th did she sight the English coast, when early in the
morning Cunningham had a first view of the Lizard, after having been absent
nearly seventeen years from his native land. He took up his residence at a
pretty cottage at Strand-on-the-Green, on the north bank of the Thames, close
to Kew. Here, we are told, he was ever ready to impart the rich store of
information he possessed, as well as to distribute a portion of the valuable
collection he had brought home. Much of his time also was spent in arranging
his herbarium and preparing for publication the various botanical articles in
which he had recorded his observations.</p>
<p>In 1832, in consequence of the death of Charles Fraser, Colonial Botanist at
Sydney, the vacant position was offered to Allan Cunningham, who was still at
Strand-on-the-Green. He at this time declined the offer to go to New South
Wales in favour of his brother Richard, who had been recommended strongly for
the appointment by Mr. Robert Brown.</p>
<h4>RICHARD CUNNINGHAM</h4>
<p>His brother arrived at Port Jackson in February, 1833, and, although he did
not live long in the country, Australia owes him a great debt, not only because
it was there that he laid down his life in the cause of science, but also on
account of the way in which, before leaving England, he had devoted his
energies to the arrangement and classification of the flora of the continent.
Indeed, the contents of most of the "cabins" despatched from Sydney by Allan
Cunningham had found their way into the hands of his brother at Kew Gardens. In
company with Mr. Aiton, Richard Cunningham examined these plants and compared
them with other specimens in the Royal Gardens, which had been brought there
not only from different parts of Australia and Tasmania but also from other
countries, where members of the same botanical groups had been found. He
therefore came to Sydney with an ample knowledge of the Australian flora, so
that his death at the hands of the natives, while on a tour of discovery with
Sir Thomas Mitchell in 1835, was an irreparable loss to New South Wales.</p>

<h4>RICHARD CUNNINGHAM</h4>
</center>
<p>At first, when he heard that his brother was missing, Allan Cunningham
cherished the hope that he might have survived; but as the months passed away
and still no news was received of him, this seemed impossible. Not till May 17,
1836, however, did he learn from Sir Richard Bourke authentically that his
brother had been murdered by the blacks. It transpired that Richard had been
separated from the rest of the party, and, having got lost in the bush, had
fallen in with a tribe of natives who had put him to death.</p>
<p>One of Sir Thomas Mitchell's men had accompanied the mounted police to Budda
Lake, on the Macquarie River, and interviewed some of the blacks belonging to
the tribe, who frankly admitted that four of their number had murdered a white
man on the Bogan. They stated that about six moons previously the white man had
come to them and had made signs that he was hungry. They had given him food and
he encamped with them on that night--either April 29th or 30th--but during the
night he repeatedly got up and walked about, talking to himself and wringing
his hands, and listening as if for the voices of his companions. His actions so
much excited their suspicions that when daylight came they had held a
consultation, and determined for their own safety to kill him, since they
thought he meant to betray them into the hands of their enemies. Accordingly,
one man struck him on the back of the head with a club, and others rushed upon
him with their spears. On searching the bags of the tribe the white men found a
knife and a glove. Thus Richard Cunningham died,[*] who, had he lived, could
probably have filled in the blank spaces in the botanical knowledge of the
country better, perhaps, than any other botanist at that period.</p>
<blockquote>[* Heward: "Hooker's Journal of Botany."</blockquote>
<p>Lieutenant Zouch, then at the head of the police, had proceeded to the spot
on the Bogan mentioned by the blacks, and, on November 10th, had reached a
place called Currindine, where some remains of a white man, a portion of his
coat, and a manilla hat were found. Mr. Zouch's party dug a grave there, and
raised a mound over the remains, the officer himself marking a tree to show the
spot where Richard Cunningham was laid to rest.</p>
<h4>RETURN To NEW SOUTH WALES</h4>
<p>It was shortly after hearing this news that Allan Cunningham was appointed
to succeed his brother in the position of Colonial Botanist in New South Wales.
He took his passage on board the "Norfolk," Captain Gatenby, and joined the
ship at Spithead; she sailed from there on Sunday, October 30, 1836, and
arrived at Port Jackson on Sunday, February 12, 1837. Cunningham took out with
him an inscribed tablet to his brother's memory, which was placed in the Scotch
Church at Sydney.</p>
<p>For the short period that he held the post of Government Botanist the duties
it entailed did not at all appeal to Allan Cunningham, and he was never happy
in the work of superintending what he termed "the Government Cabbage
Garden."[*] Before any length of time had elapsed he decided to resign the post
and begin collecting on his own account, and in January, 1838, he wrote home "I
am now about to enter with all my might on a more legitimate occupation." In
the following April he visited New Zealand, sailing thither in the French
corvette "L'Heroine," 32 guns, Captain Cecille, who had kindly offered him a
passage. At this time Cunningham's health was beginning to fail, and doubtless
the exertion of the expeditions he had formerly undertaken had undermined his
constitution, for he seems to have had little strength to combat a serious
chill which he caught during his stay in New Zealand. Before he left those
shores, paralysed conditions of his limbs and a general weakness attributable
to the meagre food he had had on his travels had so far manifested themselves
that the illness which caused his death seems already to have taken hold of
him.</p>
<blockquote>[* He had been asked to supply the Governor's table with
cabbages.]</blockquote>
<p>There was no improvement in Cunningham's condition when he returned to
Sydney. Gradually he got worse. Notwithstanding the state of his health,
however, his enthusiasm for collecting did not forsake him, and he began
planning a voyage with Captain Wickham in H.M.S. "Beagle". The "Beagle", which
had left Sydney Harbour on November 10, 1838, to complete the survey of Bass
Strait, was expected back at Port Jackson in February, and Captain Wickham had
invited Cunningham to sail with him on his return to the north-west coast,
where he had been instructed to complete a survey of the shores--especially of
those which had been left uncharted by Captain King.</p>
<p>The botanist's letters at this time to his friends at home are pathetic.
Referring to Captain Wickham's offer to take him in the Beagle he says in one
letter:[*] "I am undergoing medical discipline in order to be hearty and well
enough to accompany that excellent officer to the examination of a continent
[coastline ?] first seen by old Dampier on Jan. 4th, 1688, and again by King in
1818-24." Instead of getting better he grew worse, until all hope of his
sailing in the Beagle had to be abandoned, and he says in a second letter,
dated April 12, 1839:[*] "Captain Wickham is on the point of sailing...I have
failed in my best endeavours to patch myself up, and a consultation of four
medical friends has just taken place...the result being an unanimous opinion
that I do not, on any consideration, go to a tropical climate...in the very
enfeebled state of my limbs "; to this he adds: "I shall now pass a quiet
winter here with my friends."</p>
<blockquote>[* Heward: "Hooker's journal of Botany," Vols. 111 and
IV.]</blockquote>
<blockquote>[** Ibid.]</blockquote>
<p>Another letter, dated from Sydney, May 16, 1839, is addressed to Robert
Brown, and is the last which the present writer has been able to trace.[*] In
this Cunningham writes more cheerfully, and says: "I hope that the winter, now
set in, will brace me up. My plan is to lie by now until January or February
next, and then to embark with my collections and baggage, so as to reach London
in 1840."</p>
<blockquote>[* MS. Letters to Robert Brown. British Museum.]</blockquote>
<p>Alas! Cunningham was destined never again to see his native country, for, in
spite of his hopeful words, his end was approaching. At the close of this
letter, indeed, there is a paragraph which seems to show that he knew how
serious a turn his illness was taking, for he wrote: "I am now exhausted in
subject and literally in body, I therefore close, begging you, my dear sir, to
receive this letter from the hands of a poor, decrepit, prematurely-old
traveller, who if he did not all that he might have with the means he
possessed"--and then adds, as if with a touch of pride, remembering what he had
achieved in New South Wales--"at least strove for years to advance botanic
science here from pure love, blending...the knowledge of the plants of the
country with that of its internal geography." Robert Brown must have received
this shortly before he heard the news that Cunningham had passed away, for
there appears on it in Brown's handwriting, the memorandum: "Mr. Cunningham
died on the 27th of June, 1839, at Sydney, as stated in Captain King's letter
to Captain Washington, dated Port Stephens, July 14th/39. R. B."</p>
<p>Allan Cunningham was buried in Sydney, where so many explorers have found a
last resting-place. In St. Andrew's Presbyterian Church there is a tablet to
his memory, another memorial is the beautiful marble urn placed in the
Botanical Gardens, overlooking the waters of Farm Cove. There are yet other
memorials of him to be found in the geography of New South Wales, for his name
has been frequently bestowed upon portions of its territory. Chief of these is
the county which bears his name, wherein, on the northern bank of the Lachlan,
are Mount Allan and Mount Cunningham.</p>
